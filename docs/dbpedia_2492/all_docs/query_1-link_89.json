        "text": "Our Top 10 Best B2K Songs list will look at a popular group from the early 2000s. They were the r&b version of NSYNC and Backstreet Boys. B2K were together from 1998 – 2004. They reunited from 2018-19. They were formed by choreographers Dave Scott and Keshia Gamble. The members are Omarion, J-Boog, Lil’ Fizz and Raz-B. J-Boog, Lil’ Fizz and Raz-B were members of another group called Melodic. They met Omarion and invited him to join their group. Some of their hits include “Bump, Bump, Bump,” “Uh Huh,” “Why I Love You,” “Gots Ta Be,” and “Girlfriend,” as well as other hits. “Bump, Bump, Bump” was the group’s number one hit. They have won several awards during their time together. B2K sold over two million albums worldwide. The group broke up in 2004 after the release of the movie You Got Served. While they were together, they released three studio albums and two compilation albums.\n\nB2K was released in March 2002. It peaked at number one on the r&b charts and two on Billboard 200. It features the singles “Uh Huh,” “Gots Ta Be,” “Why I Love You,” “Baby Girl” and “Last Boyfriend.” The album sold over 500,000 copies. Santa Hook Me Up was released in October 2002. This is the group’s Christmas album. The album features classic and original songs. Pandemonium! was released in December 2002. The album peaked at number one on the r&b charts and 10 on Billboard 200. It features the singles “Bump, Bump, Bump,” “Girlfriend” and “What a Girl Wants.” The album sold over one million copies.\n\nLike most groups, B2K went through personal issues which led to them breaking up. Omarion stayed with their manager and pursued a solo career. The rest of the group wanted to be treated fairly and ended up severing ties with their manager. They reunited for the Millenium Tour in 2019. The tour featured B2K as well as other acts from the 2000s era. It’s too bad B2K couldn’t find a way to stay together. The group recorded great music together. They could have been one of the biggest acts in music. Our Top 10 Best B2K Songs list will feature some of their best songs. If you weren’t a fan of B2K before, maybe these songs will make you a fan.\n\n#10 – Baby Girl\n\nThe 10th song on our Top 10 Best B2K Songs list is “Baby Girl” from B2K’s self-titled album. “Baby Girl” was released in 2001. The song is about a man who is giving advice to a woman who is involved with someone who isn’t good enough for her. He lets her know that the guy takes advantage of her. Her man threw her love away and broke her heart. He knows that she can’t express how she feels, but he knows that there is someone else out there for her. He lets her know that someone will love her the way she deserves to be loved. The narrator wants to know why she looks so sad. He advises her to start again. He advises her that tough times don’t last long. When it comes to love, some people win and some people lose. The important thing is to not give up.\n\nThis is a sweet song about a man helping a woman through a bad relationship. He is not trying to get together with her. He wants her to know that she will be okay. He could have easily gone after her, but he gives her advice about someone being out there for her.
