        "text": "An Artist Fully Realized\n\nWith 13 No. 1s and twice as many top 10 hits under her belt, Rihanna set out to create timeless music instead of chasing a radio-friendly formula with her 2016 magnum opus, ANTI.\n\nBut that shift began with 2015's criminally underrated \"American Oxygen.\" Her most political statement at the time, the goosebump-inducing lyrics detail Rihanna's journey as an immigrant, foreshadowing her then soon-to-be massive Fenty Beauty success. \"We sweat for a nickel and a dime/ Turn it into an empire,\" she sings in the chorus.\n\nReleased four years after Unapologetic — her longest gap between albums at the time — ANTI illustrated Rihanna's greater desire for quality over quantity. \"I needed the music to match my growth,\" she told Vogue in 2016 about the making of ANTI. \"I didn't want to get caught up with anything the world liked, anything the radio liked, anything that I liked, that I've already heard. I just wanted it to be me.\"\n\nThe black-and-white, red paint-splattered album cover signals a rebirth, featuring a real-life image of Rihanna as a child. ANTI lives up to its name in its first 40 seconds, via opening track \"Consideration.\" The minute she declares, \"I got to do things my own way, darling,\" it's apparent that ANTI is not your average Rihanna album.\n\nLead single \"Work\" is the closest to pre-ANTI Rihanna on an album that defies expectations. But the dancehall masterpiece is one of a kind for Rih's refusal to water down the Jamaican patois (different from her native language of Bajan Creole) — proving that she is fully aware of her impact as one of the biggest Caribbean-born artists to make it in the U.S.\n\nMany non-understanding listeners described it as \"gibberish\" at the time. Yet, the general public didn't seem to mind: About a month after its release, \"Work\" became Rihanna's 14th and longest-running chart-topper on the Hot 100. Weeks later, ANTI became her second LP to top the Billboard 200 chart. Subsequently, Rihanna held the No. 1 spots on the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously, her second time achieving such an impressive feat.\n\nRead More: How Rihanna's \"Work\" Reinvigorated Dancehall\n\nANTI is full of pleasant surprises that show off her artistry. Rihanna comes out of left field with the Prince-inspired \"Kiss It Better,\" the album's second single, which sees the superstar falling back on addictive sex that \"feels like crack\" to justify a destructive relationship. \"Same Ol' Mistakes\" is a cover of psychedelic rock band Tame Impala's \"New Person, Same Old Mistakes\" — her first time remaking another artist's song for her own album since \"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\" on Music of the Sun. The Western-themed \"Desperado\" lends itself particularly well to covers by country artists, while the Dido-sampling \"Never Ending\" conveys the uncertainty she feels about entering a new relationship.\n\nElsewhere on ANTI, Rihanna drunk dials an ex (\"Higher\"), compares smoking weed to her lover (\"James Joint\"), and chastises a guy for getting emotionally attached after their fling (\"Needed Me\"). The latter song contains one of Rihanna's most empowering lyrics: \"Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?/ F— ya white horse and ya carriage,\" she asserts in the pre-chorus.\n\nHer voice sounds stronger than ever on \"Love on the Brain,\" a doo-wop ballad resembling Etta James. But Rihanna makes it her own thanks to the bluntness of lines like \"It beats me black and blue but it f— me so good.\"\n\nThe deep cuts on ANTI aren't merely fillers, and even rival some of the album's biggest hits. For instance, \"Sex with Me\" is featured on the deluxe edition as a bonus track, but managed to crack the Hot 100 at No. 83 and reach No. 8 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. Furthermore, the deluxe edition consists of 16 tracks, half of which topped the Dance Club Songs chart — smashing the record (previously held by Katy Perry's Teenage Dream) for the most No. 1s from a single album.\n\nAccolades aside, ANTI is proof that magic happens when an artist of Rihanna's caliber follows their own instincts in pursuit of creating a body of work — one that can outlast them and continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nNominations: Best New Artist, Best Rap Album (Thank Me Later), Best Rap Solo Performance (\"Over\"), Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (\"Fancy\" with Swizz Beatz and T.I.)\n\nPerformances: \"What’s My Name\" (with Rihanna)\n\nThis is the year that seems to sting Drake the most. Best New Artist was a tough battle, with Drizzy, Justin Bieber, Mumford & Sons, and Florence + the Machine in the mix. All of them lost to Esperanza Spalding, in a major upset.\n\nDrake’s bitterness about the moment lingers to this day. On his most recent album For All the Dogs, he has a surprisingly angry lyric about it: \"Four GRAMMYs to my name, a hundred nominations/ Esperanza Spalding was gettin' all the praises/ I'm tryna keep it humble, I'm tryna keep it gracious/ Who give a f— Michelle Obama put you on her playlist?/ Then we never hear from you again like you was taken.\"\n\n2012 — 54th GRAMMY Awards\n\nNominations: Album Of The Year (Rihanna’s Loud, as featured artist), Best Rap Performance (\"Moment 4 Life\" with Nicki Minaj), Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (\"I’m On One\" with DJ Khaled, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne; \"What’s My Name\" with Rihanna)\n\nThis was Drake’s first year as a presenter, so he appears to be moving up in the award show hierarchy. But that doesn’t help him with hardware — he still goes home empty-handed.\n\nThis is also the time that he has multiple nominations in the same category (in this case, two in Best Rap/Sung Collaboration), which is also a trend that would repeat throughout the years.\n\n2013 — 55th GRAMMY Awards\n\nWins: Best Rap Album (Take Care)\n\nNominations: Best Rap Performance (\"HYFR [Hell Ya F—king Right]\" with Lil Wayne), Best Rap Song (\"The Motto\" with Lil Wayne)\n\nHe finally wins! Drake gets his first victory (for Best Rap Album). Also, he is the only Canadian to win that year (sorry, Loreena McKennitt!) However, the big moment wasn't telecast and Drizzy hadn’t yet arrived at the ceremony. In a charming interview from later in the night, Drake recalled jumping out of his car in the middle of traffic to celebrate. There’s also a video of him receiving his GRAMMY in the mail after the fact, which is notable for him immediately taking a celebratory drink from the trophy.\n\n2014 — 56th GRAMMY Awards\n\nNominations: Album Of The Year (Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, m.A.A.d city, as featured artist), Best Rap Album (Nothing Was the Same), Best Rap Performance (\"Started From the Bottom\"), Best Rap Song (\"Started From the Bottom\"; \"F—in’ Problems\" with ASAP Rocky, 2 Chainz, and Kendrick Lamar)\n\nDrake gets five nominations — and again two in one category — with no wins. It’s hard to pinpoint where the tide might have turned regarding the rapper’s feelings about the institution, but this ceremony may well have been it.\n\n2015 — 57th GRAMMY Awards\n\nNominations: Album Of The Year (Beyoncé's Beyoncé, as featured artist), Best Rap Performance (\"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\"), Best Rap Song (\"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\"), Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (\"Tuesday\" with ILoveMakonnen)\n\nOnce again Drake gets an Album Of The Year nomination…for someone else’s album. It’s now the third time this has happened, following Rihanna and Kendrick Lamar. Still, four nominations during a year with no new album is impressive, and shows just how much of a fixture The Boy has become in the pop firmament at this point.\n\n2016 — 58th GRAMMY Awards\n\nNominations: Best Rap Album (If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late), Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (\"Only\" with Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, and Chris Brown), Best Rap Performance (\"Back to Back\"; \"Truffle Butter\" with Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne), Best Rap Song (\"Energy\")\n\nFrom four nominations in 2015 to five this year, tying his personal best from 2014. They are all for rap-related awards, perhaps because Drake didn’t release a \"proper\" album that might have ended up in one of the big categories — If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late had a convoluted rollout.\n\n2017 — 59th GRAMMY Awards\n\nWins: Best Rap/Sung Performance (\"Hotline Bling\"), Best Rap Song (\"Hotline Bling\")\n\nNominations: Album Of The Year (Views), Best Rap Album (Views), Record Of The Year (\"Work\" with Rihanna), Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (\"Work\" with Rihanna), Best R&B Song (\"Come and See Me\" with PartyNextDoor), Best Rap Performance (\"Pop Style\" with The Throne)\n\nThe results of this year marked the beginning of Drake’s public issues with the GRAMMYs. Drake didn't attend the ceremony and, in an interview just after the ceremony, he pushed back against his own victory, upset that \"Hotline Bling,\" a song with no rapping, won two rap awards.\n\n\"Last night at that awards show, I’m a Black artist,\" he said. \"I’m apparently a rapper, even though ‘Hotline Bling’ is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past or because I’m Black.\"\n\nHe was also upset that his hit \"One Dance\" wasn’t nominated in any general categories.\n\n\"There’s pop obligations that [the Recording Academy] have,\" he said. \"And I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year, that is a pop song, and I’m proud of that. I love the rap world and I love the rap community, but I write pop songs for a reason. I want to be like Michael Jackson.\n\n\"I won two awards last night, but I don’t even want them for some reason,\" he continued. \"It just feels weird. It feels like you’re purposely trying to alienate me or pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that [rap] category because it’s the only place you can figure out where to put me.\"\n\nPerhaps because of these issues — it was never confirmed — he never submitted his 2018 project More Life for GRAMMY consideration. Regardless, he ended up with no nominations the following year.\n\n2019 — 61st GRAMMY Awards\n\nWins: Best Rap Song (\"God’s Plan\")\n\nNominations: Album Of The Year (Scorpion), Best Rap Performance (\"Nice for What\"; \"Sicko Mode\" with Travis Scott, Swae Lee, and Big Hawk), Best Rap Song (\"Sicko Mode\" with Travis Scott, Swae Lee, and Big Hawk), Record Of The Year (\"God’s Plan\"), Song Of The Year (\"God’s Plan\")\n\nThis was a year that heightened the Drake/Recording Academy tension even further. First, he turned down a chance to perform during the ceremony. And then, during his acceptance speech for Best Rap Song, Drizzy let awards shows have it.\n\n\"We play in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,\" he began. \"Look, the point is, you already won if you have people singing your songs word for word, if you’re a hero in your hometown. You’re already winning, you don’t need this right here.\"\n\nThe broadcast went to commercial while he was still talking, something that fans thought was an intentional slight. The Academy said otherwise.\n\n\"During Drake’s speech there was a natural pause during his speech and at that moment the producers did assume that he was done and then cut to commercial,\" the Academy said in an official statement. \"However the producers did speak with Drake following his speech and did offer him to come back on stage to finish whatever his thoughts were, but Drake said he was happy with what he said and didn’t have anything to add to it.\"\n\n2020 — 62nd GRAMMY Awards\n\nNominations: Best R&B Song (\"No Guidance\" with Chris Brown), Best Rap Song (\"Gold Roses\" with Rick Ross)\n\nDrake didn’t publicly react to his two losses this year, but he did speak out on a friend’s behalf. The superstar was upset that The Weeknd didn’t receive any nominations, and said so in an Instagram story. He went far enough as to say that awards shows like the GRAMMYs \"may no longer matter\" to up-and-coming artists.\n\n\"I think we should stop allowing ourselves to be shocked every year by the disconnect between impactful music and these awards and just accept that what once was the highest form of recognition may no longer matter to the artists that exist now and the ones that come after,\" Drake wrote. \"It’s like a relative you keep expecting to fix up but they just can’t change their ways.\n\n\"The other day I said @theweeknd was a lock for either album or song of the year along with countless other reasonable assumptions and it just never goes that way,\" he continued. \"This is a great time for somebody to start something new that we can build up over time and pass on to the generations to come.\"\n\nHe went on to list artists he believed should be been nominated: Lil Baby, Pop Smoke, Party Next Door, Popcaan, and \"too many missing names to even name.\"\n\n2021 — 63rd GRAMMY Awards\n\nNominations: Best Rap Song (\"Laugh Now Cry Later\" with Lil Durk), Best Melodic Rap Performance (\"Laugh Now Cry Later\" with Lil Durk), Best Music Video (\"Life Is Good\" with Future)\n\nDrake again misses out on everything he’s nominated for, which might have something to do with what happened the following year.\n\n2022 — 64th GRAMMY Awards\n\nNominations: Best Rap Album (Certified Lover Boy), Best Rap Performance (\"Way 2 Sexy\" with Future and Young Thug) - Both withdrawn\n\nThings came to a boiling point in 2022. Drake was nominated for two awards, but his management asked the Academy to remove the nominations, which they did.\n\n2023 — 65th GRAMMY Awards\n\nJust a couple of years ago, live music still looked uncertain — would variant X, Y or Z derail the train for the umpteenth time? But in that regard, 2023 felt almost totally in the clear — and that's why it feels like the rubber band is stretched back for 2024, and it's ready to launch.\n\nSure, compiling every musical act who's touring in 2024 might be impossible. But GRAMMY.com's stylistic purview is far and wide: country, hardcore, soul, R&B, rap, indie rock, you name it. As such, we're giving it our best shot — and will continue to update the list as more tours are announced.\n\nWithout further ado, here's a major cross section of the 2024 touring landscape as currently announced — from Alvvays to Adam Ant, from Def Leppard to Danny Brown.\n\nLaura Pausini: Laura Pausini World Tour\n\nJan. 6 - April 6\n\nNorth & Latin America\n\nItalian singer (and the Latin Recording Academy's Person Of The Year) Laura Pausini is venturing through North & Latin America in the spring.\n\nSlowdive\n\nJan. 16 - May 18\n\nU.S., Asia & Europe\n\nThe reunited shoegaze greats just released a well-loved new album, everything is alive — which is currently taking on new shades onstage.

Cole are headed on a co-headlining tour; some Drake gigs will be J.-Cole-less.\n\nAna Tijoux\n\nJan. 18 - April 13\n\nNorth America, UK, & Europe\n\nChilean musician Ana Tijoux hasn't undergone a world tour since 2018, but she's about to change that with a run of European gigs following the release of VIDA, her first album in several years. .\n\nMelanie Martinez\n\nJan. 19 - June 27\n\nNorth America, Asia & Australia\n\nAlt-popper Melanie Martinez will segue her PORTALS Tour into The Trilogy Tour, which will see her revive her alter ego \"Cry Baby.\" See her, in this persona, in the U.S. and across the pond.\n\nMitski\n\nJan. 26 - June 6\n\nUK, Europe, & U.S.\n\nFresh off the release ofThe Land is Inhospitable and So Are We, Mitski has announced a jaunt across North America with Tamino, Sunny War, Julia Jacklin, and Sarah Kinsley.\n\nGloria Trevi: Mi Soundtrack World Tour\n\nJan. 26 - Sept. 22\n\nU.S.\n\nKnown as the \"Supreme Diva of Mexican Pop,\" Gloria Trevi is embarking on a world tour to top off the year, as she has recently announced the first leg.\n\nTinashe: BB/ANG3L U.S. Tour\n\nJan. 31 - Feb. 15\n\nU.S.\n\nActress, dancer and singer Tinashe will support her new album, BB/ANG3L, with a run of mostly East Coast dates.\n\nMilitarie Gun\n\nJan. 31 - June 1\n\nNorth America\n\nFresh off a tour with Scowl, hardcore-adjacent, brilliantly melodic punks Militarie Gun continue their rise with a 2024 North American tour.\n\nMariah The Scientist: To Be Eaten Alive Tour\n\nFeb. 1 - May 4\n\nUK, Europe, & U.S.\n\nR&B favorite Mariah the Scientist has been raring to return to the stage: \"I miss hearing my fans scream my lyrics at the top of their lungs.
