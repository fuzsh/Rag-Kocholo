        "text": "Chris Brown recently Twitpic’ed a photo of his certificate for completing the domestic violence counseling sessions he was required to take as part of his sentence for assaulting ex-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. But there’s one person that hasn’t gotten past Brown’s, well, past: former B2K member Raz-B.\n\nChris Brown Finishes Domestic Violence Classes\n\nWARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE\n\nAfter professing his love for Rihanna via Twitter, Raz-B tweeted the following post about Chris Brown battering his ex-girlfriend: “I’m just sitting here thinking how can n*ggas like @EBenet & @Chris Brown disrespect women as intelligent as @HalleBerry11 @Rihanna.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nWhen Brown got wind of Raz-B’s entry, he quickly replied, “@RazB2K n*gga you want attention! Grow up n*gga!!! D*ck in the booty *ss little boy.”\n\nAnd it didn’t end there. Chris Brown continued venting, writing:\n\nTell me this @RazB2K!! Why when the money was coming in you weren’t complaining about getting butt-plugged! #homothug!!!\n\nI ain’t deleting my tweet either!! I was minding my damn business and Peter Pan decides to pop off!!! #whatalame\n\nI’m not mad though!!! I’m just not silent nor am I one of these scary R&B cats!!\n\nI’m not homophobic! He’s just disrespectful!!!\n\nFormer B2K frontman and now Chris Brown buddy Omarion also jumped in.\n\nHahaha #HOMOTHUG Lol!!\n\nYear of the #THIRST\n\nRaz-B then hit them back with a couple more shots.\n\nYo @Chrisbrown I heard about all your boyfriends & tell your cheerleader @1Omarion to shut the fuck up before I send J Boogs to fuck his mama again.\n\n@Chrisbrown you steady talking about your career and homothugs but you have yet to respond about your boyfriend @Andre_Merritt\n\n@Chrisbrown Since you took this that far! Dude, I wasn’t raped! What a disrespect to every kid around the world that has been molested!!!!!\n\n@Chrisbrown u victimize victims, you’re a homophobe, you’re on the down low and a woman beater. Merry Christmas and thanks for showing everyone your true colors.\n\nThen Raz-B’s brother, who calls himself Ricky Romance on Twitter (SMH!) also joined in the Twitter beef to defend his kin.\n\nRaz-B wasn’t disrespecting you. He was stating facts you — you beat women, right??? First day of Spring was recorded by @RazB2K first!!! @Chrisbrown\n\n@Chrisbrown KEEP SPEAKING ON MY BROTHER bitch N*GGA and I’m going to do you how @marqueshouston did @1omarion… you ever been to prison Little Boy??\n\n@Chrisbrown who are you going to pay in L.A. to watch your back WOMEN beater?\n\nFirst @Chrisstokes1969 new artist Mr. Vanilla is talking sh*t.. Now this #womenbeater @chrisbrown say sorry before this gets ugly.\n\nAndre Merritt, who is a singer/songwriter who’s worked with Chris Brown and somehow got pulled into the mix, also replied in hopes of getting his name out of the mix.\n\n@RazB2K yooo my n*gga I will beat your f*cking *ss putting my name is some sh*t!!! Real Talk\n\nFor those who don’t know me I am a singer/songwriter @Chrisbrown is like my little brother and is a big part of my success in this business..\n\nWow It’s funny how n*ggas can hate you for no reason #killyourselves\n\nJesus Christ. This is just insane. This kid Raz-B seems to have some serious mental issues. In case you all aren’t aware, after B2K broke up, Raz-B accused former manager Chris Stokes, as well as R&B singer Marques Houston, of molesting him and his brother. He later retracted his statement.\n\nSigh. Let’s hope this stays on Twitter and doesn’t get physical."
