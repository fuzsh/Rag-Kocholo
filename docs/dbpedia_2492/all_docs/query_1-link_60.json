        "text": "Pleasure P is calling for a battle of two boy bands: his group, Pretty Ricky, and their former tour mates, B2K. On Wednesday (May 26), the singer took to Instagram to share his thoughts on a Verzuz battle between the two groups alongside of a video of the Miami stars dancing to the B2K’s hit song, “Gots Ta Be.”\n\n“Here’s what we gotta say to a @verzuztv against @b2k,” he captioned the post. “We can do y’all shit better than y’all! On tour, we left it on the stage, and everyone saw how that went, but when it comes to these hit records, it’s another story.”\n\nThen, he called on B2K members Omarion, Fizz, J. Boog and Raz B to reunite, so they could go against each other and tour again in the near future. “Put the bullshit aside n come get this work,” Pleasure P said. “Then, let’s tour together again, and give these people what they wanna see. I’ve officially put an address on it! Now who want smoke?”\n\nIn 2018, Pretty Ricky joined the likes of B2K, Ying Yang Twins, Lloyd, Bobby V, Pretty Ricky, Chingy and Mario in The Millennium Tour, which saw fans wearing throwback attire and going down memory lane. Following tension with his group members, Raz B left the tour, leaving his fellow members to adjust their performances and complete the remaining dates without him.\n\nA second tour was announced for 2020, but B2K was no longer on the lineup. Instead, Bow Wow and Omarion were named the tour’s headliners; Sammie, Soulja Boy and Ashanti were also added to the 2020 dates, which were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThough the current status of B2K’s relationship with each other is unknown, Pleasure P thinks a reunion would satisfy fans who want to see them and Pretty Ricky on an arena stage as well as the Verzuz stage.\n\nCheck out his Instagram post below."
