        "text": "Earlier this week, B2K member Raz B was arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend hours before he was supposed to take the stage in Minneapolis. Following a brief investigation, the troubled singer has been released from jail without being charged for the incident.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office in Minnesota concluded that there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute Raz B. Authorities reportedly interviewed witnesses, Raz’s girlfriend and analyzed surveillance footage from the scene before deciding that there wasn’t sufficient evidence to charge the singer.\n\nRaz was released from jail yesterday afternoon. Following his release, Raz’s PR rep posted a statement on Instagram confirming the news.\n\n“Our client, Raz B, has been released from Hennepin County jail. No charges have been filed against him in regards to Wednesday morning’s events.”\n\nAfter his initial arrest, Raz released a statement (via his PR rep) taking full responsibility for his actions. The statement claimed that the alleged assault was a “turning point” for the singer after using unhealthy coping mechanisms linked to childhood trauma.\n\nThe singer apologized to his fans, family and groupmates after stating that he will seek treatment to “become a better man and grow beyond the pain of his worse mistakes.”\n\nThe Millennium Tour has seen its fair share of drama thanks to Raz B. Back in March, the 33-year-old singer temporarily quit the tour after seeing former manager Chris Stokes. Raz was triggered and felt unsafe by Stokes’ presence after he repeatedly accused his former manager of sexually assaulting him as a child. A few days later, he changed his mind.\n\n“I am a work in progress,” Raz shared in an Instagram Stories video. “I appreciate the outpouring of love, empathy, and understanding from my supporters.”\n\nIn April, the singer went viral after he posted a video demanding his glasses back from a Dallas woman he invited to his hotel room, and videos of him falling off stage circulated on social media.\n\nThe tour has eight shows left and is expected to wrap up in Vegas on May 26."
