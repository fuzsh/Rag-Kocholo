        "text": "B2K BIO\n\nIn 2002, B2K incited riots at New York City's Planet Hollywood, scored platinum album sales with their self-titled debut and hooked the nation with their number one hit, \"Uh Huh.\" Nearly a year later, the L.A.-based foursome -Omarion, 18, J Boog, 17, Raz B, 17, and Lil Fizz, 17-is proving lightening can strike twice with their fierce follow-up CD, pandemonium! \"It all came together,\" says Lil Fizz of B2K's latest effort, while Omarion describes the collection as \"magical.\"\n\nThe pandemonium! sessions began earlier this year while B2K was on the Scream 2 Tour and the resulting songs reveal a more personal side to B2K. \"We just set our minds to getting it out for our fans in time for the Holidays,\" says Lil Fizz. Mission accomplished. Besides achieving their lofty goal, B2K delivered \"Bump, Bump, Bump,\" a stellar duet alongside renowned rapper P. Diddy. The Top 10 tune, about cozying up on the dance floor, was written and produced by super-hitmaker R. Kelly (Michael Jackson, Toni Braxton). Plus, B2K lured plenty of influential producers, including Tricky Stewart (Mya), Lil' Steve Russell (3LW), Troy Taylor (Mary J. Blige), and Platinum Status (Destiny's Child). \"We wanted to keep a consistent sound with the few producers we did use,\" explains Omarion. \"They knew our voices so this album really feels like it's us.\" Teaming up with P. Diddy also proved to be a rewarding experience. \"We bonded with Puffy at the video shoot,\" says Omarion. \"He's really funny and he has a lot of energy,\" agrees Lil Fizz. \"He's just a great guy.\"\n\nBut the famed hip-hopper wasn't the only hotshot to make an appearance on pandemonium! B2K also invited fourteen-year-old newcomer Jhene, Lil Fizz's cousin, to lay down vocals on two songs. \"She has a beautiful voice,\" says Lil Fizz, proudly. \"She dances and she's really energetic too.\" He's not the only one who thinks so. The talented teen will release her first disc on Epic Records in February before hitting the road with B2K in the spring. So what can fans expect from the family affair? Says Raz B: \"The stage and the props are going to be a lot bigger. It's going to be a longer show and we're going to spend a lot more money.\" Plus, count on plenty of pyrotechnics----even more than last summer's sold-out Scream 2 Tour with co-headliner Bow Wow. \"The arena tour is the Big Kahuna,\" he promises. \"Fans demand more so we're going to give them more.\"\n\nThat goes for the entire pandemonium! experience. The pandemonium! LP features five different album covers, including limited edition, individually signed covers of each band member, as well as two bonus tracks. Besides releasing two DVDs, a Christmas album, and a remix album of their first CD, B2K penned ten of the 16 tracks on their new disc and drew inspiration from their devotees. \"The title came from our fans,\" says Lil Fizz, with a laugh. \"They're always banging on windows or shutting down malls. It really has been pandemonium.\"\n\nBut it's an experience that the guys wouldn't trade for the world. \"Our fans made it possible for us to come this far,\" says Omarion. \"That's an accomplishment, for real.\" But B2K's fans aren't the only ones who have recognized the group's talent. Since releasing their debut in early 2002, the group has been nominated for two MTV Video Music Awards, two American Music Awards and won BET's coveted Viewer's Choice award. In addition, they were voted \"Best Group\" by the editors of Vibe magazine as part of their annual \"Vibe of the Year Awards,\" and received a Billboard Music Award for having the \"biggest selling R&B single of the year\".\n\n\"Everything is looking really positive right now,\" says Omarion, confidently looking toward the future. \"We just want to keep it moving and be successful and have a third album.\"\n\nDreux Fredericks\n\na.k.a\n\nLil' Fizz\n\nFull Name: Druex Pierre Fredericks\n\nHometown: Los Angeles, California\n\nBirthday: November 26, 1985\n\nZodiac Sign: Sagitarius\n\nSiblings: Brooke, Chez\n\nNickname: Lil Fizz, Fizzle\n\nNickname Meaning: \"Im the rapper of the group, and Lil Fizz means my rhymes bubble.\"\n\nThe B2K sound: \"When people hear our music, theyre going to get excited, theyre going to bounce!\"\n\nStyle vibe: \"Boy-next-door.\"\n\nFree time fun: \"I like Play Station 2, wrestling, basketball and shopping.\"\n\nA girls gotta: \"Have a lot of energy, beautiful eyes and a great smile.\"\n\nIf I were an animal: \"Id be a chameleon, so I could get in with everyone.\"\n\nWhat the world needs now: \"Respect.
