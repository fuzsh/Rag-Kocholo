        "text": "As fans will recall, the crux of O and Fizz’s tension is publicly linked to the (now former) romantic relationship between Fizz and Apryl Jones, O’s former girlfriend and the mother of his children. Even though Fizz and Apryl have since broken up, the question of why Fizz sparked the relationship with his bandmate’s former flame continued to linger on the minds of many. Although B2K’s relationship as a unit hasn’t always been the tightest over the years, many looking from the outside in felt that a line had been irrevocably crossed.\n\nAdditionally, fans wondered how the other members felt about the situation as they’ve largely remained silent. In a recent interview with Big Boy’s Neighborhood, Omarion revealed that he hasn’t spoken to his group mates since their first Millenium Tour, which is when he coincidently found out about Fizz and Apryl. O also revealed that he doesn't have a relationship with Fizz as things stand between them. However, he did express he was open to working things out with his group mate.\n\nRaz-B was a recent guest on BBC 1Xtra where he was also asked about his thoughts on Omarion and Fizz’s situation. DJ Ace wondered if Fizz dating Apryl made things uncomfortable for the other members while they were on tour. “That whole thing right there was selfish. I don't know what the h**l that was. I don’t know if that was Mona Scott and just MTV,” Raz opined. “I don't know what it is because I stayed away from it but there was something there. There was a lot going on that I didn’t know about.”\n\n“Since we were kids, it was always something with some girl,” Raz told Ace. “I remember Fizz got his solo deal first then he got into his solo album and Omarion got [his deal]…Those two always had something. I don't know what it is.”\n\n“Maybe Fizz wants to be Omarion? I don’t know. I’m not taking shots at my boy. Maybe he wants to be number one. I don’t know. So, I can’t really speak on it,” Raz responded. “For me personally, that’s a touchy situation. I don’t care if someone put a billion dollars in my face. I’m still not touching it.”\n\n“People want to blame her or blame him. That’s not the case,” Raz explained. “There [were] internal issues that’s been going on since we were kids. I feel now that certain elements and certain management are out of the way, how do we come together as brothers and really deal with it? If there’s really no love there, which I know there is, then cool.”\n\nDJ Ace then brought up Omarion’s announcement for the next leg of The Millenium Tour on Fizz’s 33rd birthday, which he believed could have rubbed the other B2K members the wrong way after discovering they were ousted from the successful, multi-million dollar tour’s second leg. But according to Raz, it was a masterful move on O’s part.\n\n“I called [Omarion’s] manager and I was like ‘That’s pretty funny’. They say they didn’t plan that but Omari, he’s a pretty smart guy,” Raz said. “That’s their story. I thought it was pretty cool. I thought the s**t was funny.”\n\nAs for the status of B2K, Raz doesn’t see The Millenium Tour as the quartet’s final swan song. He acknowledged that Omarion really didn’t want to do the initial tour in the first place but that doesn’t necessarily mean B2K can’t rise from the ashes. “I will never let B2K die so I got something up my sleeve,” he mysteriously told Ace."
