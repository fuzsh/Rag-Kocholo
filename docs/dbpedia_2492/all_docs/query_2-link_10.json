His third solo album, Ollusion (2010), was released on January 12, 2010, with the lead single, \"I Get It In\".

His younger brother, O'Ryan is also a singer. He's featured in commercials for both Kelloggs Corn Pops and McDonald's. He started his dancing career as a background dancer for the R&B girl group Before Dark and appeared in their music videos. Omari soon began pursuing a career in music, and would go on to become the lead singer of the boy band B2K.\n\nOmari joined the group B2K in 1999 and took the stage name Omarion. The group named themselves B2K, an acronym for \"Boys of The New Millennium\". They began touring with Lil Bow Wow, and eventually released their debut single, \"Uh Huh,\" in 2001. They soon after released their debut album, the self-titled B2K on March 12, 2002. The album peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart. They followed the album up in December with their second album, Pandemonium!, supported by their most successful single, Bump, Bump, Bump featuring P. Diddy. The single peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

This movie was released exclusively on DVD and aired on BET in celebration of Halloween. Omarion has also made several appearances in a number of TV shows, including One on One. Omarion also played the voice of Fifteen Cent in The Proud Family Movie.
