        "text": "Alongside other R&B artists that have voiced their opinions like Tank, Ne-Yo, and more, Omarion has decided to publicly denounce R. Kelly following the airing of Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly documentary. On the heels of B2K‘s Millennium Tour, the group member said he will refrain from performing the melodies penned by Kelly once the trek is over.\n\nOn Sunday (Jan. 6), the “Ice Box” singer took to Twitter to present his stance, noting that those that allowed Kelly’s documented predatory behavior and other actions to fester should be held accountable.\n\n“#RKelly was both a victim & a predator & accordingly must be held accountable but also get professional help,” Omarion wrote. “His artistic genius inspired us all. His music is being muted by the darkness of his actions. The dark always comes to light.” Omarion then noted that the group will still perform their hits under Kelly’s writing credit to avoid the fans’ disappointment, but “after the tour, I am retiring those songs from my set list. I too am raising a future queen.”\n\nOn B2K’s 2002 Pandemonium! album, Kelly was responsible for writing three songs: “Girlfriend,” “What A Girl Wants,” and “Bump, Bump, Bump.”\n\nSurviving R. Kelly takes a deep look at sexual and domestic violence survivors’ recollection of reported abuse by the hands of Kelly that’s spanned decades. The series also analyzed how black girls and women were silenced in trying to mobilize a conviction against Kelly and how the #MuteRKelly movement rose to implement his cancellation.\n\nRead Omarion’s tweets below."
