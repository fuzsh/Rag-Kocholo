        "text": "Los Angeles, CA -\n\nJhené Aiko was seen giving Big Sean an elbow to the balls during a performance together.\n\nAiko performed at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Thursday (August 1) as part of her Magic Hour Tour, where she was joined by a number of special guests, most notably her boyfriend Sean.\n\nA fan in the front row captured the flirtatious moment between the couple as they performed their 2013 collaboration “Beware” (sans Lil Wayne).\n\nThe footage shows Sean standing behind Jhené as she kneels on the stage and suggestively placing his crotch near her head, only for the R&B singer to thrust her elbow into his testicles while laughing.\n\nAfterwards, Aiko asked the Detroit native to perform her favorite song of his, which turned out to be “I Don’t Fuck With You” from his Dark Sky Paradise album.\n\nElsewhere during the show, Aiko performed “One Way St.” with Ab-Soul and “B.S.” with H.E.R. and was joined by Miguel and her sister Mila J for multiple songs.\n\nShe also created a special moment after performing “Post to Be” with Omarion when she said: “You reminded me the other day that the first tour you went on was with B2K.”\n\nAiko then brought out the other three members of the group and told the crowd: “So, I think it’s only right that we honor that moment and we do it like how we did it back then. Ladies and gentleman, B2K.” However, they simply gestured to the audience without performing any of their past hits.\n\nBig Sean and Jhené Aiko also recently performed together at Coachella where they did a duet of “Beware” before the rapper kissed and patted the behind of his longtime girlfriend.\n\nThe Twenty88 duo welcomed their first child together, a boy named Noah, in November 2022, marking Sean’s first foray into parenthood and Aiko’s second.\n\nWhile they’ve yet to reveal their son’s face to the world, the couple have shared various adorable moments on social media — including a photo of Noah checking out exotic animals at a zoo on his first birthday.\n\n“Daddy so proud n grateful for you son!” Sean wrote in the post. “We celebratin all week! Noah’s big 1 [blue heart emoji].”"
