        "text": "If a wrestling writer doesn’t write about wrestling in his wrestling columnâ€¦ if he then becomes a music writer, does he not have to write about music in his music column? Well, technically, no he doesn’t because it’s his column. But, at least there’s something to talk about in the music industry that hasn’t been said from week to week. And, well, I’m not rehashing material over here like I do in my other column.\n\nLet me introduce myself for those of you who may not know me. I’m Daniels and I write â€œThe Week In Wrestlingâ€ over in the wrestling zone. Some of you may not read me, which is coolâ€¦ and hopefully some are you are the five or six fans I brought from over there. I may tick you off from time to time, and I’m sure I’m going to say things about bands that some of you don’t like. That’s fine. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nOnce I get over feeling mildly homosexual in trading in the POWERFUL RED STRIPE of the wrestling zone for the somewhat femmy powder blue stripe of the Music Zoneâ€¦ I think I can bang out some good columns.\n\nMy Song of the Week: As much as it pains me to admit it. Grey Street by the Dave Matthews Band.\n\nGetting Started.\n\nTwo Great Bands that Band Great Together\n\nAudioslave is taking the big step of actually trying to give people a reason to buy CDs. You know, a reason other than â€œyou dirty bastards are STEALING FROM US MILLIONAIRES.â€ They have special, hidden tracks on their website that you can only access if you buy the CD, go to the site, and put the CD in your Computer drive at the site. If so, it releases The Oooh Song, a previously unrealeased track. Tori Amos did this with her last CD, and I’m not sure how it works, but it’s a step in the right direction.\n\nSpeaking of the RIAA, check this article out before you think the RIAA isn’t trying to overstep their boundaries.\n\nThose Angry Rock Stars\n\nOn the front of people who think they can have a relevant political opinion because they know how to (badly) play instruments and rasp out lyricsâ€¦ Serj Tankian has gone on record calling President Bush’s victory in the 2000 elections a â€œblodless coup.â€\n\n“My feelings are that I think that there was a coup d’etat in this country without military weapons a couple of years ago. I’m trying to say it lightly, but I think the American dream has definitely been taken for a ride by people with very strong financial concerns whose needs are being met by our foreign policy and whose negative repercussions are meeting us at our doorstep,”\n\nYeah, at some point, someone needs to tell this clueless f*ck that he is CURRENTLY LIVING the American Dream. He does nothing for a living and makes millions of dollars for basically sitting on his ass and writing bad rock songs. I would be curious to know if he even voted. And, while on that note, what in the name of Richard Simmons is he talking about with people with very strong financial concerns whose needs are being met by our foreign policy and whose negative repercussions are meeting us at our doorstep. What the hell does that even mean? If you’re going to try and form a political opinion, at least do it with a coherent sentence. The American Dream is working hard and being successful. Getting your own house and live out from under the thumb of a repressive government, with the freedom to do as you choose. Now, the repressive government thing is up for discussion. This guy, who strums a guitar for a living is going to tell me that the rich are trying to run my life. Rock stars don’t like you to remember that they waste more money than most of us will ever see. Now, while Eric S may agree with him that the election was a sham, the fact is that it happened according to the book. There was a count, a recount, another recount, a certification, and an intervention by the court system, which Al B Sure asked for and lost. That’s Americaâ€¦ like it or not.\n\nThen, never to be outdone, Tom Morello of Audioslave chimed in with: “Everyone can agree that a guy like Saddam Hussein is a really horrible dude that deserves what he gets. If he was the only person living in Iraq that would be one thing, but just as we saw and felt the horrific pain and devastation that can be caused to an entire society by the events of September 11, where thousands of absolutely innocent people were killed for some madman’s agenda, I think it’s important that no innocent lives be taken in our name for someone’s political agenda.”\n\nThis, I can at least agree with to an extent. Not to mention that Morello, at least, has a college degree and can form a coherent sentence. I also absolutely agree he needs to get bounced out of power without just blowing the hell out of all of Iraq. Don’t we have specially trained operatives who can go infiltrate places and kill people with ballpoint pens and chewing gum?\n\nSo, as tends to happen in the music industry, someone else had a differing opinion, who happens to be a guy I never heard of. Former SOD and Current MOD frontman Billy Milano had this to say:\n\nI would just like to remind that anti-American piece of shit Serj and that liberal Berkeley twat Tom that I don’t see them living in Europe or Armenia. These guys complain like they have never had an opportunity, but live comfortably in CALIFORNIA! Next to their rat buddy John Walker Lindh!!! I got an idea. Get the f*ck out. Take all the MONEY (that’s US DOLLARS) you’ve made and go make the world a better place by paying for some Armenian kids’ education or build a house for some Iraqi family. USE YOUR MONEY!! But shut the f*ck up! Seriously! Actor Alec Baldwin announced on ‘Politically Incorrect’ that he would move out of America if Bush won. Guess where his ass is? The California hills drinking champagne cocktails with the Rosado brothers and Hyman Roth [â€¦]Serj, go f*ck yourself you anti-American asshole. Just remember how much you hate America when you’re on stage or riding on your tour bus or when you’re counting your merch money\n\nBasicallyâ€¦ people talk bigâ€¦ but when it comes time to put their money where their mouth is, they fall apart.\n\nThose Angry Rappers\n\nEminem has a new feud to deal with, against Ray Benzio. Benzio, apparently, has a problem with artists who belong to, what he calls, the machine. Apparently, this well read chap enjoys â€œOne Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.â€\n\nHe went out to call Em the â€œVanilla Ice of 2003â€ but was quick to say he doesn’t have a â€œbeefâ€ with Em. In fact, he actually said I wanna be careful with the word â€˜beef’. Because, God knows, you don’t want those PETA f*cks after you like Affleck.\n\nHis problem stems from the fact that Eminem can get away with talking about his personal issues and his pain. He can get away with talking about killing his girlfriend and drugs and personal issues, but black folks have to work harder and Rock The Party to get spins on the radio.\n\nBenzio was very careful to say he wants to keep this as a war of words, and nothing further.\n\nOr, since no one has heard of Benzio and everyone has heard of Eminem, he wants to take shots because he knows Em will respond, which will get him publicity. He’s using Em’s very own patented formula of getting press. More power to him. He goes on to tell us he has lots more to say, but it will only be available on his upcoming album.\n\nToday’s Releases\n\nIt Ain’t Safe No More: Busta Rhymes â€“ Busta is currently one of the better rappers in the world, in my own dumb opinion. As someone who isn’t an exceptionally good source of Rap critique, I can say that Busta is one of the few rappers who does entertain me, usually without fail. The song on his homepage, which I assume is the launch single, is as good as anything else he’s put out.\n\nJust Whitney: Whitney Houston â€“ She never smoked Crack.\n\nLord of the Rings: the Two Towers Soundtrack â€“ It’s a soundtrack. Should be titled â€œwe could put forty minutes of Frodo masturbation sounds and fan-boys will still buy it.â€ You’re going to check out the movie before you pick up the soundtrack anyway, so we may as well wait till then.\n\nFeast On Scraps: Alanis Morriessette â€“ Alanis is usually pretty good for a single or two, but hasn’t put out a solid album since Jagged Little Pill, where almost every song was decent. To be fair though, I found live versions of the three tracks from this, and all three are pretty good. Fear of Bliss, Bent For You, and Sorry To Myself all get a thumbs up from me. If I was still a fan, it’s only one step away from my â€œRule of Four.â€ That being, if you find four good songsâ€¦ the CD is worth buying.\n\nI Care 4 U: Aaliyah â€“ I’m convinced there’s just a giant Vault somewhere just to the left of Fort Knox where all rappers pre-record and store two albums for every one they make. The post-mortem releases continue here.\n\nRound Room: Phish â€“ the best moment in my life was when these guys broke up, so the damn hippies stopped invading my town twice per year. Once to trash Saratoga Performing Arts Center, and once to trash Albanyâ€¦ Actually, scratch thatâ€¦ they can have Albany. Apparently, a reunion has been in the works since October, and the band will make their first live performance in two year on SNL on the 19th. A tour is slated for February and, luckily for me, the closest they get to here is Uniondale. THAT’S RIGHT YOU UPPITY LONG ISLANDERSâ€¦ THE HIPPIES ARE COMINGâ€¦ HIDE THE SHRUBBERY.\n\nElectric Circus: Circus â€“ I Listened to two tracks called Aquarius and Between You, Me, And Liberation. Definitely not my thing. Only thing I can really compare them to is PM Dawn. Kinda mellow, electronic, Enigma-ish vibe, but not nearly as good. No webpage was readily available on Google. Not my kinda thing. Did I mention it wasn’t my kind of thingâ€¦ because it’s really not.\n\nBlock Party: DJ Envy â€“ Website says he specializes in remixesâ€¦ moving onâ€¦â€¦\n\nPandemonium!: B2K â€“ Finally, what the world has been waiting for. The NEW B2K Album!!! The new track Bump, Bump, Bump is currently tearing up the US Charts, thus once again destroying my faith in 75% of the world. I could only get through about thirty seconds of their track before I had to run away. But it’s out.\n\nThey Hate Everyone\n\nHammerfest, which is apparently a white supremacy rock concert held once a year, has been cancelled in Florida. The owner of the club where it was being performed was supposedly clueless about what it was. Due to threats from protesters and possible violence, the venue pulled out of the show. Black folks do it and it’s called the â€œMillion Man Marchâ€ and is supported by everyone. Native Indian Americans do it and it’s called a Rally. White folks do it and it’s a hate festival met by protesters. Gotta love the US.\n\nIt’s Over Axl, Move On\n\nThe Guns â€˜n Roses tour has offically been cancelled. Before hand, a bunch of the dates had been cancelled, with Axl’s health being cited as the reason. This touched off riots in a couple of cities like it was 1986. The official reason the label has given for the full cancellation is Axl has â€œhealth issues.â€ Yeah, his issues being that NO ONE (exceptFleaandthatsokbecauseFleaisyourgodandmine) GIVES A FUCK ABOUT GUNS AND ROSES ANYMORE. I work across the street from the Pepsi Arena in Albany, where one of the few shows did go off. I also am cursed with my parking area being next door to the Pepsi. On a bad concert night (Toby Keith and George Strait stand out) it can take me fifteen to thirty minutes to get out of the garage. The night of the GNR concert I got right out of there. A source inside the Pepsi tells me they sold just over five thousands tickets for the Albany show.\n\nMy guess: Axl’s ego can’t handle playing for less than half full houses. After a few nights of this, Axl came down with a mysterious illness. The houses and the label weren’t willing to put up with Axl’s shit, because they concert wasn’t all that big of a draw. The houses, and therefore the labels, told Axl to shape up or ship outâ€¦ and he shipped out.\n\nThat, and the minor fact that I would have went to see Guns n Rosesâ€¦ if it was actually Guns n Roses. But there is no way in hell I am paying $50 for general admission to see Axl and a band that isn’t GNR. Absolutely Not. It ain’t going to see GNR, it’s going to see Axl. Obviously, a lot of people shared my opinion, because they had to cancel the showsâ€¦ much to Flea’s chagrin.\n\nSpeaking of Bands Whose Time Has Goneâ€¦\n\nLimp Bizkit has announced their new album as due out on April Fool’s Day. How convenient as you’ll have to be a 13-year old fool to buy anything else that this worthless band puts out. I got duped with Chocolate Starfish, and I’m done with that.\n\nWith the Rollin video, Fred proved he’s become nothing more than a marketed monkey, doing whatever his publicists and managers tell him do. Rollin could have been a Backstreet Boys or N’Sync video, with the Happy Little Rollin’ Dance. Fred had this to say about the new album:\n\n“I’m in the studio right now doing vocals and edits. It’s getting to that point where the excitement begins!! Looks like April is the month for Limp Bizkit to drop some science. I hope you’re prepared. We’ve written a lot of songs, and we feel like they came straight from our souls. If you’ve ever liked Limp Bizkit before, then you are in for a treat!!”\n\nThe only saving grace to this album is that Al Jorgenson of Ministry has been involved in the writing of some the tracks. He would have to be, since I’m convinced everything cool that band ever did was done by Wesâ€¦ and when they started to suck, he decided it was time to leave. They’ve picked up Mikey Smith (ex-SNOT) in his placeâ€¦ but Wes is the member of that band people Identify, almost moreso than Durst.\n\nSpeaking of People Who Shouldn’t Release Solo Albums\n\nScott Weiland is working on a new solo project. Producer Josh Abraham said that Weiland’s tracks were far more â€œartsyâ€ than anything from Stone Temple Pilots. When all the producer can say is â€œArtsy,â€ the album sucks. Of course, this isn’t news if you were one of the saps who bought Weilands first solo album thinking it would be anything like STP. And some fools will buy this album, too.\n\nGluttons.\n\nReading the article, it becomes quickly apparent that people are trying to say nice things about it.\n\nAnd, for the record, Sheryl Crow appears on it. Just thought you STP fans would like to know that.\n\nPearl Jam vs Creed vs Limp\n\nWelcome to the Op-Ed section of this column.\n\nEh, who the f*ck am I kidding? The whole column is pretty much Op-Ed with some news sprinkled in.\n\nIn Yesterday’s News, John Marshall brought up that punk Freakboy’s column in which he asked why people hate on Creed. He gave three reasons, those being 1) They’re Christian Rock, 2) They Sound too much like Pearl Jam, and 3) Durst hates on Stapp.\n\nMy opinions:\n\nFirst, I don’t care if they’re singing about how I should kiss my fellow Beer Pong Partnerâ€¦ If I like the music and they sound good, I’ll listen to it. The only song that’s â€œspoke to meâ€ in about ten years is In The End by Linkin Park.\n\nSecond. They sound too much like Pearl Jam. Nah, I don’t buy this either. You can say that any band sounds like anyone else. Personally, I think Stapp goes for more a Jim Morrisson sound than an Eddie Vedder, and the music is tuned WAY lower than everything Pearl Jam has ever done. Creed uses Drop-D or lower in almost everything. Pearl Jam rarely, if ever, uses it. Pearl Jam, almost always, have gone for a lighter sound. Then, Marshall goes on to say that Pearl Jam really does rock, but you have to have a love for the band.\n\nWrongâ€¦ Pearl Jam hasn’t rocked since Vitalogy with Not For You. Once is possibly one of the greatest Rock songs of the ninties. Somewhere between Vitalogy and No Code, Eddie decided he wanted to lead the Pink Floyd of this generationâ€¦ and the band went downhill from there. They forgot their roots. They’re the last Seattle band, and the Seattle sound is gone from them.\n\nThirdâ€¦ Durst hates on Stapp. See WAY above.\n\nBasically, I lost interest in Creed when they played an ampitheater this past summer and asked $52.50 for lawn tickets. Sorry guysâ€¦ you’re not that good yet. Aerosmith didn’t charge that much and, got news for you, you guys ain’t Aerosmithâ€¦ not yet.\n\nThe Rolling Stones are getting shit for charging for charging $50/head for tickets to a concert in Serbia. $50 might seem cheap for us, but we have to keep in mind that the average income in Serbia is $157/month. It would be equivalent to the Stones charging about $250 for a ticket to a concert in the US.\n\nOh, wait a minuteâ€¦ THEY WOULD! But then, Americans have money to give away, so it’s ok to soak us, but not ok to soak Serbia. CHARGE â€˜EM MORE, MICK!!!!\n\nIn Other News\n\nSpecial contestâ€¦ see how many times other 411 writers can use the DROP.\n\nNew Reviews up on the site. Evocator Manes has new CD reviews of Coal Chamber, Hammerfall, and WC. New Rap Reviewer Aaron Cameron has a review of the new Snoop Dogg album. Michael Mitchern, a male presumably, reviewed Shania Twain’s new record. I’m going to hope he just bought it for the pictures.\n\nEric Katz, who will tell you happily that all your base do indeed belong to him, checks in with the Indie scene. He also tells us that he can only check in once every couple weeks. PUNK, THIS SITE IS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR LIFE. To hear about a bunch of bands you’ve never heard of, check it out.\n\nCody Webster Talks about screwing household pets. Maybe that powder blue stripe has something to say after all. He also talks about the Good, Bad, and Sad in this week’s music news.\n\nBilly Corgin’s new band, Zwan has a first single called â€œHonestly.â€ Look for a First Listen sometime later this week. Hopefully, it’ll go off better than my Nirvana Debacle. AND MAYBE CANKAYA WILL LET ME SAY SOMETHING WITHOUT BITCHING THAT I’M WRONG!\n\nThat’s it for this week. Feedback, as always, is welcomed and encouraged.\n\nUntil next week."
