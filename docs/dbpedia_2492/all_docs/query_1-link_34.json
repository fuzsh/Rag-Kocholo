        "text": "B2K took the favorite music group award and thrilled the audience with a performance at Nickelodeon’s 16th Annual Kids’ Choice Awards. Saturday’s event at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, Calif., found kids screaming for B2K as they performed a “My Girl”/”Girlfriend” medley, with fans hanging on their every word and greeting them with shouts of “We love you!”\n\nJustin Timberlake took to the stage to perform “Rock Your Body,” much to the delight of his numerous female fans, many of whom screamed out proposals of marriage. Timberlake, who lost out to Nelly as favorite male singer, didn’t go home empty-handed, though, as he took best of show in the annual celebrity burp-off.\n\nAlso winning orange blimp-shaped awards for music was Ashanti, who took the favorite female singer honor, favorite band No Doubt, and Avril Lavigne, whose “Sk8ter Boi” was named favorite song.\n\nRapper-turned-actor Will Smith offered some sage advice upon accepting a special silver Wannabe Award blimp — given to the celebrity role model who kids most want to be like — telling kids to “read, work hard and never let anyone tell you can’t do something.”\n\nActor/comedian Adam Sandler and actress Amanda Bynes were multiple winners, each taking home two awards from the event, hosted for the seventh year by former talk show host Rosie O’Donnell. Sandler won favorite movie actor for “Mr. Deeds” and for his voice work in the animated musical comedy “Eight Crazy Nights.” Bynes won favorite film actress for her role in the film “Big Fat Liar” and favorite TV actress for Nick’s own “The Amanda Show.”\n\nHere are is the full Kids’ Choice Awards winners list:\n\nFavorite movie: “Austin Powers in Goldmember”\n\nFavorite movie actress: Amanda Bynes in “Big Fat Liar”\n\nFavorite movie actor: Adam Sandler in “Mr. Deeds”\n\nFavorite music group: B2K\n\nFavorite female singer: Ashanti\n\nFavorite male singer: Nelly\n\nFavorite band: No Doubt\n\nFavorite song: “Sk8ter Boi” by Avril Lavigne\n\nFavorite TV show: “Lizzie McGuire”\n\nFavorite TV actress: Amanda Bynes in “The Amanda Show” and “What I Like About You”\n\nFavorite TV actor: Frankie Muniz in “Malcolm in the Middle”\n\nWannabe Award: Will Smith\n\nFavorite cartoon: “SpongeBob SquarePants”\n\nFavorite book: “A Series of Unfortunate Events” series by Lemony Snicket\n\nFavorite female athlete: Michelle Kwan\n\nFavorite male athlete: Tony Hawk\n\nFavorite sports team: Los Angeles Lakers\n\nFavorite voice from an animated movie: Adam Sandler in “Eight Crazy Nights”\n\nFavorite video game: “SpongeBob SquarePants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman”\n\nFavorite female butt kicker: Jennifer Love Hewitt in “The Tuxedo”\n\nFavorite male butt kicker: Jackie Chan in “The Tuxedo”\n\nFavorite fart in a movie: “Scooby Doo”"
