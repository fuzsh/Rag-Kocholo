        "text": "If you miss the glory days of early-2000s R&B, you are in for a treat.\n\nMulti-platinum R&B group B2K have announced a 2019 reunion tour — titled “The Millenium Tour” — which will make its way to Detroit on April 24 at Little Caesars Arena.\n\nAll four original members — Omarion, Lil’ Fizz, Raz-B and J-Boog — will be busting out their sensual dance choreography, matching outfits and crooning voices. And they are bringing a handful of other R&B favorites from the early noughts with them.\n\nJoining the You Got Served stars on “The Millenium Tour” are fellow heartbreakers Mario, Pretty Ricky, Lloyd, Ying Yang Twins, Chingy and Bobby V.\n\nIt’s been nearly two decades since B2K’s self-titled debut, which featured singles “Uh Huh,” “Gots Ta Be” and “Why I Love You.” The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard charts in 2002. Later that year, they stirred up sophomore album Pandemonium!, which added “Bump Bump Bump” and “Girlfriend” to their list of hits.\n\nSince the group disbanded in 2004, the genre of R&B boy bands has become seemingly non-existent. But with the market for 90s and 00s nostalgia booming, B2K wants to make sure you get served one more time.\n\nTickets go on sale ($49.50+) starting Monday, Jan. 21 at 10 a.m. and can be purchased by visiting 313Presents.com\n\nMike Dionne is an editorial intern at Metro Times."
