I'd love it if I heard semi-regularly stuff like Neja, Da Buzz, ATB, Perpetuous Dreamer, Tiesto, Ian Van Dahl...etc. If they can't add new stuff from artists they already play, eg, \"When The Dawn Breaks\", \"Take Me Away\", etc...they can at least play some former hits of a few years back.\n\nInstead, I get to hear \"Another Night\" and \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" every single day.\n\nThe question is... why do you guys still listen to it? KTU has sucked since the late 90s. The best period was their first 2-3 years, when they actually played club music (i.e. 3rd Party \"Can You Feel It\" and De'Lacy \"Hideaway\" and actual imports -Gala \"Freed From Desire\"-).\n\nAnd the morning show is a total joke, with the most obnoxious people ever... I swear I think a requirement to work there is to have the most horrible \"laugh\"!\n\nAnd now the morning show is playing.... heavy metal? They have this special section about the 80s, but instead of playing 80s dance music, they play stuff like \"Welcome To The Jungle\" and \"You Give Love A Bad Name\". WTF???\n\nNEXT!\n\nPost by johnparker on\n\nThis is their actual most played for 2000. Not sure if there year end chart was the same as they sometimes would change chart positions.

I know it's not the exact list broadcasted, but it's actually a better representation of what was played on the station for the year. I think I may have seen the 2004 countdown in this form, and Deborah Cox's SHOTWTH actually was #1, but since it was #1 for 2003, they pushed it back to #11 when the countdown aired.\n\nAnd quite frankly, I am hopeful that \"Jellyhead\" at least made it to the KTU 1997 list (...egregiously absent from their 1996 countdown...), should you be able to find it. Z100, which was a staunch supporter of it back in the day, had ranked it as their #95 track of 1996 and #23 track of 1997.\n\n[oh...incidentally, Cascada Z100 spins are at 1058 to date, a strong #1 of the first near-third of the year, with the \"Unwritten\" in 2nd at 837. It's too early to tell, but I'm positive we've got yet another top 10 robbins hit for the year, and heck, Z100 might pull a 2002 DJ Sammy and have it wind up as #2...we'll see what the year brings... :) KTU's got it at #2, trailing by 5 spins under \"Love On My Mind.\"]"
