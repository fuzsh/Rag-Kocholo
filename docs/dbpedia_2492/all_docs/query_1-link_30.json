The two became the talk of the town during the airing of last season of the reality show - Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood.\n\nWhile filming, Lil Fizz and Apryl, who called themselves \"best friends\" decided to take their friendship to another level. They not only decided to become boyfriend and girlfriend but also moved in together.\n\nTheir relationship seemed to be exciting news for most of their fans because the two were facing problems with their ex-lovers, Omarion and Moniece Slaughter. However, it started out rocky, and some thought it should not have begun at all.\n\nIn January 2020, a rumour surfaced that the two were breaking up. It was alleged that they had unfollowed each other on Instagram. The reason was unknown, but fans suspected that there were relationship woes, especially since Apryl was accused of cheating.\n\nWhen asked about the breakup, Apryl responded that the two were at that time focusing on raising their children.

This came after Apryl Jones opened up that Dreux Pierre Frederic was her biggest supporter and comforter.\n\nJones said that Lil was a dependable figure in her life after her former boyfriend left her. She even credited him for also supporting her children with Omarion.\n\nApparently, these words did not sit well with Moniece.
