        "text": "‘Serious‘ hitmaker Omarion has been blazing the promo trail something serious in support of his forthcoming seventh solo studio album, ‘Full Circle: Sonic Book Two.’\n\nHeaded to digital shelves on December 15, the 12-track effort acts as the conceptual sequel to the May 5-released ‘Sonic Book One.’\n\nBeyond rocking the talk show circuit with live performances to build awareness (as seen on ‘Tamron Hall‘ above), the 39-year-old (born Omarion Grandberry) has also done his rounds on the Web as evidenced by visits to podcasts, radio stations, and a headline-grabbing stop at ‘The Jason Lee Show.’\n\nChatter around the latter definitely put him at war with his former girlfriend, Apryl Jones, as well as his ‘Post To Be’ collaborator Chris Brown, but Grandberry still has nothing but fond memories of his 2014 smash with the R&B superstar. At 3x Platinum in the United States (for certified sales of 3 million), ‘Post’ remains O’s biggest hit.\n\n“It’s really an affirmation,” he said glowingly of the song on the ‘Go with Elmo Lovano’ podcast recently. “Thanks to Jhene Aiko and Chris for helping me amplify that record. I want to say in our class and genre, there’s not a bigger song and a bigger collective in R&B.”\n\nThe quote came earlier this month when the former B2K frontman faced controversy for releasing a ‘Sped Up’ version of the tune that garnered disapproval from many including Brown’s fans (affectionately called #TeamBreezy).\n\nSpeaking of B2K, Grandberry may have raised eyebrows during his stop at ‘Jason Lee’ with his commentary on group member Lil Fizz, but when it comes to the band-at-large O has made clear there won’t be any reunions any time soon.\n\n“I don’t think so,” he told WBLS when quizzed about whispers of a Vegas residency. “I think that I’m definitely in a different space. That’s what the ‘Millennium Tour‘ was for…I feel that I’ve given that back and now it’s time for me to continue to expand my legacy on my own.”\n\nBut, while there won’t be any stage or studio time shared with Fizz, J-Boog, or Raz B in the immediate future, the GRAMMY nominee did roll out a few other names he’d love to collaborate with.\n\n“I would love to work with Ambre, she’s really dope. I would love to work with HER and I would love to work with SZA,” he said to WBLS before elaborating he’s met the latter before but would not confirm if they ever dished on working together. “Anything is possible.”\n\n[photo credit: ABC/Jeff Neira]"
