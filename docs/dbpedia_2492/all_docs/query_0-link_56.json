        "text": "Puff Daddy (Sean \"Puffy\" Combs) was born in Harlem, New York in 1970. The year that Puff Daddy became a household name was 1997 when Puffy ruled the music charts with his producing abilities and his own LP. With a sharp eye on business and hip hop music, Puff Daddy took rap and sampling to new heights in 1997 - and with this success came criticism as well. Puff Daddy's mother was a model, and his father (he found out later in life) was a well-known street hustler who was murdered when Puff was 3. Puff Daddy's mother had the family stay in Harlem for several years so her children could experience city life and diversity. Eventually the family moved to the suburbs of Mount Vernon, New York and where Puff went to a private school. It was while he was at school and a member of the football team that he inherited the nickname \"Puffy\" - because he would \"puff\" out his chest to make his body seem bigger. Throughout his childhood and into college, Puff's entrepreneurial characteristics became stronger starting with his paper route and into his college years of house party and concert promotions. After attending Howard University, Puff Daddy started working in the music industry as an intern at Uptown Records (thanks to his childhood friend, Heavy D). His position at the company eventually led him up the ladder to vice-president and in 1990 Puff Daddy was the executive producer for an LP by Father MC.\n\nA celebrity basketball game and benefit Puff had organized turned tragic when a stampede occurred within the audience and 9 people died of \"asphyxia due to compression of the chest.\" Poor security and organization were sited as the cause of the tragedy, and Puff Daddy had been in charge of both. The event devastated Puff Daddy, but soon he was feeling the effects of success with work on hit LPs by Mary J. Blige, Jodeci and Heavy D.\n\nAfter working at Uptown Records throughout the early 90s and after being let go from the company, Puff Daddy established Bad Boy Entertainment whose clients eventually include the late Notorious B.I.G., 112, Total,Faith Evans, and Craig Mack. Bad Boy's first major hit came with the 1994 Craig Mack single, \"Flava In Ya Ear.\" In a short 4 years, Bad Boy Entertainment sold approximately $100 million worth of recordings. Bad Boy Entertainment also made a multi-million dollar deal with Arista Records allowing the support of the label without impinging on artistic control.\n\nPuff Daddy's production success with Bad Boy Entertainment continued with the Notorious B.I.G.'s emergence as a well-known rap artist with his LP Ready To Die and the single \"Big Poppa.\" Bad Boy Entertainment could now boast an impressive line-up of acts, and multi-platinum success.\n\nAt the same time, a once friendly relationship with rapper 2Pac and Death Row's Suge Knight had turned into a war of words, comments, and accusations, especially in 2Pac's song \"Hit 'Em Up.\" The East coast versus West coast rivalry continued after 2Pac was fatally shot, and many rumors connected Puff Daddy and the Notorious B.I.G. with his death.\n\nPuff Daddy began producing for other artists outside his own company including Boyz II Men, SWV, Mariah Carey, Lil' Kim, Babyface, New Edition, and Aretha Franklin.\n\nPuff topped the Billboard Rap Singles chart for 9 weeks helping out Lil' Kim with \"No Time.\"\n\n# 17 Singles Artist of the Year (# 1 Male Artist of the Year)\n\nPuff Daddy hit the Top 40 helped out by Mase with \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down.\"\n\n\"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\" topped the Billboard R&B Singles Sales chart for 12 weeks.\n\nPuff Daddy had big plans for the up-coming release of the Notorious B.I.G.'s next LP. But Puffy lost his close friend to gunshots. B.I.G.'s LP, Life After Death, was released 3 weeks later to great commercial and critical success. Puff Daddy's reaction to B.I.G.'s death (and the death of rival 2Pac the year before) was to leave the business - but friends talked him out of it. \"When everything happened, I just wanted to give up. I didn't wanna work, I didn't wanna make music no more.\"\n\n\"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart for 6 weeks, the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart for 7 weeks, the Billboard R&B Singles chart for 6 weeks, the Billboard Dance Music Maxi-Singles Sales chart for 6 weeks, and the Billboard Rap Singles chart for 12 weeks.\n\nThe single \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\" was certified 2x platinum.\n\n\"I'll Be Missing You\" topped the Billboard Dance Music Maxi-Singles Sales chart for 11 weeks.\n\nPuff hit the Top 40 with his tribute to Notorious B.I.G. - \"I'll Be Missing You\" (with Faith Evans and 112). The track hit the Top 10 by the end of the month.\n\n\"I'll Be Missing You\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart for 11 weeks, the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart for 9 weeks, the Billboard R&B Singles chart for 8 weeks, the Billboard R&B Singles Sales chart for 8 weeks, and the Billboard Rap Singles chart for 8 weeks.\n\nPuff Daddy released his own LP, No Way Out (shown as Puff Daddy & The Family) to equally commercial success, but much less critical enjoyment. Most of Puff Daddy's appearance on the charts were collaborations: from his own LP, from B.I.G.'s LP, or as a featured artists on other artist's LPs. One of Puff Daddy's protegees, Mase, showed up along side many of Puff Daddy's hits, including his first chart appearance, \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down.\" But the hit that crossed platforms and put Puff Daddy in the limelight with his tribute to his slain friend, \"I'll Be Missing You\" (which also featured Faith Evans and 112). The track also demonstrated a common theme in Puff Daddy's art of production - sampling a familiar 80s track (in this case The Police's \"Every Breath You Take\") and up-dating the lyrics with rap and hip hop. \"I did it as a tribute to Biggie, so I feel like it came out of my love for him... whatever else it does, I'm happy,\" The money from the single was used to set up a fund for B.I.G.'s children.\n\nThe single \"I'll Be Missing You\" was certified 3x platinum.\n\nPuffy hit the Top 40 helping out The Notorious B.I.G. and Mase with \"Mo Money Mo Problems.\"\n\n\"I'll Be Missing You\" topped the UK Singles chart for 5 weeks.\n\nPuffy hit the Top 10 helping out The Notorious B.I.G. and Mase with \"Mo Money Mo Problems.\"\n\nNo Way Out topped the Billboard 200 Albums chart for 4 weeks and the Billboard R&B Album charts for 5 weeks.\n\nPuffy hit #1 for a week with \"I'll Be Missing You.\"\n\nPuffy hit the Top 40 helping out SWV week with \"Someone.\"\n\n\"Mo Money Mo Problems\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart for 2 weeks, the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart for 4 weeks, the Billboard R&B Singles Airplay chart for 2 weeks, the Billboard Dance Music Maxi-Singles Sales chart for 2 weeks, and the Billboard Rap Singles chart for 4 weeks.\n\nPuffy appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone.\n\nPuff Daddy performed \"I'll Be Missing You\" at the MTV Video Music Awards with Sting and the connection continued at the end of the year when Puffy remixed The Police classic \"Roxanne\" for their greatest hits collection. Puffy also won a MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video (\"I'll Be Missing You\") and was also nominated for Viewer's Choice.\n\nPuffy won a Billboard Music Video Award for Best Clip (R&B/Urban) (\"Mo Money Mo Problems\").\n\nNo Way Out was certified 2x platinum.\n\nPuffy hit #1 helping out The Notorious B.I.G. and Mase with \"Mo Money Mo Problems.\"\n\nPuffy could be heard on Busta Rhymes' LP, When Disaster Strikes, on the track \"Body Rock.\"\n\nNo Way Out was certified 3x platinum.\n\nNo Way Out was certified 4x platinum and the single \"Been Around The World\" was certified platinum.\n\nPuff Daddy & The Family hit the Top 40 with \"It's All About The Benjamins.\"\n\nSoundScan proclaimed Puff Daddy's No Way Out the third best-selling LP of 1997 - selling over 3.4 million copies in the U.S.\n\nLooking back on 1997, Puff Daddy told Rolling Stone: \"Statistically, this was one of the best years of my life, but personally, it was one of the worst...\"\n\nPuff Daddy topped the Billboard Rap Singles chart with \"It's All About The Benjamins / Been Around The World\" for 6 weeks and the Billboard Dance Music Maxi-Singles Sales chart for a week.\n\nReaders of Rolling Stone named Puff Daddy the Best Rap Artist of the Year and critics named him the Artist of the Year.
