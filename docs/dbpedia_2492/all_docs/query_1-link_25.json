        "text": "O’Ryan is opening up about his and Jhené Aiko’s relationship and why the two decided to part ways. Before the singer’s career took off, she was in a relationship with Omarion’s brother, O’Ryan. In a new interview, he revealed that after Jhené found out she was pregnant with their daughter Namiko Love Browner, their young age as well as other factors came to play as the two decided to no longer be in a romantic relationship.\n\n“We were very young,” O’Ryan shared on the Jst Us podcast. “We were in a relationship, like 18, 19. Very young love, and when she got pregnant, for me, I had to make a decision.”\n\nThe 35-year-old added that his father wasn’t present and that there were no positive male figures in his life as well.\n\n“I was afraid of messing up,” O’Ryan admitted. “I can’t be a good baby father and a good man. Haven’t seen it, for me, in my life, personally.” He essentially told Aiko that his focus was on being “the best father” for their baby girl. He also added that he wanted to support her and be a friend to her in any way he could but he didn’t want to act as if he could be in a fully committed relationship. He told the hosts that Aiko stayed with him during the entire pregnancy.\n\n“For me, I wanted to focus on what kind of father I was going to be… One thing at a time,” he said. “She was 20, I was 21 when Namiko was born. She was working really hard at her career, I was trying to figure things out for myself as well… I was really just supportive.”\n\nThe “None of Your Concern” singer welcomed her second baby with her longtime boyfriend rapper Big Sean. Their son Noah Hasani was born in November.\n\nJhené Aiko: Her 12 Best Songs, Ranked\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
