        "text": "theJasmineBRAND exclusively reports, Omarion is allegedly returning to reality TV. Sources tell us the 34-year-old singer will allegedly appear on the upcoming season of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood.\n\nOmarion and his then girlfriend/baby mama Apryl Jones appeared on the show together for seasons 1 and 2. Omarion has not appeared on the show since season 2.\n\nSources tell us that in addition to Omarion’s return, the entire R&B group B2K will allegedly appear on the show.\n\nThe group announced late last year that they had reunited and were kicking off a tour. The group includes Omarion, Lil’ Fizz, Raz-B and J-Boog.\n\nWith the exception of Raz-B, all the group members have appeared on the show in some capacity.\n\nWe’re told that the reality TV cameras have been documenting the tour and it’s likely that much of their alleged storyline will revolve around this.\n\nR&B group Pretty Ricky, who is currently touring with B2k, was featured on the most recent season of Love & Hip Hop: Miami.\n\nSources tell us that B2K will likely be filming in the same capacity.\n\nLove & Hip Hop: Hollywood is the third installment of the Love & Hip Hop reality television franchise. It premiered on September 15, 2014 on VH1 and chronicles the lives of several people in the Hollywood area, involved with hip hop music. The show features appearances from notable figures associated with West Coast hip hop.\n\nRecently, theJasmineBRAND broke the story that popular 90’s rapper YoYo will allegedly appear on the show.\n\nWe also broke the story that K.Michelle’s surrogate will also allegedly join the show. Click here for details.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about Omarion returning to Love & Hip Hop w/ B2k? Let us know in the comments.\n\nUpdate: A representative for Omarion says that the reports are false and Omarion will not be appearing on the upcoming season of Love and Hip Hop Hollywood."
