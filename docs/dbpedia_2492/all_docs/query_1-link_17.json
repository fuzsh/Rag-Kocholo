        "text": "American R&B singer and actor (born 1984)\n\nMusical artist\n\nOmari Ishmael Grandberry (born November 12, 1984), better known by his stage name Omarion, is an American R&B singer and actor. He rose to prominence as the lead vocalist of the boy band B2K, which was formed by Chris Stokes in 1998. The group achieved success in the early 2000s with the singles \"Gots ta Be\", \"Uh Huh\", \"Girlfriend\", and the Billboard Hot 100-number one hit \"Bump, Bump, Bump\" (featuring P. Diddy).\n\nAfter the group's 2004 disbandment, Omarion promptly embarked on a solo career. He signed with Epic Records to release his debut studio album, O (2005), which was led by the top 40 single of the same name, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and was nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. That same year, he guest featured on Bow Wow's single \"Let Me Hold You\", which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album, 21 (2006), became his second consecutive-number one album on the Billboard 200 and spawned the single \"Ice Box\", which peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting song as a lead artist. He then released his collaborative album with Bow Wow, Face Off (2007), and his third studio album, Ollusion (2010) to moderate commercial response.[2] He signed with Rick Ross' record label Maybach Music Group to release his fourth album, Sex Playlist (2014). It was preceded by the single \"Post to Be\" (featuring Chris Brown and Jhené Aiko), which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and received sextuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nOmarion has also ventured into acting, with appearances in films such as You Got Served, Fat Albert, Somebody Help Me and The Proud Family Movie. As a solo artist, he has received a BET Award, a Billboard Music Award, and a Soul Train Music Award.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\n1984–1998: Early life and career beginnings\n\n[edit]\n\nOmarion was born Omari Ishmael Grandberry on November 12, 1984, in Inglewood, California to Leslie Burrell and Trent Grandberry.
