        "text": "BIG Sean's former girlfriend and music mogul Jhené Aiko made her singing debut in 2002, featuring voices for B2K tunes.\n\nDespite welcoming a son together on November 8, 2022, the on-again, off-again couple have had a tumultuous relationship since they first started dating in 2016.\n\nHow many kids does Jhené Aiko have?\n\nBig Sean and Jhené Aiko have been together since 2016.\n\nIn July 2022, it was confirmed that the duo were expecting their first child together.\n\nAfter being spotted with Aiko's baby bump all over the web, Big Sean confirmed their pregnancy through Instagram on July 3, 2022.\n\n\"Very grateful God continues to bless us, Thank You,\" shared Big Sean through his story.\n\n\"Can’t wait to be a Dad.\"\n\nNoah Hasani was born on November 8, 2022.\n\nBig Sean also confirmed the news on his social media, posting a heartfelt tribute to his son.\n\n\"After 24 hours of Labor, A Lunar Eclipse, with rain from the beginning of labor til he was born, he’s here safe and sound,\" he captioned the post.\n\n\"Happy, Healthy and everything we could ever ask for and more.\"\n\n\"Any and everything for you Son,\" he wrote, alongside the boy's name in between blue heart emojis.\n\nAlthough it is Big Sean's first child, the baby boy is Aiko's second child.\n\nAiko had her first child, a daughter named Namiko Love Browner, on November 19, 2008, with American R&B singer O'Ryan.\n\n“I never intended to have a baby so young. But as soon as I found out I was pregnant, I was overwhelmed with a new focus and drive,\" shared Aiko with CR Fashionbook.\n\nI knew I didn’t want a regular job. I wanted to provide a life for me and my daughter that was beyond myself.\"\n\nWho is Jhené Aiko?\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Aiko is the sister of another R&B musician Mila J.\n\nAiko is an American R&B singer who debuted in 2002 through B2K music.\n\nEver since her debut, Aiko continued to release music and appear in various music videos, including with her ex-partner O'Ryan.\n\nThe R&B singer was nominated for many awards, including the 2015 GRAMMY Awards for Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\n\nShe won the NAACP Image Awards' Outstanding Album award in 2021 with her studio album Chilombo.\n\nOn February 13, 2022, Aiko also performed for the Super Bowl LVI with the song America the Beautiful.\n\nIn October 2023, less than one year after welcoming their son, Noah, Big Sean and Jhené Aiko sparked breakup rumors after the duo unfollowed one another from their social media accounts.\n\nDespite re-following each other soon after the initial unfollow, the couple have remained plagued by breakup rumors.\n\nSome fans have even speculated that Ariana Grande's new album, Eternal Sunshine, is a dig towards Aiko, who has a song with the same name from her 2014 album, Souled Out.\n\nGrande and Big Sean dated for around eight months between 2014 and 2015.\n\nWhat is Jhené Aiko's net worth?\n\nDue to her music career, Aiko has accumulated a net worth of approximately $6 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nShe purchased a $2.5 million Los Angeles house in 2020 before paying $3.4 million for another house in Encino, California in 2021.\n\nThe music star then listed the Encino home for $3.65 million around nine months after her big purchase.\n\nWhile Aiko has made some savvy real estate decisions, the majority of her net worth likely stems from her music career, including album sales, merchandise, endorsement deals, and touring.\n\nIn March 2024, Aiko announced that she would be going on tour in the summer of 2024, making 27 stops across the US.\n\nThe Magic Hour Tour marks Aiko's third time headlining a tour.\n\nShe previously headlined the Enter the Void Tour in 2014, and Trip (The Tour) in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAiko will likely sing tracks from her 2020 album, Chilombo, and from her collaborative album with Big Sean, Twenty88.\n\nIt is unknown whether her on-again, off-again boyfriend will join her on tour for any of the 27 dates."
