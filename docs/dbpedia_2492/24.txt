Omarion joins a short list of artists and former collaborators speaking out against R. Kelly after once working with the documented abuser. On Monday, he published a series of tweets about retiring the B2K songs ("Bump, Bump, Bump," "Girlfriend") written by Kelly following the iconic group’s reunion tour in Spring 2019.

“I haven’t seen but felt compelled to voice my position on this very serious issue since #rkelly has written songs for #B2K,” he tweeted. “EVERYONE has to be RESPONSIBLE. Many have bared witness to the unthinkable and yet have remained silent.”

He continues to explain that while fans will be disappointed if they don’t perform some of the iconic B2K songs on tour, the tracks will be retired after the shows.

While the tweets are well-meaning, they might come up short for those who would prefer Omarion and B2K not perform the songs at all in light of Surviving R. Kelly and the many decades-old reports about Kelly’s abuse of underaged black girls.

Many other celebrities have spoken out against R. Kelly, including Bun B, 6lack, and John Legend, as well as former collaborators like Chance the Rapper.

B2K announced its 2019 Millennium Tour in December. The group will be joined by other '00s R&B and hip-hop legends, including Mario, Ying Yang Twins, Lloyd, Pretty Ricky, and Chingy. As you can probably tell, this show is going to be jam-packed with nostalgia.
