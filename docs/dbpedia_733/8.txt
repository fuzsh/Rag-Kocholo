Motorstorm

MotorStorm is a 2006 racing video game developed by Evolution Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the Sony PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system.

I was responsible for designing and implementing a flexible next-gen character animation system for the PS3 title Motorstorm, using keyframed animation and ragdoll simulation. In addition, I also managed the entire pipeline, from exporters and conditioners to simulation and rendering.
