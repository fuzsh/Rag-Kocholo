What we do is pretty simple: we make visually and aurally breathtaking racing games in realistic environments with deep, satisfying handling and physics â€“ and we love it.[1]

Evolution Studios was a British video game developer best known for developing the MotorStorm franchise. The company was founded in 1999 by Martin Kenwright and Ian Hetherington. Prior to MotorStorm on the PlayStation 3, the studio made five PlayStation 2 games based on the FIA World Rally Championship.[2]

For the launch of the PlayStation 4, Evolution has developed the "first-person-racing" game Driveclub.[3], however it has been delayed due to being "taken back to the drawing board".

Evolution Studios was shut down March 22nd 2016.[4]
