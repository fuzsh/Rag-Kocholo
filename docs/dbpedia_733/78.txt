MotorStorm consists of two racing games for the PlayStation 3, developed by Evolution Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Both games feature high-resolution, realistic racing elements set in off-road locales. The first game, MotorStorm, took place in the desert, while the sequel, Pacific Rift is set in the jungle. The first game was released to generally good reviews, with its major criticism being an unfair AI due rubber-band mechanics and overly-aggressive driving styles at later stages.
