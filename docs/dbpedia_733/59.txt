MotorStorm (PS3)

Developed by Evolution Studios, MotorStorm is a brutal, no-holds-barred offroad racing game created exclusively for the PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system.

Set in the fictitious desert environment of Monument Valley, MotorStorm takes full advantage of the processing power of the PlayStation 3 to deliver an extreme racing event where the goal is to not only win, but to survive.

In the game, players will descend upon the MotorStorm Festival, a celebration of the alternative and extreme offroad racing culture.

Throwing caution to the wind, players will take on a variety of racing fanatics and battle through chaotic, action-packed tracks to try and become the Festival champ.

Capitalizing on its pedigree in offroad racing, Evolution Studios has created a true next-generation gameplay experience that features smarter artificial intelligence (AI), real-time track deformation, fully destructible vehicles and environments, and stunningly detailed scenery.

Tapping into the power of the PlayStation 3, MotorStorm will showcase cinematic effects such as motion blur, depth-of-field, and Hollywood-style crash cams that replay spectacular crash sequences during a race.
