        "text": "Sony is shutting down its UK-based video game developer Evolution Studios, according to a statement given to GamesIndustry.biz. Evolution, best known for its PlayStation 3 off-road racing video-game franchise “Motorstorm,” was most recently responsible for the troubled PlayStation 4 title “Driveclub.”\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft Isn't Saying Why It's Closing One Of Its Biggest Video Game Studios\n\nThe news of the closure was confirmed by “Driveclub” director Paul Rustchynsky on Twitter.\n\nPlanned to launch alongside the PlayStation 4 in 2013 and announced as a title that would be included with the platform’s PlayStation Plus subscription, “Driveclub” was delayed repeatedly to late 2014. A feature-limited version of the game was released for PlayStation Plus in June 2015. A virtual-reality edition of “Driveclub” is planned for the upcoming PlayStation VR headset, and has been publicly demonstrated in recent months at events like the PlayStation Experience and Game Developers Conference.\n\nAlso Read: 'Wildstar'-Developer Carbine Studios Cuts Staff\n\n“We have reviewed and assessed all current projects and plans for the short and medium term and have decided to make some changes to the European studios structure,” the statement read. “As a result, it has been decided that Evolution Studio will close.\n\n“It is regrettable that this decision will lead to compulsory redundancies. We accept that this decision will mean that we risk losing high calibre staff but by focusing on other Studios that already have exciting new projects in development we believe we will be in a stronger position going forward and able to offer the best possible content of the highest quality for our consumers.”\n\nEvolution Studios was founded in 1999 and acquired by Sony in 2007. In addition to “Driveclub” and its four “Motorstorm” titles for the PlayStation 3, Evolution also produced five “World Rally Championship” racing games for the PlayStation 2. The partnership with Sony was a smooth fit, as the studio’s games had only been released on PlayStation consoles.\n\nTheWrap has reached out to Sony for comment on the future of “Driveclub” post-Evolution.\n\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n\nPlayStation 'Willing to Have the Conversation' About Online Play With Xbox Live\n\nSony Planning More Powerful Version of PlayStation 4 (Report)"
