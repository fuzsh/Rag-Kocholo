        "text": "10 days until Sony's eagerly awaited event in which the company is expected to officially reveal the PlayStation 4. Well, technically only nine now, but at the time of this very cryptic tweet by Evolution Studios' Paul Rustchynsky there were 10.\n\nOver the weekend, Rustchynsky, the game director of MotorStorm RC, posted a tweet which read: \"10 days!\" Given the context of the tweet, with the Sony event just 10 days away at the time of the post, it's safe to assume the two are somehow related (although he cleverly points out the 10 days can be related to anything -- like getting his car serviced). But what can it be?\n\nThe easiest guess is a new MotorStorm game for the PlayStation 4. Evolution Studios is currently looking to fill several positions within the company. Although none of them reference a racing game, the LinkedIn profile of studio design director Simon Barlow reveals he's \"driving the creative vision for an unannounced AAA first-party exclusive.\" It certainly sounds like it could be MotorStorm 4.\n\nEither way, it sure looks like the PlayStation developers are having some fun with the whole PlayStation future event.
