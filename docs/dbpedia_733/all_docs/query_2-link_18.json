It was released on the PlayStation Portable on September 18, 2009 in Europe, September 29, 2009 in North America and it will be released on November 1, 2009 in Japan and later on the PlayStation 2 in October 2009. Unlike previous games in the series, the game is being developed by Bigbig Studios and will be the first game in the series not to be released on the PlayStation 3.\n\nEuropean cover art.\n\nGameplay[edit | edit source]\n\nThe game once again moves away from the desert environments of the original title and the lush island environment of the sequel and relocates itself to the harsh Arctic climate of Alaska. Gameplay is similar to that of previous titles in the series such as Nitrous Boosts, environmental hazards and destructible environments. Unlike the previous titles in the series, the game only features up to a maximum of eight racers in each race.\n\nTable of Contents"
