It took decades of trial and error by creative thinkers, tech experts, and designers to create the video games you know and love. Considering being a part of this ever-growing industry? Here are some intriguing facts that are sure to pull you in.\n\n1) There are over 2,000 video game design schools worldwide\n\nIf you're interested in a career in video game design, there are now more options than ever before. With over 2,000 video game design schools located worldwide, aspiring designers have a wealth of educational resources available to them. From online courses to traditional four-year college programs, there are plenty of ways to learn the skills necessary to become a successful game designer. The video game industry has experienced significant growth over the past few decades — this growth has created a demand for educational resources around the globe.\n\nFor those looking to further their education, the online graduate certificate in Game Design and Interactivity Essentials from NJIT can help you become a talented video game designer who can create engaging and innovative game experiences. With so many options available, there has never been a better time to pursue a career in video game design.\n\n2) The first ever video game was created in 1958\n\nThe very first video game was called \"Tennis for Two\" and was created in 1958 by physicist William Higinbotham. It was a simple two-player game that simulated a tennis match using an oscilloscope, which was a type of electronic instrument used for displaying and analyzing waveforms. Players used knobs to control the position of their paddles on the screen and hit a dot (representing a ball) back and forth over a virtual net. While it was a simple game, it was groundbreaking in that it demonstrated the potential of electronic games and paved the way for the development of the video game industry as you know it today.\n\n3) The most popular video game genres are action, sports, adventure, and role-playing\n\nThe video game industry offers a wide variety of genres to suit every gamer's preferences. Among the most popular video game genres are action, sports, adventure, and role-playing games. Action games are characterized by fast-paced gameplay, thrilling combat, and intense moments of suspense. Sports games, on the other hand, simulate real-world sports, such as football, basketball, or soccer, and allow players to compete against each other. Adventure games offer immersive storytelling and exploration of vast, imaginative worlds. Finally, role-playing games feature complex character development, rich storylines, and strategic combat. Whether you're a fan of intense action, sports competition, exploration, or storytelling, these popular genres have something for everyone.\n\n4) The average age of a video game designer is between 30-40\n\nIt's never too late to pursue a career in video game design. While the average age of a video game designer is between 30-40 years old, many don't start out as designers right away. You may have a background in any field such as computer science, graphic design, psychology or even fine arts. That doesn't mean you can't become a successful video game designer.\n\nIf you are looking for an entry-level opportunity, consider getting an online graduate certificate in Game Design and Interactivity Essentials from NJIT. This program will give you the basic fundamentals of designing and developing interactive experiences. With this education, you can develop the skills needed to flourish in your career as a video game designer.\n\n5) The average salary for a video game designer is $85,000\n\nThe average salary for a video game designer varies depending on several factors, including experience, location, and company size. According to Glassdoor, the average salary for a video game designer in the United States is around $85,000 per year. However, entry-level designers can expect to earn closer to $50,000, while those with more experience or who work for larger companies can earn upwards of $100,000 per year. If you’re interested in becoming a game designer who specialize in certain areas, such as mobile or VR game design, you may earn a different salary than those who work on traditional console or PC games.\n\n6) The video game industry is worth over $100 billion\n\nAs of 2022, the video game industry is estimated to be worth around $184 billion. The industry has experienced significant growth over the years, with the rise of mobile gaming, esports, and the increasing popularity of streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. The industry is expected to continue its growth trajectory in the coming years, driven by the launch of new gaming consoles, advancements in technology such as virtual and augmented reality, and the increasing demand for immersive gaming experiences. The video game industry is now one of the most valuable entertainment industries in the world, making the demand for creative video game designers that much higher.\n\n7) The first ever commercial video game wasn’t a hit\n\nThe first-ever commercial video game was \"Computer Space,\" developed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney and released in 1971. Computer Space was a space combat arcade game that challenged players to pilot a spaceship and destroy enemy saucers while avoiding incoming fire. Although Computer Space was technologically advanced for its time, its complex controls and difficulty level made it hard for players to grasp.\n\nWhile it was not a commercial success, it laid the foundation for the future of the video game industry. A year later, Bushnell and Dabney founded Atari and released their second game, \"Pong,\" which became a massive hit and helped establish video games as a popular form of entertainment.\n\nThe longest running video game franchise/series is the iconic \"Super Mario\" series, created by Nintendo in 1985. The franchise features the adventures of Mario, a plumber who must rescue Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser in a series of platforming games. Over the years, the franchise has grown to include numerous spin-offs, merchandise, and even a movie.\n\nThe Super Mario franchise has become an integral part of pop culture, with its characters and music recognized around the world. As of 2021, the franchise has sold over 700 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time. The series continues to innovate and evolve with new games and experiences for fans to enjoy, cementing its status as a true gaming icon.\n\n9) The best selling video game of all time is Minecraft\n\nEver since its release in 2011, Minecraft has taken the world by storm. This sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios has sold over 200 million copies across various platforms including PC, mobile devices, and gaming consoles. The game allows players to explore a blocky 3D world, mine resources, and craft various items. It also features survival and creative modes, enabling players to customize their gameplay experience.\n\nMinecraft’s success has inspired many game designers and developers to focus on open-world gameplay and player-driven experiences. Minecraft's unique approach to game design, which emphasizes exploration, creativity, and user-generated content, has also influenced the development of other popular games, such as Roblox and Terraria.\n\nMinecraft has also helped to popularize the concept of \"early access\" games, where developers release unfinished games to the public for feedback and testing. This approach has become increasingly common in the industry, as it allows developers to engage with their audience and make improvements based on player feedback.\n\nBe a part of the future of video game design with NJIT\n\nPursuing a career in video game design has become increasingly popular as the industry continues to grow.
