        "text": "History of the MotorStorm Series\n\nMotorStorm is another beloved PlayStation Series. The MotorStorm Series were off-road racing games featuring different types of vehicles with their own strengths and weaknesses and tracks with different terrains which may either hinder the vehicles’ handling or improve it. Sadly like Sly Cooper, MotorStorm is another PlayStation Series that has been absent for a while. Sadly as well, Evolution Studios the Studio that made MotorStorm was shut down in March 2016. The most recent MotorStorm game we got was MotorStorm RC for PS3 and PS Vita in March 2012. Since then theStrom has passed. There is some good news though! MotorStorm could be making a return soon as new game has been rumored for a while. I think in 2023 we will get the announcement of the next MotorStorm game. The next huge PlayStation Showcase is rumored to be coming before June 2023. Maybe we will see the next MotorStorm game there. A MotorStorm Remastered Collection alongside the next MotorStorm game would be nice.\n\nHere’s a list of the series:\n\nMotorStorm (2007)\n\nPlatform: PS3\n\nRelease Date: March 6, 2007\n\nGenre: Racing\n\nA racing festival is taking place in the desert.

A massive earthquake has hit the location offering an off-road experience and compared to the previous games it puts more emphasis on the storyline.\n\nMotorStorm RC (2012)\n\nPlatform: PS3 & PS Vita\n\nRelease Date: March 6, 2012\n\nGenre: Racing\n\nMotorStorm: RC is the fifth game in the racing series.
