Well, they're ready to talk about some of the projects they're got baking in the oven. That's no throwaway metaphor either, as one of Starship's upcoming IPs is CyberCook, a \"next-gen eco-system for cookery.\"\n\n\"There has been no major step change in the evolution of consumer cooking experiences in over 20 years,\" Kenwright said in a press release. \"The 19th century had cookery books, 20th century had TV, analogue media and live shows. Direct to consumer has come of age, with mass technology ownership allowing us to move beyond existing channels into a brave new world called CyberCook. It's an experience second only to real cooking, a genuine game-changing platform with infinite opportunities for collaboration, partnerships and social media.\"\n\nAlso on Starship's plate (haa) is Playworld, a mobile game designed for children ages five and up. No gameplay details or screenshots were shared, but Kenwright said the game is designed to \"empower kids' creativity.\" Both Playworld and CyberCook are expected to reach smartphones and tablets in Q4 2014.\n\nIf all of this feels like too much of a departure from Kenwright's racing game history - along with creating MotorStorm, Kenwright founded Driveclub developer Evolution Studios - don't fret too much; Starship is also eyeing the growing sector of virtual reality with keen interest. \"We're thinking about returning to our roots with a wicked twist,\" Kenwright said. \"Original, made-for-VR propositions are on the way. It's truly a case of 'watch this space.'\"\n\nOh, we'll be watching alright. Right after we cook that delicious-looking dish.\n[Image: Starship]",
