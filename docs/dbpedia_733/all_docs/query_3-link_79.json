        "text": "Understanding Players\n\nPlayers are not only customers but also fans. We listen to what our fans want and keep them constantly up to date with what we are working on. We create a bond with the fans of the game that fosters trust and understanding.\n\nExpert Analysis\n\nWe couple our vast experience in free to play design and operations with data analysis to find new opportunities to grow and improve the game. We come to understand whatâs working and what is not to inform how we manage the game.\n\nFlexible Development\n\n5 year old spaghetti code base with no documentation? Itâs all good. Weâve worked on projects making millions a month with infrastructure held together with duct tape. Weâve seen it all and know how to prevent issues and respond to all situations. We tame the chaos to ensure there are regular content updates, bug-fixes and balancing changes.\n\nDo you have what we are looking for?\n\nHumble\n\nRockstars and ninjaâs are nice, but we expect our team to be humble.\n\nLoves a challenge\n\nWe are looking for people who like to be challenged and find excitement in solving problems big and small.\n\nTakes Ownership\n\nWe expect all employees to take ownership for their work, the success of the their projects, and for taking part in making the company successful and a great place to work. Everyone should feel a sense of responsibility to do the right thing to help the company.\n\nSmarter not harder\n\nWe believe in working smarter instead of harder. By looking ahead and avoiding pitfalls we avoid mistakes and wasted effort to create a direct path to our goals.\n\nSelfless\n\nYou seek whatâs best for DECA rather than what is best for yourself or group. You take the time to help colleagues and the community.\n\nOpenness\n\nYou are open to and actively seek to digest otherâs opinions to make significant decisions. You actively debate approach and decisions. You challenge what does not make sense, but also accept that there can be differing opinions."
