        "text": "Sony has shut down Evolution Studios, the developer behind franchises such as MotorStorm and DriveClub.\n\nThe most recent game developed by Evolution Studios was DriveClub, and was an incredibly troubled project with multiple delays and online problems. 55 People were cut from Evolution just a year ago.\n\nSony said that it would try to reallocate some of the Evolution team to other studios. A statement from Sony was made below, as reported by Polygon:\n\nRegular reviews take place throughout SCE Worldwide Studios, ensuring that the resources that we have in such a competitive landscape can create and produce high quality, innovative and commercially viable projects.\n\nAs part of this process we have reviewed and assessed all current projects and plans for the short and medium term and have decided to make some changes to the European studios structure.\n\nAs a result, it has been decided that Evolution Studio will close.\n\nIt is regrettable that this decision will lead to compulsory redundancies. We accept that this decision will mean that we risk losing high calibre staff but by focusing on other Studios that already have exciting new projects in development we believe we will be in a stronger position going forward and able to offer the best possible content of the highest quality for our consumers.\n\nThe report goes on to assure readers that the studio is working hard to reallocate their staff to other projects within the industry.\n\nWhat do you think about Evolution Studios shutting down? Were you a fan of MotorStorm or DriveClub? Let us know in the comments below!"
