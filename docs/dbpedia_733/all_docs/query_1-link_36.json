        "text": "Founder and previous Managing Director of Bigbig Studios, Jonathan draws on more than 23 years of game development experience with a background in studio management, production, design and programming. Awarded New European Studio of the Year in 2002, Bigbig created a number of AAA titles for Sonyâs PlayStation Portable and was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2007 where it moved into development of several leading PlayStation Vita titles, all under Jonathanâs guidance and leadership.\n\nTechnical Director with over 23 years experience, Ben has held senior positions within a number of top companies including Codemasters and Sony and has significantly contributed to the success of numerous AAA titles. In addition to his passion for coding and his strong academic background in Mathematics, his vast knowledge of multiple platforms, ranging from DirectX to PlayStation 3, have all been integral in shaping the early design stages of PlayStation Vitaâs software systems and the overall success of Bigbig studios.\n\nWith 28 years experience in senior Technical Art roles, Chris has worked for some of the top UK game studios: Rare, Codemasters, Sony and SEGA. Starting on the Super Nintendo he has developed games for almost every gaming platform to date and has worked on landmark titles such as Donkey Kong Country, Banjo Kazooie, the ToCA racing series and Motorstorm.\n\nCombining his excellent art skills, experience and technical knowledge, Chris is the perfect bridge between the Art and Programming disciplines.\n\nIt is with great sadness that after a short illness, Ian passed away at the end of 2021. Ian had been with Midoki since its inception in 2011 and had played a key role in the company's success. As an acknowledgement of his time with us and with respect we have chosen to leave his biography in place.\n\nIan Hetherington has been instrumental in the start up of many of the defining businesses in entertainment technology. In 1985 he founded the iconic games company Psygnosis which in 1991 published Lemmings. 2 years later, having sold to Sony, Ian was appointed Managing Director of SCEE the \"Playstation Company\", building a team to over 650.\n\nSignificantly, this period also saw him commissioning and overseeing the production of numerous independent software products, including Travellers Tales (Lego games), Reflections (Driver series), DMA (originators of Lemmings and Grand Theft Auto) and Bizarre Creations (Project Gotham) â all of whom have eventually been acquired by world leading names in entertainment.\n\nMore recently, Ian has continued to play a key role in pioneering video games and technology through investments in Evolution Studios (Motorstorm), BigBig Studios (Pursuit Force) and Realtime Worlds (Crackdown)."
