        "text": "http://kotaku.com/5159408/littlebigplanet-rock-band-assassins-creed-coming-to-psp\n\nHot from this week's annual Destination Playstation meeting comes news of LittleBigPlanet, Rock Band and Assassin's Creed for the Playstation Portable.\n\nRock Band Unplugged will include Wi-Fi support and a \"fully-featured in-game store\" for downloadable content in the North American and Europeans markets.\n\nThis fall will see the release of MotorStorm Arctic Edge and LittleBigPlanet for the PSP. These titles will be built from the ground up for PSP:\n\nLittleBigPlanet — Developed in conjunction with MediaMolecule, the critically acclaimed game LittleBigPlanet makes its way to the PSP, offering new SackBoy(TM) adventures with the same play, create, share experience for gamers on-the-go, in addition to brand new levels and environments specifically created for the platform.\n\nMotorStorm Arctic Edge — Developed by the award-winning Bigbig Studios, the team behind the best-selling Pursuit Force series, MotorStorm Arctic Edge sees the music, the festival and the brutal off-road racing arrive in the breathtaking yet lethal and unpredictable setting of Alaska. The game is also expected to hit the PlayStation 2 platform in Fall of 2009.\n\nMadden NFL 10 will enable NFL fans to build their own formations and plays from scratch on the PSP. Then, through connectivity with the PS3, the plays can be downloaded and perfected on the console. In addition, Madden NFL 10 will deliver a faster and more \"PSP-friendly\" gameplay experience to adapt to the PSP owner's lifestyle.\n\nTiger Woods PGA TOUR10 will allow gamers to experience the drama of major golf tournaments with revamped gameplay modes for on and offline play.\n\nSquare Enix's DISSIDIA FINAL FANTASY, which has sold 850,000 units since launching before the holidays in Japan, will make its way to North America this summer.\n\nAll we know about Assassin's Creed for the PSP is that Ubisoft will debut an exclusive installment of the franchise later this year.\n\nI'm not sure what to expect out of portable Rock Band, but I'm interested in the other big three games.\n\nEdit: Joystiq has this bit of info on Rock Band Unplugged:\n\nUpdate: Primotech has some possible gameplay details. According to their writeup, Unplugged will use the left, up, triangle, and circle buttons to control instruments, switching from instrument to instrument with the shoulder buttons, and playing \"phrases\" of each instrument to maintain a score multiplier. This sounds exactly like Harmonix's Frequency!\n\nGreat news if true.\n\nAssassin's Creed will be getting its own bundle this fall.\n\nI think the Hannah Montana PSP Entertainment Pack is a great idea - the PSP really needs to reach out and between the purple PSP and LBP it looks like they are at least looking at the path and getting ready to go down it. I know I will be getting my daughter the HM PSP.\n\nI am also happy they have something bigger than a 1gb card in-pack. It should be at 4gb, but 2 is better than 1."
