        "text": "Evolution Studios, the developer behind MotorStorm and DriveClub, has a new home: Codemasters. The maker of Dirt and Formula 1 racing games is adding the Evolution Studios team to its ranks, three weeks after Sony announced plans to shutter Evolution Studios.\n\nCodemasters announced the acquisition in a post on its website today, indicating that the entirety of the Evolution Studios team was making the jump to Codemasters.\n\n\"The success of F1 2015 and DiRT Rally over the last 12 months has re-positioned the company for growth,\" said Codemasters CEO Frank Sagnier in a statement. \"The addition of the Evolution team to our studio group will allow us to scale our business and strengthen our leadership as the world's premier racing game developer. I'm thrilled to have Mick Hocking join Codemasters as VP of Product Development. His experience in building AAA IP and leading great teams made him a natural choice to head the development of all of our products. I am equally thrilled to welcome his talented team to the Codemasters family and I look forward to the great games and brand new IP we will develop together.\"\n\nHocking, who was previously studio director at Evolution Studios, said his team will be supporting Codemasters on existing brands in addition to developing new titles.\n\n\"I'm delighted to be joining Codemasters at such an exciting time in the company's growth,\" Hocking said in a statement. \"We have a shared passion for racing, a desire to innovate and a determination to create the best racing games and build the biggest racing community in the market. I'm very much looking forward to working with so many of the world's greatest racing developers, on new IP as well as exciting franchises including DiRT, GRID, Micro Machines and the Formula One games.\""
