        "text": "In the battle for your dollars in the run up to the holiday season, two off-road racers are going to be vying for your attention – Pure and MotorStorm: Pacific Rift. Both titles are similar in premise on the surface; lots of jumps, branching paths, verdant settings with sweeping vistas and solid multiplayer components too. But that's where the two games begin to diverge. MotorStorm is about vehicular variety and high speed deconstruction. Pure is, as the name suggests, singularly dedicated to ATVs and has a deep tricks mechanic, almost in the tradition of SSX.\n\nRead on as we compare and contrast Pure and MotorStorm: Pacific Rift. Which one will rev your engine later this year?\n\nCourses and Terrain\n\nThe first MotorStorm was a desert rally racer, with eight tracks and a punishing emphasis on high and low-ground routes. For what it lacked in variety of terrain, it made up for in style and some spectacular lighting and design work. Pacific Rift is all about island racing. What does that mean? Within its 16 tracks, you're looking at thick jungles, cliff-faces, waterfalls, rivers, beaches, villages and blue skies. From what we've played, waterlogged routes now become essential points of strategy for well-timed engine cool-downs.\n\nJust as in the first game, there are routes that are optimised for powerhouse heavy vehicles and nimble bikes and quads. Location variety also takes advantage of all the diversity the island location affords. So far we've only seen a handful of stages – one that tossed us into the thick of the jungle, with dangling vines, forking, tree-lined runs and rapid rivers, and the other with long stretches of curved, rocky valley walls. There are beach runs and village routes coming too.\n\nPure, on the other hand, mixes it up far more, taking a world-tour approach to locations. All told, there are 7 locations in Pure – just over half the number in Pacific Rift, but with far greater variety - 36 tracks in total, in fact. We've already seen Italian village paths that branch out over cliff edges and into massive jumps that cause the camera to pull right back so you can take in the staggering view. Then there are the dry, arid desert runs of New Mexico, which are reminiscent of MotorStorm, in fact.\n\nWe've also seen the wooded Wyoming forests, filled with pine trees, bridges and obstacles to avoid; the sky dotted with hot air balloons. So far, fairly par for the course. But then there are Greek-style mountainsides with a scattering of ruins and man-made wonders too. With fewer courses but a greater emphasis on visual variety, gamers might be split on which should take precedence.\n\nVehicles and Physics\n\nMotorStorm: Pacific Rift, like its predecessor, is unabashedly difficult to master. Part of that is because the game requires you to familiarise yourself with the handling and characteristics of so many classes of vehicles in different combinations for many events throughout the game.\n\nLiterally the biggest new addition to the lineup is the monster truck - four enormous wheels on a standard truck body, designed to tackle mud and unsealed surfaces with ease. The flipside is, taking corners is a hell of a task and it's not the fastest beast in the race. Such is the give/take relationship between size, weight and speed that underpins the mechanics in Pacific Rift. The game also has its share of unlockable, incrementally improved vehicle versions too.\n\nPure, however, sticks with ATVs – which in itself sounds like a negative point when you stack it up next to Pacific Rift. There is, however, a hidden level of depth to the ATV-only game that you might not know about - customisation.\n\nOne major point of difference between the two titles is Pure's dedication to the intricacies of ATV construction – as demonstrated in the exploded view of the vehicle that can be built from the frame upwards, bit by bit, from literally thousands of different parts, brands, colours and tweaks. There's an auto-assemble option too that selects the best parts from the ones you've unlocked, taking the complexity out of balancing the stats that define your ATV's abilities.\n\nThe Variety Factor\n\nNeither game can claim to be a straight-shot of distilled racing. MotorStorm: Pacific Rift places more emphasis than ever in offensive manoeuvres – sideswiping your smaller competitors with heavy-duty steel or literally punching at them with a tap of a shoulder-button. A tactically-timed attack can be enough to send bike and quad riders into the wild and buy you some valuable time. The game also features customisable soundtracks and confirmed trophy support, for that added cherry or two on top. The whole attitude behind the game – a festival atmosphere – is still there, though you'd be forgiven for thinking that's an element that really just serves to get hot tunes and cool kids onboard the franchise.\n\nPure, which may well be a pure ATV experience, is anything but a straight-up racer too. More akin to SSX or Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam in part, Pure has a serious slant towards stunts – which immediately nudges the game towards the 'extreme' side of the sports category. If you want more boost, you're going to have to master three tiers of tricks, each of which must be unlocked sequentially during a race; from simplistic movements to full-body, ATV-swinging, pelvic thrusting, neck-snapping aerial tricks. It's a key feature, and one that Blackrock Studios has been careful to implement. Learning to tweak the amount of height you leap to off each peak becomes second nature – and more importantly, feels rock-solid and not just a tacked-on 'me too' addition.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nIn the all-important social gaming side of things, both MotorStorm: Pacific Rift and Pure feature in-depth provisions for multiplayer – but with some key differences. Firstly, Pacific Rift is including a split-screen multiplayer mode for up to four players and we can attest to the fact that there's very little discernable drop in detail and frame rate when there are two players. Online is where the meat is, however. At this stage, we haven't seen the online component detailed to any great degree, but the team has promised 16 racers at once in a race (though they were shooting for 20 once upon a time), which should make for a lot of jostling and carnage. The lack of custom characters, or in fact any personalities in the game, is curious. A little more customisation in this area wouldn't go astray.\n\nNot to be left in the dust, Pure features 16 player online multiplayer too – the big difference being that all three single-player modes (Trick, Freestyle and Sprint) are also available for up to 16 players online. The Trick mode is particularly well-suited to online multiplayer, given how essential the tricking mechanic is to racing. With 70 tricks in the bag, hopefully these won't go stale too quickly. Our only gripe at this stage is a lack of unique characters to choose from – about 7, plus costume variants. We'd love to see a full 16 selectable or provisions for custom characters to make the multiplayer bouts that much more personal.\n\nHead to Head\n\nEven though we're sure both developers don't particularly like being compared with each other's products, the process is virtually inevitable, given the release timeframes for both games. At this stage, Pure is out on October 9 in Australia and MotorStorm: Pacific Rift has a similar, if fluffy, 'Spring 2008' release date down under. That puts both titles in each others' backyards.\n\nSo which game is right for you? Given that Pure is the only multi-format title of the two, it'll be your only choice if you're a PC or 360 gamer. However, the PS3 owners out there need to weigh up a few things. One, Pure is all about ATVs, stunts and jumps as much as racing through the turns at neck-shattering speed. If you've played ATV games, have a penchant for stunt-racers like SSX or need a worldwide locale to keep your eyelids open, Pure is the game for you.\n\nMotorStorm: Pacific Rift looked rough three months back; now it's flying towards the finish gates with a great deal more polish. If you're a fan of the first game, you won't experience much of an initial departure outside of water-cooling and the multiplayer improvements. That's largely a good thing. If you demand vehicular variety and bump-mapped mud, plus the veil of 'beach party vibes' over the top of your menus, MotorStorm has you covered."
