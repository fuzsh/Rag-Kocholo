        "meta_description": "MotorStorm's next mission is battling the frozen wasteland of Alaska's Arctic Edge. MotorStorm Arctic Edge delivers brutal off-road racing in the beautiful yet lethal and unpredictable setting of Alaska. With temperatures plummeting, sudden avalanches, broken ice bridges, and three different racing altitudes, Arcitc Edge is the most inhospitable environment in the franchise's history. In addition to the six vehicle classes from the original MotorStorm, two new vehicles (the Snowcat and Snow Machine) have been introduced to combat the ice, the cold and the snow. One has the power and size to blast through packed snow, while the other has the grip and pace to combat most of what the sub-zero conditions can throw at it. MotorStorm Arctic Edge is fit for single player action, online multiplayer or playing with friends; two to eight players can compete against each other wirelessly via Ad Hoc Mode on PSP. Alternatively, you can also compete via online multiplayer using Infrastructure Mode on PSP to make it to the summit of the online global leaderboards.",
