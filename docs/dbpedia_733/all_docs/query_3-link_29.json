        "text": "The Evolution of Video Games into Art\n\nVideo games have come a long way since their early days as simple pixelated games. Today’s video game industry is big business, with high-budget, high-profile AAA games typically produced by major publishers. Developing these big-name games can take around four years and cost over $80 million.\n\nAs gaming technology has advanced, so too has developers’ artistic abilities. Talented creators in the industry are highly skilled artisans who have honed their specialties. Some may be considered commercial artists, working within an established franchise or movie universe.\n\nMany modern video games are now considered works of art, featuring beautiful graphics and complex narratives. Some argue games are evolving from nostalgic novelties into art history. Whether you agree or not, games are increasingly recognized as art, not just entertainment.\n\nThis is evident in art’s influence on game design – from scene lighting to 3D modeling and animation. Stories and plots also draw inspiration from classic art and literature. As games continue to evolve, their status as art will likely grow.\n\nAre Video Games Art? – It is Becoming Harder to Deny\n\nIn the past decade, video games have become a much more mainstream form of media. Whether its films, music, television shows, or comic books, digital technology has revolutionised the world of entertainment. While films, music, and television have always been popular, video games have remained distinctive in their aesthetic space from the rest of the media world.\n\nSome prominent critics were doubtful, including Roger Ebert, a notable American cinema critic, film historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was critical of not only the resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he saw as unrealistic and obtrusive, but also of video games.\n\nIn 2005, Ebert stated that video games are not art and are inferior to media developed through authorial control, such as film and literature, noting, “video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful,” but “the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art.”\n\nThis sparked a backlash from video game fans, including novelist Clive Barker, who defended video games as an art form.\n\nVideo games, as an art form that has only existed in the digital realm, are truly a synthesis of art and science. However, the game industry applies many traditional forms of artistic expression, such as:\n\ntraditional artwork;\n\ntraditional animation, in addition to:\n\ndigitisation of analog data sources into digital files;\n\nRotoscoping a technique used by animators to trace over motion picture footage frame by frame to create realistic action;\n\nmotion capture animation;\n\nnarrative arcs;\n\ndynamic music;\n\n3D modelling and sculpting.\n\nThis combination of the techniques above results in producing something that transcends any single genre. In many ways, I view video games as the most powerful form of conceptual art, in which the concept or idea involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns.\n\nThe Aesthetic of Video Games\n\nVideo games are an art form, and one that has developed significantly over the years. From the first arcade machines to the wildly popular mobile gaming apps, video games have come a long way since the first Pong was released in the early 1970s.\n\nThe aesthetics of early video games were a product of technology. Contemporary games, on the other hand, are based on a conscious choice of art style, enabled by powerful graphic processing units (GPU), which trick our eyes with ever realistic and immersive graphics.\n\nToday, there are hundreds of video games being developed and released every year, each with a different story, setting, or theme. However, while video games are evolving, they are still heavily influenced by the medium’s history. Throughout the evolution of video games, their design has been influenced by everything from film to architecture.\n\nThe Psychology of Video Games\n\nIn our increasingly computer-obsessed world, video games have become one of the most popular forms of media. If you consider yourself a gamer, you undoubtedly spend hours upon hours in front of your screen. Just one more go, frantically bouncing between levels and attempting to beat your previous high score.\n\nThis is almost certainly a common experience, whether you are an avid player or a casual observer. Nevertheless, why do we love games so much? Moreover, what are they doing to us?\n\nWhy We Love Them\n\nVideo games have become more than just a hobby for many players. They are an outlet for inspiration, a break from reality, and a way to escape their everyday lives. Whether it is an escape from the real world or an opportunity to explore new cultures and ideas, video games offer a unique experience that should not be overlooked.\n\nMany gamers obsessively replay old simulators and adventure games, just as you might do with an old book or a song whose lyrics are familiar from their childhood.\n\nVideo games can be viewed as both nostalgic and modern objects for the generation(s) that grew up with them. In addition, as vehicles for nostalgia since they are a medium that can elicit memories of the past.\n\nAccording to prominent video game scholars, “video games give a unique setting within which to investigate nostalgia because they hold connotations with childhood, technology, and technological change, as well as the effect of preceding forms of media.”\n\nAdditionally, games are more immediate and personal than other forms of entertainment due to their immersion factor. Players remember when they defeat the bad guy, not when they see a movie about a hero defeating the bad guy.\n\nWell-Being\n\nVideo games have been around for a while, and they are not going anywhere. In fact, they are becoming more and more popular with each passing year. Nevertheless, what are the implications of this?\n\nThis question has puzzled many psychologists, sociologists, and parents alike. In order to gain a better understanding of how video games affect our well-being, we can explore a few theories. Past research suggests people whose psychological needs were not being met in the “real world” might report negative well-being from play.\n\nExcessive video game play is now recognised as an addiction disorder by the World Health Organization, though the criteria does not include a specific number of hours spent playing.\n\nInstead, the description is of someone who is unable to stop playing despite the fact that it interferes with other aspects of their life, such as family relationships, school, work, and sleep. Fortunately in most cases, these problems would need to last at least a year before being diagnosed.\n\nWhat Video Games Are Doing to Us\n\nVideo games have long been a part of our lives, and people are playing them more than ever. They provide us with entertainment and a way to escape reality, but many people are concerned that this activity is harmful.\n\nMany previous studies have attempted to demonstrate how video games affect our mental health and well-being, but they rely on self-reported play behaviour. Furthermore, these studies frequently lacked adequate data to determine whether these concerns were justified.\n\nIn 2021, Oxford University published a report in collaboration with Electronic Arts and Nintendo of America. This study obtained actual play behaviour from players for the following games:\n\nPlants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons\n\nGamers were polled about their overall well-being, motivations, and need for satisfaction while playing, and their responses were combined with telemetry data. The study discovered a small positive relationship between game play and affective well-being, contrary to popular belief. Need satisfaction and motivations during play did not interact with playtime, but were instead related to well-being independently.\n\nThe study demonstrated that collaborations with industry partners could be carried out in an ethical and transparent manner while upholding high academic standards. Furthermore, the study provided policymakers with much-needed evidence about the relationship between play and mental health.\n\nWhat Psychological Impact Do Games Have on Their Players?\n\nVideo games have always been a contentious subject. Many people believe that video games are harmful to your health, while others believe that they can be beneficial and even therapeutic. The psychological short- or long-term effects of video games on their players, on the other hand, are still not fully understood.\n\nNot only can video games provide a reprieve from the daily grind, but they have also been shown to boost cognitive performance. When we play video games, our brains release serotonin, which gives us a sense of accomplishment when we complete difficult tasks.\n\nHaving a higher feeling of self-efficacy, or believing that one can do things successfully can enhance motivation. Additionally, cognitive skills such as spatial reasoning, memory, and attention span can also improve.\n\nOthers suggest that playing video games may actually improve your mental health by lowering stress and anxiety levels. For some, it serves as a distraction from pain and psychological trauma.\n\nAdditionally, video games can provide emotional benefits, such as, connections for individuals who struggle in social situations or do not have other means to interact with others. This has been shown to be true for children with autism spectrum disorder or those who live alone.\n\nOn the other hand, there have been concerns that video games may increase violence in society or lead to addiction in players. These questions will help us better understand the world of video games and their influence on society. From their positive effects and emotional resonance to moral considerations, games have challenged our decision-making and changed the way we interact.\n\nVideo Games for Mature Audiences\n\nWe are not discussing the content rating here, but because video games are such a new medium, they have only recently begun to mature over the last couple of decades. As a result, it will be interesting to see what kinds of games are developed for an older gaming audience.\n\nAs gamers age, games may contain fewer physical and mental activities with a low impact. They require players to make decisions about situations, to be creative, and to perform memory exercises. These games are also easy to learn, have bright, bold graphics, and require good coordination.\n\nThe Impact of Video Games on Society\n\nIt was not until the 1970s and 1980s that video games took off as an industry. Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Nintendo’s Game & Watch signalled the beginning of a new era of video games. These and many other games have evolved and influenced culture, art, and entertainment.\n\nBack in the day, computer magazines frequently published code so that readers could copy it and acquire a free game. I recall typing out lines and lines of code for a free game that would run on my father’s Commodore Vic-20. The Vic-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units, but more importantly, ours had the 3.5K RAM expansion pack! To put that in context, the smartphone in our pocket has thousands upon thousands of times the power.\n\nHowever, I was always a little disappointed that the result fell short of the beautiful artist illustrations or cover art that accompanied the code. Lines and lines of text, numbers, symbols and signs that did not make any sense to me.\n\nI remember reading about how future games would become more photorealistic, which was something I could only dream of at the time.\n\nNonetheless, video games enable us to express ourselves, tell stories, and capture a specific moment in time. For example, Rockstar Games’ 1997 release of Grand Theft Auto is widely regarded as ushering in a gaming revolution.\n\nThe game offered a bitingly critical look at contemporary American life; some regard it as one of the most important and influential titles of all time. Despite being banned in a number of countries and heavily criticized by many groups for its portrayal of negative emotion and violence, it is widely regarded as a game changer and social commentary.\n\nOscar Wilde once wrote that “Life imitates art far more than art imitates Life.” Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater (THPS) series, on the other hand, influenced a new generation of skaters. People who had never skated before were soon sharing their favorite “trick” button combinations. Not only that, but a group of skateboarding enthusiasts recreated the video game series in real life.\n\nIt is no secret that video games are an important part of our culture and, for many people, have become a way of life.\n\nThe Popularity of Retro Video Games\n\nRetro video games are a popular phenomenon, with many gamers nowadays reliving the glory days of gaming through collectible consoles and beloved older games. Some of these games are exclusive to older consoles, but some are being remastered for newer consoles.\n\nSmall single-board computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, can run retro game emulation software. This allows individuals without the appropriate hardware and software the accessibility to experience gaming history and indulge their nostalgia.\n\nThe popularity of retro gaming has been steadily on the rise for the past few years. Not only because of nostalgia and aesthetics, but also because the majority of people who grew up playing these games now have disposable income. Many retro video game stores offer many second hand bargains and increasingly valuable rare items for the serious collectors alike.\n\nVideo gaming history is an interesting subject because it tells us about how far gaming has come in such a short span of time. It also tells us about how digital games are different from their predecessors and how they are influencing our culture in various ways.\n\nNostalgic aesthetics make old consoles more appealing to players because they evoke childhood memories. Video arcades also contribute to this nostalgic aesthetic as they remind players of the old days when video gaming was not so accessible at home.\n\nThe Resurgence of Pixel Art\n\nPixel art is a type of digital art created with graphical software in which images are constructed entirely from pixels. Pixel art is particularly relevant in the world of video games, as 24% of the best-selling games of all time employ this art style.\n\nIt is commonly associated with low-resolution graphics from 8-bit and 16-bit era computers and arcade video game consoles. Pixel art is distinguished by its low overall colour count. Pixel art as a medium is similar to early video game graphics, which were created by devices that could only output a limited number of pixel colours such as LED displays and graphing calculators.\n\nFurthermore, many pixel artists believe that using a large number of colours, especially when they are relatively similar in value, is superfluous in most cases and detracts from the overall cleanliness of the image, making it appear messier.\n\nEven though technological limitations have since been overcome, pixel artists and game studios continue to use the art form.\n\nThe past few years have seen a resurgence of pixel art in video games, and it is not hard to see why. There is something about the limitations of working with limited colours and pixels that makes projects much more interesting and creative. Pixel art is enjoying a sort of newfound popularity, with many modern games using retro aesthetics and themes.\n\nWhen I first saw Minecraft, I could not believe how popular it was, in terms of its graphics, I thought it was going backwards. However, devoid of any visual nostalgia, pixel art was something completely new to the next generation of gamers.\n\nBy watching my daughter play, I realised how sophisticated the game was, and it reminded me of playing with Lego when I was younger. In the future, I expect we will see some very creative, spatially aware architects and urban planners.\n\nRemakes\n\nThe original The Last of Us was published on the PlayStation 3 in 2013 and then remastered a year later for the PlayStation 4. Less than a decade after its initial release, the game is being remade with the new title “The Last of Us: Part I” for the PlayStation 5. This also helps to market the franchise to a new audience as it moved to a television series.\n\nWhy Are Video Games Becoming More Than Just Nostalgia?\n\nThe video gaming industry is huge and has become an important part of our culture. In the last few years, the revenues of the video game industry have been larger than the film industry.\n\nFor some, video games have evolved from a pastime activity to a lifestyle, from YouTubers to professional e-sports players. The number of people playing video games on a daily basis is increasing, with the average gamer playing for six hours each week. Furthermore, non-traditional gamers like women and older people becoming more and more prevalent.\n\nSince the release of Pong in 1972, video games have come a long way. Initially, they were just a way to escape reality and forget about life for a while, but they have evolved into much more. They are an art form, a business, and even a tool for education.\n\nSecond-hand Nostalgia from Cultural Memory\n\nThe term “nostalgia” comes from the Greek word nostos, meaning “return home,” and algia, meaning “pain.” In the past, nostalgia was used to describe a physical illness. However, in the late 18th century, nostalgia was redefined as a psychological condition.\n\nNostalgia is a powerful emotion usually associated with memories of family, friends, or life events that evoke feelings of happiness and comfort in people. Furthermore, restorative nostalgia sees the past as a place of truth rather than longing. Reflective nostalgia, on the other hand, considers questions of belonging and heritage while avoiding the ambiguities of modern society.\n\nIn contrast, second-hand nostalgia occurs when someone who has not experienced something personally, feels nostalgic for it. Often, this is only because they have heard about or seen it before.\n\nThis type of nostalgia can be found in video games, where people feel nostalgic for something they have never experienced themselves. Such as, playing an old arcade game, or feeling nostalgic for late-20th-century video gaming culture.\n\nHowever, these emotions can also be a powerful marketing tool that can be used to get people to buy products. From the early days of arcades, when games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders were released, to the modern era of video gaming consoles. Additionally, the media mediate memories for the millennium generation via shows like Stranger Things.\n\nAs time goes on, I suspect the video gaming industry will continue to use nostalgia as a way to keep consumers interested in their products.\n\nWhich Game Has Yet To Be Invented?\n\nThe video game industry is continuously evolving, so it is not surprising that we do not know what games will be like in the future, but what if we could. The Entertainment Software Association organizes and presents E3, a trade show for the video game industry. Developers, publishers, hardware manufacturers, and accessory manufacturers use it to promote upcoming games and game-related merchandise to retailers and the media.\n\nIs it possible to uncover new game concepts by researching the psychology of gamers and how they react to various stimuli? This could be explored in tandem as well as the societal changes that are taking place at the same time.\n\nThe idea might be to introduce something physical that can be played while complementing the allure of sitting in front of a TV. Children today have access to extremely powerful smartphones with internet access, maps, GPS, and Bluetooth technology. This creates ideal conditions for a wide range of activities, from advanced tag games to distributed team sports or even global education and learning.\n\nAthletes tend to dominate regular sports; if you have different abilities from your teammates, you just will not have as much fun. Different types of roles can be defined by defining the rules differently, allowing for a greater diversity in who is qualified to participate.\n\nWhat about sports that combine the outcomes of real-world matches and digital teams, the results of which would dynamically change?\n\nSome of the issues that game design could help to solve in sports are as follows:\n\naids the gender neutrality of the new sport;\n\nlowering the entry barriers;\n\nusing virtual and augmented reality to adapt to a more urban situation;\n\nTeamwork is valued by others and is one of the most rewarding and difficult aspects of team sports and activities.\n\nHowever, one of the issues here is that it is not always a level playing field across the globe. As in the physical world, many in developing countries may not have the same access to technology or level of opportunity. Not only that, but also this is before you consider factors such as the developed world’s air of entitlement or conscientious bias.\n\nConclusion: The Future of Gaming is Bright and Full of Possibilities\n\nWe discussed video games’ cultural and historical perspectives in this blog post, including their characterisation in history and their impact on society. In addition to being a simple pastime, video games have become an integral part of our culture.\n\nVideo games present a complex topic, with a variety of implications for both positive and negative impacts on society. Nevertheless, their importance and relevance to our culture and history cannot be denied. They help us tell the stories of our time and explore the world of our imagination.\n\nMy blog on whether or not video games are “art” has been and continues to be a source of contention. The real question, perhaps, should be, “What is the true measure of art?” While not everyone accepts video games as art, there is no denying that they contribute significantly to artistic media such as music and film.\n\nI, for one, believe that video games are art, just as any medium that elicits emotions or provides an experience is. Such as the first time I played Journey, an indie adventure game with a wordless story told through game-play and visual cut-scenes. Some could be even considered games to improve emotional intelligence.\n\nVideo games have evolved from a derivative medium that drew inspiration from other art movements and types of media, such as literature, films, and music. Today, it has become a type of medium from which other types derive new ideas. Video games have also interacted with traditional forms of media, altering them and introducing new forms of entertainment and interaction.\n\nOne of the things that sets video games apart from other media is their unique narrative and artistic style. A common misconception about video games is that they are purely entertainment. Nevertheless, video games have evolved into something that critics and art historians can study.\n\nAs video gaming evolves, it is clear that nostalgia is no longer the only driving force. Art history is playing an increasingly prominent role in the medium, with developers using classic works as inspiration for their own creations.\n\nFor example, Pentiment, which means an earlier painting covered up by a later one, was released in November 2022. It is a narrative adventure game with a Renaissance-style aesthetic inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut printing, and publications such as the “Nuremberg Chronicle.”\n\nI do not have as much time to play video games as I used to. I do, however, enjoy keeping up with the most recent and inventive games on the market. Finally there is no reason why modern game design cannot be used as an inspiration when creating artwork. I hope that this has helped to spark a debate in your mind.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please show your support by subscribing to my mailing list and sharing it with your network!
