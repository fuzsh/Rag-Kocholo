        "text": "Evolution Studios' Matt Southern has said he was concerned at one point that the studio might close after MotorStorm Apocalypse's troubled release.\n\nSpeaking with Eurogamer, Southern said when retailers started cancelling pre-orders of the game following the announcement of its delay after the Japanese quake and tsunami, the team became a bit worried Sony would close it down.\n\nHowever, Evolution's concern was for naught, according to Southern, who said the publisher \"defended us and protected us and allowed us to experiment\".\n\n\"It's been quite a tough year for us, especially early on in the year,\" he said. \"We made a game we're really proud of and for some really heartbreaking reasons things didn't go so well. In perspective we've got nothing to complain about.\n\n\"I was worried it might be the end of Evolution. Racing has had a very tough time, even without extraordinary circumstances like the ones we went through.\"\n\nSouthern said the studio's next project, MotorStorm RC for Vita and PS3, was conceived while post-launch DLC and multiplayer for MotorStorm Apocalypse was being handled by two teams at Evolution, allowing a third to brainstorm new ideas.\n\nAfter Sony gave the new title the all-clear, Southern said the studio's spirits are a bit better, and it's starting to get excited about development on MSRC.\n\n\"We're not out of it yet, [but] things are turning round, I think,\" he said. \"The studio's really, really buzzing now.\"\n\nMotorStorm RC is slated to launch alongside Vita on February 22."
