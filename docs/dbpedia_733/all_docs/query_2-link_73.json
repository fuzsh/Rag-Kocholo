        "text": "Sony has delayed the release of its PS3 exclusive racer MotorStorm Apocalypse in the UK following the crisis in Japan.\n\nThe game, developed by Liverpool outfit Evolution Studios, centres around a city rocked by various natural disasters and was due out in the UK this coming Friday.\n\n\"We are shocked and saddened to see the impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and our thoughts are with all those affected, including our colleagues within the Sony family, living and working throughout Japan,\" said Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in an official statement.\n\n\"We are very conscious of the parallels between these events and the underlying theme in MotorStorm and are doing everything we can to be as sensitive as possible to the situation. Although the game itself is already in distribution, we are ceasing any further shipments and removing as much of the marketing materials as possible and where possible we will postpone the release.\"\n\nMotorStorm Apocalypse is due for release in the US on April 12 and it's as yet unclear what Sony Computer Entertainment America's plans are for release and whether it'll also be affected by the situation.\n\nSony has itself been hit by the tragic events in Japan, with the Tohoku region that was struck by the earthquake and the resulting tsunami hosting many of its manufacturing sites. It is donating 300 million Japanese yen to help the relief effort.\n\nIf you want to make your own contribution please head to the British Red Cross site and make a donation, or if you're reading in America then head here to donate to your local alternative."
