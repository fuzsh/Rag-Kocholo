However, it tells us that the shutdown followed reviews of \"short and medium term\" plans, and that it's devoting attention to studios that will be in a \"stronger position going forward.\" In essence, it didn't see Evolution's work leading to a bona fide hit in the near future.",

Evolution had already lost 55 people almost exactly one year earlier as it tried to refocus on Driveclub as a service."
