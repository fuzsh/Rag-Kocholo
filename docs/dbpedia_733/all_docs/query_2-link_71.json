        "text": "The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) is going on right now, so, of course, we’re tuned in to any game that coincides with our love of automobiles. MotorStorm: Apocalypse is one such game for the PlayStation 3.\n\nWe’re already familiar with the franchise, and have spent hours behind the virtual wheel aiming all sorts of explosion-prone vehicles through MotorStorm’s different treacherous environments. So, our ears perked up when we heard about the newest title, which takes place in an end-of-times setting, complete with deteriorating infrastructure and toppling skyscrapers, (which, according to Sony, do affect gameplay).\n\nOh yeah, and it’s going to be 3D-capable. (Pause for the sobering realization that the 3D TV in our future is going to set us back a pretty penny.)\n\nWe have enjoyed the series so far, and we can’t wait to get our hands on the newest MotorStorm title. In the meantime, screenshots, concept art, and a video trailer will have to suffice.\n\nScroll down for more information from Sony.\n\nMotorStorm®: Apocalypse\n\nFACT SHEET\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC.\n\nDeveloper: Evolution Studios\n\nPlatform: PlayStation®3 system\n\nGenre: Racing\n\nRating: “RP” for “Rating Pending”\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOnce again, the most brutal off-road racing festival is back, and this time the ‘Stormers are bringing the extreme MotorStorm® festival to a major metropolitan city ravaged by a gigantic earthquake. Developed by Evolutions Studios exclusively for the PlayStation® 3 (PS3™), MotorStorm®: Apocalypse brings back the signature MotorStorm racing madness but this time the racers must deal with the unpredictability of a crumbling urban environment. Filled with unstable skyscrapers, fiery subway tunnels, twisting bridges, and collapsing buildings, the almost completely abandoned city offers the perfect playground for MotorStorm’s electric brand of brutal street racing. Fully customize your collection of vehicles, including supercars, muscle cars, and superbikes, and face down your fellow ‘Stormers as well as a city where destruction awaits you at every turn. With tremors and aftershocks continuing to hit the city in real-time, players will be faced with making quick decisions in a landscape on the verge of total devastation. Welcome to the apocalypse, MotorStorm style!"
