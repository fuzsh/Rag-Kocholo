        "text": "OOOH, excellent news. Time to get my old copy out of storage!\n\nCannot believe Sony closed this studio. Should've just had them make Gran Turismo Horizons.\n\nTo be fair, this studio is still alive and kicking. They made Onrush and Dirt 5 and are now known as Criterion Cheshire (formerly Codemasters Cheshire). As far as I know many of the same people are there, or were there for those games. They're now working on Need for Speed.\n\nA lot of PS3 games still look pretty damn good underneath the resolution and framerate limits of the console they're locked to. I mean, this game is 14 years old. Really hope Sony starts to take emulation seriously.\n\nYeah, I'm hoping their PS3 games at least get remasters with offline content accessible if they don't plan on having servers for the games like Motorstorm. Pacific Rift is an absolute blast and deserves a second lease of life, even if the developers are no longer at PS.\n\nIt's an IP with great potential for an arcade racer with local and online multiplayer, but it never really got the opportunities it needed to shine.\n\nIt's so frustrating to see passionate people do a better job preserving old games than multi-billion dollar companies.\n\nSadly true... fans do it better than the actual IP owners more often than not... Im just glad that there's people out there working on emulators like these. I will at least give Xbox credit for its BC stuff though. Missing so many games, but the ones they did boost FPS, resolution etc. is a marvelous thing.\n\nIt's 30fps native bumped through settings/a patch to 60fps, right? I wonder if it can go higher.\n\nAsking because every now and then I try to play RR7 at 120fps and it's sped up, but maybe something changed since last I tried.\n\nIt's so frustrating to see passionate people do a better job preserving old games than multi-billion dollar companies.\n\nThese games should be running natively on a PS5, damn it!\n\nPS3 emulation is hard asf, and if it's not 99% perfectly emulated, it's not a product nor something they can sell. People would want to refund it.\n\nThese emulators are expected to be a WIP forever.\n\nMy favorite fun fact about PS3 emulation is that PSNow servers had (have?) actual PS3 hardware on it.\n\nIt's 30fps native bumped through settings/a patch to 60fps, right?

But it's still possible on a PS5 though, they just need to invest in it.\n\nSome sources/insiders have suggested they're working on it.\n\nsad they never followed up on the franchise. it was one of my faves of that era\n\nThey did: Apocalypse sold worse than Pacific, which had already moved significantly less units than the original game. Regardless of the tsunami that conditioned the latest entry's release, Motorstorm was in a clear downwards trajectory by the end of that generation. Side projects like Motorstorm R&C or Arctic Edge didn't fare any better.\n\nThen Evo tried to shift gears with DriveClub. And the rest is history.\n\nThey did: Apocalypse sold worse than Pacific, which had already moved significantly less units than the original game.

And the rest is history.\n\nI'm well aware and I liked apocalypse quite a lot. And yeah, that's why it's a shame. Franchise is effectively dead at this point and it'd be wicked to see it given a new chance on current hardware. Oh well. At least they're doing all this work to make the old stuff look as it can.\n\nI'm well aware and I liked apocalypse quite a lot. And yeah, that's why it's a shame.

At least they're doing all this work to make the old stuff look as it can.\n\nI see. It's just that you phrased it as if there had been nothing else after Pacific (or I understood it that way). And I agree, it woud be nice to see a return of the formula in general. Arcade racers are dead aside of the likes of Forza Horizon which go in a different direction either way.\n\nEvo also kept trying with Onrush but again there was no audience. So I guess the future is in the past and emulating what studios don't care to pay for these days.\n\nIt's so frustrating to see passionate people do a better job preserving old games than multi-billion dollar companies.\n\nThese games should be running natively on a PS5, damn it!\n\nYes…\n\nIt's really frustrating.\n\nI have a premium subscription and theres so many PS3 titles I would love to play and replay…\n\nhere in Brazil even the streaming option for PS3 games doesn't work."
