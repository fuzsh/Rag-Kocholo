        "text": "Sony has acquired Evolution Studios, the UK-based developer responsible for PS3 fave MotorStorm. This acquisition includes the assimilation of Evolution subsidiary BigBig Studios, who made Pursuit Force for the PSP.\n\nEvolution's co-founders, Martin Kenwright and Ian Hetherington, will be leaving the company, leaving Mick Hocking to take on the responsibilities of group director for Evolution, BigBig, and Sony Liverpool.
