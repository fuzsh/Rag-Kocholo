        "text": "A number of former Motorstorm and Driveclub developers have established a studio in Liverpool, England to work on a new science fiction-themed game. Called Wushu Studios, the team is headed up by Alan McDermott, with Nigel Kershaw serving as design director, and Stuart Trevor taking up the position of art director. The three have each worked on Motorstorm and Driveclub titles for Sony, as well as other projects for Deep Silver and Revolution Software.\n\nWushu has also been working with former BioWare concept artist Alex Figini, who contributed to Mass Effect 3. The studio is currently made up of 11 people and is \"expanding ... with a goal of moving away from the AAA grind to create games with interesting mechanics, unique concepts, and to deliver fun, refreshing gameplay experiences.\"\n\nAs of yet, Wushu hasn't revealed its first game, but it has said it began prototyping the project in September 2017 using Unreal Engine 4. It said the game will provide a \"tantalizing and unexpected take\" on the sci-fi genre.\n\n\"Our core team at Wushu have worked together closely on numerous projects over the years so there was no downtime in figuring out how to work together, we just fell straight into a groove kicking around game ideas that appealed to us as players and developers,\" explained McDermott.\n\n\"We firmly believed in the idea that our initial concepts needed to be gamepad experiences as quickly as possible, so we turned to Unreal Engine for its amazing, rapid prototyping capabilities. This approach has helped us figure out which of our concepts would allow us to flex our creative muscle most. It's definitely not what people will be expecting to see from us; it's absolutely not a racing game!\""
