TI also filed a complaint about a person who allegedly bribed three people.\n\nThe anti-corruption watchdog also noted cases in which the work of election monitors was disrupted or in which they were subjected to pressure in two districts in Marneuli and in Telavi.\n\nThey also reportedly witnessed instances of ballot secrecy being violated, with one voter, for example, being escorted into a voting booth.\n\nPollster.ge: Georgian dream polling at 37% of the vote\n\nIn their final forecast on 30 September, David Sichinava and Rati Shubladze from Pollster.ge estimated that Georgian Dream would win around 37% in the elections, significantly below the 43% symbolic threshold that the ruling Georgian Dream party had agreed they would need to win in order to avoid new parliamentary elections. Georgian Dream later withdrew from the agreement.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of the vote has been forecast for the UNM and 9% for the For Georgia party. All other parties polled below 5%.\n\nPollster.ge calculated a weighted average of all publicly available opinion polls in the run-up to the vote.\n\nPolice called to 72nd district in Gldani\n\nNetgazeti has reported an incident at the 72nd precinct in Tbilisi’s Gldani neighbourhood. An activist from the Droa party reportedly tried to file a complaint with the district election head but was prevented from doing so, until journalists arrived to cover the incident. The district head then called the police to report interference with the election process. According to Netgazeti, police then forced the journalists to leave the precinct. According to Droa, the complaint was regarding an unidentified person who handing 'some papers' to election commission members through an open window.\n\nUS Ambassador: ‘Washington is watching’\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Marneuli today, US Ambassador to Georgia Kelly Degnan said America was watching today’s vote closely.\n\n‘Washington is following it very closely. I’ve been getting a lot of requests from them, from my colleagues in Washington, including at the State Department, at the White House, in Congress, they’re following this closely as well’, she said.\n\n‘We’re concerned about the reports of pre-election intimidation and violations and abuses, harassment. What I’m pleased to see is that the party leaders are calling for calm today.’\n\n‘We’ve had some reports of locals observers at various precincts around the country, who don’t seem to know which NGOs they’re working for or what their roles are, that’s a little concerning, but that could also just be a lack of training. So we’ll continue to follow during the day events all over Georgia. [It’s a] very important day. I’d just encourage the voters, please, wear your masks, but come out and vote’, she said.\n\nCommenting on Saakashvili’s arrest last night, the Ambassador said that ‘talking about yesterday isn’t as important as talking about going forward.’\n\n‘We want people to be focused on the election, on the issues. I think Georgia needs more political stability and not more polarisation.\n\n‘Mr. Saakashvili’s case will be a test of the Georgian judicial system, and we’ll be watching to see if the case is handled impartially and in accordance with Georgian law and Georgia’s international obligations.’\n\nGiorgi Gakharia: Choice between the past and the future\n\nFormer Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, who now heads the For Georgia Party, said today's vote was a choice between the past and the future.\n\n‘This is not just a municipal election, this is an election of renewal and we all saw, especially for the past month, what it means and where single-party rule can take us’, Gakharia said.\n\n‘So we should all understand that there are two political powers which feed off each other and drag the country to the past. Of course, with the right choice by us, we can take the country forward.’\n\n‘This is an election of principals, this is an election between the past and future. I truly believe that today each citizen of Georgia feels how much the country needs refreshing and they will make the choice, a smart choice, a heartful choice, which will take the country forward.’\n\nTurnout 17.7% as of 12:00\n\nGeorgia’s Central Election Commission (CEC) has reported a 17.7% turnout nationwide as of 12:00.\n\nIn the previous local elections in 2017, turnout was 16.5% at the same time.\n\nPresident Zurabishvili votes for ‘depolarisation’\n\n‘Polarisation has no place in local elections. I voted for depolarisation’, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili stated after voting in Mtatsminda District, Tbilisi.\n\nKaladze voted for ‘calmness and stability’\n\nTbilisi’s incumbent Mayor, Kakha Kaladze, said he voted for the Georgian Dream.\n\n‘I voted for calmness, stability, peace, development of the city, for bringing more life to each district’, he told journalists after casting his ballot.\n\n‘Only one party can do all of this — this is Georgian Dream. Accordingly, I voted for Georgian Dream so that there will be peace and stability in the country.’\n\nUNM member reportedly attacked near Marneuli\n\nThe UNM has claimed that Jeihun Choidarovi, a local majoritarian candidate from Georgian Dream, attacked party member Ajimurad Muradovi outside the 48th polling precinct in the village of Kizilajlo, in Marneuli Municipality. They said Choidarovi has been hospitalised.\n\nGeorgian Dream members outside the polling station accused the UNM of a ‘provocation’ after the opposition group claimed the ruling party was attemptng to organise carousel voting, a form of election fraud.\n\nTV Pirveli crew robbed of their equipment in Batumi\n\nTV Pirveli has reported that members of Georgian Dream snatched equipment used for live broadcasting and took it to their vehicle after the crew tried to find out what they were doing outside the 64th polling station in Batumi.\n\nPirveli reporter Teona Dolenjashvili called the police to report the incident and to get the equipment back.\n\nA man in the same van also hit the camera of local outlet Batumelebi.\n\nMedia outlet Kvira reported a similar attack outside the 60th polling station in Batumi.\n\nAbkhazian authorities restrict movement to Georgia-controlled territory\n\nGeorgia’s State Security Service (SSG) have reported the closure of movement on the Enguri bridge by the Abkhazian authorities today.\n\nAccording to the SSG, exceptions are being made for those seeking medical treatment.\n\nRegional media outlets Livepress and Radio Atinati have confirmed the closure.\n\nISFED: quarter of polling stations not ready by 08:00\n\nAccording to Georgian election watchdog the International Society for Fair Elections And Democracy (ISFED), 24.3% of polling stations were not ready to open by 08:00 throughout the country.\n\nISFED Chair Nino Dolidze called it a ‘signification deterioration’ compared to the 2017 local elections, when 99.3% of polls were ready to receive voters as polls opened.\n\nISFED also reported the mobilisation of party activists outside polling stations who they suspected were keeping track of voters.\n\nTurnout 7.4% as of 10:00\n\nThe Election Administration has released preliminary turnout figures: as of 10:00, 7.4% of eligible voters had cast their ballots.\n\nThis is up from the previous municipal elections in 2017 when turnout at the same time was 6.7% but is lower than for last year’s parliamentary elections, when turnout stood at 8.3%.\n\nCEC identified the Racha-Lechkhumi region as having the highest turnout, at 11.2%, while Kvemo Kartli Region was the lowest, with 6.1%.\n\nCEC Spokesperson Natia Ioseliani confirmed that Parliamentary Speaker Kakha Kuchava wearing a face mask with a party symbol on it was a violation.\n\nMelia thanks the media and challenges Imedi\n\nUNM chair Nika Melia, who is running for Mayor of Tbilisi, has cast his ballot in Mtatsminda District before thanking the media.\n\n‘Thank you so much for existing, media, thank you so much for supporting the future of the country. I hope you have been able and will be able to participate in the elections during the day, as it is usually difficult and you are not often given the opportunity to express your will because of your profession, but we should all be able to do that today’, he said.\n\nMelia was challenged by a journalist from Imedi who asked ‘how could you say all of us here present should support Misha [Saakashvili] when Saakashvili raided Imedi?’, referring to the 2007 raid on Imedi when Saakashvili was in office.\n\nMelia responded that the raid was ‘one of the biggest mistakes’ of the UNM when in power.\n\n‘Look over there, where the [TV] operators are standing. Lashkarava should be there among them’, he said. ‘Fourteen years later, don't you journalists of Imedi have any questions regarding 20 July, 5 July?’, he asked.\n\nAleksandre Lashkarava died a week after being attacked by a mob during the riots in Tbilisi on 5 July, when police in Tbilisi failed to act to prevent the violence.\n\nMelia also said that many Imedi journalists supported the opposition despite the channel’s pro-government editorial line.\n\n‘I know a lot of your employees and the political mood among them is different than you seem to be expressing here now’, he said.\n\nFormula reporter threatened with a taser\n\nA man reportedly identifying himself as Davit Kiria has threatened Salome Chaduneli, a journalist from TV Formula, and other reporters working outside an 84th polling station in Zugdidi with a taser.\n\nThe man dangled the taser activating it briefly after being challenged by journalists to clarify if he was near the polling place to pressure voters.\n\nRecently amended electoral regulations ban people from congregating closer than 100 metres outside polling stations in an effort to crack down on voter intimidation.\n\nSaakashvili urges Georgians to vote from prison\n\nIn a written appeal from Rustavi Prison delivered via his lawyer, the third Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili called on Georgians to show up at polling stations and vote so that ‘no vote is lost’.\n\n‘Let’s all together defend the results of the referendum after that’.\n\nMost opposition groups have labelled today’s local elections a ‘referendum’ on whether Georgian Dream should call an early parliamentary vote in 2022, despite the ruling having already reneged on their promise to do so.\n\nSpeaker Kuchava votes with party symbol\n\nThe Speaker of the Georgian Parliament, Kakha Kuchava, voted in Tbilisi this morning wearing a protective mask with the Georgian Dream party logo and the party electoral number, 41, written on it.\n\nThis could amount to campaigning during the election day, which is prohibited under Georgia’s Electoral Code.\n\nBidzina Ivanishvili casts his vote\n\nBidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party, has cast his vote in Mtatsminda, Tbilisi.\n\nHe left the area surrounded by a heavy security detail without giving comments to the media.\n\nAfter retiring politics in January, Ivanishvili has kept silent, breaking it only once to condemn Giorgi Gakharia’s resignation as prime minister and his creating a new party.\n\nAll eyes on Tbilisi\n\nThe most significant individual race today will be in Tbilisi, where incumbent mayor Kakha Kaladze will hope to avoid a rerun as he faces off against UNM chair Nika Melia and former Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia.\n\nRead more about the candidates vying for they mayorship in the capital: Who's who in the Tbilisi Mayoral election.\n\nSaakashvili throws a spanner in the works\n\nToday’s vote has been somewhat overshadowed by the dramatic return from exile and subsequent arrest of former President Mikheil Saakashvili last night. Saakashvili has been convicted in absentia on several counts of abuse of power in Georgia.\n\nAfter multiple broken promises to return since leaving the country in 2013, Saakashvili announced on 27 September that he would arrive on election day, even posting a photo of an airline ticket for that day.\n\nBut the former Georgian President caught the country off guard on Friday after publishing a video allegedly shot in the western city of Batumi and claiming to have already arrived in Georgia.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Saakashvili told the Public Defender he would go on hunger strike and insisted he was a political prisoner.\n\nAnd there were more revelations throughout the night. At one point, a 30-year-old Ukrainian MP, Yelyzaveta Yasko, published a video on Facebook with Saakashvili purportedly recorded before his departure in which they announce they are starting a family together. Saakashvili is married and has two children with Sandra Roelofs.\n\nRead more: Saakashvili arrested in Georgia on eve of election.\n\nKhoshtaria casts her ballot\n\nElene Khoshtaria, who leads the newly formed Droa Party, has cast her ballot in Tbilisi’s Vake District. Khoshtaria was elected an MP last October for the European Georgia Party before renouncing her seat in protest over the conduct of the election.\n\nDuring this election, Khoshtaria will be on the ballots to represent Gldani District on the Tbilisi City Assembly (sakrebulo).\n\nAfter casting her vote, Khoshtaria called for people to come out and vote while playing up the idea of a future coalition government.\n\n‘We have the opportunity and our citizens have the opportunity to make a choice in favour of a diverse opposition, in favour of a coalition. Maybe someone doesn't like me, doesn't like some other candidate — they have the choice to find a team of their own taste from the opposition, and then, according to their decision, we will have to form a coalition as decided by our voters.’\n\nWith no opposition party polling high enough to challenge the ruling party alone, a possible coalition government has increasingly become a talking point among many in the opposition.\n\nPolls open\n\nPolling stations have opened for today’s municipal elections. Around 3.5 million Georgian’s will be eligible to vote to elect members of local councils and mayors of 64 municipalities.\n\nThe ruling party will be hoping to garner at least over 43% of proportional votes after earlier in April they committed to calling early parliamentary elections if they failed to pass this symbolic threshold.\n\nDespite Georgian Dream’s change of heart on that promise, most opposition groups have claimed it is still an important threshold that could delegitimise the ruling party’s refusal to call the early election next year.\n\nThe rejection of the April agreement by Georgian Dream is one of the several controversies that have sent Georgia’s relationships with the West to their lowest point in years, and has seen their domestic support slipping in opinion polls."
