        "text": "Last night on my way home, a well dressed Marine joined our flight to Billings. Shortly before we pulled back from the gate, the captain announced over the intercom that this flight was carrying a fallen Marine and that the young man in dress blues was escorting this hero home to his family. It was the first time I have been onboard a flight where this duty was being conducted and it gave me two hours to reflect on service to our nation and how fortunate we are as Americans to have these brave men and women stand watch for our country. As I drove home after our plane met the family and those that cared deeply for this fallen Marine, I also felt a sense of hope that through all our struggles as a country, we still are the shining city on the hill in this world. That is worth fighting for. #Dignifiedtransfer #America #Marine #honor"
