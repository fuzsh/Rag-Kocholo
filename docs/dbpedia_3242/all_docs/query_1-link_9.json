        "text": "TBILISI -- Georgian activists and politicians protesting against a controversial \"foreign agent\" law say that they and their children are receiving threatening phone calls from abroad.\n\nAccording to numerous stories shared with RFE/RL's Georgian Service, unidentified individuals have been calling the activists and opposition politicians late at night or very early in the morning.\n\nThe calls have been coming from international numbers, including from Azerbaijan, South Africa, Burundi, Morocco, and Ukraine, as well as through local mobile operators.\n\nThe alleged harassment comes as several Georgian opposition figures have suffered serious injuries after being attacked by unknown assailants and police have violently dispersed protesters in the capital, Tbilisi, with rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons.\n\nUnder the proposed \"foreign agent\" law, which parliament on May 14 adopted on its third and final reading, media and nongovernmental organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad would be obligated to register as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power.\"\n\nOpponents say the legislation, if passed, would be a threat to free speech and is similar to \"foreign agent\" legislation passed in Russia, which has been used to clamp down on opposition and curtail independent journalism.\n\nOne of the children said to have received a threatening phone call was the 11-year-old daughter of Sopo Gelava, a researcher at the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), a disinformation analytical unit of the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank, and Giorgi Noniashvili, a member of the opposition European Georgia party.\n\nGelava told RFE/RL's Georgian Service that her daughter was enjoying her birthday party on May 9 and didn't hear the calls from abroad. After noticing the missed calls on her phone, she informed her parents.\n\nGelava says she'd heard about threatening calls targeting politically active individuals, but \"had no idea that these calls would target a minor.\" The phone number her daughter uses is registered under Gelava's name, although she says that she has never personally used this number.\n\nGiorgi Noniashvili's Facebook post showing the calls from abroad\n\nA member of the opposition It's Time party, Tamta Gogoladze, said that she received a threatening phone call,where unidentified individuals swore at her and used \"unpleasant words.\"\n\n\"I warned my mother that they might call her and verbally abuse her,\" Gogoladze said. \"My mom and I both laughed it off, but when they called my little sister, a child I don't even live with, it obviously wasn't funny anymore.\"\n\n'She Told Me That I Was A Traitor'\n\nAccording to Gogoladze, the callers asked her 13-year-old sister over the phone why her elder sibling went to rallies and why she was ruining the country. \"I apologized to [my sister] for having such a bad day because of me. She actually calmed me down, but, obviously, it was a stressful experience and it affected her.\"\n\nNow that parliament has passed the law, it will go for approval to Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who has supported peaceful protests and criticized the government for ignoring the views of those taking to the streets. If the president does veto the law, parliament then has one month to override the veto.\n\nArchil Mchedlishvili, a political activist from the eastern city of Telavi who has taken part in the recent protests, told RFE/RL that both he and his young son were called from different numbers.\n\n\"It was a woman's voice.... [She] told me that I was a traitor...and then hung up,\" Mchedlishvili said. \"Then they called my son from the same number and asked if I was paid to go to the protests. That caller was also a woman, and she spoke politely.\"\n\nSocial media users have also posted accounts of similar phone calls that they say demonstrators and their families have received.\n\nKhatia Dekanoidze, an opposition deputy in parliament, said her 16-year-old niece received a call from a foreign number on May 9."
