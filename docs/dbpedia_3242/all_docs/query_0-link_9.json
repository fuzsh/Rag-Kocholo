He has worked for leading Georgian conservation organizations such as NACRES and GCCW and has participated in many wildlife conservation projects. He has traveled widely within Georgia and the Caucasus. He has been a participant for various years in the International Waterbird Counts, and was a local IWC coordinator for Georgia in 2003. During 2006-2007 he carried-out bird identification training for Georgian wildlife inspectors. Aside from his conservation work, Giorgi has been leading birdwatching tours throughout Georgia for the last five years under the auspices of various organizations. Kazbegi is one of his favorite places and Giorgi understands exactly where to go in order to find the region’s specialties. Recently, Giorgi became interested in butterflies and aims to prepare photo-illustrated publications to make these colorful creatures more popular and respected in his country. He is an accomplished wildlife photographer, and his pictures have been an important contribution to a number of local and foreign publication. When not looking for birds and butterflies, he is enjoying an active lifestyle, either hiking or cycling.\n\nLanguages I speak:\n\nEnglish - Fluently\n\nRussian - Fluently\n\nTours From My Experience"
