        "text": "Georgian U21 football team starts the qualifying round of European Championship 2015 with two outdoor matches: September 5 against Luxemburg and September 9 against Slovakia.\n\nU21 will held meeting on September 2 in Luxemburg and before this, Aleksandre Chivadze, head coach of the team, answered the questions at the press conference hall of Mikheil Meskhi stadium.\n\nAleksandre Chivadze “We will hold two matches of qualifying round on September 5 and 9. We called up 22 players for the team. Georgian Championship matches will be held tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and I wish all players be healthy. If somebody gets trauma, we will be able to correct the list”.\n\n- The Georgian team is not in the most difficult group and how do you estimate our rivals and the chances of our team?\n\n- Everybody learned to play football in Europe. The Georgian U21 is a new team. We are in the same situation, as national team. FIFA and UEFA designated the days on which we have to play, and that’s why we have not long preparatory period. Holland, Scotland and Slovakia are strong teams. We must consider what we represent. In Europe, more than ¾ teams are well-educated. Georgian youth team have a huge responsibility before the match.\n\n- Will Giorgi Chanturia play in the next matches? As we know, he cannot play in the club level due to his disqualification.\n\n- Chanturia will be with us and he will play. As we are informed, he can play in the youth team.\n\n- Have you learned your rivals, Luxemburg and Slovakia?\n\n- During being in Austria, I was in the match between Austria and Slovakia. We have information about our opponents, Georgian national team must seriously approach to all games.\n\n- Did Georgian Football Federation presented concrete goal for the next qualifying round?\n\n- Last year, when I came to this team, there were players born in 1990-1991. We immediately took the path to the future generation born in 1992-1993. We held 4 friendly matches before the start of qualifying stage, which is not enough. In 22 member list 9 players are born in 1992, 9 – in 1993 and 4 – in 1994. We called Lasha Dvali against Latvia, but he was going to Israel for the operation. We hope for Dzalamidze too, he cannot play this time due to his trauma. Iluridze joined the national team. Overall, it is important is to get into the national team from youth team.\n\n- What can you say about the play of candidates of youth team in Europe League?\n\n- Iluridze and Kobakhidze played for “Dila. Papava has not played for “Dinamo”. It is good that they receive such level experience. It is also good, that they moved on in such teams of Georgian Championship, where they have a possibility to play. Playing practice is important.\n\nHere are the following list of players, who will play against Luxemburg and Slovakia.\n\nGoalkeepers: Giorgi Nadiradze (“Spartak”), Kakha Meshveliani (“Zestafoni”), Gabriel Tebidze (without team).\n\nDefenders: Archil Tvildiani (“Sioni”), Mamuka Kobakhidze, Giorgi Gaginidze (both “Dila”), Solomon Kvirkvelia (“Rubin”, Russia), Tedo Grigalashvili (“Zestafoni”), Davit Ubilava (“Torpedo”).\n\nMidfielders:Nika Kvekveskiri, Lasha Chapidze (both “Spartak”), Giorgi Papava (“Dinamo”), Lasha Parunashvili(“Sioni”), Valeri Kazaishvili (“Vitesse”, Holland), Merab Gigauri (“Torpedo”), Davit Kirkitadze(“Metalurg”), Jambul Jigauri, Besik Dekanoidze (both “Chikhura”).\n\nForwards:Davit Skhirtladze (“Aarhus”, Dania), Giorgi Chanturia (“Vitesse”, Holland), Nika Kacharava (“Rubin”), Giorgi Pantsulaia (“Torpedo”).\n\nHead coach of U21 will choose 21 players for the next meetings.\n\nGeorgian team is in the 3rd qualifying group with Holland, Scotland, Slovakia and Luxemburg. Apprentices of Chivadze will play home match against Holland on October 10 and against Scotland on October 14.\n\nSlovakia and Scotland already has played in the current qualifying round. Both of them lost to Luxemburg. Scotlan won over rival 3:0, and Slovakia won over 7:1.\n\n10 groups are in the qualifying round of European Championship 2015 and besides the winners 4 best 2nd place owners will go through the playoff. 7 teams will be known in the playoff, which will play in the Championship 2015 of Czech Republic. The 8th team will be Czech Republic which does not participate in the qualifying round."
