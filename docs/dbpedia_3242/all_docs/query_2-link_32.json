        "text": "News\n\nLive Blog: ‘Yes to Europe, No to Russian Law’ – Rallies Against Foreign Agents Bill\n\nCivil.ge Send an email\n\n34 minutes read\n\nSince the reintroduction of the draft law on Foreign Agents, the streets of Tbilisi have been taken over by continuous mass rallies under the slogan “Yes to Europe, No to Russian Law”, some of which have spontaneous, without the organizers announcing the rallies beforehand.\n\nLarge numbers of young people – schoolchildren, students, young adults – have been gathering and blocking Rustaveli Avenue (where the Georgian parliament is located) for several days in a row. The young Georgians have continued to rally every day, even taking a solemn oath to defend Georgia’s European choice.\n\nOn April 3, the parliamentary majority leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Mamuka Mdinaradze, announced the reintroduction of the draft law on foreign agents, which was dropped last year after the massive rallies on March 7-9. According to Mdinaradze, the content of the bill remains the same, the only change is in the title: the word “agent” in it has been removed and the title has been replaced with “Organization Pursuing the Interests of a Foreign Power”. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from the civil society and opposition within the country and from Georgia’s international partners. The bill has already been passed in the first hearing.\n\nWhat began as protests solely against the Foreign Agents Law has now taken on a wider dimension, with demonstrators also protesting against recent amendments to the Tax Code and a Russian FSB-linked conference held at the Tbilisi Palace Hotel.\n\nLive Blog (All times are local):\n\nWednesday, June 5\n\nProtesters held an protest rally at the Government Administration, singing the national anthem of Georgia.\n\nIn the evening, protesters gathered on Rustaveli avenue to protest the Foreign Agents Law. Protesters led by Dafioni are planning to march towards the Government Administration, and the ruling Georgian Dream headquarters.\n\nSunday, June 2\n\nAt 21:00, a rally-concert with the participation of well-known Georgian bands and singers began at the Republic Square. The concert, in defiance of the law on foreign agents and of the campaign of intimidation and terror against citizens, is also a solidarity event aimed at collecting donations for the support of the persons detained at the rallies and those on trial, and to cover the costs of the fines imposed on them.\n\nFriday, May 31\n\nThe protesters are back in the streets even as the Foreign Agents law has been adopted by the Parliament. After gathering in front of the Parliament they protesters marched to the Bridge of Peace and hung flags of Georgia, EU and Ukraine, as well as huge banner saying: “Go on strike, Georgia!”\n\nTuesday, May 28\n\nThe rally against the foreign agents law ended after midnight.\n\nAround 11:30 a.m., the demonstrators arrived at the Georgian Dream headquarters and staged a sit-in. As usual, the area was heavily guarded by police.\n\nAround 23:00, the demonstrators marched to the presidential residence, the Orbeliani Palace.\n\nOpposition MPs joined the protest and address the people. MP Tamar Kordzaia called on President Salome Zurabishvili to join the demonstration. MP Khatia Dekanoidze publicly read the names of 84 MPs who voted in favor of the foreign agents law.\n\n19:00: As the parliamentary majority overrode the Presidential veto and finally passed the Foreign Agents Law, thousands of demonstrators are gathered near the Parliament building. Rustaveli Avenue is blocked. Heavy police are mobilized. The MIA issued a statement calling on demonstrators “to enable members of Parliament and employees of Parliament administration leave building without interruption” and said that “any violation of the law will be immediately prevented by the police.”\n\nAt around 11:00 in the morning, people started to gather at the central entrance of the Parliament of Georgia as the ruling Georgian Dream prepares to override the Presidential veto on the Foreign Agents Law in today’s plenary session. Larger rally near the Parliament is scheduled at 17:00 today.\n\nSunday, May 26\n\n20:00, protesters against the Foreign Agents Law march from Tbilisi’s Kostava Street to Vake Park, repeating the route of the first Independence Day march on May 26, 1919, one year after Georgia declared independence.\n\nGeorgian emigrants in Berlin held a protest against the law, which was attended by a Member of the German Bundestag, Michael Roth. He addressed the gathered demonstrators, telling them that “Georgia is Europe and Tbilisi is the capital of Europe.\n\nOn the Independence Day of Georgia demonstrators against the Agent’s Law and Russian rule are marching around the country in protest. The march started first in Zugdidi, where people marched around the city center and the territory where the government representatives were holding the Independence Day celebrations.\n\nSaturday, May 25\n\n18:00: Protesters including university teachers are marching on the Chavchavadze avenue against the Foreign Agents Law. They are expected to arrive at the Heroes’ Square at 19:00.\n\nIn the morning, some of the students gathered in protest at the second building of Tbilisi State University, where Prime Minister Kobakhidze was scheduled to deliver a lecture. According to media reports, he entered the building, but not through the main entrance. The Prime Minister had to leave the building with the police support, and a physical confrontation ensued between the student protesters and the alleged supporters of Georgian Dream.\n\nFriday, May 24\n\nThe demonstrators reach the building of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Similar march was held in Batumi as well.\n\nThe MIA reported the arrest of two participants in the May 14 rally – 19-year-old O.O. and 23-year-old S.M. The MIA states: “…in the vicinity of the building of the Legislative Body, during the ongoing protest, S.M. and O.O., together with other persons, deliberately damaged the iron protective dam located at the entrance to the Parliament, using both physical force and an iron object”. The case is being investigated under the second part of Article 187, “G”, which provides for 6 years’ imprisonment.\n\nStudents have started gathering on Heroes Square from early hours of the day.

By 17:00, Rustaveli avenue had been blocked.\n\nOn May 15, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported the detention of 41-year-old G.O., who participated in the May 13 rally. The MIA states that the detainee “physically attacked the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs during the protest rally held near the Parliament. In particular, during the rally, the detainee hit the policemen with his elbow and fist and injured his face”. The case is being investigated under Article 353 prima of the Criminal Code, which carries a 7-year prison sentence.\n\nTuesday, May 14\n\nA number of protesters were reportedly arrested on Heroes Square.\n\nBy 11:00 pm the central Heroes square and both river banks of the Mtkvari river got blocked by the protesters.\n\nAt about 21:00 the heads of the foreign committees of European legislatures, who are visiting Tbilisi, addressed the crowd on Rustaveli Avenue and expressed their solidarity with the protesters. Ode to Joy and Georgian anthem were played after their speeches.\n\nIn the evening, people marched in the streets of Batumi as well, blocking the Rustaveli street there.\n\nBy 19:00 the police and special forces retreated as more and more protesters started arriving on Rustaveli avenue.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs said at approximately 19:45 arrested 13 people in accordance with Articles 166 and 173 of the Code of Administrative Offenses for disobedience to the lawful demands of the police and petty hooliganism.\n\nSeveral detentions have been reported, but there has been no word yet on their fate. One of the detainees was David Katsarava, the leader of the anti-occupation movement Power is in Unity which regularly patrols the occupation line and reports on the situation on the ground. Katsarava was standing peacefully on Rustaveli Avenue when, as the footage shows, he was grabbed by the special forces and severely beaten, especially on the head. He is now in the hospital, and the footage broadcast by television stations shows severe bruising on his face.\n\nPublic Defender of Georgia reacted to the MIA’s statement. The Ombudsman believes there is no reason to disband the rally as a whole after individual measures were takes against the individual rally participants who, according to the statement, violated the rules of peaceful assembly and the requirements of the law. “Accordingly, the Public Defender calls on the Ministry of Internal Affairs not to use special measures against the peaceful participants of the rally and to ensure they can enjoy the right of assembly guaranteed by the Constitution.” The Ombudsman’s Office continues to monitor the situation.\n\nAt 17:11 the MIA made a statement claiming that the rally in the Parliament’s vicinity “went beyond the norms established by the law on peaceful assembly and demonstration and continued in a violent manner,” damaging the iron barrier at the legislative body. The MIA confirmed using “special means provided by the legislation.”\n\nAt 17:00 the situation around the parliament became tense, special security forces came out of the parliament, arrested the demonstrators and took them to the parliament yard. Allegedly, the notorious Zviad Kharazishvili unit, known for its brutality, is taking part in the arrests. According to Formula TV, Lazare Grigoriadis is among those arrested. The special forces mobilized on Freedom Square started moving toward the Parliament building. The pre-recorded warnings have been turned on warning citizens to disperse of the “legally determined measures will taken” for maintenance of pubic order.\n\nIt is announced that the red level of security will be activated in the Parliament building from 17:00 on May 14 for an indefinite period. No one will be allowed to enter the Parliament of Georgia, except for the persons identified by the Head of the Parliamentary Staff.\n\nBy 16:00, Parliament adopts “foreign agents law” in its third and final reading.\n\nAnother citizen was detained while writing “This country is ours” [“ეს ქვეყანა ჩვენია” in Georgian] in red spray paint on the Parliament building.

The police arrested a number of people at 09:05 am, although the situation remained calm and the demonstration was held peacefully.\n\nAt 08:39 a.m., the Public Defender of Georgia issued a statement noting that the police had allegedly used improper treatment of citizens. “The Public Defender once again calls on the Ministry of Internal Affairs to act within the framework of the legislation and once again states that the use of force must be necessary and proportionate, must be aimed at carrying out a specific legal measure, and in no case should it turn into targeted violence/retaliation against the citizen. Furthermore, the Public Defender calls on the Special Investigation Service to respond immediately to the given facts; to complete the ongoing investigations in the shortest possible time so as not to create a sense of impunity that will encourage individual police officers to commit further illegal acts”.\n\n08:35 a.m., the police tried to detain another person, a boy peacefully protesting. Reportedly, some people have been detained, however the demonstrators didn’t let the police take the boy they chased after. The police has been using spray foam to continue dispersing the rally.

So, let us Georgians be able to unite at least in a critical moment.”\n\nWhile gathered near the Georgian Dream central office the rally participants addressed the law-enforcement officers mobilized there, informing them of launching an initiative to financially support people working in the public sector “so that they are no longer dependent on the state” and promising: “Soon you won’t have to obey orders against your will.” The demonstrators announced that this concerns not only the policemen, but also people working in other government institutions, and promised to help them with finding a job in case of dismissal from their job.” Soon you won’t have to obey orders against your will just to bring bread to your families, we know it’s hard, but we’re working hard.

Protesters brought and swapped red eggs and Easter cakes as part of the tradition. Orthodox Easter is one of the most important religious holidays in the country, and many Georgians head to the countryside to spend time with their families. But this year, the protesters who stayed in Tbilisi decided to celebrate the holiday together. The protesters’ decision to mark Easter on Rustaveli Avenue comes amid continued attempts by the ruling party and pro-government media to paint law opponents as unbelievers and anti-church. Kashveti Church, located across the street from the parliament building, has witnessed Georgia’s worst upheavals and greatest breakthroughs. Now it finds itself again at the center of the country’s current trials and tribulations.\n\nAt around 23:00, protesters again blocked Rustaveli Avenue as rallies against the foreign agents law continue despite the Orthodox Easter holidays.\n\nProtests also continue in Kutaisi, western Georgian Imereti region, where locals again marched in the evening against the foreign agents law.\n\nIn the evening hours, locals in Zugdidi, western Georgia, marched against the “Russian law.”\n\nFriday, May 3\n\nAt 23:00, the Ministry of Interior issued a statement saying that the MIA had information that “certain political forces and organizers of actions were planning to organise the so-called “performance”, whereby, the ministry said, they wanted to “stage alleged violent actions by law enforcement officers”. The plan, according to the Ministry, was to wear the uniforms of representatives of various units of the Ministry of the Interior and to spread information as if the police had joined the demonstrators. The Ministry noted that this alleged plan was prompted by the failure to convince police forces to join the protest. The MIA called on representatives of political parties, the organizers of the rally “and persons with similar intentions to refrain from such provocations and to respect the professional activities of law enforcement officers”.\n\nAfter protesting at the GD head quarters part of the demonstrators returned to the Parliament building, another part gathered with lit candles by the Kashueti Church on Rustaveli avenue, across from the Parliament building.\n\nAt 21:00, the demonstrators started marching towards the Georgian Dream headquarters.

The crowd then began to march from Rustaveli Avenue to Heroes’ Square in support of their fellow citizens. As the number of people increased significantly, Heroes’ Square was soon blocked again.\n\nOne of the organizers of the demonstration on Heros’ Square has been arrested around 19:30.\n\nThe demonstrators who gathered at Heros’ Square were able to completely shut down the intersection. The people gathered there called on the drivers of the cars to come out and join them, which part of the drivers did.\n\nAt 19:00, part of the demonstrators started to gather on Rustaveli avenue in front of the Parliament.\n\nThe protests resumed at 18:00 with demonstrators gathering at Heros’ Square, one of the most important intersections in the city, connecting the main highways of Tbilisi:\n\nReportedly, at early morning hours, at around 5 a.m., the police arrested two demonstrators after verbal confrontations, when one demonstrator “verbally insulted policemen” by trelling them that they “sold themselves for 1500 GEL”.\n\nAt 02:09, international hackers team named “Anonymous” confirmed that it had taken down the websites of Georgian Dream and PosTV, pro-Government channel. The team’s statement reads: “To the puppet government of Georgia, controlled by Russia: Despite our warning, you have decided to disregard our request to stop the police brutality against the protesters and have persisted in continuing to abuse, harass, and harm them. For your inhumane actions against your own citizens, we will continue to deface and take every web-based asset of your government offline. This is not a threat; it is a promise. Until justice prevails, hacking and protesting will replace it. The cause of security and democracy will justify the assault on your virtual infrastructure. Don’t forget: Georgia is not Russia, and it will never be.”\n\nProtest against the Foreign Agents Bill continues with the police cracking down on the protesters. As of 01:30, 8 civilians had been hospitalized with one of them already discharged from hospital, according to the Emergency Situations Coordination and Urgent Assistance Center of Georgia.

The watchdog said there have been violations of human rights and dignity and call on Interior Ministry to halt these actions and on special forces “to refuse illegal orders.”\n\nWednesday, May 1\n\nShortly after the midnight Parliament of Georgia issued a statement saying that due to the attack on the Parliament building, which poses a threat to the lives and health of the people in the building, the red level of security was activated from 23:00 on May 1. According to the relevant decree, under the red level of security, all persons are obliged to leave the Parliament building, except for those determined by the Speaker of the Parliament in accordance with the nature of the threat and the need to prevent it.\n\nAt around midnight the Interior Ministry issued a statement saying it used special measures – water cannons, pepper spray and tear gas against the protesters who tried to break in the Parliament yard. Interior Ministry denied using the rubber bullets against the demonstrators, which is contradicted by numerous video testimonies. MIA called on protesters “to stop violent and illegal actions and protest in a peaceful manner, otherwise the police will be forced to use special means established by law and stop the rally.”\n\nA large protest rally took place in Batumi, in western Georgia.\n\nA fire broke out on Chitadze Street, where one of the entrances to the Parliament building is located. It seems that the wooden boards that covered the works on the side street were set on fire. The riot police is putting the fire out with water cannons.\n\nReportedly, the participants of the rally, opposition Girchi – More Freedom party member Tsotne Koberidze and Mtavari TV operator Zuka Chkhvirkia are injured from the rubber bullets shot by the riot police.\n\nAt 22:39, the Public Defender of Georgia issued a statement saying that the office is monitoring the ongoing protest near the Parliament. The statement notes that the protesters shouldn’t exceed the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and reminds the MIA that it can take appropriate and proportionate measures to disperse the rally only if it becomes violent or unconstitutional.\n\nAt 22:35, Ursula von Der Leyen, President of the European Commission issued a statement – “I am following the situation in Georgia with great concern and condemn the violence on the streets of Tbilisi. The Georgian people want a European future for their country. Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe.”\n\nMIA released another statement saying: “After the units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs left the territory around the Parliament, the participants of the rally became aggressive and tried to damage the iron doors of the entrance to the legislative body. In order to restore law and order, the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs used special means provided by the law – pepper spray and water cannons”.\n\nAt around 22:10 riot police began spraying pepper spray, tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators who were trying to break into the Parliament building by breaking down the heavily sealed metal doors of the Parliament. Rubber bullets were reportedly used to disperse the rally, injuring a 16-year-old boy and two cameramen, including one from Formula TV.\n\nParallel rallies are held by Georgian emigrants in front of the Georgian Consulate in Israel, in New York, London and near the Georgian Embassy in Brussels.\n\nThe MIA issued another statement at 21:30, reporting that “the representatives of various units of the Ministry of Interior, after ensuring the safe exit of the MPs and employees of the Parliament, completely left the area surrounding the Parliament. The demonstrators have the opportunity to hold a rally at a place of their choice”.\n\nThe bill was passed in the second reading around 20:00, an hour before the end of the plenary session, as the MPs from the parliamentary majority refrained from making speeches and only Anri Okhanashvili, MP from the GD, made a final speech. More and more people are gathering around the Parliament.\n\nThe MIA issued a statement calling on citizens to “express their protests in the forms established by law and not to paralyze the streets.” It also urges protesters not to make calls that “could become a precondition for violent acts.” The statement emphasizes that “any illegal act will be met with an appropriate lawful response.\n\nCitizens began to gather around the Parliament at 17:00. Riot police were soon mobilized in the side streets and behind the Parliament building. Rustaveli Avenue has been blocked.\n\nAn increasing number of residents are generously offering accommodation in Tbilisi and covering of the transportation expenses for citizens from regions who are joining the protests in the capital.\n\nAs for 13:00, the Parliament of Georgia has resumed the second hearing of the Foreign Agents Law, with the tensions continuing to run high in the legislation following the brutal police crackdown on the demonstration. People from all across the country are rushing to capital Tbilisi to protest on the Rustaveli avenue this evening.\n\nTuesday, April 30\n\nAfter the GD organized so-called counter rally, which mobilized people from Georgian provinces who were bussed to Tbilisi, which announced repressions against the “collective” UNM and opponents, and was infused with anti-Western messages, the anti-foreign agents law protest rally resumed with new impetus at 19:00 local time. Massive mobilization of law enforcers is observed near the Parliament building. By approximately 21:00 the police closed the streets on the left and right-hand side of the Parliament. The demonstrators tried to block the entrance of the Parliament building to prevent the GD MPs from leaving.\n\nAt around this time the Interior Ministry issued statement saying that “the law enforcement officers are mobilized to ensure the safety of all citizens.” The statement also said that “Employees of various departments of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in order to ensure the safe exit of the deputies and employees of the Parliament from the building and to avoid artificial escalation of the events, are at the entrances of the legislative body and call upon the gathered people to leave the entrances and exits of the Parliament building.” The MIA warned that “any violation of the law will be dealt with in accordance with the law.”\n\nPart of demonstrators went to the Government Administration building.\n\nThe situation became tense at around 21:45 by the back entrance of the Parliament with riot police using pepper spray without prior warning.\n\nRiot police brutality continued, with dozens of demonstrators injured, many cornered and beaten by law enforcement.

At 22:20, the Ministry of Interior issued another statement, noting that despite calls for the demonstrators to leave the premises, they didn’t do so, and “in order to restore law and order, the Ministry of Interior used legally established special means”. The MIA reiterated calls “to political leaders, organizers and participants of the rally not to exceed the norms of assembly and demonstration established by law.”\n\nThe riot police without in black, without visibly identifiable police badges were lashing out from the ranks of the riot police trying to snatch individual protesters and cracked down on protesters several times throughout the evening, using water cannons, pepper spray and tear gas. This was followed by the riot police carrying out a special operation on Rustaveli Avenue, forcing the protesters off the avenue.\n\nCloser to midnight MIA issued another statement saying that “the protest of the participants of the rally on Rustaveli Avenue…went beyond the scope established by the law on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and took on a violent character.” MIA said that “despite numerous appeals by the police, they do not comply with the legal demands of the law enforcement officers” and “confront the law enforcement officers verbally and physically, and also throw various objects in their direction.”\n\nThus the MIA said, it is starting to “implement the measure stipulated by the law in order to restore public order.”\n\nDespite the special forces detachment’s brutal attempts to break up the protest, using every means at their disposal, including pepper spray, tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets, people continue to remain on Rustaveli Avenue, and even more are gathering there. At around 1 a.m., the riot police resumed their efforts to disperse the protest, again using gas and water cannons.\n\nAt 12:42, President Salome Zurabishvili issued a statement calling on the MIA to immediately stop breaking up the peaceful protests with “disproportionate use of force, violence against young people who come with bare hands”. The President appealed to the Public Defender to respond immediately to the ongoing violence and demand an end to “all unfounded and inappropriate actions of the special forces.”\n\nHuman Rights watchdogs Transparency International-Georgia and Georgian Young Lawyers Association issued separate statements saying that the law enforcers used disproportionate force against the protesters and calling on relevant authorities to investigate.\n\nThe Ombudsman of Georgia released a statement assessing the use of force against the demonstrators by the law-enforcers as disproportionate and calling on the investigative bodies “o conduct an effective investigation into the facts of the use of disproportionate force.\n\nThe rally continued into the late morning hours. The riot police left the scene before the demonstrators at around 5 a.m. The MIA held a briefing at 10 a.m. on May 1, announcing that 63 peaceful demonstrators had been detained yesterday and that 6 police officers had allegedly been injured.

Soon the avenue was filled with tens of thousands of demonstrators, an unprecedented number of protesters so far in the last two weeks.\n\nThe massive rally comes ahead of the ruling majority’s upcoming vote on the controversial law in its second reading next week, alongside a counter-rally organized by the GD scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nSpeakers delivered the statement of the rally organizers, calling on the government not to schedule the plenary session for the second reading of the law tomorrow, as many expect. They emphasized that if the government proceeds with scheduling the second reading tomorrow, they have a plan and special locations to mobilize people against it.\n\nAround midnight, as more and more people mobilized in front of the Parliament, where a special stage had been prepared for the GD rally, there were demands to allow some youth to enter the stage and raise EU and Georgian flags, and the situation between the demonstrators and the police escalated.

The statement noted that “due to the size of the gathering, the organizers planned to start preparations three days earlier and asked for various measures required by law to be taken.”\n\nThe statement said that “the gathering of the rally participants, who are now in the vicinity of the parliament, is unauthorized” and called on the participants “to refrain from provocations and give the organizers of the event planned for April 29 the opportunity to carry out their work”.\n\nThe Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association (GYLA) called on the MIA not to use special means against peaceful demonstrators and not to use riot police, stressing that there is no legal basis for a violent dispersal of the demonstration. “Publicly released footage shows that special forces are positioned at three exits of the demonstration area (from Chitadze, Chichinadze, and Liberty Square onto Rustaveli Avenue)” the statement reads noting that “they are equipped with special gas masks.” GYLA says this raises concerns “that the Ministry of Interior Affairs plans to use active special means, including tear gas. The footage also shows water cannon trucks. “We urge the Ministry of Interior Affairs not to use active special means against peaceful demonstrators and not to use them in their usual unlawful practice, such as at close range, targeting vital organs, and using multiple active special means simultaneously,” GYLA statement read.\n\nAlexi (Buka) Petriashvili, former State Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration (in 2012-2014 in the GD government) was detained by police, MIA has confirmed to news outlet Publika. He’s been detained on administrative charges, under the Art. 166 (petty hooliganism) and Art. 173 (resisting the police).\n\nThe Public Defender made a statement shortly after midnight emphasizing that interference with the freedom of assembly is permissible only if the action takes a violent and/or illegal nature, “in which case the termination of the assembly by the authorities should be used as a last resort and the use of force within the mentioned framework should meet the strict test of necessity and proportionality.” The Ombudsman’s statement said that “as of April 29, 00:30 there is no prerequisite for stopping the assembly and the rally is peaceful, therefore the Public Defender appeals to the Ministry of Internal Affairs not to use force against the peaceful participants of the assembly” and allow protesters to enjoy their rights guaranteed by the constitution.\n\nThursday, April 25\n\nThe protests against the Foreign Agents Law started at 19:00.
