        "text": "We, the media organizations that have signed the statement, strongly oppose the Russian bill initiated by the members of the Parliamentary Majority.\n\nWe firmly believe that this bill aims to suppress the critical voice and create an environment where media and public organizations can no longer uncover corruption, injustice, and poverty in the country.\n\nThis was proved by the outcomes of a similar law passed in Russia years ago - civil and media organizations were closed and journalists became the victims of persecution.\n\nAdopting this bill will cause insuperable harm to the EU accession process of Georgia, which was clearly indicated in the statement of the High Representative of the European Union on February 24. Consequently, the submitted legislative amendment hampers Georgia's development and closes a window of opportunity.\n\nWe serve Georgian society and express deep concern about the future of our country. We are not going to work under this label. Accordingly, in case of adopting the Russian law, we refuse to register as “Agents of Foreign Influence.” It insults our professional dignity.\n\nTbilisi:\n\nNetgazeti.ge\n\nPublika (publika.ge)\n\nIndigo\n\nStudia Monitor\n\nQueer.ge\n\nDev.ge\n\nOn.ge\n\nTabula\n\nCivil Georgia - civil.ge\n\nMediaChecker\n\nProject 64\n\nChaihana\n\nUfleba.ge\n\nAssociation of Investigative Journalists (ifacts.ge)\n\nMedia Holding Commersant\n\nOC Media\n\nMedia portal “Cactus,” cactus-media.ge\n\nJamNews (jam-news.net)\n\nOnline edition “Sova”(sova.news)\n\nRealPolitik (realpolitika.ge)\n\n“Mountain Stories” - mtisambebi.ge\n\nGeorgian News - sakartvelosambebi.ge\n\nJournalism Resource Center - JRC\n\nGeorgian Alliance of Regional Broadcasters\n\nRadio Tbilisi\n\nMtavari Arkhi\n\nAccent (accentnews.ge)\n\nMedia.ge\n\nClickMedia - clickmedia.ge\n\nFirstNews.ge\n\nShida Kartli:\n\nwww.qartli.ge\n\nRadio Mozaika, mozaikanews.ge\n\nTV Media Monitoring\n\n\"Georgian Media Group\" - metalab.ge / feminism.ge\n\nDia TV\n\nNeo TV - neotv.ge\n\nKvemo Kartli:\n\nCommunity Radio Marneuli\n\nWomen’s Community Radio WW\n\nKvemo Kartli Media - Qvemoqartli.ge\n\nMarneuli TV\n\nRadio Bolneli\n\nTV4\n\nSamtskhe-Javakheti:\n\nCommunity Radio \"Nori\", nor.ge\n\nTV “Borjomi”, borjomi.tv\n\nTV9, tv9news.ge\n\nUnion of Journalists of Samtskhe-Javakheti\n\nMediaSakhli - Sknews (sknews.ge)\n\nJavakheti News Center, Akhalkalaki, jnews.ge\n\nTOK TV\n\nAdjara:\n\nBatumelebi.ge\n\nTV 25\n\nRadio Citrus\n\nSamegrelo:\n\nNinth Wave Broadcasting Company\n\nRadio Atinati\n\nKolkheti 89\n\nTV Egrisi\n\nRadio Odishi +\n\nRadio Harmonia\n\nTV Odishi\n\nKakheti:\n\nVoice of Kakheti (knews.ge)\n\nInformation Agency “Speqtri” speqtri.ge\n\nCommunity Radio of Pankisi\n\nTV Tanamgzavri\n\nRadio Hereti\n\nImereti:\n\nKutaisipost (kutaisipost.ge)\n\nTV Rioni\n\nImervizia TV\n\nMega TV\n\nTV Zari\n\nRadio Rioni\n\nRadio Zari\n\nChemi Kharagauli\n\nGuria:\n\nGuria TV\n\nGuria News\n\nGuriis Moambe (guriismoambe.com)\n\nMtskheta-Mtianeti:\n\nAgrogaremo TV\n\n/The list is renewable/\n\nAccording to media information, yesterday, on March 5, 2022, Mikheil Fishman, the journalist representing the Russian independent channel \"Dozhd\" was denied entry to Georgia. He has so far refrained from commenting and identifying himself due to the growing threat to journalists in Russia.\n\nToday, on March 6, 2022, it became known that Mikheil Fishman's family is in Georgia, while the journalist himself is not allowed to cross the border and is still waiting for an answer from the Georgian state.\n\nWe would like to remind the public that “Dozhd” has been a broadcaster with a critical editorial policy regarding the Russian government. In the wake of the ongoing military operations in Ukraine, the aforementioned TV channel stopped broadcasting on March 3.\n\nRecently the Russian government introduced new regulations making it difficult for independent media to cover the ongoing war. Dissemination of information that the Kremlin might consider “fake” could be punished with a considerable fine or even imprisonment. Given these circumstances, some journalists are trying to leave Russia. Other media outlets in Russia have stopped broadcasting, including CNN, as well as the Russian bureau of Deutsche Welle, which has been closed. Therefore, we expect that other Russian journalists will likewise need the help of the Georgian State.\n\nWe believe that the fact of restricting the permit of entry could be discriminatory because other persons entering the country from Russia via Yerevan do not face similar obstacles. Therefore, the state must explain what constituted the main reason for not admitting Mikheil Fishman.\n\nThe Coalition calls on the Georgian authorities not to create artificial border obstacles for Russian journalists who have been harassed for their professional activities, strictly comply with the requirements of the Georgian Law on International Protection, and refuse to violate the rights of critical journalists and their associates.\n\nThe Georgian Charter of Journalistic Ethics expresses solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, media representatives, and colleagues in the Press Council of Ukraine.\n\nThe Charter thanks the journalists who work in the field and do their best to provide the public with checked and complete information on the developments after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, the Charter appeals to Georgian media outlets to be careful when covering current events in Ukraine, as such propaganda campaigns and disinformation are particularly active at this time, with numerous unverified reports, videos, and photos.\n\nIn a situation where the population of the country is completely focused on the events in Ukraine, it is important that the media make a redoubled effort to verify the information and use only reliable sources.\n\nThe Charter also appeals to the public not to be deceived by the misinformation spread by pro-Russian and anti-Western organizations and news channels operating in Georgia.\n\nOn September 29, 2021, the incumbent mayor of Tbilisi and the Georgian Dream mayoral candidate, Kakha Kaladze, called the journalists \"radicals\", \"the dirtiest people\" and \"the head of hatred and evil.\".\n\nThe Charter of Journalistic Ethics condemns Kakha Kaladze's statement and considers that such an attitude towards the media is characteristic of authoritarianism.\n\nThe Charter considers this to be an incitement to hatred towards the media, which is especially dangerous during the election period. It is noteworthy that Kakha Kaladze had previously been known for his aggressive rhetoric towards journalists when he compared the activities of the media on July 20, 2021 to the actions of violent groups.\n\nThe Charter of Journalistic Ethics has repeatedly stated that the aggressive rhetoric of politicians in Georgia creates a polarized media environment and negatively affects the safety and professionalism of journalists.\n\nThe Charter of Journalistic Ethics calls on the authorities not to encourage attacks on members of the media by their aggressive attitudes and to stop talking about restrictive norms of freedom of thought, speech, and expression, to support media freedom, and to switch to business relations’ mode.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, Mayor of Tbilisi Kakha Kaladze compared the activities of the media to the actions of violent groups.\n\nWe have repeatedly expressed concern over the aggressive rhetoric of politicians, which creates an unsuitable environment in Georgia for the free work of media organizations and journalists. This has a negative impact on the safety of journalists. It was the statements of the Ruling Party that encouraged the violent actions against 53 members of the media on July 5.\n\nThe Charter urges the representatives of the authorities to refrain from encouraging the attacks on members of the media with their aggressive attitudes and to stop talking about restrictive norms of freedom of thought, speech and expression, to support media freedom and to switch to a business relations.\n\nCases of violation of the rights of media representatives in Georgia have reached a critical level. Dozens of cases against the media are still uninvestigated. Dozens of cases against the media are not still investigated. The authorities fail to ensure the safety of journalists, while the statements by the officials of the ruling party encourage the violence even more.\n\nOn July 5, 2021, during a demonstration against the \"March of Dignity\", members of a violent group deliberately attacked the media representatives, subjected them to physical and verbal abuse, and deliberately destroyed their equipment to obstruct their journalistic activities.\n\nDespite the preliminary calls from the civil sector, the state has not taken appropriate measures to protect the media representatives. Insufficient police forces did not take measures to protect the journalists. Moreover, on July 5, before the start of the government session, the Prime Minister of Georgia, Irakli Gharibashvili, laid the responsibility not upon the members of the demonstration but the organizers of the \"March of Dignity\" for the possible complication of the situation and called them not to hold the march on Rustaveli Avenue.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, on July 5, 53 members of the media were injured, including the operator of TV Pirveli - Aleksandre Lashkarava, who was severely beaten by violent groups on July 5. Aleksandre Lashkarava died on July 11.\n\nPart of the media representatives still remains in the hospital. Members of various violent groups continue to openly threaten journalists and cameramen, to which the law enforcement agencies do not respond accordingly. The organizers of the violent demonstration of July 5, whose identities are not known, have not been arrested either.\n\nIt should be noted that most of the facts of the attacks on journalists, obstruction of media activities, and violence that happened in the past have not been investigated so far and the issue of responsibility of the organizers of the violent groups has not been outlined.\n\nWe appeal to the representatives of the diplomatic corps and international organizations accredited in Georgia to respond immediately and effectively to the purposive persecution of media representatives on Rustaveli Avenue on July 5, the facts of damage to health, obstruction of professional duties, and inaction of the Georgian government.\n\nSignatories:\n\n1.

Hereby, we reiterate that the government has failed to guarantee the safety and security of media representatives as earlier attacks on journalists went largely unpunished.\n\nOn July 5 - 6, 2021, dozens of journalists and cameramen became the subject of large-scale violence. On a day when the March for Dignity, organized by Tbilisi Pride, was supposed to take place in Tbilisi, violent groups targeted media representatives, inflicted physical injuries and verbal abuse, and deliberately smashed their equipment to obstruct coverage.\n\nDespite earlier warnings from the civil sector, the authorities did not take relevant measures to ensure the safety of the organizers of the March for Dignity or the media. The acts of violence were broadcast live. It was obvious that the insufficient police force was acting passively and failed to restore the order in the streets.\n\nOn July 5, prior to the cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister of Georgia, Irakli Gharibashvili, put the responsibility for the possible aggravation of the situation not on the counter-protesters, but on the organizers of the Tbilisi Pride, and called them not to hold the march on Rustaveli Avenue. During violent attacks, the only protection mechanism applied by the Ministry of Interior was withdrawing the journalists from the coverage scene.\n\nThe attacks against the media continued on July 6, 2021, in the course of the solidarity rally in Tbilisi, when the violent groups attempted to disrupt the live broadcast of Formula TV.\n\nAccording to the official information, a total of 53 representatives of more than 10 media outlets were injured. Some of them were admitted to the hospitals with severe injuries and are under medical care up to date.\n\nIn response to the multiple acts of violence, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia has detained only 12 individuals under the charges of illegal interference with journalistic activities, while the journalists were able to identify more attackers in the available video footage.\n\nIn the light of the unprecedented scale of violence against the media and in order to protect freedom of speech and expression and other fundamental rights in the country, we appeal to the Government of Georgia:\n\nTo conduct a prompt and efficient investigation into the cases of violence against the media representatives injured on July 5 - 6, 2021, as well as to bring the perpetrators to justice\n\nTo cease using hate speech against the media and openly support the freedom of journalists to carry out professional duties\n\nWe appeal to the Parliament of Georgia:\n\nTo hold an ad-hock hearing of July 5-6 events in the Parliament, and to evaluate the efficiency of the steps taken by the government to protect the citizens\n\nTo condemn the calls and acts of violence\n\nTo issue the statements in favor of freedom of expression and openly support the freedom of journalists to carry out professional duties.\n\nSignatories:\n\nAlliance of Regional Broadcasters - AB\n\nGeorgian Charter of Journalistic Ethics\n\nGeorgian Democracy Initiative - GDI\n\nGeorgian Regional Media Association - GRMA\n\nGeorgian Young Lawyers` Association - GYLA\n\nInternational Society for Fair Elections and Democracy (ISFED)\n\nInstitute for Development of Freedom of Information -IDFI\n\nLiberal Academy Tbilisi\n\nMedia Club\n\nMedia Development Foundation\n\nMedia Rights\n\nOpen Society Foundation OSGF\n\nRights Georgia\n\nSmall and Medium Telecommunication Operators Association of Georgia\n\nTransparency International Georgia\n\nTV network\n\nAccording to the reports, the violent groups on Rustaveli Avenue physically and verbally abuse the journalists.
