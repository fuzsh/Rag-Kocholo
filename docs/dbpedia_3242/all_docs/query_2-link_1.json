So that’s gonna look like constant expression, creativity, ideas, feelings, needs, triggers, desires, concepts. We are experiencing massive energy shifts right now personally and collectively. So much expansion and energetic upgrades, and time definitely feels like an illusion this days. It feels like yesterday was December and is already almost March. For some of us this year 2024 feels like a few lifetimes because time doesn’t travel in a linear way the way our calendar program us to think and feel. Time is made up of constant now moments. Have you hear the thought wow it feels like yesterday i was 8 years young when I was playing in the backyard in that mangoe tree and now I’m 40 and is 2024 or whatever memory in your case? Or wow my son or daughter was a baby and now he/she is so grown? Or they were puppies and now such big dogs? Last night my partner Devon said OMG I feel I’m getting old! I’m looking at the wal at a 2022 vision board and right next to it the 2024 vision board. It feels like December 31st was the other day when my partner @Devontaylorauthor, myself and the kids were setting intentions and designing our vision boards together. Or a family member we loved and suddenly they passed away. Life is a moment and our time on this earth is a short breath. How can we make the most out of our time and energy here? How can we be more present? Are we really living or just passing by? Are we activating and sharing our full potential? Did you write that book yet? Did you take that risk and started that business or travel to that country you have always wanted to go? Did you ask her/him out of that date or adopted those kids? When are you gonna marry him/her? Are you gonna forgive yourself? Whatever it may be for you. What are you waiting for to live your dreams? The “perfect” time? Get that kitty or puppy you always wanted. Make that investment. Quick that fucking job you hate. Heal that sexual trauma. Open your heart and cry. Hug your father and start that difficult conversation. You are so loved. Your time is now. This is your call and sign from the universe to live your dreams ✅. If you would like more support you can book a reading. I’ll hold space with you, help you move through resistance, speak life to your dreams and witness you as you take your power back and start living now ☀️ #CapCut #generationalwealth #winnercircle #bluelotus #fyp #universe #kangenwater #jeancarlotavarez #healing #devontaylorauthor #beginnings #community #residualincome #taxes #travel #taxes2023 #taxes2024 #heavenonearth #coach #expansion #heavenonearthsong\n\nIn the survivalist world that we come from, the most traumatized individuals were the most shamed and shunned. It was survival of the ‘fittest’, authenticity and healing be damned. If you could punch your way through the pain and accumulate, you were deemed a success. It didn’t matter what your inner world or personal life looked like, so long as you championed the material world. But that way of being is coming to an end. It is no longer serving us. Those in denial around their pain, those focused exclusively on mastery and material achievement, those who imagine themselves ‘self-determined’, are actually destroying our species and the planet that houses us. We can no longer inhabit a reality where our greatest success stories are those who fled their pain the fastest, hiding their unhealed brokenness behind an over-compensatory materialism. I am not fooled by the egoic accumulators of the world. They are merely lost children, confusing their bottomless quest for worldly validation with healthy self-regard. They will never find peace, in this way. It is a soulless path. It is time for a world that champions the survival of the truest. That stands down the accumulators and elevates the authenticators. A world where success is not measured by our ability to out-achieve our neighbor, but by our ability to remain heartfully connected to each other. That honors those who have the courage to feel and share their painful story, to invite all of us to self-reveal. That celebrates those who are brave enough to own their uniqueness in the face of judgment and ridicule. This is the only world that can last. In this next-step world, those who have suffered the most will be our greatest teachers. It has been so artificial for so long, that we need the trauma-speakers to save us. Because they are the closest to the truth of all of our lives. Because they are the most connected to the feelings that we are all burying- the individual cries for relief, the ancestral unresolveds that thread through each generation. It may seem counter-intuitive in this conditioned world, but those who have the courage to own their pain, are actually the ones we need the most. So next time you feel tempted to turn away from someone who wants to share their horribly painful story, stop. Just stop. Ask yourself why you are so eager to go- are they reminding you of something you don’t want to feel within yourself? Then listen close to them, and let them whisper your heart back to life . . . ~ Jeff Brown #truecourage\n\nWhat are you searching for 💙🚔🫀🌎 It is sad but an apparent reality that many in our society are lacking guidance, fulfillment, and direction. Sure we are all headed somewhere , but some are headed nowhere, and fast. Within law enforcement, we use camaraderie and fulfillment as recruitment and retention selling point. Two things that are naturally desired by every human being: the need to belong and the need for fulfillment. What other profession offers the potential for invaluable moments and connections on every shift? We connect with others through conversations and vulnerability and by showing up, we are now a character within their story. The role we play is so critical that despite the act of showing up and clearing the call, we have the capacity to dictate the outcome. Ease or complicate their trauma. Help commence or delay their healing. I ask you again, what are you searching for ? What do you go to sleep and wake up dreaming about ? Do You know ? What void are you seeking to fill? Put the basics aside, the things that we all need to survive. Think about this on a deeper level. What makes you glow? What makes you shine ? What does your zen space look like and who is present in the picture? And why aren’t you doing more of it ? It makes me sad to see so many people live below their potential and sacrifice their desire for one reason or another. Because they lack confidence, hope, vision, motivation, or support. Dreaming small. Going through out the day as if we will get those 24 hours back another time. Our time is the one thing we are all given that we aren’t getting back yet we waste it as if we are guaranteed it in abundance. Within us, is the capability to change the world, one life and one heart at a time. And we can. If we cared enough to. If we operated full of passion and at our full potential. I hope everyone reading this recognizes that they were put on this planet to build a legacy and become a part of something great. I hope you realize that one person can and does make a huge difference. One person can build a path, brighten the path, guide others to it and through it, and most importantly, guide one another through the challenges that will surface along the way. Your name is your trademark and your legacy. Let it tell a story of hope, resilience , partnership, and determination. Let your name be mention when telling stories of success and healing. Be and become what you have always dreamed of. I leave you with this quote by Ray Goforth “There are two types of people who will tell you that you cannot make a difference in this world: those who are afraid to try and those who are afraid you will succeed.”\n\nTurn your dreams into reality with Zoilita Grant’s Master Class on the 7 Steps to an Extraordinary Life.

Relationship Issues and Emotional Wounds Most people have unresolved issues with their parents, past lovers, and significant people in their lives – past or present. As adults, many people are still stuck in a pattern of “reaction” to one or both of their parents. Either we are trying to be like them, to live up to their standards, please them, and get the approval we never received as children, or we are rejecting them, trying not to be like them, doing the opposite of what they would want, and basically rebelling. Either way, you’re not completely free to be your most authentic self. You could also have a current relationship with your parents, which has evolved into something completely different than it used to be, yet a part of you might still be living in reaction to the parenting you received as a child. The first step to overcoming this block to success is acknowledging that it exists. Having this block does not mean that you are messed up psychologically. It is possible to work through all of your relationship issues, get “totally complete” with everyone in your life, forgive everyone including yourself, and move forward from a very clear and peaceful center. It is not only possible, but also imperative if you want to reach your full potential. Getting totally complete with all your relationships is not easy to do on your own. It’s a very good idea to get some professional support. With hypnosis and the right intention, you can move through a tremendous amount of emotional baggage in a very brief amount of time.

You have to preach Determination and Perseverance: The protagonist, Tanjiro Kamado, epitomizes determination and perseverance. Despite facing insurmountable challenges, including the tragic transformation of his sister into a demon, Tanjiro remains resolute in his quest to become a Demon Slayer. This teaches us the importance of staying committed to our goals, even when faced with seemingly impossible odds. 2. It’s great to have a companion along your journey Friendship can be more than just a hand on your shoulder when you’re about to break down. This is not just about Tanjiro’s personal journey which was indeed fueled by the deep bonds he formed with his friends and allies. The camaraderie and support among the Demon Slayers highlight the significance of friendship in overcoming challenges. The series underscores the idea that having a strong support system can provide the strength needed to face life’s difficulties. 3. Strong Resilience while facing a loss Loss and tragedy are recurrent themes in “Demon Slayer.” Life is no different and we all know that some time or other we will lose someone we love. Characters like Tanjiro and his friends experience profound grief and heartbreak, yet they find the strength to continue their mission. That’s the sole reason that the series continued as even the creators didn’t want them to give up. The series teaches us that resilience is crucial in navigating life’s hardships and that it’s possible to find purpose even after enduring profound loss. 4. Continuous Self-Improvement can turn into a best skill: Demon Slayers engage in rigorous training to hone their skills and become more proficient in battling demons. This tells us the importance of continuous self-improvement and the pursuit of personal growth. The characters’ dedication to refining their abilities serves as an inspiration for viewers to strive for excellence in their own lives. 5. Nothing beats Compassion and Empathy: Tanjiro’s compassionate nature is a central theme in the series. Despite facing demonic threats, he recognizes the humanity within demons and seeks to understand their pain. This teaches us that these traits have power to foster connection with others. Even those who may seem beyond redemption can connect to it and will seek the power compassion holds. The Demon Slayers confront terrifying demons and life-threatening situations. The series illustrates the importance of facing one’s fears and challenges head-on.\n\nIs this you? You're exactly where you thought you wanted to be. But now that you're here, something is missing. Or maybe you feel like \"you\" are missing, too. Whether it's a place, a job, a relationship or something else, you are not alone. I'm right here with you. I followed my heart and moved to NYC in the fall. At the time, I felt like the city would enliven my creativity and move some stuck and stagnant energy. What I was really longing for was to be who I know I truly am now. And at the time I felt like this city would work it's magic within and around me. The move here was nearly impossible. Logistically and financially it was unreasonable, as many of you know. I used those as excuses for why it was so hard. The impossibility I was actually feeling was my relentless holding on to the plans and beliefs about who I was, what this needed to be and how it needed to happen. And how I would feel when I got to \"the island in the sun where everything works out.\" Yes, I work with my coaching clients on moving beyond the limits of the logical, linear mind and traditional constructs of reality. Co-creating with the universe. Trusting the process to unfold. And I know I have a gift for supporting this process. I do this work because this very approach has transformed my life time and time again (starting my entrepreneurial career chapter, realizing my intuitive gifts, healing from an early-stage terminal cancer diagnosis, getting my menstrual cycle at nearly 40 years old after being told I was post-menopausal at 24). I know it works. It's a thing of mystery and magic. And yet, the reason this is my work with coaching clients is because this is quite literally my own work, too. And so I'm learning the lessons again. This time, far more profoundly. A true dark night of the soul. In these moments when it's hard to know when you'll see the light. Here is the truth: the light is within you. It's not something to search outside of yourself for. The space between who you are now and who you are becoming is Gold. So, if you're finding yourself in one of these \"who am I?\" and \"why am I here?\" moments: Step 1: Accept yourself for being exactly where you are. You are here. This is not good or bad. It just is. You can't change the past. In fact, you are here to learn, to grow, to evolve. Notice the lessons you've been learning. What golden information. Be here. Notice. This is the start of true transformation. - My work is to share not only what I know from past experience, but also what I am learning now. I'd love to know the lessons you're learning about who you're becoming, too."
