        "text": "The disapproval of the Soviet authorities made it increasingly difficult for Tarkovsky to work in Russia, and after making his next film 'Nostalgia' (1983) in Italy he defected to the West in 1984. He remained in exile to make his final film 'The Sacrifice' (1986) in Sweden, and died in December 1986. The final year of his life saw the publication of his book, 'Sculpting in Time'.\n\nTarkovsky's reputation as one of the greatest film directors of recent times rests on the quality and depth of his work. His films are remarkable both for their aesthetic qualities, and for their portrayal of the human spiritual quest. Tarkovsky's ambition was to raise cinema to the level of literature and the fine arts, and few would deny that he achieved this.\n\nThe last years of Tarkovsky's life were not a happy time. Although his defection enabled him to live and work freely in Europe, he never felt at home there, and always longed to be back working in the Russia he loved. At the time he became ill with cancer his work was being semi-suppressed in Russia and the authorities were refusing to allow exit visas for his teenage son and his mother-in-law. The final months of his life brought some happier events, however, when his son and mother-in-law were allowed out of Russia to visit him, and when Gorbachov's policy of 'Perestroika' finally brought him honour in his own country, and his films were shown again in Moscow.\n\nBrief Filmography\n\n1961 The Steamroller and the Violin.

Material about Russian cinema in general, during the time Tarkovsky was producing films, (about 1960 - 1986) is also included.\n\nThe bibliography is intended for use by students of the cinema, or Russian culture, studying Tarkovsky's life and work. The entries for periodical articles and newspaper articles have been arranged chronologically to provide a clear picture of the progress of Tarkovsky's career, showing the chronological relationship between the appearance of his films, and events such as his visits to London, major interviews, and defection. Names of specific films, or groups of films, covered by books and articles have been mentioned in the annotations so that the student can easily find all the material relating to any particular film. The bulk of this bibliography was compiled at the library of the British Film Institute, and I should like thank them for their assistance.\n\nContents\n\nBooks\n\nPeriodical articles\n\nNewspaper articles\n\nSubject index\n\nAuthor index\n\nNewspaper and periodical index\n\nBooks\n\n1.
