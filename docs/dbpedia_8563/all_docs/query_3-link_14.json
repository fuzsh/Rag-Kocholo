Genre? “As cold as the tomb,” Tarkovsky wrote. Even the quick-cut editing style of most filmmakers introduced too much control; “it leaves no ‘air’,” he wrote of Eisenstein’s fast-paced montage. The long take became Tarkovsky’s primary mode of expression, the tool in which he could begin “sculpting in time” (to borrow from the title of his book on cinema) and allow viewers the freedom to breathe. Yet earth, wind, water, and fire infuse all aspects of his imagery, grounding metaphysical visions and emotions in a literally elemental sense of the natural world.\n\nInspired by the writers and artists of his beloved Russia (and by Dostoevsky above all), Tarkovsky finally fled the Soviet Union in 1984, after years of government censorship and interference. He died only two years later, leaving behind a body of work that has only grown in power and influence. “Art must transcend as well as observe,” he wrote; “its role is to bring spiritual vision to bear on reality.” The Soviet Union has long since faded, but Tarkovsky’s art remains.\n\nJason Sanders, Film Note Writer"
