        "text": "Andrei Tarkovsky was a Russian filmmaker, screenwriter, and film theorist. He is remembered as one of the best and the most influential film directors in Russia and the world. His movies were based on metaphysical and spiritual subjects and were close to nature and memory. They were typically slow-paced, with long takes and dreamlike visual imagery. Though his movies got him into issues with the Soviet authorities, they also earned him a lot of laurels at various prestigious film festivals, such as the ‘Cannes Film Festival’ and the ‘Venice Film Festival.’ Due to his troubles with the Soviet authorities, he spent most his life in countries such as Italy and France. He was registered as part of the ‘Latina Refugee Camp’ in Italy. However, in late 1986, the Soviets repented that he had stayed out of the U.S.S.R. in his final years. Posthumously, he was markedly recognized by the Russians for his contribution to filmmaking."
