Andrei Tarkovsky was a Soviet and Russian film director, writer and film theorist known for spiritually and metaphysically themed films. He directed seven feature films in the Soviet Union including Ivan's Childhood, Andrei Rublev, Solaris and Stalker, which were acclaimed internationally but had distribution issues domestically. His films were characterized by long takes and abstract visual styles influenced by his study of international directors. He later emigrated and produced his final two films in Italy and Sweden due to conflicts with Soviet censors over his unconventional films.",
