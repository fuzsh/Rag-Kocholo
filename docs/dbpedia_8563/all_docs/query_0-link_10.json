        "text": "It is difficult to define the best film directors of all time: everyone has their favorites and the value of an artistic work changes with the passage of time and with the transformations of society. What seemed extraordinary yesterday, perhaps because of the fashion and lifestyle of a bygone era, today may no longer have the same value.\n\nThis is by no means a list that seeks to impose an objective and definitive value for the best directors, but a tool to embark on a journey into history of cinema. An art partially devalued and reduced to mere entertainment for several decades now, in which the public is no longer able to distinguish between commercial audiovisual products and art cinema.\n\nUnfortunately, the women who have been able to express themselves through the art of cinema have been few: the possibility of directing has rarely been given to them. But female filmmakers have made fantastic strides over the years, and we’ve seen some inspiring and utterly masterful work over the past few decades.\n\nGeorges Méliès\n\nGeorges Méliès (born Marie-Georges-Jean Méliès; December 8, 1861 – January 21, 1938) was a French illusionist, entrepreneur, actor, filmmaker, screenwriter, and producer. He is considered one of the pioneers of cinema, known for his innovative special effects and the use of fantasy and imagination in his films.\n\nMéliès was born in Paris, France, in 1861. As a young man, he became interested in illusionism and became a skilled magician. In 1888, he opened his own magic theater, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin, in Paris.\n\nIn 1895, Méliès saw the first public screening of a film by the Lumière brothers. He was immediately fascinated by the new technology and began experimenting with cinema.\n\nMéliès’s first film, Le Voyage dans la Lune (1902), is considered one of the first science fiction films. The film is based on Jules Verne’s novel From the Earth to the Moon.\n\nMéliès is known for his innovative special effects. He often used photographic tricks, such as editing, dissolves, and stop-motion, to create realistic and fantastical special effects.\n\nGeorges Méliès is perhaps the most extraordinary and legendary character of the origins of cinema. It was he who developed early cinematographic techniques such as film fades and coloring. Méliès is very fascinated by the presentation of the Lumière brothers on December 28, 1895 at the “Cafè des Capucins”.\n\nHe intends to use the cinema at any cost. After the first projection of moving images in the story he approaches the two brothers to ask to buy one of their sets, but they refuse.\n\nThe film that consecrated Méliès’ success was Journey to the Moon. The public of the time had never actually seen anything like it: at the entrance to the shows many individuals assumed that they were being mocked.\n\nThe success was huge. The film was screened all over the world and several directors made remakes. Cinema had discovered its task of revealing the inner worlds of the imagination.\n\nWatch Méliès films\n\nAlice Guy-Blaché\n\nAlice Guy-Blaché (née Guy; French pronunciation: [alis gi blɑʃe]; 1 July 1873 – 24 March 1968) was a French pioneer filmmaker, screenwriter, producer, and studio director. She is widely considered to be the first woman filmmaker. From 1896 to 1906, she was head of production at Gaumont Film Company, where she directed, wrote, and produced over 2,000 short films. Her films were characterized by their use of innovative special effects, their exploration of social issues, and their humor.\n\nAlice Guy was born in Saint-Mandé, France, on 1 July 1873. She was the daughter of a journalist and a homemaker. Guy developed an interest in photography at a young age and began working as a secretary for Léon Gaumont, the founder of Gaumont Film Company. In 1895, she was given the job of overseeing the company’s new cinematograph camera.\n\nGuy quickly became proficient in using the cinematograph and began making short films. She was given her own production unit in 1896 and became responsible for directing, writing, and producing all of the company’s short films.\n\nGuy’s films were incredibly popular and helped to establish Gaumont as a leading film company. She experimented with a wide variety of genres, including comedies, dramas, and documentaries. She was also a pioneer in the use of special effects, such as double exposure and stop-motion animation.\n\nWatch Alice Guy-Blaché films\n\nBenjamin Christensen\n\nBenjamin Christensen (September 28, 1879 – April 2, 1959) was a Danish film director, screenwriter, and actor. He is considered one of the most important pioneers of Danish cinema, and his films are known for their innovative use of cinematography, editing, and special effects.\n\nChristensen was born in Viborg, Denmark, in 1879. He studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen, but he eventually decided to pursue a career in the theater. He began acting in 1901, and he quickly became one of the most popular stars in Denmark.\n\nIn 1906, Christensen made his directorial debut with the short film Den hvide slavehandel (The White Slave Trade). The film was a critical and commercial success, and it established Christensen as a major talent in the Danish film industry.\n\nChristensen continued to make films throughout the silent film era, and he became known for his innovative use of cinematography, editing, and special effects. His most famous film is Häxan (1922), a silent documentary about the history of witchcraft. The film was groundbreaking for its use of slow motion, multiple exposures, and superimposed images.\n\nOther notable films by Christensen include Blind Justice (1916), a drama about the death penalty, and The Devil’s Circus (1926), a horror film about a man who sells his soul to the devil.\n\nChristensen continued to make films in the sound film era, but he never achieved the same level of success as he did during the silent era. He made a number of films in the 1930s and 1940s, but they were not as well-received as his silent films.\n\nWatch Haxan\n\nBuster Keaton\n\nJoseph Frank Keaton, real name of Buster Keaton, was born in the United States, in Kansas, on October 4, 1895. Like Charlie Chaplin, he is the son of a couple of artists, but less unfortunate. The father has a vaudeville company where the famous saxophonist Mira Keaton and the magician Houdini perform.\n\nLittle Keaton participates in the shows since he was a child and often becomes the protagonist. His reckless performances and falls earned him the nickname “Buster”. His mimicry immediately appears prodigious.\n\nBuster Keaton discovers cinema in 1917. According to Buster, it is the perfect tool to bring his characters to life. He leaves his family and moves to New York at the age of 22, where he meets the actor Roscoe Arbuckle, who specializes in throwing pies in the face.\n\nBuster Keaton’s debut as a director is The High Sign: it’s the story of a tramp looking for his fortune in an amusement park who meets a billionaire and his daughter.\n\nKeaton’s career began to decline in the late 1920s, as the popularity of silent films waned. He continued to make films in the 1930s and 1940s, but they were not as successful as his earlier work.\n\nIn the 1950s, Keaton’s career had a resurgence. He appeared in several films and television shows, and he was given an Honorary Academy Award in 1958.\n\nKeaton is considered one of the greatest comedians of all time. He is known for his innovative physical comedy, his stoic expression, and his ability to create unforgettable characters. His films are still enjoyed by audiences today and continue to inspire filmmakers around the world.\n\nCharlie Chaplin\n\nCharlie Chaplin (born Charles Spencer Chaplin, April 16, 1889 – December 25, 1977) was an English actor, comedian, filmmaker, screenwriter, composer, and pantomime master. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema. Chaplin rose to fame as the screen persona “The Tramp” and is considered one of the best film actors of all time.\n\nChaplin was born in London, England, on April 16, 1889. He was the son of Charles Chaplin Sr., a music hall entertainer, and Hannah Chaplin, a music hall singer. Chaplin’s parents separated when he was three years old, and he was raised by his mother until she was placed in an institution for the mentally ill. Chaplin spent his childhood in workhouses and orphanages.\n\nChaplin began performing as a child, and he made his professional stage debut at the age of nine. He appeared in a variety of stage productions, including pantomimes, music halls, and vaudeville shows. In 1910, Chaplin moved to the United States to join a vaudeville troupe.\n\nHis tramp character becomes a lot more heartbreaking when you realize that Charlie Chaplin himself was an orphan who lived on the street. We all love the outcast and the wanderer must be crowned King of the outcast. Without dialogue, Chaplin had the ability to explore the full range of human feelings.\n\nYou can’t see The Kid without dancing, you can’t enjoy City Lights without rekindling your feeling of romance and you can’t watch The Great Dictator without making sure you reflect and laugh at the absurdity of war and the lust for power.\n\nWatch The Kid\n\nFernand Leger\n\nBorn in 1881, Fernand Leger started out as a draftsman for an architectural firm in Paris in 1903. He was a truly eclectic musician, creator of tapestry and fogged glass animations, decorator, ceramist, sculptor, draftsman, illustrator, costume designer, established developer.\n\nSon of a Norman dog breeder he moved to Paris where he was admitted to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, as well as participating in the Julian Academy and also in the Louvre. In 1911 he exhibited the painting Nudes in the Woods at the Salon des Indépendants together with other works by his colleagues Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Jean Metzinger.\n\nThe discussion and also the debate that spread the term cubism. The development of Fernand Leger’s design is fueled by the dynamic Parisian creative climate: he is inspired by him Impressionism, the Fauves and even the paintings of Paul Cézanne.\n\nDW Griffith\n\nDavid Wark Griffith, also known as D.W. Griffith, was an American film director, producer, and screenwriter who is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of cinema. He is credited with developing many of the narrative and technical techniques that are still used in filmmaking today, and his films had a profound influence on the development of the art form.\n\nGriffith was born in La Grange, Kentucky, on January 22, 1875. He was the son of a colonel in the Confederate Army, and he grew up in poverty after the Civil War. Griffith began working as a newspaper reporter and playwright in the early 1890s, and he moved to New York City in 1900 to pursue a career in theater.\n\nIn 1908, Griffith began working as a director for the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, a pioneer in the production of short films. Griffith quickly rose through the ranks of the company, and he began to experiment with innovative filmmaking techniques. He developed the use of close-ups, long shots, and parallel editing to create more complex and engaging narratives.\n\nGriffith has directed dozens of films, but Birth of a Nation is his best known work. Despite all its successes, the film also has some racial stereotypes. It is a pity that such an extraordinary historical film from a technological point of view also has such a discriminatory vision. Later films such as Intolerance and even Broken Blossoms will certainly attempt to ask for forgiveness and deal with these transgressions, but with little success.\n\nWatch Intolerance\n\nFW Murnau\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Murnau, also known as F.W. Murnau, was a German film director, producer, and screenwriter who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of cinema. He is best known for his expressionist films, such as Nosferatu (1922) and The Last Laugh (1924), which explored themes of alienation, anxiety, and the human condition.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nMurnau was born in Bielefeld, Germany, on December 28, 1888. He came from a wealthy family and studied art and literature at the University of Münster. After graduating, he worked as a stage manager and director before entering the film industry in 1913.\n\nExpressionist films\n\nMurnau’s early films were made in the expressionist style, which was characterized by its use of distorted sets, exaggerated acting, and subjective camerawork. His most famous expressionist film is Nosferatu, a silent horror film about a vampire who preys on the residents of a small town. The film is considered a masterpiece of expressionist cinema and is still admired for its its haunting atmosphere and its innovative use of visual effects.\n\nFW Murnau was another German immigrant to Hollywood, which went through the dramatic glow of German Expressionist with somewhat safer commercial films shot in the American period.\n\nFaust is a story of principles that is just as terrifying as anything else in Nosferatu. And, perhaps his most successful, Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans won Best Picture at the Oscars. And an immense masterpiece like The Last Laugh. A film that took the history of cinema to the next level.\n\nWatch The Last Laugh\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer (February 3, 1889 – March 20, 1968) was a Danish film director and screenwriter who is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in cinema history. Known for his austere and uncompromising style, Dreyer’s films often explored themes of faith, morality, and the human condition. His most celebrated works include The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), Day of Wrath (1943), and Ordet (1955).\n\nBorn in Copenhagen, Denmark, Dreyer began working as a journalist before entering the film industry in 1913. He initially made short films and documentaries, but it was with his feature debut, The Parson’s Widow (1920), that he established his reputation as a serious filmmaker.\n\nMaster of Silent Cinema\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Dreyer produced a series of acclaimed silent films that cemented his position as a master of the medium. His masterpiece, The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), is a haunting and visually stunning portrayal of Joan of Arc’s trial and execution. The film’s stark black-and-white cinematography and use of close-ups and slow-motion create a powerful and moving experience.\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer is one of the most important directors in world cinema. Master of a very rigorous, Spartan and moral style, he deals with fundamental themes of the human spirit such as trust, love and death in his films. Dreyer has always denied the easy shortcut of industrial cinema.\n\nHis films did not have a great success with the public and were also long resisted by censorship as in the case of The Passion of Joan of Arc, which was outlawed by the Catholic Church. Another amazing Dreyer film is one of best horror ever made: Vampyr. Several modern directors have clearly stated that they were influenced and inspired by its design.\n\nIda Lupino\n\nIda Lupino was a British-American actress, director, screenwriter, and producer.

October (Ten Days That Shook the World) showed a whole revolution going on. And, of course, as you may have seen in every course of history of cinema, the Odessa staircase sequence in Battleship Potemkin will surely be considered the greatest example of montage and grandiose cinematic staging.\n\nWatch Battleship Potemkin\n\nDziga Vertov\n\nBorn in Poland in 1896, Dziga Vertov is one of the most important directors of the Russian avant-garde.

Friends and even colleagues were surprised that he wanted to continue working despite his serious condition.\n\nHowever Jean Vigo did not want to stop, for him finishing the shooting of the film was a real existential mission. He knew he was sick as well as he understood that his time was running out.

Many of his films had problems in Hollywood: the topics covered were taboo at that time. Drug addiction in Man with the Golden Arm, rape in Anatomy of a Murder and homosexuality in Storm over Washington (Advise & amp; Consent).\n\nHis reputation as a choleric, violent and arrogant man helped make him an authoritarian and legendary figure at the same time, but perhaps it was just a strategic attitude to carry out his productions and limit the intrusiveness of the executives of the Studios.

Among his close friends from the university period are the poet Federico Garcia Lorca and Salvador Dalì, the surrealist painter with whom he will develop a long association.\n\nHe discovers the films of Buster Keaton and Fritz Lang and works in Paris as an assistant to the director Jean Epstein.

Wells’ The War of the Worlds, which caused widespread panic among listeners who believed that an alien invasion was taking place.\n\nWhen Orson Welles created Citizen Kane, it was a curse as well as a real blessing. Upon release, the film was not immediately hailed as the greatest film ever made. The path of the films later became an uphill battle for Welles. Interference at work required him to become a independent filmmaker and also spent the next 3 years finishing the films he left unfinished.\n\nWelles continued to direct, act, and produce films throughout his career. However, he never again achieved the same level of success as he did with Citizen Kane.

These films explored themes such as violence, revenge, and destiny.\n\nIt is not necessary to understand the Japanese culture or be a scholar of the country’s Sengoku period to appreciate what Akira Kurosawa’s work indicates. The thing is, Kurosawa has taken stories that are incredibly unique and also made them globally relevant. His stories took motifs typical of his own culture but also of Shakespeare and discovered a message that has resonated throughout the world.\n\nOf all the directors on this list, perhaps no one has had as much global influence on cinema as Mr. Kurosawa. From his impressive samurai like Yojimbo and Seven Samurai to his contemporary dramatization like Ikiru and The Bad Sleep Well, there is something we can all feel from his work.\n\nBilly Wilder\n\nSamuel “Billy” Wilder was born on June 22, 1906, in Sucha, Austria.

He made his directorial debut with The Major and the Minor (1942), but his breakthrough film came with Double Indemnity, a noir thriller that he also co-wrote.\n\nBilly Wilder has managed to work within the studio system, as well as still giving his movies a distinct point of view and personality. It helped that he was also a writer, however, regardless of the subject, Billy Wilder always told his stories consistently.\n\nWe can’t think of Film Noir without his Indemnity , his haunting meta-drama Sunset Blvd. showed a dark heart at the center of popularity, and so did his funny comedy Some Like It Hot is close to the masterpiece. Don’t forget hers dramas raw and sincere Days lost (The Lost Weekend) and also The Apartment.\n\nFederico Fellini\n\nFederico Fellini was born on January 20, 1920, in Rimini, Italy, to a modest family. He showed an early interest in drawing and cinema, and began working as a cartoonist and illustrator for the newspaper Il Resto del Carlino.\n\nIn 1939, he moved to Rome to study art, but soon became involved in the world of cinema. In 1943, he began working as an assistant director for Roberto Rossellini, and in 1945 he made his directorial debut with the short film The Voice of the Moon.\n\nFellini began to gain attention with his second film, I Vitelloni (1953), a satirical portrait of Italian youth in the postwar era.

Explaining is accessory, the adjective that comes to mind is “wonderful”. La Dolce Vita is a figurative journey into an era that the film itself transforms into myth and reality, just as looking Rome seems to enter the most important painting museum.\n\nI Vitelloni is a story of youth training, just as 8 1/2 is a poem about the creative process, about the mysterious labyrinth that is the human psyche. Probably no one has created as many masterpieces as Federico Fellini, reaching a very high peak, where the great artists of human history meet.\n\nIngmar Bergman\n\nBorn on 14 July 1918 in Uppsala in Sweden, Ingmar Bergman was just one of the most important filmmakers of the cinematic history. His filmography has a severe coherence in exploring the torments of the human being. Among his dramas there are some of the most significant movie works of all time.\n\nBergman’s breakthrough film came in 1951 with Summer with Monika, a coming-of-age story about a young couple’s summer romance. The film was a critical and commercial success, and it established Bergman as a major new talent in Swedish cinema.\n\nIn the years that followed, Bergman directed a series of increasingly acclaimed films, including The Seventh Seal (1957), Wild Strawberries (1957), Fanny and Alexander (1982), and Saraband (2003). His films were often characterized by exploration of difficult moral dilemmas, and their use of symbolism and allegory.\n\nIngmar Bergman is a man who has lived much longer in dimension of dreams than in reality. He further explored the facts that took place in his inner world rather than those of the outdoors. The exploration of the dream world brought him very close to Federico Fellini, with whom he was a good friend and with whom he was confronted several times.\n\nWhile Fellini represents the crazy, funny and grotesque side of the dream, Bergman is the explorer of the darker and more tormented side of the human being who sinks into nothingness and the lack of meaning and identity.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot (November 20, 1907 – January 12, 1977) was a French film director, screenwriter, and producer.
