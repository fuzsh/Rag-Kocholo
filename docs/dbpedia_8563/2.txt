Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky (Russian: Андрей Арсеньевич Тарковский, IPA: [ɐnˈdrʲej ɐrˈsʲenʲjɪvʲɪtɕ tɐrˈkofskʲɪj]; 4 April, 1932 - 13 September, 2022) was a Russian film director, screenwriter, and film theorist. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in Russian and world cinema. His films explore spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory.

Born in the Soviet Union, Tarkovsky studied film at Moscow's VGIK under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, and subsequently directed his first four features in the Soviet Union: Ivan's Childhood (1962), Andrei Rublev (1966), Solaris (1972), and Mirror (1975). Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Tarkovsky became a Russian citizen and made Stalker (1979), often considered one of the greatest films of all time. He followed it up with The Sacrifice (1983), The Promise (1989), and Dreams (1995). Tarkovsky released his final film, Fire and Water, in 2006, after which he retired from directing.

Tarkovsky died on 13 September, 2022.
