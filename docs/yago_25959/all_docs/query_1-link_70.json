        "text": "Creation\n\nCrystal Chappell played Olivia Spencer on the long-running CBS daytime drama, Guiding Light, from 1999 until the September 18, 2009 network ending. She won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Daytime Drama for her work as Olivia in 2002 and was nominated again in the same category in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, she earned her first nomination in the Outstanding Lead Actress category and her second in 2010.\n\nIn 2009, after Guiding Light was cancelled, Chappell, with help from her writing partner and co-producer Kim Turrisi, decided to create Venice: The Series, based around the popular romance between her character, Olivia Spencer, and co-star Jessica Leccia's character, Natalia Rivera Aitoro, also known by the portmanteau \"Otalia\". However, for copyright reasons, the names of the two actresses' characters are changed, and there is no official connection to Guiding Light.\n\nAlthough Chappell's character in the show is an openly gay woman, the show is not a \"gay web series\" but rather a show that \"embodies all kinds of people, with all kinds of issues\".\n\nChappell heavily publicized the series through the social networking sites Twitter and Facebook.\n\nProduction\n\nThe web series is set in, and filmed in, Venice Beach, California, USA. It is filmed digitally.\n\nEach episode of Season 1 is 6â€“10 minutes long, while episodes from subsequent seasons run approximately 15 minutes.\n\nCast and characters\n\nVenice: The Series stars Crystal Chappell as Gina, a designer and a gay woman, and Chappell's love interest from Guiding Light, Jessica Leccia, this time as Ani, Gina's love interest. Some of Chappell's and Leccia's former Guiding Light co-stars also appear in the series, including Tina Sloan, Gina Tognoni as Sami and Jordan Clarke as The Colonel. Other Venice cast members include daytime actress Hillary B. Smith of One Life to Live as Guya, Nadia Bjorlin as Lara, Galen Gering as Owen, Gina's brother, Michelle N. Carter as Michele, Lesli Kay as Tracy, Michael Sabatino, Chappell's husband, as Alan, and Robert Newman as an old boyfriend of Gina's. Other cast members include Shawn Christian, Eric Martsolf and Molly Burnett from Days of Our Lives.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe first three seasons were released for free, and are viewable, on the video sharing website YouTube. The fourth season is available on the show's website, and requires a paid subscription.\n\nDVDs of past seasons of the show are also available for sale online at the website.\n\nReception and awards\n\nIn 2011, Venice: The Series won the first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Short Format Daytime, and won again in 2014 for Outstanding New Approaches Drama Series. The series was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Digital Daytime Drama Series in 2017."
