        "text": "This is the thirteenth in an irregular feature where we will report updates on what cast members of Guiding Light are doing now.\n\nThere is so much going on right now that I’ve been holding off posting this planning to get it all caught up.

He replied, “she’s fantastic.”\n\nRobert Newman (Josh Lewis) shared a bald photo of himself on Twitter, straight from playing Daddy Warbucks in a major regional production of Annie (No, no THAT Annie – See previous cast updates for more information). http://yfrog.com/n03j0j\n\nElizabeth Keifer (Blake Marler #5) is in the new movie Morning Glory.

They are aiming to raise $15,000 for Doctors Without Borders in honor of both the character and the actor (who asked fans not to send him any more presents). When I write this they were up to $11,500. This is a worthy cause and I support and applaud the effort to create something good out of this tragedy. I also salute the fans gathering the money because I’ve done that for group donations before and it’s really a lot of work. http://bit.ly/9xS7VB Since my initial write up they have passed $15,000 and are now trying for $20,000.\n\nClick on the Posted in “GL Cast Update” category below for more posts about keeping up with the Springfielders.\n\nI accidentally came across an old issue and this jumped out at me as something to share. This is from the July 29, 2008 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\n“Jeva” Wedding Redux\n\nOn the heels of their unexpected smooch, Josh and Reva’s closeness continues this week, much to a jealous Cassie’s chagrin.\n\nThe duo is swept up in memories of their past and even recite their old wedding vows to each other as they watch Mark, Jolene, and the rest of the film crew re-create their 1989 Cross Creek ceremony. “I hope everyone will be as moved by it as Robert [Newman, Josh] and I were,” says Kim Zimmer (Reva) about revisiting the classic Guiding Light moment. “It’s a real gift to the Josh and Reva fans out there.”\n\nFor Reva, however, it’s bittersweet. “She’s reminded of all the love that existed on that day, in that place…always!” sighs Zimmer. Then, Josh makes a shocking admission, saying it was a mistake to leave Reva and that he can’t go back to Cassie after all that’s happened. “Josh becomes very moved and I think realizes just what he’s missing,” she adds.\n\nAfter, Cassie and Jeffery are stunned to find Josh and Reva in another lip lock (as their wedding song plays). Upset, Cassie informs Josh it’s over, so they can say goodbye and he packs his bags. “Their ‘trust’ issue is also a communication issue,” shrugs Newman. They are on different planets right now.”\n\nRead the article and see the accompanying photo in Soap Opera Digest.\n\nAugust 21, 2009 – Ok, so is Shayne saying he mistook mid-40s(?) Edmund for Jonathan???? That’s some family resemblance or Shayne is REALLY out of it. I guess he means he thought Jonathan was someone working for Edmund, but that was not clear at all. It’s a great brawl though and I still think Jonathan deserves it for all the stupid stuff he’s done. I love it when Jonathan says “Yep” to Shayne something in the tone made me laugh out loud. A little goes a long way though and I was ready pretty soon for Shayne to punch him again. Apparently Shayne and Jonathan never met before and Shayne didn’t previously ask Reva many questions about Jonathan or his history with the Royals or his time in Springfield. [Minute 0, Minute 10] Jonathan finally tells Reva the “Jeffery Museum” is weird. [Minute 17] Later Shayne comes back and overhears Jonathan’s part of a phone call with Jeffery. Shayne assumes it’s Edmund on the other end. Dueling Lines of the Day = Jonathan: “You definitely are Josh’s son.” They admit they don’t like each other, but have to pretend for Reva’s sake. Shayne To Reva: “John Deere here helped me find it.” [Minute 30] (I almost forgot. Jonathan and Dinah had an affair, too. Maybe Dinah was trying to be GL’s Brooke Logan, something else to bring the brothers closer. Boy I really have to buy that sarcasm punctuation mark.)\n\nBilly is starting to court Vanessa and they are both being REALLY cute. [Minute 1, Minute 20, Minute 23, Minute 31] Billy goes in for a good night kiss and expects more, but Vanessa shuts him down with a reminder that it’s only their “first” date. They both had a great time though. [Minute 32] Earlier, Vanessa ran into Olivia and talks with excitement about her upcoming date with Billy. She’s being pretty chummy considering she knows Olivia pushed Billy off the wagon the last time he fell and the breakup of Olivia’s marriage to Vanessa’s son Bill almost crushed him. [Minute 7]\n\nBuzz and Cyrus are still working on the Jenna research. Mel drops off some final paperwork clearing Cyrus of everything and sees on the forms it’s his birthday. Cyrus: “Does that mean I’m free to travel now?” Mel: “Yes, if that’s what you want.” Frank: (Dryly) “Oh, happy day.” [Minute 2] Later Cyrus books a flight to Australia for tomorrow. [Minute 33] Blake sends Ashlee over to interview Buzz for the book. [Minute 8] Buzz found Frank’s dating profile and gives the appropriate reaction. [Minute 13] Blake talks to Frank about his finding his place with Olivia, Natalia, and the baby, but doesn’t bring up her experience with Rick, Ross, and the twins which would have been highly relevant. [Minute 22] Buzz tells Blake she’ll never find the true love she had with Ross again, but she needs to live in the moment and she could find something wonderful. Hmmm. Live in the moment to BLAKE. Yeah, she’s never thought that one. [Minute 26] Blake decides to contact Frank through his online dating site. She’s still wearing Ross’ ring while she does it though. [Minute 33]\n\nIt’s a new day and Natalia is taking round 2 in making everybody agree to her plan about the baby and say it’s the best one ever. She’s working on Olivia and Frank. [Minute 5] Mel is making cookies for Cyrus and Natalia is making cookies for Olivia, together. [Minute 15]Olivia isn’t biting. She tells Natalia she can’t believe her and sends her home. [Minute 23] Natalia comes back and Olivia sends her away again. [Minute 35] Frank wants to get legal papers drawn up for custody and rights about the baby. Natalia is not overjoyed. [Minute 27] Olivia is irritated with Blake once she realizes Blake knew about the pregnancy before Natalia left and keeps asking why Natalia couldn’t come to her. [Minute 16] Mel takes Cyrus the cookies for his birthday. Then grabs Cyrus twice and kisses him hard. [Minute 18] Then they break the bed. Mel gets spooked and backs off. [Minute 23] Olivia brought the flowers Natalia gave her to Reva since Blake said give them to someone to cheer them up. Reva doesn’t let Olivia know about Jonathan, despite their close connection (adopted aunt). [Minute 29] They really seem on good terms now though.\n\nThe Comings Next Week features some Phillip, Mallet is ready to walk away from Marina, an understanding is reached between Jonathan and Shayne, and Cyrus and Remy are up to something.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/GLAug212009"
