        "text": "Dinah:\n\nDo you know how sick and twisted I am? I'd just like to explain it to you. I have played Princess Cassie for so long that I actually started to believe I was her. That everything she had should be mine. And at the same time, I hated her for taking everything, everything that should be mine in my dream. So being her and hating her is what my life has become. That's who I am. And I didn't see that until last night. And I am nothing without Cassie.\n\nBill:\n\nStop it. Listen to me. Listen to me. That's the whiskey talking. That is not you.\n\nDinah:\n\nNo. It is.\n\nBill:\n\nNo, it isn't.\n\nDinah:\n\nBill, I saw it in your eyes and I saw it in Daddy's eyes when you guys did not care, you were very excited to pack me off to Italy, so you could keep me away from Cassie and she could go on with her life.\n\nBill:\n\nYou know what? This is what it's all about. It's you getting a fresh start. That's what you need. That's all you need, Dinah.\n\nDinah:\n\nShe has everything that I have ever wanted, and I have needed that to stay alive.\n\nDinah:\n\nWell, don't you want to hear my tale of woe?\n\nEdmund:\n\nDinah, I don't have time to hear it right now.\n\nDinah:\n\nOh, okay. Well, just kick me to the kerb, like everybody else has. It's cool.\n\nEdmund:\n\nLook, Dinah, I've been where you are, wanting to live someone else's life, willing to do just about anything to have it. It's no good. It doesn't work. My obsession with my brother Richard cost me everything I cared about. I hate to see you make the same mistake.\n\nDinah:\n\nMy whole life's been a mistake, Eddie.\n\nEdmund:\n\nIt's not a mistake, Dinah. Take it from someone who's been there. Your life hasn't even begun yet.\n\n[confronting Harley about her goodbye letter to him]\n\nGus:\n\nOh, so this is nice. This is like a \"Dear John\" letter. You're going to kiss me off with a letter?\n\nHarley:\n\nI couldn't figure out any other way to do this.\n\nGus:\n\nYou make the decision without me, you don't even consult me, and this is what you want to do?\n\nHarley:\n\nWell, you said you weren't going to be in court today. So...\n\nGus:\n\nYeah, I'm not going to court. I'm not going to stand there and watch you throw your life away.\n\nHarley:\n\nThat's fine, but I'm still going through with this. Ten years. Ten. I mean, even with time off with good behavior, that's a really long time. So my life will be in the state pen and yours will be here. That's the reality.\n\nGus:\n\nI don't really have a reality without you in my life, okay? So if they send you to Vailsburg, I'll just buy the house next door to prison.\n\nHarley:\n\nNo.\n\nGus:\n\nIf they send you out of state, I'll just... I'll hit the road. I'll be the first one in, the last one out every single visiting day. You can count on it.\n\nHarley:\n\nThat is not...\n\nGus:\n\nIn fact, I'll get a job. I'll get a job...\n\nHarley:\n\n... a life for you. You deserve more than that, Gus.\n\nGus:\n\nI'm not walking out of your life.\n\nHarley:\n\nWell, you have to! Okay? You have to. Because I can't live with anything else. None of this is the way it's supposed to be, okay? None of this is the way I wanted it. Starting with Phillip. But he's dead, okay? And now we are, too. And I've got to go.\n\nGus:\n\nWait a second. Just wait a second.\n\nHarley:\n\nYou know what? I don't want to be late for court. And this is the part you said you couldn't watch. So don't.\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nHey, partner, how is it going, man?\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nHey, I've been looking for you. You need to come with me. You've got to help me.\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nThe problem is you.\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\n[Locks Gus in a jail cell] And now the problem is fixed.\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nOpen the door.\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nSo what did you tell Harley?\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nOpen the door. If you don't open the door, I'm going to beat you senseless.\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nWhat was the plan, go down to the courthouse and slip into the hearing room, and then you're going to shoot him in the head in the alleyway?\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nWe are not talking about a sane man.\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nYou remember what we were talking about. Taking Alan down any way...\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nAre you Mr. Romantic all of a sudden?\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nCan you think of a better way to spend New Year's Eve? Listen, partner, cool down. I'm going to get some coffee.\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nOpen this door!\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nI'm not dealing with a sane man. This is where you belong.\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nListen to me! Listen to me.\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nYou're going to stay right where you are, you're not going to do anybody any harm. Calm down.\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nBye Mallet.\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\n[Beth has kidnapped Alan and Gus and is holding them in a cabin] Did you ever see that movie \"Ghost,\" where the guy dies and his wife is all vulnerable, and then the best friend moves in on her. That is so Mallet. He's just honing in on Harley because she's so vulnerable.\n\nAlan Spaulding #3:\n\nWhat's a six-letter word for \"I told you so\"?\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\n[spelling] S-H-U-T-U-P. [yells] Shut up!\n\nAlan Spaulding #3:\n\nThat is six letters, but it doesn't really fit here. Why are you looking at me that way? You are the one who landed us in this mess.\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nNo, no, this is not my fault.\n\nAlan Spaulding #3:\n\nMay I remind you, Gus, you kidnapped me.\n\nGus Aitoro:\n\nYou were going to kill Harley the minute you came out of the courtroom on New Year's Eve. Why don't you just admit it?\n\nAlan Spaulding #3:\n\nAnd in the end, I wasn't the man you needed to worry about after all, was I?\n\nHarlan Billy:\n\nI should hit you with my other hand. [laughs] Just kidding, Sea-Bass.\n\nOlivia Spencer Lewis Spaulding Spaulding Lewis:\n\nSea-Bass?\n\nHarlan Billy:\n\nYeah, Sea-Bass, my buddy here.\n\nOlivia Spencer Lewis Spaulding Spaulding Lewis:\n\nYour buddy?\n\nHarlan Billy:\n\nYeah.\n\nSebastian Hulce:\n\nWe sort of bonded.\n\nHarlan Billy:\n\nYeah, we did. I actually went to punch him, but he's a dodgy fellow, this guy. I ended up hitting the plaster.\n\nSebastian Hulce:\n\nPlaster man.\n\nHarlan Billy:\n\nYeah, that's right. No hard feelings, though. He gave me a ride here in his fancy car. That's pretty big of him, because I wanted to turn him into mincemeat.\n\nSebastian Hulce:\n\nWhat are pals for?\n\nHarlan Billy:\n\n[laughs] I'll tell you something, you're a kidnapper and a psycho, but you're a hell of a guy.\n\nOlivia Spencer Lewis Spaulding Spaulding Lewis:\n\nWhat are you on?\n\nHarlan Billy:\n\nI have no idea, sweetheart, but the world is a far, far better place.\n\nSebastian Hulce:\n\nDon't knock it, Liv. This could be the beginning of a very beautiful friendship.\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nA joke, not that funny. See, that was a joke. Come here. Come here. I asked you to move in with me because I like you. And I like being around you. And I kind of like myself when I'm around you. And I asked you to move in with me because, um... I'm kind of selfish, I just don't want to share you with anybody else. And I asked you to move in with me because I've been alone for a long time, and I'm starting to realize I don't have to be alone. I can share my life with someone. And I would like that someone to be you. I mean, you know, share my life-- it's not much. I do have a cell phone that works. And if yours doesn't, I'll put you on my friends and family plan. And as far as Harley goes, I don't want her on my family plan, as great as she is. And, believe it or not, I don't think she had a play in this, not in the slightest. So please, please say yes. Because if you don't, it's going to kill me. And then I'm going to have to kill you.\n\nDinah:\n\n[Laughing] Yes. [Screams]\n\nA.C. Mallet:\n\nOh, oh. Okay, I'm going to go back to hiding my feelings now, okay?\n\nDinah:\n\nNo, don't you dare. No!\n\n[first lines]\n\nBill Lewis:\n\nYeah, yeah, no, no. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Of course, it's a little tough for all of us but we're-- you know, we're getting through it, just keep on moving. That's all you've got to do. Just stay focused. But, listen, just tell me, what do we got to do to get the deal done, huh? Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, no. There it is. Two points. Come on, Bill Lewis. There it is. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, just tell me, are we good to go in Singapore? Great. Mm-hmm? Mm, yes. Okay. Well, euro, pesos, yen, dollar, name your price. Okay. All righty. Yeah. Okay. Let me call you back, all right? All right. Thanks. Oh, hey there, Dad. What's up?"
