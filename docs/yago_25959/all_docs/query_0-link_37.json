        "text": "Today’s post is about The Young and the Restless.\n\nTraci Abbott – Author\n\nTraci Abbott had many false starts in careers, including as a singing star that for quite awhile revisited with once a year on screen concert featuring everyone who ever pretended to have a singing career on the show. Lauren Fenmore (her arch nemesis who was a more successful singer) was another big singer at these events.\n\nHowever, Traci eventually settled on a writing career. Traci Abbott published at least two novels. Echoes of the Past was a novelized account of her life of living in her sister Ashley Abbott’s shadow. Her second novel was called Epitaph for a Lover. Traci was working on a third novel when she moved to New York. No further progress was reported on air and the title for the third book wasn’t included in the reference I found. Later I found another title, I’m not sure whether this was the third book she was working on when she moved to New York or if this was in fact a fourth novel, but thanks to E LeBrun we know there was a book by her used on a set called On the Wings of Idiots.\n\n2 New Books\n\nThis last year Traci published two different books. The first one was a novel that they acted out in black and white fantasy sequences during their flirtation of having a Traci/Cane romance. The novel was published as Stolen Lockets and Broken Hearts.\n\nThe second book was a nonfiction book about the Abbott family history that she co-wrote with her brother Jack. It was also a long term story. Although there was A LOT of Abbott family history, the main focus was apparently Dinah had an affair with Stuart Brooks while she was in high school (which I don’t think Stuart would have done). That she got pregnant and gave the baby up for adoption. This was an excuse to bring Theo in as sort of an Abbott.\n\nI’m very glad they are bringing Traci back as a writer and I hope she has another book underway soon. Still waiting for a Work In Progress mention guys!\n\nThere are a lot of fake books, check out these not just from The Young and the Restless, but other soap operas.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHere’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.

This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nEverything Coming Up Bauers\n\nI recently got a copy of a Guiding Light Storyline Proposal from April 1969. It was written by Soderberg-Summer. The story prospective covers the several future major stories. One is the set up for the Ed – Leslie (Rick’s mom) – Mike (Awesomesauce) triangle. I still have 0 opinion of her. Anyone who marries Ed when Mike is available (as he was when she married Ed) is a complete and total idiot. Another big storyline which is covered lightly here is Bill Bauer’s death. They’re talking about the expected aftermath for Bert and the rest of the Bauer family. There is also talk about Charlotte Wearing including her car accident and potential future. They recommend that when Mike will marry Charlotte that Hope and Charlotte will make each other miserable as step-daughter and step-mother.\n\nSara McIntyre\n\nThe other story they dig into is the Sara McIntyre’s storyline. It’s weird to me that I watch old episodes and I remember every single other character on the episode, sometimes the action in the episode, but I have NO idea who this Sara is. She works at the hospital. She is in a relationship with Joe Wexler and they are bringing in a new character Lee Gantry. When they were doing quick episode cuts for the last big anniversary was of Gantry being killed. They lay out a year plus of potential story.\n\nFletcher Family Farewell\n\nThey are also starting to wrap up the Fletcher family. Peggy Fletcher and her son will be the last one standing, but they’re talking about moving on to the Wexlers as a replacement core family for the Fletchers.\n\nEd’s Self-Knowledge\n\nI hope to retype the entire document so I can share it at some point, but for now I wanted to give you a rundown because of one sentence. I think it’s a critical piece of understanding about Ed Bauer almost all the way through his run on the show.\n\nThrough Jackson and Bert, Leslie is pulled back toward Ed to help Ed during this crucial period in his life. Ed, at the same time, has begun to discover the secret of his sickness — it’s his refusal to become an adult and assume the responsibilities built into the condition of adulthood. Bill’s death may contribute to a hastening of this realization. Bert’s reliance on Ed can also contribute to his growth as an adult.\n\nEd also develops a deep insight into Leslie — and he knows she is trying to help him — and this time, he can ACCEPT her help. This acceptance is what traps Leslie.\n\nWe will play a period of time when Leslie is torn between the two-men [Ed and Mike] — both worthy men, and in their own ways, both needy men.\n\nAnd the bolded sentence I think clearly shows what’s the matter with Ed, why he drinks, why (like his father) he’s always looking for another woman to solve his problems, and why he’ll never be as awesomesauce as Mike.\n\nRick Comes Along\n\nWe also get a rundown on how we got Rick, I mean then Freddie.\n\n[Leslie] returns to Ed on a tentative basis — but a strange thing happens, Ed seduces is own wife during this interval period.\n\nLeslie becomes pregnant.\n\nEd is overjoyed by her pregnancy — overjoyed for Leslie — who has always wanted a child, and overjoyed for himself because this is the final proof of his maturity. He wants the child as much as Leslie ever wanted a child.\n\n—\n\nLeslie thinks the child is Ed’s — and now she is committed to Ed.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
