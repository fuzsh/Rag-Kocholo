[ [http://www.cbs.com/daytime/gl/about/showinfo/ About the show \"Guiding Light\"] at CBS.Com]\n\n__TOC__\n\nhow development\n\nAgnes Nixon wanted to see social issues worked into the plot, and set the tone for much of the material used during the 1960s. One story, which involved Bert's battle with uterine cancer gave many female viewers the incentive to see their gynecologists.\n\nIn 1966, Nixon left the show to create the ABC series, \"One Life to Live.\"\n\nOn September 11, 1967, the show was first broadcast in color.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the focus of the show slowly moved to Bill and Bert's children, Mike and Ed. Their lives and loves provided high drama for many years. Other popular characters of the time included Robin Lang Bowden Fletcher. Through the mid-to-late 1950s, Robin had feuded with her stepmother Kathy. By 1958, Kathy had been killed when bicycling children accidentally pushed her wheelchair into oncoming traffic and CBS was deluged with protest letters. In 1967, Robin was struggling with her own stepson, Johnny Fletcher, as well as her fears that her husband loved another woman. The group of writers at that time recycled a similar story conclusion by having Robin throw herself into oncoming traffic, another move that was unpopular with viewers.\n\nAround this same time, in a bit of \"retroactive continuity\", the show's writers changed the name and location of the series' locale from Selby Flats, which had been described as a suburb of Los Angeles, to Springfield, U.S.A.--no state designated, but apparently in the Midwest. Cedars Hospital (so named to suggest the real Cedars of Lebanon Hospital--now Cedars-Sinai--in Los Angeles), introduced in Selby Flats on radio in the 1940s, remained a central location in Springfield. Bill and Bert's younger son Ed began his residency at Cedars Hospital in Springfield under the tutelage of Dr. Stephen Jackson. Their older son, attorney Mike Bauer, had become estranged from his overbearing parents after his young wife, Julie Conrad Bauer had become mentally unstable and later committed suicide, and had moved a year earlier with his daughter Hope to Bay City (the characters crossing over to \"Another World\"; they would return to \"The Guiding Light\" in 1968). Bert also had to deal with Bill's affair with his secretary, Maggie Scott, and Ed's turn to alcoholism when he discovered his father's affair. (Bert and Ed would fight over this when Bert forgave Bill, but Ed did not.) Maggie had trouble herself when her husband, Ben Scott, turned up alive after having been presumed killed in the Korean War. Maggie and Ben had a teenaged daughter named Peggy. Her romantic troubles, first with teenage gang member, Marty Dillman, and later with Johnny Fletcher, served as much of the story in the late 1960s. Marty Dillman eventually wound up being murdered and his pregnant wife Peggy was wrongly put on trial for it. Mike defended and exonerated her of the crime. Ben would die of a heart attack in early 1968, followed by Maggie dying herself from an intestinal ailment a few months later (Ed had operated on her and felt guilty that she had died during the operation). Peggy ended up being treated as a daughter by Bert.\n\n1967 also saw the arrival of Dr. Sara McIntyre, the former girlfriend of Dr. Paul Fletcher who was already married to Robin. Sara was a gifted psychologist who was able to help Bert cope with her husband's presumed death in a plane crash in 1969. In her personal life, Sara seemed to have less luck. First Sara was gaslighted by a woman claiming to be her long thought deceased niece, Tracey Delmar, until Sara found out that \"Tracey\" was actually was woman named Charlotte Waring who had a past with several men who Sara would find herself involved with (Charlotte would be the one who would turn over evidence to Mike Bauer that would exonerate Peggy). Later, although attracted to Dr. Joe Werner, Sara instead married the charming Lee Gantry. Joe would find himself involved in a rebound relationship with Charlotte (Joe and Charlotte had dated while Joe was in medical school), until Charlotte became more attracted to the now single and available Mike Bauer. In an attempt to embezzle Sara's money, Lee and his housekeeper, Miss Mildred Foss, soon began orchestrating a series of events to make Sara believe she was going insane.\n\nAlso in 1969, the rich businessman Stanley Norris was introduced. Stanley was divorced from his first wife, cookbook writer Barbara. Barbara was left alone to raise their three children, Kenneth (\"Ken\"), Andrew (\"Andy\"), and Holly. Stanley would soon divorce his second wife, Kit Vested, when she found out that he was carrying on affairs with several other women. Stanley would soon be murdered, shot to death in his office.\n\nIn April 1969, Ed disappeared from Springfield after having a traffic accident while intoxicated. That accident put the other driver, the pregnant Maggie Wexler, into a coma and she eventually miscarried her child. While he was away, Ed started working at Hastings Electrical Supply (as the company's doctor) in nearby Clayton, and got involved with the company's secretary, Janet Mason."
