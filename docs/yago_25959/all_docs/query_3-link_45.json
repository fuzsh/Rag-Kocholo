        "text": "June is Pride Month, the time when across the U.S and the world there are celebrations and commemorations to recognize all who identify as LGBTQ and their allies.\n\nDaytime soap operas have had a rocky road when it comes to the representation of same-sex couples. The soaps have been at one time leaders in portraying key social issues of our time, as well as treading lightly on other subjects, as to its concerns to ‘turn-off’ its core audiences.\n\nWhen you look back at the groundbreaking first same-sex weddings, and the first gay kiss, the soaps have come far in some ways in their representations of gay characters, but there is always work to be done to serve and to shed light on the under-represented.\n\nAs we reflect back to the then and the now, which LGBTQ soap supercouple remains your favorite and had made a lasting impact? Let’s take a look at four duos who captivated many viewers.\n\nNuke – Luke Snyder and Noah Mayer – As the World Turns\n\nVan Hansis (Luke) and Jake Silbermann (Noah) were a key part of the evolution of, and representation of LGBTQ character on the soaps. ‘Nuke’, as they were known as, became the first gay male soap couple to share an on-screen kiss back in 2007. ATWT also became known as the first soap to depict a fully realized romantic male couple as an integral part of the show. There was plenty of backlash along the way for the long-awaited kiss to happen, but when it did, the show moved forward to tell their love story.\n\nOtalia – Olivia Spencer and Natalia Rivera Aitoro – Guiding Light\n\nWhen Crystal Chappell (Olivia) and Jessica Leccia (Natalia) began to play the love story of Otalia, they had to show their affection by a kiss on the head, or holding hands. It took quite some time for GL to move forward to have two women, two moms, no less, share a lip lock. The complicated love story featured Natalia being conflicted to face her true romantic feelings for Olivia, because of her value system and religions upbringing, and that made this all the more riveting and frustrating at the same time. In the end, the rabid fan base for this duo was so great that Chappell wound up creating her own series, Venice, to honor and serve them, remaining one of the LGBTQ communities greatest allies.\n\nKish – Kyle Lewis and Oliver Fish – One Life to Live\n\nIn 2009, One Life to Live’s Kyle Lewis (Brett Claywell) was an out lab tech in Llanview, who back in college had a relationship with Officer Oliver Fish (Scott Evans). It imploded when Oliver denied he was gay. For years, Oliver remained in the closet, before finally coming out to himself and Kyle.\n\nKish had been a big success with the media and One Life’s gay audience. LGBTQ-advocacy groups honored the couple and the story. However, Kish was cut short when the network felt that the data showed that the storyline was not resonating with the show’s core audience.\n\nWilSon – Will Horton and Sonny Kiriakis – Days of our Lives\n\nDays of our Lives delivered daytime’s first-ever gay male wedding in 2014, between Will (then played by Guy Wilson) and Sonny (then played by Freddie Smith).\n\nIn an interview with EW, Days of our Lives executive producer, Ken Corday shared on the union, “Will and Sonny have been together for a while and it was the natural progression of their love story. We didn’t feel like there was anything we could or couldn’t do, we treated them like any other couple on the canvas and continued to grow their romance as such.”\n\nIn addition, the coming out story of Will Horton was critically praised and noteworthy for the performances of Chandler Massey, who won three Daytime Emmys for his work in the Outstanding Younger Actor category 2012, 2013 and 2014. Freddie Smith also won in the same category in 2015. Will has been played over the years by Chandler Massey and Guy Wilson, while Sonny has been portrayed by Freddie Smith and Zach Tinker.\n\nThere have been several other key LGBTQ couples throughout the course of daytime history including All My Children’s Bianca (Eden Riegel) and Reese (Tamara Braun). These two characters were involved in the first same-sex lesbian wedding on daytime. Problem was … Reese kissed Zach (Thorsten Kaye) before the wedding, making this infuriating for viewers at home.\n\n</iframOther notable LGBTQ couples have included: All My Children’s\n\nBianca and Maggie to The Young and the Restless Teriah played by Camryn Grimes and Cait Fairbanks, to The Bold and the Beautiful’s Maya and Rick, to General Hospital’s Brad and Lucas and more.\n\nOther notable LGBTQ couples through the years have included: Bianca and Maggie on All My Children, Mariah and Tessa of The Young and the Restless played bv Camryn Grimes and Cait Fairbanks, Maya and Rick on The Bold and the Beautiful, Lucas and Brad on General Hospital and others.\n\nWhich couple do you think has had the most lasting impact on the history of LGBTQ representation on daytime soap operas? Share your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nKelly Ripa is now officially a Disney Legend! The morning talk show host and former All My Children star (ex-Hayley Vaughan Santos) received the honor over the weekend at the D23 event in Anaheim, California, and the home of Disneyland.\n\nThe ‘legend’ honors goes to those individuals who have significantly influenced the Walt Disney Company. Ripa received the recognition for her work in television over her three-decade career, beginning with All My Children, followed by close to a quarter-century of hosting Live! You can catch the ceremonies as they begin to stream on Monday, August 12th on DisneyPlus.\n\nRyan Seacrest presented Ripa with the honors, marking a reunion of the two who co-hosted Live! together for six seasons, before Seacrest made the decision to move back to the West Coast full-time (the talk show is shot in New York City).

Not only my career, but my entire immediate family.”\n\n“I met my smokin’ hot husband (Mark Consuelos) on the set of All My Children 30 years ago, and from there we made our own three children (Lola, Michael and Joaquin) right backstage in the Disney Labs.” In jest, Kelly added, “HR has asked me to remind everyone of their strict, no hidden Mickey policy.

Thank you so very much, so honored.”\n\nTaking to Ripa’s Instagram post on the event were Mark Consuelos, himself, who said, “The woman, the myth, the Disney Legend!!!

Comment below.\n\nThe soap opera world has been in mourning over the weekend, with the news of the death of Esta TerBlanche, who played Gillian Andrassy Lavery on ABC’s All My Children from 1997-2001.\n\nEsta’s leading man during her run in Pine Valley was Cameron Mathison (ex-Ryan Lavery, AMC now, Drew Quartermaine, GH). The love story of Ryan and Gillian was complex. He believed that Gillian was a wealthy princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and the two were eventually married. Later, Gillian was killed when TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to Michael Fairman TV on Sunday, Mathison expressed, “Esta was somebody very, very close to my heart. We both came to New York around the same time and basically started and learned acting together. Ryan and Gillian are such a beautiful sweet couple … and hold a very, very special place in my heart.”\n\nSpeaking on TerBlanche’s love of animals and reconnecting with her in 2023, Cameron recounted, “Esta was literally one of the sweetest kindest people I’ve eve met. When she heard that my dog (Red) was sick and paralyzed last year, she volunteered to take him for a few days to try to care for him to give me a break. We hadn’t really been in touch for a long time so it came out of nowhere and after spending time with her, he learned how to walk again. 🙏”\n\nIn closing Mathison shared, “She was just a beautiful soul and had a healing spirit.” TerBlanche died unexpectedly on Thursday. The cause of death has not yet been determined.\n\nCameron also took to his Instagram Story on Sunday, sharing some images of himself and Esta with one said from All My Children, which read,”RIP my sweet princess.”\n\nWhen All My Children came to its conclusion in 2011, Ryan was reunited with Gillian one more time when he received a ‘heavenly’ visit from his princess. Now with TerBlanche’s death, it makes the scenes all the more poignant.
