Although she’s been extremely busy onscreen taking care of some of Springfield’s most troubled people, actress Jessica Leccia (Natalia Rivera Aitoro) still had time to slip away this month and get married. The thirty-two year old actress married Brian Malloy on May the 3rd at the Gran Melia Resort in Puerto Rico. Attending what must have been a beautiful ceremony were fellow actors Ricky Paull Goldin, Caitlin Van Zandt, Murray Bartlett and Beth Ehlers among others.

Leccia joined the cast of Guding Light as Natalia Rivera, devout single mother and the lost love of Gus Aitoro’s life, in April of 2007. Previous to this, the charming actress played Mary Magdalene on Rescue Me before making appearances on As the World Turns and Love Monkey.
