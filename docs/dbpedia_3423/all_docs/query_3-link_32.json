A glowing tribute was also read to the gathering by former work colleague Garry O’Brien, while Yeomanstown Stud owner Gay O’Callaghan stated: “Every great empire is built on a solid foundation and Dan has been the keystone in the Castlehyde Stud foundation for over 30 years”\n\nMeanwhile, John Magnier of Coolmore, praised Dan’s skills as a horseman and hailed him as one for the fi nest industry workers to have ever crossed his path. “I think everyone is aware of Dan’s excellence as a horseman so I’d just like to add that he is one of the soundest and thoroughly good people I’ve been lucky enough to meet,” he said.

Among the many confrontations of the war was the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Often known as Custer's Last Stand it was probably the most storied victory of the Native Americans over the US Army. Our own Little Big Bear also in fl icted some heavy defeats on his rivals, most notably when landing the season’s fi rst Group 1 for juveniles by a margin of 7 lengths. This earned him a Timeform rating of 126p which is virtually unheard of for that point in the season. Ultimately named European Champion Two-Year-Old he had speed, power and precocity in abundance.
