        "text": "is na worth, that sayis all peple far fra the sonne ar barbour and miserable.\" So declared John Bellenden's translation of Hector Boece's Scottorum historiae in 1531, both works being of the greatest intellectual significance for sixteenth-century Scotland. \"Na region in the warld\" proved to be so blasted \"be distance fra the Sonne\" that it could not sustain its inhabitants in health, culture and virtue. Despite Scotland's adverse northern location, the realm was a civilized country, and the Historia undertook to show that it had been so for a truly immense stretch of time. 1 The work proved an immediate success. Even though it presented moral exemplars that might appear to sanction baronial revolution, James V sponsored the Bellenden translation, which eventually appeared in print under royal authority. By any standard a major cultural event for the realm, the Historia served throughout the century as a touchstone for virtually every Scottish intellectual, irrespective of politics or religion-appealing no less to monarchists than to monarchomachs, to Calvinists like George Buchanan and David Hume of Godscroft as well as to Catholics like David Chambers of Ormond. The late 1520s and early 1530s had been a moment of exceptional self-confidence and creativity in Scotland, and one which Boece articulated with\n\nThis paper examines an often overlooked piece of textual history: the English print translations of a fourteenth-century Scottish baronial letter known as the Declaration of Arbroath. While not widely known among scholars of the Middle Ages in general, this document has long attracted the attention of historians of the Scottish Wars of Independence, and become an object of near reverence for modern Scottish nationalists and American Scotophiles. Utilizing recent work on the Declaration itself along with the translation theories of Laurence Venuti and others, I argue that English print translations of the Declaration—beginning in 1689 and continuing up to the most recent versions—have dramatically recast it, transforming it from a letter expressing baronial privilege within an esoteric and localized political situation to a universal, populist “declaration of independence.” The result has been the creation of a current popular mythology concerning the document that sees medieval Scots, through the lens of the Declaration, as proto-democrats engaged in a struggle not for privileged baronial libertas but for populist freedom. As I shall show, this transformation has its roots in the process of translation itself, in the inevitable alterations that occur when a medieval Latin manuscript becomes a modern English printed text. The history of the Declaration and its later translations offers an example of the ways in which translation contributes to the transformation of medieval texts into the sources of current—and strongly nationalist—fantasies about the middle ages. Examining this history allows us to see how linguistic and material translation bring about cultural or historical translatio and serve as a crucial though not always fully credited mechanism for reshaping historical events and texts from medieval Europe into artefacts suited for modern (mis)appropriation."
