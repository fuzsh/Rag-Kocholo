        "text": "Heraldry flourished on medieval battlefields for military reasons. However, scholars recognize that its largest social expansion in Western Europe occurred during the seventeenth century, which was a time when coats of arms were essentially obsolete in warfare. 1 This essay will tackle the apparent paradox of heraldry's non-military expansion by discussing the social and symbolic reasons that led people to create and assume arms for themselves and their families in modern France (c.1500–1789), and how this process is reflected in shields. It identifies the commoners who adopted arms, and the messages the bearings were designed to carry. The answers to these questions lie not only in armorial records, but also in situ: the widespread use of heraldry in public and private spaces, in urban and rural landscapes, in profane or sacred contexts, still brings us valuable information towards understanding the visual role and language of heraldry. The choice of valorizing — often canting — charges by the bearer of the name reflects a claim for a specific social status. However, a close study of symbolic allusions ranging from professional and dynastic to religious or even apotropaic, suggests a far more subtle combination of meanings, in close interaction with social, cultural, political, and vernacular context. Being an Armiger in Modern France: Law and Practice In modern France (c.1500 –1789), the vast majority of coats of arms were self-assumed, which implies that they were composed within the family circle. Royal heraldic concessions and augmentations were but few, and never seem to exceed one per cent of the total number of coats of arms in use within the realm. 2 In 1620, André Favyn, the author of a treatise called Le théâtre d'honneur et de chevalerie, wrote: 'today even the lowest merchants and craftsmen wish to counterfeit the nobleman by assuming arms'. 3 Although stating that coats of arms are solely for noble use is false and reflects a reactionary trend quite commonly expressed among the nobility at that time, Favyn is not the only heraldic theoretician of his time to deplore the fact that the use of coats of arms had become widespread among commoners. Favyn's opinion reflects an ideological trend shared by many other modern authors of heraldic treatises who considered that the use of coats of arms should be restricted to nobles only, because they were the ones who invented heraldry to magnify their exploits, virtues, and lineage. 4 This claim, nevertheless, cannot be supported by any legal statement: since the Middle Ages, heraldry had been used in France by nobles and commoners alike. 5 However, pressure concerning heraldic matters exerted on the king by the nobility since the beginning of the sixteenth century led François I to issue an edict in 1535 prohibiting the use of insignia such as helmets, crests, and crowns by commoners. 6 This legislation was reiterated over the course of the century, thus demonstrating its ineffectiveness. During the États généraux of 1614, the nobility firmly denounced two widespread heraldic abuses: some commoners were using homonymy to usurp coats of arms belonging to noble families, while others were displaying insignia restricted to the nobility. 7 Such grievances led Louis XIII to create, in January 1615, the office of Juge général d' armes de France, with more extensive judicial rights than former"
