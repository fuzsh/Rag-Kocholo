        "text": "A taxonomic review of the centipede genus Scolopendra Linnaeus, 1758 (Scolopendromorpha, Scolopendridae) in mainland Southeast Asia, with description of a new species from Laos\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSiriwut, Warut; Edgecombe, Gregory D.; Sutcharit, Chirasak; Tongkerd, Piyoros; Panha, Somsak\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract The centipede genus Scolopendra in mainland Southeast Asia is reviewed taxonomically based on morphological characters, informed by a molecular phylogenetic analysis using sequences from three mitochondrial and nuclear genes (COI, 16S rRNA and 28S rRNA). Eight nominal species of Scolopendra, namely Scolopendra morsitans Linnaeus, 1758, Scolopendra subspinipes Leach, 1816, Scolopendra dehaani Brandt, 1840, Scolopendra multidens Newport, 1844, Scolopendra calcarata Porat, 1876, Scolopendra japonica Koch, 1878, Scolopendra pinguis Pocock, 1891, and Scolopendra dawydoffi KronmÃ¼ller, 2012, are redescribed together with some revision of type materials. Geographical variation in each species has been compiled with reference to samples that span their distribution ranges in Southeast Asia and some parts of neighbouring areas such as East Asia, the Indian Ocean, and Africa. Comparative study of traditional taxonomic characters from external morphology provides further information to distinguish some closely related species. Scolopendra cataracta Siriwut, Edgecombe & Panha, sp. n., is described from the southern part of Laos, with additional records in Thailand and Vietnam. The phylogenetic framework for Southeast Asian Scolopendra recognizes Scolopendra calcarata + Scolopendra pinguis, Scolopendra morsitans, and a Scolopendra subspinipes group that unites the other six species as the main clades. Within the Scolopendra subspinipes group, two monophyletic groups can be distinguished by having either slender or short, thick ultimate leg prefemora and different numbers of apical spines on the coxopleuron. Scolopendra arborea Lewis, 1982, is placed in subjective synonymy with Scolopendra dehaani. A survey of external morphology of the genital segments confirms its potential for improving species identification in Scolopendra. Some observations on biology and behaviour are recorded based on field surveys in this area.

The highly variable species is the most common of the genus in Europe, occurring from Portugal in the west to Iran in the east. The northernmost occurrences are in Hungary and Romania, where it abides in small isolated fringe populations. We report the rediscovery of an isolated Austrian population of Scolopendra cingulata with the first explicit specimen records for more than 80 years and provide insights into the evolutionary history of the northernmost populations utilizing fragments of two mitochondrial genes, COI and 16S, comprising 1,155 base pairs. We test the previously proposed hypothesis of a speciation by distance scenario, which argued for a simple range expansion of the species from the southeast, via Romania, Hungary and finally to Austria, based on a comprehensive taxon sampling from seven countries, including the first European mainland samples. We argue that more complex patterns must have shaped the current distribution of S. cingulata and that the Austrian population should be viewed as an important biogeographical relict in a possible microrefugium. The unique haplotype of the Austrian population could constitute an important part of the species genetic diversity and we hope that this discovery will initiate protective measures not only for S. cingulata, but also for its habitat, since microrefugia are likely to host further rare thermophilous species. Furthermore, we take advantage of the unprecedented sampling to provide the first basic insights into the suitability of the COI fragment as a species identifying barcode within the centipede genus Scolopendra.

In this study, we derived a novel lactoferricin B like peptide (LBLP) from the whole bodies of adult centipedes, S. s. mutilans, and investigated the antifungal effect of LBLP. LBLP exerted an antifungal and fungicidal activity without hemolysis. To investigate the antifungal mechanism of LBLP, a membrane study with propidium iodide was first conducted against Candida albicans. The result showed that LBLP caused fungal membrane permeabilization. The assays of the three dimensional flow cytometric contour plot and membrane potential further showed cell shrinkage and membrane depolarization by the membrane damage. Finally, we confirmed the membrane-active mechanism of LBLP by synthesizing model membranes, calcein and FITC-dextran loaded large unilamellar vesicles. These results showed that the antifungal effect of LBLP on membrane was due to the formation of pores with radii between 0.74nm and 1.4nm. In conclusion, this study suggests that LBLP exerts a potent antifungal activity by pore formation in the membrane, eventually leading to fungal cell death.

But little attention was focused on them and only few centipede toxins were demonstrated with activity on ion channels. Therefore, more deep works are needed to understand the diversity of centipede venom. In the present study, we use peptidomics combined with cDNA library to uncover the diversity of centipede Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans L. Koch. 192 peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS and 79 precursors were deduced by cDNA library. Surprisingly, the signal peptides of centipede toxins were more complicated than any other animal toxins and even exhibited large differences in homologues. Meanwhile, a large number of variants generated by alternative cleavage sites were detected by mass spectra. Odd number of cystein (3, 5, 7) found in the mature peptides were seldom seen in peptide toxins. In additional, two novel cysteine frameworks (C-C-C-CCC, C-C-C-C-CC-CC) were identified from 16 different cysteine frameworks from centipede peptides. Only 29 precursors have clear targets, while others may provide a potential diversity function for centipede. These findings highlight the extensive diversity of centipede toxins and provide powerful tools to understand the capture and defense weapon of centipede. Peptide toxins from venomous animal have attracted increasing attentions due to their extraordinary chemical and pharmacological diversity. Centipedes are one of the most used Chinese traditional medicines, but little was known about the active components. The venom of Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans L. Koch is first deeply analyzed in this work and most of peptides were never discovered before. Interestingly, the number and arrangement of cysteine showed a larger different to known peptide toxins such spider or scorpion toxins. Moreover, only 29 peptides from this centipede venom were identified with known function. It suggested that our work not only important to\n\nResurrection of Scolopendra longipes Wood and Scolopendra cubensis Saussure from synonymy with Scolopendra alternans Leach (Chilopoda, Scolopendromorpha, Scolopendridae): an enigmatic species-group needing phylogeographic analysis, with an overview on the origin and distribution of centipedes in the Caribbean region.\n\nPubMed\n\nMercurio, Randy J\n\n2016-05-12\n\nResurrection of Scolopendra longipes Wood, 1862, and Scolopendra cubensis Saussure, 1860, from junior synonymy with Scolopendra alternans Leach, 1815, is proposed. A neotype specimen of Scolopendra longipes is designated. Scolopendra longipes has a restricted range from the Dry Tortugas up through the Florida Keys of Monroe County into the mainland Florida counties of Collier and Dade southeast to the Bahamas, while Scolopendra cubensis is endemic to Cuba. Characters distinguishing S. longipes, and S. cubensis from S. alternans are illustrated and compared using digital photography, micrography and morphometric data. It is suggested that what has been considered Scolopendra alternans from southern Florida through the Caribbean and into northern South America is probably an evolving species-group that has undergone major diversification sometime during the Paleocene and early Eocene ~65.5-50 million years ago (Ma), mainly due to geographic isolation caused by a combination of plate tectonics and 100,000 year cycles of glaciation/deglaciation.\n\nA Novel Factor Xa-Inhibiting Peptide from Centipedes Venom.\n\nPubMed\n\nKong, Yi; Shao, Yu; Chen, Hao; Ming, Xin; Wang, Jin-Bin; Li, Zhi-Yu; Wei, Ji-Fu\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCentipedes have been used as traditional medicine for thousands of years in China. Centipede venoms consist of many biochemical peptides and proteins. Factor Xa (FXa) is a serine endopeptidase that plays the key role in blood coagulation, and has been used as a new target for anti-thrombotic drug development. A novel FXa inhibitor, a natural peptide with the sequence of Thr-Asn-Gly-Tyr-Thr (TNGYT), was isolated from the venom of Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans using a combination of size-exclusion and reverse-phase chromatography. The molecular weight of the TNGYT peptide was 554.3Â Da measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence of TNGYT was determined by Edman degradation. TNGYT inhibited the activity of FXa in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of 41.14Â mg/ml. It prolonged the partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time in both in vitro and ex vivo assays. It also significantly prolonged whole blood clotting time and bleeding time in mice. This is the first report that an FXa inhibiting peptide was isolated from centipedes venom.\n\nIn situ chitin isolation from body parts of a centipede and lysozyme adsorption studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nBulut, Esra; Sargin, Idris; Arslan, Ozlem; Odabasi, Mehmet; Akyuz, Bahar; Kaya, Murat\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIsolation of structurally intact chitin samples for biotechnological applications has gained much recent attention. So far, three-dimensional chitin isolates have been obtained from only diplopods and sponges. In this study, three-dimensional chitin isolates were obtained from the body parts of centipede Scolopendra sp. (antennae, head, forcipule, collum, trunk, trunk legs and last pair of legs) without leading to structural failure. FT-IR spectra of chitin isolates confirmed that chitin samples are in Î± allomorph. TGA, XRD and SEM analyses and lysozyme adsorption studies revealed that each chitin isolate had different thermal stability, crystallinity and surface characteristics. Among the chitin isolates, Cu(II)-immobilized forcipule chitin showed the highest affinity for lysozyme (54.1mg/g), whereas chitin from last pair of legs exhibited the lowest affinity (3.7mg/g). This study demonstrated that structurally intact chitin isolates can be obtained from the body parts of centipede Scolopendra sp. (antennae, head, forcipule, collum, trunk, trunk legs and last pair of legs) by using a simple chemical procedure. Also, it gives a biotechnological perspective to the organisms in the group of Chilipoda. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The amino acids in the pharmacopuncture extracted from S. subspinipes mutilans by using derivatization methods were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) over a 12 month period to confirm its stability. Amino acids of pharmacopuncture extracted from S. subspinipes mutilans were derived by using O-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) & 9-fluorenyl methoxy carbonyl chloride (FMOC) reagent and were analyzed using HPLC. The amino acids were detected by using a diode array detector (DAD) and a fluorescence detector (FLD) to compare a mixed amino acid standard (STD) to the pharmacopuncture from centipedes. The stability tests on the pharmacopuncture from centipedes were done using HPLC for three conditions: a room temperature test chamber, an acceleration test chamber, and a cold test chamber. The pharmacopuncture from centipedes was prepared by using the method of the Korean Pharmacopuncture Institute (KPI) and through quantitative analyses was shown to contain 9 amino acids of the 16 amino acids in the mixed amino acid STD.

Geometric morphometric description of shape variation in the cephalic plate, forcipular coxosternite, and tergite of the ultimate leg-bearing segment provides additional criteria for distinguishing species. Colouration patterns in some Scolopendra species show a high degree of fit to phylogenetic trees at the population level. The most densely sampled species, Scolopendra dehaani Brandt, 1840, has three subclades with allopatric distributions in mainland SE Asia. The molecular phylogeny of S. pinguis Pocock, 1891, indicated ontogenetic colour variation among its populations.

Species delimitation in these taxonomically challenging animals is facilitated by an integrative approach that draws on both morphology and molecular phylogeny.

The scolopendrasin VII-induced chemotactic migration of macrophages is inhibited by the formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) antagonist cyclosporine H. We also found that scolopendrasin VII stimulate the chemotactic migration of FPR1-transfected RBL-2H3 cells, but not that of vector-transfected cells; moreover, scolopendrasin VII directly binds to FPR1. Our findings therefore suggest that the antimicrobial peptide scolopendrasin VII, derived from Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans, stimulates macrophages, resulting in chemotactic migration via FPR1 signaling, and the peptide can be useful in the study of FPR1-related biological responses.

In this study, a novel antimicrobial peptide, lacrain, was isolated from the body extract of the Brazilian Chilopoda Scolopendra viridicornis. The peptide was isolated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Its activity was tested using a liquid growth inhibition assay and the peptide was characterised using mass spectrometry. Lacrain has a sequence composed of eight amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 925.5âDa. A synthetic peptide of the native lacrain had identical characteristics to those of the isolated material, confirming its sequence. The synthetic peptide was active only against Gram-negative bacteria, showing strong bactericidal activity. Moreover, the peptide did not present haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes. Lacrain represents a novel molecule with powerful antibacterial activity that could be used as a new template for the development of drugs against clinically resistant bacterial strains.

In L. forficatus, the autophagy occurred only in the cytoplasm of the digestive cells as a sporadic process, while in S. cingulata, it occurred intensively in the digestive, secretory and regenerative cells of the midgut epithelium. In both of the species that were analyzed, this process proceeded in a continuous manner and did not depend on the day/night cycle. Ultrastructural analysis showed that the autophagosomes and autolysosomes were located mainly in the apical and perinuclear cytoplasm of the digestive cells in L. forficatus. However, in S. cingulata, the entire cytoplasm was filled with autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Initially the membranes of phagophores surround organelles during autophagosome formation. Autolysosomes result from the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Residual bodies which are the last stage of autophagy were released into the midgut lumen due to necrosis. Autophagy in the midgut epithelia that were analyzed was confirmed using acid phosphatase and mono-dansyl-cadaverine stainings. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In vtiro phytochemical, antioxidant and blocking of proteolysis were carried out by using standard spectrophotometric methods. In vivo anti-venom activity of methanol extracts was determined using Wistar albino rats after fixing lethal and effective doses. The electrolytes, lipid, liver, kidney, hematological parameters were analyzed and histopathology of skin and liver were also examined. Anti-skin cancer by MTT method and HPLC analysis were also carried out. The CAIPN extract showed higher total phenolics (150.65âÂ±â0.08âmg GAE/g extract) and flavonoids (158.97âÂ±â0.93âmg RE/g extract) content. Further, the same extract revealed the higher molybdenum reducing, inhibition of lipid peroxidation (80.08âÂ±â0.22%), DPPH radical scavenging (3.05âÎ¼g/mL), and blocking of proteolysis activities (96.45âÂ±â0.04%). The parameters like hypersensitivity, electrolytes, lipids, blood components, liver and kidney marker of the CAIPN methanol extract (200âmg/kg) treated envenomated rats was remarkable and same as in the normal animals. Such status was also achieved by RBAI and SPN at 600âmg/kg. The histopathological scoring of skin and liver confirmed the venom neutralizing activity of CAIPN. Also, the CAIPN methanol extract was notable in anti-skin cancer activity (208âÎ¼g/mL). The presence of the ferulic acid (04âÂ±â0.09âÎ¼g/mg) and quercetin (35.30âÂ±â0.30âÎ¼g/mg) like compounds was confirmed by HPLC analysis. Hence, the present investigation results conclude that the CAIPN was significant in their action and this polyherbal formulation could be considered as a new source for the pharmaceutical industries to develop a new effective, ecofriendly anti-venom drug.

One sequence of Scolopendra cingulata Latreille, 1829 and one of Theatops erythrocephalus Koch, 1847 were utilized as outgroups. Instead of the expected three species (Cryptops parisi Brolemann, 1920; Cryptops anomalans Newport, 1844; Cryptops hortensis (Donovan, 1810)), analyzed samples included eight to ten species. Of the eight clearly distinguishable morphospecies of Cryptops, five (Cryptops parisi; Cryptops croaticus Verhoeff, 1931; Cryptops anomalans; Cryptops umbricus Verhoeff, 1931; Cryptops hortensis) could be tentatively determined to species level, while a further three remain undetermined (one each from Germany, Austria and Croatia, and Slovenia). Cryptops croaticus is recorded for the first time from Austria. A single specimen (previously suspected as being Cryptops anomalans), was redetermined as Cryptops umbricus Verhoeff, 1931, a first record for Germany. All analyzed Cryptops species are monophyletic and show large genetic distances from one another (p-distances of 13.7â22.2%). Clear barcoding gaps are present in lineages represented by >10 specimens, highlighting the usefulness of the barcoding method for evaluating species diversity in centipedes. German specimens formally assigned to Cryptops parisi are divided into three clades differing by 8.4â11.3% from one another; their intra-lineage genetic distance is much lower at 0â1.1%. The three clades are geographically separate, indicating that they might represent distinct species. Aside from Cryptops parisi, intraspecific distances of Cryptops spp. in Central Europe are low (<3.3%).

M.; Mallick, K.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nWe consider the quantum centipede made of N fermionic quantum walkers on the one-dimensional lattice interacting by means of the simplest of all hard-bound constraints: the distance between two consecutive fermions is either one or two lattice spacings. This composite quantum walker spreads ballistically, just as the simple quantum walk. However, because of the interactions between the internal degrees of freedom, the distribution of its center-of-mass velocity displays numerous ballistic fronts in the long-time limit, corresponding to singularities in the empirical velocity distribution. The spectrum of the centipede and the corresponding group velocities are analyzed by direct means for the first few values of N. Some analytical results are obtained for arbitrary N by exploiting an exact mapping of the problem onto a free-fermion system. We thus derive the maximal velocity describing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the centipede wavefunction, including its non-trivial value in the large-N limit.\n\nThe Classroom Animal: Centipedes and Millipedes.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKramer, David C.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nCompares and contrasts the habitats, behaviors, feeding habits, and physical characteristics of centipedes and millipedes.

The distance between two consecutive legs is either one or two lattice spacings, and a global constraint is imposed: the maximal distance between the first and last leg is Nââ+ââ1. This is the strongest global constraint compatible with walking. For an initial value of the wave function corresponding to a localized configuration at the origin, the probability law of the first leg of the centipede can be expressed in closed form in terms of Bessel functions. The dispersion relation and the group velocities are worked out exactly. Their maximal group velocity goes to zero when N goes to infinity, which is in contrast with the behaviour of group velocities of quantum centipedes without global constraint, which were recently shown by Krapivsky, Luck and Mallick to give rise to ballistic spreading of extremal wave-front at non-zero velocity in the large-N limit. The corresponding Hamiltonians are implemented numerically, based on a block structure of the space of configurations corresponding to compositions of the integer N. The growth of the maximal group velocity when the strong constraint is gradually relaxed is explored, and observed to be linear in the density of gaps allowed in the configurations. Heuristic arguments are presented to infer that the large-N limit of the globally constrained model can yield finite group velocities provided the allowed number of gaps is a finite fraction of N.\n\nA synopsis of centipedes in Brazilian caves: hidden species diversity that needs conservation (Myriapoda, Chilopoda)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChagas-Jr, Amazonas; Bichuette, Maria Elina\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAbstract This study revises centipede fauna found in Brazilian caves, focusing on troglomorphic taxa and emphasizing conservation status. We present 563 centipede specimens from 274 caves across eleven Brazilian states. Of these, 22 records were derived from existing literature and 252 are newly collected. Specimens represent four orders, ten families, 18 genera, and 47 morphospecies. Together, the cave records represent 21 % of Brazilâs centipede fauna. Scolopendromorpha was the most representative order (41 %), followed by Geophilomorpha (26 %), Scutigeromorpha (23 %), and Lithobiomorpha (10 %). Six species were found only in caves, with four considered troglobitic. The distribution of Cryptops iporangensis, the first Brazilian troglobitic centipede species to be discovered, was expanded to other three caves. Cryptops spelaeoraptor and Cryptops iporangensis are two troglobitic species considered Vulnerable and Endangered, respectively, according to the IUCN Red List. Main threats to Brazilian caves are mining, hydroelectric projects, water pollution, and unregulated tourism.

The lowest concentrations found to cause anaesthesia are given in per cent by volume as follows: propylene, for centipede, 30; katydid, 75; rose chafer, 60. Carbon monoxide, for centipede, 81.5; katydid, 89, rose chafer, 85. Butylene, for centipede, 5; katydid, 10; rose chafer, 40. Ethylene or acetylene, for centipede, katydid, and rose chafer, 100. Carbon dioxide, for rose chafer, 30. Ethylene was the most effective plant anaesthetic, 0.0005 per cent stopping growth movementsmoreÂ Â» of tomato and sunflower plants as shown by motion pictures; 0.001 per cent stopped elongation of sweet pea seedlings, while 0.00001 per cent retarded elongation nearly 50 per cent. The degree of retardation in growth from ethylene gas varied with the concentration and the plant species. Acetylene and propylene were about equally effective as plant anaesthetics. Both were approximately 10 times as effective as carbon monoxide. Mimosa pudica lost its capacity to respond to external stimuli while being exposed to 0.25 per cent of carbon monoxide, but became normal again upon being removed from the gas. 3 references, 4 tables.Â«Â less\n\nCase of Levodopa Toxicity from Ingestion of Mucuna gigantea\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Brian B; McMurtray, Aaron M; Nakamoto, Beau K\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHawaiâi is home to 1000 native species of flowering plants. Mucuna gigantea is one such Hawaiian species which has been studied as affordable sustenance and as a cover crop in developing countries. Mucuna gigantea and other Mucuna species (spp.) in general, are known to contain natural levodopa and its utility in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease has also been evaluated. Levodopa is converted in the periphery into dopamine which can then act on dopamine receptors to cause nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, and hypotension. We describe a case in which a patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after legume ingestion. The bean was ultimately identified as Mucuna gigantea and the patient was diagnosed with levodopa-induced gastrointestinal toxicity from consumption of the legume. A literature review was conducted using the database search engines, Biological Abstracts and PubMed, with a broad combination of keywords of which include âmucuna, âgigantean,â âlevodopa,â âl-dopa,â âtoxicity,â and the association between Mucuna gigantea ingestion and levodopa toxicity is discussed. These findings expand the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting in the correct clinical context.

Sixty patients envenomated by centipedes were randomized into three groups and were treated with ice packs, hot water immersion, or analgesia injection. The visual analog score (VAS) for pain was measured before the treatment and 15 min afterward. Demographic data and data on local and systemic effects after centipede bites were collected. The VAS scores and the pain decrease (DeltaVAS) were compared between the three groups. All patients suffered from pain at the affected sites; other local effects included redness (n = 49, 81.7%), swelling (n = 32, 53.3%), heat (n = 14, 23.3%), itchiness (n = 5, 8.3), and bullae formation (n = 3, 5.0%). Rare systemic effects were reported. All three groups had similar VAS scores before and after treatment. They also had similar effectiveness in reducing pain caused by centipedes bites (DeltaVAS = 2.55 +/- 1.88, 2.33 +/- 1.78, and 1.55 +/- 1.68, with ice packs, analgesia, and hot water immersion, respectively, p = 0.165). Ice packs, hot water immersion, and analgesics all improved the pain from centipede envenomation. Ice pack treatment is a safe, inexpensive, and non-invasive method for pre-hospital management in patients with centipede envenomation.\n\nEstablishment of the woody grass Arundinaria gigantea for riparian restoration\n\nTreesearch\n\nAdam J.

This study therefore aims at investigating the antimicrobial properties of ethanol leaf and stem bark extracts of P. macrocarpa and C. gigantea using the agar diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques and also determining the anti-inflammatory properties of the extracts of these plants in carrageenan-induced foot edema in seven-day old chicks. The minimum inhibitory concentration of both ethanol leaf and bark extracts of P. macrocarpa against the test organisms was from 0.125 to 2.55âmg/mL and that of C. gigantea extracts was 0.125 to 2.75âmg/mL. Extracts with concentration of 50âmg/mL were most active against the test organisms according to the agar diffusion method. All the extracts of P. macrocarpa and C. gigantea at 30, 100, and 300âmg/kg body weight except ethanol leaf extract of C. gigantea exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects (P â¤ 0.001).

Segment numbers in geophilomorphs are higher than in any other centipedes, ranging from 27 to 191. They may be constant within a species, presenting in extreme form the \"counting\" problem in development, or they may vary--a situation that provides us with the opportunity to study naturally occurring variation in segment numbers. All their segments are generated during embryogenesis, a situation unlike that in the more basal centipede orders, which generate only a fraction of their 15 trunk segments in the embryo and develop the rest postembryonically. Here we provide a foundation for further developmental studies of the Geophilomorpha, building on the one study that has been conducted to date, on the coastal species Strigamia maritima. Development begins with the migration of nuclei to the surface of the egg, which then condense to form an embryonic rudiment of more than 20,000 cells, covering an entire hemisphere. During early development, the embryo can be divided into two distinct areas: a large terminal disc of apparently undifferentiated tissue and the germ-band, which has a clear anteroposterior axis and differentiated segments. The germ-band forms from the anterior of the terminal disc and extends anteriorly as the disc contracts. New segments are formed at the posterior margin of the germ-band. Once the process of segmentation ends, the germ-band folds and sinks into the yolk. We note that the classic description of centipede development, by Heymons more than a century ago, contains a fundamental error in the identification of the axes and hence in the interpretation of early segmentation.\n\nErgot Alkaloid Biosynthesis in the Maize (Zea mays) Ergot Fungus Claviceps gigantea.\n\nPubMed\n\nBragg, Paige E; Maust, Matthew D; Panaccione, Daniel G\n\n2017-12-13\n\nBiosynthesis of the dihydrogenated forms of ergot alkaloids is of interest because many of the ergot alkaloids used as pharmaceuticals may be derived from dihydrolysergic acid (DHLA) or its precursor dihydrolysergol. The maize (Zea mays) ergot pathogen Claviceps gigantea has been reported to produce dihydrolysergol, a hydroxylated derivative of the common ergot alkaloid festuclavine. We hypothesized expression of C. gigantea cloA in a festuclavine-accumulating mutant of the fungus Neosartorya fumigata would yield dihydrolysergol because the P450 monooxygenase CloA from other fungi performs similar oxidation reactions. We engineered such a strain, and high performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated the modified strain produced DHLA, the fully oxidized product of dihydrolysergol. Accumulation of high concentrations of DHLA in field-collected C. gigantea sclerotia and discovery of a mutation in the gene lpsA, downstream from DHLA formation, supported our finding that DHLA rather than dihydrolysergol is the end product of the C. gigantea pathway.\n\nMillipedes and centipedes in German greenhouses (Myriapoda: Diplopoda, Chilopoda)\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract A review is given of all the literature records of millipedes and centipedes that have been found in German greenhouses together with additional records for 29 such sites. Species lists are given for 46 greenhouses investigated throughout Germany. Thirty-five diplopod and 18 chilopod species were found to occur in greenhouses, of which 15 (3 Chilopoda, 12 Diplopoda) are restricted to this type of habitat. First records for Germany include Anadenobolus monilicornis (Porat, 1876), Epinannolene cf. trinidadensis Chamberlin, 1918, Epinannolene sp., Mesoiulus gridellii Strasser, 1934, Leptogoniulus sorornus (Butler, 1876), Rhinotus purpureus (Pocock, 1894), Cryptops doriae Pocock, 1891, Lamyctes coeculus (BrÃ¶lemann, 1889) and Tygarrup javanicus (Attems, 1907). The millipedes Oxidus gracilis (C. L. Koch, 1847) and Amphitomeus attemsi (Schubart, 1934) and the centipedes Lithobius forficatus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Cryptops hortensis (Donovan, 1810) are the species most frequently found in greenhouses. PMID:24891823\n\nSocial Value Induction and Cooperation in the Centipede Game\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Centipede game provides a dynamic model of cooperation and competition in repeated dyadic interactions. Two experiments investigated psychological factors driving cooperation in 20 rounds of a Centipede game with significant monetary incentives and anonymous and random re-pairing of players after every round. The main purpose of the research was to determine whether the pattern of strategic choices observed when no specific social value orientation is experimentally inducedâthe standard condition in all previous investigations of behavior in the Centipede and most other experimental gamesâis essentially individualistic, the orthodox game-theoretic assumption being that players are individualistically motivated in the absence of any specific motivational induction. Participants in whom no specific state social value orientation was induced exhibited moderately non-cooperative play that differed significantly from the pattern found when an individualistic orientation was induced. In both experiments, the neutral treatment condition, in which no orientation was induced, elicited competitive behavior resembling behavior in the condition in which a competitive orientation was explicitly induced. Trait social value orientation, measured with a questionnaire, influenced cooperation differently depending on the experimentally induced state social value orientation. Cooperative trait social value orientation was a significant predictor of cooperation and, to a lesser degree, experimentally induced competitive orientation was a significant predictor of non-cooperation. The experimental results imply that the standard assumption of individualistic motivation in experimental games may not be valid, and that the results of such investigations need to take into account the possibility that players are competitively motivated.

Britton and Rose apparently depends on minimum apical temperatures. Diameters, apical spine coverage, and effects of nurse plants on incoming long-wave (infrared (ir)) radiation, all of which affect apical temperatures, were therefore determined for stems of C. gigantea up to 4 m tall at four sites along a north-south transect in Arizona. A simulation model indicated that the increase in diameter accompanying stem growth raised the minimum apical temperature more than 3 C. Thus, plants with the shortest stems would be expected to be the most vulnerable to freezing damage; indeed, freezing damagemoreÂ Â» on stems <0.5 m tall without nurse plants was fairly common at the colder sites. Nurse plants obstructed a greater portion of the sky for C. gigantea at the colder sites; e.g., the effective environmental temperature for ir radiation at such locations was raised more than 10 C for stems under 1 m tall. If the northern limit of C. gigantea reflects wintertime survival of juveniles, nurse plants could extend the range by offering some protection against freezing.Â«Â less\n\nAnalysis of Antibacterial Activity and Bioactive Compounds of the Giant Mushroom, Macrocybe gigantea (Agaricomycetes), from India.\n\nPubMed\n\nGaur, Tanvi; Rao, P B\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe antibacterial activity, phenolic profile, and bioactive compounds of fruiting bodies from 2 strains (MA1 and MA2) of the giant mushroom Macrocybe gigantea were evaluated to access their nutraceutical efficacy. The antibacterial activity was higher in MA2 against all selected pathogenic bacteria. Selected phenolics were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet-visible detection. Gallic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, and rutin contents (micrograms per gram dry weight) were quantified. Quercetin and rutin were absent in both strains of M. gigantea. M. gigantea MA2 showed relatively higher phenolic content (915.8 Î¼g/g dry weight) than M. gigantea MA1 (854.4 Î¼g/g dry weight). Among the phenolics, gallic acid is found in the largest amount; in M. gigantea MA2, it was 847.9 Â± 2.67 Î¼g/g dry weight. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed the presence of bioactive compounds in both strains; most compounds were antibacterial. Thus, the selected strains of M. gigantea can combat oxidative damage and can be used in foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics because of their antioxidant potential.\n\nMicrosatellite markers for Vellozia gigantea (Velloziaceae), a narrowly endemic species to the Brazilian campos rupestres.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartins, Ana Paula V; Proite, Karina; Kalapothakis, Evanguedes; Santos, FabrÃ­cio R; Chaves, Anderson V; Borba, Eduardo L\n\n2012-07-01\n\nMicrosatellite primers were developed for the first time in Velloziaceae, in the endangered species Vellozia gigantea. Using two different protocols, seven primer sets were characterized in three populations of V. gigantea. The primers amplified di- and trinucleotide repeats with six to 12 alleles per locus. These revealed high levels of genetic variation, presenting an average observed heterozygosity of 0.508 in V. gigantea. The seven primers were tested for cross-amplification in three Vellozia species. All primers successfully amplified in V. auriculata. Six primers amplified in V. compacta and three in V. hirsuta. The new marker set described here will be useful for studies of population genetics of V. gigantea. The cross-amplification results indicate the utility of primers for studies in other Vellozia species.\n\nBiomechanical pulping with Phlebiopsis gigantea reduced energy consumption and increased paper strength : [summary\n\nTreesearch\n\nChad J.

However, our understanding of this fascinating area of evolution has been hampered by the narrow taxonomical range studied, with entire groups of venomous animals remaining almost completely unstudied. One such group is centipedes, class Chilopoda, which emerged about 440 Ma and may represent the oldest terrestrial venomous lineage next to scorpions. Here, we provide the first comprehensive insight into the chilopod âvenomeâ and its evolution, which has revealed novel and convergent toxin recruitments as well as entirely new toxin families among both high- and low molecular weight venom components. The ancient evolutionary history of centipedes is also apparent from the differences between the Scolopendromorpha and Scutigeromorpha venoms, which diverged over 430 Ma, and appear to employ substantially different venom strategies. The presence of a wide range of novel proteins and peptides in centipede venoms highlights these animals as a rich source of novel bioactive molecules. Understanding the evolutionary processes behind these ancient venom systems will not only broaden our understanding of which traits make proteins and peptides amenable to neofunctionalization but it may also aid in directing bioprospecting efforts.

Here, with the use of georeferenced centipede data, we explore the importance and contribution of bioclimatic variables and land cover, and predict distribution ranges and potential hotspots in Norway. We used a maximum entropy analysis (Maxent) to model species' distributions, aiming at exploring centres of distribution, latitudinal spans and northern range boundaries of centipedes in Norway. The performance of all Maxent models was better than random with average test area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.893 and True Skill Statistic (TSS) values above 0.593. Our results showed a highly significant latitudinal gradient of increased species richness in southern grid-cells. Mean temperatures of warmest and coldest quarters explained much of the potential distribution of species. Predictive modelling analyses revealed that south-eastern Norway and the Atlantic coast in the west (inclusive of the major fjord system of Sognefjord), are local biodiversity hotspots with regard to high predictive species co-occurrence. We conclude that our predicted northward shifts of centipedes' distributions in Norway are likely a result of post-glacial recolonization patterns, species' ecological requirements and dispersal abilities.\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of Comb and Centipede Multigraft Copolymers P nBA- g-PS with High Molecular Weight Using Miniemulsion Polymerization\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nWang, Wenwen; Wang, Weiyu; Lu, Xinyi; ...\n\n2014-10-23\n\nFor this study, comb and centipede multigraft copolymers, poly(n-butyl acrylate)-g-polystyrene (PnBA-g-PS) with PnBA backbones and PS side chains, were synthesized via high-vacuum anionic polymerization and miniemulsion polymerization. Single-tailed and double-tailed PS macromonomers were synthesized by anionic polymerization and Steglich esterification. Subsequently, the copolymerization of each macromonomer and nBA was carried out in miniemulsion, and multigraft copolymers were obtained. The latex particles of multigraft copolymers were characterized using dynamic light scattering. The molecular weights of macromonomers and multigraft copolymers were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Moreover, the molecular weights and structures of macromonomers were investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight massmoreÂ Â» spectrometry and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The weight contents of PS in comb and centipede multigraft copolymers were calculated by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The thermal properties of multigraft copolymers were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The microphase separation of multigraft copolymers was observed by atomic force microscopy and transmission electronic microscopy. Rheological measurements showed that comb and centipede multigraft copolymers have elastic properties when the weight content of PS side chains is 26â32 wt %. Centipede multigraft copolymers possess better elastic properties than comb multigraft copolymers with the similar weight content of PS. In conclusion, these findings are similar to previous results on poly(isoprene-g-polystyrene) comb and centipede copolymers made by anionic polymerization.Â«Â less\n\nFree amino acid profiling in the giant puffball mushroom (Calvatia gigantea) using UPLC-MS/MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÄ±vrak, Ä°brahim; KÄ±vrak, Åeyda; Harmandar, Mansur\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWild edible and medicinal mushroom, Calvatia gigantea, was quantitatively analyzed for the determination of its free amino acids using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The concentrations of total free amino acids, essential and non-essential amino acids were 199.65 mg/100 g, 113.69 mg/100 g, and 85.96 mg/100 g in C. gigantea, respectively. This study showed that C. gigantea, so called a giant puffball mushroom, has free amino acids content. The essential amino acids: tryptophan, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, leucine, threonine, lysine, histidine, methionine, and the non-essential amino acids: tyrosine, 4-hyrdroxy proline, arginine, proline, glycine, serine, alanine, glutamine, glutamic acid, aspargine, aspartic acid were detected.

This is, to our knowledge, the first report of sex chromosomes in any geophilomorph centipede. Using the recently assembled Strigamia genome sequence, we identified a set of scaffolds differentially represented in male and female DNA sequence. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we confirmed that three candidate X chromosome-derived scaffolds are present at approximately twice the copy number in females as in males. Furthermore, we confirmed that six candidate Y chromosome-derived scaffolds contain male-specific sequences. Finally, using this molecular information, we designed an X chromosome-specific DNA probe and performed fluorescent in situ hybridization against mitotic and meiotic chromosome spreads to identify the Strigamia XY sex-chromosome pair cytologically. We found that the X and Y chromosomes are recognizably different in size during the early pachytene stage of meiosis, and exhibit incomplete and delayed pairing.

JÃ¼lich on soil fungi. Sampling of soil and roots of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. was carried out at 12 P. gigantea-treated and five nontreated control sites representing 1- to 60-month-old clear-cuts and thinned forest sites in Finland and Latvia. The 454-sequencing of ITS rRNA from fine roots, humus and mineral soil resulted in 8626 high-quality fungal sequences. Phlebiopsis gigantea represented 1.3% of all fungal sequences and was found in 14 treated and nontreated sites and in all three substrates. In different substrates, the relative abundance of P. gigantea at stump treatment sites either did not differ significantly or was significantly lower than in nontreated controls. No significant correlation was found between the time elapsed since the tree harvesting and/or application of the biocontrol and abundance of P. gigantea in different substrates. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that P. gigantea occasionally occurs belowground in forest ecosystems but that stump treatment with the biocontrol agent has little or no impact on occurrence and persistence of P. gigantea belowground, and consequently no significant impact on soil fungi.

To better understand the complex karyotypic evolution of E. gigantea, the karyotypes of specimens from five populations in Brazil were investigated using molecular cytogenetics and phylogenetic approaches. Herein, we used FISH with histone genes as well as sequencing of the COI to determine differential distribution of markers and relationships among populations. The analyses revealed new karyotypes, with variability for chromosome number and morphology of multiple sex chromosome mechanisms, occurrence of B chromosome variants (punctiform and large ones), and high dispersion of histone genes in different karyotypes. These data indicate that chromosomal polymorphism in E. gigantea is greater than previously reported, and that the species can be a valuable model for cytogenetic studies. The COI phylogenetic and haplotype analyses highlighted the formation of three groups with chromosomally polymorphic individuals. Finally, we compared the different karyotypes and proposed a model for the chromosomal evolution of this species. The species E. gigantea includes at least three cytogenetically polymorphic lineages. Moreover, in each of these lineages, different chromosomal rearrangements have been fixed. Dispersion of repetitive sequences may have favored the high frequency of these rearrangements, which could be related to both adaptation of the species to different habitats and the speciation process.\n\nAnalysis of the Phlebiopsis gigantea Genome, Transcriptome and Secretome Provides Insight into Its Pioneer Colonization Strategies of Wood\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHori, Chiaki; Ishida, Takuya; Igarashi, Kiyohiko; Samejima, Masahiro; Suzuki, Hitoshi; Master, Emma; Ferreira, Patricia; Ruiz-DueÃ±as, Francisco J.; Held, Benjamin; Canessa, Paulo; Larrondo, Luis F.; Schmoll, Monika; Druzhinina, Irina S.; Kubicek, Christian P.; Gaskell, Jill A.; Kersten, Phil; St. John, Franz; Glasner, Jeremy; Sabat, Grzegorz; Splinter BonDurant, Sandra; Syed, Khajamohiddin; Yadav, Jagjit; Mgbeahuruike, Anthony C.; Kovalchuk, Andriy; Asiegbu, Fred O.; Lackner, Gerald; Hoffmeister, Dirk; Rencoret, Jorge; GutiÃ©rrez, Ana; Sun, Hui; Lindquist, Erika; Barry, Kerrie; Riley, Robert; Grigoriev, Igor V.; Henrissat, Bernard; KÃ¼es, Ursula; Berka, Randy M.; MartÃ­nez, Angel T.; Covert, Sarah F.; Blanchette, Robert A.; Cullen, Daniel\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCollectively classified as white-rot fungi, certain basidiomycetes efficiently degrade the major structural polymers of wood cell walls. A small subset of these Agaricomycetes, exemplified by Phlebiopsis gigantea, is capable of colonizing freshly exposed conifer sapwood despite its high content of extractives, which retards the establishment of other fungal species. The mechanism(s) by which P. gigantea tolerates and metabolizes resinous compounds have not been explored. Here, we report the annotated P. gigantea genome and compare profiles of its transcriptome and secretome when cultured on fresh-cut versus solvent-extracted loblolly pine wood. The P. gigantea genome contains a conventional repertoire of hydrolase genes involved in cellulose/hemicellulose degradation, whose patterns of expression were relatively unperturbed by the absence of extractives. The expression of genes typically ascribed to lignin degradation was also largely unaffected. In contrast, genes likely involved in the transformation and detoxification of wood extractives were highly induced in its presence. Their products included an ABC transporter, lipases, cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase.

This procedure was used to study eremophilane production by D. gigantea under different cultural conditions. The structure-activity relationships of the eremophilanes were investigated using three different bioassays. No distinct functional groups or structural characteristics could be correlated to activity. However, in all three bioassays, the eremophilanes with the higher oxidation states were generally less active. To determine the mode of action, the effects of eremophilanes on the physiology of the plant were studied. Eremophilane bioactivities mimic the activity of known phytohormones.moreÂ Â» Comparative studies indicated that these activities seem not to be associated with induction of known phytohormones but are inherent properties of the eremophilane molecules. The eremophilanes were shown to inhibit protein synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. The proposed mode of action of the eremophilanes is inhibition of protein synthesis. Finally, the fate of the eremophilanes in planta was investigated. ({sup 14}C)-petasol was applied to detached oat leaves (Avena sativa cv. Park) and the radiolabel was traced.Â«Â less\n\nProteomic analysis of muscle between hybrid abalone and parental lines Haliotis gigantea Reeve and Haliotis discus hannai Ino\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDi, G; Luo, X; You, W; Zhao, J; Kong, X; Ke, C\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo understand the potential molecular mechanism of heterosis, protein expression patterns were compared from hybrids of Haliotis gigantea (G) and Haliotis discus hannai (D) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight analyses. Expression differences were observed in muscle samples from the four groups with 673Â±21.0 stained spots for H. discus hannai â Ã H. discus hannai â (DD), 692Â±25.6 for H. gigantea â Ã H. gigantea â (GG), 679Â±16.2 for H. discus hannai â Ã H. gigantea â (DG) (F1 hybrid) and 700Â±19 for H. gigantea â Ã H. discus hannai â (GD) (F1 hybrid). Different 2-DE image muscle protein spots had a mirrored relationship between purebreds and the F1 hybrid, suggesting that all stained spots in F1 hybrid muscle were on 2-DEs from parents. DD and DG clustered together first, and then clustered with GD, whereas the distance of DD and GG was maximal according to hierarchical cluster analysis. We identified 136 differentially expressed protein spots involved in major biological processes, including energy metabolism and stress response. Most energy metabolism proteins were additive, and stress-induced proteins displayed additivity or over-dominance. In these 136 identified protein spots, hybrid offspring with additivity or over-dominance accounted for 68.38%. Data show that a proteomic approach can provide functional prediction of abalone interspecific hybridization.

The dominant vegetative cover was formed by two grasses: Agrostis gigantea Roth. and Agrostis scabra Willd. Testing of 10 clones of A. gigantea from the roast bed and an adjoining area for copper tolerance showed that two clones collected from the roast bed were tolerant to increased copper levels. Copper tolerance was found in clones growing on soils with high copper contents and low pHs. The combination of high copper content and low pH brought about a high level of extractable copper within the soil. Soils withmoreÂ Â» equally high copper levels but higher pHs and therefore low extractable-copper levels did not support copper-tolerant clones.Â«Â less\n\nImaia, a new truffle genus to accommodate TerJezia gigantea\n\nTreesearch\n\nGabor M.

The main metabolite was identified by spectroscopic methods and optical properties as ophiobolin A (1), a well-known phytotoxic sesterterpene produced by several phytopathogenic fungi of important crops and already extensively studied for its interesting biological activities. The other three minor metabolites proved to be related to ophiobolin A and were identified using the same techniques as 6-epi-ophiobolin A and 3-anhydro-6-epi-ophiobolin A (2 and 3) and ophiobolin I (4). Assayed on punctured detached leaves of several grass and dicotyledon weeds, ophiobolin A proved to be on average more phytotoxic as compared to the other related compounds. Some structural features appear to be important for the phytoxicity, such as the hydroxy group at C-3, the stereochemistry at C-6, and the aldehyde group at C-7. Furthermore, grass weeds usually proved to be more sensitive to the phytotoxins than dicotyledons, on which ophiobolin A caused the appearance of large necrosis even at the lowest concentration assayed. This is the first report about the production of ophiobolins from D. gigantea and of the proposed use as potential natural herbicides against grass weeds.\n\nDujardinascaris gigantea sp. n.

The major challenge here is to develop a control scheme that can coordinate their numerous legs in real time, and an autonomous decentralized control could be the key to solve this problem. Therefore, we focus on real centipedes and aim to design a decentralized control scheme for myriapod robots by drawing inspiration from behavioral experiments on centipede locomotion under unusual conditions. In the behavioral experiments, we observed the response to the removal of a part of the terrain and to amputation of several legs. Further, we determined that the ground reaction force is significant for generating rhythmic leg movements; the motion of each leg is likely affected by a sensory input from its neighboring legs. Thus, we constructed a two-dimensional model wherein a simple local reflexive mechanism was implemented in each leg. We performed simulations by using this model and demonstrated that the myriapod robot could move adaptively to changes in the environment and body properties. Our findings will shed new light on designing adaptive and resilient myriapod robots that can function under various circumstances.\n\nKinetic studies of amylase and biomass production by Calvatia gigantea\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKekos, D.; Macris, B.J.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nProduction of alpha-amylase (alpha-4, glucan 4-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.1) by microorganisms has been practiced for many years in small and large scale operations and the literature on this enzyme is voluminous. Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae have been reported as the main fungal species used for commercial production of the enzyme. On the other hand, large volumes of low-cost agricultural products such as acorn (the perisperm-free dry seed contains approximately 60% starch) are wasted in many countries and provide a challenge to biotechnology to efficiently utilize these rich sources of starch for the production of high added value products like enzymes.moreÂ Â» C. gigantea is an edible puffball excreting high levels of alpha-amylase when cultivated on different sources of starch containing elevated quantities of toxic tannic compounds.

CENTIPEDE, a powerful, probabilistic framework for identifying transcription factor binding sites from tissue-specific DNase I cleavage patterns and genomic sequence content, leverages the hypersensitivity of factor-bound chromatin and the information in the DNase I spatial cleavage profile characteristic of each DNA binding protein to accurately infer functional factor binding sites. However, the model for the spatial profile in this framework fails to account for the substantial variation in the DNase I cleavage profiles across different binding sites. Neither does it account for variation in the profiles at the same binding site across multiple replicate DNase I experiments, which are increasingly available. In this work, we introduce new methods, based on multi-scale models for inhomogeneous Poisson processes, to account for such variation in DNase I cleavage patterns both within and across binding sites. These models account for the spatial structure in the heterogeneity in DNase I cleavage patterns for each factor. Using DNase-seq measurements assayed in a lymphoblastoid cell line, we demonstrate the improved performance of this model for several transcription factors by comparing against the Chip-seq peaks for those factors. Finally, we explore the effects of DNase I sequence bias on inference of factor binding using a simple extension to our framework that allows for a more flexible background model.

Natural polymers are the most important materials used in food packaging, micro/nano-drug delivery, tissue engineering, agriculture, and coating. In the present study, natural compounds extracted from plant Lax were designed to function as drug carriers using various surfactants via emulation and solvent evaporation method. Calotropis gigantea belongs to the family Apocynaceae and has received considerable attention in modern medicine, ayurvedeic, siddha, and traditional medicine. Since, we were isolated biodegradable, non-toxic, and biocompatible materials as latex from Calotropis gigantea plant. The Lax was separated as per their solubility nature and it was designed as a carrier using surfactant namely; Sorbitanmonolaurate (Span-20), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The isolated compounds from Lax of Calotropis gigantea were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. To confirm the encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release of the carriers, doxorubicin (DOX) was used as a model natural drug. The hybrid nanocarriers were successfully synthesized through simple solvent evaporation using three surfactants, and the morphology was characterized by SEM and TEM technique. The functionality and crystalline nature of the nanocarriers were confirmed using FTIR and XRD, respectively. Within 90min, the maximum amount of DOX was encapsulated in the carriers, and prolonged cumulative drug release by the nanocarriers was observed. The formulated natural carriers were found to have potentially effective cytotoxic effects on lung cancer cells. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Three growth parameters, extension rate, skeletal density, and calcification rate were evaluated over the past two decade's interval (1988-2013) in different gender of two massive corals Pavona gigantea and Porites panamensis. The species P. gigantea calcified two-times faster (0.84Â Â±Â 0.29Â gÂ cm -2 yr -1 ) than P. panamensis (0.36Â Â±Â 0.15Â gÂ cm -2 yr -1 ); and male colonies presents13-58% higher calcification rates than females. Annual growth parameters do not show significant trends over the period 1988-2013, but significant, growth disruption associated with ENSO events. The data presented here suggest that P.gigantea and P.panamensis from the area have developed phenotypic plasticity to a wide range of environmental condition; the life history of both species is reflected in their calcification rates during both optimal and non-optimal conditions over the last two decades. Massive species develop denser structures that provide a permanent habitat to many marine species and contributes to the long-term maintenance of coral reef communities in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Calotropis gigantea (Linn.) (Family: Asclepiadaceae) is a perennial shrub and it is used as a traditional folk medicine for the treatment of various health complications. But there is no report on isolation of anticancerous chemicals from the flower of Calotropis gigantea. The objective of the present study is to explore the antitumor effect of anhydrosophoradiol-3-acetate (A3A), isolated from the flower of Calotropis gigantea (Linn.) against Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) in Swiss albino mice. Antitumoric effect of A3A was assessed by evaluating viable tumor cell count, survival time, body weight gain due to tumor burden, hematological and biochemical (glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, blood urea, SALP, SGPT and SGOT) parameters of EAC bearing host at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight. Treatment with A3A decreased the viable tumor cells and body weight gain thereby increasing the life span of EAC bearing mice. A3A also brought back the altered hematological (Hb, total RBC and total WBC) and biochemical parameters more or less to normal level. Results of this study conclude that in vivo the A3A was effective in inhibiting the growth of EAC with improving in cancer induced complications.\n\nImpact of windstorm on a community of centipedes (Chilopoda) in a beech forest in Western Poland.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeÅniewska, MaÅgorzata; SkwierczyÅski, Filip\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe study was carried out in the years 2016-2017, five years after a windstorm which destroyed 1/3 of the protected beech forest area in the west of Poland. The community of centipedes in the area affected by the windstorm was depleted in terms of the species richness, diversity, and population density. The dominance structures were shortened and the species composition was rebuilt. The areas that proved to be the richest in terms of species richness and diversity among the sites affected by the windstorm were the one where windfallen trees were left and the other where beech trees had been planted by humans. In total, the quantitative and qualitative samples collected four times throughout a year featured 608 specimens from 11 species of two centipede orders - Lithobiomorpha and Geophilomorpha. Lithobius curtipes and L. forficatus were found in all of the investigated areas. L. pelidnus and L. piceus were captured at control sites exclusively. Only one species - L. erythrocephalus was found solely at the damaged site. The most numerous and most frequently found species in the community were L. curtipes , L. mutabilis , and Strigamia acuminata respectively. Although windstorms are natural phenomena their consequences may lead to significant changes in the community of the investigated soil animals. The importance of coarse woody debris, significantly contributing to the improvement and maintenance of species richness and diversity of Chilopoda, has once again been confirmed.\n\nTocotrienols in Vellozia gigantea leaves: occurrence and modulation by seasonal and plant size effects.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorales, Melanie; Garcia, Queila S; Siqueira-Silva, Advanio I; Silva, Mayara C; MunnÃ©-Bosch, Sergi\n\n2014-08-01\n\nVitamin E occurs in all photosynthetic organisms examined to date. Tocopherols predominate in photosynthetic tissues (Î±-tocopherol being the major form), while either tocopherols or tocotrienols (or both) are present in seeds. Tocotrienols have not been described in photosynthetic tissues thus far. Here, we report on the presence of tocotrienols in leaves of higher plants. Both tocopherols and tocotrienols accumulated in leaves of Vellozia gigantea, an endemic plant found in the rupestrian fields of Serra do CipÃ³, Brazil. Increased plant size had a remarkable effect on the vitamin E composition of leaves, Î±-tocopherol and Î²-tocotrienol levels being highest in the largest individuals, but only during the dry season. Vitamin E levels positively correlated with lipid hydroxyperoxide levels, which also increased in the largest individuals during the dry season. However, the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F v/F m ratio) kept above 0.75 throughout the experiment, thus indicating absence of photoinhibitory damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. It is concluded that higher plants, such as V. gigantea, can accumulate tocotrienols in leaves, aside from tocopherols, and that the levels of both tocopherols and tocotrienols in the leaves of this species are strongly modulated by seasonal and plant size effects.\n\nImplications of seed size for seedling survival in Carnegiea gigantea and Ferocactus wislizeni (Cactaceae)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBowers, Janice E.; Pierson, E.A.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nLarger seeds have been shown to convey benefits for seedling survival but the mechanisms of this process are not well understood. In this study, seed size and seedling survival were compared for 2 sympatric cactus species, Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britt. & Rose and Ferocactus wislizeni (Engelm.) Britt. & Rose, in laboratory and field experiments in the northern Sonoran Desert. Both species have small seeds, but Ferocactus seeds are nearly twice as long and 3 times as heavy as those of Carnegiea. The difference in size is perpetuated after germination: new Ferocactus seedlings have 4 times the estimated volume of new Carnegiea seedlings. In an outdoor experiment, annual survivorship of both species was low but was 6 times higher for Ferocactus (6 seedlings, 8.1%) than Carnegiea (1 seedling, 1.4%). The pattern of seedling mortality in relation to temperature and rain suggests that, after the initial flush of seed and seedling predation, drought and heat took a greater toll on Carnegiea than Ferocactus seedlings, probably because the larger seedling volume of Ferocactus conferred greater drought tolerance. In addition, F. wislizeni could become established without benefit of nurse plants whereas C. gigantea could not; this might reflect differential tolerance to high soil temperatures.\n\nAnalysis of the Phlebiopsis gigantea Genome, Transcriptome and Secretome Provides Insight into Its Pioneer Colonization Strategies of Wood\n\nTreesearch\n\nChiaki Hori; Takuya Ishida; Kiyohiko Igarashi; Masahiro Samejima; Hitoshi Suzuki; Emma Master; Patricia Ferreira; Francisco J.

This study presents the results of the sclerochronology of modern specimens of S. gigantea, collected monthly from Pender Island (British Columbia), and additional modern specimens from the Dundas Islands (BC) and Mink and Little Takli Islands (Alaska). The methods presented can be used as a template to interpret local environmental conditions and increase the precision of seasonality estimates in shellfish using sclerochronology and oxygen isotope analysis. This method can also identify, with a high degree of accuracy, the date of shell collection to the nearest fortnightly cycle, the time of day the shell was collected and the approximate tidal elevation (i.e., approx. water depth and distance from the shoreline) from which the shell was collected. Life-history traits of S. gigantea were analyzed to understand the timing of growth line formation, the duration of the growing season, the growth rate, and the reliability of annual increments. We also examine the influence of the tidal regime and freshwater mixing in estuarine locations and how these variables can affect both incremental structures and oxygen isotope values. The results of the sclerochronological analysis show that there is a latitudinal trend in shell growth that needs to be considered when using shells for seasonality studies. Oxygen isotope analysis reveals clear annual cycles with the most positive values corresponding to the annual winter growth lines, and the most negative values corresponding to high temperatures during the summer. Intra-annual increment widths demonstrate clear seasonal oscillations with broadest increments in summer and very narrow increments or no growth during the winter months. This study provides new insights into the biology, geochemistry and seasonal growth of S. gigantea, which are crucial for paleoclimate\n\nThe growth and phosphorus acquisition of invasive plants Rudbeckia laciniata and Solidago gigantea are enhanced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.\n\nPubMed\n\nMajewska, Marta L; Rola, Kaja; Zubek, Szymon\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWhile a number of recent studies have revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can mediate invasive plant success, the influence of these symbionts on the most successful and high-impact invaders is largely unexplored. Two perennial herbs of this category of invasive plants, Rudbeckia laciniata and Solidago gigantea (Asteraceae), were thus tested in a pot experiment to determine whether AMF influence their growth, the concentration of phosphorus in biomass, and photosynthesis. The following treatments, including three common AMF species, were prepared on soils representative of two habitats that are frequently invaded by both plants, namely fallow and river valley: (1) control-soil without AMF, (2) Rhizophagus irregularis, (3) Funneliformis mosseae, and (4) Claroideoglomus claroideum. The invaders were strongly dependent on AMF for their growth. The mycorrhizal dependency of R. laciniata was 88 and 63Â % and of S. gigantea 90 and 82Â % for valley and fallow soils, respectively. The fungi also increased P concentration in their biomass. However, we found different effects of the fungal species in the stimulation of plant growth and P acquisition, with R. irregularis and C. claroideum being the most and least effective symbionts, respectively. None of AMF species had an impact on the photosynthetic performance indexes of both plants. Our findings indicate that AMF have a direct effect on the early stages of R. laciniata and S. gigantea growth. The magnitude of the response of both plant species to AMF was dependent on the fungal and soil identities. Therefore, the presence of particular AMF species in a site may determine the success of their invasion.\n\nAntibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of Calotropis gigantea L.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRajkuberan, Chandrasekaran; Sudha, Kannaiah; Sathishkumar, Gnanasekar; Sivaramakrishnan, Sivaperumal\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of Calotropis gigantea L. toward biomedical applications. Initially, synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (SPR) at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of silver as a major constituent element. X-ray diffractograms displays that the synthesized AgNPs were biphasic crystalline nature. Electron microscopic studies such as Field emission scanning electron microscopic (Fe-SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that synthesized AgNPs are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. Further, crude latex aqueous extract and synthesized AgNPs were evaluated against different bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Enterococci sp, Shigella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized AgNPs exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Likewise invitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized AgNPs against tested HeLa cells. The output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized AgNPs using latex of C. gigantea can be used as promising nanomater"
