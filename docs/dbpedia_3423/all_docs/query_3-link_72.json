The task of the genealogist, in groping his way amid the dusty records of the past, is much like that of the American Indian, in pursuing an ob- scure trail through a tangled wilderness. An acute faculty of perception, and a keen and practised eye, must note and scrutinize every obscure foot- print, every rustled leaf, every bent twig ; — now progressing rapidly under a clear light, and guided by sure tokens; and anon, suddenly arrested by a total absence of all further signs, and forced hopelessly to abandon the trail, long and patiently pursued ; until perchance again, some new and unexpected way-mark greets his eye, inspiring fresh pursuit. It is easy to see why the vicissitudes, occurring in the progress of such a labor, should be highly exciting, as well as perplexing, and also, why it is, that a relish for it is sometimes acquired so ardent as to become almost a passion. Indeed, were it not for this kind of inspiration, but few, if any, of the valuable family genealogies, of which the last few years have been so prolific, would ever have seen the light; more especially as their prepar- ation involves such a vast amount of patient labor as well as much expense, a remuneration for neither of which, can ever be reasonably expected. The absence of any settled rule or custom, in the early towns of Con- necticut, requiring the public registration of births^ marriages and deaths, and the consequent silence of the records thereon, in so many cases, is a source of great embarrassment to the genealogist. Much of this data must now be gathered from ancient grave stones, old deeds, family papers and other fugitive memoranda, accidentally preserved and luckily discovered; while even much more that would have been most valuable, is now for- ever lost. And, I am constrained to add, that my most formidable and vexatious embarrassments have occurred just where I least expected them. The ancient records were, at least, ever ready to disclose such information as they had ; but the living descendants, to my surprise, have generally evinced a strange reticence to my urgent inquiries ; not one in five of my 6 INTRODUCTION. letters and circulars eliciting any response whatever. Had the simple facts I sought, and which, in most cases, ten minutes labor would have supplied, been promptly sent me, nearly every family line could have been perfected, and at an earlier day. Most of the information, thus unavail- ingly sought, I have been enabled, after much delay and expense, to ob- tain through outside agencies, but quite too much remains unsupplied. The prevailing indifference to ancestry or kinship, which seems a pecu- liar mark of our family, I can not regard as a commendable trait of char- acter. That frame of mind which is entirely careless as \" To whom related, or by whom begot,\" is not a wholesome one ; and from the judgment of those of the clan, who attach but little importance or value to this family Memorial, I appeal to their own posterity, confident that they will better appreciate the motives and labor, involved in its preparation. To this general indifference there are, however, many honorable excep- tions ; and to those genial spirits whose ready zeal has lent such essential aid, and whose warm, fraternal sympathy in the labor, has encouraged and cheered me on, my most grateful acknowledgments are due. There is another reflection, altogether a pleasant one. The family, as a whole, is an honorable and good one ; ranking quite above the average, in moral and social position. Standing as I have been, for several years, at the focal point of a widely extended family correspondence ; gathering in the rays which have come to me from every State and Territory of the Union, I have been highly gratified with the abundant evidence of general intelligence, moral worth, and social standing, which has greeted me from every branch of the sept or clan. Although among us \"one star differeth from another star in glory\" the constellation is an effulgent one. AVe have also the gratifying assurance that our cis-atlantic progenitor, James Morgan, was an honest man ; fearing God and keeping His command- ments; honoring his King and serving his country, in high and important civil stations, in his day and generation ; and his posterity have not dis- graced the proud inheritance of his simple virtues. The illustrative portraits have been selected from the various branches of the family, and are faithful copies from photographs of the respective parties represented. Of the general character of these portraits, in physique and intellectual expression, I have only this to say ; that if any American volume of this kind, has ever exhibited a finer looking galaxy of representative heads, I have not yet seen it. For my own gratification, I have had them all set in an appropriate frame, with a copy of our oldest coat of arras, in proper colors in the center; — a family picture which I shall preserve and cherish, I confess with no little pride, as well as pleasure. INTRODUCTION. 7 Nearly twenty-five years ago, circumstances excited my curiosity to trace back my lineage, if possible, to ray first American ancestor. But as no one had ever before made even a partial attempt, and no record or family tradition concerning him had been preserved, I found the subject involved in such deep obscurity, that I was four or five years in hunting up the trail, and verifying, by unequivocal testimony, my pedigree from James Morgan, of New London; and in 1851, I j)rinted a little pamphlet of this pedigree for private circulation among my own branch. This fact, when established, only gave me new zest for further inquiry, and the purpose began to grow upon me to trace down again, from James, all his male descendants, in their various diverging branches ; and this purpose I have since pursued, steadily, silently and alone, with almost a passion, and with what success, is shown in this family volume. Having brouglit these various lines down to the living generations, by the light alone of the ancient records, grave inscriptions, and other fragmentary links of evidence, gathered up with a zeal and patience akin to that of \" Old Mortality,\" I issued a thousand or more circulars, and opened a wide correspondence by letter, appealing for family data to enable me to complete the modern branches down to the present time. The general neglect, with which that appeal has been met, has already been alluded to. I can account for it only by the fact, that the5e branches had become so utterly separated and alienated from each other, owing to the oblivion of all family history or tradition among us, that we had lost all interest in our common clanship. If this effort to remove this- cloud of oblivion, and to recover our common history and origin, shall have the pleasant effect of again fraternizing the sept, and awakening new emotions of veneration for our common ancestry, 1 shall feel a double pride and pleasure in sending it down to our posterity, associated with my name. Fully impressed with the importance of accuracy in a work like this, I have labored carefully to attain it; but it can not be reasonably expected, where so many names and dates are involved, that no errors, either in the record itself, or in transcribing, transfering, or printing, shall have crept in. More than 5,000 different persons are named in the volume, many of whose names are frequently repeated. Add to these the mass of occur- ring dates, and, in some measure, the caution and vigilance requisite to secure accuracy in each, can be appreciated. There may, in some cases, seem apparent errors, where really none exist ; for it often happens that authorities disagree ; members of the same family persisting in giving different dates ; and sometimes the family register, the town record, and the tomb stone, each giving a different date for the same event. In such cases I have followed what appeared to be the best authority, often clearly 8 INTRODUCTION. verifying the true date by collateral circumstances. From a lack of carefulness in preparing the inscriptions of age upon tomb stone?, and especially from the uncertainty upon the subject in cases where the par- ties have settled and died in sections distant from their nativity, and there- fore isolated from the original records, the discrepancy between the true age, and the age thus inscribed, is a matter of much more frequent occur- rence than is generally supposed. And there may, possibly, be errors in some of the lines of descent, owing to the frequent occurrence of similar names of cotemporary date; as, for example, there were no less than eight Williams of the fifth generation, who were all about the same age, and settled in the same locality, several of whom had children whose names were also alike: ami it has been some- times an exceedingly laborious and perplexing problem to determine satisfactorily, from the records, to which particular family of antecedent Williams these children severally belonged. Every family line has, how- ever, been carefully verified, and it is believed that each line of descent will be found reliable. I think I may claim, for this work, a fuller statement of dates, and a more minute and complete detail of statistical facts, than is found in any other similar volume; and to accomplish this has indeed been by far the most laborious and difficult part of the task. Apprehending that this first effort to trace our early ancestry will also be the last and final one; and fully conscious that the inexorable \"tooth of time\" will soon demolish what is left of the fast-decaying records and other materials, I have sought very diligently and patiently to recover all that can now be saved, con- cerning our fathers, for future preservation. It would have been, compar- atively, an easy task, when the public record of the will of an early ances- tor, names for example, his wife, Mary, and children, John, Isaac and Hannah, to rest with these names only, as is usually done, and to follow up their history. But this by no means satisfied my purpose. What was the surname of wife, Mary? Whose daughter? When married and when did she die? What other children had they, who had died perhaps prior to the will, and therefore not named in it ? What their names ? When born and when did they die? Who and when did they marry? and what the history of all their descendants ? It will be seen, at a glance, that a wide and laborious field of research is opened by this class of in- quiries ; and as the public records often afford no light, old family papers, letters and memoranda, must be resorted to, with a scrutiny, patient and persevering. But the satisfaction I now feel in this unusual complete- ness, more than compensates for the extra time and labor bestowed. INTRODUCTION. 9 The generations are arranged separately, and follow each other in their order, as indicated by the running head title ; but the tenth generation, few in number, is included under the title of the ninth. The individual descendants, whose either parent was a Morgan, are num- bered in consecutive order; the children of daughters, always in italics; but grand-children of daughters or their further descendants, are not num- bered. Sons, for further history, are carried forward to the next genera- tion, with their proper number suffixed in parenthesis. Such further notice of daughters and their descendants, as is given, follows immediately after the family register in which they first occur. It should therefore be noted, that the children of daughters belong to the generation next succeeding that under which they are found. Any particular lineage may be easily traced, either upward or downward, by simply referring, alternately, to the marginal numbers, and the numbers in parenthesis, of the line required. Take my own line for example, page 144, where N. H. is found with its No. (970) in parenthesis. This No. refers back to marginal No. 970, page 81, where N. H. is found to be a son of William A. who is No. (375,) in parenthesis. This in like manner refers back to marginal No. 375, page 45, where William A. is found again as a son of William, No. (163,) in parenthesis. This refers back to marginal No. 163, page 33, where he is found the son of William, No. (46,) in parenthesis, and this William is in the same manner found on page 25, a son of John, No. (4,) in parenthesis, who was son of James, No. 1, page 22. The degree of kinship between any two of these descendants may also be readily found, by tracing both lines upward in like manner, until they unite in a common ancestor, and then noting, in a third column, the several degrees of kinship from that common ancestor, downwards, as in the fol- lowing example ; beginning with the highest numbers at the bottom. What is the degree of kinship between Samuel Morgan, of Albany, No. (857) page 137, and myself, N. H. M. No. (970) page 144? John Morgan, (4) page 25, — common ancestor. James, (44) page 32, William, (46) page 33 — brothers. Samuel, (155) page 43, William, (163) page 45 — 1st cousins. Jonas, (388) page 73, William A. (375) page 80— 2d cousins. Samuel, (857) page 137, Nathaniel H. (970) page 144— 3d cousins. These examples, I trust, will render the plan of arrangement perfectly intelligible to all; and the solution of similar problems in kinship between different branches and descendants, may be a source of gratification and amusement. See also page 244 of Appendix. The abbreviations are the usual ones, viz. ; b. for born ; d. died ; m. married ; s. son ; dau. daughter ; chi. child, or children ; set. settled ; res. resides, or resided ; ab. about, &c. 2 10 INTRODUCTION. The dates are given in \" Old Style,\" as found on record, down to Sept. 1751, when the \"New Style\" was adopted in England; since then, where the dates were evidently continued in Old Style, I have endeavored to reduce all to the present notation. In the double dating, found in the early records of New England, between Jan. 1 and March 25, thus : Feb. lOth, 169f for 1699, I have followed the later date. The \"Puritan year,\" as it was called, commenced with March 25th, which was termed \"first month,\" April \"second month,\" &c. ; hence these double dates. A genealogy of dry names and dates, can have but little interest to the general reader. It is said that when Doct. Noah Webster had got his first American Dictionary into print, he sent a copy to an old friend, not expecting a very erudite examination. In due time his friend acknowl- edged the compliment, with the remark, that the book seemed to abound in good words enough, but that he could not get the run of the story. The same criticism may be applied to volumes of this kind ; and yet a writer in the N. T. Evangelist, eloquently says : \"We were looking carelessly over a genealogy of the Minot family, in the second number of the New England Genealogical Register, when suddenly our eyes were suffused with tears, as they rested on the follow- ing sentence, in the catalogue of the children of Capt. John Minot, who died in Dorchester, 1669.\" \"Martha, b. 22 Sept. 1657, d. single, 23 Nov. 1678, age 21. She was engaged to be married, but d. unmarried, leaving a will in which she directed that at her funeral her betrothed husband, ' John Morgan, jun. be all over in mourning, and follow next after me.' \" \"What a history is there in these few words about Martha Minot, who lived two centuries ago ! The mind runs back in a moment, to those times when almost all New England was a wilderness ; to those days of the old Indian wars, when no man could be a captain without being a man of some rank and consequence. Just after the close of King Phillip's war, when the settlements of New England were all in peace, Capt. John Minot's daughter, Martha, twenty-one years of age, and having come into possession of her share of the estate of her father, had plighted her troth to one she loved and expected to marry, when disease fastened upon her young frame and would not be repelled. In the chill November air, when '' The melancholy days were come, the saddest of the year;\" she faded like a leaf. And at her burial there followed — nearer than brother or sister — nearest of all to the hearse — the one, whom of all others she most loved; from whom to part had been to her more painful than the death-pang; and who had been in her thoughts till \"the love light in her eye,\" was extinguished in death. That single item in her funeral direc- tions, that \"John Morgan, jun. be all over in mourning and follow next after me,\" tells the whole story.\" Nothing seems, at first sight, less interesting, or less instructive, than a genealogical table — a mere register of names and dates. But such a passage as that which is here quoted ; so picturesque, so suggestive, so INTRODUCTION. 1] toucliing, so dramatic — when it occurs in the midst of these dry records throws out an electric light at every link in the chain of the generations. Each of these names, in the table, is the memorial, perhaps the only me- morial, of a human heart that once lived and died — a heart that kept its steady pulsations through some certain period of time, and then ceased to beat, and mouldered into dust. Each of these names is the memorial of an individual human life, that had its joys and sorrows, its cares and burdens, its affections and hopes, its conflicts and achievements, its opportunities, wasted or improved, and its hour of death. Each of these dates of \" birth,\" \"marriage,\" \"death!\" Oh! how significant! What a day was each of these to some human family, or to some circle of loving human hearts. Our Name — its Origin and Antiquity. In preparing this work I have made but little research for anterior transatlantic history. The name itself suggests its early Welsh origin, and history amply corroborates the suggestion. \" Dixon, on Surnames,\" Bos- ton edition, 1857, \"for private distribution,\" thus translates it: Morgan, (Welsh,) By sea, or By the sea ; and in his \"Supplement,'' 1858, Canada West, he adds that, ^''Big head, is a better interpretation, although it can be literally translated By sea, from Ceann mor,\" (Scotch.) Another plausible suggestion is, that it is derived from the Welsh words, More can, signifying Sea horn. And still another theory, which at first appeared to me to be the most obvious and probable of all, attributes its origin to the Anglo Saxon words, morgen, or morgan, for morning; the name denoting generally, an \" Eastern Light ;\" more accurately perhaps, a light or glow coming out from an Eastern sea. But this theory involves the anachronism of tracing to a Saxon root, a name now known to be older in Wales than the advent of the Saxon race or language in the British Islands. Its origin is undoubtedly Celtic. Of its eminent claim to great, even the very highest antiquity, as a surname, there is no room for doubt. It was not only in common use, as such, at the date of the Norman Conquest, as appears from entries upon \"Domes Day Book,\" and \"Battle Roll,\" but for centuries before that event. Lower, in his \" Dictionary of Family Names,\" has this para- graph ; and this is the earliest instance of the use of a surname in Eng- land or Wales, which I find recorded in any history. \"MORGAN; — a Welsh name, of high antiquity. The founder of the Pelagian heresy, in the 4th century [about A. D. 360,] was a true Welshman, a monk of Bangor. His name was Morgan, which signifies? \"o/ the sea,'* and this was correctly latinized Pelagius.\" All other au- thorities agree in giving this name a like antiquity. The general use of surnames was not assumed in England until about A. D. 1070, and was then introduced by the Normans, under William, the 12 INTRODUCTION. Conqueror; though some occasional hereditary surnames, among the old Anglo-Saxon and Welsh families, and among them our own, had existed, as is seen, for many centuries earlier. In Woodward's \" History of Wales from the Earliest Times,\" accounts are given of several sovereign Welsh Princes, and petty Kings, of the name of Morgan ; famous fellows in war, in their day, and formidable barriers against Anglo-Saxon domina- tion and encroachment ; some of them living as far back as A. D. 400. To one of these ancient Kings, Morgan, of Gla-Morgan, about A. D. 725, is accredited the invention and adoption of the \" trial by jury ;\" which he called \"The Apostolic Law;\" for, quoth our regal and pious namesake, — as Christ and his twelve Apostles, were finally to judge the world, — so human tribunals should be composed of the King and twelve wise men. And this, it is seen, was a century and a half prior to the reign of \" Alfred the Great,\" who is generally accredited as the first founder of this form of trial. \" Honor to whom honor is due.\" CONSANGUINEI. There is an error in the popular notion that the transmission of a family name, transmits also its peculiar kinship, or corresponding relation by blood, or family stock. We say, that we are of the Morgan Hneage and blood. True ! as to the mere name, — but not at all true, as to the Mor- gan blood. It may seem a little unj^racious to explode this pleasant fal- lacy, but the truth is, that we inherit no more of this blood than we do that of a thousand other bloods of different names. The son of the first, original, pure Morgan, would have been but a half blood; partaking equally, in theory at least, of the blood of his mother; and his sons, though bearing the distinctive name, would have inherited but one-fourth of the distinctive blood. Had the four grand-parents of our first American ances- tor, James, been severally the first of their race, new creations of pure and unmixed blood, he himself would have been but a quarter-blood Morgan; and of equal kinship with each of his other three grand-parents. His de- scendants, of the second generation, only l-8th blood; of the third, l-16th; of the fourth, l-32d; of the fifth, l-64th ; of the sixth, l-128th ; of the sev- enth, l-256th; of the eighth, l-512th; of the ninth, l-1024th; and of the tenth generation, now living, only l-2048th parts of the Morgan blood; all the other 2047 parts being derived from other sources. In twenty gen- erations, or a period of about 600 years, computing the usual average of thirty years to a generation, the consanguinity, or relationship by blood, becomes less than one drop in a million ; the distinctive name alone re- rnaming. Exceptions arising from occasional intermarriages, may, in some few cases, vary the rula; but not favorably, for the direct tendency of such marriages is to deteriorate, and not to improve the blood. INTRODUCTION. 13 \"Pride of name,\" and \"pride of blood,\" are thus seen to be very differ- ent sentiments. The one, when founded upon an eminent and virtuous lineage, is not only laudable, but virtue inspiring ; the other, a baseless, shallow conceit, without a shadow of foundation for its support. Surely this fact ought effectually to silence every vain-glorious boast of nobler physical, mental or moral endowments,— or \"better blood,\" derived from any mere agnatic or paternal line of ancestry, than mingles in com- mon veins. This pretentious, but empty bubble, bursts, as is seen, upon the slightest touch. But as surely, on the other hand, when a name, which has been borne steadily aloft, in honor, through a long line of virtuous ancestry, is trans- mitted to us to wear, thus adorned with all these accumulated memories, it is our imperative duty to sustain it with true and manly port and bearing ; to bear it still aloft and in honor; and he, who is beyond the reach of these noble and inspiring influences, is indeed a degenerate scion, and all un- worthy of his name. Family Coat of Arms. Several of my correspondents have alluded to traditional \"coats of arms\" of the Morgan name, and some rude copies are still preserved, which, although differing from each other in artistic appendages and adornment, and sometimes in crest, are all alike in color of shield and main device ; an escutcheon in green, bearing a lion, rampant, in gold. At the risk of seeming pretentious of some special attainment in heraldic lore— a pretense which might excite a smile around my fire- side, united in by myself, I nevertheless feel forced by these numerous inquiries to venture a few words upon this subject; and to show, to the curious in such matters, that our family can boast, not only in common with almost every family in our land, of its \"traditional coat of arms,\" but of real, genuine, well authenticated ones, \" as plenty as blackberries.\" Burke, in his \"Encyclopedia of Heraldry,\" describes no less than fifty- five different coats of arms, which have belonged by grant, to various per- sons of our family name; and Berry, in his \"Encyclopedia Heraldica,\" gives thirty-six ; many of them in addition to Burke's list ; from which 1 select a few, as samples, giving under each, in parenthesis, a pretty free translation, as best I can, of the heraldic terms. MORGAN — ar — a lion rampant — sa — ducally crowned — or. (On a silver shield, or escutcheon, a black lion, standing erect upon his hind legs, with paws extended, and with a gold crown upon his head.

On the top, or crown of the shield, as a crest, the upper half of an eagle, in gold, wings spread, and across it, another broad, black, wavy bar, running horizon- tally.) Rather a showy device, and granted 25 March, 1558, to Hugh Morgan, of London. One more sample from the English side, must suffice here, and to this I beg to call the attention of our family. MORGAN [Monmouthshire] — Vert — a lion rampant, or — (On a green shield, a gold lion, erect on hind legs.) T add now a sample of our American \"traditional\" ones, from an old copy now before me, and which some of our family will recognize. MORGAN — Vert — a lion rampant, or — (On a green shield, a gold Hon, erect on hind legs.) It is seen that the last two are identical in description of armorial de- vice and bearing, and as our American progenitor, James, came from the immediate vicinity of Monmouthshire, near the border line of Wales, a fair presumption is raised that, this \" traditional\" coat of arms, is the legiti- INTRODUCTION. 15 mate inheritance of our particular family. The copy before me has, how- ever, added to it, probably by the fancy of some ambitious artist, a highly ornate scroll border in gold; crest, a helmet with closed vizor; shield and helmet crowned with a floral coronal, green and red ; with the family name inscribed on the scroll at the bottom, in place of the usual motto; the whole, making rather a showy display.

JAMES MORGAN OF NEW LONDON, AND HIS DESOEH'DAlSrTS. \"Like leaves on trees the race of man is found; Now green in youth, now withering on the ground. Another race the following spring supplies ; They fall successive, and successive rise. So generations in their course decay ; So flourish these when those have passed away.\" Speech to Diomede, Homer, Book VI. James Morgan, the common ancestor of a numerous family now scat- tered widely over nearly or quite, every state and territory of the United States, was born in Wales, in 1607, but in what precise locality our honest progenitor first saw the light is uncertain, though probably in LlandafF, Glamorgan Co. The family appears to have removed from Llandaif to Bristol, Eng. on the opposite side of Bristol Cliannel, a short time at least, perhaps a few years, prior to 1636. The name of his father is unknown, but there is some traditionary evidence that it was William.* That year, 1636, in the month of March, he and two younger brothers, John and Miles, sailed from Bristol and arrived at Boston, Mass. in April following. John Morgan, his next younger brother, who from tradition appears to have been a high churchman and to have exceedingly disliked the aus- terity of the Puritans, left Boston in disgust for more congenial society in Virginia, soon after their arrival. How far the Morgans of Virginia are descended from him I am unable to say. Miles Morgan, the youngest brother, born in 1615, on his arrival at Bo;?ton, or soon after, joined a party of emigrants, mostly from Roxbury, of whom Col. Wm Pyncheon was at the head, and founded the settlement of Springfield, Mass. * See William. No. 46. 18 MORGAN FAMTLY. He is said to have been under 21 years of age at the commencement of this settlement, and to have suppressed the fact of his minority in order to share in the drawing for house lots, which minors were not privileged to do. It is certain that he drew a house lot and afterwards built upon it ; and it was the homestead of himself during his life, and of his descendants for many years after. It was situated upon the south side of \" Ferry Lane,\" and in 1845 was sold by the Brewer family to the Conn. River Railroad Co. ; their tracks now covering the original lot, and their repair shop standing upon the site of the old Morgan homestead. He married, about 1643, Prudence Gilbert, of Beverly, Mass., who was a fellow passenger with him in the voyage from England. Of this court- ship and marriage, an interesting and curious account is preserved. He had 8 children by this marriage, 4 sons and 4 daughters ; and his wife, Prudence, dying 14 Nov. 1660, he next married Elizabeth Bliss, of Springfield, 15 Feb. 1670, dau. of Thomas, by whom he had 1 son only. His children by Prudence were, Mary, b. 14 Dec. 1644; Jonathan, 16 Sept. 1646; David, 23 July, 1648; Pelatiah, 17 May, 1650; Isaac, 17 March, 1652; Lydia, 8 Feb. 1654; Hannah, 11 Feb. 1656; Mercy, 18 May, 1658 ; and by 2d wife, Nathaniel, 14 June, 1671. This family of Miles Morgan* has numerous descendants in New Eng- land and the western states. The wife of James Goodwin, Esq. of Hart- ford, Pres. of the Conn. Mutual Life Ins. Co. and her brother Junius S. Morgan, banker of London, one of the celebrated firm of George Peabody and Co. are among these descendants. Their father, Joseph Morgan, was the long and widely renowned hotel keeper at Hartford. Homer Morgan, banker and broker of N. Y. city, is also a descendant. Tradition has preserved many anecdotes and events illustrating the prowess and sagacity of this old Nimrod and his five stalwart sons in early Indian warfare. In 1675, when Springfield was attacked and some thirty dwellings, besides barns and other buildings, were burnt by the Indians, a desperate attempt was made upon the dwelling of this dreaded veteran and his sons, but all advances were met with such cool intrepidity and deadly aim, from every window and loophole, by these practiced marksmen, that the astounded savages were forced to retire, leaving numbers of their fore- most warriors dead upon the field, whose bodies they dared not attempt to recover from under the sure aim of the fatal rifle. One of these sons, Pe- latiah, was the next year, 1676, killed by the Indians, on the west side of the river, at what is now Chicopee, age 26. Miles Morgan died 28 May, 1699, age 84 years. * See Appendix. GENERATION I. > 19 James Morgan, the elder brother, and our lineal ancestor, may have settled first at Plymouth according to doubtful family tradition, but when he removed there, if at all, or how long he remained, or of his history while there, I have no account. Wherever he settled at first, he is found in Roxbury, near Boston, before 1640. That year, Aug. 6, 1640, he married there, Margery Hill, of Rox- bury. His eldest daughter, Hannah, was born there 18 May, 1642, and all his 5 other children, except perhaps the youngest, who d. in infancy, were also probably born there. He was made a freeman there 10 May, 1643. He is named as a resident there in the inventory of Jolm Graves, 1646, and was a freeholder there as late as 1650, the same year that he removed to Pequot, (now N. London,) and had a houselot assigned him there. It has been heretofore supposed, by myself as well as others, that James Morgan was one of the party of emigrants called the \" Cape Ann Compa- ny,\" who came to N. London in 1650, from Gloucester, Cape Ann, Mass. consisting of the Rev. Richard Blinman and several members of his society and church at Cape Ann. Miss Caulkins, in her very faithful, able and interesting \" History of New London,\" has considered him as one of that Cape Ann party ; but the evidence is now decidedly against it, for in addi- tion to the facts above recited, showing him to have resided at Roxbury for at least the ten years prior to his removal to N. London, we have the following evidence, showing quite conclusively, as it appears to me, that he was never a resident ot Gloucester. Babson, in his minute and excellent \" History of Gloucester,\" gives from the town records a full nnd complete list of all the early proprietors and settlers of that town from its commence- ment down to 1650, but makes no mention of his name. He also gives the names of all those who removed from Gloucester to N. London about 1650, 13 in all, but there is no James Morgan among them. I am there- fore fully persuaded that he was a settler and freeholder at Roxbury, and thence in 1650 removed to N. London. Early in that year he had lands granted him at Pequot, as the N. Lon- don records show, which were soon after occupied by him as a homestead, \"on the path to New street,\" [now Ashcraft street;] and a further. entry upon the record shows that \"James Morgan hath given him about 6 acres of upland, where the wigwams were, in the path that goes from his house towards Culvers, among tlie rocky hills.\" These tracts were located near the present third burial ground, in the western suburbs of the city of New London ; a location sterile and dreary, and which in a few years was aban- doned by its occupants for homes and broader lands of fairer promise, on the east side of the river Thames. 20 MORGAN FAMILY. He continued to occupy this homestead on the path to New street, or \" Cape Ann Lane,\" as it was called, in honor of the Cape Ann company, who chiefly settled there, until about March, 1657. On the 25 day of Dec. 1656, he sold his homestead and removed soon after, with several others, across the river, upon large tracts of land previously granted them by the town, upon the east side, now the south part of Groton. James Avery, William Meades, and Nehemiah and John Smith, who also had grants of land adjoining to him, were among the first settlers, and the earliest resident farmers upon the east side, now Groton. Grants of land had been made from time to time after 1652-3, by the colony at Pequot, with a liberal hand, upon the east side of the river, comprising the fertile regions of what is now the southern portions of Groton, and these lands were soon after occupied generally by the several proprietors. May 17, 1649. The General Court or Colonial Assembly at Hartford, \" graunted that ye bounds of ye plantation of Pequett shall be foure myles on each side of ye Great Riuer [Thames] and six myles from ye sea northward into ye country — Provided that ye aforesaide bounds bee not distributed to less than forty familyes.\" March 11, 1657, by act of the \" General Court,\" the settlement at Pe- quot was named \" New London in memory of ye renowned Citty of Lon- don,\" and embraced not only what has since been divided and subdivided into several towns on the west side of the river, but also what are now the towns of Groton and Ledyard, on the east side. It was u{)on the east side, as we have seen, that James Morgan early settled, and in a rude log cabin, with his wife and family of three sons and a daughter ; and this territory, made the separate town of Groton, May, 1705, and again divided, by setting off the town of Ledyard in 1836, has ever been, and still remains the prolific hive of our name and family. He was a large proprietor and dealer in lands ; distinguished in public enterprize; often employed by the public in land surveys, establishing highways, determining boundaries, adjusting civil difficulties as a magis- trate, and ecclesiastical difficulties as a good neighbor and a Christian man, in whom all appear to have reposed a marked degree of confidence and trust. He was one of the \"townsmen\" or selectmen of N. London for several years, and was one of the first \" Deputy's\" sent from N. London plantations to the General Court at Hartford, May session, 1657, (at which date he deposed his age to be \"about 50 years;\") and was nine times afterwards chosen a member of that grave and important assembly, the last time in 1670. His associates and compeers composing the General Court or Colonial Assembly, in May, 1657, when he was first chosen, were GENERATION I. 21 John Winthrop, Esq. [of Pequot,] Governor.

It is seen that Southampton, on Long Island, was one^of these plantations. To this carefully selected body of men, was intrusted the whole sove- reign power of the colony, and the administration of its government, in every department, civil, criminal, ecclesiastical and military; embracing original jurisdiction of the most trifling as well as most heinous offences and causes of action, and the minutest details in every department. James Morgan seems to have impressed this grave body of men with a high sense of his sterling honesty and integrity of character, and it appears that in a controversy between the General Court and the N. London plan- tation, about boundaries and jurisdiction, it was ordered that the matter should be submitted to three arbiters, mutually agreed upon. N. London at once named their own townsman, James Morgan, really a party in their own interests, but nevertheless the General Court as promptly accepted him, and without naming another, agreed to submit to his sole decision, which when made, seems to have satisfied all parties. He was an active and useful member of the church under Rev. Richard Blinman's ministry, and his name is prominent in every important move- ment or proceeding. \" James Morgan, Mr. Tinker and Obadiah Brown, are chosen to seat the people in the meeting house, which they doing, the inhabitants are to rest silent.\" Minutes from the record. In 1661, he was one of a committee of the General Court to lay out the bounds of N. London, \" on the east side of the Great River.\" In 1662, he was one of a committee to contract \" for building a house for the ministry,\" at New London. From about this time he signs his name \" James Morgan senior of New 22 GENERATION II. London,\" — his oldest son James, afterwards Capt. James, being then near 21 years of age. This year, 1662, his list on the town assessment, stands the third highest in amount; and among the tax payers of that year, about one hundred in number, only seven had a list exceeding £200. James Morgan's list was only £250, but this was a large estate in those primitive days. The spot where he first built his house in Groton in 1657, and where he ever afterwards resided, and where he died, is a few rods southeast of the present dwelling (1868) of Elijah S. Morgan, about 3 miles from Groton Ferry, on the road to Poquonoe Bridge ; and this patriarchal homestead from that day down to the present occupant, has descended by inheritance, through an unbroken line of James Morgan's, for six generations. And it is worthy of notice, in connection with this fact, that for eight generations as they hereinafter succeed each other, in regular order of individual pre- cedence, each one is headed by the name of James Morgan. He died in 1685, aged 78 years, and his estate was divided soon after his death among his four survivino: children.

Capt. JAMES, (3) b. 3 Mch, 1644, s. of James, ra. \"Mary Vine of Old England,\" Nov. 1666, died 8 Dec. 1711, age 68. His wife Mary died in 1689, of the ''throat distemper,\" so called, a terri ble epidemic which prevailed throughout the country that year, especially in the months of July and August, visiting nearly every family and carry- ing consternation and death in its trail. She was born in P^ngland in 1641, and was 48 years old when she died. After her death he married 2d wife Hannah , born in 1640, who d. in 1711, aged 71, a few days only before his own death, but after the date of his will, in which he calls her his \" dear and loving wife.\" His will is dated in Groton 25 June, 1708, and approved in probate 22 Jan. 1712. In it he bequeaths to his \"dear and loving wife Hannah Morgan,\" his \"horse and chaise,\" barn, and orchard by it, and \" the lower field this side of the cross fence which joineth south brook,\" to enjoy during her life. To his son James, his \"field;\" one half the barn and all his land at home, subject to the joint control and use of his widow, so long as she so remained. Also to James a lot \"in the plain,\" near the salt marsh, \"on the north side of the island.\" To his son William, \"the land he has already a deed of,\" and 100 acres and one little island in Packanacock plain,\" that is, my sons Jas and Wm shall have equally.\" To his \" four daughters, Mercy, [record of birth says Mary,] Hannah, Elizabeth and Jerusha,\" all his cattle, horses and sheep, to be equally divided between them. To his \" grandson James Morgan,\" his saddle, bridle and short gun, and to his \"grandson Wm Morg n,\" his musket. He was an active member and one of the two first deacons of the first church in Groton ; was the principal magistrate, and transacted the chief part of the civil business around him, for many years. At the first town meeting held after the town was incorporated, in Dec. 1705, he was the moderator, and was chosen first townsman or selectman. He was moder- ator of nearly every town or society meeting until near his death in 1711, and after that for many years his place as moderator was supplied by his two sons, Deacon James and Lieut. John, sometimes the one acting and sometimes the other. He was chosen captain of the first \" train band\" in Groton, in 1692, under an order of the Governor and Council, authorizing a military company to be formed there, and had been then two years a captain and commander of the \" dragoon\" force of New London county, under a special commission from the General Court. 24 GENERATION III. Like his father he was one of the Deputies to the General Court from New London from 1689 to 1700, and afterwards one of the first Deputies from the new town of Groton, in 1706; and for several years was a Com- missioner to advise and direct the Pequot tribe of Indians in the manage- ment of their affairs. The military titles of these early days, even down to that of ensign, or sergeant, were esteemed as marks of high distinction, and from their pecu- liar importance, and the care and caution with which the officers were chosen, very justly so. These infant plantations were surrounded by hos- tile tribes of Indians, overwhelming in numbers; exposed constantly to the inroads of prowling bands, often irritated and always treacherous, and their very existence as well as peace and safety, depended much upon the per sonal character, the wise sagacity, prudent counsel and conduct, and the cool intrepidity of these chosen military guardians. Hence it was the early practice, when the leading officers of these \" train bands\" were to be chosen, to open the proceedings by solemn proclamation and prayer, and some- times a special sermon for the occasion was prepared and preached to the company by their minister. Capt. James lived and died upon the old patriarchal homestead of his father James, already described. CHILDREN, ALL BY MARY VINE. 8. James, 6 Feb. 1667, m. Hannah , and second wife Anna . 9.

I had a reference to the case and in- tended to examine it, but lost or mislaid the reference. He also like his father and brother James, was a prominent public man, Indian commis- sioner and adviser, deputy to the General Court in 1690 from New Lon- don, and in 1693-4 from Preston.

He was among the first settlers of Preston, then a part of Norwich, and in 1686, was one of the petitioners for its separation as a town. It was set oflP from Norwich Jan. 1687, and that year Owaneco, Indian sachem, executed to him and others a quit-claim deed of \"all the town territory.

She was the mother of a successive line of three generations of Doctors of the Perkins name, of marked ability and emi- nence in their profession. Doct. Elisha Perkins, of New London, after- wards of New York, the inventor of the celebrated \" Metallic Tractors,\" which for a time made so much noise in the medical world, as a remedial agent and cure for diseases, was one of her descendants. The \" war of the doctors\" about the merits of this invention, was exceedingly fierce and sharp, at home and in Europe, and gave birth to \" Terrible Tractoration ; a Poetical Petition, by Christopher Caustic,\" published in London ; one of the keenest and wittiest brochures of poetical satire in the English language.

He lived on the old noted homestead of his father and grandfather, in South Groton, and died there, 4 May, 1748, age 81. He, like his father, was an active and useful man in all church and civil affairs, drafting and taking acknowledgments of deeds, wills, and other legal instruments, as the principal and almost sole acting magistrate, and until a short period before his death, his name appears generally as mod- erator in all town or society meetings. In his will dated 29 March, 1745, he names the four children which follow, and as this will relates to and describes the patriarchal old homestead alluded to as having descended through six successive James Morgans in lineal order, and was evidently drawn up by himself, I give it entire. \" In the name of God, Amen ; I, James Morgan, of Groton, New London Co. being weak in body, but of sound mind and memory, do give unto my loving wife, one third part of my moveable estate, to be hers so long as she remains my widow. My will is that she improve and enjoy the eastermost part of my dwelling, that is to say, the old room, the bed room, the milk house and the cellar, and also the chamber over, and the garret. Also that she improve, possess and enjoy, during her widowhood, the tract of land butted and bounded as follows : beginning at the brook near my house, where the stones are laid to draw water, thence running in a direct line to the south bars of the east- most of my orchard, till it bear northwardly, and so northwardly with the stone wall and ledge that make my field fence, till it comes to the end of a piece of stone wall standing on the top of the ledge, thence running about southeast on a ledge, to a heap of stones, lying on the south part of the ledge, thence about southerly to a wild cherry tree which stands by the brook, at the first bounds, which tract of land is supposed to contain about 1 4 acres, more or less. Also the benefit of all the fruit growing in the orchard, included in the bounds above, and also the liberty to pasture her creatures in summer season, in my great pasture, during her widowhood. Also it is my will that my wife shall take one of my servants, which she pleases, at inventory price, in pai't of her thirds.

I give to my daughter, Mary Gallup, 150 pounds, to be paid by my son James ; and also one-third of my moveable estate. I give unto the heirs of my daughter, Anna Owen, deceased, 150 pounds, to be paid them by my son James ; also one-third of my moveable estate.

He was liberal and charitable in sentiment and conduct, and was sometimes thought to be so tolerant to- wards those who differed from him in doctrine, as to expose him to criti- cism and censure from the more rigid. But his course was ever peaceful, and his life a useful one. His grave stone in the old burying ground at Poquonoc, bears this significant inscription. \" The Reverend and Pious Mr. John Owen, the second ordained minis- ter in Groton, died Lord's day morning, June 14, 1753, in ye 55th year of his age.\" \"God's Faithful Seer.\" He is said, but upon doubtful authority, to have been a native of Ireland, but more probably was a descendant of .John Owen, of Windsor, Ct., born 1624.

Gurdon Saltonstall, afterwards governor of Connec- ticut. When the first church was established in Groton, 8 Nov. 1704, he was chosen one of the deacons, and the births of his later children are re- corded there on the first records of the town. He died 25 Dec. 1750, aged 82, and his widow, Margaret, died in 1755, and her estate was set- tled that year. CHILDREN. 101. William, 7 April, 1697, m. Hannah Stanton, 21 Sept. 1721. 102.

His wife, Ruth, died earlier, as she is named as his deceased wife, in his will, as also his dau. Ruth Brewster, deceased. All his other children are named as then living, except Experience, who probably died young. He left a large estate in lands and chattels, the latter of which he bequeathed to his daugh- ters, but all his broad acres were given to his only son, John, and the eldest male heir in succession from him, in perpetual entail and undivisible to the end of time. The following extract from his will may gratify those who are curious to learn the notions which were quite common in that day, regarding the entailment of estates. \" I give unto my only and dutiful son, John Morgan, all my lands that I hold by deed from my honored father, and also all the lands that I pur- chased of the town of New London, * * * by entails, that is to say, to him during life, and then to his eldest son, then surviving, and to the eldest male heir of my said son's eldest son, and so on in right line down through the eldest male heir, to the end of tinte, and never to be divided in case such male heir doth not fail.\" He was chosen Lieut, of the first military company or \" train band\" of Groton, 30 of April, 1692, at the same time that his uncle, James Mor- gan, was chosen Capt. and he succeeded his uncle as Capt. 8 Oct. 1714, which office he held until 12 Oct. 1730, when Lieut.

He (lied Oct. 1729, age 36, and his wife, Mary, b. 1696, long outlived him, and died April, 1780, age 84. There is a tradition that this AVilliam used to say that his father, John, had a very old little book, in which was written the name of \" William Morgan, of Llandaff,\" (Wales,) and dated before A. D. 1600, who he said was the father of our first James, the emigrant. There are other circumstances which strengthen the probabilities of this tradition. This William had also a pair of gold sleeve buttons of antique make, and having WM. rudely but plainly stamped on each, which were said to have come down as an \" heir loom\" from William, of Llandaff, and which came into my own possession from ray father, William A. (375), and were long held by me as a precious relic, until stolen a few years ago. By great effort I discovered a trace of them soon after, but all too late to save them from the crucible of an innocent purchaser, by whom they had been melted with a common mass of old jewelry.

Mary Noble, in Canaan, Ct., where she died and was buried in 1807. She was b. 9 Dec. 1711, and was evidently a direct descendant of Elder William Brewster, of the \" May Flower\" company, whose son, Jonathan, first settled in Duxbury, and left several children settled there, when he removed to New London. Capt. Joseph was commissioned 18 May, 1761, by Gov. Thomas Fitch, a captain of the train band of Preston, under King George the 3d, in the first year of his reign. v 34 GENERATION IV. CHILDREN. 166.

JOSEPH, (65) b. 6 Nov. 1671, s. of Joseph, m. . His name stands on the catalogue of Yale College as one of the graduates in the class of 1702, but he was probably not a regu- lar graduate, and the degree of A. B. was doubtless conferred upon him as an honorary one, for according to the \" History of Greenwich,\" Conn, he was settled over first church, Greenwich, in 1697, and in 1700, dismissed and settled over second church, Greenwich. He was also a regular preacher in Bedford, Westchester county, N. Y. in 1699, and was ordained by the Fairfield county association in 1700. From 1704 to 1708, he was again the minister at Greenwich, Ct. In 1709, he was settled as pastor GENERATION IV. 35 of the Presbyterian church in Freehold, New Jersey, and in 1728, was charged before the Synod with \"practising astrology, countenancing pro- miscuous dancing, and transgressing in drink.\" These charges were not sustained. He resigned, however, and took charge of the two churclies, at Hopewell and Maidenhead, N. J. and in 1736, was again charged with intemperance, and suspended from the ministry, but was restored again in 1738, \"on the intercession of many good people.\" He was a preacher of considerable note, and several of his discourses and sermons were pub- lished ; among them, one on the death of his eldest son, Joseph, a graduate of Yale College, 1723, and died the same year; a \"Reply to a Railer against the doctrine of Election,\" 1724 ; \"Sin its own Punishment,\" 1728; and \"Love to our Neighbors,\" third edition, 1749. The sermon on tlie death of his son was entitled \" A Discourse at Freehold, in New Jersey, Upon the Sorrowful Occasion of the Death of the Young and very Hope- ful Joseph Morgan, of Yale College, B. A. who departed this Life tlie 28 of Nov. 1728.\" It was printed by Samuel Green, at New London, and presents nothing very striking, either in thought or style of expression. In his letters dated at Freehold, in 1721 and 1722, he speaks of his two sons, one age 17, and the other 1 1, \"as good scholars,\" and \"one other son a little older;\" this last evidently the Joseph whose death is above alluded to. Efforts have been made by several others as well as by myself, to trace the history of this Rev. Joseph Morgan to its close, and a further account of his posterity, but hitherto without success. CHILDREN. 178. Joseph, about 1702, died 28 Nov. 1723, graduate Yale College, and at least two other sons, 179 born about 1705, and 180 about 1711, and perhaps other children ; no further traces of either of whom have been found unless the Doct. John Morgan, professor in the Medical College, Philadelphia, whose history is given by Doctor Titus Morgan, [see APPENDIX,] was from this Joseph, either a son or grandson, an hypoth- esis which seems probable. 36 GENERATION V.

He afterwards removed to Stonington borough, and died there, as his grave stone shows, 14 May, 1778, in his 82d year.

His widow, Mary, was living, and signed a deed as late as 31 March, 1796. His father, WilHam, in 1749, just before his own death, gave this son, Solomon, a deed of the family homestead in Groton, containing 250 acres of laud, and he probably lived and died upon the place. It passed again by deed from him to his oldest son, liev. Solomon, of Plainfield, in 1783, who never occupied it, and who afterwards conveyed it to his brother, Nathan. His tomb stone in the old family grave yard on the original patriarchal homestead bears this tribute to his memory: \"Esteemed for his integrity, peaceableness and fidelity, and his Christian life and character.\" CHILDREN. 209.

His ministry over this church continued until Nov. 5, 1798, over 29 years, when the state of his salary, totally inadequate to support his large family of young children and an invalid wife, led to a dismissal. \" His subsequent life was filled with wanderings, trials and removals,\" and he died in 1824, in Ohio, aged 79. He and Anna had 11 children, viz. — 217 Anna Kin- ney, born 1771, (m.

Sarah Cobb, 17 April, 1728, settled in Groton, (now Ledyard,) d. Feb- 1771, age 71, and his wid. Sarah d. in 1780. His will is dated 15 Feb. 1771, proved in Stonington probate, 12 April, 1771, and mentions his wife, Sarah, and all the following children, except Elkanah, as then living. It is apparent from other indications that Elkanah was dead before 1764, and probably died early in life. He was chosen Ensign of the N. East Co. of Groton, 11 Oct. 1736. Lieut, of the same Co. 26 Sept. 1738, and in 1844, Sept. 27, Captain ; it being at the last date called the 4th Co. of Groton. When chosen Ensign, in Oct. 1736, Thomas Mumford was chosen Captain, and Wm. Williams, Lieut. Eight of the leading citizens of Groton, among them Capt. John Morgan, father of the Ensign, sent a remonstrance to the \" General Court against granting commissions to these officers, because, as they allege, 1st, The two chief officers are young men of the church of England, 2d, Illegal votes were cast. 3d, The young men of the company were deluded with liquor. 4th, Many dissatisfied will enlist in the troop. 5th, The society is in difficulty on account of the church of England, and they are about to settle a minister.\" The connection between choosing these officers and settling a minister, is not very obvious to the present age, at first view, but it should be re- membered that our good old puritan ancestors, having at this period in their history, quelled all fear of the Pequots, were now greatly alarmed at the inroads of another, almost equally dreaded foe. Rev. Samuel Seabury, their first minister, after preaching among them ten Sabbaths, four at the house of this Capt. John Morgan, and four at the house of his brother, deacon William, gave notice of his becoming a convert to the Episcopal church. That at once terminated his stay among them. His successor, the Rev. Mr. Punderson, ordained 29 Dec. 1729, after preaching accept- ably for five years without exciting suspicion of his faith or doctrines, as- tonished them all, on the first day of January, 1734, by suddenly avowing himself also a convert to this same \"church of England.\" His connection was of course at once severed, and for the two years following they were without any minister. And now, after this sorrowful experience, they were just on the eve of settling the Rev. Andrew Croswell, (subsequently ordained 14 Oct. 1736,) as their third perilous experiment; and it should not be considered a subject for very flippant persiflage, or severe censure, 40 GENERATION V. if they were a little alarmed, lest the influence of their military leaders, as an open foe without, uniting with the influence of their ecclesiastical lead- ers as a covert foe within, sliould carry the puritanic citadel and lay waste the vineyards of their goodly Zion. The \" General Court,\" however, after several days patient hearing of the parties at Hartford, together with a crowd of witnesses, much of whose testimony still appears in the minutes on record, finally decided against the remonstrants and granted the com- missions; and the Rev. Mr. Croswell proving to be sound in the faith of his people, and a faithful sentinel upon their watch tower, no dire calam- ity followed. CHILDREN. 237. John, 28 July, 1720, m.

ABIJAH, (143) b. 6 July, 1715, s. of Samuel, has left no trace on record which I have been able to discover, but while this work is in press, a letter from Ambrose Morgan, of Oswego, N. Y. raises a strong presumption that he is a descendant from this Abijah, as thus: his grandfather was Abijah, born about 1749, in New London co. Conn. ; his father was Abijah, a carpenter, born at or near Colchester, Conn, probably about 1772, and he himself was born in Colchester, 5 Oct. 1795. I therefore engraft what I have been able to get in time, of his family, in this line of Abijah, being satisfied by the facts sent, and espe- cially by the stated traditions of the family, that it belongs here.
