        "text": "This paper illustrates a tradition of English renaissance stage characters that read or carry books on stage. Each of these characters exhibits a mental illness or mental deficiency of some sort. The paper argues that the book is specified as emblematic of an extreme mental condition (i.e. melancholy, foolishness, or madness). In the second part, the paper illustrates a tradition in earlier Catholic penitential exemla (i.e. tales promoting the sacrament of shrift, or penance) where a ghost (or a devil) carries a book containing all the sins of the protagonist of the exemplum and with which he will be judged at the end of his life. The paper argues that this tradition gives precedence to the books carried on stage in Shakespeare's Hamlet and to the ghost of Old Hamlet, and through the influence of Hamlet to the subsequent symbolic use of the book in the tradition illustrated at the opening of the paper.\n\nThis paper re-examines the evidence that the York Play as a text can be read into the period following Arundel's Constitutions, questioning the form that the cycle took in the early fifteenth century and placing the texts in the extant York Register in a later ecclesiastical context more favourably disposed to vernacular scripture in England.\n\nCorpus Christi, the quintessential expression of later medieval Eucharistic devotion, was widely marked by processions of the Host, but also by varieties of tableaux performance and sometimes by actual drama. The case of the York Play made up of a large number of pageants representing a biblical narrative from the Creation to Doomsday and performed by the city's crafts is well known and the extant texts are much studied. Although apparently first documented in 1376, the earlier history remains obscure. Recent scholarship emphasizes organization and hence control from above—and specifically by the city government—almost from the beginning. The present article hypothesizes an evolutionary model and suggests that a series of Passion tableaux performed by artisanal guilds developed into a more elaborate cycle once mercantile crafts, connected to civic government, came to be involved. It suggests a possible performance of the city's Creed Play ca. 1420 may have been crucial in this process. Keywords"
