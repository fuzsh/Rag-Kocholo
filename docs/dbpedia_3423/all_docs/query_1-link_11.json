        "text": "1. c.1377 The lazy priest Sloth is ignorant of his Paternoster, but knows ‘rymes of Robyn Hood,’ the earliest certain mention of England’s greatest outlaw hero, in William Langland’s Piers Plowman. Its full title is — The Vision of William concerning Piers the Plowman, together with Vita de Do-wel, Do-bet, et Do-best, secundum Wit et Resoun; usually given in Latin as Visio Willelmi de Petro Plowman, &c.; the whole work being sometimes briefly described as Liber de Petro Plowman. Described as a Middle English allegorical narrative poem, the work was written in unrhymed alliterative verse, divided into sections called passus. It is now recognized that there are three existing versions: A, the poem’s short early form, dating from the 1360s; B, a major revision and extension of A made in the late 1370s; and C, a less ‘literary’ version of B dating from the 1380s (Robin appears in B and C), and apparently intended to focus the work’s doctrinal issues. Some scholars think that version C may not be entirely attributable to Langland. Multiple manuscripts of each of these versions survive, although none appear to be in the author’s own hand. Each manuscript is unique, making the textual tradition of Piers Plowman one of the most complex and interesting in medieval English literature. There is also another text known as Z. The poem takes the form of a series of dream visions dealing with the social and spiritual predicament of late 14th-century England. His bitter attacks on political and ecclesiastical corruption (especially among the friars) quickly struck a chord with his contemporaries – a theme that was to continue through the centuries. In the 16th century Piers Plowman was issued as a printed book and was used for apologetic purposes by the early Protestants.\n\nLangland’s authorship is asserted by Walter W. Skeat (1886) who informs us that the work contains several references to the Christian name William: First, the titles and colophons frequently call him Willelmus; Secondly, the author repeatedly calls himself Wille; and in one passage (B. xv. 148) he says ‘I haue lyued in londe, quod I, my name is longe wille,’ which seems to suggests he was tall. Thirdly an old note in MS. Dublin D. 4. I (of the C-text, now MS. 212), in handwriting of the 15th century, records: Memorandum, quod Stacy de Rokayle, pater Willielmi de Langlond, qui Stacius fuit generosus, et morabatur in Schiptone under Whicwode, tenens domini le Spenser in comitatu Oxon., qui predictus Willielmus fecit librum qui vocatur Perys ploughman – ‘It should be noted that Stacy de Rokayle was the father of William de Langlond; this Stacy was of noble birth and dwelt in Shipton-under-Wychwood, a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of Oxfordshire. The aforesaid William made the book which is called Piers Plowman’. There is also an old note in one of the Ashburnham MSS. to the effect that ‘Robert or william langland made pers ploughman’ (in a handwriting of the 15th century, on the fly-leaf of a MS. copy [of the B-text] formerly belonging to Lord Ashburnham, and now in the British Museum). In three MSS. (of the C-text; one not later than 1427) occurs the following colophon: ‘Explicit visio Willelmi W. de Petro le Plowman.’ The meaning of W. is unclear; it may mean of Wychwood, or Wigornensis, i.e. of Worcester. John Bale gave him the name Robertus Langlande, as appears from a MS. note in his handwriting in the same Ashburnham MS. Bale in his Scriptorum illustrium majoris Britanniae catalogus (1557–59, reprinted 1977), records that ‘Robertus [?] Langelande, a priest, as it seems [?], was born in the county of Shropshire, at a place commonly known as Mortymers Clibery [i.e. Cleobury Mortimer], in a poor district eight miles from the Malvern hills. I cannot say with certainty whether he was educated until his maturity in that remote and rural locality, or whether he studied at Oxford or Cambridge, though it was a time when learning notably flourished among the masters in those places. This is at all events certain, that he was one of the first followers [?] of John Wiclif; and further, that in his spiritual fervour in opposition to the open blasphemies of the papists against God and his Christ he put forth a pious work worthy the reading of good men, written in the English tongue, and adorned by pleading fashions and figures, which he called ‘The Vision of Peter the Ploughman.’ There is no other work by him. In this learned book he introduced, besides varied and attractive imagery, many predictions which in our time we have seen fulfilled. He finished his work A.D. 1369, when John of Chichester was mayor of London’.\n\nLittle is known of Langland’s life, he was born around 1332 and died in about 1400, although there is some belief that he died in 1385 or 1386. Skeat (1886) in his notes on the authors life, reinforces the belief that he was born in Cleobury Mortimer in Shropshire and that his father was Stacy de Rokayle who afterwards held a farm under one of the Despensers in the parish of Shipton-under-Wychwood in Oxfordshire. There is another possibility, the author describes the A version as having been partly composed in May (A. prol. 5) whilst wondering on the Malvern Hills. Skeat thought that he may have attended school at the priory at Great Malvern, or at the lesser one at Little Malvern, which has led to the possibility that his place of birth was in Worcestershire or Herefordshire. He moved to London and lived in Cornhill with his wife Kitte and his daughter Calote ( Skeat; C. vi. 1, 2; xvii. 286; viii. 304 (and note); xxi. 473; B. xviii. 426), and tells us that he lived like a loller or idler. He records that he made his living by going from house to house singing for men’s souls, and was a tonsured clerk; he also has many allusions to his poverty.\n\nReference is made to Piers Plowman in the uprising of 1381 (see The Many Robin Hoods 3). The first recorded owner of a copy of Piers Plowman was Walter de Brugge, an English-born clergyman and judge in fourteenth-century Ireland, who died in 1396. Robert Crowley (see no. 208 below) may have been the author of a book entitled Pyers plowmans exhortation . . . . of c. 1550. First published by Crowley in 1550, The Vision of Pierce Plowman was an edition so popular, that it was reprinted twice in the same year (following John Bale, Crowley named the author as ‘Robert Langland’ in a prefatory note). The three impressions vary textually, and Crowley may have known of at least four different MSS: two (or possibly three) B versions, on which his edition was largely based, and one MS. each of A and C (Kane and Donaldson 7, King 328-29). In 1560-61 there appeared Owen Rogers’s edition of both The Vision of Pierce Plowman (badly reprinted from Crowley’s third edition) and Pierce the Ploughman’s Crede, an anonymous alliterative verse satire (written between 1393 and 1401) influenced by Langland’s Piers Plowman and by Wycliffite writings (reprinted from Reyner Wolfe’s 1553 edition). In 1813 the best MS. of the C-text appeared in an edition by Dr. Whitaker. In 1842 Mr Thomas Wright printed an edition from an excellent MS. of the B-text in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge (2nd ed., 1856, new ed., 1895). Dr. Morris printed a considerable portion of the A text for the first time in 1867 (Specimens of Early English, Oxford; pp. 249-290). A complete edition of all three texts was printed for the Early English Text Society as edited by the Rev. W. W. Skeat, with the addition of Richard the Redeless, and containing full notes to all three texts, with a glossary and indexes, in 1867-1885. The Clarendon Press edition, by the same editor, appeared in 1886, re-issued in 1954, reprinted as recently as 1979, and was used as a model by one of the two modern scholarly editions of the poem, that of A. V. C. Schmidt (1995). There is a good translation of the B Text by Jonathan F. Goodridge (1959; rev. ed. 1966). A convenient series of selections from the C Text is provided by Elizabeth Salter and Derek Pearsall, eds., in Piers Plowman (1967). George Kane edited the A text in 1960; the B text, edited with E Talbot Donaldson, appeared in 1975; the C text, with George Russell, in 1997. Numerous interpretations of the poem have been undertaken. Representative selections from some of these are provided in Edward Vasta, Interpretations of Piers Plowman, 1968. A good introduction to the poem appears in Raymond W. Chambers, Man’s Unconquerable Mind: Studies of English Writers from Bede to A. E. Housman and W. P. Ker, 1939 (see also, Derek Pearsall, Piers Plowman: the C-text Corrected, Exeter medieval English texts and studies (University of Exeter Press, 1994); Charlotte Brewer, Editing Piers Plowman: the evolution of the text, Cambridge studies in medieval literature 28 (Cambridge University Press, 1996); A. V. C. Schmidt (ed.), Piers Plowman: a new translation of the B-text, Oxford world’s classics (Oxford University Press, 2000); J. A. Burrow, ‘The structure of Piers Plowman B XV-XX: evidence from the rubrics’, Medium Ævum 77 306-12, 2008; Linne Mooney, Estelle Stubbs and Simon Horobin, Late Medieval English Scribes: CUL MS Gg.4.31, 2011). The so called Z-text of Piers Plowman, discovered in the 1980s, was found in MS. Bodley 851, and is of greatly contested authorship. Within the text there is an inscription which identifies the manuscript as the property of Brother John Wells, a Monk of Ramsey, who was possibly an Oxford scholar and opponent of Wyclif (see also: A. G. Rigg and C. Brewer (eds), Piers Plowman; the Z version, Toronto, 1983; A. V. C. Schmidt, (ed.), Piers Plowman / a parallel-text edition of the A, B, C and Z versions, London, Longman, 1995). There is (possibly) a record of Robin Hood that is earlier than Piers Plowman, in the correspondence that records ‘Robin Oed’s Bay‘.\n\n2. 1390? A Robin Hood quotation in Cambridge University Library.\n\n3. 1400? A date for the composition of the Gest, suggested by scholars such as F. J. Child and J. C. Holt. More recently, a later date has been suggested (see Robin Hood: A Complete Study of the English Outlaw, Stephen Knight, Oxford, 1994, pp. 46-8; Robin Hood: The Early Poems, 1465-1560: Texts, Contexts, and Ideology, Thomas H. Ohlgren and Lister M. Matheson,Newark: University of Delaware Press, 2007; Early Rymes of Robyn Hood: An Edition of the Texts, ca. 1425 to ca. 1600, Thomas H. Ohlgren and Lister M. Matheson, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 2013).\n\n4. c.1400-25 ‘Robyn hod in scherewod stod’ written in a Lincoln Cathedral manuscript, the first of many similar phrases (see no. 13 below).\n\n5. c.1405-10 The author of the religious work Dives and Pauper, castigates those who would rather go to the tavern to hear a tale or song of Robyn Hood, than hear Mass. This long prose treatise which explores the meaning of the Ten Commandments, was written in Middle English, in dialogue form, by an unknown author. The only comparable work may be John Wyclif’s De mandatis divinis. Dives and Pauper opens with a fairly short dialogue, ‘Holy Poverty’, in which the speakers are, as in the body of the treatise, Dives, a rich layman, and Pauper, a well read poor preacher. Dives sets out to prove that Pauper, a learned man, is a fool because he fails to make use of his intellect to gain wealth for himself. In reply, Pauper rebukes the arguments of Dives and tries to prove that Dives is a fool because, in pursuing worldly gain, he risks his chance of ‘heuene blysse’ in the life after death. The work survives in eight manuscripts and several manuscript fragments, all dating within the first two thirds of the fifteenth century. The only other printed texts were by Richard Pynson (ed., at Temple Bar, London, 1493) which was based on Bodleian MS. Eng. th. d. 36,5 and simply reset by Wynken de Worde (ed., Westminster, London, 1496), and again by Thomas Berthelet (ed., Fletestreet, London, 1536 (see, Dives and Pauper, ed., Priscilla Heath Barnum (Volume 1, Part 1) published for The Early English Text Society, Oxford University Press, 1976; Dives and Pauper, ed., Priscilla Heath Barnum (Volume 1, Part 2) published for The Early English Text Society, Oxford University Press, 1980; Dives and Pauper, ed., Priscilla Heath Barnum (Volume 2) published for The Early English Text Society, Oxford University Press, 2004).\n\n6. c.1405-10 Hugh Legat (fl. 1400) a Benedictine monk of St Albans Abbey, composed a vernacular sermon in which he quoted: ‘for mani, manime seith, spekith of Robyn Hood that schotte never in his bowe’ (Three Middle English Sermons from the Worcester Chapter MS. F. 10, ed. D. M. Grisdale, Leeds, 1939, p.8). Little is known of Legat’s life, he was probably a native of Hertfordshire, and may have been a member of the family which held a manor at Abbots Walden in that county, belonging to the monks of St. Albans. According to John Bale (Scriptorum illustrium majoris Britanniae catalogus (1557–59, reprinted 1977), he was brought up in the monastery school at St. Albans, where he displayed a strong love for learning, and went with the abbots leave to pursue his studies at Oxford. Legat’s first appearance in the St. Alban’s records occurs in 1401, in the list of the electors of William Heyworth as abbot. He probably went to Oxford no later than 1405, as he had completed his bachelor degree in theology by 1412. There he remained for several years, not to complete another degree, but by his own account, to take advantage of the favourable conditions to devote himself to the study of the classics. He was the author of at least one model letter of rhetorical style, commentaries on the Architrenius of Jean de Hauteville and Boethius’ Consolatio (now lost), together with several Latin and English sermons. A contemporary of Thomas Walsingham the historian (precentor of the abbey), Legat may have fallen foul of abbot Heyworth’s successor John Wheathampstead. Legat was removed from St. Albans to serve the neighbouring dependent cell of Redbourne, then in 1427 he was sent to the cell of the abbey at Tynemouth. Legat’s sermons were circulated amongst monasteries in the south-west and survive in collections compiled at St. Peter’s, Gloucester, and Worcester (see A Monastic Renaissance at St Albans: Thomas Walsingham and His Circle C.1350-1440, James, G. Clark, Oxford (2004); Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 32, by Robin Hood was almost certainly known to Geoffrey Chaucer, as a variant of Legat’s proverb appears in his Troilus and Criseyde of the 1380s.\n\n7. 1417 Two royal writs of 1417 and a further letter of 1429 refer to a renegade chaplain of Linfield in Sussex. Robert Stafford assumed the name of ‘Frere Tuk’ and committed several crimes in Surrey and Sussex with his retinue.\n\n8. 1419-20 A similar version of Legate’s proverb (see no. 6 above) appears in Reply of Friar Daw Topias to Jack Upland.\n\n9. c.1420 Andrew of Wyntoun (c.1350 – c.1423) a Scotsman, was the first chronicler/historian to mention Robin Hood. In his Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland, he locates Robin Hood and Little John in Barnsdale and Inglewood in c. 1283. There is also a mysterious entry concerning Hude of Edname (an unknown place) who helped Alexander Ramsay take Roxburgh in 1342. This is regarded as a reference to Robin Hood in David Laing’s edition, as can be seen in his index (vol. 3, p. 415). Wyntoun himself tells us that he was a canon at St. Andrews, and then became prior of St. Sers Inch at Loch Leven. The exact period during which he held the office of Prior is uncertain, but it appears that from 1395 to 1413, he publicly acted in that capacity. The first to place Robin in an historical context, his metrical history was written at the request of his patron Sir John Wemyss of Leuchars, Fife. The latter part of his Chronicle at least, was written when he approached old age. His first intention was apparently to limit his work to seven books, but afterwards changed to nine books. The last lines of Book Nine suggest that the work was finished after the death of Robert Duke of Albany, and before the return of James I from his captivity in England, or between the third of September 1420 and April 1424. In reference to the title of his work, Wyntoun explains that it is called ‘Orygynale’ not because it was his own composition, but because it is a history from the beginning, or as he saw it, from the creation of angles. One of the few long examples of Middle Scots writing, and written in eight-syllabled couplets, the Chronicle is a prime historical source for the later 14th and early 15th centuries. It contains a valued account of the death of the Scottish hero Robert Bruce, and is the original source for the encounter between Macbeth and the weird sisters that appears in Shakespeare’s Macbeth. David Laing lists eleven surviving manuscripts, although not all are complete: The Royal Manuscript (British Museum); The Lansdowne Manuscript (British Museum); The Cottonian Manuscript (British Museum); The St. Andrews Manuscript (University Library of St. Andrews); First Edinburgh Manuscript (Advocates Library Edinburgh); Second Edinburgh Manuscript (Advocates Library Edinburgh); The Wemyss Manuscript (Wemyss Castle, Fife); The Auchinleck Manuscript (The library of Sir Alexander Boswell of Auchinleck, Bart., now the property of Mr. John Ferguson, Duns, Berwickshire); The Harleian Manuscript; The Panmure Manuscript (belonging to the Earl of Dalhousie); and the Seton Manuscript (bought by Laing from Mr. T. Rodd, who purchased it at the sale of Mr. George Chalmers’s library in 1842). The first edition of the Chronicle (based on the Royal manuscript) was published by David Macpherson (London, 2 vols., 1795); the second edition was produced by David Laing (‘The Historians of Scotland’, Edinburgh, 3 vols., 1872-79); the current standard edition was edited by F. J. Amours for the Scottish Text Society as The Original Chronicle of Andrew of Wyntoun: Printed on Parallel Pages from the Cottonian and Wemyss MSS., with the Variants of the Other Texts (Edinburgh, 6 vols., 1903-14).\n\n10. 1422 A cartulary of Monkbretton Priory mentions a stone of Robert Hode in the fields of Slephill in Barnsdale.\n\n11. c.1425 A manuscript of Troilus and Criseyde with a reference to the proverb of Robyn Hood (see no. 8 above, and no. 19 below).\n\n12. 1426-27 Exeter, Devon: The first know occurrence of Robin Hood plays or games in the Municipal Records that mention twenty pence being paid lusoribus ludentibus lusum Robyn Hode – ‘for the players playing the play (or game) of Robin Hood’ (in the presence of the Mayor); Exeter Receivers Rolls – cited in C. Radford, ‘Early Drama in Exeter’, Transactions of the Devonshire Assoc. 67 (1935) 367. This section contains information found in The Early Plays of Robin Hood, David Wiles, Cambridge, (1981), pp. 43 and 64, and Robin Hood a Mythic Biography, Stephen Knight, Cornell University Press, (2003), Chapter 1, p. 8. See also [The Records of Early English Drama Project, University of Toronto (REED), Devon, 89].\n\n13. 1429 ‘Robin Hode in Barnesdale stode’ is quoted by a judge in the Court of Common Pleas, the first of many similar phrases to appear in English courts. (see W. C. Bolland and J. Ritson). This is a later variant of no. 4 above.\n\n14. 1432 In the return of members of parliament for Wiltshire, a humorous clerk included ‘Adam, Belle, Clyme, Ocluw, Willyam, Cloudesle, Robyn, hode, Inne, Grenewode, Stode, Godeman, was, hee, lytel, Joon, Muchette, Millersson, Scathelok, Reynoldyn’ (Public Record Office, C219/14/3, part 2, no, 101). As well as an early mention of Robin Hood, this clerk gives us the first known reference to the outlaws in the tale of Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough and William of Cloudesley. His mention of Little John, Much the Miller’s son, Scatheloke and Reynolde, suggest he may also have know of a version of the Gest –Little John calls himself ‘Reynolde Grenelef’ in his encounter with the sheriff (stanza 149) and ‘Reynolde’ appears as a character distinct from Little John in stanza 293. Also ‘Robyn, hode, Inne, Grenewode, Stode’ is a variant of the earlier phrase (see no. 13 above).\n\n15. 1438 The Aberdeen M S. Council Register in 1438 has a case in which a ship called ‘Robyne hude’ or ‘ly Robert hude’ figures, Vol. IV pp. 133, 134. (Mediaeval Plays in Scotland, A. J. Mill, Edinburgh, 1927, p. 23). The naming of this ship is probably due to the legend.\n\n16. 1439 Piers Venables assembled many misdoers and ‘in manere of insurrection, wente into the wodes in that contre, like as it hadde be Robyn hode and his meyne’.\n\n17. 1440s The Scotsman Walter Bower (1385-1449) was the second chronicler/historian to mention Robin Hood (see no. 9 above), in his Scotichronicon, a long history of Scotland written in Latin, in which Robin and Little John are placed among the disinherited of the 1260s. His recitation of Robin’s exploits, such as hearing mass in a secluded woodland spot, gives us the only record of a play/song/tale that has not survived. He also mentions ‘comedies and tragedies,’ a revelation about the diversity of the legend at this time. The most elaborate work of literature to survive from before the Reformation of 1560 in Scotland, the Scotichronicon is a national treasure for the information it provides.\n\nBower himself tells us that he was born in Haddington in East Lothian in 1385. Nothing is known of his parentage, though he was possibly related to John Bowmaker rector of Monyabroch, and Alexander Bowmaker, an Augustinian canon of St. Andrews and teacher of law in the university there. The Scotichronicon (probably meaning ‘A History Book for Scots’) was composed while Bower was serving as abbot of the Augustinian abbey on Inchcolm, an island in the Firth of Forth. A law and theology graduate of the new university of St. Andrews in East Fife (founded 1410), he played a prominent part in the royal administration of the country under King James I until that king’s murder in 1437. By the early 1440s he appears to have been involved in the affairs of the minority government of the young James II. In the 1440s, he must have undertaken his first known literary task, the compilation on Inchcolm of the Scotichronicon. Bower first had his scribe copy out the works written in the 1360s by the earlier Scottish chronicler John of Fordun. In his Prologue Bower tells us that his initial aim was to transcribe a copy of Fordun’s Chronicle in five booksand to continue it (in fact for a total of eleven more Books), making use of what are now called Fordun’s Annals. With the help of a single scribe throughout, he produced and revised his vast book in the years up to his death in 1449, making additions to Fordun’s work. Bower contributed more and more as Fordun’s work became more scrappy after the mid-twelfth century, until he ended with contemporary history of his own period down to 1437.\n\nBower must have known of the Original Chronicle of Andrew of Wyntoun, as both had been canons of St Andrews; their respective dating for Robin’s activities is not far apart (see no. 9 above). Although there is a close similarity in the selection of topics for inclusion in the two chronicles, Bower is scarcely if ever dependent of Wyntoun for his information or interpretation. Of the six surviving manuscripts, the Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS. 171, is apparently Bowers own. The first part of the Fordun-Bower corpus of manuscripts to be printed was published in Oxford in 1691 by Thomas Gale (1635/6-1702). Included in his Historiae Britannicae, Saxonicae, Anglo-Danicae Scriptores, is a text of Fordun’s Chronicle from book I to book V Chapter 11 inclusive. In 1722 Thomas Hearne published the Chronica Gentis Scotorum of John of Fordun (most of which had been incorporated by Bower in his book) which Hearne wrongly and confusingly called the Scotichronicon. It was not until 1759 that the whole work of Scotichronicon was printed in two folio volumes in Edinburgh under the editorship of Walter Goodall, titled Joannis de Fordun Scotichronicon cum Supplementis et Continuatione Walteri Boweri. There were plans for a new edition and important groundwork on some of the manuscripts was published in 1885 by David Murray in The Black Book of Paisley and Other Manuscripts of the Scotichronicon. Goodall’s edition remained the only full version of Bower’s work with no English translation until the 1980s, with the publication of the first of several volumes under the general editorship of D E R Watt. There is also a shortened version of the full text which by 1444 was being prepared by Bower for readers who wanted a less lengthy work. This survives in its fullest form as copied (before 1480) in the Coupar Angus MS. (Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland, Adv. MS. 35. 1. 7), also known as the Book of Cupar. Another work, the Liber Pluscardensis by an unknown author, is founded mainly on Bower’s Scotichronicon, but in some passages is a first hand narrative by the chronicler as an eye-witness of the events he describes. Here we see the entry for Robin Hood, but no mention of Little John. This work survives in six manuscripts, and was possibly compiled as early as 1461. It was first printed in part (the eleventh book) for the Maitland Club by Mr. Joseph Stevenson (The Life and Death of King James the First of Scotland, 1837), and first edited as a complete work by Felix J. H. Skene (Vol. 1, Edinburgh, William Paterson, 1877). Another version of the Scotichronicon is the Extracta e Variis Cronicis Scocie probably written in the early sixteenth century. It was published by the Abbotsford Club in 1842, and edited by W. B. D. D. Turnbull, from a manuscript that was in the possession of the Sinclair family of Roslyn, and now in the Advocates Library. In the introduction Turnbull notes that on the flyleaf at the beginning of the manuscript volume, and in other places, is written ‘W. Sanctclair of Roislin, knecht,’ Furthermore Turnbull also mentions annotations made throughout the manuscript by William Sinclair (x-xiii). The Robin Hood passage in Extracta only consists of Bower’s story of Robin’s veneration of the Mass, and links Robin and other outlaws with Simon de Montfort’s rebellion. Against this passage Sinclair has written ‘1255. Robert Hwd and Lytell Jhon ves alywe in Bernesdall and Plwmden Park. Anno Domini 1265. Robert Hwyd wes forfaltit for fechten in batell aganes the Kyng of Ingland at Heweshame’.\n\n18. 1441 A group of labourers in Norfolk blocked the highway threatening to murder a certain Sir Geoffrey Harsyk and were fiercely singing: ‘We are Robynhodesmen, war, war, war’ (King’s Bench Roll, 1441).\n\n19. c.1450 A manuscript of Troilus and Criseyde which reads ‘Thei spekyn of Robynhod but thei bente never his bowe’, another reference to the proverb (see no. 11 above).\n\n20. 1450 The nickname Robin Hood used by one of the captains involved in an abortive rising in eastern Kent (Lordship and Learning: studies in memory of Trevor Aston, edited by Ralph Evans, Boydell Press, 2004, p. 175).\n\n21. c.1450 A probable date for the ballad Robin Hood and the Monk (see The Rhymes of Robin Hood 10).\n\n22. c.1450 The tale of Robyn and Gandeleyn, possibly an illusion to Robin Hood and Gamelyn (see The Tale of Gamelyn).\n\n23. c.1452 A poem of sixteen lines refers to Robin Hood and Geoffrey Coke in an account of the royal household. Part of a document sold at Sotheby’s in 1980, it was bought by Bernard Quaritch Ltd for Professor T. Takamiya. In an article published in 1989, Holt and Takamiya suggest that the poem was a ‘Rhyme of Robin Hood,’ a hitherto unrecorded manuscript version of an unrhymed nonsense carol. The document also contains the names of royal yeomen or other household officials, and information about these men establishes that the account was drawn up before August 1457, and probably before May 1452. The poem is written in a fifteenth century hand, possibly not much later than the hand of the account. Part of the poem appears later in John Rastell’s Interlude of the Four Elements (see no. 121 below). Holt and Takamiya suggest that the two opening lines were taken from A Gest of Robyn Hode: The equivalent lines in Rastell’s text are indicated as R 1-20.\n\nR1 Robyn Hudde in Bernsdale stode* 2 He leynyd hym tyll a maple thystyll 3 Then came owre lady and swete seynt Andrew 4 Slepes thow wakes thow Geffrey Coke 5 A hundreth wynter the water was brawde 6 I cannot tell yow how depe 7 He toke a gose neck in hys hond 8 And ouer the water he went 13 Jack boy ys thy boo i-broke 14 Or hase any man done the wryugulde wrage 19 He toke a bend boo in hys hond 20 And set hym down by Þe fyre — My dame began to spyn a threde — Hyr nose stode all acrokyd into the sowth — Who dar be so harde darde — As to cack under the walles of Dover\n\n*Here again is the well known phrase (see no. 14 above). Holt and Takamiya see the poem as a ‘manifestation of a varying tradition, and that tradition had some literary quality’. On the other hand Thomas Ohlgren states that it ‘bares (other than the first two verses) absolutely no resemblance to any known Robin Hood poem. Lacking a rhyme scheme and coherence, it can hardly be called a poem at all’ (see English Manuscript Studies 1100-1700, Vol 1, Peter Beal and Jeremy Griffiths, ‘A New Version of A Rhyme of Robin Hood’, J. C. Holt and Toshiyuki Takamiya, Oxford, 1989, pp. 213-221; Robin Hood: The Early Poems, 1465-1560 : Texts, Contexts, and Ideology, Thomas H. Ohlgren and Lister M. Matheson, Newark: University of Delaware Press, 2007, p. 20.\n\n24. 15th century Robin Hood mentioned in Burlesques; the reference to ‘Combur’ (p. 84) must be Cumberland, the setting for Adam Bell (see no. 14 above) and Inglewood (in Cumberland) is a setting for Robin Hood (see no. 9 above). The reference to Robin Hood in MS Porkington, No. 10. f. 152 (p. 85) also appears in A Lytell Geste of Robin Hode: With Other Ancient & Modern Ballads …, vol. 1, p. 55, John Mathew Gutch, London, 1847; the manuscript is available on the National Library of Wales website, where it is now called Brogyntyn ii. 1; the reference to Robin Hood is on f. 153 r. (see ‘Robin Hood in Outlaw/ed Spaces: Media, Performance, and Other New Directions’, edited by Lesley Coote and Valerie B. Johnson, with an article by Stephen Knight, pp. 192-3: Routledge, 2017.\n\n25. 15th century A Gest of Robin Hood referred to in How the Plowman learned his Pater Noster, obviously influenced by Piers Plowman (see no. 1 above), printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1510 (see also ‘How the Plowman Learned His Paternoster’, in The Oxford Book of Medieval English Verse, ed. C. Sisam and K. Sisam (Oxford, 1970), pp. 514-21).\n\n26. 15th century Robin Hood mentioned in Song on Women.\n\n27. 15th century A manuscript of Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne rescued from destruction in a Shropshire house by Thomas Percy, bishop of Dromore, Ireland (see also The Dramatic Fragment and no. 104 below).\n\n28. c.1460’s In 2009 Julian Luxford ( University of St Andrews) announced the discovery of the following note in a copy of Ranulf Higden’s Polychronicon: Circa h[ec] temp[or]a vulg[us] opinat[ur] que[n]da[m] exlegatu[m] dict[um] Robyn hode cu[m] suis co[m]plicib[us] assiduis latrocinijs apud shirwode & alibi regios ﬁdeles Anglie infestasse (Eton College MS 213, f. 234r). Luxford’s translation reads: ‘Around this time, according to popular opinion, a certain outlaw named Robin Hood, with his accomplices, infested Sherwood and other law-abiding areas of England with continuous robberies’ (for the full article see J.M. Luxford / Journal of Medieval History 35 (2009) 70–76). As Luxford points out, the note was written (possibly by a monastic in the 1460s) in the margin of that part of Higden’s history that referred to the reign of Edward I, placing Robin between the years 1294 and 1299. Furthermore he suggested that the note showed a wholly negative opinion about Robin, but another translation (Paul Booth, 2013) may suggest otherwise: ‘Around this time, according to popular opinion, a certain outlaw named Robin Hood, with his accomplices, constantly attacked and stole from the faithful (servants) of the king of England at Sherwood and elsewhere’.\n\n29. 1460-80 Robin Hood is substituted for Bevis of Hampton in a manuscript of The Canterbury Tales.\n\n30. 1471 The Compound of Alchymie; or, the Twelve Gates leading to the Discovery of the Philosopher’s Stone,dedicated to Edward IV, is the best known work of the Yorkshireman Sir George Ripley (c. 1415 – 1490), an Augustinian canon and influential alchemist, who gives us yet another variant of the Robin Hood proverb (see no. 19 above). Ripley apparently travelled to Italy and Germany where he acquired the necessary alchemical knowledge to compose his works, which were undertaken upon his return to England. The Compound, composed in Middle English verse dated 1471, was translated into Latin as the Liber duodecim portarum. Latin translations of Ripleian works were already circulating in manuscript in France and Italy by the early 1570s. There was an English print edition by Ralph Rabbards (George Ripley, the Compound of Alchymy … Divided into twelue gates … Set foorth by Raph Rabbards Gentleman, studious and expert in archemicall artes (London, 1591), and Elias Ashmole (Teatrum Chemicum Britannicum. Containing severall poeticall pieces of our famous English philosophers, who have written the hermetique mysteries in their owne ancient language …, London, 1652). Rabbards’ text is reproduced with some spelling emendations in a more recent edition (George Ripley’s Compound of Alchemy (1591) ed. Stanton J. Linden, Aldershot, 2001). Over the period 1595–1649, the Liber duodecim portarum was published in three Latin editions. Two of these, edited by the Frenchmen Bernard Gilles Penot (c . 1522–1620) and Nicolas Barnaud (c. 1539–1604?), were subsequently reprinted in the monumental Theatrum chemicum, ensuring wide diffusion throughout the seventeenth century.\n\nOther works by Ripley include: The Marrow of Alchemy, or Medulla philosophiae chemicae, published in 1614, and Liber Secretissimus, which has the subtitle, ‘The Whole Work of the Composition of the Philosophical Stone and Grand Elixir, and of the First Solution of the Grosse Bodies.’ The ‘Ripley scrolls’ were copied for the most part in the 16th and early 17th centuries by various artists from a now lost original version (or versions). Although they are named after George Ripley, there is no evidence that Ripley designed the scrolls himself. The dense imagery of the alchemical emblems derives from Ripley’s poetry and illustrates the various processes involved in the preparation of the philosopher’s stone. Twenty-three of these scrolls are now known to exist. The Bodleian houses five of them; others are held in various institutions in Britain, America and France. His Alchemical writings were studied by many notable people, including Robert Boyle (considered to be the first modern chemist), John Dee, and Isaac Newton (see Jennifer M. Rampling, Early Science and Medicine 17, Brill (2012), pp, 477-499; Jennifer M. Rampling, ‘Establishing the Canon: George Ripley and His Alchemical Sources,’ Ambix, 55 (2008), 189-208; eadem, ‘Catalogue of the Ripley Corpus: Alchemical Writings Attributed to George Ripley (d. c. 1490),’ Ambix, 57 (2010), 125-201; Lawrence M. Principe, ‘Ripley, George,’ in Claus Priesner and Karin Figala, eds., Alchimie. Lexicon einer hermetischen Wissenschaft (Munich, 1998), 305-6; Joachim Telle, ‘Ripley, George,” in Lexikon des Mittelalters, vol. 7 (Munich, 1995), 861.\n\n31. 1473 ‘Seynt Jorge and Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham’ appears in a letter written by Sir John Paston to his brother. The famous Paston letters give us an invaluable insight into life at the time. They consist of a large quantity of correspondence between the Paston family, members of the gentry of Norfolk, and others connect with them, as well as some state paters and other important documents. Written between the years 1422 and 1509, they were first published by John Fenn across some 5 volumes, beginning in 1787. A more accurate edition in three volumes by James Gairdner (London, 1872-1875) contained over four hundred letters for the first time. A new and complete edition of six volumes, containing 1088 letters and papers, edited by Gairdner in 1904, is considered an authority. Subsequent works include those of Norman Davis (Clarendon Press 1971-1976) and Richard Beadle and Colin Richmond (Oxford, 2005).\n\n32. 1474-75 Thame, Oxfordshire: 26s. 9d. received of Robin Hood’s Ale at Whitsun [W. P. Ellis, ‘The Churchwardens Accounts of the Parish of St. Mary Thame, Commencing in the Year 1442,’ Berkshire Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire Archaeological Journal 19 (1913), 22].\n\n33. c. 1475 The only surviving text of an authentic medieval play, which records the first known instance of Friar Tuck in the Robin Hood saga; commonly known as The Dramatic Fragment.\n\n34. 1476-77 Croscombe, Somerset: St. Mary’s churchwarden’s accounts record 40s. of ‘Roben Hod’s recones’ from Thomas Blower and John Hill; Hill was churchwarden that year [The Records of Early English Drama Project, University of Toronto (REED), Somerset, 86]. One of the earliest known references to the impersonation of Robin Hood in village plays.\n\n35. 1480s John Rous (c.1411-1491), or Rows as he called himself, was an antiquarian born in Warwick. He placed Robin Hood and Little John in the reign of Edward I or Edward II, which he recorded in his history of the Earls of Warwick known as The Rous Roll or the ‘Warwick Rolls’. They exists in two parallel versions. The English version was in the library of the Duke of Manchester, but is now in the British Library (B. L., Add. MS. 48976; see C. E. Wright, ‘The Rous Roll: The English Version’, British Museum Quarterly, xx (1955-6), 77-80), and the Latin version has been in the possession of the College of Arms since 1786 (A. G. B. Russell, ‘The Rous Roll’, Burlington Magazine xxx (1917), 23-31, with illustrations). The two versions appear to have been written during the reign of Richard III, and the last portion between September 1483 and April 1484 (Rous mentions Richard’s son, Edward, created Prince of Wales on 9th September 1483, but did not know of his death in the following April). Both were written on rolls of parchment, and are elaborately illustrated with the portraits and heraldic badges not only of the earls of Warwick, but of many British and English kings before the time of Henry VII. An imperfect copy of the English version is in Lansdowne MS. 882, from which Thomas Hearne printed extracts in an appendix to his Historia Ricardi II (1729). A better transcript by Robert Glover is among the Ashmolean MSS. 839, No. 8. The English version (in the possession of the Duke of Manchester) was first printed by William Pickering (London, 1845), with the title ‘This rol was laburd & finished by Master John Rows of Warrewyk.’ It was published with an introduction by William Courthope in 1859; this was published again in 1980 as ‘The Rous Roll’ with an introduction by Charles Ross. As for the Latin version, some of the drawings have been reproduced from it by James Dallaway (Inquiries Into the Origin and Progress of the Science of Heraldry in England … (London, 1793). Two appear in Charles William Spicer’s History of Warwick Castle (Westminster, 1844) and in Caroline Halsted’s Richard III as Duke of Gloucester and King of England (2 vols., London, 1844). A transcript, made in 1636, by William Dugdale (who freely used all Rous’s extant collections in his Antiquities of Warwickshire) is in the Bodleian Library (Ashmol. MS. G. 2). Some portions are printed in the notes to Courthope’s ‘Rows Rol.’\n\nRous was educated at Oxford, and in about 1445 he was appointed a priest or chaplain of the chantry or chapel at Guy’s Cliffe, formerly called Gibcliff, near Warwick, which Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (d. 1439), built in 1423. He was appointed either by Earl Richard or his son, Duke Henry, last male of the Beauchamp line (d. 1446). During his forty or more years at Guy’s Cliffe, Rous devoted much of his energy to antiquarian studies, and in writing the ‘Warwick Rolls’, he derived his information from a variety of sources. He made a number of journeys to consult chronicles, and occasionally records. Places he visited include London (where he saw an elephant), North Wales and Anglesey, and Glastonbury Abbey. Among the other surviving works of John Rous is Historia Regum Angliæ, a history of the kings of England, which is extant in manuscript in the British Museum (Cotton. MS. Vesp. A. xii). A transcript supposed to have been made for Archbishop Parker, is in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and another transcript, made by Ralph Jennings, is now in the Bodleian Library. The latter was printed by Hearne in 1716 (2nd edit. 1745). Apparently Rous also wrote a life of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, which is now in Cotton. MS. Jul. E. iv. It is adorned by fifty-three drawings of the earl’s adventures, followed by two pages of pedigree ornamented with half-length figures of the persons mentioned. All the designs, with Rous’s text, are engraved in Joseph Strutt’s A Compleat View of the Manners, Customs, Arms, Habits . . . . (2 vols., London, 1775). The text alone figures in Hearne’s ‘Historia Ricardi,’ 1729, ii. 359–71. Unfortunately all of Rous’s other works, together with his library, housed in a room above the north porch of St. Mary’s Church, Warwick, were destroyed in the disastrous fire which devastated most of Warwick in 1691 (see The Itinerary of John Leland . . . . 1535-43, ed. Lucy Toulmin Smith (5 vols., 1907-10), ii, 157, 165-6; T. D. Kendrick, British Antiquity (1930), 19; Victoria County History, Warwickshire, viii, 513, 534). Rous also wrote a treatise, ‘De Episcopis Wigorniæ,’ a few extracts from which are in Ashmolean MS. 770, f. 33. The work is lost; but a quotation from it is preserved in Robert Plot’s ‘Natural History of Staffordshire’ (Oxford, 1686, p. 407). John Leland also ascribes to him works on the antiquity of the town of Warwick, on the antiquity of Guy’s Cliffe, against a false history of the university of Cambridge, an unfinished account of the antiquities of the English universities, a chronicle which he entitled ‘Verovicum,’ and a tract on giants, especially of those who lived after the flood (Leland, Collectanea, iv. 110, 211, 221). Information on Rous was found in The Rous Roll with an introductionby Charles Ross, Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, 1980; Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 49.\n\n36. 1481-82 Croscombe, Somerset: 40s. 4d. collected from John Halse and Roger Morris ‘for Robin Hod’s revel.’ Morris was a churchwarden that year [The Records of Early English Drama Project (REED), University of Toronto, Somerset, 87].

[Peniarth 53, Prifysgol Cymru, v (Caerdydd, 1927), pp. 51-2]. The Peniarth Manuscripts, also known as the Hengwrt-Peniarth Manuscripts, are a collection of medieval Welsh manuscripts originally collected by Robert Vaughan (c.1592–1667), of Hengwrt, Merionethshire. Now in the National Library of Wales, the collection contains some of the oldest and most important Welsh manuscripts in existence.\n\n59. c. 1500 A manuscript of the ballad Robin Hood and the Potter (see The Rhymes of Robin Hood 10).\n\n60. 1500+ A ‘Robynhode Well’ near Nottingham is mentioned in a presentment at the civic sessions of 20 July 1500, also known as St. Anne’s Well (see Robin Hood Place Names).\n\n61. 1500 Edinburgh, Lothian: Andrew Ross is made a citizen by Robin Hood; James Dun is made a citizen by William Halkston as Little John [Mill, Medieval Plays, 219].\n\n62. 1500 Glastonbury, Somerset: St. John Baptist churchwardens accounts include 40s. received for Robin Hood and the parishioners. 14s. is also paid for a coat for Robin Hood, and 8d. for a pair of lined hose for Robin Hood [REED: Somerset, 126].\n\n63. 1500-1 Croscombe, Somerset: 15s. received of Robin Hood and Little John [REED: Somerset, 89].\n\n64. 1501 The dreamer sees Robin Hood and ‘Gilbert with the quhite hand’ (one of Robin’s men in the Gest) in Venus’s mirror, along with Rauf Coilyear, John the Reeve, Piers Plowman and Finn MacCool, in a rather silly stanza of the poem The Palice of Honour. This poem, in Older Scots, is the earliest work of the Scottish poet, translator, and bishop, Gavin Douglas (c. 1474 – 1522), which was dedicated to King James IV. It has been described as a dream vision, on the theme ‘where does true honour lie.’ A member of a powerful family, he was a younger son of Archibald Douglas, fifth Earl of Angus. It is likely that he was born at Tantallon Castle in East Lothian, that being the chief residence of the Earl of Angus. Douglas matriculated at St. Andrews University in 1490, and completed his master’s degree there in 1494, probably living mainly in Edinburgh in the later 1490s. He was installed as Provost of the collegiate church of St. Giles, in Edinburgh by March 1503, where apparently all his literary work was composed.\n\nOther surviving works attributed to Douglas are: Conscience, King Hart (uncertainly attributed to Douglas), and his major work Eneados, a Scots verse translation of Virgil’s Aeneid, the first direct translation of the whole Aeneidto be made in Britain,his final literary achievement, completed in July 1513. Douglas also played an important part in a troubled period in Scottish history. He abandoned his literary career for political activities after the Battle of Flodden (September, 1513) in which James IV of Scotland was killed, creating a struggle for power between rival Scottish factions. The marriage of the king’s widow, Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII, to Douglas’s nephew, gave the Douglas family almost royal status, and aligned them with the pro-English faction in Scotland. Douglas became bishop of Dunkeld in 1516, and the queen’s chief adviser, becoming involved in a series of intrigues to advance her cause and the power of his family, which led ultimately to his downfall. In 1521 he was forced by political enemies to flee to England, where he remained in exile until his death in London from the plague. In his last years he found comfort in his friendship with an Italian humanist, Polidoro Vergilio. No contemporary manuscripts of The Palis of Honoure are known to exist, but there are complete copies of two sixteenth-century editions entitled: THE / PALIS OF / Honoure Compyled by / Gawyne dowglas Bys- / shope of Dunkyll. / Imprinted at London in / fletstret, at the sygne of / the Rose garland by / wyllyam / Copland. / God saue Quene / Marye.

Two copies of Charteris’s edition survive, one at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh, and the other at Edinburgh University Library. There is also fragments of an edition printed by Thomas Davidson at Edinburgh, dated to c. 1535 (STC 7072.8), which is housed at Edinburgh University Library (see also The Palice of Honour . . . , presented to the Bannatyne Club by John Gardiner Kinnear, Edinburgh, 1827; The Poetical Works of Gavin Douglas . . . , John Small, vol. 1, Edinburgh and London, 1874; The Shorter Poems of Gavin Douglas, edited by Priscilla J. Bawcutt, Edinburgh, Blackwood for The Scottish Text Society, 1967 (reprint 2003); Gavin Douglas: The Palis of Honoure, ed. David J. Parkinson, Medieval Institute Publications, Michigan, 1992).\n\n65. 1501-2 Thame, Oxfordshire: 20s. gathered by Robin Hood at the May Ale at Whitsun [References courtesy of Alexandra F.

S. Fry, 1896). Fabyan belonged to an Essex family, members of which had been connected with trade in London. He was a member of the Drapers company, alderman of Farringdon Without, and served as sheriff in 1493-94. In 1496 he was one of those appointed to make representations to the king on the new impositions on English cloth in Flanders. Next year he was one of the aldermen employed in keeping watch at the time of the Cornish rebellion. He resigned his aldermanry in 1502, on the pretext of poverty, apparently in order to avoid the expense of mayoralty. He had, however, acquired considerable wealth with his wife Elizabeth Pake, by whom he had a large family. He spent his latter years on his estate of Halstedys at Theydon Garnon in Essex. Two manuscripts survive (Holkham Hall, MS 671, and BL, Cotton MS Nero C.xi), and although they are not in Fabyan’s own hand, it is believed that the text is his.\n\nFabyan’s chronicle was first published by Richard Pynson in 1516, as The New Chronicles of England and of France. This edition ends with the reign of Richard III., and may represent the work as Fabyan left it, but with the omission of an autobiographical note and some religious verses, which form the concluding remarks of his history. The note and verses are first found in the second edition, printed by John Rastell in 1533 with continuations down to 1509. A third edition appeared in 1542, and a fourth in 1559 with additions to that year. The only modern edition is that of Henry Ellis (1811). In the note that is mentioned above, Fabyan himself says: “and here I make an ende of the vii. parte and hole werke, the vii. day of November in the yere of our Lord Jesu Christes Incarnacion M.vc. and iiij.” This seems to prove that in 1504 he did not plan any extension of his chronicles beyond 1485. The continuations printed by Rastell are certainly not Fabyan’s work. But Stow in his Collections (ap. Survey of London, ii. 305-306, ed. C. L. Kingsford) states that Fabyan wrote ‘a Chronicle of London, England and of France, beginning at the creation and endynge in the third year of Henry VIII., which both I have in written hand.’ In his Survey of London (i. r9r, 209, ii. 55, 116) Stow several times quotes Fabyan as his authority for statements which are not to be found in the printed continuations of Rastell. Some further evidence may be found in other notes of Stow’s (ap. Survey of London, ii. 280, 283, 365-366). Richard Hakluyt also prints an extract from Fabyan’s chronicle, given to him by John Stow, which was presumably in manuscript form, as it is not contained in any printed edition of Fabian. In the heading Hakluyt says it is ‘a note of Sebastian Gabote’s voyage of discovery.’ It therefore seems certain that Fabyan had continued his Chronicle to 1511, but no trace of the manuscript can now be found. John Bale claimed that the 1516 edition was burned by Cardinal Wolsey (see also The New Chronicles of England and France in Two Parts by Robert Fabyan, Henry Ellis, London (1811); Encyclopedia Britannica, vol 10, (1911); Narrative and Critical History of America: English Explorations and Settlements in North America 1497-1689, Vol. III, Chapter I, Charles Deane, Library of Alexandria, USA).\n\n68. 1502-3 Croscombe, Somerset: 40s. received of Robin Hood [REED: Somerset, 89].\n\n69. 1503 Robin Hood pageants and ‘Greneleef’ recorded again in the Great Chronicle of London (London, Guildhall Library, MS. 3313), which has been ascribed to Robert Fabyan (see no. 67 above). The ‘Great Chronicle’ owes its name to C. L. Kingsford, the author of English Historical Literature in the Fifteenth Century, published in 1913. He wrote (pp. 90-1), ‘But most important of all, the work quoted by John Stow as ‘Fabian’s MS.’ has recently come to light and proved to be the fullest and most valuable copy of the London Chronicles we possess,’ and he declared (p. 77) that it might ‘fitly be described as The Great Chronicle.‘ John Stow had the manuscript of the ‘Great Chronicle’ in his possession, adding marginal notes, and he borrowed largely from it for his Survey of London of 1598, and for his Chronicles of 1580, as well as for the successive editions of his Annales of 1592, 1601 and 1605 (see no. 262 below). Another owner of the manuscript was John Foxe (see no. 197 below) into whose possession it came between 1563 and 1570. Another probable owner was Edward Hall (see no. 95 below). Fabian’s Chronicle, the Great Chronicle, and another document Vitellius A XVI, appear to be indebted to a lost London Chronicle, which Kingsford named ‘the main City Chronicle’. See The Great Chronicle of London, A. H. Thomas and I. D. Thornley (London, 1938); Imagining Robin Hood: The Late Medieval Stories in Historical Context, A. J. Pollard, Oxfordshire and New York, 2004, p. 175.\n\n70. 1503 Perth, North Sea Coast: The King pays four French crowns to Robin Hood of Perth [Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, 2.377; Mill, Medieval plays, 319].\n\n71. 1503-4 Reading, Berkshire: Robin Hood gathers ten bushels of malt, one bushel of wheat, and 49s. in money. Also 4d. paid for bread and ale ‘to Robyn Hod and hys company,’ 5s. 4d. for a coat for Robin Hood, and another 16d. for meat and drink for Robin Hood and his company [Kerry, History of the Municipal Church, 227; Cox, Churchwardens Accounts, 282].\n\n72. 1503-8 William Dunbar (born 1460/65 – died before 1530) the Middle Scots poet attached to the court of James IV, includes ‘Robeine’, along with ‘Gy of Gysburne’, ‘Allane Bell’, and others, in his poem Of Sir Thomas Norray. The poem relates to Thomas Nornee or Norny, who for many years seems to have performed as one of the King’s favourite fools; in the Treasurer’s Accounts for 1505 he is called ‘Sir Thomas Nornee’. The date and place of Dunbar’s birth is not known, but he was probably a Lowland Scot whose origins were in the Lothian area of southeastern Scotland. He may have grown up in or near the town of Dunbar, which is located on the North Sea midway between Berwick-upon-Tweed and Edinburgh. Dunbar belongs to a significant group of late-medieval Scottish poets who are generally known as the Middle Scots Poets or the Scottish Makars. This group includes the author of The Kingis Quair (possibly James I of Scotland), Richard Holland, Robert Henryson, Gavin Douglas, and Sir David Lindsay. Dunbar may have received an M.A. degree from St. Andrews in 1479. It is believed that he was a Franciscan novice and travelled to England and France in the King’s service. In 1501 he was certainly in England, probably in connection with the arrangements for the marriage of James IV and Margaret Tudor, which took place in 1503. By 1504 he had been ordained as a priest. In the years 1501 to 1513, when Dunbar served in the court of James IV, there are many entries in the Treasurer’s Accounts that refer to him. Most of these entries record payments made to him such as his pensioun (his annual pay), his livery (a clothing allowance he periodically received), and other minor gifts and remuneration. Dunbar’s petition poems, such as ‘To the King [In hansill of this guid New Yeir]’ were almost certainly written between 1501 and 1510, and offer some of the best internal evidence for Dunbar’s activities during this period. These poems reflect very clearly the poet’s desire to be granted a benefice, an endowed church office that provided its holder with a secure, and sometimes substantial, annual income. The final mention of Dunbar in the historical records occurs in May of 1513. In the following September the reign of James IV came to an end at the Battle of Flodden, where the Scottish king and thousands of his fellow Scots, including many earls, bishops, and abbots, died at the hands of the English army. It is possible that Dunbar was one of those who died at Flodden Field, but most scholars hold the view that he survived into the reign of James V. After the battle he may have received the benefice for which he had so often asked in verse, however the Treasurer’s Accounts for the period from August of 1513 until June of 1515 no longer exist.\n\nOf the more than eighty poems attributed to Dunbar, most are short and occasional, written out of personal moods or events at court. They range from vulgar satire to religious hymns. Of his longer works, some are courtly Chaucerian pieces like the dream allegory The Goldyn Targe, while The Thrissill and the Rois is a nuptial song celebrating the marriage of James IV and Margaret Tudor. Manuscripts containing Of Sir Thomas Norray (not in Dunbar’s own hand) are found in The Reidpeth Manuscript (Cambridge University Library MS Ll.v.10) and The Maitland Folio (Cambridge, Pepys Library, Magdalene College MS 2553). Editions containing Of Sir Thomas Norray include: Ancient Scottish Poems Never Before in Print, 2 vols., John Pinkerton, London and Edinburgh, 1786: 2.359-61; The Poems of William Dunbar, 2 vols., David Laing, Edinburgh: Laing and Forbes, 1834; Supplement, 1865: 1.124; The Works of William Dunbar, James Paterson, Edinburgh: Stillie, 1863: 170; The Poems of William Dunbar, 5 pts, Scottish Text Society 2, 4, 16, 21, 29, John Small, Ae., James George Mackay, George Powell McNeill, and Walter Gregor, Edinburgh, 1884-93: 2.192; The Poems of William Dunbar, Henry Bellyse Baildon,Cambridge: University Press, 1907: 96-7; The Poems of William Dunbar, William Mackay MacKenzie, Edinburgh, 1932: 63-4; William Dunbar, Poems, James Kinsley, Oxford: Clarendon, 1958; re-printed 1979: 85-7; Selected Poems of Henryson and Dunbar, Priscilla J Bawcutt and Felicity Riddy, Edinburgh: 1992: 158-60; William Dunbar: The Complete Works, John Conlee, Medieval Institute Publications, Michigan, 2004.\n\n73. 1504-5 Reading, Berkshire: 18s. 11½d. received from the gathering of Robin Hood [Reference courtesy of A.

Printed by Richard Pynson in 1509, it contains three mentions of Robin Hood. Originally written by the German poet Sebastian Brant, it was first published in Basel in 1494. This work was very popular in it’s day and described as one of the most famous books ever written. A layman who held municipal positions in Strasburg from 1501, Brant’s work forms an instructive document for the intellectual and moral history of the period, giving us a satire of the follies and weaknesses of man, including the clergy. There are countless editions and numerous translations such as: A latin translation by Jacob Locher (on which Barclay’s version is primarily based) published in Basel in 1497; A French verse adaptation of Locher by Pierre Riviere also in 1497; A French prose adaptation by Jehan Drouyn of Riviere’s adaptation of Locher in 1498; Another English version by Henry Watson (at times a liberal prose translation of Jehan Drouyn’s adaptation of Riviere’s adaption of Locher) in an edition printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1509 (the same year as Barclay’s edition by Pynson); Barclay’s text of The Ship of Fools reprinted by the English printer John Cawood in 1570; Barclay’s Ship of Fools edited,with an introduction by T.

Edward Hall (1497-1547) was the son of John Hall, a successful London grocer, merchant of the staple, and warden of his company in 1512-13. Edward Hall was educated at Eton and at King’s College, Cambridge, where he obtained his BA in 1518. At about the time of his graduation from university, the second son of Robert Fabyan (see no. 67 above) became apprentice to Hall’s father. It is possible that through this connection Hall developed his lifelong interest in chronicling the events of English history. He entered Gray’s Inn (his name appears as a student there in 1521) and became a lawyer. Hall became common sergeant of London in 1533 and undersheriff in 1535. He was also a member of Parliament for Wenlock (1529) and Bridgnorth (1542) in Shropshire, and a friend of Thomas Cromwell. However Hall was hostile towards Wolsey, especially to the cardinal’s financial demands upon the city, which turned him into a critic of the Church. Hall’s chronicle is also an important source for the reign of Henry VIII, especially the beginning of the break with Rome in the early 1530s, which Hall witnessed as a member of Parliament. He also recorded ceremonial events such a processions, tournaments, and lavish occasions like the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. Hall made his will during the year 1546-47 and was buried in the church of St. Benet Sherhog. See Peter C. Herman, Edward Hall: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004-2014); The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558, ed. S.T.

Wagner and Susan Walters Schmid, California, 2012. In 1940 an antiquarian bookseller named Alan Keen was examining a recent purchase of old books from a library, when he stumbled upon a copy of Hall’s Chronicle. The explanatory notes in some of the margins were believed by Keen to be the work of William Shakespeare. Keen published his findings in two journal articles and a book with co-author Alan Lubbock (The Annotator; The Pursuit of an Elizabethan Reader of Halle’s Chronicle Involving Some Surmises about the Early Life of William Shakespeare, London, 1954). Keen’s discovery is now in the British Library (Loan MS 61).\n\n96. 1510-11 Poole, Dorset: Robin Hood’s money in the town box. [References courtesy of R. C. Hays and C. E.

The only other surviving text is in the Bannatyne Manuscript of c. 1565-68; Ane Littill Interlud of the Droichis Part of the Play, in which all references to Robin Hood and Maying have been left out, probably due to the fact that Robin Hood games, along with all misrule, had been banned in Scotland since the Parliamentary act of 1555 see no. 222 below). The Asloan Manuscript on ff. 240r – 242vis in The National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh, MS 16500, and the later Bannatyne Manuscript on ff. 118v – 120r is in the NLS, Advocates’ MS 1.1.6. Internal evidence has suggested that this anonymous comic monologue was originally composed between 1512 and 1515; the dwarf ‘Wealth’ calls upon Edinburgh’s citizens to assemble in their ‘greenwood’ livery, equipped with bows and arrows, to parade alongside Robin Hood, in honour of the burgh. This seems to refer to a similar occasion in Aberdeen in 1508 (see no. 83 above). The Asloan version of the ‘play’ was printed in Select Remains of the Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland, ed., David Laing (Edinburgh, 1822, reprinted in Edinburgh in 1884, with new editions in 2014 and 2015). Both the Asloan and Bannatyne versions are printed in Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England, Vol. 12, (Keely Fisher, 1999). There is a fascimile edition of the Bannatyne Manuscript (D. Fox and W. A. Ringler (eds.), The Bannatyne Manuscript-NLS Advocates’ MS 1.1.6 (1980); but there is no facsimile of the Asloan Manuscript yet available. There are transcriptions of both manuscripts in print: W.

This is a faithful reprint of the first edition of 1768-70, from the press of John Nichols – the ‘Northumberland Household Book’ edited and annotated by Bishop Thomas Percy* – there is a copy in the British Library. Percy had used the manuscript that was in the possession of the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland – it is now in the Lambeth Palace Library (MS 1146). There was a second edition in 1827, which is a reprint of the first, issued by William Pickering.

Barclay’s first three Eclogues were largely borrowed from the ‘Miseriae Curialium’ of Pope Pius II, and the last two, a free rendering of the Eclogues of Baptista Mantuanus or Mantuan (1447-1516) an Italian Carmelite reformer, humanist, and poet. Barclay’s Eclogues form, with the exception of Henryson’s Robin and Makyn, the earliest examples of the English pastoral. First published in collected form by the English printer John Cawood in 1570, the Eclogues were appended to his edition of The Ship of Fools.\n\n106. 1514-15 Kingston-upon Thames, Surry: 12s. received for Robin Hood’s gathering; another 9s. 4d. received for his gathering at Croydon [Finny, ‘Mediaeval Games,’ 121].\n\n107. 1515 On his way to Greenwich, Henry VIII and the Queen, and many lords and ladies, are met by two hundred yeomen on Shooter’s Hill, with one calling himself Robin Hood, the second royal Robin Hood activity recorded by Edward Hall in The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke (see no. 95 above and no. 200 below).

He wrote the first secular morality play in English, Magnyfycence (his only surviving play), a political satire, in which the character named ‘Fancy’ mentions Friar Tuck (line 373). (See also no. 127 below). Skelton had an illustrious career: He was educated at the University of Cambridge and achieved the status of ‘poet laureate’. Another skill was his translation of ancient Greek and Roman authors, which led to his appointment as court poet to Henry VII in 1488, later as an addition, he became a tutor to the Duke of York (later Henry VIII). When Henry became heir to the throne, Skelton became rector of Diss, in Norfolk, although he lived in London from 1512, where the King granted him the title of orator regius. In this position Skelton became an adviser to the King, in court poems, on public issues, and on church affairs. Little of Skelton’s early work is known, but his reputation was such that in 1499 while visiting England, Desiderius Erasmus, the great figure of the Dutch Renaissance, referred to him as ‘the incomparable light and glory of English letters.’ Not all were as flattering, Skelton had a later reputation as a ‘beastly’ poet. His many works include poems such as Bowge of courte, Phyllyp Sparowe, and Ware the Hawke, and court poems such as A ballad of the Scottysshe Kynge. His three major political and clerical satires were Speke Parrot (written 1521), Collyn Clout (1522), and Why come ye nat to courte (1522). Skelton’s reputation declined in a 16th-century protestant England, and his fame as an English poet of major importance was only restored in the 20th century. His individual poetic style of short rhyming lines, based on natural speech rhythms, has been given the name of Skeltonics. Magnyfycence appears to have been printed by John Rastell in about 1530 (see also John Skelton: The Critical Heritage, Anthony Edwards, Routledge, 1981; John Skelton and the Politics of the 1520s, Greg Walker, Cambridge University Press, 2002).\n\n112. 1516-17 Yeovil, Somerset: St John Baptist churchwardens accounts include 20s. presented ‘by Robarte Hood and by the devotion of the pepylle’ [REED: Somerset, 405].\n\n113. 1517 Aberdeen, North Sea Coast: Certain disobedient residents who have refused to process with Robin Hood and Little John are reproved and warned to obey the proclamation ‘and pas with þe saidez Robert and Iohn all þe sondais of may and vther tymes quhen þai be warnit’ [Mill, Medieval Plays, 140].\n\n114. 1517-18 Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey: 6s. 6d. received for Robin Hood’s gathering [Finny, ‘Mediaeval Games,’ 121].\n\n115. 1518 Edinburgh, Lothian: City records relate that the Abbot of Narent is now ‘callit Robin Huid and Little Jhone’ [J.

M. Briers, ‘Henley Borough Records,’ 189].\n\n121. c. 1520 Transactions in the day-book of John Dorne, an Oxford bookseller, include a book of carols, or ballads such as ‘Undo your dore’, or ‘Robin Hood’ [English Books and Readers 1475 to 1557 (second edition) H. S. Bennett, Cambridge University Press, 1969;F. Madan, ‘The Day-book of John Dorne’, Oxford Historical Society, Collectanea, vol. 1 (1885), pp. 71-178].\n\n122. c.1520 John Rastell (c.1475–1536) the son of a leading Coventry citizen and Warwickshire justice of the peace, is credited with writing and publishing The Interlude of the Four Elements, a morality play intended to awaken interest in natural science and discovery. It includes a three-part song with music, the first printed musical score in English. Interlude has a mention of a Robin Hood song by the character ‘Ignorance’ that begins with the well known phrase ‘Robyn Hode in Barnysdale stode’ (see no. 13 above). Rastell is credited with another play Of Gentylnes and Nobylyte and probably Calisto and Melibea as well. Other works include The Pastyme of People (1529) a chronicle dealing with English history, and A New Boke of Purgatory (1530). An innovative printer, barrister, playwright, author, member of Parliament, and brother-in-law of Thomas More, he also entered into the service of Sir Edward Belknap in London, where he was charged with the preparation of state occasions and the entertainment of the King, his guests, and the court. Rastell published several of More’s works, including A Dialogue Concerning Heresies, in 1529. After his conversion to Protestantism in 1530-31, Rastell began printing Protestant tracts; in a letter to Thomas Cromwell, probably written in 1536, he says that he had spent his time in upholding the king’s cause and opposing the pope, with the result that he had lost both his printing business and his legal practice, and was reduced to poverty. He was sent to prison in 1536, where he probably died. His son William Rastell, also a lawyer, took over his father’s printing business in 1530, publishing plays and interludes as well as many works by his uncle Thomas More (see no. 145 and 153 below). There are several editions of Interlude such as: Dodsley (1874-6), Fischer (1903), Farmer (1906), Coleman (1971), and Axton (1979). Printed versions include: William Middleton (c. 1544), William Copland (c. 1560), and John Allde (1569). (see also, Das ‘Interlude of the Four Elements,’ mit einer Einleitung, ed. Julius Fischer, Marburg: N. G. Elwert, 1903; Interlude of the four Elements in Siberch Celebrations, 1521-1971, ed. Brooke Crutchley, Cambridge, 1971, pp. 81-113).\n\n123. 1520-21 Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey: 8s. received for Robin Hood’s gathering at Whitsun [Finny, ‘Mediaeval Games,’ 104].\n\n124. 1521 Dundee, North Sea Coast: The provost and baillies authorize a grant of 5 marks or a citizenship to Robin Hood for building archery butts [Mill, Medieval Plays, 173].\n\n125. 1521 John Mair or Major (1467-1550) philosopher, theologian, and historian, was the third in line to the Scottish chroniclers Andrew of Wyntoun and Walter Bower (see nos. 9 and 17 above). He attended grammar school in the Scottish town of Haddington , and later went to Cambridge, and then to Paris, where he was a professor of theology. Major returned to Scotland in about 1518, but he had apparently already finished his latin work Historia Majoris Britanniae (published in Paris in 1521), which was translated as History of Greater Britain, as well England and Scotland, in 1892. Another of Major’s works, In tertivm Sententiarum disputations Theologicae Joannis Maioris denuo recognitae et repurgatae, mentions ‘Roberto Hudo’. Like his predecessors Major believed that Robin and John were real people, and he places them in the 1190s, the time of Richard I and Prince John. He does not give any evidence for his claims, but his dating was accepted by later antiquarians such as John Stow and Richard Grafton. It is likely that Major also influenced the author of the Sloane ‘life’ of Robin Hood (see no. 397 below). Some of his other publications include De Gestis Scotorum (Paris, 1521), Quaestiones logicales (Paris, 1528), and Commentary on the Four Gospels (Paris, 1528).

This was republished at Paris in 1575 with an appendix by the Italian Humanist Giovanni Ferrerio, and reproduced with the addition of a modern translation into English by Dana F. Sutton. Boece’s edition contained seventeen books, and Giovanni Ferrerio’s publication included the eighteenth book and a fragment of the nineteenth. Boece’s Historiae was translated into Scots prose by John Bellenden as commissioned by James V, who also commissioned William Stewart to translate the Historiae into Scots verse (see no. 170 below). ‘Continuations’ of Boece’s Historiae include De origine, moribus, et rebus gestis Scotorum libri decem (1578) by John Leslie, and The Historie and Chronicles of Scotland by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, the first history of Scotland to be composed in Scots, completed by 1579. An English translation of Boece’s Historiae appeared in Raphael Holinshed’s chronicle (see no. 308 below).\n\nA Scottish philosopher and historian, Boece was born at Dundee and educated at the relatively new University of St Andrews. Like many of his contemporaries, he proceeded to the University of Paris where he met Erasmus, with whom he became close friends. Boece went on to become secretary to the Master of the Collège de Montaigu, Jan Standonck. In 1497 he was appointed to the post of professor of philosophy at the University. In 1500 Boece accepted a very generous financial offer from William Elphinstone, the Bishop of Aberdeen, made on behalf of James IV, to leave Paris and become the first principal of King’s College, later the University of Aberdeen. As well as acting as principal Boece gave lectures on medicine and divinity. He also established himself as a historian, and in 1522 he published Vitae Episcoporum Murthlacensium et Aberdonensium, or ‘Lives of the Bishops of Murthlack and Aberdeen’. His more ambitious Scotorum Historiae dedicated to James V, charts the history of Scotland from its origins right through to the accession of James III. Boece received a small pension from the Scottish court (1527–34) and was a canon of Aberdeen, vicar of Tullynessle, and then rector of Fyvie in Aberdeenshire in 1534. He died in Aberdeen two years later at the age of 71. Boece’s Historiae was well received and became very popular, especially in Europe after its translation from Latin into French, and in Scotland after its translation into Scots. Boece’s approach to history was partisan and inaccurate in many respects. He tended to uncritically blend historical fact with myth and folklore, and he also tended to write with an eye to ensuring he stayed in good favour with James V.\n\nBoece’s Historiae began to attract critics, most notable was the English antiquary John Leland (see no. 156 below). In 1572 the Welsh antiquary Humphrey Lhuyd published Commentariolo Descriptionis Britannicae Fragmentum, which further challenged Boece’s reputation as an historian. Boece’s account of Macbeth of Scotland flattered the ancestors of James IV, and maligned the real Macbeth. It was Boece’s version that Raphael Holinshed incorporated it into his Chronicle (see no. 308 below), which formed the basis of Shakespeare’s famous play Macbeth. The sources for Boece’s Historiae seem to include John of Fordun, Walter Bower (see no. 17 above), Turgot, a Bishop of St. Andrews, and John Campbell. There is also the mysterious ‘Veremund,’ possibly Richard Vairement, a Culdee of St. Andrews of the thirteenth century. A 1527 edition of Boece’s Historiae is in the British Library, which also contains the 1575 edition published by Giovanni Ferrerio. A 1527 edition was auctioned at Christie’s in 2002, and William Drummond of Hawthorden (1585-1649) owned a copy of whose whereabouts (or survival) is not known.

Wolfgang J. Mommsen, Publications of the German Historical Institute London 5 (Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1979), 112].\n\n141. 1528 William Tyndale also known as William Hychyns (c. 1494-1536) was a scholar and theologian, who condemns tales of Robin Hood in his book The Obedience of a Christian Man. This book is believed to have greatly influenced Henry VIII’s decision in declaring the Act of Supremacy, by which he became Supreme Head of the Church of England.It was originally published by the printer Merten de Keyser in Antwerp (1528); a facsimile was published in 1977 as number 897, ‘The English Experience’ by Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, Ltd., Keizersgracht 526, Amsterdam, and Walter J. Johnson, Inc., 355 Chestnut Street, Norwood, New Jersey; there was another printed edition of Obedience in 1535, and by W. Hill in 1548 (see also, The Obedience of a Christian Man, Volume 5 of Christian classics series, ed. Richard Lovett, Religious Tract Society, 1900; The Obedience of a Christian Man, ed. David Daniell, Penguin Books, 2000).\n\nTyndale was born in Gloucestershire and educated at Oxford and Cambridge where he became a strong supporter of church reform. He was ordained as a priest in around 1521 and returned to Gloucestershire to serve as a chaplain to a member of the local gentry. In 1523, Tyndale moved to London with the intention of translating the New Testament into English, an act that was strictly forbidden by the established Catholic Church, as these sorts of ideas were closely associated with Martin Luther and other controversial Protestant religious reformers. In 1524 Tyndale left England for Germany to continue his translation work in greater safety, and sought the help of Martin Luther at Wittenberg. Tyndale’s translation of the New Testament was the first ever to be written and printed in English, and a model for subsequent English translations of the bible. His English New Testament was printed in Cologne in 1525, however th"
