        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIrish orphan girl Mary is sent to stay with Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss in Cornwall. Joss is the landlord of Jamaica Inn and also the head of a gang of pirates who lure ships to their doom on the rocky coast. Mary soon finds herself in trouble when she discovers the truth.

It's uncertain if Rohauer made any further alterations to the film, but this is often print used on official DVD releases of the film. Many of the America bootleg DVD releases of the film are missing around 8 minutes of footage which seriously impacts on the film's continuity.\n\nIn January 2013, the Cohen Media Group acquired the Rohauer Library of films and subsequently partnered with the British Film Institute to undertake a full 4K digital restoration of the film, based on the BFI's original nitrate negatives of the film.[1] The new print was premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 22 May 2014.[2]\n\nSee Also...\n\nFor further relevant information about this film, see also...\n\n1000 Frames of Jamaica Inn (1939)\n\narticles about Jamaica Inn (1939)\n\ncomplete cast and crew\n\nradio adaptations\n\ntrivia\n\nweb links to information, articles, reviews, etc\n\nTechnical Information\n\nblack & white\n\nsound mix: mono (RCA Photophone System)\n\naspect ratio: 1.37:1 Spherical\n\nrunning time: 108 minutes\n\nproduction studio: Mayflower Pictures\n\nalso known as:\n\nLa Taverne de la Jamaïque (1939) - France\n\nReleases\n\nBlu-ray\n\nJamaica Inn (1939) - Cohen Media Group (Blu-ray, USA, 2015)91156\n\n▶ Amazon (USA)\n\nDVD\n\nJamaica Inn (1939) - Network (UK, 2008) - part of a box set\n\nPAL 1.33:1 Riffpiraten (1939) - AmCo Tonträger (Germany, 2007)\n\nPAL 1.33:1 La Taverne de la Jamaique (1939) - Universal (France, 2006)\n\nAmazon (France)\n\nR2 PAL 1.33:1 Jamaica Inn (1939) - Waterfall Home Entertainment Ltd (UK, 2006)\n\n1.33:1\n\nWarning!
