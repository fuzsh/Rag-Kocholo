        "text": "Joss is, in the words of Sarah Dubant, \"near to caricature ... His brooding figure, craggy looks and wild temper are in their own way all attributes of the romantic hero inverted into violence and self-loathing – a Mr Rochester without a Jane to redeem him\" (though I felt him closer to Heathcliff). At first Joss seems to be a stereotype but Du Maurier works to make him three-dimensional. One of our U3A members said that she found one of the most sinister moments in the book to be when Joss cuts and butters a slice of bread for Mary: “He proceeded to cut carefully a thin slice from the loaf, which he quartered in pieces and buttered for her, the whole business very delicately done and in striking contrast to his manner in serving himself – so much so that to Mary there was something almost horrifying in the change from rough brutality to fastidious care. It was as though there was some latent power in his fingers which turned them from bludgeons into deft and cunning servants. Had he cut her a chunk of bread and hurled it at her she would not have minded so much\" (Ch 2).\n\nThis dual personality is typical of Joss. For example, he is sexually threatening (there is always a subtext of sex with Joss) but he reassures Mary: \"I’ve better things to do than to play cat’s-cradle with me own niece.\" (C 2) On the other hand, when he is under the influence of alcohol, he threatens her with violence: “I’m master in this house, and I’ll have you know it. You’ll do as you’re told, and help in the house and serve my customers, and I’ll not lay a finger on you. But, by God, if you open your mouth and squark, I’ll break you until you eat out of my hand the same as your aunt yonder.”\n\nMary recognises that there are two versions of Joss:\n\n\"There was still something fine about his great dark eyes, in spite of the lines and pouches and the red blood-flecks.\" (C 2)\n\n\"Though there should be a world of difference between the smile of a man and the bared fangs of a wolf, with Joss Merlyn they were one and the same.\" (C 2)\n\nThe ‘two sides of the coin’ is seen in his attitude to alcohol: on the one hand he sees it will be his downfall but on the other it makes him feel powerful: “There’s been one weakness in my life, and I’ll tell you what it is ... ‘It’s drink. It’s a curse, and I know it. I can’t stop myself. One day it’ll be the end of me, and a good job too. There’s days go by and I don’t touch more than a drop, same as I’ve done tonight. And then I’ll feel the thirst come on me and I’ll soak. Soak for hours. It’s power, and glory, and women, and the Kingdom of God, all rolled into one. I feel a king then, Mary. I feel I’ve got the strings of the world between my two fingers.”\n\nJoss is given a back story which he tells Mary (he is given to somewhat self-pitying monologues when drunk; he is a typical maudlin drunk). His father was hanged for killing another man in a fight, his grandfather was transported for thieving, his elder brother was found drowned in a Marsh.\n\nHe also blabs secrets when he is drunk. It is during another binge that he tells Mary that he is the leader of a gang of wreckers and has killed multiple times, including women and children, rather than saving them from drowning.\n\nIt is suggested in the Introduction to the Virago edition that Joss is based in part on the author’s father, an actor who was a sometimes violent alcoholic, and in part upon her husband who suffered ‘shell-shock’ (PTSD) cause by his times in the trenches during the First World War and had nightmarish dreams.\n\nJem is the romantic hero with a Byronic twist, the bad boy that the good girl falls in love with. \"He lacked tenderness; he was rude; and he had more than a streak of cruelty in him; he was a thief and a liar. He stood for everything she feared and hated and despised; but she knew she could love him.\" (C 9)\n\nThe key scene is when Jem takes Mary to Launceston for a picnic and to sell a stolen horse at the market. The picnic involves a hugely symbolic moment: \"You can eat the apple, if you’re feeling religious. There’s an apple comes in the Bible, I know that much.\" (C 9) This is the moment when Mary as Eve (I suspect that the choice of the name ‘Mary’ reflects the idea that in Christianity Mary is a sort of second Eve) falls ... and the tempter is the man, Jem as Adam. With Jem, Mary is portrayed as fundamentally morally flawed: she takes pleasure in Jem’s cleverness as he sells the stolen horse back to its original owners (a horse that she is later offered as a gift for herself!)\n\nMary is also weak. She knows the parallels between the way Aunt Patience married Joss for love (and it destroyed her) and how marrying Jem is likely to destroy Mary: “He was too like his brother. His eyes, and his mouth, and his smile. That was the danger of it. She could see her uncle in his walk, in the turn of his head; and she knew why Aunt Patience had made a fool of herself ten years ago. It would be easy enough to fall in love with Jem Merlyn.\" She even tells Jem that she likes his hands because “they are like your brother’s”; but the hands of Joss are the hands she has seen delicately cutting bread and the hands that Mary has imagined killed innocent women and children in the service of the wreckers. Nevertheless (and this is reprise of the ‘two sides of the coin’ theme, she can’t resist Jem: “whether it was his hands or his skin or his smile she did not know, but something inside her responded to him, and the very thought of him was an irritant and a stimulant at the same time.\" (C 9).\n\nMy U3A group agreed that Du Maurier excels at describing the setting of the book. One of them pointed out that the story is anchored in ‘geographical reality’; all of the locations is authentic. This gives what might otherwise be a far-fetched Gothic story verisimilitude.\n\nBut the physical landscape is considerably more than just a backdrop. It is a metaphor for the psychological landscape. Having come from a placid farming life, where animals are domesticated and even time is organised into a seasonal calendar, Mary (a passive onlooker of the world) enters a realm of bleak, wild and desolate scenery and wild weather to match the feral behaviour of the law-breaking, violent and dangerous men. This is a hugely romantic, Byronic notion: that wilderness and danger can be attractive and Mary falls in love with the land and the people.\n\nIn many ways the book is one long pathetic fallacy. It starts by describing the weather: “a cold grey day ... a backing wind ... a granite sky ...a mizzling rain [though very soon “driving rain”] ... clammy cold” (Ch 1) This is swiftly contrasted with “the shining waters of Helford” at the start of Mary’s journey, “the green hills and the sloping valleys, the white cluster of cottages at the water’s edge. It was a gentle rain that fell at Helford, a rain that pattered in the many trees and lost itself in the lush grass\" and “sank into the grateful soil which gave back flowers in payment.” This is, in the very next paragraph, contrasted with the moor “a country of stones, black heather, and stunted broom”. [Blackness is recurring a motif.] But farming life, even in idyllic Helford, is hard and Mary’s mother’s dying words are to instruct her to go to Aunt Patience because “A girl can’t live alone, Mary, without she goes queer in the head, or comes to evil. It’s either one or the other.\" (C 1)\n\nEven when the landscape can seem innocent and even pretty, the ground can be treacherous. The brother of Joss and Jem was drowned in a bog and the metaphor of the marsh corresponds to the character of the Vicar: he takes Mary in and when she is helpless he threatens to kill her.\n\nThe landscape affects its inhabitants. Mary’s first view of Bodmin Moor makes her reflect “No human being could live in this wasted country, thought Mary, and remain like other people; the very children would be born twisted\" (C 1) The extended pathetic fallacy of the book means that the character of Joss is a reflection of his setting. And the landscape and the people swap places, at least in Mary’s imagination. In the final, desperate chase with Frances Davey, Mary “could see the stones turning to men beside her. Their faces were inhuman, older than time, carved and rugged like the granite; and they spoke in a tongue she could not understand, and their hands and feet were curved like the claws of a bird.\" (C 17)\n\nOther setting-oriented quotes:\n\n\"Here on the summit the wind fretted and wept, whispering of fear, sobbing old memories of bloodshed and despair\" (C 17)\n\n\"The sun had already disappeared behind the furthest hill ... before many hours had passed the grey malevolence of a November dusk would have fallen.\" (C 4)\n\n\"Colour came in patches; sometimes the hills were purple, ink-stained, and mottled, and then a feeble ray of sun would come from a wisp of cloud, and one hill would be golden-brown while his neighbour still languished in the dark.\" (C 3)\n\n\"The mist parted and dissolved. It rose from the ground in a twisting column of smoke\" (C 17)\n\n\"The texture of the ground was crisp, and the short grass crunched beneath the foot like shingle.\" (C 18)"
