But May chose instead to honor her mother's dying request that she join her frightened Aunt Patience and foreboding Uncle Joss Merlyn at Jamaica Inn. From her first glimpse on that raw November eve, she could sense the inn's dark power. Mary never imagined that she would become hopelessly ensnared in the vile, villainous schemes being hatched within its crumbling walls or that she would fall in love with a handsome, enigmatic stranger. But what secrets is he hiding from her and can she really trust him?",
