        "text": "Summary of Jamaica Inn\n\nThe story follows Mary Yellan as she moves from a farm in Helford to the isolated Jamaica Inn at the crossroads between Bodmin and Launceston. It had been her mother's dying wish for her to stay there, with her aunt and uncle.\n\nWhen Mary arrives at Jamaica Inn she finds her uncle is an abusive, bullying man. She becomes aware that something sinister is going on at the Inn. Intelligent and inquisitive, Mary Yellan eventually uncovers the mystery of the place. Her uncle had warned her not to ask questions and to stay in bed when carriages arrive at night. Instead, she peeps out of the window and watches goods being unloaded, brought into the house and stored in a barred room. She realises that this was a smuggling operation.\n\nMary sneaks down and eavesdrops on a conversation between her uncle and another man, who refuses to participate in what he describes as 'common murder'. She hears her uncle threaten him, describing how he had hanged another man who had refused to participate. At this point Mary faints.\n\nMary decides to stay to persuade her aunt to leave. In the meantime she helps around the house and works as a barmaid on busy evenings. Lonely and isolated, she becomes friends with the landlord's little brother, a charming horse-thief called Jem, who advises her to leave.\n\nThe local magistrate, Squire Bassat, arrives with a warrant to search the property but finds nothing. Certain that Joss Merlyn is involved in a smuggling operation, Squire Bassat is determined to find the evidence needed to convict him. He questions Mary, but for her aunt's sake she gives nothing away.\n\nWhile out riding, she gets lost on the moors and is rescued by Francis Davey, the vicar of Altarnun (an albino). Feeling at ease in his company, she confides in him about her life at Jamaica Inn, including the night she heard her uncle say he hanged someone. He calms her down and suggests that she has let her imagination run away with her. He also encourages her to confide in him in the future, before taking her home.\n\nMary's uncle confides in her while drunk. He tells her terrifying stories of his conduct as a wrecker, brutally murdering surviving passengers, including a mother and her child.\n\nA few days later she goes to the Launceton fair with Jem. She recognizes her growing attraction to him, but wary of ending up like her aunt and skeptical of romance, is determined not to act upon it.They kiss, but Mary refuses to spend the night with him. He disappears and she is once again rescued by the vicar.\n\nMary once again confides in the vicar, telling him her uncle is a wrecker. He reassures her that after the New Year there will be no more wrecking as a band of watchers will be employed to prevent it. On her way back to Jamaica Inn her carriage is stopped by her uncle and his band of wreckers. They forcefully take her with them, for what they are aware might be the last time they can wreck a ship.\n\nShe escapes from the carriage and is caught by Harry the peddler who tries to rape her. Mary fights him off and gets away. She watches the wrecking in horror. She is then recaptured and brought back to Jamaica Inn. When she recovers she is confronted by her uncle in a frenzy, terrified of discovery and planning to escape.\n\nMary is a step behind at every turn. She goes to the vicar's house to tell him everything, but he is away, so she leaves him a note. When she arrives at North Hill, the Squire has gone to apprehend Joss. His wife provides her with a groom and carriage. Mary arrives before Squire Bassat and discovers her uncle has been stabbed to death. The Squire arrives and finds the body of her aunt. He also finds Harry locked in the barred room.\n\nThe vicar arrives and offers Mary shelter. Over lunch the vicar tells her how it was Jem Merlyn who had informed on his brother after the Christmas Eve wreck.\n\nIn a further unexpected twist, the vicar reveals himself to be the true leader and mastermind of Joss's band of wreckers. His position as a clergyman put him above suspicion, but he reveals that he isn't truly a Christian. He practices paganism. He further reveals that he murdered her aunt and uncle, before abducting her and trying to flee with her across the moors."
