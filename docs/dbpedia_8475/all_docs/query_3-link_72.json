Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, author of Rebecca and The Birds. “Laughton asked me to show him only in close shots, because he hadn’t yet figured out the manner of his walk. Ten days later he came and said, ‘I’ve found it.’ [It] was inspired by the beat of a little German waltz, and he whistled it for us as he waddled about the room.” – Hitchcock. “Several sharp and entertaining images remain vivid in our memories; the heroine taking down a hanged man, a pirate whistling a mazurka as he wipes his bloody cutlass on his shirt, the cariole rolling through the brush... The bizarre protagonist [is] admirably played by the innately and inventively prodigious Charles Laughton in a role actors dream about.” – Eric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol. Approx. 99 min. DCP.\n\nRestored by Cohen Media Group/Cohen Film Collection, in collaboration with the BFI.",
