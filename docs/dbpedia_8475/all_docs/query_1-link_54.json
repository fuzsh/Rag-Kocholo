        "text": "A few weeks ago I visited Cornwall for the wedding of one of my partner’s friends. I’ve only been once before but it definitely ranks as one of England’s most notable counties with many places of great natural beauty. As you can tell I’m already finding it hard not to lapse into tourist information-style clichés, but as a city dweller I’m always grateful to get away to wide open spaces and places where the pace of life is slower, not to mention wonderful scenery and friendlier people 😉 The wedding we attended took place on a Tor overlooking Bodmin Moor, which really did fulfil all of the “breath-taking views” criteria and we also met many genuinely lovely people (not least a very kindly hotel manager who didn’t mind being woken up in the middle of the night to help us get a cab home when we got stranded – taxi companies there don’t operate with quite the same consistency as London). Cornwall also has an air of mysticism about it that’s hard to define and a long and genuine history; whilst there I glimpsed more than one disused tin mine chimney off in the distance and I was half-wondering if Poldark was going to spring up somewhere (I distinctly remember my Mum being hooked on the TV drama when I was a youngster).\n\nAnyway all of this nature and history stuff must have inspired me – when I got home I promptly decided to take out Jamaica Inn from my local library, a novel I’d heard a fair bit about but never actually read. Quick lowdown on Daphne Du Maurier for anyone in the dark: she’s one of the best known English writers from the 20th Century and has penned many other acclaimed and highly successful fictional works such as Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel and short stories like The Birds and Don’t Look Now – all of which have been adapted for TV and/or the big screen (the latter short stories rank as two of my all-time favourite horror movies). Stylistically and thematically, Du Maurier’s novels contain many aspects typical of the thriller and mystery genres, yet very often delve considerably deeper than that, with strong elements of the otherworldly or supernatural featuring as part of their narratives. Take The Birds for example – the idea that a seemingly normal aspect of our environment that we take for granted, bird life, can suddenly turn abnormal and hostile, putting mankind in grave and mortal danger. Unnerving to say the least. The movie version moved the action to California, USA, but the original novel takes place in a English/Cornish setting – appropriate as Du Maurier lived the majority of her life in Cornwall and this was also the location for several of her tales.\n\nJamaica Inn takes its name from a real-life traveller’s inn on Bodmin Moor that was built as a coaching inn in 1750 and had strong associations with smuggling, an ideology that Du Maurier capitalises on in her novel. The book tells the story of 23-year-old Mary Yellan, who has to leave her home in Helford to go and live with her Aunt Patience after her mother dies. She meets Patience’s husband and keeper of Jamaica Inn, Joss Merlyn, a dominating figure both physically and mentally. On arriving at the gloomy and threatening Inn, Mary finds her formerly vibrant and energetic Aunt has undergone a marked personality change and is now very much under the thumb of her surly and vicious husband. Mary soon realises that something unusual is afoot at the Inn, which has no guests and is never open to the public and in the middle of the night she is woken by groups of men arriving in waggons. Mary also encounters Joss’ younger brother Jem, a petty thief but less brutal than his big brother and against her better judgement she becomes attracted to him. She soon realises that Joss is the leader of a band of wreckers and even overhears Joss ordering the murder of one of their members, She then turns to Francis Davey, the albino vicar of the neighbouring village of Altarnun, who happened to find Mary when she got lost one day on the moor…\n\nThere’s more of course, but I’ll now move on to my thoughts on the novel. There will be some SPOILERS from this point on, my hearties…\n\nFirstly, it’s interesting that the novel was written in 1936. Although there are no precise references to dates, the story obviously harks back to an older period of English history (characters travel by horse and carriage etc) appealing to readers who enjoy romantic/historical fiction and has many ideas and motifs which are redolent of the gothic genre also – several descriptions of dark and gloomy settings, the dark and desolate moors, the atmosphere of menace at the Inn, and so forth.\n\nBefore giving my overall judgement of the text, I’d like to discuss the characters. Central protagonist Mary Yellen is a likeable heroine and the reader often find themself rooting for her. Going to live at Jamaica Inn makes for a pretty grim and depressing existence for Mary (isolated from any real community; forced to endure with her bullying Uncle and passive Aunt day in, day out; no real job prospects) yet – forgive the clichés – she shows a pluck and independence of spirit that reminded me a bit of Jane Eyre. Mary’s inquisitive and curious nature also serves as a device to drive the plot on, for instance when she shows a steely determination to get to the bottom of the smuggling issue. Some examples being:\n\n“Had she been a man she would have gone downstairs and challenged Joss Merlyn to his face, and his friends with him. Yes, and fought them too, and drawn blood, if she were lucky. And then away on a horse from the stable, with Aunt Patience riding pillion, and so down to the south again ….”\n\n“Then Mary swore; a thing she had only done once before in her life, when chased by a bull at Manaccan, and then it had been for the same purpose as now – to give herself courage and a certain bold pretence.”\n\nNote the way in which Mary feels she has to emulate a man to get respect and there is the sense of her “putting on a front” – realities for a woman in a predominantly patriarchal society.\n\nWithout going into too much detail, Mary does get a happy ending but not before facing some considerable trials…\n\nMary’s Aunt Patience remains a very passive player in the novel from start to finish and as a character is a bit of a cipher. There are several points when you really want her to bounce back and do more. However this is probably deliberate on the part of the author – she’s there as a type of counterpoint to the active Mary. I was a bit disappointed that she just kind of “sunk into the background”, however.\n\nAs you will have gathered, Joss Merlyn is the villain of the piece with few redeeming features – a bully, lout, criminal and a major drunkard to boot. Mary reflects on Joss and his brother: “What a vile breed they were, these Merlyns, with their studied insolence and coarseness, their rough brutality of manner…” We discover Joss’ true colours in one major scene when, under the influence of drink, he tells her how he has come by his money and what being a “wrecker” involves (long passage here but worth reading to get an insight in Joss’ mindset and what he does!!):\n\n“Before I came here I was at Padstow, working from the shore. We ran a lugger once a fortnight with the spring tides. There were five of us in it, besides myself. But there’s no money working in a small way; you’ve got to do it big, and you’ve got to take your orders (…) By God, I’ve seen blood in my time, Mary, and I’ve seen men killed a score of times, but this game beats all of it – it’s running side by side with death. (…) Damn it, Mary, I’ve killed men with my own hands, trampled them under water, beaten them with rocks and stones; and I’ve never thought no more about it; I’ve slept in my bed like a child. But when I’m drunk I see them in my dreams; I see their white-green faces staring at me, with their eyes eaten by fish; and some of them are torn, with the flesh hanging on their bones in ribbons, and some of them have seaweed in their hair … There was a woman once, Mary; she was clinging to a raft, and she had a child in her arms (…) The ship was close in on the rocks, you see, and the sea was as flat as your hand; they were all coming in alive, the whole bunch of ‘em. Why, the water in places didn’t come above your waist. She cried out to me to help her, Mary, and I smashed her face in with a stone; she fell back, her hands beating the raft. She let go of the child and I hit her again; I watched them drown in four feet of water. We were scared then; we were afraid some of them would reach the shore (…) We had to pelt at ‘em with stones, Mary; we had to break their arms and legs (…)”\n\nGruesome, eh. Notice the way that Joss keeps referring to Mary in person, almost as though he is trying to gain her understanding and sympathy and he feels that this is a story worthy of her attention. And does Joss get his comeuppance? Read the book and find out…!\n\nThen there’s Jem Merlyn. As mentioned before, he’s a more sympathetic version of Joss and in some ways I’d liken him to Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights – a good-looking anti-hero with a history of thiefing – in one part of the novel he takes Mary to Launceston, where he cons a couple into buying a stolen horse. Mary reflects on Jem: “ (he) had the same streak of cruelty in as his brother, she could see it in the shape of his mouth. Aunt Patience had said he was the worst of his family. Although he was a head and shoulders smaller than Joss, and half the breadth, there was a certain strength about him that the elder brother did not possess. He looked hard, and keen.” As said earlier, in spite of her knowledge of Jem’s shortcomings, Mary still finds herself drawn to him, a classic feature of old-fashioned romantic fiction (such as Mills and Boon) and an aspect I personally found rather grating. Mind, there are probably a fair number of readers who like that kind of thing. It’s also gratifying to see that Mary isn’t portrayed as the type of female who submits readily or willingly to his masculine power; she maintains her independence and often challenges and stands up to Jem: “Mary shook her head at him and sighed, ‘Have you ever been serious about anything in your life?’ she said. ‘Do you respect nothing and nobody?’” And in Jess’ defence he also plays a major role in coming to her rescue later on towards the novel’s dramatic climax.\n\nThough not immediately part of the narrative, the Vicar of Alturnun, Francis Davey, plays a noteworthy part in the story, particularly in the latter chapters. As a man of God he appears to be the most moralistic of all the characters, as well as Mary’s saviour. However when she goes on the run from Jamaica Inn and seeks Davey’s help, she realises that all is not as it appears. Whilst staying at his vicarage, she feels uneasy by the surroundings of his living room:\n\n“ (…) As Mary prowled about the room (…) she felt as though Francis Davey himself was watching her, his cold eyes probing her soul. The room held something of him after all, now that he was not here, and she could imagine him standing in the corner by the easel, his brush in his hand, staring out of the window at things that were dead and gone. There were canvases with their faces to the wall close to the easel, and Mary turned them to the light in curiosity. Here was an interior of a church (…) There was a strange green afterglow upon the arches, stretching to the roof, and this light was something sudden and unexpected that lingered in her memory after she had laid the picture aside (…) it cast a haunting and uncanny light upon the picture. (…) it was as though some spirit, having no knowledge of the church itself, had groped its way into the interior and breathed an alien atmosphere upon the shadowed nave. As she turned the paintings, one by one, she saw that they were all tainted in the same manner to the same degree (…) She wondered, for the first time, whether by being born albino, and a freak of nature, his colour-sense was therefore in any way impaired, and his sight itself neither normal nor true. This might be the explanation, but even so, her feeling of discomfort remained after she had replaced the canvases with their faces to the wall.”\n\nSome effective creation of mood and atmosphere here, I think. And there is more that Mary discovers which I won’t give away …\n\nSo, what about the story itself? And Du Maurier’s writing style? I’ll discuss the latter before moving on to the former! There are certainly a lot of atmospherically written passages (such as the ones quoted above). However, in terms of style and literary devices I probably wouldn’t rank Jamaica Inn with the likes of Jane Eyre or the other great “classics” of English literature; for me, it straddles some kind of middle ground between popular fiction and more “profound” forms of literature. I guess Daphne Du Maurier was trying to make her books as accessible at possible, whilst delving into the deeper and murkier aspects of life. Certainly the novel plays into many mythical ideas about Cornwall and the descriptions of the landscape, weather, inhabitants and customs all contribute in this respect. And the story? I confess that I did find it rather plodding in places. However the action picks up when Joss realises that he faces certain arrest and imprisonment, once news of the wrecking incident that he was involved in spreads and he decides that Mary and Patience must flee Jamaica Inn with him. These chapters have a particularly tense feel, when Mary escapes from Jamaica Inn and subsequently tries to get help from Francis Davey and the local magistrate, both of whom are absent when she most needs them; the suspense is drawn out effectively as she is forced to walk miles on her own across deserted moorland and countryside – a brave feat indeed. And as hinted at before, the final chapters, in which Davey the Vicar apparently comes to Mary’s aid, contain a very interesting and sinister twist. I confess that I wondered if Davey might have been in league with Joss and the other smugglers – whilst this wasn’t the case, something is definitely off kilter. Beyond this, I won’t reveal precisely what happens next, but as mentioned, Mary DOES get a happy ending. And with the natural order of things restored, she decides, at the last minute, to leave with Jem – perpetuating the age old stereotype that females cannot control their emotions and will willingly “give it all up” for a man. Even those novels that hold a high cache within the English literary canon, such as the aforementioned Jane Eyre, end on a similar note and, in keeping with my earlier comments about the portrayal of women in thrall to men, I did find this aspect rather corny."
