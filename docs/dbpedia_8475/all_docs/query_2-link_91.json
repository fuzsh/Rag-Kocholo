        "text": "Daphne Du Maurier birthday 13th May\n\nSeeing it was my birthday on Monday – the same day as dear Daphne – I am giving away a copy of Jamica Inn – note it is not the edition pictured here – see below.\n\nWhat is it about tales of smugglers, wreckers and pirates that is so deliciously compelling? Even now, in a landlocked city in the 21st century, these kinds of tales are able to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. I can remember being utterly thrilled by Kipling’s poem The Smugglers Song when I first came across it in primary school – it somehow had the same exciting quality about it that those old tales of smugglers always have. Reading those lines now after all these years -it seems pretty tame – the rhythm of the lines echoing the horses trotting through the dark I still find strangely atmospheric.\n\nIf you wake at midnight, and hear a horse’s feet,\n\nDon’t go drawing back the blind, or looking in the street,\n\nThem that ask no questions isn’t told a lie.\n\nWatch the wall my darling while the Gentlemen go by.\n\nFive and twenty ponies,\n\nTrotting through the dark –\n\nBrandy for the Parson, ‘Baccy for the Clerk.\n\nLaces for a lady; letters for a spy,\n\nWatch the wall my darling while the Gentlemen go by!\n\n(Rudyard Kipling)\n\nI had read Jamaica Inn before, a very long time ago – I suspect I was in my teens – all those desolate moors and dangerous men – would have delighted me – actually they still do.\n\nMary Yellan is twenty three when her mother dies, having promised to do so, Mary sets out to find her Aunt Patience, who she hasn’t seen since she was a child. Mary remembers her aunt as a laughing beribboned young woman, her hair curled prettily. However Patience is no longer in Bodmin, but living with her husband on a remote road alongside the moors, in a place called Jamaica Inn. Jamaica Inn is a place whispered about in fear, a place where no coaches dare stop, where no travellers seek shelter. Jamaica Inn is not a place for the feint hearted – her Uncle Joss is a giant of a man, cruel, dangerous frequently drunk and desperate. Patience is now a shadow of her former self, nervous and cowed her hair grey and lank; she scuttles to do her husband’s bidding, twisting her hands in fear. Mary very nearly flees from the inn on her very first night there, staying only to care for her aunt, her plan to somehow get her aunt away from the man she married. Joss Merlyn warns her right from the start that she is to ignore whatever she might see and hear at Jamaica Inn, she will serve in the bar when required to do so, and keep to her room on the nights the wagons come to Jamaica Inn.\n\nMary soon learns to loathe her uncle, but she is a feisty and tough young woman, pushing aside her natural fear of the man, she squares up to him. Mary is brave and moral, sticking fiercely to her principles, wrestling valiantly with a group of her uncle’s associates in the dead of Christmas Eve night. Unwillingly drawn into the dark business that operates out of Jamaica Inn – Mary plans to rescue herself and her aunt from Joss Merlyn before turning him over to the law. It is quickly apparent however that this will be no easy task.\n\nWhen horse thief Jem Merlyn – Joss’s younger brother, turns up at Jamaica Inn, Mary is both repelled and attracted to him. Jem is dangerous, and reminds her strongly of his older, nastier brother, she is certain she should not trust him.\n\nThere is a fantastically gothic, brooding atmosphere to this novel. Du Maurier has in no way romanticised the desperate men that haunted the coast of Cornwall during these brutal days – they are presented as cruel and ruthless criminals. Yet Jamaica Inn is a romantic novel in many ways – Mary Yellan is a fabulous heroine, sparky and determined. I loved every word of this novel, and fairly gulped it down.\n\nA Giveaway\n\nSo then I have a brand new paperback copy of Jamaica Inn to give away, I received the pictured hardback copy above for my birthday, and so the new paperback copy I had TBR is now up for grabs. If you would like it – just drop me a comment below telling me why you would like it. The giveaway is open to everyone, and a winner will be selected by random, if the winner is outside of Europe the book will be sent by surface mail – which can take a while, due to the ridiculous raise of postage costs here in the UK.\n\nI will make the draw on Wednesday the 22nd of May – : )"
