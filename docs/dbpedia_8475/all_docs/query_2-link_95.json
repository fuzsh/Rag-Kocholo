        "text": "The World Famous\n\nJamaica Inn\n\nCornwall's most famous smuggling inn\n\nIn 1750 it became a coaching Inn when coaches first started crossing the moor, linking the towns of Launceston and Bodmin. The Inn is exactly halfway and where horses were changed and weary passengers rested and they have been doing this for the 270 years since then. Its fame became worldwide when Daphne du Maurier wrote the best-selling novel ‘Jamaica Inn’ following her enforced stay in November 1930 in Bedroom 3 where she recovered from the ordeal of getting lost until late at night when out horse riding.\n\nWhilst the character and charm of the old parts of the Inn - the olde worlde bars, some restaurant areas and the ‘old rooms’ 3 to 12 - have been carefully preserved, a recently built new wing now provides contrastingly modern bedrooms with breath-taking views over the moor. In total there are now 36 bedrooms and suites. The Inn also has a Smuggling Museum full of artefacts and where tales of Cornish smugglers, wreckers and villains are brought wonderfully to life in a short film. Its Daphne du Maurier Museum has many recently acquired exhibits including the original letters to Daphne and her husband from the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Lord Mountbatten and others.\n\nThere is also now a Farm Shop stacked with local Cornish produce and a Gift Shop with over 5,000 items to choose from. The Inn is believed to be haunted and many strange sightings happen to this day - especially on the monthly Ghost Hunts if you are brave enough to come to one! Popular Murder Mystery evenings also take place monthly that add to the many things there are to do at Jamaica Inn.\n\nThe Inn is easily reached being by the A30 at Bolventor, midway between Launceston and Bodmin. It is also midway between the north and south coasts and near to the Cornwall and Devon border making it the perfect base to explore anywhere in either county and still be back in time for dinner.\n\nFor satnav the postcode is PL15 7TS."
