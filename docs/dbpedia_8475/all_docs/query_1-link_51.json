First Edition. Soft Cover. Very Good. First edition. Wrappers lightly toned, pages very faintly toned. 1998 Soft Cover. iii, 84 pp. \"Jamaica Inn is a traditional inn on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, United Kingdom. Built as a coaching inn in 1750, and having an association with smuggling, it was the setting for Daphne du Maurier's 1936 novel Jamaica Inn, which was made into the film Jamaica Inn in 1939 by Alfred Hitchcock. Located just off the A30, near the middle of the moor close to the hamlet of Bolventor, it was used as a staging post for changing horses. As well as the Hitchcock film, there has been a 1983 television series, Jamaica Inn, starring Jane Seymour, and a television adaptation in 2014 starring Jessica Brown Findlay directed by Philippa Lowthorpe. In addition to its use in literature, and film, the hotel is referenced in \"Jamaica Inn\", a song written by Tori Amos on her album The Beekeeper, written while she was travelling by car along the road of the Cornwall cliffs, and inspired by the legend she had heard of the inn. The inn became a Grade II listed building in 1988. The hill named Tuber or Two Barrows, 1,122 feet (342 m), is close-by."
