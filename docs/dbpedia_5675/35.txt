Description: (Location & Drainage)

The lateral aortic lymph nodes belong to the left lumbar chain of lymph nodes. The preaortic and retroaortic lymph nodes make up the remainder of this group, where they are interconnected, forming a horseshoe-like arrangement around the abdominal aorta.

The lateral aortic lymph nodes contain 9â12 lymph nodes arranged along the lateral side of the abdominal aorta (FÃ¶ldi et al., 2012). They are also associated with the medial margin of psoas major muscle and the lumbar vertebrae.

The lateral aortic lymph nodes are responsible for draining the deep layers of the posterior abdominal wall and retroperitoneal viscera, including the gonads (ovaries or testes). In addition, the lateral aortic nodes receive lymph from the common iliac lymph nodes draining the lower limb. The efferent lymphatic vessels from the lateral aortic lymph nodes drain into the left lumbar lymph trunk, which drains into the cisterna chyli and the thoracic duct. Some efferents of the lateral aortic lymph nodes pierce the crus of the diaphragm to drain directly into the lower end of the thoracic duct.
