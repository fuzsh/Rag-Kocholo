        "text": "After a woman is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, doctors will try to figure out if it has spread, and if so, how far. This process is called staging. The stage of a cancer describes how much cancer is in the body. It helps determine how serious the cancer is and how best to treat it. Doctors also use a cancer's stage when talking about survival statistics.\n\nOvarian cancer stages range from stage I (1) through IV (4). As a rule, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means cancer has spread more. Although each person’s cancer experience is unique, cancers with similar stages tend to have a similar outlook and are often treated in much the same way.\n\nOne of the goals of surgery for ovarian cancer is to take tissue samples for diagnosis and staging. To stage the cancer, samples of tissues are taken from different parts of the pelvis and abdomen and examined in the lab.\n\nHow is the stage determined?\n\nThe 2 systems used for staging ovarian cancer, the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) system and theAJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) TNM staging system are basically the same.\n\nThey both use 3 factors to stage (classify) this cancer :\n\nThe extent (size) of the tumor (T): Has the cancer spread outside the ovary or fallopian tube? Has the cancer reached nearby pelvic organs like the uterus or bladder?\n\nThe spread to nearby lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to the lymph nodes in the pelvis or around the aorta (the main artery that runs from the heart down along the back of the abdomen and pelvis)? Also called para-aortic lymph nodes.\n\nThe spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to fluid around the lungs (malignant pleural effusion) or to distant organs such as the liver or bones?\n\nNumbers or letters after T, N, and M provide more details about each of these factors. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced. Once a person’s T, N, and M categories have been determined, this information is combined in a process called stage grouping to assign an overall stage.\n\nThe staging system in the table below uses the pathologic stage (also called the surgical stage). It is determined by examining tissue removed during an operation. This is also known as surgical staging. Sometimes, if surgery is not possible right away, the cancer will be given a clinical stage instead. This is based on the results of a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests done before surgery. For more information see Cancer Staging.\n\nThe system described below is the most recent AJCC system effective January 2018. It is the staging system for ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nCancer staging can be complex, so ask your doctor to explain it to you in a way you understand.\n\nAJCC Stage\n\nStage grouping\n\nFIGO Stage\n\nStage description*\n\nI\n\nT1\n\nN0\n\nM0\n\nI\n\nThe cancer is only in the ovary (or ovaries) or fallopian tube(s) (T1).\n\nIt has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) or to distant sites (M0).\n\nIA\n\nT1a\n\nN0\n\nM0\n\nIA\n\nThe cancer is in one ovary, and the tumor is confined to the inside of the ovary; or the cancer is in one fallopian tube, and is only inside the fallopian tube.
