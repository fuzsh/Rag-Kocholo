        "text": "Humans have approximately 500â€“600 lymph nodes distributed throughout the body, with clusters found in the underarms, groin, neck, chest, and abdomen.\n\nOccipital lymph nodes\n\nMastoid lymph nodes\n\nParotid lymph nodes\n\nCervical lymph nodes\n\nSubmental lymph nodes\n\nSubmandibular lymph nodes\n\nDeep cervical lymph nodes\n\nDeep anterior cervical lymph nodes\n\nDeep lateral cervical lymph nodes\n\nInferior deep cervical lymph nodes\n\nJugulo-omohyoid lymph node\n\nJugulodigastric lymph node\n\nSupraclavicular lymph nodes\n\nVirchow's node\n\nLymph nodes of the lungs: The lymph is drained from the lung tissue through subsegmental, segmental, lobar and interlobar lymph nodes to the hilar lymph nodes, which are located around the hilum (the pedicle, which attaches the lung to the mediastinal structures, containing the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary veins, the main bronchus for each side, some vegetative nerves and the lymphatics) of each lung. The lymph flows subsequently to the mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\nMediastinal lymph nodes: They consist of several lymph node groups, especially along the trachea (5 groups), along the esophagus and between the lung and the diaphragm. In the mediastinal lymph nodes arises lymphatic ducts, which drains the lymph to the left subclavian vein (to the venous angle in the confluence of the subclavian and deep jugular veins).\n\nThe mediastinal lymph nodes along the esophagus are in tight connection with the abdominal lymph nodes along the esophagus and the stomach. That fact facilitates spreading of tumor cells through these lymphatics in cases of cancers of the stomach and particularly of the esophagus. Through the mediastinum, the main lymphatic drainage from the abdominal organs goes via the thoracic duct (ductus thoracicus), which drains majority of the lymph from the abdomen to the above mentioned left venous angle.\n\nThese include:\n\nPeriaortic lymph nodes\n\nPreaortic lymph nodes\n\nCeliac lymph nodes\n\nHepatic lymph nodes\n\nGastric lymph nodes\n\nSplenic lymph nodes\n\nSuperior mesenteric lymph nodes\n\nInferior mesenteric lymph nodes\n\nRetroaortic lymph nodes\n\nNodes around the iliac vessels are:\n\nCommon iliac lymph nodes\n\nInternal iliac lymph nodes\n\nExternal iliac lymph nodes\n\nOthers in the pelvis include:\n\nSacral lymph nodes\n\nRetroperitoneal lymph nodes\n\nThese drain the whole of the arm, and are divided into two groups, superficial and deep. The superficial nodes are supplied by lymphatics that are present throughout the arm, but are particularly rich on the palm and flexor aspects of the digits.\n\nSuperficial lymph nodes of the arm:\n\nSupratrochlear nodes: Situated above the medial epicondyle of the humerus, medial to the basilic vein, they drain the C7 and C8 dermatomes.\n\nDeltoideopectoral nodes: Situated between the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles inferior to the clavicle.\n\nDeep lymph nodes of the arm: These comprise the axillary nodes, which are 20-30 individual nodes and can be subdivided into:\n\nLateral nodes\n\nAnterior or pectoral nodes\n\nPosterior or subscapular nodes\n\nCentral or intermediate nodes\n\nMedial or subclavicular nodes\n\nSuperficial inguinal lymph nodes\n\nDeep inguinal lymph nodes\n\nPopliteal lymph nodes\n\nThe lymphatic vessels that link the lymph nodes are:"
