        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nEndometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract in China, with an incidence rate of 7.74 per 100,000 people and a mortality rate of 1.6 per 100,000 people.[1] Globally, endometrial cancer is the 4th most common cause of malignancy among women with an incidence rate of 7% in 2021 and accounts for 4% of cancer-related deaths.[2] Occurring predominantly after menopause, endometrial cancer is a rare occurrence in pre-menopausal women and a family history of endometrial cancer, early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, tamoxifen, age (older than 55) and obesity are associated with an increased risk whereas high parity, late age at last birth and use of contraceptive pills confer a long-lasting protection against endometrial cancer.[3]\n\nSurgery, either open, laparoscopic or robotic, remains the mainstay treatment for endometrial cancer[4] and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system and the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor, node, metastasis are used for staging.[5] For patients with advanced stage endometrial cancer, surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy can significantly improve the prognosis and disease recurrence.[6] Lymph node metastasis is the primary route of metastasis of malignant uterine tumors as well as the main recurrence cause[7] and the main risk factors of lymphatic involvement are myometrial involvement and histologic grade.[8] Lymphadenectomy is an essential approach for endometrial carcinoma in terms of staging (identification of positive lymph nodes) and prognosis and comprises of systematic pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes dissection.[9] Pelvic lymphadenectomy involves the removal of common iliac, external iliac, internal iliac, obturator and presacral nodes while para-aortic lymph nodes include pre-aortic, precaval, para-aortic, paracaval, and retro-aortic nodes.[10]\n\nLymph node staging has prognostic value, and thus may aid in preventing unnecessary postoperative treatment.[11,12] The possible postoperative complications of lymph node resection such as lymphedema, lymphocyst, ileus, blood loss, nerve or vascular injury, blood transfusion, prolonged hospital stays, and higher treatment costs.[13] Accurately identifying and removing metastatic lymph nodes and reducing surgical complications has always been one of the focus and hotspot for surgeons.\n\nThere are many lymph node pathways in the spread of endometrial carcinoma, but the clear mechanism is not yet fully elucidated. When the endometrial lesion is located near the lower uterine segment, the route of lymphatic metastasis is basically the same as that of cervical cancer: first and foremost to the pelvic lymph nodes, and subsequently to the para-aortic lymph nodes.[14] The most common pelvic lymph nodes involved in endometrial carcinoma are the external iliac, internal iliac and obturator lymph nodes.[15] Skipping metastasis, direct para-aortic lymph node metastasis without pelvic lymph node involvement, occurs rarely.[16] Nonetheless, sentinel lymph node studies have suggested that a direct route (skip metastasis) of lymphatic spread from the corpus uteri (body of uterus) to the para-aortic lymph nodes when the lesion is located in the corpus uteri.[17]\n\nExisting studies suggest that malignant tumors in different sites of the uterus will have different lymph node metastatic pathways.[18] If a model for predicting the approximate location of lymph node metastasis from the primary uterine tumor site can be established, it will help improve surgical accuracy, reduce post-operative complications and prevent unnecessary overtreatment. Currently, there are very few research reports on the correlation between the primary location of uterine malignant tumor and the location of lymph node spread. This retrospective study analyzes the characteristics of lymph node metastasis in patients with uterine malignancies and its clinical symptoms and prognosis, in order to determine the relationship between the primary location of tumor and lymph node metastasis, thus providing a possible guidance towards clinical approach.\n\n2. Patients and methods\n\n2.1. Study population and selection criteria\n\nTwo hundred twelve patients with endometrial cancer who underwent surgical treatment at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University from December 2014 to December 2019 were retrieved and analyzed for this retrospective study. The approval of our Institutional review board and Ethics committee was obtained to conduct this study. All patients and/or family members provided written informed consent. All specimens of surgery were reviewed by our expert pathologist to confirm the histological diagnosis.\n\nThe inclusion criteria for patients with endometrial cancer included in our study are: Complete clinical and pathological data; prior to surgery, the diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma was confirmed by segmental curettage of uterine cavity; the patient did not receive hormone therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy or any other related treatments pre-operatively; comprehensive staged operations and sentinel lymph node imaging were performed, including peritoneal lavage, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, all patients underwent nodal surgical staging (sentinel lymph node biopsy alone or systematic lymphadenectomy).\n\nExclusion criteria included patients with other malignant tumors, patients who are unable to tolerate comprehensive surgery due to other systemic serious diseases and those with no lymph node resection.\n\nThe patient relevant clinical information and pathological data were recorded including general information, pre-operative ultrasound and imaging tests, age of menarche, number of pregnancies (gravidity), number of childbirth (parity), pre-menopause or post-menopause and specific age of menopause (if relevant). Post-operative pathological analysis was recorded including tumor size and pathological type, depth of muscle invasion, tissue classification, cervical involvement, lymphovascular or adnexal involvement, and vaginal or parametrial involvement.\n\n2.2. Research methods\n\nPrior to surgery, tumor markers, Color Flow Doppler ultrasound evaluation of uterus and ovary, abdominal CT, pelvic MRI and other routine examinations were performed to rule out any surgical contraindications. All 212 patients underwent total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and 142 patients underwent para-aortic lymph nodes resection or biopsy in addition with pelvic lymphadenectomy. The lymph nodes retrieved peri-operatively were marked according to their anatomical location and placed in separate specimen bags. The samples were sent to the pathology department for further analysis, where the pathologists recorded the number of lymph nodes retrieved from the different locations. Noteworthy, the pathological slides were examined by 2 highly skilled pathologists and the number of metastatic (positive) lymph nodes were recorded.\n\n2.3. Data collection and measured outcomes\n\nClinical data were recorded including general condition, clinical stage, surgical method and approach, pathological type and grade, location of tumor lesion (cervix, lower uterine segment-isthmus, uterine body, uterine fundus and uterine horns), location of positive lymph nodes\n\nUnivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to analyze the factors related to lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer and cervical cancer.\n\nTo analyze the correlation between the location of uterine malignant tumor lesions and the location of lymph node metastasis.\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\n\nThe measurement data conforming to the normal distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and were assessed by performing Student t tests. The counting data were expressed as rate (%). Fisher exact probability or Chi-square test, univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the relevant factors affecting the lymph node metastasis of patients, and a P-value < .05 revealed a statistically significant difference. The SPSS 22.0 software was used to conduct statistical analyses.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Patient clinical data\n\nThe overall data from the 212 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed (Table 1). The mean age of all patients was 50.53 ± 8.10 years (range: 24–78 years old). The age of menarche was 10 to 17 years old (mean: 14.81 ± 1.86 years old). The menopausal age was 44 to 54 years, with an average of 49.30 ± 3.52 years old. In terms of number of pregnancies (gravidity), 22 patients had a history of pregnancy once and 190 patients had a history of 2 or more pregnancies. Regarding number of childbirth (parity), 107 patients gave birth once, and 105 patients gave birth twice or more. As to pathological type, 204 cases were classified as type I endometrioid adenocarcinoma and 8 cases were classified as type II non-endometrioid carcinoma. Concerning histopathological grading, 115 cases of well-differentiated, 64 cases of moderately differentiated patients and 33 cases of poorly differentiated were identified. Regarding tumor size, 67 cases were < 2 cm and 145 cases were ≥ 2 cm. In terms of the depth of myometrial invasion, 128 cases were less than half and 84 cases were equal to or greater than half. The patients were as staged as per the FIGO system: 176 patients were in stage I, 10 patients were in stage II and 26 patients were in stage III.\n\n3.2. Analysis of factors influencing lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrial carcinoma\n\n3.2.1. Univariate analysis of lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer.\n\nLymph node metastasis occurred in 17 out of the 212 patients with endometrial carcinoma. Univariate analysis showed that lymph node metastasis was significantly correlated with FIGO stage, depth of myometrial invasion, tumor size, pathological grade, and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (P < .05). Lymph node metastasis was not correlated with age, pathological type and cervical involvement (P > .05), as shown in Table 2.\n\n3.2.2. Multivariate regression analysis of lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrial carcinoma.\n\nThe differences in FIGO stage, depth of myometrial invasion, tumor size, histopathological grade and LVSI in the univariate analysis were included in the Logistic regression analysis. The results showed that FIGO stage, depth of myometrial invasion, tumor size, histopathological grade and LVSI were independent risk factors affecting lymph node metastasis of endometrial cancer (P < .05), as shown in Table 3.\n\n3.3. Analysis of the relationship between the location of endometrial carcinoma lesion and lymph node metastasis\n\n3.3.1. Data on lymph node metastasis of endometrial carcinoma.\n\nOut of the 212 patients with endometrial cancer included in this study, 17 patients had lymph node metastases, and the metastatic rate was 8.02%. Among them, 5 cases had only para-aortic lymph node metastases, 8 cases had only pelvic lymph node metastases, and 4 cases had concurrent pelvic lymph nodes and para-aortic lymph nodes metastases. The most common pelvic lymph node involved in metastasis was obturator lymph node. Among the 17 patients with lymph node metastasis, 6 cases had 2 or more groups of lymph nodes involved at the same time. Table 4 summarizes our findings.\n\n3.3.2. The relationship between the tumor site of endometrial carcinoma (cervix/lower uterine segment uterine body/fundus or uterine horn) and the site of lymph node metastasis.\n\nAmong the 212 endometrial cancer patients included in the study, 17 cases had lymph node metastasis. 76 cases presented with the primary lesion located in the fundus and cornua of uterus (uterine horns) with a respective 7 cases of lymph node metastases. 117 cases presented with lesions in the uterine body and 7 positive lymph nodes. The remaining 19 cases presented with lower uterine segment lesions or cervical involvement, out of which 3 cases were positive for lymph node metastases (2 for the lower uterine segment and 1 cervical involvement).\n\nAmong the 17 cases of endometrial carcinoma with lymph node metastasis, 9 cases had para-aortic lymph node metastasis, out of which 6 cases were located in the fundus and cornua of uterus (uterine horns) and 3 cases were located in the uterine body. 5 of the 9 cases directly metastasized to the para-aortic lymph nodes, 4 cases simultaneously metastasized to both pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes while 5 cases metastasized to the pelvic lymph nodes only. Among the 2 positive lymph nodes cases for the lower uterine segment, obturator lymph node was the only positive lymph node for metastasis. When the cervix was involved in 1 out of the 17 positive cases, the obturator, internal iliac, external iliac, and common iliac lymph nodes were all positive for metastasis. The most common pelvic lymph nodes involved were obturator and internal iliac lymph nodes.\n\nAmong the 212 patients with endometrial cancer included in this study, the incidence of lymph node metastasis sites in patients with different primary tumor sites was significantly different. As shown in Table 5, primary tumors in the fundus or cornua of uterus (uterine horns) were most likely to metastasize to para-aortic lymph nodes, and the incidence of metastasis from primary tumors in the fundus or uterine horns was significantly higher than that in other location of primary uterine tumors. Primary tumors arising in the uterine body have the possibility of lymph node metastasis in each group, with obturator lymph node being the most common metastatic site. When the primary lesion is located in the lower segment of the uterus, obturator lymph node metastasis is most likely to occur.\n\nSince there is no significant difference in other independent risk factors and parameters of lymph node metastasis in each group (excluding pathological grade, depth of myometrial invasion, tumor size, FIGO stage, and LVSI), it is reasonable to summarize the correlation model of lymph node metastasis sites/groups according to uterine malignant tumors of different primary sites based on the above results.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Risk factors affecting lymph node metastasis in endometrial carcinoma\n\nEndometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy with a global rising incidence.[19] The 5-year survival rate of endometrial cancer is 90% if the lesion is localized and treated early, but decreases to 71% and 18% if spread to regional lymph nodes and distant metastasis, respectively, occur.[20,21] Lymph nodes metastasis is one of the main metastatic pathway of endometrial cancer and is one of the most important prognostic factors and the site of lymph node metastasis may also significantly impact prognosis.[22] Despite lymph node resection being a useful prognostic and therapeutic tool in prolonging survival and aiding in accurately staging endometrial cancer[23,24] so as to determine necessary adjuvant treatment, the use and extent of lymphadenectomy in patients with endometrial carcinoma is an ongoing debate and remains controversial.[25,26]\n\nIn the process of clinical treatment and surgical approach, the situation of lymph node metastasis should be fully evaluated, and the surgical approach should be selected reasonably and devised individually, so as to provide a basis for staging, postoperative treatment and prognosis judgement,[27] thus reducing morbidity. According to the National Cancer Network, lymph nodes evaluation through sentinel lymph node mapping may be considered for early-staged and uterine-confined disease for low-intermediate risk patients as well as those who are unable to withstand full lymphadenectomy.[28]\n\nSeveral studies have shown that pathological type of non-endometrioid carcinoma (Type II), FIGO stage, myometrial invasion and LVSI have independent predictive significance for lymph node metastasis.[29,30] Consistent with previous literatures, our study also proved that the risk of lymph node metastasis is significantly higher in patients with primary tumor size exceeding 2 cm, poorly differentiated histopathological grade, FIGO stage III, type II non-endometrioid carcinoma and myometrial invasion equal to or >1/2, which are independent risk factors of lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer.[31–33]\n\nSince deep myometrial invasion (equal to or >2 cm) has been considered as an independent predictor of risk of lymph node metastasis, it has always been included in the FIGO staging.[20] Myometrial invasion is a strong predictor of poor prognosis in endometrial cancer,[9,34] which is consistent with our findings. LVSI is a poor prognostic factor in terms of recurrence and survival in patients with early-staged endometrial cancer,[35] and thus the use of adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) could be beneficial for such patients. LVSI has been considered to independently predict lymph node metastasis and may advocate for the use of frozen section analysis of lymph nodes for patients with endometrial carcinoma.[36] A large prospective study conducted by Stalberg et al[37] found that LVSI was associated with a decreased survival and is a strong independent risk factor for lymph node metastases in patients with endometrioid adenocarcinomas, consistent with our findings.\n\nPrevious studies revealed that FIGO staging, especially cervical invasion, is of great significance for the prognosis of endometrial cancer.[38] Patients with early-stage endometrial cancer with cervical invasion have a poor prognosis,[39] and patients with endometrial cancer presenting with cervical invasion often have other adverse prognostic factors, such as high tumor grade, poorly differentiated histology, deep myometrial invasion and LVSI.[40] Univariate analysis showed that FIGO stage, primary tumor size, and pathological grade were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis,[30,41] which was consistent with our findings. However, in our study, univariate analysis did not find that the specific pathological type of endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid or non-endometrioid) and cervical invasion were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Further large study samples need to be warranted to assess a possible significance.\n\n4.2. Pathways of lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer\n\nLymph node metastasis is one of the main metastatic pathway of endometrial cancer. Despite pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection being one of the cornerstones of surgical treatment and staging of endometrial cancer,[24] surgical lymph node dissection varies worldwide, ranging from zero lymph node dissection, to sentinel node mapping to complete pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.[42] As mentioned previously, the most likely site of pelvic node metastasis is the obturator lymph node, followed by the internal and external iliac lymph nodes. A study by Fotopoulou et al[43] of 62 patients (with 13 positive lymph nodes) revealed that 8 out of the 13 patients had concurrent pelvic and para-aortic positive lymph nodes, 3 patients (23%) had only positive pelvic lymph nodes and 15.4% had only positive para-aortic lymph node metastasis, where 54% of the positive para-aortic lymph nodes were above the level of the inferior mesenteric artery. A meta-analysis by Guo et al[44] revealed that pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy up to the level of renal vein was associated with a better progression free survival compared with only pelvic lymph node resection.\n\nOur study also provided similar and consistent findings. 17 cases of lymph node metastasis occurred in 212 patients with endometrial cancer, including 5 cases of only para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and 4 cases of concurrent pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Given that some cases presented with only para-aortic lymph nodes metastasis, skip metastasis directly to para-aortic lymph nodes without an initial pelvic lymph node pathway cannot be excluded. Therefore, in the preoperative evaluation of patients, it is necessary to judge the depth of myometrial invasion of endometrial cancer through MRI[45] and the histopathological classification of curettage so as to develop an individualized treatment plan, and carry out targeted para-aortic lymph node biopsy or dissection.\n\n4.3. Relationship between tumor location and lymph node metastasis in endometrial carcinoma\n\nOur study revealed that endometrial cancer has multiple lymphatic metastasis pathways. When the lesion is near the lower uterine segment, it will first metastasize to the pelvic lymph nodes, and subsequently to the para-aortic lymph nodes. The obturator, internal iliac and external iliac lymph nodes are the most likely pelvic lymph nodes metastatic sites. When the lesion is near the uterine fundus or uterine horn, its metastasis route is similar to that of epithelial ovarian cancer[46]; only the pelvic region or simultaneous occurrence of both pelvic and para-aortic positive lymph nodes as well as directly metastasizing to only the para-aortic lymph nodes (skip metastasis).\n\nOur study was consistent with previous findings[47,48] and proved that the rate of lymph node metastasis was related to different high-risk factors such as clinical stage, pathological grade, depth of myometrial invasion, and LVSI. When these high-risk factors are consistent, the location of the primary tumor is also highly correlated with the location of lymph node metastasis. Capozzi et al[49] revealed Regarding the primary outcome, only the tumor pattern diffused to the whole uterine cavity was statistically associated with SLN uptake on common iliac lymph nodes (OR 2.4,95%CI 1e5.8, p ¼ 0.05).\n\nOur study also revealed that when the primary tumor is located in the uterine fundus or uterine horns, para-aortic lymph nodes are most likely to be involved, and the incidence of metastasis is significantly higher than that of other primary tumors; primary tumors of the uterine body have the possibility of lymph node metastasis in both pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes group, with obturator lymph node metastasis most likely to occur; lesions located in the uterine body are accompanied by para-aortic and pelvic lymph node metastasis, and obturator lymph nodes are all positive; obturator lymph node metastasis is most likely to occur when the primary lesion is located in the lower uterine segment; the obturator lymph node metastasis rate of patients with cervical involvement was significantly higher than that of tumors at other primary sites. In patients with positive para-aortic lymph nodes and cervical involvement, obturator and external iliac were positive. These results are consistent with the well-known lymphatic metastasis pathways of cervical cancer and endometrial cancer.[50,51]\n\nThe principle of individualized treatment approach should be applied in the management of endometrial cancer. It is clinically urgent to fully understand the characteristics of lymph node metastasis and its related risk factors as well as the relevant lymph nodes sites involved in accordance with the primary uterine tumor site, which is conducive in deciding whether to perform lymph node resection and the scope of resection. Although pelvic/para-aortic lymphadenectomy is important for surgical staging and prognosis, to date no randomized trial has shown a survival benefit of performing a full pelvic/para-aortic lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer. The therapeutic effect of pelvic lymphadenectomy and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy on endometrial carcinoma and its impact on long-term prognosis is still controversial, with overtreatment being the main issue. The limitation of our study included a retrospective investigation and a small study sample. A prospective, multi-center comprehensive study with a long-term follow-up is in need to establish the impact of lymph node metastasis on the prognosis of endometrial cancer and the significant relevant lymph node metastatic sites in accordance with the primary uterine tumor site.\n\nAuthor contributions"
