        "meta_description": "Objectives We aimed to evaluate the utilization and impact of surgical para-aortic lymph node staging on the survival of patients with locally advanced stage cervical carcinoma receiving definitive chemoradiation.\n\nMethods We identified patients in the National Cancer Database diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2015 with locally advanced (FIGO 2009 stage IB2-IVA) cervical carcinoma who did not undergo hysterectomy, received primary chemoradiation and had at least 1 month of follow-up. Two groups of patients were formed based on the assessment method of para-aortic lymph node status – radiologic assessment only versus surgical lymphadenectomy. Overall survival was compared with the log-rank test after Kaplan-Meier curves were generated. A Cox model was constructed to control for a priori selected confounders.\n\nResults We identified a total of 3540 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Para-aortic staging was performed in 333 (9.4%) patients. These patients were younger (median age 46 vs 52 years, p<0.001), less likely to have co-morbidities (8.7% vs 15.6%, p<0.001), more likely to have private insurance (48.9% vs 37.8%, p<0.001) and receive brachytherapy (76.9% vs 70.9%, p=0.022). The rate of para-aortic lymphadenectomy was comparable between patients with stage IB2-II and III-IVA disease (9.4% for both groups, p=0.98). Patients who underwent para-aortic lymphadenectomy were also more likely to have lymph nodes categorized as positive compared with those who had imaging only (27.3% vs 13.2%, p<0.001). There was no difference in overall survival between patients who underwent radiologic only or surgical para-aortic lymph node assessment (p=0.80 from log-rank test); 4 year overall survival rates were 62.9% and 63%. After controlling for confounders, performance of para-aortic lymphadenectomy was not associated with a survival benefit (HR 1.07, 95% CIs: 0.88 to 1.31).\n\nConclusions In a large cohort of patients with locally advanced stage cervical carcinoma, para-aortic lymphadenectomy was rarely performed and not associated with a survival benefit.\n\nData may be obtained from a third party and are not publicly available.

        "text": "Results in the context of published literature\n\nData comparing surgical to clinical staging in the cervical cancer population has been mixed with respect to feasibility, safety, and overall survival outcomes.7–11 For example, a retrospective study by Pomel et al evaluated 187 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. The authors demonstrated that patients undergoing para-aortic lymph node dissection had lower disease-free survival compared with clinical staging.10 On the other hand, Ramirez et al prospectively compared the sensitivity of PET-CT to surgical staging.13 A total of 60 patients were enrolled and underwent both PET-CT and extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Among patients who had negative pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes on PET-CT (n=26), para-aortic metastases were found in 12%, while for patients who had positive pelvic but negative para-aortic lymph node on PET-CT (n=27) the incidence of para-aortic metastases was 22%. Overall, treatment modification following surgical staging occurred in 11 patients (18.3%). In a recent meta-analysis, Delara et al reported comparable oncologic outcomes between surgical and clinical staging.11 Authors included data from five studies, with a total of 1112 patients with FIGO 2009 stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer; 754 of them had surgical staging.11 Based on 132 patients who underwent para-aortic lymphadenectomy, the rate of lymph node metastases was 33% and comparable to the rate of metastases observed in our study.11 Based on data from four studies, there were no differences in progression-free survival (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.74) or overall survival (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.69) between surgical and imaging staging groups, although significant heterogeneity was found (I square 75%).11 Finally, two studies evaluated the concordance between imaging and surgical staging for the detection of para-aortic lymph node metastases and reported a relative low sensitivity (33.3%–62.5%) but a high specificity (92%–95.5%).11 In a pooled analysis of 685 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer who participated in three large phase III Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) trials, 555 patients underwent surgical para-aortic lymph node sampling.14 By multivariable analysis, radiologic staging was associated with worse progression-free survival (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.81) and overall survival (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.99) while a higher rate of para-aortic relapse was observed (31.9% vs 15.1%, p=0.006).14\n\nGiven the potential bias of retrospective studies, three randomized controlled trials have so far attempted to address the role of surgical staging in managing patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.12 15 16 A two-step randomized trial from Taiwan was terminated following recruitment of 61 patients after an interim analysis demonstrated significantly worse progression-free survival (HR 3.13, p=0.005) in the surgical staging arm.15 In that study the rate of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in the surgical arm was again comparable to our study (25%).14\n\nA recently published, multi-institutional international randomized controlled trial (UTERUS-11) recruited 255 patients with stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer between 2009 and 2013. The patients had received pelvic external beam radiation therapy, weekly cisplatin and brachytherapy, and were randomized to radiologic staging (with biopsy if suspicious findings) or laparoscopic surgical staging.12 16 For the 121 patients who underwent surgical staging (transperitoneal approach for 93.4%), no intra-operative death occurred, while only 1 (0.8%) patient had conversion to laparotomy, and excessive blood loss (>500 mL) was observed in two patients.17 The post-operative complication rate was also low (7.3%) demonstrating that laparoscopic surgical staging is safe in this patient population with minimal peri-operative morbidity.16 Among patients undergoing surgical staging, 51% had positive pelvic lymph nodes and 24% had positive para-aortic lymph nodes, resulting in the upstaging of 33% of patients compared with 8% in the clinical arm (by CT-guided lymph node biopsy).12 Importantly, there was no difference in the time to primary chemoradiation between the two groups (median of 13 vs 13.5 days in the surgical and clinical group, respectively).12 15 Despite the significant difference in upstaging, and the resulting change in radiation therapy treatment planning, there was no difference in disease-free survival between the two groups (adjusted HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.08, p=0.12).12 However, surgical staging was associated with better cancer-specific survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93) and in an ad-hoc analyses, with better progression-free survival for patients with stage IIB disease (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.86).12 It should be mentioned that cancer-specific survival was not one of the trial endpoints while stratification by disease stage was not pre-planned. In our study, we found a longer interval between diagnosis and initiation of radiation therapy for patients who underwent surgical para-aortic staging (median 55 vs 38 days, p<0.001). Whether this difference is related to barriers to health care access, delay in final stage assignment or increased rate of complications remains unclear.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses\n\nA major strength of our study is the inclusion of a large cohort of patients derived from a hospital-based database reflecting current real-world practice in the United States. Several limitations should be mentioned. First, given the absence of a central pathology report, possible histology and stage misclassifications cannot be ruled out. While all patients who underwent surgical staging had pathologic examination of the resected lymph nodes, information on the presence of micro or macrometastases was not provided, and we could not verify whether lymph node counts included exclusively para-aortic lymph nodes. Interestingly, a large percentage of patients in both surgical and radiologic staging groups did not receive brachytherapy contrary to national guidelines. Moreover, the National Cancer Database does not collect data on tumor recurrence precluding us from analyzing differences in progression-free survival and the pattern of relapse. In addition, no data on the imaging modality employed (PET-CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT) to evaluate para-aortic lymph node metastases in the clinical or surgical staging group were available. While all patients underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy, information on the extent of radiation fields and whether para-aortic lymph node basins were included was not available. For patients undergoing surgical staging, we did not have data on the route of lymphadenectomy (intra-peritoneal or extra-peritoneal) that could theoretically impact peri-operative outcomes17 or data on the upper border of dissection. Also, data on patient reported quality of life or the incidence of treatment related toxicity were not available. For patients who had only radiologic staging, we could not assess whether biopsy of any suspicious lymph nodes was performed. Lastly, unmeasured factors such as patient functional status and the individual surgeon’s preferences may have influenced the decision to perform surgical staging."
