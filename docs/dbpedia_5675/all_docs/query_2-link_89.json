        "text": "Perianal and Anal Canal Neoplasms\n\nPhilip H. Gordon, Santhat Nivatvongs, Lee E. Smith, Scott Thorn Barrows, Carla Gunn, Gregory Blew, David Ehlert, Craig Kiefer, Kim Martens in Neoplasms of the Colon, Rectum, and Anus, 2007\n\nThe most important part of diagnosis is digital examination of the anal canal. The size, consistency, and fixation of the primary lesion and the presence or absence of pararectal lymph nodes can be determined. Proctoscopy should be done to confirm the digital findings, and the exact location of the neoplasm in relationship to the dentate line should be documented. Biopsy via proctoscope or transanal excision of the neoplasm must be done to determine the histologic type of the carcinoma, thus enabling an appropriate recommendation for treatment. A colonoscopic examination should be done to rule out more proximal associated lesions. Endorectal ultrasonography is useful in evaluating the depth of invasion and detection of lymph node metastasis.\n\nAnatomy\n\nJonathan M. Fishman, Vivian A. Elwell, Rajat Chowdhury in OSCEs for the MRCS Part B, 2017\n\nThe rectum has no mesentery and is therefore regarded as retroperitoneal. It is covered by peritoneum on its front and sides in its upper third, only on its front in its middle third and the rectum lies below the peritoneal reflection in its lower third. Do not be confused; although the rectum has no mesentery, the visceral pelvic fascia around the rectum is often referred to by surgeons as the mesorectum. The pararectal lymph nodes are found within the mesorectum, which is removed together with the rectum as a package during rectal excision for carcinoma.\n\nSBA Answers and Explanations\n\nVivian A. Elwell, Jonathan M. Fishman, Rajat Chowdhury in SBAs for the MRCS Part A, 2018\n\nThe rectum has no mesentery and is therefore regarded as retroperitoneal. It is covered by peritoneum on its front and sides in its upper third, only on its front in its middle third and the rectum lies below the peritoneal reflection in its lower third. Do not be confused; although the rectum has no mesentery, the visceral pelvic fascia around the rectum is often referred to by surgeons as the mesorectum. The pararectal lymph nodes are found within the mesorectum, which is removed together with the rectum as a package during rectal excision for carcinoma.\n\nTotal mesorectal excision – 40 years of standard of rectal cancer surgery\n\nPublished in Acta Chirurgica Belgica, 2020\n\nJ. Votava, D. Kachlik, J. Hoch\n\nThe TME can be defined as a sharp dissection and a complete removal of the mesorectum, containing pararectal lymph nodes, along with its intact enveloping fascia [15]. Operative steps of the TME as described by Heald [16] are: 1. ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery at its origin; 2. mobilization of the left colic flexure; 3. transection of the left-sided colon at the junction between the descending and sigmoid colon; 4. sharp dissection in the avascular plane into the pelvis ventrally to the presacral fascia (of Waldeyer) and outside the enveloping visceral fascia of the rectum; 5. division of the lymphatic vessels and middle rectal vessels ventrolaterally at the level of the pelvic floor, 6. inclusion of all pelvic fat tissue and lymphatic structures to the level of the pelvic floor."
