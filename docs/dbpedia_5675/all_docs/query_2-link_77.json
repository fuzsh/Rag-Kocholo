        "text": "Please can you give a brief introduction to robotic RPLND and how this procedure has traditionally been performed?\n\nRobotic RPLND utilizes laparoscopy combined with robotic technology to perform dissection and removal of lymph node tissue in the retroperitoneum both as a staging as well as therapeutic procedure for patients with testicular cancer.\n\nRobotic RPLND requires 6 small 8-10mm incisions to allow access to the abdomen. Traditionally, RPLND is performed via a large mid-line abdominal incision from just below the rib cage to just above the pubic symphysis.\n\nThe procedure performed either via the open or robotic approach is the same but differs in regards to sidedness of procedure. The primary landing site for right-sided tumors is the interaortocaval region followed by precaval and then preaortic nodes. Left-sided tumors primarily metastasize to the preaortic and para-caval nodes and then to the interaortocaval region. Contralateral spread is more common for right-sided tumors due to lymphatic cross-over (1).\n\nThe above knowledge combined with an understanding of the neuro-anatomy of ejaculation has aided in the development of modified right and sided templates with nerve sparing when deemed appropriate (2-5).\n\nThe modified right-sided RPLND template is bounded superiorly by the right renal artery, medially by the lateral aspect of the aorta, laterally by the ipsilateral ureter, and inferiorly by the inferior mesenteric artery and ipsilateral common and external iliac vessels. The right-sided template focuses on removal of lymph nodes in the interaortocaval, precaval and preaortic regions.\n\nA modified left-sided template RPLND follows the same contralateral boundaries with the focus on removing lymph nodes in the interaortocaval, left paraortic and preaortic regions above the inferior mesenteric artery.\n\nThese modified templates have resulted in greater than 90% postoperative ejaculatory emission (4). Further nerve-sparing studies identifying and preserving sympathetic fibers intraoperatively have resulted in greater than 98% postoperative ejaculatory function (6).\n\nSogani PC.

Initial Series of Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection for Clinical Stage I Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Testicular Cancer. Euro Urol. 60(6): 1299-1302, 2011.\n\nWhat are the benefits of robotic RPLND?\n\nRobotic RPLND is truly a game changer in the multimodality treatment options for testicular cancer. While morbidity of traditional open surgery ranges between 3-4 days in the hospital there is greater than 4 weeks recovery to normal activity and normal bowel function in addition to pain requirements.\n\nRobotic RPLND results in a 1-2 day hospital stay with most patients resuming normal bowel function and physical activity within 1-2 weeks and minimal pain requirements beyond 3-4 days after surgery. Surgical staging corroborates the open technique.\n\nWith enhanced three-dimensional visualization and precise surgical instrumentation provided by the robotic system I was able to perform a meticulous and complete modified nerve sparing RPLND template. The great vessels were mobilized and when necessary lumbar veins and arteries were easily identified and divided in a ‘split and roll’ fashion.5 The IVC and aorta were lifted off of the posterior abdominal wall and anterior spinous ligament to ensure complete resection of lymphatic tissue.\n\nI did not feel limited in this dissection and the placement of our robotic trocars eliminated clashing which is sometimes an issue with other robotic procedures.\n\nPatients with high-risk features such as embryonal carcinoma with or without lymphovascular invasion are primarily offered chemotherapy due to the oncologic efficacy and minimal morbidity when compared to open RPLND.\n\nRobotic RPLND may provide these patients and practitioners a minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic alternative and thus be an attractive alternative to immediate chemotherapy.\n\nWilliams SB, Lau CS, Josephson DY. Initial Series of Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection for Clinical Stage I Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Testicular Cancer. Euro Urol. 60(6): 1299-1302, 2011.\n\nIs there a large learning curve associated with robotic RPLND?\n\nThere are few centers of excellence that perform traditional open RPLND and even fewer centers that have attempted to perform robotic RPLND. There is a tremendous learning curve associated with understanding the precise anatomy of the retroperitoneum and specifically how this relates to testicular cancer ‘landing zones’.\n\nI was fortunate to train under one of the world leaders in open RPLND as well as formal training in robotic surgery. This procedure was challenging and only surgeons with extensive open urologic oncology training in RPLND and robotic surgical experience should consider this approach.\n\nWhat are the downsides of current robotic RPLND procedures and how do you think these can be overcome?\n\nLaparoscopic RPLND has been purported to offer a minimally invasive alternative to the open approach with precise lymph node staging.1 Laparoscopic dissection has been limited in that retrocaval and retroaortic tissue is not routinely resected owing to the difficulty with the laparoscopic approach.1\n\nIt should be mentioned that these laparoscopic RPLND data are derived from well experienced laparoscopic surgeons at select tertiary centers. Robotic technology overcomes this limitation with the ability to a perform meticulous and complete lymph node dissection.2\n\nRassweiler JJ, Scheitlin W, Heidenreich A, Laguna MP, Janetschek G. Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: does it still have a role in the management of clinical stage I nonseminomatous testis cancer? A European perspective. Eur Urol. Nov 2008;54(5):1004-1015.\n\nWilliams SB, Lau CS, Josephson DY. Initial Series of Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection for Clinical Stage I Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Testicular Cancer. Euro Urol. 60(6): 1299-1302, 2011.\n\nWhere is robotic RPLND currently available and which testicular cancer patients are eligible for this procedure?\n\nRobotic RPLND is offered by few urologic oncologists at centers of excellence. Patients with clinical stage I (CSI) non-seminomatous germ cell tumors specifically with high risk features such as embryonal carcinoma with or without lymphovascular invasion are primarily offered chemotherapy due to the oncologic efficacy and minimal morbidity when compared to open RPLND.\n\nRobotic RPLND may provide these patients and practitioners a minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic alternative and thus be an attractive alternative to immediate chemotherapy. As I observed in our series, robotic RPLND provided a meticulous and clean dissection which may not only eliminate viable tumor but chemoresistant teratoma as well.\n\nWhile promising, further application to CS IIa and post-chemotherapy patients should be investigated only once additional study for CSI patients deem it oncologic and functionally equivalent to the open approach.\n\nWilliams SB, Lau CS, Josephson DY. Initial Series of Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection for Clinical Stage I Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Testicular Cancer. Euro Urol. 60(6): 1299-1302, 2011.\n\nWhat impact do you think robotic assisted procedures will have on patient outcomes?\n\nThe use of robotics will result in fewer hospital stays, less pain, smaller incisions and hopefully allow greater number of patients to be offered procedures they may have not been offered beforehand due to increased morbidity with open procedures.\n\nWhat are your plans for the future?\n\nI continue to be actively involved in both the clinical and research aspects of urologic oncology primarily dedicated to outcomes research. This will become imperative as we embark upon a new era in health care.\n\nI serve on the Foundation Board of Directors at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and I look forward to additional administrative responsibilities to improve the quality of care to our patients.\n\nWhere can readers find more information?\n\nReaders may refer to my websites www.ocurology.com and in addition to www.sjo.org/cancer.
