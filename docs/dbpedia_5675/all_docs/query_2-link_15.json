This study investigated the performance of 18FDG PET-CT in assessing para-aortic (PA) lymph-node involvement in high-risk endometrial cancer. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study carried out between 2009 and 2018. The inclusion criteria were high-risk and locally advanced type 1 or 2 endometrial cancer with 18FDG PET-CT before PA lymphadenectomy. Results: During the study period, among 142 patients with high-risk endometrial cancer, 35 patients (24.6%) underwent 18FDG PET-CT followed by PA lymphadenectomy. In 25% of cases, PA lymphadenectomy was not performed due to the discovery of metastasis. 18FDG PET-CT had a sensitivity of 50%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, a negative predictive value of 75%, accuracy of 80% and an area under the curve of 0.75 for the evaluation of PA involvement. Conclusion: According to its high specificity in PA lymph-node evaluation, a positive PET scan might allow PA lymphadenectomy to be avoided.",

        "text": "Endometrial cancer\n\nPET-CT\n\npara-aortic\n\nlymphadenectomy\n\nEndometrial cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women, with more than 8,000 cases per year in France (1). A knowledge of lymph-node status and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage is necessary to establish the most appropriate treatment strategy. The risk of lymph-node involvement is strongly correlated with the characteristics of the tumor, and depends on its histological type, grade, the degree of local extension (myometrium and cervical stroma), and the presence of lymphovascular space invasion (2). Since the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress of 2009 (3) and the publication of the French National Institute of Cancer (INCA) recommendations in 2010 (4), para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PAL) has been recommended for stage I tumors of histological type 1 (endometrioid adenocarcinoma) with a high risk of recurrence (stage IB and grade 3, or with the presence of lymphovascular space invasion, regardless of grade), for tumors of stage II and above, and for histological type 2 tumors (clear-cell carcinoma, papillary serous carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma) of all stages.\n\nPAL is a surgical procedure associated with non-negligible morbidity, particularly in elderly patients with associated comorbid conditions (5). Its therapeutic impact on survival is a matter of debate (6). Knowledge of pelvic and para-aortic (PA) lymph-node status guides therapeutic decisions, determining whether there are indications for more or less extensive radiotherapy and systemic treatment (7). The PORTEC-3 study showed that adjuvant chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy, was beneficial in stage III high-risk endometrial cancer (8).\n\n18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography integrated with computed tomography (18FDG PET-CT) is a non-invasive examination that can modify the management of endometrial cancer. It was cited in the 2016 INCA and ESMO guidelines as an option (3, 4). It is widely used in the management of locally advanced cervical cancer (9, 10). 18FDG PET-CT may help clinicians decide whether or not to perform lymphadenectomy in cases of endometrial cancer with an indication for PAL. Few studies have evaluated its potential utility for lymph-node staging in endometrial cancer.\n\nWe investigated the performance of 18FDG PET-CT for assessing PA involvement in high-risk type 1 and 2 endometrial cancer.\n\nFootnotes"
