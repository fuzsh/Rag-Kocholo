        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common urological cancers worldwide, and lymph node (LN) metastasis has a poor prognosis [1–3]. LN dissection (LND) is not only the best approach to diagnose LN metastasis (i.e., staging), but also an effective therapeutic option for many solid malignancies including other urologic cancers [2]. For RCC, the role of LND remains controversial. First, one randomized controlled trial (RCT) failed to show a significant overall survival (OS) difference between radical nephrectomy (RN) with LND compared to RN without LND for nonmetastatic RCC; the study, however, included many lower stage patients who rarely harbor LN metastasis (EORTC 30881) [4]. Next, the pattern of lymphatic drainage and metastasis of RCC is not clear yet [5,6]; Thus, the staging and therapeutic benefit of LND in RCC is unproven and the anatomical LND template is unclear due to missing accurate imaging tools. Over the last decades, the development of minimally surgical technologies further decreased the use of LND. Indeed, laparoscopic surgery made LND a complicated and stressful procedure for many. Although surgical robot system gradually replaced laparoscopic surgery in urologic field and it allowed surgeons to perform surgeries more feasibly, the evidence of LND for RCC patients is still sparse. On the other hand, the improvement in systemic therapy for advanced RCC using targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) seem to have also led to a decrease in the use of LND [7]. Indeed, several recent studies documented a gradual decline in the number of LNDs performed over the last years [8,9]. This has been accompanied by articles showing that the benefit of LND has decreased year by year [7,10].\n\nHowever, there is sufficient data emerging suggestion that we are currently underestimating the potential benefits of LND. Several studies demonstrated the benefit of LND in selected patients with unfavorable clinical features [11,12]. Additionally, pembrolizumab was demonstrated to be an effective adjuvant agent in patients with LN metastasis [13]. It further remains likely that LND with limited LN metastatic volume can be curative, or even delay disease progression. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on LND and its role in LN staging and prognostic value today.\n\nMETHODS\n\nFor this review, PubMed and Web of Science were thoroughly searched for articles published between January 2020 and December 2022. For some topics which we did not find sufficient articles in the most recent year, we extended the search duration to past years. Search terms included ‘renal cancer’ OR ‘kidney cancer’ in combination with terms ‘lymphadenectomy’ OR ‘lymph node dissection’ OR ’lymph node involvement’ OR ‘lymph node metastasis’ OR ‘lymphadenopathy’ AND ‘adjuvant therapy’ AND ‘robot-assisted’ AND ‘minimal invasive’. Unpublished studies, abstracts of oral presentations, and articles written in languages other than English were excluded. References cited in the selected full-text articles were also reviewed.\n\nEXTENT AND TEMPLATE OF LYMPH NODE DISSECTION\n\nThe extent and template of LND have not been clearly standardized [2,3]. According to a prospective study evaluating the lymphatic drainage pattern of renal tumor in vivo, lymphatic drainage exhibited individual variation [14]. Both the European Association of Urology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines do not indicate the template and recommend LND for patients only who have enlarged LNs detected on preoperative imaging and are abnormally enlarged on palpation during surgery. The incidence of LN metastasis is generally low when they are clinically negative on preoperative cross sectional high-quality imaging [15]. Recently, Kuusk et al. reported only rare case of cN0 patients to harbor pN1 after LND for cT1-4 RCC (43 of 4,370, 1%) [14].\n\nPreviously, a RCT have described the extent of LND [4], while all other studies included heterogeneous patients with diverse operation types including diverging LND templates [6,16–20] (Table 2). Typically, a LND for the right side includes all LNs from the adrenal vein to the aortic bifurcation, including the para- and precaval nodes. For the left side, the LND template includes the anatomic region from the crus of the diaphragm to the aortic bifurcation, including the para- and preaortal nodes (Fig. 1) [5]. By contrast, Nini et al. used a different template (Fig. 2) for pT3/4 patients and showed that side-specific (para-aorta for left side, and pre/post vena cava for right side) nodal metastasis was the most common (54%), followed by interaortocaval (26%), hilar (20%) [6]. Kuusk et al. reported in a retrospective validation study on the first synchronous LN metastatic sites at primary resection [21]. According to the study, some LN metastases were found beyond the previously described area: para-aortal on the right side (n = 1 of 41) and inter-aortocaval or para-caval on the left side (n = 6 of 33) [21].\n\nTable 2 - Studies published in the last two years comparing survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma with and without lymph node dissection.\n\nOnly one study described the extent of LND in the last two years. Tachibana et al. showed that a template LND provided a significantly better OS than a limited LND in 45 patients with 1 or 2 pathologically confirmed nodal metastases [22▪]. They resected a median of 18 LNs using the template with, six of 22 patients who underwent a limited LND experiencing retroperitoneal recurrence within the template of LND. These data suggested that a wider extent of LND is desirable when nodal metastases are suspected. Unfortunately, the extent of LND depended on the surgeon's discretion today or can be seen in published studies [6,16,18,20,22▪]. Therefore, high-quality research is needed to identify which template to use and when to use it.\n\nONCOLOGICAL EFFICACY OF LYMPH NODE DISSECTION\n\nThe recent studies comparing RN with versus without LND are summarized in Table 1. Six studies were included and two studies failed to show the association with OS. Bacic et al. reported an analysis of patients such as the ones in the EORTC 30881 trial using the National Cancer Database [23]. They developed a predictive model risk of LN metastasis in patients with cT1-4N0-1M0. When LND was defined as 6 or more LNs removed, the authors found no prognostic impact of LND on OS; they actually reported a small but statistically significant harm of LND on OS. However, patients who underwent LND had more unfavorable features (pT3 or pN1) than those without LND even after adjustment for pretreatment confounders using propensity score matching. This suggested a selection bias for LND which would explain the worse outcomes in this group. Kokorovic et al. showed that LND did not improve oncologic outcome and the number of removed LNs was not associated with OS [24].\n\nTable 1 - Extent of lymph node dissection in recent studies.\n\nBy contrast, four studies supported the benefit of LND on OS for higher T stage tumors. Wei et al. reported the survival of patients with RCC treated with RN and LND using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database [25]. The authors divided the cohort into two groups, with or without LND, according to the number of LNs removed (≥ 2 or < 2). After adjusting for the effects of baseline characteristics, they showed that the number of removed LN was significantly associated with better OS in patients with pT3 RCC. Conversely, they did not find out an OS benefit to performing a LND in patients with pT2, and LND was associated with worse cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with pT1. Laganosky et al. showed that the removal of at least ten LNs resulted in OS and CSS benefits in patients with T3b-T4 RCC, but it did not provide any survival benefit for those with T3a [26]. Zhuang et al. showed an OS benefit to LND in patients with high-risk localized RCC by using the SEER database and prolonged median all-survival time of 2.6 months when compared with RN alone [11]. In the later study, high-risk patients were defined as those with two or more of factors of the previously mentioned and excluded Mx or M1 patients. LND was defined as ≥ 3 LN removed. Xiao et al. showed LND was associated with good OS for the patients with intravenous tumor thrombus [12].\n\nIn general, to be of high-risk requires one or more of those factors: Fuhrman grade 3–4, tumor size > 10 cm, pathological T3-4, sarcomatoid component, and coagulative tumor necrosis [27,28]. In a RCT that assessed targeted therapy versus placebo after RN for nonmetastatic RCC with high-grade pT1bN0 or any T/N1 failed to demonstrate an OS benefit to LND [29].\n\nOn the other hand, during cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) for metastatic RCC, LND has not shown improvement in patient survival [2]. One propensity score matched study analyzed 305 metastatic RCC patients who underwent CN, including188 patients who underwent LND. The study showed that LND was not associated with improved cancer specific mortality (HR 1.14, 95%CI 0.86 to 1.51, P = 0.38) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.87 to 1.53, P = 0.31) after matching [30]. In contrast, Capitanio et al. showed that the higher number of LNs removed during RN prolonged OS in 44 patients with pT4 RCC patients with or without distant metastasis [16]. In summary, LND might provide benefit on OS to the nonmetastatic RCC patients with high risk factors, such as large sized tumor or unfavorable pathological features.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SURGICAL APPROACHES OF LYMPH NODE DISSECTION\n\nThe extent of LNDs is reported to be associated with an increased risk of intra- and postoperative complications [22▪]; LND for RCC patients required the dissection around the major vessels with the risk of bleeding, and other concern is a higher risk of chylous ascites [31]. There are only few studies assessing complications after LND [31]; however, Tachibana et al. reported that operation time, perioperative morbidity, and length of hospitalization were comparable between extended and limited LND. Postoperative complications were, however, more common in the limited LND group [22▪]. On the contrary, Xiao et al. showed that postoperative complications were two-fold higher in RCC patients who have venous thrombus who undergo LND compared with those who did not undergo LND [12]. A RCT showed that patients with LND had a higher rate of blood loss (> 1 L), embolism, and lymph fluid drainage; however, these differences were all lower in grade and manageable [4].\n\nIn two decades, laparoscopic RN has been established itself as the standard surgical approach for clinically nonmetastatic RCC. However, the development of laparoscopic surgery has made LND challenging due to its technical difficulty [32], leading to a decrease or even disappearance of LND. Recently, robot-assisted surgeries have been replacing laparoscopy in the field of urology. For clinically nonmetastatic RCC, surgical robotic systems allow surgeons to perform more complicated operations than laparoscopic surgery, for example in case of complex partial nephrectomies. As a result, more RCC patients undergo robot-assisted surgery today [33]. To date, there have been few reports on RN with LND using the surgical robot systems. Crocerossa et al. conducted a meta-analysis comparing the perioperative complications between robot-assisted radical nephrectomy (RARN), open or LRN [34▪▪]. According to the study, RARN was superior to open RN with all regards but not different from LRN.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the feasibility of LND using robotic procedures. Abaza et al. removed a mean of 13.9 nodes in 36 RCC patients with a mean operation time of 31 min, without severe complications. Moreover, it showed that the learning curve is shorter using robot-assisted surgery compared to open RN [35]. Rose et al. showed that robot-assisted surgery yielded more LNs removal than open RN (6.9 vs. 2.6, P = 0.02) [36]. One retrospective study also showed that robot-assisted surgery was preferable to laparoscopic surgery when performing LND (24.2% vs. 12.6%, P = 0.031) [37]. On the other hands, the cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted surgery seems inferior to laparoscopic surgery without providing a clear superiority in complication rates [33,34▪▪].\n\nTHE ROLE OF ADJUVANT THERAPY FOLLOWING LYMPH NODE DISSECTION\n\nMost pN1 patients experience disease progression to metastatic disease within two years after surgery with the 5-year survival of pTanyN1M0 being less than 30% [38,39]. Xiao et al. reported the efficacy of LND for RCC patients with a tumor venous thrombus, with or without cN1 and cM1 [12]. Tumor venous thrombus is staged to be at least T3 and provides poor prognosis [3]. In the study, pN1 status after complete resection of the primary site was an independent prognostic predictor in multivariable analysis compared with pN0 and pNx (without LND). Moreover, there were no differences in OS between patients with pN0-xM1 and pN1M0. Yang et al. also demonstrated that patients with pN1M0 status was significantly associated with early distant metastasis compared to patients with pN0 status after adjusting the effects of tumor histological subtypes [40].\n\nAccording to the last AJCC classification, cT1-3N1 RCC is categorized as stage III disease. However, several recent studies have considered N1 patients to be equal in prognosis as M1 and suggested to re-classify them to stage IV disease. Srivastava et al. analyzed 8988 patients with RCC who underwent RN and retroperitoneal LND and showed that pN1 stage III disease was inferior to pN0 stage III and was similar to stage IV disease with respect to OS [41]. Similarly, several studies have also shown that stage III disease patients had similar survival estimates, such as OS and CSS than stage IV patients [42,43].\n\nPatients with a high risk of recurrence, including those with pN1, should be considered for adjuvant therapy and LND remains most accurate approach to detect LN metastasis. The benefits of adjuvant therapy after radical surgery have not been demonstrated for a long time. Regarding targeted therapies, sunitinib improved survival in high-risk RCC patients after RN [44]. In contrast, other studies failed to show any benefit to adjuvant targeted therapy in high-risk RCC patients after surgery including those who harbored nodal metastasis [45,46]. As for ICI, a phase 3 trial (IMmotion101 trial) failed to demonstrate the superiority of atezolizumab over placebo after nephrectomy and/or metastasectomy in patients with pathologically confirmed advanced RCC, including approximately 20% of patients with T3b and pN1 [47]. Pembrolizumab, in contrast, has been approved based on the results of the KEYNOTE 564 trial, or the only drug demonstrating efficacy in the adjuvant setting for RCC (disease-free survival at 24 months; pembrolizumab 77.3% vs. placebo 68.1%), despite lack of the information regarding the template or the number of the resected LN [13]. Patients with M1 or N1 (6% and 6% of the entire cohort, respectively) who obtained no evidence of disease after complete resection were included in this trial, and pembrolizumab retained superiority over placebo in this subgroup, although the number was small. OS in either group has not yet been reached (hazard ratio for death: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.31–0.86).\n\nFor locally advanced disease including regional LN metastasis, neoadjuvant systemic therapy hold potential to improve the surgical outcomes. However, the evidence of neoadjuvant therapy for metastatic RCC is still sparse in the era of ICIs. Ongoing clinical trials may reveal the timing of operation and the efficacy of neoadjuvant setting systemic therapies, and they may also provide the suitable strategies including LND [48].\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLND for RCC has been decreasing over the last decades for the reason that one RCT demonstrated no superiority of the LND for localized RCC. Patients with high-risk factors such as larger tumor or higher T stage disease may derive a benefit from a LND during radical surgery for pathological LN staging, however, it was based on nonrandomized studies therefore the results should be interpreted cautiously. Patients with LN metastasis have poor prognosis and may benefit from adjuvant Pembrolizumab based on a RCT. The advent of an effective adjuvant systemic therapy makes performing a LND in high-risk patients of value. This together with the advent of robot assisted surgery are likely to lead to a higher rate of LNDs being performed now. A precise imaging technology that would help identify LN metastasis with high accuracy is needed to make LND of high value to the clinical case.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nNone.\n\nFinancial support and sponsorship\n\nNone.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflict of interest.\n\nREFERENCES AND RECOMMENDED READING\n\nPapers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:\n\n▪ of special interest\n\n▪▪ of outstanding interest\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
