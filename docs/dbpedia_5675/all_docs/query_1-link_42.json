        "text": "How is the stage determined?\n\nTests used to gather information for staging can include:\n\nPhysical exams\n\nBiopsies of enlarged lymph nodes or other abnormal areas\n\nBlood tests\n\nImaging tests, such as PET and CT scans\n\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy (often but not always done)\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap – not always done)\n\nIn general, the results of imaging tests such as PET or CT scans are the most important when determining the stage of the lymphoma.\n\nLugano classification\n\nA staging system is a way for members of a cancer care team to sum up the extent of a cancer’s spread. The current staging system for NHL in adults is known as the Lugano classification, which is a modified version of the older Ann Arbor system.\n\nThe stages are described by Roman numerals I through IV (1-4). Limited stage (I or II) lymphomas that affect an organ outside the lymph system (an extranodal organ) have an E added (for example, stage IIE).\n\nStage I\n\nEither of the following means the disease is stage I:\n\nThe lymphoma is in only 1 lymph node area or lymphoid organ such as the tonsils (I).\n\nThe cancer is found only in 1 area of a single organ outside of the lymph system (IE).\n\nStage II\n\nEither of the following means the disease is stage II:\n\nThe lymphoma is in 2 or more groups of lymph nodes on the same side of (above or below) the diaphragm (the thin band of muscle that separates the chest and abdomen). For example, this might include nodes in the underarm and neck area but not the combination of underarm and groin nodes (which would be stage III).\n\nThe lymphoma is in a group of lymph node(s) and in one area of a nearby organ (IIE). It may also affect other groups of lymph nodes on the same side of the diaphragm.\n\nStage III\n\nEither of the following means the disease is stage III:\n\nThe lymphoma is in lymph node areas on both sides of (above and below) the diaphragm.\n\nThe lymphoma is in lymph nodes above the diaphragm, as well as in the spleen.\n\nStage IV\n\nThe lymphoma has spread widely into at least one organ outside the lymph system, such as the bone marrow, liver, or lung.\n\nBulky disease\n\nThis term is often used to describe large tumors in the chest. It is especially important for stage II lymphomas, as bulky disease might need more intensive treatment.\n\nStaging small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)\n\nThe system above is most often used to stage SLL if it is only in lymph nodes. But if the disease is in the blood or bone marrow, it is often staged using the systems for CLL. See Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Stages.\n\nHow staging might affect treatment\n\nThe stage of a lymphoma is important when determining a person’s treatment options, but it is more important for some types of lymphoma than for others. For many of the more common types of NHL, treatment is based in part on whether the lymphoma is “limited” (stage I or stage II non-bulky) or “advanced” (stage III or IV). For stage II bulky lymphomas, certain other factors (known as prognostic factors) are used to help determine if the lymphoma should be treated as limited or advanced.\n\nFor some other types of NHL, such as fast-growing lymphomas like Burkitt lymphoma, the stage is less important when deciding on treatment."
