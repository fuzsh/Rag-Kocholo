        "text": "Description\n\nAbdominal lymph nodes are generally organized along the blood vessels within the abdominal cavity. These can be categorized into parietal and visceral abdominal lymph nodes.\n\nParietal abdominal lymph nodes receive lymph from the lower limb through the common iliac lymph nodes. They are arranged as three chains: the left lumbar lymph nodes surrounding the aorta, the right lumbar lymph nodes surrounding the inferior vena cava and the intermediate lumbar lymph nodes between the two blood vessels. In addition, inferior diaphragmatic and inferior epigastric lymph nodes form part of the parietal abdominal lymph nodes.\n\nVisceral abdominal lymph nodes receive lymph from the abdominal organs. Lymph is collected and returned to either the celiac, superior mesenteric or inferior mesenteric lymph nodes."
