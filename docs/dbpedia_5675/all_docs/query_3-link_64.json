        "text": "Pulmonary Lymph and Lymphatics\n\nWaldemar L. Olszewski in Lymph Stasis: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Treatment, 2019\n\nThe question of where the lymph capillaries in the lung tissue begin was not easy to answer until the development of the electron microscope.28 It was felt that there were no lymph capillaries in the alveolar wall.23,29 Serial electron microscopic studies suggest that the alveolar wall does not have its own lymph capillary network, but lymph capillaries extend to the respiratory bronchioles and into the septi between alveolae.30 The course of the efferent lymph vessels is directed to the right duct and the upper left lung drains into the thoracic duct.31 There is evidence that some lymph vessels of the lower pulmonary lobes pass through the diaphragm to terminate in the abdominal viscera or periaortic lymph nodes.32\n\nThe Large Bowel and the Anal Canal\n\nE. George Elias in CRC Handbook of Surgical Oncology, 2020\n\nThis classification was then adopted for all large bowel cancer. Since then, several modifications have been applied and are expressed in Figure 1. These include Kirklin in 1948 who divided Dukes A to A and B1 with: A = tumor invading down to muscularis and B1 = through the muscularis but not through the bowel wall. Kirklin et al.38 maintained Dukes B but named it B2. In 1954, Astler and Coller39 split Dukes C to C1 and C2, with C1 = B1 lesion + involved regional LN, and C2 = B2 lesion + involved regional LN. In 1958, Dukes and Bussey40 reclassified C to C1 and C2 with C1 indicating involvement of pericolic lymph nodes and C2 involvement of lymph nodes at the highest point of ligation of the vascular bundle, regardless to the depth of invasion at the primary site. Involvement of lymph nodes beyond this point (C2) indicates distant metastases. Patients who are found to have Dukes C2 may have early distant metastases unless the periaortic lymph nodes are sampled. When Dukes D was added indicating distant metastases, no differentiation was made between direct tumor invasion to another organ from distant systemic metastases.\n\nMerits and complexities of modeling multiple sclerosis in non-human primates: implications for drug discovery\n\nPublished in Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery, 2018\n\nBert A. ‘t Hart, Jon D. Laman, Yolanda S. Kap\n\nThere is a plausible alternative concept, according to which the cause of autoimmunity in MS lies inside the CNS, namely the formation of a primary lesion from which self-antigens are released [37]. Indeed, several studies indicate microglia aggregates a.k.a. microglia nodules in the white matter as the earliest histological manifestation of a lesion [53]. Such microglia nodules are associated with axonal degeneration [54], which is a pathological hallmark of progressive MS. Such observations indicate that the classical ‘outside-in’ concept of MS may need to be reformulated, as the basis of MS may be progressive degenerative pathology and that relapses may be induced by hyper-reaction of the immune system against released self-antigens [37,55]. Conceptually, the immune hyper-reactivity is caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors, infection in particular [37]. Data obtained in EAE mice, EAE marmosets, and MS patients show that the released self-antigens may be captured by APC in CNS draining cervical and lumbar lymph nodes where immune activation can take place [56,57]. Indeed, surgical removal of these lymph nodes from Biozzi ABH mice impairs the chronic relapsing EAE course induced with myelin/CFA [58].\n\nEngineering polymeric nanocapsules for an efficient drainage and biodistribution in the lymphatic system\n\nPublished in Journal of Drug Targeting, 2019\n\nAna Sara Cordeiro, José Crecente-Campo, Belén L. Bouzo, Santiago F. González, María de la Fuente, María José Alonso\n\nWhen analysing the lumbar lymph nodes, at the same time point, we observed a statistically significant higher accumulation of polyarginine and carboxymethyl-β-glucan NCs than of CS NCs (Figure 7(d,e)). These results may indicate that, besides the surface charge each polymer confers to the nanocarrier, the intrinsic specificities of the polymer used could also play a role in this process. On one hand, polyarginine NCs were found to drain well through the draining lymph node chain and to accumulate strongly in both lymph nodes under study. The efficient internalisation of polyarginine by immune cells has been previously described, and found to be higher than that of other polycationic polymers, which could explain these positive results [82,83]. On the other hand, carboxymethyl-β-glucan NCs, which seem to accumulate at lower levels in the popliteal lymph node, eventually accumulated in the following node, at similar levels than those observed for polyarginine NCs. It is possible that anionic NCs drain along the lymphatics under the pressure of lymph flow, instead of remaining stuck in the first draining lymph node. Comparative studies that might help explain this behaviour are still lacking in the literature. However, in the absence of these reports, we can speculate that the affinity of some APCs receptors for these polymers may lead to their increased accumulation in the lymph nodes more distant from the injection site. Similarly, other beta glucans in particulate forms have shown fast drainage to the lymph nodes upon injection in mice and specific co-localization with macrophages within those lymph nodes [84–86].\n\nIpilimumab: an investigational immunotherapy for glioblastoma\n\nPublished in Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, 2020\n\nGilbert Youssef, Jorg Dietrich\n\nThe central nervous system (CNS) has traditionally been thought to be an immune-privileged organ, based on unique features of the blood-brain barrier, absence of lymphatic drainage system, and its paucity of immune cells [10–12]. However, there is increasing evidence that the CNS has a delicate lymphatic system draining into cervical and lumbar lymph nodes [13,14], and that immune cells play an important role in the pathophysiology of various auto-immune, inflammatory, and degenerative neurological diseases [15–17]. Furthermore, microglia act as the main effector cells of the immune system in the CNS, and are able to induce cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, and T cell activation, through antigen presentation, directed against any offending particles [18]. However, the brain parenchyma remains immunosuppressive in nature, and the normal immune responses are shifted towards a type 2 CD4+ TH response, leading collectively to a suppressed cell-mediated immunity [19]. Moreover, malignant gliomas have various immunosuppressive properties characterized by the recruitment of immunosuppressive T regulatory cells (Treg) and expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines [20–23]. Although tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can be found in the perivascular areas and within the tumor tissue [24], they are usually inhibited by the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME). In fact, the T-cell responses are regulated by co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals. The latter restrict or reverse the stimulation of T cells, are termed checkpoint inhibitors and are abundant in the TME [25–27], allowing GBM to escape attacks from the immune system. The two main immune checkpoints involved in immunosuppression are programmed cell-death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4). Both are expressed on the cell surface, and deliver self-inhibitory signals to effector T cells, while CTLA-4 is also expressed on Treg, further inhibiting effector T cells in a cell-extrinsic pathway [28,29]. They act in a non-redundant, serial manner [30,31]. CTLA-4 is expressed by all T cells [32], and is usually upregulated on Treg during an inflammatory process [33,34]. It is homologous to CD28, a co-stimulatory signal that activates effector T cells by binding to CD80 and CD86 receptors and has a significantly higher affinity than CD28 to these receptors [32,33]. While CD28 activates T cells, CTLA-4 reverses this early activation and inhibits further T cell stimulation and expansion [32,34]. On the other hand, PD-1 alters the motility and metabolism of already activated T cells [25]."
