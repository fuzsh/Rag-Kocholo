        "text": "Mesenteric lymphadenitis is an inflammation of lymph nodes. The lymph nodes that become inflamed are in a membrane that attaches the intestine to the lower right region of the abdominal wall.\n\nThese lymph nodes are among the hundreds that help your body fight disease. They trap and destroy microscopic \"invaders\" like viruses or bacteria.\n\nMesenteric lymphadenitis causes abdominal pain. It usually doesnât occur in adults or people over age 20.\n\nMesenteric Lymphadenitis Causes\n\nSometimes doctors can't tell the cause of mesenteric lymphadenitis. But the most common cause is infection,Â such as a viral or bacterial stomach bug.\n\nInflammatory conditions may also be linked with mesenteric lymphadenitis.\n\nInfections that cause mesenteric lymphadenitis may be located in one place (local) or throughout the body (systemic). The infections may be caused by:\n\nViruses\n\nBacteria\n\nParasites\n\nCommon infections that cause mesenteric lymphadenitis include:\n\nGastroenteritis. This may result from viral infections such as rotavirus or norovirus. It may also result from bacterial infections such as salmonella, staphylococcus, or streptococcus. Gastroenteritis is often misnamed stomach flu.\n\nYersinia enterocolitica. This is the most common cause of mesenteric lymphadenitis in children. This bacteria, found in undercooked meat, can cause gastroenteritis and other problems. It may resemble Crohn's disease or acute appendicitis.\n\nOther infections that cause mesenteric lymphadenitis include:\n\nDirect or indirect infections related to HIV. This is the virus that can lead to AIDS.\n\nTuberculosis. This is a bacterial infection that usually attacks the lungs. But it can also attack other parts of the body.\n\nAcute terminal ileitis. This is an inflammation of the end of the small intestine. It may be due to a bacterium or Crohnâs disease.\n\nInflammatory conditions commonly linked to mesenteric lymphadenitis are:\n\nAppendicitis, inflammation of the appendix\n\nInflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis\n\nConnective tissue diseases such as lupus, sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis\n\nDiverticulitis, inflammation of the lining of the large intestine, and pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas, are less common causes.\n\nÂ\n\nMesenteric Lymphadenitis Signs and Symptoms\n\nWith mesenteric lymphadenitis, an upper respiratory tract infection may occur right before any other symptoms appear. This may cause symptoms such as a sore throat.\n\nSymptoms of mesenteric lymphadenitis range in severity. They include:\n\nTenderness or pain, often in the center or lower right side of the abdomen\n\nHigh fever\n\nMesenteric lymphadenitis often causes symptoms in the lower right abdomen. So people often mistake it for appendicitis.\n\nYou may have other signs and symptoms as well. This depends upon the cause of the inflammation. Signs and symptoms include:\n\nFeeling ill\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nFatigue or lack of energy\n\nRaised white blood cell count\n\nNausea, vomiting, or diarrhea\n\nÂ\n\nWhen Should You Call the Doctor?\n\nCall your doctor right away if you or your child has severe or sudden abdominal pain. Also call if it occurs along with other symptoms such as those listed above. Describe to your doctor the severity and location of the pain, as well as what makes it worse. Be prepared to discuss any other symptoms you or your child has had.\n\nMesenteric Lymphadenitis Diagnosis\n\nSometimes mesenteric lymphadenitis causes no symptoms. The doctor may simply spot it while doing imaging tests for some other problem.\n\nSometimes symptoms of mesenteric lymphadenitis may lead you to go to see a doctor. The doctor will ask about these symptoms and take a thorough medical history. They may also do some tests.\n\nBlood tests may help spot an infection. Urine tests may help rule out a urinary tract infection. An abdominal ultrasound or CT scan can help rule out other causes of symptoms.\n\nMany conditions are linked to mesenteric lymphadenitis -- some serious, others not. So you can see why a diagnosis is so important.\n\nMesenteric Lymphadenitis Treatment\n\nMesenteric lymphadenitis often gets better without treatment in 1-4 weeks. Still, you may need medicine to reduce a fever or control pain. Rest, fluids, and warm heat applied to the abdomen may also help relieve symptoms.\n\nYou may need treatment for the cause of the inflammation. Antibiotics can prevent complications from a severe bacterial infection (septicemia), which can cause death.\n\nThe condition doesnât cause any lasting effects after recovery."
