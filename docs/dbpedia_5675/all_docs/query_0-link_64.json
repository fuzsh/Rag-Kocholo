        "text": "Anatomic Distribution of Fluorodeoxyglucose-Avid Para-aortic Lymph Nodes in Patients With Cervical Cancer\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTakiar, Vinita; Fontanilla, Hiral P.; Eifel, Patricia J.\n\nPurpose: Conformal treatment of para-aortic lymph nodes (PAN) in cervical cancer allows dose escalation and reduces normal tissue toxicity. Currently, data documenting the precise location of involved PAN are lacking. We define the spatial distribution of this high-risk nodal volume by analyzing fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymph nodes (LNs) on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans in patients with cervical cancer. Methods and Materials: We identified 72 PANs on pretreatment PET/CT of 30 patients with newly diagnosed stage IB-IVA cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation. LNs were classified as left-lateral para-aortic (LPA), aortocaval (AC), or right paracaval (RPC). Distances from the LNmoreÂ Â» center to the closest vessel and adjacent vertebral body were calculated. Using deformable image registration, nodes were mapped to a template computed tomogram to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution. Results: We identified 72 PET-positive para-aortic lymph nodes (37 LPA, 32 AC, 3 RPC). All RPC lymph nodes were in the inferior third of the para-aortic region. The mean distance from aorta for all lymph nodes was 8.3 mm (range, 3-17 mm), and from the inferior vena cava was 5.6 mm (range, 2-10 mm). Of the 72 lymph nodes, 60% were in the inferior third, 36% were in the middle third, and 4% were in the upper third of the para-aortic region. In all, 29 of 30 patients also had FDG-avid pelvic lymph nodes. Conclusions: A total of 96% of PET positive nodes were adjacent to the aorta; PET positive nodes to the right of the IVC were rare and were all located distally, within 3 cm of the aortic bifurcation. Our findings suggest that circumferential margins around the vessels do not accurately define the nodal region at risk. Instead, the anatomical extent of the nodal basin should be contoured on each axial image to provide optimal coverage of the para-aortic nodal compartment.Â«Â less\n\nAssociation between expression of MMP-7 and MMP-9 and pelvic lymph node and para-aortic lymph node metastasis in early cervical cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Hui; Dai, Yifei; Wang, Anna; Wang, Chunyan; Sun, Lili; Wang, Zheng\n\n2018-05-16\n\nTo investigate the association of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 and MMP-9 with pelvic lymph node and para-aortic lymph node metastasis in early cervical cancer. A total of 137 patients with early cervical cancer (Stage Ia2-IIa2) were recruited from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tumor Hospital of Liaoning Province from January 2009 to May 2014. We evaluated the expression of MMP-7 and MMP-9 by immunohistochemistry and their association with the clinicopathological parameters such as pelvic, common iliac and para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Spearman correlation was performed to analyze the correlation between MMP-7 and MMP-9 in cervical cancer. Finally, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of MMP-7 and MMP-9 in pelvic lymph node metastasis were assessed. MMP-7 expression was significantly higher in patients with adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas (Pâ=â0.014), vascular cancer embolus (Pâ=â0.041), pelvic lymph node metastasis (Pâ=â0.000) and a higher level of Ki-67 (Pâ=â0.000). MMP-9 expression was significantly associated with vascular cancer embolus (Pâ=â0.003), depth of stromal invasion (Pâ=â0.001), pelvic lymph node metastasis (Pâ=â0.003), common iliac lymph node metastasis (Pâ=â0.001) and para-aortic lymph nodes metastasis (Pâ=â0.004). Coexpression of MMP-7 and MMP-9 was significantly associated with vascular cancer embolus (Pâ< 0.001), higher expression of Ki-67 (Pâ<â0.001) and pelvic lymph node metastasis (Pâ<â0.001). Spearman correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between MMP-7 and MMP-9 (râ=â0.263, Pâ=â0.002). Areas under the ROC of MMP-7 and MMP-9 were 0.707 and 0.646, respectively. MMP-7 and MMP-9 expressions were associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with early cervical cancers, suggesting a positive correlation of MMP-7 and MMP-9 with invasive potential in early cervical cancers.

With diagnosis of rectal cancer, cSS, cN0, cH0, cP0, cM0 cStage II, Hartmann's operation with D3 lymph node dissection was performed and a para-aortic lymph node and a disseminated node near the primary tumor were resected. Histological examination showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, pSS, pN3, pH0, pP1, pM1 (para-aortic lymph node, dissemination) fStage IV. After the operation, the patient received chemotherapy with FOLFIRI regimen. After 12 cycles of FOLFIRI regimen, computed tomography (CT) detected an 11 mm of liver metastasis in the postero-inferior segment of right hepatic lobe. With diagnosis of liver metastatic recurrence, we performed partial hepatectomy. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma as a metastatic rectal cancer with cut end microscopically positive. After the second operation, the patient received chemotherapy with TS1 alone for 2 years. Ten months after the break, CT detected a 20 mm of para-aortic lymph node metastasis and a 10 mm of lymph node metastasis at the hepato-duodenal ligament. With diagnosis of lymph node metastatic recurrences, we performed lymph node dissection. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma as metastatic rectal cancer in para-aortic and hepato-duodenal ligament areas. After the third operation, we started chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 regimen. After 2 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 regimen, due to the onset of neutropenia and liver dysfunction, we switched to capecitabine alone and continued it for 6 mo and then stopped. Eleven months after the break, CT detected two swelling 12 mm of lymph nodes at the left supraclavicular region. With diagnosis of Virchow lymph node metastatic recurrence, we started chemotherapy with capecitabine plus bevacizumab regimen. Due to the onset of neutropenia and hand foot syndrome (Grade 3), we managed to\n\nA novel dynamic field-matching technique for treatment of patients with para-aortic node-positive cervical cancer: Clinical experience\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaden, Craig; Whitley, Alexander; LÃ³pez-Araujo, Javier; Popple, Richard; Duan, Jun; Kim, Robert\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim To report outcomes for patients with para-aortic lymph node positive cervical cancer treated with a dynamic field-matching technique. Background PET staging of cervical cancer has increased identification of patients with para-aortic lymph node metastasis. IMRT enables dose escalation in this area, but matching IMRT fields with traditional whole pelvis fields presents a challenge. Materials and methods From 2003 to 2012, 20 patients with cervical cancer and para-aortic lymph node metastasis were treated utilizing the dynamic field-matching technique. As opposed to single-isocenter half-beam junction techniques, this technique employs wedge-shaped dose junctions for the abutment of fields. We reviewed the records of all patients who completed treatment with the technique and abstracted treatment, toxicity, and disease-related outcome data for analysis. Results Median prescribed dose to the whole pelvis field was 45Â Gy and para-aortic IMRT field 50.4Â Gy. All but 3 patients underwent HDR (13 pts) or LDR (4 pts) brachytherapy. All patients developed lower GI toxicity; 10 grade 1, 9 grade 2, and 1 grade 4 (enterovaginal fistula). Median DFS was 12.4 months with 1 and 2-year DFS 60.0% and 38.1%. One-year OS was 83.7% and 2-year OS, 64.4%. A total of 10 patients developed recurrence; none occurred at the matched junction. Conclusions The dynamic field-matching technique provides a means for joining conventional whole pelvis fields and para-aortic IMRT fields that substantially reduces dose deviations at the junction due to field mismatch. Treatment with the dynamic matching technique is simple, effective, and tolerated with no apparent increase in toxicity.

Data of consecutive patients undergoing staging for early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer were retrospectively evaluated. Logistic regression and a nomogram-based analysis were used to assess the risk of lymph node involvement. Overall, 290 patients were included. All patients had lymph node dissection including pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Forty-two (14.5%) patients were upstaged due to lymph node metastatic disease. Pelvic and para-aortic nodal metastases were observed in 22 (7.6%) and 42 (14.5%) patients. Lymph node involvement was observed in 18/95 (18.9%), 1/37 (2.7%), 4/29 (13.8%), 11/63 (17.4%), 3/41 (7.3%) and 5/24 (20.8%) patients with high-grade serous, low-grade-serous, endometrioid G1, endometrioid G2&3, clear cell and undifferentiated, histology, respectively (p=0.12, Chi-square test). We observed that high-grade serous histology was associated with an increased risk of pelvic node involvement; while, histology rather than low-grade serous and bilateral tumors were independently associated with para-aortic lymph node involvement (p<0.05). Nomograms displaying the risk of nodal involvement in the pelvic and para-aortic areas were built. High-grade serous histology and bilateral tumors are the main characteristics suggesting lymph node positivity. Our data suggested that high-grade serous and bilateral early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer are at high risk of having disease harboring in the lymphatic tissues of both pelvic and para-aortic area. After receiving external validation, our data will help to identify patients deserving comprehensive retroperitoneal staging. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Approximately, nine of every ten (87%) take place in developing countries. When a macroscopic nodal involvement is discovered during a radical hysterectomy (RH), there is controversy in the literature between resect macroscopic lymph node compromise or abandonment of the surgery and sending the patient for standard chemo-radiotherapy treatment. The objective of this study is to compare the prognosis of patients with CC whom RH was abandoned and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed with that of patients who were only biopsied or with removal of a suspicious lymph node, treated with concomitant radiotherapy/chemotherapy in the standard manner. A descriptive and retrospective study was conducted in two institutions from Mexico and Colombia. Clinical records of patients with early-stage CC programmed for RH with an intraoperative finding of pelvic lymph, para-aortic nodes, or any extracervical involvement that contraindicates the continuation of surgery were obtained. Between January 2007 and December 2012, 42 clinical patients complied with study inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis. In patients with CC whom RH was abandoned due to lymph node affectation, there is no difference in overall survival or in disease-free period between systematic lymphadenectomy and tumor removal or lymph node biopsy, in pelvic lymph nodes as well as in para-aortic lymph nodes, when these patients receive adjuvant treatment with concomitant radiotherapy/chemotherapy. This is a hypothesis-generator study; thus, the recommendation is made to conduct randomized prospective studies to procure better knowledge on the impact of bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy on this group of patients.\n\nTracer injection sites and combinations for sentinel lymph node detection in patients with endometrial cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nNiikura, Hitoshi; Kaiho-Sakuma, Michiko; Tokunaga, Hideki; Toyoshima, Masafumi; Utsunomiya, Hiroki; Nagase, Satoru; Takano, Tadao; Watanabe, Mika; Ito, Kiyoshi; Yaegashi, Nobuo\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to clarify the most effective combination of injected tracer types and injection sites in order to detect sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in early endometrial cancer. The study included 100 consecutive patients with endometrial cancer treated at Tohoku University Hospital between June 2001 and December 2012. The procedure for SLN identification entailed either radioisotope (RI) injection into the endometrium during hysteroscopy (55 cases) or direct RI injection into the uterine cervix (45 cases). A combination of blue dye injected into the uterine cervix or uterine body intraoperatively in addition to preoperative RI injection occurred in 69 of 100 cases. All detected SLNs were recorded according to the individual tracer and the resultant staging from this method was compared to the final pathology of lymph node metastases including para-aortic nodes. SLN detection rate was highest (96%) by cervical RI injection; however, no SLNs were detected in para-aortic area. Para-aortic SLNs were detected only by hysteroscopic RI injection (56%). All cases with pelvic lymph node metastases were detected by pelvic SLN biopsy. Isolated positive para-aortic lymph nodes were detected in 3 patients. Bilateral SLN detection rate was high (96%; 26 of 27 cases) by cervical RI injection combined with dye. RI injection into the uterine cervix is highly sensitive in detection of SLN metastasis in early stage endometrial cancer. It is a useful and safe modality when combined with blue dye injection into the uterine body.

We investigated the clinical dose response threshold for pelvic and para-aortic lymph node boost using radiographic imaging and clinical outcomes. Methods and Materials: Between 2007 and 2011, 68 patients were treated for locally advanced cervical cancer; 40 patients had clinically involved pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes. Computed tomography (CT) or 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans obtained pre- and postchemoradiation for 18 patients were reviewed to assess therapeutic radiographic response of individual lymph nodes. External beam boost doses to involved nodes were compared to treatment response,moreÂ Â» assessed by change in size of lymph nodes by short axis and change in standard uptake value (SUV). Patterns of failure, time to recurrence, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were determined. Results: Sixty-four lymph nodes suspicious for metastatic involvement were identified. Radiation boost doses ranged from 0 to 15 Gy, with a mean total dose of 52.3 Gy. Pelvic lymph nodes were treated with a slightly higher dose than para-aortic lymph nodes: mean 55.3 Gy versus 51.7 Gy, respectively. There was no correlation between dose delivered and change in size of lymph nodes along the short axis. All lymph nodes underwent a decrease in SUV with a complete resolution of abnormal uptake observed in 68%. Decrease in SUV was significantly greater for lymph nodes treated with â¥54 Gy compared to those treated with <54 Gy (P=.006). Median follow-up was 18.7 months. At 2 years, OS and DFS for the entire cohort were 78% and 50%, respectively. Locoregional control at 2 years was 84%. Conclusions: A biologic response, as measured by the change in SUV for metastatic lymph nodes, was observed at a dose threshold of 54 Gy. We recommend that involved lymph nodes be treated to this minimum dose.Â«Â less\n\nIntensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for the Treatment of Squamous Cell Anal Cancer With Para-aortic Nodal Involvement\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHodges, Joseph C.; Das, Prajnan, E-mail: PrajDas@mdanderson.or; Eng, Cathy\n\n2009-11-01\n\nPurpose: To determine the rates of toxicity, locoregional control, distant control, and survival in anal cancer patients with para-aortic nodal involvement, treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemotherapy at a single institution. Methods and Materials: Between 2001 and 2007, 6 patients with squamous cell anal cancer and para-aortic nodal involvement were treated with IMRT and concurrent infusional 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. The primary tumor was treated with a median dose of 57.5 Gy (range, 54-60 Gy), involved para-aortic, pelvic, and inguinal lymph nodes were treated with a median dose of 55 Gy (range, 50.5-55 Gy), and noninvolved nodal regions weremoreÂ Â» treated with a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 43.5-45 Gy). Results: After a median follow-up of 25 months, none of the patients had a recurrence at the primary tumor, pelvic/inguinal nodes, or para-aortic nodes, whereas 2 patients developed distant metastases to the liver. Four of the 6 patients are alive. The 3-year actuarial locoregional control, distant control, and overall survival rates were 100%, 56%, and 63%, respectively. Four of the 6 patients developed Grade 3 acute gastrointestinal toxicity during chemoradiation. Conclusions: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy could potentially serve as definitive therapy in anal cancer patients with para-aortic nodal involvement. Adjuvant chemotherapy may be indicated in these patients, as demonstrated by the distant failure rates. These patients need to be followed carefully because of the potential for treatment-related toxicities.Â«Â less\n\nMinute perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) nests in the abdominal lymph nodes--a putative precursor of PEComa.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagasaka, Toru; Murakami, Yoshiko; Sasaki, Eiichi; Hosoda, Waki; Nakanishi, Toru; Yatabe, Yasushi\n\n2015-04-01\n\nA perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) is a peculiar growth defined as a mesenchymal tumor composed of histologically and immunohistochemically distinct perivascular epithelioid cells (PECs). Because neither normal counterparts nor precursor lesions of PEComa have been identified, we examined minute PEC nests, ranged from 0.8âmm to 10âmm, to investigate the possible origin of the PEComa. We examined a total of 80â677 para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes that were systematically dissected from 1656 patients for gynecological malignancies. The identified lesions were confirmed immunohistochemically with multiple PEC markers, including smooth muscle actin, HMB45, melan-A, MiTF, ER and PgR. A total of 66 minute PEC nests were found in 21 patients (1.3% of the total population) with an average frequency of 3.1 lesions per patient. In cases of multiple involvement, 11 of 13 nests were located at the same level of multiple lymph node or on continuous levels. The lesions were preferentially distributed at the level of para-aortic and high pelvic lymph nodes. All nests were positive for actin and HMB45, whereas the other markers were positive with varying frequencies. The minute PEC nests may be associated with the possible normal counterpart of PEComas.

A total of 206 patients with FIGO stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer and negative para-aortic lymph nodes (PALNs) who underwent pelvic IMRT (PRT) or SRVRT between 2004 and 2013 at our institution were reviewed. SRVRT cranially extended the PRT field for PALNs up to the left renal vein level. The prescribed dose was consistent 50.4Gy in 28 fractions. Overall, 110 and 96 patients underwent PRT and SRVRT, respectively. The SRVRT group had more advanced disease based on FIGO stage and positive pelvic lymph nodes (PLNs). The median follow-up time was 60months (range, 7-143). For the total study population, the 5-year PALN recurrence-free survival (PARFS) and overall survival (OS) for PRT vs. SRVRT were 87.6% vs. 97.9% (p=0.03) and 74.5% vs. 87.8% (p=0.04), respectively. In patients with FIGO III-IVA or positive PLNs, the 5-year PARFS and OS for PRT vs. SRVRT were 80.1% vs. 96.4% (p=0.02) and 58.1% vs. 83.5% (p=0.012), respectively. However, there were no significant differences in these outcomes for patients with FIGO IB-IIB and negative PLNs. In a multivariate analysis, only SRVRT was associated with better PARFS (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.78; p=0.02). The SRVRT did not significantly increase severe late toxicities. Prophylactic SRVRT using IMRT reduced PALN recurrence with tolerable toxicities, supporting the application of risk-based radiation fields for cervical cancer. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A small study established a sensitivity and specificity estimate for PALN metastases of 50% (95% CI; 7-93%) and 83% (95% CI; 52-98%), respectively. Surgical staging of PALN may lead to a higher diagnostic accuracy. However, surgical staging of para-aortic lymph nodes in locally advanced stage cervical cancer is not common practice. Therefore, a phase 2 randomised controlled trial is needed to assess its safety and feasibility. In addition to standard imaging (MRI or CT scan) with PET-CT, 30 adult women with FIGO stage IB2, IIA2-IVA cervical cancer will be randomised to receive either surgical staging or usual PET-CT staging. Administering extended field radiotherapy will be based on lymphadenectomy results for the intervention group and on the PET-CT results for the control group. Follow-up visits at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12Â months will assess health-related quality of life and progression-free survival.Primary safety and feasibility outcomes of surgical staging will be assessed by calculating means with 95% confidence intervals for duration of surgery, number of complications, blood loss, nodal yield after para-aortic lymphadenectomy and treatment delay due to surgical staging. Secondary patient-centred outcomes on quality of life and first year survival will be documented and compared between the two groups. Estimates of sensitivity, specificity and negative and positive predictive values of MRI, PET-CT and surgical staging will be presented with 95% CI.. All analysis will be performed according to the intention to treat principle. This study will assess safety and feasibility, expressed as the number and severity of complications, effect on quality of life and the treatment delay due to surgically staging para-aortic lymph nodes in\n\nThe Accuracy of Integrated [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Detection of Pelvic and Para-aortic Nodal Metastasis in Patients with High Risk Endometrial Cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGholkar, Nikhil Shirish; Saha, Subhas Chandra; Prasad, GRV; Bhattacharya, Anish; Srinivasan, Radhika; Suri, Vanita\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLymph nodal (LN) metastasis is the most important prognostic factor in high-risk endometrial cancer. However, the benefit of routine lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer is controversial. This study was conducted to assess the accuracy of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F] FDG-PET/CT) in detection of pelvic and para-aortic nodal metastases in high-risk endometrial cancer. 20 patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma underwent [18F] FDG-PET/CT followed by total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The findings on histopathology were compared with [18F] FDG-PET/CT findings to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of [18F] FDG-PET/CT. The pelvic nodal findings were analyzed on a patient and nodal chain based criteria. The para-aortic nodal findings were reported separately. Histopathology documented nodal involvement in two patients (10%). For detection of pelvic nodes, on a patient based analysis, [18F] FDG-PET/CT had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 61.11%, PPV of 22.22%, NPV of 100% and accuracy of 65% and on a nodal chain based analysis, [18F] FDG-PET/CT had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 80%, PPV of 20%, NPV of 100%, and accuracy of 80.95%. For detection of para-aortic nodes, [18F] FDG-PET/CT had sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 66.67%, PPV of 20%, NPV of 100%, and accuracy of 69.23%. Although [18F] FDG-PET/CT has high sensitivity for detection of LN metastasis in endometrial carcinoma, it had moderate accuracy and high false positivity. However, the high NPV is important in selecting patients in whom lymphadenectomy may be omitted.

Thirty-eight patients with cervical cancer and para-aortic lymph node metastasis who underwent EFCRT were analyzed. Active bone marrow was defined as the region within irradiated total bone marrow (BM TOT ) with a standard uptake value on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography greater than the mean standard uptake value for BM TOT . Serial weekly blood counts from the beginning to the end of radiation treatment were evaluated for HT using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Nineteen patients had grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity (HT3+), not including lymphocyte toxicity. Obese patients (n = 12) were less likely to get HT3+ (P = .03) despite getting equivalent doses of chemotherapy. Volumes of BM TOT and active bone marrow receiving doses of 20, 30, and 45 Gy and body mass index significantly predicted HT3+. Patients who had HT3+ had prolonged treatment time (62 vs 53 days, P < .001). For patients receiving EFCRT, bone marrow irradiation parameters and patient body mass index were associated with HT3+. A simplified nomogram has been created to predict HT3+ in these patients, allowing the potential to explore bone marrow-sparing delivery techniques.

Methods and Materials: The charts of 47 prostate cancer patients with PSA recurrence after prostatectomy who had positive lymph nodes on magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) were reviewed. Positive lymph nodes were assigned to a lymph node region according to the guidelines ofmoreÂ Â» the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) for delineation of the CTV for pelvic irradiation (RTOG-CTV). We defined four lymph node regions for positive nodes outside this RTOG-CTV: the para-aortal, proximal common iliac, pararectal, and paravesical regions. They were referred to as aberrant lymph node regions. For each patient, clinical and pathologic features were recorded, and their association with aberrant lymph drainage was investigated. The distribution of positive lymph nodes was analyzed separately for patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <1.0 ng/mL. Results: MRL detected positive aberrant lymph nodes in 37 patients (79%). In 20 patients (43%) a positive lymph node was found in the pararectal region. Higher PSA at the time of MRL was associated with the presence of positive lymph nodes in the para-aortic region (2.49 vs. 0.82 ng/mL; p = 0.007) and in the proximal common iliac region (1.95 vs. 0.59 ng/mL; p = 0.009). There were 18 patients with a PSA <1.0 ng/mL. Ten of these patients (61%) had at least one aberrant positive lymph node. Conclusion: Seventy-nine percent of the PSA-recurrent patients had at least one aberrant positive lymph node. Application of the standard RTOG-CTV for pelvic irradiation in the salvage setting therefore seems to be inappropriate.Â«Â less\n\nRole of pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer: Current evidence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBogani, Giorgio; Dowdy, Sean C.; Cliby, William A.; Ghezzi, Fabio; Rossetti, Diego; Mariani, Andrea\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe aim of the present review is to summarize the current evidence on the role of pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer. In 1988, the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommended surgical staging for endometrial cancer patients. However, 25 years later, the role of lymph node dissection remains controversial. Although the findings of two large independent randomized trials suggested that pelvic lymphadenectomy provides only adjunctive morbidity with no clear influence on survival outcomes, the studies have many pitfalls that limit interpretation of the results. Theoretically, lymphadenectomy may help identify patients with metastatic dissemination, who may benefit from adjuvant therapy, thus reducing radiation-related morbidity. Also, lymphadenectomy may eradicate metastatic disease. Because lymphatic spread is relatively uncommon, our main effort should be directed at identifying patients who may potentially benefit from lymph node dissection, thus reducing the rate of unnecessary treatment and associated morbidity. This review will discuss the role of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer, focusing on patient selection, extension of the surgical procedure, postoperative outcomes, quality of life and costs. The need for new surgical studies and efficacious systemic drugs is recommended. PMID:24472047\n\nA comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy to lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer staging (FIRES trial): a multicentre, prospective, cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRossi, Emma C; Kowalski, Lynn D; Scalici, Jennifer; Cantrell, Leigh; Schuler, Kevin; Hanna, Rabbie K; Method, Michael; Ade, Melissa; Ivanova, Anastasia; Boggess, John F\n\n2017-03-01\n\nSentinel-lymph-node mapping has been advocated as an alternative staging technique for endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to measure the sensitivity and negative predictive value of sentinel-lymph-node mapping compared with the gold standard of complete lymphadenectomy in detecting metastatic disease for endometrial cancer. In the FIRES multicentre, prospective, cohort study patients with clinical stage 1 endometrial cancer of all histologies and grades undergoing robotic staging were eligible for study inclusion. Patients received a standardised cervical injection of indocyanine green and sentinel-lymph-node mapping followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. 18 surgeons from ten centres (tertiary academic and community non-academic) in the USA participated in the trial. Negative sentinel lymph nodes (by haematoxylin and eosin staining on sections) were ultra-staged with immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin. The primary endpoint, sensitivity of the sentinel-lymph-node-based detection of metastatic disease, was defined as the proportion of patients with node-positive disease with successful sentinel-lymph-node mapping who had metastatic disease correctly identified in the sentinel lymph node. Patients who had mapping of at least one sentinel lymph node were included in the primary analysis (per protocol). All patients who received study intervention (injection of dye), regardless of mapping result, were included as part of the assessment of mapping and in the safety analysis in an intention-to-treat manner. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01673022 and is completed and closed. Between Aug 1, 2012, and Oct 20, 2015, 385 patients were enrolled. Sentinel-lymph-node mapping with complete pelvic lymphadenectomy was done in 340 patients and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was done in 196 (58%) of these patients. 293 (86%) patients had successful mapping of at least one sentinel lymph node. 41 (12\n\nSentinel lymph node detection following the hysteroscopic peritumoural injection of 99mTc-labelled albumin nanocolloid in endometrial cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaccauro, Marco; Lucignani, Giovanni; Aliberti, Gianluca; Villano, Carlo; Castellani, Maria Rita; Solima, Eugenio; Bombardieri, Emilio\n\n2005-05-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in endometrial cancer patients with a dual-tracer procedure after hysteroscopic peritumoural injection. Twenty-six women with previously untreated endometrial adenocarcinoma underwent the hysteroscopic injection of 111 MBq 99mTc-Nanocoll and blue dye administered subendometrially around the lesion. On the same day, all 26 patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy, followed 3-4 h later by hysterotomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy was also performed in cases of either serous or papillary carcinoma (n=7/26). All SLNs were removed and examined with haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical techniques. The procedure was well tolerated by patients, only two experiencing transient vagal symptoms. The sensitivity of this technique for correct identification of SLNs was 100%. Lymph node metastases were found in 4 out of the 26 patients (15%), bilaterally in the external iliac region (n=1), unilaterally in the external iliac region (n=1), unilaterally in the common iliac region (n=1) and unilaterally in the para-aortic region (n=1). In all four cases, nodal metastases were located within SLNs detected by lymphoscintigraphy. Only 10 of the 26 patients (38%) had significant blue dye staining. All blue-stained SLNs were radioactive. In patients with endometrial cancer, it is feasible to use lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy to define the topographic distribution of the lymphatic network and also to accurately detect lumbo-aortic and pelvic metastases within SLNs. In the majority of patients with early stage endometrial cancer, this procedure may avoid unnecessary radical pelvic lymphadenectomy. It may also guide para-aortic lymph node dissection on the basis of the SLN status.\n\nHybrid imaging by SPECT/CT for sentinel lymph node detection in patients with cancer of the uterine cervix.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez, A; Zerdoud, S; Mery, E; Bouissou, E; Ferron, G; Querleu, D\n\n2010-12-01\n\nConventional lymphoscintigraphy provides planar images with little spatial information on location of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). SPECT has better spatial resolution and, in combination with anatomic accuracy provided by CT improves SLN preoperative localization. The aim of the study was to report on the results of hybrid imaging of SLN in early cervical cancer patients treated at Claudius Regaud Cancer Center. Stages IA-IB1 cervical cancer patients undergoing preoperative SPECT/CT for SLN detection were analysed. Forty-one patients were included. A 100% SLN detection rate was achieved when a combined technique (radiotracer and blue dye) was used. At least one SLN was clearly visualized by SPECT/CT in 39 of 41 patients (95%) and full anatomic concordance with intraoperative anatomical location of SLN was found in 37 of the 39 patients with at least one SLN identified by SPECT/CT (95%). Location of removed SLN included the external and internal iliac area in 88% patients, the common iliac area in 10.5%, and the inframesenteric para-aortic area in 1.5%. No SLN was found in the infrarenal para-aortic region. Lymph node involvement was identified in 5 patients (12.1%). SLN correctly predicted lymph node involvement in all node-positive patients. However, SPECT/CT failed to identify 1 of the 5 metastatic SLN. SPECT/CT accurately detected preoperative SLN topography and enhanced diagnostic sensitivity of SLN imaging, improving surgical approach to patients with cervical cancer staging. Diagnostic quality of anatomic landmarks of CT images of SPECT/CT could be further improved by the use of contrast injected CT. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We report the 3-dimensional distribution of para-aortic (PA) lymph nodes (LN) in pelvic malignancies. We propose a guideline to accurately define the PA LN by anatomic landmarks and compare our data with published guidelines for pancreatic cancer. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis was performed on 46 patients with pelvic malignancies and positive PA LNs. Positive LNs were defined based on size and morphology or fluorodeoxyglucose avidity. All PA LNs were characterized into 3 groupsmoreÂ Â» based on location: left PA (between aorta and left psoas muscle), aortocaval (between aorta and inferior vena cava), and right paracaval (between inferior vena cava and right psoas muscle). Patients with retrocrural LNs were also analyzed. Results: One hundred thirty-three positive PA LNs were evaluated. The majority of the PA LNs were in the left PA (59%) and aortocaval (35) regions, and only 8% were in the right paracaval region. All patients with positive right paracaval LNs also had involved left PA LNs, with only 1 exception. The highest PA LN involvement was at the level of the renal vessels and was seen in 28% of patients. Of these patients with disease extending to renal vessels, 38% had retrocrural LN involvement. Conclusions: The nodal contouring for the PA region should not be defined by a fixed circumferential margin around the vessels. The left PA and aortocaval spaces should be covered adequately because these are common locations of PA LNs. For microscopic disease superiorly, contouring should extend up to renal vessels rather than a fixed bony landmark. For patients who have nodal involvement at renal vessels, one can consider including retrocrural LNs. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Para-aortic Contouring Guidelines for Pancreatic Neoplasm are not applicable\n\nAutomatic mediastinal lymph node detection in chest CT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFeuerstein, Marco; Deguchi, Daisuke; Kitasaka, Takayuki; Iwano, Shingo; Imaizumi, Kazuyoshi; Hasegawa, Yoshinori; Suenaga, Yasuhito; Mori, Kensaku\n\n2009-02-01\n\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest is a very common staging investigation for the assessment of mediastinal, hilar, and intrapulmonary lymph nodes in the context of lung cancer. In the current clinical workflow, the detection and assessment of lymph nodes is usually performed manually, which can be error-prone and timeconsuming. We therefore propose a method for the automatic detection of mediastinal, hilar, and intrapulmonary lymph node candidates in contrast-enhanced chest CT. Based on the segmentation of important mediastinal anatomy (bronchial tree, aortic arch) and making use of anatomical knowledge, we utilize Hessian eigenvalues to detect lymph node candidates. As lymph nodes can be characterized as blob-like structures of varying size and shape within a specific intensity interval, we can utilize these characteristics to reduce the number of false positive candidates significantly. We applied our method to 5 cases suspected to have lung cancer. The processing time of our algorithm did not exceed 6 minutes, and we achieved an average sensitivity of 82.1% and an average precision of 13.3%.\n\n[Risk factors of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph node â¤ 2].\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Yajun; He, Yingjian; Fan, Zhaoqing; Ouyang, Tao\n\n2014-08-13\n\nTo explore retrospectively the risk factors of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis â¤ 2 and examine the likelihood of non-sentinel lymph node prediction. A sentinel lymph node biopsy database containing 455 breast cancer patients admitted between July 2005 and February 2012 at Beijing Cancer Hospital was analyzed retrospectively. The patients had â¤ 2 positive sentinel lymph node and complete axillary lymph node dissection. The SLNSâº/SLNS ratio (P = 0.001), histological grade (P = 0.075), size of mass (P = 0.023) and onset age (P = 0.074) were correlated with NSLN metastases. Only SLNSâº/SLNS (OR 0.502 95% CI 0.322-0.7844) , histological grade ratio (histological grade ratio II, III and others vs grade I OR 2.696, 2.102, 3.662) were significant independent predictors for NSLN metastases . The ROC value was 0.62 (0.56, 0.68). For â¤ 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer, ratio of SLNSâº/SLNS and histological grading are independent factors affecting NSLN metastases. However, the results remain unsatisfactory for predicting the status of NSLN.\n\nFalse positive computed tomographic angiography for Stanford type A aortic dissection.\n\nPubMed\n\nBandali, Murad F; Hatem, Muhammed A; Appoo, Jehangir J; Hutchison, Stuart J; Wong, Jason K\n\n2015-12-01\n\nComputed tomographic angiography (CTA) has emerged as the defacto imaging test to rule out acute aortic dissection; however, it is not without flaws. WeÂ report a case of a false-positive CTA with respect to Stanford Type A aortic dissection. A 52 year-old male presented with sudden onset shortness of breath. He denied chest pain. Due to severe hypertension and an Emergency Department bedside ultrasound suggesting an intimal flap in the aorta, CTA was requested to better assess the ascending aorta and was interpreted as consistent with Stanford Type A aortic dissection with thrombosis of the false lumen in the ascending aorta. However, intra-operative imaging (TEE and epi-aortic scanning) did not identify an intimal flap or dissection, and neither did definitive surgical inspection of the aorta. The suspected aortic dissection and thrombosed false lumen were not visualized on repeat CTA two days later. False positive diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection on CTA can be the result of technical factors, streak artifacts, motion artifacts, and periaortic structures. In this case, non-uniform arterial contrast enhancement secondary to unrecognized biventricular dysfunction resulted in the false positive CTA appearance of an intimal flap and mural thrombus. Intra-operative TEE and epi-aortic scanning were proven correct in excluding aortic dissection by the standard of definitive surgical inspection of the aorta.\n\nAortic biological valve thrombosis in an HIV positive patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nAchouh, Paul; Jemel, Amine; Chaudeurge, AurÃ©lie; Redheuil, Alban; Zegdi, Rachid; Fabiani, Jean-NoÃ«l\n\n2011-06-01\n\nBiological aortic valve thrombosis is an exceptional complication. A 64-year-old patient positive for human immunodeficiency virus presented for syncope on exertion, 2 years after an aortic bioprosthetic valve replacement and double coronary artery bypass. Transvalvular aortic mean gradient was approximately 50 mm Hg on echocardiogram and catheterization. Cardiac computed tomography scan showed a limited opening of the bioprosthesis cusps. Surgical exploration revealed thrombosis of the three cusps on the aortic side, limiting the opening of the valve. No relation could be established between the patient's human immunodeficiency virus status and valve thrombosis. Copyright Â© 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our study aimed to investigate the incidence of metastasis in distal external iliac lymph nodes and its association with clinicopathological factors in patients with early stage cervical cancer, and to determine the role of distal external iliac lymph nodes dissection in the surgery. Five hundred and twenty-four patients with early stage cervical cancer underwent radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy in the Shandong Province Cancer Hospital between June 1995 and December 2011, and their clinicopathological features were analyzed retrospectively. Of the 524 patients, 124 (23.7%) had pelvic lymph node metastasis. The metastasis rates were 16.2% (85 of 524 patients) in the obturator lymph nodes, 12.2% (64 of 524 patients) in the internal and external iliac lymph nodes, 2.9% (15 of 524 patients) in the common iliac lymph nodes, 2.1% (11 of 524 patients) in the distal external iliac lymph nodes, and 1.7% (9 of 524 patients) in the para-aortic nodes. The incidence of isolated positive distal external iliac lymph nodes was 0.2%. Univariate analysis showed that lymphovascular space invasion, pelvic lymph node metastases (excluding distal external iliac lymph nodes) were significantly associated with distal external iliac lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that pelvic lymph node metastasis (excluding distal external iliac lymph nodes) was the independent risk factor for metastasis to distal external iliac lymph nodes. In early stage cervical cancer, distal external iliac lymph node metastasis is rare, especially in cases with stage IA or without pelvic lymph node metastasis. Less extensive pelvic lymphadenectomy may be considered in these patients in order to reduce operative complications and improve patients' quality of life. The deep circumflex iliac vein may be an\n\nNumber of evaluated lymph nodes and positive lymph nodes, lymph node ratio, and log odds evaluation in early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: numerology or valid indicators of patient outcome?\n\nPubMed\n\nLahat, G; Lubezky, N; Gerstenhaber, F; Nizri, E; Gysi, M; Rozenek, M; Goichman, Y; Nachmany, I; Nakache, R; Wolf, I; Klausner, J M\n\n2016-09-29\n\nWe evaluated the prognostic significance and universal validity of the total number of evaluated lymph nodes (ELN), number of positive lymph nodes (PLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), and log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) in a relatively large and homogenous cohort of surgically treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Prospectively accrued data were retrospectively analyzed for 282 PDAC patients who had pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) at our institution. Long-term survival was analyzed according to the ELN, PLN, LNR, and LODDS. Of these patients, 168 patients (59.5Â %) had LN metastasis (N1). Mean ELN and PLN were 13.5 and 1.6, respectively. LN positivity correlated with a greater number of evaluated lymph nodes; positive lymph nodes were identified in 61.4Â % of the patients with ELNââ¥â13 compared with 44.9Â % of the patients with ELNâ<â13 (pâ=â0.014). Median overall survival (OS) and 5-year OS rate were higher in N0 than in N1 patients, 22.4 vs. 18.7Â months and 35 vs. 11Â %, respectively (pâ=â0.008). Mean LNR was 0.12; 91 patients (54.1Â %) had LNRâ<â0.3. Among the N1 patients, median OS was comparable in those with LNRââ¥â0.3 vs. LNRâ<â0.3 (16.7 vs. 14.1Â months, pâ=â0.950). Neither LODDS nor various ELN and PLN cutoff values provided more discriminative information within the group of N1 patients. Our data confirms that lymph node positivity strongly reflects PDAC biology and thus patient outcome. While a higher number of evaluated lymph nodes may provide a more accurate nodal staging, it does not have any prognostic value among N1 patients. Similarly, PLN, LNR, and LODDS had limited prognostic relevance.\n\nPredictive Factors for Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Nomogram for Predicting Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRyu, Jai Min; Lee, Se Kyung; Kim, Ji Young; Yu, Jonghan; Kim, Seok Won; Lee, Jeong Eon; Han, Se Hwan; Jung, Yong Sik; Nam, Seok Jin\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAxillary lymph node (ALN) status is an important prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. With increasing numbers of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), issues concerning sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC have emerged. We analyzed the clinicopathologic features and developed a nomogram to predict the possibility of nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastases in patients with positive SLNs after NAC. A retrospective medical record review was performed of 140 patients who had had clinically positive ALNs at presentation, had a positive SLN after NAC on subsequent SLNB, and undergone axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) from 2008 toÂ 2014. On multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, pathologic T stage, lymphovascular invasion, SLN metastasis size, and number of positive SLN metastases were independent predictors for NSLN metastases (PÂ < .05). The NAC nomogram was based on these 4 variables. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.791 for the NAC nomogram. In the internal validation of performance, the AUCs for the training and test sets were 0.801 and 0.760, respectively. The nomogram was validated in an external patient cohort, with an AUC of 0.705. The Samsung Medical Center NAC nomogram was developed to predict the likelihood of additional positive NSLNs. The Samsung Medical Center NAC nomogram could provide information to surgeons regarding whether to perform additional ALND when the permanent biopsy revealed positive findings, although the intraoperative SLNB findings were negative.

Adjuvant chemotherapy given shortly after surgery, when tumor burden is low, seems reasonable, yet there is no proof that it improves survival. In this retrospective study, we compare the outcomes of patients with microscopic lymph node positive bladder cancer (pN1 or pN2) treated with radical cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and those who declined chemotherapy. Sixty-seven patients with lymph node positive bladder cancer (26 pN1 and 41 pN2) who underwent radical cystectomy between April 1995 and April 2005 were reviewed. Combined adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin in most patients) was given to 35 patients (52%), but declined by 32 (48%). The two groups were similar in performance status, postoperative complication rate, and N stage but deferring patients were on average 5 years older and had a more advanced T stage. Study primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Adjuvant chemotherapy was well tolerated and 28/35 patients (80%) completed all 4 cycles. Median OS of patients given adjuvant chemotherapy was 48 months compared with 8 months for declining patients (hazard ratio 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.4, P < 0.0001). Multivariate age adjusted analysis showed that adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent factor affecting OS (hazard ratio 0.2, P < 0.0001). This study supports the use of adjuvant chemotherapy after radical cystectomy in patients with node positive bladder cancer. Study design and patient imbalances make it impossible to draw definitive conclusions.\n\nOutcome following sentinel lymph node biopsy-guided decisions in breast cancer patients with conversion from positive to negative axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Young-Joon; Han, Wonshik; Park, Soojin; You, Ji Young; Yi, Ha Woo; Park, Sungmin; Nam, Sanggeun; Kim, Joo Heung; Yun, Keong Won; Kim, Hee Jeong; Ahn, Sei Hyun; Park, Seho; Lee, Jeong Eon; Lee, Eun Sook; Noh, Dong-Young; Lee, Jong Won\n\n2017-11-01\n\nMany breast cancer patients with positive axillary lymph nodes achieve complete node remission after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy in this situation is uncertain. This study evaluated the outcomes of sentinel biopsy-guided decisions in patients who had conversion of axillary nodes from clinically positive to negative following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We reviewed the records of 1247 patients from five hospitals in Korea who had breast cancer with clinically axillary lymph node-positive status and negative conversion after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, between 2005 and 2012. Patients who underwent axillary operations with sentinel biopsy-guided decisions (Group A) were compared with patients who underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection without sentinel lymph node biopsy (Group B). Axillary node recurrence and distant recurrence-free survival were compared. There were 428 cases in Group A and 819 in Group B. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that recurrence-free survivals were not significantly different between Groups A and B (4-year axillary recurrence-free survival: 97.8 vs. 99.0%; pÂ =Â 0.148). Multivariate analysis also indicated the two groups had no significant difference in axillary and distant recurrence-free survival. For breast cancer patients who had clinical conversion of axillary lymph nodes from positive to negative following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, sentinel biopsy-guided axillary surgery, and axillary lymph node dissection without sentinel lymph node biopsy had similar rates of recurrence. Thus, sentinel biopsy-guided axillary operation in breast cancer patients who have clinically axillary lymph node positive to negative conversion following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a useful strategy.\n\nFreeâfloating cancer cells in lymph node sinuses of hilar lymph nodeâpositive patients with nonâsmall cell lung cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Yusuke; Mukai, Masaya; Hiraiwa, Shinichiro; Kishima, Kyoko; Sugiyama, Tomoko; Tajiri, Takuma; Yamada, Shunsuke; Iwazaki, Masayuki\n\n2018-05-14\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that freeâfloating cancer cells (FFCCs) in the lymph node sinuses were of prognostic significance for colorectal and gastric cancer. The present study investigated the clinical significance of detecting FFCCs using Fast Red staining for cytokeratin in stageÂ I/II nonâsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and hilar lymph node positive NSCLC patients who underwent curative resection. Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 164Â patients (including 22Â hilar lymph node positive patients) were investigated. Resected lymph nodes were stained for cytokeratin using an antiâcytokeratin antibody. In order to achieve a clear distinction from coal dust, an antiâcytokeratin antibody was labeled with a secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, which was detected by a reaction with Fast Red/naphthol that produced a red color. Patients were considered to be positive for FFCCs (FFCCs+) if one or more than one freeâfloating cytokeratinâpositive cell was detected in the lymph node sinuses, which could not be detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Among all 164Â patients, a significant difference was observed in 5âyear relapseâfree survival (5YâRFS) rates, with 76.9 and 33.3% being achieved by FFCCsâÂ andÂ FFCCs+ patients, respectively (P<0.001). Similarly, the 5âyear overall survival (5YâOS) rate was significantly lower in FFCCs+ patients, with 86.6% being achieved by FFCCsâ and 65.8% by FFCCs+ patients, respectively (P=0.014). Among 22 hilar lymph nodeâpositive patients, a significant difference was also observed in 5YâRFS, with 53.8 and 0.0% being achieved by FFCCsâ and FFCCs+ patients, respectively (P=0.006). The 5YâOS tended to be lower in FFCCs+ patients, with 69.2Â andÂ 53.3% being achieved by FFCCsâÂ andÂ FFCCs+ patients, respectively (P=0.463). The findings of the present study suggested the presence of FFCCs in stageÂ I/II NSCLC patients was associated with a poor prognosis. In addition, FFCCs\n\nPara-aortic nodal metastases in cervical cancer: a blind spot in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system: current diagnosis and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nHwang, Lindsay; Bailey, April; Lea, Jayanthi; Albuquerque, Kevin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn cervical cancer, para-aortic nodal (PALN) metastases at presentation is a strong indicator of poor prognosis. Despite this, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system does not require evaluation of lymph node involvement and does not incorporate clinically detected PALN into the staging system. In the USA, despite screening, a significant number of women still present at an advanced stage often with nodal metastases. While the presence of PALN metastases often indicates occult systemic disease, it is possible with modern therapies to provide long-term control of disease in a percentage of patients. We review the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of PALN metastases in cervical cancer outlining advances in modern imaging and combined modality therapies (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy).\n\nEffect of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy on Axillary Lymph Node Positivity and Numbers in Breast Cancer Cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nUyan, Mikail; Koca, Bulent; Yuruker, Savas; Ozen, Necati\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare the numbers of axillary lymph nodes (ALN) taken out by dissection between patients with breast cancer operated on after having neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) treatment and otherswithout having neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and to investigate factors affecting lymph node positivity. A total of 49 patients operated due to advanced breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 144 patients with a similar stage of the cancer having primary surgical treatment without chemotherapy at the general surgery clinic of Ondokuz Mayis University Medicine Faculty between the dates 01.01.2006 and 31.10.2012 were included in the study. The total number of lymph nodes taken out by axillary dissection (ALND) was categorized as the number of positive lymph nodes and divided into <10 and â¥10. The variables to be compared were analysed using the program SPSS 15.0 with P<0.05 accepted as significant. Median number of dissected lymph nodes from the patient group having neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 16 (16-33) while it was 20 (5-55) without chemotherapy. The respective median numbers of positive lymph nodes were 5 ( 0-19) and 10 (0-51). In 8 out of 49 neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients (16.3%), the number of dissected lymph nodes was below 10, and it was below 10 in 17 out of 144 primary surgery patients. Differences in numbers of dissected total and positive lymph nodes between two groups were significant, but this was not the case for numbers of <10 lymph nodes. The number of dissected lymph nodes from the patients with breast cancer having neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be less than without chemotherapy. This may not always be attributed to an inadequate axillary dissection. More research to evaluate the numbers of positive lymph nodes are required in order to increase the reliability of staging in the patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nMitotic rate is associated with positive lymph nodes in patients with thin melanomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nWheless, Lee; Isom, Chelsea A; Hooks, Mary A; Kauffmann, Rondi M\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe American Joint Commission on Cancer will remove mitotic rate from its staging guidelines in 2018. Using a large nationally representative cohort, we examined the association between mitotic rate and lymph node positivity among thin melanomas. A total of 149,273 thin melanomas in the National Cancer Database were examined for their association of high-risk features of mitotic rate, ulceration, and Breslow depth with lymph node status. Among 17,204 patients with thin melanomas with data on Breslow depth, ulceration, and mitotic rate who underwent a lymph node biopsy, there was a strong linear relationship between odds of having a positive lymph node and mitotic rate (R 2 Â =Â 0.96, PÂ <Â .0001, Î²Â =Â 3.31). The odds of having a positive node increased by 19% with each 1-point increase in mitotic rate (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.21). Cases with negative nodes had a mean mitotic rate of 1.54 plus or minus 2.07 mitoses/mm 2 compared with 3.30 plus or minus 3.54 mitoses/mm 2 for those with positive nodes (PÂ <Â .0001). The data collected do not allow for survival analyses. Mitotic rate was strongly associated with the odds of having a positive lymph node and should continue to be reported on pathology reports.

The purpose of this review is to determine whether a survival advantage arises from surgical debulking of enlarged positive lymph nodes in different types of gynaecological cancers. Information from studies published on the survival benefits from debulking lymph nodes in gynaecological cancers was investigated. Pertaining to therapeutic lymphadenectomy, survival benefit can be analysed in two ways, direct survival benefit following therapeutic lymphadenectomy of bulky positive metastatic lymph nodes and indirect survival benefit, which results after a sequela of systematic lymphadenectomy, proper, accurate staging of disease and stage migration and tailor-made adjuvant treatment. The direct hypothesis of therapeutic lymphadenectomy and survival benefit has been prospected in cervical cancers and vulval cancers and in post-chemotherapy residual paraarotic nodal mass in germ cell ovarian cancer. The indirect survival benefit of therapeutic paraarotic lymphadenectomy in high-risk endometrial cancers and advanced epithelial ovarian cancers needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials. More randomized controlled trials are required to investigate this research question. Further, indirect benefit due to tailor-made adjuvant treatment, secondary to accurate staging achieved as a sequela of systematic lymphadenectomy, needs to be analysed in future trials.

We have previously developed a fast yet effective approach for computer aided detection of PE in computed topographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA),1 which is capable of detecting both acute and chronic PEs, achieving a benchmark performance of 78% sensitivity at 4 false positives (FPs) per volume. By reviewing the FPs generated by this system, we found the most dominant type of FP, roughly one third of all FPs, to be lymph/connective tissue. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that specifically aims at reducing this FP type. Our idea is to explicitly exploit the anatomical context configuration of PE and lymph tissue in the lungs: a lymph FP connects to the airway and is located outside the artery, while a true PE should not connect to the airway and must be inside the artery. To realize this idea, given a detected candidate (i.e. a cluster of suspicious voxels), we compute a set of contextual features, including its distance to the airway based on local distance transform and its relative position to the artery based on fast tensor voting and Hessian \"vesselness\" scores. Our tests on unseen cases show that these features can reduce the lymph FPs by 59%, while improving the overall sensitivity by 3.4%.\n\nA Web-based nomogram predicting para-aortic nodal metastasis in incompletely staged patients with endometrial cancer: a Korean Multicenter Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Sokbom; Lee, Jong-Min; Lee, Jae-Kwan; Kim, Jae-Weon; Cho, Chi-Heum; Kim, Seok-Mo; Park, Sang-Yoon; Park, Chan-Yong; Kim, Ki-Tae\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a Web-based nomogram for predicting the individualized risk of para-aortic nodal metastasis in incompletely staged patients with endometrial cancer. From 8 institutions, the medical records of 397 patients who underwent pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy as a surgical staging procedure were retrospectively reviewed. A multivariate logistic regression model was created and internally validated by rigorous bootstrap resampling methods. Finally, the model was transformed into a user-friendly Web-based nomogram (http://http://www.kgog.org/nomogram/empa001.html). The rate of para-aortic nodal metastasis was 14.4% (57/397 patients). Using a stepwise variable selection, 4 variables including deep myometrial invasion, non-endometrioid subtype, lymphovascular space invasion, and log-transformed CA-125 levels were finally adopted. After 1000 repetitions of bootstrapping, all of these 4 variables retained a significant association with para-aortic nodal metastasis in the multivariate analysis-deep myometrial invasion (P = 0.001), non-endometrioid histologic subtype (P = 0.034), lymphovascular space invasion (P = 0.003), and log-transformed serum CA-125 levels (P = 0.004). The model showed good discrimination (C statistics = 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.92) and accurate calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.74). This nomogram showed good performance in predicting para-aortic metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer. The tool may be useful in determining the extent of lymphadenectomy after incomplete surgery.\n\nDetection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with early stage cervical cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeong, Seok Ju; Park, Hyun; Yang, Kwang Moon; Kim, Tae Jin; Lim, Kyung Taek; Shim, Jae Uk; Park, Chong Taik; Lee, Ki Heon\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of identifying the sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) as well as to evaluate factors that might influence the SN detection rate in patients with cervical cancer of the uterus. Eighty nine patients underwent intracervical injection of 1% isosulfan blue dye at the time of planned radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy between January 2003 and December 2003. With the visual detection of lymph nodes that stained blue, SNs were identified and removed separately. Then all patients underwent complete pelvic lymph node dissection and/or para-aortic lymph node dissection. SNs were identified in 51 of 89 (57.3%) patients. The most common site for SN detection was the external iliac area. Metastatic nodes were detected in 21 of 89 (23.5%) patients. One false negative SN was obtained. Successful SN detection was more likely in patients younger than 50 yr (p=0.02) and with a history of preoperative conization (p=0.05). However, stage, histological type, surgical procedure and neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no significant difference for SN detection rate. Therefore, the identification of SNs with isosulfan blue dye is feasible and safe. The SN detection rate was high in patients younger than 50 yr or with a history of preoperative conization.\n\nPrevious conization on patient eligibility of sentinel lymph node detection for early invasive cervical cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nKato, Hidenori; Todo, Yukiharu; Minobe, Shin-Ichiro; Suzuki, Yoshihiro; Nakatani, Makiko; Ohba, Yoko; Yamashiro, Katsusige; Okamoto, Kazuhira\n\n2011-11-01\n\nSentinel lymph node (SLN) detection has been accepted as a common strategy to preserve the quality of life of the patients with gynecologic cancers. However, the feasibility of SLN detection after conization is not yet clarified. Accuracy of SLN after conization was evaluated. Eighteen cases with prior conization (cone group) and 32 cases without conization (noncone group), all of which belonged to IB1 except 1 case in IA stage, underwent SLN detection. Systemic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was coincidently performed for the estimation of negative and positive predictive values. Detection rate in which at least unilateral nodes were identified or bilaterally identified was 100% and 72.2% in the cone group, 90.6% and 71.9% in the noncone group, respectively. The average number of the detected SLN was 2.4 in the cone group and 2.1 in the noncone group. Negative and positive predictive value was 100% in both groups. On the distribution of sentinel node stations, most of the detected nodes were internal iliac and obturator node in both groups. Less frequent detection was observed in superficial common iliac node (5.4% in the cone group, 3.1% in the noncone group), external iliac node (2.7% and 9.5%), and parauterine artery node (5.4% and 1.6%).In both groups, no other lymph nodes were identified as SLN except 1 case in the cone group with the node in cardinal ligament. No significant difference was observed on detection rate, predictive value, and the distribution of sentinel node between the cone and noncone groups. Sentinel lymph node detection after conization can be performed with a certain reliability.\n\nDense volumetric detection and segmentation of mediastinal lymph nodes in chest CT images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOda, Hirohisa; Roth, Holger R.; Bhatia, Kanwal K.; Oda, Masahiro; Kitasaka, Takayuki; Iwano, Shingo; Homma, Hirotoshi; Takabatake, Hirotsugu; Mori, Masaki; Natori, Hiroshi; Schnabel, Julia A.; Mori, Kensaku\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe propose a novel mediastinal lymph node detection and segmentation method from chest CT volumes based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Most lymph node detection methods are based on filters for blob-like structures, which are not specific for lymph nodes. The 3D U-Net is a recent example of the state-of-the-art 3D FCNs. The 3D U-Net can be trained to learn appearances of lymph nodes in order to output lymph node likelihood maps on input CT volumes. However, it is prone to oversegmentation of each lymph node due to the strong data imbalance between lymph nodes and the remaining part of the CT volumes. To moderate the balance of sizes between the target classes, we train the 3D U-Net using not only lymph node annotations but also other anatomical structures (lungs, airways, aortic arches, and pulmonary arteries) that can be extracted robustly in an automated fashion. We applied the proposed method to 45 cases of contrast-enhanced chest CT volumes. Experimental results showed that 95.5% of lymph nodes were detected with 16.3 false positives per CT volume. The segmentation results showed that the proposed method can prevent oversegmentation, achieving an average Dice score of 52.3 +/- 23.1%, compared to the baseline method with 49.2 +/- 23.8%, respectively.\n\nAnatomy and nomenclature of murine lymph nodes: Descriptive study and nomenclatory standardization in BALB/cAnNCrl mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan den Broeck, Wim; Derore, Annie; Simoens, Paul\n\n2006-05-30\n\nMurine lymph nodes are intensively studied but often assigned incorrectly in scientific papers. In BALB/cAnNCrl mice, we characterized a total of 22 different lymph nodes. Peripheral nodes were situated in the head and neck region (mandibular, accessory mandibular, superficial parotid, cranial deep cervical nodes), and at the forelimb (proper axillary, accessory axillary nodes) and hindlimb (subiliac, sciatic, popliteal nodes). Intrathoracic lymph nodes included the cranial mediastinal, tracheobronchal and caudal mediastinal nodes. Abdominal lymph nodes were associated with the gastrointestinal tract (gastric, pancreaticoduodenal, jejunal, colic, caudal mesenteric nodes) or were located along the major intra-abdominal blood vessels (renal, lumbar aortic, lateral iliac, medial iliac and external iliac nodes). Comparative and nomenclative aspects of murine lymph nodes are discussed. The position of the lymph nodes of BALB/cAnNCrl mice is summarized and illustrated in an anatomical chart containing proposals for both an official nomenclature according to the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria and English terms.\n\nSurvival benefits of pelvic lymphadenectomy versus pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients with endometrial cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGuo, Weina; Cai, Jing; Li, Min; Wang, Hongbo; Shen, Yi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAbstract Background: Despite that pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PPaLND) is recommended as part of accurate surgical staging by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) in endometrial cancer, the impact of para-aortic lymphadenectomy on survival remains controversial. The aim of this work is to evaluate the survival benefits or risks in endometrial cancer patients who underwent surgical staging with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy using meta-analysis. Methods: Literature search was undertaken using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant articles published between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 2017, without language restriction. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS); progression-free survival (PFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS)/disease-free survival (DFS)/disease-related survival (DRS) was also analyzed. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Quality assessments were performed by NewcastleâOttawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Publication bias was evaluated by using Begg and Egger tests. The hazard ratio (HR) was pooled with random-effects or fixed-effects model as appropriate. Results: Eight studies with a total of 2793 patients were included. OS was significantly longer in PPaLND group than in pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) group for patients with endometrial cancer [HR 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55â0.84, Pâ<â.001, I2â=â12.2%]. Subgroup analysis by recurrence risk explored the same association in patients at intermediate- or high-risk (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.39â0.69, Pâ<â.001, I2â=â41.4%), but not for low-risk patients (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.21â1.08, Pâ=â.077, I2â=â0). PPaLND with systematic resection of all para-aortic nodes up to renal vein also improved PFS/RFS/DFS/DRS, compared with PLND (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37â0.72, Pâ<â.001, I2â=â0). No publication bias was observed among included studies\n\nChemoradiation Therapy and Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Stages IB2-IIB or IIIB-IVA Cervical Cancer\n\nClinicalTrials.gov\n\n2018-05-24\n\nCervical Adenocarcinoma; Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma; Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Not Otherwise Specified; Positive Para-Aortic Lymph Node; Positive Pelvic Lymph Node; Stage IB2 Cervical Cancer AJCC v6 and v7; Stage II Cervical Cancer AJCC v7; Stage IIA Cervical Cancer AJCC v7; Stage IIB Cervical Cancer AJCC v6 and v7; Stage IIIB Cervical Cancer AJCC v6 and v7; Stage IVA Cervical Cancer AJCC v6 and v7\n\nSentinel Lymph Node Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With an Initial Diagnosis of Cytology-Proven Lymph Node-Positive Breast Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nEnokido, Katsutoshi; Watanabe, Chie; Nakamura, Seigo; Ogiya, Akiko; Osako, Tomo; Akiyama, Futoshi; Yoshimura, Akiyo; Iwata, Hiroji; Ohno, Shinji; Kojima, Yasuyuki; Tsugawa, Koichiro; Motomura, Kazuyoshi; Hayashi, Naoki; Yamauchi, Hideko; Sato, Nobuaki\n\n2016-08-01\n\nSentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) is the standard treatment of node-negative breast cancer; however, whether SNB should be performed for patients with node-positive disease before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is controversial. We evaluated the accuracy of SNB after NAC in patients with breast cancer with nodal metastasis before chemotherapy to determine the false-negative rate (FNR) and detection rate for SNB. In the present multicenter prospective study performed from September 2011 to April 2013, 143 patients with breast cancer and positive axillary nodes, proved by fine needle aspiration cytology at the initial diagnosis (stage T1-T3N1M0), were enrolled. All patients underwent breast surgery with SNB and complete axillary lymph node dissection. After NAC, the pathologic complete nodal response rate was 52.4%. The sentinel lymph node could be identified in 130 cases (90.9%); the FNR was 16.0% (13 of 81). The FNR of each clinical subtype was 42.1% (8 of 19) for the estrogen receptor-positive and human epithelial growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative (luminal type), 16.7% (2 of 12) for ER-positive and HER2-positive (luminal-HER2 type), 3.2% (1 of 31) for HER2-positive (HER2-enriched type), and 10.5% (2 of 19) for ER-negative and HER2-negative (triple-negative breast cancer; PÂ = .003). The FNR was significantly greater in the luminal than in the nonluminal type (odds ratio, 9.91; 95% confidence interval, 6.77-14.52). SNB after NAC in patients with initially node-positive breast cancer was technically feasible but should not be recommended for the luminal subtype. However, the tumor subtype can guide patient selection, and axillary lymph node dissection could be omitted for the luminal-HER2, HER2-enriched, and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes.

We seek examine how much a positive FHAD increases the risk of developing new aortic dissection (AoD) among first-degree relatives. Patients with AoD at our institution were analyzed for information of FHAD. Positive FHAD referred to that AoD occurred in index patient and one or more first-degree relatives. Negative FHAD was defined as the condition in which only one case of AoD (the index patient) occurred in the family. The age at AoD, exposure years in adulthood before AoD, and annual probability of AoD among first-degree relatives were compared between patients with negative and positive FHADs. FHAD was positive in 32 and negative in 68 among the 100 AoD patients with detailed family history information. Mean age at dissection was 59.9Â±14.7years. Compared to negative FHAD, patients with positive FHAD dissected at significantly younger age (54.7Â±16.8 vs 62.4Â±13.0years, p=0.013), had more AoD events in first-degree relatives (2.3Â±0.6 vs 1.0Â±0.0, p<0.001), and shorter exposure years per AoD event (18.3Â±6.7 vs 43.1Â±8.5, p<0.001). Annual probability of AoD per first-degree relative was 2.77 times higher in patients with positive than negative FHADs (0.0100Â±0.0057 vs 0.0036Â±0.0014, p<0.001). A positive FHAD confers a significantly increased risk of developing aortic dissection on family members, with a higher annual probability of aortic dissection, a shorter duration of \"exposure time\" before dissection occurs and a lower mean age at time of dissection.

However, standards for the quality of LND remain controversial. We compared the distribution of lymph node (LN) metastases in a two-institution cohort of patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) using a uniformly applied extended LND template. Patients undergoing RC at the University of Southern California (USC) Institute of Urology and at Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) were included if they met the following criteria: (1) no prior pelvic radiotherapy or LND; (2) lymphatic tissue submitted from all nine predesignated regions, including the paracaval and para-aortic LNs; (3) bladder primary; and (4) category M0 disease. The number and location of LN metastases were prospectively entered into corresponding databases. LN maps were constructed and correlated with preoperative and pathologic characteristics. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to estimate overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) among LN-positive (LN+) patients. Inclusion criteria were met by 646 patients (439 USC, 207 OHSU), and 23% had LN metastases at time of cystectomy. Although there was a difference in the median per-patient LN count between institutions, there were no significant interinstitutional differences in the incidence or distribution of positive LNs, which were found in 11% of patients with â¤pT2b and in 44% of patients with â¥pT3a tumors. Among LN+ patients, 41% had positive LNs above the common iliac bifurcation. Estimated 5-yr RFS and OS rates for LN+ patients were 45% and 33%, respectively, and did not differ significantly between institutions. LN metastases in regions outside the boundaries of standard LND are common. Adherence to meticulous dissection technique within an extended template is likely more important than total LN count for achieving optimal oncologic outcomes.

Prospective pilot study. The study was conducted in the Department of Advanced Operative and Oncologic Gynecology, Asklepios Hospital, Hamburg, Germany. 54 women with HPV-positive CC submitted to laparoscopic sentinel node biopsy alone or sentinel node biopsy followed by systematic pelvic and/or para-aortic endoscopic lymphadenectomy. All removed sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) underwent sample collection by cytobrush for the APTIMA assay before frozen section. Results obtained with the HPV mRNA test were compared with the definitive histopathological analysis of the SLNs and additional lymph nodes removed. A total of 125 SLNs (119 pelvic and 6 paraaortic) were excised with a mean number of 2.3 SLNs per patient. Final histopathologic analysis confirmed nodal metastases in 10 SLNs from 10 different patients (18%). All the histologically confirmed metastatic lymph nodes were also HPV E6/E7 mRNA positive, resulting in a sensitivity of 100%. Four histologically free sentinel nodes were positive for HPV E6/E7 mRNA, resulting in a specificity of 96.4%. The HPV E6/E7 mRNA assay in the SLNs of patients with CC is feasible and highly accurate. The detection of HPV mRNA in 4 women with negative SLNs might denote a shift from microscopic identification of metastasis to the molecular level. The prognostic value of this findings awaits further verification. Copyright Â© 2016.

The aortic valve is an important landmark for positioning of those devices. It would be of great value if the device position could be easily monitored on plain supine chest radiograph in the ICU. We introduce a ratio-based tool for determination of the aortic valve location on plain supine chest radiograph images, which can be used to evaluate intracardiac device position. Retrospective observational study. Large academic medical center. Patients admitted to the ICU and supported by an intracardiac assist device. We developed a ratio to determine the aortic valve location on supine chest radiograph images. This ratio is used to assess the position of a cardiac assist device and is compared with echocardiographic findings. Supine anterior-posterior chest radiographs of patients with an aortic valve prosthesis (n = 473) were analyzed to determine the location of the aortic valve. We calculated several ratios with the potential to determine the position of the aortic valve. The aortic valve location ratio, defined as the distance between the carina and the aortic valve, divided by the thoracic width, was found to be the best performing ratio. The aortic valve location ratio determines the location of the aortic valve caudal to the carina, at a distance of 0.25âÂ±â0.05 times the thoracic width for male patients and 0.28âÂ±â0.05 times the thoracic width for female patients. The aortic valve location ratio was validated using CT images of patients with angina pectoris without known valvular disease (n = 95). There was a good correlation between cardiac device position (Impella) assessed with the aortic valve location ratio and with echocardiography (n = 53). The aortic valve location ratio enables accurate and reproducible localization of the aortic valve on supine chest radiograph. This tool is easily applicable and can be used for\n\nDistribution of prostate nodes: a PET/CT-derived anatomic atlas of prostate cancer patients before and after surgical treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nHegemann, Nina-Sophie; Wenter, Vera; Spath, Sonja; Kusumo, Nadia; Li, Minglun; Bartenstein, Peter; Fendler, Wolfgang P; Stief, Christian; Belka, Claus; Ganswindt, Ute\n\n2016-03-11\n\nIn order to define adequate radiation portals in nodal positive prostate cancer a detailed knowledge of the anatomic lymph-node distribution is mandatory. We therefore systematically analyzed the localization of Choline PET/CT positive lymph nodes and compared it to the RTOG recommendation of pelvic CTV, as well as to previous work, the SPECT sentinel lymph node atlas. Thirty-two patients being mostly high risk patients with a PSA of 12.5 ng/ml (median) received PET/CT before any treatment. Eighty-seven patients received PET/CT for staging due to biochemical failure with a median PSA of 3.12 ng/ml. Each single PET-positive lymph node was manually contoured in a \"virtual\" patient dataset to achieve a 3-D visualization, resulting in an atlas of the cumulative PET positive lymph node distribution. Further the PET-positive lymph node location in each patient was assessed with regard to the existence of a potential geographic miss (i.e. PET-positive lymph nodes that would not have been treated adequately by the RTOG consensus on CTV definition of pelvic lymph nodes). Seventy-eight and 209 PET positive lymph nodes were detected in patients with no prior treatment and in postoperative patients, respectively. The most common sites of PET positive lymph nodes in patients with no prior treatment were external iliac (32.1 %), followed by common iliac (23.1 %) and para-aortic (19.2 %). In postoperative patients the most common sites of PET positive lymph nodes were common iliac (24.9 %), followed by external iliac (23.0 %) and para-aortic (20.1 %). In patients with no prior treatment there were 34 (43.6 %) and in postoperative patients there were 77 (36.8 %) of all detected lymph nodes that would not have been treated adequately using the RTOG CTV. We compared the distribution of lymph nodes gained by Choline PET/CT to the preexisting SPECT sentinel lymph node atlas and saw an overall good congruence. Choline PET/CT and SPECT sentinel lymph node atlas are comparable to each\n\nBreast cancer-specific survival in patients with lymph node-positive hormone receptor-positive invasive breast cancer and Oncotype DX Recurrence Score results in the SEER database.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoberts, Megan C; Miller, Dave P; Shak, Steven; Petkov, Valentina I\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe Oncotype DX Â® Breast Recurrence Scoreâ¢ (RS) assay is validated to predict breast cancer (BC) recurrence and adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in select patients with lymph node-positive (LN+), hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative BC. We assessed 5-year BC-specific survival (BCSS) in LN+ patients with RS results in SEER databases. In this population-based study, BC cases in SEER registries (diagnosed 2004-2013) were linked to RS results from assays performed by Genomic Health (2004-2014). The primary analysis included only patients (diagnosed 2004-2012) with LN+ (including micrometastases), HR+ (per SEER), and HER2-negative (per RT-PCR) primary invasive BC (NÂ =Â 6768). BCSS, assessed by RS category and number of positive lymph nodes, was calculated using the actuarial method. The proportion of patients with RS results and LN+ disease (NÂ =Â 8782) increased over time between 2004 and 2013, and decreased with increasing lymph node involvement from micrometastases to â¥4 lymph nodes. Five-year BCSS outcomes for those with RSÂ <Â 18 ranged from 98.9% (95% CI 97.4-99.6) for those with micrometastases to 92.8% (95% CI 73.4-98.2) for those with â¥4 lymph nodes. Similar patterns were found for patients with RS 18-30 and RSÂ â¥Â 31. RS group was strongly predictive of BCSS among patients with micrometastases or up to three positive lymph nodes (pÂ <Â 0.001). Overall, 5-year BCSS is excellent for patients with RSÂ <Â 18 and micrometastases, one or two positive lymph nodes, and worsens with additionally involved lymph nodes. Further analyses should account for treatment variables, and longitudinal updates will be important to better characterize utilization of Oncotype DX testing and long-term survival outcomes.\n\nA mathematical prediction model incorporating molecular subtype for risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in sentinel lymph node-positive breast cancer patients: a retrospective analysis and nomogram development.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Na-Na; Yang, Zheng-Jun; Wang, Xue; Chen, Li-Xuan; Zhao, Hong-Meng; Cao, Wen-Feng; Zhang, Bin\n\n2018-04-25\n\nMolecular subtype of breast cancer is associated with sentinel lymph node status. We sought to establish a mathematical prediction model that included breast cancer molecular subtype for risk of positive non-sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis and further validate the model in a separate validation cohort.
