Posterior parietal peritoneum is cut from the level of ileocolic junction to the level of ligament of Treitz. Paracaval space is developed; right ovarian vessels and right ureter is identified.\n\nHorizontal part of duodenum is mobilized and retracted superiorly. Left renal vein is identified.\n\nThe areolar tissue between the left common iliac artery and mesentery of sigmoid colon is opened, by the way the left ureter and inferior mesenteric artery is identified.\n\nThe paraaortic lymph node dissection begins over the right common iliac artery from the mid-level caudad to cephalad direction. Precaval and preaortic lymph nodes are dissected to the level of left renal vein.\n\nLateral aortic lymph nodes are dissected from the infra-mesenteric region (low paraaortic), below the level of inferior mesenteric artery. Lateral aortic lymph nodes superior to the level of inferior mesenteric artery (high paraaortic) are identified by sharp and blunt dissection from the mesentery of descending and sigmoid colon and underlying left Gerota’s fascia. Lateral aortic lymph nodes are dissected from the supra-mesenteric region, between the inferior mesenteric artery and left renal vein.\n\nConclusion Aortic bifurcation, common iliac artery, common iliac vein, abdominal ureter, inferior mesenteric artery, ovarian artery, ovarian vein, left renal vein, lumbar vein, lumbar artery, inferior vena cava and aorta are the basic anatomic landmarks for a proper paraaortic lymphadenectomy.\n\nDisclosure Nothing to disclose",
