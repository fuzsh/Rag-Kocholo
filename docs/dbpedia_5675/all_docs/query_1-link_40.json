Sentinel lymph node biopsy is increasingly being used as a less morbid alternative to axillary lymph node dissection. However, when sentinel lymph node biopsy is positive, axillary dissection is typically performed for complete staging and local control. Axillary ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (USFNA) are useful for detecting axillary nodal metastasis preoperatively and can spare patients sentinel node biopsy, because those with positive cytology on USFNA can proceed directly to axillary dissection or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Internal mammary nodes are not routinely evaluated, but when the appearance of these nodes is abnormal on imaging, further treatment or metastatic evaluation may be necessary.

A model system that allows long-term intravital imaging of lymph nodes would facilitate the study of cell behavior in lymph nodes during the generation of immune responses in a variety of disease settings and during the formation of metastatic lesions in cancer-bearing mice. We describe a chronic lymph node window (CLNW) surgical preparation that allows intravital imaging of the inguinal lymph node in mice. The CLNW is custom-made from titanium and incorporates a standard coverslip. It allows stable longitudinal imaging without the need for serial surgeries while preserving lymph node blood and lymph flow. We also describe how to build and use an imaging stage specifically designed for the CLNW to prevent (large) rotational changes as well as respiratory movement during imaging. The entire procedure takes approximately half an hour per mouse, and subsequently allows for longitudinal intravital imaging of the murine lymph node and surrounding structures for up to 14 d. Small-animal surgery experience is required to successfully carry out the protocol.\n\nLymph node biopsy\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

The results showed that at least 80% of benign lymph node enlargements containing small groups of epithelioid cells were associated with high titres of Toxoplasma antibodies. Furthermore, 85--95% of the lymph nodes in association with high Toxoplasma antibodies showed the typical histological appearances of toxoplasmosis. The histological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is thus both fairly specific and sensitive. Other lymph node lesions with small groups of epithelioid cells must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis usually have a predominance of distinct large epithelioid cell granulomata. Lymph nodes with sinus histiocytosis showing the formation of small groups of epithelioid cells, do not demonstrate prominent hyperplasia and include sparse germinal centres and were not associated with toxoplasmosis. Lymph nodes with disturbed general structure and small groups of epithelioid cells must be carefully assessed because of the significant possibility of malignancy.\n\nPenile Cancer: Contemporary Lymph Node Management.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Brien, Jonathan S; Perera, Marlon; Manning, Todd; Bozin, Mike; Cabarkapa, Sonja; Chen, Emily; Lawrentschuk, Nathan\n\n2017-06-01\n\nIn penile cancer, the optimal diagnostics and management of metastatic lymph nodes are not clear. Advances in minimally invasive staging, including dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy, have widened the diagnostic repertoire of the urologist. We aimed to provide an objective update of the recent trends in the management of penile squamous cell carcinoma, and inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastases. We systematically reviewed several medical databases, including the Web of ScienceÂ® (with MEDLINEÂ®), EmbaseÂ® and Cochrane databases, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search terms used were penile cancer, lymph node, sentinel node, minimally invasive, surgery and outcomes, alone and in combination. Articles pertaining to the management of lymph nodes in penile cancer were reviewed, including original research, reviews and clinical guidelines published between 1980 and 2016. Accurate and minimally invasive lymph node staging is of the utmost importance in the surgical management of penile squamous cell carcinoma. In patients with clinically node negative disease, a growing body of evidence supports the use of sentinel lymph node biopsies. Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy exposes the patient to minimal risk, and results in superior sensitivity and specificity profiles compared to alternate nodal staging techniques. In the presence of locoregional disease, improvements in inguinal or pelvic lymphadenectomy have reduced morbidity and improved oncologic outcomes. A multimodal approach of chemotherapy and surgery has demonstrated a survival benefit for patients with advanced disease. Recent developments in lymph node management have occurred inÂ penile cancer, such as minimally invasive lymph node diagnosis and intervention strategies. These advances have been met with a degree of controversy in the contemporary literature. Current data suggest that dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy provides excellent\n\nLymph node detection in IASLC-defined zones on PET/CT images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSong, Yihua; Udupa, Jayaram K.; Odhner, Dewey; Tong, Yubing; Torigian, Drew A.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nLymph node detection is challenging due to the low contrast between lymph nodes as well as surrounding soft tissues and the variation in nodal size and shape. In this paper, we propose several novel ideas which are combined into a system to operate on positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) images to detect abnormal thoracic nodes. First, our previous Automatic Anatomy Recognition (AAR) approach is modified where lymph node zones predominantly following International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) specifications are modeled as objects arranged in a hierarchy along with key anatomic anchor objects. This fuzzy anatomy model built from diagnostic CT images is then deployed on PET/CT images for automatically recognizing the zones. A novel globular filter (g-filter) to detect blob-like objects over a specified range of sizes is designed to detect the most likely locations and sizes of diseased nodes. Abnormal nodes within each automatically localized zone are subsequently detected via combined use of different items of information at various scales: lymph node zone model poses found at recognition indicating the geographic layout at the global level of node clusters, g-filter response which hones in on and carefully selects node-like globular objects at the node level, and CT and PET gray value but within only the most plausible nodal regions for node presence at the voxel level. The models are built from 25 diagnostic CT scans and refined for an object hierarchy based on a separate set of 20 diagnostic CT scans. Node detection is tested on an additional set of 20 PET/CT scans. Our preliminary results indicate node detection sensitivity and specificity at around 90% and 85%, respectively.\n\nPelvic lymph node dissection in early ovarian cancer: success of retrieval of lymph nodes by individual lymph node groups in respect to pelvic laterality.\n\nPubMed\n\nMujezinoviÄ, Faris; Takac, Iztok\n\n2010-08-01\n\nTo evaluate the differences in number of harvested retroperitoneal pelvic lymph nodes by specific lymph node regions in respect to pelvic laterality. We extracted cases of early ovarian cancer (EOC) with lymphadenectomy from the medical database which were treated at our institution in the period between 1994 and 2008. Recommendations of FIGO and EGSOC (European Guidelines for Staging in Ovarian Cancer) for staging of ovarian malignancies were followed. Stage of the disease was established on the basis of intra-abdominal condition which we found during surgery and histopathologic status of retroperitoneal lymph nodes (LN). For each case and every LN group, we subtracted the number of dissected lymph nodes on the left side from the number of dissected lymph nodes on the right side of the pelvis. The result would represent the difference between number of removed LN on each side of the pelvis for specific LN group. A negative difference means that a greater number of LN was extracted from the left side and a positive difference that the greater number of LN was extracted from the right side of the pelvis. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical analysis of differences. 48 cases with EOC underwent lymphadenectomy. In three cases, metastatic retroperitoneal pelvic lymph nodes were found. There were 79.1%, 50.0%, 45.8%, 93.8%, 52.1%, 60.4% and 70.8% of cases with left-right difference in number of removed lymph nodes in external iliac region, common iliac region, presacralic, above obturator nerve, under obturator nerve, lateral from the external ilac vessels and lateral from the common iliac vessels nodal group, respectively. The mean differences between left and right groups were in the range from 2 to 4 lymph nodes. There was no identifiable bias toward either side of the pelvis for any of the analyzed lymph node groups. There is a right and left prevalence of retrieved LN by individual LN regions in the pelvis that could be influenced by asymmetry in right\n\nCancer and lymph nodes\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... page, please enable JavaScript.

We examined the long-term results of omission of axillary dissection in sentinel lymph node-negative patients treated at our hospital, as well as their axillary lymph node recurrence characteristics and outcomes. Our study included 2,578 patients with cTis or T1-T3N0M0 primary breast cancer for whom dissection was omitted because they were sentinel lymph node negative. The median observation period was 75 months. In sentinel lymph node-negative patients for whom dissection was omitted, the rates of axillary lymph node recurrence, distant recurrence, and breast cancer mortality were 0.9, 2, and 1 %, respectively. Eighteen patients underwent additional dissection if axillary lymph node recurrence was observed at the first recurrence. Four triple-negative (TN) patients experienced distant recurrence after additional dissection. All four patients were administered anticancer agents after axillary lymph node recurrence and experienced recurrence within 1 year of additional dissection. The axillary lymph node recurrence rate was 0.8 % for luminal and 4.5 % for TN subtypes. The long-term prognoses of patients for whom dissection was omitted owing to negative sentinel lymph node metastases were similar to those reported previously-low recurrence and mortality rates. The frequency of axillary lymph node recurrence and the post-recurrence outcome differed between luminal and TN cases, with recurrence being more frequent in patients with the TN subtype. TN patients also had poorer prognoses, even after receiving additional dissection and anticancer agents after recurrence.\n\nFactors affecting sentinel lymph node metastasis in Turkish breast cancer patients: Predictive value of Ki-67 and the size of lymph node.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzemir, I A; Orhun, K; Eren, T; Baysal, H; Sagiroglu, J; Leblebici, M; Ceyran, A B; Alimoglu, O\n\nWe aimed to analyze the factors that affect the axillary lymph node involvement in Turkish breast cancer patients with clinically non-palpable axillary lymph node. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the gold standard technique to evaluate the axillary lymph node status that directly influences the prognosis and the treatment options in breast cancer. Breast cancer patients without axillary lymph node involvement in clinic examination were enrolled the study. Patients were categorized into the two groups according to existence of axillary lymph node metastasis or not. Demographic, histopathological and clinical data of patients were revealed retrospectively. One-hundred and eighty-seven patients were analyzed and 101 of patients fulfilled the criteria and were included the study. Metastatic lymph node was detected in 38 (37.6 %) patients (Group 1), and was negative in 63 (62.4 %) patients (Group 2). Sentinel lymph node metastasis were statistically significant higher in patients with Ki-67 â¥ 14 % than patients with Ki-67 < 14 % (51.9 % vs 22.4 %; p < 0.01). Likewise, the mean size of the sentinel lymph node was statistically significant higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (p < 0.01). Ki-67 proliferation index and sentinel lymph node size may provide a higher prediction about the sentinel lymph node involvement in patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 31).\n\nSentinel Lymph Nodes for Breast Carcinoma A Paradigm Shift\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMaguire, Aoife; Brogi, Edi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nContext Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been established as the new standard of care for axillary staging in most patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Historically, all patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy result underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Recent trials show that axillary lymph node dissection can be safely omitted in women with clinically node negative, T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast radiotherapy. This change in practice also has implications on the pathologic examination and reporting of sentinel lymph nodes. Objective To review recent clinical and pathologic studies of sentinel lymph nodes and explore how these findings influence the pathologic evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes. Data Sources Sources were published articles from peer-reviewed journals in PubMed (US National Library of Medicine) and published guidelines from the American Joint Committee on Cancer, the Union for International Cancer Control, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Conclusions The main goal of sentinel lymph node examination should be to detect all macrometastases (>2 mm). Grossly sectioning sentinel lymph nodes at 2-mm intervals and evaluation of one hematoxylin-eosinâstained section from each block is the preferred method of pathologic evaluation. Axillary lymph node dissection can be safely omitted in clinically node-negative patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes, as well as in a selected group of patients with limited sentinel lymph node involvement. The pathologic features of the primary carcinoma and its sentinel lymph node metastases contribute to estimate the extent of nonâsentinel lymph node involvement. This information is important to decide on further axillary treatment.

A sentinel lymph node biopsy database containing 455 breast cancer patients admitted between July 2005 and February 2012 at Beijing Cancer Hospital was analyzed retrospectively. The patients had â¤ 2 positive sentinel lymph node and complete axillary lymph node dissection. The SLNSâº/SLNS ratio (P = 0.001), histological grade (P = 0.075), size of mass (P = 0.023) and onset age (P = 0.074) were correlated with NSLN metastases. Only SLNSâº/SLNS (OR 0.502 95% CI 0.322-0.7844) , histological grade ratio (histological grade ratio II, III and others vs grade I OR 2.696, 2.102, 3.662) were significant independent predictors for NSLN metastases . The ROC value was 0.62 (0.56, 0.68). For â¤ 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer, ratio of SLNSâº/SLNS and histological grading are independent factors affecting NSLN metastases. However, the results remain unsatisfactory for predicting the status of NSLN.\n\nLymph Node Size on Computed Tomography Images Is a Predictive Indicator for Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Colorectal Neuroendocrine Tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanaka, Toshiaki; Nozawa, Hiroaki; Kawai, Kazushige; Hata, Keisuke; Kiyomatsu, Tomomichi; Nishikawa, Takeshi; Otani, Kensuke; Sasaki, Kazuhito; Murono, Koji; Watanabe, Toshiaki\n\n2017-01-01\n\nColorectal neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a rare manifestation of colorectal neoplasia, requiring for radical dissection of the regional lymph nodes along with colorectal resection similar to that required for colorectal cancer. However, thus far, no reports have described the ability of computed tomography (CT) to predict lymph node involvement. In this study, we revealed the prediction rate of lymph node metastasis using contrast-enhanced CT. A total of 21 patients with colorectal NET undergoing colorectal resection were recruited from January 2010 to June 2016. We compared the CT findings between samples with or without pathologically proven lymph node metastasis, in each field (pericolic/perirectal and intermediate nodes). Within the pericolic/perirectal field, any lymph node larger than 5 mm in the CT images was a predictive indicator of lymph node metastasis with a sensitivity, specificity, and area under ROC curve (AUC) of 66.7%, 87.5%, and 0.844, respectively. Within the intermediate field, any visible lymph node on the CT was a predictive indicator of lymph node metastasis with a sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 100%, 76.4%, and 0.890, respectively. In addition, when we observed lymph nodes larger than 3 mm on the CT images, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 82.4%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.8971. CT images provide predictive information for lymph node metastasis with a high rate of accuracy. CopyrightÂ© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

From 2002 to 2012, patients with melanoma measuring â¥4 mm in thickness were evaluated at a single institution. Associations between survival and clinicopathologic characteristics were explored. Of 571 patients with melanomas measuring â¥4 mm in thickness and no distant metastases, the median age was 66 years and 401 patients (70.2%) were male. The median Breslow thickness was 6.2 mm; the predominant subtype was nodular (45.4%). SLNB was performed in 412 patients (72%) whereas 46 patients (8.1%) presented with clinically lymph node-positive disease and 113 patients (20%) did not undergo SLNB. A positive SLN was found in 161 of 412 patients (39.1%). For SLNB performed at the study institution, 14 patients with a negative SLNB developed disease recurrence in the mapped lymph node basin (false-negative rate, 12.3%). The median disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) for the entire cohort were 62.1 months, 42.5 months, and 21.2 months, respectively. The DSS and OS for patients with a negative SLNB were 82.4 months and 53.4 months, respectively; 41.2 months and 34.7 months, respectively, for patients with positive SLNB; and 26.8 months and 22 months, respectively, for patients with clinically lymph node-positive disease (P<.0001). The median RFS was 32.4 months for patients who were SLNB negative, 14.3 months for patients who were SLNB positive, and 6.8 months for patients with clinically lymph node-positive disease (P<.0001). With an acceptably low false-negative rate, patients with thick melanoma and a negative SLNB appear to have significantly prolonged RFS, DSS, and OS compared with those with a positive SLNB. Therefore, SLNB should be considered as indicated for patients with thick, clinically lymph node-negative melanoma\n\nLocalization of antigen-specific lymphocytes following lymph node challenge.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, H; Splitter, G A\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe effect of subcutaneous injections of Brucella abortus strain 19 antigen on the specific localization of autologous lymphocytes in the regional nodes of calves was analysed by fluorescent labelling and flow cytometry. Both in vitro and in vivo FITC labelling of lymphocytes indicated the preferential migration of lymphocytes from a previously challenged lymph node to a recently challenged lymph node. However, lymphocytes from a lymph node challenged with B. abortus failed to localize preferentially in a lymph node challenged with a control antigen, Listeria monocytogenes. Lymph node cells, enriched for T lymphocytes and isolated from primary stimulated or secondary challenged B. abortus lymph nodes, could proliferate when cultured with autologous antigen-pulsed macrophages. The kinetics of [3H]thymidine incorporation in lymphocytes from secondarily challenged lymph nodes occurred earlier and to a greater extent when compared with lymphocytes from primary challenged lymph nodes. Our data show that the accumulation of B. abortus-specific lymphocytes in secondarily challenged lymph nodes is increased by the presence of the specific antigen.

Prospectively accrued data were retrospectively analyzed for 282 PDAC patients who had pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) at our institution. Long-term survival was analyzed according to the ELN, PLN, LNR, and LODDS. Of these patients, 168 patients (59.5Â %) had LN metastasis (N1). Mean ELN and PLN were 13.5 and 1.6, respectively. LN positivity correlated with a greater number of evaluated lymph nodes; positive lymph nodes were identified in 61.4Â % of the patients with ELNââ¥â13 compared with 44.9Â % of the patients with ELNâ<â13 (pâ=â0.014). Median overall survival (OS) and 5-year OS rate were higher in N0 than in N1 patients, 22.4 vs. 18.7Â months and 35 vs. 11Â %, respectively (pâ=â0.008). Mean LNR was 0.12; 91 patients (54.1Â %) had LNRâ<â0.3. Among the N1 patients, median OS was comparable in those with LNRââ¥â0.3 vs. LNRâ<â0.3 (16.7 vs. 14.1Â months, pâ=â0.950). Neither LODDS nor various ELN and PLN cutoff values provided more discriminative information within the group of N1 patients. Our data confirms that lymph node positivity strongly reflects PDAC biology and thus patient outcome. While a higher number of evaluated lymph nodes may provide a more accurate nodal staging, it does not have any prognostic value among N1 patients. Similarly, PLN, LNR, and LODDS had limited prognostic relevance.\n\nHigh-frequency Ultrasound Imaging of Mouse Cervical Lymph Nodes.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalk, Elyse L; McLaughlin, Sarah L; Weed, Scott A\n\n2015-07-25\n\nHigh-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) is widely employed as a non-invasive method for imaging internal anatomic structures in experimental small animal systems. HFUS has the ability to detect structures as small as 30 Âµm, a property that has been utilized for visualizing superficial lymph nodes in rodents in brightness (B)-mode. Combining power Doppler with B-mode imaging allows for measuring circulatory blood flow within lymph nodes and other organs. While HFUS has been utilized for lymph node imaging in a number of mouseÂ model systems, a detailed protocol describing HFUS imaging and characterization of the cervical lymph nodes in mice has not been reported. Here, we show that HFUS can be adapted to detect and characterize cervical lymph nodes in mice. Combined B-mode and power Doppler imaging can be used to detect increases in blood flow in immunologically-enlarged cervical nodes. We also describe the use of B-mode imaging to conduct fine needle biopsies of cervical lymph nodes to retrieve lymph tissue for histologicalÂ analysis. Finally, software-aided steps are described to calculate changes in lymph node volume and to visualize changes in lymph node morphology following image reconstruction. The ability to visually monitor changes in cervical lymph node biology over time provides a simple and powerful technique for the non-invasive monitoring of cervical lymph node alterations in preclinical mouse models of oral cavity disease.\n\nRepeat sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with ipsilateral recurrent breast cancer after breast-conserving therapy and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy: a prospective study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFolli, Secondo; Falco, Giuseppe; Mingozzi, Matteo; Buggi, Federico; Curcio, Annalisa; Ferrari, Guglielmo; Taffurelli, Mario; Regolo, Lea; Nanni, Oriana\n\n2016-04-01\n\nPatients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence or new ipsilateral primary tumor after previous breast conservative surgery with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy need a new axillary staging procedure. However, the best surgical option, i.e. repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection, is still debated. Purpose of the study is to assess the performance of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy. In a multicenter study, lymph node biopsy completed by back-up axillary lymph node dissection was undertaken for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence or new ipsilateral primary tumor. Tracer uptake was used to identify and isolate the sentinel lymph node during surgery, and it was classified after staining with hematoxylin and eosin and monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibodies. Aside from negative predictive value, overall accuracy and false-negative rate of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy were assessed. A multicenter, prospective study was conducted performing 30 repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy completed by back-up axillary lymph node dissection for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence or new ipsilateral primary tumor in patients formerly treated with previous breast conservative surgery and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy. Negative predictive value, overall accuracy and false-negative rate of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy were assessed. Sentinel lymph nodes were mapped in 27 patients out of 30 (90%). Aberrant drainage pathways were observed in one patient (3.7%). Tracer uptake was sufficient to identify and isolate the sentinel lymph node during surgery in 23 cases (76.6%); the patients in whom lymphoscintigraphy failed or no sentinel lymph nodes could be isolated underwent axillary lymph node dissection. The negative predictive value was 95.2%, the accuracy was 95.6% and the false-negative rate was 33%. Repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy is feasible and accurate, with a high negative predictive value.

Lymph nodes have thus become critical targets for new vaccines and immunotherapies. A recent strategy for targeting these tissues is direct lymph node injection of soluble vaccine components, and clinical trials involving this technique have been promising. Several biomaterial strategies have also been investigated to improve lymph node targeting, for example, tuning particle size for optimal drainage of biomaterial vaccine particles. In this paper we present a new method that combines direct lymph node injection with biodegradable polymer particles that can be laden with antigen, adjuvant, or other vaccine components. In this method polymeric microparticles or nanoparticles are synthesized by a modified double emulsion protocol incorporating lipid stabilizers. Particle properties (e.g. size, cargo loading) are confirmed by laser diffraction and fluorescent microscopy, respectively. Mouse lymph nodes are then identified by peripheral injection of a nontoxic tracer dye that allows visualization of the target injection site and subsequent deposition of polymer particles in lymph nodes. This technique allows direct control over the doses and combinations of biomaterials and vaccine components delivered to lymph nodes and could be harnessed in the development of new biomaterial-based vaccines.\n\nCervical lymph node diseases in children\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLang, Stephan; Kansy, Benjamin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe lymph nodes are an essential part of the bodyâs immune system and as such are affected in many infectious, autoimmune, metabolic and malignant diseases. The cervical lymph nodes are particularly important because they are the first drainage stations for key points of contact with the outside world (mouth/throat/nose/eyes/ears/respiratory system) â a critical aspect especially among children â and can represent an early clinical sign in their exposed position on a childâs slim neck. Involvement of the lymph nodes in multiple conditions is accompanied by a correspondingly large number of available diagnostic procedures. In the interests of time, patient wellbeing and cost, a careful choice of these must be made to permit appropriate treatment. The basis of diagnostic decisions is a detailed anamnesis and clinical examination. Sonography also plays an important role in differential diagnosis of lymph node swelling in children and is useful in answering one of the critical diagnostic questions: is there a suspicion of malignancy? If so, full dissection of the most conspicuous lymph node may be necessary to obtain histological confirmation. Diagnosis and treatment of childhood cervical lymph node disorders present the attending pediatric and ENT physicians with some particular challenges. The spectrum of differential diagnoses and the varying degrees of clinical relevance â from banal infections to malignant diseases â demand a clear and considered approach to the childâs individual clinical presentation. Such an approach is described in the following paper.

Material/Methods Patients with pathological stage III colon cancer were retrospectively evaluated for: age; preoperative values of Crp, Cea, Ca 19-9, and Afp; pathologic situation of vascular, perineural, lymphatic, and serosal involvement; and metastatic lymph node ratio values were calculated. Results The study included 58 stage III colon cancer patients: 20 (34.5%) females and 38 (65.5%) males were involved in the study. Multivariate analysis was applied to the following variables to evaluate significance for overall survival and disease-free survival: age, Crp, Cea, perineural invasion, and metastatic lymph node ratio. The metastatic lymph node ratio (<0.25 or â¥0.25) is the only independent variable significant for overall and disease-free survival. Conclusions Metastatic lymph node ratio is an ideal prognostic marker for stage III colon cancer patients, and 0.25 is the cut-off value for prognosis.

Lymph node biopsies from 37 patients, who were tested for toxoplasmosis by serologic and isolation studies, were examined. A characteristic pattern of sinus histiocytosis was seen in 17 of 18 posterior cervical nodes and in only 1 of 4 lymph nodes from other sites from patients with toxoplasmosis. The characteristic pattern was not seen in posterior cervical nodes or in lymph nodes from other sites from patients with other diseases. Lymphoma obscured the characteristic changes of toxoplasmosis in the posterior cervical nodes and other nodes of 5 patients with these coexisting diseases. Organisms were seen in tissue sections in only 2 instances. T gondii was isolated from mice in 14 of 17 attempts using nodes from patients with toxoplasmosis, but from none of 8 attempts using nodes from patients with other diseases.\n\nEarly diagnosis of lymph node metastasis: Importance of intranodal pressures.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiura, Yoshinobu; Mikada, Mamoru; Ouchi, Tomoki; Horie, Sachiko; Takeda, Kazu; Yamaki, Teppei; Sakamoto, Maya; Mori, Shiro; Kodama, Tetsuya\n\n2016-03-01\n\nRegional lymph node status is an important prognostic indicator of tumor aggressiveness. However, early diagnosis of metastasis using intranodal pressure, at a stage when lymph node size has not changed significantly, has not been investigated. Here, we use an MXH10/Mo-lpr/lpr mouse model of lymph node metastasis to show that intranodal pressure increases in both the subiliac lymph node and proper axillary lymph node, which are connected by lymphatic vessels, when tumor cells are injected into the subiliac lymph node to induce metastasis to the proper axillary lymph node. We found that intranodal pressure in the subiliac lymph node increased at the stage when metastasis was detected by in vivo bioluminescence, but when proper axillary lymph node volume (measured by high-frequency ultrasound imaging) had not increased significantly. Intravenously injected liposomes, encapsulating indocyanine green, were detected in solid tumors by in vivo bioluminescence, but not in the proper axillary lymph node. Basic blood vessel and lymphatic channel structures were maintained in the proper axillary lymph node, although sinus histiocytosis was detected. These results show that intranodal pressure in the proper axillary lymph node increases at early stages when metastatic tumor cells have not fully proliferated. Intranodal pressure may be a useful parameter for facilitating early diagnosis of lymph node metastasis. Â© 2015 The Authors.

Ultrasound proved to be useful to assess canine medial iliac lymph nodes. An increase in size or number of detected lymph nodes or finding rounder or heterogeneous lymph nodes could differentiate lymph nodes of dogs of the control group from lymph nodes of dogs with lymphoma or an adenocarcinoma of the apocrine glands of the anal sac. Subcategories of malignancy could not be differentiated. More studies need to be performed, both with patients with reactive lymph nodes and also focusing on other canine superficial lymph nodes, before generalizing the results of this study to other areas or diseases.\n\nSentinel lymph node biopsy under fluorescent indocyanin green guidance: Initial experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nAydoÄan, Fatih; ArÄ±kan, Akif Enes; AytaÃ§, Erman; VelidedeoÄlu, Mehmet; YÄ±lmaz, Mehmet Halit; Sager, Muhammet Sait; Ãelik, Varol; Uras, Cihan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSentinel lymph node biopsy can be applied by using either blue dye or radionuclide method or both in breast cancer. Fluorescent imaging with indocyanine green is a new defined method. This study evaluates the applicability of sentinel lymph node biopsy via fluorescent indocyanine green. IC-VIEW (Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany) infrared visualization system was used for imaging. Two mL of indocyanine green was injected to visualize sentinel lymph nodes. After injection, subcutaneous lymphatics were traced and sentinel lymph nodes were found with simultaneous imaging. Sentinel lymph nodes were excised under fluorescent light guidance, and excised lymph nodes were examined histopathologically. Patients with sentinel lymph node metastases underwent axillary dissection. Four patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy due to breast cancer were included in the study. Sentinel lymph nodes were visualized with indocyanine green in all patients. The median number of excised sentinel lymph node was 2 (2-3). Two patients with lymph node metastasis underwent axillary dissection. No metastasis was detected in lymph nodes other than the sentinel nodes in patients with axillary dissection. There was no complication during and after the operation related to the method. According to our limited experience, sentinel lymph node biopsy under fluorescent indocyanine green guidance, which has an advantage of simultaneous visualization, is technically feasible.\n\nLymph node clearance of plutonium from subcutaneous wounds in beagles\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDagle, G.E.\n\n1973-08-01\n\nThe lymph node clearance of /sup 239/Pu O/sub 2/ administered as insoluble particles from subcutaneous implants was studied in adult beagles to simulate accidental contamination of hand wounds. External scintillation data were collected from the popliteal lymph nodes of each dog after 9.2 to 39.4 mu Ci of plutonium oxide was subcutaneously implanted into the left or right hind paws. The left hind paw was armputated 4 weeks after implantation to prevent continued deposition of plutonium oxide particles in the left popliteal lymph node. Groups of 3 dogs were sacrificed 4, 8, 16, and 32 weeks after plutonium implantation formoreÂ Â» histopathologic, electron microscopic, and radiochemical analysis of regional lymph nodes. An additional group of dogs received treatment with the chelating agent diethyenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). Plutonium rapidly accumulated in the popliteal lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection into the hind paw, and 1 to 10% of the implant dose was present in the popliteal lymph nodes at the time of necropsy. Histopathologic changes in the popliteal lymph nodes with plutonium particles were characterized primarily by reticular cell hyperplasia, increased numbers of macrophages, necrosis, and fibroplasia. Eventually, the plutonium particles became sequestered by scar tissue that often replaced the entire architecture of the lymph node. Light microscopic autoradiographs of the popliteal lymph nodes showed a time-related increase in number of alpha tracks per plutonium source. Electron microscopy showed that the plutonium particles were aggregated in phagolysosomes of macrophages. There was slight clearance of plutonium from the popliteal lymph nodes of dogs monitored for 32 weeks. The clearance of plutonium particles from the popliteal lymph nodes was associated with necrosis of macrophages. The external iliac lymph nodes contained fewer plutonium particles than the popliteal lymph nodes and histopathologic changes were less severe.

Methods: A total of 90 patients with synchronous ISLM without distant metastasis between 2000 and 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups, namely supraclavicular lymph node dissection group(34 patients) and non-dissection group(56 patients), according to whether they underwentsupraclavicular lymph node dissection or not.The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to analyze the locoregional relapse free survival (LRFS) and overall survival(OS).

Most of gastric cancer patients present with lymph node metastasis when they were initially diagnosed or underwent surgical resection, which results in poor prognosis. Both the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node involvement are considered as the most important prognostic predictors of gastric cancer. Although extended lymphadenectomy was not considered a survival benefit procedure and was reported to be associated with high mortality and morbidity in two randomized controlled European trials, it showed significant superiority in terms of lower locoregional recurrence and disease related deaths compared to limited lymphadenectomy in a 15-year follow-up study. Almost all clinical investigators have reached a consensus that the predictive efficiency of the number of metastatic lymph nodes is far better than the extent of lymph node metastasis for the prognosis of gastric cancer worldwide, but other nodal metastatic classifications of gastric cancer have been proposed as alternatives to the number of metastatic lymph nodes for improving the predictive efficiency for patient prognosis. It is still controversial over whether the ratio between metastatic and examined lymph nodes is superior to the number of metastatic lymph nodes in prognostic evaluation of gastric cancer. Besides, the negative lymph node count has been increasingly recognized to be an important factor significantly associated with prognosis of gastric cancer.

The introduction of this procedure in 1992 would not have been possible without the pioneering discoveries regarding lymph nodes and cancer. The Italian surgeon Gaspar Asellius (1581-1626) visualized the lymphatic vessels of a dog after it had been fed and shortly before dissection. At the end of the 17th century, the French anatomists Lauth and Sappey visualized the lymphatics by injecting deceased criminals with mercury. In 1858, the German pathologist Virchow (1821-1902) launched the theory that lymph nodes act as defensive barriers. He also made the first microscopical illustration ofa sentinel lymph node. Gould et al. and CabaÃ£s independently launched the precursors of the current modern sentinel lymph node concept in 1959 and 1977 respectively. Gould et al. were the first people to use the term \"sentinel node'. CabaÃ±as used lymphangiography for the visualisation of the sentinel lymph node. Controversies about the barrier function of the lymph nodes, the fear of skip metastasis and the difficulties of performing the CabaÃ±as procedure, prevented a breakthrough of this concept. In 1992 Morton et al. rediscovered the valuable sentinel node biopsy concept and introduced blue dye for the investigation of patients with melanoma. The combination of lymphoscintigraphy, intra-operative gamma probe guidance and patent blue further increased the reliability of the sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure. Unnecessary lymph gland dissection procedures with considerable morbidity can be prevented by this procedure.\n\nCorrelation of cytologic and histopathologic findings with perinodal echogenicity of abdominal lymph nodes in dogs and cats.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavÃ©, Aditya C; Zekas, Lisa J; Auld, Danelle M\n\n2017-07-01\n\nAbdominal lymphadenopathy in dogs and cats is routinely investigated with ultrasound. As the determination between benign and neoplastic etiologies of lymphadenopathy affects patient management, specific sonographic characteristics associated with both benign and neoplastic lymph nodes have been suggested. However, a significant overlap between these characteristics exists, necessitating a cytologic or histopathologic diagnosis in most instances. The objectives of this retrospective, cross-sectional study were to evaluate whether echogenicity of perinodal fat could be a discriminator between benign and neoplastic abdominal lymphadenopathy and to assess if additional sonographic features associated with malignancy could be identified in lymph nodes with hyperechoic perinodal fat. Small animal patients (257 dogs and 117 cats) with sonographic evidence of abdominal lymphadenopathy and a cytological or histopathological diagnosis were evaluated for differences in the proportions of sonographic features between benign and neoplastic groups. Greater maximum long axis diameter (in dogs and cats) and a greater number of abnormal lymph nodes (in cats) were associated with malignancy in lymph nodes with hyperechoic perinodal fat. Canine lymph nodes with round cell neoplasia were significantly more likely to have hyperechoic perinodal fat. Lymph nodes affected with other neoplasia or with lymphadenitis were equally likely to have normal or hyperechoic perinodal fat. Reactive lymph nodes were significantly less likely to have hyperechoic perinodal fat in both species. These results suggest that though echogenicity of perinodal fat is a nonspecific finding, abdominal lymph nodes with hyperechoic perinodal fat are less likely to be reactive and sampling of these lymph nodes may be indicated.

The principle of sentinel lymph node biopsy relies on removal of a small number of lymph nodes that are the first drainage basins from a tumor and thus the most likely to harbor tumor cells. While the procedure may reduce morbidity, efficacy data are limited and little is known about how commonly the procedure is performed. We examined the patterns and predictors of use of sentinel lymph node biopsy and outcomes of the procedure in women with endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy. We used the Perspective database to identify women with uterine cancer who underwent hysterectomy from 2011 through 2015. Billing and charge codes were used to classify women as having undergone lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, or no nodal assessment. Multivariable models were used to examine clinical, demographic, and hospital characteristics with use of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Length of stay and cost were compared among the different methods of nodal assessment. Among 28,362 patients, 9327 (32.9%) did not undergo nodal assessment, 17,669 (62.3%) underwent lymphadenectomy, and 1366 (4.8%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 1.3% (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6%) of abdominal hysterectomies, 3.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.7-4.1%) of laparoscopic hysterectomies, and 7.5% (95% confidence interval, 7.0-8.0%) of robotic-assisted hysterectomies. In a multivariable model, more recent year of surgery was associated with performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Compared to abdominal hysterectomy, those undergoing laparoscopic (adjusted risk ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-3.18) and robotic-assisted (adjusted risk ratio, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 2.19-3.30) hysterectomy were more likely to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy.

A solution of 25 mg indocyanine green in 5 ml sterile water was transperineally injected. Pelvic lymph node dissection was started with the indocyanine green stained nodes followed by extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and likelihood ratio of a negative test of indocyanine green guided pelvic lymph node dissection. A total of 84 patients with a median age of 63.55 years and a median prostate specific antigen of 8.48 ng/ml were included in the study. Of these patients 60.7% had intermediate risk disease and 25% had high or very high risk disease. A median of 7 indocyanine green stained nodes per patient was detected (range 2 to 18) with a median of 22 nodes excised during extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Lymph node metastasis was identified in 25 patients, 23 of whom had disease properly classified by indocyanine green guided pelvic lymph node dissection. The most frequent location of indocyanine green stained nodes was the proximal internal iliac artery followed by the fossa of Marcille. The negative predictive value was 96.7% and the likelihood ratio of a negative test was 8%. Overall 1,856 nodes were removed and 603 were stained indocyanine green. Pathological examination revealed 82 metastatic nodes, of which 60% were indocyanine green stained. The negative predictive value was 97.4% but the likelihood ratio of a negative test was 58.5%. Indocyanine green guided pelvic lymph node dissection correctly staged 97% of cases. However, according to our data it cannot replace extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Nevertheless, its high negative predictive value could allow us to avoid extended pelvic lymph node dissection if we had an accurate intraoperative lymph\n\nComparative study between ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of axillary lymph nodes and sentinel lymph node histopathology in early-stage breast cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCardoso-Coelho, LÃ­vio Portela; Borges, Rafael Soares; Alencar, Airlane Pereira; Cardoso-Campos-Verdes, Larysse Maira; da Silva-Sampaio, JoÃ£o Paulo; Borges, Umbelina Soares; Gebrim, Luiz Henrique; da Silva, Benedito Borges\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe replacement of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-guided FNA) cytology of axillary lymph nodes is controversial, despite the simplicity and reduced cost of the latter. In the present study, US-guided FNA was performed in 27 patients with early-stage breast cancer for comparison with SNB. Data were analyzed by calculation of sample proportions. Tumor subtypes included invasive ductal carcinoma (85%), invasive lobular carcinoma (7%), and tubular and metaplastic carcinoma (4%). FNA had a sensitivity of 45%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 73%. Axillary lymph node cytology obtained by US guided-FNA in patients with breast cancer had a specificity similar to that of sentinel lymph node histopathology in the presence of axillary node metastases. However, when lymph node cytology is negative, it does not exclude the existence of metastatic implants, due to its low sensitivity in comparison to sentinel lymph node histopathology.

The usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy in this situation is uncertain. This study evaluated the outcomes of sentinel biopsy-guided decisions in patients who had conversion of axillary nodes from clinically positive to negative following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We reviewed the records of 1247 patients from five hospitals in Korea who had breast cancer with clinically axillary lymph node-positive status and negative conversion after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, between 2005 and 2012. Patients who underwent axillary operations with sentinel biopsy-guided decisions (Group A) were compared with patients who underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection without sentinel lymph node biopsy (Group B). Axillary node recurrence and distant recurrence-free survival were compared. There were 428 cases in Group A and 819 in Group B. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that recurrence-free survivals were not significantly different between Groups A and B (4-year axillary recurrence-free survival: 97.8 vs. 99.0%; pÂ =Â 0.148). Multivariate analysis also indicated the two groups had no significant difference in axillary and distant recurrence-free survival. For breast cancer patients who had clinical conversion of axillary lymph nodes from positive to negative following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, sentinel biopsy-guided axillary surgery, and axillary lymph node dissection without sentinel lymph node biopsy had similar rates of recurrence. Thus, sentinel biopsy-guided axillary operation in breast cancer patients who have clinically axillary lymph node positive to negative conversion following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a useful strategy.\n\nAnatomical classification of breast sentinel lymph nodes using computed tomography-lymphography.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujita, Tamaki; Miura, Hiroyuki; Seino, Hiroko; Ono, Shuichi; Nishi, Takashi; Nishimura, Akimasa; Hakamada, Kenichi; Aoki, Masahiko\n\n2018-05-03\n\nTo evaluate the anatomical classification and location of breast sentinel lymph nodes, preoperative computed tomography-lymphography examinations were retrospectively reviewed for sentinel lymph nodes in 464 cases clinically diagnosed with node-negative breast cancer between July 2007 and June 2016. Anatomical classification was performed based on the numbers of lymphatic routes and sentinel lymph nodes, the flow direction of lymphatic routes, and the location of sentinel lymph nodes. Of the 464 cases reviewed, anatomical classification could be performed in 434 (93.5Â %). The largest number of cases showed single route/single sentinel lymph node (nÂ =Â 296, 68.2Â %), followed by multiple routes/multiple sentinel lymph nodes (nÂ =Â 59, 13.6Â %), single route/multiple sentinel lymph nodes (nÂ =Â 53, 12.2Â %), and multiple routes/single sentinel lymph node (nÂ =Â 26, 6.0Â %). Classification based on the flow direction of lymphatic routes showed that 429 cases (98.8Â %) had outward flow on the superficial fascia toward axillary lymph nodes, whereas classification based on the height of sentinel lymph nodes showed that 323 cases (74.4Â %) belonged to the upper pectoral group of axillary lymph nodes. There was wide variation in the number of lymphatic routes and their branching patterns and in the number, location, and direction of flow of sentinel lymph nodes. It is clinically very important to preoperatively understand the anatomical morphology of lymphatic routes and sentinel lymph nodes for optimal treatment of breast cancer, and computed tomography-lymphography is suitable for this purpose.\n\nThe association of exosomes with lymph nodes.\n\nPubMed\n\nHood, Joshua L\n\n2017-07-01\n\nCells produce extracellular nanovesicles known as exosomes that transport information between tissue microenvironments. Exosomes can engage and regulate the function of various immune cell types facilitating both normal and pathological processes. It follows that exosomes should also associate with lymph nodes containing immune cells. Herein, data derived from investigations that incorporate experiments pertaining to the trafficking of exosomes to lymph nodes is reviewed. Within lymph nodes, direct evidence demonstrates that exosomes associate with dendritic cells, subcapsular sinus macrophages, B lymphocytes and stromal cells. Interactions with endothelial cells are also likely. The functional significance of these associations depends on exosome type. Continued investigations into the relationship between exosomes and lymph nodes will further our understanding of how exosomes regulate immune cells subsets and may serve to inspire new exosome based therapeutics to treat a variety of diseases.

There have been few reports concerning elective irradiation of the ilioinguinal region. Between October 1964 and March 1980, 91 patients whose primary cancers placed the ilioinguinal lymph nodes at risk received elective irradiation at the University of Florida. Included are patients with cancers of the vulva, penis, urethra, anus and lower anal canal, and cervix or vaginal cancers that involved the distal one-third of the vagina. InmoreÂ Â» 81 patients, both inguinal areas were clinically negative; in 10 patients, one inguinal area was positive and the other negative by clinical examination. The single significant complication was a bilateral femoral neck fracture. The inguinal areas of four patients developed mild to moderate fibrosis. One patient with moderate fibrosis had bilateral mild leg edema that was questionably related to irradiation. Complications were dose-related. The advantages and dis-advantages of elective ilioinguinal node irradiation versus elective inguinal lymph node dissection or no elective treatment are discussed.Â«Â less\n\nLymph Node Micrometastases are Associated with Worse Survival in Patients with Otherwise Node-Negative Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nMantel, Hendrik T J; Wiggers, Jim K; Verheij, Joanne; Doff, Jan J; Sieders, Egbert; van Gulik, Thomas M; Gouw, Annette S H; Porte, Robert J\n\n2015-12-01\n\nLymph node metastases on routine histology are a strong negative predictor for survival after resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Additional immunohistochemistry can detect lymph node micrometastases in patients who are otherwise node negative, but the prognostic value is unsure. The objective of this study was to assess the effect on survival of immunohistochemically detected lymph node micrometastases in patients with node-negative (pN0) hilar cholangiocarcinoma on routine histology. Between 1990 and 2010, a total of 146 patients underwent curative-intent resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma with regional lymphadenectomy at two university medical centers in the Netherlands. Ninety-one patients (62 %) without lymph node metastases at routine histology were included. Micrometastases were identified by multiple sectioning of all lymph nodes and additional immunostaining with an antibody against cytokeratin 19 (K19). The association with overall survival was assessed in univariable and multivariable analysis. Median follow-up was 48 months. Micrometastases were identified in 16 (5 %) of 324 lymph nodes, corresponding to 11 (12 %) of 91 patients. There were no differences in clinical variables between K19 lymph node-positive and -negative patients. Five-year survival rates in patients with lymph node micrometastases were significantly lower compared to patients without micrometastases (27 vs. 54 %, P = 0.01). Multivariable analysis confirmed micrometastases as an independent prognostic factor for survival (adjusted Hazard ratio 2.4, P = 0.02). Lymph node micrometastases are associated with worse survival after resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical detection of lymph node micrometastases leads to better staging of patients who were initially diagnosed with node-negative (pN0) hilar cholangiocarcinoma on routine histology.\n\n[Anatomy and histology characteristics of lymph node in nude mice].\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, R; Gao, B; Guo, C B\n\n2017-10-18\n\nTo compare the differences of anatomical and histological characteristics of lymph nodes between BALB/c nude mice and BALB/c mice. Firstly, twenty BALB/c nude mice and twenty BALB/c mice were dissected by using a surgical microscope. Secondly, the differences of T cells and B cells at the lymph node were compared by the expressions of CD 3 and CD 20 immunohistochemistry dyes. There were, on average, 23 nodes per mouse contained within the large lymph node assembly in the BALB/c nude mouse. The anatomical features of the lymph node distribution in the nude mice were mainly found in the neck with relatively higher density. There were two lymph nodes both in the submandible lymph nodes group and in the superficial cervical lymph nodes group (the constituent ratios were 95% and 90%, respectively) in the BALB/c nude mice, but there were four lymph nodes (the constituent ratios were 95% and 90%, respectively) in the BALB/c mice. There were significant difference between the BALB/c nude mice and the BALB/c mice. Mostly there were two lymph nodes of deep cervical lymph nodes both in the BALB/c nude mice and the BALB/c mice (the constituent ratios were 95% and 100%, respectively). There were no significant difference between the BALB/c nude mice and the BALB/c mice. We confirmed that the number of CD 3 -positive T lymphocytes in lymph nodes of the nude mice decreased greatly as compared with the BALB/c mice. Expressions of CD3 in T cells were 95% and 100% in the BALB/c nude mice and in the BALB/c mice, respectively. There were significant differences between the BALB/c nude mice and the BALB/c mice. Expressions of CD20 in B cells were 95% and 100% in the BALB/c nude mice and in the BALB/c mice, respectively. There was no significant difference between the BALB/c nude mice and BALB/c mice. The anatomical pictures of lymph node distribution in the nude mouse will be benefit to those who are interested.

A single MR sequence lacks sufficient diagnostic information for lymph node localization and staging. Correct diagnosis often requires input from multiple complementary sequences which makes manual detection of lymph nodes very labor intensive. Small lymph nodes are often missed even by highly-trained radiologists. The proposed system is aimed at assisting radiologists in finding lymph nodes faster and more accurately. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such system reported in the literature. A 3-dimensional (3D) MR angiography (MRA) image is employed for extracting blood vessels that serve as a guide in searching for pelvic lymph nodes. Segmentation, shape and location analysis of potential lymph nodes are then performed using a high resolution 3D T1-weighted VIBE (T1-vibe) MR sequence acquired by Siemens 3T scanner. An optional contrast-agent enhanced MR image, such as post ferumoxtran-10 T2*-weighted MEDIC sequence, can also be incorporated to further improve detection accuracy of malignant nodes. The system outputs a list of potential lymph node locations that are overlaid onto the corresponding MR sequences and presents them to users with associated confidence levels as well as their sizes and lengths in each axis. Preliminary studies demonstrates the feasibility of automatic lymph node detection and scenarios in which this system may be used to assist radiologists in diagnosis and reporting.\n\nLymph Node Yield as a Predictor of Survival in Pathologically Node Negative Oral Cavity Carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nLemieux, Aaron; Kedarisetty, Suraj; Raju, Sharat; Orosco, Ryan; Coffey, Charles\n\n2016-03-01\n\nEven after a pathologically node-negative (pN0) neck dissection for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), patients may develop regional recurrence. In this study, we (1) hypothesize that an increased number of lymph nodes removed (lymph node yield) in patients with pN0 oral SCC predicts improved survival and (2) explore predictors of survival in these patients using a multivariable model. Case series with chart review. Administrative database analysis. The SEER database was queried for patients diagnosed with all-stage oral cavity SCC between 1988 and 2009 who were determined to be pN0 after elective lymph node dissection. Demographic and treatment variables were extracted. The association of lymph node yield with 5-year all-cause survival was studied with multivariable survival analyses. A total of 4341 patients with pN0 oral SCC were included in this study. The 2 highest lymph node yield quartiles (representing >22 nodes removed) were found to be significant predictors of overall survival (22-35 nodes: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.854, P = .031; 36-98 nodes: HR = 0.827, P = .010). Each additional lymph node removed during neck dissection was associated with increased survival (HR = 0.995, P = .022). These data suggest that patients with oral SCC undergoing elective neck dissection may experience an overall survival benefit associated with greater lymph node yield. Mechanisms behind the demonstrated survival advantage are unknown. Larger nodal dissections may remove a greater burden of microscopic metastatic disease, diminishing the likelihood of recurrence. Lymph node yield may serve as an objective measure of the adequacy of lymphadenectomy.

In 18 studies published about sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the sentinel node was identified in on average 89%, and the false-negative rate was on average 10%. Because of these mediocre results, no author dares to omit axillary clearance just yet. In our institute, sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience with this approach. Sentinel node biopsy was performed before neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 25 T2N0 patients by using lymphoscintigraphy, a gamma ray detection probe, and patent blue dye. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed after chemotherapy if the sentinel node contained metastases. Ten patients had a tumor-positive axillary sentinel node, and one patient had an involved lateral intramammary node. Four patients had additional involved nodes in the completion lymph node dissection specimen. The other 14 patients (56%) had a tumor-negative sentinel node and did not undergo axillary lymph node dissection. No recurrences have been observed after a median follow-up of 18 months. Fourteen (56%) of the 25 patients were spared axillary lymph node dissection when the sentinel node was found to be disease free. Performing sentinel node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems successful and reliable in patients with T2N0 breast cancer.\n\nFluorescence imaging to study cancer burden on lymph nodes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nD'Souza, Alisha V.; Elliott, Jonathan T.; Gunn, Jason R.; Samkoe, Kimberley S.; Tichauer, Kenneth M.; Pogue, Brian W.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nMorbidity and complexity involved in lymph node staging via surgical resection and biopsy calls for staging techniques that are less invasive. While visible blue dyes are commonly used in locating sentinel lymph nodes, since they follow tumor-draining lymphatic vessels, they do not provide a metric to evaluate presence of cancer. An area of active research is to use fluorescent dyes to assess tumor burden of sentinel and secondary lymph nodes. The goal of this work was to successfully deploy and test an intra-nodal cancer-cell injection model to enable planar fluorescence imaging of a clinically relevant blue dye, specifically methylene blue along with a cancer targeting tracer, Affibody labeled with IRDYE800CW and subsequently segregate tumor-bearing from normal lymph nodes. This direct-injection based tumor model was employed in athymic rats (6 normal, 4 controls, 6 cancer-bearing), where luciferase-expressing breast cancer cells were injected into axillary lymph nodes. Tumor presence in nodes was confirmed by bioluminescence imaging before and after fluorescence imaging. Lymphatic uptake from the injection site (intradermal on forepaw) to lymph node was imaged at approximately 2 frames/minute. Large variability was observed within each cohort.\n\n[Analysis of the patterns of cervical lymph node recurrence in patients with cN0 papillary thyroid carcinoma after central neck lymph node dissection].\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Hui; Xu, Zhengang; Wang, Xiaolei; Wu, Yuehuang; Liu, Shaoyan\n\n2015-10-01\n\nTo retrospectively analyze the long-term results of prophylactic central lymph node dissection in cN0 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and investigate the treatment method of the cervical lymph nodes for cN0 PTC. One hundred and thirty-six patients with cN0 PTC were treated by surgery at the Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from 2000 to 2006. Their clinicopathological characteristics, surgical procedures and survival outcomes were collected and analyzed. The occult lymph node metastasis rate in central compartment was 61.0%. The average number of positive lymph nodes was 2.47 (1-13), in which 54 patients had 1-2 and 29 patients had â¥ 3 positive lymph nodes. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age less than 45 (P=0.001, OR 3.571, 95% CI 1.681-7.587)and extracapsular spread (ECS) (P=0.015, OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.241-7.202)were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in the central compartment. The ten-year cumulative overall survival rate was 98.3% and cumulative lateral neck metastasis rate was 25.2%. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression model showed that ECS (P=0.001, OR 5.211, 95% CI1.884-14.411) and positive lymph nodes in the central compartment â¥ 3 (P=0.009, OR 4.005, 95% CI 1.419-11.307) were independent risk factors for lymph node recurrence in the lateral neck region. The distribution of recurrent lymph nodes: level IV (82.4%), level III (64.7%), level II (29.4%) and level V (11.8%). Routine central lymph node dissection, at least unilateral, should be conducted for cN0 papillary thyroid carcinoma. Attention should be paid to the treatment of lateral neck region in patients with cN0 papillary thyroid carcinoma. Selective neck dissection is suggested for cN0 PTC with ECS or positive central lymph nodes â¥ 3, or both. The range of dissection should include level III and IV at least.\n\nAssociation between expression of MMP-7 and MMP-9 and pelvic lymph node and para-aortic lymph node metastasis in early cervical cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Hui; Dai, Yifei; Wang, Anna; Wang, Chunyan; Sun, Lili; Wang, Zheng\n\n2018-05-16\n\nTo investigate the association of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 and MMP-9 with pelvic lymph node and para-aortic lymph node metastasis in early cervical cancer. A total of 137 patients with early cervical cancer (Stage Ia2-IIa2) were recruited from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tumor Hospital of Liaoning Province from January 2009 to May 2014. We evaluated the expression of MMP-7 and MMP-9 by immunohistochemistry and their association with the clinicopathological parameters such as pelvic, common iliac and para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Spearman correlation was performed to analyze the correlation between MMP-7 and MMP-9 in cervical cancer. Finally, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of MMP-7 and MMP-9 in pelvic lymph node metastasis were assessed. MMP-7 expression was significantly higher in patients with adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas (Pâ=â0.014), vascular cancer embolus (Pâ=â0.041), pelvic lymph node metastasis (Pâ=â0.000) and a higher level of Ki-67 (Pâ=â0.000). MMP-9 expression was significantly associated with vascular cancer embolus (Pâ=â0.003), depth of stromal invasion (Pâ=â0.001), pelvic lymph node metastasis (Pâ=â0.003), common iliac lymph node metastasis (Pâ=â0.001) and para-aortic lymph nodes metastasis (Pâ=â0.004). Coexpression of MMP-7 and MMP-9 was significantly associated with vascular cancer embolus (Pâ< 0.001), higher expression of Ki-67 (Pâ<â0.001) and pelvic lymph node metastasis (Pâ<â0.001). Spearman correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between MMP-7 and MMP-9 (râ=â0.263, Pâ=â0.002). Areas under the ROC of MMP-7 and MMP-9 were 0.707 and 0.646, respectively. MMP-7 and MMP-9 expressions were associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with early cervical cancers, suggesting a positive correlation of MMP-7 and MMP-9 with invasive potential in early cervical cancers.

In the current clinical workflow, the detection and assessment of lymph nodes is usually performed manually, which can be error-prone and timeconsuming. We therefore propose a method for the automatic detection of mediastinal, hilar, and intrapulmonary lymph node candidates in contrast-enhanced chest CT. Based on the segmentation of important mediastinal anatomy (bronchial tree, aortic arch) and making use of anatomical knowledge, we utilize Hessian eigenvalues to detect lymph node candidates. As lymph nodes can be characterized as blob-like structures of varying size and shape within a specific intensity interval, we can utilize these characteristics to reduce the number of false positive candidates significantly. We applied our method to 5 cases suspected to have lung cancer. The processing time of our algorithm did not exceed 6 minutes, and we achieved an average sensitivity of 82.1% and an average precision of 13.3%.\n\nPredictive Factors for Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Nomogram for Predicting Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRyu, Jai Min; Lee, Se Kyung; Kim, Ji Young; Yu, Jonghan; Kim, Seok Won; Lee, Jeong Eon; Han, Se Hwan; Jung, Yong Sik; Nam, Seok Jin\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAxillary lymph node (ALN) status is an important prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. With increasing numbers of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), issues concerning sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC have emerged. We analyzed the clinicopathologic features and developed a nomogram to predict the possibility of nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastases in patients with positive SLNs after NAC. A retrospective medical record review was performed of 140 patients who had had clinically positive ALNs at presentation, had a positive SLN after NAC on subsequent SLNB, and undergone axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) from 2008 toÂ 2014. On multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, pathologic T stage, lymphovascular invasion, SLN metastasis size, and number of positive SLN metastases were independent predictors for NSLN metastases (PÂ < .05). The NAC nomogram was based on these 4 variables. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.791 for the NAC nomogram. In the internal validation of performance, the AUCs for the training and test sets were 0.801 and 0.760, respectively. The nomogram was validated in an external patient cohort, with an AUC of 0.705. The Samsung Medical Center NAC nomogram was developed to predict the likelihood of additional positive NSLNs. The Samsung Medical Center NAC nomogram could provide information to surgeons regarding whether to perform additional ALND when the permanent biopsy revealed positive findings, although the intraoperative SLNB findings were negative.

This means that many cervical cancer patients will undergo pelvic lymphadenectomy as part of their treatment. Unfortunately, this procedure is associated with significant morbidity. Utilizing the sentinel lymph node technique for women with cervical cancer has the potential to decrease this morbidity. Multiple studies have suggested that sentinel lymph node mapping in these patients is feasible with excellent detection rates and sensitivity. This review examines the current body of literature regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy among women with cervical cancer.

However, there exist conflicting data on whether the removal of microscopic tumor metastasis in macroscopically unsuspicious retroperitoneal lymph nodes is beneficial. Ovarian cancer tissues and tissues from lymph node metastasis of 30 patients with FIGO IIIC or IV disease undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) were obtained and assessed using a validated regression score. Histopathological markers, size of largest tumor focus, and overall score were evaluated in lymph node and ovarian tissue. Regression and known prognostic factors were analyzed for influence on survival. No difference in the overall score between lymph nodes and ovarian tissue was shown, however, single parameters such as fibrosis and pattern of tumor infiltration, were significantly different. The pattern of tumor regression in lymph nodes and ovarian tissue are of prognostic value. Lymph node dissection even of unsuspicious nodes should, therefore, be performed.

Twenty-two patients with normal TMJs who underwent MRI examination at the authors' hospital from November to December 2014 were included as controls. MRI findings were compared between the 2 groups. MRI findings of RA in the TMJ included 1) abnormal disc position (95.2%), 2) abnormal disc morphology (83.3%), 3) joint effusion (30.9%), 4) osseous changes in the mandibular condyle (83.3%),Â 5) synovial proliferation (pannus; 85.7%), 6) erosion of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa (9.52%), 7) deformity of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa (16.6%), 8) abnormal bone marrow signal in the mandibular condyle (83.3%), and 9) swelling of lymph nodes in the parotid glands (78.5%). The abnormal bone marrow signal and pannus in the mandibular condyle and lymph node swelling in the parotid glands were markedly more common in patients with RA than in controls. MRI findings of RA of the TMJs were characterized by bone and soft tissue involvement, including abnormal bone marrow signal of the mandibular condyle, pannus, and swelling of lymph nodes in the parotid glands. These characteristic MRI findings could be useful in detecting RA in the TMJ in a clinical situation. Copyright Â© 2016 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

We compared all resections for primary colorectal cancer and rectal cancer (C 18-C20) performed in the Department of Surgery in University Hospital Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ© in the years 2005 and 2008 and we evaluated numbers of examined lymph nodes in the surgical specimens. The patients with recurrent tumours and the patients with complete pathological response (negative histology) after neoadjuvant therapy were excluded from the study. 117 patients were included in the study in 2005, 2 of them were operated laparoscopically. 155 patients (more by 32.5%) were included in the study in 2008, 53 of them (34.2%) were operated laparoscopically. In tumours of the right part of the colon (C180-C184) treated by right hemicolectomy: on an average 7.9 (+/- 5.3) lymph nodes were examined in the specimens in 2005, and 15.3 (+/- 7.0) lymph nodes in 2008. In tumours of the left part of the colon (C185-C186) treated by left hemicolectomy: 6.5 (+/- 5.1) lymph nodes were examined in 2005, and 19.6 (+/- 15.6) in 2008. In tumours of the sigmoid colon (C187) 9.1 (+/- 6.9) lymph nodes were examined in 2005,and 15.4 (+/- 7.9) in 2008.

Hypothesis Lymph node metastases decrease survival in patients with pNET. Design Prospective databases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Stanford University Hospital (SUH) were queried. Main Outcome Measures Overall survival, disease-related survival, and time to development of liver metastases Results 326 underwent surgical exploration for pNET at the NIH (n=216) and SUH (n=110). 40 (13%) and 305 (94%) underwent enucleation and resection, respectively. Of the patients who underwent resection, 117 (42%) had partial pancreatectomy and 30 (11%) had a Whipple procedure. 41 also had liver resections, 21 wedge resections and 20 lobectomies. Average follow-up was 8 years (range 0.3â28.6 years). The 10-year overall survival for patients with no metastases or lymph node metastases only was similar at 80%. As expected, patients with liver metastases had a significantly decreased 10-year survival of 30% (p<0.001). The time to development of liver metastases was significantly reduced for patients with lymph node metastases alone compared to those with none (p<0.001). For the NIH cohort with longer follow-up, disease-related survival was significantly different for those patients with no metastases, lymph node metastases alone, and liver metastases (p<0.0001). Extent of lymph node involvement in this subgroup showed that disease-related survival decreased as a function of number of lymph nodes involved (p=0.004). Conclusion As expected, liver metastases decrease survival of patients with pNET. Patients with lymph node metastases alone have a shorter time to development of liver metastases that is dependent on the number of lymph nodes involved. With sufficient long-term follow-up, lymph node metastases decrease disease-related survival. Careful evaluation of number and extent of lymph node involvement is warranted in all surgical procedures for pNET.

Automatic lymph node segmentation is challenging, as the boundary can be unclear and the surrounding structures complex. This work communicates a new three-dimensional algorithm for the segmentation of enlarged lymph nodes. The algorithm requires a user to draw a region of interest (ROI) enclosing the lymph node. Rays are cast from the center of the ROI, and the intersections of the rays and the boundary of the lymph node form a triangle mesh. The intersection points are determined by dynamic programming. The triangle mesh initializes an active contour which evolves to low-energy boundary. Three radiologists independently delineated the contours of 54 lesions from 48 patients. Dice coefficient was used to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The mean Dice coefficient between computer and the majority vote results was 83.2%. The mean Dice coefficients between the three radiologists' manual segmentations were 84.6%, 86.2%, and 88.3%. The performance of this segmentation algorithm suggests its potential clinical value for quantifying enlarged lymph nodes.

The objective of the present study was to make a clinical and economic analysis of lymph node ultrasound prior to SLNB. We performed a retrospective study of 384 patients with clinical stage I-II primary melanoma who underwent locorregional lymph node ultrasound (with or without ultrasound-guided biopsy) prior to SLNB between 2004 and 2015. We evaluated the reliability and cost-effectiveness of the strategy. Use of locorregional lymph node ultrasound avoided SLNB in 23 patients (6%). Ultrasound had a sensitivity of 46% and specificity of 76% for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes that were not clinically palpable. False negatives were significantly more common in patients aged over 60 years and in tumors with a thickness of less than 2mm. The staging process using SLNB and ultrasound with ultrasound-guided biopsy produced an increase of â¬16.30 in the unit price. Our cost-effectiveness analysis identified the staging protocol with ultrasound and SLNB as the dominant strategy, with a lower cost-effectiveness ratio than the alternative, consisting of SLNB alone (8,095.24 vs. â¬28,605.00).
