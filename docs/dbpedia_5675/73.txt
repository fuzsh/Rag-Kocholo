Description: (Location & Drainage)

The preaortic lymph nodes belong to the left lumbar chain of lymph nodes. The lateral aortic and retroaortic lymph nodes make up the remainder of this group, where they are interconnected, forming a horseshoe-like arrangement around the abdominal aorta.

The preaortic lymph nodes form clusters of two or three nodes anterior to the abdominal aorta near the origins of celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery (FÃ¶ldi et al., 2012). For this reason, the preaortic lymph nodes can be further subdivided into celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric lymph nodes, which are also visceral abdominal lymph nodes. They receive lymph from the gastrointestinal tract (abdominal esophagus to the anal canal), including the lesser omentum, liver, pancreas, and spleen. The efferent vessels of the preaortic nodes form part of the intestinal lymph trunk.
