Para-aortic lymph nodes (often shortened to para-aortic nodes) are part of the retroperitoneal nodes, and are located anterior to the left lumbar trunk 1 and above and below the left renal vein prior to the flow of lymph into the cisterna chyli 2-4.

Right para-aortic nodes together with left paracaval nodes, form the right lumbar chain of nodes around the inferior vena cava.
