LYMPH NODES

The posterior mediastinal lymph nodes lie from the region of the lung hilum inferiorly in a line to the superior surface of the diaphragm. They can be sited along the following landmarks:

anterior to the aorta - pre-aortic nodes

lateral to the aorta - para-aortic nodes:

connected to and are in close proximity to the posterior intercostal nodes sited posterolaterally. Involved in passage of lymph from posterior intercostal space.

on diaphragm form 'posterior diaphagmatic' group of nodes; can receive drainage from lateral inferior mediastinal group

lateral to oesophagus - para-oesophageal lymph nodes

The posterior mediastinal chains drain the following regions:

oesophagus

mediastinum

posterior surface of diaphragm

occasionally, lower lobes of lung

The posterior nodes drain to the thoracic duct.
