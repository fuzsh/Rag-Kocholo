        "text": "A tradition as old as motor racing will end at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday. For the first time in the sport's history, pacts involving two drivers on the same team on who is allowed to win will be against the rules.\n\nFormula One has always called such deals team orders and gentlemen's agreements, but critics call them cheating and race-fixing. They accuse teams of robbing the public of spectacle and, as bookmakers take more and more bets on Grand Prix racing, money.\n\nThe FIA, the governing body of motor racing, decided such deals were against the rules last week in response to complaints by the promoter of the Australian Grand Prix on March 8.\n\nDuring that race Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard, driving for McLaren-Mercedes, lapped all other cars to finish first and second. Hakkinen led the race until he fell behind Coulthard after pit stop problems. Two laps from the end, Coulthard slowed to let Hakkinen pass him and win the race.\n\n\"We had an agreement that the one who arrived first at the first corner at the start of the race wouldn't challenge the other,\" Coulthard said. \"The team explained to me what happened with his pit stop, and I decided to honor the agreement.\" A delighted Hakkinen said: \"Going back in history, I haven't seen many drivers doing things like that.\"\n\nWhich shows that Hakkinen does not know his history.\n\nMany Formula One milestones were achieved under similar circumstances.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
