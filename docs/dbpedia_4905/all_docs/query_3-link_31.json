        "text": "1956\n\nBy early 1956 Ron Phillips of Wangaratta in northern Victoria owned 3906.\n\nHis father, Jack, a noted racer, [pictured below] was a partner in local motor business, Parsons and Phillips, which continues to this day as Wangaratta Motors.\n\nAll were members of the newly formed North Eastern Car Club that saw the inauguration in 1954 of the renowned North Eastern Rally. Instigated by Jack Phillips, it was won by Ted Parsons in 1954 and in 1955 and 1956 by Ron Phillips.\n\nThe sons of their business-partner fathers, Ted and Ron at one time traded as “Detnor Motors”, a Land Rover, Volkswagen, Rover multi-brand dealership on the outskirts of Wangaratta. Detnor was an innovative combination of Ted and Ron spelt backwards.\n\nIn a recent letter from John Cox, the son of Jack Cox who had partnered Ron Phillips in trials and rallies, came the following insight into the man:\n\nRon’s racing included the Allard at the 1953 Grand Prix at Albert Park – it boiled about half way through the race.\n\nRon Phillips [Allard] Albert Park 1953\n\nThe Autocrat monoposto built by Eddie Thomas was driven by Ron at Templestowe Hill Climb just after the Redex. Ron then raced the Austin Healey 100S at the Wangaratta aerodrome where he was the stand out driver. I recall him racing it at Albert Park and, not being able to pass Derek Jolly, he screwed off the gear stick knob and threw it at Derek when they were side by side. Ron then got the Cooper Jaguar and won an Australian Sports Car Championship in Queensland where the Governor Sir Henry Abel Smith presented him with a canteen of cutlery, which went on their sideboard at their house in Swan St., Wangaratta. Ron’s wife Margaret reckoned it was more stuff to clean. Ron had married Margaret when he was in the Navy after the War.\n\nRon Phillips who became a very successful sports car driver, ultimately passed away in the UK where he had been involved in the motor caravan business with ex-patriate, the late Brian McGuire who was, co-incidentally, in a motor racing partnership with Alan Jones at the time. Co-workers included ex-patriots, Peter Bryan from New Zealand and John Eberle with whom Ron Phillips was snapped enjoying a beer at the local in UK in August 1975.\n\nPhillips previously campaigned an Allard J2 and ran at the Moomba races at Albert Park in 1953.\n\nWith the 100S, in its first race outing at Fishermans Bend on 11-12 February, Phillips gained 2nd place in a five-lap race behind previous owner, Stan Jones (Cooper Jaguar).\n\nAs the Australian Motor Sports (March 1956) report of “The Peter’s Ice Cream Trophy” noted: “From the very start it was Stan Jones all the way, driving his ex-Peter Whitehead Cooper Jaguar. It was a pity Bib Stillwell could not get his new D-type Jaguar unloaded from the boat for his would be the only car to give Jones a run for his money. Holding the next two positions throughout the race were the two 100S Healeys driven by R. Phillips and E. Brotherton, the former’s car being the fastest.”\n\nFishermen's Bend paddock: February 1956. Car carries Stan Jones personal registration number 751. Although the car passed to Ron Phillips, the exact timing of the transfer of ownership is unknown.\n\nPigeon pair - AHS 3907 #43 - Jeff Brotherton alongside AHS 3906 #42 Ron Phillips.\n\nIn the feature 10-lap “Lucas Trophy” Sports Car Race, Phillips finished 3rd behind Jones and Brotherton, 2nd in 100S, 3907.\n\nOn 25 February 1956, Jones was reunited with 3906 at the inaugural Hepburn Springs Hillclimb near Daylesford (Victoria) where he posted a time of 37.00 seconds for a class win in record time.\n\nIt is also reported that on 6 May 1956, Jones competed just once more in 3906 at Victoria’s Templestowe Hillclimb for 6th outright in a time of 64.93 seconds.\n\nOn Sunday 11 March 1956, 3906 ran at Albert Park, Melbourne’s famous lakeside road circuit, in the prestigious 48 lap (150 mile) Moomba TT for open and closed sports cars.\n\nScheduled for a 3pm start, Event 2 featured a LeMans start and cars were restricted to super grade motor spirit.\n\nAMS (April 1956) gave a vivid, albeit quaint description of the start: “Came the patter of running feet, the whirring of starter motors, the roar as the motor burst into life, an occasional crunch as the over-eager hurriedly selected first gear; the cars surged forward into now what seemed to be a never ending melee as they sorted themselves out and streamed off towards Melbourne Corner.”\n\nPhillips [#56] about to overtake R. Gibbs [Austin Healey 100/4] after the LeMans start.\n\nAgainst Jaguar-powered opposition in the form of Tony Gaze (HWM-Jaguar) and Bib Stillwell (D-type), Phillips, after a titanic struggle with Otto Stone (Porsche Spyder), achieved a very creditable 3rd place outright (£60 prize money) and a win in the 2001-3000cc class (a further £20 in prize money) having completed 47 of the 48 laps.\n\nAMS reported: Stone had “forged past Phillips to put the Porsche into third place, the positions on the 40th lap being: Gaze, Stillwell, Stone, Phillips, Whiteford, Miller and Patterson.\n\n“The cars held the above positions until the finish, with the exception of Phillips and Stone who swapped places on the last lap due to the Porsche’s motor beginning to falter through lack of fuel.\n\n“Modern Motor” (May 1956) claimed: “Phillips’ duel with the Spyder was the best of the day. Otto Stone drove the Spyder for owner Norman Hamilton, as Frank Kleinig was still under CAMS suspension.\n\nIn contrast to the AMS verdict, “Modern Motor” reported: “Stone made a good hand of driving the unorthodox car and eventually scraped past the 100S a few laps before the flag, only to lose the spot again when he overdid things at Jaguar Corner on his very last lap.\n\nOtto Stone [Porsche 550 Spyder #70] steps out at Jaguar Corner on the last lap, as Ron Phillips in 3906 [#56] takes 3rd outright. Moomba TT, 1956. Photograph generously provided by Karsten Stelk.\n\nThe following weekend (18 March), in warm conditions, nearly 70,000 spectators enjoyed further Moomba Festival racing at the 3.125 mile Albert Park circuit with Phillips contesting the 50 mile Argus Cup for sports cars. This time, from a gridded start, Stillwell (D-type Jaguar) won from Jones (Cooper Jaguar) who had retired the previous weekend. Gaze was third, Otto Stone (Porsche Spyder) took fourth and Phillips brought 3906 home in fifth outright.\n\nStart of the Argus Cup: AHS 3906 on second row.\n\nWearing number 56, best lap times for 3906 were 2:14 on lap 35 of the Moomba TT and 2:15 on lap 10 of the Argus Cup.\n\nContemporary photographs indicate that Phillips had fitted a solid tonneau cover over the passenger’s side of the cockpit in favour of the fabric cover seen at Fishermen’s Bend. This cover is also evident in the later Goldfinch era.\n\nOn a recent visit to Bacchus Marsh, the beautifully crafted aluminium cover was discovered in the loft at Steve Pike’s “Marsh Classic” workshops where it had been carefully stored for many years, the find prompted by a look at photos of Ron Phillips at Port Wakefield in 1957.\n\nOn 31 March 1956, Phillips journeyed to the remote South Australian circuit at Port Wakefield, scene of Jack Brabham’s 1955 Australian Grand Prix win.\n\nAfter recently rediscovering the remains of the circuit, Adelaide journalist, Lance Campbell, in an article which appeared recently in South Australia’s daily newspaper, “The Advertiser,” wrote: “The Port Wakefield circuit, based on the former Formula One layout at Zandvoort in Holland, was narrow and short. The surface – bitumen, stones and shellgrit over limestone – was flakey and shifting. Almost every time after a raceday, the track had to be relaid. Old tyres marked the track, along with four-gallon drums filled with stones. When drivers went off, as they often did, if they missed the “safety” hay bales they were in deep trouble amid the saltbush, bluebush and boxthorn.”\n\nIn Event 2 on the programme, a Group A Scratch Race, Phillips finished in 6th place, the first sports car across the line after Murray Trenberth won in his potent Vincent ‘1000’ from Tom Hawkes (Cooper Bristol), Ted Gray (Tornado), Kevin Neal (Maserati) and Eldred Norman (Zephyr Special).\n\nPort Wakefield pits - a relaxed affair in 1956.\n\nPhillips placed 3rd behind Hawkes and Neal in South Australia’s premier road racing event for 1956, the 65-mile Wakefield Trophy race over 50 laps.\n\n3906 had qualified 2nd in Event 4, the 15-lap, 19.5 mile first heat for the final behind Neal’s Reg Hunt-entered Maserati. These two results alone earned Phillips forty pounds, a handy sum in 1956.\n\nSpeeds through a flying 1/8 mile were taken on Century Straight, and against the Tornado’s fastest of 110.5 mph, the 100S recorded 98 mph.\n\nPhillips contested the Victorian Hillclimb championships at Rob Roy on April 29th, the class being won by Paul England’s Ausca (28.75). The time for second-placed 3906 was 29.07 seconds.\n\nPhillips at Rob Roy on 29 April 1956 in 29.07 [2nd in class].\n\nConceived by racer, Murray Rainey, and based on the Brighton Speed Trials, which began in England in 1907, the very first Geelong Speed Trials, over a curved 1/4-mile on Ritchie Boulevard on May 27th 1956, saw Phillips pilot 3906 to a 17.2 best time, second only to Stillwell’s D-type Jaguar in the sports car class.\n\nThere are no AMS reports of Phillips or the 100S until October: it may have been that the motor racing fraternity was pre-occupied with the Ampol Trials as there were very few serious race meetings over a winter dominated by the Round-Australia marathon, an event which attracted many top circuit drivers.\n\nHowever, the Phillips’ Customline was finally urged back to towing duties and on October 8th at Port Wakefield, 3906 placed 2nd, again to Bib Stillwell, in a 20-lap sports car scratch race, gained 6th in a 6 lap scratch race, and in a final 20 lap handicap, Phillips finished, but not among the front runners.\n\nFrom an 8mm movie frame by Ian Brock.

Port Wakefield October 8th 1956\n\nPhillips [placed 2nd] within sight of winner, Bib Stillwell [D-type Jaguar]\n\nPhillips drove the 100S to the limit - with outstanding results at every venue it raced.\n\nAt the “Olympic Year Road Races” meeting at Fishermen’s Bend on October 14th, 3906 raced against 3907, the original Austin Distributors car, now driven by Doug Whiteford.\n\nAHS 3906 [#49 Phillips} leads AHS 3907 [#50 Whiteford]\n\nThe first encounter, Event 7B, a Sports and Sedan Car race, saw Whiteford bring 3907 to the line in 3rd place behind Paul England’s Ausca and winner, Bib Stillwell (D-type Jaguar). Phillips finished in 5th in 3906 behind Len Lukey (Ford Customline).\n\nIn a rather incongruous line-up, six sedan cars, including Lukey, were given a 2 minute advantage over the 20-plus sports car field, all of which started on scratch with winner, Stillwell, coming off the back row. Phillips began two rows ahead of Whiteford and England, both of whom passed him.\n\nEvent 8, an 11-mile (5 lap) race with a handicap start, had Phillips and Whiteford alongside each other close to the rear of the field, each with a 46 second start over scratch man, Bib Stillwell (D-type Jaguar).\n\nIn the 24-lap feature event, “The Astor Trophy” for racing and sports cars over a distance of 52.8 miles, Phillips got 3906 home in 6th place, the first sports car to finish. Ahead were Rilstone (Zephyr Special), Bailey (Lago Talbot), Gray (Tornado), Neal (Maserati) and the winner, Whiteford, now Lago Talbot mounted.\n\nOld rivals reunite: AHS 3906 [left] and AHS 3907 together with Steve and David Pike on country Victorian roads c. 2004 before 3907 shipped to its new owner, Vic Jacob at St. Moritz, Switzerland. The cars were to meet again on the 2007 Mille Miglia.\n\nThe 1956 Australian Tourist Trophy, at Albert Park on 25 November, brought together a stellar international field of sports cars. Embracing both FIA rules and those of the newly introduced CAMS Appendix C Sports Car category, the 32 lap (100 mile) event was run a week prior to the 21st Olympic Australian Grand Prix.\n\nAGP 1956. Phillips [#20] drove a great TT race.\n\nIn a field of 36 cars including two works Maserati 300S for Moss and Behra, three Ferrari 750 variants, two D-type Jaguars, two Aston Martin DB3S, two Cooper Climax and a Cooper Jaguar, there also lined up four consecutively chassis-numbered Austin Healey 100S, 3905 (Sam Miller), 3906 (Phillips), 3907 (Doug Whiteford) and 3908 (Ross Jensen, NZ). This race featured a gridded start with Behra, Moss and Wharton (Ferrari Monza) on the front row. Phillips #20 began alongside Whiteford #23 on Row 4 behind Whitehead (Ferrari), Stillwell and Pitt (Jaguar D-types) and the Coopers of Patterson and Brabham.\n\nPhillips [#20 100S] 3rd row start in 1956 TT\n\nAHS 3906 [#20] was BP supported, here lined up at the fuel depot with the Porsche Speedster of H.C. Old [#31]\n\nAHS 3907 [Doug Whiteford] in the hands of Dunlop racing tyre team.\n\nMoss won from Behra at an average speed of 94.6 mph with a fastest lap of 1 min. 55.8 sec. Jensen (8th outright) recorded a best lap of 2:10.2 with his Weber-carburettored car to finish ahead of Phillips (10th) whose best lap was 2:13.2. Sam Miller did not place and Whiteford retired after placing as high as 6th with a best 100S lap of 2:09.8. Phillips won the 1500/2700cc class for local drivers but, like all finishers save Behra, he had been lapped by Stirling Moss.\n\nWhiteford retired AHS 3907..note hay bale damage on right rear guard. Note Behra #6 and Moss #7 pass in their 300S works Maseratis.\n\nThe following weekend on 2 December, the 8 lap, 25 mile Argus Trophy Race was staged as sole support event for the ‘Olympic’ AGP.\n\nRace programme carried an advertisement for PBR brakes. 100S [#20] features.\n\nIn the absence of the works Maseratis and Ferraris, the drivers of which were committed to the main event, Jack Brabham won in a 1.5 litre Cooper Climax. Jensen placed 5th and Phillips brought 3906 home in 6th.\n\nJim Leech [MM Special #63] being rounded up by Bill Pitt [Jaguar D-type #2] and Ron Phillips [3906 #20].\n\nRon - with cigarette affixed - negotiating the 1956 AGP crowd.

And although licence was taken with the colour, it was identified on the reverse side as the Ron Phillips 100S"
