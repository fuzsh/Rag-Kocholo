        "text": "THE BRAVEST OF THEM ALL\n\nThe Legend of Stan Bowman\n\nCopy write 2011\n\nBy: John M. Lucas\n\nIn the early 1960s, the United States Auto Club (USAC) sanctioned car races across the United States for race cars known as USAC Sprints. In a conversation with Parnelli Jones, winner of the 1963 Indianapolis 500 and twenty-five USAC Sprint car races during this period, he said, “The bravest drivers of all were the sprint car drivers of the early 1960s.”[i] In a conversation with Mario Andretti, considered by many to be the greatest race driver of all times, he noted, “It was a ‘Golden Era’ of race drivers.[ii] Stan Bowman, who lived in Covington, Kentucky during this era, would become one of those drivers.\n\nToday, auto racing is a multi-media sport. It is dominated by television, advertisers, and matches a driver’s marketing skills along with their driving skills. Today, both the National Association of Stock Car Racing (NASCAR) and the Indy Racing League (IRL) run their races as weekend events. In 1962 it was a different world for the national racing community. The Indianapolis 500, which began in 1911, was the crowned jewel that a driver aspired to achieve. The race itself is held every Memorial Day on May 30 when the thirty–three fastest qualifying drivers started the intensifying and grueling five-hundred mile event at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nThe thirty-three drivers that raced in the Indianapolis 500 in the 1960s were a cast of veterans and rookies that experienced the taste of the greatest moment in their lives. But, in the early 1960s, rookie or veteran they all had one thing in common. These were very brave and fearless individuals who participated in a very dangerous sport. Drivers today, whether in an Indy race car or a NASCAR race car, literally sit in a cocoon of safety devices to protect them from a life- ending injury. While still a very dangerous environment, the landscape of a driver’s safety in the early 1960s told a much different story.\n\nLocal Success – The “Covington Comet”\n\nIn 1959 Bowman drove for a local race car owner in Covington, Kentucky named George Conner, who, along with his father, owned a car parts service in Covington, Kentucky at 7thStreet where Randolph Park is now located. Bowman drove a race car numbered “43” called the Conner’s Special. And special it was. During the 1960 racing season, a thirty- year- old Bowman won the championship at the Lawrenceburg Speedway in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.[i] The next year was another successful year for Bowman – Conner team as many races were won in the Conner’s Special. Stan continued to demonstrate an amazing ability to win races, and this ability did not go unnoticed. In 1961 Bowman made his first contact with the United States Auto Club (“USAC”), the then sanctioning body of the Indianapolis 500 Championship racing division and its associated series, the USAC Sprint car division.[ii]\n\n1961/1962 Racing Scene\n\nThe USAC Sprint car scene in 1961 was a very active series filled with famous and soon to be famous names like, A. J. Foyt, Parnelli Jones, Jim Hurtubise, Johnny Rutherford, and several others. The cars they raced could be described as demons on the race track. The light weight race car was supported by a powerful engine. The driver sat in a very upright vertical position. The driver’s only protection from serious injury was a three or four piece safety belt /shoulder harness which again had recently debuted on the scene in sprint car racing. A single roll bar was placed behind the driver and often the driver’s head actually was above the bar. All drivers wore open-face helmets. But in comparison to today’s safety devices, a USAC’s sprint car driver in the 1960s presented himself to many dangers, which resulted in multiple serious injuries and fatalities. The USAC Sprint car race car did not have a roll cage or a fire extinguisher system. There was no fuel cell to help prevent a fire. The driver himself was afforded no fire proof gloves or shoes. A pair of goggles and a bandana covering his mouth was all that protected his face from debris. No fire proof face masks were worn or under garments, no neck restraining devices were used as well as arm restraining devices to keep the drivers’ arms inside the car in the event of an overturned car, which usually occurred multiple times at speeds approaching 100 MPH. In all, when Stan Bowman became officially licensed as a USAC sprint car driver in the spring of 1962 he was entering a world that few ventured into and that many would not survive unscathed. Mario Andretti said, “I would look around at a drivers meeting and say to myself, I wonder who was not going to be here at the end of the season.”[iii]\n\nThe Rookie\n\nStan Bowman began driving USAC Sprints at the age of 32. As a 32-year- old rookie he was be considered an old rookie in a young man’s game. Many believed, however, this would serve him well because of his background. As a barnstorm race car driver in his early years, he was considered a very aggressive driver on the local circuits of Southern Indiana, Southern Ohio, and Northern Kentucky. He also was a participant in the auto thrill shows that held roll over contests, running a car through a wall of fire, and the famous head on collisions. Around 1958 when he began driving for George Conner he had already acquired the fortitude and shown fearlessness that would be required to drive a USAC sprint, which was the path to the Indianapolis 500. The only thing lacking was maturity, which came over the next few years. By 1962, after many successful years on the local scene, the opportunity to drive a USAC sprint car and to compete against the best drivers in America was awaiting him. In the spring of 1962, Bowman was a fearless, aggressive and mature race car driver who was also in prime physical shape to drive those demons of the speedways.\n\nBowman’s first official USAC sprint car race would take place in April 1962 in Rossburg, Ohio at a track named Eldora. The records of USAC reveal Bowman made an appearance on the USAC sprint car scene in two races in 1961, but he was driving under a temporary license permit.[i] In 1962 Bowman made the decision to become a full-time driver in the USAC sprint car division and sought after his goal of getting an opportunity to drive in an Indianapolis Championship car, which was a level above the sprint cars and were the cars that were driven in the Indianapolis 500."
