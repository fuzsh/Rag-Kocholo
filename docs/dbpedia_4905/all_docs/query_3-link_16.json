        "text": "Stan Fox\n\nNine Racing Driver 1979-1995\n\nBorn on July 7, 1952; died on December 18, 2000\n\nThe Nine Racing team recorded its first USAC National Midget Series feature win on September 9, 1979, at Anderson Speedway with racing pioneer Stan Fox in the driver's seat. During his 16-year career with Nine Racing, the open wheel racing legend proceeded to win race after race, collecting wins at tracks like Ascot Park (four times), Indianapolis Raceway Park (three times), Illinois State Fairgrounds (two times), Saugus Speedway, Eldora Speedway, Rocky Mountain Speedway, Winchester Speedway, Raceland, Ventura Raceway, Milwaukee Mile, and Manzanita Park. Stan made the #9 car famous with such feats as winning the Turkey Night Grand Prix in 1990 (the last time it was held at Ascot Park) and in 1991 at Saugus Speedway. He brought 18 wins to the team, second only to Dave Darland and tied with Tony Stewart, who started their Nine Racing careers in 1997 and 1995, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, Stan won such events as the Copper World Classic twice, the Rex Easton Memorial in Springfield, Illinois, three times, the Rodger Mauro Classic twice, and the midget car portion of the USAC 4-Crown National at Eldora Speedway. He won the Belleville Nationals in 1979 and 1980 and was the 1979 Badger Midget Champion.\n\nStan, who has been described as one of the last drivers to make the link between midget racing and the Indianapolis 500, competed in the Indy 500 eight times between 1987 and 1995 driving for AJ Foyt and Ron Hemelgarn. Fox suffered serious head injuries in a near-fatal crash during the 1995 Indy 500. While he never raced competitively again, he continued to stay involved with the sport, and started the non-profit organization Friends of the Fox to support people with head injuries. The Wisconsin native was inducted in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 1995. The racing legend was only 48 years old when he was killed in an automobile accident in New Zealand in 2000."
