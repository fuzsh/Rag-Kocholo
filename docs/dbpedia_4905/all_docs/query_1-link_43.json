        "text": "Formula 1 is the world’s most prestigious motor racing competition, as well as the world’s most popular annual sporting series. It is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The \"Formula\" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must conform, whereas the “1” refers to the grade of track on which all races are conducted. Beginning with the 1950 British Grand Prix, Formula 1 has been entertaining millions with its sporting, financial and political battles for over seven decades.\n\nAs of the end of the 2022 season, 772 drivers representing 41 different nationalities have competed at least once for 171 Formula 1 teams. There have been 113 different race winners and 106 polesitters in 1,079 FIA World Championship races over the last 72 years. Thirty-four drivers from fifteen nations have earned a total of 73 Drivers’ Championship titles, whilst fifteen teams from five countries have won the Constructors’ Championship in its 63 seasons.\n\nAmalgam Collection’s association with Formula 1 is tied into its existence as a model car manufacturer, after our founder Sandy Copeman approached the Jordan Grand Prix and Williams Formula 1 teams to build models on their behalf. Ferrari came on board in 1998 and Amalgam has since developed strong and lasting relationships with the most important manufacturers and teams across the world of car manufacturing, motorsport and design. With the precious data from these partners, using skills developed over decades of experience, we honour their history and their DNA, delivering with passion and taste the authentic spirit of each car."
