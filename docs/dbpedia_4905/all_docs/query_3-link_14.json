He was the first driver to win a Formula One World Championship with the Williams team, becoming the 1980 World Drivers' Champion and the second Australian to do so following triple World Champion Sir Jack Brabham.\n\nJones is also the last Australian driver to win the Australian Grand Prix, winning the 1980 event at Calder Park Raceway, having lapped the field consisting mostly of Formula 5000 cars while he was driving his Formula One Championship winning Williams FW07B.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nJones attended Xavier College and is the son of Stan Jones, an Australian racing driver and winner of the 1959 Australian Grand Prix, and wanted to follow in his footsteps. The younger Jones left for Europe in 1967 to make a name for himself but met little success.\n\nRacing career[]\n\nPre Formula One[]\n\nIt took about six years before any notable results of his own, in a Formula Three car. In 1974 he managed to land a full-time Formula Atlantic ride, and his team owner parlayed it into a chance at Formula One the following season, after purchasing a car from the Hesketh racing team.\n\nFormula One[]\n\nHis first race was the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix at the fast Montjuïc circuit in his purchased Hesketh, and the weekend was to be one of the most tragic in Formula One history. After four races in Formula One the team chose not to continue racing, but Jones did, as the race after his team disbanded he was named as an injury replacement for Rolf Stommelen on Graham Hill's racing team. He had a best finish of fifth at Nürburgring while there.\n\nHe earned his first full-time Formula One drive in 1976, in John Surtees' racing team. Jones' car was mostly known for its infamous Durex sponsorship, but he managed several good finishes in it, a fourth in Japan being the best of them. Surtees dropped him after that year as he did not get along well with the Aussie, and Jones was racing in America when the Shadow team named him as a replacement for Tom Pryce, who had been killed in a freak racing accident in South Africa. He made the most of the opportunity and won at the Österreichring for his maiden victory, finishing seventh in the championship.\n\nIn 1978, Jones, who was on the Williams F1 roster on alternate weekends, also signed with Haas-Hall racing, and competed in the Lola 333CS Chaparral in the Can-Am championship, taking nine poles in ten races. (Jones missed the Laguna Seca race due to a Formula One scheduling conflict. Stand-in Brian Redman finished twelfth in that race after the kill wire was crimped under a valve cover, resulting in intermittent ignition.) Of the nine races in which he competed, Jones won five (Atlanta, Mosport, Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Riverside.) He finished second to Elliot Forbes-Robinson at Charlotte after hitting a chicane and losing a spark plug wire, cracked up at St Jovite; lost a radiator at the Glen. He finished third at Trois-Rivieres after losing a shift fork and being stuck with only second and fifth gears on the tight road circuit. At that race, water-injected brakes were first used in Can-Am, developed by the Haas team and copied with varying degrees of success by others. Jones ran one Can-Am in 1979 (Mid-Ohio), where he and Keke Rosberg had fun running into each other and finishing 1–2, with Jones winning his last Can-Am start.\n\nBy 1977, he had already caught the attention of Frank Williams, who was looking to rebuild his Formula One racing team. Williams Grand Prix had struggled for success in its first years and Jones was entrusted to give them their first taste of it. He did not do much initially to do that, a second place finish at Watkins Glen being the best he could do, but he helped put the team on the Formula One map in 1979 using the Williams FW07, after winning four races in the span of five events near the end of the season. Jones finished third in the championship hunt that year, and it was the springboard to an excellent 1980 campaign.\n\nJones won seven races in 1980, although the Spanish Grand Prix was later removed from the championship and the Australian Grand Prix was a non-championship race, so only five counted towards the Championship. Throughout the season he had a car which consistently made the podium, and he achieved ten during the year. At the end of the season he had beaten Nelson Piquet by 13 points in the standings, becoming Australia's first World Champion since Sir Jack Brabham. He had a good chance to repeat his success in 1981, but a very combative relationship with Carlos Reutemann led to an intense rivalry that possibly cost both drivers a chance at the championship. He finished four points behind Piquet for the championship and three behind Reutemann.\n\nHe announced his retirement after the season, which he managed to cap off with a win in Las Vegas, but came out of retirement for a one-time drive with Arrows in 1983 at the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch where he qualified and finished third and at the United States Grand Prix West at Long Beach where he qualified a fine 12th but retired after 58 laps through driver fatigue.\n\nJones wasn't seen in Formula One during 1984 but he made a full-time comeback late in 1985 when Team Haas was created and Jones was the first driver for that outfit, the team making its debut at the Italian Grand Prix. Jones was joined at Haas in 1986 by former Ferrari and Renault works driver Patrick Tambay. The comeback was unsuccessful more due to the Ford V6 engine's lack of power than any lack of skill from Jones and he retired from Formula One for good following the season.\n\nPost Formula One[]\n\nJones post Formula One career was initially spasmodic in nature. Briefly in demand for his services as a Touring Car co-driver, he raced occasionally in his home country's biggest endurance race, the Bathurst 1000 but success was elusive. In 1982 he attempted his first full season of racing, driving a Porsche 935 to dominate the 1982 Australian GT Championship. Soon after he made his first failed comeback to Formula One. After returning to Australia again he formed his own Touring Car team, combining the resources of V8 Ford driver Bob Morris and rotary Mazda racer Barry Jones into a single two-car team but results were mixed and the exercise dissipated by the end of the season. 1984 brought a top six finish at Le Mans 24 Hour and a top four finish at the Bathurst 1000. Quickly snapped up as the lead driver in the newly formed factory supported Alfa Romeo touring car team for the 1985 season, he abandoned his first serious Australian Touring Car Championship campaign to make his second Formula One comeback with the Haas Lola team.\n\nAfter returning home again in 1987 his career did not pick up again until a competitive third placing at the 1988 Bathurst 1000 saw him signed up as full-time number two driver to Tony Longhurst in his Ford Sierra team, which was brutally fast but disappointingly fragile and results were again elusive. The team switched to BMWs in 1991, which saw the return of reliability at the cost of speed. Jones took the occasional podium result. A switch to Glenn Seton Racing mid-season in 1992 brought improved results and race wins and he finished runner up to his team leader Glenn Seton as their V8 Ford Falcons dominated the 1993 Australian Touring Car Championship. The team's dominance faded over the next few years. The 1995 Bathurst 1000 looked to be a high point with a memorable 1–2 finish for their two cars fading into just a second for the car Jones shared with Allan Grice. By this point the team was sundering apart and Jones took the major sponsor to form a new team with engineering brothers Ross and Jim Stone as partners, known commercially as Pack Leader Racing. Initially fast, the partnership was fading by 1997 and the Stones bought Jones out, rebadging the team as Stone Brothers Racing. Jones returned to race with Tony Longhurst's team again in 1998 by this time his form was fading. From 1999 onwards he no longer raced full-time, driving just the endurance races as a hired gun. His final race was with Dick Johnson Racing, driving into a seventh placed finish at the 2002 Bathurst 1000.\n\nHe became a commentator with Channel Nine as part of their Formula One coverage in Australia in the late 1980s, a role which lasted over a decade until a change of network. Jones has since become involved in the Australian franchise of the A1 Grand Prix as Team Director. He attempted to race in the Grand Prix Masters World Series at Kyalami in November 2005 but had to pull out before qualifying due to neck pains. There was speculation at the time that his exit was due more to a general lack of fitness which had left him up to ten seconds per lap off the pace in practice.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nJones separated from his wife Beverley in the late 1980s. In 1996 he began a relationship with Amanda Butler Davis and in 2001 their twins, Zara and Jack, were born.\n\nJones also has a daughter, Camilla, born in 1990.\n\nJones's adopted son Christian now races in various forms of motorsport.\n\nHis eldest daughter, Emma, has two daughters (born 2001 and 2004), making Jones a grandfather.\n\nRacing record[]\n\nSeason Series Position Car Team 1972 Forward Trust BARC Formula 3 Series 9th GRD 372 1972 Lombard North Formula 3 Series 11th GRD 372 1972 Shellsport National Formula 3 Series 16th GRD 372 1973 Forward Trust BARC Formula 3 Series 7th GRD 373 DART 1973 John Player European Formula 3 Series 2nd GRD 373 DART 1973 Lombard North Formula 3 Series 5th GRD 373 DART 1974 British Formula Atlantic Championship 2nd March 74B Ford Harry Stiller Racing 1974 British Formula Atlantic Series 4th March 74B Ford Harry Stiller Racing 1975 World Drivers' Championship 17th Hesketh 308B Cosworth\n\nHill GH1 Cosworth Harry Stiller Racing\n\nEmbassy Hill 1975 European Formula 5000 Championship 7th Chevron B28 Chevrolet 1976 World Drivers' Championship 15th Surtees TS19 Cosworth Surtees 1976 United States Formula 5000 Championship 4th Lola T332 Chevrolet Theodore Racing 1977 World Drivers' Championship 7th Shadow DN8 Cosworth Shadow Racing Cars 1977 Rothmans International Series 3rd Lola T332 Chevrolet Theodore Racing 1978 World Drivers' Championship 11th Williams FW06 Cosworth Williams Grand Prix\n\nEngineering 1978 Can-Am Challenge Cup 1st Lola T333CS Chevrolet Haas-Hall Racing 1979 World Drivers' Championship 3rd Williams FW06 Cosworth\n\nWilliams FW07 Cosworth Williams Grand Prix\n\nEngineering 1979 Can-Am Challenge Cup 6th Lola T333CS Chevrolet Carl Hall Racing 1979 International Race of Champions 5th Chevrolet Camaro 1980 World Drivers' Championship 1st Williams FW07 Cosworth\n\nWilliams FW07B Cosworth Williams Grand Prix\n\nEngineering 1981 World Drivers' Championship 3rd Williams FW07C Cosworth\n\nWilliams FW07D Cosworth Williams Grand Prix\n\nEngineering 1982 Australian GT Championship 1st Porsche 935 Porsche Cars Australia 1982 Australian Drivers' Championship 8th Ralt RT4 Cosworth 1983 World Endurance Championship 38th Porsche 956 Porsche Kremer Racing 1983 Australian Drivers' Championship 6th Ralt RT4 Cosworth 1984 World Endurance Championship 52nd Porsche 956 Porsche Kremer Racing\n\nRothmans Porsche 1985 Australian Touring Car Championship 8th Alfa Romeo Alfetta GTV6 Network Alfa 1985 CART Indy Car World Series 23rd Lola T900 Cosworth Newman-Haas Racing 1986 World Drivers' Championship 12th Lola THL1 Hart\n\nLola THL2 Cosworth Team Haas (USA) Ltd. 1987 All Japan Sports Prototype Championship 22nd Toyota 87C Toyota Team Tom's 1990 Australian Touring Car Championship 9th Ford Sierra RS500 Benson & Hedges Racing 1991 Australian Touring Car Championship 4th BMW M3 Benson & Hedges Racing 1992 Australian Touring Car Championship 7th BMW M3 Benson & Hedges Racing 1993 Australian Touring Car Championship 2nd Ford EB Falcon Glenn Seton Racing 1994 Australian Touring Car Championship 4th Ford EB Falcon Glenn Seton Racing 1995 Australian Touring Car Championship 8th Ford EF Falcon Glenn Seton Racing 1996 Australian Touring Car Championship 8th Ford EF Falcon Alan Jones Racing 1996 Mobil New Zealand Sprints 11th Ford EF Falcon Alan Jones Racing 1997 Australian Touring Car Championship 11th Ford EL Falcon Alan Jones Racing 1998 Australian Touring Car Championship 16th Ford EL Falcon Tony Longhurst Racing 1999 Shell Championship Series 62nd Ford AU Falcon Paul Little Racing 2001 Shell Championship Series 44th Ford AU Falcon Paul Little Racing 2002 V8 Supercar Championship Series 38th Ford AU Falcon Paul Little Racing\n\nComplete Formula One World Championship results[]\n\n(key) (races in bold indicate pole position;
