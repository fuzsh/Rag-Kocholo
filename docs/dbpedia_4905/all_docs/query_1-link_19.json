        "text": "Some 39 years later, Davison's record of four Australian Grand Prix wins was finally equalled and some felt it was a fitting tribute that it was Schumacher to be the man to share the record. Even if the German dominated F1 for several years, Davison had a hold on this home race like few other drivers have enjoyed.\n\nOf the current crop of F1 drivers, only Lewis Hamilton has won the race twice in his career, with three-time winner Sebastian Vettel retiring at the end of the 2022 season. Hamilton may feel it is a tall order to bring himself closer to the hat-trick given Max Verstappen's form, but at the unpredictable Melbourne circuit, anything can happen.\n\nDavison, whose sons Jon and Richard also followed their father into the world of racing, has been honoured by the Australian Grand Prix organisers after they named the race winners' trophy. His grandsons, Alex and Will, both compete at a high level in motorsport, carrying on the Davison legacy after Lex's incredible achievements."
