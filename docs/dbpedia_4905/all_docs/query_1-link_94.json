        "text": "Max Verstappen\n\nF1 driver\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 3:05 AM ET (South China Morning Post)\n\nMeet Max Maeder, kite surfer on verge of Singapore’s second Olympic gold ever\n\nAug. 6, 2024, 12:27 AM ET (Newsweek)\n\nDaniel Ricciardo Reveals Moment He Would Step Away From F1\n\nJuly 29, 2024, 11:49 AM ET (AP)\n\nVerstappen to regroup during F1 summer break with McLaren and Mercedes right on his tailpipe\n\nJuly 28, 2024, 2:57 PM ET (AP)\n\nHamilton declared winner of F1 Belgian GP after Mercedes teammate Russell DQ for underweight car\n\nJuly 26, 2024, 9:34 AM ET (AP)\n\nVerstappen in defensive mode against hard-charging McLaren, takes 10-place penalty at Belgian GP\n\nMax Verstappen (born September 30, 1997, Hasselt, Belgium) is a race-car driver competing in Formula One (F1) under the Dutch flag. He is the sport’s youngest race winner, and he is also the youngest person to start an F1 race. Driving for Red Bull Racing, he won three consecutive F1 drivers’ championships—one of only five drivers to do so in the sport’s history—in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\nEarly life, karting, and F3\n\nVerstappen is the elder of two children born to Jos Verstappen, a Dutch former F1 driver, and Sophie Kumpen, a Belgian former kart racer. His parents and upbringing provide him with claims to Belgian and Dutch citizenship; he maintains a residence in Monaco.\n\nHis first taste of motorsport came at the age of two, when he would ride a quad bike at the family’s home. As a four-year-old, he moved up to karting. By age seven, he had won his first race, and within the next several years he was competing in and winning national and European championships across karting categories.\n\nDuring this time Verstappen’s parents separated and then divorced. Verstappen lived with his father, whose approach to parenting and advancing his son’s career has faced criticism over the years. In the television documentary Max Verstappen: Anatomy of a Champion (2023), Verstappen’s father argues that he was strict and uncompromising because he believed that this type of upbringing was necessary for Verstappen to reach the top of his sport.\n\nIn 2014, at age 16, Verstappen began competing in the European Formula Three (F3) category—a step above karting to open-wheel, single-seater racing. He scored 10 wins, the most among all drivers in the series, and during the middle of the season he won six races in a row but finished third overall in the F3 drivers’ championship, largely because he failed to finish multiple races.\n\nF1 debut and promotion to Red Bull\n\nIn 2015, at age 17, Verstappen become the youngest driver ever to compete in an F1 race. Driving for Scuderia Toro Rosso at the Australian Grand Prix, his first race ended after 32 laps because of engine failure. He finished the season 12th in the drivers’ championship, and his best race result was fourth place.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nHis performance in 2015 secured him a promotion from Toro Rosso, considered Red Bull’s “junior” team, to Red Bull Racing for the 2016 F1 season. He started slowly, with a 10th-place finish at the season opener in Australia, but within two months he had set another F1 record: his victory at the Spanish Grand Prix on May 15, 2016, made him the youngest driver ever to win an F1 championship race. He was 18 years old. He finished the season in fifth place in the drivers’ championship, two spots behind his teammate, Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nClimbing to a first F1 championship\n\nVerstappen failed to finish 7 of his first 14 races during the 2017 season; he was also involved in three first-lap collisions and scored only one top-three finish during this span. But over the season’s final 6 races, he won twice, in Malaysia and Mexico, and finished the season in sixth place in the drivers’ championship—once again, though, behind Ricciardo.\n\nDuring the 2018 season Verstappen’s aggressive driving—causing collisions, banging wheels, forcing other drivers off the track—drew penalties from race officials and criticism from other drivers and his own team. Amid this controversy, he won twice and finished the season fourth in the drivers’ championship. He also finished well ahead of Ricciardo, who left Red Bull after the season ended.\n\n“At the end of the day I know I will always be right, of course there will be difficult times and there will be more in the future but I know what I have to do in the car.”—Max Verstappen, 2018\n\nRed Bull switched engine suppliers for the 2019 season, a change that proved to be beneficial for Verstappen. He won three races and claimed third place in the drivers’ championship—a career best. He also substantially outperformed his new teammate, Alex Albon, who finished five spots behind him in the championship standings, thus cementing Verstappen’s status as the team’s lead driver. Verstappen repeated this feat in the 2020 season, finishing third in the drivers’ championship behind the dominant Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton—who won a record-tying seventh title—and Valtteri Bottas. Verstappen won two races and finished second or third in nine others.\n\nThe 2021 season was centered on a ferocious rivalry between Verstappen and Hamilton, who clashed multiple times, resulting in major accidents in the British and Italian grands prix. Verstappen won 10 races and seized a narrow victory over Hamilton in the drivers’ championship after a hard-fought season-closing race in Abu Dhabi that ended with a controversial decision by race officials. It was Verstappen’s first F1 championship, and during one of his postrace interviews he said of his accomplishment that “it’s insane. It’s insane. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nTwo more championships\n\nNew regulations took effect for the 2022 F1 season, which forced significant changes to car engineering and design. Red Bull’s cars proved successful, while Mercedes’ slumped: Verstappen dominated the season with 15 wins, and he secured his second drivers’ championship, while his rival Hamilton finished sixth. Verstappen’s performance, along with that of teammate Sergio Pérez, also helped Red Bull win the 2022 constructors’ championship, the first time since 2013 that the team had secured that title.\n\nWinners of three or more consecutive F1 drivers’ championships\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio: 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957\n\nMichael Schumacher: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004\n\nSebastian Vettel: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013\n\nLewis Hamilton: 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020\n\nMax Verstappen: 2021, 2022, 2023\n\nThis list includes only consecutive championships, not all championships won by a driver.\n\nThe 2023 season saw Verstappen win his third consecutive drivers’ championship. He won 19 of 22 races and finished outside the top three just once. He also finished every race. He more than doubled the points scored by his teammate Pérez, who was second in the drivers’ championship. Verstappen set several records, including the most wins in a row (10) during an F1 season. Even by the middle of the season, though, pundits had begun fretting that his consistent winning was making the sport boring and predictable—as one headline in The Guardian put it, “Max Verstappen and Red Bull are brilliant but their dominance is a problem for F1.”\n\nMechanical failure at the 2024 Australian Grand Prix prevented Verstappen from completing a race for the first time in nearly two years. Verstappen had won the two opening races of the 2024 season, and he went on to win two more before finishing second to Lando Norris at Miami, raising questions about whether Verstappen would have the same level of success in 2024 as he did in 2023. His sixth-place finish at Monaco provoked yet more questions. Over the next six races, however, Verstappen won twice and finished second once, and he maintained a comfortable lead in the drivers’ championship.\n\nLaura Payne"
