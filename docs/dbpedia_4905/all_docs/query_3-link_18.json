        "text": "♪ >> HE WAS THE GREATEST RACE CAR DRIVER I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.\n\n>> HE COULD TAKE A WHEEL BAR AND PUT IT OUT FRONT.\n\n>> HE WAS ONE OF THE TOP GUYS IN SPRINT CARS, ABSOLUTELY.\n\nI THINK HE WAS DEFINITELY READY TO PROGRESS TO GET TO THE TOP LEVEL, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\n\n>> I KIND OF THOUGHT, BOY, I LEFT SOMETHING LAYING ON THE TABLE.\n\nWISH HE HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR US.\n\n>> HE WAS THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK, BUT HE CAME ON LEADING THE PARADE, AND THAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING.\n\n>> WITH HIS ABILITY, AND HIS ATTITUDE TO GO FAST, FAST WASN'T FAST ENOUGH FOR HIM.\n\n>> AS A YOUNG MAN, STAN BOWMAN LEARNED TO DRIVE ON THE CURVEY ROADS AND ROLLING HILLS OF SOUTHERN INDIANA.\n\nHIS PASSION FOR SPEED LED HIM TO LOCAL RACETRACKS IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, WHERE HE BEGAN HIS RACING CAREER.\n\nIN 1955, STAN, HIS WIFE MARJORIE AND SON RANDY, MOVED TO COVINGTON, KENTUCKY, TO BE CLOSER TO HIS DAY JOB AS A HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATOR BUILDING INTERSTATE 75.\n\n>> UNTIL WE MOVED UP HERE, YOU KNOW, GREATER CINCINNATI TO NORTHERN KENTUCKY, THAT'S WHERE I CAN, BASICALLY REMEMBER LIKE GOING TO HILLTOP AND LAWRENCEBURG AND GLEN ESTE AND ALL THE LOCAL TRACKS.\n\nLIKE WHEN I WAS 8, 9, 10 YEARS OLD.\n\nBECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE WERE EVERY WEEKEND.\n\n>> PRETTY GOOD ALL-AROUND GUY.\n\nI GOT TO KNOW HIM PRETTY WELL PROBABLY ABOUT 1957.\n\nWE WERE RUNNING AT THE CINCINNATI RACE BOWL.\n\nHE CAME AROUND.\n\nHE WAS FROM OVER IN INDIANA SOMEWHERE.\n\nHE WASN'T A BIG STAR IN THE BEGINNING, BUT HE SEEMED TO ACQUIRE THE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO ANY RACE CAR HE GOT IN AND GO FAST.\n\n>> HE WORKED, YOU KNOW, CONSTRUCTION WORK THROUGH THE WEEK, BUT EVERY SATURDAY WE WAS RACING SOMEWHERE, AND I WAS ALWAYS THERE, TOO.\n\nJUST LIKE DADDY'S LITTLE BOY.\n\n>> STAN BEGAN MAKING A NAME FOR HIMSELF AT HILLTOP SPEEDWAY IN INDEPENDENCE, KENTUCKY.\n\n>> IT WAS KIND OF A ROUGH, DUSTY RACETRACK, YOU KNOW.\n\nHE COULD TAKE A ROUGH TRACK AND MAKE IT LOOK SMOOTH.\n\n>> HE ALSO DID SOME THRILL SHOW STUFF.\n\nI REMEMBER SEEING THAT ONE TIME, WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE THESE THRILL SHOWS THAT WOULD COME AROUND.\n\nJOEY CHITWOOD IS THE MOST FAMOUS ONE, BUT THERE WERE OTHERS.\n\nAND STAN WOULD GET IN AN OLD CAR AND TURN IT OVER, RUN IT ON A RAMP AND TURN IT OVER THREE OR FOUR FOUR TIMES WALK AWAY OR GO THROUGH A WALL O SO, YOU COULDN'T DENY A FELLA LI THAT NOT GETTING YOUR ATTENTION A LITTLE BIT.\n\nTHAT'S HOW IT STARTED.\n\n>> FIRST TIME I EVER DROVE A RACE CAR WAS HILLTOP SPEEDWAY TH NORTHERN KENTUCKY.\n\nSTAN WAS UP THERE WITH MY DAD HAVING FRIED CHICKEN AFTER THE RACE WAS OVER.\n\nAND I TOOK IT OUT AND GAVE IT A PRETTY GOOD RIDE.\n\nAND STAN TOLD MY DAD, SAYS CHARLIE, THAT'S YOUR CAR OUT THERE ON THE TRACK.\n\nDAD SAYS, NO, IT CAN'T BE.\n\nIT'S MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE.\n\nMY CAR IS NOT THAT LOUD.\n\nAND STAN SAID, \"IT SURE IS.\"\n\nAND AFTER I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND WENT RUNNING BACK UP TO WHERE THEY WERE, THEY WERE STILL EATING FRIED CHICKEN.\n\nSTAN WAS RAZZING ME ABOUT IT AND SAID I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO BLOW THAT THING UP.\n\nYOU KNOW, JUST AGGRAVATING MY DAD, I GUESS, MORE THAN ANYTHING.\n\nTHEY ALWAYS LIKED TO KID MY DAD.\n\n>> HE WAS A GOOD GUY AND ONE HELL OF A RACE CAR DRIVER.\n\nI MEAN HE TAUGHT ME MORE-- TALKED TO ME, HE COME OVER TO MY HOUSE AND DRINK COFFEE, AND WE WOULD SIT THERE AND RACE AT THE KITCHEN TABLE, YOU KNOW.\n\nAND HE TAUGHT ME MORE ABOUT RACING AND I STILL REMEMBER IT.\n\n>> BUZZ ON STAN BOWMAN STARTED IN ABOUT 1959.\n\nSTAN STARTED DRIVING A MODIFIED CAR FOR A FELLA NAMED GEORGE CONNER WHO HAD A RACING-- HAD A GARAGE, AND HE KEPT A CAR THERE IN COVINGTON, KENTUCKY.\n\nAND HE WAS SUCCESSFUL FROM THE BEGINNING.\n\nAND NO MATTER WHERE STAN STARTED, YOU KNEW AT THE END OF THE RACE, HE WAS EITHER GOING TO BE FIRST, SECOND OR THIRD SEEMED EVERY WEEK, WHAT YOU COUNTED ON.\n\nAND I'LL SAY THIS.\n\nGEORGE CONNERS, I THINK, WAS A GREAT MENTOR FOR STAN BOWMAN.\n\n>> MY DAD WON A LOT.\n\nSO I'M SURE THAT MADE IT EASIER.\n\nAND HE WAS, YOU KNOW, HE WAS LIKED.\n\nHE HAD A FOLLOWING.\n\n>> IN THE SPRING OF 1962, STAN BOWMAN MOVED UP TO THE SECOND HIGHEST LEVEL OF RACING IN THE UNITED STATES AUTO CLUB.\n\n>> (LAUGHS) MY FAVORITE DEFINITI SPRINT CAR IS LIKE SLAPPING A MOUNTAIN LION IN THE BEHIND WITH A HAND FULL OF COCKLEBURS.\n\nYOU JUST BETTER BE READY.\n\n(LAUG >> WELL, IT'S SPRINT CAR BECAUSE WE DON'T RUN LONG RACES.\n\nOUR RACES ARE 30, SOMETIMES 50 LAPS.\n\nTYPICALLY WE NEVER RUN LONG RACES AND THAT'S WHERE THE WORD SPRINT COMES FROM.\n\nBUT YOU HAVE A SERIES OF EVENTS THAT LEAD TO THE FEATURE EVENT.\n\nAND PARTICULARLY THEY RUN ON BOTH PAVEMENT AND DIRT, BUT DIRT IS THE MOST POPULAR.\n\n>> EXCITING OBVIOUSLY.\n\nI THINK THE SPRINT CARS OBVIOUSLY, PROBABLY THE MOST, LET'S JUST SAY THE MOST BEASTLY RACE CAR YOU COULD EVER DRIVE BECAUSE THE POWER TO RATIO, AND THE HORSEPOWER YOU HAVE BECAUSE OF THE LOW GEARS.\n\n>> EVERY NOW AND THEN HAVE YOU TO GO TO THE EDGE AND LOOK OVER.\n\nIF YOU DON'T, IT GETS A LITTLE BORING AROUND HERE.\n\nAND SO THAT'S WHAT SPRINT CAR RACING WAS.\n\nIT TOOK THE BORING PART OF IT OUT AND IT WAS EXCITING, VERY EXCITING.\n\n>> THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST LAUNCHING PAD FOR ME BECAUSE WHY?\n\nBECAUSE YOU WERE RACING AGAINST ALL THE TOP GUYS, YOU KNOW, McCLUSKEY, FOYT, BRANSON AND THE UNCERS AND SO ON AMD SO FORT YOU WERE MEASURING UP AGAINST THE GUY YOU WERE GOING TO BE MEASURING UP WHEN YOU ADVANCED TO THE NEXT LEVEL.\n\nSO IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT.\n\n>> THERE ARE GOOD DRIVERS AND THERE ARE MEDIOCRE DRIVERS AND THERE ARE INCREDIBLE DRIVERS.\n\nAND I ASKED DAN GURNEY THAT SAME QUESTION.\n\nAND HE SAID, HE'S KIND OF LIKE THIS.\n\nHE SAYS, YOU KNOW, IMAGINE SOMEB WALKING ALONG THE GRAND CANYON, ON A BIG CLIFF, AND HE'S WALKING ALONG THERE AND ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER.\n\nTHAT'S PRETTY RISKY.\n\nAND BUT HE CAN DO IT.\n\nAND HE SAYS NOW, THINK OF ONE GU THAT'S WALKING ALONG THAT EDGE W ONE FOOT, HOPPING ALONG.\n\nTHAT GUY IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.\n\nHE SAID THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN INCREDIBLE DRIVER AND A GOOD DRIVER.\n\n>> IT WAS FUN RACING.\n\nOF ALL THE RACING THAT I'VE DONE, I THINK I ENJOYED SPRINT CARS JUST ABOUT AS MUCH AS I DID THE INDY CARS BECAUSE IT WAS REAL RACING.\n\n>> WHERE, BACK THEN, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY RAN WIDE OPEN OR NOT.\n\nI DOUBT IT.\n\nI HOPE THEY WEREN'T.\n\nBUT ON THAT SKINNY AND THAT HARD OF A TIRE, AND THE SUSPENSIONS WEREN'T FANCY WITH FANCY SHOCKS WITH WHAT WE HAVE NOWADAYS, I CAN PROMISE YOU IT WAS A LOT MORE OF A HANDFUL TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE CAR STUCK GOING THROUGH THE CORNERS.\n\n>> SO, THOSE DRIVERS WERE REALLY WORKING IT.\n\n>> UN HM, ABSOLUTELY.\n\nI CAN PROMISE YOU THEY WERE WORKING MUCH HARDER THAN WHAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW.\n\n>> NOW THAT THE CARS HAVE GOT ALL OF THE SUPPORTIVE WINGS ON TOP AND 800 OR 900 HORSEPOWER ENGINES AND TIRES THAT ARE 16 INCHES WIDE AND, YOU KNOW, GIVE ME A BREAK.\n\nTHAT'S NOT-- WELL, THAT'S RACING TODAY.\n\n>> I'M JUST SO HAPPY AND FORTUNATE THAT I WAS ABLE TO HAVE MY LICKS IN SPRINT CARS BECAUSE I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT SOME OF THE YOUNGER DRIVERS, AND OBVIOUSLY NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY, GOSH, WHAT THEY MISSED.\n\nI MEAN AS A DRIVER, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU HAD THAT EXPERIENCE, YOU WOULDN'T TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING.\n\n>> I WOULD GIVE UP MY THREE-CUP CHAMPIONSHIPS, MY KNEE CAR CHAMPIONSHIP, MY USAC CHAMPIONSHIPS, I WOULD GIVE IT ALL UP TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO RACE WITH THOSE GUYS IN THAT ERA.\n\nTHAT, TO ME, WAS SOME OF THE BEST TIMES IN AUTO RACING.\n\n>> WE HAD GOOD TIMES, YOU KNOW WE TRAVELED EVERY WEEKEND TO A SPRINT CAR RACE AND A LOT OF US WERE-- HAD STEADY INDYCAR RIDES SO THERE WEREN'T AS MANY RACES AS THERE WAS ON THE SPRINT CAR CIRCUIT SO IT WAS, YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO BE-- GOT TO BE GOOD FRIENDS, BUT YOU KNOW, THERE IS ALWAYS A STORY THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TOO GOOD OF FRIENDS WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE GONE NEXT WEEK, YOU KNOW.\n\nWELL, THAT'S RACING, YOU KNOW AND IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE PART OF IT, BUT THAT'S SOMETIMES THE WAY IT GOES AND YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.\n\n>> NOBODY BACKS INTO A WIN HERE.\n\nTHE BIG HEROES ARE THE ONES THAT WIN THE BIG RACES HERE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PLACES IN THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS DIRT TRACKS GO.\n\nTO BE REALLY GOOD HERE, I MEAN THE HISTORY OF THIS PLACE WAS YOU HAD TO BE UP ON THE WALL AND RIGHT NEXT TO THE WALL.\n\nAND IT'S A SPEED YOU ARE RUNNING, WHEN YOU ARE THAT CLOSE TO BEGIN WITH, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AND YOU HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, CHASE THE CAR UP THE RACETRACK, THERE IS NOWHERE TO GO WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY THERE.\n\nSO THE GUYS THAT HAD THE CONFIDENCE AND, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS JOKED AROUND ABOUT THE GUYS WITH THE BIGGEST BALLS WERE THE GUYS THAT RAN GOOD AT ELDORA.\n\n>> WELL, ELORA WAS STARTED BY THE NAME OF EARL BALTES AND IT WASN'T THE TRACK IT WAS T IT JUST HAD A SINGLE GUARD RAIL, FAST, VERY HIGH BANKED.\n\nAND YOU BOUNCED THEM OFF THE FENCE AND INITIALLY THEN IT GOT A DOUBLE GUARD RAIL AND THEN IT GOT A CONCRETE WALL.\n\nBUT IT WAS SO HIGH BANKED AND SO FAST THAT IT EARNED A LOT OF RES OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.\n\nTHE TRACK GOT CHOPPY, YOU KNOW, THERE'D BE A LOT OF FLIPS BECAUSE OF THE SPEED AT WHICH THE FLIPS OCCURRED, IT NOT ONLY DAMAGED THE CARS, SOMETIMES IT DAMAGED THE DRIVER.\n\n>> ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PHOTOS OF ELDORA SPEEDWAY IS JOHNNY RUTHERFORD FLIPPING ON TURN ONE, WITH THE CAR UPSIDE DOWN AND HIS ARMS STRAIGHT UP.\n\nAND IT JUST SHOWED HOW TOUGH ELD WAS.\n\n>> THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED.\n\nONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED.\n\nTHE STORY I TELL ABOUT THIS PICTURE IS TONY STEWART TOLD ME THAT'S THE MOST FAMOUS PICTURE THAT WAS EVER MADE AT ELDORA, AN I HATED TO BE THE PARTICIPANT IN THE PICTURE, BUT THE NEXT DAY I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL, AND THE DAYTON DAILY NEWS IN THE SPORTS SECTION HAD A PICTURE OF ME ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SPORTS SECTION.\n\nAND THE GUY THAT PUT IT THERE WROTE UNDERNEATH IT, RUTHERFORD WAVES TO THE CROWD AS HE LEAVES HE RACETRACK.\n\nAND I HAVE YET TO FIND HIM.\n\n(LAU >> THAT WAS THE TRAINING GROUND.\n\nI MEAN THAT'S WHERE THE GUYS WHO HAD INDYCARS AND YOU KNOW, BACK WITH THE ROADSTERS, IF YOU RAN WELL IN SPRINT CARS, THAT'S HOW YOU MADE A NAME FOR YOURSELF.\n\nTHERE WASN'T SOCIAL MEDIA.\n\nTHERE WASN'T P.R.\n\nAGENTS.\n\nTHERE WEREN'T PEOPLE TO-- THE ONLY WAY WERE YOU GOING TO GET RECOGNIZED TO GET GOOD OPPORTUNITIES WAS TO RUN WELL IN FRONT OF THOSE PEOPLE.\n\n>> IN THE FALL OF 1961, HAROLD BECK, THE OWNER OF A SMALL CONSTRUCTION COMPANY IN DAYTON OHIO AND MID-LEVEL USAC SPRINT CAR PLUCKED THE 32-YEAR-OLD ROOKIE STAN BOWMAN OUT OF RELATIVE OBSCURITY.\n\nLITTLE DID THEY KNOW, NINE MONTHS LATER, IN THE FIRST USAC SANCTIONED RACE AT ELDORA SPEEDWAY, THEY WOULD BE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR OF HISTORY.\n\n>> HAROLD SCOUTED STAN BOWMAN AND GOING TO ELDORA AND LAWRENCEBURG.\n\nAND I REMEMBER HIM TELLING ME, HE THINKS HE FOUND A DRIVER.\n\nAND HAROLD FELT THAT IN FINDING A DRIVER LIKE STAN BOWMAN, HE DIDN'T HAVE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT HOW FAST THE CAR WAS GONNA BECAUSE HE KNEW STAN BOWMAN KNEW THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY GOING TO BE \"THE\" OPPORTUNITY TO GO UNDER THE NEXT RING OF RACING AND MAYBE BECOME AN INDIANAPOLIS WINNER PERHAPS.\n\nIT WAS A STORMY DAY, AND STAN QUALIFIED WELL, GOT IN THE LEAD.\n\nHE KNEW HOW TO READ A RACETRACK.\n\nAND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T GET IN A BOOK OR YOU CAN'T BE TOLD.\n\nYOU EITHER HAVE IT OR YOU DON'T.\n\nYOU CAN EITHER HIT 100 MILE AN HOUR FASTBALL, OR YOU WON'T.\n\nHE HAD THIS ABILITY.\n\n>> STAN WAS DRIVING A SPRINT CAR THAT HAD WHAT WAS CALLED AN OFFENHAUSER MOTOR IN IT.\n\nAND THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING, AT THE TIME, BECAUSE OFFENHAUSER WAS KIND OF THE STANDARD MOTOR FOR SPRINT CARS FOR MANY YEARS UP UNTIL AROUND 1962.\n\nCHEVROLET HAD INTRODUCED A CHEVROLET V8 INTO THE SCENE AND JONES-- PARNELLI JONES AND JIM HURTUBISE HAD CHEVY V8s.\n\nIN FACT, THEY WERE ALREADY BEING CALLED THE CHEVY TWINS.\n\nSTAN CAME INTO THE RACE WITH AN UNDER PAR CAR AND STAN KNEW THAT AND EVERYBODY KNEW THAT, SO PROB A REASONABLE EXPECTATION FOR MOST PEOPLE IS THAT STAN MAYBE W BE A TOP 10 THAT DAY.\n\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NAMES THAT ARE THERE, AND YOU LOOK AT THE CARS AND THE OWNERS AND HERE'S HAROLD BECK WITH HIS SMALL OFFY, YES, THAT WAS THE EXPECTATION TO THE REASONABLE PERSON.\n\nI WASN'T REASONABLE, BUT I WAS 10 YEARS OLD.\n\n>> IT'S A PRETTY COOL LIST.\n\nSO OBVIOUSLY STAN BOWMAN, JIM HURTUBISE, PARNELLI JONES, BOBBY MARSHMAN, ROGER McCLUSKEY, JOHNNY RUTHERFORD, DON BRANSON, ELMER GEORGE, ALLEN CROWE, BUD TINGELSTAD, COTTON FARMER, RONNIE DUNHAM, CHUCK RODEE, HUGH RANDALL, BOB MARVIN, LEON CLUM, TOM McCELLAN, JIM HEMMINGS, MICHEY SHAW AND ED TERRY AND PARNELLI JONES WAS QUICK TIME THAT NIGHT.\n\nAND THE BEST PART WAS IT PAID $800 TO WIN.\n\nFOR SURE, A THIRD OF THAT LIST MADE IT TO INDY AND WERE MAJOR NAMES IN OPEN WHEEL RACING.\n\n>> STAN SEEMED TO BE PRETTY NERVOUS BECAUSE I THINK HE REALIZED THIS WAS HIS CHANCE.\n\nHE QUALIFIED WELL, WHICH WAS A SURPRISE RIGHT THERE.\n\nHE RAN WELL IN THE HEAT RACE.\n\nAND HE STARTED, I THINK, THIRD IN THE FEATURE AND HE GOT TO THE LEAD.\n\n>> SO THERE WAS STAN OUT FRONT AND THE CROWD WAS GOING CRAZY, INCLUDING ME.\n\nI THINK EVERYBODY PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS TEMPORARY.\n\nSTAN BEING OUT FRONT.\n\nTHAT JIM HURTUBISE WOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET BY HIM AND PARNELLI JONES, ROGER MCCLUSKEY AND AGAIN JOHNNY RUTHERFORD WAS WORKING HIS WAY UP THROUGH THE FIELD.\n\n>> WHEN HE GOT TO THE LEAD, HE KNEW HOW TO WIN THE RACE.\n\nAND HE PUT THE CAR IN A POSITION WHERE HE WASN'T TAKING UP THE RACETRACK, BUT THE OTHER DRIVER THAT WAS REALLY RUNNING VERY FAST BEHIND HIM, JIM HURTUBISE, A VERY ACCOMPLISHED DRIVER, HAD TO DRIVE AROUND HIM TO GET BY HIM.\n\nSTAN KNEW WHERE TO BE AND WHERE HURTUBISE WOULD HAVE TO BE TO TRY TO PASS HIM.\n\n>> WHEN I SAW HIM, WHAT I SEE IS REALLY A SMART GUY.\n\nON DIRT TRACKS YOU NEED TO FIND WHAT I CALL THE SWEET SPOT.\n\nHE TYPICALLY FOUND IT BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE AND HE WORKED IT THE BETTER.\n\n>> THE RACE SETTLED IN VERY QUICKLY TO A RACE WHERE STAN WAS BASICALLY HOLDING HIS OWN WITH THAT LITTLE RED OFFENHAUSER AND JIM HURTUBISE COULD GET NEXT TO HIM ON THE ONE LAP JIM HURTUBISE WOULD BE ON THE OUTSIDE OF HIM A NEXT LAP JIM HURTUBISE WOULD BR ON THE BOTTOM OF HIM, KIND OF TRYING TO DRIVE UNDERNEATH HIM.\n\nJUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET STAN TO MOVE ASIDE 'CAUSE I'M COMING THROUGH KIND OF ATTITUDE.\n\nTHAT'S THE ATTITUDE THESE DRIVERS HAD.\n\nBUT STAN NEVER MOVED.\n\n>> I WAS STANDING DOWN BETWEEN 3 AND 4, AND I WAS WATCHING HIS DRIVING AND HIS ATTITUDE WITH THE CAR.\n\nTHAT'S THE WAY HE PUT THE CAR INTO THE TURNS.\n\nAND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY HE WAS DOING THE CAR AS A ROOKIE DRIVER.\n\n>> THE BECK FAMILY.\n\nTHERE WAS HAROLD BECK IN THE INFIELD WITH HIS SON SONNY AND THEIR DAUGHTER, DIANE.\n\nSHE WAS 16 YEARS OLD.\n\nSHE WAS STANDING-- WOMEN COULD NOT GO IN THE PITS IN 1962.\n\nBUT SHE WAS ALLOWED IN THE INFIELD.\n\nSO SHE WAS STANDING IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK STANDING OR JUMPING UP AND DOWN-- IS WHAT DIANE BECK TOLD ME-- GOING HYSTERICAL BECAUSE HER DADDY'S CAR WAS LEADING.\n\nIN A USAC RACE.\n\nAND IT JUST, I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THINKING ANY MOMENT HE'LL FINISH SECOND OR HE'LL FINISH FOURTH OR SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO THE CAR, AND IT DIDN'T.\n\nIT JUST DIDN'T.\n\n>> MANY, MANY DRIVERS, INCLUDING MANY VETERAN DRIVERS, WHEN THEY GET TO A POINT LIKE THIS THAT THEY'RE LEADING, AND THEY HAVE SOMEBODY ON THEIR TAIL THAT'S QUITE ACCOMPLISHED, THEY GET RATTLED, AND THEY MAKE MISTAKES AND THEY GET PASSED.\n\nAND JIM HURTUBISE WAS RIGHT BEHIND HIM, WAS A VERY ACCOMPLISHED DRIVER AND HAD A LOT OF SKILLS.\n\nAND JIM HAD EVERY TRICK IN THE BOOK DOWN FROM YEARS OF RACING IN MANY RACES.\n\nAND JIM COULDN'T PULL IT OFF.\n\n>> SO WHAT HAPPENED ON ABOUT LAP 26, IT STARTED RAINING.\n\nTHE FLAGMAN HAD A YELLOW FLAG TO SLOW DOWN THE RACE BECAUSE THE RAIN WOULD MAKE THE TRACK UNDRIVEABLE.\n\nAND I'M SURE-- I JUST KNOW-- THAT STAN BOWMAN AND HURTUBISE, THEY KNEW WHAT WAS COMING.\n\nTHEY FELT THE RAIN.\n\nAND I'M SURE HURTUBISE THOUGHT HE HAD ONE MORE LAP TO GET HIM.\n\nAND I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT ON THAT LAST GREEN LAP, HURTUBISE CAME UP TO THE SIDE, I THINK HURTUBISE PROBABLY COULD HAVE READ THE GAUGES IN STAN'S CAR THEY WERE THAT CLOSE GOING DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH.\n\nAND STAN HELD ON GOING THROUGH THREE AND FOUR AND CAME ACROSS AND THEY THREW THE YELLOW FLAG AND THEN IT STARTED POURING DOWN RAIN.\n\nAND ON THE NEXT LAP, THEY THREW THE RED FLAG AND THE RACE WAS OFFICIALLY OVER.\n\nI THINK A LAP SHORT OF 30 OR TWO LAPS SHORT OF 30.\n\nSTAN PULLED INTO THE INFIELD.\n\nIMMEDIATELY THE CROWD GATHERED BECAUSE HE WON THE RACE.\n\nI SAW THE BECK FAMILY RUN UP TO HIM, DIANE BECK.\n\nHER DAD MUST HAVE BEEN SO PROUD.\n\nAND HER SON.\n\nAND JIM HURTUBISE WALKED UP AFTER THE RACE, AND DIANE BECK TOLD ME, HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD.\n\nHE JUST LOOKED AT STAN AND WINKED AND WALKED AWAY.\n\nHE HAD TAKEN MONEY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF SOME DRIVERS THAT DAY AND THEY DROVE FOR MONEY IN THOSE DAYS.\n\nSO THEY KNEW STAN BOWMAN WAS THERE, AND IT WAS THE REAL DEAL.\n\nTHE CROWD KNEW IT AND I ALWAYS KNEW IT.\n\n>> WAS IT A SURPRISE THAT HE WON?\n\nYES, IT WAS, WITH PARNELLI AND McCLUSKEY AND ALL OF US IN THAT RACE, IT WAS, YOU KNOW, IT SHOWED WHAT STAN HAD AND WHAT HE COULD PRODUCE WITH.\n\n>> THAT WAS THE FIRST USAC RACE THEY EVER RAN AT ELDORA.\n\nAND STAN TOOK 'EM TO SCHOOL THAT DAY.\n\nHE TOOK 'EM TO SCHOOL.\n\nUNBELIEVABLE.\n\n>> TO BE IN THAT KIND OF A RACE WITH THOSE DRIVERS, DRIVERS ON THAT LEVEL TO BE JUST THROWN INTO THAT KIND OF BATTLE IS JUST HARD TO IMAGINE, YOU KNOW.\n\nYOU THINK YOU ARE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO UNTIL YOU ARE PUT AGAINST THE BEST.\n\nAND HE WAS THRUSTED AGAINST THE BEST RIGHT AWAY AND PREVAILED.\n\n>> IN AN ERA WHERE THE MOTORS WERE CHANGING AND CHEVROLET HAD COME INTO THE SPORT AND THE CHEVY MOTORS WERE REALLY STARTING TO FINALLY BEAT THE OFFENHAUSER, THAT WAS KIND-OF TH IF YOU WANTED TO WIN, YOU WANTED A SHOT TO WIN, YOU REALLY NEEDED TO HAVE A CHEVY, AND THAT'S WAS THE PERCEPTION.\n\nAND HERE STAN CAME IN WITH AN OFFENHAUSER AND STILL KICKED THEIR BUTT.\n\n>> STAN'S NEXT USAC SPRINT CAR RACE WOULD BE ANOTHER CHALLENGE, THIS TIME DRIVING ON PAVEMENT AT THE FAMOUS SALEM SPEEDWAY.\n\n>> WELL, SALEM WAS LIKE THE PAVED ELDORA.\n\nIT WAS HIGH BANKED.\n\nWE HAD THREE TRACKS THAT WE RAN A LONG TIME AGO, WINCHESTER INDIANA, SALEM INDIANA AND DAYTON, OHIO.\n\nAND WERE ALL HIGH BANKED TRACKS AND THEY WERE EXTREMELY FAST BEING ON PAVEMENT.\n\nTHEY WEREN'T ALWAYS NICE AND SMOOTH AND THEY WERE YOU RUDDY OR ONE THING OR ANOTHER.\n\nNOT RUDDY BUT THEY HAD BUMPS IN THEM AND WOULD MAKE THE CARS DANCE AROUND.\n\n>> I ENJOYED RACING ON THE HILLS AND I HAD A LOT OF LUCK RACING ON THE HILLS, WE CALLED THEM.\n\nYOU KNOW, THERE AGAIN IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS, YOU KNOW, FIRST PAVEMENT THAT I REALLY RAN AT IMCA WAS AT SALEM ONCE.\n\nAND IT WAS FAST ENOUGH, YOU GET IN THE CORNER AND IT WOULD GET SIDEWAYS.\n\nSO I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO DO THAT.\n\n>> I FLEW OUT OF SALEM AND NOT IN AN AIRPLANE.\n\nI WENT OUT IN A SPRINT CAR OVER THE FENCE IN TURN ONE.\n\nI WAS RUNNING THIRD WHEN I RAN OVER BUTLER'S RIGHT REAR WITH THE LEFT FRONT.\n\nAND IT JUST CAUGHT THE TOP OF THE FENCE, BUT WENT ON OVER AND IN THE BACKGROUND, YOU SEE THE TREES.\n\nWELL, THE TREES ARE WHAT I WENT THROUGH TO GET DOWN TO THE GROUND, WHICH LUCKILY THE BRANCHES HELPED SLOW IT DOWN.\n\nBUT OFF OF THE TURN ONE AND TWO INTO THE RACETRACK IS AN AIRPORT AND I LANDED DOWN FAR ENOUGH DOWN THE BANKING THROUGH THE TREES TO WHERE IT WAS DOWN WHERE THEY ACTUALLY CUT THE GRASS BESIDE THE RUNWAY.\n\n>> ONE OF HIS CAR OWNERS TOLD ME ONE TIME AT SALEM, HE SAID HE WAS STANDING DOWN BETWEEN 1 AND 2.\n\nHE SAID WHEN BOWMAN 20 THROUGH THE CORNER, HE SAID ALL FOUR TIRES HAD SMOKE ROLLING OFF OF T THAT'S PRETTY BRAVE.\n\n>> STAN BOWMAN WAS A DIRT TRACK DRIVER.\n\nSTAN BOWMAN WAS NOT A PAVEMENT ASPHALT DRIVER.\n\nAND SOME DRIVERS WERE VERY GOOD ON ASPHALT.\n\nAND SOME DRIVERS WERE VERY GOOD ON DIRT.\n\nAND THERE WERE A FEW, A.J.\n\nFOYT, PARNELLI JONES, THE NAMES THAT WERE GOOD ON BOTH, IT WAS GOING TO BE A TEST FOR STAN TO SEE IF HE COULD EVEN REALLY COMPETE ON A PAVEMENT TRACK.\n\nAND HE DID.\n\n>> DESPITE HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE ON PAVEMENT, STAN SPED TO A FOURTH PLACE FINISHBEHIND DON BRANSON, ELMER GEORGE AND PARNELLI JONES.\n\nHOWEVER, AFTER THE RACE, HE WAS PENALIZED TWO POSITIONS FOR PASSING DURING A CAUTION FLAG.\n\nSOME BELIEVE THE PENALTY WAS ACTUALLY A WARNING BY THE OFFICIALS TO THE ROOKIE DRIVER AS AN ATTEMPT TO SLOW HIM DOWN.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING WEEKEND, HE RETURNED TO A DIRT TRACK AT NEW BREMEN OHIO, FINISHING THIRD THAT DAY TO JIM HURTUBISE AND PARNELLI JONES.\n\nSTAN WAS SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE OTHER DRIVERS THAT THEY WOULD NOW BE CONTENDING WITH A HOT SHOT ROOKIE FROM COVINGTON, KENTUCKY.\n\n>> I WAS UP AT NEW BREMEN, AND THE CAR OWNER, HAROLD BECK, THAT HE WAS DRIVING FOR, HE WENT OUT ON THE TRACK AND HE WAS POINTING AND GOING LIKE THIS TO HURTUBISE WHO WAS LEADING IT.\n\nAND BOWMAN IS SITTING THERE WITH ONE HAND ON IT AND HE'S GOING LIKE THAT WAS POINTING, SAYING I'M AFTER HIM.\n\nHE NEVER CAUGHT HIM, BUT IT WASN'T FOR TRYING.\n\n>> IN STAN'S SECOND GO AROUND ON PAVEMENT AT INDIANAPOLIS RACEWAY PARK, HE BROKE A TRACK RECORD DURING A SIX-LAP HEAT RACE.\n\nTHE BECK CAR SEEMED UNSTOPPABLE WITH STAN BEHIND THE WHEEL.\n\nBUT IN THE FUTURE RACE, AS STAN FLEW DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH ON THE FIRST LAP, THE CRANK SHAFT BROKE CAUSING THE MOTOR TO EXPLODE IN A RAGE OF SMOKE AND FIRE.\n\n>> BY STAN PUT HIS HANDS UP, HE WARNED THE OTHER DRIVERS, I'VE BROKEN SOMETHING SERIOUS.\n\nGET AWAY FROM ME BECAUSE I COULD BE DUMPING OIL OUT, PARTS OUT.\n\nHE DIDN'T KNOW.\n\nWHEN THE CRANK SHAFT BROKE IN THE OFFENHAUSER THAT DAY, HE HAD ALREADY WON THE HEAT RACE GOING AWAY.\n\nHE WAS OBVIOUSLY FLYING THAT DAY.\n\nBUT FOR AN OFFENHAUSER ENGINE TO KEEP UP WITH THE CHEVROLETS, IT HAS TO BE WOUND AS TIGHT AS IT CAN GO.\n\nYOU ARE REALLY ASKING EVERYTHING OUT OF THAT ENGINE IT CAN GIVE.\n\nAND NOW GRANTED, STAN'S TALENT WAS PHENOMENAL, BUT HIS OFFENHAUSER ENGINE WAS DEFINITELY GIVING ITS ALL THAT D THEY WERE SQUEEZING THE OFFY SO HARD TO RUN WITH THE CHEVYS.\n\n>> THAT NIGHT GOING HOME, DIANE BECK LANG TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS RIDING HOME WITH HER DAD IN HER PICKUP TRUCK, COMING BACK AND SHE SAID IT WAS VERY QUIET IN THE CAR BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE MOTOR WAS GONE.\n\nAND HAROLD BECK SAID TO HIS DAUGHTER, HE SAID, I'VE LOST MY RACE CAR DRIVER.\n\nAND DIANE SAID, WELL NO, DAD, WE'LL GET THE CRANK BACK AND WE'LL GET THE CAR GOING AGAIN AND STAN WILL DRIVE.\n\nAND HE SAID NO, NO, I'VE LOST MY RACE CAR DRIVER.\n\nHE SAID, STAN IS GOING TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY, I'M SURE, TO DRIVE ANOTHER CAR, IMPLYING A BETTER CAR FRANKLY.\n\n>> THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PARTS TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER.\n\nTHEY HAD A CRANK SHAFT COMING FOR THE OTHER ENGINE BUT-- AND THESE OTHER GUYS, THEY WAS WANTING HIM TO DRIVE THEIR CAR.\n\n>> AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS THAT AFTER THE RACE, STAN WAS APPROACHED BY A FELLA NAMED CLYDE GUTZWEILER OF CINCINNATI WHO ALSO HAD A SPRINT CAR DRIVEN BY ANOTHER DRIVER.\n\nWELL, CLYDE, LIKE EVERYBODY, HAD BEEN WATCHING STAN BOWMAN.\n\nAND HE HAD MADE A DECISION THAT HE WENT TO STAN AND OFFERED HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE THE YELLOW NUMBER 19.\n\nAND THE YELLOW NUMBER 19 HAD A CHEVROLET MOTOR IN IT; CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CAR IN SPRINT CAR RACING AT USAC SPRINTS.\n\nCLYDE GUTZWEILER AS A MILITARY MAN AND EVERYTHING WAS SPIT AND POLISH WITH HIM.\n\n>> BUT HE WAS A SPIT SHINE KIND OF GUY.\n\nHE HAD A GUY THAT WORKED FOR HIM, AND THAT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, THE CARS WERE ALWAYS METICULOUSLY MAINTAINED.\n\n>> A WEEK LATER, STAN WAS BACK AT NEW BREMEN.\n\nBUT THIS TIME HE WAS IN A MUCH MORE POWERFUL RIDE, THE GUTZWEILER 19.\n\nRUNNING THE CAR SECOND TO JIM HURTUBISE AND FUTURE HALL OF FAMERS A.J.\n\nFOYT, PARNELLI JONES, JONNY RUTHERFORD AND ROGER McCLUSKEY.\n\nSHORTLY AFTER HIS IMPRESSIVE SHOWING AT NEW BREMEN, CHIEF MECHANIC OF DEAN VAN LINES CLINT BRAWNER, REQUESTED A MEETING WITH STAN AT HIS GARAGE IN GASOLINE ALLEY AT THE INDIANAPOLIS MOTOR SPEEDWAY.\n\n>> CLINT BRAWNER WAS ONE OF THE MOST LEGENDARY INDIANAPOLIS FIGURES OF ALL TIME.\n\nHE FIELDED INDYCARS THAT WERE KNOWN TO BE WINNING RACE CARS.\n\nTO EQUATE HIM TO A GUY TODAY WOULD BE A ROGER PENSKE.\n\nHE WAS THE GUY YOU WANTED TO DRIVE FOR.\n\nIF YOU GOT TAPPED TO DRIVE FOR CLINT BRAWNER, YOU HAD NOT ONLY BEEN CHOSEN BY A GREAT, BUT YOU HAD ALMOST MADE IT JUST RIGHT THERE.\n\nBY BEING CHOSEN, YOU HAVE MADE IT TO AN UPPER ECHELON OF DRIVERS.\n\nTHAT ALONE STANDS IN ITSELF JUST TO HAVE CLINT BRAWNER CHOOSE YOU TO DRIVE ONE OF HIS CARS WHEN THERE'S ENDLESS DRIVERS THAT WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO DRIVE HIS CAR.\n\nAND BRAWNER WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT COULD SEE GREATNESS IN PEOPLE AND HE OBVIOUSLY SAW IT IN STAN.\n\n>> BRAWNER WAS ONE OF THE GUYS THAT, IF YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE FOR, YOU DARN SURE WOULD WANT TO TAKE IT BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD GOOD RACE CARS.\n\nTHEY NEVER BROKE.\n\nTHEY NEVER DID NOT FINISH.\n\nTHEY WERE, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE GOOD.\n\nAND THAT WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO MARIO ANDRETTI WAS WHEN HE GOT HIRED.\n\nBUT THAT WAS NEARLY A YEAR OR MORE AFTER STAN HAD SECURED THE RIDE.\n\n>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, HE WAS SO EXCITED WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO BRAWNER, HE COULDN'T TALK.\n\nHE WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT CAR.\n\nAND HE GOT IN AND SAT DOWN AND HE WANTED TO MEASURE IT UP.\n\nI CAN REMEMBER HE SAID, IF THE PEDALS AIN'T RIGHT AND STUFF AND STAN SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO NOTHING TO THIS CAR.\n\nHE SAID WELL, I WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY YOU ARE SETTING YOUR ASS ON., THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.\n\nSTAN SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT.\n\nHE REALLY TOOK A LIKING TO BOOWMAN.\n\n>> THOSE THINGS KIND OF HAPPEN.\n\nIT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEY ALL GO IN THE GARAGE AND TALK THINGS OVER, AND CLINT MADE HIS WISHES KNOWN, AND STAN SAID YES, I'LL DO IT.\n\n>> I NEVER GOT TO KNOW STAN PERSONALLY.\n\nI THINK IT WAS JUST AT THE CUSP OF MY BREAKING THROUGH TO THAT LEVEL.\n\nHE WAS JUST AHEAD OF ME, AND SO I NEVER GOT TO KNOW HIM.\n\nI MEAN, I KNEW OF HIM AND SO FORTH BECAUSE I KNEW THAT-- I'M ALMOST POSITIVE, AND I'M NOT A HISTORIAN, BUT THAT HE WAS A CANDIDATE FOR MY RIDE WITH DEAN VAN LINES.\n\n>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT OTHER THAN IT WAS JUST A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE FOR CLINT BRAWNER AND THE DEAN VAN LINES.\n\nTHAT WAS SPECIAL.\n\nI MEAN, THAT WAS THE BEST OF THE BEST.\n\n>> KNOWING THAT STAN WOULD BE DRIVING FOR HIM A FEW WEEKS LATER AT LANGHORNE PENNSYLVANIA, CLINT INVITED STAN TO SEE THE USAC CHAMP CAR RACE THAT WEEKEND AT THE MILWAUKEE MILE.\n\n>> WHAT HAPPENED WAS VERY UNIQUE.\n\nAND THE STORY THAT WAS TOLD WAS THE STORY THAT WAS TOLD BY JIM HURTUBISE TO BILLY TEEGARDEN YEARS LATER.\n\n>> JIM HURTUBISE NEVER FORGOT NOBODY.\n\nYEARS LATER I WAS RUNNING WORLD 100 UP THERE, HE CAME DOWN IN THE PITS AND LOOKED ME UP.\n\nI MEAN I HADN'T SEEN HIM ONLY A COUPLE TIMES IN MY LIFE.\n\nHE WAS JUST THAT KIND OF GUY.\n\nSTAN REALLY LIKED HIM.\n\nAND THEY GOT TO BE GOOD FRIENDS QUICK.\n\nWELL, HE TOLD STAN, HE SAID, YOU'RE GOING TO LANGHORNE AND YOU NEED SOME LAPS IN ONE OF THESE CARS.\n\nBECAUSE LANGHORNE-- HE CALLED IT DOWN IN THE HOLE.\n\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT.\n\nBUT HE TOLD STAN, HE SAID, YOU GO UP THERE -- AT THAT TIME, THEY RUBBED THEM TIRES IN A LITTLE BIT AND THEN TAKE THEM OFF, AND WHEN THEY COOLED OFF, THEY WOULD TOUGHEN.\n\nHE SAID RUB SOME TIRES IN FOR ME.\n\nHE SAID, I'LL BE LATE.\n\nI'LL BE LATE.\n\nHE WAS DRIVING JOHN JENKS CAR AND BOWMAN GOT TO DRIVE IT.\n\nHE GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND RUB SOME TIRES IN.\n\nI WAS GLAD HE GOT TO DRIVE AN INDIANPOLIS CAR.\n\nBUT WHEN HE CAME BACK, HE TOLD ME, HE SAYS, HE SAID I'M RUNNING ALONG THERE, YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T WANT TO WRECK THIS CAR.\n\nHE SAID ROGER WARD WENT BY ME ON THE OUTSIDE LIKE I WAS SETTING STILL.\n\nHE SAID WELL, I BETTER GET WITH THE PROGRAM.\n\nSO HE SAID, I RUN HIM DOWN.\n\nI SAID, WELL WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT?\n\nHE SAID, IT SURE MAKES THE WATER RUN OUT OF YOUR EYES.\n\nTHAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.\n\nIT MAKES THE WATER RUN OUT OF YOUR EYES.\n\nYEAH, I WAS TICKLED TO DEATH THAT HE GOT TO DRIVE ONE OF THEM.\n\nHE WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THEM INDIANAPOLIS CARS.\n\nHE WANTED TO RUN THEM.\n\n>> YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT AAA, TRIPLE A, AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION WAS A MAJOR SANCTIONING BODY OF AUTOMOBILE RACES IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\nAND BECAUSE OF THAT CARNAGE THAT YOU MENTIONED, THEY WITHDREW.\n\nAND THAT WAS THE BIRTH OF THE UNITED STATES AUTO CLUB.\n\nTHEY STEPPED IN TO SANCTION IT.\n\n>> WHAT SAFETY GEAR?\n\n[ LAUGHING ].\n\nYES, IT WAS PRETTY PRIMITIVE.\n\nI JUST WISH THAT THEY HAD HAD ARM RESTRAINTS AT ELDORA.\n\n>> THE ROLL BAR OFFERED SOME PROTECTION.\n\nIT DID SAVE A LOT OF LIFE LIVES.\n\nSO IT WAS ABOUT 6 TO 8 INCHES FREQUENTLY BELOW THE TOP OF THE HEAD, SO IF A CAR GOT UPSIDE DOWN, THE IDEA WAS TO GRIP THE STEERING WHEEL TIGHTLY AND DIVE TO THE CELLAR, WHICH WAS THE DOWN END OF THE COCKPIT OF THE CAR TO ROLL THE CAR AND PREVENT BODILY INJURY.\n\nIT DIDN'T ALWAYS WORK.\n\n>> I FLIPPED AN OLD CAR DOWN IN LAWRENCEBURG I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES.\n\nI REMEMBER FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AFTER THAT, I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYMORE, BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A SHOULDER HARNESS.\n\nAND IT BEAT MY BRAINS OUT ON THE STEERING WHEEL.\n\nKNOCKED ALL MY TEETH LOOSE.\n\nAND THEY HAULED ME UP THERE, HAD A 37 PONTIAC AMBULANCE.\n\nTHEY HAULED ME AT THE HOSPITAL AND ROLLED ME IN THERE.\n\nTHIS GUY LOOKED IN THERE AND MY TEETH WAS SMASHED BACK, AND HE REACHED IN THERE AND STRAIGHTENED THEM UP.\n\nHE SAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT OF HERE BECAUSE THEM GUYS AIN'T GOT NO INSURANCE AND GO TO THE DENTIST TOMORROW.\n\n>> IF YOU ARE SCARED, YOU DON'T BELONG THERE.\n\nI MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE CONCERNED, OBVIOUSLY, AND, YOU KNOW, FEEL YOU ARE PREPARED.\n\nBUT YOU GOT TO FEEL-- YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU ARE UP FOR THE JOB.\n\nIF YOU GO IN THERE SCARED, YOU ARE DEFINITELY IN THE WRONG BUSINESS BECAUSE I THINK YOU ARE A MENACE TO YOURSELF AND EVERYBODY ELSE.\n\nWHY?\n\nBECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE TENTATIVE AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.\n\nAND SO, AGAIN, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A FOOL, A BRAINLESS FOOL, BUT YOU CAN'T BE SCARED.\n\n>> SOME PLACES YOU RUN ARE LIKE RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH FIVE IN AND ONE OUT.\n\nYOU KNOW, YOU JUST BETTER BE READY.\n\n>> WELL, YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.\n\nIT'S ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY ELSE.\n\nTHAT'S THE WAY YOU GOT TO FIGURE IT.\n\nALWAYS HAPPENS TO SOMEONE ELSE.\n\n>> YOU LOSE YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS.\n\nTHAT WAS ALWAYS A NEGATIVE.\n\nBUT YOU COULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THE SAFETY ASPECT, I MEAN YOU LOOK AROUND, YOU KNOW.\n\nIT JUST WAS ONLY HOPING, MAYBE IT WON'T HAPPEN TO ME.\n\nMAYBE I WON'T HAVE THAT FLIP SOMERSAULT THAT'S GOING TO STRETCH ME OUT OF THE COCKPIT AND CRUSH ME, YOU KNOW.\n\nBUT YOU KNOW, IT DETERS YOU FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN YOU JUST PUT IT OUT OF YOUR MIND.\n\nYOU HAVE TO.\n\nYOU GOTTA WIN.\n\nTHERE IS NO OTHER WAY.\n\nAND AT LEAST BE UP THERE.\n\nYOU GOT TO BE-- YOU HAVE TO BE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH SOMEWHERE.\n\nAND SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE TO TRY TO IMPRESS SOMEBODY BY MAKING THE RIGHT MOVE, YOU KNOW, TO A TOP GUY LIKE BRANSON OR FOYT OR PARNELLI AT THE TIME.\n\nIT WAS DAUNTING, BUT WHAT THE HECK.\n\nI MEAN, THAT WAS THE CHALLENGE.\n\nAND IF YOU ARE AMBITIOUS, YOU RELISH THOSE CHALLENGES.\n\n>> PEOPLE SEE THAT AND SAY, FOYT, DID YOU THINK ABOUT QUITTING -- NO WAY.\n\nMY FIRST QUESTION WAS HEY, HOW SOON IS IT GOING TO BE BEFORE I CAN GET BACK IN THE RACE CAR?\n\nAND THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS.\n\n>> IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A BAD WRECK, THE QUICKER YOU GET BACK IN THERE THE BETTER OFF YOU ARE.\n\nYOU DON'T SIT AROUND AND THINK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW.\n\nYOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT A WRECK BECAUSE IT'S DONE GONE.\n\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT ONE.\n\nIT AIN'T GON' COME BACK AND BITE YOU.\n\nTHE NEXT ONE IS THE ONE YOU WORRY ABOUT.\n\nAND THEY'RE ALL CAUSED.\n\nTHERE AIN'T NO SUCH THING AS AN ACCIDENT.\n\nEITHER YOU CAUSED IT OR SOMEBODY ELSE CAUSED IT.\n\nIF YOU CAUSED IT, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID WRONG.\n\nAND IF THE OTHER GUY CAUSED IT, YOU CAN'T HELP IT.\n\n>> IT TOOK THE GRACE OF GOD LOOKING AFTER YOU, I MEAN OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE TO USE SOME JUDGMENT, YOURSELF, NO QUESTION.\n\nBUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE KNOW IN RACING AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T HELP.\n\nYOU GET CAUGHT UP IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S MISTAKE.\n\nSO THAT'S THE ISSUE, YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU PREVENT THAT?\n\nI DON'T KNOW, ONLY BY THE GRACE OF GOD.\n\nYOU HAVE TO BE LUCKY SOMEWHERE BECAUSE AGAIN NOT EVERYTHING IS UNDER YOUR CONTROL.\n\nBUT YOU KNOW, SOME OF US WERE, SOME OF US WEREN'T.\n\n>> ONE WEEK AFTER THE RACE AT MILWAUKEE, STAN WOULD BE DRIVING FOR GUTZWEILER AT THE TERRE HAUTE ACTION TRACK.\n\nCLINT BRAWNER WATCHED FROM THE INFIELD AS STAN WARMED UP THE YELLOW NUMBER 19 PRIOR TO THE THIRD HEAT RACE THAT DAY.\n\n>> CLINT BRAWNER HATED, LITERALLY HATED SPRINT CARS BECAUSE HE SAW DRIVERS GET KILLED AND MANGLED IN THEM.\n\nHE NOTED IN HIS BOOK A YEAR BEFORE AT TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA, HE SAW A DRIVER RACING WITH JIM HURTUBISE, THEY GOT TANGLED UP, AND THE DRIVER FLIPPED A NUMBER OF TIMES, AND THE CAR LANDED ON TOP OF THE DRIVER AND THE DRIVER'S CAREER WAS OVER.\n\nSO BRAWNER CAME TO TERRE HAUTE AND WAS GOING TO GO TO TERRE HAUTE, I GUESS, WITH MUCH TREPIDATION ABOUT HIS DRIVER NOW SITTING IN A SPRINT CAR RACING AT THE TERRE HAUTE RACETRACK.\n\n>> I HAD HEARD ABOUT STAN BOWMAN.\n\nHE HAD WON AT ELDORA IN AN UNDERPOWERED OFFENHAUSER ENGINE AGAINST THE V8s THAT HURTUBISE AND PARNELLI JONES WERE RUNNING AND WE WERE ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IN JUNE 1962 AT TERRE HAUTE.\n\nTHERE WAS A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT AND THEY WOULD HYPE DRIVERS THAT WERE COMING LIKE PARNELLI JONES, A.J.\n\nFOYT, HURTUBISE, ROGER McCLUSKEY.\n\nAND THEY PROMOTED STAN BOWMAN AS THE NEXT BRIGHT STAR OF USAC SPRINT RACING AND POSSIBLY LEADING TO RIDE AT THE 500.\n\nI THINK HIS SUCCESS CERTAINLY OPENED THE DOOR AT ELDORA; HIS WIN AGAINST AN UNDERPOWERED RACE CAR AGAINST THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE BEST.\n\nTHERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT HURTUBISE AND FOYT AND PARNELLI WERE THE STARS OF THE SHOW AND WOULD SHOW YOU THE WAY TO RUN A RACE CAR AND THE PATH TO THE INDIANAPOLIS MOTOR SPEEDWAY.\n\nAND SO IT WAS HIS BIG OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT BREAK TO RUN AGAINST THEM AT TERRE HAUTE.\n\n>> HE QUALIFIED-- THEY HAD QUALIFICATIONS BEFORE THE RACE, AS THEY USUALLY DO.\n\nHE GOT ASSIGNED TO A HEAT RACE.\n\nAND SO WHEN STAN BOWMAN WAS WARMING UP FOR THE HEAT RACE, BEFORE THE RACE, YOU GET OUT AND RUN A COUPLE LAPS TO GET YOUR CAR WARM AND YOUR TIRES WARM.\n\n>> IT WAS THE THIRD HEAT RACE, AND BOWMAN WAS IN THAT RACE.\n\nI REMEMBER HIM COMING OFF FOUR.\n\nIT WAS IN THE 19 GUTZWEILER CAR, SPRINT CAR, CHEVY ENGINE, THAT HE CAN COMPETE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE TRACK.\n\nHE CAME OFF 4, AND I REMEMBER SEEING THE BRIGHT YELLOW CAR COME DOWN FRONT STRAIGHTAWAY.\n\nHE LET UP GOING INTO ONE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN INSTEAD OF TURNING LEFT, THE CAR WENT VIOLENTLY DUG INTO THE TRACK.\n\n>> THE RIGHT FRONT FOLD UNDER, THEN THE CAR JUST STARTED FLIPPING.\n\n>> HE STARTED FLIPPING LATERALLY.\n\nAND WENT OVER THE WALL.\n\n>> ALL I COULD SEE WAS THAT GUARDRAIL THERE AND NO ROLL CAGE OVER, JUST THE SINGLE BAR BEHIND HIM.\n\nAND I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE TROUBLE.\n\nI JUMPED OUT OF THAT SEAT, AND I WAS ALMOST THERE BEFORE HE WAS.\n\nBECAUSE THAT WAS MY BUDDY, THAT WAS STAN BOWMAN.\n\n>> IF YOU SAW A DRIVER FLIP LIKE THAT, HE HAD A PROBABLY 50% CHANCE IF NOT SERIOUS INJURY, FATALITY.\n\nTHERE WAS A HUSH IN THE CROWD.\n\nEVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS NOT A GOOD SCENE.\n\n>> AS FAR AS THE ACCIDENT, I WAS THERE LIKE ANY OTHER RACE, PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN REALLY THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, FROM ANY OTHER ACCIDENT HE HAD EVER HAD.\n\nME AND MY MOM AND ANOTHER FAMILY, YOU KNOW, WAS USUALLY WITH US IT SEEMED LIKE WHEN WE WOULD GO TO THE RACES.\n\nAND WE WERE JUST SITTING IN THE GRANDSTANDS JUST GETTING READY FOR THE NEXT RACE, AND THE CAR WAS ON THE TRACK.\n\nAND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THEN THE CAR JUST STARTED FLIPPING AND LEFT THE TRACK.\n\nI MEAN, YOU KNEW IT WAS PROBABLY WORSE THAN A NORMAL WRECK.\n\n>> BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE HOSPITAL, HIS FACE HAD STARTED TO SWELL FROM THE DAMAGE, AND I JUST KNEW IT WASN'T GOOD.\n\nKNEW IT WASN'T GOOD.\n\nBUT I KNEW STAN WAS TOUGH.\n\nHE WAS THE IRON MAN, BUT I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE BAD.\n\n>> DID YOU THINK HE MIGHT COME OUT OF IT?\n\n>> I WAS PRAYING.\n\nAND AT THAT TIME, I WAS NOT A PRAYING PERSON, TRUST ME.\n\nBUT I LOVED STAN BOWMAN, AND I WAS PRAYING AND CRYING AND CARRYING ON.\n\nHE WAS MY BUDDY.\n\n>> I KNOW WHEN HE GOT HURT, I WAS RUNNING GLEN ESTE.\n\nI COME IN, AND THEY TOLD ME STAN GOT HURT TODAY.\n\nI SAID AHH, YOU KNOW, I NEVER DREAMED YOU COULD EVER HURT HIM.\n\nTHEY SAID YEAH, HE WAS HURT PRETTY BAD.\n\nSO I GOT ME AND GEORGE, THE GUY HE DROVE MODIFIED, WE WENT TO TERRE HAUTE THE NEXT DAY.\n\nI WENT UP THERE.\n\nI SAID I'M GOING UP THERE AND SEE BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T PAY NO ATTENTION TO WHAT PEOPLE TELL YOU.\n\nAND WHEN I WENT IN UP THERE, THEY HAD HIM UP IN INTENSIVE CARE, AND THIS LADY COME OUT AND SHE SAID WELL, YOU WANT TO COME IN, AND I SAID YEAH, I DO.\n\nI SAID, GEORGE, DO YOU WANT TO GO?\n\nHE SAID NO, YOU GO AHEAD.\n\nSO I WENT IN THERE AND I KNEW HE WAS GONE, YOU KNOW.\n\nAND I TALKED TO HER AND I SAID WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?\n\nSHE SAID, WELL, HONEY, THERE AIN'T NO CHANCE FOR HIM.\n\nSAID HE HADN'T BREATHED SINCE HE LEFT THE RACETRACK.\n\nTHEY PUT THAT THING IN HIS NECK AND THEY HAD A MACHINE RUNNING THERE THAT WAS BREATHING FOR HIM.\n\nSHE SAID THE ONLY THING, HE'S JUST GOT A FAINT HEARTBEAT BUT WHEN THAT'S OVER, IT'S OVER.\n\nSO THIS ARM HERE, I KNOW WAS BROKE IN SEVERAL PLACES BECAUSE IT WAS REAL CROOKED, AND HIS NECK WAS SWELLED OUT REAL BAD.\n\nSO I WENT AROUND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED, AND I DID GET TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM.\n\n>> THEN FIVE DAYS LATER, AFTER THE ACCIDENT, IS WHEN HE DIED.\n\nI WAS STAYING AT THE CONNERS' HOUSE, YOU KNOW, WHO MY DAD HAD DROVE THE MODIFIED FOR BEFORE, SO I WAS THERE PROBABLY HALF MY CHILDHOOD ANYWAY.\n\nAND SHE CALLED ME IN THE HOUSE AND TOLD ME.\n\nIT WAS, YOU KNOW, LIFE CHANGING, TO SAY THE LEAST.\n\n>> I WAS REALLY AMAZED THAT SOMETHING FAILED ON THEIR CAR.\n\nBUT I MEAN THEY WORKED VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT FIRST CLASS OPERATION OUT OF WHAT THEY DID.\n\n>> IN THAT DAY AND AGE, GUYS WANTED THEIR CARS PRETTY.\n\nIT WAS A PRIDE THING TO HAVE BEAUTIFUL RACE CARS, LOTS OF SHINY PAINT, LOTS OF CHROME, LOTS OF POLISHED MAGNESIUM.\n\nSO GUYS WOULD CHROME EVERYTHING ON THE RACE CAR, INCLUDING THE SUSPENSION.\n\nTHE FRONT AXLES IN THESE SPRINT CARS ARE A ROUND A ROUND TUBE.\n\nAND AT THE END OF THE ROUND TUBE, IT GETS NOTCHED, AND A VERTICAL TUBE SLID INSIDE AND WELDED IN.\n\nIT'S A KINGPIN MOUNT.\n\nTHE SPINDLE ROTATES ON THAT PIN.\n\nBUT THAT PIN ALSO HOLDS THE ENTIRE SUSPENSION UP.\n\nYOUR ENTIRE FRONT WHEEL IS HELD ON THE CAR BY THAT ONE WELD ON THE AXLE.\n\nIT'S A LONG WELD.\n\nIT GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND THE AXLE, AROUND THE PIN, AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT WELD.\n\nWHEN YOU CHROME STEEL, YOU SAND IT DOWN, YOU GRIND IT DOWN AND IF THERE IS A HARD EDGE OR AN UGLY EDGE, YOU GRIND THAT SMOOTH SO THAT THE CHROME LOOKS PRETTY.\n\nAND WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THE CHROME SHOP HAD GROUND THE WELDS DOWN TO MAKE THEM PRETTY.\n\nWELL, OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU GRIND A WELD DOWN, YOU ARE GRINDING THE STRENGTH OUT OF IT, AND IN TURN, THE WELD BROKE, WHICH, WHEN THAT WELD BREAKS, THE CAR DROPS DOWN TO THE GROUND, THE SUSPENSION DIGS INTO THE SOFT DIRT, AND IT CATAPULTS THE CAR INTO THE AIR.\n\n>> I GOT A CALL A FEW YEARS AGO FROM A FELLOW, WHO IS NOW IN HIS 60s.\n\nAND HE CALLED ME, AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS.\n\nI PICKED THE PHONE UP, AND HE TOLD ME HIS NAME.\n\nAND HE SAID, I NEED YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING.\n\nHE SAID, I READ THE STORY OF STAN BOWMAN.\n\nHE SAID, I WAS AT TERRE HAUTE ON JUNE 17 THAT DAY.\n\nI WAS 10 OR 11 YEARS OLD, AND I WENT THERE TO SEE MY FAVORITE DRIVER DRIVE, JIM HURTUBISE.\n\nI WAS THERE WITH MY DAD.\n\nWE DROVE UP TO THE PARKING LOT WITH MY DAD AND MY YOUNGER BROTHER.\n\nWE GOT THERE LATE BECAUSE WE WERE AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE HAVING LUNCH AND WE COULDN'T GET AWAY.\n\nHE SAID, WE GOT OUT OF THE CAR, AND WE WENT TO THE BACK OF THE CAR TO RAISE THE TRUNK UP TO GET SOME SANDWICHES OUT OF IT.\n\nIN THOSE DAYS IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL TO BRING YOUR SANDWICHES TO A RACETRACK AND MAYBE A LITTLE COOLER WITH A DRINK OR TWO.\n\nAND HE SAID, I HEARD SOMETHING AND I LOOKED UP, AND I SAW A YELLOW RACE CAR COMING AT US, FLIPPING.\n\nHE SAID THE CAR LANDED 20 FEET FROM US.\n\nHE SAID ONE MORE FLIP, AND IT WOULD HAVE HIT OUR CAR.\n\nAND HE SAID THERE WAS SMOKE AND NOISE AND SOUNDS OF WATER AND HISSING.\n\nAND HE SAID, WHEN THAT CLEARED, I SAW STAN BOWMAN SLUMPED OVER IN THE CAR.\n\nHE SAID, I KNEW IT WAS STAN BOWMAN BECAUSE I SAW THE CAR NUMBER, AND I STARTED FOLLOWING HIM A LITTLE BIT.\n\nHE SAID, EVEN AT 10 YEARS OLD, I KNEW IT WAS OVER.\n\nHE SAID, I'VE BEEN WAITING 50 YEARS TO TELL SOMEBODY.\n\nHE SAID, I WAS WALKING BY AND I SAW ON THE BOOKSHELF A STORY ABOUT STAN, SO I HAD TO CALL AND TELL YOU.\n\nI THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.\n\nTHAT'S NOT UNUSUAL IN RACING.\n\nYOU DON'T GET OVER THOSE THINGS RIGHT AWAY.\n\nMAYBE YOU NEVER GET OVER THEM.\n\nSO STAN BOWMAN'S CAREER WAS OVER AND SO WAS HIS LIFE.\n\n>> CLINT BRAWNER REALLY LIKED HIM, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DID IT, BUT HE HAD A UNIFORM MADE FOR STAN TO BE BURIED IN, DEAN VAN LINES RACING UNIFORM.\n\nBUT IT FIT HIM PERFECTLY.\n\n>> THE ONLY SAVING GRACE TO THE SITUATION WITH STAN WAS THAT THAT TRAGEDY CATAPULTED USAC TO MAKE A RULE ABOUT CHROME IN THE FRONT AXLES.\n\nAFTER THAT, RULE CHANGES WERE MADE.\n\nRACE CARS WERE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO HAVE CHROME FRONT AXLES, NO CHROME SPINDLES, NO CHROME STEERING COMPONENTS.\n\nSO THEY KIND OF COVERED EVERYTHING IN ONE SWOOP, WHICH WAS NEEDED.\n\n>> STAN CERTAINLY HAD, LIKE I SAY, HE HAD THE TALENT TO PROBABLY HAVE MADE IT, BUT HE HAD SPRINT CAR-ITIS.\n\nTHEY BREAK.\n\nAND HIS BROKE AT THE WRONG TIME AND DID HIM IN AND THAT WAS REALLY SAD.\n\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING TO SEE STAN ON A MILE DIRT TRACK IN A BIG CAR.\n\n>> WELL, IF HE GOT INTO A DEAN VAN LINES CAR, HE MIGHT HAVE WON THE INDIANAPOLIS 500.\n\nIT WAS A CREDIBLE ENTRY, AND THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE HIM A SHOT AT THAT.\n\nALL YOU NEED IS THAT SHOT TO PROVE YOURSELF, A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AND A LOT OF PERSEVERANCE AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM.\n\nHE WAS CAPABLE OF DOING THAT.\n\n>> THERE ARE VERY FEW GUYS THAT GET-- IT'S LIKE A BALANCE.\n\nI DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT.\n\nBUT THEY SEEM TO ACQUIRE A GIFT, I GUESS YOU
