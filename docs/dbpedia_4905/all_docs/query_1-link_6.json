Was this the last time this happened in a World Championship Grand Prix?",

        "text": "In a preview to the 1938 Tripolis GP in Automobil Revue I found note, that shared drives were explicitely forbidden for that race. So it seems to have been open for organisers to decide how to handle this in \"their\" event. Was this still the case after the World Championship had been introduced, or was there a general ruling now allowing to share cars at least in the races counting for the championship?\n\nAt least from 1958 onward for a while the exclusion of shared drives seems to have been only for the championship classification. Shared drives were not forbidden, only the drivers involved could not score points. But could they still take away positions and points from other drivers?\n\nTo find some answers I browsed through my records of the GP/GE (\"Grande Epreuves\") history. The first occasion of a shared drive I found right at the beginning in the 1906 French GP, where Jenatzy handed over to Burton for the second day, but this seems to have been rather exception than normailty. For the 1912 I found one further example, Anford and Pilain in the Rolland-Pilain. The next occasion then was the Italian GP of 1924, where Pastore took over the Alfa Romeo from Campari. And in 1925 the Delage team performed two driver changes at the French GP with Benoist/Divo and Wagner/Torchy.\n\nDelage were also the first to have \"regular\" changes when the exhaust of their 1926 model caused burn injuries to their driver´s arms, so that they could not stand a whole race long. They solved the problem for 1927 so the number of driver changes decreased again until finally in 1931, with the new 10-hour-rule it became more or less inevitable, that the cars were entered for two drivers.\n\nThis seams to have broken a barrier for during the thirties itobviously became a tactical trick by the factory teams to always enter some \"back-up-cars\" driven by newcomers, which could be taken over by their top-drivers in case their own cars got technical problems. Maybe, like modern-day team orders, this was now recognised for the first time as a \"problem\", or why else would the organisers of the Tripolis GP would have explicitely forbidden driver changes during the race?\n\nThe interesting thing is also, that for 1939 I did not find a single occasion of a shared drive in the four GE events of the season. Was this only incidential, was there a general rule by the AIACR or was there only a sort of common agreement among the organisers?\n\nAfter the war GP racing started over again with shared drives. In Britain it seems to have been quite normal for private drivers to even buy shares of a car and to agree on planned share-drives with thir partners. The climax then came in the 1956 where driver changes seem to have been almost more regular than single drivers per car plus of course also many other means of driver support for their team leaders (like Piotti´s pushing action for Moss at the Italian GP (and Piotti wasn´t even officially \"team partner\", but driving under his own entry instead!).\n\nSuch behaviour must have been the final cause for debates, as the number of shared drives became already dramatically reduced in 1957 and then with the exclusion from championship points came almost to a halt in 1958. The last occasions from then onward I found were Lewis-Evans/Brooks (Vanwall), French GP 1958, Gregory/Shelby (Centro Sud-Maserati), Italian GP 1958 and then the already mentioned Fairman/Moss (Walker-Ferguson), British GP 1961, Gendbien/Gregory (BRP), US GP 1961 and finally Spnce/Clark (and vice versa) for Lotus, US GP 1964."
