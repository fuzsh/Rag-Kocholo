I am totally in awe of these two drivers, they are way ahead of everyone else! Bubby won 2 CRA championships with 81 CRA victories and according to Kevin Eckert over 220 total of wins back East before he came to California. I tried to research his wins years ago talking with family and Larry Henry, but no one kept a list as he was barnstorming the country for years. He was a very patient driver, to a point, as he moved to the front and occasionally a little tap let them know he wanted by. Watching the Dean and Bubby show was amazing, but his Ascot years were much of the same. Unlike today with fewer heros, in his racing years there were a lot of heavy hitters racing against him, and he prevailed a lot! I only wish I could have seen him at Eldora as a young man and he said it was his favorite track for many years. Bubby's warmth gave me a great feeling as I knew I was talking with a giant in our racing, yet he gave me a lot of his time and I still revel in those times with him.\n\nNot being much of a collector of racing things because everything I collected went to make money for the low buck teams, so the time passed me by and I had very few things on my bucket list for me personally. Yet the three most desired items were always helmets from Bubby, his son Tony and Lealand. Tony made that happen for me last year thankfully, but I never even asked my two heroes, it wasn't the right time and now time has passed. But the memories I have of Bubby on the track are pretty well still planted in my memory, so I only need to sit back and roll the saved scenes thru my mind, and I'm happy with that.\n\nThese last two paragraphs from wikipedia\n\nNorman \"Bubby\" Jones (born June 4, 1941, Danville, Illinois), is a former driver in the USAC Sprint Car series, with 22 victories, and a member of the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame, inducted in 1998. He also raced in the USAC Championship Car series, in the 1977-1978 seasons, with 2 career starts, including the 1977 Indianapolis 500. He failed in qualifying attempts at Indy in 1978 and 1981.\n\nIn 1980 \"Ol' Bub\" headed west to run in the prestigious California Racing Association (C.R.A.) Sprint Car Series as a regular, driving the Gas Chem Products Entry. After finishing 2nd in the C.R.A. Point Standings three years in a row (198082) behind Dean Thompson, Jones persuaded car owner Dan Kazarian to change from the Stanton Chassis they had been running, and to let Jones build them a new car himself. The result...Jones won two consecutive C.R.A. Point Series Championships (198384). In 1984, Jones won the coveted Pacific Coast National Open at Ascot, holding off a fast closing Steve Kinser despite blistering the right rear tire with 10 laps to go. Jones became one of the most well liked and highly respected drivers in the C.R.A. Series because of his straight, smooth and clean driving style.\n\nMOTOR RACING : Drivers Honor Jones and Try to Beat Him July 26, 1990|PAT RAY\n\nNorman (Bubby) Jones is hoping for one more flourish in a successful five-week run when his peers in the California Racing Assn. sprint car ranks both honor him and compete against him Saturday night at Ascot Park.\n\nAlthough the featured driver this week easily could have been Billy Boat, who scored his first Ascot main event victory last Saturday, Jones' runner-up finish was also significant, showing that at 49 he can still challenge the likes of Boat, 24, and others half his age. To celebrate Jones' hot streak, early arrivals at Saturday's race will be given an autographed photo of the former two-time CRA champion.\n\nHe is in the midst of a streak reminiscent of his heyday in the early 1980s when he and retired Dean Thompson dominated the local sprint car ranks for five seasons.\n\nOl' Bub, as he is known around the track, came out of a two-year retirement this season to drive a Clark Drake-built car owned by Larry Henry, a lifelong friend who grew up with Jones in Danville, Ill., before moving to California.\n\nJones and Henry scored their first victory of his comeback during the CRA's annual Midwest Tour, when he won at Vermillion Speedway in his old hometown on a program honoring him. In addition, he was the top point-winner on the tour despite admitting that he was far from being in top shape after his long layoff.\n\nJones started his streak with a third place in a 30-lapper on June 30, then won the Firecracker 50 for the third time on July 3, and he has been second in the last two main events.\n\nAlthough his streak is impressive, it is only the latest in a distinguished career. In the 1970s, Jones and Rick Ferkel of Ohio were the forerunners of what is now known as touring racers. They were on the road all summer, taking on all comers on their home tracks and usually coming out on top.\n\nIn 1977, Jones gave up his nomadic existence to compete in the United States Auto Club sprint car ranks. He posted 22 USAC victories, including 11 in 1979 when he led the point standings until the final race of the season before losing the championship. He also competed in the 1977 Indy 500, finishing 21st after starting last.\n\nThe next year, he came West to drive in CRA competition, and is second in career victories with 79. Thompson retired with 103.\n\nJones also set a one-season CRA victory record with 18 in 1983--the first of his two consecutive championship seasons--after finishing second three years in a row behind Thompson. Oddly enough, his first Ascot victory did not come in a sprint car. It was in a midget in 1975, when he won the Turkey Night Grand Prix. He is one of only three drivers to win both the CRA championship and the Turkey Night midget race. The others are Rick Goudy and Ron Shuman.\n\nJones' streak is frustrating the four-man group fighting for the title he twice held."
