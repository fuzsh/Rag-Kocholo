This I can promise you; that when the news is released, hillclimb enthusiasts will set to work on their cars with great zest\".\n\nThe Car, October issue, 1935\n\nIn 1935, members of the Light Car Club of Australia inspected a property in Christmas Hills, some thirty kilometres north-east of Melbourne, known as Clinton's Pleasure Grounds, a picnicking venue which included the Rob Roy Shetland Pony Stud, a swimming hole, tennis courts, a cricket and football field, tea room and dance hall.\n\nTheir mission was to establish a Hillclimbing venue. Hillclimbing, a speed event in which drivers compete, one at a time, on an uphill course against the clock, is one of motorsport’s oldest events; the first was held at La Turbie near Nice, France, in 1897.\n\nOpening on February 1, 1937, the Rob Roy Hillclimb was the first purpose-built Hillclimb in Australia. Cut out of the bush, it included an uphill half-mile, graded dirt road, a judges box and telephone boxes at the start and finish. In 1939, the track was sealed and became one of only three bitumen-surfaced purpose-built hillclimbs in the world, the other two being the Shelsley Walsh and Prescott courses in the UK.\n\nThe Rob Roy Hillclimb has a special place in Australia’s motoring history, with eight record holders going on to become Australian Grand Prix winners and one – Jack Brabham – a triple F1 World Champion. The roll call of other drivers who displayed their skills at the Rob Roy includes Harry Firth, Stan Jones, Lex Davison, Bill Patterson, Doug Whiteford, Peter Whitehead, Reg Hunt, Diana Davison Gaze, Tony Gaze and Len Lukey.\n\nThe Rob Roy Hillclimb was more than a racing event, it was a culture. Connected to Formula One racing, celebrities, champion drivers, patrons, collectors, and prestige and iconic cars, the Rob Roy had an aura of glamour, and club meets were social occasions, with drivers adhering to collar and tie dress codes and picnickers fashionably attired.\n\nNevertheless the cars were central. Over the years Bugattis, Jaguars, MGs, Falkenbergs, Oldses and Altas have competed with Australian makes such as Holdens, Fords and Elfins, from road cars to specialist cars. Many Australian cars started or developed their racing history at Rob Roy, including the Chamberlain, Maybach, BWA, Wyliecar, Klienig Special, the Walton JAP, and numerous other Australian Specials.\n\nThe Specials were modified and home-built cars. Hillclimbs make particular demands – lightweight cars with loads of torque are ideal – and so engines were upgraded, bodies stripped, cars were made up of the most suitable parts or whatever one had access to. The Specials were evidence of the culture of creativity and passion that surrounded the Hillclimb. Many cars, some pre-war, and modified constantly over time, have passed from driver to driver along with their history, to compete to this day.\n\nIn 1962, bushfires ravaged the Rob Roy, and it lay unused for another 30 years until the MG Car Club of Victoria secured a lease on the property and faithfully restored the track to host a bustling schedule of Hillclimb events. Since 1993, the Rob Roy Hillclimb culture – the drivers, the cars, the inventive mechanics and the enthralled daytrippers – thrives in the Christmas Hills.\n\nSources: Leon Sims, A history of Rob Roy Hillclimb - 1937 to 1961 - The Hill, The Drivers, The Cars. And, the MG Car Club of Victoria\n\nFilm - Sophie Boord (producer), 'A Day at the Rob Roy Hillclimb', 2012\n\nVICTOR SPITERI: What I like about the Rob Roy Hillclimb, it always seems to be a very semi-formal event. And it's also very friendly. A lot of friendly people get here.\n\nNIGEL GRAY: Rob Roy's sacred because it was about the first hillclimb they got going after the war.\n\nPAUL SCHILLING: The oldest upriding hillclimb in Australia, second only to Shelsley Walsh in England in the world. It has a fabulous history, and here we are doing it all again.\n\nTREVOR COLE: First time I drove here was about 1965. And, from then on, off and on, particularly in the last few years.\n\nBRONWYN EDWARDS: This is actually my first race in this car. This is my dad's car and this is my first event and my first race. I love that it's something I can do with my dad and be involved with my brother, and then hopefully maybe my son will do it one day.\n\nGRAHAM HOINVILLE: I've got two younger sons than Greg, and they're all involved in the sport in different ways. I suppose we're a motorsport family.\n\nNIGEL GRAY: The cars are very interesting. Every car is different.\n\nGRANT KELLY: I like the different nose. A lot of the other Formula Vs have a narrow nose. This one's apparently more aerodynamic and a little bit more unique, and that's what I like about this one.\n\nPAUL SCHILLING: I've got this 500, which is called the 'Falkenberg Jinx'. It was built in Nunawading in 1958. At that stage, it had a 350 Velocette motor in it and little skinny tyres and wheels and things. It's gone through about five owners, and on the way through it's picked up a Kawasaki triple motor, which it's got in here now, out of a 500cc Kawasaki motorbike, which was noticed as a widow maker, and it runs on alcohol, and it's a nasty little beast when it gets going.\n\nDARREN VISSER: The car was made by Leo Bates in 1966. It's probably one of the first that he built, and he's made probably about five or six. Three of 'em still exist today.\n\nMAN: It's a very nice track.\n\nDAVID BELL: The thing about the track is that it appears like it's fairly simple. I mean, there's essentially only sort of two-and-a-half or three corners. Technically, it's in fact extraordinarily difficult and challenging.\n\nJOHN COFFIN: Turn one, which is the one that's up the top there, the first bend, that's known as 'Old Tin Shed Corner', and that is an off-camber corner. You come into the corner and you go out of the corner, and that's how the track goes.\n\nNIGEL GRAY: It's quite a thrill to go around that right-hander with your wheels slipping. Quite a thrill.\n\nPAUL SCHILLING: The faster you go, the more corners there are. They close in on you very quickly, and when you're doing it in, say, under 30 seconds, you've really got to have your wits about you. You're twice over before you start.\n\nDAVID BELL: To put together the perfect run is absolutely satisfying and something that I don't know if I've even yet done although I've probably driven up hundreds of times.\n\nFilm - Sophie Boord, 'Harry Firth commentary on early footage of the Rob Roy Hillclimb', 2012\n\nWho am I? (Laughs) Oh, it's hard to say. I'd better get my book and read it out.\n\nRob Roy was an institution because there weren't many race meetings then and this was like a weekend... get-together with the sporting fraternity, and they could get boozed and carry on and rush up and down the hill, you know, walk around in their fancy gear and that.\n\nIt was sort of an introduction to motorsport as far as I was concerned. And I used to go to all the meetings.\n\nThis is 1947. First meeting after the war.\n\nThat's a homebuilt car.\n\nNow, this is John Barraclough in the NE Magnette.\n\nThat's an SS Jaguar. Yeah, a much more exotic car.\n\nBut everything's stripped off to make it go faster.\n\n(Speaks indistinctly) These are MGs and things lined up.\n\nThat's a Ford V8 Special.\n\nWell, especially as a homebuilt car.\n\nYeah, you get a whole heap of bits from the disposals or wherever, or it's laying under people's houses. You could put it together and make a car.\n\nAnd the homebuilt cars were better than the factory ones, 'cause they were purposely built to go up Rob Roy.\n\nAnd this is a speed car. Now, they would drive these on the speedway, but they decided that they'd run them at Rob Roy. And the strange thing is they beat everyone. So they banned them.\n\nSee, where they went up round there... you aim about a yard in over the dirt. By the time you got there, you'd be just on the edge of the track and drifting the car and pointing straight up the hill.\n\nYou either got it right or wrong. There was no in-between.\n\n(Speaks indistinctly)\n\nYou see? Just look at it, look at it. It was a dirt track.\n\nAnd you're doing upwards towards 100mph.\n\nAnd this was later. This is a bitumen track. This was 1950.\n\nAnd see how the track is a lot better?\n\nThis is a typical Rob Roy family gathering. Yeah, the picnic basket, the Esky.\n\nYou weren't supposed to drink until after the meeting. But if you weren't competing, they didn't worry about that.\n\nThat's Alan Whalley. He was the Lord Mayor of Melbourne. And he liked motorsport.\n\nNow, cars like this were driven on the road.\n\nAs long as it had a number plate and a horn and a registration label. That's all what was required. It didn't matter whether they had a body, a loud exhaust or whatever. That's the way it worked.\n\nNow, they'd take all the mud guards and everything off, you see, because it would go faster like that.\n\nAnd that's Barbara Whalley. Now, no crash hat or anything like that. She drove in this scarf.\n\nThe last time I ran there was... I had a very famous MG. It was the fastest MG in the world.\n\nAnd this American came out here, and I'd take him for a ride around where my house was at 12 o'clock at night, you know, burning around the back streets and everything. You know. And... we headed to Rob Roy. I gave a demonstration run, and broke the class record. So that was the last run I had at Rob Roy in that sort of car.\n\nFilm - Sophie Boord, 'Paula Elstrek discusses the Rob Roy Hillclimb', 2012\n\nHi. My name is Paula Elstrek, and I'm the fastest woman in four wheels. Yeah, I did a lot of local hill climbing. But Rob Roy was a hill climb track that had a great history. One of the events I inquired and they gave me permission to bring my car down. I don't think they thought I was going to break their track record. With hill climbing, they have fastest outright time, and then they always have fastest woman.\n\nBack then, it was like, I hope they have the fastest man of the day, like turn it around, because now, a female holds the track record. But they were really supportive when our family went down there. I had trouble with the car. It had broken welds. They got a farmer down the road to turn up in this old car that looked like that needed to be welded and fixed, not mine.\n\nAnd people helped me get it ready to actually compete and able to run a couple of extra runs. So that, I think, made it an more special victory. I've driven many different types of motor sport, from go-carting, to sprints, to dirt racing offered, salt lakes with jet cars. But I think the thing about hill climbing is you're racing against yourself really. You need to get everything ready and make that one perfect run.\n\nAnd it's very easy to make a mistake, and you've lost a couple of tenths of a second. We might have lost a championship because of one corner or leading into one corner. If you want to be a good driver, you need to be a good mechanic and understand your car. The car I was driving, the Piranha was 1,100 cc, GSX motorbike engine, former libra cart. I did a lot of body modifications and just tailored it, I suppose, to suit my driving style and myself.\n\nThen the next step, I was supposed to get more speed, just make the engine bigger and faster, so I did a lot of modifications and worked with an engine developer, and we built a really strong hill climb engine. Your best hill climb engine is something that's really quick, but only for that short distance. So if you did a lap of Bathurst with it, it would blow up and destroy itself. So you want something like a drag engine. Once that was then designed and finished, then I did body modifications.\n\nSo I changed the suspension, did different aerodynamics with the body work, just tailored little bits and pieces to suit different tracks too at times. Spending time in that garage, it's like therapy. You've got to get everything right. And if you know about how your car's going to handle, then you've got more chances of succeeding or knowing if something's going to go wrong.\n\nMap of the Rob Roy Hillclimb course.\n\nThe Rob Roy track commences on a slight incline, proceeds through a sharp right turn, which originally passed a rusty iron shed (whose memory is perpetuated by the name Tin Shed Corner), down a slight incline, to a level stretch along the top of an embankment holding back a half-acre dam, then rears up a one-in-three gradient. The track then winds its way uphill through a series of left turns to the finish line. The start and finish lines are 760 yards (695 metres) apart.\n\nThe following is an extract from The Car, January 15, 1937:\n\n“The site of the hillclimb has finally been completed, and the first event is to be held there on Foundation Day [February 1. 1937]. This is the first hill in Australia, as far as we know, to be specifically made for hillclimbing. It was cut out of virgin bush to the specifications of the LCCA, and it is its objective to make it the Shelsley Walsh of Australia...Everything is there that is required, judges box and telephone box at the finish, as well as a telephone box at the start...The grades of the hill, taken from the start and given for every fifty yards, are as follows: 1 in 18, 1 in 8, 1 in 10, 1 in 8, then level crossing the dam, and followed by 1 in 3.75, 1 in 5.5, 1 in 5.75, 1 in 5.75, 1 in 4.75, 1 in 5.75, and to the top 1 in 15. The approximate distance of the climb is half a mile.”\n\nFilm - 'The Molina MG Special David Bell discusses his ex-Molina MG Special', 2012\n\nDAVID BELL: The car has had a motor-racing history since about 1950, when it was one of the first privately imported MGs into Australia in about 1937. Most recently owned for about the last 30 years by the Molina family, which were friends of my family.\n\nLou Molina came out as an early Italian immigrant and the Molina family were known as the spaghetti mafia. They brought pasta to Melbourne and were very successful. Yeah, and so Dad and Lou were very good friends, and I've seen this car competing in racing over many years and an opportunity came up quite recently to acquire it and I was very lucky enough to sell my soul and purchase it.\n\nIt epitomizes the typical Australian special racing car where, Australians being the resourceful people that they were in the '40s and '50s, basically got what started off as a road car, and reduced the weight by drilling everything and modifying everything, and making light body shells and shortening the wheel-base, and putting as much power in, and then taking on a lot of the continental cars.\n\nThere was so many very successful racing specials and this is, historically, one of those sorts of cars. It's extraordinary-- the performance that it has; and yet it's a car that is extensively a 1937 sort of car, so it's incredible.\n\nFilm - Excerpt from 'The History of the Rob Roy HillClimb', Darren Jones (producer) for Penrite Oil Co., 2005\n\nNARRATOR: At the very first meeting on the 1st of February, 1937, there were many notable drivers of the era, including Les Murphy, who'd won the Australian Grand Prix in 1935, driving his P-type MG.\n\nJack Day was on the racing committee of the RACV at the time, and also, a Light Car Club member. Jack was a real motivator of motorsports, as far back as 1911. He drove his Bugatti with an American V8 engine of that first Rob Roy meeting. Finishing behind Jack Day was Tom Luxton in his Luganda. Tom Luxton actually started the McEwan retail stores throughout Melbourne. And of course, that must've financed his motor racing to a large degree.\n\n-But it was Jack Day who set the fastest time of the day in 1937 at 37.39 seconds. But remember, the road then was unmade.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nMAN: Bill Lowe drove at Rob Roy in that first event, and I've got photographs of him coming up through Tin Shed Corner, and there's great plumes of dust coming from his wheels. It must've been fantastic. Of course, Rob Roy, at the time, was just purely dirt. It wasn't until later that they put pitchmen on the track for the 1938 meeting.\n\nJust prior to the Australian Hillclimb championship in 1938, George Martin, the Light Car Club president at the time, was over in the UK. He was able to entice a couple of internationals to come to the race at that meeting. One of them was Peter Whitehead, who raced at the Bathurst Grand Prix in '38, won there, and then came down here, to Rob Roy to compete.\n\nWith Peter Whitehead and Alan Sinclair coming to the meeting, the crowd was fantastic. Documented crowds of several thousand came to the Hillclimb on that day. Two of Peter Whitehead's main competitors were Jack Day and Tim Joshua.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\n-Unfortunately, for those two drivers, they had accidents on their second run. Peter Whitehead kept improving on each run. And as he came around skyline, you could see the dust just coming off the wheels under full pressure.\n\n-As kids, we'd been very interested in motorsport, because our father was a member of the Light Car Club and had done several trials. And we've got the English magazines. And I'd realized that Peter Whitehead, who I've been reading about, was coming out. And my father said, OK. Well, I'll take you to Rob Roy Hillclimb, where he's competing this weekend. He was pretty casual about everything. Of course, he wouldn't wear a crash helmet, and he managed to make fastest time of the day.\n\nIt was a very impressive sound. I'd never had a noise like it before.\n\n[ENGINE ROARING]\n\nTed Gray, in the Male Special, introduced a new car to Rob Roy. It had smaller wheels. It was a dirt track type of car. And of course, that's what Rob Roy was at the time, a dirt track. And these guys were able to handle that service so much better than the proper cars. In 1939, The Sun ran an ad that said, expect Hillclimb records to be broken. And that's when Frank Kleinig, called Dirt Track Charlie, came down from Sydney.\n\nTo see him on the day, in the Special, which was an MG chassis with this great Hudson motor in it coming around through skyline with the dust flying off his wheels. It must've been fantastic.\n\n-I was a spectator at Rob Roy when Frank Kleinig came down from Sydney in the Hudson special, Kleinig's special. And he had the bonnet off the car, and I just could not believe that a Hudson engine could be so developed. It had four barrel carburetors on it, chromium-plated exhaust pipes going over the top. It had everything that made it go fast-- aluminum head, all heavily finned for cooling. I just could not believe it. And I went back and had a look at my Hudson engine, which looked so sedate, with a single carburetor and a cast iron manifold and an iron head.\n\nI said, I'm going to copy Kleinig, his car."
