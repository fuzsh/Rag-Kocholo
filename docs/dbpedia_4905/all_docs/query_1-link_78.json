        "text": "The British Grand Prix has seen 17 repeat winners since marking the first-ever race in Formula 1, so here are the most successful drivers of all time and also at Silverstone.\n\nAll but 17 editions of the British GP have taken place at Silverstone, with Aintree hosting five and Brands Hatch staging 12. Giuseppe Farina while racing with Alfa Romeo also became the first driver to win a British GP as F1 began its inaugural championship at Silverstone in 1950.\n\nIt was not until Aintree staged its first British GP in 1955 that a Briton won their home round as Stirling Moss succeeded for Mercedes. But home success became the norm in the 1960s with Jim Clark winning five times. Jack Brabham denied Clark six in a row at the 1966 meet.\n\nLewis Hamilton is the most successful F1 driver at the British GP\n\nHome heroes Nigel Mansell with four victories and two-time winners Moss, Jackie Stewart and David Coulthard continued the British success at their home Grand Prix over the years. But no driver has won the British GP more often than Stevenage-born star, Lewis Hamilton.\n\nREAD MORE: Six unforgettable British GP moments from Lewis Hamilton’s dominance to Michael Schumacher’s controversy\n\nHamilton has stood atop his home podium eight times, with wins for McLaren in 2008 plus Mercedes since 2014. The Silver Arrows’ instant dominance in Formula 1’s V6 turbo-hybrid power unit era helped Hamilton to break records galore in F1, including two at Silverstone.\n\nWinning the 2020 British GP saw Hamilton surpass Alain Prost to set the record for the most wins by a Formula 1 driver at their home round. Prost won the French GP six times between 1981 and 1993. Clark’s five British GP wins in the 1960s even see him rank third for the stat.\n\nMORE F1 STORIES\n\nWhile another victory at Silverstone in 2021 saw Hamilton join Michael Schumacher for the most wins at one circuit. The German dominated the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours for Benetton and Ferrari between 1994 and 2006 – including with a four-stop strategy in 2004.\n\nThe British GP has seen 17 repeat winners since the 1950 season\n\nIt did not take long for the British GP to witness a repeat winner with Alberto Ascari taking back-to-back wins for Ferrari at Silverstone in 1952 and 1953. His wins even came amidst a dominant spell for the Scuderia, with Jose Froilan Gonzalez also winning in 1951 and 1954.\n\nREAD MORE: The most successful teams and engine providers at the F1 British GP\n\nAintree, too, only had to hold the British GP twice to witness a repeat winner thanks to the success of Moss. The 16-time Grand Prix winner tasted home glory in 1955 and 1957 for his only wins on home soil. Moss also shared the win in 1957 with his teammate, Tony Brooks.\n\nMoss initially started the 1957 British GP in a different Vanwall chassis than he finished it, as well. The iconic British driver took over Brooks’ car mid-race after his engine had developed a misfire. Going on to win the race also marked the first Formula 1 win for a British-built car.\n\nLike Moss at Aintree, Niki Lauda also took all three of his British GP wins during years Brands Hatch staged the race. While Brabham’s win at Brands Hatch in 1966 to interrupt Clark’s run of dominance added to the Australian’s victories at Aintree in 1959 and Silverstone in 1960.\n\nLewis Hamilton has won the most F1 British Grand Prix at Silverstone\n\nThanks to his dominance with Mercedes post-2014 and having only contested British Grand Prix at Silverstone, no driver has won at the Northamptonshire track more often than home hero Hamilton. The circuit also re-named its international pit straight after him during 2020.\n\nSilverstone sought to recognise Hamilton’s successes after sealing his seventh drivers’ title by naming its main pit straight after the Briton. F1 has started each British GP from what is now the Hamilton Straight beside the Silverstone Wing since the 2011 running of the round."
