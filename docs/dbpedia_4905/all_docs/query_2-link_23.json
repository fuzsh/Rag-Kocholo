Believed to be Masten Gregory's regular car during 1959. According to Doug Nye's Cooper Cars, this was Bruce McLaren's race-winning car at both Sebring Dec 1959 and at Buenos Aires Feb 1960, Subsequent history unknown but may be either the works team's spare car during 1960 (raced by Flockhart and Daigh) and then by Flockhart and Salvadori in New Zealand; the ex-works car sold to Akins for Salvadori to drive in 1960 or the car reputedly sold to Fred Tuck for 1960.\n\nCooper Mk IV 'T51' [\"F2-2-57\" or \"F2-5-57\"] (Bill Patterson): In December 1960, Bill Patterson acquired a full 2.5-litre Cooper T51 in England and had it shipped to Australia. This \"new\" car has been described by Patterson and by later owner Murray Richards in a number of ways, including \"ex-works\", \"ex-Brabham\" and \"ex-Salvadori\". It was said to have been bought from a private team and given the dispersal of the 1959 works T51s, that suggests either Tommy Atkins team or Fred Tuck's. The Salvadori reference would indicate Atkins' team so this car may be the late 1959 works car that was then acquired by Atkins for Salvadori to race in F1 in 1960. Whatever its origins, Patterson debuted the car at Warwick Farm on 29 Jan 1961 and used it to win the 1961 Gold Star. He retained it as a show car after replacing it in 1963 and finally sold it in 1988 to Murray Richards for historic racing. It was sold to Rod Jolley in England in the mid-1990s. It was still owned by Jolley in 2007.\n\nCooper Mk IV 'T51' [F2-9-60] (John Youl): Delivered to J Youl (Australia) according to the Cooper Register.\n\nCooper Mk IV 'T51' [F2-15-59] (Doug Whiteford): Delivered to B Patterson less engine according to the Cooper Register. First raced by Bill Patterson at Port Wakefield in October 1960 where it was fitted with a 2-litre Climax engine. Raced by Patterson until crashed at Lakeside in 1961, after which Patterson raced an \"ex-works\" Cooper T51 that he had acquired earlier in the season. F2-15-59 was repaired and kept as a spare car being raced by Doug Whiteford on occasions. In 1962, the car was sold to Englishman John Brindley who raced it at Calder in April or May 1962. Brindley raced the car in minor events during 1962 until suffering a massive accident in a minor race at Sandown Park on 16 Sep 1962. The Autosportsman report on the race said \"The car must be very nearly a complete write-off\". The wreck sat in the yard behind Car World (Bulleen, Melbourne, Australia) the business in which Brindley was partners with Phil Trueman, for a couple of years. It was then passed on to Bill Patterson, and remained with him, still damaged, until it was acquired by Murray Richards from Patterson in 1988. Richards started to restore the car but this was incomplete when he died in early 2000. The car was still with Richards' sons in 2010.\n\nCooper Mk IV 'T51' [F2-7-60] (Stan Jones): Delivered to Stan Jones (Australia) according to the Cooper Register.\n\nCooper Mk IV 'T51' [F2-22-59] (Ross Dalton): Delivered to A Mildren (Australia) less engine in Oct 1959 according to the Cooper Register.\n\nCooper Mk IV 'T51' ['CTA/59/F1'] (Arnold Glass): Tommy Atkins team built a new Cooper for the 1959 season to be fitted with a Maserati 250S engine. The car was purpose-built by Harry Pearce at the Atkins' team workshops so does not appear in Cooper records. It is given the number 'CTA/59/F1' here to aid identification. Both the Formula 1 Register and John Blanden identify this car as F2-15-58, a F2 T45 used by the Atkins team in 1958, but Doug Nye makes it quite clear the 1959 car was newly built. After a disappointing 1959 season it was sold to Sid Greene of Gilby Engineering for 1960 and raced by son Keith but was uncompetitive and was sold to Arnold Glass for Australian libre racing in August. It was then sold to Dennis Geary in Sep 1961 but he damaged the engine and, still unrepaired, went to John Hough for 1962. He was killed when thrown from the car at Lowood in Sep 1962, only his second race in the car. The damaged car remained with the Hough family thereafter and was still on the family farm in 2016 awaiting restoration.\n\nSources\n\nNote that the identification of individual cars in these results is based on the material presented elsewhere in this site and may in some cases contradict the organisers' published results.\n\nThese results have been compiled by David McKinney from a wide rangle of sources, including his own magazine articles and books. The 1959-1963 results are complete but for the 1957 and 1958 seasons, the only cars currently shown in the results are the F1, Intercontinental and F2 cars that feature elsewhere on this site plus the major Australian specials."
