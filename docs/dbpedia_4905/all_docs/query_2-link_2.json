I even met him on one of his visits to Caversham. But the above reminds me of a review of the '56 \"Olympic\" AGP in a popular Australian magazine of the period; \"Sportscars and Specials\". The editor was Ian Fraser and it was always full of delightful pics. The article showed a pic of Moss giving a voluntary tutorial to some Australian drivers, I think including Reg Hunt. Stirl was telling an apparently appreciative Stan that he was entering a fast sweeper at Albert Park too tightly and was consequently wasting time \"wheel-sawing\" his way out of it. Obviously a valued lesson.\n\nMust have been somthing in the water of the Jones boys going on how they both drove at there various top years.\n\nFunnily enough, the trophy doesn't show in either of the photos I have of Stan after the race...\n\nThere's the one of Alan and the crew around the car and another one of them on the grid with plenty of onlookers.\n\nI went to the auction at the Delage Garage last Saturday on behalf of the VHRR, but was out of the bidding when it reached $4500 ,being sold to an unknow buyer who also had the winning bid on a group of 7 trophies which included a silver tray won by Stan.\n\nRegards Ron.\n\nwhat another $100 0dd dollars and you let it go?\n\nI went to the auction at the Delage Garage last Saturday on behalf of the VHRR, but was out of the bidding when it reached $4500 ,being sold to an unknow buyer who also had the winning bid on a group of 7 trophies which included a silver tray won by Stan.\n\nRegards Ron.\n\nI don't know who the winner of the trophies is ( I wasn't there to avoid any temptation), but if I was to guess it would an old friend of Stan's who runs a shop in Kew. I know his name, but won't out him here. He worked with my late father at Peter Robinson Motors - the Lilydale Holden dealer in the 1960s.\n\nStephen\n\nin my area."
