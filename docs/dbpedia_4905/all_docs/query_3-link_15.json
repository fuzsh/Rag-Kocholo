        "text": "Given that it never occurred to me do so, I sat down a few days ago and began to sort through the Sanction Reports of the AAA Contest Board for the 1946 Big Car season.\n\nWhat I discovered was that there were 17 events held to the International Formula (National Championship formula) in 1946, of which one, the Mike Benton Sweepstakes held at Lakewood on 31 March, did not count towards the championship. This means that there were 16 events held using the formula. All were held on the one mile tracks. Below is what I have adopted from the entry blanks for those events, excepting the IMS, as to how they stipulated which cars were eligible for these events:\n\nThis event open to cars conforming to the International Formula adopted by the Contest Board; engines with a maximum piston displacement of 183 cubic inches, supercharged, or 274 cubic inches, unsupercharged, and meeting the minimum weight requirements if having a piston displacement of over 210 cubic inches, unsupercharged.\n\nIt is a rather clever way of conducting business....\n\nI have managed to establish that there were 61 events held using the Big Car/Sprint Car \"formula\" which mandated the use of unsupercharged engines of not more than 210 cubic inches piston displacement.\n\nThis might shed a bit more light on a season that still seems to be something of Black Hole for most, especially those at INDYCAR...\n\nI think that I have now pretty much established which Eastern and Midwestern events counted towards the national championship and sorted out the dates for these events. The big headache is plowing through the material and then trying to sort it out so that there is a record of sorts for the season. At some point, I will happily pass this on to the Real Experts who can correct my slaughtering of various names and my other errors.\n\nSo where does this leave the previous research that there were 77 events? As I understood it, this figure was confirmed by AAA leaving the numbers 2 and 73 blank in the 1947 driver list, to commemorate Robson and Barringer.\n\nWould Robson's points from 16 races place him second rather than third, just as in the table using the six races of 100 miles and more?\n\nActually, Robson WAS second in the championship and not third in the final, actual 1946 championship standings before the revisionist altering of the record, thanks in large part to the Memorial Day event at the Speedway.\n\nIf you add 16 + 61 = 77.\n\nThe rationale for including the Eastern (and some Midwestern) Big Car/Sprint Car events was the distinct possibility of there being shortage of cars and materials (such as tires, for one) for the 1946 season, a not unreasonable concern in the wake of the war.\n\nI went through all the available folders in the sanction file for the Big Cars/Sprint Cars for the 1946 season and checked the files for which \"formula\" each event was open to participating in the event. It occurred me after once again looking at the six event championship that Darren has in his collection of races for that years that it seemed that the one mile tracks might be open to both Championship and Sprint Cars, which turns out to have been the case.\n\nSo, I think that it is safe to say that of the 17 events open to Championship cars during 1946, 16 of them were in the championship, of which one was the 500-mile race, five were 100-mile events, and rest were features of less than 100 miles.\n\n* Atlanta, 31 March (non-championship)\n\n1) Trenton, 5 May\n\n2) Trenton, 30 May\n\n3) Indianapolis, 30 May\n\n4) Atlanta, 2 June\n\n5) Langhorne, 30 June\n\n6) Atlanta, 4 July\n\n7) Atlanta, 7 July\n\n8) Langhorne, 21 July\n\n9) Langhorne, 11 August\n\n10) Atlanta, 2 September\n\n11) Indianapolis, 15 September\n\n12) Milwaukee, 22 September\n\n13) Atlanta, 28 September\n\n14) Trenton, 29 September\n\n15) Atlanta, 5 October\n\n16) Goshen, 6 October\n\nI am too lazy at the moment to list the 61 Sprint Car events for 1946, but I did discover that Buzz Rose and Phil Harms and others (me!) did have some of the dates wrong for the Sprint Car events that actually took place or did not realize that there were rain dates and cancellations that were included as well as some race meetings that were left off.\n\nIt is not for the faint of heart to sort through all the folders, begin to make sense of it all, and then attempt to begin to place in some sort of form that could be used by others.\n\nI think that INDYCAR and others need to take heed and correct the error of their ways...\n\nWhat is definitely the case is that the event on 31 March at the Lakewood Speedway was open over to cars with engines of over 210 cubic inches of piston displacement.\n\nThat this might have been a Free For All event is certainly possible, but that is not stated on the entry blanks, where such information would be noted.\n\nThe entry blanks state that as an invitational event, therefore, no championship points would be awarded.\n\nThat the 210-cubic inch Sprint Cars were allowed to run in the events on the mile tracks and not required to meet the displacement/weight requirements of the International Formula was an interesting way to have it both ways.\n\nThe minimum weight for a 210 Sprint Car would have been about 1,579 pounds under the formula.\n\nFrom what I have found in the sanction report for the 5 May Trenton race, none of the cars entered were under the International Formula, all of them being Sprint Cars with engines 210 and under.\n\nI was actually very surprised when after applying Ockham's Razor to all the various dates for race meetings that the number came out to be 77(!).\n\nWhat all this merely suggests that there is much more work to be done as in actual research on the topic rather than simply blindly accepting the usual folklore and hearsay, while kowtowing to the revisionist alterations.\n\nMinimum wheelbase: 99.0 inches. Minimum weight: May include oil in the transmission and differential, as well as the tires; does not include water in the radiator, oil or fuel for the engine, tools or spare tire; net weight must lie within 35 pounds of the requisite minimum weight for piston displacement; maximum allowable ballast is 35 pounds and must be securely fastened in place. Minimum exterior width: 33.46 inches or 85.0 centimeters. Minimum height: 9.84 inches or 25.0 centimeters. Transmission must incorporate a reverse gear. No oil replenishment allowed during the race. Cars must be started with self-starter or hand crank; push starts are not allowed. Firewall between engine compartment and driver’s cockpit must be a minimum of 3/16th of an inch thick.

Whether or not the Contest Board later decided to refuse to acknowledge those events, recognizing only the six events held to the criteria of 100 miles or more on a one mile track using the championship car technical specifications (the International Formula which was put into place in 1938), the events certainly did take place. Not being a \"purist,\" I have no problem with the winners of the main events being included as championship event winners.\n\nWith only a few exceptions, the schedule of events and the results of these race meetings are now known. The time trials, heats, consolation and semi-final events, feature events, and payout sheets of these race meetings make for interesting reading. They also give a better idea of how the infrastructure of racing under the Contest Board actually worked.\n\nAs for Selingsgrove, I think that there was only one event, not two. As the report states, the program was shortened by the weather and that was that. The slim field, only nine entries being reflected in the time trials results, suggest that even without the weather issue, it would have been a rather thin program anyway. Note the sanction number, 4051, and it is clear that it was added to the listing quite late. The report also suggests just what a fumble the event was, with the track scarcely managing to open for the event and a very small field to boot. This is where the stories, if you will, of the events often leave more questions than answers. Focusing solely on the statistics and data, what constitutes the generally accepted definition of \"auto racing history,\" often tends to largely ignore or simply leave open the context and specifics of individual events. Interestingly, there is not all that much in either NSSN or ISN on many of these events held during 1946. Then again, in some cases just finding out the bare bones of a race meeting can be a serious challenge, much less digging into its specifics. For the most part, whether buff or scholastic historian, folks do their flat level best to bring this material to our attention.\n\nA tip of the hat to Michael for his excellent work sorting all this sort of stuff out.\n\nPlus, I have the suspicion that some items are missing from what Gordon White tired to get microfilmed.\n\nThat, sadly, proves to be the case. There are no results or payoff sheets for Thompson June 9, for example, so that one remains elusive. The only hope is to be able to reconstruct the results from the points standings.\n\nAlso, there are no results for Winchester May 26, and the payoff sheet is rather \"erratic\": several payoff positions are missing, and some of those listed do not agree with the entry blank info nor the info from newspaper reports. Shackleford is listed with a qualifying time, but crossed out, and does not appear to have received any money, whereas all newspaper reports list him as winning a heat and running strongly in the feature. Maybe he was disqualified? Yet, there's no hint in the official report from the race, which meticulously lists all fees collected from the drivers, car owners, mechanics and the promoter, rates the \"policing\" of the race as \"OK\" and reports the \"accidents\" as \"none\", without further remarks. In short, a headache.\n\nNormally, I accept the payoff info as final, as the entrants sign off with their name against their winnings, thus accepting the finishing order (which settles the odd disagreement between results and payoff info), but this can be tricky, too - case in point is the final race, Richmond Nov 10: both Johns and Goss are paid for 5th place in the main event, and there's no payoff for 6th, while the total sum of prize money paid is 25 dollars off (the exact amount of the difference between 5th and 6th). One can only guess what happened: the race was stopped prematurely due to an accident, and the last two laps were run under yellow. The local paper reported Johns finishing 4th, with no info on the following positions. Examining the payoff ledger now, one can see that the main event amounts for Stine (4th), Johns (5th) and Fleming (7th) were corrected, whereas the entry for Goss (6th) wasn't altered. My guess is that Stine dropped to seventh during the yellow laps, and (informally) protested at the payoff window, leading to the corrections. Apparently, Goss had already been paid for 5th, and since there were only four cars running in the consy (which paid to 7th position), the promoter was 35 dollars to the good, and probably decided that it wasn't worth the hassle to recover those 25 dollars - stranger things have happened!"
