        "text": "Former world champion Alan Jones has admitted he's losing interest in Formula 1, saying the sport is full of \"prima donnas\" and \"ridiculous\" regulations.\n\nJones – who remains Australia's last world champion having done so in 1980 driving for Williams – said he still attends two or three grand prix events a year, but is losing interest in the sport he once conquered and is instead turning his focus to two wheels.\n\n\"I have a lot of interest now in MotoGP,\" he told Wide World of Sports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE: Origin great's massive prediction for Cowboys star\n\nREAD MORE: Lounge room video game to unearth future Olympic champs\n\nREAD MORE: Bizarre test SVG must pass before NASCAR debut\n\n\"I love it, it's competitive, you don't know who's going to win the bloody race until the last lap.\n\n\"It's colourful, it's very professional … I've lost a lot of interest in Formula 1 – they're all bloody prima donnas.\"\n\nHe pointed to Max Verstappen's nearly $2 million license fee for 2024 as the latest example of regulations gone mad.\n\nDrivers require a special racing licence, called a Superlicence, from the sport's governing body the FIA in order to compete in F1. But instead of just being a flat fee for all, each driver's entry fee is calculated on a base fee-plus-points-scored method.\n\nDue to how many points the Dutchman accrued in his record-breaking 2023 campaign – a record 575 – his racing licence for the 2024 season will cost an eye-watering $1,979,702.\n\n\"$2 million for Max's licence? It's getting ridiculous,\" Jones said.\n\nJones competed in the sport between 1975 and 1986. He said he also required a Superlicence, but it came from the British Royal Automobile Club (RAC) and came at no cost.\n\n\"It just simply meant that you could drive a Formula 1 car – they didn't charge for it,\" he said.\n\n\"You just went into the RAC in England, filled in your form and as long as you met the requirements, you got a licence to race a Formula 1 car.\n\n\"That was it – I can't see why you have to pay $2 million for a licence. What service do they give you back for that?\n\n\"It's not like they give you some sort of special treatment or service or whatever.\n\n\"It's just a piece of paper to say that you're qualified to drive a Formula 1 car.\n\n\"It's all a bit silly.\"\n\nThankfully for Verstappen, the fee is generally not paid by the driver, but rather by the team."
