Sebring in December

The 1959 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One race held on December 12, 1959, at Sebring International Raceway in Sebring, Florida. It was the second United States Grand Prix, and the only occasion the race was held at the home of the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance sports car race.

What a banking!

Dan Gurney finished 2nd in his Ferrari, in his second ever Grand Prix, at the 1959 German Grand Prix held at the AVUS. This photo-above shows, without any photographic trick, how steep the banking really was, as it was constructed at a 44 degrees angle. The 1959 German Grand Prix was a Formula One race […]

Colours of Tasmania

Jean Behra, shooting star

Let’s recall French motor racing shooting star Jean Behra (1921-1959) who took part in 52 F1 world championship events in the 1950s with the Gordini, Maserati, BRM, Ferrari and Porsche teams, and who sadly died on August 1, 1959 in Berlin. He’s pictured above at the 1957 non-championship Morocco Grand Prix, flanked by Rob Walker on […]

Pushing too hard

Brooks dominated the race, and despite a sticking throttle, crossed the finishing line 27 seconds ahead of his team mate Phil Hill. Stirling Moss was disqualified from eighth position after receiving a push-start (picture above), in […]

A Maserati in the twilight
