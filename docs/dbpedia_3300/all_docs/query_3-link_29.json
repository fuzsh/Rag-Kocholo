My professors genuinely care about my well-being and teach me all of the things I need to succeed. There are staff and students openly ready to help with applications, study material and even prep courses. The Pre-Law Society has been particularly helpful in providing the information I need to take those next steps. Most importantly, my college experience is strengthening my faith and allows me to place my future in the hands of the Lord.\"\n\nMadison Cresswell\n\n2021 political science and communications & media/multimedia journalism graduate from North Little Rock, Ark."
