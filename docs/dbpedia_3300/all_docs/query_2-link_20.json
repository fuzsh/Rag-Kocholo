Mikulski to be their U.S. Senator because she's a fighter--looking out for the day-to-day needs of Marylanders and the long range needs of the Nation. Determined to make a difference in her community, Barbara Mikulski became a social worker in Baltimore, helping at-risk children and educating seniors about the Medicare Program. Social work evolved into community activism when Barbara Mikulski successfully organized communities against a plan to build a 16-lane highway through Baltimore's Fells Point neighborhood. She helped stop the road, saving Fells Point and Baltimore's Inner Harbor, both thriving residential and commercial communities today. Senator Mikulski was a trailblazer. Her first election was a successful run for Baltimore City Council in 1971, where she served for 5 years. In 1976, she ran for Congress and won, representing Maryland's Third District for 10 years. In 1986, she ran for Senate and won, becoming the first Democratic woman Senator elected in her own right. She was reelected with large majorities in 1992, 1998, 2004, and 2010. Barbara Mikulski focused on the issues of civil rights, national security, space exploration, education, jobs, research and innovation, women's health, cybersecurity, seniors, and veterans. She was primary sponsor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, addressing salary discrimination against women; it was the first bill signed into law in 2009 by President Obama, just days after his first inauguration. A leader in the Senate, Barbara Mikulski was the dean of the women--serving as a mentor to other women Senators when they first take office. As the dean, she built coalitions--proving that the Senate women are not solo acts, but work together to get things done. When she was sworn into office on January 5, 2011, Barbara Mikulski became the longest serving woman Senator in U.S. history. On March 17, 2012, she became the longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. Congress. Of these milestones, she said, ``It's not about how long I serve, but about how well I serve my State and my Nation.'' On December 20, 2012, Senator Mikulski became the first woman and first Marylander to chair the Senate Appropriations Committee, on which she served since she arrived in the Senate in 1987. Senator Mikulski was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2011. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2015. Senator Mikulski's experiences as a social worker and activist provided valuable lessons that she drew on as a U.S. Senator. She believed her constituents have a right to know, a right to be heard, and a right to be represented. She listened to her constituents and made the personal, political. Senator Mikulski retired from the U.S. Senate on January 3, 2017. She accepted a position as Homewood professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and she participates in national speaking engagements on the topics of leadership, innovation, and women's empowerment. Farewell to the Senate Wednesday, December 7, 2016 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to take the floor for what I call my summing-up speech. It is not my farewell speech because I have the honor and privilege of being the ranking member and former chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I will speak later on this week when we move the continuing resolution. It is the practice and the tradition of the Senate that when a Senator is departing the Senate, they give what they call their farewell address. Well, mine is not going to be as memorable as when George Washington resigned his commission or other memorable speeches, but I do want to say words about how I feel today about having the great opportunity to serve in the Congress. I have spent 30 years in the Senate, 10 years in the House of Representatives, and, yes, 5 years in the Baltimore City Council. I have served in elected public office for 45 years. More than half of my life has been in elected public service but, at the same time, all of my life has been focused on service. I rise today to thank the people of Maryland. I rise to thank them for their vote of confidence. When people vote for you, it is not only that they are sending you to Washington or sending you to city hall. They are giving you a vote of confidence that you will be their voice, that you will be their vote, that you will be at their side and on their side, and that is what I want to be able to talk about today. The people of Baltimore gave me my first shot at running for the Baltimore City Council. When I beat the political bosses, when running for political office as a woman was considered a novelty, they said: ``You don't look the part.'' But I said, ``This is what the part looks like, and this is what the part is going to be like.'' Along the way, so many people helped me. Behind ``me'' is a whole lot of ``we.'' I got started in public life because of volunteers and activists who, on their own time and on their own dime, volunteered themselves to not only help me get elected but to be involved in their communities, to be civically engaged, to make their community and their country a better place. These are the people who were behind me. Well, guess what. No, I was behind them, because they certainly have led the way. Along the way, there were people who also not only helped me get elected, but they helped me govern--people who, again, volunteered their own time. I had a wonderful service academy board that helped me pick the best and the brightest to serve in our military academies--people with distinguished careers in either the military or in education. I had a judicial appointment advisory board that made sure I helped nominate the best people to serve in the Federal judiciary. Also, I had a veterans advisory group that brought to me what was really happening to the veterans, not what was in the press releases from the Veterans Administration. Of course, I had a fabulous strategy group that functioned as a kitchen cabinet. It was a kitchen cabinet. We spent a lot of time cooking things up to try to make our country and our communities better places. So I thank them all for what they did. When we come here to try to serve the people who sent us here, we cannot do it alone. So we have a fabulous staff, both that serves us in Washington and serves us in our State. I wish to thank my current staff: my chief of staff, Shannon Kula; my deputy chief of staff, Rachel MacKnight; my State director, Nichelle Schoultz; my legislative director, Brigid Houton; my communications director, Matt Jorgenson; my scheduling director, Catie Finley; my office manager, Josh Yearsley; my appropriations staff director, Chuck Kieffer; and my appropriations deputy staff director, Jean Toal Eisen; and of course, all of my staff in my State office who helped me. There is also the support staff who made sure that the phones got answered. You didn't get one of those ``call 1, call 2, press 7, press 184,'' and so forth. Also, there are the people who answer the mail, whether it was snail mail, which so much of it was when I came, or email, because we really believed that we needed to be here for the people. I called their names, but there are also others who filled those jobs throughout my time in public office. They worked very hard to make sure that we could represent the people of Maryland and to be on their side. After 45 years, though, it is time for me to say goodbye to elected office, but not to service. I have the high privilege of being the longest serving woman in congressional history. But I say it is not how long you serve but how well you serve. For those who know me and have been to rallies and so on, they know that I say: ``I am here to work on the macro issues and I am here to work on the macaroni and cheese issues''--to work on the big picture, to make sure that the people's day-to-day needs were converted into public policy or, while we are working on public policy, to try to help our communities. We also have to remember in our own States that we have constituent service issues. One of the things I am really proud of is my constituent service staff, where if you were a veteran and you needed help or you had a Social Security or Medicare problem, you could call Senator Barb and you didn't feel that you had to go to a $100 fundraiser or know somebody who had connections. The only connection you needed was a phone. You didn't even need Wi-Fi. You could just call me. Summer, winter, spring, or fall, they had Senator Barb. I tried to be of service because service was in my DNA. I was raised to think about service. My mother and father ran a small neighborhood grocery store in one of Baltimore's famous rowhouse neighborhoods. Every day they would get up, and they would open that grocery store and say to their customers: ``Good morning. Can I help you?'' Now, in running that business, they also wanted to be sure that they were connected to the community. We weren't a big-box shop. We were a shop for the little people. If anybody was in difficulty, my father was happy to extend credit. It was called: We will write your name down in a book. Pay us when you can. Don't worry that you got laid off at Bethlehem Steel. We know that your wife had a difficult childbirth and needs this extra stuff. We are here to help. My father would say: ``Barbara, deliver those groceries. Take it down in that little red wagon I got for you.'' With my little red wagon, I would maybe take orange juice down to a shut-in, but my father would say: ``Don't take a tip.'' The tip he gave me was to always be of service and to treat people fair and square. The other place where I learned so much about service was from the nuns who taught me. I had the great fortune to go to Catholic schools. I was taught by the Sisters of Notre Dame and the Sisters of Mercy. These wonderful women, who led the consecrated life, taught us not only about reading, writing, and arithmetic, but they taught us religion and emphasized the Beatitudes. If anybody reads the Scripture, if you go to Matthew 5 and you go to the Beatitudes, you know what has shaped us. One of them is this: Blessed are those who are meek at heart. I had to really work at that one--really, really work at that one. At the same time, there were those that said: Those who hunger and thirst after justice. That is what motivated me. It was focusing on the values of faith, like love your neighbor, care for the sick, and worry about the poor. I was also inspired by a motto from something called the Christopher Movement, where you would help carry the burden. It said: ``It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.'' That is what was motivating me to service. We really believed in America in my family, and we really believed in it in my community. When my great- grandmother came to this country from Poland in 1886, she had little money in her pocket, but she had big dreams in her heart. Women didn't even have the right to vote. One hundred years to the year that she landed in this country, I landed in the Senate. That is what opportunity means in the United States of America. I never thought I would come into politics. Growing up in Baltimore, my family wasn't involved in politics. My family was involved more in church work, philanthropy, doing good works in the way they did their business. In Baltimore in those days, there were political bosses--guys with pot bellies who smoked cigars and did deals, and so forth--and that wasn't going to be me. I thought I would go into the field of social work. I got involved because they wanted to put a 16-lane highway through the European ethnic neighborhoods of Baltimore and not even give the people relocation benefits, and they were going to smash and bulldoze the first African-American home-ownership neighborhood in Baltimore, in a community called Rosemont. I said, ``Look, we can fight this. We just have to give ourselves a militant name.'' I helped put together a group called SCAR, or the Southeast Council Against the Road. Our African-American neighbors were on the other side of town, and they had a group called RAM, or Relocation Action Movement. Then the citywide coalition had a group called MAD, or Movement Against Destruction. So you see, I have always had a certain flair about these things. So we did take on city hall. But the more I knocked on doors--and our community did--we weren't heard. So I decided the heck with it. If I knocked on a door and I wasn't going to be heard, I was going to knock on the door to get elected, and that is what I did--knocking on doors, putting together a coalition, defying the odds, defying what people said--You can't win. No woman can win in an ethnic, hard-hat neighborhood. No woman can win who isn't part of the political machine. No woman could win who had been active in the civil rights movement. I said, ``Guess what.'' We defied the odds, and we denied the odds, and that is how I came into public office--a champion on behalf of the people. I wanted to come to be an advocate for people to have better lives, to have better livelihoods and better neighborhoods, to be able to save jobs and to do what I could to be able to help them. I knew that to do that I had to show up, stand up, and speak up for my constituents, staying close enough to the people so they wouldn't fall between the cracks and meeting their day-to- day needs and the long-range needs of the Nation. When I came to the Senate, I was the very first woman elected in her own right. Though I was all by myself, I was never alone. When I came, there was only one other woman here--the wonderful and distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, a wonderful colleague. When I say I was by myself as the only woman in the Democratic caucus, I say I was never alone because of the great men that we could work with in the Senate. Now, I have had the privilege to work with two of the best men in America. Senator Paul Sarbanes, who was my senior Senator when I came and who certainly was my champion, helped me to get on the right committees and convinced everybody that my name was Barb Mikulski and not Bella Abzug. But I was a little bit of both. As to Senator Sarbanes and now, of course, Senator Ben Cardin, who also has been at my side, we have worked together on issues related to Maryland both large and small. But there were others who taught me, like Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy, and others. What it was all about was being able to work for jobs and for justice. Though I was the first Democratic woman, I wanted to be the first of many. I wanted to help women get elected to the Senate and do what I could to be able to help them to do that. It has been just wonderful to see that now there are 20 women who are currently serving in the Senate. One of the great joys has been to work to help empower them so that they can be a powerhouse. That is why we have those power workshops that struck fear into the hearts of the guys--not to worry about us but to keep an eye on us. I have been proud of what I have learned, taking the values that I had growing up and trying to put them in the Federal lawbooks, because, for me, no issue was too small to take up, and no cause was too big for me to not take on. I firmly believe that the best ideas come from the people. That is where some of my greatest accomplishments came from. One of the things I loved the most was being in Maryland, moving around the State, going to all of the counties in the State. I loved my Mondays in Maryland, where I could meet and go into unannounced places like diners. A lot of people like to do townhalls, and they are terrific, but I like to show up at a diner, go from table to table and not only eyeball the french fries but listen to what the people have to say. The other thing that I really liked was roundtables-- absolutely those roundtables--where you could engage in conversation with people and listen to them, not show off how smart or cool you were. I really loved doing that. Out of it came some of my first big accomplishments. When I came to the U.S. Senate, my father was quite ill with Alzheimer's. My father was a wonderful man. He worked hard for my sisters and me so that we would have an education. He saw his role as a protector and provider, and by providing us an education, we could always take care of ourselves. When he became so ill and went into a nursing home, I listened to other families who would come to visit people in long-term care. We saw that the very cruel rules of our own government were forcing people to spend down their entire life savings and put in their family home or their family farm as an asset base. Well, listening to them, Barbara Mikulski said this: ``Family responsibility--yes, you need to take responsibility for your family, but the cruel rules of government should never push a family into family bankruptcy.'' So I crafted something called the spousal anti-impoverishment rules that enable elderly couples to keep their assets and keep their home. AARP tells me that since that legislation passed over 20 years ago, we have helped 1 million seniors not lose their homes or their family farms because one becomes too ill because of that dreaded A-word or Parkinson's or others. That is what I mean about the best ideas coming from the people. Then I also listened to women who worked hard every single day yet weren't getting equal pay for equal work. Of course we heard it from Lilly Ledbetter, but we heard it from lots of Lillies, and we heard it from lots of Roses and lots of Marys and lots of Otanias and lots of Marias. That is why we worked hard to pass the Equal Pay For Equal Work Act. Working together with Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Olympia Snowe, our friends over in the House, Connie Morella, Pat Schroeder, we also found that women were being excluded from the protocols of NIH. The famous study to take an aspirin and keep a heart attack away was done on 10,000 male medical students, not 1 woman. So Olympia, Connie, Pat, and Barb showed up at NIH and pounded the table and said, ``Let's start practicing good science instead of bad stereotypes and make sure we are included where we should be in a legitimate, scientific way.'' Out of that came the appointment of Bernadine Healy as the head of NIH; out of that came the Office of Research on Women's Health at NIH; and out of that came the famous hormone replacement study that Dr. Healy championed. Then Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter helped us get money in the Federal checkbook. One study changed medical practice and lowered breast cancer rates in this country by 15 percent. Wow. That is what working together does--to try to save lives a million at a time. That was on women's health. Then we saw growing concerns about the issue of the high cost of college. The first mortgage many of our kids are facing is their student loans. Working together with the other side of the aisle, we created AmeriCorps, making sure we enabled people to be able to be of service to our country and earn a voucher to pay down their student loans. Then there was a roundtable where I met with parents of special needs children, and a mother asked me to change the law from ``retardation'' to ``intellectual disability'' because she was being bullied. Well, I came back here and drafted legislation. Again, on the other side of the aisle was Mike Enzi, who worked with me to pass that. Rosa now is a member of the Special Olympics. She wins medals. She was Person of the Week on television. That is what Mondays in Maryland means. It is worth everything to do things like that. In Maryland, we worked along with Senators Sarbanes and Hardin to clean up the bay. We worked to make sure our port was viable. We worked not only on our Port of Baltimore for ships of commerce, but also we worked on the space community at Goddard. I am so proud of the fact that I worked very hard to save the Hubble Space Telescope. That Hubble Space Telescope turned out to be the richest contact lens in world history. But again, with astronaut Senators Jake Garn and John Glenn working together, we did it, and it ensured America's premier leadership in astronomy and in space for years and for several decades. Over the years, though, I could go through accomplishment after accomplishment, but one of the things I have learned as my lesson in life is that the best ship you could sail on in life is something called friendship. It is friendship that makes life worth living. It enables life to have the value of giving. That is what friendship is. When I think about the friends along the way whom I have met both in my hometown and my State, there are also those who are here, people who on both sides of the aisle are absolutely so important to me--and the fact that we have worked on both sides of the aisle. I spoke about Senator Cardin and Senator Sarbanes. On the Senate Appropriations Committee, it was Senator Shelby and Senator Kit Bond; we could actually work together. We put our heads together to try to come up with real solutions for real problems, and we could do that. The other is not to judge one another because we have a party label. I am so darned sick of that. In the year of the women, so many came--like Barbara Boxer and Patty Murray and Dianne Feinstein, also Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who came from Texas. I got a call from Senator Hutchison one day, and my staff said: ``Ew, she wants to work with you on something. Ew, ew. She is a conservative from Texas and she wants to do something for women.'' I said, ``How about if we listen? Could we start with listening? Could we start with just listening?'' Senator Hutchison had a fabulous idea on IRA contributions. In those days, if you were in the marketplace, you could put in $2,000, but if you worked full time at home, you could put in only $500. What Senator Hutchison wanted to do was to make it have parity--that old word, ``parity.'' I said yes. Our staffs told us not to work with each other, but we were going to forge ahead. We went out to dinner to talk over strategy, but we talked together about our lives, how she got her start, obstacles she faced. We had such a good time that we said: ``Let's invite other women.'' Well, that became the famous dinners--the famous dinners that the women of the Senate have. We knew we would never be a caucus because we were not uniform in our views or the way we voted, but what we wanted to be was, No. 1, a zone of civility where we would treat each other with respect, our debates would be observed with intellectual rigor, and when the day was over, the day would be over. Those dinners have now stood the test of time, and I am so proud of them. I have been so proud to work with my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, who has been such a friend and such an ally. Though we are not a caucus, we are a force when we can come together. We have made change, and we have made a difference. That doesn't go down in the rollbooks, but I think it certainly should go down in the history books. So as I get ready to leave the Senate, what will I miss? Well, I will never have another job as consequential as this. This is pretty consequential. The fate of this country, and maybe even the world, lies in the hands of the Congress of the United States. I will miss the people in the Senate, the wonderful professional staff, but I am also going to miss the doorkeepers, the elevator operators, the cafeteria workers, the police officers who say: ``In helping the one, we help the many.'' We learn so much from them; I have learned so much from them. I learned a lot from the elevator operators. One was a lady of very modest means who every day would say to me and to all of us, ``Have a blessed day.'' What a great gift she gave us: ``Have a blessed day.'' Another elevator operator, who himself has recovered from very challenging health issues, always cheerful, asks, ``How is your day?'' The last thing you could do is to not return a smile. Those are the kinds of people whom I will always remember, all those helping hands. So I say to my colleagues now that I will never, ever forget you. Helen Keller, though she was blind, was a great visionary, and she said that all that you deeply love you never lose. All whom I have ever met have become a part of me; each and every one of you have become a part of me. Everybody I met along the way, whether it was at roundtables or the elevator operators, have become a part of me. You shaped me, and you have helped me become a better person. So when I wrap up and people say ``Well, what do you think you are going to do, Barb,'' I will say my plan is not a job description but a life description. Every day I am going to learn something new. Every day I am going to give something back. Every day I am going to do something where I keep an old friend or make a new one. I want to thank God that I live in the United States of America, which enabled me to do this. In conclusion, George Bernard Shaw--I don't know how he would have felt about me, but he wrote this, and I think it is pretty good. He said this: I am [of the opinion] that my life belongs to the [whole] community, and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. For the harder I work, the more I live. I will rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no ``brief candle'' to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations. God bless the U.S. Senate, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause, Senators rising.) ? TRIBUTES TO BARBARA A. MIKULSKI Proceedings in the Senate Thursday, December 1, 2016 Mr. REID. Mr. President, at times it seems that Democrats and Republicans in the Senate don't agree on very much, but the one thing we all agree on without any exception is this: Our colleague Barbara Mikulski of Maryland can turn a phrase better than anyone else. It is one of her many gifts. Just listen to some of the memorable lines we have heard her utter. Running for her first term in the Senate, Barbara said, ``I might be short, but I won't be overlooked.'' Just prior to the 2013 government shutdown, she told Senate Republicans, ``You can huff and puff for 21 hours, but you can't be the magic dragon that blows the Affordable Care Act away.'' Earlier this year, she spoke of the Zika virus as follows: The mosquitoes are coming. The mosquitoes are already here. You can't build a fence to keep them out, and the mosquitoes won't pay for it. The mosquitoes are here--this is not an Obama fantasy. My personal favorite was something she said at a welcome reception for the 1986 class. We gathered in the Russell Building, and it was a festive occasion for Democrats. We had many new Democrats. It was a huge class--Daschle, Shelby, Breaux, Graham, Conrad, and Fowler. There were many Democratic Senators, but the day was stolen by Barbara Mikulski. We were all asked to say a word. About her opponent, she stood and said: ``I may be short, but it sure wasn't hard for me to slam dunk Linda Chavez.'' It is safe to say that with that quip, Barbara immediately hit it off with all the Members of the Senate class. From the moment she first set foot in the Senate, Senator Mikulski was determined to be herself--honest, disciplined, principled, undaunted, with an incredible wit and a fierce love of Maryland. You will not find a Member of this body more devoted to her circumstances--and we will talk about those in a little bit--devoted to her constituents and her State than Senator Barbara Mikulski. She served the State of Maryland for more than 50 years. A graduate of Mount Saint Agnes College and the University of Maryland, she made her name as a social worker and a political activist. Her grandparents are well known, especially her grandmother. They ran a bakery. I have heard her talk about that bakery so many times, how the people in the neighborhood would come and wait for that bakery to open. Her grandparents went there very early, as bakers do. She speaks with nostalgia, warmth, and love of her grandparents. Her own parents ran a little grocery store next to a steel mill. They would get there early in the morning, and the steelworkers would come and get their lunches and sometimes their breakfasts in that grocery store. Her parents were part of her life, as were her grandparents. She is so proud of them. In 1966 the Baltimore City Council proposed building a large highway through the center of the city of Baltimore. There was a downside to the plan: It would have razed entire neighborhoods, African-American neighborhoods and especially immigrant neighborhoods. They would have to leave their homes. The city's leaders, political bosses, and, of course, the wealthy real estate interests and many others--the power brokers of the State of Maryland, the city of Baltimore--knew this was a done deal, but the power brokers didn't count on a young social worker named Barbara Mikulski to fight for these families. It was her first political activism, and activism it was. It was her alone. Because of her magnetism, her warmth, and her ability to organize, she organized an effort to stop the highway. Everyone said it couldn't be done, but no one bothered to tell Barbara. She rallied the citizens of Baltimore in opposing the highway, and what a rally it was--not one rally, not two, but many of them until it was determined that she had won and the power brokers had lost. These people got to keep their homes, and today there is no superhighway towering over the center of Baltimore. People remember Barbara Mikulski for that. Barbara's fight against the highway made her a hero in Baltimore and propelled her to the city council in 1971. In 1976 Barbara Mikulski fought her way to the Congress of the United States as a Member of the House of Representatives. After five terms in the House, Barbara Mikulski ran for a seat in the Senate, in the one I just told you about. She slam-dunked her opponent, making her the first Democratic woman in history to win seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States. Today Senator Mikulski is the longest serving woman to serve in the U.S. Congress. For more than 40 years she has served the people of Maryland. She is the first woman and first Marylander to chair the prestigious Senate Appropriations Committee. Her legislative record reflects her hard work for women and for equality. She worked with then-Senator Joe Biden to pass the first Violence Against Women Act in 1994. She was the architect of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. She was repeatedly in the forefront to fight for paycheck fairness, which determined that men and women who do the same work should be paid the same money. When so many of us were duped by misinformation about the Iraq war, Barbara Mikulski was not duped. She voted against the war. Barbara's career in the Senate has been historic, but I would be remiss if I failed to note her impact on my life and my career. As I said, we came to the Senate together. We served together. We got the same committees. We, of course, served together in the House, but that is a huge body--435 Members. Frankly, I served there two terms. I know the Presiding Officer [Mr. Rounds] served in the House. It is a huge body. When I left there after 4 years, I can remember a vote taking place. Where did these people come from? It is hard to get to know 435 people, but I knew Barbara. Everybody knew Barbara. But in the Senate we came together, served on the same committees, and we got to know each other very well early on. Barbara Mikulski has always protected me, looked out for me. One of my first memories took place right here in the well. I was new, she was new, and it was a very close vote. It was an issue that was her issue, and I couldn't vote her way. That happens here. It was a close vote. People were nudging me: ``You have to change. You are going to upset everybody. You are a Democrat; you can't do that.'' In walked Barbara Mikulski into this crowd. I was there. I was really kind of afraid, but she wasn't. She walked in. People moved away. She said, ``Leave him alone. It is a matter of principle.'' People left me alone. That is who she is. Was she disappointed? I know she would have been disappointed had I not done what I believed in. I served for 10 years with John Ensign, the Senator from Nevada. John and I had a unique relationship. In 1998 I won an election for the Senate between Ensign and Reid by 428 votes. That was a close election. But as fate would have it, 2 years later he came to the Senate. Senator Bryan retired, and he came to the Senate. Well, John had some personal issues. He hadn't been here very long at all and had some personal issues. I called him at home, and he said, ``Yes, I have some problems here.'' I thought how I could help him. Here in the Senate we have the right to do what is called pair. Senator Ensign and I rarely voted alike anyway. So I said, ``Well, John, what I will do, so it won't affect your voting record, is that I will just pair with you and that way it won't show you have missed votes.'' So I agreed to do that, and for 2 weeks I told him I would do that. Well, it worked out fine because we voted differently on everything, except there came an issue that affected Senator Mikulski. She came to me and asked, ``Why are you voting that way?'' I told her, ``Senator Ensign has a personal issue, and I told him I would pair with him.'' She said, ``If you had done anything else''--and I won't use her exact language--``you would have been a fool.'' I wasn't a fool in her mind. Even though it was not good for her, she was supportive of me. She would not have been satisfied that I had done something that was wrong in her mind, and she accepted my explanation and that I had to do what I did. We have always had a lot of respect for each other. Senator David Pryor of Arkansas had a heart attack and became very ill. He was a wonderful Senator. Everyone liked him. But he announced he couldn't serve as secretary of the Democratic caucus, and that was something that I was interested in. But I also heard Barbara Mikulski was interested in it. She had been so good to me so often that I immediately went to Barbara, and with the two of us together, I said, ``Barbara, do you want this secretary's job?'' She said, ``Yes.'' I said, ``You have it.'' That was the end of that. Nobody opposed her. Well, surprisingly, a few years later, out of nowhere, Wendell Ford, who was the whip, decided he wasn't going to run for reelection. It was a surprise to everyone. He was assistant Democratic leader, and that was something I was interested in, but again there was Barbara Mikulski. I didn't say a word. The word was out there that I was interested in it. So as fate would have it, I was walking from my office in the Hart Building over toward the Russell Building, and she was coming in the other direction. Those of us who know Barbara know that a lot of times she is a person of few words. She is not a gadfly. Sometimes she talks a lot, but sometimes she doesn't want to talk. We were passing each other in the hall, and she said, ``I want to talk to you for a minute.'' She said, ``You took care of me in the Senate; the whip's job is yours.'' That ended it. It was all over. When that was done, I had a clear route to be the whip of the Senate-- the Democratic Senate. That is the relationship I have with Barbara Mikulski. So she is as responsible as anyone for my years in Democratic leadership. Without her friendship and her loyalty my last 20 years in the Senate would have been much different. Working with Barbara Mikulski is one of the highlights of my congressional career. Just hearing her speak is a privilege. I have seen and listened to good orators. When I was in the House--and my friend, the Democratic whip is here--we heard Jim Wright. Jim Wright was a great orator. He was the majority leader and the Speaker of the House. He was really good. Tom Lantos, an immigrant from Hungary, could speak. He was so dynamic, so good. Claude Pepper had a different style but was someone you listened to. Here in the Senate I have listened to some great orators. Back there was Dale Bumpers. I can still see him. He had a long cord here. He had an extra-long one, and he would walk up and down these aisles speaking. He was a great orator. I listened to him. George Mitchell, one of my predecessors, was so good, so articulate--and Dick Durbin, from Illinois. They are all terrific orators. But in my estimation, there is no better orator who I have come across in my congressional service than Barbara Mikulski. We have talked about her one liners, but I would like, just for a minute, to talk about a trip I took with a congressional delegation led by the very famous John Glenn--war hero, astronaut, and gentleman. We went to places in Europe. The Iron Curtain was down. We went to Poland. Barbara Mikulski's heritage is Polish. They called in John Glenn to give a speech. Ted Stevens from Alaska was also on that trip. I said, ``We have someone here who is of Polish heritage. Let's listen to her.'' Oh, what a speech--I mean it was spellbinding. She talked about how she felt about who she was and about her grandparents and her parents. So I know there is no better orator than Barbara Mikulski. That is because she speaks from the heart. She is honest and so genuine. As the Baltimore Sun wrote: ``People know authenticity when they see it, and there's nothing fake about Barbara Mikulski, most especially her love of her job.'' That is pretty good, coming from the biggest newspaper in the State. Barbara has loved her job in the Senate, and the people of Maryland and the United States have loved having her as their advocate and defender. She leaves the Senate as she entered it, as a political activist and a fighter. So, Barbara, thank you very much for your guidance, your mentoring, your friendship. It has been an honor to work by your side. We are forever friends. Godspeed, Barbara Mikulski. I yield the floor. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me just echo the comments of our Democratic leader, Senator Reid, in relation to Senator Mikulski. I will save a few moments perhaps next week to speak my own tribute to her and give my own reminiscences. But I didn't want to abruptly change the subject without saying I am in total agreement with Senator Reid in terms of the quality of service and friendship that we have had with the senior Senator from the State of Maryland. Tuesday, December 6, 2016 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saluting the public life of Senator Barbara Mikulski. Before I do that, I want to thank a woman who is not here. She was a Catholic nun and the debate coach for Senator Mikulski when she was in high school at the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore, the same school Nancy Pelosi graduated from. As a young Barbara Mikulski was preparing to debate a particularly tough opponent, this nun, her debate coach, told her: ``You can do it, Barb--get out there and roll those Jesuit boys!'' I went to a Jesuit college and law school, and I am proud and relieved to report that I never had to face Barbara Mikulski in that kind of debate. I have rarely found anybody who can stand up to her in a debate. She can still ``roll those Jesuit boys,'' or anyone else who tries to stand in the way of helping women, children, seniors, or advancing fairness. Barbara Mikulski has been my colleague for 20 years, my friend, the chairwoman of my Appropriations Committee and the ranking member, and so many times an inspiration. As most of my colleagues know, my first job was working in the Senate as an intern, myself, in the office of Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. Like Barbara Mikulski, Paul Douglas was a champion for the underdog, and he was a pit bull when it came to protecting the American taxpayers. Every year, the University of Illinois chooses a leader of uncommon decency and courage to receive the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government. This year, I was honored to present that award on behalf of the University of Illinois and in the name of Paul Douglas to Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. I know Senator Douglas would have been thrilled that she is carrying on that same public service tradition. Some day--and I hope and trust I will live to see it-- the ultimate glass ceiling will break, and there will be a woman elected President of this country. When that historic day comes, we can be sure that Senator Barbara Mikulski will have had a hand in bringing it about. Many of my colleagues have spoken about the long list of times she has already broken glass ceilings herself: Barbara Mikulski, first woman ever elected statewide in her beloved State of Maryland; Barbara Mikulski, first Democrat elected to both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate; Barbara Mikulski, first woman to ever serve as head of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. But as Barbara, very self-deprecating, has often said, she has never been interested in simply being the first. She wants to be ``the first of many,'' and she has been. When Maryland voters sent Barbara Mikulski to this Senate in 1986, there were two women in the entire body: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, a Republican, and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, a Democrat--2 women in this Chamber out of 100 Senators. Today, there are 20 women Senators, and after they are sworn in on January 3, there will be 21. That is great progress, but not nearly enough by Barbara Mikulski's standards. Senator Mikulski also had the brainchild of making sure the women in the Senate became an even more powerful force. Her bipartisan, women Senators-only dinners were a rare display of bipartisanship in an institution too often divided. The discoveries of common cause, common trust, and common purpose resulting from those dinners have made a big difference on the floor of the Senate. Barbara Ann Mikulski is the proud granddaughter of Polish immigrants. Her parents owned a small grocery store in Baltimore. She, her parents, and her two younger sisters lived across the street in one of the famous Baltimore rowhouses. As a young girl, Barbara thought about becoming a Catholic nun. She changed her mind because, as she put it, ``that vow of obedience kind of slowed me down a bit.'' So she found other ways to practice the social gospel of justice. She was a driving force behind the first bill signed by President Barack Obama, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I was there that day. The President signed the bill, and he took the first pen from the first bill he was signing and handed it to Barbara Mikulski because he knew that she had been a champion for equality in the workplace for women throughout her career. There are two stories that I always think of when I think of Senator Mikulski. In October 2002, the Senate voted on whether to authorize the war in Iraq. Only 23 of the 100 Senators then serving voted against the Iraq war resolution. Of those 23 Senators, only 8 still remain in the Senate today: Barbara Boxer, who is leaving at the end of this Congress, Patrick Leahy, Patty Murray, Jack Reed, Debbie Stabenow, Ron Wyden, Barbara Mikulski, and myself. This is a woman who has always been willing to risk her career to follow her conscience. One of her great heroes is Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker Movement. The reason, Barbara Mikulski says, is that Dorothy Day was always ``trying to find the hopes of people,'' rather than preying on people's fear and anger. I saw Barbara Mikulski's instinctive appeal to hope on that infamous sad day--September 11, 2001. As dust was settling on that heart-wrenching, heart-breaking day, most of the Members of the Senate gathered on the steps of the Capitol. The hope was that there would be a demonstration by Members of both parties to the Nation and to the world of solidarity. Suddenly--unplanned, unscripted--Barbara Mikulski started singing ``God Bless America.'' Everyone joined in. In one of America's darkest hours, Barbara Mikulski brought us together. That is what a real leader does. I and so many in the Chamber and so many untold millions of Americans are going to miss her presence in the Senate. We take consolation in knowing that, while she is leaving the Senate, she is not leaving the fight. She will never leave the fight. Those of us who are returning in the next Congress have learned from Senator Mikulski, and we will continue to fight the good fight to invest in life-saving, job- creating medical breakthroughs at the National Institutes of Health--or, as Barbara Mikulski calls it, the ``National Institutes of Hope.'' We will continue the good fight she has fought with such pithiness and passion to make our Nation safer and make our economy fairer for all Americans. I know that she will continue that fight as well. Barbara Mikulski may be leaving the Senate, but no one ever has, and I doubt anyone ever will, think of Baltimore's Barbara Mikulski as ``retiring.'' I yield the floor. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, in the interest of time, I will limit my remarks. I rise this afternoon to commend and salute three Senators from the Democratic caucus who are leaving the Senate this year. I will have longer written statements for the Record to appropriately pay tribute to their service. In alphabetical order, Senator Boxer of California, Senator Mikulski of Maryland, and Senator Reid of Nevada. I will offer some specific remarks about Leader Reid, in the interest of time, but I do want to commend and salute Senator Boxer for her service to the people of California and to our Nation, as well as Senator Mikulski for her great work--two great advocates, two individuals whom we are going to miss terribly here in the Senate. As I said, I will put longer statements in the Record. ... Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this is a bittersweet moment as I rise to pay tribute to my esteemed colleague, dear friend, and fellow Senator, Barbara A. Mikulski, the longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. Congress. Senator Barb has been more than a dedicated champion for the State of Maryland; she has fought tirelessly for the welfare of all Americans across the country but especially the disadvantaged--equal pay for equal work, funding for childcare for working families, quality health care for all Americans, an ambitious space exploration program, robust homeland security programs, and fire protection grants. These are but a few of the causes Senator Barb has worked on for more than four decades as an outstanding public servant and legislator. She is rooted in the city we both call home, Baltimore, where her father ran a grocery store in Highlandtown. She earned her bachelor of science degree in sociology from Mount Saint Agnes College and a master of social work degree from the University of Maryland School of Social Work. She became a social worker and then demonstrated her formidable organizational skills and resolve when she led the successful opposition to a 16-lane highway that was going to cut through the Fells Point neighborhood in Baltimore. Throughout her 40 years of congressional service, she has returned to Baltimore almost every night. She ran for the city council in 1971, where she served for 5 years before she was elected to the House of Representatives to represent Maryland's Third District--a seat she held for 10 years. I was proud to succeed her in the House when she was elected to the Senate in 1986 and became the first female Democratic Senator elected in her own right. Here in the Halls of the Senate, she opened doors that had previously been closed to women. She refused to accept second-class treatment because of her gender and fought to be recognized as an equal. Generations of young women who chose to participate in public life or who dreamed of joining the U.S. Senate have benefited from Senator Barb's trailblazing legacy. From affordable housing and education to childcare, health benefits, and pensions, she has left an indelible imprint on the Nation's social policies as a senior member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. It is fitting that she authored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009--the first major bill to be signed into law by the first African-American President. I know one of her proudest accomplishments is strengthening the social safety net for seniors by passing the Spousal Anti-Impoverishment Act, which helps keep seniors from going into bankruptcy while paying for a spouse's nursing home care. Senator Barb said, ``We work on macro issues and macaroni and cheese issues. ... Our national debate reflects the needs and dreams of American families.'' In 2012, she became the first woman and the first Marylander to chair the Senate Appropriations Committee. She has worked well with Senator Cochran and other Republicans on the committee to produce annual appropriations bills under difficult budget constraints. I think she has shown how the Senate can work in a productive, bipartisan fashion. Senator Mikulski has served as the dean of the women Senators from both parties, promoting collegiality, civility, and consensus-building. In this capacity, again, she has been one of the leaders of this institution with respect to making it work better. Senator Barb has always had her feet planted firmly on the ground, but she has reached for the stars. No one has been a stronger advocate for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA; the National Science Foundation, NSF; and for researching and understanding the universe to make life better here on Earth than Senator Barbara Mikulski. Not only has she reached for the stars, she is a star. NASA named a supernova after her in 2012--Supernova Mikulski--discovered, fittingly, by the Hubble Space Telescope on January 25, 2012. The supernova is 7.5 billion light-years away and the remnants of a star more than 8 times as massive as our own Sun. Senator Mikulski has so much political energy per square inch of height that she has reached her own orbit in space. Even though her realm includes the entire universe, Senator Barb always kept the needs of Marylanders close to her heart during her tenure. Whether it is fighting for funding to restore the Chesapeake Bay, supporting mass transit improvements in Baltimore, standing up for Federal employees and retirees who work and live in our State, or posting the world's best recipe for crabcakes on her Web site, I know I speak on behalf of each and every Marylander when I say how much we will miss her outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment to our State. I am privileged to have worked with Senator Barb for 10 years in the Senate and for 20 years before that when I was in the House of Representatives. I am proud to have stood alongside her as two members of Team Maryland. On a personal basis, I have a very close friend and my service in the Senate is much more productive, much more enjoyable, and much more rewarding because of Senator Barbara Mikulski. The U.S. Congress, the State of Maryland, the United States, and, indeed, the world are better places because of Senator Mikulski's public service. She may not be the tallest Senator, but she certainly leaves the biggest shoes to fill. I will miss her, but I will remain internally inspired by her shining example of public service at its best. Wednesday, December 7, 2016 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as each session of Congress comes to a close, both leaders traditionally pay tribute to the retiring Members of their own parties. This year is a bit different, of course, with the retirement of the Democratic leader. So in addition to what I will be saying about him tomorrow, I figured I might shake things up just a bit more, just this one time. I figured I would tell my colleagues about two colleagues from across the aisle who have made their own mark on this Chamber for many years. The first colleague I wish to speak about is from Maryland. Some call her Senator Mikulski, some call her Senator Barb, but everyone knows this: She is tough. It explains how she got here in the fist place. You see, Barbara Mikulski had a lot of dreams growing up. She wanted to be a scientist. She wanted to be a nun. She even wanted to be an astronaut. If not for a ``C'' in chemistry, a vow of obedience, and the thought of wearing a flight suit--or so we have heard--she probably could have done all of those things. But Senator Barb chose a different path--or rather all of them at once. You see, you don't have to work in a lab to champion science research; you can serve as the lead Democratic appropriator on the Commerce-Justice-Science Subcommittee. You don't have to put on a habit to look out for others; you can serve as dean of the Senate women and cultivate mentorship among your colleagues. And you certainly don't have to blast into space to blaze a trail--something this longest serving female Member of Congress knows very well. It wasn't an easy road getting here. It wasn't an easy road when she got here. No Democratic woman had ever been elected to the Senate in her own right before Barbara Mikulski. But, as she said on the stump, ``I might be short, but I won't be overlooked.'' Boy, she hasn't been. I doubt she ever will be. Maybe it has something to do with the mantra she follows: ``Do or do not--there is no try.'' No surprise that this ``Star Wars'' fan is taking advice from Master Yoda. She has learned a lot from others, too, like her great- grandmother, who emigrated from Poland with hope and little else--hope that her family might one day experience this country's many freedoms and opportunities. I know she would be proud of her great-granddaughter today, proud of this crime novelist, this crabcake gourmet, this senior Senator from Maryland. So here is what we have come to know about Senator Mikulski: Her word is her bond, she is a passionate advocate for the causes she supports, and good luck stopping her once she puts her mind to something. ... Let me finish with some advice Barbara Mikulski gave to young Barbara Boxer as she contemplated her first Senate run. ``If you run,'' Senator Mikulski said, ``it will be the toughest thing you will ever do,'' but, she added, it will also be ``the best thing you will ever do.'' I think this is something we can all relate to regardless of which party we belong to and regardless of which State we come from. At the end of the day, we all came here to accomplish things for the people we represent, even if we have different ideas on how to do them. So, thankfully, there should be no disagreement over this next task. I ask all Senators to join me in recognizing our colleagues for their service and to join me in wishing them good luck as they begin the next chapters of their lives. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, yesterday I had an opportunity on the floor to talk about Senator Mikulski, but I just want to take 1 minute--because I know a lot of my colleagues want to speak--to thank her on behalf of the people of Maryland. Yesterday I was with Senator Mikulski at the inauguration of Catherine Pugh, our new mayor of Baltimore. As is the tradition on programs, the senior Senator speaks and then the junior Senator speaks, so I had the opportunity to speak after the dynamic remarks of Senator Mikulski. That has been a burden that I have had now for 10 years. As I pointed out to the people of Maryland, we are losing one of the great giants and advocates for our State, and that is going to be a great loss. The only benefit I can see is that I will not have to follow Senator Mikulski on the program in the future. We are living part of a legacy, and we know that. We know that what we do here in the U.S. Senate one day will be recorded in the history of our country. I know that Senator Mikulski will be mentioned frequently for her incredible accomplishments here in the U.S. Senate. On a personal basis, I just wanted to express that my life in the U.S. Senate has been special. For all of us, being in the Senate is special, but my enjoyment, productivity, and life in the Senate has been made so much greater because of my seatmate and friend, Senator Barbara Mikulski. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it is with deep affection, admiration, and appreciation that I rise today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to our colleague and my dear friend, Senator Barbara Mikulski, as her service in the Senate comes to a close. As the longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. Congress--30 years in this Chamber, in addition to 10 years in the House--she has earned the gratitude of the people of her beloved Maryland and of the entire Nation. That gratitude is based on much more than simple arithmetic, much more than just how many years she has served here, impressive though that is. In reflecting on her service, it is difficult to decide where to begin--her accomplishments, her vision, or her complete dedication to the people she serves, the dedication that began in that neighborhood in Baltimore that she describes so passionately today. No matter where we begin, we end up in the same place--it is all about her character. Perhaps the best way to describe Senator Mikulski's character is by noting that she is not only officially the longest serving woman in the history of the Congress, but she is also unofficially the dean of the women in the Senate. That title perfectly demonstrates the trust and respect she has earned from her colleagues. As a brandnew Senator in 1997, I was one of those tutored by this accomplished and experienced dean. At that time, Senator Mikulski had already been in the House and the Senate for a combined 20 years. She didn't know me from Adam--or perhaps I should say from Eve--yet, despite the difference in our seniority, our States, and our parties, she took me under her wing. She was one of the first people who called me after I was sworn in as a new Senator. I was so grateful for her kindness and her wisdom. She invited me to a power workshop in her office, along with Mary Landrieu, the other woman who was elected that year. She taught me the ropes of the appropriations process and instituted regular bipartisan dinners for the women of the Senate. In the years since then, I have come to know her as a fighter, a trailblazer, and a person of such integrity. Maybe it is all those years with the nuns that taught you that. It has been a privilege to work with her on such vital issues as home health care, maritime issues, higher education, pay equality, and an issue near and dear to both of us, Alzheimer's research. Serving with her on the Appropriations Committee, I have witnessed first hand what an extraordinary leader she is--fair, openminded, yet with firm expectations and a clear sense of direction. Senator Mikulski is, above all, a hard worker. Growing up in east Baltimore, she learned the value of hard work in her family's grocery store, as we have heard today. Her commitment to making a difference in her neighborhood led her to become a social worker, helping at-risk children and our seniors. The statement she made sums up her approach to serving in Congress: ``I was a social worker for Baltimore families. Now I'm a social worker building opportunities for families throughout America.'' Two years ago, I was honored to stand alongside Senator Barb to accept the Allegheny College Prize for Civility in Public Life. We were representing all of the women of the Senate for our leadership in bringing an end to the devastating government shutdown of 2013 and working together on so many other issues. With our dean setting the example, we have always rejected the idea of a women's caucus because we, like the men in the Senate, span the ideological spectrum. Who would expect otherwise? We have worked together across party lines to serve all Americans. As Senator Mikulski puts it ``It's not about gender, it's about the agenda.'' In fact, all of us have our favorite sayings that the Senator from Maryland has taught us, and we will miss her way with words so much. When Senator Mikulski reached her Senate longevity milestone 5 years ago, she surpassed my personal role model in public service, the legendary Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith. Just as the great lady from Maine inspired me and countless other young women of my generation to serve, the great lady from Maryland inspires the young women of today, always encouraging them to go for it. Throughout her life in public service, she has lived by one guiding principle: to help our people meet the needs of today as she helps our Nation prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. What an honor it has been to serve alongside Senator Barbara Mikulski. I have learned so much from her. I will never forget the day she told me I had the soul of an appropriator, which I knew was the highest compliment she could give me. She was right. We have worked on that committee to get so much done. I wish her many more years of health, happiness, and, most of all, that most important ``ship,'' friendship. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before Senator Collins leaves the floor, I want to thank Senator Collins for her beautiful remarks about Barbara Mikulski. As I leave here, I have said publicly--the press has asked: ``What is your hope?'' I often say, ``My hope is with the Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, to bridge some of the partisan divides.'' It has been an honor to serve with you. I know you have a lot on your shoulders as we move forward. Senator Mikulski, I want to take a few minutes to talk about you. Some Senators have focus and drive. Some have compassion. Some have empathy. Some have sharp negotiating skills. Some have a quick wit. Some are great students of history. Some are champions for the least among us. Senator Barbara Mikulski, you are all of these things. You are everything a Senator should be and more. As my mentor, as my treasured friend, you have been a major influence in my career. Honestly, I can say I would not be here as a U.S. Senator without your guidance. One of my favorite things about Barbara is her wonderful sense of humor. It is legendary. She is hilarious when she wants to be. When I was in the House of Representatives, I was fighting to integrate the all-male House gym. The room to which they had assigned the women was about 6 by 6, and it had showers and hair dryers. You know the big hair dryers that come over your head like that? It had no exercise equipment. It had no space. It was the size of a shoebox. We women decided we needed some exercise, so we packed into the tiny room. There was then-Congresswoman Mikulski, Congresswoman Ferraro, Congresswoman Schroeder, Barbara Kennelly, Olympia Snowe, who looked like she had just stepped out of Vogue magazine. I was in my sweat suit, and so was Barb. The teacher was leading us in an aerobics class, and she said, ``Put your hands above your head.'' We did it. She said, ``Put your hands out to the side.'' We did it. Then she said, ``Put your hands on your hips and bend at the waist.'' With that, Barbara yelled, ``Look, if I had a waist, I wouldn't be here.'' That is my Barb. She can use laughter to defuse any situation. I will always love her for it. When I started thinking about my own long shot bid for the Senate--and it was worse than a long shot--the first person I went to after my family was Barb. It was a few years after she had made history by becoming the first Democratic woman ever elected in her own right to the U.S. Senate. She got right to the point: ``How old are you, Babs?''--using the nickname she calls me to this day. I told her I was almost 50. God, that sounds so young, Barbara. I told her I was almost 50. I explained it was going to be a tough fight. I was up against two powerful male opponents in the Democratic primary, and I was an asterisk in the polls. What was her response? She looked at me and she said, ``Go for it. It's worth the fight you'll have to wage to get here. And it will be a fight.'' And it was. In 1992, four new women came to the Senate, and who was waiting for us with open arms? Senator Mikulski. This is what she said: ``Some women stare out the window waiting for Prince Charming. I stared out the window waiting for more women Senators--and it is finally happening!'' That is who Barbara is. She never set out to make a name for herself. She wanted to blaze a trail that was wide enough for all of us to follow. Just days after I won that first Senate race, she sent all the new women Senators a guidebook she herself had written about how to get started in the Senate, how to get on committees. She invited us to her office for lessons on Senate procedure and how to set up our offices. She had covered everything. In the years since, as you have heard, she has hosted regular dinners for all the women in the Senate-- Democratic and Republican alike. We reach across party lines and come together because of her. We talk about our work, our families. We share our struggles and our triumphs. What is said there stays there. Senator Mikulski has led us by example, showing us how to build coalitions, how to bridge the partisan divide, which includes strong partnership with our male colleagues, whom she calls ``Sir Galahads.'' She has also shown us how to stand up and make our voices heard. As she says, go ``earring to earring'' with our opponents and ``put on our lipstick, square our shoulders, suit up and fight.'' Legendary Mikulski words. To me, Senator Mikulski is the whole package--a skilled, intelligent negotiator, a Senator who fights for the people, and a woman who helps other women. She is our cherished leader, and that is why she will always be known as the dean of the Senate women. When Barbara announced she would be leaving the Senate, I wrote her a rhyme. I love to write rhymes and lyrics. I wrote her the following rhyme: Before Mikulski won the day, A guy would have to pass away, And then his wife would take his place. Finally, a woman in a Senate space. But Barb she got there in her own right. First Democratic gal to win that fight. She won the race and joined the misters. But finally NOW she has 19 sisters! Barbara, next year, because of what you started, because of the people you encouraged, there will be 21 women in the Senate--a record. Sitting here in my chair, my seat, will be an incredible woman. Senator Mikulski, Barb, my treasured mentor, my dear friend, thank you for everything. We have been through battles together. I am forever grateful to you, and I will always treasure our friendship. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I thank the gentlelady from California. Mrs. BOXER. I like ``gentlelady.'' Ms. MIKULSKI. That is the way we talk here. I thank the gentlelady from California for her kind words. We have been together through thick, thin, and the attempt to get thin, and that story about bending at the waist is a true one. I am not the person with the best hairdo or sleek or chic, but one of the things I have so admired about my friend is her authenticity. We first got to know each other in the House, and then I encouraged you to come to the Senate, which certainly was the right thing to do. You are yourself. You are true to yourself, you are true to your beliefs. You are true to your constituents, and you are true to the Constitution. You are such a true blue person. There are many words to describe you, such as outspoken, feisty, and all of that, but I would say the word that describes you best is ``authentic.'' You are who you are. The people of California have loved you for it and sent you to the Congress. We started out together basically in city council roles, sometimes called the pothole parliament. It has been a pleasure to serve with the Senator from California. I have watched you stand up for your beliefs, and along the way, as you stood up for your beliefs, you made believers of us all. Godspeed to you, Barbara. We are friends forever. Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I wish to speak about Senator Mikulski and then also Senator Boxer, the two great Senator Barbaras who have been such giants in the Senate. We are so grateful to both of them. Madam President, I do have to say that among the many things with which I have been honored and have appreciated was when Senator Mikulski accepted my offer to stay at the Stabenow bed and breakfast after long session nights and days when the Appropriations Committee was negotiating and doing the incredible work that had to be done. I had the honor of being able to put up a plaque in my home that says: ``Senator Barb slept here.'' I will always be honored to have had that opportunity on top of all of the other ways we have worked together. It really is an honor to stand here. I can't imagine the Senate without Senator Mikulski and Senator Boxer. I can't imagine the Senate without the incredible service of my dear friend and colleague, who is our dean in every sense of the word--the senior Senator from the State of Maryland. For over 30 years she has worked tirelessly. We know that. We hear it every day. We know what the people in Baltimore, the Chesapeake Bay area, and all of Maryland care about. She has been fighting and standing up for them every single moment of every single day. I so admire that, and I am so grateful. She has been a wonderful inspiration and mentor to me. We have all heard about our dinners and the power briefings on appropriations. She has been a continual source of inspiration and a mentor to me. She reached out to me, as she does to all of our colleagues, when I was first elected. She welcomed me and showed me what it meant to be a good Senator representing my State of Michigan and how to get things done. Senator Mikulski has always been willing to lend a helping hand and has never given up when it comes to fighting for the people she represents and being a trailblazer. I came into the Senate with a master's degree in social work. Senator Mikulski has often said that we are the two official do-gooders in the Senate. We have taken our interest from helping people individually to another level by becoming policymakers, thereby giving us the opportunity to touch more lives by using our skills and our background in education as well. We all know--but I think it is important to remind ourselves--that she was only 26 when Senator Mikulski talked about the highway proposal that would have destroyed a neighborhood full of working people. She spoke up. She was noticed, and she wasn't afraid to say exactly what she was thinking. She was and is absolutely fearless in every good sense of that word. She brought that fearlessness to the Senate. That fearlessness made her the first woman to serve as chair of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate. It doesn't get more important than that in setting policy and having an impact on people's lives in our country by prioritizing the interests of the American people in every funding decision. That fearlessness was on display when she helped bring us closer to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, making it closer to having equal pay for equal work than it has ever been before. Senator Mikulski fought for health care. I was proud to join her in making sure that women could receive preventive care without a copay. She made sure that women were truly represented and that our needs were met in health care reform, and that will continue to impact all of the lives of women across the country. When she turned her eyes to the stars, wondering what was up there, she made sure that the Goddard Space Flight Center was a leader in exploring the unknown. Like the supernova named after her, she has absolutely astonished us with her brilliance, and nothing will be quite the same after she leaves here. Her work in the Senate has made it possible for so many women and girls across America to put their hat in the ring and say: ``I want to run for office, and I can do it.'' Senator Mikulski said it best--there are so many wonderful quotes I will always use--when she said: ``Put your lipstick on, square your shoulders, and suit up. Go into the fight and get things done.'' That has become a mantra for us in working together. I thank Senator Barb. You will be greatly missed, but I know you have so much more to give. I know you will always make a difference in people's lives in every single thing you do every single day, and we will be forever grateful. Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, again, I thank the gentlelady from Michigan. We both have master's degrees in social work. I joke, but I am actually serious when I say we are certified do-gooders. When people hear about social work, they sometimes think it is about giving money away, but it is really about trying to help people build lives, build families, and therefore build the Nation. The Senator from Michigan's championship in that area has been amazing to me. I am so glad my friend from Michigan is here in the Senate, whether she is standing up for the people in Flint, MI, so they have safe drinking water, or standing up for those who need help in the area of food and nutrition so there aren't food deserts in communities. That is one of the biggest public health initiatives. If you are a diabetic, you can't comply if all you can get is fast food and french fries. If you are a child, you need good food and good nutrition. My friend knows more than anybody that you need to feed the body, the mind, and the spirit, and she has certainly done that. It has been great being your pal and partner. Many people don't know this, but Senator Cardin and I commute every day. When those appropriation cycles got pretty late, after midnight, the gentlelady from Michigan offered her home to me. We had a saying: ``Stop whining and have a glass of wine.'' There was nothing like being able to talk about your day with a colleague who will offer inspiration and encouragement at the end of the day. My friend offered her home, but she has really fought for so many people to have a home and a community in order to have what they need so they can learn and prosper in this country. I just wish you so much and wish you all the best. Thank you very much. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. COONS. Madam President, I wish to offer a few brief comments, if I might, so I may thank and congratulate Senator Mikulski for her tireless contributions to the State of Maryland and the whole country. As many know, she is a passionate, capable, effective champion for people of all backgrounds, and she got her start in local government. One of the things we have in common is that I, too, started in a very humble office as a county council member in my home community of New Castle County, DE. The way I first met Barbara Mikulski and first saw her toughness, grit, passion, and determination was in a fight over a program she helped give life to, the national service program known as AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps is a fantastic national program that partners with the Federal Government, State, and local governments, the private sector, and nonprofit volunteers. She has been a tireless champion for AmeriCorps over many years and has made a lasting difference in its areas of focus and work. During my short 6 years here, she has been a great friend and a mentor to me and to so many others on both sides of the aisle. Joe Biden, our Vice President, has often said: ``Show me your budget, and I will show you your values.'' As leader of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski helped to lift up our values and helped to make sure we invested in effective programs that made sure we fed the hungry, housed the homeless, fought for manufacturing, and ensured that Federal workers who lived in Maryland and Federal agencies that were rooted, not just in Maryland but around the country, had the resources, support, and capacity to make a lasting difference here in our region and for the entire country. I just wanted to add my voice to colleagues who stood here on the floor and said: We are so grateful to Senator Barbara Mikulski for her decades of service to Baltimore, to Maryland, and to our country, and for all she has done to lift us up together. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I rise to compliment and congratulate my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski, on her decision to retire from the U.S. Senate. We are going to miss her very much. She has been a very effective Senator in speaking not only as a representative for the State of Maryland but also for the entire country on so many different issues and Federal responsibilities of our government. She has been very successful in every way-- serving as chair of the Committee on Appropriations, where it has been my pleasure to work closely with her as the vice chair when the Republicans were in the minority, and then coming to chair the committee, with her as the ranking Democratic member during other periods. It has been a distinct honor to serve with her on the Appropriations Committee. In 2012, she became the first woman to chair the committee. She has also served as vice chairwoman for the past 2 years. I am pleased that we have been able to work together to report bills that reflect our shared commitment to national security, scientific research, education, and economic development. Senator Mikulski has been a very valuable partner throughout. Her approach to funding decisions as chairwoman and vice chairwoman highlights the importance of the constitutional role of Congress to be good stewards of taxpayer money. I congratulate Barbara Mikulski on her distinguished career representing the people of Maryland which reflects great credit on our U.S. Senate. Best wishes to her. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, history is dotted with the stories of trailblazers, people who shape the public discourse at a pivotal moment in time or change the direction of the debate. One of those trailblazers is Barbara Mikulski, the longest serving woman in Senate history, the first woman to represent Maryland in the U.S. Senate, and the first woman to chair the Senate's Appropriations Committee. She is tough. She is direct. She is dedicated. She is a fighter. She is a leader. Barbara Mikulski has always fought for our families and our children. From her roots as a social worker and community activist to the levels of leadership in the Senate, she has held firm to her adage that she is not just the Senator from Maryland, she is the Senator for Maryland. From her first years in the Senate until now, she has promoted education, nutrition, health care, and gender equality in the Senate. She led our historic efforts to pass the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act--shouting from the rooftops the simple principle that women deserve equal pay for equal work. She continued that legacy with the Paycheck Fairness Act. Wouldn't it be a fitting tribute if the Senate considered and approved that commonsense legislation before she retires? Like others in this Chamber, she was a vocal and steadfast supporter of the Violence Against Women Act and our most recent efforts to reauthorize and expand those life-saving programs. She led the efforts to ensure that the Affordable Care Act made clear that no one should be discriminated against in preventive care. Who can forget her fierce advocacy to make the letter of the law clear that being a woman is not a preexisting condition? When Barbara assumed the mantle chairing the Appropriations Committee, she brought with her the tough but fair grit that has been her hallmark in the Senate. When asked about earmarks, her retort was simple: ``I've told Senators that if you're opposed to earmarks, I'll honor that and won't include any for your State.'' You always know where you stand with Barbara Mikulski. Thirty years ago, when she first came to the Senate, women filled just two seats in this body. When the Senate convenes next year, there will be 21. I hope it won't be another 30 years for the Senate to be truly representative of the country we serve. A lifelong Baltimore resident, ``Senator Barb'' has never forgotten her roots, probably because she never left. She remains a Marylander through and through, dedicated to her State and never forgetting that listening to your constituents is the most important job of all. When Senator Mikulski announced her retirement, she told her constituents that the question came down to whether she wanted to spend her time ``raising money or raising hell to meet your day-to-day needs?'' That is Barbara. This rang through in her farewell speech today to the Senate. We often talk of the lions of the Senate. Barbara Mikulski ranks among them. I will miss her fierce advocacy, her counsel, her commitment, her tenacity, and her grit. I value her friendship, and we will miss her. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor our colleagues who are leaving us at the end of this Congress, six individuals who have done a lot to shape how the Senate operates today. First I would like to thank my three Republican colleagues who are departing. Thank you not only for your service to our country but your willingness to work with me and other members of my party on a number of issues. ... I would also like to speak to three of my closest colleagues on our side of the aisle. Over the past 24 years, I have had the pleasure of serving in the Senate with Harry Reid, Barbara Mikulski, and Barbara Boxer, and I am grateful not just for our working relationships but for the close friendships I have formed with each of them. ... Mr. President, Barbara Mikulski is another fearless leader whom I admire. When I first came to the Senate in November 1992, there were only three female Senators: Jocelyn Burdick of North Dakota, who retired a month later; Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas; and, of course, Senator Barb. Senator Mikulski often quips, ``I may be short, but I won't be overlooked.'' History certainly will not overlook the contributions she has made. Rising to become the first woman to chair the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski is often described as a trailblazer. To the women in the Senate, she is a mentor, the dean of the Senate women. From 3 women in 1992 to 20 women Senators today--and 21 in the next Congress, much of that progress can be attributed to the leadership of the longest serving woman in Congress, Senator Mikulski. ... Thursday, December 8, 2016 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to take an opportunity to salute and thank and commend my colleagues who are departing. ... We also have other colleagues departing: Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire; Senator Boxer of California, Senator Coats of Indiana; as I mentioned, Senator Kirk of Illinois; Senator Mikulski of Maryland; Senator Reid of Nevada; and Senator Vitter of Louisiana. Each has brought passion in their work to best serve their constituents, and the institution of the Senate and the Nation are better for this service. I am better for knowing them, working with them, and having the opportunity to share with them, and I want to thank them for their service. Let me mention a few words with respect to all of these distinguished Senators. ... Mr. President, Barbara Mikulski--what an extraordinary individual. She is a pioneer. She was the first Democratic woman Senator elected in her own right. She is the longest serving woman in the history of the Congress. Barbara Mikulski and history are one and the same. She has made it. She came from very modest roots in Baltimore. She talked yesterday on the floor about her father and mother running a small grocery store in her neighborhood. She took that sense of community, that sense of dedication, and that sense of selfless service to others. As she said, she was inspired by the nuns that taught her, and that inspiration was extraordinary and fully realized in her life. There are a lot of Sisters of Mercy and Sisters of Notre Dame who are sitting back today thinking: I knew that young lady had it in her. She certainly did. She led us on the Appropriations Committee, the first woman to chair the committee. She has done so much to assist me on issues that are so important to Rhode Island. I must say that she and Kit Bond, one of her colleagues, were extraordinary in recognizing the problems of lead exposure in children and providing needed resources. I thank her for that. She has assisted the fishermen in communities in Rhode Island with real assistance and real aid. She has done it over and over. She has given me profound advice, counsel, and kindness. She said yesterday on the floor: ``The best ship in the world is friendship.'' I agree, but ultimately the measure of our service and of our days is kindness. I must say that by that measure, she is a very towering figure in the Senate, in the history of the United States, and I thank her. ... I have been very fortunate. I have had the privilege to serve with these ladies and gentlemen, and I want to thank them for their service. Mr. ENZI. ... Mr. President, I also want to take some time today to speak about the senior Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski. In the years to come, Senator Mikulski will be known for a lot of things that made her years of service to the people of Maryland quite remarkable. It will always be mentioned that she has been the longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. Congress. Although that is important, Senator Mikulski did not come to Washington to see how long she could stay. She came here to see how much of a difference she could make. In the end, she served for so many years because of what she was able to do with her time in the House and then in the Senate. The people of Maryland have such a strong affection for Senator Mikulski because they always felt like she was one of them. She never lost touch with the people back home. Her family name was well known to the people in her neighborhood because her parents ran a grocery store. Every morning they opened their store early so people could stop by to pick up something before they headed off to work. In that, and so many other ways, her family played an important role in the day-to-day life of their neighborhood and her neighbors never forgot that. When the opportunity came for Senator Mikulski to run for a seat in the House representing Baltimore, she didn't hesitate. She took her case to the people and they liked what they heard. She won what was to be the first of a long series of elections, each of which she won easily and impressively. Senator Mikulski has a number of interests, and one of the things I am sure she enjoyed about Congress has been her ability to take up a number of those issues to make a difference in people's lives. In everything she has done, she has always found a way to help the people back home. A key example of that is her fight over ``the road.'' The battle dates back to 1966 when Barbara was a social worker in Baltimore. The city council proposed building a highway to connect downtown Baltimore to its suburbs, a plan that Barbara worried would cause Polish-Americans, African- Americans, and lower income residents to lose their homes. As is her way, Barbara sprung to action by forming a community group of opposition. The road was blocked. Barbara wound up on the city council, and the area where the road was supposed to be built is now one of Baltimore's biggest draws. As far as her work in the Senate goes, one of her many legislative victories that I will long remember is work she did on something that came to be known as Rosa's Law. Rosa was a 9-year-old young lady who was diagnosed with Down syndrome. Her mother was well aware of what a hurtful label things like ``mental retardation'' and ``mentally retarded'' were to those who saw them in the Federal laws that were written to help them. Barbara knew there was only one solution to this problem and that was to eliminate those terms from Federal law. I was pleased to be able to help in the effort to pass that bill, seeing how much it meant not only to Rosa and her family but to Senator Barbara Mikulski. Our work on that bill will stay with me and will be a reminder of the reason we work so hard to pass legislation and answer the needs of the people back home. In the end, it is all about making lives better. That is something Barbara has done every day of her service in Congress. As the longest serving woman in Congress, she has continued to earn the title of ``Dean of Senate Women.'' She has been a mentor and source of good advice to her colleagues who appreciated being able to ask for her opinion and her guidance on their work on the Senate. She certainly helped me when I was a new Senator and was advocating for low-income housing in Jackson, one of the rich areas of our State. With her support, we got that done and made sure there was a mix in the community of different occupations and people. Her reputation has been to not only help the Members of the Senate with whom she has served, it also helped serve to encourage the women of Maryland to get active and involved in the work that must be done to make her home State and our Nation better places to live. In a very real sense, her leadership skills have inspired the next generation of Maryland's leaders. Now Senator Mikulski is leaving the Senate after having made a difference and leaving her mark on the history of Congress. One of the key things she will be remembered for is her tireless support of NIH. I know they will miss her and her commitment to the principles and values that guided her through her career, from her service on the Baltimore City Council to her work in the House of Representatives and then the Senate. She made a difference everywhere she served. For that reason and for many more, she will never be forgotten. My wife Diana and I join in sending our best wishes to Senator Mikulski for her years of service. Now that her Senate adventure has come to an end, she will undoubtedly come up with more challenges to pursue in the years to come. I am hoping these plans might include a followup to her mystery novel that was set in the Senate. We are looking forward to seeing what the next chapter of her life may include. Good luck to these fellow Senators. Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, today I wish to honor my friend, colleague, and mentor from Maryland, Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring at the end of this year. Barbara has an impressively long and distinguished career in public service, representing her home State of Maryland in Congress for nearly 40 years. Since I came to the Senate in 2013, it has been a pleasure to serve alongside titans like Senator Mikulski. As a matter of fact, my first official Senate office was tucked in between hers and then-Senator Rockefeller's on the fifth floor of Hart. As neighbors we formed a friendly bond, and I oftentimes would stop by to chat with her or sometimes just Mrs. O'Malley, who runs a tight ship. On occasion, Senator Rockefeller and I would overstay our welcome, and Mrs. O'Malley would kick us out and send us back to our offices. For those of you who don't know, Mrs. O'Malley has played a critical role in Senator Mikulski's office for nearly 30 years and has helped instill the values of hard work and dedication to a generation of Hill staffers. As the longest serving woman in Congress, Senator Mikulski has inspired a generation of women to pursue careers in public service and run for higher office. As dean of the women Senators, Barbara worked to mentor new women Senators on how to be effective legislators and build coalitions across party lines to advance landmark legislation. The bipartisan women's group has met regularly under her leadership, helping bridge partisan divides that so often plague this Chamber by getting Senators to know each other on a personal level over her homemade Maryland crabcakes. One cannot mention Senator Mikulski without also mentioning her fierce advocacy and determination to make Maryland and our country a better place to live, work, and raise a family. One of the first bills I cosponsored when I came to the Senate was the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, VAWA, which Barbara played a critical role in originally passing. Since its passage in 1994, VAWA has been effective in responding to domestic violence. Additionally, she has worked tirelessly in the fight to close the pay gap for women, who currently earn about three-quarters of what men earn, by advancing the Paycheck Fairness Act, which I have proudly cosponsored twice now. Women shouldn't make 77 percent of what men earn for the same job. This hurts families who are just looking to take care of their kids, put food on their table, and keep a roof over their heads. Just as Senator Mikulski has been an advocate for families, she also understands the critical role science, research, and innovation play in creating economic growth in the United States. Maryland is home to several great institutions, such as the Goddard Space Flight Center, which I had the pleasure of visiting last fall, that are at the forefront of their respective fields. When I was at Goddard, the Director showed me the fascinating work their researchers and engineers are engaged in and how NASA's various missions help us enhance crop production and be better stewards of our planet. Her work on the Senate Appropriations Committee has helped keep the United States at the forefront of scientific discovery and technological innovation. Senator Mikulski is the best of American public service. She is smart, honest, empathetic, and outrageously funny. She has earned her reputation as a force to be reckoned with. On her next chapter, I wish her Godspeed--and may the force be with her. Friday, December 9, 2016 Ms. KLOBUCHAR. ... Madam President, I will close my remarks by turning to some of our retiring Senators and speaking briefly on each one of them. ... So there are two other Senators who are retiring this week, and one of them is Senator Barbara Mikulski. She has been, as the Presiding Officer [Mrs. Capito] knows, the dean of the women in the Senate for a very long time. She is the queen of one liners, and one of my favorite ones is one she uses when she talks about women elected officials. She always says: ``We see things not just at the macro level but at the macaroni-and-cheese level.'' After a few years when I had been in the Senate, she called us into the President's Room--a number of the women Senators--to gear up for a debate that mattered to the women of this country. She, literally--being short, as she is--stood on the couch in that room and said, ``Gear up. Square your shoulders. Put your lipstick on. Get ready for the revolution.'' Now, at the time, I was not even sure what the revolution was. I was thinking all the time that she had probably used that line for maybe much weightier things. But that is her life. She is an advocate. She is a leader. She is someone who has championed the women of the Senate and all women in elected office. She is the one who was here first, of her own making. She is not someone who took over a seat after a husband or father had died. She ran, and she ran on her own merit, and she leaves on her own merit. She leaves on the merit of passing incredibly important bills for Maryland, incredibly important legislation for this country. I will miss her as a mentor, and we will always miss her dearly. ... So we are going to miss Senator Reid, Senator Mikulski, and, also, Senator Boxer. Mr. McCONNELL. ... It goes without saying that keeping the Capitol running is a vast undertaking. It requires a passion for service, round-the-clock work, and great sacrifice by everyone employed. The legislative process simply wouldn't be possible without the dedicated work of so many. On behalf of the Senate, I would like to acknowledge their efforts and say thank you to the following: To my leadership team for their wise counsel; to our committee chairs and ranking members for so much great work over the past 2 years; to the many colleagues in both parties for working so hard to make this Senate a success; and, to those we are saying farewell to--Senators Coats, Boxer, Mikulski, Reid, Vitter, Kirk, and Ayotte--for your service to our country, I say thank you. ... Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring from the Senate this year, having spent 40 years serving the people of Maryland in Congress. Senator Mikulski has been a trailblazer all her life. She grew up in east Baltimore and attended Mount Saint Agnes College and the University of Maryland School of Social Work. She began her career as a social worker and community organizer before being elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1971. In 1976, Senator Mikulski won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she served for 10 years before winning election to the Senate in 1986. At the time Senator Mikulski began "
