        "text": "Today, Economic Justice is the OMG topic du jour.\n\nI’m continuing my blog series covering official religious statements on various social, justice, and medical ethics issues, and lining them up with the religious affiliations of various politicians.\n\n(Just scroll down to go directly to the religious groups, their statements, and the politicians affiliated with each group)\n\nHopefully, the blogs will shine some light on faith systems that intentionally make political and social claims; to discover what these claims are–and whether there appears to be any common ground from group to group; and to raise some questions and have some conversations about the appropriateness, let alone the intent and effectiveness, of religious groups asserting a certain claim and stake in any given issue.\n\nListing the religious affiliation of each politician seemed a natural extension of this project.\n\nEvery congressperson has publicly self-offered the listed religious identity below, and to that degree, must have some level of fidelity to it. (I gathered the information from Project Vote Smart, a respected volunteer group which helped me considerably; from this list from the Pew Forum and CQ Roll Call; and, when I had a hunch that more specific information than just “Christian” or “Protestant” might be available, I gleaned further specifics from various publicly available interviews online.)\n\nThere is a pretty significant difference, say, between the theology of Southern Baptists and members of the United Church of Christ. Those who belong to a given group must have some affinity for the group’s belief systems and priorities welling up from them. What does this mean, if anything, on the ground (or on the Hill, as the case may be)?\n\nAnd should it mean anything?\n\nThe first blog covered gun control.\n\nThe one at hand reviews religious statements about economic life and poverty.\n\nThis topic proved to me more broad and handled in more ways than that of gun control, and in that sense was trickier to compile. Since several denominations and religious groups covered the issues of both domestic and global poverty, as well as job creation, taxation, budgetary, and debt matters, all under the rubric of “economic justice,” I have done the same.\n\nSometimes, there were so many links that I linked to pages with more links, so as not to overwhelm you with the extensive information.\n\nAs many groups have specific statements about unions and collective bargaining, I’ll have a separate blog on that one issue (almost exactly a year ago, because of the Wisconsin tumult, I wrote an earlier OMG blog on the matter, listing some denominational statements).\n\nAs before, I’ll list religious grouping headings (where there are different “flavors” with the same heading, like with Jews and Lutherans, I will have sub-headings under each grouping), then a quick description of each tradition’s stance on the issue (if found). I’ll then offer a few links to their statements and brief excerpts of the relevant texts.\n\nKeep in mind, I have only listed the official stances as I’ve found them. Within each community, you can be sure that there are a variety of active organizations and voices which disagree with official denominational stances.\n\nSince the last blog, I have written to each denomination to ask for specific links to statements. When one was given, I will use that: when not, I will use the best of my google-sleuthing to identify any statements that more or less seem to be reflective of any official position.\n\nIf there are no clear statements, I will simply write “No official statement,” but am happy to be corrected.\n\nIf there are any further links, clarifications, additions, or corrections, I will gladly update the blog with them. It was a big project and so I fear and yet am sure that there will be a few blips.\n\nThe extent of inter-denominational and inter-religious collaboration about poverty and economic justice was, frankly, both astonishing and heartening.\n\nOne document, signed by many faith leaders, including those from groups which otherwise have no policy statement, received a lot of press, and so I’m highlighting it at the beginning of this blog.\n\nIt’s called the “Circle of Protection,” and was crafted in response to and against the Paul Ryan budget, and any other budget that threatens protection of the poor. Because the document has gained much support, recognition, and respect, I will put “CoP” by any denomination that has an official representative who signed it.\n\nYou can find this piece here, (the link to the organization’s website is here) but the letter itself is both short enough and worthy enough of a full excerpt:\n\n“In the face of historic deficits, the nation faces unavoidable choices about how to balance needs and resources and allocate burdens and sacrifices. These choices are economic, political—and moral.\n\nAs Christians, we believe the moral measure of the debate is how the most poor and vulnerable people fare. We look at every budget proposal from the bottom up—how it treats those Jesus called “the least of these” (Matthew 25:45). They do not have powerful lobbies, but they have the most compelling claim on our consciences and common resources. The Christian community has an obligation to help them be heard, to join with others to insist that programs that serve the most vulnerable in our nation and around the world are protected. We know from our experience serving hungry and homeless people that these programs meet basic human needs and protect the lives and dignity of the most vulnerable. We believe that God is calling us to pray, fast, give alms and to speak out for justice.\n\nAs Christian leaders, we are committed to fiscal responsibility and shared sacrifice. We are also committed to resist budget cuts that undermine the lives, dignity, and rights of poor and vulnerable people. Therefore, we join\n\nwith others to form a Circle of Protection around programs that meet the essential needs of hungry and poor people at home and abroad.\n\nThe nation needs to substantially reduce future deficits, but not at the expense of hungry and poor people.\n\nFunding focused on reducing poverty should not be cut. It should be made as effective as possible, but not cut.\n\nWe urge our leaders to protect and improve poverty-focused development and humanitarian assistance to promote a better, safer world.\n\nNational leaders must review and consider tax revenues, military spending, and entitlements in the search for ways to share sacrifice and cut deficits.\n\nA fundamental task is to create jobs and spur economic growth. Decent jobs at decent wages are the best path out of poverty, and restoring growth is a powerful way to reduce deficits.\n\nThe budget debate has a central moral dimension. Christians are asking how we protect “the least of these.” “What would Jesus cut?” “How do we share sacrifice?”\n\nAs believers, we turn to God with prayer and fasting, to ask for guidance as our nation makes decisions about our priorities as a people.\n\nGod continues to shower our nation and the world with blessings. As Christians, we are rooted in the love of God in Jesus Christ. Our task is to share these blessings with love and justice and with a special priority for those who are poor.”\n\nThe signatories are listed here:\n\nAFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL: Statements, CoP\n\nThe AME does not have a specific statement on economic justice as a broad topic, but rather addresses specific legislation that attends to economic well-being for all.\n\nTwo issues came up quickly: the jobs bill, and the fiscal cliff negotiations.\n\nTo the first, the AME heartily endorsed Pres. Obama’s Jobs Act, saying:\n\n“African-American families and communities are laboring to make ends meet at a time when many American corporations have opted to move their operations to emerging nations, where regulations are loose and where labor is well below what is considered to be a living wage in America. Other corporations that are financially thriving have opted to simply ‘sit’ on their funds rather than offering jobs to American citizens.\n\nThose who vigorously embrace the free market in their political rhetoric should urge their corporate supporters to offer the well paying jobs that feed the engine of the free market. Those who trumpet their religion and co-mingle it with their patriotism and partisan political views should remember the admonition of the historical Jesus to focus not on the well being of the rich and influential, but on the well being of ‘the least of these.’ They must lay aside their stubborn refusal to compromise and remember that the Creator urged us through the Prophet Isaiah to ‘reason together.'”\n\nTo the second, to fiscal cliff negotiations, they have dovetailed statement-efforts with the Methodist Church as their official statement, a statement which reads, in part:\n\n“As you continue efforts to resolve the budget impasse, the General Board of Church & Society of The United Methodist Church urges you to reorder our nation’s fiscal and budget policy to reflect our shared concern for those living in poverty and all those struggling on the economic margins. The real crisis in the United States and around the world is not the so-called “fiscal cliff,” but rather the continued manipulation of God’s economy of abundance into a world where the wants of the few have taken priority over the needs of the many. A moral budget and economy would prioritize the needs of the poor, require more from the wealthiest among us and value true human security over a perpetual warfare state.”\n\nThree headings section of more specific goals, namely that the Congress should “Prioritize the Needs of the Poor,” “Require More from the Wealthiest Amongst Us,” and “Value True Human Security over the Warfare State.”\n\nHouse Members: Terri A.

James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI)\n\nBAPTISTS: (Some CoP)\n\nSouthern Baptists: No official statement.\n\nAmerican Baptists: (CoP) There is an official statement found here. The statement uses the rubric of “industry” more often than “economic,” and so seems to be geared more to private companies and their treatment of its labor force. Still, an excerpt follows here:\n\n“Recognizing in the words of Christ “One is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are brothers,” the abiding charter of democracy and seeing in this the summons to realize the democracy of all life, we believe that this Christian principle applied to industry implies that industry is a social service whose ruling motive should be not the profit of the few, but the welfare of all, and that the service motive must become the dominant spirit in both the methods and processes of industry.”\n\nHouse Members: Robert B.

They encourage their members to advocate for economic justice through Bread for the World (info below) and, in Canada, through Dignity for All.\n\nAdditionally, however, the CRC encourages direct action, action which “address[es] issues of poverty and injustice by exposing problems at their roots.” This link leads people to a long list of ways in which members address poverty and related blights in their own communities and in extended communities.\n\nHouse Member: Bill Huizenga (R-MI)\n\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE:\n\nIn response to my inquiry, I was directed to the following link http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science#social-political-and-global-issues, which says “People who practice Christian Science have diverse opinions. The church takes no official position on social, political, or global issues. One thing Christian Scientists can agree on and feel passionate about is the need to pray about the difficult issues facing our world.”\n\nHouse Member: Lamar Smith (R-TX), Robert W. Goodlatte (R-VA)\n\nCHURCH OF CHRIST: No official statement\n\nHouse Member: Janice Hahn (D-CA), Brett Guthrie (R-KY), Ted Poe (R-TX)\n\nSenate Member: John Cornyn (R-TX)\n\nCONGREGATIONALISTS/UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST: Statements, CoP\n\nFrom their Economic Justice Home Page they write:\n\n“Unemployment, low wages, unsafe jobs, globalization, the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, taxes (who pays and how much), the right to form a union (and why someone might want to), imports from China and closed factories in the U.S. – these are issues of economic justice. And they are very complicated issues.\n\nBut things are a little simpler for people of faith. We measure the economy against one fundamental truth: the earth and all that is in it belong to God (Ps. 24:1). Moreover, God intends that we fully share God’s gifts (Exodus 16: 16-18). But we know that this radical equality is not reflected in the economic realities of our world. Some of us have very little while others have very much.\n\nAs people of faith, before we begin working to change the economic system, we must first discern, as best we can, a vision of God’s will for our society and our economy. For many people, this would be a world where no one is poor, homeless, living in substandard housing, or lacking the nutritious food needed for a healthy life. Everyone who wanted a job would have one.\n\nOnce we have a vision, we can we begin working to put it in place – by lobbying our elected representatives for the needed legislation, standing with striking workers, resisting unfair international trade and investment agreements, sharing our abundance, ensuring the social safety net is sufficient, and taking other actions to make certain that all God’s children receive a fair share of the resources that God provides for us all.”\n\nAnd then the have no fewer than 20 links to issues related to poverty and its eradication, ranging from Social Security to Worker Justice to Race, Ethnicity, and Economic Justice.\n\nHere are links to official pronouncements about Economic Justice, which include the following words: “”…the struggle to achieve economic justice for all of God’s people is an imperative of the Christian faith, a confession that we have done too little to correct the economic injustices of our nation and the world … [and] a statement of our commitment to transform the structures of church and society by working for economic justice.” Describes the “marks of a just economy” including: all people have access to basic material necessities, enhances human dignity, is inclusive, assures equality of opportunity, has preferential option for the poor, honors creation, and promotes international peace and well-being. Commitment to achieving an economic bill of rights including guaranteed national minimum income level, universal health care, full employment, affordable housing, and quality education for all.”\n\nHouse Member: Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), Bill Enyart (D-IL), Fred Upton (R-MI)\n\nSenate Member: Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Max Baucus (D-MT)\n\nEPISCOPALIANS/ANGLICANS: Statements, CoP\n\nIn addition to advocating for direct solutions to poverty and establishing a Network for Economic Justice Advocacy, and creating a thorough issue-bulleted .pdf detailing specific issue papers, the Church also has an extensive list of official resolution after resolution about a wide-variety of poverty-related matters.

In 1973, the URJ urged Congress to expand social programs, and in 1981 opposed efforts to cut funding to education, job training, food subsidies and many other social programs that were in danger of losing some, if not all, of their funding.\n\nJust before the passage of the 1996 welfare reform law, the URJ passed a resolution entitled ‘Our Economic Commitment to America’s Poor.’ This 1995 resolution recognized the importance of prudent fiscal reforms and welfare reform, but asserted that these reforms should not be made on the backs of the most needy. The resolution further asserted that ‘the United States government [must]”ensure an adequate, federally guaranteed safety net to protect our nation’s most vulnerable populations.’ Any legislation that does not meet the above standard should not be passed by Congress or signed into law by the President.”\n\nAlso under this link, further links of advocacy crafted by groups under the Reformed umbrella can be found, including those provided by the Women of Reform Judaism, the Union for Reform Judaism, and the Central Conference of Reformed Rabbis. There are several worthwhile links to be found under each group, and I encourage you to click as many as you can.\n\nAdditionally, the Reform Tradition encourages economic justice advocacy here.\n\nOrthodox Jews: No official statement.\n\nPAN-JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS\n\nB’nai B’rith: No official statement.\n\nThe Jewish Council for Public Affairs: Statements\n\nIn addition to a regular journal dedicated to covering issues of poverty, it advocates for economic justice in a number of ways, including dealing specifically with the plight of elderly citizens, usury, and reform of the federal poverty measure, along with broader measures to curb poverty suffered by a number of groups.\n\nHouse Members: Susan A.

Schumer (D-NY), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\nLUTHERANS:\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA): Statements, CoP\n\nIn this statement from 1999, the ELCA stated :\n\n“An economy (oikonomia or “management of the household”) is meant to meet people’s material needs. The current market-based economy does that to an amazing degree; many are prospering as never before. At the same time, others continue to lack what they need for basic subsistence. Out of deep concern for those affected adversely, we of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America here assess economic life today in light of the moral imperative to seek sufficient, sustainable livelihood for all.“\n\nCulled from each of these three headings (sufficient, sustainable, livelihood), and additional concerns, the ELCA calls for the following bulleted items:\n\nscrutiny of how specific policies and practices affect people and nations that are the poorest, and changes to make policies of economic growth, trade, and investment more beneficial to those who are poor;\n\nefforts to increase the participation of low-income people in political and civic life, and citizen vigilance and action that challenges governments and other sectors when they become captive to narrow economic interests that do not represent the good of all;\n\nshifts throughout the world from military expenditures to purposes that serve the needs of low-income people;\n\nsupport for family planning and enhanced opportunities for women so that population pressures might be eased; [7]\n\nreduction of overwhelming international debt burdens in ways that do not impose further deprivations on the poor, and cancellation of some or all debt where severe indebtedness immobilizes a country’s economy;\n\ninvestments, loan funds, hiring practices, skill training, and funding of micro-enterprises and other community development projects that can empower low-income people economically.\n\npolicies that promote stable families, strong schools, and safe neighborhoods;\n\naddressing the barriers individuals face in preparing for and sustaining a livelihood (such as lack of education, transportation, child care, and health care).\n\npublic and private sector partnerships to create jobs and job retention programs;\n\nnational economic policies that support and advance the goal of low unemployment.\n\nother employers to engage in similar practices [hiring without discrimination; compensating fairly; providing adequate benefits; ownership in decision-making; and freedom to engage in unions and collective bargaining];\n\ngovernment enforcement of regulations against discrimination, exploitative work conditions and labor practices (including child labor), and for the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively;\n\npublic policies that ensure adequate social security, unemployment insurance, and health care coverage;\n\na minimum wage level that balances employees’ need for sufficient income with what would be significant negative effects on overall employment;\n\ntax credits and other means of supplementing the insufficient income of low-paid workers in order to move them out of poverty.\n\ngovernment to provide adequate income assistance and related services for citizens, documented immigrants, and refugees who are unable to provide for their livelihood through employment;\n\nadequate, consistent public funding for the various low-income services non-profit organizations provide for the common good of all;\n\nscrutiny to ensure that new ways of providing low-income people with assistance and services (such as through the private sector) do not sacrifice the most vulnerable for the sake of economic efficiency and profit;\n\ncorrection of regressive tax systems, so that people are taxed progressively in relation to their ability to pay;\n\nopposition to lotteries and other state-sponsored gambling because of how these regressive means of raising state revenues adversely affect those who are poor.[10]\n\nToo much: Because most of us in the United States have far more than we need, we can easily fall into bondage to what we have. We then become like the young man Jesus encountered, whose bondage to his possessions kept him from following Jesus (Matthew 19:16-22; Mark 10:17-22; Luke 18:18-25).\n\ncorporate policies that lessen the disparities between compensations of top corporate executives and that of the workers throughout an organization;\n\ncorporate governance that is accountable for the effects of a company’s practices on workers, communities, and the environment here and throughout the world;\n\nscrutiny of the tax breaks, subsidies, and incentives many companies receive, to assure that they serve the common good;\n\nenforcement of laws to prevent the exercise of inordinate market power by large corporations;\n\nappropriate government regulatory reform so that governments can monitor private sector practices more effectively and efficiently in an ever-changing global economy.\n\nappropriate policies and regulations that help reverse environmental destruction;\n\nplanning that accounts for the impact of regional growth on communities and ecosystems;\n\nending subsidies for economic activities that use up non-renewable natural resources;\n\ncompanies to pay more fully for the wider social and environmental costs of what they produce;\n\nthe development and use of more energy-efficient technologies.\n\nchanges to assure that farmers will receive a greater proportion of the retail food dollar;\n\nadequate prices for agricultural products so that farmers can be compensated fairly for their labor and production costs;\n\nsustainable agricultural practices that protect and restore the regenerative capacities of the land, rather than practices that deplete the land (for example, by measuring productivity only by short-term agricultural yields);\n\nmore just work conditions for farm workers, especially immigrants, and opportunities for them to acquire their own land;\n\ngreater entry-level opportunities for the next generation of family farmers.\n\nsupport of the above strategies by governments, financial institutions, and the wider society;\n\nalternatives to gambling as a means of community economic development;\n\ngrants and low-interest loans that enable small companies and farms to get started, develop, and expand in order to provide livelihood for more people in low-income communities.\n\nHouse Members: Lois Capps (D-CA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Tom Letham (R-IA), Chellie Pingree (D-ME), Collin C.

Rather, the LCMS encourages its members to follow their own individual consciences in supporting candidates, legislation and social and political efforts which/whom they believe would help to create a better and safer society.\n\nFor more information, see the various reports of the Synod’s Commission on Theology and Church Relations on “Social/Ethical Issues,” which are available on the Web site of the CTCR (www.lcms.org/ctcr).”\n\nHouse Members: Cory Gardner (R-CO), John Shimkus (R-IL), Larry Buschon (R-IN), Erik Paulsen (R-MN), Dave Reichert (R-WA), Cynthia M.

At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’ But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.’ New International Version (NIV)”\n\nMETHODISTS: Statements, CoP\n\nAt the United Methodist Building in DC, they’ve had a banner flowing with “cliff notes” for Congress to see, with three points:\n\nProtect the poor,\n\nCreate good jobs for all, and\n\nEnd the warfare state.\n\nThese points were summarized also in a letter to Pres. Obama and Congress, found here. It begins:\n\n“As you continue efforts to resolve the budget impasse, the General Board of Church & Society of The United Methodist Church urges you to reorder our nation’s fiscal and budget policy to reflect our shared concern for those living in poverty and all those struggling on the economic margins. The real crisis in the United States and around the world is not the so-called “fiscal cliff,” but rather the continued manipulation of God’s economy of abundance into a world where the wants of the few have taken priority over the needs of the many. A moral budget and economy would prioritize the needs of the poor, require more from the wealthiest among us and value true human security over a perpetual warfare state.”\n\nThis link connects you to several further economic statements concerning the budget, taxes, gambling, living wages, and hunger.\n\nThe UMC makes a claim here that I have not discovered as boldly stated on any other religious group’s site [italics mine]:\n\n“Therefore, we do not hold poor people morally responsible for their economic state. To begin to alleviate poverty, we support such policies as: adequate income maintenance, quality education, decent housing, job training, meaningful employment opportunities, adequate medical and hospital care, and humanization and radical revisions of welfare programs.\n\nSince low wages are often a cause of poverty, employers should pay their employees a wage that does not require them to depend upon government subsidies such as food stamps or welfare for their livelihood.\n\nHouse Members: Tom Cotton (R-AR), Doris Matsui (D-CA), Mark Takano (D-CA), Mike Coffman (R-CO), Jeff Miller (R-FL), Rich Nugent (R-FL), Bill Posey (R-FL), C.W.

This pan-Islamic organization represents many of the Islamic voices in the United States, and can be considered to be the most comprehensive source of statements from Muslims in the U.S.\n\nRegarding poverty, the ISNA has partnered with Fighting Poverty with Faith, an inter-religious group that addresses poverty by way of its root causes, stating “We enlist the moral authority and organizing power of the faith community to ensure meeting the needs of those living in poverty is a national priority. This mobilization utilizes the strength of the coordinated faith community to move individuals and communities to action and advocate for clear, immediate policy solutions to address the root causes of poverty.” Its goal is to cut domestic poverty in half by 2020.\n\nThis is but one expression of the organizations advocacy on behalf of the poor. One more link from July 2011 demonstrates the deep concern regarding the governmental threatened cuts to poverty assistance programs. Says, Dr. Sayyid M. Syeed, ISNA National Director of Interfaith and Community Alliances, “It is our religious duty as part of the faith communities to convey our concerns about the problems of the budget cuts that will directly impact low income individuals and the dispossessed. We are asking for a budget that should be just and equitable. It is our Islamic duty because this is one of the pillars of Islam.”\n\nHouse Members: Andre Carson (D-IN), Keith Ellison (D-MN)\n\nCHURCH OF THE NAZARENES: Statement\n\nAlthough there is no statement about political advocacy, the web site for the Church of the Nazarenes states the following:\n\nThe Church of the Nazarene believes that Jesus commanded His disciples to have a special relationship to the poor of this world; that Christ’s Church ought, first, to keep itself simple and free from an emphasis on wealth and extravagance and, second, to give itself to the care, feeding, clothing, and shelter of the poor. Throughout the Bible and in the life and example of Jesus, God identifies with and assists the poor, the oppressed, and those in society who cannot speak for themselves. In the same way, we, too, are called to identify with and to enter into solidarity with the poor and not simply to offer charity from positions of comfort. We hold that compassionate ministry to the poor includes acts of charity as well as a struggle to provide opportunity, equality, and justice for the poor. We further believe that the Christian responsibility to the poor is an essential aspect of the life of every believer who seeks a faith that works through love.\n\nFinally, we understand Christian holiness to be inseparable from ministry to the poor in that it drives the Christian beyond his or her own individual perfection and toward the creation of a more just and equitable society and world. Holiness, far from distancing believers from the desperate economic needs of people in our world, motivates us to place our means in the service of alleviating such need and to adjust our wants in accordance with the needs of others.

Following are a few excerpts:\n\n“In summary, these two principles, (1) economic justice for all (the establishment of economic conditions that support the human flourishing of all), and (2) sustainability (the establishment of conditions of economic justice today that will not destroy the earth’s capacity to provide abundant life to future generations), remain the basis of the biblical and Reformed imperative to promote social righteousness in economic matters.21 They remain the plumb lines against which economic practices in the 21st century must be judged. They are the product of a way of thinking about God, neighbor, self, and all of creation derived from Reformed beliefs and values that refute many economic assumptions and practices commonly accepted by our society today.”\n\nThis document details a Reformed view of the causes of and the responsibilities in the face of poverty.\n\nAdditionally, the PCUSA has a site for more specific means of advocacy, and that can be found here. Highlighted on that site’s home page is a quote from the Confessions, which reads “…A church that is indifferent to poverty, or evades responsibility in economic affairs, or is open to one social class only… makes a mockery of reconciliation and offers no acceptable worship to God…”\n\nHouse Members: Martha Roby (R-AL), John Campbell (R-CA), Jeff Denhham (R-CA), Diana DeGette (D-CO), Jime Himes (D-CT), Kathy Castor (D-FL), Dennis Ross (R-FL), Tom Price (R-GA), Luke Messer (R-IN), Bruce Braley (D-IA), Mike Pompeo (R-KS), Candice S.

Below are just a few links to demonstrate the denomination’s historical advocacy for the poor:\n\nRecently, this letter to Representatives and Senators received much publicity, heightened because Speaker John Boehner is Roman Catholic. An excerpt is here:\n\n“As Catholic bishops, we have tried to remind Congress that these choices are economic, political, and moral. We offer the following moral criteria to guide difficult budgetary choices:\n\nEvery budget decision should be assessed by whether it protects or threatens human life and dignity.\n\nA central moral measure of any budget proposal is how it affects “the least of these” (Matthew 25). The needs of those who are hungry and homeless, without work or in poverty should come first.\n\nGovernment and other institutions have a shared responsibility to promote the common good of all,especially ordinary workers and families who struggle to live in dignity in difficult economic times.\n\nAs you craft and debate a budget resolution and spending bills for Fiscal Year 2013, we hope these criteria will shape your choices. They will guide our assessment of the various proposals. We join with other Christian leaders in calling for a “circle of protection” around our brothers and sisters at home and abroad who are poor and vulnerable.\n\nThe Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church teaches: “Just, efficient and effective public financing will … encourage employment growth, … sustain business and non-profit activities” and help guarantee “systems of social insurance and protection that are designed above all to protect the weakest members of society.” We do not offer a detailed critique of entire budget proposals, but we ask you to consider the human and moral dimensions of these choices.\n\nOur nation has an obligation to address the impact of future deficits on the health of the economy, to ensure stability and security for future generations, and to use limited resources efficiently and effectively. A just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons; it requires shared sacrifice by all, including raising adequate revenues, eliminating unnecessary military and other spending, and addressing the long-term costs of health insurance and retirement programs fairly.”\n\nHere and here are pages dedicated to information about and advocacy in response to poverty.\n\nHouse Members: Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Raul M.

Feelings of hopelessness, alienation, envy and resentment often lead to antisocial attitudes and behavior. Then society is left to pay for the after-effects of such ills through its courts, prisons, and welfare systems. Poverty and misfortune as such do not cause crime and provide no excuse for it. But when the claims of compassion are denied, discouragement, and even resentment are likely to follow.\n\nThe claims upon the Christian’s compassion are not ill-founded. They do not spring from any legal or even social contract theory, but from the clear teaching of scripture: “He has showed you, O man, what is good: and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” (Micah 7:8 RSV)\n\nThe fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah is precious to Seventh-day Adventists. We see our responsibility in this chapter as those raised up to be “The repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in” (verse 12).\n\nThe call is to restore and “to loose the bands of wickedness … to deal thy bread to the hungry … bring the poor that are cast out to thy house … when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him” (verses 6, 7). So as repairers of the breach, we are to restore and care for the poor. If we carry out the principles of the law of God in acts of mercy and love, we will represent the character of God to the world.”\n\nHouse Members: Raul Ruiz (D-CA), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX)\n\nUNITARIANS: Statements\n\nThe Unitarians have a tradition of advocacy on behalf of the poor, but seems to focus most of it by way of workers’ rights. Further efforts can be linked to here.\n\nHouse Members: Ami Bera (D-CA)\n\nUNITED BRETHREN: Statement\n\nHere, the United Brethren have a brief statement under the rubric of Human Relations, which speaks to their hope for economic parity.\n\n“The church respects human personality which is inherent in every race, nation and creed. We believe in the Bible’s instruction that there is no basis whatsoever for a belief in the superiority or inferiority of any people. Therefore, the church protests against any action or practice that produces discrimination based upon racial, national, creedal or social differences, since God “made from one, every nation of men to live on the face of the earth” (Acts 17:26). The church admonishes all members to commit their attitudes, actions and influences in faithful witness to this truth and to oppose every influence, whether it be economic, social, moral or religious which would debase, impair, or bring into bondage those whom God has created in his own likeness.\n\nThe church believes that there must be equal rights and justice for all. All members should register their concern and opposition to any form of prejudice that would prevent any individual or ethnic group from free and full participation in the privileges and benefits of our society. We advocate through due process of law and within the framework of the democratic system the elimination of poverty; the abolishment of unemployment; a fair wage in very vocation; fair practices between employer and employees; adequate provisions for the aged and for those who are unemployable; the opportunity for decent housing for all; and a proper concern for total human need in our contemporary world.”\n\nHouse Member: Scott Perry (R-PA)\n\nUNITED CHURCH OF GOD: No official statement\n\nSenate Member: Joe Tester (D-MT)\n\nNON-DENOMINATIONAL OR CHRISTIANS WITH NO STATED DENOMINATIONAL AFFILIATION:\n\nRepresentatives: Mo Brooks (R-AL); Ken Calvert (R-CA), Tony Cardenas (D-CA), John Garamendi (D-CA), Michael M.

By changing policies, programs and conditions that allow hunger and poverty to persist, we provide help and opportunity far beyond the communities where we live.”\n\nChristian Churches Together, an interdenominational group, established a Domestic Poverty Initiative which provides collaborate resources for many denominations to fight poverty.\n\nAs Christians, we believe the moral measure of the debate is how the most poor and vulnerable people fare. We look at every budget proposal from the bottom up—how it treats those Jesus called “the least of these” (Matthew 25:45). They do not have powerful lobbies, but they have the most compelling claim on our consciences and common resources. The Christian community has an obligation to help them be heard, to join with others to insist that programs that serve the most vulnerable in our nation and around the world are protected. We know from our experience serving hungry and homeless people that these programs meet basic human needs and protect the lives and dignity of the most vulnerable. We believe that God is calling us to pray, fast, give alms and to speak out for justice.\n\nAs Christian leaders, we are committed to fiscal responsibility and shared sacrifice. We are also committed to resist budget cuts that undermine the lives, dignity, and rights of poor and vulnerable people. Therefore, we join with others to form a Circle of Protection around programs that meet the essential needs of hungry and poor people at home and abroad.\n\nThe nation needs to substantially reduce future deficits, but not at the expense of hungry and poor people.\n\nFunding focused on reducing poverty should not be cut. It should be made as effective as possible, but not cut.\n\nWe urge our leaders to protect and improve poverty-focused development and humanitarian assistance to promote a better, safer world.\n\nNational leaders must review and consider tax revenues, military spending, and entitlements in the search for ways to share sacrifice and cut deficits.\n\nA fundamental task is to create jobs and spur economic growth. Decent jobs at decent wages are the best path out of poverty, and restoring growth is a powerful way to reduce deficits.\n\nThe budget debate has a central moral dimension. Christians are asking how we protect “the least of these.” “What would Jesus cut?” “How do we share sacrifice?”\n\nAs believers, we turn to God with prayer and fasting, to ask for guidance as our nation makes decisions about our priorities as a people.\n\nGod continues to shower our nation and the world with blessings. As Christians, we are rooted in the love of God in Jesus Christ. Our task is to share these blessings with love and justice and with a special priority for those who are poor.\n\nBudgets are moral documents, and how we reduce future deficits are historic and defining moral choices. As Christian leaders, we urge Congress and the administration to give moral priority to programs that protect the life and dignity of poor and vulnerable people in these difficult times, our broken economy, and our wounded world. It is the vocation and obligation of the church to speak and act on behalf of those Jesus called “the least of these.” This is our calling, and we will strive to be faithful in carrying out this mission.\n\nBudgets are moral documents, and how we reduce future deficits are historic and defining moral choices.
