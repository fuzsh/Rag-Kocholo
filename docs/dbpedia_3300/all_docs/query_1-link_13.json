        "text": "WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators John Boozman and Tom Cotton congratulate Robert Christian Parker of Fort Smith and Shreya Majagi of Rogers on being selected as delegates for the United States Senate Youth Program (USSYP). Parker and Majagi were chosen from hundreds of applicants across Arkansas to attend the 55th annual Washington Week March 4-11.\n\n“These students are excellent representatives for Arkansas. This is a great opportunity for them to experience how policies and law are created first-hand. I am proud of their accomplishment and hope this program will help shape their interest in civic involvement,” Boozman said.\n\n“I look forward to welcoming Robert and Shreya to Washington this spring as they represent Arkansas in this year's U.S. Senate Youth Program. They’ve both demonstrated tremendous dedication to their academics and their communities and I know they will benefit immensely from this program,” Cotton said.\n\nRobert (Christian) Parker attends Southside High School and serves as the Student Body president. He has also attended Boys State and is a member of National Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta, the Arkansas all-region and all-state bands, Future Business Leaders of America, Key Club, the German National Honor Society and National Business Honor Society. He volunteers for the Salvation Army, Angel Tree, the First United Methodist church, the local animal shelter, county clean-up, Next Step Day Room food kitchen and the Children’s Emergency Shelter. Christian founded and maintains a rock band named Carrier, and intends to further his passion for political science and economics in college and law school.\n\nShreya Majagi attends Rogers High School and serves as the National Honor Society president. Shreya is also the president of Regions Student Bankboard and Model United Nations. She is a Teen Council representative for the Crystal Bridges Museum, and served on the Mayor’s Youth Council. She is a student senate representative and attended Arkansas Governor’s School. Shreya is also president of Future Business Leaders of America and the highest ranked tennis singles player at her school. Her volunteer activities include working with Rogers and Bentonville libraries, the Rogers Teen Action Support Center, giving free saxophone lessons, and initiating food drives. Shreya plans to major in a field where she can focus on public service.\n\nSean Fitzgerald, a resident of Hensley, who attends Sheridan High School and Jacob Morrow, a resident of Cave Springs, who attends Bentonville High School were selected as alternates to the 2017 program.\n\nWhile in Washington, Cunningham and DeWitt will join other student delegates in meetings with the president, Members of Congress, a Supreme Court Justice, leaders of cabinet agencies, an ambassador to the United States and senior members of the national media. The students will also tour many of the national monuments and several museums.\n\nUSSYP allows two delegates, current high school seniors or juniors, from each state to be selected by the state’s chief education officer in cooperation with high school principals. In addition to outstanding leadership abilities and a strong commitment to public service, the students rank academically in the top one percent of their states."
