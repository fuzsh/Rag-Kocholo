        "text": "The Arkansas FAITH Network is a collaboration of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and faith-based organizations. They work to deliver health programs and health education to faith communities across the state.\n\nProject Summary\n\nArkansas ranks 48th in the nation for overall health status and ability to access health care. These poor health rankings highlight the need for innovative and non-traditional approaches, such as engaging the faith community, to improve access to care and health outcomes among Arkansans. Though UAMS has a lengthy history of engaging the faith community, only a few faith leaders have the capacity to engage in research. Overall, faith leaders are seldom approached about engaging in research and when they are, minimal training is available to them. Training is needed to build skills and knowledge to enable them to be equitable partners in research. In addition, only a minute number of faith leaders have the knowledge and capacity to serve as community principal investigators and consultants. This is leading to over-extension of faith community partners, which may lead to burnout. Currently, there is not an infrastructure in place that supports large-scale dissemination of health education and health promotion programs or the capacity to train faith-based organizations to participate as equal partners in research. Without this necessary infrastructure, the reach and sustainability of these novel health programs is severely limited.\n\nTeam\n\nThe team consists of Keneshia Bryant-Moore, Ph.D., R.N., associate professor; and Tiffany Haynes, Ph.D., assistant professor. The other members are Joy Rockenbach, faith-based coordinator at the Arkansas Department of Health, and Rev. William Givens, minister of Christian education, St. John Baptist Church.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe development of the Arkansas Faith-Academic Initiatives for Transforming Health (FAITH) Network. The FAITH Network will be a collaboration between University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and faith organizations in Arkansas to provide an infrastructure that supports faith-based research.\n\nBuilding the faith community’s capacity to engage in partnered comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) by providing continuous training opportunities specific to the needs of the faith community. This will also provide an opportunity for faith leaders to build upon the concept of “community-building-community.” This is when faith leaders with PCOR experience serve as mentors and advisors to those faith leaders who are new to PCOR.\n\nDocumenting and disseminating the outcomes of the Arkansas FAITH Network and training using both process and summative evaluation. In an effort to ensure the community is engaged and diversely represented, a community advisory board (CAB) will play a key role in the development of the FAITH Network and its programming. The CAB will include members of the faith community who have served in various roles in PCOR or have expressed interest. The FAITH Network will provide ongoing engaged research/PCOR training and partnership development throughout the state.\n\nFAITH Network Lunch and Learn\n\nJuly 13, 2022 How to Lead Change by Participating in Research: Hayman and Standerfer\n\nJuly 7, 2022 W.O.W Lifestyle\n\nApril 27, 2022: Center for Childhood Obesity Prevention Community Engagement Core\n\nMarch 9, 2022: Health Equity and Maternal Health: The Health Plan Perspective\n\nJan 27, 2021: Informed Decision Making and the Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines\n\nAug. 24, 2020: Understanding COVID-10 Related Stigma\n\nMay 8, 2020: The FAITH Community’s Response to COVID-19: Preparing for the New Normal\n\nFaith Network Documentary\n\nOct. 7, 2021: The Faith Community’s Response to COVID-19 in Arkansas"
