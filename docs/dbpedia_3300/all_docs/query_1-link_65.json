        "text": "American politician (born 1957)\n\nFor the reality show contestant Stephen Bradley Womack, see Brad Womack.\n\nStephen Allen Womack[1] ( WOH-mack; born February 18, 1957) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Arkansas's 3rd congressional district since 2011. The district, which was once represented by former Senator J. William Fulbright, covers much of northwestern Arkansas, including Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Springdale, and Womack's hometown of Rogers. A member of the Republican Party, Womack was mayor of Rogers before his election to Congress.\n\nWomack chaired the House Budget Committee from 2018 to 2019, and was its ranking member from 2019 to 2021.\n\nEarly life, education, military service, and business career\n\n[edit]\n\nWomack was born in Russellville, Arkansas, the son of Elisabeth F. (Canerday) and James Kermit Womack.[2] Womack's father founded KURM-AM in 1979, a radio station serving the Fayetteville, Arkansas area. He spent most of his childhood in Moberly, Missouri, but moved back to Russellville at age 16 and graduated from Russellville High School in 1975. He graduated with a B.A. in communications from Arkansas Tech University in 1979. Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the Arkansas Army National Guard. He served for 30 years, retiring in 2009 as a colonel.[3] He simultaneously served as station manager for KURM (AM) from 1979 to 1990.\n\nWomack served in a variety of command and staff positions with the Arkansas Army National Guard, including platoon leader, troop commander, battalion commander, and regimental commander.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Womack's unit, the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment of Arkansas 39th Infantry Brigade, was called to active duty for service with the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai, Egypt. His task force was trained at Fort Carson, Colorado, and deployed overseas in January 2002. On 13 January 2002, TF 2-153 became the first pure National Guard unit to receive the mission as the United States Battalion (US BATT) in the MFO. It also marked the first time in the 35-year history of the 39th Brigade that a battalion was mobilized for overseas duty.\n\nHis military decorations include:\n\nLegion of Merit\n\nMeritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster\n\nArmy Commendation Medal\n\nArmy Achievement Medal\n\nGlobal War on Terror Expeditionary and Service Medals\n\nOn October 31, 2009, Womack retired with over 30 years of service from the Arkansas Army National Guard at the rank of colonel. Before his retirement, he commanded the 233rd Regiment, Arkansas Regional Training Institute.[4]\n\nFrom 1990 to 1996, Womack served as an executive officer for the United States Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps. From 1996 to 1998, he worked as a financial consultant for Merrill Lynch & Co.[5]\n\nMayor of Rogers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1998, Womack was elected mayor of Rogers, holding the post for 12 years.\n\nWomack was reelected unopposed in 2002 and 2006, holding the office until he ran for Congress in 2010[6]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\n2010\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Representative John Boozman announced that he would run for the United States Senate. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed that whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next representative. Womack ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote.[7] In the June runoff, he defeated state Senator and fellow Rogers resident Cecile Bledsoe, 52%-48%.[8]\n\nIn the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.[9]\n\n2012\n\n[edit]\n\nWomack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his reelection bid, but Aden withdrew from the race on July 8, after admitting to exaggerating his military record. As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November.[10] He was reelected with 76% of the vote, defeating Rebekah Kennedy (Green Party of the United States, 16%) and David Pangrac (Libertarian Party (United States), 8%).[11]\n\n2014\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas Brewer, a math teacher and minister, originally announced he was challenging Womack for the Republican nomination,[12] and Troy Gittings, a high school English teacher and stand-up comedian, had announced he was running for the Democratic nomination.[12] But neither Brewer nor Gittings ended up filing, leaving Libertarian Grant Brand as Womack's only challenger.[13] He was reelected with 79% of the vote to Brand's 21%.[14]\n\n2016\n\n[edit]\n\nWomack again faced no Democratic candidate in the general election. He defeated Libertarian Steve Isaacson 77%-23%.[15]\n\n2018\n\n[edit]\n\nWomack faced a Republican primary challenge from Robb Ryerse, a self-described \"progressive Republican.\"[16] He defeated Ryerse, 84%-16%.[17]\n\nIn the general election, Womack faced Democratic opposition for the first time as an incumbent. Womack defeated Josh Mahoney, president of the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund and former chairman of the Fayetteville Airport Commission, and Libertarian Michael Kalagias, on election day, 65%-33%-2%, his smallest margin of victory to date.[18]\n\n2020\n\n[edit]\n\nWomack did not face a challenge in the Republican primary, and he defeated the Democratic nominee, nurse practitioner Celeste Williams, and Kalagias, 64%-32%-4%.[19]\n\n2022\n\n[edit]\n\nWomack won reelection against Democratic nominee, Lauren Mallett-Hays, and Kalagias, with 63.7% to 32.9% and 3.4%.[20]\n\n2024\n\n[edit]\n\nWomack faced a primary challenge from state senator Clint Penzo. Womack narrowly defeated Penzo, receiving 54%.\n\nTenure\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, Womack signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.[21]\n\nWomack was a member of the House Appropriations Committee when in 2014[22] lawmakers inserted a prohibition into an appropriations bill that would prevent USDA staff from working on finishing regulations related to the meat industry.[23]\n\nIn a 2015 episode of his show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, John Oliver criticized Womack for blocking the enforcement of laws proposed by the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration that were designed to protect chicken farmers from being threatened or punished by the companies they work for if they spoke out regarding their farming experiences.[24]\n\nIn 2015, Womack condemned the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.[25]\n\nIn December 2017, Womack voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[26][27][28]\n\nWomack did not join the majority of Republican members of Congress who signed an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. Womack voted to certify both Arizona's and Pennsylvania's results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count. On May 19, 2021, Womack was one of 35 Republicans to join all 217 Democrats present in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.[29][30][31]\n\nOn November 30, Womack voted in favor of H.R. 550: Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2021. The bill helps create confidential, population-based databases that maintain a record of vaccine administrations.[32]\n\nAs of October 2021, Womack had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 15% of the time.[33]\n\nIn 2022, Womack was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.[34][35]\n\nA staunch Kevin McCarthy ally, in the October 2023 Speaker of the House election, Womack along with over 20 of his Republican colleagues voted for Steve Scalise in protest over Jim Jordan for the first three ballots before voting for Mike Johnson in the fourth and final ballot.[36]\n\nCommittee assignments\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the 118th Congress:[37]\n\nCommittee on Appropriations\n\nSubcommittee on Defense\n\nSubcommittee on Financial Services and General Government\n\nSubcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (Chair)\n\nCaucus memberships\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Congressional International Conservation Caucus[38]\n\nRepublican Governance Group[39]\n\nHouse Republican Conference[1]\n\nHouse Republican Steering Committee[1]\n\nHouse Republican Policy Committee[1]\n\nPolitical positions\n\n[edit]\n\nAbortion\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned, Womack declared \"life wins\", saying, \"This decision rightfully restores the American people's ability to protect babies and recognizes the science-backed truths of the humanity of the unborn.\"[40]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWomack attends Cross Church Pinnacle Hills, a Southern Baptist church in Rogers, Arkansas.[41] He and his wife, Terri, have been married since August 4, 1984. They have three sons and three grandsons.[42]\n\nElectoral history\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Office District Democratic Republican Libertarian Other 2010 U.S. House of Representatives Arkansas's 3rd district David Whitaker 27.56% Steve Womack 72.44% 2012 U.S. House of Representatives Arkansas's 3rd district Steve Womack 75.9% David Pangrac 8.09% Rebekah Kennedy (G) 16.01% 2014 U.S. House of Representatives Arkansas's 3rd district Steve Womack 79.41% Grant Brand 20.59% 2016 U.S. House of Representatives Arkansas's 3rd district Steve Womack 77.31% Steve Isaacson 22.69% 2018 U.S. House of Representatives Arkansas's 3rd district Joshua Mahony 32.65% Steve Womack 64.78% Michael Kalagias 2.57% 2020 U.S. House of Representatives Arkansas's 3rd district Celeste Williams 31.81% Steve Womack 64.31% Michael Kalagias 3.88% 2022 U.S. House of Representatives Arkansas's 3rd district Lauren Mallett-Hays 32.89% Steve Womack 63.69% Michael Kalagias 3.42%\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCongressman Steve Womack official U.S. House website\n\nSteve Womack for Congress\n\nSteve Womack at Curlie\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\n\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\n\nProfile at Vote Smart\n\nAppearances on C-SPAN"
