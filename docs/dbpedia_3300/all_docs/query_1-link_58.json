        "text": "by Jorge Gomez • 2 min read\n\nPew Research Center recently published its biannual report on the religious composition of Congress.\n\nHere are four takeaways you must know about religion within the Legislative Branch:\n\nCongress Predominantly Identifies as Christian\n\n88% of Congressional members self-identify as Christian, with most (57%) saying they are Protestant. The new Congress has 148 Catholics, 10 fewer than the previous. Still, Catholics make up about 28% of the members of Congress, a greater share than in the U.S. population overall (21%).\n\nHouse Has Slightly Higher Proportion of Christians than Senate\n\nChristians comprise a majority in both the House and Senate, with each chamber having a similar majority (57% in the House, 56% in the Senate). Looking at minority religions, Jews have a wider presence in the Senate (9%) than in the House (6%).\n\nNotable Differences by Party\n\nMost Republicans and Democrats in Congress identify as Christian, but there’s substantial gap between the two parties. Almost all congressional Republicans—268 out of 271, or 99%—describe themselves as Christians. However, about three-quarters of Democrats—201 out of 263, or 76%—say they are Christian.\n\nDemocrats in Congress also are much less likely than Republicans to identify as Protestant (44% vs. 69%), but a greater share of Democrats than Republicans are Catholic (31% vs. 25%). Nine Democrats identify as Jewish, compared to only two Republicans.\n\nRoughly Equal Shares of Newcomers and Incumbents Identify as Christians\n\nApproximately 88% of incumbents and new members of Congress say they are Christian. However, newcomers to Congress are substantially more likely than returning members to identify as Protestant: Nearly two-thirds of freshmen (64%) are Protestants, compared with 55% of incumbents. The same proportion of freshmen and incumbents (6%) identify as Jewish.\n\n— — — — —\n\nWhat About Your Elected Representatives?\n\nYou can use the map below to easily find the religious affiliation of all congressional representatives—including those members that represent you and your state!"
