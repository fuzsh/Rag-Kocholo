        "text": "When President John F. Kennedy was running for president in 1960, he had to overcome some voters’ distrust of him being a Catholic.\n\n60 years later, the new U.S. president, Joe Biden, is Catholic and his religion was never a campaign issue. So is Speaker Nancy Pelosi. According to Roll Call, 29% of the incoming Congress is Catholic, compared to 20% of the general population. Six of the nine Supreme Court justices are Catholics, including the newest, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. A seventh, Justice Neil Gorsuch, was raised Catholic but now attends an Episcopal church.\n\nThat means Catholics are leading two of the three branches of government at the federal level and lead half of the third. The new Senate majority leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) is Jewish, as are the other two Supreme Court justices, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan.\n\nWhy is this happening? Dr. Hal Bass, professor emeritus of political science at Ouachita Baptist University, said one factor is the growth in the number of Hispanic Americans, who tend to be Catholics and Democrats. Another is the fact that the Catholic Church has long emphasized intellectual scholarship in its institutions, which helps create the pipeline for Supreme Court justices and lower court judges from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nBass said part of the story is the fact that Americans now divide themselves along ideological lines rather than religious ones. When Kennedy ran for president in 1960, Southern Baptists distrusted him because of his religion. But today it would be more about his politics. These days, politically like-minded Catholics and Protestants are more aligned with each other than they are with people who share their branch of Christianity but have opposing political beliefs.\n\nIn Arkansas, Catholics compose 8% of the state’s population. One of the state’s six members of Congress, Rep. French Hill, is Catholic, as are at least eight of the 135 state legislators, according to the Arkansas Legislature’s website. (The affiliations of 18 legislators, most of them newly elected ones with limited biographical information, are not listed. Another 10 are listed as “Christian,” “Independent Christian” or “Protestant.”) Half of the eight Catholics in the legislature are Democrats and half are Republicans.\n\nMeanwhile, Arkansas is a state with a lot of Baptists and a lot more Baptist-elected officials.\n\nAbout 25% of the state’s adults are Baptist, with Southern Baptists composing 17% according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nMeanwhile, four of the state’s six members of Congress — Sen. John Boozman and Reps. Rick Crawford, Steve Womack and Bruce Westerman — are Baptists, as are Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge was raised Methodist but now attends the Church at Rock Creek, a Baptist church. At least 52 of the 135 state legislators are Baptists, including Speaker of the House Matthew Shepherd (R-El Dorado) and Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey (R-Texarkana).\n\nNo other religious affiliation comes close. Methodists are the second most represented denomination in Arkansas politics at the state level. Sen. Tom Cotton is a Methodist, as are 14 state legislators – six of them Democrats. 11 legislators are members of the Church of Christ.\n\nThe other legislators are divided among other affiliations. As examples, three are members of the Assemblies of God, two are Lutherans and two are Mormons.\n\nI guess an interesting question to answer would be, why are there more Catholic-elected officials nationally than there are Catholics, and why are there more Baptist-elected officials in Arkansas than there are Baptists in Arkansas? And could some of the reasons be similar?\n\nMaybe many voters still want candidates to be affiliated with something, even if the voters are not. Maybe candidates win more races when they are members of big denominations. And, it must be said, some winning candidates probably choose to affiliate with big denominations for political reasons. This column has been about religion, but religion is not the same as true faith.\n\nThat’s not something I can judge of individuals. I must remove this beam from my own eye before I worry about the motes in others, including politicians."
