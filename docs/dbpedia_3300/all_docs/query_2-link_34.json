        "text": "Tammy Duckworth (born March 12, 1968, Bangkok, Thailand) is an American politician who was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in 2016 and began representing Illinois the following year. She previously was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (2013–17).\n\nDuckworth was born in Bangkok, the daughter of an American development-aid worker and a Thai mother of Chinese descent. The family lived in Thailand and Singapore before relocating to Hawaii when she was 16. They briefly lived on public assistance, an experience that resonated with voters when Duckworth entered electoral politics. She graduated (1989) from the University of Hawaii, then took a master’s degree (1992) in international affairs at George Washington University, where she joined the Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). During this time, she met her future husband, Bryan Bowlsbey, who was also in ROTC, and the couple later had two daughters; when she had her youngest, in 2018, Duckworth became the first senator to give birth while in office.\n\nDuckworth eventually became a member of the National Guard, training as a helicopter pilot. While working on a doctorate at Northern Illinois University, she was called to active duty and sent to Iraq in 2004. There her helicopter was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade, and Duckworth lost both her legs and almost lost her right arm, which was saved after a 13-hour-long emergency surgery. While undergoing extensive rehabilitation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Duckworth was awarded (2004) the Purple Heart. In 2014 she retired from the military as a lieutenant colonel. The following year she received a doctorate in human services at Capella University.\n\nIn 2006 Duckworth ran as a Democrat for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives but was defeated. She then served as the state’s director of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (2006–09). After former Illinois senator Barack Obama became president, Duckworth became assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (2009–11). She resigned to run for the House of Representatives from the 8th congressional district of Illinois, and she defeated her Republican opponent by a 10-point margin in the 2012 race.\n\nDuckworth took office in 2013, and she proved a dependable ally of President Obama and his legislative initiatives, including various provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. She was also a leader in efforts to pass gun-control legislation. In 2016 she ran against Republican incumbent Mark Kirk for a seat in the Senate. He assailed her for adhering to the Democratic line, to which she memorably replied, “These legs are titanium. They don’t buckle. Go ahead, take a shot at me.” She was elected by a broad margin, making her the first U.S. senator born in Thailand. After taking office in 2017, Duckworth continued to pursue largely liberal policies.\n\nIn 2018 Duckworth helped defeat a Republican-sponsored bill that, according to its critics, would have weakened the Americans with Disabilities Act. The following year the House of Representatives impeached Republican Pres. Donald Trump over allegations that he withheld aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country into opening a corruption investigation into Joe Biden (in 2020 Biden became the Democratic presidential nominee). The Senate trial was held in February, and Duckworth voted to convict Trump, though he was acquitted in a largely party-line vote. Later in 2020 Duckworth was under consideration as a running mate for Biden, but he ultimately selected Kamala Harris. Biden went on to defeat Trump, though the latter challenged the results, alleging widespread voter fraud despite a lack of evidence. On January 6, 2021, as Duckworth and other members of Congress met to certify Biden’s victory, Trump supporters attacked the Capitol, temporarily halting the proceedings. Shortly thereafter the House impeached Trump for a second time, charging him with “incitement of insurrection.” Duckworth voted to convict, but Trump was acquitted in the Senate.\n\nIn 2021 Duckworth released the memoir Every Day Is a Gift."
