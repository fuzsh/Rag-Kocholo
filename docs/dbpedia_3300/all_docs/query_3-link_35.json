        "text": "John Ashcroft (born May 9, 1942, Chicago, Ill., U.S.) is a U.S. politician and lawyer, who served as attorney general of the United States (2001–05). He is known for his conservative policies and his support of the USA Patriot Act.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale University (B.A., 1964) and the University of Chicago (J.D., 1967), Ashcroft taught business law at Southwest Missouri State University. In 1972 he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. After serving as state auditor (1973–75), Ashcroft in 1976 was elected to the first of two terms as state attorney general, a post in which he earned much attention for his enforcement of a state law that restricted abortions.\n\nIn 1984 Ashcroft was elected governor of Missouri, and he was reelected in 1988. During his tenure as governor, he promoted fiscally and socially conservative policies. In 1994 he was elected to the U.S. Senate but was defeated in 2000, when he lost to Mel Carnahan, who had died shortly before the election and whose name remained on the ballot (Carnahan’s position in the Senate was taken by his wife). Subsequently, he was nominated by George W. Bush as U.S. attorney general. Ashcroft faced intense questioning in the Senate, particularly on his attitudes toward African Americans and homosexuals and on his ability as a fundamentalist Christian to uphold U.S. law, but he was confirmed by a vote of 58 to 42.\n\nAs attorney general, Ashcroft was at the centre of policy changes adopted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) during 2002. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, he pressed for the passage of the USA Patriot Act (formally the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001), which expanded the government’s power to detain noncitizens, conduct surveillance and search, and investigate persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity. Ashcroft approved giving agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation permission to monitor people in public areas—in libraries and on the Internet, for example—without evidence that a crime had been committed. Perhaps no actions were more controversial, however, than his department’s handling of some 1,200 people jailed after the attacks. These included immigration violators whose cases were heard in secret and two U.S. nationals classified as “enemy combatants” and thus denied the legal rights of citizens. Ashcroft and the DOJ vigorously resisted challenges to its actions from the courts and from members of the U.S. Congress and the press."
