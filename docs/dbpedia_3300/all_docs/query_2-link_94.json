        "text": "BACK TO SCHOOL MEANS BACK-TO-BASICS SAFETY\n\nAugust 9, 2024\n\nAugust has arrived in Arkansas, marking the beginning of the new school year.\n\nArkansas State Police (ASP) wants to remind Arkansans that school days bring heavier traffic congestion in the mornings and afternoons when school buses are picking up riders, parents are hurrying to drop off their kids before heading to work, and new drivers are hitting the roads, many for the first time in rush hour traffic.\n\nOn any given day during the school year, 350,000 children are riding school buses on Arkansas roadways.\n\nASP recommends the following guidelines for driving near school buses:\n\n-- Always be cautious and attentive, especially before and after school hours.\n\n-- If driving behind a school bus, maintain a greater following distance than behind a car. This will give you more time to stop when the yellow lights start flashing.\n\n-- Never pass a school bus from behind or from either direction if you are on an undivided road and the bus has stopped to load or unload children. In Arkansas, drivers can be fined up to $2,500 or face up to 90 days in jail for illegally passing a stopped school bus.\n\n-- The area 10 feet around a school bus is the most dangerous for children. This is a critical zone where alertness can prevent accidents.\n\n-- Stop far enough back to allow school bus riders space to enter and exit the bus safely.\n\n-- Be alert, as children are often unpredictable and may take risks when crossing the road to their destination.\n\nBe attentive and patient with young, inexperienced drivers on the road. Remember, they are still learning and need understanding. ASP recommends that parents practice driving routes to school with new drivers to help them become familiar with traffic flow and potential dangers.\n\n\"Troopers will be diligently enforcing a strict zero-tolerance policy for any drivers who unlawfully pass a stopped school bus,\" said ASP Capt. Brad Lann. \"There is no destination important enough to justify passing a stopped school bus and endangering the lives of children.\"\n\nASP also encourages commuters to leave a few minutes earlier than usual and anticipate increased traffic and potential delays during the school drop-off and pick-up times.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT) IDrive app is an excellent source of information for checking for traffic delays and congested areas.\n\nCapt. Lann will be available for on-camera interviews today from 2:30 to 4 p.m. To schedule an interview, contact Public Information Manager Nick Genty at Nick.Genty@ASP.Arkansas.gov or (501) 618-8234.\n\nSTATE CAPITOL WEEK IN REVIEW FROM SENATOR MATT STONE\n\nAugust 9, 2024\n\nLITTLE ROCK – More than 3,000 families applied for Education Freedom Accounts during the first week of August, bringing the total number of applicants statewide to 15,365.\n\nThe Internet portal for applications had been closed over the summer and re-opened on July 29, when about 12,000 applications had been approved.\n\nThere is no scheduled deadline, as long as funding is available under the Arkansas LEARNS Act. The accounts expand school choice options by helping families pay tuition at private or parochial schools.\n\nLast year the governor proposed and the legislature approved Act 237 of 2023, also known as the LEARNS Act. The 2024-2025 school year is the second year it has been in effect. It is being phased in over three years.\n\nLast year students were eligible if they were first-time kindergarteners, or if they attended schools that got an “F” on school report cards or were enrolled in districts ranked at Level 5 for academic distress. Also eligible were children of active duty military members, as well as children with disabilities and children enrolled in kindergarten for the first time.\n\nFor the upcoming school year, eligibility is expanded to include students from a school that got a “D” on school report cards, children of military veterans and the children of emergency responders. Current or former foster children are eligible.\n\nAlso eligible are students from the Succeed Scholarship Program, which existed before the LEARNS Act was created.\n\nNext year, the third year of the phase-in of the Education Freedom Accounts, all children are eligible.\n\nAnother way the LEARNS Act expands school choice is by repealing previous limits on the number of charter schools in Arkansas.\n\nThe LEARNS Act also provides bonuses of up to $10,000 for teachers as merit incentives. In June, the state announced that 3,000 teachers qualified for the bonuses because their students showed remarkable academic improvement or they acted as inspiring mentors to new teachers.\n\nAlso, they qualified if they taught in a part of the state, or in a subject matter, with a critical teacher shortage. The state Education Department has listed those subjects in which there is a critical shortage of teachers. They are computer science, foreign language, secondary math, secondary science and special education.\n\nThe act raised the minimum salary for teachers from $36,000 to $50,000, which benefited more than 15,240 teachers. Also benefitting were teachers who already earned $50,000 or more, because they received raises of $2,000.\n\nAlso, the LEARNS Act provides teachers 12 weeks of paid maternity leave.\n\nOther provisions in the LEARNS Act expanded opportunities for high school students to enroll in college-level concurrent courses and receive college credits for passing them. Surveys indicate that students who take concurrent courses are more likely to obtain a college degree or certificate.\n\nUnder the LEARNS Act, Arkansas schools will recruit an additional 120 literacy specialists. The act provides $500 for families of students struggling to learn how to read in kindergarten through third grade, so they can hire a tutor.\n\nThe LEARNS Act requires high schools to develop a career-ready pathway towards a diploma, to prepare students for well-paying jobs if they choose not to go to college.\n\nTHE PENGUIN PROJECT HOSTS OPEN CALL FOR DISNEY’S “FINDING NEMO, KIDS” AUG 20 AT SAAC\n\nThe South Arkansas Arts Center is excited to announce an open call for the Penguin Project production of Disney’s “Finding Nemo, Kids,” designed for actors of differing needs and their peer mentors. Registration day will be held on Tuesday, Aug. 20 from 4:15-5:45pm, and is open to actors in grades 3-12 and to mentors grades 5-12. This inspiring event is under the direction of Lynn Gunter, with Music Director Cassie Hickman.\n\nFrom its starring roles to its ensemble, The Penguin Project allows children with differing needs to perform in a live stage production in front of an audience. Each artist is paired with a mentor of a similar age who guides them through the production from start to finish helping them to learn lines, dances, songs, and stage blocking. Each artist and their mentor operates as a symbiotic pair throughout the entire process, including appearing on stage together.\n\n\"We invite students to join us in the 'Big Blue World' starting August 20 for Registration Day.\" said Hickman. Students can register in the SAAC lobby from 4:15-4:45pm, followed by a cast meeting and theatre games for both actors and mentors from 4:45-5:45pm. The directors have planned some fun and creative theatre games designed to help identify which roles best suit each actor's talents and to make the best matches for the artist/mentor teams.\n\nRehearsals will begin on Thursday, August 22, from 4:15-6:15pm, and will take place at the same time every Tuesday and Thursday for six weeks, culminating in performances Sept. 27 -28. Mentors can earn up to 40+ community service hours through their participation.\n\n\"Finding Nemo, Kids\" is a musical that follows the adventurous journey of a timid clownfish named Marlin and his spirited son, Nemo, who is captured by a diver and placed in a fish tank. With the help of Dory, a forgetful but friendly blue tang, Marlin embarks on a quest across the ocean to rescue his son. Along the way, they encounter various sea creatures, face challenges, and learn valuable lessons about bravery, friendship, and the importance of family. The musical features catchy songs, vibrant characters, and a heartwarming message.\n\n“When I consider directing the Penguin Project, I can't help but think of the amazing faces of all the actors who have taken part in our program,” Gunter expressed. “I reflect on the obstacles they’ve overcome to make it to opening night and the immense pride they felt as the audience celebrated their performances. The joy and emotion from the parents are truly unforgettable. What do I cherish most about the Penguin Project? I love witnessing your children shine!”\n\nFor more information about The Penguin Project and to get involved, please call the SAAC office at 870-862-5474, visit our website at www.saac-arts.org, or drop by the SAAC at 110 E. 5th Street, El Dorado, Arkansas\n\nCADC TO DISTRIBUTE USDA COMMODITIES AUGUST 14 & 15, 2024 IN OUACHITA AND CALHOUN COUNTY\n\nCentral Arkansas Development Council will distribute USDA Commodities in Ouachita and Calhoun Counties Wednesday, August 14, and Thursday, August 15, 2024, Distribution will begin at 9 am.\n\nFood Items May Include:\n\nUHT Milk, Grape Juice, Applesauce, Raisins, Spinach, Cream of Mushroom, Tomato Sauce, Dry Pinto Beans, Peanut Butter, Farina Wheat, Beef Stew, Can Pork, Can Chicken, Can Beef, Can Salmon, Macaroni\n\nIn Ouachita County, commodities will be distributed at the following location:\n\nCARNES PARK, Carnes Park Dr, Camden\n\nIn Calhoun County, commodities will be distributed at the following location:\n\nCADC Office, 210 South Lee Street, Hampton, AR (870) 626-0553\n\nAll customers receiving commodities must present identification.

Registration for the event is required at myarpbs.org/arkansastreasures.\n\n“Arkansas Treasures” encourages supporters from across the state to bring treasures from their attics, basements, barns and beyond to be evaluated by an expert (for entertainment purposes only) and potentially have their stories shared for the Season 2 broadcast. The series will feature several professional evaluators meeting with individuals to learn more about their heirlooms, collectibles and garage sale finds and viewers will get to hear the stories of how they acquired these items and how much each is potentially worth. Amory LeCuyer, owner and lead appraiser for Hampton House Auctions in Yorktown, Virginia, serves as lead appraiser for the production.\n\nTo provide a fair, secure and efficient experience, all attendees are required to register in advance. Admission for two people and evaluation of up to two items total is now available for a donation of $120 to Arkansas PBS Foundation; admission for two people and evaluation of three items is available for a donation of $150.

(August 6, 2024) – The Arkansas Economic Development Commission’s Division of Rural Services awarded $344,728.69 in grants to 33 Arkansas cities and counties.\n\nGovernor Sarah Huckabee Sanders presented the grants, alongside AEDC officials, during an award ceremony at the Governor's Conference Room in Little Rock. Representatives from the Arkansas communities attended to accept the Rural Community Grant Program awards.\n\n“These grants go a long way toward making sure that every corner of Arkansas – not just a few big cities – is taken care of,” said Governor Sanders. “These 33 recipients come from across our state, from Yellville to Mulberry. Each one of these grants provides their communities with the tools they need to make Arkansas the best place to live, work, and raise a family.”\n\nThe Rural Community Grant Program is one of the Division of Rural Services’ programs, which is used to fund projects such as fire trucks, fire protection equipment, community centers, storm sirens, community parks, walking trails, and baseball fields. Applicants from incorporated towns of less than 3,000 in population and unincorporated rural areas are eligible for up to $15,000 in matching funds under the program.\n\n“Rural communities play a major role in the economic success of our state,” said Clint O’Neal, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. “The grants awarded by AEDC’s Division of Rural Services will help rural communities throughout the state improve their infrastructure and quality of life amenities to benefit Arkansans.”\n\nThe grants are part of the Division of Rural Services’ second cycle of Fiscal Year 2024 grants. AEDC previously awarded $806,125 in grants to 29 Arkansas cities and counties during the 2024 Rural Development Conference in May.\n\n“We are committed to working with and supporting rural communities in Arkansas to help them succeed,” said Becca Caldwell, director of the Division of Rural Services. “With the latest Rural Community Grant Program awards, thirty-three Arkansas cities and counties have additional resources and funding for important projects that will increase quality of life in their communities.”\n\nFor cities and counties interested in applying for Fiscal Year 2025 grants, the next application cycle deadline is August 8, 2024.

This ruling is a win for Arkansans and should send a message to all businesses that unlawful and unfair practices will not be tolerated. Now that liability has been determined, I will continue to push forward with this lawsuit to seek injunctive relief that benefits Arkansans and provides space for competition among internet search engines.”\n\nThe court found that Google violated federal antitrust laws by entering into exclusionary contracts, making Google the default and exclusive search engine for browsers, mobile devices, and wireless carriers in exchange for a percentage of the revenue Google earned through such placement. This case was consolidated with another enforcement action filed by 38 other attorneys general.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held Google liable in both lawsuits. The court found that Google’s default distribution contracts are anticompetitive, that Google has no procompetitive justification for these contracts, and that Google has monopoly power in multiple online search markets.\n\nCOTTON ACCEPTING SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINATIONS\n\nWashington, D.C. – Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) announced today that he is accepting applications for service academy nominations.

A net 18% (seasonally adjusted) plan to raise compensation in the next three months, down four points from June.\n\n“Fewer small business owners are planning to raise compensation in the coming months, and plans to hire remain stable,” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “July marks the second month of net gains in employment on Main Street, and the number of firms with open positions remains exceptionally high.”\n\n“As costs remain elevated, small business owners have been topped out in wage increases,” NFIB State Director Katie Burns said. “Despite these challenges, Main Street will continue to try to fill their open job postings.”\n\nThe percent of small business owners reporting labor quality as their top small business operating problem was unchanged from June at 19%, although labor quality as the top problem has eased considerably over the last two quarters. Labor cost reported as the single most important problem for business owners fell two points to 9%, four points below the highest reading of 13% reached in December 2021.\n\nThirty-eight percent (seasonally adjusted) of small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in July, up one point from June.\n\nA seasonally adjusted net 15% of owners plan to create new jobs in the next three months, unchanged for the third consecutive month.\n\nOverall, 57% of small business owners reported hiring or trying to hire in July, down three points from June.

The Honorable Judge Susan O. Hickey presided over the sentencing hearing in the United States District Court in Hot Springs.\n\nAccording to court documents, on March 15, 2023, Special Agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Hot Springs Police Department, Special Investigations Division, conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle being operated by Stacy Childs, age 33, after Childs delivered fentanyl to another individual. A search of the vehicle yielded a total of 3,416.15 grams, or approximately 7.53 pounds, of pure methamphetamine, the bulk of which was concealed in a compartment underneath the center console of the vehicle. Childs was arrested on a Federal Complaint and later indicted by a Grand Jury seated in the Western District of Arkansas.\n\nU.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes of the Western District of Arkansas made the announcement.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and the Hot Springs Police Department, Special Investigations Division, investigated the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Bryan Achorn prosecuted the case.\n\nThis effort is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) operation. OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level criminal organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach. Additional information about the OCDETF Program can be found at https://www.justice.gov/OCDETF\n\nSTATE CAPITOL WEEK IN REVIEW FROM SENATOR MATT STONE\n\nAugust 2, 2024\n\nLITTLE ROCK – As the 2024-2025 school year begins, the state Education Department is making grants available to Arkansas school districts to help implement cell phone restrictions in the classroom.\n\nProhibiting or restricting cell phone use by students is complex, because they can be necessary for learning and doing research.\n\nHowever, recent studies clearly indicate that the mental health of some young people can be adversely affected by the amount of time they spend every day watching a screen. Rather than socializing face-to-face with fellow students and teachers, they are immersed in social media. They can be more vulnerable to bullying, and their self-confidence can be fragile.\n\nIn early July the governor and the Education Secretary announced that the state would make grants available to local schools to alleviate the unfolding crisis of “youth depression, anxiety and isolation” caused by excessive cell phone use among juveniles.\n\nThe grants can be used to pay for mental health services, via telehealth technology. It also is being used for secure pouches in which students lock away their cell phones during the day. Each pouch costs about $30. Teachers and other school personnel will have special magnets that unlock them.\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the Education Department, more than 200 Arkansas school districts are interested in taking advantage of the grant program. Many schools already had policies limiting students’ use of cell phones for non-academic activities.\n\nThe enrollment in Arkansas schools from kindergarten through twelfth grade is about 475,000. In the upcoming school year an estimated 200,000 students will be in pilot programs that limit cell phone access during the day.\n\nAccurately measuring results will be a key component of the policy to restrict cell phone, and that takes time. There are studies, and plenty of anecdotal evidence, indicating that students improve their academics if they’re more engaged with their teacher and fellow students.\n\nHowever, in order to fully measure any benefits from restricting cell phones, it will take at least one full school year and probably more to compile changes in test scores. The effect on students’ mental health is even more difficult to accurately gauge.\n\nTherefore, the pilot program includes an ongoing survey by the Office of Education Policy at the University of Arkansas to examine how restrictions on cell phones affect the mental health of students. The theory is that limiting young people’s exposure to social media will improve their mental health.\n\nSchool districts that have already limited cell phones in classrooms report positive results, not just in academics but also in student behavior. Some school districts will begin by limiting cell phones in middle schools because that is when many students get their first devices, and begin forming online habits.\n\nSchool Lunches\n\nSchool districts implement a policy every year for collecting money from students for lunches and snacks. It is not as simple as it may appear at first glance because some students get behind in their payments, and schools must continue to provide them with the same meals that all students get.\n\nSchools may not stigmatize students who are behind in payments, such as by making them wear wrist bands. School nutrition policies must comply with Act 428 of 2019, the Hunger-Free Students’ Bill of Rights Act.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR WILDLAND FIRE SUPPRESSION KITS ACCEPTED THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30\n\nLITTLE ROCK, AR – The Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Forestry Division is now accepting applications for wildland fire suppression kits through September 30, 2024. The application can be found here.\n\nThe Forestry Division has requested, through a United States Forest Service grant, to provide 85 kits this year to rural volunteer fire departments across the state. Since 2014, more than 757 wildland fire suppression kits have been distributed.\n\nVolunteer fire departments are the primary partner to Forestry Division crews in wildfire response and suppression, but they are often in need of specialized equipment and gear necessary for safe wildfire suppression. The necessary equipment and gear in the kits include: lightweight wildfire-resistant coveralls, wildland gloves, rakes, backpack water pumps, and leaf blowers.\n\nRural volunteer fire departments are encouraged to apply online, but paper applications are available upon request. Applications are scored according to specific criteria to include the population of the fire district, the number of square miles covered, the average number of wildfires a department responds to annually, and other factors.\n\nThe selected departments will be notified in November and kits will be delivered in the spring of 2025 or as soon as supplies are received.\n\nFire departments may contact Kathryn Mahan-Hooten at kathryn.mahan@agriculture.arkansas.gov or (501) 679-3183 with questions. More information about the program can be found at the Department’s website.\n\nENTERGY ARKANSAS CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE A ONE-TIME BILL CREDIT IN AUGUST\n\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. – At a time when budgets may be tight with back-to-school shopping and higher summer expenses, Entergy Arkansas customers will be getting a break on their August bills.\n\nA residential customer will receive a one-time bill credit of approximately $78 – a decrease of about 63% for a residential customer using 1,000 kwh. Commercial and industrial customers will also receive a one-time bill credit in August. Small General Service customers will receive a credit of approximately $221, and Large General Service customers will receive a credit of approximately $12,158.\n\nThe bill credit is applied in August and coincides with July energy consumption, which is usually one of the highest months from an energy usage and bill amount standpoint.\n\nIt also comes months after residential customers saw their bills decrease an average of 7.5% in April, or about $10 a month, because of lower prices for the fuel used to generate electricity for our customers. Commercial and industrial customers saw anywhere from a 1.6% to 17.7% decrease, depending on their usage.\n\n“We work hard each day to provide reliable and affordable energy by keeping our costs as low as possible for our customers,” said Ventrell Thompson, vice president of Customer Service for Entergy Arkansas. “We know that higher costs for groceries and other everyday living expenses can be tough for some of our customers, especially during the summer months. We are pleased that the timing of these bill credits will allow our customers to spend their money on other needs, such as back-to-school shopping.”\n\nThe credit, known as the “Grand Gulf Bill Credit,” stems from a lawsuit settlement between the Arkansas Public Service Commission and System Energy Resources Inc., which operates the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. Other Entergy operating companies in Mississippi and New Orleans also settled the lawsuit under the same terms as Arkansas.\n\nOnly current Entergy Arkansas customers who began service in December 2023 or earlier will qualify for the bill credits. If the August bill credit exceeds a customer’s total bill charges, any remaining bill credit amount will apply toward their subsequent bills.\n\nAs noted in an earlier release, Entergy Arkansas has also recently debuted a new bill toolkit for customers looking to save money on their electric bills.\n\nThe new Bill Toolkit site helps customers find ways to manage energy usage, get assistance paying their utility bills and find other ways to save through energy efficiency, including no cost or low cost Entergy Solutions programs.\n\nFor more information, visit BillToolkit.entergy.com for the tools and resources you need to understand your bill, reduce your usage or look for assistance programs and services available to you.\n\nMcGEHEE MAN CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH DECEMBER 2023 WILMAR DOUBLE HOMICIDE\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\nLAKE VILLAGE, Ark. - On Tuesday, July 30, 2024, at approximately 7:25 p.m., Arkansas State Police (ASP) stopped a black Dodge Charger at the intersection of Arkansas Highways 56 and 82 in Lake Village for a traffic violation. A passenger was identified as Taiwan Collins Jr., 25, of McGehee, who was wanted by the Monticello Police Department in connection with a double homicide investigation that occurred in Wilmar in early December 2023.\n\nASP arrested Collins and transported him to the Drew County Detention Center, where he is being held on two counts of Capital Murder.\n\nOn Sunday, December 3, 2023, the Drew County Sheriff's Office responded to a 911 call at approximately 2:30 a.m., arriving at the old Wilmar School on North 5th Street to find two deceased men. Suquorey Pitts Jr., 25, of Dumas, was found in the front passenger seat of a vehicle parked in the school's driveway. Independence Young, 21, of McGehee, was found lying on North 5th Street.\n\nASP Criminal Investigation Division Company B investigated the homicides.\n\nARKANSAS MAN SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON FOR FIREARM POSSESSION\n\nHOT SPRINGS – A Little Rock man was sentenced yesterday to the maximum sentence of 120 months in prison followed by 3 years of supervised release on one count of Felon in Possession of a Firearm. The Honorable Chief Judge Susan O. Hickey presided over the sentencing hearing in the U.S. District Court in Hot Springs.\n\nAccording to court documents, on June 23, 2022, a deputy with the Garland County Sheriff’s Office conducted a traffic stop in the 600 block of East Grand Avenue in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The deputy made contact with the driver, and sole occupant, of the vehicle Chantze T. Howze, age 30. As the deputy returned to his vehicle to investigate the information provided by Howze, Howze fled the scene in his vehicle. The deputy began pursuing Howze at speeds more than 100 miles per hour.\n\nA trooper with the Arkansas State Police assisted in the pursuit of Howze, whose vehicle traveled in and out of traffic and traveled into the oncoming lane. Howze ultimately lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a motel located at the intersection of East Grand Avenue and Coy Street in Hot Springs causing damage to the building. A search of the vehicle yielded 795 grams of marijuana and a Glock 9mm semi-automatic handgun loaded with 18 live rounds. Howze was prohibited from possessing a firearm due to a prior felony conviction of Possession with Purpose to Deliver Controlled Substance Schedule IV and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia to Manufacture.\n\nU.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes of the Western District of Arkansas made the announcement.\n\nThe Garland County Sheriff’s Department, 18th East Judicial District Drug Task Force, Arkansas State Police and the 18th East Prosecuting Attorney’s Office investigated the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Trent Daniels prosecuted the case.\n\nThis case was prosecuted as part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and make our neighborhoods safer for everyone. The Department of Justice reinvigorated PSN in 2017 as part of the Department’s renewed focus on targeting violent criminals, directing all U.S. Attorney’s Offices to work in partnership with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and the local community to develop effective, locally-based strategies to reduce violent crime.\n\nRelated court documents may be found on the Public Access to Electronic Records website @ www.pacer.gov.\n\nGET READY TO BOOGIE AT SAAC’S AUGUST CORKS AND CANVAS CLASS!\n\nJoin SAAC for a groovy evening of creativity and fun at our “Disco Daze” Corks and Canvas class, led by local artist Marla Tomlinson.

The senator’s language was added to the Fiscal Year 2025 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act and encourages OSHA to conduct listening sessions and outreach with stakeholders to fully understand the impact of new requirements on volunteer fire departments.\n\n“We must ensure firefighters have the tools and training to safeguard themselves and the community, which means any adjustments to the standards applied to them must be carefully considered. OSHA’s current one-size-fits-all proposal could jeopardize volunteer fire departments’ ability to continue operating or drastically limit their resources and personnel capacity. I’m hopeful the plan can be revised with feedback from stakeholders,” Boozman said.\n\nArkansas has 1,003 fire departments and 974 are at least partially staffed by volunteers.\n\nIn February, OSHA announced its proposal to modernize safety requirements for emergency responders, but volunteer fire departments in Arkansas and across the country have shared their apprehensions with Congress that parts of the plan could cause unintended consequences and lead to increased costs resulting in potential cuts to services.\n\nBoozman recently responded to the proposed rule and assured Arkansans of his commitment to protect volunteer fire departments from unfunded mandates. In July, members of the Arkansas Congressional Delegation voiced their concerns about the rules to the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nTROOPER TVI ENDS HIGH-SPEED PURSUIT OF STOLEN VEHICLE\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\nWEST MEMPHIS, Ark. — On Saturday, July 20, 2024, at approximately 11:36 p.m., Arkansas State Police (ASP) pursued a black 2021 Ford Mustang that witnesses reported driving recklessly and nearly causing collisions. The pursuit occurred as the vehicle disregarded the motoring public, passing through the Broadway Boulevard and Martin Luther King Drive (MLK) intersection in West Memphis at speeds over 100 miles an hour.\n\n“We are taking every opportunity to warn the public about the dangers of fleeing from law enforcement. Fleeing is reckless and selfish,” said ASP Colonel Mike Hagar. \"ASP Troopers will not tolerate activity that risks the lives of innocent civilians. We will stop fleeing suspects, and the consequences will be severe.\"\n\nTroopers continued to pursue the vehicle on the Interstate 55 South Service Road. The suspect vehicle turned north and traveled onto the North Service Road as it continued to attempt to flee. As the suspect vehicle approached the intersection of the I-55 North Service Road and MLK, which has both heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic, Troopers performed a successful tactical vehicle intervention (TVI) to end the pursuit.\n\nBoth occupants exited the vehicle and fled on foot into a grassy field.\n\nTroopers, assisted by the West Memphis Police Department (WMPD), secured the area and located the two individuals.\n\nTroopers arrested the driver, Kylan Cunningham, 23, of Drummonds, Tenn., and the passenger, Tre’Von Burnett, 23, of Covington, Tenn., and transported them to the Crittenden County Detention Center.\n\nInside the vehicle, Troopers found a loaded black Tauras handgun, multiple vehicle key fobs, a vehicle key programming device, and illegal marijuana. The suspect vehicle and the seized handgun had been reported as stolen.\n\nCunningham has been charged with multiple felony counts, including Possession of Firearms by a Certain Person, Fleeing, Theft by Receiving, and Criminal Conspiracy, along with other charges.\n\nBurnett has been charged with felony Theft by Receiving and Criminal Conspiracy, among other charges.\n\nREQUEST FOR QUOTATION BY ARKANSAS SECRETARY OF STATE AND U.S. MARSHALS MUSEUM:\n\nFormal Portrait of Deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves for Display at the Arkansas State Capitol\n\nLITTLE ROCK, ARK.) – Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston and the U.S Marshals Museum are seeking exceptional artists to paint a formal portrait of legendary Deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves. Upon completion, the portrait will be displayed in the Arkansas State Capitol where he will be the first African American, and the first non-Governor, to have a portrait in the Capitol building.\n\nBorn in Crawford County, Arkansas, in the 1840s, Bass Reeves is now one of the most widely-known deputy United States marshals of 1800s American Western lore.

A Federal Order was issued on April 24, 2024, to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nAs of now, the influenza virus has not been detected in livestock within Arkansas. The Arkansas Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the USDA and the Arkansas Department of Health, remains vigilant in monitoring this potential threat.\n\nArkansas fairs and exhibitions provide a valuable opportunity for the youth of our state to showcase their animals. However, these events also pose a risk for the spread of illnesses among animals. The Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Livestock and Poultry Division, in collaboration with other state and federal agencies, encourages adherence to USDA requirements and recommendations to minimize the risk of influenza transmission.\n\nClick here for the full list of Recommendations to Minimize Influenza Transmission at Dairy Cattle Livestock Exhibitions\n\nThe list includes:\n\nIntrastate Movement\n\nTesting: Prior to intrastate movement, lactating dairy cattle are recommended to receive a negative test for Influenza A virus at an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratory using a NAHLN approved assay.\n\nDocumentation: The intrastate movement of all lactating dairy cattle must be accompanied by a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI).\n\nInterstate Movement\n\nTesting: Prior to interstate movement, lactating dairy cattle are required to receive a negative test for Influenza A virus at an approved NAHLN laboratory using a NAHLN approved assay.\n\nDocumentation: The interstate movement of all lactating dairy cattle must be accompanied by a CVI.\n\nExhibition Requirements: Animals moving by interstate to an exhibition, show, or sale must have a negative test result from samples collected within seven days of movement. These animals may return to their home herd using the same negative test result, provided the event does not exceed 10 days.\n\nPermitting: All dairy cattle entering Arkansas from states affected by HPAI in dairy cattle will require a permit from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture. Permits can be obtained here.\n\nDisposal of Milk\n\nNegative HPAI Test: Lactating dairy cattle that have a negative HPAI test will be able to dispose of milk following state, federal laws, and rules, and regulations.\n\nNo HPAI Test: Lactating dairy cattle that do not have a negative HPAI test should follow the USDA recommendations for milk disposal.\n\nAdditional Precautions\n\nEquipment and Tools: Equipment and tools should not be shared between exhibitors.\n\nIsolation Area: Each exhibition should prepare an isolation area for animals that develop symptoms.\n\nBy following these requirements and recommendations, we can help protect our livestock industry and maintain the health and safety of animals at our events.\n\nSOUTH ARKANSAS ARTS CENTER SEEKS DIRECTOR FOR \"A CHRISTMAS CAROL\"\n\nThe South Arkansas Arts Center is currently looking for a director for its upcoming holiday production of \"A Christmas Carol.\" Individuals interested in helming this classic Christmas tale, based on the novel by Charles Dickens, should contact SAAC by September 3.

While investigating a separate incident Utsey refused to identify himself. During the process of identifying other individuals on scene Utsey told others not to identify themselves. Other officers on scene were able to identify Utsey. Utsey continued to argue with others on scene when the others were trying to tell him to calm down. Several Officers witnessed Utsey yell at the homeowner. Utsey was told more than one time by Lieutenant Kayla Reynolds to calm down and stop yelling. Utsey began using profanity towards others in the yard causing other subjects in the yard to yell back at Utsey. It was clear Utsey was causing the scene to turn into a loud disturbance while the situation was already very tense. Lieutenant Reynolds gave the command to arrest Utsey for disorderly conduct. She also advised Utsey never gave his date of birth while on scene identifying himself. The only reason Officer McDowell was able to identify Utsey on scene was due to dispatch eventually finding Utsey's DOB in our records at the station. Utsey was placed under arrest by Officer McDowell. Officer Smith transported Utsey to the Camden Police Department and completed booking procedures. I issued Utsey a citation for Disorderly conduct.\n\nPUBLIC INTOXICATION\n\nFLEEING ON FOOT\n\nOn Thursday July 18, 2024 at 193 5 hours Officer McMahen was dispatched to Grinstead Street in reference to a man throwing stuff at cars holding a brown paper bag. Officer Joffrion, was close to that location so he responded.\n\nOfficer Joffrion arrived first on scene and observed a man wearing a grey muscle shirt and khaki shorts place a bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag down on some steps, located at 209 Grinstead, and begin to walk away. The Office got out and told him to stop. The suspect continued to walk away he was being told to stop. Officer McMahen arrived on scene as the man was heading south on Newton A venue. Officer Joffrion was attempting to catch up to the suspect when he noticed Officer McMahen come over the tracks on Grinstead Street. The suspect then began to run. Officer Joffrion was able to catch the suspect in an empty lot near Newton and Pine. Officer McMahen drove in front of the subject and jumped out to assist. While attempting to detain the suspect he began turning away from Officer Joffrion and then dropped to his knees. Officers were able to get the suspect into custody and he was transported to the Camden Police Department by Officer McMahen. Officer Joffrion collected the bottle on the way back to his unit and identified it as a bottle of Quality House Vodka. The suspect was identified as Brandon Champion. He was given a Citation for Public Intoxication and Fleeing on Foot..\n\nPUBLIC INTOXICATION\n\nOn July 20, 2024 Officer Gabriel McDowell was dispatched to 1136 Cook St in response to a black female attempting to steal an air conditioning unit out of a window. Upon arrival Officer McDowell spoke with a witness who stated that a black female with a white shirt, black pants and a weird hat attempted to steal a window unit out of 1117 Cook St. The witness told the Officer she yelled at the woman to leave it alone. The woman left the yard heading northbound on Cook St. The witness then pointed out Synicia Madison, who I observed to be stumbling around in the road. When the Officer approached her he could smell a strong odor of intoxicants. When asked her for her name and what she was doing, the Officer noticed that her speech was slurred to the point of being unintelligible. The Officer asked Madison if she knew anything about the window unit in the house down the road, and she denied having anything to do with it. The Officer was then advised by dispatch that she had an order for arrest with Ouachita County Sheriffs Department. Madison was arrested for public intoxication. She had difficulty walking to the vehicle and was mildly resistant due to being unable to comprehend instructions. Madison was transported to Camden Police Department where standard booking procedures were followed. Madison was charged with public intoxication before being transported to OCSO for detox.\n\nARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE RAISES AWARENESS ON INVASIVE SPECIES: COGONGRASS, MANCHURIAN WILD RICE, AND WATER HYACINTH\n\nLITTLE ROCK, AR – The Arkansas Department of Agriculture is issuing a public service announcement to raise awareness about the presence and potential threats posed by invasive species recently identified in Arkansas: cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), Manchurian wild rice (Zizania latifolia), and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes).\n\nInvasive species, whether plants, animals, or other organisms, are non-native to an ecosystem and can cause significant economic, environmental, or health-related harm upon introduction. The Arkansas Department of Agriculture, through various programs and in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey Program, actively monitors and surveys for invasive species to mitigate their impact.\n\n\"We urge Arkansans to remain vigilant against the spread of these invasive species,\" said Scott Bray, Director of the Arkansas Department of Agriculture's Plant Industries Division. \"Through ongoing surveillance and public awareness efforts, we aim to protect our state's natural resources, agricultural lands, and native ecosystems from the harmful impacts of invasive species.\"\n\nInitially discovered along Highway 49 near Helena-West Helena in June 2021, cogongrass is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. Known for its aggressive spread via rhizomes and wind-borne seeds, this invasive plant has become a serious threat to pastures, fallow fields, and natural habitats across the Southern United States. Efforts to eradicate cogongrass in Arkansas are ongoing, highlighting its persistence and destructive potential. The ornamental variety known as Japanese blood grass or Red Baron poses a similar threat, as it can revert to its invasive parent form and rapidly invade yards and gardens.\n\nRecently discovered growing in a vacant lot in Stuttgart, Manchurian wild rice is a large perennial aquatic grass native to Asia. It can reach heights of up to 12 feet and thrives in stagnant ponds and poorly drained soils. Efforts to eradicate this invasive species are underway due to its potential to disrupt native wetland ecosystems and impact agricultural areas, including rice production zones. Although genetically distinct from domestic rice (Oryza sativa), concerns remain about potential cross-contamination and the introduction of new diseases or pests harmful to Arkansas's rice industry.\n\nDiscovered being illegally offered for sale via social media platforms by Arkansas residents, water hyacinth is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. Despite misconceptions about its winter hardiness in Arkansas, this invasive species can survive and overwinter in various parts of the state, forming dense mats that choke water bodies and disrupt local ecosystems. It is illegal to buy, sell, trade, gift, or use water hyacinth in landscaping due to its rapid spread and ecological impact.\n\nResidents are urged to properly dispose of any water hyacinth and prevent its further spread by avoiding transportation via boats or equipment that may inadvertently introduce it to new locations. Do not buy or sell this plant. If you already have some, remove it from any water to allow it to dry and dispose of it in the trash. Never add any water hyacinth to any location where it can escape and overtake an area. If you are boating in a location with water hyacinth, make certain that you never transport it through propellers, trailers, or live wells.\n\nIf you possess or suspect the presence of an invasive species anywhere in Arkansas, please call (501) 225-1598 or submit a removal request here. Find additional information on invasive species management here.\n\nPARAGOULD, ARKANSAS ARTIST MANDY MAXWELL MOONEYHAM COMING TO SAAC\n\nThe South Arkansas Arts Center welcomes Paragould, Arkansas artist Mandy Maxwell Mooneyham and her exhibition “Chree Journeys” to the Lobby Gallery. The Opening Reception will be July 27, 6-7:30pm with the exhibition running through September 5, 2024.\n\nInspired by the symbiotic connection between trees and chairs, Mooneyham's \"Chree Journeys\" represent the dynamic interplay between our grounded existence and the boundless growth and transformation of our thoughts. Each piece in this series is a visual metaphor for the human thought process, where trees symbolize the adaptability and resilience of the human mind, and chairs embody the constructed nature of our recollections.\n\nMooneyham's artistic journey began in rural Arkansas, where she taught herself to draw and paint by studying masterpieces from old library books. She later honed her skills at Arkansas State University, where she discovered her love for surrealism and printmaking. Her fascination with “Chrees” started with her first piece, \"Such Great Heights,\" in 2009, and has since become an all-consuming passion.\n\nThroughout her career, Mooneyham has received numerous accolades and exhibited her work in venues such as the Brooks Museum of Art in Memphis and the Batesville Area Arts Council Gallery. Her most recent achievement is being recognized as a touring artist with the Arkansas Small Works on Paper 2023 exhibition.\n\nMooneyham’s exhibition invites viewers on a journey of introspection and contemplation, allowing them to delve into the complexities of the human mind. Her artwork is a testament to her dedication to capturing the intricate nuances of human existence through her unique “Chree” concept. With each piece, she aims to evoke a sense of wonder, ignite introspection, and illuminate the profound marvels that lie within the captivating realm of “Chree.”\n\nThe Opening Reception will be held Saturday, July 27 from 6:00-7:30pm in conjunction with “Lines & Layers: The Art of Gary Bachers & Christopher Bachers” that is showing in the Merkle and Price Galleries. SAAC gallery exhibits are free and open to the public 9am to 5pm Monday through Friday.\n\nFor more information about exhibits at the South Arkansas Arts Center, please call the SAAC office at 870-862-5474 or visit the website at www.saac-arts.org. SAAC is located at 110 East Fifth Street, El Dorado, Arkansas.\n\nLEE COUNTY MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDER IN DEATH OF 5-YEAR-OLD BOY\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\nMARIANNA, Ark. — On Monday, July 15, 2024, Nathan Bridges, 34, pleaded guilty to First-Degree Murder and First-Degree Battery in the 2022 death of a 5-year-old boy in the Moro community, west of Marianna in Lee County.\n\nBridges was sentenced to 60 years in the Arkansas Department of Corrections.\n\nThe body of Blu Rolland, 5, was uncovered beneath a floor inside his family’s home on Dec. 16, 2022, the day he would have turned 6.

The study compiles statewide data on hospitals’ employment, payroll, purchasing, and other spending to illustrate the pivotal role they play in the state’s economy. The report breaks down the estimated annual economic impact of the state’s hospitals as follows:\n\nEmployment: Arkansas hospitals employ 48,200 individuals, with an annual combined payroll expenditure of just over $4.3 billion.\n\nEconomic Activity of Hospital Employees: The earnings of hospital employees generate approximately$8 billion in economic activity in the state, which creates an additional estimated 46,200 jobs.\n\nNon-Salary Expenditures: The total impact of hospitals’ $5 billion in other non-salary expenditures is estimated at $9.2 billion per year.\n\nCharity Care: The report also indicates that hospitals provided $466 million in charity care in 2022, for patients who could not afford to pay for the cost of their services.\n\nThe report also notes that, while providing health care services is their core contribution, hospitals also serve their communities in a variety of other ways, including health promotion outreach, mobile disease screening, programming to combat food insecurity, health insurance access, medical-legal partnerships, and much more.\n\n“The information provided in this year’s Economic Impact Report underscores the essential economic contributions of hospitals to our state,” said Bo Ryall, President and CEO of the Arkansas Hospital Association. “This report is crucial for understanding our advocacy mission at AHA. It illustrates how our hospitals are not only health care providers but also key drivers of economic growth and stability in Arkansas. By supporting our hospitals, we are not only protecting access to quality health care for all – we’re investing in the health and economic well-being of our state’s communities.”\n\nAbout the AHA\n\nThe Arkansas Hospital Association has 105 member hospitals and health care organizations that serve Arkansans living in cities, towns, and communities located throughout the state. For more than 90 years, the AHA’s leadership has focused on advocacy that promotes initiatives to improve health care access, quality, value, service, and safety. In partnership with our members and stakeholders, the association also provides resources, builds alliances, and develops services that support Arkansas hospitals as they strive to deliver superior health care to all Arkansans.\n\nTo read the report, visit www.arkhospitals.org or https://bit.ly/2024-economic-impact-report.

The income tax cut was the major achievement of a recent special legislative session. The legislature approved the governor’s proposal to reduce the state’s top individual income tax rate from 4.4 percent to 3.9 percent.\n\nThe legislature has approved numerous income tax cuts over the past several years, but the current tax reduction took effect immediately and applies to tax year 2024. The tax cut will save Arkansas residents more than $256 million every year.\n\nMost legislators and the governor say that Arkansas income taxes need to be lowered or repealed altogether, in order for Arkansas to compete economically with neighboring states. Every tax reduction makes it easier for the state to recruit industry.\n\nThe top corporate income tax rate is going down from 4.8 percent to 4.3 percent, saving 7,800 businesses based in Arkansas about $66.2 million every fiscal year.\n\nIn a recent speech the president of the state Chamber of Commerce said that Arkansas is more economically competitive than it has ever been, largely due to recent tax reductions that have allowed businesses to pay higher wages and make more capital investments.\n\nHe also gave credit to recent positive changes in the collection of unemployment insurance taxes and favorable workers’ comp rates.\n\nHowever, one issue continues to concern policy makers– the lack of skilled labor in certain sectors. It’s a reason legislators and officials of Arkansas colleges and universities support programs to recruit and retain more college graduates.\n\nNew Mississippi River Bridge\n\nArkansas and Tennessee received grants totaling $393 million for their joint project to replace the Interstate 55 bridge across the Mississippi River at West Memphis. The bridge is 75 years old, and is narrower than the Interstate 40 bridge that crosses the river from West Memphis to downtown Memphis.\n\nIt is the largest grant ever received by the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The total cost of replacing the I-55 bridge is an estimated $800 million. In addition to the federal grant, Arkansas and Tennessee have each pledged $250 million toward the project.\n\nReplacing the aging bridge is important to all Arkansas citizens, not just those in West Memphis, because of its statewide economic impact. As the governor noted when the grant was announced, West Memphis is where “America’s road, river and rail infrastructure meet.”\n\nThe confluence of highway, railroad and barge traffic was a factor in the growth of the northeast Arkansas steel industry.\n\nImproving traffic across the river along I-55 will solidify Arkansas’s role as a leader in transportation and logistics, the governor said.\n\nCurrently, traffic across the bridges averages about 48,000 vehicles a day, and by 2050 it will increase to an estimated 64,000 vehicles a day.\n\nThe new bridge will be larger than the existing one, and it will have more features to withstand earthquakes.\n\nA LEGACY OF LOVE AND CREATIVITY: THE ART OF GARY AND CHRISTOPHER BACHERS COMES TO SAAC\n\nThe South Arkansas Arts Center is proud to present the exhibition “Lines & Layers: The Art of Gary Bachers & Christopher Bachers” at an opening reception on Saturday, July 27 from 6:00-7:30pm. This unique father-son duo, both artists from Texas, will be featured together for the first time ever in this special exhibition continuing through September 5, 2024 in the Merkle and Price Galleries.\n\nThe exhibition \"Lines & Layers: The Art of Gary Bachers & Christopher Bachers\" from July 27 – September 5 in the Merkle and Price Galleries. This unique father-son duo, both artists from Texas, will be featured together for the first time ever in this special exhibition. An artists' reception will be held in conjuction with Mandy Mooneyham’s reception on Saturday, July 27 from 6:00-7:30pm.\n\nGary Bachers, a former medical doctor and accomplished artist, suffered a massive stroke at age 38, leaving him with right-sided paralysis and global expressive aphasia, which prevented him from speaking or writing. Despite this, he found a new form of expression through art, using his left hand to create intricate and detailed works with colored pencils. His art became his \"language\" and a way to communicate with the world. Gary's art features themes of the full moon, seasonal changes, botanical mandalas, and children, which represent the predictable and cyclical nature of life. He won numerous awards and has been featured in exhibitions and documentaries.\n\nGary's son and the oldest of three siblings, Christopher Bachers grew up surrounded by his father's art and was exposed to the art world from a young age. Christopher pursued a career in English and American literature, but began painting as a hobby during his graduate studies. He has developed his own unique style, combining vivid colors and abstract lines to create enigmatic compositions that explore themes of communication and self-expression. Christopher has won several awards for his art and has participated in various exhibitions, including the same regional show where his father started his career.\n\nGary Bachers passed away in August of 2023, but his wife Gabrielle and their son Christopher wanted to carry on with this exhibition. “People always say we’re a creative family. Not only my dad and I, but my mother, brother, and sister are all artists in their own areas. Looking back, it’s clear that we were all inspired by Dad. We lived alongside his daily art practice, watching his compositions and second career steadily develop over the years. It’s a small example of how art can make meaning and transform lives,” said Christopher.\n\nThe opening reception will be held in conjunction with Paragould, Arkansas artist Mandy Maxwell Mooneyham and her exhibition “Chree Journeys” on Saturday, July 27 from 6:00-7:30pm. The galleries are free and open to the public 9am to 5pm Monday through Friday. For more information on the exhibitions, please call the SAAC office at 870-862-5474 or visit our website at www.saac-arts.org. The South Arkansas Arts Center is located at 110 East Fifth Street, El Dorado, Arkansas.\n\nCAMDEN POLICE REPORTS\n\nOn July 9, 2024 at 12:41 AM Officer Sharlotte Canada was patrolling in the area of Tate Street near Avon. While in the area, Officer Canada observed a black male riding a bicycle around in the area trying to avoid the Officer on Pierce Street. The male was wearing dark clothing and a hat. He looked suspicious; therefore, I attempted to make contact with him.\n\nOfficer Canada exited the patrol vehicle and asked the male to stand in front of the Officers vehicle. The man was identified as Jimmy Hildreth. He was where he was coming from and he said he was looking for a woman. When asked who he was looking for he told the Officer “he was grown.” The Officer told him the reason for making contact with him was due to crimes being committed late at night and suspicious activities. Hildreth again said he was looking for a woman. He was where he lived and he stated he lived at 20 l Ratcliff, which was across town.\n\nA warrant check was conducted through dispatch. While waiting Hildreth was advised to keep his hands in front of him. He stated he had a machete on his person for protection. Dispatch advised Hildreth had a warrant with county. As Officer Canada attempted to take Hildreth into custody, he stated he was not going to jail. The Officer grabbed Hildreth and held on to him. Hildreth kept tensing up, but Officer Canada was able to hold on to him until Officer Joffrion arrived on scene as back up.\n\nHildreth was taken into custody without incident. A search of his person was conducted. He had the machete, longer than 3 inches, a pocketknife, and several unused syringes. Hildreth was escorted to Officer Joffrion's patrol vehicle and transported to the station. At the station, Officer Joffrion located a clear plastic baggie of a green leafy substance consistent with marijuana in his left sock. It was collected as evidence.\n\nHildreth was charged with Carrying a Knife as a Weapon due to the knife being readily available to use against a person and Possession of a Controlled Substance (marijuana).

Watson’s bond was set at $250,000.\n\nASP APPREHENDS TWO TEXAS MEN SUSPECTED IN MULTI-STATE BARCODE SWAPPING THEFTS\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nOMAHA, Ark.— On Monday, July 7, 2024, around 6:15 p.m., Arkansas State Police (ASP) stopped a silver 2017 Ford pickup on U.S. Highway 65 near Tower Road in Boone County for a traffic violation.\n\nDuring a vehicle search, ASP Troopers discovered 22 unopened garage door openers in the truck bed and rear floorboard. Each opener retails from around $200. The vehicle's occupants, identified as Terry White, 52, of Pasadena, Texas, and Robert Diaz, 34, of Spring, Texas, could not provide receipts or proof of purchase for the openers.\n\nThe shipping labels indicated they had originated from a Lowe’s store in Bentonville. Further investigation revealed evidence that the men may have been involved in a multi-state barcode swapping scheme.\n\nWhite had multiple active warrants for retail theft in Alabama, Florida, and Kentucky. Troopers transported both men to the Boone County Detention Center, where they were charged with Felony Theft by Receiving.\n\nSpecial Agents with ASP's Criminal Investigation Division collected evidence tying the men to items stolen from multiple states, valued at more than $160,000\n\nSTATE CAPITOL WEEK IN REVIEW FROM SENATOR MATT STONE\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nLITTLE ROCK – More than 870,000 Arkansas residents receive some type of health care through Medicaid, which is operated by the state Department of Human Services.\n\nThe department has made public a variety of cost-cutting ideas and has been gathering input from people who would be affected by them. Stakeholders include physicians and clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, therapists, rehabilitation and long-term care facilities.\n\nLast year the department trimmed the number of Medicaid recipients in Arkansas, after the expiration of the national public health emergency caused by the Covid epidemic. During the pandemic Arkansas Medicaid rolls reached a high of more than 1,151,000 people.\n\nAfter a six-month period of redetermining eligibility of recipients, the program now serves about 245,000 adults, 394,000 children and 250,000 adults in ARHOME. That is a health care program for adults who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The department uses Medicaid dollars to subsidize their private health insurance.\n\nMany people drop off the rolls and get back on again, depending on their financial circumstances. On a particular day the number of Medicaid enrollees is about 870,000 people, but over the course of last year more than a million Arkansas residents received some type of health care through the program.\n\nThe steady growth in the cost of the program is a concern for legislators. Last year the state and federal governments combined to spend $9 billion on the Arkansas Medicaid program. Federal funding accounts for 72 percent of the total, but in October that will go down to 71.14 percent. If Medicaid spending stays the same, this change will shift $55 million in costs from the federal government to the state.\n\nState spending on Medicaid has been dramatically increasing, both in total dollars and as a percentage of the overall state budget. From Fiscal Year 2018 to 2023 state funding of Medicaid rose by 41 percent. As a percentage of state general revenue spending it increased from 20 percent to about 23 percent.\n\nAccording to an analysis recently published by the department, there are several factors driving up the cost of Medicaid that state officials cannot control. For example, during the pandemic more people became eligible because they lost their jobs. Also, the federal government required states to keep people enrolled during the pandemic, which was a major reason that Arkansas Medicaid reached an overall high of 1.15 million people.\n\nStates have flexibility to determine eligibility for some medical procedures, but are required to pay for numerous mandatory benefits, such as inpatient and outpatient hospital services, home health and the cost of transportation to clinics and physicians’ offices.\n\nIn 2019 Medicaid spent an average of $6,046 per beneficiary. In 2023 that amount had gone up to $7,280.\n\nThe department’s 128-page analysis provides a list of options to lower costs, but does not make any recommendations. The legislature, the governor and the department will gather input from health care providers and beneficiaries before making any final decisions on which options, if any, the state will choose.\n\nThose decisions will require lengthy study because they will affect so many people’s access to medical care, and will influence how hundreds of millions of dollars are spent.\n\nCAMDEN POLICE AND OUACHITA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT ANSWER CALL REGARDING DOMESTIC DISPUTE\n\nAt approximately 2:51 AM Officers of the Camden Police Department responded to 1005 Fairview Road in reference to a domestic incident. A female victim was treated at the Ouachita County Medical Center for a cut/stab wound. A male resident of the house had barricaded himself in the residence and was believed to be armed with possibly a handgun and a sword. It was also reported that shots had been fired during the domestic incident. Entry was made by officers, assisted by members of the Ouachita County Sheriff’s Office. A 49-year-old white male was taken into custody without further incident. He was transported to the Ouachita County Detention Center pending further investigation and court proceedings. The victim was treated and released from the hospital. The investigation is on-going.\n\nCITY OF CHIDESTER TO RAISE WATER RATES\n\nThe City of Chidester has had a rate study done by the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission and have decided to raise the water rates and the sewer rated effective 8-1-2024.\n\nARKANSAS LAW ENFORCEMENT URGE DRIVERS TO STOP SPEEDING\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Arkansas Highway Safety Office are teaming up with Arkansas law enforcement to keep everyone on the road safe by raising awareness about the dangers of speeding and urging drivers to obey speed limits. From July 10 through July 31, Arkansas State Police Troopers, city police and sheriff’s deputies will be stopping drivers that violate Arkansas speed limit laws and will be issuing tickets as part of the Speeding Slows You Down high-visibility enforcement campaign.\n\nSpeeding can have real consequences for not only your wallet, but for your safety as well. In 2022, there were 12,151 fatalities in speeding-related crashes nationwide, accounting for 29% of total traffic fatalities. Young drivers and motorcyclists are especially susceptible to high speeds, and they represent the largest demographic involved in speeding-related vehicle crashes. In 2022, 35% of male drivers and 19% of female drivers in the 15- to 20-year-old age group involved in fatal traffic crashes were speeding. Thirty-five percent of all motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes in 2022 were speeding. Motorcycle riders 21 to 24 years old involved in fatal crashes had the highest speeding involvement at 51%. NHTSA and Arkansas law enforcement officers remind drivers that, no matter how experienced you are as a driver, ultimately, Speeding Slows You Down.\n\n“Speed limit signs are not suggestions. They are the law,” said Arkansas Public Safety Secretary Colonel Mike Hagar. “They are posted for the safety of the driver and others in and around the roadway. Unfortunately, we see people speeding every day. If you’re killed in a crash, or if you kill someone else, there’s no second chance. Speeding is not worth the risk.”\n\nMuch like impaired driving, speeding is a selfish choice that has deadly consequences for the driver, passengers, and other vulnerable road users, like pedestrians and bicyclists. Speeding reduces a driver’s ability to steer safely around another vehicle, a hazardous object, or an unexpected curve. Even the safest cars with the newest technologies are limited in reducing the odds of a crash and the injuries or death that may result.\n\nAccording to NHTSA, local roads are more dangerous than highways for speeders. It's a common misconception that speeding is an interstate-related issue: In fact, in 2022, 87% of all U.S. speeding-related traffic fatalities occurred on routes other than interstates. No matter the roadway type, driver’s age, or vehicle you are driving, speeding is dangerous for everyone involved.\n\n“We are asking our community to please slow down,” said Colonel Mike Hagar. “Our goal is to save lives, and we’re putting all drivers on alert — the posted speed limit is the law. No excuses.”\n\nFor more information, please visit www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding or call the Arkansas Highway Safety Office at (501) 618-8136, and go to https://www.tzdarkansas.org/ to learn about Arkansas’ Toward Zero Deaths campaign to eliminate preventable traffic fatalities.

The investigation led to the arrest of five individuals and the confiscation of nearly $40,000 in illegal funds.\n\n“I have long said that my office serves as a resource for law enforcement agencies across Arkansas, so I am proud to see my Special Investigations team help shut down these operations and bring these criminals to justice. I appreciate Bradley County Sheriff Herschel Tillman and Warren Police Chief Shaun Hildreth for inviting us to be part of this investigation, and I congratulate them on their good work.”\n\nAfter a months-long investigation during which probable cause was established that illegal gambling was taking place inside Que Lindo Michoacan in Warren and Spanky’s in Bradley County, warrants were executed at both locations Monday by the Bradley County Sheriff’s Office, the Warren Police Department, the Office of the Attorney General, Arkansas State Police, and the 10th Judicial Drug Task Force.\n\nAt Que Lindo Michoacan, Pablo Ceja, 32, of Warren was arrested and charged with one count of Keeping a Gambling House, a Class D felony, and one count of Gaming Devices-Prohibition, an unclassified misdemeanor. Authorities seized $15,000 and confiscated five electronic gambling machines.\n\nAt Spanky’s, Kaysie Miskell, 44, of Pine Bluff, Sandra Huntley, 41, of Kingsland, and Shony Penister, 36, of Warren, were all arrested and each charged with one count of Keeping a Gambling House. Keithron Gibbs, 39, of Warren, was arrested and charged with one count of Gaming Devices-Betting, a violation classified as neither a felony nor a misdemeanor. Authorities seized $24,150 and confiscated 41 electronic gambling machines.\n\nBIPARTISAN LEGISLATION INTRODUCED TO STUDY IMPACT OF CELL PHONES IN SCHOOLS\n\nWASHINGTON - Today, Reps. Bruce Westerman (AR-04), David Trone (MD-06), Jake LaTurner (KS-02), and Jason Crow (CO-06) introduced the Focus on Learning Act, bipartisan legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to complete a study on the effects of cell phone use in K-12 classrooms and its impact on students’ mental health and academic performance.\n\n“Any parent, teacher, or administrator can tell you that cell phones are the leading distraction and source of anxiety for students in school. Our Focus on Learning Act is a bipartisan solution to bridge the gap in data of the real-time effects of cell phone usage in schools so we can support local communities in alleviating those distractions and cultivating the best possible learning environment for our students,” said Congressman Westerman. “I’m proud to lead this bicameral effort with my friend and fellow Arkansan, Senator Cotton, and I look forward to continued collaboration on this important issue.”\n\n“Prioritizing student mental health is how we ensure young folks receive the best education possible. The Focus on Learning Act aims to do just that by conducting a study on cell phone use in schools,” said Congressman Trone. “By limiting cell phones in schools, we could also limit one of the main causes of stress and anxiety for students. In Congress, I’ll always work to ensure young people are set up for success.”\n\n“It is critical to the development of our children that we understand the impact that cellphones have on their mental health and academic performance,” said Congressman LaTurner. “The Focus on Learning Act will help ensure that schools are free of distractions that may hinder a student’s education.”\n\n\"As a Dad, I’m concerned about the impact of cell phone use on our kids' mental health and academic success,\" said Congressman Crow. \"Proud to lead the Focus on Learning Act with Rep. Westerman to research the effects of increased phone use and give our kids the best opportunity to succeed.”\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nSince 2012, test scores have steeply declined nationwide, presumably correlated with the increased presence of cell phones in schools.\n\nRecent students show that three-quarters of U.S. teens feel more happy/peaceful when they are away from their phones.\n\nAs research is being conducted in scholarly settings, there’s a gap in data on the real-time effects of cell phone usage in classrooms and its impact on the learning and mental health of students.\n\nFOCUS ON LEARNING SUMMARY:\n\nRequires the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to complete a study on the effects of cell phone use in K-12 classrooms on students’ mental health and academic performance.\n\nAuthorizes $5 million annually for the next five years for a pilot program that provides students with secure containers to store cell phones during school hours.\n\nThe pilot program will allow exceptions for students with health conditions, disabilities, and non-English speakers.\n\nParticipating schools will have a communication system in place to allow teachers, students, and administrators to communicate with local emergency responders in case of an emergency.\n\nU.S. Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) are cosponsors of the Senate companion Focus on Learning Act.\n\nCOTTON, BANKS: BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RULE DISCRIMINATES AGAINST FAITH-BASED FOSTER ORGANIZATIONS\n\nWashington, D.C. — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today introduced a resolution to remove a Health and Human Services (HHS) Department rule that would make it harder for faith-based organizations and families to provide homes for foster children. HHS finalized its rule in April.\n\nCongressman Jim Banks (Indiana-03) introduced the resolution in the House.\n\n“Faith-based groups lead the effort in Arkansas to provide safe foster homes. The Biden administration’s rule will only hurt children that need a home and the religious organizations that provide this incredibly important work,” said Senator Cotton.\n\n“Despite a nationwide shortage of foster families, the Biden administration’s rule discards well-established, faith-based care providers as second-class placement services, forcing states to invest time and resources into recruiting so-called gender-affirming providers. This is an attack on religious liberty and common sense, and worst of all, it is the children in need of a safe and loving home who will suffer most from this administration’s radical agenda,” said Congressman Banks.\n\nCOTTON DEMANDS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PROTECT AMERICANS’ DATA FROM SHEIN\n\nWashington, D.C. — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) yesterday sent a letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to take action against Shein, a Chinese fashion retailer that has ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Senator Cotton requested the Biden administration provide a plan to protect Americans’ data from Shein and identify whether Shein is complying with U.S. laws.\n\nIn part, Senator Cotton wrote:\n\n“As a large fashion retailer, Shien has access to a vast array of customer and supply chain data. And as a Chinese company, Shien is subject to national security laws that requires compliance with any request from the CCP to access that data. Allowing Shein to promulgate its technology within the U.S. will increase the risk that the CCP will gather data from U.S. businesses and use it for nefarious purposes.”\n\nFull text of the letter may be found below.\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nPresident Joseph R. Biden\n\nThe White House\n\n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW\n\nWashington, DC 20500\n\nDear President Biden:\n\nI write to urge your administration to take action to prevent the Chinese company Shein from selling potentially fraudulent supply-chain technology to U.S. companies.

The CCP would almost certainly use that data to subvert U.S. interests. This is unacceptable.\n\nPlease provide the following information no later than August 1, 2024:\n\nIs your administration tracking the possible sale of Shein supply chain software to U.S. companies? Have you taken steps to warn U.S. companies of the possible danger?\n\nHas your administration identified any instances of the CCP viewing or utilizing data gathered by Shein?\n\nAre Shein operations in the United States in compliance with all relevant data protection laws, regulations, and standards?
