        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Chancellor Daniel Ferritor and philanthropist Pat Walker will be presented with honorary degrees at the 2005 All-University Commencement, which will be held at 8:45 a.m. May 14 in Bud Walton Arena.\n\nHuckabee will receive an honorary doctorate of laws and deliver the 2005 commencement address. Ferritor, chancellor emeritus and professor of sociology, will receive an honorary doctorate of arts and sciences, and Walker, a long-time philanthropist in the state of Arkansas, will receive an honorary doctorate of humane letters.\n\nHuckabee took office July 15, 1996, following the resignation of Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, and became Arkansas' 44th elected governor after winning the November 1998 election with the highest percentage of the vote ever received by a Republican gubernatorial nominee in Arkansas. He won another four-year term in November 2002. He is recognized as a national leader in education and health-care reform.\n\nHuckabee chairs the Education Commission of the States, a highly respected education policy organization that helps governors, legislators, state education officials and others identify, develop and implement public policies to improve learning at all levels. He has served as president of the Council of State Governments and is currently vice chairman of the National Governors Association.\n\nHuckabee graduated from Ouachita Baptist University at Arkadelphia magna cum laude in 2 ½ years. He attended Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nHuckabee has pushed through reforms in Arkansas that expanded the availability of college scholarships, increased the number of charter schools and established new approaches to workforce education.\n\nHis Smart Start initiative placed a heavy emphasis on reading and mathematics for students from kindergarten through the fourth grade. He then created Smart Step, a similar emphasis for students from the fifth through the eighth grades. The governor is a noted speaker and author, addressing the subjects of politics and public policy before groups across the country and around the world. He appears regularly on national television and radio shows, discussing issues of importance to the states.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, his book, “Character Is The Issue,” was released by Broadman & Holman. The book chronicles Huckabee's political career and discusses the importance of character in politics and life. It was followed by two more: “Kids Who Kill,” which addresses issues of juvenile violence, and “Living Beyond Your Lifetime,” which examines how to establish a legacy that will live on after you're gone. He is married to Janet McCain Huckabee, who grew up in Hope, Ark., and with whom he has three children.\n\nKnown for his quick wit and willingness to listen, Dan Ferritor has been a stalwart of the UA campus for almost 30 years. Having led the university through more than a decade as chancellor from 1986 to 1997, his successful tenure laid the firm foundation for the university’s continued progress in the 21st century.\n\nAmong Ferritor’s crowning achievements is the leadership he provided during the renovation of Old Main, a fixture of the Fayetteville skyline and the symbol of the University of Arkansas. More than $13 million was collected for renovation efforts, and in 1991, the building was rededicated to use by future generations of students.\n\nFerritor’s influence is seen in numerous aspects of the UA campus. During his tenure, he engineered a $120 million building boom on campus that resulted in an additional 2 million square feet in classroom, laboratory and library space.\n\nAfter serving 11 years as Chancellor, Dr. Ferritor returned to the department of sociology to teach in fall 1998. As a testament to his commitment to education, Ferritor was awarded the University of Arkansas Alumni Association’s Faculty Achievement Award for Teaching and Research in 1984. As an expression of the university’s esteem, Ferritor was awarded the Chancellor’s Medal in 2000.\n\nIn March 2001, the University of Arkansas dedicated the Daniel E. Ferritor Hall, named in honor of a chancellor who became known by many as one of the U of A’s best cheerleaders.\n\nFerritor has served as a member of the board of directors of the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce, the United Way of Washington County and the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport Authority. He has served as chairman of the board for the Ozark Guidance Center, was the 2001 chair of the American Heart Association Walk for Northwest Arkansas, and is a trustee of the Harvey and Bernice Jones Charitable Trust.\n\nIn fall 2004, Ferritor was appointed the inaugural holder of the Bernice Jones Endowed Chair in Community.\n\nFerritor is married to Patsy Hoey Ferritor, with whom he has three children.\n\nPat Walker was raised in Tulsa, Okla. She met Willard Walker, her husband for 61 years, in Coffeyville, Kan., after moving there with her mother in 1942. Pat and Willard lived in several different towns before settling in Springdale to raise their two children, Patricia and Johnny Mike. Her seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren bring her great joy. She celebrates life and the pleasure of being with family and friends each day.\n\nPat and Willard created the Willard and Pat Walker Charitable Foundation in 1986. Since that time, their generosity has touched the lives of thousands of Arkansans. She is a member of the Foundation Board for the Arkansas Cancer Research Center, an active member of First Christian Church of Springdale and takes a role in overseeing the Walker Charitable Foundation. She follows Razorback sports closely, enjoying the spirit of the fans and the opportunity to share time with family and friends at sporting events.\n\nPat Walker has received awards in recognition of her philanthropy, including the 2002 American Heart Association Tiffany Award, the Distinguished Services Award from the Razorback Foundation and the UAMS Distinguished Services Award. She has been recognized as one of the Most Distinguished Women in Arkansas and was named to the Top 100 Women in Arkansas list by Arkansas Business in 1999.\n\nPat and the late Willard Walker were inducted into the Towers of Old Main in 2001 and honored as Chancellor’s Medal recipients. At the time, they had also been long-time members of the Chancellor’s Society. In 1996, the Pat Walker Theater was dedicated at Springdale High School. On Nov. 12, 2004, the Pat Walker Health Center was dedicated on the UA campus.\n\nPat Walker has focused on health and education in her state and her community for many years. Most recently, she contributed to the mission of the 2005 Komen Ozark Race for the Cure by being Honorary Chairperson along with her daughter-in-law, Debbie, and granddaughter, Clancy.\n\nDoors for the event open at 7:30 a.m. Commencement guests will enter Bud Walton Arena through the south entrance, accessible from Leroy Pond Drive.\n\nAll purses and camera cases will be inspected by the ushers.
