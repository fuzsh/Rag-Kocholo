        "text": "INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS\n\nStudents are expected to follow all policies established by the University of Arkansas System Board of Trustees, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health, and The Graduate School (if PhD student). Relevant policies are summarized below, with references to full policies that may be available in other locations. All policies are subject to revision.\n\n4+1 PROGRAM SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nStudents must have completed at least 72 credit hours of undergraduate coursework in order to be admitted to the 4+1 Master of Public Health program. Admitted 4+1 students must complete their undergraduate degree in order to graduate with a Master of Public Health degree from the COPH.\n\nACADEMIC INTEGRITY CODE, PRINCIPLES, POLICY & PROCEDURES\n\nAs a student enrolled in the COPH, you are subject to the Academic Integrity Code, Principles, Policy & Procedures.\n\nThe Honor Pledge you sign at enrollment documents your knowledge that you may not engage in, or facilitate engagement in, the following forms of academic misconduct1:\n\nThe definitions and descriptions of these terms can be found at https://policies.iu.edu/policies/student-code/index.html#scope.\n\n1 Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, & Conduct. Part II: Section B. Indiana University. Available at https://policies.iu.edu/policies/student-code/index.html#scope. Used with permission (IU Chief Policy Officer Mike Jenson 7/10/2023).\n\nACADEMIC PROBATION/DISMISSAL\n\nStudents enrolled in certificate or degree programs in the COPH who earn less than a 3.00 cumulative COPH grade-point average (GPA – rounded to the nearest 1/100th point) on nine (9) or more semester credit hours of course work applicable to their degree program, will be placed on academic probation. Students placed on academic probation must achieve a cumulative COPH GPA of 3.00 or higher upon or before the successful completion of the next nine (9) semester credit hours. The next nine (9) semester credit hours may be completed in one or more semesters. Upon achievement of a cumulative COPH GPA of 3.00 or higher, the student will be removed from academic probation.\n\nDismissal from the College will occur if the student’s cumulative COPH GPA is not raised to 3.00 at the end of the semester in which the student completes the final hour of the next nine (9) semester credit hours of course work approved by the student’s program. If, at the time a student is initially placed on academic probation, it is mathematically impossible for the student to raise her/his cumulative COPH GPA to 3.00 at the end of a semester in which he or she completes the final hour of the next nine (9) semester credit hours of course work, the student will be immediately dismissed from the College.\n\nA COPH student will be dismissed from further study at any time if her/his performance is determined to be unsatisfactory by either the program faculty or the Dean of the COPH. A determination of unsatisfactory performance may be based on academic dishonesty, an Academic Integrity Code violation, and/or failure to maintain a specified cumulative grade-point average. Policies regarding academic dishonesty and other Academic Integrity Code violations are described in the Academic Integrity Code, Principles, Policy & Procedures.\n\nStudents enrolled in a COPH doctoral program may be administratively dismissed from the doctoral program if the student fails to pass their respective qualifying exam or if they are unable to complete the program within the allotted time as specified in their respective departmental doctoral degree policies. In such cases, students are not academically dismissed from the COPH; they are administratively dismissed from the particular doctoral program to which they were admitted. Upon administrative dismissal, a student is eligible to apply to another COPH academic program (e.g. a doctoral program in another department).\n\nStudents academically dismissed are NOT eligible to regain student status within the COPH.\n\nACADEMIC PROGRESSION\n\nAs a general rule, good academic progress for a student taking coursework can be defined as completing six credit hours or more within an academic year.\n\nStudents who have not successfully completed at least one course within three (3) consecutive semesters will lose their active student status. Before being allowed to register again, masters or certificate programs students must contact the Office of Student & Alumni Affairs and the associate dean to request reinstatement, and doctoral students must contact their doctoral degree program director to request reinstatement.\n\nStudents who have not completed a minimum of three (3) credit hours during a period of two academic years will be dismissed from the COPH and must complete an application for readmission before being allowed to continue their studies.\n\nACCOMMODATION POLICY & STUDENT REQUEST FOR ACCOMMODATION FORM\n\nThe process regarding a Student Request for Academic Accommodations is outlined in UAMS Academic Affairs Policy 2.2.5.\n\nA copy of the policy can be found at: https://academicaffairs.uams.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/03/2.2.5-Student-Accommodation-Policy-2022.02.28.pdf\n\nThe Student Request for Accommodation Form can be found at: https://academicaffairs.uams.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/06/2.2.5a-Student-Request-for-Accommodation-Form-6_11_21.pdf\n\nADDING/DROPPING COURSES\n\nClass days start on the date listed on the academic calendar as the date the semester begins. For the purposes of dropping classes, the number of class days specified refers to the number of calendar days following the day on which classes started (exclusive of weekends and holidays) regardless of how many, if any, class sessions in a particular course were held.\n\nStudents must pay a late fee in order to register after formal registration closes, Students who do not register by the last published day of registration have five (5) class days after that date to complete the registration process when accompanied by the late fee. Students will not be allowed to register after that date unless permission is granted by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health. This applies to all students regardless of student status, date of first class meeting or class location. (For the purpose of late registration, the number of class days specified above refers to the number of calendar days following the days on which formal registration closes regardless of how many, if any, class sessions in a particular course were held.)\n\nA course may be dropped during the first 20 calendar days of a fall or spring semester without having the withdrawal shown on the official record. After the first 20 calendar days, and before the last 20 calendar days of a fall or spring semester, a student may drop a course, but a mark of “W”, indicating withdrawal, will be recorded. A student may not drop a course during the last 20 calendar days of a fall or spring semester.\n\nA course may be dropped during the first ten (10) calendar days of a summer session without having the withdrawal shown on the official record. After the first ten (10) calendar days and before the last ten (10) calendar days of a summer session, a student may drop a course, but a mark of “W” indicating withdrawal, will be recorded. A student may not drop a course during the last ten (10) calendar days of a summer session.\n\nDropping Weekend Courses\n\nA weekend course may be dropped at the end of the first class meeting but a mark of “W” indicating withdrawal will be recorded unless the first class meeting occurs within the first 20 calendar days of a fall or spring semester and/or the first 10 calendar days of a summer session.\n\nNOTE: Once a student has completed on-line registration, he or she must complete and provide to the Registrar a COPH Add/Drop Form in order to officially drop a course; otherwise, the course will remain on the transcript. This form is available on the COPH website at http://publichealth.uams.edu/students/current-students/forms/ .\n\nRefunds will NOT be given for dropped courses unless the course is dropped before the REFUND deadline as defined by the COPH Academic Calendar available at http://publichealth.uams.edu/students/current-students/academic-calendar/.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION\n\nApplication for graduation must be made to the Office of the University Registrar (OUR) and fees paid prior to the last official date of registration for the semester in which degree requirements will be completed and graduation effected. If a student fails to complete the degree, the student must contact the OUR concerning renewal of the application or withdrawal from the COPH. Clearance is required from certain UAMS offices (library, parking, etc.) before a student may receive her/his degree.\n\nAPPEALING A FINAL COURSE GRADE\n\nA student may appeal a final course grade that has been awarded for their academic performance. The appeal must be made within 30 days of the posting of the grade in the UAMS student information system. The appeal is made in writing to the faculty member who assigned the grade for the course. This faculty member will respond to the student within 30 days of the date of the appeal.\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nStudents are expected to be diligent in the pursuit of their studies and in their class attendance. Students have the responsibility of making arrangements satisfactory to the instructor regarding all absences. Such arrangements should be made prior to the absence, if possible. Policies of making up work missed as a result of absence are at the discretion of the instructor and students should verify the policies of their instructors at the beginning of each semester.\n\nAUDITING A COURSE\n\nWhen a student takes a course for audit, s/he must register, pay the appropriate fees, and be admitted to class on a space available basis. Instructors will notify students of the requirements for receiving the mark of “AU” for audited courses. If the student is not satisfying the requirements specified by the instructor, the instructor or Dean may drop a student from the course being audited. The student will be notified if this action is taken.\n\nThe cost for auditing is the same as taking classes for semester credit. The last day to change from audit to credit is the fifth (5th) calendar day of classes. Changing credit to audit must be done during the first one-half of the course.\n\nThe only successful grade or mark which may be given is “AU” and no course credit will be awarded. Courses completed with grades of “AU” are not counted towards completion of degree requirements.\n\nBIOLOGY COMPETENCY REQUIREMENT\n\nAll Graduate Certificate in Public Health and MPH students must satisfy the COPH Biology Competency requirement. Students with an undergraduate degree in biology or a closely related field (e.g. biochemistry, medicine, pharmacy, nursing) or who are currently enrolled in such a program automatically satisfy the requirement. For students without a life sciences degree who have taken undergraduate or graduate-level biology courses, the COPH Biology Competency Committee will determine if they have satisfied the requirement. Students who do not meet the biology competency requirements must successfully complete 3 biology competency exams before or during their first semester of enrollment with a score of 75% or higher. Students who do not pass one or more of the exams will be required to register for the 1-hour Biology course in each subject area in which they did not pass at the next available offering (Spring or Fall). Exams are given each semester – dates for the exams can be found on the COPH Academic Calendar. Students are allowed two attempts at each exam.\n\nStudents who do not pass all 3 exams in their first semester must register for the Biology course(s) related to the Biology exams that they did not pass, and will not be able to register for the Environmental and Occupational Health and Epidemiology core courses. If the student does not pass the Biology course(s) on the first attempt, then they may only register for the corresponding Biology courses in the next semester. Failure to pass one or more of the Biology courses on the second attempt may lead to dismissal from the MPH program. The Biology Competency courses do NOT count toward the curriculum requirements for the Graduate Certificate or MPH degree, as they are considered pre-requisite knowledge for Certificate and MPH students.\n\nCERTIFICATE AND DEGREE REQUIREMENTS\n\nCourse requirements for each of the post-baccalaureate certificates and the Master of Public Health, Master of Health Administration, Doctor of Public Health, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees offered by the COPH are detailed in the Program Planners. Listed below are other requirements of the COPH for the awarding of the certificates and degrees.\n\nCIVILITY POLICY\n\nThe Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health (COPH) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) is committed to operating in a manner that promotes mutual trust and public confidence. All members of the COPH community are responsible for sustaining the core values of this institution which includes integrity, respect, diversity, teamwork, creativity, and excellence and for integrating these values into teaching, research, community engagement, business practices, and other services. Ethical, appropriate and respectful conduct at all times is a fundamental expectation for every COPH community member. Further information is available athttp://publichealth.uams.edu/about-coph/coph-policies/.\n\nCPH EXAM POLICY\n\nAs of the Fall 2024 semester, all students beginning enrollment in the Master of Public Health degree program will be required to register for and must complete the Certification in Public Health (CPH) seminar (which requires taking the CPH exam) in the next regular semester after successfully completing the 6 MPH CORE courses. (Epidemiology I, Biostatistics I, Health Care Systems, Introduction to Public Health, Introduction to Health Behavior/Health Education, Introduction to Environmental Health Sciences).\n\nExample. Ms. Jones is in good academic standing after completing 3 MPH core courses in the Fall 2024 semester and the remaining 3 MPH core courses in the Spring 2025 semester. Ms. Jones must complete the CPH seminar (which requires taking the CPH exam) in the Fall 2025 semester.\n\nThe COPH will cover the cost of the first CPH exam attempt by issuing a voucher. If a student does not pass the CPH exam, retaking the exam is optional, in which case the student will be responsible for any rescheduling arrangements or re-testing fees. If the student passes the CPH exam, then upon graduation they will possess both a degree and a professional certification and may sign their name using both MPH and CPH.\n\nCONDUCT\n\nA student seeking a professional degree is considered to be a mature adult whose attitude, conduct, and morals are compatible with the functions and missions of UAMS as an educational institution. Each student is expected to comply with requests of University officials in the performance of their duties; to obey the laws of the city, state, and nation; and to refrain from conduct that would demean the ethics and integrity of the Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health. Unsatisfactory conduct may result in dismissal from the program.\n\nCONVOCATION CEREMONY\n\nThe Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health sponsors a Convocation ceremony for graduating students of all College programs and members of their families. This ceremony is typically scheduled on the morning of Commencement in May each year, and all graduates are encouraged to attend. Numerous awards are presented to students and faculty by peers, as well as awards to faculty by students.\n\nCREDIT HOUR CALCULATIONS\n\nThe COPH adheres to the Arkansas Department of Higher Education’s (ADHE) minimum requirements for credit hour production as defined at: https://static.ark.org/eeuploads/adhe/Whole_Board_Policy_10-01-15.pdf\n\nThe COPH requires a minimum of 15-17 hours of lecture or class time and 45-51 hours of outside preparation per semester credit hour for its didactic courses.\n\nCUMULATIVE GPA POLICY\n\nThe Cumulative COPH GPA will include all courses taken at UAMS since admission to the current COPH academic program. The Cumulative UAMS GPA will include all courses taken at UAMS. Both GPAs will include repeated courses.\n\nDEGREE REQUIREMENTS\n\nCourse requirements for each of the degrees offered by the College of Public Health are detailed in the Program Planners. Listed below are other requirements of the UAMS Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health for the awarding of the Graduate Certificate, Master of Public Health, Master of Health Services Administration and Doctor of Public Health degrees.\n\nTime Frame For Completion of Degree\n\nAll requirements for a Graduate Certificate, MS, or MHA degree must be satisfied within six (6) consecutive calendar years from the first registration (whether as a certificate or degree candidate, or a non-degree student) with the COPH.\n\nAll doctoral degree program requirements must be completed within ten (10) consecutive calendar years from the first registration in courses for the doctoral degree program. All doctoral programs have specific timelines with interim milestones. See doctoral program policies.\n\nAll MPH degree seeking students (MPH, MD/MPH, JD/MPH, MPS/MPH, PharmD/MPH, and AUD/MPH) are expected to complete all MPH degree requirements within eight (8) consecutive calendar years.\n\nDecision of Acceptance\n\nAn offer of acceptance to a certificate or master’s program is valid for a maximum of one calendar year from the admitted term of acceptance. Acceptance is defined as enrolling with the COPH. An applicant’s decision to accept, decline or defer entrance into the respective program must be communicated in writing to the appropriate program director(s) within the time period stated in the offer letter or the offer will become void. See doctoral degree program policies for specific time lines for acceptance into those programs\n\nGrade Point Average and Semester Credit Hours\n\nAll enrollments, original and repeated, will be shown on the student’s transcript and all grades earned are used to calculate the Cumulative UAMS Grade Point Average (GPA). All enrollments, original and repeated, and all grades earned at UAMS since admission to the current COPH academic program will be used to calculate the Cumulative COPH GPA.\n\nTo receive a degree, a candidate must present a minimum Cumulative COPH GPA of 3.00 at the time of requested graduation.\n\nSuccessful Completion of Individual Courses\n\nFor master’s and certificate programs, courses must be completed with a grade of “C” or above to be considered successfully completed. For doctoral degree programs, courses must be completed with a grade of “B” or above to be considered successfully completed. Only courses that are successfully completed will be used to count towards degree requirements. When a listed requirement for enrollment in a course includes completion of a prerequisite course, the prerequisite course must have been completed successfully.\n\nDegree Application\n\nFor students wishing to graduate at the end of a semester, a fully completed degree application must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the last official day of registration for that semester.\n\nCampus Clearance\n\nCompletion of the campus clearance procedures as directed by the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs is required prior to the awarding of the degree.\n\nDegree programs that are overseen through the Graduate School are subject to the rules and regulations of the UAMS Graduate School. Specific information may be found on their website at gradschool.uams.edu.\n\nEXIT PROCEDURES\n\nCompletion of the campus clearance procedures as directed by the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and is required prior to the awarding of the degree. Academic programs that are overseen through the Graduate School are subject to the rules and regulations of the UAMS Graduate School. Specific information may be found on their website at gradschool.uams.edu.\n\nPOLICY FOR FULL TIME STATUS FOR DOCTORAL STUDENTS\n\nStudents who have completed all requirements for the degree except for defending the final dissertation must continue to register for one or more semester credit hours for dissertation research each semester until the final dissertation has been successfully defended. The number of semester credit hours must reflect the amount of student and faculty effort devoted to dissertation activities during each semester. During this final stage of dissertation preparation, the College will recognize one semester credit hour of dissertation research as a full-time course load.\n\nCOPH GRADES AND MARKS\n\nFinal grades for courses are “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “F”. (No semester credit is earned for courses in which a grade of “F” is recorded.) A final grade of “F” shall be assigned to a student who is failing on the basis of work completed but who has not completed all requirements. The instructor may change an “F” so assigned to a passing grade if warranted by satisfactory completion of all requirements. For numerical evaluation of grades, “A” is assigned four (4) points for each semester credit hour of that grade; “B” three (3) points; “C” two (2) points; “D” one (1) point, and “F” zero (0) points.\n\nA mark of “I” (incomplete) may be assigned to a student who has not completed all course requirements if the work completed is of passing quality. An “I'” so assigned may be changed to a grade provided all course requirements have been completed within a maximum of twelve (12) weeks from the beginning of the next semester after receiving the “I” (Incomplete).\n\nHowever, a written and signed agreement between the student and the instructor shall supersede this policy. If the instructor does not report a grade within the twelve-week period, the “I” shall be changed to an “F”. Violation of such an agreement may result in a change of grade of “I” to “F” before the twelve-week deadline has passed, based on the dates agreed to by the student and instructor for completion of incomplete work. When the mark of “I” is changed to a final grade, this shall become the grade for the semester in which the course was originally taken.\n\nA mark of “AU” (Audit) is given to a student who officially registers and successfully completes a course for audit purposes\n\n(see auditing a course). The only successful grade or mark which may be given is “AU” and no course credit will be awarded. Courses completed with grades of “AU” are not counted towards completion of degree requirements. Instructors will notify students of the requirements for receiving the mark of “AU” for audited courses. If the student is not satisfying the requirements specified by the instructor, the instructor or associate dean may drop a student from the course being audited. The student will be notified if this action is taken.\n\nIf an instructor does not wish to award an “AU” to a student who enrolled for audit, the following procedure will be followed:\n\nIf the student had no other obligation than to attend lectures, a notation will be made that the course was “Not Completed.”\n\nIf the student and instructor had agreed on certain obligations to be fulfilled by the student, the instructor shall write a letter indicating the nature of the arrangements and stating that the student did not complete the obligations. A notation will be made on the Academic Transcript stating, “See letter in file.”\n\nFor courses designated to be graded on a Pass/Fail basis, “Pass” is given for a course for which a student did work of a passing quality. The grade of “Pass” allows semester credit toward a degree but no grade points are earned. A grade of “Fail” indicates the student did not do work of passing quality, and no semester credit or grade points are awarded. The COPH allows a maximum of three (3) semester credit hours of “Pass/Fail” course work, excluding capstone coursework (preceptorship and integration project), to count towards the minimum course requirements of an MPH degree.\n\nA mixing of course letter grades and the mark “Pass” or “Fail” is not permitted in post-baccalaureate courses and is not to be so reported on the Official Final Grade Report. If a letter grade is reported for any student on the Final Grade Report, then all students listed on that report must receive a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) or a mark of “I”. A change of grade (from “Pass” or “Fail” to a letter grade) is not permitted for courses in which “Pass” or “Fail” marks are reported.\n\nA mark of “In Progress” indicates that the student is currently enrolled in coursework for the semester. The mark “In Progress” gives neither semester credit nor grade points toward a degree. When the course(s) are completed, a grade is assigned for required semester credit hours only.\n\nA mark of “S” (Satisfactory) is assigned in courses such as special problems and research when a final grade is inappropriate. The mark “S” is not assigned to courses or work for which semester credit is given (and thus, no grade points are earned for such work). If semester credit is awarded upon the completion of such work, a grade or mark may be assigned at that time and, if a grade is assigned, grade points will be earned.\n\nA mark of “W” (Withdrawal) will be given for courses from which a student withdraws after the first twenty (20) class days and before the last twenty (20) class days of the semester or after the first ten (10) class days and before the last ten (10) class days of the summer session. (Class days start and end on the date listed on the academic calendar as the date the semester begins or ends. For purpose of dropping classes, the number of class days specified above refers to the number of calendar days following the day on which classes started or preceding the number of calendar days on which classes end (exclusive of weekends and holidays) regardless of how many, if any, class sessions in a particular course were held.)\n\nHONOR GRADUATES\n\nThe COPH recognizes students who graduate with an overall COPH GPA of 3.850 and above as ‘honor graduates’. The designation of ‘honors’ for commencement and convocation participation (and printing in commencement and convocation programs) are determined at the end of the semester prior to graduation. Honors for transcript entry are determined at the end of the final semester. Grades earned for the graduating term will be included in the determination of honors status.\n\nINTERPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENT\n\nAs of the Fall 2015 semester, all COPH degree-seeking students are required to complete the UAMS\n\nInterprofessional Education (IPE) Program prior to graduation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “Interprofessional Education occurs when two or more professions learn with, from and about each other to improve collaboration and the quality of care.”\n\nThe IPE Program is non credit hour earning and consists of several workshops and other activities. All aspects of the IPE Program must be completed prior to degree program completion as a condition of graduation.\n\nFor more information on IPE, please visit https://ipe.uams.edu/ or you may also consult the Office of Student and Alumni Affairs.\n\nKNOWLEDGE CREDIT FOR INTRODUCTION TO PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY\n\nStudents may apply for knowledge credit for PBHL 50033 Introduction to Public Health if they enter a COPH degree program after completing at least a bachelor’s degree in public health from a school or program that is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health.\n\nThe application for knowledge credit must be made to the COPH Office of Academic Affairs on a UAMS Petition for Course Substitution Form, with transcript attached showing the attainment of the requisite degree in public health.\n\nLEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\nThe Student Leave of Absence Policy is outlined in UAMS Academic Affairs Policy 2.2.10.\n\nA copy of the policy can be found at: https://academicaffairs.uams.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/08/2.2.10-Student-Leave-of-Absence-Policy-2022.07.26.pdf\n\nThe UAMS Student Leave of Absence Request Form can be found on the Registrar’s website at: https://registrar.uams.edu/our-forms/\n\nMASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH\n\nThe Master of Public Health (MPH) degree prepares students in the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through organized community outreach. Public health differs from other health programs in that it focuses on large population groups instead of individuals. It emphasizes promoting health and wellness as ultimate goals and prevention over cure.\n\nThe MPH degree requires a student to complete 42 semester credit hours within one of six available concentration tracks:\n\nBiostatistics\n\nEpidemiology\n\nEnvironmental and Occupational Health\n\nHealth Behavior and Health Education\n\nHealth Policy and Management\n\nClimate, Rural, and Global Health Public Health Practice (Online)\n\nEach student is required to declare a specialty track in SOPHAS and is assigned an initial academic advisor. Once the student is enrolled in the program, the student has the option to negotiate advisors and/or change programs, in which case the student must complete the Change of Advisor/Specialty Track form and officially file this change with the Office of the University Registrar (OUR).\n\nNON-DEGREE SEEKING STUDENTS\n\nIndividuals may be granted permission, at the discretion of the instructor and/or department, to enroll in classes as nondegree seeking students. Formal admission to the COPH certificate or degree programs is not required; however, students in this category must complete a non-degree seeking application to the COPH Office of Student & Alumni Affairs prior to each semester for which they are seeking non-degree status and are subject to the provisions of the section in the COPH Course Catalog titled “Non-Degree Seeking Students.”\n\nNon-degree seeking students generally will be allowed to enroll in courses on a space available basis once all degree seeking students have been placed on the class roster. It is important to note that in some instances, courses will be over-enrolled with degree candidates, and when this occurs, no non-degree seeking students will be able to enroll. The application fee will not be refunded.\n\nA student who has not been accepted in a program of study leading to a specific COPH certificate or degree may take no more than twelve (12) semester hours of COPH coursework that can be counted toward the requirements for a COPH certificate or degree.\n\nNON-DISCRIMINATION STATEMENT & GREIVANCE PROCEDURE FOR ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION\n\nThe COPH upholds the UAMS Non-Discrimination Statement, UAMS Academic Affairs Policy, 2.1.3..\n\nA copy of the policy can be found at: https://academicaffairs.uams.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2023/06/2.1.3-Non-Discrimination-Statement-2023.06.14.pdf\n\nGrievance Procedures for Alleged Discrimination are included in UAMS Academic Affairs Policy 2.2.1.\n\nA copy of the policy can be found at: https://academicaffairs.uams.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2023/11/2.2.1-Student-Grievance-Procedure-2023.11.17.pdf\n\nPLAGIARISM\n\nPlagiarism is a violation of the COPH Academic Integrity Code, Principles, Policy & Procedures.\n\nAdditional information can be obtained at: https://plagiarism.iu.edu/\n\nPROGRESSION BEYOND THE MPH CORE POLICY (Effective Fall 2024)\n\nStudents must complete the CPH Prep course after completing between 18 to 24 credit hours of course work which must include the 18 hour MPH core courses: PBHL 50033 Introduction to Public Health; BIOS 50133 Biostatistics; ENVH 51003 Environmental Health Sciences; HPMT 51033 The Health Care System; HBHE 51043 Health Behavior and Health Education; EPID 51103 Epidemiology I.\n\nPROGRESSION FROM GRADUATE CERTIFICATE TO GRADUATE DEGREE STATUS\n\nStandard process for transitioning from certificate programs to MPH (or MS for holders of the Graduate Certificate in Healthcare Data Analytics)\n\nA student with a bachelor’s degree who completes all courses in the specified graduate certificate program and wishes to progress to the corresponding graduate degree program must apply to the corresponding program and undergo an Admissions Committee review, using the same policies and procedures for all other applicants to COPH programs. The student will be expected to submit all required materials for admissions review for the degree program, including standardized test scores.

These include the planning, organization, and support of health promotion, disease prevention, and medical care. Basic to modern public health are the social sciences as well as the natural sciences–both in the United States and internationally.\n\nMembership in Delta Omega reflects the dedication of an individual to quality in the field of public health and to protection and advancement of the health of all people.
