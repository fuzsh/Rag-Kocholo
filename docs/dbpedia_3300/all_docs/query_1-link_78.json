        "text": "I was born and raised in East Tennessee. My first job was in a fast-food restaurant, and later on a construction crew. I was a B-minus student in high school, earned a B.S. degree at the University of Tennessee, and a master’s degree at the University of Wisconsin. My wife and I moved to Little Rock where I joined the University of Arkansas Extension Service as a communication specialist.\n\nFour years later, Riceland Foods, Inc., in Stuttgart, recruited me to be its first director of communications. I became a corporate officer, member of the senior management team, and senior vice president for corporate communications and public (government) affairs. Serving 37 years in the boardroom of Riceland, which became a Fortune 500 company, provided leadership experiences and world perspectives.\n\nI served on state and national association boards and committees, was elected chairman of Associated Industries of Arkansas, and president of the Stuttgart Chamber of Commerce and Stuttgart Rotary Club. I served on the board of visitors of Phillips Community College of the U of A., taught Sunday School for more than 20 years, and served in a number of church leadership positions.\n\nIn 2015, I enrolled in Dallas Theological Seminary where I discovered a calling in a new direction during a course titled Christian Mentoring and Coaching. Additional coursework helped me understand how much a guy needs a seasoned man to help guide him through life. I retired from Riceland in 2017 and finished my seminary degree in December 2020.\n\nOur highly mobile society means that many guys now live hundreds of miles from their nearest relative. Half of today’s men grew up in homes without their fathers being present. In another quarter of homes, the dad was present, but may not have had the experience or relationship with their sons that allowed them to discuss important career or life issues.\n\nI understand. That’s why I became a professional career and life coach for men. I want to help you or a man you know become all the man he was created to be and to do those things he was created to do. Man, you are worth it!"
