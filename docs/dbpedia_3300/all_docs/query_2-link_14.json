        "text": "Republican Representative (AR-3)\n\nKeep Don't-Ask-Don't-Tell; the policy has worked well\n\nThe candidates were asked whether they supported a repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, which bans openly gay troops. Lincoln, who was one of just two Democrats to join Republicans in a vote to block a recent repeal attempt, said the policy should be eliminated if that's what the military's top commanders recommend. \"I think it is important to listen to the military, to ensure that the military confirms that there is going to be no detriment to troop strength, to morale, to efficiency and effectiveness of our troops,\" if the ban is lifted, Lincoln said.\n\nBoozman said the policy should remain in place. \"I think the current policy has worked well,\" he said. \"We haven't had significant problems with it.\" This week, a federal judge in California issued an injunction that stops the military from enforcing the policy. An appeal is likely.\n\nSource: Boston Globe coverage of 2010 Arkansas Senate debate , Oct 13, 2010\n\nVoted NO on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nCongressional Summary:\n\nAmends the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) to add or expand definitions of several terms used in such Act, including :\n\n\"culturally specific services\" to mean community-based services that offer culturally relevant and linguistically specific services and resources to culturally specific communities;\n\n\"personally identifying information\" with respect to a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking;\n\n\"underserved populations\" as populations that face barriers in accessing and using victim services because of geographic location, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity; and\n\n\"youth\" to mean a person who is 11 to 24 years old.\n\nOpponent's Argument for voting No (The Week; Huffington Post, and The Atlantic): House Republicans had objected to provisions in the Senate bill that extended VAWA's protections to lesbians, gays, immigrants, and Native Americans. For example, Rep. Bill Johnson (R-OH) voted against the VAWA bill because it was a \"politicallymotivated, constitutionally-dubious Senate version bent on dividing women into categories by race, transgender politics and sexual preference.\" The objections can be grouped in two broadly ideological areas--that the law is an unnecessary overreach by the federal government, and that it represents a \"feminist\" attack on family values. The act's grants have encouraged states to implement \"mandatory-arrest\" policies, under which police responding to domestic-violence calls are required to make an arrest. These policies were intended to combat the too-common situation in which a victim is intimidated into recanting an abuse accusation. Critics also say VAWA has been subject to waste, fraud, and abuse because of insufficient oversight.\n\nReference: Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; Bill S. 47 ; vote number 13-SV019 on Feb 12, 2013\n\nVoted NO on prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nHR3685: Employment Non-Discrimination Act: Makes it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate against an individual on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation, including actions based on the actual or perceived sexual orientation of a person with whom the individual associates or has associated. Prohibits preferential treatment or quotas. Allows only disparate treatment claims. Inapplicable to associations that are exempt from religious discrimination provisions.\n\nProponents support voting YES because:\n\nRep. CASTOR: The march towards equality under the law for all of our citizens has sometimes been slow, but it has been steady. Over time, Congress has outlawed discrimination in the workplace, based upon a person's race, gender, age, national origin, religion and disability, because when it comes to employment, these decisions are rightly based upon a person's qualifications and job performance. This legislation that outlaws job discrimination based upon sexual orientation was first introduced over 30 years ago. A broad coalition of businesses and community organizations strongly support this landmark civil rights legislation, including the Human Rights Campaign; the Anti-Defamation League; and the NAACP.\n\nOpponents recommend voting NO because:\n\nRep. HASTINGS: Federal law bans job discrimination based on race, color, national origin, or gender. In addition, 19 States have passed laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I strongly oppose discrimination in the workplace. However, I do not think it is the place of the Federal Government to legislate how each and every workplace operates. A number of States have enacted State laws in this area. That is their right. Many businesses have chosen to adopt their own policies. That is appropriate as well. This bill as written would expand Federal law into a realm where PERCEPTION would be a measure under discrimination law [which I consider inappropriate].\n\nReference: Employment Non-Discrimination Act; Bill HR3685 ; vote number 2007-1057 on Nov 13, 2007\n\nVoted YES on Constitutionally defining marriage as one-man-one-woman.\n\nProposing an amendment to the Constitution stating: \"Marriage in the US shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.\"\n\nProponents support voting YES because:\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the American people support traditional marriage, marriage between a man and a woman. The people have a right to know whether their elected Representatives agree with them about protecting traditional marriage.\n\nEvery child deserves both a father and a mother. Studies demonstrate the utmost importance of the presence of a child's biological parents in a child's happiness, health and future achievements. If we chip away at the institution which binds these parents and the family together, the institution of marriage, you begin to chip away at the future success of that child.\n\nOpponents support voting NO because:\n\nThis amendment does not belong in our Constitution. It is unworthy of our great Nation. We have amended the Constitution only 27 times. Constitutional amendments have always been used to enhance and expand the rights of citizens, not to restrict them. Now we are being asked to amend the Constitution again, to single out a single group and to say to them for all time, you cannot even attempt to win the right to marry.\n\nFrom what precisely would this amendment protect marriage? From divorce? From adultery? No. Evidently, the threat to marriage is the fact that there are millions of people in this country who very much believe in marriage, who very much want to marry but who are not permitted to marry. I believe firmly that in the not-too-distant future people will look back on these debates with the incredulity with which we now view the segregationist debates of years past.\n\nReference: Marriage Protection Amendment; Bill H J RES 88 ; vote number 2006-378 on Jul 18, 2006\n\nVoted YES on making the PATRIOT Act permanent.\n\nTo extend and modify authorities needed to combat terrorism, and for other purposes, including:\n\nAssigning three judges to hear individuals' petitions concerning improper requests by the FBI for library circulation records, library patron lists, book sales records, book customer lists, and other records\n\nReporting every year the number of library records orders that are granted, modified, or denied\n\nAllows Internet service providers to disclose their subscribers information and the contents of their communications to a government entity, if they believe there is immediate danger of death or serious physical injury\n\nRequires that any court that allows a roving wiretap under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) must describe in great detail the intended target whose identity is not known\n\nAllows individuals and businesses to seek legal counsel if they have received a National Security Letter from the FBI requiring them to disclose financial information and records\n\nReference: USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act; Bill HR 3199 ; vote number 2005-627 on Dec 14, 2005\n\nVoted YES on Constitutional Amendment banning same-sex marriage.\n\nMarriage Protection Amendment - Declares that marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Prohibits the Constitution or any State constitution from being construed to require that marital status or its legal incidents be conferred upon any union other than that of a man and a woman. Reference: Constitutional Amendment sponsored by Rep Musgrave [R, CO-4]; Bill H.J.RES.106 ; vote number 2004-484 on Sep 30, 2004\n\nVoted YES on protecting the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nPledge Protection Act: Amends the Federal judicial code to deny jurisdiction to any Federal court, and appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, to hear or decide any question pertaining to the interpretation of the Pledge of Allegiance or its validity under the Constitution. Reference: Bill sponsored by Rep Todd Akin [R, MO-2]; Bill H.R.2028 ; vote number 2004-467 on Sep 23, 2004\n\nVoted YES on constitutional amendment prohibiting flag desecration.\n\nDesecration of Flag resolution: Vote to pass the joint resolution to put forward a Constitutional amendment to state that Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. Note: A two-thirds majority vote of those present and voting (284 in this case) is required to pass a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution. Reference: Resolution sponsored by Thomas, R-CA; Bill HJRes.4 ; vote number 2003-234 on Jun 3, 2003\n\nRated 14% by the ACLU, indicating an anti-civil rights voting record.\n\nBoozman scores 14% by the ACLU on civil rights issues\n\nThe mission of the ACLU is to preserve protections and guarantees Americas original civic values - the Constitution and the Bill of Rights:\n\nYour First Amendment rights-freedom of speech, association and assembly. Freedom of the press, and freedom of religion supported by the strict separation of church and state.\n\nYour right to equal protection under the law - equal treatment regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin.\n\nYour right to due process - fair treatment by the government whenever the loss of your liberty or property is at stake.Your right to privacy - freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into your personal and private affairs.\n\nWe work also to extend rights to segments of our population that have traditionally been denied their rights, including Native Americans and other people of color; lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgendered people; women; mental-health patients; prisoners; people with disabilities; and the poor. If the rights of societys most vulnerable members are denied, everybodys rights are imperiled.\n\nOur ratings are based on the votes the organization considered most important; the numbers reflect the percentage of time the representative voted the organization's preferred position.\n\nSource: ACLU website 02n-ACLU on Dec 31, 2002\n\nRated 0% by the HRC, indicating an anti-gay-rights stance.\n\nBoozman scores 0% by the HRC on gay rights\n\nOnTheIssues.org interprets the 2005-2006 HRC scores as follows:\n\n0% - 20%: opposes gay rights (approx. 207 members)\n\n20% - 70%: mixed record on gay rights (approx. 84 members)\n\n70%-100%: supports gay rights (approx. 177 members)\n\nAbout the HRC (from their website, www.hrc.org):\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign represents a grassroots force of more than 700,000 members and supporters nationwide. As the largest national gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization, HRC envisions an America where GLBT people are ensured of their basic equal rights, and can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.\n\nEver since its founding in 1980, HRC has led the way in promoting fairness for GLBT Americans. HRC is a bipartisan organization that works to advance equality based on sexual orientation and gender expression and identity.\n\nSource: HRC website 06n-HRC on Dec 31, 2006\n\nRated 36% by NAACP, indicating a mixed record on affirmative-action.\n\nBoozman scores 36% by the NAACP on affirmative action\n\nOnTheIssues.org interprets the 2005-2006 NAACP scores as follows:\n\n0% - 33%: anti-affirmative-action stance (approx. 177 members)\n\n34% - 84%: mixed record on affirmative-action (approx. 96 members)\n\n85%-100%: pro-affirmative-action stance (approx. 190 members)\n\nAbout the NAACP (from their website, www.naacp.org):\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has worked over the years to support and promote our country's civil rights agenda. Since its founding in 1909, the NAACP has worked tirelessly to end racial discrimination while also ensuring the political, social, and economic equality of all people. The Association will continue this mission through its policy initiatives and advocacy programs at the local, state, and national levels. From the ballot box to the classroom, the dedicated workers, organizers, and leaders who forged this great organization and maintain its status as a champion of social justice, fought long and hard to ensure that the voices of African Americans would be heard. For nearly one hundred years, it has been the talent and tenacity of NAACP members that has saved lives and changed many negative aspects of American society.\n\nSource: NAACP website 06n-NAACP on Dec 31, 2006\n\nAmend Constitution to define traditional marriage.\n\nBoozman co-sponsored amending Constitution to define traditional marriage\n\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years after the date of its submission by the Congress:<\n\nMarriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.\n\nRelated bills: H.J.RES.22, H.J.RES.74, H.J.RES.89\n\nSource: Marriage Protection Amendment (S.J.RES.43) 08-SJR43 on Jun 25, 2008\n\nRespect faith-based opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nBoozman co-sponsored respecting faith-based opposition to same-sex marriage\n\nCongressional Summary: The First Amendment Defense Act (FADA) prohibits the federal government from taking discriminatory action against a person on the basis that such person believes or acts in accordance with a religious belief or moral conviction that:\n\nmarriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or\n\nsexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage.\n\nLegal Argument Opposed: [Secular.org]: \"The stated purpose of FADA is to protect the tax-exempt status, government contract, or any other federal benefit of those who do not comply with the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ruling. This act's true impact would allow for sweeping, taxpayer-funded discrimination against same-sex couples and their children--all under the guise of religious liberty. FADA would completely eviscerate the historic nondiscrimination Executive Order that President Obama signed last summer that prohibits federal contractors from engaging in discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The First Amendment protects freedom of religion and freedom from religion, not the special privileges of the religiously affiliated at the expense of the fundamental rights of other Americans.\"\n\nPolitical Argument Opposed: [ACLU, July 20, 2015]: The House of Representatives & leading anti-LGBT organizations are pushing a bill--disingenuously titled the First Amendment Defense Act--that would open the door to unprecedented taxpayer-funded discrimination against LGBT people, single mothers, and unmarried couples. This bill would\n\nallow federal contractors, including those that provide homeless shelters or drug treatment programs, to turn away LGBT people\n\npermit a university to fire an unmarried teacher simply for becoming pregnant\n\npermit federal employees to refuse to process tax returns, visa applications, or Social Security checks for all married same-sex couples\n\nSource: H.R.2802 16-HR2802 on Jun 17, 2015\n\nClick here for definitions & background information on Civil Rights.\n\nClick here for a Wikipedia profile of John Boozman.\n\nClick here for a Ballotpedia profile of John Boozman.\n\nClick here for SenateMatch quiz answers by John Boozman.\n\nClick here for a summary of John Boozman's positions on all issues.\n\nClick here for issue positions of other AR politicians.\n\nClick here for issue statements from AR primary archives.\n\nClick here for issue statements from AR secondary archives.\n\nOther candidates on Civil Rights: John Boozman on other issues: AR Gubernatorial:\n\nAnthony Bland\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nFrank Gilbert\n\nJared Henderson\n\nLeslie Rutledge\n\nMark West\n\nMike Beebe\n\nMike Huckabee\n\nMike Ross\n\nRicky Dale Harrington\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nTim Griffin\n\nAR Senatorial:\n\nConner Eldridge\n\nCurtis Coleman\n\nFrank Gilbert\n\nJosh Mahony\n\nMike Beebe\n\nRicky Dale Harrington\n\nTom Cotton\n\nAR politicians\n\nAR Archives\n\nSenate races 2021-22:\n\nAK: Incumbent Lisa Murkowski(R)\n\nvs.Challenger Kelly Tshibaka(R)\n\nvs.2020 candidate Al Gross(D)\n\nAL: Incumbent Richard Shelby(R) vs.U.S. Rep.
