        "text": "Stephen Allen \"Steve\" Womack[2] (born February 18, 1957) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for Arkansas03 !Arkansas's 3rd congressional district since 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. Prior to his election to Congress, Womack was Mayor of Rogers, Arkansas.\n\nEarly life, education, and business career[]\n\nWomack was born in Russellville, Arkansas, the son of Elisabeth F. (Canerday) and James Kermit Womack.[3] He spent most of his childhood in Moberly, Missouri; but moved back to Russellville at the age of 16 and graduated from Russellville High School in 1973. He graduated from Arkansas Tech University in 1979. Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the Arkansas Army National Guard. He served for 30 years, retiring in 2009 as a colonel. Womack's father founded KURM-AM-FM in 1979, and Womack served as station manager from 1979 to 1990. He then served as executive officer of the Army ROTC program at the University of Arkansas from 1990 to 1996, then joined Merrill Lynch as a financial consultant.\n\nMayor of Rogers[]\n\nIn 1998, Womack was elected mayor of Rogers, the ninth largest city of Arkansas. He ousted 17-year incumbent John Sampier Jr. A major issue in the city was illegal immigration. The organization Americans for an Immigration Moratorium attacked Sampier for being a pro-immigration liberal. Womack pledged to get tough on illegal immigrants saying \"If you're coming to America illegally, you don't want to come to Rogers.\" The city had a growing Hispanic population, where it made 20% of the population, according to the 2000 Census. A year after the election, the National Council of La Raza awarded Sampier for his courage in helping out Hispanic Americans.\n\nIn 1999, Womack had two agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service assigned to the Rogers Police Department. As a result, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) filed a class-action suit against the city policeforce for racial profiling.[4]\n\nIn 2002 and 2006 Womack won re-election unopposed.[5]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives[]\n\nElections[]\n\n2010\n\nSee also: United States House of Representatives elections in Arkansas, 2010#District 3\n\nIn late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Republican John Boozman gave it up to run for the United States Senate. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next congressman. He ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold.[6] In the June runoff, he defeated State Senator and fellow Rogers resident Cecile Bledsoe 52%-48%.[7]\n\nIn the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.[8]\n\n2012\n\nSee also: United States House of Representatives elections in Arkansas, 2012#District 3\n\nWomack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his re-election bid. However, on July 8, Aden withdrew from the race after admitting to exaggerating his military record. As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that late date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November.[9] He won re-election to a second term with 76% of the vote.[10]\n\nTenure[]\n\nOn February 14, 2013, Womack sponsored H.R. 684, the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, a bill that would allow states to charge and collect sales taxes on internet purchases.[11] Supporters say the bill will create a \"level playing field\" between online retailers and brick and mortar retailers,[12] while opponents argue that the bill would increase the power of the states, threaten consumer privacy, increase taxes, and hurt small businesses.[13][14][15]\n\nCommittee assignments[]\n\nCommittee on Appropriations\n\nSubcommittee on Financial Services and General Government\n\nSubcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies\n\nRepublican Study Committee\n\nCaucus memberships[]\n\nInternational Conservation Caucus\n\nShutdown Caucus\n\nElectoral history[]\n\nArkansas03 !Arkansas's 3rd congressional district: Republican Primary Results 2010 Year Candidate Party Votes Pct Candidate Party Votes Pct 2010 Steve Womack Republican Party 18,290 51.75% Cecile Bledsoe Republican Party 17,048 48.24%\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nCongressman Steve Womack official U.S. House site\n\nWomack for Congress\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nProfile at Project Vote Smart\n\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\n\nLegislation sponsored at The Library of Congress"
