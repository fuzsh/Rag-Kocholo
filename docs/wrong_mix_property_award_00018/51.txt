Max Theodor Felix von Laue (9 October 1879 â€“ 24 April 1960) was a German physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914 for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals. He was strongly opposed to Nazism. In addition to his scientific endeavors with contributions in optics, crystallography, quantum theory, superconductivity, and the Theory of Relativity, he had a number of administrative positions which advanced and guided German scientific research and development during four decades. He was instrumental in re-establishing and organizing German science after World War II. He was taken into custody in 1945 by the Allied Forces.

Max von Laue in The Man With the Iron Heart[]

Max von Laue (1879-1947) was one of several scientists captured by the German Freedom Front in 1946.[1] It had been Reinhard Heydrich's hope that the scientists might build the GFF an atomic bomb. Karl Wirtz disabused Heydrich of that notion.[2]

Nonetheless, von Laue and his fellows were held in the underground Alpine Redoubt until 1947. When American forces arrived, Heydrich escaped, and ordered von Laue and several other scientists killed.[3]

Von Laue isn't specifically named in the text, but there are several references to the group of ten scientists. There is no reason to think that the Point of Divergence somehow changed the composition of the group.
