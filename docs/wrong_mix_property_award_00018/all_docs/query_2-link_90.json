        "text": "International Year of Crystallography\n\nIt all started in 1912 when Max Von Laue developed the hypothesis that crystals might diffract waves if the wavelength is of the same order of magnitude as the crystalline periodicity and that X-rays might be suitable for that particular purpose. Knipping and Friedrich constructed an experimental apparatus to test the hypothesis by directing X-rays at a crystal of copper sulfate and were able to record the first X-ray diffraction pattern. Von Laue was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1914 for this discovery, which by many is considered to be one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of science. Today X-ray crystallography has become the backbone for all sciences describing the material world around us and it is vital for the development of almost all new materials.\n\nThe International Year of Crystallography 2014 (IYCr2014) commemorates 100 years of X-ray diffraction with the major objective to increase public awareness of crystallography and how it supports most technological developments in our modern society. IYCr2014 will have a strong educational component targeted at students of all ages. Focus will be put on providing training in countries that do not have a large crystallographic community. The IUCr has arranged many activities, workshops and schools to provide such training and will organize schools in Africa, South America and Asia. Travelling exhibitions with fully functional X-ray diffractometers for student use are planned, in Africa, Asia and Latin America in collaboration with Bruker as a major instrument manufacturer. Bruker enthusiastically supports many IYCr2014 activities.\n\nBruker has always been a supporter of the global crystallography community and we are especially pleased to continue this commitment as a proud global partner of the IYCr2014."
