This was the first of a long series of experiments which Rubbia performed in the field of Weak Interactions and which culminated in the observation of the charged and neutral intermediate vector bosons, believed to be the mediators of such a force. From 1970 to December 1988 Rubbia spent one semester each year at Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts), where he was Higgins Professor of Physics. He performed experiments with different accelerators in the United States (Fermilab, near Batavia, Illinois, and Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, NY) and with the three major accelerators of CERN, the European Laboratory of Particle Physics, near Geneva, Switzerland (the Synchro-Cyclotron, the Proton Synchrotron and the Super Proton Synchrotron). Early in 1983 at CERN, an international team of more than 100 physicists headed by Rubbia, known as the UA1 Collaboration, detected the intermediate vector bosons, a triplet of particles, the W+, the W- and the Z0, which had become a cornerstone of modern theories of elementary particle physics, long before they were observed by Rubbia and collaborators. They are believed to carry the weak force that causes radioactive decay in the atomic nucleus and controls the combustion of the Sun, just as photons, massless particles of light, carry the electromagnetic force which causes most physical and biochemical reactions. To achieve energies high enough to create the intermediate vector bosons (particles roughly one hundred times as heavy as the proton), Rubbia proposed, with David Cline and Peter McIntyre, the use of a beam of protons and a beam of antiprotons, their antimatter twins, counter-rotating and colliding head-on. These revolutionary techniques were developed with Simon van der Meer, with whom Rubbia shared the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics. Rubbia was one of the leaders in a collaboration effort based deep in the Gran Sasso Laboratory designed to detect any sign of decay of the proton. The experiment seeks evidence that would disprove the conventional belief whereby matter is stable. The experiment, known as ICARUS and based on a new technique of electronic detection of ionizing events in ultra-pure liquid Argon, is now operational at the University of Pavia, awaiting its transfer to the Gran Sasso Laboratory. More recently he proposed the concept of an Energy Amplifier - a novel and safe way of producing nuclear energy exploiting present-day accelerator technologies, which is actively being studied worldwide in order (1) to incinerate high activity waste from accelerators and (2) to produce energy from natural thorium and depleted uranium. The energy resources which potentially could derive from these fuels will be practically unlimited and comparable to those from Fusion. His activities are presently concentrated on the problem of energy supply for the future."
