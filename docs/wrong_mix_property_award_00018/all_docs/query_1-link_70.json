Lawrence Bragg received the physics prize together with his father William Bragg with whom he had a productive scientific collaboration. For a long time however, by being part of a father-and-son team Lawrence was not always recognised in his own right for his seminal work in formulating the law that helped give birth to the scientific field of X-ray crystallography. In October 1913 for example – shortly after Lawrence’s law was published – the prestigious Solvay conferences in Belgium on 'The structure of matter' saw his father invited, but not him. Instead, Lawrence received a postcard signed by famous participants (including past and future Nobel Prize laureates) like Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Max von Laue, Hendrik Lorentz, Ernest Rutherford, congratulating him for \"advancing the course of natural science.\" When the Braggs were both awarded the Barnard Medal in the spring of 1915, Rutherford wrote to William Bragg expressing that: \"It is very early for your boy [Lawrence] to be getting these distinctions.\" Fast forward a few months and Lawrence Bragg made Nobel Prize history. The father and son duo were awarded the 1915 physics prize. Lawrence was then 25 years old. Learn more: https://bit.ly/2wgY5NN"
