Debra Messing’s split from husband of 10 years Daniel Zelman has been nothing but amicable, and that’s good seeing as she’s now dating her “Smash” co-star Will Chase. The former “Will and Grace” actress and Chase, a veteran stage actor who also played Pat Mahoney on FX’s “Rescue Me,” have been an item for about six weeks, a source told People. Chase, 41, recently separated from his wife, Broadway actress Stephanie Gibson.
