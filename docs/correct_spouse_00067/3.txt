Actress Debra Messing is dating Will Chase, her co-star in the NBC musical drama “Smash,” a report says. This news comes just nine days after Messing announced that she had been separated for months from her husband of 10 years, Daniel Zelman.

A “Smash” insider confirms to People that Messing and Chase have been a couple for about six weeks.

“It all happened very fast and it’s a difficult situation,” says the source.

Further complicating the situation is the fact that Messing and Zelman are still living under the same roof in New York, to better care for their 7-year-old son, Roman.

But Chase may be more understanding of complicated situations than most. He recently separated from his wife, Broadway actress Stephanie Gibson. His rep confirmed today that the two are getting divorced.

“Smash,” which also stars Anjelica Huston and Katharine McPhee of “American Idol,” premieres on NBC on Feb. 6.
