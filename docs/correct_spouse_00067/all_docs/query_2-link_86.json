        "text": "Not Just Teammates,\n\nbut Lifelong Friends\n\nTheron Alcazar, Management Trainee, Texas Tech Graduate\n\nHajoca has an amazing culture, and one of the perfect ways of showing that is through the trips I’ve gone on throughout the MDP program. I have had the pleasure of visiting several different locations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin to gain knowledge and experience from established managers with my teammates. Each and every one of those visits allowed me to build individual relationships with teammates across the entire state!\n\nEvery location we visited gave us knowledge from different perspectives on how to become a successful leader and what it takes to build an amazing team and Profit Center. On those visits we also had the pleasure of being able to go out and experience the town and get to know one another on a personal level while building a working relationship as well. After every trip, I didn’t just leave with new experiences and knowledge; I left knowing that I always had a connection in that area when I came back. Today, I’m able to connect with multiple teammates in virtually every metroplex in Texas. Hajoca didn’t just introduce me to new co-workers on these trips, they enabled me to make lifelong friends and a connection where we can reach out to one another any time we need it!\n\nIt’s Not Just Toilets!\n\nNick Beckman, Management Trainee, Texas A&M Graduate\n\nDuring my program, I have spent most of my time calling on and servicing mechanical/industrial contractors in the PVF segment of our business. With these types of contractors and selling in that space, we get to be a part of some pretty cool jobs. Some of those projects include the new Texas Ranger Ball Park in Arlington, Winstar Casino, and the new Tesla factory in Austin. One of the coolest jobs I got to see firsthand was a data center in Dallas called the Info Mart. The Info Mart is a data warehouse center where companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook rent servers to hold their data in the cloud. One of our account managers had just finished building out a new server room in the Info Mart. He was about to do the job’s last walk through and invited me to tag along to see the finished data center. It was just like you see in the movies. Servers lined out the whole room, stacked all the way to the ceiling with wires running everywhere. The customer showed us where they had run all their coolant lines to keep the servers from overheating. He even showed us the entire emergency piping system on the roof in case the system was to ever go down. It was by far the coolest day on the job for me seeing the cloud in real life!\n\nIt’s All About the People!\n\nChris Greene, Management Trainee, Oklahoma State Graduate\n\nMoving from college into the professional world may be one of the toughest transitions individuals have to make. From no longer having summers and month-long Christmas breaks off while also being separated from many friends, life can seem significantly less exciting than it did just a few short months or years ago when you were back in college.\n\nAt Hajoca, I was promised that the people are what make the business and industry special. In the few short months I’ve been here, my teammates in Tomball have already become friends that I spend time with outside of work. Throughout the 4-year program, Hajoca also provides trainees opportunities to keep in touch with each other through sales training workshops, summer retreats, vendor trips, and week-long visits to other profit centers. Even though my fellow trainees are spread across the state and the southern region, we keep in touch with these visits and calling each other weekly.\n\nWhen traveling, both for business and personal reasons, I always try to a grab a bite to eat when in town with other trainees. I have noticed that many profit center managers (PCM’s) have built personal relationships with other PCM’s that transcend Hajoca. But, it’s not just trainees and teammates that become close friends through the journey with Hajoca. The foundation of the plumbing industry is personal relationships. Many plumbers and contractors are second, third, or even fourth generation in their trade. These individuals grow up at the supply house as an apprentice in their teens and if treated right, come back for decades. Spending so much time daily with customers, you learn their sons’, daughters’, and spouse’s names, their hobbies, and their passion for the business. Some even become friends with personal relationships; for example, I am coaching a basketball team with one of our customers.\n\nNobody grows up and wants to be in the plumbing industry. Nobody especially enters college and expects to be in the plumbing industry when they graduate. But, I can assure you that the industry is not what matters. What matters the most are the people inside the business and industry that you work in, and the plumbing industry is defined by down-to-earth individuals willing to invest in the people who work hard and are willing to learn.\n\nThe Winning Team & Having Fun!\n\nZach Kallus, Management Trainee, Texas A&M Graduate\n\nBack in July of 2021, I had the pleasure of attending Hajoca’s Management Development Program Summer Fling just outside of Belton, TX. At this event, Management Trainees from all across our South-Central Division gathered for a couple days of fun, learning, and networking. This event served as a great “kickoff” event for many trainees who recently started the program after graduating in the spring. Our Division Manager, Region Managers, Recruiting Manager, and recruiters from across the division were all in attendance to take part in the fun. This was an awesome opportunity to begin building a solid network within the company and pick the brains of some of the brightest minds in business.\n\nSome of the fun at the event included playing pool, kickball, and cornhole along with doing several different teambuilding activities including a game called survivor. This allowed everyone the chance to get to know each other better while also working on developing skills that will be very helpful going forward in the program. I know I personally made many connections that appear to be turning into lifelong friendships.\n\nIn addition to several learning sessions, there was both a Management Trainee Graduate Roundtable and Division Manager/Region Manager Roundtable event. During these Q&A sessions, I learned about our goals as a company along with the current challenges we face and what it takes to be successful in our industry. I also gained valuable insight into what exactly the training program looks like and what it takes to ultimately be successful as a trainee. Straight talk is one of Hajoca’s core values and it was definitely seen throughout these sessions. Overall, my greatest takeaway from the event is the fact that Hajoca consistently wins across the board because of the quality of people who make up our wonderful team. I have never seen a company who follows their core values as closely as Hajoca does; nor have I seen a company who spends as much time and resources hiring the right people. This thought crossed my mind time and time again throughout the event. It truly is comforting knowing that I found my second family at Hajoca, and even more comforting knowing that I will always be a part of THE WINNING TEAM."
