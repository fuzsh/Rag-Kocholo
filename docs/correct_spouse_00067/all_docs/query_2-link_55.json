He also enjoys teaching at the undergraduate level on subjects ranging from Public Speaking to Organizational Communication to Interpersonal Communication.\n\nDr. Leemanâs action research focuses on bridging the gaps of difference - especially the huge socially created differences of class and race.Â His passion is investigating the contexts of non-dominant people and discourses in order to empower the human spirit and bring about more equitable and effective organizing. He hopes to continue on a lifelong personal, academic, and humanistic quest to learn the discursive languages of poverty in order to serve a variety of stakeholders. His research aims at better understanding the challenges inherent in the cultural, communicative, and organizing differences between those in the middle class and those struggling with poverty, so that the later are more fully empowered to enter into and be successful at work, at school, as well as in health care and criminal justice settings. Among his core driving tenants is thatÂ separationÂ leads to what Mikhail Bakhtin dubbed âabsolute death â being unheard and unrecognized,â and that such separation does not lead to effective organizing, society, nor relationships. Better understanding of communication is the path to the cure.\n\nBradley Libis\n\nPart-Time Faculty*\n\n859-572-5436\n\nlibisb1@nku.edu\n\nBio\n\nPersonal\n\nBrad is originally from Cincinnati and went to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he got his Bachelor's degree in Broadcast Journalism and Master's in Media Arts & Technology.
