        "text": "Will Chase, who plays Billy’s older brother Tony in Billy Elliot, married actress Stephanie Gibson on November 15 on the stage of the Hudson Theatre. Rev. Rich Teeters, a nondenominational Christian minister, officiated.\n\nThe couple met during a production of Aida in St. Louis in 2006. Gibson was the understudy for The Lady of the Lake at the end of the run of Spamalot on Broadway and played the national tour of the recent revival of A Chorus Line. In addition to Billy Elliot, Chase’s Broadway credits include The Story of My Life, Rent (he was the final Roger in the Broadway cast of the show), High Fidelity, Lennon, Aida, The Full Monty and Miss Saigon.\n\nThe 24-year-old bride is a native of Houston, Texas, and in keeping with that state’s tradition for doing things in a big way, the wedding was a sprawling affair. Gibson, who was resplendent in an Oscar de la Renta gown, had seven bridesmaids dressed in Vera Wang. The 39-year-old bridegroom, a native of Kentucky, was accompanied down the aisle by his daughters, Daisy and Gracie. His best man was Broadway veteran Charlie Pollack, who most recently appeared on the Great White Way in the musical 9 to 5.\n\nThe wedding was attended by a bevy of theater folks, including many of Chase’s Billy Elliot co-stars. After the ceremony, guests enjoyed cocktail hour in the lobby while the theater was transformed with tables for a seated dinner. The evening’s entertainment included the groom serenading his new wife with a rendition of Elvis Costello's \"She.\""
