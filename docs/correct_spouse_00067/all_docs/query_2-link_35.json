        "text": "Mel Gibson has two daughters, Hannah and Lucia, and seven sons, Christian, Edward, William, Louis, Milo, Thomas and Lars\n\nBetween his professional projects, Mel Gibson has kept busy with his nine children: daughters Hannah and Lucia and sons Christian, Edward, William, Louis, Milo, Thomas and Lars.\n\nAfter a few years of dating, Mel married Australian dental nurse Robyn Moore on June 7, 1980. They welcomed their first and only daughter, Hannah, the same year, followed by six sons: Edward, Christian, William, Louis, Milo and Thomas. In 2009, Moore filed for divorce after nearly 29 years of marriage.\n\nAfter separating from Moore, Mel began dating Russian songwriter and pianist Oksana Grigorieva. The pair welcomed their daughter, Lucia, in 2009.\n\nIn early 2010, Mel and Grigorieva parted ways. Their split was followed by a tumultuous custody and legal battle, which included allegations that Mel had assaulted Grigorieva. He began dating equestrian and screenwriter Rosalind Ross in 2014, and they welcomed his ninth child, Lars, in 2017.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Mel Gibson’s nine children: Hannah, Christian, Edward, William, Louis, Milo, Thomas, Lucia and Lars.\n\nHannah Mae Brobst, 43\n\nMel and Moore welcomed their first child, Hannah Mae, on Nov. 24, 1980, in Australia. Mel wasn’t present for her birth, as he was in Egypt filming Gallipoli — but he tuned in over the phone.\n\nIn 2000, Hannah worked as a production assistant on the set of her father’s movie The Patriot and as a makeup artist on his film What Women Want.\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2006, Hannah married the Grammy-nominated blues guitarist Kenny Wayne Shepherd. The traditional Catholic ceremony was performed in Latin at Holy Family Catholic Church, which was built by her father, in Agoura Hills, California. The couple have six children.\n\nHannah's Instagram bio describes her as a \"mother,\" \"wife\" and \"hypnobirth educator.\" She also shares about her passion for hoop dancing on her account.\n\nChristian Gibson, 42\n\nMel and Moore’s twin sons, Christian and Edward, were born in Australia on June 2, 1982. Christian attended the University of Colorado.\n\nChristian has worked on several TV series and movies as a camera operator, including his father’s films Hacksaw Ridge and Daddy’s Home 2.\n\nAccording to his Instagram, Christian lives between Los Angeles and Mexico City and enjoys working outdoors.\n\nEdward Gibson, 42\n\nMel and Moore welcomed Edward on June 2, 1982, in Australia. He is more private than some of his siblings and is not involved in the film industry. According to 90265 Magazine, Ed studied at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, where he majored in glass blowing.\n\nHis business, Natural Edge, sells art and furniture made from reclaimed wood slabs imported from Fiji. Edward was inspired to start the interiors company after living for two years on a remote Fijian island.\n\nWilliam “Will” Gibson, 38\n\nMel and Moore welcomed their son William “Will” in 1985. Despite his father's fame, Will leads a private life.\n\nHis younger brother Milo celebrated Will on National Siblings Day in 2019 with a carousel of photos of his siblings. “Happy national sibling day,\" he wrote in the caption. \"You have no idea how long this took me. Family is for life keep them close they are the ones that hopefully stick around.”\n\nLouie Gibson, 35\n\nLouie was born to Mel and Moore in Australia in 1988. In 2011, he earned his film degree from Chapman University in Orange, California. Louie has directed horror films including Happy Hunting and Manifest West.\n\nIn 2016, the filmmaker married The Americans actress Annet Mahendru, who also starred in his film Manifest West. They share at least one child together. In November 2022, the couple told The Bare Magazine that they had a healthy working relationship. “I’ve gotten to see Annet transform so many times over the years,” Louie told the outlet. “I would say we trusted each other. Which we already have in our personal life. I guess that carries over. I hope to work with Annet till the end of my road.\"\n\nMahendru added: “There isn’t anyone else in the world who puts me at ease the way Lou does. On our first date we said we’d have 10 kids together — I think we meant kids and movies!”\n\nMilo Gibson, 33\n\nMel and Moore welcomed Milo on Nov. 16, 1990, in Australia. After graduating from high school in Malibu, California, Milo worked as a massage therapist. Years later, he worked as an electrician before following in his dad’s footsteps and pursuing a career in acting.\n\n“It’s very scary to make that change,” Milo told PEOPLE of his career pivot in 2017. “But one day it hit me that I don’t want to turn 50 and regret not trying something I have a passion for.”\n\nHe worked with his dad on Hacksaw Ridge and his older brother Louie directed him in Manifest West. Milo said of working with his father: “We had a lot of fun, but it was a professional relationship. It was amazing watching Mel direct; he’s pretty damn good at it.”\n\nThomas Gibson, 25\n\nThomas was born in L.A. on April 14, 1999, and is Mel and Moore’s youngest child. Of his siblings, he was the only minor when his mother filed for divorce in April 2009. Since his parents' split, Thomas has kept his life private.\n\nLucia Gibson, 14\n\nMel and Grigorieva’s daughter Lucia was born on Oct. 30, 2009, in L.A.\n\nGrigorieva’s pregnancy announcement came only six weeks after Moore filed for divorce from Mel after 29 years of marriage. Mel and Moore had been separated since 2006.\n\nIn 2022, Grigorieva released a music video for her single \"Lemonade\" which featured the mother-daughter duo dancing together. \"It relays the story of some challenging times in my past and the person who was there for me every step of the way, with her unconditional purity, devotion and love. That person is my daughter Lucy, an inspiration of my life,\" the singer wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe same year, Lucia and her mom traveled to Manawaiopuna Falls in Hawaii to visit the waterfalls shown in Jurassic Park.\n\nIn 2023, Grigorieva showed off one of Lucia's drawings on Instagram, writing in the caption, \"My daughter’s drawing, depicting on the global vibrational sensations 💙.\"\n\nLars Gerard Gibson, 7\n\nLars Gerard, Mel’s ninth child and Ross’ first, was born on Jan. 22, 2017, in L.A.\n\n“They’re thrilled and Lars is adorable,” a source shared with PEOPLE.\n\nEarlier, in September 2016, Mel and Ross announced they were expecting their first child together.\n\n“Mel and Rose are so excited about the baby,” a friend close to the couple told PEOPLE at the time. “Mel loves being a dad and he and Rose can’t wait to be parents together. The last two years have been some of his happiest years he’s ever had.”\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
