        "text": "This has been a heart breaking few weeks. Final interviews, a HUGE complex homework assignment with a not-so-friendly deadline, lots of company research spent on my end, only to be told \"Thanks, but you are not the fit we are looking for.\" If I was a cat, I am on life 8.5. Seriously, if I don't get a job now, it is going to be \"Van Life Melanie\" and it's not going to be a fun-loving YouTube channel my friends. Here is the deal: I'm a Senior Executive Assistant to C-suite executives (CEO, CLO, CFO, COO and SVPs) who has been laid off and struggling to get hired in the state of California. I love what I do (helping my executives and teams thrive), and I am good at it. No major employment gaps in my resume except after layoffs (because we know getting a job is not fast and easy). I am loyal to my companies and my people. I am adaptable and can succeed in any industry if given a chance! I know how to juggle hectic calendars, arrange domestic and international travel (complete with stellar itineraries), manage expense reports through Concur, notarize legal documents, establish vendors in Coupa, oversee Board books and resolutions in Diligent, serve as a liaison to Board members, auditors, outside counsel and customers, coordinate onsite, offsite and virtual team events, oversee invoices, track expenses and budgets, turn wonky Word forms into lovely editable pdfs, mentor junior admins, and successfully onboard new hires. I love PowerPoint (and teaching people how to make dynamic presentations), proofreading, organizing, implementing operational best practices, and putting people at ease. I am a fast learner (just ask my former colleagues-I became a Coupa SME in no time!) and I love providing white glove customer service. I enjoy writing haikus for my team members' birthdays and anniversaries and crafting personalized Certificates of Achievements when there are wins. I am creative and a huge Culture Committee advocate. I go above and beyond. I can come into the office Mon-Fri or would even consider relocating to your state if you help my moving costs. That is me. This is my authentic self. If there a company who wants a professional, outgoing, creative, and thoughtful EA who can bring spark, cohesion, and organization to their company, please reach out to me. Please do not reach out to me if you are looking for a date or want to sell your professional services as a coach or resume writer--I am good on those ends. Thank you so much for listening and helping me keep a roof over my head."
