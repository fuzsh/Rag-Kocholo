Inheriting a two-year school with 240 students, she spent her first decade as president raising the number and quality of academic offerings, attracting new faculty, and expanding the student body. Using her outstanding relationship-building and fund-raising skills, she attracted a sizable endowment that allowed for the construction of many new buildings on the college’s original site and the acquisition of two new campuses in Ballston and Sterling, Virginia. The college began offering bachelor’s degrees in 1973, and in 1986 it achieved university status and became fully coeducational. By the time Sister Majella retired in 1993, Marymount offered thirty-eight undergraduate programs and twenty-three graduate degree programs to a student body of nearly 4,000. Sister Majella held honorary doctorates of humane letters from Georgetown University (1970) and Marymount Manhattan College (1983). At the time of her death in 2004 she was the longest serving woman college president in the nation.\n\nOnelio Aguilar currently teaches ELL students at TC Williams high school in Alexandria City.

I absolutely love marketing. I minored in psychology because I enjoy learning about what motivates people to buy. And lastly, I would tell students to not be afraid to ask people you do not even know for career help. LinkedIn is a fabulous platform to do this on.

On a service-learning trip to Costa Rica, I met a boy who was living with Muscular Dystrophy. It was this point in my education where I was close to graduating but had no idea where in the profession of physical therapy that I would fit. I was there to treat and teach the patients we were assigned to about how to improve their function. But I was the one learning about life and where I could fit into the world from that 18-year-old patient who was living in an orphanage. I decided that the boy deserved a power wheelchair, something that would be well out of what he would likely ever able to afford. I wanted to make sure that he had that chair, that would change his minute to minute existence, before I walked across the stage at graduation. The class and Marymount community rallied around the idea and we raised $20,000+ in just sixty-six days to make that idea a reality. The experience was one that I will never forget and think about often when I’m making major life decisions. We learn a lot within classrooms, but what we learn outside of them can have a large impact on our lives.\n\nShingai Mavengere is a director in the government contractor advisory practice of Baker Tilly US, LLP.

I remember a management training seminar I once attended, and the presenter asked us why most people quit their jobs. The answer wasn’t salary or opportunity; it was because of their boss. Similarly, a professor controls the experience a student has of his or her class. My warm feelings to Marymount are, in no small part, because of how fun and intelligent and approachable the faculty was. I’m still friends with many of those teachers, and those are friendships for which I’m profoundly grateful.\n\nOver five years into recovery from a decade-long opioid addiction,\n\nRyan Hampton has been rocketed to the center of America’s rising addiction recovery advocacy movement.

The best and most treasured memory is that I met my husband at Marymount. Our first daughter was born and spent her first six months on the Marymount campus. I spent many Easters with the RSHM community celebrating the trilogy of masses long into the night with Sr. Majella, Sr. Eymard, Sr. Michelle, Sr. Catherine, Sr. Mary Louise, Sr. PJ, Sr. Irene and Sr. Jackie. I had the honor of working in HR and had so many amazing colleagues – many are still part of the community today. Long before technology made is possible the major snow storm of 1996 shut down the campus for days. My team could not make it to campus and I lived the closest, so I cross country skied up Glebe Road to make sure that the many dedicated staff at Marymount got paid. As President of the Alumni Board, I had the honor of welcoming a class of new graduates and the distinct honor of following General Colin Powell who delivered the Commencement address.\n\nA graduate of the University of Richmond, Alice Mandanis received an M.A. and Ph.D. from the Catholic University of America.

It will, of course, but they should keep in mind that they have the advantage of flexibility. Don’t feel confined by your major; the job market doesn’t care that much what you studied. I spent almost 10 years working in a field outside of my major, but I had skills — like critical thinking and writing ability, enabled by my Marymount education — that made me an attractive candidate. Be flexible in your job search, whether that’s the field, the type of company or organization, or the location. Take advantage of Washington, where there are loads of government agencies, non-profit organizations, and international organizations looking for new talent. Finally, look to public service. While it isn’t likely to make you rich, service in the military, teaching for AmeriCorps, traveling with the Peace Corps, or teaching English abroad can give you an interesting resume and, more importantly, give you the breadth of global experience that will make you stand out.\n\nJim Ryerson served as the Dean of the School of Business Administration from 2006 to 2017.

He dropped out of high school to enlist in the Navy during WWII, serving with distinction as a Corpsman, broadening his horizons, and earning a GED through military correspondence courses.\n\nJeanne was born in Staunton, VA, and moved to Washington, DC as a little girl. She graduated from Washington & Lee High School in 1947.After the War, Preston Caruthers was drawn to Washington, DC, primarily, to relocate close to his sister and her husband, Lorraine and George Snell. Pres attended George Washington University while working in home construction for his brother-in-law. Looking for a place to live, he answered a newspaper ad for a room for rent in a home in Lyon Village. It was there he met his future wife, Jeanne, whose parents had posted the ad. A romance blossomed, and the two married in 1948. They made Arlington their home, where they raised their five children. Pres began his own home building company in 1949 with Jeanne handling the books, and, over time, shifted into developing high-rise apartments and office buildings. They were the consummate Arlingtonians.\n\nOver the years, Pres quietly and effectively involved himself in Northern Virginia’s business, civic and political realms. He was a leader. His deep and abiding passion, though, is his keen sense of the value of education. He proved time and again that he was willing to do “whatever it takes” to advance education and to increase access and opportunity for all citizens to partake of what he calls America’s most precious asset and resource. He is a past chairman of the Arlington County School Board, served on the inaugural founding Board of Visitors of George Mason University, served many years on the board of the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges (VFIC), and was appointed President of the Virginia State Board of Education.\n\nAs a VFIC trustee, Preston co-sponsored Marymount’s membership in that organization that supports the University’s mission as a private college.

Through this program, future nurses partner with the hospital staff to provide critically needed care in their own community and augment their exceptional education. The Caruthers support has strengthened the bond and enhanced the collaborative synergies of these two Arlington institutions. Together they are able to provide the highest level of care to all.\n\nAlso in recent history, Preston and Jeanne provided the naming gift towards the construction of Caruthers Hall, where Marymount’s nursing program is housed.\n\nIt should be noted, the content shared so far may suggest to readers that this support was from Preston, alone. However, none of these feats would have been possible without Jeanne. Her love and support on the home front were integral to Preston’s business success. Their shared belief in the importance of education and service to one’s community is what induced the couple’s magnanimity towards Marymount University. Jeanne passed away in August of 2015, after more than forty years battling Parkinson’s disease. The Caruthers’ involvement and support of Marymount University has spanned over 60 years, and the tenure of four different Marymount presidents.\n\nUpon the opening of Caruthers Hall, Preston fondly expressed the following: “I have long observed that the students who attend Marymount are wonderful young people. They are bright, compassionate, and ethical. They have big dreams for the future. The new science and health science building will benefit these terrific young people for years to come. It will also benefit the wider community; by giving Marymount students every educational advantage, we ensure that they will go forth from the University well prepared to serve others and make a positive difference in the world.”\n\nCarlos Y.

Do not allow yourself to be paralyzed by indecision if you find yourself feeling like an imposter. I am of the firm belief that those suffering from this syndrome are usually the best practitioners in their respective disciplines for the simple reason that that fear of inadequacy spurs them on to keep improving and reaching higher and higher than others, to ensure that not only do they not fail but rather succeed beyond expectations. In that vein, I recommend honing critical thinking skills above all else. Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough: start reading all sorts of books and then keeping reading for the rest of your life.\n\nKatherine Kallinis Berman is a Pastry chef who co-founded the Washington, D.C. pastry shop Georgetown Cupcake in 2008.
