        "text": "Joined City Academy: 2000\n\nEducation: B.S., Kaplan University\n\nM.S., Kaplan University\n\n“My passion for education stems from my desire to see every student reach their full potential. It is so rewarding and humbling to know that as educators, we serve a purpose that is much more vast than ourselves. I’m a firm believer in relationship building. When we encourage, inspire, and build a strong rapport with our scholars, that is the moment when they begin to trust us and know that we care about them. Moreover, I believe all students can learn when they are immersed in an environment that is conducive to learning, and where they feel safe, valued, and heard. When I walk through the doors of City Academy, I will continue to walk in my purpose and serve our scholars every day.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes is by Dr. Rita Pierson who states: “Every child deserves a champion: an adult that will not give up on them, who understands the power of connections and insists they become the best that they can possibly be.”\n\nHere at City Academy, we are grateful that our scholars are surrounded by Champions who are here to help them thrive.”\n\nBefore going into administration, Donna was our former Junior Kindergarten teacher for 19 years. She also had the opportunity to teach at the 1st and 5th grade levels. During the 2020-2021 school year, she took on the role as the Director of Early Childhood. As we enter the 2023-2024 school year, Ms. Hynes will move into her new role as our Dean of Students and Families. She is excited to take on this role and looks forward to working with students, families, and faculty to continue building partnerships, classroom community, strengthening our home/school connection, and embodying our school’s mission. During the 2014-2015 school year, Ms. Hynes began City Academy’s first family literacy night.\n\nMs. Hynes is a member of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the International Literacy Association, and The St. Louis Women Leaders Association. She also currently serves on the Business Development Committee at Cornerstone Center for Early Learning.\n\nIn her spare time, she enjoys spending time with her family, reading, traveling, and shopping.\n\nJoined City Academy: 2014, 2024\n\nEducation: B.S. in Elementary Education, University of Missouri – St. Louis\n\nM. Ed., University of Missouri – St. Louis\n\nEd. S. Candidate, University of Missouri – St. Louis\n\nFormerly known as Ms. Duran, Trish first came to City Academy in 2014 as a Student Teacher and was the 2nd-4th grade Math Teacher the following year. She married her husband and moved to Texas, where she continued her love of teaching math.\n\nWanting to further grow as an educator, Trish started graduate school after moving back to St. Louis with her family. She has an M. Ed. in Educational Psychology and is currently completing her Ed. S. in School Psychology. She is eager to apply all she is learning to support the incredible teachers and students at City Academy.\n\nIn her free time, Trish and her husband, Michael, can usually be found running around with their two energetic kids, Emmy and Jack.\n\nJoined City Academy: 2002\n\nEducation: B.A., Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville\n\nM.S., Fontbonne University\n\nShalawn Fennoy started her career at City Academy as the first 4th grade Teacher. Wanting to grow in her profession, she has since had the opportunity to serve students across grade levels including 2nd, 4th, and 6th, and currently serves as the 5th Grade Humanities Teacher. Through such experiences, Shalawn has gained a greater understanding of the significant impact each grade has had on another as well as exploring the developmental differences among children.\n\nIn her role as the 5th Grade Teacher, Shalawn conveys that the most integral piece to teaching 5th grade is her chance to witness students believe a positive future self is possible and relevant. Students begin to embrace the value of individuality; with a better understanding of purpose, persistence, and potential. “Teaching is so much more than pouring content into a child, it is inspiring growth and change, and empowering students to be GREAT.”\n\nAn active advocate for education in St. Louis, Shalawn has participated in numerous community service organizations and in 2012 she was nominated for the Teacher of Distinction Award.\n\nOutside of her duties as a teacher, Shalawn enjoys spending time with family, enjoying live jazz bands and immersing herself in a good suspense novel, filled with plot twists and thrillers.\n\nJoined City Academy: 2023\n\nEducation: Purdue University\n\nConsidered a “boomerang”, Ada has found her way back to her purpose and passion as an educator. She has over 23 years in the field of education. Ada has been teaching since she was a child with her dolls as the students. Following the dreams of others, she graduated from Purdue University with a degree in Computer Science and Hospitality Management. After years in the corporate world, she followed her dream and began teaching in the Independent Schools of St. Louis while raising her twin daughters. Ada boomeranged back into the corporate world as a Senior Consultant / Analyst for five years and now has returned back home to St. Louis and City Academy.\n\nJoined City Academy: 2015\n\nEducation: B.S., Harris Stowe State University\n\nEvelyn comes from a family of educators and knew at a young age she wanted to follow in their footsteps. In 2014 she was thrilled to be placed at City Academy for student teaching and immediately knew this was the school community she wanted to be part of long-term. After graduation, Evelyn officially began her career here as a substitute teacher and shortly thereafter signed on as the K-2nd STEAM teacher. Since then she has moved to Junior Kindergarten where she continues to teach STEAM to our youngest scholars.\n\nOutside of school, Evelyn enjoys spending time with her husband and young daughter, reading, experimenting with photography, and traveling.\n\nJoined City Academy: 2019\n\nEducation: B.A. Early Childhood Education & B.A. Psychology., Webster University\n\nM.A. Special Education, Webster University\n\nAlison came to City Academy to launch the first 3- and 4-year-old classroom in the newly expanded Early Childhood Center.
