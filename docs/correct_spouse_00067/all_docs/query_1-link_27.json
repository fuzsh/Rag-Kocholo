        "text": "Debra Messing doesn't appear to be suffering from separation anxiety. The \"Smash\" star filed for divorce Tuesday from her husband, Daniel Zelman, after nine and a half years of marriage, not including the last 21 months, which they spent living...\n\nTogether?\n\nMore from E! Online: Smash shocker! Which stars were just axed from season two?\n\nMessing, who is asking that the judge grant her and Zelman joint physical and legal custody of their 8-year-old son, Roman, continued living with her husband in New York even after they chose to emotionally part ways.\n\nMore from E! Online: View the court documents\n\nIt's unclear just how long that setup lasted, but it would appear that Messing is at last ready to literally move on.\n\nThe Emmy winner just confirmed in December that she and Zelman were no longer together, but their date of separation is listed as Feb. 15, 2010. They met at NYU in the 1990s and tied the knot Sept. 3, 2000.\n\nMore from E! Online: Big celebrity splits\n\nSince her split, Messing has been romantically linked to now-former \"Smash\" costar Will Chase, who has two children from his first marriage and is in the process of getting divorced from Broadway actress Stephanie Gibson.\n\n--Additional reporting by Claudia Rosenbaum\n\nRelated content:"
