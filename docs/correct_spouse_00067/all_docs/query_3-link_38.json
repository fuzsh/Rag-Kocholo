        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nWill Chase (born September 12, 1970) is an American actor and singer, best known for his work in Broadway musicals.\n\nChase was born in Frankfort, Kentucky to Jerry and Betty Chase and is the youngest of three boys. He graduated from Western Hills High School and the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, where he majored in Percussion studied conducting with Robert Spano and percussion.\n\nHe first performed in a Broadway show in 1998 as the \"Squeegee Man\" and \"Roger\" understudy in Rent; he also starred as the last Roger in the final Broadway company of Rent, which was recorded for the theatrical release Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway. His additional Broadway credits include Miss Saigon (with the original star Lea Salonga playing Kim to close the Broadway production), The Full Monty as Jerry Lukowski replacement (2001), Lennon (2005), and Aida (Radames replacement, 2003–04). He reprised the role of Radames at The Muny in St. Louis in June and July 2006.\n\nIn 2005, he played Neville Craven in the 2005 World AIDS Day The Secret Garden concert. In 2006 he starred in the short lived High Fidelity on Broadway, and starred as Valentin in Kiss of the Spider Woman at Signature Theatre in Arlington, VA, for which he received a 2009 Helen Hayes Nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor. He appeared in The Pajama Game opposite Kate Baldwin at The Muny in July 2007.\n\nChase's television guest appearances include the recurring role of Pat Mahoney on \"Rescue Me\", \"Cupid\", \"Canterbury's Law\", Law & Order, Third Watch, Conviction, and \"Queens Supreme\".

He married Stephanie Gibson on November 15, 2009.\n\nThe ENFJ personality type is the people organiser, warm, harmonious and an enthusiastic champion of people who just wants to ‘do good.’ They make sure the needs of the people are paramount and taken care of, then they will want to plan and get on with it. They can generally be found at the emotional heart of a group or body and will be the one making sure things get done. Like the ENTJ, they excel at getting on and doing but with a much more people, as well as task focus, but with no less energy, commitment or vigour. Articulate and confident the ENFJ will be persuasive and tenacious; the one voted the leader or committee chairperson. They will look for and make connections between people, be excellent glue for the team, everyone knows they can depend on the ENFJ. An ENFJ will use their considerable energies and enthusiasm to make things happen and these characteristics are infectious and can be excellent at creating a feeling of 'team' and keeping morale high.\n\nThe ENFJ personality type has high drive, bundles of energy and a commitment to ‘the cause,’ (whatever that cause is) which borders on the evangelical. Their energy levels increase the more people they have to meet and the more activities they have to arrange. Consummate planners and organisers, they can juggle masses of activities and tasks at any one time, rarely dropping the ball and making sure each activity is given the right amount of attention and loving care. This desire to ‘get it done’ can at times mean that the ENFJ becomes inflexible and a ‘controlling parent’ in their desire to ‘finish what we’ve started.’ Under such pressure they can lose their sense of balance and perspective but will ultimately bounce back because that is just what the ENFJ is built for.\n\nAs ‘Thinking’ is their weaker function, the ENFJ may suffer at times from being overly subjective and lacking a cooler, slightly more dispassionate eye on people and situations. This also means the ENFJ may bite off more that they can chew as their first priority is to say ‘yes’ and take the pain away for others. During such times the ENFJ may feel weighed down by the amount of work to which they have committed and so may see themselves as ‘victim,’ feeling overwhelmed and underappreciated. They want to please and make sure things run like clockwork and when others let them down the ENFJ can be very disappointed. This desire to ‘do good’ can also mean that the ENFJ sees pleasing others as far more important than pleasing themselves and so they may run the risk of trading off honesty for harmony, keeping the peace rather than telling it like it is. At times they may also rely too much on their intuitive understanding of individuals, thus failing to make logical, empirical decisions based on objective facts and evidence, and the ENFJ may see good where none exists. Their 'N' perspective also means that the ENFJ may fail to see the smaller 'facts,' focusing instead on 'global harmony.' This would see the ENFJ move too quickly and make decisions based on a scant amount of facts. Their sensitivity can also work two ways. Sure, the ENFJ will be sensitive to the needs of others but this sensitivity can mean the ENFJ is overly reactive to perceived criticism of them. In these instances, the ENFJ may become self-indulgent and feel that their good intentions are being undervalued; but only until they are needed again."
