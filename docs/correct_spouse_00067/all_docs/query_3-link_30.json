        "text": "Has Katharine McPhee pulled a Kristen Stewart?\n\nNew photos of the 29-year-old actress show her locking lips — multiple times — with her one-time \"Smash\" director Michael Morris in a Los Angeles parking lot. If they were trying to hide their relationship, you couldn't tell. They are also seen walking together hand in hand and smiling.\n\nSo what's the big deal? Well, they're both married to other people.\n\nMcPhee said \"I do\" to producer and manager Nick Cokas, who is nearly 20 years older her senior, in 2008 after a three-year relationship. She was admittedly head-over-heels on her wedding day, gushing to People magazine, \"He is the love of my life. This is a once in a lifetime occasion and everything is just perfect.\" However, multiple new reports indicate they separated several months ago. (A rep for the actress/singer has not yet responded to omg!'s request for comment.)\n\nMeanwhile, Morris's wife of a decade is actress Mary McCormack, who most recently starred on TV's \"Welcome to the Family\" and before that was on \"In Plain Sight.\" Earlier in her career, she played Howard Stern's wife, Alison, in \"Private Parts.\" They have three young daughters: Margaret (born 2004), Rose (2007), and Lillian (2011).\n\nThis isn't the first love connection that was made on the set of \"Smash.\" In November 2011 — months before the series, which was about the behind the scenes happenings on a Broadway show, even debuted — Debra Messing quietly started dating her co-star Will Chase. The following month, she announced that her 10-year marriage to Daniel Zelman had ended, saying the split took place earlier in the year. For his part, Chase was also married — to stage actress Stephanie Gibson. In December, the month his relationship with Messing was revealed, they started divorce proceedings.\n\nMcPhee and Cokas seemed like a fairly odd match when we first met them during her days as an \"American Idol\" contestant. He seemed like a father figure not only because of his age, but he also managed her music career. It seems he still does. WhoRepresents, which is a database of talent agents, still lists him as her music manager.\n\nEarlier this year there were indications of trouble for the couple. In an interview with Lucky, she talked about how her grueling schedule for \"Smash,\" which was canceled in May, left her exhausted and she said she often fell asleep while spending time with Cokas. But, more interestingly, she went on to talk about how work was her priority and her true love.\n\n\"I once thought that by now I'd have lots of children, but actually I'm really enjoying being able to go from point A to point B and the only worry I have is have my dogs been walked,\" she said in February. \"I'm selfish right now, but that's how and where I should be. The thing is, work is the thing I love the most.\""
