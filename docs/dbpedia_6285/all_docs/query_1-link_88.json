        "text": "For years I have wondered what Lawrence Block thought of My Blueberry Nights. I have never find any direct comments. Rewatching it tonight, I asked a chatbot. I got the echo chamber I wanted, and I am super impressed by the human like inferences that the model made from the sources. I could not find any direct quotes or interviews from Lawrence Block about his thoughts on My Blueberry Nights, but I did find some clues that suggest he was proud of his work and enjoyed collaborating with Wong Kar-wai. For example: In his official website, he mentions My Blueberry Nights as one of his credits and provides a link to buy the DVD3. In his blog, he shares some anecdotes and photos from the Cannes Film Festival, where the film premiered in 2007. He describes the experience as ‚Äúa lot of fun‚Äù and praises Wong Kar-wai as ‚Äúa brilliant filmmaker‚Äù and ‚Äúa delightful man‚Äù. In an interview with CrimeReads, he says that he learned a lot from working with Wong Kar-wai and that he was impressed by his vision and style. He also reveals that he wrote a novelization of the film, but it was never published. Based on these sources, I think Lawrence Block had a positive opinion of My Blueberry Nights and appreciated the opportunity to work with Wong Kar-wai. However, this is just my inference from the available information, and I cannot speak for him or his personal feelings. If you want to know more about Lawrence Block or his other works, you can visit his website3 or read some of his books. üòä\n\nWhy the Raiders of the Lost Ark Soundtrack is In My Top 10 Greatest Film Scores Ever Made Since the Dawn of Humankindüëá (Part 1 of a God-Knows-How-Long series, because apparently I‚Äôve given this subject way too much thought.) The first two reasons: 1. A John Williams film score tells a story‚Äîeven if you remove the movie. I LOVE stories, including musical ones. The Raiders tracks lift me up and move me from one chapter to the next and keep me listening intensely, the way a good book keeps me reading, and the only reason I‚Äôll pause is if one of my children is hungry or bleeding. How many film scores all by themselves can boast the same? 2. The INDIVIDUAL THEMES. Good gracious. In this single movie the man has created a sumptuous multitude of distinctive, evocative signatures for specific characters (Indy, Marion, the Nazis), creatures (the spiders, the snakes), locations (Peru, Marshall College‚Äîand note that musically we‚Äôre taken from Peru TO Marshall College in the same movement!‚ÄîNepal, Egypt) and even OBJECTS (the Ark, the Medallion that sits atop the Staff of Ra, the poisoned dates). I like a lot of film composers, but even the best of them don‚Äôt come close to producing the sheer output of themes like John Williams, and Raiders positively crackles with them. So much more to gush about. Part 2 on the way!\n\nExecution is everything! David Fincher's film \"The Killer\" is a dark and humorous genre movie. The protagonist, an assassin played by Michael Fassbender, gives advice on how to be successful in life, which is a commentary on the self-serving nature of modern society. The opening credits act as a prelude to the action-packed fights that ensue. However, unlike other violent films, \"The Killer\" doesn't glorify violence, but rather emphasizes the horror of its consequences. The movie also shows how modern society has integrated impersonal commerce and capital, making it clear that the film does not want to revel in graphic violence. Rather, it suggests that pulling a trigger and clicking the \"Buy\" button are similar actions, which is a disturbing and thought-provoking commentary on modern life.\n\nAnd, as both Maurice Blanchot and Samuel Beckett have taught us, waiting is the very condition of thinking, of questioning ‚Äî and as one is attending to the work of Wesley Leon Aroozoo (which is always a film, regardless of what it first appears to be), if one is paying attention, the question of what exactly are attending to is never far from one. Of whether the film is a documentary of Mr Aroozoo‚Äôs trip to Japan; a testimony to Yasuo Takamatsu and his undying fidelity to his wife; an indictment of neo-liberal Japan‚Äôs indifference to the loss of life; of the tsunami as a figure that opens socio-economic questions in the polis that we call Japan; and so on and so forth. And whilst the fact that multiple forms, a variety of questions, within a film is certainly not new, what stands out is Mr Aroozoo‚Äôs sensitivity to the singularity of each of these forms. Such that he is willing to respond ‚Äî responsibility and ethics being never far from his work, his approach ‚Äî to each of these possibilities without attempting to reconcile them, pull them under a totalitarian gesture of the author. Which means that Wesley Leon Aroozoo is not attempting auteur cinema ‚Äî but something even more interesting. Where, what he is doing is calling into question the very possibility of the author herself. Where his work, his film, is nothing more ‚Äî and infinitely nothing less ‚Äî than cinema as such https://lnkd.in/gSGCb9ss\n\n*I know I am late with this* Foreword: The world is astoundingly complex, we live today in times of unprecedentedly severe threats to our (dignified) existence, and there is so much to be done in so many areas. At the same time, it feels deeply exciting to be a contemporary of the #Barbie film, which I perceived as a great reminder of the freedom people have achieved (ie fought for) to openly share perspectives. The film has definitely made me realize how much I don't understand about others' perspectives and predicaments. Hopefully, I will now be more open to them. I invite everyone who has not yet seen them film to do so with full dedication. Because also, it is just a darn good film, with a good story (yes, basic at times), and very good acting. And yes, SPOILERS in the article.\n\nIn a recent Chinese New Year film exploring the YOLO theme by Ë¥æÁé≤, she took the audience on a journey of empowerment and profound self-discovery. While some may label it as merely a weight loss narrative, I see it as a profound exploration of the human spirit. It speaks to the resilience within us all, showcasing that no matter how deep our flaws or how frequent our stumbles are, there's always a glimmer of hope to cling onto. It's a reminder that even in our darkest moments, if we can latch onto even the tiniest spark of passion or purpose, and relentlessly pursue it with unwavering determination, miracles can unfold. This film is a testament to the power of perseverance, illustrating that against all odds, victory is not just a possibility, but an inevitability, even if it graces us just once in a lifetime. Now and then, I do follow the comedic side of Jia Ling on YouTube, finding her to be a genuinely hilarious entertainer. Recently, her foray into production has sparked a myriad of discussions across social media platforms, which comes as no surprise. As I peruse the diverse array of comments from netizens, I can't help but reflect on the reception of my recent production, \"Rising With Charlene.\" Amidst the positive feedback, there's also a fair share of criticism. Yet, much like Jia Ling, my aim remains steadfast: to cultivate a space where individuals can find solace, embrace love, and nurture self-kindness through creation in their lives. Admittedly, negative comments can weigh heavily on my spirit at times too, stalling my momentum. If you find resonance in this struggle, show your support and stay tuned for our upcoming guest next Monday premiere. In the meantime, feel free to catch the first full run here with Joanne: https://bit.ly/RWC-S1 photo credit: weibo\n\nIn the enigmatic world of director Justine Triet's third film, \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" suspense unfurls like a darkly comic tapestry in the courtrooms, earning it the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The central question echoes through the narrative: Did Sandra kill her husband, Samuel, or is there more to the story than meets the eye? The film intricately explores not only the literal fall of Samuel, scrutinized through forensic eccentricities and a simulated fatal plunge but also the figurative descent of Sandra as her life becomes dissected during the trial. As the legal proceedings unfold, justice takes on a surreal form, less concerned with truth than the perception of it. Sandra's character, portrayed with remarkable depth by H√ºller, becomes the focal point of a turbulent marriage, laid bare under the pressures of money, ambition, and parenthood. The courtroom becomes a stage for humiliation, where even her fiction writing is questioned, revealing the fine line between reality and imagination. \"Anatomy of a Fall\" is a clever, cutting, and nimble exploration of relationships, justice, and the unsettling intersection of fiction and reality. Triet's meticulous storytelling, sharp courtroom sparring, and a clever ending make this 2.5-hour mystery an engaging journey into the complexities of the human psyche."
