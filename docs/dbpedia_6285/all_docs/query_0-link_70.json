BW/Rtg: NR\n\nThe Power Of The Whistler (1945)\n\nTaking pity on an amnesiac (Richard Dix) wandering the streets, fortune teller Jean Lang (Janis Carter) resolves to help him, and attempts to piece together a trail to his identity and past through the few items he has in his pockets.

BW/Rtg: NR\n\nVoice of the Whistler (1945)\n\nIndustrialist John Sinclair (Richard Dix) had everything, except loved ones...and his health.

BW/Rtg: NR\n\nMysterious Intruder (1946)\n\nDisreputable private eye Don Gale (Richard Dix) is engaged by an elderly music store owner to track down a woman he had last seen as a teenager, so she can receive a shadowy--but substantial--legacy.

Sixth series entry also stars Mona Barrie, Michael Duane. 65 min. BW/Rtg: NR\n\nThe Thirteenth Hour (1947)\n\nTrucking magnate Steve Reynolds (Richard Dix) was well used to underhanded dealings from his competitors.

Can he avoid the manhunt and clear his name before he’s next-day delivered to prison? Seventh \"Whistler\" film, and Dix’s screen farewell, co-stars Karen Morley, Regis Toomey. 65 min. BW/Rtg: NR\n\nThe Return Of The Whistler (1945)\n\nHaving fallen into a whirlwind courtship with a beautiful widow (Lenore Aubert), engineer Ted Nichols (Michael Duane) agreed to separate hotel rooms before going to the justice of the peace.
