Next day a weary Bidault arrived in Geneva only hours before the conference opened. Behind him there was more trouble. Bao Dai had balked at the last minute. Too many people in France were talking of dealing with the Viet Minh and partitioning his country, said Bao Dai and he refused to sign the treaties establishing Viet Nam's indepen- dence, which the French had hopefully expected would take from their war the taint of colonialism before Geneva opened. As the conference opened, the West managed to bypass temporarily the ques- tion of Red China's status by getting agreement that the chairmanship would rotate among Russia, Britain and a neu- tral-Thailand. The week's events, how- ever grim, had brought the West to a closer understanding of the peril, if to no agreement on what was to be done about it. On Geneva's first day, Georges Bidault asked dramatically for a truce long enough for the French to evacuate Dien- bienphu's 1,500 wounded. He appealed \"to the conscience of the civilized world . to save from the hazards of combat the men who no longer can take part in it because they have already shed their blood.

Parliament got the point; M.P.s cheered him wildly, and newspapers head- lined NEHRU'S AIR BAN round the world. Two days later Nehru defined the war in Indo-China to his own satisfaction: \"The conflict is in its origin and essential character a movement of resistance to co- lonialism.\" Nehru rounded off his oration by saying the U.S. threatened the peace of Southeast Asia. He had nothing to say about Red China. TIME, MAY 3, 1954 Khokhlov, 31, MVD CAPTAIN KHOKHLOV (WITH FAMILY) With poison and conscience. carry out his murder assignment. The stated reason was simple enough: \"A con- flict between Soviet intelligence, which tried to force me to commit criminal acts, and my conscience\"; but the facts leading up to it made a story that sounded like a collaboration of Graham Greene and E. Phillips Oppenheim. As a young man in Moscow and a duti- ful member of the Young Communist League Organization in the late '3os, Ni- kolai Khokhlov was only interested in becoming an actor-and eventually a movie director. He played a few bits in Russian plays and movies, and even made himself a small reputation on the variety stage as an \"artistic whistler.\" When the Nazis invaded Russia, he volunteered for front- line duty, but was rejected because of bad eyes. As the Nazis drew near to Moscow, however, Khokhlov was recruited, along with many other young actors and artists, by the NKVD (the MVD of the time) to fight a rear-guard guerrilla action in case of my country nut asu tut had nothing to do with defense. They were dirty missions.\" Once Khokhlov tried to quit the MVD but failed. Another time he refused to undertake a mission involving murder. His bulwark and supporter in such bold ac- tions, according to Khokhlov, was his wife Yanina. She was a young construction engineer and a Roman Catholic. Tears formed in Khokhlov's eyes last week as he talked of her: \"She helped me to under- stand that there exists in the world real decency, and that there is such a thing as purity of motive.\" One day last October, Kholildov was summoned to the headquarters of MVD's grim Ninth Otdel, the \"terror and diver- sion\" section now under the direct super- vision of taciturn Alexander Panyushkin, onetime (1947-52) Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. He was told to proceed to Frankfurt, there to assassinate one Georgi Okolovich, a big shot in the right-wing Russian expatriate organization, NTS, whose Berlin director, Dr. Alexander Trushnovich, was brutally abducted from West Berlin by Communists a fortnight ago (TIME, April 26). Khokhlov said that he went home to talk the matter over with his wife, and both decided that a second refusal of an assignment would mean certain death for Khokhlov, for Yanina and for their year-old son. Khokhlov suggested that he might go on the mission and let somebody else do the actual killing, but Yanina was ada- mant. \"If this man is killed, you will be the assassin,\" she said. \"I can't remain the wife of a husband who is an assassin.\" Together they decided that Khokhlov must go on the mission and then defect. \"I asked her,\" he said, \"if she realized what awaited her if I `went West.' She knew, and it in no way altered her decision.\" After their momentous decision was made, Khokhlov's problem became simply one of following orders-up to the crucial point. With two East German Commu- nists who were to serve as his assistants, Khokhlov went to work. The Germans went through refresher courses in judo, marksmanship and automobile driving.

The the Australians of \"slander\" for calling surrender to the West of an MVD agent, Petrov a spy, and in the next, demanded Yuri Rastvorov, in Japan last January, his immediate return as a swindler and might have provided a further reason. Then there was the still unanswered ques- tion of what would now happen-or had already happened-to his wife Yanina in Moscow. Khokhlov himself seemed to have a strange faith in what U.S. moral pressure might do to save her. \"I came here,\" said Nikolai Khokhlov to the American reporters, \"not merely to tell you of an assassination that didn't take place, but to appeal to the one remaining force capable of saving my wife-this woman who told me, `Do not kill.\"' Could an agent of the Soviet MVD seri- ously believe that such force could be of help to her now? Whistler Khokhlov was the night in the direction of the Jordan border. Soon the men came back with a prisoner. He was an Arab of medium height, and he tried to make himself smaller by pressing his hands against his belly. The Israelis searched him roughly, and one of them thrust the snout of a Tommy gun into his stomach. He made a noise like a wounded animal. Then Tryfus tried to thrust the land mine into the prisoner's hands. Thy Arab shrank back, and Tryfus laughed grimly. \"He knows nothing.\" mimicked one of the policemen. \"They never know anything . They steal and kill but when we capture them they are babies born yesterday.\" By dawn we were back in Kfar Saba, sipping glasses of tea. Almost time for the watchman to go to sleep and for the rest of Israel to rise and work. But how long can the Israelis go on this way? In the years since the fighting was officially declared over, they have not dared to fill in their trenches or coil their barbed wire. The direct cost of the peacetime raids has been $4,500,000, the indirect cost incalculable. Instead of bleeding to death in a thousand places, as her enemies hope she will, Israel is growing bellicose. Increasing numbers of Israelis see no chance of a permanent settlement unless their army wins it for them. Says a top Israeli general: \"Only by making the Arabs realize that if they press hard they will be met with another Kibya can we deter them .. . We must adopt an aggressive posture.\" From the Jordan side, TIME'S Middle East Correspondent Keith Wheeler reported: The Arabs feel the same way. One windy morning I drove to the Jordan village of Husan, which is less than a mile from the frontier. All of Husan's 1,200 inhabitants were gathered gravely, a little proudly, in the muddy village square. The Jews had attacked Husan the night before I arrived, and Husan's home guard had helped to give them a bloody nose. Now the whole village was assembled, waiting for the U.N. armistice team to piece together the Arab version of the attack. A young lieutenant in the red and white headgear of Jor- dan's Arab Legion had charge of the evidence: a scattering of spent .3o-caliber cartridges with Israeli markings; a demoli- tion charge, an empty morphine syrette, several deposits of dried blood, and-out in a wheat field on the south side of the village-a crushed-down trail through the wheat where something heavy and inert, like a body, had been dragged away in the direction of the Israeli border. \"We got this one with the Bren gun,\" the lieutenant said proudly. \"It was about 10:45 p.m. when they came. My sentries heard them moving about in the rocks, so we opened fire .. . \"They replied with so much fire so fast, and so many gre- nades, that at first I pulled back my men behind the village walls. Then the Arab Legion got here-they made it in 15 minutes. The Israelis pulled out some 45 minutes later. We heard one of them yell when he got hit . . .\" \"Suppose they come back?\" I asked the young lieutenant. \"They'll be welcome,\" he snapped, staring westwards across the demarcation line towards the squat Israeli barracks at Camp Opper, less than a mile away. But the lieutenant's jaunty confidence was tinged with apprehension, for everyone in Husan knows that it takes almost no effort-only the desire-for the Jews to come again any night they choose. Next time Husan might not escape unscathed. This knowledge, and the brooding conviction that the will to attack is mounting in Israel, has made Jordan's frontier villages especially pleased of late to be host to a small, urbane Englishman who is a man of distinction in this part of the world. He is Major General John Bagot Glubb, 57, the small, grey-haired commander of the Arab Legion, who is known across the desert as Abu Huneik (father of the small jaw) in tribute to the disfigurement he bears as the result of a World War I bullet wound in the face. Glubb Pasha's personal plane flies daily from Amman (pop. 200,000), the capital of Jordan, to Jerusalem, ostensibly to enable Abu Huneik to visit his aged mother, sick in her Jerusalem home. But Glubb is more often in the field than in Jerusalem. With his distinctive cavalcade (two jeeps and a tan staff car crammed with Arab Legionnaires) he bounces from village to village along the frontier, and everywhere he stops, an impromptu majlis (as- sembly) forms to discuss the defense of the border. Abu Huneik knows how to talk to the Arabs. Though he Often reads the lesson in the Anglican church at Amman, he still carries in his right hand the prayer beads which Moslems use to calm their nerves and count their petitions to Allah. Outsiders are not welcome at. Abu Huneik's talks, but the word leaks out that what he is saying goes like this: \"The Jews mean to attack us. Geography shows that they have got to widen their waist by straightening out the bulge we make into Israel. They have got to shove Jordan back. And one way or another, they mean to do it.\" Jordan's only military resource is Glubb's Arab Legion: 20,000 men. But against a growing Israeli army, whose officers hope will one day number 250,000 men, even Glubb admits that \"we must have outside help.\" Where is the help to come from? Glubb seems to imply that the British army, about to evacuate Suez, might be pleased to reinforce Jordan, in return for base facilities. Many Jordanians agree. Seated on a golden throne in his white stone palace at Amman, 2o-year-old King Hussein told me recently that military aid from Britain \"is now under discussion, and we believe these contacts will pro- duce good results.\" The sad fact is that there are people on the Jordan side who still dream about renewing the war. Defeat and injury in 1948-49 left many Arabs with a sick and shamed desperation, and they see no hope of recovery except by force of arms. Both sides have their war parties, and if the border killings continue, the moderate men may break. You have only to watch the daily mounting tension to become gloomily con- vinced that sooner or later, one incident or another is going to touch off an explosion.

Unable to get back the docu- ments delivered to Australia by Petrov, the departing staff at Canberra's Russian embassy spent their last hours getting rid of other information that might prove valuable to the West. Black smoke belched from the embassy chimneys as files went into fireplaces, and on the em- bassy lawn a Russian stood guard with a hose over a bonfire, not hesitating to turn a full stream of water into the face of any snooper peering through the hedge. In Moscow the Russians held up the depar- ture of the Australian embassy staff, after first ordering them out of the country within three days. Topical Knowledge. In Washington, the spines of those who once rubbed shoulders in the diplomatic corps with former Russian Ambassador Alexander Panyushkin crawled slightly at the news that he was now the efficient chief of MVD's assassination department. To Washingtonians who had found the am- bassador's stilted conversation pedestrian to the point of boredom, it was cold com- fort to realize that they had merely seized on topics that failed to interest him. On the right subject, apparently, Panyushkin could be fascinating. \"He is a clever and attractive person,\" said ex-MVDman Khokhlov in Bonn last week, \"and he knows how to explain to you the right way to kill a man with poison bullets.\" GREAT BRITAIN When in England To the average Briton, a U.S. soldier off duty is often a pretty overwhelming sight. Lounging on a street corner in blue jeans and a garishly patterned leather windbreaker, the hairs on his chest peep- ing slyly out of the deep cleavage of an open-necked sport shirt, the out-of- uniform G.I. is an equally distressing sight to more soldierly U.S. noncoms. Last week, as part of a general effort \"to improve relations between us and the British,\" Colonel G. F. McGuire, dep- uty commander of the Britain-based U.S. Third Air Force, ordered airmen of his command to modify their off-duty garb \"in accordance with local custom.\" The only exception: attendance at such all- American affairs as ball games. There, zoot suits, Harry Truman shirts and other native costumes may still be worn with- out penalty Those Lovable Communists Harry Pollitt, the thick-jowled boss of Britain's Communist Party, might be pleased with Communist triumphs else- where, but he was worried about the par- ty's declining membership in Britain. Ad- monishing the 65o delegates to the Brit- ish party's 23rd national congress, Pollitt said last week: \"It is high time that we stopped creating the impression that does so much to frighten other people from joining the party, that we are some kind of human beings who never eat, sleep, play, dream or even make love.\" Who Follows the Whirlwind? A police summons was issued for Aneurin Bevan, charging him with dan- gerous driving and failure to stop after an accident. The accident, near London, was a minor affair, but it was not the only charge of recklessness made last week against Nye Bevan. Commentators and columnists, Con- servative or Socialist, everywhere con- demned the manner, and frequently the matter, in Bevan's abrupt split with Labor Party Leader Clement Attlee (TIME, April 26) over approval of German rearmament and of U.S. leadership in world politics. Admitted the leftist New Statesman & Nation: \"By this impulsive gesture, Mr. Russia, \"the leadership would be his re- ward,\" noted the Manchester Guardian, \"but there is nothing more improbable in politics than that Mr. Bevan will suc- ceed.\" Bitterest of all was the Laborite tabloid Daily Mirror (circ. 4,500,000): \"Again he has shown that the greatest blunder the party could make would be to elect him leader . . . For who can follow a whirlwind? How can a man who does not give loyalty expect to command loyalty from others?\" But there was also evidence that Nye had struck a popular chord among the. millions of Britons who fear Germany, resent the U.S. and think that the Com- munists would behave better if not antag- onized. Nye's opposition to German re- armament was supported 2 to i by the convention of the Cooperative Party, which controls 18 Labor seats in Parlia- ment, by delegates of Britain's sixth largest union, and by the Labor Party of Northern Ireland in convention. Many such voters would follow Nye Bevan on no other issue. But Bevan was quite happy to claim them all. Politically, his driving might be dangerous, but it was no accident. Errand of Mercy The fear of fire in the nursery had long haunted Freda Holland, 41, a night nurse at Reading's Dellwood Maternity Home, 36 miles west of London. Early on Easter Sunday, it rose to grip her heart in panic as she opened the door behind which lay her newest charges: 15 babies, none more than nine days old. The room beyond was filled with smoke; flames licked through the floor amid the cribs, and one baby's bedding was already taking fire. Sister Holland screamed for help and rushed into the ward.
