        "text": "The eighth and final entry in the excellent \"The Whistler\" series, SECRET OF THE WHISTLER tells the story of a crazed artist (Dix) who has killed his first wife and is preparing to do in his second. The police have cleared him of the first murder, but wife No. 2 can prove that he's the killer. With the help of some expert deduction, Dix's murderous nature is revealed. Engrossing as usual and well acted."
