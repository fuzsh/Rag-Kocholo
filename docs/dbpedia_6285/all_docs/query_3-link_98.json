        "text": "You find them dotted through every new housing estate, with pillars, stone balls, and a few pots of plastic topiary for the show home. They’re what the late critic Gavin Stamp memorably called “Kentucky Fried Georgian”.\n\nFive minutes from where I live in Milton Keynes there’s a whole array of houses of this ilk going up. In Fairfields, a brand-new Barratt development in the city’s north, a fair few of the 2,200 homes feature cheery pilaster columns and classical porticos framing the front doors, while symmetrically placed windows peep out over the nearby dual carriageway. They’re Bridgerton without the sex, a developer’s idea of a condensed country pile, where Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s disapproving visage might be caught peering into your Ring doorbell.\n\nIt’s easy to be a snob about contemporary takes on Georgian style, but this is a revival that has been with us for a century and shows no sign of going away. Especially as it’s recently had official backing from Sir Keir Starmer, who has long been promising “a decade of renewal” – or should that be reoldal?\n\nHe told the Labour Party conference last October that if he were to become prime minister we’d see a rise of new, Georgian-style housing in urban areas. Now in power, Labour has pledged to build 1.5 million “exemplary” homes over five years and ditched the previous government’s requirement that new homes be “beautiful”. But Sir Keir did call for “gentle urban development” of four to five storeys – all sounding a bit more fabric-softener commercial than your average building site.\n\n“I know why he’s done it,” says architecture critic Tom Dyckhoff. “It’s because he’s got to get these through planning and it’s the least controversial way to do it. But why does it always have to be Georgian? I’d love to see someone reviving 12th-century housing. Or a nice Roman courtyard house.”\n\nIt’s a good point. Why Georgian? “Its popularity is that it’s very easy to understand,” Professor Elizabeth McKellar, an architectural historian, tells me. “Although it’s classical in origin, you don’t need to understand anything about classical architecture to know if you like it or not.”\n\nThen there’s the density: the Georgians were masters at fitting as many long, narrow houses on a street as possible. The regularity of the classical proportions that dominated the period also makes it easy to replicate at scale. Municipal estates in the mid-20th century harked back to Georgian workers’ cottages. The 1960s modernists loved nothing more than referencing the immaculate facade of a Nash crescent in their heroic structures. And those 1980s postmodernists, well they couldn’t get enough of the dressing up box of architectural history, filling developments like Docklands with quoins, columns and porticos – often marked out in primary colours in case you thought they were being too serious.\n\nArchitecture and planning consultancy DK-CM is exactly the kind of forward-thinking company whose expertise may be called on to design the new Starmerite homes. When we talk about the style of developer houses currently being knocked out David Knight, its director, says, “Let’s call it debased Georgian.”\n\nThere’s a blunt reason why Georgian revival is still such a hit. “It does sell,” he says. “The market-related logic is ‘well, that’s what people want.’” And what they want, the developers say, must be a detached house with a Georgian porch, even if it’s just inches away from its neighbour, because the ones they’ve built have all sold. It’s hard to promote innovative new ideas when Britpop Georgian is still working.\n\nWhen she was researching the interwar period, McKellar recalls being astonished by just how much neo-Georgian housing was built in the 1920s and 30s. Avenues of mock-Georgian semis mingled with their Tudorbethan neighbours, creating an everyday pageant to Merrie England.\n\nVisit Welwyn Garden City, and you’ll find all manner of neo-Georgian buildings, the largest of which is the town’s very own department store, opened in 1939. It has the proportions and bearing of a great country house and is now a John Lewis – very much the National Trust of high-street shopping.\n\nWelwyn was the Poundbury of its day, that suburb of Dorchester sponsored since the mid-1980s by King Charles. Rather than the kitsch of Barratt and Bellway, Poundbury’s homes are designed by historicist architects, geeking out on every tiny reference and detail. Even so, there is something disconcerting about wandering around the place and seeing industrial-revolution warehouses going up, or estate agents filming Instagram pitches in recently completed Georgian squares. With its mix of sash windows and SUVs, it’s like an experiment in living in a Richard Curtis film.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that the two most-reliable touchstones used by developers to make new builds sound cosily acceptable are “Georgian” and “Garden City”. But it doesn’t always work. Take the proposed market town that Eton College wanted to build on land it owns at East Chiltington near the South Downs in Sussex.\n\nEven with its Poundbury-influenced, watercolour-style perspectives showing the 3,250 Georgian-style homes planned, Eton has so far been unable to persuade locals that this is a goer. After protests, the scheme was rejected by the previous government in October, showing that style is not the main issue when it comes to these developments. Instead, people worry more about sufficient infrastructure, environmental damage and the impact on their own lives, and a little less about the niceties of classical references. The housing crisis doesn’t get a look-in.\n\nPaying homage to less-refined Georgian precedents are the terraces of plain, modern flats and houses typified by those at Chobham Manor in Queen Elizabeth Park in east London, once home to the 2012 Olympics. Sure, there are hints of hipster New York warehouses to the brown brick, but the proportions of the windows, the flat fronts and the intent are pure Georgian.\n\nSome of the tricks are, too. Many of these bricks aren’t actual brick, but wafer-thin panels of pretend masonry bolted to a frame, cheating the façade just like Regency-era builders did with stucco, that smooth, stone-like plaster. These designs are from some of the most respected modern architects in town, such as Haworth Tompkins and Karakusevic Carson, bringing new life to old ideas.\n\nNone of these competing, contemporary versions bears much relation to one another, and the originators of each would be horrified at the comparison, but all cheerily trace their inspirations directly to very different Georgian precedents. Look how sophisticated the past was, some are saying. Or how daring. How plain. How decorative. How sober. How extravagant. For an architecture so famously rule-bound, Georgian seems wide-open to interpretation.\n\n“It’s incredibly flexible,” Professor McKellar tells me. “You can have a two-bedroom cottage, and you can have a 200-bedroom pile, and everything in between.” And, she reminds me, it works with different materials: stucco, Bath stone, London stock brick, Edinburgh sandstone.\n\nThose proportions, those details, those references should all make Georgian architecture thoroughly inflexible and unwieldy to reinterpretation, but instead it is in these constrictions that architects have found endless inspiration, the limitations fuelling centuries of creativity. What divides the houses of the 18th century from these modern homes is taste and class – an enduring obsession every bit as British as Jane Austen and William Hogarth.\n\nMention of the Georgians summons up images of empire-line dresses and Beau Brummell flash. But divorcing style from context can make for what Dyckhoff calls “a romantic bleaching of history”. While cities from Bristol to Liverpool have been facing up to their legacy of British imperialism, research into landowners, such as Henry Lascelles, founder of the Palladian Harewood House in Yorkshire, shows how sugar-plantation owners who made their money through the slave trade erected many of the majestic country houses of the Georgian period. It’s a reminder to be aware of the meaning behind styles we pilfer from the past.\n\nLabour may have ditched the beauty agenda, but last week, housing secretary Angela Rayner promised not to land the UK with “a load of ugly houses”.\n\n“I don’t mind if Keir Starmer or Angela Rayner really like Georgian townhouses. That’s great,” says planner David Knight. “I really like Georgian townhouses. But it’s not terribly useful when you’re sitting at the drawing board.”\n\nDK-CM, his company, has recently completed work for Hounslow council, trying to define good-quality housing. “You can probably imagine the kind of things that got talked about, but it wasn’t ‘Is it Georgian or not?’,” says Knight.\n\n“I’d advise Starmer that good housing is about more than external aesthetics,” he continues. “And that echoing a particular historical style should be less of a priority than a whole host of vital considerations like energy performance, spatial generosity, communal amenities, craft and public space.”\n\nWhile Knight and a new generation of architects and planners wrestle with what Starmer’s neo-Georgian revolution will mean in practice, developers continue to bash up examples. There appears no end in sight to the new estates, whose shiny coach lamps and fibreglass porticos bring the grand dreams of classical taste to a whole new generation of real-life costume dramas.\n\nJohn Grindrod is author of Iconicon and Outskirts: Living Life on the Edge of the Green Belt"
