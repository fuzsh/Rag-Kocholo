In The Whistler, a guilt-stricken man hires a contract killer to end his life… but finds he cannot pull out of the deal. The Mark of the Whistler sees a homeless man claim the money in an abandoned bank account, only to find the rightful owners on his tail. In The Power of the Whistler, an amnesiac must reconstruct his dark past using only the items in his pockets. Voice of the Whistler finds a poor nurse marry her wealthy, terminally ill patient, only for him to defy the odds and recover. In Mysterious Intruder, a private eye becomes embroiled in a murderous race to track down a missing girl and a lost fortune. The Secret of the Whistler sees a young bride suspect that her new husband may have murdered his first wife. In Dix’s final film, The Thirteenth Hour, the owner of a trucking company is framed for a murder he didn’t commit. Finally, in The Return of the Whistler, Michael Duane takes the lead as a man whose fiancée is abducted on the eve of their wedding.\n\nThis essential four-disc collection marks the UK Blu-ray premiere of all eight films, and features an array of fascinating contextualising extras, including newly recorded commentaries, critical appreciations, rare archival short films, and a 120-page book. Strictly limited to 6,000 individually numbered units.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION 4 x BLU-RAY BOX SET SPECIAL FEATURES\n\nHigh Definition presentations of The Whistler, The Power of the Whistler, Voice of the Whistler, Mysterious Intruder, The Secret of the Whistler, The Thirteenth Hour, and The Return of the Whistler\n\nStandard Definition presentation of The Mark of the Whistler\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nAudio commentary with film historian Josh Nelson on The Whistler (2024)\n\nAudio commentary with professor and film scholar Jason A Ney on The Power of the Whistler (2024)\n\nAudio commentary with film historian Lee Gambin on Voice of the Whistler(2024)\n\nAudio commentary with film historian Jeremy Arnold on Mysterious Intruder(2024)\n\nAudio commentary with academic and curator Eloise Ross on The Thirteenth Hour (2024)\n\nKim Newman on ‘The Whistler’ (2024): in-depth exploration of the film series by the critic and author\n\nKim Newman on William Castle (2024): overview of the cult filmmaker’s early career as a studio-contracted director, prior to his successes as an independent showman best known for his macabre genre movies\n\nStuart Holmes Oral History (1958): rare archival audio recording of the prolific character actor in conversation with historian George Pratt\n\nIt’s Murder (1944): dramatised documentary, produced by Columbia Pictures for the war effort and featuring a number of cast and crew members from The Whistler film series\n\nIt’s Your America (c. 1945): dramatised documentary focusing on soldiers returning from World War II, directed by John Ford and featuring J Carroll Naish, the antagonist in The Whistler\n\nImage galleries: promotional and publicity materials\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive 120-page book with a new essay by Tim Lucas, archival interviews with actor Richard Dix, an extract from director William Castle’s autobiography, an archival article on the popularity of the radio show, new writing on the short films, and film credits\n\nWorld premieres on Blu-ray\n\nLimited edition box set of 6,000 individually numbered units for the UK\n\nAll extras subject to change"
