According to an unidentified news item in the AMPAS Library clipping files, Olivia de Havilland, who left Warner Bros. following her success in Gone with the Wind and refused subsequent assignments with the studio, was assigned to the film after being \"brought flouncing back by threat of suspension.\" According to a biography of de Havilland and her sister, Joan Fontaine, director Curtis Bernhardt encountered some difficulties in presenting de Havilland and Wyman as professional violinists. Although Wyman had no trouble faking the finger movements on a dummy violin, de Havilland apparently had no patience for it. Bernhardt attempted to disguise the problem by using a mask of de Havilland's face on a professional violinst, but the plan failed when the musician complained that she could not see or breathe through the mask. The director then thought of using a double to play the violin in semidarkness or in silhouette, but that idea was rejected when it was noted that the script called for a brightly lit classroom. Bernhardt finally solved the problem by having a professional violinist hide behind de Havilland and reach around her to perform the complicated fingering while the actress played the bow with her right hand. The file for the film in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library contains a letter dated 22 Mar 1939, in which the PCA informed Warner Bros. that the story was \"unacceptable\" under the Code primarily because of the \"suggestion that 'Julius Malette' is an habitual adulterer and that his illicit relationships are condoned by his wife and others.\" To avoid a censorship problem with the story, the PCA suggested the \"removal of suggestions that Malette was a philanderer and adulterer and his hopes to make Amelia his mistress.\"\n\nLess\n\nAmelia Cornell, a talented scholarship student at the Brissac Academy of Music in New York, finds that she is unable to continue her studies without outside assistance.
