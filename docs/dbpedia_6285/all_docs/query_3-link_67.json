Join us, and you’ll understand why Aloha Whistler captures the hearts of visitors year after year.\n\nYour unforgettable journey starts here.\n\nAs opening day approaches and we all start dusting off our ski, snowboard, and winter adventure gear, let’s take a look at some of the facts about Whistler’s snowfall and winter weather to help you prepare for the coming season.\n\nWhistler Blackcomb Climate Facts\n\nWhistler and Blackcomb are located in the Coast Mountain Range, given that name due to their proximity to the Pacific coast. Being so close to the ocean means Whistler Blackcomb is blessed with moderate winter weather. Temperatures here don’t typically go lower than -10°C (12°F) in the valley and -15°C (5°F) in the alpine during the coldest part of the year.\n\nAverage Alpine Temperatures for Whistler Blackcomb\n\nDecember to February\n\nLow: -12°C / 11°F\n\nHigh: -5°C / 23°F\n\nMarch to May\n\nLow: -8°C / 19°F\n\nHigh: 5°C / 42°F\n\nAverage Snowfall\n\n465 inches / 38.7 ft / 11.8 m per year on summit\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean it can’t get considerably colder than that, so always prepare accordingly with layers that can be added or subtracted to keep you cozy and well-ventilated on the slopes or on the streets of the village.\n\nSnowfall Stats\n\nWhistler Blackcomb consistently offers some of the most reliable snow conditions in the Coast Mountain Range, receiving an average annual snowfall of around 11 meters, and 86 annual snowfall days.\n\nIt’s no secret that Whistler is legendary for its powder–but check out the chart below showing a variety of stats that might help you plan your trip around when you’re most likely to get the best conditions for shredding the slopes.\n\nImage source: https://www.onthesnow.com/british-columbia/whistler-blackcomb/historical-snowfall\n\nIn spite of its proximity to the coast, Whistler’s snow is known for being fluffy, light, and as you can see from the chart above, plentiful. Snow on these mountains is generally dry and ready to be carved up for your board or skis.\n\nSo–itching for opening day, yet?\n\nDress For The Alpine Weather\n\nThere are a few main factors to consider when it comes to your winter weather gear. Ideally you want to hit that Goldilocks zone where you’re neither too hot or too cold–just right.\n\nThis means having breathable materials that allow for ventilation and wicking away the moisture from your body. But you also want to have a shell that protects you from the wind if it’s a particularly cold day.\n\nStaying warm but not too warm is all about layers that you can add or remove as needed. And it’s always a good idea to invest in certain high quality items, especially socks and gloves.\n\nMaking sure you’re properly dressed can mean the difference between a great day or a miserable day, so plan carefully and pack accordingly!\n\nGet Your Gear Ready\n\nIf you don’t have gear or aren’t sure where to get it, here are a few options to get your gear ready:\n\nWhistler Winter Wear: They deliver right to your door and you can try on multiple sizes until you have exactly the right fit. They cover clothing, skis, and snowboards.\n\nWhistler Sport Legacies: Located at the Whistler Olympic Park, they have you covered for your snowshoes and skis, and offer both daily and full-season rentals.\n\nBlack Tie Ski Rental: They have skis (cross country and alpine), boards, boots, and locations on both mountains, and free delivery with custom fitting.\n\nBest Times to Visit Whistler During Winter Season\n\nFor maximum excitement, consider coming for your trip in November and December. With activity on the mountains ramping up there can be quiet days with short lift lines and even cheaper accommodations, but this is an exciting time when Whistler is packed with events and holiday activities. So keep that in mind when you plan your trip!\n\nWith events like Wintersphere and The Fire and Ice Show, and a whole lot more, any time through November and December will be a memorable experience filled with excitement for you and your family.\n\nFor powderhounds, January and February bring some of the coldest temperatures and the driest, fluffiest snow of the winter season. Likewise, there’s a slight drop-off in visitors, so you’re likely to have somewhat shorter wait times for the lift and fewer people on the mountain.\n\nThe Village is generally quieter during this time as well–except during spring break–so getting that reservation at your favorite restaurant should be easier too.\n\nOpening Day\n\nFor many people the countdown has already started and the date is marked on every calendar they own–November 23, 2023 is the opening day for the 23/24 season at Whistler Blackcomb.\n\nOne exciting announcement for those itching to get on the slopes this year is that Whistler-Blackcomb’s Fitzsimmons Express chairlift is being replaced this year with a high speed 8-person lift, which will reduce wait times and get you up the mountain faster.\n\nJust another reason to have your gear ready for November 23!

With plenty of family-friendly activity options, Whistler is the perfect location for a Spring Break holiday.\n\nAt this time of year, Whistler offers the best of both worlds; bring your bike for a spin on the paved Valley Trail network but don’t forget your skis and snowboards because there are still several weeks of riding left.

The mountains have received 25 centimetres of fresh snow in the last 48 hours, with more forecast overnight and early next week.\n\nWhy not do it all?

Food and beverage locations on and off the mountains have seen a fundamental shift, with quintessential mountain menu items like pizza and fries being complemented by fresh, healthy and locally-sourced alternatives. Vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options are now easy to find on the mountains and changes like these are only the beginning.\n\n“My passion is food and the environment we live in,” says Sterr. “I am fortunate that my job allows me the opportunity to focus on both. In recent years we have been able to introduce a wide variety of new, healthy options for our guests so we can fuel them up properly for their time in the mountains. We can now cater to people with all kinds of dietary restrictions and all the while we are doing what we can to reduce our impact on the environment by using locally-sourced ingredients as much as possible and participating in environmentally-focused food initiatives like the Vancouver Aquarium’s Ocean Wise program.”\n\nThe innovation continues this winter with Wolfgang and his team stepping things up in the Whistler Blackcomb food and beverage world even further. From new recipes, partnerships, events and tweaks to old favourites, here is the rundown on everything new and noteworthy in the Whistler Blackcomb kitchens:\n\nRaven’s Nest: Whistler Blackcomb’s All Vegetarian Restaurant\n\nRaven’s Nest, located at the top of the Creekside Gondola on Whistler Mountain, has undergone some major changes for the 2014.2015 winter season. It is Whistler Blackcomb’s first ever all vegetarian restaurant and one of the first of its kind at ski resorts in North America. The all plant-based menu will feature a variety of options inspired by flavours from around the world and will also include some specialty vegan dishes. Carnivores need not worry, the restaurant will have a small selection of meat options available for those who ask, however they will not be advertised on the restaurant’s menu boards. The all vegetarian concept for Raven’s Nest was the brainchild of WB Executive Chef, Wolfgang Sterr, who is a vegetarian, and fellow Whistler Blackcomb employee and vegan, Kristine Leise.\n\nVij’s Curry Stations at Roundhouse Lodge and Wizard Grill\n\nNew this winter, guests will be able to enjoy a selection of Vij’s curries at the Roundhouse Lodge on Whistler Mountain and the Wizard Grill at the base of Blackcomb.

The sun is shining, the temperatures are soaring, the snow is melting, the beaches and golf courses are open, and the mountain bike trails are getting prepared for an opening in the very near future (May 17th, to be exact).\n\nWith temperatures reaching the 30’s (Mid 80’s for my American friends), it’s not uncommon to see the general population in Whistler wearing shorts, t-shirts and flip-flops, while standing beside a skier or snowboarder who’s fully decked out in gear which looks WAY too warm.\n\n(Case in point. PS, retro one-piece suits NEVER go out of style in Spring time)\n\nThat being said, the end of May brings about a new sport – the Whistler Triathlon (I wonder if we can turn this into an Olympic sport). The Whistler Triathlon isn’t your regular run of the mill triathlon. In fact for a very short period, between May 17th (opening of the Bike Park) until May 27th (last day of spring skiing on Blackcomb) opens up a window for the die-hards. Start the day off skiing or snowboarding, followed up with a downhill mountain bike ride in the afternoon, and topped off with a round of golf or a wakeboard at Green Lake in the late afternoon. Or for those feeling VERY adventurous, you can even possibly make it to Vancouver Island in time for an evening surf session.\n\nYou know you’re in a sports oriented town when these are serious discussions, of how many different sports you can accomplish in one day!\n\nMaybe this is why no one seems to age in this town 😉\n\nComments\n\nName\n\nEmail Address\n\nComment"
