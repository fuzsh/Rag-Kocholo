        "meta_description": "On a\r\nnight that’s raining felines and canines, Theodore “Ted” Nichols (Michael\r\nDuane) and his French fiancée Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert) reach the\r\nhome of the justice of the peace who’s going to join them in holy\r\nmatrimony…even though they have only known each other for a couple of\r\nweeks.  The justice’s wife (Sarah Padden) sadly tells the would-be\r\nnewlyweds that her husband’s return to town has been delayed by the inclement\r\nweather, and that they’ll need to delay the proceedings until the next day. \r\nThe wedding eve goes more sour still when Ted’s car conks out (after a\r\nmysterious individual monkeys with something under the hood), and the couple\r\ncan find no room at the only hotel in town.A\r\nnone-too-sympathetic night clerk (Olin Howland) nevertheless agrees to rent\r\nthem a room (after collecting a double sawbuck under the table from Ted), but\r\nwhen he learns that the two of them haven’t yet legally tied the knot, Ted has\r\nto get out.  Our hero tells Alice that he’ll catch some Z’s at the garage\r\nwhile the mechanic tends to his automobile.  The next morning, when\r\nTed arrives to wake his bride-to-be, he finds a maintenance man (William\r\nNewell) painting the room.  When the night clerk is contacted, he tells\r\nTed that Alice left a half hour after he did…no explanation offered.  So\r\nthe hunt is on for the missing Alice, with Ted receiving a little help from a\r\nprivate gumshoe (Richard Lane) answering to “Gaylord Traynor.”The Return of the Whistler (1948), the swan\r\nsong of Columbia’s 1944-48 film series based on the popular CBS Radio West\r\nCoast mystery program, is also the weakest of the eight movies in the franchise\r\nfor a few reasons.  Richard Dix, the star of the previous seven Whistler vehicles,\r\nretired from the silver screen in 1947. Actor Michael Duane, who had\r\nappeared in the earlier The Secret of the Whistler (1946),\r\ntook over as the protagonist.  Duane was a competent actor, but it was\r\nkind of hard to accept him in the series after Dix had made such a memorable\r\nimpression in the early films.  (In Duane’s defense, Dix would probably\r\nhave had trouble convincingly playing the young bachelor at the center of Return’s plot.) Return was\r\nalso helmed by D. Ross Lederman, a journeyman director whose contemporaries\r\nonce described his talent behind the camera as “the original bull in the china\r\nshop.”  (Lederman, a former stuntman, did display a talent for\r\nchoreographing fight scenes.)The Return of the Whistler is also missing the franchise’s trademark “twist ending”\r\nthat defined the previous entries in the series (not to mention the radio\r\nseries).  But it sort of gets a pass here because the screenplay—written\r\nby Edward Bock and Maurice Tombragel—is based on a Cornell Woolrich short\r\nstory, “All at Once, No Alice,” which compensates with plenty of turns and\r\ntwists in its brief 62-minute running time.  Woolrich’s “Dormant Account”\r\nwas also the inspiration for the second Whistler film, The Mark of the\r\nWhistler (1944)—and his name is familiar to both classic film fans\r\n(his stories and novels were used for such films as Phantom Lady, The\r\nWindow and Rear Window) and old-time radio devotees (with\r\nshows like Suspense and Escape doing\r\nadaptations of his “The Black Curtain,” “The Black Path of Fear” and “Papa\r\nBenjamin”).Despite\r\nthe absence of Dix, Return of the Whistler is still a very\r\nentertaining little B-noir, boasting a fine cast that also includes James\r\nCardwell and Ann Shoemaker, with familiar character faces like Trevor Bardette,\r\nAnn Doran, Robert Emmett Keane and Jack Rice on hand as well.  Lenore\r\nAubert, an actress who enjoyed a brief film career in the 1940s, is probably\r\nbest known to Bud &amp; Lou fans as the villainess in their horror\r\ncomedies Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)\r\nand Abbott &amp; Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff (1949). \r\nRichard Lane, another Columbia stock player, gets borrowed from the\r\nstudio’s Boston Blackie franchise (he was Inspector Faraday)\r\nto play the part of the skeptical P.I. who lends Duane’s Nichols a hand in\r\nfinding Aubert.  Because this was the final film in the Whistler series,\r\nit’s interesting to note that this is the only film in which the omnipresent\r\nnarrator (voiced by Otto Forrest) is in desperate need of an umbrella (in the\r\nopening sequence)…unless you count the sea spray in the previous Voice\r\nof the Whistler (1945).With\r\nthe airing of The Return of the Whistler this Saturday on\r\nTurner Classic Movies (October 6 at 10:45am), TCM finishes up its Whistler festival. Next\r\nWednesday, we’ll review the two films that didn’t make\r\nthe TCM cut: The Mark of the Whistler (1944) and The\r\nThirteenth Hour (1947).",
