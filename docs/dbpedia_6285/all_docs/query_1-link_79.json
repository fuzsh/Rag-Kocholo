Too many women did not have their lives appropriately documented. To the people who have kept the details of these lives alive, I want to say thanks for the assistance. The amount of help I have received in writing this book has been legion. If I have left out a name, it is not from a lack of appreciation; it's only my faulty memory.\n\nI can never sing the praises of our public library system loud enough. Oh that we could divert our defense budget to these worthwhile people for one year! The Glendale, California Library System sent me pages of information on Charlotte Armstrong and aided me with all the research on her life. J. Alec West put me in touch with them, and I owe him a huge debt of gratitude.\n\nNo acknowledgement list would be complete without thanking the university library system as well. Boston University Library has a wonderful collection of mystery authors' correspondence. Nathaniel Parks has been incredible, helping me with virtually every author that I chose to profile. Additionally, Lilly Library at Indiana University is always a joy to work with. The Boucher / White collection never fails to amaze me with its breadth and depth. Thanks too to the Maryland Historical Society for its help with the Leslie Ford transcripts and to the University of New Mexico and Rose Diaz for their help with the Dorothy B. Hughes transcripts.\n\nTo the families of the authors, thank you as well for opening your families and memories to me. I appreciate the efforts of the Lewi family who wrote a wonderful memoir of their life with their mother.\n\nThe flanx of editors who read my book, made comments and helped were invaluable to me. Hats off to Rob Perry for his comments, to Rob Day for making me laugh as he used all my red pens on my book. Dean James answered millions of my questions patiently and politely as a good Southern gentleman would. I definitely want to thank all three of them.\n\nChristina Albin Laboski did a wonderful job on the cover, and helped with the images in the book. It's not easy to be brilliant and pregnant at the same time, but somehow she managed.\n\nMy own family has been incredibly gracious about accepting my writing into our family when these women occupied so much of my thought. Other families might have thought me crazy for spending so much time locked in the past. Mine accepted my mania and helped to talk about it as I could. My parents have always loved and accepted me for who I am, for that I am eternally and perpetually grateful. My sister is a rock of support in designer clothes, and her two boys will talk for hours with me about ideas for more books and more book parties. Of course, Tony listens to me and manages while I have my nose stuck in a book. All these people mean a lot to me.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction.\n\nChapter 1: Margaret Millar\n\nChapter 2: Leslie Ford\n\nChapter 3: Phoebe Atwood Taylor\n\nChapter 4: Dorothy B.

No realm was exempt from the societal changes following the end of World War II and radical changes in the writing of the detective mysteries ensued.\n\nThe first Golden Age of mystery had ended with the advent of the Second World War. This pinnacle in mystery fiction is usually defined as the time between the great wars, 1918 to 1939. During this era, the Great Detective ruled, a larger-than-life character whose deductive brain solved the vital puzzle.\n\nWhile England boasted many women authors during the first Golden Age, the U.S. could not. Only a few American women wrote detective stories on our soil prior to World War II. Anna Katherine Green, recognized as one of the earliest female mystery authors with The Leavenworth Case in 1878, didn’t publish much beyond the start of World War I. Her detectives were archetypal busybodies, nosy single women like Amelia Butterworth and Violet Strange.\n\nOne of the few American woman authors of the first Golden Age, Mary Roberts Rinehart, established a firm place in the hearts of her fans during the first three decades of the 1900s. She wrote romantic suspense, now frequently derided as gothic or the Had I But Known school of mystery. Her books featured heroines who foolishly plunged into the danger of an isolated basement or darkened hallway, saying afterwards Had I but known what murderous villain waited for me. Her novels paved the way for mysteries with more romantic interest, such as those written by Mignon G. Eberhart and Leslie Ford.\n\nAnother American woman, Carolyn Wells, began her own mystery series in 1909, featuring Fleming Stone. The sixty-one book series spanned four decades and covered a period in American history that included women’s suffrage, flappers, and later, working women.\n\nDuring the long years of the Second World War, the traditional mystery lost popularity. American men who had fought in Europe and the Pacific no longer cared for cozy, estate home murders. They had seen war and death in reality. Their new fiction had to reflect the darker, harder life the soldiers had seen in Europe and the Pacific. The frightening thought of other countries unleashing nuclear bombs invaded the veterans’ fiction as well.\n\nBy 1945, the middle class returned to the U.S. greeted by rising incomes and unprecedented demand for consumer goods. After sixteen years of depression and then rations, American buyers wanted new and improved everything, including fiction.\n\nAdding to the changes in the genre, many of the more blithe puzzle practitioners passed away before the end of the war or pursued other interests. Leaders in the field, like S. S. Van Dine, had passed away before Pearl Harbor. Others, like Ellery Queen, changed roles in the genre following the war, concentrating more on the publication of literary criticism and his magazine. The loss of these American authors left the gentler side of the genre near empty by the end of the war.\n\nYet even with these losses, English mystery writing changed little after 1945. Agatha Christie continued to publish a book or two per year. Some of her best work came from the late 1940s and early 1950s: The Hollow, A Murder is Announced, and Funerals are Fatal among them. The form was safe in England with its Grand Dame at the helm. Even today, many reviewers and bookstores classify the British Cozy as a subgenre in mystery.\n\nHowever, America had changed, becoming more concerned with the nuclear horrors unleashed in 1945. The Cold War and McCarthyism brought a new type of mystery category to life, the spy novel. The fears of Communist takeover led to a new fiction category replacing the deduction of a crafty killer with the hunt for a mysterious agitator who threatened the world and our way of life. This type of book was almost exclusively masculine in nature; the spy was a super man who loved women and lots of them. His hyper-masculinity meshed well with the gritty private eye novels being written by Mickey Spillane and similar authors. This new fiction left little room for women authors at a time when more women were writing mysteries.\n\nMore traditional mysteries still could be found in shorter formats. The popularity of digest-sized collections of short stories made for an easier way to read mystery fiction. The writers and characters who survived the changes in the mystery form now found their names in these short story magazines. Ellery Queen, Craig Rice, The Saint, Mickey Spillane, and Ed McBain had magazines named after them, which provided new mystery outlets. The television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents became a fertile ground for mystery short stories; Hitchcock used short mystery fiction for many of his half-hour television episodes. Author Charlotte Armstrong wrote for his series in 1960.\n\nAfter a short flirtation with short stories in the 1950s, publishers winnowed the magazines to three or four. With that reduction in magazines, the genre was considered to be heading into decline. Some critics even declared the traditional mystery novel dead, replaced by spy fiction and private eyes.\n\nGeo-political factors were not the only cause of change in the reading habits of Americans. Television became a national pastime with ownership rising dramatically during the 1950s. Public consumption of books suffered with the fascination for this new medium. The reliance on technology and science to cure all ills led to a decrease in the use of the written word to communicate ideas. Why envision an imaginary place of words when an entire galaxy of images beckoned? The changes of the era hurt sales of the writers, but gave them a freedom to try new techniques and to fail as well.\n\nWhile the channels available in mystery fiction had shrunk, the number of women who wrote grew. In the years from 1945 through 1960, an element of experimentation in American detective fiction flourished, especially among women authors who found themselves excluded from the private eye and spy fiction establishments. These women authors took the crime novel in new and innovative directions since the prevailing forms had so little use for them. They wrote about places not usually mentioned in fiction, about psychological traumas unheard of outside of textbooks and non-traditional protagonists.\n\nThe women in this book are authors who staked a place in mystery fiction and moved the genre forward into its rebirth. Their creativity and talent marked them as unique in this era and as touchstones for writers to come. Tragically, their influences on later authors are almost all that remains. Most of the authors who wrote in this period are no longer in print today, despite being exceptional writers.\n\nThis generation of authors, even though their ages vary by about a decade and a half, would be the first to have unheralded opportunities available to them. They lived on the cusp of great changes in our society: air travel, birth control, greater civil rights. Women discovered the inventions that would free them from the hard work of the kitchens and family. New choices abounded. They could have family, home, career, and adventure.\n\nNonetheless, the seven authors whose biographies appear in Atomic Renaissance were hampered by their family obligations in ways that men were not. Even burdened by these additional duties, these women created the architecture for the second Golden Age of mystery, the rebirth of all types of mystery fiction that started in the 1980s. The selected authors include top sellers, Mystery Writers of America (MWA) presidents, Edgar award winners, and MWA Grand Masters. They contributed to the films of the day, both as scriptwriters and sources. Without these seven women, today’s form would be severely narrowed in scope. The subgenres we know as regionals, gay and lesbian, strong women detectives, psychological suspense, softboiled suspense novels, and historical mysteries had their beginnings with these authors.\n\nAll of these writers worked in the period between mystery's Golden Ages, in a time where most male crime writers wrote about men fighting men. That is not to say that all these women wrote identically. All seven women took the design of the great detective and made it their own. Patricia Highsmith’s stories of guilt and redemption can only be superficially compared to the psychological insights of Margaret Millar or the layered dark suspense yarns of Dorothy B. Hughes. Even though each author is different, every one of these seven took the crime novel in a different direction at a time where its future was uncertain. By the use of non-traditional characters and places, the novels expanded the definition of crime fiction. Indeed, Charlotte Armstrong’s Edgar award-winning A Dram of Poison didn’t even include a death in the book, a concept unlikely a generation before.\n\nTheir styles ranged from bleak to hysterical. Phoebe Atwood Taylor had a style unlike any other mystery author then or now. Whether writing about stern Asey Mayo or comical Leonidas Witherall, her humor and the strong regional flavor of her books are evident.\n\nThese seven authors helped pave the way for Marcia Muller’s Sharon McCone, who in turn helped open the door for Sara Paretsky’s V. I. Warshawski and Sue Grafton’s Kinsey Millhone. The authors behind these characters helped to bring Sisters-in-Crime to life and make the playing field in the genre more level. The maledominated mystery world of the 1950s could never have predicted the changes to the form.\n\nThis is not to say these seven are the only writers who affected the genre during this time period. Other authors, both wellknown and popular, wrote during the 1940s and 1950s. Mary Roberts Rinehart and Craig Rice are not included here because their works do not change and grow to the same extent that these seven authors do. Other authors like Helen McCloy, Helen MacInnes, and Celia Fremlin, through their life events and the volume of their works, deserve full-length biographies to explore their contributions to mystery.\n\nAdditionally, a number of authors deserve more recognition than they currently receive: Dorothy Salisbury Davis; Kelley Roos who wrote the delightful Jeff and Haila Troy series; Frances Crane who wrote a series with colorful titles that preceded John D. MacDonald by over a decade: Hannah Lees; Mildred Davis who had a talent for edge of the seat thrillers; and many more.\n\nThere were other authors who made a huge splash in their time, but have faded without a ripple. This collection of authors had a lasting impact on the genre through their innovations to the crime novel of the 1940s and 1950s. Their history has helped to determine our present in the mystery field.\n\nCHAPTER 1 — Margaret Millar\n\nMargaret Millar is more readily recognized as Mrs. Ross Macdonald today than as an exceptional mystery author in her own right. Yet in the decades following World War II, Millar won numerous honors for her novels. She garnered three nominations for the Best Novel Edgar, the award for writing excellence from the Mystery Writers of America (MWA). In 1956,"
