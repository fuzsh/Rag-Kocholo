        "text": "Justin Turner and his wife Kourtney are officially parents. On Tuesday, the Toronto Blue Jays player and his wife took to Instagram to announce the arrival of their son, Bo Jordan Turner. The couple shared the news with a photo of their newborn with a sign that read, \"Hello world.\"\n\n\"Bo Jordan Turner. Our little dual citizen came into the world like a firecracker on the 4th of July!\" The pair captioned the joint post. \"He tried to prove to mom that being early is possible! She appreciates the humour but more so the few extra weeks with him! We are so in love with you, baby boy!\"\n\nIn the comments, fans congratulated the new parents on welcoming their first child.\n\n\"Congratulations to the three of you! He’s beautiful and one lucky baby!\" an Instagram user wrote.\n\n\"Congratulations Turners! He's absolutely perfect,\" another added.\n\n\"The most perfect angel!\" someone else chimed in.\n\nIn May, the couple spoke about their gender reveal during an episode of her podcast, \"Holding Kourt.\"\n\nAccording to the couple, they believed they were having a girl based off of what their doctor \"accidentally\" let slip. The couple said their doctor purposely mislead them to believe they were having a girl, resulting in a shocking gender reveal for the couple.\n\n\"We pop the confetti and it's blue,\" Kourtney said. \"And I scream because now I feel like I'm being pranked.”\n\n\"We are both so excited to be having a boy, and like insanely excited, I was literally in shock, and was like, my wheels were spinning a million miles an hour, and I was trying to figure out what the heck,\" Justin recalled.\n\nJustin and Kourtney's love story began when they first met in 2012 at an event in Los Angeles — where Kourtney was based at the time. Despite living in different cities, they made their long-distance relationship work until 2014, when Turner signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2017, they tied the knot in an outdoor ceremony in San Jose del Cabo, Mexico.\n\nIn March, the couple surprised fans with an Instagram post announcing her pregnancy. Kourtney shared a photo of herself and Justin on a beach proudly holding their ultrasound photos.\n\n\"Coming soon,\" she captioned the post, leaving fans eagerly anticipating the arrival of their little one."
