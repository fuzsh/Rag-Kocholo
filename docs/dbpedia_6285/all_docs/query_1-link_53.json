        "text": "Mystery dramas were massively popular with American listeners during the Golden Age of Radio. The Whistler, which ran on CBS from 1942 to 1955 with 692 episodes, was one of them. I’ve never heard of it, even though I’m a fan of vintage radio shows, notably The Saint (1947-1951), which starred Vincent Price (of course) as Leslie Charteris’s ‘devil-may-care Robin Hood’ Simon Templar.\n\nAnd just as RKO adapted The Saint for a series of feature films (1938-1943) with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair taking on Templar’s mantle, Columbia Pictures did the same with The Whistler – as part of their series of B-movie crime programmers like Boston Blackie. Between 1944 and 1948, eight B-features, running just 60 minutes each, were produced. Oscar-nominated actor Richard Dix, who was picked based on his performance in Val Lewton’s The Ghost Ship, starred in seven, and Michael Duane played the lead in the last one as Dix had decided to retire from acting.\n\nThe Whistler (voiced by Otto Forrest, who reminded me of American psychic Criswell) acted as the host/narrator, emerging as a shadow with a haunting whistle and heavy footsteps to introduce and comment on the action in each twisted tale of crime and punishment in which Dix would play different characters that were either heroic, villainous or everyman besieged by fate.\n\nFuture gimmick showman William Castle cut his filmmaking teeth directing four of the features, bringing an eerie air with some low-key lighting effects and inventive camera angles (that would inform his later work), and by bringing them under budget, Castle became an in-demand director throughout the 1950s until he decided to go independent and scare the pants off America with such classics as House on Haunted Hill and Strait-Jacket.\n\nFor Indicator’s sixth release in their Columbia Noir collection, all eight films have been brought together in a four-disc Blu-ray box set. Each disc has two features alongside an array of extras, including commentaries, critical appreciations and image galleries, and a 120-page booklet which includes new and archival essays, including a great one from Tim Lucas (I especially liked how he connected these films to David Lynch’s Blue Velvet). If you have never seen these films, I recommend reading Tim’s article and tuning into Kim Newman’s essential primer, A Whistle-Stop Tour, on the first disc beforehand.\n\nDISC ONE\n\nThe Whistler (1944, dir William Castle)\n\nAfter failing to save his wife (Gloria Stuart, of The Old Dark House and Titanic fame) from drowning at sea, guilt-stricken industrialist Earl C. Conrad (Dix) hires a contract killer (House of Frankenstein’s J. Carrol Naish) to end his life – but when his wife turns up alive, he discovers he can’t renege on the deal.\n\nThe Mark of the Whistler (1944, dir William Castle)\n\nIn this tale, scripted by The Devil Bat‘s George Bricker, based on pulp fiction author Cornell Woolrich’s short story, Dormant Account, homeless drifter Lee Nugent (Dix) swindles $30,000 from an abandoned bank account by impersonating someone with the same name. But he’s soon targeted by the rightful owner’s sons (one of whom is played by famed US magician John Calvert).\n\n• Audio commentary with film historian Josh Nelson on The Whistler (2024)\n\n• A Whistle-Stop Tour (2024, 25 mins): an in-depth overview of the film series by critic and author Kim Newman\n\n• It’s Your America (1945, 36 mins): a dramatised documentary focusing on soldiers returning from World War II, directed by John Ford and featuring J. Carrol Naish.\n\nDISC TWO\n\nThe Power of the Whistler (1945, dir Lew Landers)\n\nFortune teller Jean Lang (Janis Carter) is determined to help amnesiac William Everest (Dix) uncover his name and past using the items he carries in his pockets – but gets the shock of her life when he turns out to be an escaped maniac from a mental hospital. Director Landers worked on over 100 features throughout his 50+ year career, including the classic Bela Lugosi/Boris Karloff 1935 horror, The Raven.\n\nVoice of the Whistler (1945, dir William Castle)\n\nLoneliness is the key theme in this entry as the wealthy John Sinclair (Dix), who has six months to live, makes a deal with his nurse, Joan (Lynn Merrick), that they marry, and she will inherit his fortune after his death. Seven months after settling into a refurbished lighthouse, John is still very much alive, Joan wants out, and her ex-fiancé Fred (James Cardwell) returns to claim her back… Cue some deadly action as Fred and John try to bump each other off.\n\n• Audio commentary with film scholar Professor Jason A Ney on The Power of the Whistler (2024)\n\n• Audio commentary with the late film historian Lee Gambin (who tragically died, aged just 44, in May, on Voice of the Whistler (2024)\n\n• The Noir City Interview with Robert Dix (2010, 19 mins): an interview with the son of Richard Dix, recorded in LA following a screening of The Power of the Whistler\n\n• Stuart Holmes Oral History (1958, 69 mins): archival audio recording of the prolific character actor in conversation with historian George Pratt\n\nDISC THREE\n\nMysterious Intruder (1946, dir William Castle)\n\nUnscrupulous private detective Don Gale (Dix) gets mixed up in murder and mayhem when he’s hired to find a missing girl whose family inheritance contains two rare collectable song recordings from real-life Swedish singer Jenny Lind. This one features Barton MacLane, who famously played General Peterson in I Dream of Jeannie and professional wrestler/Hollywood heavy Mike Mazurki. It was also Castle’s final feature in the series as he would head off to work with Orson Welles on The Lady from Shanghai.\n\nThe Secret of the Whistler (1946, dir George Sherman)\n\nDix plays ‘kept husband’ Ralph Harrison, who poisons his wealthy wife Edith (Mary Currier), who suffers from bouts of heart attacks, so he can marry artist model Kay (Leslie Brooks). But Edith soon becomes suspicious. A well-acted, well-paced entry from director George Sherman, best known for low-budget Westerns in the 1930s and 1940s, and also the 1971 John Wayne classic, Big Jake, which marked his final feature.\n\n• Audio commentary with film historian Jeremy Arnold on Mysterious Intruder (2024)\n\n• Working in the Shadows (2024, 22 mins): Kim Newman looks over William Castle’s early career as a studio-contracted director\n\nDISC FOUR\n\nThe Thirteenth Hour (1947, dir William Clemens)\n\nHere, Dix plays Steve Reynolds, a trucking company owner who can’t get a brake as a rival firm wants him out of the picture. Framed for running down a police officer, Steve, with the help of his fiancé Eileen (Karen Morley) and her son Tommy (Mark Dennis), is determined to prove his innocence armed with a crucial piece of evidence – a glove containing diamonds in the thumb. It was a tremendous final stint from Dix and well-directed by William Clemens, who had previously helmed three Falcon films (RKO’s The Saint imitations). Karen Morley had a burgeoning career in the 1930s and 1940s (check her out in 1932’s The Mask of Fu Manchu), but her career floundered after being blacklisted by the Un-American Activities Committee. Little Mark Dennis also appeared in 1947’s Secret Beyond the Door and 1968’s Targets.\n\nThe Return of the Whistler (1948, dir D. Ross Lederman)\n\nAnother Cornell Woolrich story, All At Once, No Alice, forms the basis for this final entry in the series. Helmed by another actioner director, D. Ross Lederman, it stars Michael Duane as a man whose fiancée Alice (Lenore Aubert, best known for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein) is abducted on the eve of their wedding. As he – and a dogged PI (Boston Blackie regular Richard Lane) – investigate, it turns out Alice is the heir to an estate, and her murderous in-laws are determined to be rid of her.\n\n• Audio commentary with academic Eloise Ross on The Thirteenth Hour (2024)\n\n• It’s Murder (1944, 9 mins): dramatised documentary produced for the war effort directed by Edward Bernds (who helmed 1959’s Return of the Fly and 1958’s Queen of Outer Space)\n\nFrom Oklahoma filmmaker Juan Pablo Reinoso comes the feature documentary Mad Props, which follows Tom Biolchini, an avid film prop collector in Tulsa, as he sets out to answer a fundamental question: ‘Are movie props art?’.\n\nHis journey takes him around the US and across the pond to the UK, to Lyon in France (Musée Cinema et Minature), and to Arezzo in Italy (Theatrum Mundi), where he meets other passionate collectors and museum curators and gets hands-on with their prized artefacts from a host of beloved movie franchises.\n\nAt the same time, Biolchini is also hoping to add several items to his rather enviable collection – including the Sports Almanac from Back to the Future: Part II (1985), the Holy Grail from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), the volleyball from Cast Away (2000), and (on impulse) the ghost trap from Ghostbusters II (1989).\n\nBeing a wealthy, successful lawyer turned banker, Biolchini is lucky to be able to indulge in his passion and afford the eye-watering prices that are the norm today – thanks to auction houses like Stephen Lane’s Propstore in London being at the forefront of creating an industry around these pop culture artefacts that previously would be either stored away or tossed in the bin.\n\nBeing a cinephile and memorabilia collector, but only for Vincent Price ephemera (and I have my limits, spending-wise), I got a big buzz over certain pieces, as does Biolchini – but not necessarily the same ones.\n\nThere’s one scene where he gets super excited about the pilot’s corpse from Cast Away, but I so coveted the final scene photograph from The Shining (1980) instead. Frankly, I couldn’t give a toss about Cast Away. But that’s the nature of being a film nerd; some films grab us and become embedded in our cultural history. And every prop tells a story, not only the film’s story but also our own.\n\nWhile the documentary puts charismatic fanboy Biolchini centre stage, we also get to meet other collectors and sellers with their own stories to tell – including Sean Lesponera, who stores his collection in his West Sussex garage, rapper Danny Boy O’Connor, who has turned the house (in Tulsa) used in The Outsiders (1983) into a museum filled with props and costumes, Scream fan Arturo Reyes, and a chap called Alistar ‘Blake’ Cartright, whose after a technical drawing from Blake’s 7, only because he was named after the British sci-fi series.\n\nI also loved the look of delight on the faces of sisters Izzy and Amelia selling Roy Batty’s jacket from Blade Runner (valued at £130,000), which had been lying in their loft for three decades.\n\nJoining Biolchini on part of his journey are genre icons – Robert Englund and Lance Henriksen, actor Mickey Rourke, and creature effects designer Alec Gillis – who share their stories of working with props and agree with Biolchini that these artefacts are indeed works of art.\n\nThere’s a lot packed into this 90-minute documentary, and I would gladly have liked to see more of the individual collections – even an entire series. Food for thought, Juan! But I know where I shall be heading next time I’m stateside or in Italy and France.\n\nMad Props is available to rent or purchase on Prime, Apple, Vudu, Fandango, GooglePlay, and more!\n\nTake a walk through the shadowy streets of American film noir in four atmospheric classics courtesy of Arrow.\n\nIn The Suspect (1944), a genial shopkeeper, Philip Marshall (Charles Laughton), is constantly nagged by his shrewish wife, Cora (Rosalind Ivan), while secretly yearning for a pretty young stenographer Mary Gray (Ella Raines). When Cora falls to her death, the police are suspicious, and Marshall’s neighbour (Henry Daniell) sees a chance for blackmail. This superb Edwardian-set thriller is a fascinating character study, especially Laughton’s performance in which he reigns in his usual scenery-chewing to give a subtle, compelling turn as the film’s unlikely ‘villain’. You can also see that director Robert Siodmak was beginning to hone his noir credentials here, which he’d perfect with 1946’s The Killers.\n\nThe Sleeping City (1950) sees an undercover policeman (Richard Conte) investigating a murder and narcotics racketeering at New York’s Bellevue Hospital with the help of a nurse (Coleen Gray) whom he finds falling in love with. Directed by George Sherman, this tense, semi-documentary thriller remains one of the few films of the era to be shot entirely on location, including many scenes in and around Bellevue.\n\nIn Thunder on the Hill (1951), convicted murderer Valerie Carns (Ann Blyth) is being transported for execution when a flood strands her and her guards at a convent hospital, where Sister Mary Bonaventure (Claudette Colbert) becomes convinced of Valerie’s innocence and sets out to find the real killer. Three years shy of becoming the King of Hollywood melodramas, Douglas Sirk made a number of noir thrillers, and this is one of the best. Although it’s a bit studio-bound and the killer’s identity pretty obvious from the outset, it does boast nice turns from Colbert as the sleuthing nun, the wonderful Gladys Cooper as the Mother Superior, and making his Hollywood debut, Australian actor Michael Pate, who’s servant character is key in solving the whodunnit.\n\nIn Six Bridges to Cross (1955), streetwise delinquent Jerry Florea (played by Sal Mineo) is shot and wounded by rookie policeman Eddie Gallagher (George Nader) while fleeing the scene of a robbery. Despite this, the two develop a friendship as Eddie and his wife (Julie Adams) take Jerry under their wing, trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. As an adult, Jerry (now played by Tony Curtis) marries and seems to settle down until an armoured security company across the street from him is robbed of $2.5m dollars. Directed by Joseph Pevney with cinematography by Oscar-winner William H Daniels, this crime noir, inspired by the 1950 Great Brink’s Robbery in Boston, Massachusetts, marks Sal Mineo’s screen debut and gives Tony Curtis a meaty character to play (although his accent reminded me of the cartoon character Top Cat at times).\n\nThis showcase of lesser-known noir classics features sterling performances from a host of screen greats, as well as taut direction, stunning cinematography, and superb screenwriting from the likes of Oscar Saul (A Streetcar Named Desire), Jo Eisinger (Gilda, Night and the City), Andrew Holt (In a Lonely Place) and Sydney Boehm (The Big Heat).\n\nLIMITED EDITION CONTENTS\n\n• High Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations of all four films\n\n• Original lossless mono audio on all films\n\n• Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing on all films\n\n• Audio commentaries by scholars and critics Farran Smith-Nehme (The Suspect), Imogen Sara Smith (The Sleeping City), Josh Nelson (Thunder on the Hill) and Samm Deighan (Six Bridges to Cross)\n\n• It Had to be Done, author and scholar Alan K.

Welcome to the world of Sam Katzman and his Cold War creature features.\n\nKatzman (July 7, 1901 – August 4, 1973) was one of Hollywood’s most prolific film producers and directors whose long career included serials, musicals, teen pictures, action movies and sex comedies, from the 1930s to the early 1970s. In the 1950s, Katzman navigated the zeitgeist of the Cold War era with a host of successful horror Columbia Pictures’ features aimed squarely at the teen market. This collection handpicks four that have left an indelible mark on contemporary culture and the bonus extras in this four-disc box-set include interviews and visual essays from an array of film historians that explain why. What Katzman, who only ever saw his pictures in terms of box-office receipts, would make of the in-depth analysis will make for great discussion when you break out this fabulous box-set.\n\nIn 1955’s Creature with the Atom Brain, a mob boss uses an ex-Nazi scientist’s atomic radiation reanimation machine to seek revenge on his enemies. An auto-accident survivor turns gnarly when he’s injected with an irradiated wolf serum in The Werewolf (1956). Treasure hunters battle the zombified crew members of a sunken ship while seeking a cache of diamonds in Zombies of Mora Tau (1957). And in The Giant Claw – one of the most infamous sci-fi’s of the decade – an extraterrestrial turkey creates worldwide havoc.\n\nThe Arrow Video box-set includes high definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of all four films (which were originally released together in a DVD box-set in 2008), with original uncompressed mono audio, optional English subtitles, an illustrated 60-page collector’s book and an 80-page collector’s art book. Plus, there are two double-sided posters by Matt Griffin, and reversible sleeves featuring original and new artwork by Matt Griffin. The bonus features on each disc are listed below.\n\nDISC 1 – CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN\n\nWritten by Curt Siodmak (who also penned Donovan’s Brain and The Wolfman), this taut thriller about mind-controlled reanimated corpses successfully fuses sci-fi and crime noir and paved the way for Katzman’s subsequent creature features. Richard Denning (of Creature from the Black Lagoon fame) plays the all-American square-jawed devoted husband/dad/scientist who ultimately saves the day. Director Edward L Cahn also helmed genre faves The She Creature (1956) and Voodoo Woman (1957).\n\n● Introduction by Kim Newman\n\n● Audio commentary by Russell Dyball\n\n● Sam Katzman: Before and Beyond the Cold War Creatures, feature-length presentation on the life, career and films of Sam Katzman by Stephen R Bissette\n\n● Condensed Super 8mm version of Creature with the Atom Brain\n\n● Theatrical Trailer & Image Gallery\n\nDISC 2 – THE WEREWOLF\n\nThis one has the distinction of being the first ‘werewolf’ film of the 1950s and went out on a double bill in the US in 1956 with Earth vs. Flying Saucers and Creature with the Atom Brain in the UK. Is it any good though? Well, it does make good use of the Big Bear Lake location in California’s San Bernardino National Forest, and the transformation scenes are also pretty OK. There’s also a couple of good turns from character actors Saul John Launer (best known as Perry Mason), Larry J Blake (who set up the first Motion Picture AA group in Hollywood) and Don Megowan (who played the on-land Gill-man in The Creature Walks Among Us (1956).\n\n● Introduction by critic Kim Newman\n\n● Audio commentary by Lee Gambin\n\n● Beyond Window Dressing, visual essay exploring the role of women in the films of Sam Katzman by Alexandra Heller-Nicholas\n\n● Condensed Super 8mm version of The Werewolf\n\n● Theatrical Trailer & Image Gallery\n\nDISC 3 – ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU\n\nCreature with the Atom Brain director Edward L Cahn returns with this contemporary-set zombie thriller whose story is said to be the inspiration for John Carpenter’s The Fog. Watch out for Allison Hayes, who is best known for her lead role in Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, and check out those zombies (any slower and they’d be walking backwards). Bizarrely, the film is supposed to be set in Africa – but it looks more like the same swampy Louisanna backlot used in Universal’s The Mummy’s Curse (1944). The underwater diving sequences are the film’s hilarious highlight.\n\n● Introduction by Kim Newman\n\n● Audio commentary by critic Kat Ellinger\n\n● Atomic Terror: Genre in Transformation, a visual essay exploring the intersection of mythical horror creatures and the rational world of science in the films of Sam Katzman by Josh Hurtado.\n\n● Theatrical Trailer & Image Gallery\n\nDISC 4 – THE GIANT CLAW\n\nLove it or hate it! This ludicrous sci-fi is one of a kind. Katzman had wanted Ray Harryhausen to devise the special effects (as he had co-produced Earth vs. Flying Saucers with Charles Schneer in 1956), but when that didn’t pan out he still went ahead. The result, a right ugly turkey puppet on very visible wires. The best part about his schlock-fest is that everyone plays it dead straight, which just makes it all the more hilarious to watch. Jeff Morrow, best known for This Island Earth (1955) and Kronos (1957), was so embarrassed at the film’s premiere, he went home and got drunk. I wonder if he did the same when he saw 1971’s Octaman (in which he had a cameo)? Playing the film’s brainy heroine is Mara Corday, who was married to House on Haunted Hill and Nanny and the Professor actor Richard Long. She was also a buddy of Clint Eastwood who gave her some notable cameos in The Gauntlet (1977) and Sudden Impact (1983).\n\n● Introduction by critic Kim Newman\n\n● Audio commentary by critics Emma Westwood and Cerise Howard\n\n● Family Endangered!, visual essay on Cold War paranoia in Katzman’s monster movies, by Mike White\n\n● Condensed Super 8mm version of The Giant Claw.\n\n● Theatrical Trailer & Image Gallery"
