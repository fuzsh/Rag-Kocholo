        "text": "“Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.” This famous line was delivered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on December 8, the day after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor. Just as any other era of Hollywood filmmaking, art imitates life – and no more so than the tumultuous years leading up to and including the duration of WWII.\n\nWith the world in warfare, Hollywood regained some lost footing in the years between 1943 and 1946. Filmmakers coordinated their efforts with Office of War Information (OWI), formed in 1942. This coordination produced patriotic, morale-boosting films, newsreels, and of course, the promotion of war bonds.\n\nThe “American Way of Life”, a central theme of Hollywood filmmakers in this era, drew a bold line between good and evil – with Germany and Japan portrayed as the proponents of evil. Several films of this era promoted this morality and became popular with moviegoers.\n\nToward the latter half of the decade, Hollywood was embroiled in an anticommunist hysteria. Originally established in 1938, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) purpose was to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities and organizations with suspected fascist or communist ties.\n\n​ The timing of HUAC’s rejuvenated focus coincided with the close of WWII and our growing fear and distrust of the Soviet Union. This had a profound effect on filmmaking with many directors and actors getting caught up in these “witch-hunts” and finding themselves either blackballed – or fear of being labeled a Communist. The seeds of fear were sown. Anticommunism, Cold War espionage, and fear of nuclear annihilation would become filmmaking fodder in the years to follow.\n\n​ Noteworthy action-orientated actors in this genre: Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne, Conrad Veidt, Clark Gable, Randolph Scott, Van Johnson"
