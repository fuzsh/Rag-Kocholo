        "meta_description": "Mysterious Intruder (1946), the fifth\r\nentry in Columbia Pictures’ highly successful Whistler franchise,\r\nwould be the last film of that series directed by William Castle, who had\r\nkicked off the first of eight Whistler B-films with The\r\nWhistler (1944).  During his sojourn at the studio, Castle would\r\nalternate between Whistler movies and Crime Doctor vehicles,\r\noften directing some of the most entertaining and innovative entries in each\r\nseries…before leaving in 1947 to venture out as an independent\r\ndirector-producer.  Though he did return to Columbia for a brief period\r\nfrom 1953 to 1956, Castle is best known to film fans for his gimmicky horror\r\nfilms that still entertain audiences today, from House on Haunted Hill (1958)\r\nto The Tingler (1959) to Homicidal (1961). \r\nHe was also the producer of the 1968 horror film classic Rosemary’s\r\nBaby.Intruder finds series star\r\nRichard Dix playing a private-eye named Don Gale this time around.  An\r\nelderly music shop owner named Edward Stillwell (Paul E. Burns) stops by Gale’s\r\noffice after hours to enlist the detective’s help in locating a missing girl\r\nnamed Elora Lund.  Many years ago, when Elora was only fourteen, her\r\nmother left some knick-knacks and other odds ‘n’ ends with Stillwell to\r\nsell…but the old man was too kind-hearted to part with the possessions. \r\nAmong Mrs. Lund’s effects is a treasure so priceless that Gale agrees to\r\ntake the case even though Stillwell can only pay him a $100. Gale is\r\nassured that, once located, Elora will be able to reward him far more\r\nhandsomely.Three\r\nnights later, a young woman (Helen Mowery) pays Stillwell a visit and claims to\r\nbe Elora.  Ecstatic that she’s returned, Stillwell calls Gale to let him\r\nknow…but, when he returns to where he left the woman, he finds himself up\r\nagainst a goon named Harry Pontos (Mike Mazurki), who croaks the old man and\r\nkidnaps Miss Lund.  But “Lund” is really a woman named Freda Hanson,\r\nplanted by Gale to find out just what Stillwell has that’s so valuable. \r\nDon soon learns that the real Elora (Pamela Blake) stands to inherit a pair of\r\nrare recordings from “The Swedish Nightingale” herself, Jenny Lind…worth\r\n$200,000.Many fans\r\nof the Whistler movies consider Mysterious Intruder to\r\nbe one of the best in the series.  While I’d still argue that it’s a\r\ntoss-up between the first Whistler and The Mark of the\r\nWhistler (1944), Intruder does have an intriguing\r\nplot and, of course, that surprising twist ending that we’ve now come to expect\r\nfrom the franchise.  Dix has one of his best roles as a seedy shamus who’d\r\nprobably sell his grandmother for change, and he’s working with a\r\nbetter-than-average cast of great character actors.  The film is, in many\r\nways, a bargain basement version of noirs like The Maltese Falcon\r\n— with Dix the somewhat unethical private eye, Nina Vale his loyal\r\nsecretary, Mowery the mystery woman who’s not what she appears to be, and Regis\r\nToomey as the manager of the apartment building in which Mowery lives…and who\r\ncan’t be eliminated from the list of suspects, either.Barton\r\nMacLane, who appeared in Falcon as the hard-nosed Lt. Dundy,\r\nis on hand here as one of the detectives investigating the case.  He\r\nplayed both cops and bad guys in many of the Warner Bros. films of the 1930s\r\nand 1940s and is probably recognizable for his roles on TV series like Outlaws and I\r\nDream of Jeannie.  He’s partnered with another TV vet, Charles\r\nLane (The Lucy Show, Petticoat Junction), who\r\nplays against type here (Lane usually played weaselly bureaucrats and other\r\nofficious roles).  Mike Mazurki, who was just starting to attract notice\r\nin films like Murder, My Sweet (1944), plays the doomed Pontos\r\nand gives Intruder solid noir credibility.  Other\r\nfamiliar faces in the film include Stanley Blystone, Edith Evanson, Kathleen\r\nHoward, Arthur Space…and as always, Otto Forrest as the omnipresent narrator.Mysterious Intruder will air this September 22nd at 10:45am on Turner Classic\r\nMovies as part of the channel’s month-long scheduling of these classic\r\nprogrammers based on the popular radio program.  Next week at Radio\r\nSpirits: The Secret of the Whistler!",
