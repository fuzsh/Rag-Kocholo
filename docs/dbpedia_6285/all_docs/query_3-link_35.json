        "text": "Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part\n\nShawn and Gus return to Vancouver to visit their old nemesis Despereaux in prison at the felon's request, who then uses them to escape and pull one last job before he is extradited to the United States. Only while he is out, he is framed for the murder of a Crown Attorney and now asks the guys for help clearing his name of this most recent - and frankly unseemly - charge. Guest starring Cary Elwes.\n\nExtradition: British Columbia\n\nShawn and Gus are on the slopes on their ski vacation in Whistler, British Columbia when Shawn spots wanted international art thief Pierre Despereaux (Cary Elwes). Despereaux is so good, heâs never left enough evidence behind to be formally accused and so promptly gives Shawn and Gus the slip. Lassiter and Juliet arrive in Canada just in time to meet Shawn and Gus at Despereauxâs latest crime scene. Lassiter sees all the telltale signs of Despereaux-no fingerprints, no alarms tripped and a signature Merchanteuse Blonde cigarette burning in an ashtray-but not Despereaux himself. After several failed attempts, Shawn realizes that to catch Despereaux he has to beat him at his own game!\n\nDependent\n\nMob lawyer (guest star Cary Elwes) and his family are brutally attacked leaving a young boy as the sole witness -- Mob lawyer Sidney Truex and his wife are brutally attacked, leaving his young son emotionally scarred. When the Detectives have to locate the Truexs' daughter, Charlotte (guest star Emily VanCamp), to notify her about the attack on her parents, Detectives Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler find Charlotte at her boyfriend Ryan's apartment. Through an exhaustive interview process, the Detectives must sort through the web of lies Charlotte has told in order to piece together a night of drinking and drugs leaving Charlotte unable to recall details of the evening. However, her father comes out of surgery and is able to vividly remember his daughter at the crime scene. The disturbing case takes another turn as Stabler is brought up on charges of excessive force after getting into a very serious altercation with Ryan."
