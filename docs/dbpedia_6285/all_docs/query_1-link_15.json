        "text": "These WHISTLER movies are fascinating - based on the popular radio show from the 1940s - almost all of them starring Richard Dix as a different character each time (and many of them directed by a young William Castle). The movies are short (around 60 mins each) and have a Twilight Zone Or Alfred Hitchcock Presents kind of vibe. This one could be fun to remake. In this case, Dix plays a man who gets hit by a car (just a glancing blow to the head) and loses his memory. A kindly stranger woman sees him in a bar and reads his fortune with a deck of playing cards. Two times in a row the cards indicate he will die…\n\nA man loses his memory, and with the aid of kind Samaritan sisters, they try to reconstruct his identity using the various scraps of paper and other items in his pockets. I love mysteries that also play as if they are point and click adventure games, where each item has some significance and you're going to need to keep it in your inventory to solve the crime. The girls, played by Janis Carter and Jeff Donnell, are fabulous (yes - Jeff is a girl's name, and she's adorable). While they are piecing together his identity he's also leaving a trail of dead animals in his wake. At one point, he chats with a little girl, buys her ice cream, and…\n\nThe third film in the series saw Lew Landers filing in for William Castle and he at least manages to turn in a fast-paced film but the screenplay is certainly a letdown. Richard Dix returns in a role playing an amnesiac man and Janis Carter the woman trying to help him regain his memory.\n\nTHE POWER OF THE WHISTLER is certainly a step down from the first two films in the series but there's enough entertainment here to make it worth watching. Believe it or not, the biggest problem with the film is that there's too much story and there's just too much happening. Before long it just feels like a lot of padding and you just stop caring about…\n\nIn a club, Jean (Janis Carter) is fooling around with a deck of cards, playing amateur fortune teller. She decides to foretell the future of a man (Richard Dix) who is sitting at the bar. Two times in a row, she draws what is interpreted as his death within 24 hours, which really rattles her. She tells him, despite how it might make her sound. Turns out this man injured himself avoiding being hit by a car and has lost his memory. She decides to help him find out about his past, but will wish she never had...\n\nAnother very solid entry in The Whistler series, also featuring super cute Jeff Donnell as Jean's sister Francie, Loren Tindall as Francie's…"
