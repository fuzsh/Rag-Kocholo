        "text": "The Fortune Sound Club in downtown Vancouver was buzzing last night, and you could feel it from a mile away. The snow stoked guests lined up ready to feast their eyes on some of the sexiest snow porn of the season. Meanwhile, the Wildcats crew hustled and bustled inside to make it just right before cracking the doors.\n\nIconic Wildcats logo merchandise lined the walls while tech gurus climbed on ladders and set up projectors, and us, the Gibbons crew? Well, we got ready to spread the stoke in the Gibbons Whistler way, since there is nothing more Whistler than Après!\n\nWe’ve Been Brewing Up a Secret\n\nFull disclosure, the cat’s out of the bag (Wildcats pun intended). We’ve been cooking up a secret beer recipe for a while, and it’s finally dialled, so we figured why not share it with some of our favourite Whistler folk to celebrate our common love of snow?!\n\nWe shouted each ticket holder a pint of Gibbons Après Lager and asked them to vote on which beer can design they liked best. The winning design will eventually go public when we launch this puppy officially. You’ll just have to wait and see for yourself at the next activation!\n\nWildcats the Movie Premiere Night\n\nThe Manboys opened the night with some heavy hitting backcountry footage. These young guns also just completed a two-year project and are now touring with the film. The Manboys Movie didn’t disappoint, be sure to check it out if it’s making a stop near you!\n\nThe crowds cheered as the Wildcats took to the stage with more energy than you ever thought possible. Who exactly makes up the Wildcats crew you might ask? The originals include Devun Walsh, JF Pelchat, Kale Stephens, Chris Brown and Chris Dufficy. They are backed up by big names Romain De Marchi, DCP, Mark Tremblay, Craig Gouweloos, Charles Reid, Frank April, Eero Niemela, Benji Ritchie, Iikka Backstrom and Mikey Rencz who also make appearances in the film along with some more shred friends. The film showcased not only the evolution of the Wildcats, but of snowboarding as a whole. The movie connected each and every person in the crowd to what they love about snowboarding and the culture that goes with it.\n\nThe Wildcats crushed it. Great storyline, epic terrain, funny commentary. I think everyone left inspired to be a little more loose and spend a bit more time shredding – high fives to the Wildcats.\n\nMovie Highlights\n\nThe vintage footage of the Wildcats partying and jumping a car in New Zealand. The flashbacks were a comical trip down memory lane.\n\nCharles Reid’s section of street jibs to backcountry couloirs was diverse and straight up impressive. This dude is good at everything.\n\nThe voice overs by Devun Walsh were on point; you can’t help but love that voice of his.\n\nWell, we could tell you what happened next but, let’s be honest, it was a little foggy after the film because that new Gibbons Après Lager was flowing and the tunes by Mat the Alien, DJ Illo and Vinyl Ritchie were bumpin’.\n\nMore Premiere Dates\n\nOctober 12, 2016 – London\n\nOctober 14, 2016 – Berlin\n\nOctober 15, 2016 – Grenoble\n\nOctober 15, 2016 – Denver\n\nOctober 17, 2016 – Vienna\n\nOctober 18, 2016 – Innsbruck\n\nOctober 19, 2016 – Zurich\n\nOctober 19, 2016 – Montreal\n\nOctober 21, 2016 – Toronto\n\nOctober 22, 2016 – Calgary\n\nNovember TBA – California\n\nNovember TBA – Whistler\n\nLive Online\n\nWhen: October 27, 2016\n\nWhere: http://snowboarding.transworld.net/\n\nHow: Keep an eye out for launch details on the Transworld Snowboarding website.\n\nFeed the Winter Stoke\n\nThe premiere was a great turn out, and awesome vibes accompanied this impressive film. If you haven’t got the hint, we would highly recommend that you check it out and feed your winter stoke. Let Wildcats the Movie bring back memories of your first experience snowboarding and lead you into the future with the same solid crew.
