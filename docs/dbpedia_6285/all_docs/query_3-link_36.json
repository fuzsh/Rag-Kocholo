        "text": "The festival opens with MAESTRO starring Carey Mulligan and Bradley Cooper, directed by Cooper and closes with ADAPTATION, a documentary about adaptive mountain biking directed by Jake Thomas.\n\nWhistler, BC (November 1, 2023) Whistler Film Festival (WFF) has announced the full lineup for its 23rd edition taking place in-person from November 29 to December 3, 2023 in Whistler, BC, with online screenings available from December 4 to 17, 2023.\n\nSelected from over 1,900 submissions, the lineup includes 97 exciting and moving films curated into 12 program strands. There are 35 features and 62 shorts from 14 countries, including award-season contenders, new breakthrough Canadian features, adrenaline pumping mountain adventure films, and previously unseen projects from around the globe.\n\nWFF is known for its commitment to Canadian artists and is once again thrilled to showcase our rich diversity of perspectives and talent with 58% of film programming dedicated to premiering Canadian films (66% of features, 75% shorts).\n\nThe festival is also excited to support new and evolving talent with five films by first-time feature directors, including AMERICAN FICTION, the feature debut as writer/director of acclaimed writer Cord Jefferson, and WEAK LAYERS the first feature from Mountain Culture favourite Katie Burrell, as well as 26 short films by first time directors. WFF is known for championing gender equity and this year’s lineup proudly includes 19 feature films and 25 short films by women and women-identifying directors (54% for Features and 40% for Shorts).\n\nFilms in competition will vie for more than $189,500 in cash and prizes awarded in 16 film and 2 pitch categories which are selected by juries composed of leading cinematic talent.\n\nWFF’s opening night will kick things off with the Canadian Premiere of Netflix’s MAESTRO, written, produced, directed by and starring Bradley Cooper, and starring Carey Mulligan. A towering and fearless love story, Maestro chronicles the lifelong relationship between Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein. This will be Cooper's second directorial role, in which he also takes the lead as Leonard Bernstein.\n\nIn ROJEK, Canada’s official selection for best international feature film for next year's Oscars®, director Zaynê Akyol encounters members of the Islamic State and their wives, from all over the world, detained in prison camps in Syria. The film is an attempt to understand their fundamentalist beliefs while recounting the rise and fall of the Islamic State (ISIS) through their personal stories.\n\nOther award-contenders include the Western Canadian Premiere of ORIGIN, Ava DuVernay’s biopic of Pulitzer Prize winner Isabel Wilkerson. The film follows Isabel’s harrowing journey to write her bestseller Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent as she grapples with tremendous personal tragedy. Inserting excerpts of the book through narration, ORIGIN explores the unspoken system that has shaped America and chronicles how lives today are defined by a hierarchy of human divisions.\n\nAs a special treat for the local community, who lost their commercial cinema at the end of 2022, WFF23 is bringing BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER to Whistler. Locals will be able to see the two most anticipated and successful films of the year on the big screen. Bring out your pink outfits, Whistler!\n\nSOLO, directed by Sophie Dupuis, will also have its Whistler premiere during the festival. The film follows a talented drag artist as they deal with the disappointment of two impossible loves, a passionate but destructive crush and a cold, distant relationship with their mother. SOLO was voted Best Canadian feature at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) earlier this year.\n\n“With a good half-dozen major titles competing for awards-season glory, five World Premieres, four Canadian Premieres and two sneak previews being unveiled for the first time, 2023 represents our best programming lineup ever,” says Paul Gratton, WFF’s Director of Programming. “Throw in the Best Canadian feature from TIFF (SOLO), the Peoples’ Choice winner from TIFF (AMERICAN FICTION), this year’s Canadian entry in the International Oscar sweepstakes (ROJEK) and a newly restored version of Brigitte Berman’s 1985 Oscar winner ARTIE SHAW: TIME IS ALL YOU’VE GOT, not to mention a dozen new Canadian films vying for our coveted Borsos awards, and you can see why we feel that this year’s edition is all about year-end accolades and recognition for extraordinary work.”\n\nThese titles join the previously announced Canadian Premiere of MAY DECEMBER directed by Todd Haynes (who’s film CAROL won the WFF AUDIENCE AWARD FOR BEST FEATURE FILM in 2015), starring Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore; the Western Canadian Premiere of AMERICAN FICTION, directed by Cord Jefferson starring Jeffrey Wright; and World Premiere of THE BURNING SEASON directed by Sean Garrity, starring Jonas Chernick and Sara Canning.\n\nProgramming strands this year are the Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature, World Documentary, Sneak Peak, From the Vault, Mountain Culture, Special Presentations and ShortWork.\n\nWorld Premieres\n\nCanadian filmmaker, photographer, author and public speaker Dianne Whelan makes a ground-breaking appearance at WFF with the World Premiere of her Paramount+ Original documentary 500 DAYS IN THE WILD. After a six-year journey, Whelan became the first person to travel 24,000 km over land and water on the Trans Canada Trail—the longest trail in the world. 500 DAYS IN THE WILD weaves adventure, personal reflections, stunning wildlife and landscapes to document a unique ecological pilgrimage and journey towards reconciliation.\n\nActor Jonas Chernick and director Sean Garrity return to the Whistler Film Festival with their World Premiere of THE BURNING SEASON, a sort of spiritual successor to WFF22 selected THE END OF SEX and MY AWKWARD SEXUAL ADVENTURE, which won the Audience Award at WFF12. The film follows a dangerous and passionate secret affair that takes place over multiple summers. It is a sexy and tragic love story - told backwards\n\nHis throat was slit. He was set on fire. Left for dead. Based on the true crime that shocked Canada, ALTONA, the debut feature from the award-winning Affolter Brothers, will leave audiences asking, “can you forgive what you'll never forget?”\n\nA divorce that ends in murder and a mother who is hellbent on covering for the real killer: SHE TALKS TO STRANGERS directed by Bruce Sweeney ticks all of the boxes of dark comedy, finding humour in the pain of conjugal separation.\n\nZOE.MP4 Directed by Jeremy Lutter rounds out the WFF World Premieres. 22 year old Zoe’s best-laid plans are suddenly upended when she is abducted by a suburban single mom named Alina, who also happens to be an altruistic serial killer.\n\nIn Competition\n\nNurturing cinematic excellence remains at the heart of the Whistler Film Festival with 15 film awards in seven juried competitions plus one audience favorite:\n\nBest Canadian Feature Film - ($15,000 cash prize) sponsored by Directors Guild of Canada, British Columbia as well as ($20,000 worth of post production prize) sponsored by Company 3.\n\nBest Director of a Borsos Competition film sponsored by Directors Guild of Canada BC\n\nBritish Columbia Best Screenplay for a Borsos Competition film\n\nBest Performance in a Borsos Competition film\n\nBest Cinematography in a Borsos Competition film presented by ICG 669\n\nBest Editing in a Borsos Competition Film presented by IATSE 891 ($1,000 cash prize)\n\nAdditional film awards at the festival include:\n\nWorld Documentary Award\n\nMountain Culture Award - presented by Whistler Blackcomb\n\nInternational ShortWork Award\n\nCanadian ShortWork Award\n\nStudent ShortWork Award ($500 cash award) - presented by Capilano University Film Centre\n\nAWFJ EDA Awards (2) for Best Female-directed Narrative Feature and Short Film\n\nBest BC Director Award - presented by the Directors Guild of Canada – British Columbia\n\nAudience Award for Best Feature of the Festival (narrative or documentary, non-cash prize)\n\nTwo pitch competitions round out of the awards and prizes:\n\nMPPIA Short Film Award Competition ($15,000 cash award plus up to $100,000 in production services) presented by MPPIA, Creative BC and Whistler Film Festival\n\nPower Pitch Competition ($36,000 prize package including a $25,000 production credit from Company 3, a $10,000 lighting and grip production credit and $1,000 cash prize from William F.

All narrative and documentary feature-length films in the Whistler Film Festival are eligible to receive the Audience Awards as voted by festival attendees.\n\nBORSOS COMPETITION FOR BEST CANADIAN FEATURE\n\nThe coveted Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature is named for legendary Canadian filmmaker Phillip Borsos. Now celebrating its 21st year, the award is known for celebrating films that exemplify the creative fire and artistry embodied by Borsos, best known for his inspiring work on the Genie Award-winning films THE GREY FOX (82), and BETHUNE: THE MAKING OF A HERO (90).\n\nPast Borsos Award winners include:\n\nTHE HUSBAND, directed by Bruce McDonald, 2013\n\nBEFORE THE STREETS (Avant les rues), Directed by Chloé Leriche, 2016\n\nANTIGONE, directed by Sophie Deraspe, 2019\n\nCOYOTE, directed by Katherine Jerkovic, 2022\n\nThis year, the Borsos Competition has 12 films vying for the coveted prizes, eight of which were directed by women, and several by first-time feature directors. Along with the previously announced films THE BURNING SEASON, SHE TALKS TO STRANGERS and ZOE.MP4, nine other titles will be in the running. These are:\n\nTake a trip to 2045 where global environmental devastation has left humans scattered in a world where oxygen is scarce and trust is uncommon. FINALITY OF DUSK is co-written and directed by Madison Thomas. Katarina Ziervogel, who is Deaf, co-wrote the intersectional script which features Indigenous and Deaf performers. Both are WFF Indigenous Filmmaker Fellowship Program alumni.\n\nRebecca Snow's first narrative film, starring Christopher Heyerdahl and Richard Armitage, THE BOY IN THE WOODS, is a remarkable, true-life Holocaust survival story set during the Polish deportation of 1943.\n\nQuebec French-language films, MY MOTHER’S MEN and THE NATURE OF LOVE will both be making their British Columbia premieres at WFF. Directed by Anik Jean, MY MOTHER’S MEN tells the story of an eccentric woman who wants her ashes shared amongst her five ex-husbands. In Monia Chokri’s THE NATURE OF LOVE a philosophy professor in a comfortable, but stale relationship has her world turned upside down when she falls for a craftsman renovating her country home. Opposites attract, but will it last?\n\nSet on the beautiful Nova Scotia coast, HAILEY ROSE, directed by Sandi Somers, is a contemporary family comedy about love in all its expressions. After years of successfully avoiding her family, newly-unemployed Hailey gets a frantic call from her sister with news compelling her to return to their east coast hometown - only to discover a stunning surprise waiting for her. This film was developed through the WFF19 Producers Lab, Scott Lepp producer.\n\nATIKAMEKW SUNS, directed by Chloé Leriche and based on a true story, centers on the discovery of five young people from the Atikamekw First Nation community of Matawan who were found dead in a truck in a river in 1977 and the indifference of the authorities investigating the tragedy.\n\nThe English Canadian Premiere of the Quebec film, TELL ME WHY THESE THINGS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, directed by Lyne Charlebois, which is based on the true story of lifelong love between a Catholic priest and his young protégée, who together set out to study the biology of sexuality in nature.\n\nTHIS TIME, directed by Robert Vaughn, is a film about the power of connection. When a teen inherits her deceased father's journal, she discovers cryptic clues uncovering his secret life. Now, to fulfill his dying wish, she must blackmail an alcoholic hearse driver to race her cross-country to attempt a long-shot rendezvous with her father's friend Liza Minnelli.\n\nAlso exploring notions of love is director Kim Albright’s WITH LOVE AND A MAJOR ORGAN, written by Julia Lederer (WFF Screenwriters Lab 2019) In an alternate world where hearts are made of objects and suppressing emotions is self-care, a lonely woman rips out her own heart for the man she loves, only to discover that he has run away with it. The film was developed with the support of Women in the Directors Chair (WFF19).\n\nDOC BLOC SHINES, MOUNTAIN CULTURE GOES BEYOND HUMAN LIMITS IN 2023\n\nWFF received a record number of excellent documentary submissions and is pleased to present an exciting line-up of documentaries with a strong focus on mountain sports, nature and music.\n\nFor music fans, IMMEDIATE FAMILY, directed by Denny Tedesco follows the work and lives of legendary 1970s session musicians who were featured on some of the most iconic recordings of the era, and features interviews with Linda Rondstat, Keith Richards, David Crosby, Carol King, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young and Phil Collins.\n\nTHE GRACELESS AGE: THE BALLAD OF JOHN MURRY, directed by Sarah Share, is the story of American singer-songwriter John Murry who was on the cusp of greatness after the release of his highly acclaimed album The Graceless Age (2013) when his world fell apart. Addicted to heroin, creatively exhausted, he washed up on the shores of Ireland a broken man. Now, he is ready to retrace his steps back to Mississippi into the dark heart of American life and face his demons.\n\nIn Robert Morin’s WILD FEAST a wounded moose dies deep in the forest and becomes a communal feast. As the seasons go by, mammals, birds and insects invite themselves to the banquet – multiplying ensuing games, rituals and conflicts. In exploring and occasionally foiling nature’s wildlife codes, the story becomes a simple yet poignant reflection on death, on its natural place in this world and, by extension, on its deeper meaning and purpose.\n\nThis year, WFF’s Mountain Culture selection is represented on an international and local scale. Our Closing Night film, ADAPTATION, is a feature-length documentary by Jake Thomas that follows a group of para-athletes as they converge in British Columbia for the Summer Race Series, the world’s first downhill mountain bike race to include an adaptive mountain bike (aMTB) category. ADAPTATION is a collection of stories about humanity and our ability to overcome adversity. Whether for the thrill of competition, or a need to push through the pain of daily life to simply get lost in a moment, the film seeks to inspire, educate, and celebrate the gift of life through all its complexities.\n\nHailing from the Austrian and Bavarian alps is A WHOLE LIFE, based on the best-selling novel by Robert Seethaler, directed by Hans Steinbichler and adapted for screen by Oscar-nominated screenwriter, Ulrich Limmer. The film tells a story of Andreas Egger, spanning eight decades of the last century that was filled with poverty, war, violence. Propelled by the commercialization of the mountains , the film upholds the power of unwavering determination and illuminates from page to screen the bliss of a simple life in the mountains.\n\nKatie Burrell returns to WFF with the British Columbia premiere of her feature debut, WEAK LAYERS, a female-driven ski comedy about an aspiring adventure filmmaker endeavoring to enter a 72-hour ski film competition against the best pros and filmmakers in the business. Burrell delivers her unique brand of comedy with an affectionate story of finding one’s voice and being true to one’s self in a mountain ski town.\n\nFROM THE VAULT\n\nJazz-lovers take note! The new 4K restoration of the 1985 Canadian Oscar winner for Best Documentary, ARTIE SHAW: TIME IS ALL YOU'VE GOT will be screening at WFF this year. Directed by Brigitte Berman, the film is a classic biography, cataloging the life and music of the band leader and clarinetist, Artie Shaw.\n\nFILMS FROM AWAY\n\nSwitzerland is WFF’s country of focus this year, on screen and at the Content Summit, with the adventure documentary DIVING IN A DROP making its North American Premiere. Filmmaker and mountain guide, Sebastian Devrient, teams up with one of the world's leading cave diving experts, Frédéric Swierczynski, as they head for the Atacama Desert in Argentina on a unique scuba-diving expedition, alone and without back-up, to explore the highest volcanic crater lake in the world on Ojos del Salado in the Andes.\n\n“The Consulate General of Switzerland in Vancouver is proud to take part in the Whistler Film Festival. Switzerland has a rich and vibrant film industry, and we are excited to share our culture and stories with the Whistler audience. We are so grateful for the opportunity to celebrate Swiss cinema with our partners at WFF,” says Thomas Schneider, Consul General of Switzerland\n\nShortWorks\n\nWFF is thrilled to showcase seven ShortWorks programs in our 2023 edition. These seven programs feature 62 films from Canada and around the world, films that remind us of our humanity, that break convention, that with diversity, creativity and passion reimagine storytelling. The program includes 2020’s WFF Power Pitch winner “White Noise,” written and directed by Tamara Scherbak, as well as the Western Canadian premiere of TIFF award winning “Motherland” a beautifully composed drama by Jasmin Mozaffari and Catherine Boivin’s dreamlike visual poem “6 minutes per kilometer”.\n\nShortWorks also features work from many of our amazing Whistler alumni including Lindsay McIntyre, Robert Tornroos, Jon Chiang, and AW Hopkins as well as exciting debut films from Canadian directors Ghazal Partou, Ava Maria Safai, and Praneet Akilla.\n\nThe ShortWorks program spotlights phenomenal British Columbia talent with 34 shorts at the fest including the Western Canadian premiere of TIFF favorite, Kasey Lum’s “Bloom”, and Bruna Arbex’s “Introduction” as well as World Premiere of Nessa Aref’s “My Roommate Ahriman” and Canadian premiere of Christóforos John Roussakis’ “Nagano Till Now”.\n\n“With an unprecedented amount of shorts submitted to ShortWorks this year, we are in awe of this daring, innovative line up that we know our audiences will love,” says Hayley Gray, WFF Senior Shorts Programmer, “These films made us laugh, cry, kept us on the edge of our seats and reminded us of our need to connect and understand one another.”\n\nAll films are available in-theatre in Whistler, with select screening available online.\n\nAfter attending the festival in Whistler, audiences are encouraged to view films from the comfort of home with 50% of net proceeds from online ticket revenues directly shared with the filmmakers or Canadian rights holders.
