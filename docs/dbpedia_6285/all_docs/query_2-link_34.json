        "text": "Several actors and stagehands reported seeing a woman in a white dress hovering around the bottom of an old, wooden spiral staircase or at the top of them stage right. A stagehand from Gettysburg, PA, saw her and asked what her name was. She said “Marie.” Researchers discovered that an actress named Marie Cahill had performed many times at the Fulton. She was born when the Fulton Hall became the Fulton Opera House, and died when the theater started showing movies. Perhaps Marie is still waiting for her big break.\n\nA carpenter working in a stairwell that had been closed off for many years suddenly ran screaming from the theatre and onto Prince Street. When asked what was wrong, he said that a man in a light colored suit, wearing brown shoes and a straw hat walked up to him and asked for a cigarette – then he just disappeared right before his eyes. He refused to return to the theatre to finish working on the renovation. Other theatre employees have since reported sightings of the specter, and some actors claim that strange whistling and clapping coming from backstage caused them to miss a line.\n\nPrior to the 1905 renovation, the gallery was closed to the public because of building codes. Movie projector and follow-spot operators were only permitted in the area. A Millersville University professor was running the spotlights for a show when she noticed an older gentleman sitting in the benches. At intermission she asked if the gentleman was given permission to sit up there. The gentleman only pointed out the young actress in the first act and cited her as his granddaughter that he had come to see. After the show ended, the older gentleman was gone. The spot operator went backstage and ran into the actress. The operator said she had seen her grandfather and hoped he enjoyed the show. The girl responded, “Both my grandfathers are dead.” The actress also said her grandfathers had never seen her perform. The spot operator replied, “Maybe one has now.” And left it at that."
