        "text": "The Whistler’s food editor is bringing her award-winning podcast Cooking The Books with Gilly Smith to Rockwater on Hove beach. We sent our podcast correspondent Ceri Barnes Thompson to find out more\n\n“What podcasts are you listening to?” Have you noticed we seem to be saying this more and more. It’s the new box set conversation. I love the excellent journalism and shared stories I hear on my dog walks and right now the top of my ‘Spotify’s most listened to’ list is “Cooking the Books with Gilly Smith”. It’s been my companion every Thursday morning for the past two years and not only has it changed the way I shop, cook, eat and understand the world of food production, it’s ignited my connection to the taste memories that have been part of my life. No other podcast has had such a profound effect on me as this.\n\nThis summer “Cooking The Books” comes to Rockwater in Hove as Gilly will be hosting Yasmin Fahr, Rachel Roddy and Melissa Hemsley, three of the most exciting food writers around throughout July who’ll all talk about life, food and their latest books.\n\nGilly is a Sussex based writer and journalist, but her reputation in the food world is international. Immersed in a lifetime of food journalism she started podcasting at Delicious magazine before striking out on her own.\n\n“Podcasting is the ultimate in democratising women, people of colour, gender, sexuality and age. We take our subjects and we prise them open to find so much more than the traditional media would ever commission. It’s powered by passion rather than sales meetings. We do what we love and it’s catching!” So powerful is her belief in the format that she has also written a book “How To Start And Grow A Successful Podcast” and has made online courses on the subject too.\n\n“Cooking the Books” won The Guild of Food Writers Award for best pod last year and this year only missed out to the BBC production team at the Food Programme at The Fortum and Mason Awards. Not bad for someone who’s the consummate solo producer – every episode of “Cooking The Books” she researches, books, records and edits herself. There are no adverts, no sponsors.\n\nMelissa Hemsley describes Gilly as “hugely respected by the old guard of the food world, but also massively loved by the up-and-coming due to her boundless energy for encouragement, mentoring and change-bringing”. Hemsley says that “Cooking the Books” is the podcast she’d choose first out of any list to appear on. She calls it “genius” because it honours the author by taking the listener on a deep dive into the stories, recipes and writing often reading segments back the authors they’d almost forgotten, the refreshing excitement of hearing your own words being read out loud for listeners to enjoy.\n\nAlong with Hemsley on the roster will be the Guardian food journalist and author Rachel Roddy and New York Times food writer Yasmin Fahr, who recently relocated from New York to Menorca, attracted by the slower pace of life.\n\nYasmin thinks it’s Gilly’s authenticity and insight that make the podcast is so enjoyable. “These conversations can give people a ‘head start’, bringing people into their confidence around food and cooking. Gilly uses stories of personal experience because she knows that the most effective way to get people to change is through stories.”\n\nAnd that’s very much Gilly’s mission – to change the world. She’s concerned about climate change, the food industry’s broken industrial systems, child food poverty and our lack of connection to the soil and to each other. A good cook book will always be the antidote to ultra processed food. A good recipe will always have you handling the ingredients rather than popping a silver processed tray in the oven. And that’s what she wants us to do as a result of listening to the podcast. Shop locally, think about how the animals have been treated, share a meal and a story with family and friends as often as possible.\n\nAway from “Cooking The Books” Gilly works with the Food Foundation to help bring awareness of food poverty especially of our children living in scarcity. Melissa Hemsley is one of the voices that Gilly’s encouraged to come on board and Melissa credits Gilly with encouraging her to flex her energy in the more important parts of the food world like being part of this kind of campaigning work.\n\nI asked Yasmin what she is hoping for from the live shows. “Food people tend to be good-hearted people and I’m really looking forward to hearing what questions come up. If there’s a chance of one thing landing that gives someone the ability to try something new, it’s all worthwhile”.\n\n“I hope there’ll be a real hobby club atmosphere” says Gilly, “people coming with all kinds of different takes on a subject, it always surprises and delights me”.\n\nl Rockwater, Western Esplanade, BN3 4FA 01273 091166\n\nTuesday July 2 6.30-8pm Yasmin Fahr\n\nTuesday July 16 6.30-8pm: Rachel Roddy\n\nTuesday July 23 6.30-8pm: Melissa Hemsley\n\nTickets £15 from CookBookBake, Hove’s indie specialist cookbook shop and include £5 off the author’s book.\n\nTickets from https://www.gillysmith.com/event-list\n\nBy Ruby Ephstein\n\nRECEIVED WISDOM, seldom the most reliable or durable of guides, has it that Paths of Glory kicked off Stanley Kubrick’s freakish streak of groundbreaking movies. Fortunately, we here at Cinerama know better.\n\nThat honour, we insist, belongs to The Killing, arguably the greatest of all heist movies and certainly the most intricate and imaginative. Spoilers R Not Us, as you know, so let’s just say the climax is as profoundly unexpected and shocking as the end of the first half of Full Metal Jacket.\n\nYet while Kubrick’s own “My way or the highway” story is as celebrated as any in Hollywood history, his determination to march to the beat of his own drum had nothing on the actor around whom The Killing revolves, Sterling Hayden, a name all-but erased from widespread awareness. Such was the price one had to pay in paranoid post-WW2 America for being outed as a pinko Commie traitor. Not that Hayden gave a damn. Never has Tinseltown harboured a more radical or reluctant star.\n\nThe Library of Congress testifies to Hayden’s talent. The US National Film Registry housed there lists no fewer than five of his films as “culturally, historically or aesthetically” significant: The Asphalt Jungle, Johnny Guitar, Dr Strangelove (Or How I Stopped Worrying And Learned To Love The Bomb), The Godfather and The Long Goodbye.\n\nYet Hayden was disdainful of his craft, which he pursued primarily to finance whichever new boat took his fancy. “Bastards,” was how he described most of his celluloid appearances, “conceived in contempt of life and spewn out onto screens across the world with noxious ballyhoo; saying nothing, contemptuous of the truth, sullen and lecherous.”\n\nBorn Sterling Relyea Walter and poor, Hayden was adopted by his stepfather, James Hayden, and, after a nomadic childhood, ran away to sea at 17, rising rapidly to renowned ship’s captain. Encouraged by friends, he approached producer Edward Griffith and came away clutching a Paramount contract. Needless to add, his looks didn’t hurt his reinvention.\n\nTowering over co-stars at an intimidating 6ft 5in, unsmiling, granite-jawed and Nordic-featured, he was dubbed “The Most Beautiful Man in the Movies” and “The Beautiful Blond Viking God” (as well as the somewhat less macho “Shirley”). “Incredible, really, how I got away with it,” he would reflect, “parlaying nine years at sea into two decades of posturing.”\n\nBut beneath the beauty lay plenty of beastly. Francis Coppola knew what he was doing when he lured Hayden from the wilderness to play the corrupt cop in The Godfather. Nobody else could have punched Al Pacino’s clean-cut face with such convincingly vicious power and ferocity that he transformed Michael Corleone from a clean-cut war hero into a savage mobster. One who, the next time they met, would blow his brains out.\n\nImperishable as those scenes were, Hayden only had a cameo in The Godfather, but that stubborn minimalism was centre stage in the other four of his movies preserved by the Library of Congress. He was Dix Handley, a loyal henchman, in The Asphalt Jungle (1950), another hypnotic heist movie as well as one of the most gripping of noirs, In the title role of Johnny Guitar (1954) he’s a reformed gunslinger neck-deep in a love-hate tryst with Joan Crawford’s titanium-tough bar-owner Vienna.\n\nIn The Long Goodbye (1973), he steals the show as Roger Wade, a spouse-beating alcoholic author castrated by writer’s block. Most unforgettably of all, in Dr. Strangelove (1964) he’s General Jack D. Ripper, the blackly comic gung-ho part that bore closest resemblance to his public persona while subverting it: General Ripper blames his sexual impotence on “the Russkis” and issues irreversible orders to bomb Moscow.\n\nHayden’s journey from blond bombshell to Red renegade was as typical of a man allergic to standing still as the fact that he wed one of his four wives three times. If the title of Woody Allen’s memoir, Apropos of Nothing, represents one extreme of the aptness spectrum, Hayden’s choice, The Wanderer, marks the opposite.\n\nQuitting Paramount before the Japanese blitzed Pearl Harbour (and just after the studio bought him the boat used in Captains Courageous), he shrewdly signed up for the Marines as “John Hamilton” to eliminate the prospect of being teased as a Hollywood pretty boy, and soon joined the Office of Strategy Services, the forerunner of the CIA. The OSS had been founded by his chum “Wild Bill” Donovan, the barely-disguised model for Robert De Niro’s character Bill Sullivan in his grossly underrated self-directed epic The Good Shepherd.\n\nHayden thus had a busier war than most. The only American selected to receive commando training in Scotland, he parachuted into Croatia and ran guns and supplies to Yugoslav partisans behind German lines. He also befriended Yugoslavia’s growing band of Communists; the partisans’ leader, the future President Tito, pinned a medal on his chest.\n\nHayden was not only a vocal anti-capitalist; he supported the Hollywood Ten, the writers and directors banished by the studios after refusing to testify to the House UnAmerican Activities Committee over their Communist links. In stark contrast to Elia Kazan, he was ashamed for “ratting” to HUAC, with whom he co-operated in naming names during Joe McCarthy’s communist witch-hunts. No regret haunted him more.\n\nIF HAYDEN WAS a “posturer”, he fooled an awful lot of clever people, including the stellar directors of that quintessential quintet of movies: Robert Altman, Francis Coppola, John Huston, Stanley Kubrick and Nicholas Ray. In fact, Jack D. Ripper was Hayden’s second plum role for Kubrick; the first was Johnny Clay in The Killing.\n\nReleased six years after The Asphalt Jungle and another masterly exercise in sunless noir, The Killing, according to Kubrick, was his first “mature” feature. Like all his best screenplays, this one was adapted from a novel, in this instance Lionel White’s Clean Break. Clay is the stick-up man and conductor of a meticulously orchestrated racetrack robbery that we see unfold in episodic, overlapping and, most daringly for the era, non-linear fashion.\n\n“Seeing it without his credit, would you guess it was by Kubrick?” wondered Roger Ebert rhetorically. As the esteemed critic asserted, every Kubrick movie stands alone, a gem of unique hue and gleam even when the subject is war, as it was on three occasions. Narrated by Art Gilmore, a well-known if uncredited radio announcer, The Killing is less about guns and hitmen than precise timings, chess and the domino effect.\n\nRevelling in pulp novelist Jim Thompson’s quickfire contributions to the diamond-hard dialogue, Hayden moulds Clay into a canny cookie with a keen eye for the tiniest details. He enlists specialist “pros” while refusing to reveal the identities of their accomplices, let alone any broader elements of his audacious plan to plunder $2m – the killing in question – from the Lansdowne racetrack in San Francisco. The horses are shot thrillingly by Sam Peckinpah’s favourite cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, though the actual venue was Bay Meadows, then the most venerable track in California.\n\nArt steals more blatantly from life in an early scene where Clay hires Maurice, a pro wrestler, to create a distraction by instigating a bar brawl. Not only do they meet at the same chess club Hayden frequented as a boy; Kubrick himself was a chess junkie who played zealously between scenes.\n\nNot that the chess connection is solely worth pointing out as tasty trivia. Clay plots the heist as Kubrick plotted a chess game. Every rook, bishop and pawn has their job to do and place to be at a synchronised juncture. Everything depends on making the right move at the right time and in the right order. Even the slightest mis-step could cause the dominos to fall. Even in the dying moments, when he has every excuse to rip off that mask of stoical cool, Hayden, like any experienced chess player, remains poker-faced. It is impossible to imagine anyone else as Clay. Perhaps all that posturing was simply Sterling playing Sterling.\n\nThe Killing is about as romantic as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the heart still weeps and snaps, especially as we spy on Sherry and George, a cruelly ill-wed couple. Marie Windsor, who made Marlene Dietrich look innocent, is at her ruthless best as the faithless femme fatale, every contemptuous quip a dagger in the chest of the mousey husband she looks down on literally as well as figuratively. As the sexless cashier desperate to win back her unblind faith, Elisha Cook regales us with the most vividly pathetic of all the fall guys he’d portrayed in noir classics such as The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon. All Clay has to do to make Sherry behave is threaten to beat her duplicitous face into “hamburger meat”.\n\nCook is such a brilliant sap, in fact, that it’s hard to stifle a guilty giggle upon re-glimpsing that grim, hope-drained face. And yes, given the extensive pleasures we derive from the tragedies that fuel noir, we viewers, of course, are sadistically complicit.\n\nThe last line is right up there with “Nobody’s perfect” and “Shut up and deal”: urged to run from the law by his childhood sweetheart, Clay replies, “What’s the point?”. That could so easily have been the sign-off to every noir.\n\nTo reveal any more truly would be an unforgiveable crime.\n\nBy Ruby Ephstein\n\nTHERE ARE FEW THINGS in life truly worth loathing, but received wisdom is undeniably this column’s noirest bête noir. Take “The Best Concert Movies of All Time” (Rolling Stone and Rotten Tomatoes) or variations such as “20 Greatest Concert Films” (The Guardian).\n\nFor one thing, the words “Pop” and/or “Rock” so implicit in those titles are missing, never mind “Soul”, “Jazz” and “Reggae”, much less any other musical genre. To these eyes and sensibilities, the two most uplifting concert scenes on screen could hardly offer a starker sonic or visual contrast: Bruce Springsteen and The E St Band’s 20-minute re-bonding on Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out from their 2000 NYC reunion (a gift from HBO that never stops giving) and, in Maestro, Bradley Cooper’s imperious impersonation of Lenny Bernstein electrifying Ely Cathedral in 1973, wringing out every ounce of his vast if not always pious passions conducting Mahler’s 2nd.\n\nIt feels safe to presume, nonetheless, that a classical music gig will never be a) called a gig, or b) qualify for one of the aforementioned Guardian or Rotten Tomatoes charts. The sticking-point, box-office-wise, is that orchestras are essentially dress-alike covers acts whose idea of stagecraft is leaning forward. So why not clarify matters? Why not bill the ones that do dominate said charts as “Gig Movies”? If nothing else, Mahler fans won’t get miffed.\n\nFor another thing, even now, in what may turn out to be their heyday, gig movies are far from 10 a penny. As a genre, unlike musicals, westerns, horror and noir, they’ve barely reached middle-age. Commemorating the inaugural pop/rock festival, Monterey Pop (1968) was the first member of the litter, though aside from Jimi Hendrix setting his guitar alight and Pete Townshend bashing his to bits, its impact was but a pinprick next to Woodstock (1970), the three-hour, multiscreen epic on which Martin Scorsese cut his teeth.\n\nAnd because gig movies were only ever intended to be a secondhand experience, at best, and thus lacked box-office appeal, it has taken this century’s documentary boom, and the recent advent of simultaneous live Odeon transmissions, to thicken the best-of-breed contenders to any significant degree.\n\nThe latest nauseating spot of consensus has it that the best gig movie is Stop Making Sense. David Byrne’s baggy suit, an irresistible electro-funk stew and Jonathan Demme’s imaginative staging are all tremendous fun, granted, but ambition was limited. As Geoffrey Cheshire’s stirring essay for The Criterion Collection put it, this column’s choice, Gimme Shelter (1970), gave the Rolling Stones “what no one had bargained for: a terrifying snapshot of the sudden collapse of the sixties”.\n\nHaving only just seen the latter on a big screen for the first time, as part of a European re-release (you can stream it on Amazon), I can only concur wholesouledly with the view that, when it comes to cinema verité, the Maysles brothers’ sickening documentary of the anti-Woodstock, held on the West Coast at Altamont, struck the motherlode.\n\nSure, the cameras miss Marty Balin, the Jefferson Airplane vocalist, being knocked out by Hell’s Angels, foolishly hired as security (in exchange for a barrel of beer) and brandishing pool cues in a way even Ronnie O’Sullivan might never have countenanced. As it is, we get more than enough of the prelude (Balin mouthing off at the abusive leatherjackets) and the aftermath (Balin’s battered face). And those peace and love vibes at Hyde Park just a few months earlier, where Mick Jagger bid farewell to Brian Jones by releasing a fleet of doves and reading a poem by Shelley? Gone for good.\n\nNo scene in the annals of gig movies, nevertheless, is more chilling than when those beer-pumped Angels seize the mile-high, gun-toting Meredith Hunter as he advances towards the stage, then knife and bludgeon him to death.\n\nThere had been good reason to fear such a grisly outcome. Not only had Jagger been subjected to death threats, hence the insistence that no audience member be allowed to invade the stage; as he stepped off the helicopter on arrival, he was punched by someone he might reasonably have assumed to be a fan.\n\nWatching him watch Hunter’s murder unfold on a monitor backstage is like surfing an emotional pendulum. No matter how you feel about rock’s first and foremost frontman, it would take an act of astonishing anatomic control not to gulp or shudder at the way his face slides from preening pride – in a terrific band performance, in the way the filming was going – to grim, guilty stupefaction. And the song he happened to be singing as Hunter was savaged? Sympathy for the Devil, what else?\n\nIn The New Yorker, Pauline Kael, by no means a rock chick, derided it all as wish-fulfilment and a sham, alleging – wrongly, according to the Mayleses – that the show was designed and lit for the cameras. The ingredients, though, were all in place: a free festival headlined by their satanic majesties for 300,000 drugged-up if not loved-up fans at a San Francisco speedway track in the final month of the most radical yet delusional of decades.\n\n“I think it affected all of us very profoundly,” guitarist Mick Taylor reflected on recordings released only last year. “The only thing we were very upset about was being accused and held responsible for what happened. You can’t really blame anybody in that kind of mass hysteria.”\n\nNonetheless, Don McLean’s dream that drums and wires could “save your mortal soul” was in tatters. On American Pie, there was nothing ambivalent about his allusions to Jagger (“Jack Flash”): “I saw Satan dancing with delight the day the music died.”\n\nWell, it didn’t die, did it? And Jagger, who has done more than most to keep it alive and rocking, certainly didn’t deserve crucifixion. Understandably, forgivably, he still shies clear of the topic with religious fervour. Even so, one can only imagine how many times his nights have been ruptured by those visual scars.\n\nOn the infinitely brighter side, the Stones were in marvellous nick for the Maylses, majestic as well as satanic. MC Mick struts like a coked-up peacock, the consummate rabble-rouser; Bill Wyman cuddles his bass and plucks it with infinitely more dexterity than you ever remembered; from the opening chords of Jumpin’ Jack Flash, Richards and Taylor’s complementary twin guitars – so much more diverse and fascinating than the riff-heavy Keef-Ronnie combo – lock into a funky fusion of flying fingers. Needless to add, Charlie was bloody good that night too.\n\nAnd, as you watch them, you can’t help but be reminded why the other act you’ve known for all these years has now been going more than half a century longer than Sgt Pepper’s squabbling slackers. Love ’em or merely tolerate them (how can you possibly loathe an octogenarian-led band that can still persuade tens of thousands of Brazilians to stump up a week’s wages to see them?), the Stones remain England’s hardiest Sixties tribute act.\n\nWithin five years of Altamont, they would be in freefall recording-wise, yet even now, the sellouts (literal, never spiritual) persist. Mick and Keef have pretty much always known that sticking to the same seat in the same carriage on the same track could pay considerable dividends. Happily, Gimme Shelter, which showcases the chemistry responsible, works as celebration as well as damnation.\n\nTop 10 Gig Movies\n\nGimme Shelter (Rolling Stones)\n\nLive In New York City (Bruce Springsteen & The E St Band)\n\nThe Last Waltz (The Band, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Muddy Waters et al)\n\nSummer of Soul (Stevie Wonder, Sly & The Family Stone, Nina Simone, Staple Singers et al)\n\nStop Making Sense (Talking Heads)\n\nGet Back (The Beatles)\n\nSign O’ The Times (Prince)\n\nMonterey Pop (Jimi Hendrix, Mamas & Papas, Otis Redding, Ravi Shankar et al)\n\nLive At Pompeii (Pink Floyd)\n\nWoodstock (Janis Joplin, The Who, Santana, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Joan Baez et al)\n\nThe satanic majesty of Gimme Shelter\n\nBy Ruby Ephstein\n\nTHERE ARE FEW THINGS in life truly worth loathing, but received wisdom is undeniably this column’s noirest bête noir.

As Geoffrey Cheshire’s stirring essay for The Criterion Collection put it, this column’s choice, Gimme Shelter (1970), gave the Rolling Stones “what no one had bargained for: a terrifying snapshot of the sudden collapse of the sixties”.\n\nHaving only just seen the latter on a big screen for the first time, as part of a European re-release (you can stream it on Amazon), I can only concur wholesouledly with the view that, when it comes to cinema verité, the Maysles brothers’ sickening documentary of the anti-Woodstock, held on the West Coast at Altamont, struck the motherlode.\n\nSure, the cameras miss Marty Balin, the Jefferson Airplane vocalist, being knocked out by Hell’s Angels, foolishly hired as security (in exchange for a barrel of beer) and brandishing pool cues in a way even Ronnie O’Sullivan might never have countenanced. As it is, we get more than enough of the prelude (Balin mouthing off at the abusive leatherjackets) and the aftermath (Balin’s battered face). And those peace and love vibes at Hyde Park just a few months earlier, where Mick Jagger bid farewell to Brian Jones by releasing a fleet of doves and reading a poem by Shelley? Gone for good.\n\nNo scene in the annals of gig movies, nevertheless, is more chilling than when those beer-pumped Angels seize the mile-high, gun-toting Meredith Hunter as he advances towards the stage, then knife and bludgeon him to death.\n\nThere had been good reason to fear such a grisly outcome. Not only had Jagger been subjected to death threats, hence the insistence that no audience member be allowed to invade the stage; as he stepped off the helicopter on arrival, he was punched by someone he might reasonably have assumed to be a fan.\n\nWatching him watch Hunter’s murder unfold on a monitor backstage is like surfing an emotional pendulum. No matter how you feel about rock’s first and foremost frontman, it would take an act of astonishing anatomic control not to gulp or shudder at the way his face slides from preening pride – in a terrific band performance, in the way the filming was going – to grim, guilty stupefaction. And the song he happened to be singing as Hunter was savaged? Sympathy for the Devil, what else?\n\nIn The New Yorker, Pauline Kael, by no means a rock chick, derided it all as wish-fulfilment and a sham, alleging – wrongly, according to the Mayleses – that the show was designed and lit for the cameras. The ingredients, though, were all in place: a free festival headlined by their satanic majesties for 300,000 drugged-up if not loved-up fans at a San Francisco speedway track in the final month of the most radical yet delusional of decades.\n\n“I think it affected all of us very profoundly,” guitarist Mick Taylor reflected on recordings released only last year. “The only thing we were very upset about was being accused and held responsible for what happened. You can’t really blame anybody in that kind of mass hysteria.”\n\nNonetheless, Don McLean’s dream that drums and wires could “save your mortal soul” was in tatters. On American Pie, there was nothing ambivalent about his allusions to Jagger (“Jack Flash”): “I saw Satan dancing with delight the day the music died.”\n\nWell, it didn’t die, did it? And Jagger, who has done more than most to keep it alive and rocking, certainly didn’t deserve crucifixion. Understandably, forgivably, he still shies clear of the topic with religious fervour. Even so, one can only imagine how many times his nights have been ruptured by those visual scars.\n\nOn the infinitely brighter side, the Stones were in marvellous nick for the Maylses, majestic as well as satanic. MC Mick struts like a coked-up peacock, the consummate rabble-rouser; Bill Wyman cuddles his bass and plucks it with infinitely more dexterity than you ever remembered; from the opening chords of Jumpin’ Jack Flash, Richards and Taylor’s complementary twin guitars – so much more diverse and fascinating than the riff-heavy Keef-Ronnie combo – lock into a funky fusion of flying fingers. Needless to add, Charlie was bloody good that night too.\n\nAnd, as you watch them, you can’t help but be reminded why the other act you’ve known for all these years has now been going more than half a century longer than Sgt Pepper’s squabbling slackers. Love ’em or merely tolerate them (how can you possibly loathe an octogenarian-led band that can still persuade tens of thousands of Brazilians to stump up a week’s wages to see them?), the Stones remain England’s hardiest Sixties tribute act.\n\nWithin five years of Altamont, they would be in freefall recording-wise, yet even now, the sellouts (literal, never spiritual) persist. Mick and Keef have pretty much always known that sticking to the same seat in the same carriage on the same track could pay considerable dividends. Happily, Gimme Shelter, which showcases the chemistry responsible, works as celebration as well as damnation.\n\nTop 10 Gig Movies\n\nGimme Shelter (Rolling Stones)\n\nLive In New York City (Bruce Springsteen & The E St Band)\n\nThe Last Waltz (The Band, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Muddy Waters et al)\n\nSummer of Soul (Stevie Wonder, Sly & The Family Stone, Nina Simone, Staple Singers et al)\n\nStop Making Sense (Talking Heads)\n\nGet Back (The Beatles)\n\nSign O’ The Times (Prince)\n\nMonterey Pop (Jimi Hendrix, Mamas & Papas, Otis Redding, Ravi Shankar et al)\n\nLive At Pompeii (Pink Floyd)\n\nWoodstock (Janis Joplin, The Who, Santana, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Joan Baez et al)\n\nAfter a wildly successful 2022/23 season which saw the seagulls land a place in a European competition for the first time in the club’s history by finishing 6th in the league table, there was a huge expectation for the team to push on even further and thrive in this year’s premier league season. However, despite a great first half of the season, the south-coast outfit finished a respectable but disappointing 11th. Here is how the season panned out:\n\nThe pre-season summer transfer window was a promising one for Brighton, yet at the same time disappointing. One of the key players in last year’s success, Ecuadorian midfielder Moises Caicedo, had attracted huge interest from the top clubs as a result of his heroics the previous season. Therefore, unsurprisingly, Chealsea came swooping in and netted Brighton a £115million payout for the midfielder, with Chelsea also forking out another £25million to grab the seagulls’ goalkeeper, Robert Sanchez. Argentine midfielder Alexis Macallister also left the club, going to Liverpool for £35million. This influx of money allowed Roberto De Zerbi and the board to splash the cash on what effectively would need to be a rebuild of part of the core of the team. De Zerbi brough in exciting young forward Joao Pedro from Watford for £30million, brought in superstar youngster Ansu Fati on loan from Barcelona, and filled the goalkeeper void with Bart Verbruggen from Anderlecht for £16.3million. Among other comings and goings, the squad looked ready to play brilliant football ahead of the coming season.\n\nThe team hit the ground running at the start of the premier league season, winning five of the first six games, including 3-1 victories against Newcastle and Manchester United. After the first six games, Brighton sat in third place in the premier league, their best start ever to a premier league season, and ultimately stirred up excitement among the fans. Although the form didn’t continue quite as exceptionally after the first six games, Brighton certainly impressed as the first few months of the season flew by, with the attack firing on all cylinders courtesy of new signing Joao Pedro and promising Irish youngster Evan Ferguson, who impressed premier league fans everywhere by scoring a hat-trick against Newcastle at the beginning of the campaign. Despite the firepower in attack, the defence was leaky. It took until the 20th match week for the defence to keep a clean sheet, something that is not ideal even when your attack is delivering the goals. To show the contrast in form between the attack and defence, until Arsenal defeated the seagulls 2-0 at the Emirates in December, Brighton had conceded at least one and scored at least one in each of the first 16 games of the season.\n\nThe first half of the season also saw Brighton undertake their first ever European football campaign, as they were drawn in a Europa League group with Ajax (Netherlands), Marseille (France), and AEK Athens (Greece). The campaign started shakily, with the seagulls losing the first game 3-2 at home to Athens, before a 2-2 draw in Marseille. They had it all to do in the final four games of the group, and boy did they deliver. Brighton won all four of the remaining games with a flawless record, scoring six and conceding zero across the four fixtures, including a magnificent 2-0 win in Amsterdam against the Dutch giants Ajax.\n\nAt the halfway point of the season, Brighton were comfortably through to the knockout stages of the Europa League, sat in a respectable 8th place in the premier league, and were ready to begin their FA cup run, although the seagulls were knocked out of the league cup with a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea in the 3rd round in September. The season was looking promising and Roberto De Zerbis’s side were playing great football.\n\nAs we moved into the second half of the season, the January transfer window was a quiet one for Brighton. Five players were brought in, however it seems the board were looking to the future in this window, as not a single player over the age of 20 was brought in. The club brought in five youngsters, one of which being Argentinian wonderkid Valentin Barco from Boca Juniors for £7.8million. Although building for the future is a key part of long-term success, you can’t help but think De Zerbi would have wished for some first team ready players to be scooped up during the January window, especially as an injury crisis began to hit the club. Brighton failed to score in three successive matches in the premier league in January, mostly down to the team playing without any natural wingers during this time, with Kaoru Mitoma, Solly March, Ansu Fati, and Simon Adingra all out injured. The season seemed to be coming to a disastrous halt as not only was the attack running out of steam, but the defence was leaking goals badly during this period. It seems that due to the departure of defensive-midfielder Moises Caicedo in the summer, Brighton were seriously lacking a ball winning midfielder in the team to solidify the centre backs behind, and as a result Brighton conceded 4 goals to newly promoted Luton Town. The lack of first team recruitment in the January transfer window meant that the squad was to be bare for at least a few weeks, and the rest of the season relied on the important players making quick recoveries back to the first team.\n\nDespite the less-than-ideal January in the premier league, Brighton smashed their way past Stoke City and Sheffield United in the Fa cup 3rd and 4th rounds respectively, to set themselves up with a 5th round tie at the end of February away to Wolves.\n\nAs the weeks carried on, Brighton slowly saw themselves dropping out of contention for another year in European football. The goals were not flying in like they did in the first half of the season, and the team was still conceding too many goals. They travelled away to Wolves for the FA cup 5th round tie and were beaten 1-0 by an early Mario Lemina goal after just two minutes. Then, in early march, Brighton were to face Roma (Italy) in the round of 16 for the Europa league, with the first leg being a daunting fixture away in Rome. It then proved to be daunting and more, as Roma put four past a struggling Brighton to win the first leg tie 4-0 and leave Brighton a mountain to climb back at the Amex for the second leg. Then, a week later, Brighton played well and won the return fixture 1-0, however with just the one goal scored, it was not enough to overcome the aggregate difference Roma had built for themselves and ultimately Brighton crashed out of the Europa league in the first knockout round. Despite the elimination, the seagulls should be proud of themselves by making it to the knockout rounds of their debut campaign in European football and can only use it to spur them on for future ventures into the rest of the continent.\n\nThe seagulls now found themselves in just one competition after being knocked out of the remaining cups, and could attempt to focus their energy on reviving this premier league campaign. However, it just was not meant to be as they experienced their worst second half to a season since the 2018/19 campaign and really struggled to reach the heights they had soared to at the end of last season. By the time the end of may arrived, Brighton found themselves in 11th position and some distance away from a European place next year. Disappointing yes, but by no means was this a terrible season for Brighton. The team were riddled with injuries for most of the year, with the seagulls having the fifth-most days lost to injury in the entire league, something that will inevitably hamper the ability to play the football that the manager intends to play. In addition to this, Brighton’s team is young compared to the rest of the league, with even more youngsters being brought in in January to carve a bright future for the South-coast club.\n\nWe are yet to see which players come and go from the club in the upcoming transfer window, a window I am sure will be used to both bring in future talent, and reinforce the current first team players to avoid a crisis from happening quite like the one we saw this year. With the announcement of the departure of manager Roberto De Zerbi this summer also, the club will have to look for a suitable replacement that can work with the team De Zerbi has built. Whether or not we will be seeing Brighton and Hover Albion playing a different brand of football is to be seen in August when we kick off the next season, one that Brighton will be eager to attack just as well as they did this year.\n\nThe very word Gail’s got the armchair grumpies and keyboard warriors out in force, but slow down. Put away your prejudices. Just because somewhere has more than one branch doesn’t meant they’re the bad guys. Gilly Smith reports\n\nOnce upon a time in Brighton, you could gauge the feel of a neighbourhood by whether or not it had a Tin Drum. The family-run chain of bars and eateries, latterly serving charcuterie boards from the owners’ home-raised pigs, first opened on Dyke Road, home now to The Cow, and became a badge of gentrification. These days, it’s a Wolfox. Or maybe a Gail’s.\n\nThe number of Gail’s opening across the south east has long exceeded a bakers’ dozen. Our new one in the Dials will be the 130th to opens its doors since the first bakery over 30 years ago in Hampstead High Street. The new Gail’s set up shop in Night Shift, formerly the collaboration between Flour Pot, Curing Rebels, Curio Wines, and local artist, She Paints, which has camped out there since the demise of Brighton-born Small Batch. And it’s already had a pasting. It was daubed with graffiti declaring it ‘boring’ before it had even opened, a spray-painted penis summing up the outpouring of anti-establishment feelings all over social media.\n\nWhich is odd really, as Gail herself was a bit of a radical.\n\nGail’s began with a mission to do things differently. Back in the early 1990s, it created a bit of a rise in the restaurant industry by taking the values of sour dough – slow, crafted, natural, like bread used to be, as bread should be.\n\nAt its helm was artisanal baker, Gail Mejia, whose ironically named Bread Factory had been a wholesale retailer in Hampstead. She and her tiny team of bakers quickly realised that what they were making for top notch restaurants just wasn’t available in most neighbourhoods. They decided to fix that, and Gail’s Bakery was born.\n\nThirty years later, Gail is a biodynamic farmer in Portugal, as Tom Molnar (pictured), Gail’s CEO tells me as we chat about the new opening in The Dials. “She spent 10 really hard years before I met her, putting together the bakers, working with some top chefs, and building the thing that I fell in love with.” A disruptor, a visionary, she was part of the Slow Food movement that has been so influential in making us rethink our relationship with food.\n\n“She represents a whole bunch of hippies in food who changed so much,” says Tom. He means chefs like Rose Gray, Alistair Little and Sally Clarke who came back to London from America in the 80s and 90s with a dream of a simpler way of eating fresh, organic food, as championed by restaurateur and food legend, Alice Waters. Fermented sour dough was just part of the mix. ‘When everything was becoming mass (market), they just stuck to their guns and said, ‘Look, that doesn’t make sense’. It wasn’t the engineers and the business people that got it right” says Tom, a former management consultant who recognised the potential for Gail’s back in 2005, “it was the hippies and the food pioneers.”\n\nNow 130 Gail’s bakeries are quietly changing the food industry, not least by working with Natoora, a distribution hub on a mission to fix the food system by building direct relationships with small-scale growers and independent producers. Gail’s distributes its surplus food through Neighbourly, a network of over 29,000 charities and community groups and an award-winning giving platform “that connects company funds, surplus and volunteer time with local causes to make a positive impact.” But does any of that matter to the customers?\n\nPresumably it doesn’t to Juliet who wonders on Instagram how they justify £5 for a pain au chocolat in a cost-of-living crisis. Or Laura on Seven Dials Facebook group who’s boycotted Gail’s since they stopped taking cash. “Maybe not all of them”, concedes Tom. “Maybe there’s 10-20% that do care.” So who tells them about the spirit of Gail that’s still stirred into every loaf of bread so long after she left the building to sow her own seeds. “Yeah, it’s tricky”, admits Tom. There’s no messaging in the shops, and you’d have to read the website to get any real sense of what Gail’s is all about. Tom says he struggles with how loud the revolution should be. “You don’t want to be the person at the party who talks all the time, and you don’t want to be that person who doesn’t say anything. You’ve got to be somewhere in between to be heard. And I don’t know if we found the right balance yet.”\n\nI think he’s missing a trick; give me some blackboards in a café telling the back stories of growers and carbon reducing mission statements, and I’m in. Tom doesn’t think it would have been Gail’s style. “She’s still one of my teachers’, he says. “I’m just trying to do my best to keep her view on food alive. I didn’t want to destroy what she had built. My job was to just let it flourish, I guess.”\n\nLike a good loaf of bread, one might say.\n\nl Gail’s in Seven Dials is opening soon\n\nIn the meantime, you can sample their wares at:\n\n93 North Rd, BN1 1YE\n\nMon – Fri: 7.15am-5.30pm; Sat: 7.30am-6pm; Sun: 7.30am-5pm\n\nIn the first in a new series, Andrew says “Yes” to volunteering\n\nat The Real Junk Food Cafe. But first, table tennis was calling\n\nAs a boy, I was obsessed with table-tennis. I dreamed of competing at high levels but a career stopped in its tracks at the Shropshire Under-13 tournaments, where I was dumped out 11-0, by the eventual champion. A once promising career never recovered, and like so many other once promising careers, I hadn’t really thought about it since. But then, out of the blue, The Whistler called.\n\n“Do you want to come to a night of table-tennis at The Fitzherbert Cafe?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI was in a bit of a swamp after the failure of a dramatically difficult project, dithering about the right way out, so this was perfect timing.\n\nThe Fitz Café is in Bristol Road in the St George’s Rd bit of Kemptown, right beside The Brighton Table-Tennis Club. Inside, I was warmly greeted by Tim, the club’s inspirational Head Coach, who proudly introduced me to Harry, who’s apparently the UK’s top ranked player with Downs Syndrome. He was smacking down backhand drives to Bly, who he assured me, would soon be a World Paralympic Number One.\n\nI just knew he’d ask me to play, and I knew I would – I can’t refuse to do anything!] – but for now I felt shy, and ducked into the café.\n\nThe Real Junk Food Project was set up in 2014 by Adam Buckingham, who would visit supermarkets, and allotments, picking up surplus, or almost-off food, which would be cooked to cater for a Pay As You Feel Café, where the richer diners – who want to eat delicious food, while doing some good – help to fund a community of people who might be rough sleepers, or just hungry.\n\nCafé Manager Kathy loves this element. “I used to help run a soup kitchen in Florida, and we’d turn hungry people away, since they couldn’t prove their credentials. The mix of people makes everyone feel good. You should come and volunteer!” I said I would, and came back the next day, when…\n\nI started with Front of House, which basically means chatting to people. I sat with DJ and Rob discussing addiction. DJ’s been five weeks sober; Rob has gone 12 months without crack or smack.\n\n“Wow,” I said, “I hear they’re quite more-ish!”\n\n“That’s why I’m here!” he said. “It distracts me. Most days I volunteer somewhere, but here I just come for the chat!”\n\n“It’s same for me,” said DJ, “I love that you meet rich people, poor people, sober people, street people, famous people, but also it’s incredibly good food.”\n\n“Who’s famous?” I asked. “You’ll have to work that out, yourself!” he said.\n\nIn the kitchen, I met Jimmy, who was making Dauphinoise. “I worked in the music business, which can be all about ego and solo glory. I love that here, you turn up, you’re part of a team, and you feel you’ve done something. Plus the food’s amazing!”\n\nI met Elodie, Head Chef, who’s worked in Michelin-starred restaurants. ‘But I prefer it here. You work with the ingredients that turn up, so it’s creative. Try!”\n\nI sat down with Anna, who was beaming the room’s warmest smile. An Arabic woman, recently moved from Italy, she was with Voices In Exile – an organisation that helps refugees with food or toiletries or legal help. “I love to come so I can practice my English.” I smiled at her friends.\n\n“You need to play table-tennis,” commanded Wadie, a Syrian refugee.\n\nThere was no putting it off, and, when you haven’t played ping-pong in 38 years, your game’s rusty. But four minutes in, he hit a ball high, and I thwacked back a backhand topspin. “Good shot!” said Tim, and I could see why his club’s so successful. It’s not just that the guy’s got skill: he takes an interest.\n\nAnd suddenly there I was, playing doubles with Tim (former UK Number 8), against Wadie and Harry. I barely hit a good shot, but it was as Jimmy said: success is not about solo glory; it’s about being in a team; and sometimes you’ve just got to step up, and stay in the point. We won two games to one, and I left feeling connected and content and proud.\n\nI went outside where I’d been invited to help plant a new tree, but it was on a slope, so the water was draining away. But this is the thing about volunteering: you find you can offer something.\n\n“I know what to do here,” I said, and dug a moat around the tree. That’s how they taught me in Haiti.\n\n“So what was your dramatically difficult project?” asked Deb, Head of Gardening. “I sailed the Atlantic, and I persuaded 1000 Caribbean kids, to plant 1000 trees.”\n\n“So what was a failure about that?”\n\n“Well,” I said, “I haven’t told anyone about it!”\n\n“Well, you have now!,” said Tim.\n\nGod, I felt good about the whole day, and would urge anyone out there who’s vaguely thinking about it, to volunteer. Or just to get down to the Fitz Café, where if you pay for lunch, you’re paying it forward.\n\nI’m now looking to volunteer for something else. So if you know of a community project, and wonder if I can join, you know what I’ll say.\n\nMrcloverthefamoussnail@gmail.com\n\nl The Real Junk Food Project Brighton’s Community Cafe is now open at St John the Baptist parish hall, 2 Bristol Road BN2 1AP\n\nOpening times:\n\nMon: 11.00-15.00 (lunch from noon)\n\nTues: Fri: 10.00-15.00 (lunch from noon)\n\nSat12.30-14.30\n\nWe wanted to revamp our kitchen. New surfaces, new worktops, new doors. We wanted something stylish, individual, sustainable and didn’t cost a fortune, something a little more “us” than going into a kitchen store and buying something off the shelf. How hard could that be?\n\nActually, we tried that, went to the usual places and saw the usual stuff. Things with names like Nordic Noir and made of granite or Corian. Nice enough, but a bit uninspiring. It started to become a little bit of an obsession. Eventually, we decided on a radical, if familiar, course of action. “Let’s go for a drink and something to eat”.\n\nWe went to Fumi, the new Japanese in Circus Street. The food’s great there and it’s been designed beautifully, a very stylish clean aesthetic. Sitting there, we couldn’t help notice the furniture. The tables looked like marble, but clearly weren’t.\n\n“We had them made for us. They’re really interesting, they’re made from used coffee”.\n\nWhat?\n\nTwo days later I was talking to Jani Lemut in, obviously, a coffee shop.\n\n“It was just an obvious thing to do. I was working with an interior design company who were importing all their furniture from India, but wanted to be more local and sustainable and so on, so they contacted me. We started talking about new designs and what we can do and what different materials to use, local materials. I started thinking ‘What else can I use?’ And coffee was very obvious, because it was just on the table. It was just there”.\n\nHow many cups of coffee get thrown away?\n\n“Probably a lot”, said Jani. “I heard a statistic, I don’t know whether it’s right or not, but the average person in UK spends £25 pounds a year on coffee. In Brighton, it’s £75”.\n\nApparently there are more coffee shops here per head than anywhere else in the UK. And in Seven Dials…\n\n“Yes. Most probably. Yeah, and it’s still gaining popularity. It’s quite incredible”.\n\nJani is a “classically trained furniture maker” from Slovenia who came here after the war in Yugoslavia started in 1990. “I made wooden children’s toys and we had quite a nice steady business, but then after three or four months, the war started and that was it. Lost everything. The country came to a standstill and basically that’s what brought me here. “I came to see a friend of mine in Gloucestershire and I just loved it. Absolutely loved it. I love the freedom of expression here. When I got to London, I just loved it so much. I said to my friends, ‘Look you go back. I’m staying here’. And that was pretty much it.”\n\nHe moved to St Ives and “had a really good time, doing mainly designing and building furniture, cottages. I was doing lots of artwork as well, art exhibitions and so on. Everything was always based in recycled materials. I was always fascinated by what gets thrown away. What can one do with the challenge? I still feel excited by the idea we can turn objects into a different life. So that’s my main motivation”.\n\nHad you seen coffee used before?\n\n“People have tried using coffee in all sorts of products, but only as an additive. People have tried make composites are made of coffee and thermoplastics…” At this point Jani started talking about binding processes and chemistry. I ordered another coffee and waited for him to start speaking English again.\n\nHow long did it take you to work all this out?\n\n“Two years”.\n\nAnd you kept going with it? Because you were certain that it would work?\n\n“Well, I wasn’t certain certain, but there was a promising sign. The problem with it was stabilising the coffee because it’s organic it moves, it does all the the things that any organic stuff does. So to bind it in organic way, it’s quite difficult, but this is exactly what we were trying to do, to make a plastic free component”.\n\nAnd you have now?\n\n“Yes, we have. Yes.”\n\nThe results are really lovely, but it doesn’t only look lovely, it looks real. Organic.\n\n“Of course, because all the ingredients that we use are purely by-products of different materials. marble dust, copper, dust, metal. Then you’ve got spices, natural pigments and so on and so forth, all sorts of stuff like charcoal”.\n\nYou could make something beetroot colour?\n\n“Yeah, we do that”.\n\nCould you make something that blue?\n\n“Yes. Turquoise oxidize copper dust, a very intense turquoise”.\n\nThere are other uses for the materials but “I’m a bit wary of mixing too much either plastic or any chemicals with our product, because then it’s difficult to recycle further. So wherever we create, we try to create in such a way that is easy to dispose of or reuse later on. This is the main point of doing this. At the moment, our product, if you leave it out in a field for a couple of years, it will just disintegrate and it will go back to where it came from. That’s pretty much it”.\n\nEverything here is about sustainability. On their website (below) they say “We are carbon neutral. We plant a tree for every sale we make. Our materials are sourced locally and much of it from waste”. They are “a circular business. Everything gets recycled, everything gets re-used”.\n\nWe had the worktops done, the kitchen island and the dining table, and went for a copper sheen finish that looks great and always gets comments. It’s hard-wearing, waterproof, almost completely heatproof and can be made to any size or shape. It also cost about a third of what we were quoted in the high street.\n\n“Why make something that will be extortionate? Why make something nobody can afford? If you can make something that’s beautiful and accessible and sustainable, then what’s not to like?”\n\nhttps://tomasandjani.co.uk\n\n07930 944906\n\ninfo@tomasandjani.co.uk\n\n“I’m not going very far away, I’m absolutely still going to be supporting the party. I’m still not sure what I want to be doing, but rather than being the front bench spokesperson on everything, which I am at the minute, I want to find ways to focus on climate and nature. So really being able to focus on the natural world: That’s what I want to do, but I haven’t decided exactly how yet.”\n\nI’m sitting in the back room of a pub in Preston Park, and Caroline Lucas MP – we can still say that – is doing one of her constituency surgeries. “Usually we do surgeries in the office, but from time to time we do them out in the community so people can drop by and raise issues with us rather than having to come into the office.”\n\nI’ve started volunteering at Raystede rescue centre, I tell her. You could do that. I could have a word.\n\n“Oh, have you? That’s very good. We’ve got a rescue dog. We got him from RSPCA in Patcham. But we did go out to Raystede, it’s a lovely place.” And that was me, sold.\n\nShe’s got solid credentials coming out of her ears. She’s – still – our only Green MP and for the last 14 years has stood up and tried to hold the government to account, but more than that, she’s got a rescue dog from the RSPCA. Sold.\n\nAt the risk of sounding old and cynical and jaded – as if – it’s fair to say that public perception of our politicians has never been lower. In the last two by-elections, the turnout was 37% and 38%. And they were probably people out walking their dogs who’d gone into the polling station to take shelter from the rain before realising what was going on. This year there’s going to be a general election and up and down the land there’ll be a collective cheer as hope flows we’ll be able to make a positive change. We can let them know what we think. We can send them back to their expenses paid duck houses. Flags will be waved. Bunting… all that. Except maybe down here in Brighton Pavilion because down here, it’s a bit of a double-edged sword.\n\nWhile almost certainly the nation will kick the Tories out as the party of government, the alternative is offering precious little to get excited or inspired by. But, much more to the point, we’ll also lose Caroline Lucas as our MP because, as you’ll know, she’s standing down.\n\n“It has been an extraordinary privilege to represent this place. And, it’s been really lovely to have conversations with people who followed what I’ve been doing and feel proud to have a Green voice in Parliament. It has been quite emotional.”\n\nSian Berry is going to take her place as Green candidate, and Sian is lovely and very impressive in her own way, but she’s not Caroline Lucas. Not yet, anyway.\n\nCaroline’s been our MP since 2010, during which time she’s increased her majority from just over 1,000 to almost 20,000.\n\nYou’ve had a kind of weird position. You were an MP, the Green MP, but the Green Party, bless, is never going to get power. Were you ever tempted to join Labour because while you had a platform and got invited on Question Time a lot, but you weren’t ever going to be in the position to make policy. I can’t think of anyone else in British politics, who had that kind of position, except maybe for…\n\n“Who are you thinking of?”\n\nI can barely say it. Farage.\n\n“Well look at the impact that Farage has had on the political system without ever being elected. I mean, it might be terrible, but it is significant. And he didn’t need to be elected to do it. So I think that that reminds us that you don’t necessarily need to have loads of MPs in order to make a difference. Obviously, I would love to have loads of MPs. “I regularly asked myself, How do I make the biggest impact? What’s the best thing to do? And of course you wonder if it would be better to be working inside another political party. But then I remember that if I were, then I would be whipped by the leader of that party to follow that party line.\n\n“I think one of the things we need more than ever right now are MPs who are independently minded, who will stand up and do what’s best, in this case, for Brighton. Another Labour MP isn’t going to be able to do that here. They’re going to be whipped by Keir Starmer.\n\n“But we’ve got a fantastic candidate who’s standing in my place. She’s wonderful. And she might seem sweet, as you say, but she’s also fearless and formidable, in the sense that she will hold Sadiq Khan, or Rishi Sunak or Keir Starmer, whoever it is, to account. She is really good at doing that and she’s very determined and if you bring a problem – to her it’s like a dog with a bone, she will sort it out.”\n\nAnd now you’re going to do something else. Presumably, you’re talking about something a bit more focused and high-powered and pressure groupy than volunteering at Raystede.\n\n“I’m not sure yet. But I’m going to take a bit of a break, and then look around and work out how best I can use whatever\n\nexperience that I have, to work on more urgent action on the natural world.”\n\nYou must have had some nice offers. You’re high profile, popular, as near a celebrity as politicians get.\n\n“There have been some nice offers, but I’m really anxious not to rush into something. I really do want to take a bit of time out just to think about it because right now, honestly, the job is 70 hours a week easily, if not more, and I just want to have the time to really sit with it and work things out.”\n\nWas there a straw that broke the camel’s back?\n\n“No, there wasn’t. There was a growing sense since the last general election, and it’s just exhausting covering everything. I think there comes a point when\n\nyou think, I’ve been doing this since\n\n2010 and, of course, I did 10 years in the European Parliament before that. So it’s just about that sense that now’s a good time to take stock”.\n\nIs it that sense that it’s too early for retirement, that there’s still energy for another big adventure, the idea that life is a series of chapters.\n\n“I do feel that. Exactly that, and actually, one of the things that I’ve been doing in recent months is working with a wonderful organisation called Living\n\nWell Dying Well, based in Lewes. They train you to be somebody who accompanies people at the end of life, an end of\n\nlife doula, and in a way, some of that work, I suppose it’s slightly fed into the decision as well. In the sense of thinking that life’s short and one wants to make the most of it.”\n\nWhen you look back, what’s the thing you’re most proud of?\n\n“One of the things I’m really proud of is introducing a new GCSE in natural history. That might sound a bit obscure but I am passionate about our young people having as much access to nature that they can. I’m very influenced by something that an American writer, Richard Louv, said ‘We won’t protect what we don’t love. And we won’t love what we don’t know. And we won’t know what we don’t have access to and smell and touch and feel’.\n\n“So it’s about making sure our young people have access to nature and understand it and learn to love it. It happens in many primary schools that have fantastic eco clubs and their own allotments and more – then you get to secondary school, and suddenly there’s no time left for that, everything closes down.”\n\nDo you retain optimism?\n\n“There’s another American writer, Rebecca Solnit, who makes a wonderful distinction between hope and optimism.\n\nShe says unlike optimism, which can sometimes mean that you’re blindly optimistic and can mean you might feel like you’re just sitting there holding your lottery ticket – hope is different. Hope is like an axe that breaks down doors in an emergency. Hope is what gets you out of bed, knowing that you have to do something, even if you don’t know what the outcome is going to be. Hope gives you the vision and the commitment to go and break down those doors for a better future. So I have that.\n\nI have that hope. I don’t have optimism in the sense that I think that if we just hang on tight, it’ll all come right. I mean, I think anyone who thinks that given the situation we’re in right now…” Her voice trails off, probably hoping we can talk about something else.\n\nOutside of politics , what makes your heart sing?\n\n“Walking the dog on the downs.”\n\nWho’s your dog?\n\n“He’s called Harry and he’s mostly Labrador, but he has something in him that makes him jump very high. And when you take him off the lead and the way he shoots, you can just feel his glee and joy – and that makes me feel full of joy as well”.\n\n“Can I have a black Americano, a couple of slices of sourdough and the smoked salmon”.\n\n“Of course,” said the mildly distracted student working the till. “And would that be interest only or repayment?”\n\nCafé culture. I love café culture. I grew up on tales of Parisian cafés and Satre, Soho and films like Expresso Bongo. I got married in a café. The rise in café culture is one of the biggest changes in our world in the last 30 years, so much so that one of the best loved jokes in our neighbourhood goes like this.\n\n“Look, there’s an empty shop. What it’s going to be?”\n\n“A café!”\n\nIt’s a cracking joke, never fails. But it’s easy to forget that life wasn’t always like this. Once upon a time, when I was a young buck about town, getting a decent cup of coffee was a bit of a mission. Back then, I lived in London, and there were maybe half a dozen places you could go to get a decent cup. There were the famous names like Bar Italia, the Portuguese on Goldhawk Rd, Café Delancey in Camden (where I got married) and precious few others. There was a place upstairs on Portobello and one opposite the Donmar in Seven Dials.\n\nNow we’re in a different Seven Dials, and the reason I’m thinking about coffee and cafés is that there’s been a fair storm brewing in our ‘hood about a new coffee shop opening. I was thinking about trying to shoehorn something about ‘blowing a gale’, but… already the gag’s having to work too hard.\n\nGail’s Bakery is opening a new branch on the corner where there was recently Night Shift and before that Small Batch, and it’s all gone a bit net curtain twitcher. Some wag with a spray can has had his funny half-hour. A grafitti penis? Really. A grafitti penis and the word “Boring”. Move over Banksy, there’s a new kid in town.\n\nThe Community Facebook page went full of “We don’t need another café. What we need is a shoe shop” type posts, and in fairness, who doesn’t like shoe shops? But anyway, as I said, I kinda like cafés and if there’s another café, that’s OK. And if it’s good, that’s also OK.\n\nBecause we’re professionals, the esteemed Food Editor and I decided to try Gail’s and as the Dials branch isn’t open yet – it’s “opening soon” – we went to the North Road branch for breakfast. And very nice it was too. She had a latte and avocado with salsa verde on toast. I had a black Americano, and a couple of slices of toast – sourdough, obvs – and butter. I was going to have the smoked salmon, but there were tax implications. Toast is fine. £17.\n\nCafé culture is like this now. It’s gone kinda posh – we’re a long way from the world of Bongo Herbert (the Cliff Richard character from Expresso Bongo). This morning, like most mornings, I went to the Flour Pot. I love the Flour Pot, but it’s one of the main reasons why I haven’t taken early retirement. Two loaves, a dozen eggs and two croissants. £19.80.\n\nMaybe it’s best to look at it like this. We bang on here quite a lot about climate and the environment and all that – hopefully you’ve noticed – and if it costs a bit more to have food that’s properly produced, made from animals that are properly kept, well that’s what happens. You can’t have your climate conscience and your environment conscience and treat animals well and still have a chicken that costs £2. Bogoff. Can’t happen. It costs a bit more, so you pay your – OK, considerable – money and you make your choice. If the price of a cheap bacon sarnie is a pig in a cage it can’t move in, then I don’t want that bacon sarnie. If your flat white is made with milk from a cow whose kid has been ripped from her and who’s never seen daylight, then I don’t want that flat white. It’s straightforward.\n\nActually, I’m not entirely sure the negative chat is because it’s a café. I’m not even sure it’s because of the prices. I kinda suspect it’s because there’s an idea that it’s corporate. “There’s a Gail’s in Hove! And in the North Laine!! It’s a chain! It’s a chain!!” It’s a bit knee-jerk, this idea that if it’s a chain it must be corporate and if it’s corporate it must be bad. Well, I’m not sure life’s that simple, and as our esteemed Food Editor finds out on page 8, Gail’s is actually on the side of the angels. To mis-quote Al Gore – and doesn’t he seem a long time ago now – it’s an inconvenient truth.\n\nThere’s a bit of a coffee theme in this issue. On page 6, there’s a feature on how a couple of fantastically clever people are using used coffee to create beautiful kitchen worktops and furniture. They’re lovely people, they make really beautiful stuff, it’s all recycled. It’s a really cool story. There’s not a lot not to like. And we’ve got an exclusive – well, it’s not really exclusive, but it’s what journalists say – interview with our outgoing MP, Caroline Lucas.\n\nIn other news, the new puppies – I know that’s what you’re really interested in – have settled in perfectly. Can’t imagine life without them.\n\nAs the line up for this year’s Festival is unveiled,\n\nour Arts Correspondent picks her hot tickets\n\n“The whole city is like a thought experiment” said Frank Cottrell-Boyce, this year’s Guest Director at the launch event for the Brighton Festival, as he explained why he loves Brighton. He spoke about rebellion, and that “people tend to run away to Brighton’, and gave a glimpse of the Festival to come when he claimed that “we need some hope” and that Brighton is one of the few places that “Looks to the future”.\n\nThe Festival launch began with a performance from the Carnival Collective – “30 years and still banging” as they say – who appeared onstage with drums and blue and pink sparkling outfits. As the familiar rhythmic sounds began, I was transported to a high energy vision of the event itself. The Collective director was pointing towards the crowd, with people laughing and cheering as the second song began and it was hard not to move along with him, swaying backwards and forwards in my seat in time with the beat.\n\nAfter, there are a few speeches however the most notable was Brighton Councils leader, Bella Sankey who talked about visiting Brighton Festival as a child and words were being thrown around such as “Eclectic Celebration” and “Great Showcase”.\n\nCottrell-Boyce and Nadia Shireen, fellow children’s author and co-presenter of their hit podcast “The Island of Brilliance” took to the stage and introduced three of their favorite acts that will feature in the Festival: “The Perfect Show for Rachel”, “Carnesky’s Showwomxn Sideshow Spectacular” and “The Brighton Table Tennis Club”.\n\n“The Perfect Show for Rachel” is a show controlled fully by Rachel who is a theatre loving, 33-year-old, disabled care home resident and sister to Flo who is the artistic director for Zoo Co & Improbable. The show was developed with Rachel to create a show on her own terms. As explained by Flo on stage, Rachel has her own custom built tech booth which she uses to control what happens on stage at certain times. This show, which received a five-star rating from The Guardian, is definitely a must-see.\n\n“Carnesky’s Showwomxn Sideshow Spectacular” Is an outdoor circus, theatre event that comes from the imagination of award-winning performance maker Marisa Carnesky. The show is made-up of a queer, non-binary and female cast who will perform stunts, tell stories and wow us with their skills. The show’s inspiration comes from the heritage of British working-class female circus performers and is, they say, a perfect representation of colorful and weird and wonderful Brighton.\n\n“The Brighton Table Tennis Club” – that is, the real Brighton Table Tennis Club based at the Fitz in Kemptown – explained how they plan to break the world record for the most consecutive different players in one game of table tennis. This free event seems to be jam packed with several activities including a mega table built up of several normal sized tables and an opportunity to watch paralympic gold medalist Will Bayley.\n\nI am particularly looking forward to:\n\nTHE CHILDREN’S PARADE: For all ages, The Children’s Parade is a must see.

You’d be more likely to find her rummaging through a jumble sale than a rumbling round the playground, and for little Vanessa easily the best sweet shop was a haberdasher. A career in social work and a family followed alongside a move to Brighton, and as she walked the streets of her new home she would wonder every time a new shop came up for rent why someone didn’t open an old-school dress agency like the ones she grew up around. Until one day….\n\n‘Preloved of Brighton’ opened its doors 10 years ago – with its stylish owner ever present to hear how you are, what gigs you’ve been to, what exhibitions have impressed you as well as what you are looking for clothes-wise. Never pushy, always happy for you just to check out any new additions (her stock updates daily with new contributions) Vanessa’s edge is curating her store like a boutique. The jeans are all in one place, the sizes separated up, the sparkly clothes for events and Christmas presented together. Shoes, bags, belts dotted around, there’s even a £10 rail – very worth a rummage for a bargain. And crucially she knows her customers and the fashion zeitgeist so well. There’s no point trying to get her to sell your skinny jeans if wide and cropped is what’s happening at the moment.. she knows what will sell and it’s what makes people happy. Her lovely shop has gone from strength to strength with so many following suit – the market for vintage having massively expanded, and apps like Depop and Vinted giving new life to old clothes. I see my younger son in someone’s old French-blue Ralph Lauren hoody he’s found on line and snagged for a steal and know that for him it delivers that spark – it’s new to him.\n\nWhen Preloved started it was the only place of its kind here – chic and thoughtfully stocked with people’s preloved clothing – splitting the proceeds 50/50 with the people who bring her their treasures. And so often for Vanessa the real treasure is in the stories of the clothes, the connection to her customers and the lives that they have lived.\n\nInitially her clientele was probably between 30 and 60 years old, but now Vanessa reckons it’s more like 15 to 80, and this is so much down to the atmosphere that she’s created. She believes clothes aren’t ‘just’ clothes; they are key to how you feel. Her warmth and interest in the people who come in and their stories wraps you up like a friendly hug. I can’t think of a time I’ve visited when there hasn’t been a lovely chat or a serendipitous exchange of information. I’ve even found a physiotherapist who knows about knees whilst in the shop with Vanessa literally getting on the floor and showing me the best joint exercises to do.\n\nWhat gets her up in the morning is a real mission to change people’s minds about buying all their clothes new – it truly makes her day if even one person makes a decision to buy vintage and feels great in it.\n\nAnd it’s because of pioneers like Vanessa that I’ve started asking those questions I’d never asked myself – what really do I wear that makes me feel properly myself? The answer is a very limited list, truly.\n\nThis year my husband and I have had a pact to buy no new clothes and it’s been HARD.\n\nThe biggest test of our ‘nothing new’ pact came in the form of a wedding and our oldest son’s graduation. Could I ever feel ‘dressed up’ wearing something ‘old’ to events like that?. Hovering over the ‘add to basket’ on the Cos website too many times, I headed up to Preloved. There was Vanessa, the shop lit up by the early summer sunshine and her smile, a lovely scent filling the air from an aromatic little steamer on her desk. Behind her, hanging up waiting to go on the rails, was a bright orange and pink summer dress, long length, short sleeves, two layers of cotton. ‘I’d never wear that it’s just not my thing’, I thought and dismissed it immediately. Vanessa held it up. “Why don’t you try it, Ceri? it’s a good length for you”. So I did. And when I opened the curtain Vanessa said “Look at that smile!”. I felt fantastic. Worried that my idea of pairing it with my dark blue clutch bag would ‘kill the dress’ (she has a very, very good fashion eye) Vanessa found a gold and orange one and that was that. For £40 I had an outfit that made me feel a million dollars.\n\nPeople like Vanessa and their passion for design, designers, textiles and stories really do make the world go round. She’s recently launched a ‘what are you looking for?’ service and she also uses her Instagram presence to promote other local business generously. It’s from her that I really do understand that new doesn’t have to be ‘brand’-new. It can be new to ME. And that not only has to be good enough it’s just plain great.\n\nChanging the Game: How Brighton’s companies are leading the way to a greener future. Gilly Smith reports\n\nI’m waiting for Ella Byass from Marketing at the new Red Roaster restaurant in New Road on a warm afternoon in November. The nice young waiter asks me where I’d like to sit, and I choose the quieter terrace outside as I’m about to record Ella’s interview. He fiddles with a remote and pops off to get my coffee. He’s turned the heating on. Outside.\n\nIt’s not a great start to an interview about Red Roaster’s hard-won battle for B Corp, the global accreditation that aims to shift the behaviour, structure and very culture of capitalism by exacting excellence in every inch of a business. As Ella tells me that they’re one of just 7000 companies in the world to be given its stamp of approval after its rigorous three-year assessment process, I’m still trying to square the heater issue.\n\nRed Roaster has been one of Brighton’s most sustainable companies for years; its coffee roastery in Kemp Town is the only organic coffee roastery in the South East, and its beachfront café, Lucky Beach which won the Food Made Good People’s Favourite Restaurant award in partnership with delicious. Magazine in 2017, has been collecting gongs ever since.\n\nMembership of the Sustainable Restaurant Association keeps the company focussed on sourcing responsibly, which includes supporting farmers who employ good animal husbandry and contribute positively to carbon capture with regenerative farming techniques to keep the soil healthy. The SRA keeps its members up to date on how best to trade, use energy and keep its carbon footprint low, but also how to interact with the community and treat its teams.\n\nIn Brighton, they’ve switched all of their delivery vehicles to electric or bikes, and are the largest employer of learning-disabled adults in Brighton. Ella tells me that 75% of their produce for their Brighton cafes are sourced locally; its cider comes from Whistler favourite, Trenchmore Farm which operates its own micro circular economy. Its organic eggs are from Rookery Farm in West Sussex and most of its seasonal produce are from Shrub Provisions, one of the increasing numbers of sustainable food hubs working with regenerative or organic local farms for next day delivery to restaurants. And where it can’t buy local, it supports the farmers’ own communities; Red Roaster’s coffee beans come from Brazil, Honduras and most notably from Rwanda where they run most of their social projects, including building schools and medical centres.\n\nLed by early sustainability adopters, Diana and Mike Palmer, Red Roaster’s B Corp badge is only the beginning. “With B Corp, you have to constantly show how you’re improving” Ella tells me. “They’ll come back in three years’ time and say, ‘Right, this is was great three years ago, but what have you done since?’ We can’t just be like, great, we’ve got the B Corp. They’ll want to know how we’ve reduced our carbon footprint even further. They don’t allow you to use it as a green washing technique.”\n\nAs businesses try to attract and retain late millennials and Gen Z into a post Lockdown workplace where all the rules have been thrown out of the pram, sustainability is one of the most popular keywords in the search for employment. According to the Institute for Advertising Ethics, 64% of millennials will no longer work for a company that fails to show a strong corporate social responsibility. The data also shows that Gen Z are so concerned about what their peers think of their employers, that their choices are increasingly those that can prove they’re doing the right thing.\n\nIt’s an amazing story, but how will anyone know while the only connection the customer has is with a waiter who turns an outdoor heater on without even asking? Ok, so it turns out that the heaters are solar powered, but the point is how would we know? A brunch with a mate a couple of days after our interview revealed the waitresses weren’t acquainted with the company line either, and the bacon was from Ireland.\n\n“Our sustainability story is on the menu”, Ella tells me. Now, come on; who salivates over the food options, ponders over the cocktails and then scrolls through to the last page to read the diversity pledge? We’re Whistling big time for Red Roaster, but maybe by the time the B Corp team come back to check, their waiters will be wearing the t-shirt.\n\nOf the tiny clutch of B Corp companies in the world, we’ve got quite a handful in Brighton. And if you’re thinking about booking your next holiday, you might like to know that one of them is a sustainable travel company which says that it’s not really very cool to fly at all. “There is no denying the fact that if you fly long haul, it will make up a very, very significant proportion of your year’s carbon footprint,” says Nick Pulley, founder of Selective Asia. You’re not even going to get a virtue signalling offset plan as part of the cost of your flight at Selective Asia. “With an increasing number of reports casting doubt on the benefits of carbon mitigation, we don’t have the necessary clarity and confidence on this approach that we would ideally like,” proclaims the website.\n\nInstead, the travel agency works with Brighton-based carbon calculating company, C-Level which works directly with environmental scientists and communities on the front line of climate change to develop conservation projects that can provide locals with an income. This is not so much about mitigating the impact of travel, but actively supporting local economies to thrive. Call it distribution of wealth.\n\n“Travelling with a tour operator like us means introducing clients properly to the cultures and steering them away from the heavy footfall area”, says Nick. Encouraging them to eat on the streets and in family-run restaurants rather than in the larger hotels means shaking the hands that feeds, while keeping the tourist spend local. Travelling in-country by train not only avoids the carbon heavy short hop flights, but gives the traveller a chance to see the landscape and feel the distance.\n\nEco-tourism is about understanding impact, and we’ve got to stop flying if we’re to save the planet. But if you’ve just got to make that trip of a lifetime, make sure it helps to secure the D’ering-Dibru Saikhowa Elephant Corridor in the northeast Indian states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh or support Lone Buffalo, the Laos community project giving free English tuition, sport and creative skills tutoring to local kids.\n\nThe last time I cooked for Lee Marvin, we ate snake. I was sceptical. He was adamant. As ever he was right, the reptile was excellent. But then it would have to be, if it were to be cooked for one of the greatest men of the 20th century. Actor, lover, fighter. Man of action. Man of few words.\n\nEvery man alive, without exception, secretly wishes he were Lee Marvin.\n\nThe day I cooked for him, we were riding the sierra that ran through his ranch. He was an incomparable caballero. He could do anything on a horse. He taught me to ride and whilst I can handle myself, I will never come close to his horsemanship.\n\nWe had started at dawn, after a breakfast of beans and coffee and stopped every so often, dropping from our horses, fully clothed, into the cool, clear water that pooled in the bends of the creeks we passed. It helped wash away the sweat of the long riding and nights of heavy drinking under stars that were engaged in celestial shootouts.\n\nThe sun was getting low in the sky and I watched as he leaned down out of his saddle, fully extended his arm and picked up a stone the size of a wolf’s testicle. He hoisted himself back up and twisted round and threw the stone straight at me.\n\nLuckily, he wasn’t actually aiming at me. He was aiming at a snake in a tree we were passing. A diamondback, he told me later.\n\nNasty snake, bad bite – was how he put it.\n\nHe hit the snake fully on the head and killed it outright.\n\nHe drew to a halt and dismounted, walked over and toed the inert, defunct mother of all sin. As soon as the boot made contact with the snake, it sprang back into action. Not to back life, just action. It was writhing and convulsing but he simply pinned the snake to the ground just behind its head with his boot. He slowly withdrew a knife from within his clothes, crouched down and cut the snake’s head off.\n\nHe lifted his boot but it still jumped and writhed. It reminded me of the way chickens run around when decapitated, seemingly trying to escape the end that they had already met. He picked it up, put it into a sack.\n\n‘Sorry kid, you’re cooking,’ he said, handing me the sack.\n\nAn hour later, we made camp next to the creek and I began to get ready for the night – a night with Lee Marvin was never predictable and was often quite hard work. Particularly the next day.\n\nI waded into the water and removed the snake from its sack. I was fairly appalled to see that it was still moving. Not so vigorously, but writhing nonetheless. I took out my knife and made a small cut in its skin, enough to be able to peel it back. I bit down on the fleshy, bony stump where the head used to be and pulled the skin off its body. Still the creature writhed, but slowly now, like a dancer using his arms to pretend to be a snake.\n\nI washed the skin before turning it back, right side out. When I had finished I hung it to dry from the limb of a tree that was overhanging the river. I still have the snakeskin. I keep it on the dashboard of my car. I then washed the snake in the cold water. Finally it was inert, a good couple of hours after its death.\n\nI walked back up to the fire wondering how I was going to grill it, when I saw him coming towards me with the branch of a tree, cutting away its limbs. What now? I thought and took a step back. But all he did was to take the snake from me and lay the two things alongside each other, near the fire.\n\n‘Wait,’ he said, and disappeared into the woods.\n\nSo I waited. It started a couple of minutes after he reappeared carrying a bundle of leafy oak cuttings. “It” was the unaided union of the snake and stick. Right there on the ground by the fire, the snake began to move once again. It twisted its rattle around the end of the stick and curled and rolled until it was completely corkscrewed around the stick’s length.\n\n‘Shit,’ I said.\n\n‘Yep,’ he said, and threw the cuttings on to the fire.\n\nHe sat with his arm out straight, holding the weird snakestick in the smoke just above the heat, whilst he went into a monologue at full volume about a night’s drinking with Bob Mitchum and some French sex workers, only he didn’t call them that, in a town he claimed had been liberated by the two them at the end of the war.\n\nHe talked for half an hour without pausing, without even seeming to draw breath, all the while feeding the smoke and holding the snakestick in it. He finished up by saying ‘Okay, now you,’ and he handed it to me.\n\nI poked about in the embers until I had them nice and white with a red glow beneath. I put two rocks about a foot apart in the fire and laid the snake across them, turning it every minute or so. Juices dripped on to the embers and hissed.\n\nIts flesh, a pinkish white to begin with, had now turned a beautiful, golden brown. It smelled good.\n\nI pulled the stick out of the long coil and cut it into two halves and we ate.\n\nSnake is just one long spine and ribs so it can be tricky to eat if it’s thin. But this was a diamondback and about four foot long and weighing five pounds or so. We could pull off whole hunks with our teeth. It was young so its flesh was reasonably tender for a creature that is all muscle.\n\nI sat chewing, thinking about its flavour. It tasted like mackerel. And we were about 400 miles from the sea.\n\nMr Marvin liked it. He didn’t say as much. In fact he didn’t say anything. I could just tell he was enjoying it. Every now and then he would shake a few drops of Tabasco onto his next mouthful and chew it slowly.\n\nHe wiped his mouth with his sleeve as the last mouthful went down. ‘Right, I’m ready.’\n\nThe sun had gone down.\n\nAnd the drinking began.\n\nYou can find Matthew Marke’s killings every Tuesday at matthewmarke.substack.com\n\nAt 6am on a bright sunny morning in late May this year, I joined a gathering of excited Brightonians in the line to try out the water at the new Sea Lanes for the first time. I left an hour later slightly astonished. Looking around like Alice in Wonderland at the setting I had to pinch myself.\n\nWhen we first moved ‘down from London’ seven years ago, I insisted that I had to be able to see the sea from the house. I thought that I would buy a wet suit and a dry robe and immediately morph into a near-fish-person at one with the ocean I’d made my neighbour. I would be one of Brighton’s swimmers. That didn’t happen. Instead as a freelancer trying to work, commute, settle our family in, sort out our damp and crumbling house, the years passed… I never did get that dry robe (Ed: quite right too)\n\nBubbling along since we arrived has been this talk of a beach pool down at Black Rock – a regeneration project around the old Peter Pan Park on Madeira Drive. It wasn’t an area of Brighton we often went to. For us, it was a case of turning right at the sea, walking to Hove Lawns or further along, with our dog and our kids and friends.\n\nPlanning issues seemed to dog the project. Every so often there’d be word that there were plans. There would be the odd mention in the paper. Then… nothing. Would it ever happen? Nay-sayers galore doubted it. And then in 2021 after vast negotiations with the council and local heritage and resident groups, the plan got its permission. It turns out that surely and steadily the main players with the vision for the pool were working away to make this dream come true.\n\nImmense challenges to the building process itself were an ongoing battle none of us knew about.\n\nWhile we all were grumbling because well you know, it’ll never happen, it’s pie in the sky, good things like this never come off – the project team dealt quietly with the delicate removal of huge concrete slabs, ever so gently so as not to de-stablise the terraces, issues with materials for the carbon-neutral structures (pandemic legacy too) and terrible weather conditions – all huge hurdles to the build. The changing rooms are made of materials that come from unrecyclable plastics like toys, make up, flip flops, bottle tops… and they have tried to ensure the place is future proofed too – when hydrogen power arrives, the Sea Lanes can switch, everything is in place. And it’s a triumph.\n\nThe National Open Water Centre – aka, The Sea Lanes – conceived as “a stepping stone into the sea” has for the past three months never failed to deliver pure joy. The water sparkles and welcomes you in from 6am to 9.30pm during the week, a little earlier closing time on weekends. . And when it’s stormy, the water whips up little choppy waves to remind you where you are and make you work a little harder.\n\nWhen you stand in those changing rooms the stickers telling you about the fact that they’ve used stuff generally headed for land-fill to make the doors and benches is somehow incredibly reassuring. Big smiles are exchanged, little chats about the water temperature (it’s been matching the sea all summer and will be between 15 and 19 degrees in the winter) and where someone got their wet suit… “What will you wear in the Winter?” “Do you have a spare hat I can borrow?” “Have you seen my new heads-up-display goggles?” “The wind’s up today, it’s a real work out in there!” “The water’s crisp this morning!” “This place makes me happy”.\n\nI think we recognise each other now by our tattoos or our hats – these became mandatory (hats not tattoos but I’m considering a fish one since you ask) in August and after a few furrowed brows I think really no-one cares. It’s kind of nice. I put on my swimming hat and I feel even more in character as the Brighton swimmer of my dreams.\n\n-Hat-Guy said “Hello” this morning. “Not seen you for a while, I always know you by your tattoos! Everything OK?” “Yes”, I said, “just been in Cornwall for the weekend”. And off we swim.\n\nThere are lockers and showers beach side that are free for sea swimmers to use and there’s a smooth pathway to the sea to walk down without suffering Brighton’s pebble agony. You can always buy some water shoes at the lovely Paddle People shop and a coffee from Fika afterwards. Pop up to Photomatic for a picture to take home or investigate the myriad gym, yoga, sports massage, fitness outfits that have set up shop inside the 27 carbon neutral units. There’s even a little ice-cream parlour. It’s the home of swim-adventurers “Swim Trek” who offer an ‘endless pool’ approach to swim technique training, where you swim, resistance style, on the spot while an instructor shows you to adjust your technique and breathing til you able in the big pool.\n\nI did those very same lessons when I realised that in order to be that swimmer I’d always hoped to be I HAD to learn to crawl because… The other thing about the pool is you quickly realise 50 meters is BIG. Now I can swim a daily kilometer freestyle easiy. It’s really ALL about the breathing. Isn’t everything?\n\nWhat had been imagined as a bright and colourfully decorated complex initially has been realised – post public consultations – with a more muted colour-palette to better compliment its setting against the terraces of Madeira Drive. A good decision, I think, when you stand and look at it. And that’s often what I do. I stand on Madeira drive and marvel at this lively, vibrant, positive, hope-filled place. The colour is brought to the place by the busy-ness of the businesses, the happy people waiting for coffee, breakfast, lunches or a beer in the evening sunshine. Dogs, stand up paddleboards, runners, walkers, kids, kites, bikes and yes, brightly colour swimming robes. Possibly also dogs-in-swim-robes.\n\n“Yellow Wave” started it with their lovely beach volleyball set up and fab café but Sea Lanes pool and it’s village are the cherry on the cake. It’s a world class undertaking, you feel like Brighton is really showing off. Loving its beach, loving its seaside setting, loving its people actually and delivering aspiration that’s achievable. Grumblers say it’s just another members club – it really isn’t though! You can swim as a non-member but it just makes sense to join – like I did at my local pool. It’s just a few pounds more and a million miles away in terms of spiritually delivering just what I need. They even run a monthly beach-clean with a free coffee at the end of it. People are starting to gather here and we all need this as a community of human beings, places to gather that make us feeling hopeful.\n\nThe water ALWAYS lifts my spirits – get into the blue to shake off the blues I always say to myself – it connects me to not only myself, my ability in the water, my sense of strength and presence but to the other smiling people I share the pool with. And that is more important now than ever it was.\n\nThere’s now a reason to turn left at the pier.\n\nI think we recognise each other now by our tattoos or our hats – these became mandatory (hats not tattoos but I’m considering a fish one since you ask) in August and after a few furrowed brows I think really no-one cares.
