        "text": "These WHISTLER movies are fascinating - based on the popular radio show from the 1940s - almost all of them starring Richard Dix as a different character each time (and many of them directed by a young William Castle). The movies are short (around 60 mins each) and have a Twilight Zone Or Alfred Hitchcock Presents kind of vibe. This one could be fun to remake. In this case, Dix plays a man who gets hit by a car (just a glancing blow to the head) and loses his memory. A kindly stranger woman sees him in a bar and reads his fortune with a deck of playing cards. Two times in a row the cards indicate he will die…\n\nA man loses his memory, and with the aid of kind Samaritan sisters, they try to reconstruct his identity using the various scraps of paper and other items in his pockets. I love mysteries that also play as if they are point and click adventure games, where each item has some significance and you're going to need to keep it in your inventory to solve the crime. The girls, played by Janis Carter and Jeff Donnell, are fabulous (yes - Jeff is a girl's name, and she's adorable). While they are piecing together his identity he's also leaving a trail of dead animals in his wake. At one point, he chats with a little girl, buys her ice cream, and…\n\nA young woman takes pity on a man who has taken a knock on the head, and lost his memory, and, along with her sister, tries to discover his identity thanks to various items found in the pockets of his suit.\n\nThis second Whistler movie sees the return of Richard Dix, although in a completely different role from the first film, although as the amnesiac you can't say that he is the lead character, which falls more to Janis Carter, as Patricia, who takes pity on him.\n\nAlthough it's an interesting way of achieving some continuity, given that the title character is no more than a shadow overseeing events, Dix is distractingly wrong for the role of a man who…\n\nThe third film in the series saw Lew Landers filing in for William Castle and he at least manages to turn in a fast-paced film but the screenplay is certainly a letdown. Richard Dix returns in a role playing an amnesiac man and Janis Carter the woman trying to help him regain his memory.\n\nTHE POWER OF THE WHISTLER is certainly a step down from the first two films in the series but there's enough entertainment here to make it worth watching. Believe it or not, the biggest problem with the film is that there's too much story and there's just too much happening. Before long it just feels like a lot of padding and you just stop caring about…"
