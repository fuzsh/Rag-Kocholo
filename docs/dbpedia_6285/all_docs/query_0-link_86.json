        "text": "Richard Dix. Adapted from the acclaimed radio serial, this Columbia Pictures series of noir mysteries each feature an omniscient narrator called \"The Whistler,\" introducing each story with his characteristic whistle. As he narrates, the action unfolds: each film a different and independent noir tale, with the first six all having protagonists played by Richard Dix. Guilty widowers, bloodthirsty convicts, opportunistic drifters and more populate the dark streets of these grim tales. Includes The Whistler (Gloria Stuart. 1944/59 min), The Power of the Whistler (Janis Carter. 1945/66 min), Voice of the Whistler (Lynn Merrick. 1945/60 min), Mysterious Intruder (Nina Vale. 1946/61 min), Secret of the Whistler (Leslie Brooks. 1946/65 min), The Thirteenth Hour (Karen Morley. 1947/65 min) and The Return of the Whistler (Michael Duane. 1948/60 min) on 2 DVDs. B&W/NR/fullscreen."
