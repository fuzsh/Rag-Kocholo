Here are the Canuck offerings on our can’t miss list:\n\nELLE Canada celebrates at the Whistler Film Festival\n\nAfter the Ball\n\nTake the basic premise of Cinderella, set it at a glossy magazine and you have this fun, frothy and fairy tale directed by Sean Garrity (of My Awkward Sexual Adventure fame).\n\nBang Bang Baby\n\nThis musical set in the 1960’s is equal parts Hairspray and Erin Brockovitch: It’s a about a teen with big dreams living in a tiny town with a nasty chemical secret.\n\nGALLERY: Celebrity portraits at the ELLE Canada Whistler photo suite\n\nBack Country\n\nWhat better time to watch a gripping horror movie about a violent bear attack than while surrounded by all the untamed wilderness of Whistler?\n\nTRAVEL: A weekend in Whistler\n\nA French Canadian Girl\n\nA quirky French language (with subtitles) short about what happens when a Torontonian man tries to help a Montrealaise find her lost laundry. (Spoiler: he falls hard.)"
