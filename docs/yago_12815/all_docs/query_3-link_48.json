        "text": "Actor and vocal director Jon Lutyens revisits Les Misérables to see that justice is done to Tom Hooper’s strange and ineffective directorial choices.\n\nTen Years Ago: Les Misérables\n\nBy Jon Lutyens\n\nAs I sat down to watch this film I saw once a decade ago, I gave myself a possibly insurmountable challenge: to approach this Les Misérables film on its own merits, independent of comparison with other performances of the story on screen or stage. Could I sing this score from downbeat to final curtain if you asked, yes. Could I write at length about the changes the writers and producers made in the decades since the musical premiered, also yes. Can I nevertheless put all that aside and watch this film on its own? I set out to see. I gave myself permission to consider the novel and how Tom Hooper and his cast tell Victor Hugo’s story but did my best to wrestle down all the Phillip Quast, Anthony Warlow, Judy Kuhn, Kaho Shimada, Michael Ball, and Colm Wilkinson living rent-free on a whole city block of gentrified tenements in my head. And so I pressed play.\n\nReader, as you may have guessed, I was not wholly successful. It doesn’t help that Colm Wilkinson not only echoes in the gently Irish diction of nearly anyone else’s performance of Jean Valjean, there he was giving shelter and benediction to Hugh Jackman. (And consciously undersinging? More on that below.) I truly love baton-handing casting choices, and this one was particularly beautiful, but it and several other familiar voices (Frances Ruffelle should work more) and faces (Hey there, Hannah Waddingham!) became momentary obstacles to my goal to let this film stand on its own feet, and either earn or steal its own bread. Taking a breath, and looking past those beautiful interruptives as much as possible, my overall reaction to the film a decade on is similar to many: It should have been better. And the buck stops at one person—but probably not the one most people think.\n\nVictor Hugo’s story is an unapologetic epic. These people live epic, if hugely coincidental, lives. These characters have been planted in our collective imaginations as fully as they appear on the page or the screen or the stage. They are George Bailey and Mr. Potter. They are Ebenezer and Tiny Tim. They are Dorothy Gale and the character now known as Elphaba. And with that familiarity comes room for them to be brought to breath in varying ways. Jean Valjean has been played by Orson Welles and Fredric March, Liam Neeson, and Gerard Depardieu. Fantine has let out her cri de coeur through Patti LuPone, Uma Thurman, and the beloved actors who lent their singing voices to Mulan, Belle, Pocahontas, and Jasmine. These are roles that have been well-trod and, in that scope, I need to acknowledge the elephant in the meme: Russell Crowe is not wrong for Javert, and his are not the feet at which this film’s lost potential lies.\n\nAfter decades of anticipation by fans, expectation by critics, and infatuation by theatre teens who were now grown up with expendable income, producers handed one of the most high-profile film epics to someone who had never seen the musical, whose primary directing experience was in television, and who was riding high on the success of one big night at the Oscars. Tom Hooper may have done strong work on other projects, but when packing his toolkit for this project, he essentially brought a total of four options to the table: epically grand but quite short CGI transition shots, tilted camera angles with unconventional framing, and the two which define this film’s overall tone—closeups that cut off at least part of the actor’s head, and chaotic, shaky short bursts of frames that move on before we have a chance to focus on anything in them. Did Tom Hooper have a falling out with everyone who can operate a Steadicam? Too much time in this film is spent either being shaken about like the Enterprise has been hit with a photon torpedo, or wanting to whisper to the actors that it’s okay to back up, we’ll still hear them. We are robbed of our ability to take in the truly excellent work of the film’s design team by both of these choices. The art and wardrobe departments created Hugo’s world of social injustice, clandestine romance, danger, and valor with everything they had (heavyhanded Gatsby-esque eye notwithstanding); then Tom Hooper said he would only rarely allow us to see anything other than the lead actors’ shoulders and faces. I wanted to see the epic nature of Victor Hugo’s masterwork brought to life on film in portraits and compositions, in frames that could be paintings by Delacroix or Goya, and instead we got the film equivalent of having every actor cross down center and sing their solo straight to the audience.\n\nTen years ago, we were excited to finally have a film of this musical that had sparked international resonance with its story of courage and redemption. We were thrilled that Hugh Jackman was playing Jean Valjean; we fell in love again with Anne Hathaway’s undeniable talents. Many theatre people immediately dismissed Russell Crowe’s whole performance based on the tone of his voice as captured on set, as readily as they swooned over the already-proven voices of Aaron Tveit and Samantha Barks. Ten years on, without the onus of decades of tours, concerts, dozens of cast albums played to the point of disintegration, and the encumbrance of a wagon’s weight of expectations and pressures, it’s easier to see that the playing field has always been more level than we gave them all credit for. Every actor in this film makes singing choices that would not work on stage, and they don’t always work in this film either. Every actor has moments of what feels like undersinging because they don’t need to reach further than the mic above their head and have presumably been directed to not sing past it. Every lead actor. Yes, Hugh Jackman. Of course, Russell Crowe. Yes, Anne Hathaway. Yes, even the patron saint of the film, Colm Wilkinson. Strangely, the only actors who escape this oddity of music direction are the one-scene featured roles, such as the Foreman who throws Fantine out of the factory. Michael Jibson (who won an Olivier for playing George III in the first London cast of Hamilton by the way) essentially says “Nope, this is my moment in the Les Misérables movie, and I’m going to sing this.” The same goes for many of the other passing features. I wish the lead actors were allowed to do the same. Aaron Tveit, Eddie Redmayne, and the rest of the rebels are saved a bit by having music which by its nature asks for a rhythmic pulse, but even their scenes are jarred by editing which rushes through moments when actions should land, or which cuts beats or measures out of a phrase for the sake of getting to the next vocal line. Whole songs with dramatic arcs are reduced to a single half-chorus and quickly segued on from. I would be fascinated to hear an uninhibited interview with Becky Bentham, the film’s music supervisor, for her thoughts on both the process and the product.\n\nTo be fair, not everything Tom Hooper did was preventative of what could have been. He and William Nicholson brought in moments and scenes from Hugo’s pages that the creative team for the stage musical left out. I loved reuniting with M. Fauchelevent in the convent, and the snow in Fantine’s quick scene with the execrable Bamatabois. Marius’ garret in the same building as the Thenardiers, and his restrictive grandfather (who sings now!) the Elephant of the Bastille, and Grantaire’s arrival upstairs to bring solidarity to Enjolras’ final moments. These are among the successful beautiful things from the novel that the stage musical left out (R.I.P. Azelma and M. Mabeuf) and which are brought to splendid life in this film. I am grateful that those swings weren’t missed. But what was missed in the chaos of quick shaky cuts, skipped beats in the music, and undersinging is the same as what is missed by having every solo in close-up shot: a sense of the bigger picture. Hooper opens the film with shots that bring to mind the grand Biblical epics of Cecil DeMille, then immediately forgets that’s what he’s supposed to be doing. Maybe Alan Parker could have kept the tone going, but Hooper gave it up except for MTV-edit bursts of patchwork storytelling.\n\nThe penultimate scene in the film is where we finally get to just sit with our actor at a respectable distance and listen to Hugh Jackman pray (and then the camera creeps in… stop it, Tom…) It’s one of the strongest scenes because the direction mostly doesn’t get in the way of the actor doing his job and telling us this story. When Anne Hathaway reappears, our hearts lift because maybe the two of them can hold off the zoom lens long enough to bring this movie home. And they and Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne do. And then after a final cameo from Colm Wilkinson, we pan out to a sunlit heaven place with a barricade, because when I think of an elysian afterlife, the first thing I think of is a massive wall of division and violence…? Out of all the chaos in this movie, there are moments of success and beauty, but overall, we wanted it to be better. We wanted Russell Crowe to be better. We wanted this story that reminded the world how to sing courage in the face of subjugation and imminent defeat to be better. Maybe we wanted too much. But it should have been better. Next time the money comes to make a feature film of this book or musical, I hope it is better.\n\nBut can we keep Marius commandeering a funeral horse and galloping down the Rue Saint-Denis, please?"
