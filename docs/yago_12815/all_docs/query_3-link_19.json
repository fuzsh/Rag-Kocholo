        "text": "London\n\nTHE mood was slightly tense in early June at Pinewood Studios here. “Les Misérables,” a film of the producer Cameron Mackintosh’s world-conquering musical, was being made, and there was a lot to worry about. Inside the Richard Attenborough Studio, which housed a cavernous, dung-smelling re-creation of a Paris street in the early 1800s, assistants called for silence as the director, Tom Hooper, peered intently at a bank of monitors. Hugh Jackman, in the role of the good-at-heart ex-convict Jean Valjean, was inside a carriage, his arm around 10-year-old Isabelle Allen, playing the young Cosette, whom he had rescued from her cruel guardians. Mr. Jackman was singing, over and over, the first lines of a new song, written for the film and being heard for the first time by most of the observers.\n\nOutside, where long cables snaked over the ground, Mr. Mackintosh was shouting, “I won’t have it!” at a stone-faced group seated around a small table.\n\nIt never became clear what Mr. Mackintosh wouldn’t have, but you might forgive him a little temper. When the film of “Les Misérables” opens Tuesday in the United States, with its Oscar-winning director, its all-star cast (Mr. Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen) and considerable buzz about its Oscar-winning potential, he will have waited some 25 years to see the musical migrate to the screen.\n\nIn 1987, soon after the show’s triumphant Broadway opening, it seemed like a sure thing. “The head of TriStar was mad keen to do it,” Mr. Mackintosh said last month in his opulent London office. “I wanted Alan Parker to direct it, and he agreed. We did a lot of work.”"
