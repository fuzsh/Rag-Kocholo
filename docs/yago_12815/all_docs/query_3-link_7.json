A policeman, Javert (Geoffrey Rush), who was a prison guard when Valjean was locked up, has a vendetta against him and tries to denounce him as a criminal despite a lack of evidence. Spanning several decades, the story of Javert and Valjean's rivalry is set against the backdrop of post-Revolution French society.",
