        "text": "There’s a canny point of view built into Ladj Ly’s first feature, “Les Misérables,” which opened in New York last Friday (and is one of the five Oscar nominees for Best International Feature). It’s a police story, with a difference. Damien Bonnard plays Stéphane, a police officer newly transferred from the provinces of France to a suburb of Paris called Montfermeil, which is home to many people of color, largely of African (both North African and sub-Saharan African) descent. Stéphane is white; he’s assigned to a patrol alongside a black officer named Gwada (Djibril Zonga) and led by another officer, Chris (Alexis Manenti), who’s also white. Their precinct captain (Jeanne Balibar) sends mixed messages, telling Stéphane that Chris is something of a cowboy in the streets—but that she tolerates no “inappropriate behavior.”\n\n“Les Misérables”—borrowing the title for today’s poor people of Montfermeil from Victor Hugo’s novel because he wrote it in that very town—tells a complex story, and tells it almost entirely from Stéphane’s point of view, showing its residents on their own, mainly in brief informational scenes that fill in plot points. It’s also a movie in which the elaborate setup isn’t merely indispensable to a discussion of the movie; it’s the very point—there’s very little psychology to the movie, very little personality bestowed upon its characters. Rather, the film proceeds like a virtual documentary, with the specifics of the plot providing factual discoveries from the perspective of a white officer, whose point of view stands in for that of a useful abstraction, the average white French person. That sense of discovery, of step-by-step unfolding of events in which the viewer is identified with an implicated participant who is also ignorant of the circumstances in which he’s forced to take action, is a dramatic doubling of the baseline conditions of French political and media life. It’s that shrewdly confrontational positioning that gives the film its immediacy, its passionate and diagnostic power—and one of the many quasi-documentary elements that the movie depicts is the behavior of the police itself.\n\nInappropriate behavior, Stéphane discovers, is exactly what Chris delivers from the moment that the three cops begin their patrol in and around housing projects in Montfermeil. Chris is a loose cannon: he refers to people he’s arrested as his “clients”; he harasses a fifteen-year-old girl at a bus stop with explicitly sexual threats and smashes the cell phone of her friend who’s recording him; he threatens to falsely accuse an ex-convict who’s an observant Muslim of collaborating with terrorists; he casually menaces residents with his power to inflict violence with impunity; and he leverages his power to benefit from petty bribery. When Stéphane—whom Chris nicknames Pento, a brand of hair cream, because of his naturally greasy hair (and that’s what he’s called throughout the film)—challenges Chris’s behavior, Chris responds by calling him a newbie with no standing and claims that only by such tough methods can the police gain the “respect” of the community. Of course, the opposite is the case: the officers are feared, hated, and seen as the front lines of an occupation force.\n\nThen comes a chance to do good: a lion cub has been stolen from a newly installed travelling circus; the proprietors, a tough group of Roma men, saw a black kid steal it and are threatening vigilante justice if the cub isn’t found and returned. Chris knows to track social media for a teen-age boast; he finds an image of the cub, held by a local teen named Issa (Issa Perica), and the trio trawl playgrounds and sandlots in search of him. But when they find Issa, he flees, and his large group of friends help him get away and resist the cops’ pursuit. In the resulting clamor, with the neighborhood kids—called the “microbes” by Chris—throwing rocks and debris at the police and the handcuffed Issa trying to flee again, one of the cops seriously injures him. The incident has been recorded by a child nicknamed Buzz (Al-Hassan Ly), who flies a drone camera, and the three cops, both fearing the possibility of a riot and fearing for their own reputations, conduct an extralegal chase of that kid.\n\nThe pursuit is double—an effort to get the kid (or, at least, his camera’s memory card) and an effort to conceal or dissemble Issa’s injuries. The quest takes the three policemen on frantic rounds through the neighborhood and brings to the fore a varied group of characters, including the town’s mayor (Steve Tientcheu), a black man whose power plays are cynical and apolitical; members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who play the role of mentors to young men, proselytizers, and vigilantes; Salah (Almamy Kanouté), the now devout ex-convict, who owns a kebab restaurant called Ali Boumaye, which is an unofficial seat of power and dispute resolution; and a drug dealer (Nizar Ben Fatma) who has an interest in keeping the neighborhood passive in order to keep the police away and his business thriving. In Ly’s depiction, the community is gender-divided; he depicts women largely as mothers, at home, struggling to keep their children outside the grasp of the police and their families on stable footing. (One very brief but memorable scene shows women of African descent gathered in a “tontine,” a private lending club.)\n\n“Les Misérables” depicts the residents of Montfermeil as living under an oppressive regime that treats them with brazen disrespect—and shows the practical effects, a mass-incarceration revolving door between prison and the streets, and also the emotional effects, a simmering rage that awaits just one incident in order to boil over into violence. The actions and attitudes of one abusive and contemptuous cop, namely, Chris, poison the actions of the trio—including of Gwada, who is himself of African descent and works hard to maintain civil and compassionate relations with the people of Montfermeil—and leads to an injury, compounded by a coverup, that threatens to turn to public protest or to a riot.\n\nA series of riots provides the movie with its historical context (one that’s expressly referred to, by Stéphane, in the course of the action)—one that took place in 2005, throughout France, after two adolescents, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré, from the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois, hid in an unmarked electrical substation when fleeing the police and were electrocuted. Three weeks of rage, in which government buildings and cars were burned and three people were killed, led to a state of emergency and thousands of arrests; it also led to more stringent anti-immigration measures. (The police were ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing.) The underlying premise of the adult characters in “Les Misérables”—Montfermeil residents and police officers alike—is that the danger that would result from unleashing the community’s anger is greater than the damage to the community from having its anger remain unacknowledged, its oppression unredressed.\n\nThe drama of “Les Misérables” is essentially a report—the story of Stéphane’s discovery of hateful abuse in a system in which he believes, his discovery of unaddressed frustration and overlooked anger among France’s nonwhite residents, and his recognition that his own work is partly, and significantly, responsible for that frustration and anger. On the other hand, by constructing the movie with a sense of quasi-factual discovery, Ly keeps Stéphane’s principles and concerns on the surface—Stéphane takes great risks to attempt to keep the peace and make the best of a bad situation, but what he knows and understands from his previous terms of police work is kept as rigorously outside the movie as any sense of conflicting principles that Gwada endures, or the lives and thoughts of Montfermeil’s residents outside the purview of police. (The few scenes of private life that the movie shows are merely anecdotal.) Though Ly sketches characters whose actions the movie follows, he doesn’t develop them. The people of Montfermeil are no less blank slates adorned with dramatically salient traits than are the police officers.\n\nLy grew up in Montfermeil, and his intimate knowledge of its social and physical terrain provides the movie with its urgent substance. Yet that substance is oddly shorn of history and culture; its merely plot-driven depictions of its residents converges with Ly’s merely functional direction, to flatten “Les Misérables” into the undistinguished style of conventionally apolitical and socially indifferent conventional crime dramas. For that matter, it plays conceptually like a détournement of such ordinary movies for a pressing political purpose. Its display, for the edification of white French people, of the abuses in which they’re obliviously complicit and the righteous anger that they arouse unawares is itself a psychological masterstroke. The film’s carefully constructed point of view only stands for realism; it’s a laboratory-like construction that isolates crucial phenomena and shows them to be both distinct and urgent. That analytical isolation comes at an artistic price. The response of Montfermeil’s oppressed and outraged young people arises in a sequence of intense drama that has the feeling of both a liberation and an apocalypse. It’s hectic, painful, thrilling, and symbolic—even if merely symbolic. Strangely, its symbolic power reflects back throughout the entire film to suggest what’s been missing."
