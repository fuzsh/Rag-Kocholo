The merciless police inspector Javert (Charles Vanel) hounds him, however, keeping Valjean on the run. After taking the neglected girl Cosette (Josseline Gael) under his wing, Valjean finds some degree of redemption, but things get more complicated when they meet the young revolutionary Marius (Jean Servais).",
