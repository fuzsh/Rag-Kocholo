        "text": "well, the good news is that Les Mis adaptations definitely can’t get worse than this, and I will never have to watch this again\n\nutterly iconoclastic!!!!\n\nI can say with absolute confidence that this screenwriter (or anyone involved with this film) didn’t actually read the book— this isn’t an adaptation of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables, it’s an adaptation of the garbage fire that is the 1935 American film, except this one features more garbage and more fire!—it incorporates a ton of weird elements from the already-messy 1935 film that have nothing to do with the novel, so we have gone from straying away from the source material to just completely losing the source material, resulting in a completely incoherent and…\n\nIt clearly says something about my memory but I can never remember the plot of Les Misérables. I've seen the musical on stage (a long time ago). I've seen the Hugh and Russell version. I've seen the Fredric and Charles version. But I can never recall much more than a nasty man pursuing a nice man. And a barricade at some point. Somehow I don't think that the Michael and Robert version is going to finally dispel the mists of my dodgy memory.\n\nThis is an uninspired stab at what has clearly become an inspirational text. Michael Rennie suffers insufferably throughout. He gives the same performance as the one I last saw him give, and since that was Saint Peter…\n\nSlick production of Victor Hugo's classic novel has Michael Rennie in the role of Jean Valjean and Robert Newton as the Inspector hounding him for decades.\n\nThis is only the second version of the novel that I've seen (the 1935 being the first) so it's hard for me to compare various versions but it's interesting some of the changes made here. Of course we get small changes like the amount of money owed Valjean after he's released from jail but the final chase through the sewers is changed a bit and some of the overall attitudes towards the two leads are also changed. I think these type of changes always make for an interesting viewing experience when it comes to…\n\nThis is the first version I saw of LES MISERABLES. It would have been on a weekend late afternoon television time slot, crammed into two-hours (so it probably had about 7-minutes snipped for commercials). I remember liking it a lot as a pre-teen, mostly because it starred Michael Rennie who was the lead in one of my favorite films, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. That’s really all that I could remember of it.\n\nToday, I picked up a “flipper” DVD with this version on one side, and the 1935 Charles Laughton version on the other. Under most circumstances, I would have opted for the 1935 version, but I really wanted to see the one that had so…\n\nJust search letterboxd, there are tons of adaptations of Les Mis that I'm sure are better than this one. This version has Sylvia Sidney though, and that's the only reason I can imagine you'd be watching it for.\n\nSylvia Sidney as Fantine is too perfect, whoever casted her probably felt so good about themselves. Well, I hope they at least gave themselves a pat on the back. Fantine, the most tragic character of all time, played by the world's best tragic actress. The reunion between Fantine and Cosette was so heartbreaking, when I tell you I sobbed.....\n\nI wish this adaptation showed more of Fantine, especially her life before being arrested by Javert. I can't lie, although I love this…\n\nBoy howdy, but isn't this one a prime example of what the Code did to film in the 40s & 50s. Less than 20 years after the Fredrick March version, and this feels like \"Disney's Victor Hugo.\" Sanitized and anesthetized. I'll give it this, though. The pacing was a bit better. Also, the finale was perhaps a bit more artistically shot. The rest of the movie? Looked like a TV drama. Things weren't really helped by Michael Rennie. It's clear that Rennie was \"of the theater.\" Like a lot of theater actors who made the switch to film in the 30s & 40s (and to TV in the 50s & 60s), he's playing to the back row. Would I love to hear him…"
