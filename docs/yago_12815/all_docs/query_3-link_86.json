        "text": "I donât remember why I never got around to watching the 1998 Les MisÃ©rables movie before â I was heavily into the musical at the time it was released (even subscribing to a fan newsletter and running my own fan website), and I was certainly aware of the film. It may have simply been a matter of âitâs not the musicalâ (or possibly âÃponine isnât in itâ).\n\nWhatever the reason, I never got around to watching it until now.\n\nOn one hand, I wish I had seen it at the time. On the other, I might have been more caught up in âAugh! Itâs different!â objections when I was younger. Iâm a lot more mellow about adaptation changes these days, except when they completely miss the point. Not that itâs hugely different, but there are some fairly major changes.\n\nItâs beautifully shot, some of it on location in Paris. Itâs as visually appealing as the Tom Hooper-directed 2012 musical (my review) â more so, when you factor in how gritty the 2012 version gets. (The sewers in this version must have been the cleanest in Europe. The sewers in the Hooper versionâ¦letâs jus say theyâre a bit more true to the sewers in the book.) Iâm not familiar with director Bille Augustâs work, but I see that he also directed The House and the Spirits - a movie that I remember thinking (at 18) was a dull waste of a great cast. Fortunately I never got that feeling here, though both are epics dealing with the intersection of family drama and political turmoil.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that the music was composed by Basil Poledouris, whose score for Conan the Barbarian is one of my favorites, but this score didnât make much of an impression.\n\nStory\n\nThis is another adaptation that focuses heavily on Jean Valjeanâs story, to the exclusion of everyone elseâs threads, in order to cram at least one complete story into a single movie. (The musical is unusual in that it actually treats the story as an ensemble piece.) Itâs not quite as extreme as the Jordan/Perkins version. Sure, it drops the ThÃ©nardiers once the action moves to Paris, and the rebellion seems to take about as long as the chase through the sewers. But Fantine and Cosette have more presence, and it does a much better job of setting up the revolutionaries and making it feel like they have their own story thatâs intersecting with Valjeanâs, even if you donât see much of it.\n\nThe acting is much moreâ¦human here than in the 1978 version, though it does suffer from not showing you at least a little of Valjeanâs backstory at the beginning.\n\nModernization\n\nI liked the way they tried to expand Fantineâs story, showing a little more of her slow descent into poverty and giving her and Valjean the beginnings of a relationship, cut short by the fact that sheâs dying. You can imagine the two of them raising Cosette together in a happier world.\n\nI also liked what they did with Cosette, giving her more agency and allowing some of the fire to burn that is tightly controlled by 1832 society in the book, and completely absent from the 1978 version (my review; she and Marius could both be replaced by cardboard cutouts). Sheâs the one who chooses to leave the convent, not Valjean. She demands answers from her fatherâ¦and gets them. She even convinces him to help Marius during the rebellion.\n\nMaybe it was just a way to give Uma Thurman and Claire Danes more to do, but I think it made for a better film. Though it did write them into a corner at the end. (Iâll get back to that later.)\n\nI was impressed that, 16 years ago, they took the bold step of making Enjolras blackâ¦until I saw that theyâd made him second in command. Way to throw away an opportunity.\n\nAlterations\n\nA lot of the changes to the story, particularly those that would have bothered me at 22, are clearly designed to raise the stakes of the drama. Jean Valjean actually strikes Bishop Myriel during the robbery. Javert actually witnesses the attack on Fantine (by three men, not just one), and arrests her when she fights back. Marius isnât a hanger-on with the revolutionaries, heâs their leader. And it isnât fear of Javert that prompts Valjean to leave Paris, itâs Javert showing up at his doorâ¦for, as it turns out, a completely unrelated reason: heâs trailing Marius. This leads to several scenes in which Javert and Cosette actually meetâ¦including a physical confrontation between Javert, Cosette, and Marius. (Javert needs to learn: you donât try to kidnap Liam Neesonâs daughter.)\n\nFor the most part, these changes work. But itâs baffling when they make changes that donât have any clear purpose, except maybe to make them easier for the English-speaking actors to pronounce, like changing names (Fauchelevent becomes Lafitte, and Montreuil-sur-Mer becomes Vigau).\n\nAnd then thereâs the fact that Valjean actually tells Cosette the whole truth during the insurrection. That makes the main conflict for the last 100 pages of the book impossible, which is probably why they just stop with Javertâs suicide. My wife and I watched as the credits rolled, and said to each other, âTheyâre leaving it here?â But the earlier change didnât leave them anywhere to go, except maybe the wedding.\n\nItâs the only way to honestly walk away with anything resembling a happy ending, but itâs also deeply unsatisfying."
