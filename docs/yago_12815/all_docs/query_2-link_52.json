        "text": "59 According to the counting of Willy Tappolet, Arthur Honegger, Fr. trans., forward by Alfred Cortot (ZÃ¼rich: Ãditions de la BaconniÃ¨re, 1954). Source: Archive S. M., Florence.\n\n60 Darius Milhaud, Notes sans musique (Paris: RenÃ© Julliard, 1949), p. 268. Source: Archive S. M., Florence. / âFor a long time the so-called symphonic composers were ostracized in film circles, and as a class rather looked down upon by film-producers in search of composers capable of writing music that would be both popular in appeal and a commercial proposition. Gradually the serious musicians managed to win their way into the studios by putting on false noses â that is, by disguising their music in a style calculated to earn the approval of fi lm-producers and directors. Once it had been proved that fi ne scores like Auricâs music for A nous la libertÃ© or Honeggerâs for Les MisÃ©rables could win popular success, these musiciansâ reputations were established and their services were much sought after.â D. Milhaud, Notes Without Music, trans. D. Evans, ed. R. Myers (New York: Da Capo Press, 1970), p. 240-241. [EN]\n\nSomething already known to scholars but worth to stress here anyway can be evinced by Milhaudâs witty remark: also European producers chose the composers as well as the impresarios did in XVIII-century musical theater. Whether or not a composer was hired anew depended upon how successful he had previously been. A director could suggest a name but the producer (with a few exceptions, not earlier than the 1950s) always had the last word. The more visible difference between North-American and European productive systems consisted in the way orchestration was handled. In fact, unlike Hollywood, in Europe it was left in the hands of the composer. Milhaudâs words sound less convincing when he puts Auric and Honegger on equal footing. This would mean that the music Auric composed for Ã nous la libertÃ© is the best music one could possibly think of for that extraordinary film by RenÃ© Clair (1931). Yet, that music â and the film itself â has nothing to do with the music Honegger composed for Les MisÃ©rables. Neither work needed to wear a âfaux-nezâ, simply because Auric was innately cinglant61 and oriented to the cabaret world, whereas Honegger was, likewise innately, a symphoniste. Moreover, Honegger had been working for more than ten years in some very important films in cinema history: e.g. Abel Ganceâs La Roue (1922) and NapolÃ©on (1927), and LâIdÃ©e (1934), an animated film by Berthold Bartosch, his best one in my opinion.62 For Les MisÃ©rables, as well as for other films of that prolific period, Honegger was assisted by Maurice Thiriet.63\n\nAt present, this adaptation of Les MisÃ©rables is undoubtedly one of the most impressive. First of all, I feel that the restoration gave one of the best results I know: the black and white contrast is very beautiful and noises in the soundtrack have been greatly attenuated. Two Blu-ray DVDs with 4K restoration (see technical features) were produced. The difference between the DVDs and the 3 VHS cassettes released before the filmâs restoration is abysmal. Yet, old technological devices have some charm despite their flaws being nowadays much more evident, but less dramatic. This version of Les MisÃ©rables is also very remarkable because it is one of the few films from the past whose original soundtrack has not been excessively digitally modified when transferred on DVD. In fact, monophonic soundtracks have been artificially turned into stereo ones far too often, and when the audio was stereo Dolby 5.1 technology has been applied. Such changes, Ã§a va sans dire64 yielded unacceptable technical, but mostly, aesthetic consequences that are similar to those concerning film dubbing. After all, one does not always have the option of listening to either the manipulated or the original soundtrack (possibly after a noise reduction operation). Those who are interested in the original version must carefully check that the package says so, although this is not always enough.65 The PathÃ© edition of Les MisÃ©rables, though, is a nice exception because the audio track has been restored as mono but, at the same time, it is compliant with the DTS HD regulation, which is a set of active and passive acoustic rules, not a technical processing as Dolby is.66 This important detail accounts for the respect and competence the restorers showed toward the original characteristics of the filmâs audio track.\n\n64 âNo need to say,â in French in the original text. [EN]\n\n65 I am referring to a striking case, namely a recently restored edition of Metropolis (see Part I, note 16) with the original music by Huppertz. This edition was released everywhere, I guess, except for Italy where the distributor preferred to save money twice: on the copyright owned by the production of the original musicâs recording and on the design of the DVDâs case that is a copy of the layout used for the German edition. Therefore, there is no real way to know whether the name of Huppertz has been left for dishonesty or negligence. But there is a solution: to buy foreign and national films abroad or, if possible, not to buy films released by a local distribution.\n\n66 An acoustic corrective process is called passive when it is applied to the physical environment (e.g. when using sound absorbing panels) and is called active when the sound is electronically modified (amplification, equalization, etc.). The latter can be applied to the former if the desired result has not been completely achieved.\n\nNow, with respect to dubbing, French distributors of the DVD are among the most radical because the only features they offer in addition to the original dialog track are the closed captions and, sometimes, the English subtitles. Having the chance to select the original language is, in fact, the only way a film should be seen and listened to, especially if one aims to an analysis of the soundtrack or if the film comes from Russia or the Far East. I say this for the respect I have for cinema and not to call for a multilingual talent that only a few people have. Behind this, there is also a typical French linguistic protectionism that is unparalleled in Europe and hard to agree with especially in Italy where anglicisms are everywhere, starting with some governmental expressions. At any rate, it is an indisputable fact that in Eastern films language sounds are greatly different from Western ones. What would be then the alternative for those who do not know Chinese, Japanese or Russian, like most of European and American spectators? Luckily English subtitles are nearly always present and the problem is solved.\n\nI will never forget the impression that Toshiro Mifuneâs real voice in DVD, its texture and its thickness had on me. After watching at the art cinema house Arlecchino in Florence (close to the Old Bridge; nowadays a porn film theater) the dubbed version of what was probably the national premiere of Rashomon (ç¾ çé, é»æ²¢æ, 1950) and The Seven Samurai (ä¸äººã®ä¾, é»æ²¢æ, 1954) by Akira Kurosawa, or The Burmese Harp (ãã«ãã®ç«ªç´, å¸å·å´, 1956) by Kon Ichikawa, to watch them again in original language felt like I have never seen them before. Despite all the bad things I said about a 1995 US restoration released in LP and VHS RCA by Red Seal with the new recording of the music directed by Yurij Temirkanov (Ð®ÑÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¢ÐµÐ¼Ð¸ÑÐºÐ°Ð½Ð¾Ð²),67 I felt something similar when I heard the real voice of Nicolai Cherkasov (ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°Ð¹ Ð§ÐµÑÐºÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð²) in AleksÃ ndr Nevskij (ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´Ñ ÐÐµÐ²ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹, 1938) by Sergei EjzenÅ¡tejn (Ð¡ÐµÑÐ³ÐµÐ¹ Ð­Ð¹Ð·ÐµÐ½ÑÑÐµÐ¹Ð½) with music by Sergei Prokofâev (Ð¡ÐµÑÐ³ÐµÐ¹ ÐÑÐ¾ÐºÐ¾ÑÑÐµÐ²). The same happened when I saw Ivan the Terrible, Part I (ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½ ÐÑÐ¾Ð·Ð½ÑÐ¹, 1945) and Ivan the Terrible, Part II (ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½ ÐÑÐ¾Ð·Ð½ÑÐ¹. Ð¡ÐºÐ°Ð· Ð²ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð¹: ÐÐ¾ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð·Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾Ñ, 1958), by the same authors.\n\n68 Where necessary a translation from French has been added in curly brackets. [EN]\n\n69 âN/Bâ stands for ânoir et blanc.â [ET]\n\n70 Differences: in DVD 1, during the opening credits, there is no music on black screen. Music is different and enters when Hugoâs portrait used in DVD 1 is shown. A much shorter âautographâ motto (but it is not Hugoâs hand writing) follows.\n\n71 With explicit synch I mean the exact and unequivocal coincidence between a filmic and a sound/musical event. In fact, sometimes a sound is immediately âdoubledâ and imitated by the music. With implicit synch, instead, I mean a much smoother audiovisual matching, such as a change in timbre, harmony, rhythm or dynamics, or the entrance and ending of a thematic segment. Many other factors might determine the presence of an implicit synch if at the same time something similarly smooth occurs on the screen. To know more about the distinction between implicit and explicit synchs in the context of the âtheory of levelsâ see Sergio Miceli, Film Music, p. 481-567.\n\nHonegger handled the music material for the opening credits in an unusual fashion: it made it homogeneous but varied at the same time, as if he was following a pre-classical model shaped on the example of Johann Sebastian Bach (and, in fact, both Honegger and Hindemith are considered to be the most remarkable heirs of the German master in the XX century). Also Pietro Mascagni planned a large architectural structure to compose the tripartite symphonic scherzo he wrote for Rapsodia satanica (Nino Oxilia, 1915) â he was even able to create some very natural synchs with the image. But, on one hand Mascagniâs models were above all Saint-SaÃ«ns, Debussy and Richard Strauss and, on the other, he composed for a silent film where the music should never stop. Thus, any comparison with Honegger ends here.\n\nNorth-American conception of film music had been tied to the silent cinemaâs standard for a while. In fact, leitmotivic, segnaletic, climatic and underscore functions,72 as typical of silent cinema, still remained after two decades of what is deemed to be the birth of sound cinema (1927). Nothing of the kind occurs in Honeggerâs film whose peculiarity, when compared to other films of that period, is precisely the low number of musical cues. In the first DVD, one exception (but it is not the only one) is represented by the monologue with which Monsieur Madeleine very dramatically rejects the idea of taking the identity of Jean Valjean again. In this scene, the characterâs screaming is imitated by the music. This coincidence must have responded to a precise request of the director who probably overcame his doubts about the efficacy of the scene by searching for the composerâs aid. Such a situation has been described very well by Ennio Morricone for years: âYou canât save a bad movie with a good score.â In Honeggerâs specific case the reader can replace âbad movieâ with âbad scene.â\n\nIn Jean Valjean sur la route (thus it is titled on the CD), after Jean gets out of jail, there are some lines of dialog at the end of the protagonistâs walk. They are just a few and do not interfere too much with the music. A little bit earlier, a beautiful and effective implicit synch is heard. In fact, if Valjean was alone in the first part of his walk and music was reduced to a melody played in pizzicato by cellos and basses, a few seconds later, while he is observing some female farmers, high-pitched strings step in and give the pleasant melody a more elevated character. It is as if the sceneâs light becomes brighter, whereas the effect is produced by the high-pitched strings that come in at the right moment.\n\nThe second film begins with an audiovisual invention that is one of the most effective not only of this version of Les MisÃ©rables, but of the whole international production in the twenty years between 1934 and 1954. While the little Cosette, who has been sent out for water at the spring, wanders in a daze around the attractions of a fairground, a grotesque and simple waltz is playing â La foire a Montfermeil. This is the perfect music for dÃ©licesâ stands,73 trained monkeys and fire-eaters. An accordion starts a ternary rhythm while a clarinet plays a melody Ã la maniÃ¨re de74 Erik Satie: minimalist and obsessive. A little bit later, the mirror-like entrance of an oboe and a flute followed by an oboe and a clarinet somehow refreshes both the melody and the timbre. It is an extemporary way of distancing from the realistic incipit by abstracting the musical material through the use of âacademicâ instruments that here are employed also in an abstract, chamber-like manner.\n\nCosette is standing on the edge of a wood that frightens her, especially at night. In its darkness she (and also the viewer) seems to see shapes that look like horrifying monsters. Once she gets in front of the clearing, while the ternary rhythm marked by the accordion and, in part, by the clarinet in unison keeps moving, the overall tone of the music âripplesâ at a timpaniâs roll in fast crescendo-diminuendo. A group of cellos in echo joins in and, eventually, violins in tremolo and cymbals complete the dramaturgy. After several attempts, Cosette is able to win her fears and can finally fill her bucket with water â here the music turns polytonal. Still in psychophysical distress, the girl gets out of the woods but, since she cannot carry the bucket, she loses heart and cries. Jean Valjean comes in right here. He is the one that will free Cosette forever from the ThÃ©nardierâs grip â the music seamlessly takes an elegiac turn.\n\nThere are many French actors who interpreted Jean Valjean, but Harry Baur (Henri-Marie Rodolphe Baur, 1880-1943) is first of the list for several reasons. He was certainly the first great interpreter of Jean Valjean in sound cinema. He had also what French people call les physique du rÈle,76 and despite other actors had a similar constitution (Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura and GÃ©rard Depardieu), Baur showed an incomparable vulgarity and stiffness on the psychological level. However, it is a real pity that in the first part he smiles to scorn at the convicts walking by. He has just been set free and that expression on his face is not much in tune with a character, Valjean, whom one would think to be upright and noble. On the other hand, it is quite possible that Bernard wanted to underline the egoism and lack of sensitivity that are typical of Valjean before his conversion.\n\nCosetteâs mother, Fantine, was interpreted by Florelle (Odette Rousseau, 1898-1974). Bernard, who collaborated to the film adaptation, manifested a particularly delighted attention toward her. Florelle always acted emphatically, melodramatically and, therefore, anachronistically with respect to both the filmâs modernity and Baurâs and Vanelâs acting, which is, instead, much more contained. This characteristic alone brings us twenty years back, when this type of acting was proper, perhaps, for divas of French silent cinema like Yvette AndrÃ©yor and Suzanne Bianchetti. In an interesting archive interview dated April 4, 1979 [sic] that is part of the supplements77 of DVD 2 from the reference edition, Raymond Bernard speaks about Florelleâs performance with high respect and conviction.78 There is nothing one can do but accept Bernardâs opinion. At any rate, my critique is still valid because Florelleâs interpretation of Fantine is barely believable.\n\nIn the third part of the film, Josselyne GaÃ«lâs interpretation of the adolescent Cosette is based on a doll-like expression. Due to her vaunted coquetry, it is hard to believe that the simpering girl had a troubled childhood. It seems like the director lost control of the main female characters, except for Orane Demazis interpreting the adult Eponine. If this was the case, Bernard could anyway show his skills both in the long sequence of the general Lamarqueâs burial service and in the even longer part dedicated to the barricades. In both situations the director is a real master of crowded scenes. But he can go even beyond what the definition of âmasterâ usually entails. In fact, during the appropriately prolonged wait for the solemn passing of the bier, no populist compromises are made while the shots to individual characters and collective scenes seamlessly alternate. Every detail is a self-contained âpearlâ that is hard to describe, particularly since nothing really happens in each small scene. Moreover, Bernard is able to show the two faces of the conflict without walking into the trap of a presumed intimacy with the figures that actually contributed to make History. The directorâs eye borders on the objectivity of a documentary report and the first battle, although won by the revolutionary front, is told with a dramatic conception that never turns into melodrama, rhetoric or triumphalism. In other words, the events yield their own very well-narrated drama; therefore, there is no need to search for external aid to enhance it. With regard to film shooting, there are moments (for example, the barricades at night) in which the power of images, the shotsâ angle, the bodiesâ plasticity and the light-and-shadows effect recalls some solutions used by EjzenÅ¡tejn (Ð­Ð¹Ð·ÐµÐ½ÑÑÐµÐ¹Ð½) in Ivan the Terrible, Part I (ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½ ÐÑÐ¾Ð·Ð½ÑÐ¹) and Ivan the Terrible, Part II (ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½ ÐÑÐ¾Ð·Ð½ÑÐ¹. Ð¡ÐºÐ°Ð· Ð²ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð¹: ÐÐ¾ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð·Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾Ñ). However, Bernard exhibits a stronger expressionist influence and a less patent formalism than EjzenÅ¡tejn. It could also be quite possible, though, that sources of inspiration were found in EugÃ¨ne Delacroixâs or ThÃ©odore Gericaultâs paintings. In any case, by watching the barricadeâs construction and the first battles, one quickly realizes that the ruling power will win, as always.\n\nExcept for the poor Max Dearly who is the last of the original list, in both DVDs female interpreters always come after male actors, regardless of how important their characters are in the story. However, in the 52-page booklet that comes with the reference Blu-ray edition, they tried to correct this inopportune order by placing the main interpreters in the position where they rightly belong to. Hence, in the List artistique,79 at page 47, Florelle occupies the third place, coming after Baur and Vanel. But, besides having confusingly relegated Arthur Honegger in the List Technique (p. 48), two places below maquillage and two places above script, the original male/female division remains and reflects the gender discrimination of that time. Of course, to read in a restored copyâs DVD of Lo squadrone bianco (Augusto Genina, 1936) that this film won the Mussolini Cup at the Venice Film Festival might not sound pleasant to who still possesses well-rooted antifascist principles. What should we do, then? Should we cancel a historical fact? It would be the worst possible mistake.\n\nLastly, here are presented three quite important observations concerning Vanel, Bernard and, eventually, Honegger. Charles Vanelâs Javert is not only the relentless man hunter of Jean Valjean, but also someone who shows some humanity, so much so that he gets close to be unwillingly humoristic. For example, in DVD 1, when Javert informs Valjean that he is going to be free again, the inspector asks the convict if he is happy about it. In DVD 2, after having waited for Jean Valjean to exit the sewer and having walked him to Mariusâ, he lets him go. Then, while raving, he commits suicide (but the scene is not shown). Although one of cinemaâs technical-expressive features is to show the effects of an event rather than the event itself, those who did not read the novel would probably not understand the excessively short shot of ripples on water. The director âfixesâ the problem by creating a short auxiliary scene (that is, with no real narrative necessity) in which two policemen detachedly comment upon their colleagueâs suicide. Therefore, the admirable sobriety of the interpretation notwithstanding, Vanelâs Javier is a little bit confusing and does not know whether or not to take a stand. Maybe Vanel was still too young (but at the time of Bernardâs film he was already over forty). Certainly he did not have a lot of film acting experience. After all, his proverbial ambiguity and negativity will come out only after WWII.\n\nRaymond Bernard (1891-1977) had been considered for a long time just as a good workman and nothing more. At present, though, he is under reassessment, and it was about time this happened. Such a reassessment starts precisely with Les MisÃ©rables that is deemed to be his best film along with Les croix de bois (1932). Actually, talking about Les MisÃ©rables is like talking about three films: the 1ere Ãpoque, that in the restored edition is called Une tempÈte sous un crÃ¢ne (115â); the 2Ã¨me Ãpoque, called Les ThÃ©nardier (86â); and the 3Ã¨me Ãpoque, called LibertÃ©, LibertÃ© ChÃ©rie (87â). The vicissitudes concerning long, medium and short versions of Bernardâs Les MisÃ©rables are much more complicated than what might seem here. In fact, in addition to the multiple versions edited in France, each distributor had in mind a specific duration for the audience of his country and PathÃ© had to comply with those requests.\n\nDVD box set Raymond Bernard â Eclipse Series 4 from the Criterion Collection â Janus Films. 3 DVDs.\n\nWooden cross (Les croix de bois), 1932, 113 minutes, black & white, mono, in French with English subtitles, 1:33:1 aspect ratio.\n\nLes MisÃ©rables, 1934, 281 minutes, black and white, mono, in French with English subtitles, 1:33:1 aspect ratio.\n\nZone 1 NTSC, from Amazon USA.\n\nThis version is very similar to the previous one and it differs only because is 7 minutes shorter. It is also divided into three films: the first on DVD 1 and the other two on DVD 2.\n\nEnglish titles are the literal translation of the original titles in French.\n\nThis edition does not have extras.\n\nOther differences are: abridged opening credits and a new production logo (âCNC A â archive franÃ§aise du film, prÃ©sententâ) that follows those of Eclipse Criterion, Janus Film and PathÃ©.\n\nImmediately following there is a photo portrait of Hugo, his long âautographâ motto and an intertitle saying: âPathÃ©-Natan prÃ©sente, un film de Raymond Bernardâ¦â. Hereafter, the rest is exactly like in the reference edition. Opening credits starts with the name of the director.\n\nSource: Archive S. M., Florence."
