        "text": "Jean Valjean is an essentially decent man imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread and transformed into a dehumanised outlaw. His faith in humanity is restored by the kindness of a bishop. Valjean goes to a small village to start life anew, but is pursued throughout his life for breaking parole by relentless police officer Javert. The various stages of Valjean’s life - from convict to businessman to elderly martyr - were bounded by the film’s original three-part structure. The three parts were released separately for a total running time of five hours. During the 1950’s, Raymond Bernard edited his film down to two parts of 90 mins each. This version remains one of the most satisfying, with both an epic dimension and a strong focus on the human elements.\n\nCredits: Director, Raymond Bernard ; writers, Andre Lang, Raymond Bernard ; photography, Jules Kruger ; music, Arthur Honegger, Maurice Jaubert.\n\nCast: Harry Baur, Florelle, Charles Vanel, Henry Krauss, Charles Dullin, Marguerite Moreno, Orane Demazis, Gaby Triquet, Josselyne Gael, Jean Servais.\n\nOur collection comprises over 40,000 moving image works, acquired and catalogued between the 1940s and early 2000s.
