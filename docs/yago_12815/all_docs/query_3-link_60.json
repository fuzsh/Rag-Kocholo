        "text": "I have never seen the musical Les Miserables; I tried to read the book a while back but never got past the first couple pages. That said, I was pretty excited to see the film. The epic story, the cast, and most of all the trailer, which basically made me cry, all had me really pumped. Les Miserables was pretty good, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nLes Mis is primarily the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), imprisoned for simply stealing a loaf of bread. The film opens with him and the rest of the prisoners pulling in a ship, all under the watchful eye of Inspector Javert (Russel Crowe). Javert summons Valjean and frees him, saying that his sentence has been served but he has to keep reporting to parole. Javert has some crazy fixation on him, and that only intensifies when he skips parole and assumes a new identity. After he gets taken care of by a priest, he feels that it’s his duty to take care of people in turn, so he assumes his new identity so that he can actually make some money. This sets up Valjean as our hero with a terrible secret, and also Javert as his relentless pursuer.\n\nYears pass, and Valjean manages to become the mayor of some French town and seems to be doing good in his position of authority. He opens some factories, providing jobs, but of course not enough. Then several things happen at once. Javert shows up once again looking for Valjean, while Valjean witnesses a catfight between several women in his factory. He goes to break it up, but gets distracted by Javert’s arrival. This pretty much ruins the life of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), one of the women in the factory. She gets fired, and then has to become a prostitute to provide for her daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried as an adult). Valjean eventually realizes the harm he has inadvertently caused her, and makes amends by taking care of Cosette after Fantine dies.\n\nEventually Cosette grows up, Javert comes closer and closer to catching Valjean, and a revolution in France is also getting closer and closer. This shift in the story is similar to the second half of Wuthering Heights, where you have the next generation of people taking over the story. At the end, Cosette and one of the revolutionaries, Marius (Eddie Redmayne) end up center stage, with most of the other characters ending up dead.\n\nMusicals tend not to have much of a story, which usually works because you have to have time for the songs and dancing and so forth. Les Mis, being adapted from a gigantic novel, has a ton of story, more than a musical usually has. So it is pretty long, but what makes it seem longer is actually the music itself. I will say I love musicals as a general concept; usually I love the music in a musical despite the lack of story. With Les Mis it was the opposite, the story was actually better than the music. It was really rambling and often didn’t have a coherent melody to latch on to. Les Mis walks the fine line between musical and opera; most of the lines were sung in the same rambling fashion. I feel like there was more of a contrast needed between the moments in a musical when the characters are singing and really pouring their hearts out, and just normal moments when they are just talking. I’m not an opera expert, but I think they do this in opera by varying the style of the music. This didn’t happen in Les Mis, and I really think it would have helped if it had.\n\nDespite this, Les Mis was still a really good movie. There was enough emotion between all of those characters that it would be hard to stifle them, and most of it came through. This was largely thanks to the great performances that the entire cast turned in. I have to say that Tom Hooper’s plan of just having actors sing live was a good one. I don’t know how it would have turned out if they had done it the normal way, but this way was fantastic and honestly I don’t know why directors don’t do this all the time.\n\nObviously, as the central character a lot of weight rested on Jackman’s Valjean, and he delivered big time. He is a really great singer in my opinion and I’m glad he got this role so we would get to hear him. The moments of Valjean’s internal conflicts were some of the most powerful in the film, and Jackman was able to portray these conflicts perfectly. Hands down, though, the best performance in the film was Hathaway as Fantine. Everybody’s saying it, and with good reason, that she’s going to win a supporting actress oscar and I’ll say it too. If she doesn’t get it I’ll be very surprised. She played defeated so well, especially when she sang “I Dreamed a Dream.” She was really really great with how much pain and hope she put into that song. I was really sad that she died near the beginning because I wouldn’t get to hear her sing anymore.\n\nAs I said, the rest of the performances were fantastic too. Seyfried was the perfect innocent blond girl, completely 100% nice. Her character kind of annoyed me, but she played her perfectly. Eddie Redmayne was similarly impressive. Completely noble hero type, and let me just say right now I hope he gets to do some more awesome movies. I loved him in My Week with Marilyn and Les Mis, and they were pretty different parts. I didn’t mention this before, but there’s another character in the second half of the story who is in a love triangle with Cosette and Marius and her name is Eponine, played by Samantha Barks. She was great as well, and more sympathetic of a character.\n\nNow we come to the evil characters, and they were fantastic. As the main antagonist, Russel Crowe was really good, better than I expected. I didn’t realize he could sing! I mean, he’s not like the best singer ever or anything, but he held his own. Other people could have played Javert, but Crowe worked perfectly well. The other major evil characters were comic relief, and they were hilarious, played by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. They were taking care of Cosette while Fantine was working, and kept showing up later to recognize Valjean at inopportune moments. They are basically just scumbags who will steal the clothes off your back, and they’re hilarious about it.\n\nLes Mis is a great movie musical, but strangely the music itself is what holds it back. However, it doesn’t hold it back too much, and the performances are fantastic. I admire the live singing experiment that Tom Hooper went with, and I hope more musicals are done that way in the future. I know that it’s been done before, but not a whole film has been done this way that I know of. Les Mis is well worth your time and I really look forward to seeing Anne Hathaway win something for it. (I hope I hope!)\n\n“I had a dream my life would be so different from this hell I’m living!”\n\nLong story short: 2.5/4 stars"
