        "text": "Victor Hugo’s classic novel, Les Miserables, is brought to life in form of the newly\n\nreleased film directed by Tom Hooper, “Les Miserables”. This musical was one of\n\nthe most heartbreaking and gratifying movies I’ve ever seen.\n\nThis is the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), an ex-prisoner who breaks parole in 1815 France, then gets hunted for the next 17 years by his prison guard, Javert (Russell Crowe). When Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine’s (Anne Hathaway) young daughter, Cosette (Amanda\n\nSeyfried), their lives change forever. This is the story of\n\nbroken dreams, unreturned love, passion and sacrifice.\n\nAlthough there are four earlier films under same name, Hooper made it his own by his\n\nunique portray as a musical. Adopted by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel\n\nSchönberg’s stage musical Les Misérables. All the\n\nmusical numbers were recorded live on set, every actor and actress had to power\n\ntheir voices through the sound effects on and off stage including the\n\nunpredictable weather. This technique had its flaws but all in all it pulled\n\nthrough.\n\nI’m not too big on musicals but this one captivated me from the different relatable\n\ntopics. Obviously I’m not an escaped prisoner or his guard out to get him but I\n\ncan relate to the idea of broken dreams and passion and sacrifice, everyone can\n\nin one way of another."
