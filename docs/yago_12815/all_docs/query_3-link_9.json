        "text": "Les Miserables is a heart-wrenching tale of love, loss and honour. It is based on the classic novel wrote by Victor Hugo. Every second is inspirational, a true epic that will not be forgotten easily. The story follows Jean Valjean an ex-slave who gets given a second chance at life by a forgiving bishop. This noble man motivates Valjean to follow the path of righteousness within years Valjean has become the noble mayor of a small town. Sadly no good news doesn’t come without bad. Fantine a struggling mother of a child named Cosette is fired and is forced into selling whatever she possesses including her body! Luckily Valjean can never turn his back on somebody in need he instantly rushes her to hospital but it’s already too late. The heroic Valjean takes Cosette as his child to save her from a future of pain. Javert a dedicated ruthless investigator soon learns that Valjean was a slave and vows to track him until his very last breath. Despite the constant running from Javert Cosette continues to love her adopted father. Inevitably Valjean grows older and watches his what was once young innocent daughter grow into a beautiful woman finding true love with Marius, a kind-hearted rebel leading the infamous French revolution with his many loyal followers. The inspiring revolutionaries are killed mercilessly; once again Valjean can never abandon a person in need thanks to his kind-hearted nature. He drags an injured Marius away from the deadly soldiers to save his life as he realises this courageous man can give Cosette happiness. This heart-wrenching film is unparalleled by any other film this year. Each and every little detail creates an amazing film full of mesmerising cast, moving characters and a dramatic and awe-inspiring plot. The incredible Tom Hooper has created a true epic that will go down in cinematic history.\n\nPrint this review"
