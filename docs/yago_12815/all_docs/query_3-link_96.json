        "text": "History\n\nLes Miserables is a novel written by Victor Hugo between 1842 and 1862. Hugo's incredibly detailed writing captures what French politics and society were like during this time. However, it was not Hugo's intent to simply provide a snapshot into daily life during the French Revolution. Instead,his intended message was to \"encourage compassion and hope in the face of adversity and injustice.\" Hugo supported the revolution and hoped his work would spark the fire of equality in his audience.\n\nThe novel was considered a success upon its publication and was considered a \"classic novel\" in the literary cannon. However, the story soared to the height of its popularity when it was transformed into a musical in 1980 (the story had been adapted to the screen in 1917, 1935, and 1952 but the films were never widely treasured). Claude-Michel Schonberg wrote the music while Alain Boubil and Jean-Marc Natel wrote the lyrics. The musical became an instant hit in Paris and its popularity quickly spread to England and America, premiering on Broadway in 1987 with an English translation of the libretto by Herbert Kretzmer. 6,680 performances and 16 years later, Les Miserables closed, becoming the third longest running Broadway musical ever (Cats is #1, Phantom of the Opera is #2.).\n\nFor the next three years, Les Mis (as it is affectionately called) toured to sold out crowds across America. In 2006, Les Mis was revived on Broadway and played for another two years. Then in 2014, Les Mis was revived for a second time on Broadway. Currently, Les Mis is performed by touring companies across America (and around the world).\n\nIn an effort to reach a wider audience, Les Mis was made into a film in 1998 it focused on the plot, eliminating the musical score. The movie was not successful. In 2012, Working Title films decided to produce a Les Mis as a movie but decided to included the musical score. Securing box-office draws such as Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, and Anne Hathaway, the movie was set for success and opened to record breaking ticket sales. The film was nominated for many awards and won Best Picture (Musical or Comedy) - Golden Globes, Best Supporting Actress - Golden Globes, Best Actress in a Supporting Role - British Academy Film Awards, and Best Sound Mixing, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Supporting Actress - Academy Awards.\n\nPlot\n\nActing\n\nSet\n\n(even though it says costumes, it actually is about the set)\n\nHair & Make Up\n\nCostumes\n\n(this video really is about costumes)\n\n2014-2015 Assessments\n\nLes Mis Theatrical Elements Thesis\n\nWhile watching, you were asked to note the director's choices regarding the theatrical elements of set design, make-up, costumes, and acting. Now, select ONE of these and watch the corresponding \"behind the scenes\" video above. (If you chose acting, focus on one actor and only watch his/her interview in the video.) Using the information from the video AND your own notes, craft the outline of an essay, including the thesis statement. (If you don't know how to write a thesis statement, see the Study Guide and Rubrics tab.) Complete this assessment on Edmodo under the quiz labeled, \"Les Mis Theatrical Elements Thesis,\" (this will go under the classwork category in the grade book).\n\nLes Mis Theme Thesis\n\nVictor Hugo's novel, and the subsequent musical, has endured lasting fame because of the timeless themes that are associated not just with the plot but with the intricate characters as well. Choose one of the following questions and craft the outline of an essay, including the thesis statement. (If you don't know how to write a thesis statement, see the Study Guide and Rubrics tab.) You must use SPECIFIC DETAILS from the film (that is why we took notes)! Complete this assessment on Edmodo under the quiz labeled, \"Les Mis Theme Thesis,\" (this will go under the PROJECTS category in the grade book).\n\nQuestions - Choose ONE! I have categorized them according to grade level. You do not HAVE to choose from your grade level but it is recommended.\n\n9th Grade:\n\nWhat is Hugo's view of human nature? Does he believe people are naturally good, naturally evil from birth, or somewhere in between? Support your claim with SPECIFIC EXAMPLES from the story.\n\nMarius has been described as a typical young Romantic. Compare him with other romantic leads in books, plays, poems, or film with which you are familiar.\n\nHow does Valjean change throughout the story? Is it all at once or are there stages in the change?\n\nCompare and contrast Valjean and Javert.\n\n10th Grade:\n\nOne of Victor Hugo's most obvious themes is unrequited (unreturned) love. Discuss the ways in which unrequited love is addressed and why it is such a recurrent theme.\n\nDiscuss the internal struggle that haunts Valjean after his release from prison. What forces influence the path he decides upon time and time again?\n\nDo any of the characters in Les Mis follow the hero journey as outlined by Joseph Campbell? Explain.\n\nWhat does Les Mis say about poverty/misery? Who does is portrayed as the miserable? Who is most miserable and why? Is Javert one of the miserables? What about the Thenardiers?\n\nWhat does Les Mis say about love? Things to consider: parental love? think of Fantine, Valjean, the Thenardiers; what is the relationship between sacrifice and love in the story; what about the love the bishop shows for Valjean?\n\nChoose a leitmotif and explain its theme as well as how it is used in the musical.\n\n11th Grade:\n\nIt is often said that Valjean's dominant personality trait is caritas (charity - active love for others). Support or disprove this claim using SPECIFIC EXAMPLES from the story.\n\nDiscuss Eponine’s selflessness and the significance that one of Hugo’s most noble characters is a member of the Thénardier family.\n\nDiscuss the relationship that develops between Cosette and Valejan. What fulfillment does each find in the relationship and why is Valjean willing to risk his freedom for it?\n\nWhat is true justice? Does mercy have a role in justice, in law? How does Javert cope (or not cope) with these ideas?\n\n12th Grade:\n\nGiven that Valjean's original crime was an act of altruism (stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's child) to what extent does he succeed or fail as a symbol of redemption?\n\nWhat principles guide Javert? What is ultimately responsible for his fate?\n\nDiderot (a French philosopher) defines one form of genius as the tendency to see abstract ideas only through their concrete manifestations. How does Victor Hugo illustrate this definition in Les Misérables?"
