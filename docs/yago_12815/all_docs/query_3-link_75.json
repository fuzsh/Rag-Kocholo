        "text": "Some of the Movie Versions of Les Misérables\n\nFrench actor Gabriel Gabrio who played Jean Valjean in the 1925 version. (Photo does not show him in that film).\n\nThe first movie based on the book was released as a silent film as early as 1909. Another silent French version was released in 1925, followed by yet another French silent adaptation four years later. Little is known about the background of the 1925 adaption, except that it was about 370 minutes long and released in three sections, possibly over a period of weeks. It starred Gabriel Babrio who, after failing to become a Hollywood star in the late twenties went on to become a mainstay of French cinema for a couple of decades. The movie's director was Henri Fercourt. Some film archives have prints of some seaquences of the movie..\n\nIn 1934 one of the most famous (some claim the best) cinematic versions of Les Misérables was also produced in France. Directed by Raymond Bernard and starring Harry Baur as Valjean, (he won an Academy Award for his performance, and was killed by the Gestapo during World War 2), the five hour film was released as three movies over a three-week span. Those who have seen the movie praise its fidelity to the novel's main plot-lines and its ability to combine exciting action sequences with convincing moments of personal drama and emotion.Its superb cinematography (Jules Kruger) and art direction are also impressive.\n\nIn 1935 Hollywood produced its own version of Les Misérables, featuring two stars of the era, the rather stolid Fredric March and the great scene-stealer Charles Laughton as a Javert in a performance not notable for its restraint.The main flaw of this movie lies in its heavy-handed omission of key sections of the book's plot and several of its important characters as well. The social issues fundamental to the novel are also downplayed. Yet it is still fondly regarded by many.\n\nIn 1952 Hollywood attempted Les Misérables again, this time with Lewis Milestone as director. Like the 1947 version, large parts of the novel's plot do not make their way on to the screen. The film's 102 minutes duration is insufficient to supply the depth and detail required in any film version of the novel. Three of the movies' leads -Michael Rennie, Debra Paget and Edmund Gwen lack essential charisma, although Robert Newton makes an interesting, embittered and intense Javert. But this is a movie that is stolid, fragmented and lacking in emotional impact.\n\nIn 1980 the French stage and film actor-director Robert Hossein produced the first stage musical version of the concept album of Les Misérables. Two years later he directed a non-musical movie of the book, one which adhered fairly closely to the novel's plot. Almost 200 minutes long in its French version, Hossein's movie was applauded for its deft outlining of the complicated plot, well-judged depiction of characters, and a refusal to wallow in sentimentality. The overall impression left by this movie was one of vigor and integrity. It acknowledged the popular aspects of Hugo's novel but also examined sympathetically the book's social and political concerns.\n\nThis 1995 French movie, directed by Claude Lelouch and starring Jean-Paul Belmondo, is a must-see. It is a moving and insightful adaptation of the novel which cleverly transposes Victor Hugo's themes into the twentieth century, especially France under Nazi occupation. The very features that give the novel its emotional and intellectual heft - the nature of tolerance, justice, revolution, love and humanity - also occupy a prominent place in Lelouch's movie, but the new perspective offered by the movie gives them added resonance.\n\nThe intriguing adaptation of the plot begins with the hero's father,Henri Fortin, wrongly convicted of murder is imprisoned and makes persistent attempts to escape. His wife and young son, are left destitute when the father dies in prison. The boy's mother is forced into prostitution, the son consumed by grief. When the scene shifts to Occupied France we see another husband and wife, the Zimans, Parisian Jews desperate to escape France. The husband promises Fortin, now middle-aged, a former boxer and now owner of a van, to drive the pair to Switzerland. In return, on the journey Ziman will read Les Misérables to the illiterate Fortin, who has seen and admired the 1934 film version in the cinema. Gradually Fortin comes to equate himself with Jean Valjean and to assume the heroic integrity of the fictional character as he tries to help the Zimans excape their Nazi pursuers.\n\nLelouch has emulated the book's epic social scope by setting his scenes in a variety of physical and social contexts: prison, high society, the world of professional boxing, French collaborators, train robberies.Although the film lasts for three hours and has more than a hundred speaking parts, the story is clear, the characters are precisely delineated, and the film has an irresistible momentum."
