        "text": "Literary cinema attracts more than academic interest when it derives from a work of such national importance as Victor Hugo’s Les misérables. Indeed, this 1862 novel is regarded worldwide as a monumental work exposing social injustice.\n\nRaymond Bernard’s massive, reverential film is a distinct disappointment showing little, if any, of the flair of his Les croix de bois (1932). It isn’t turgid, and it certainly holds the viewer’s attention; but it’s overstuffed with plot. It follows the book rather than transforms it into a film.\n\nVisually, Bernard takes his cue from original illustrator Emile Bayard as well as Hugo. This path of influence achieves its apotheosis in the images of abusively hard-worked little Cosette. Alas, Bernard’s film is essentially another series of illustrations, albeit ones reminiscent of Bayard’s.\n\nHarry Baur and Charles Vanel are marvelous as decent Jean Valjean and his nemesis, Inspecteur Javert, although by losing the latter for long stretches the film also manages to lose the tension of Javert’s relentless pursuit of Valjean. Bernard’s film accompanies the text without adding anything to our understanding of it. It’s superficial.\n\nJosseline Gaël is ridiculous as the grown up Cosette; Jean Servais, close to, as Marius Pontmercy. Of course, Hugo himself is no Flaubert; depth of characterization is no part of the greatness of his writing."
