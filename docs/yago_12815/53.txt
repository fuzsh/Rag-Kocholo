Les Misérables is a 1934 French film adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel of the same name. Scripted and directed by Raymond Bernard, it stars Harry Baur as Jean Valjean, Charles Vanel as Javert, and Josseline Gaël as Fantine. Initially released as three films that premiered over three consecutive weeks,[citation needed] Une tempête sous un crâne (Tempest in a Skull), Les Thénardier (The Thenardiers), and Liberté, liberté chérie (Freedom, dear Freedom), the full, unedited film clocks in at 281 minutes.

It is considered by critics to be the greatest adaptation of the novel, due to its in-depth development of the themes and characters, in comparison with most shorter adaptations.[1][2][3] Although produced by Pathé, filming took place on a specially constructed set in Biot, Alpes-Maritimes as well as the nearby Victorine Studios in Nice, as opposed to the company's Joinville Studios in Paris. Sets were designed by Lucien Carré and Jean Perrier, with music by eminent Swiss composer Arthur Honegger.
