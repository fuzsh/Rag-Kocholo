Les Misérables (2013) directed by Tom Hooper, last weekend took £4.2m in the UK Box Office adding to its gross total so far of £24.6m.

The adaptation of the musical of the same name had a budget of roughly $61m.

Upon the films initial release on the 11 January 2013 it received positive reviews.

The stage show, originally based on the 1862 novel by Victor Hugo, along with the new 2013 blockbuster movie are just two of the many adaptations of the original story.

There have been almost 100 adaptations of the story of Jean Valjean, and Fantine to name but a few of the characters.

Some of the adaptations include a 1934 French-speaking four-and-a-half-hour film, directed by Raymond Bernard.

Both a Brazilian and Turkish version film adaptation in 1967, various Japanese animated versions of the story throughout the 1970s.

Even a 1943 ‘Classic Comics’ comic book illustrated by Rolland H. Livingstone and other adaptations of the classic story include various radio and TV productions.

So far I have seen Les Misérables two times already; I was so impressed with this year’s adaptation.

I absolutely loved the songs, and the story was fantastic.

I am going to make my mission to attempt to watch as many of the other adaptations as I possibly can…

(Whisper) Do you hear the people sing? Singing a song of angry men? It is the music of a people, who will not be slaves again!

(Louder) When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums. There is a life about to start. When tomorrow comes!
