        "text": "When bands reach a milestone birthday, it’s an easy way to advertise concerts or give lapsed fans an excuse to attend a show. More than that, however, it’s a good excuse to celebrate; especially when the anniversary is significant—for example, the Stones turning 50 a few years ago—making a big deal about longevity is also a way to commemorate survival. Bands have precarious chemistry, and any group able to weather lineup changes and deal with mercurial personalities for decades deserves to be commended.\n\nThe downside, of course, is that these anniversary tours can become bloated with (or obscured by) nostalgia. At worst, bands inadvertently come across as self-aggrandizing or overly pleased with themselves and their accomplishments; at best, artists might reshape their own mythologies using rose-colored glasses. For example, when Roger Waters brought “The Wall” tour around the U.S. several years ago, it was jarring and sometimes incongruous to see the concert take an almost exuberant approach to the album’s very serious material.\n\nThe Cure, however, are not like most bands. And so although the U.K. group coalesced in 1976, the announcement of their 2016 U.S. tour came with no fanfare about them turning 40. This lack of fuss has continued as the group arrived in the States and started playing shows; Frontman Robert Smith hasn’t been on the interview circuit and the band’s social media accounts aren’t giving behind-the-scenes dissections of the gigs, giving the trek a low-key, almost secretive air. This intrigue amplified after tour setlists started rolling in: The Cure were dusting off tunes they haven’t played in decades (“The Perfect Girl”), debuting new songs (“Step Into the Light,” “It Can Never Be the Same”), pulling out random b-sides and dipping deep into albums for out non-singles (“Like Cockatoos,” “The Snakepit”). “Burn,” the gothic smolder from 1994’s “The Crow” soundtrack, even landed in heavy rotation.\n\nIt’s a cliché to say that a tour is “for the die-hards,” but the sequencing and song choices of these shows felt calibrated squarely for loyalists, those who would lose their minds to hear such rarities. Yet because the Cure are known for their marathon sets, casual fans wouldn’t necessarily be bored. Even better, nobody was quite sure what the band would play each night—a rarity for an act playing even mid-sized arenas. Bands that are 40 years into their career aren’t supposed to sound this vital and flexible.\n\nThe band’s June 10 Chicago concert in particular struck an incredible balance between commercial success and catalog depth. After opening with a trio of gloriously desolate tunes—the gnarled, gloomy “Shake Dog Shake,” doom-laden “Kyoto Song” and despairing “A Night Like This”—the set snaked through a series of oddities (the scabrous “Screw,” the mysterious “Like Cockatoos”) and moody faves such as “Pictures of You” and “Lovesong.” Smith was well aware of the balance the Cure needed to strike, however. “Don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten it’s Friday night,” he joked after “Just Like Heaven,” one of the few hits the band had played thus far midway through the set. “It’s called pacing ourselves.”\n\nHe kept his promise: The main set crescendoed to the angsty, textured “From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea” and ended with a one-two sucker punch: a howling, desperate take on “One Hundred Years” from 1982’s “Pornography” and “The Top” album cut “Give Me It.” The latter song was all-consuming and immersive, courtesy of relentless, dizzying spotlights and disorienting video, as well as Reeves Gabrels’ squealing, agonizing guitars; the arena felt like it was levitating from the song’s power. The night followed up with a tour debut, the rarely played title track from 1984’s “The Top,” and then three more encores with even more rarities (the soaring b-side “Exploding Boy”) and then a procession of hits. By the end, Smith was even unleashing some lighthearted, goofy dance moves along with the crowd during the spirited “Let’s Go to Bed,” a manicured “Close to Me” and the strutting “Why Can’t I Be You?”\n\nBut despite being such a comprehensive spin through the band’s back catalog, the concert didn’t feel at all nostalgic. If anything, The Cure sounded invigorated by their own music. Smith’s voice sounded ageless and pristine—at turns desperate, playful, yearning, romantic and ferocious—while guitarist Gabrels unleashed psychedelic fury throughout “Never Enough” and layered swirling, morose atmosphere over “Fascination Street.” Keyboardist Roger O’Donnell, meanwhile, added classical flair and grace to “Charlotte Sometimes” and “In Between Days,” while bassist Simon Gallup leapt and darted around the stage, flitting around the band members. Jason Cooper’s drums, meanwhile, were arena-ready and powerful. The Cure have had various members cycle in and out over the years, but this particular configuration jelled in dynamic ways.\n\nIt’s not correct to say The Cure is underrated—after all, no band selling out 10,000-seat (and up) arenas is. But it’s almost too easy to take them for granted, since the group haven’t released a new studio album in eight years and, even then, tend to keep a low profile. Yet the Chicago concert—and, frankly, this entire tour—underscores the singularity of the band’s music. Post-punk, dream-pop, synthpunk, goth and psychedelic rock —all of these influences coalesce into something that can only be described as sounding like The Cure. That’s always been the case; after all, even their pop crossover hits “Lovesong” and “Friday I’m In Love” sounded like outliers. It’s significant that groups inspired by The Cure tend to only mimic certain facets of the band: the dark guitar creases, the sparkling keyboards, the roiling post-punk storms. No band has been able to capture the depth—and nooks and crannies—of the group’s sonic chemistry.\n\nNear the start of the Chicago show, The Cure launched into “Push,” a fan favorite from 1985’s “The Head on the Door.” The crowd let out a huge, cheering roar as the song began, dancing joyfully to the extended instrumental intro and pumping their fists to the song’s “Go, go, go!” chorus exhortation. That communal ecstasy cropped up again and again throughout the night, as the audience reveled in the familiar and the unexpected. The Cure’s music and reputation was predicated on unifying outsiders—those drawn to (or plagued by) unrequited or missing love, fatalistic romances and general melancholy—but this outlaw attitude has only become more of a bonding experience as the years have progressed. Forty years on, the misfits haven’t exactly won—but at a Cure concert, they’ve certainly found a place they can feel at home.\n\nFrom the moment The Cure took the stage Monday night, a cascade of four decades’ worth of groundbreaking, gorgeous guitar rock washed away anything outside Madison Square Garden. Their music’s been called punk, goth, new wave, romantic and even “alternative” over the last 40 years, but that evening it was clear all those labels fall short of describing what can only truly be known as “The Cure.”\n\nThe thrill of this current tour has been the deep, deep spelunking Smith and the boys have been doing in their massive back catalog for their set lists. Monday night, one of the primary focal points was 2000’s Bloodflowers, the incredibly under-appreciated third installment of their famous trilogy that also includes 1982’s Pornography and 1989’s Disintegration, as well as the group’s final LP for Elektra Records.\n\nSmith, along with drummer Jason Cooper, former Psychedelic Furs/Thompson Twins/Berlin keyboardist Roger O’Donnell (who has been playing in The Cure on and off since 1987), perennial bassist Simon Gallup and the mighty Reeves Gabrels of David Bowie’s Tin Machine on lead guitar, kicked off the first set with a beautiful reading of the opening song from Bloodflowers, “Out of This World,” then proceeded to cherry pick the best of the best cuts throughout their two hours and forty minutes onstage, with electrifying renditions of “39”, “The Last Day of Summer” and the title track punctuating the interpolation between Smith and his latest foil.\n\nWhereas the group concentrated on Disintegration on the first night (with a whopping nine songs!) and Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me the second night, tonight’s emphasis belonged to the 1985 fan fave The Head On The Door, playing five cuts including “A Night Like This”, “Kyoto Song”, “Push”, “In Between Days” and a version of “Close to Me” that saw Smith put down the guitar he’d been playing the whole night and dance around in his trademark black blouse like he did in the Thatcher days.\n\nKiss Me, meanwhile, was represented by only three songs, but when those selections are “Hot Hot Hot!!!”, “Just Like Heaven” and “Why Can’t I Be You” the level of excitement exuded by the capacity crowd was so electric you’d think they played the whole record in its entirety.\n\nDisintegration, meanwhile, was represented by “Closedown”, “Pictures of You”, “Lovesong” and an animated run through “Lullaby”.\n\nOther albums highlighted included Seventeen Seconds (“A Forest”, “At Night”, “Play for Today”), The Top (massive, massive versions of “Bananafishbones”, “Shake Dog Shake” and “The Caterpillar”), Wish (“High” and “Trust”), 4:13 Dream (“Sleep When I’m Dead”), Pornography (“A Strange Day”) and, of course, that indelible version of “Boys Don’t Cry” which has been closing out every night of the tour.\n\nThe true chemistry, on the other hand, existed between Bob and Gallup, whose distinctive bass playing has been the backbone of The Cure since 1980 (save for a brief departure in 1982 after he and Smith apparently got into a fistfight over a bar tab). The way these two old friends played off each other, with Gallup prowling the entirety of the MSG stage all night like a caged leopard looking more like a rockabilly rebel than a goth icon, was perhaps the most lasting impression of the evening.\n\nThat is, of course, until the show ended and the sole member on the stage was Smith, who seemed to be genuinely touched by the enormous outpouring of love and appreciation the crowd was throwing at them (save for the group of idiots in the “suite seats” in front of us taking selfies the entire fucking night without an ounce of acknowledgment to their surroundings. (These are the people who get free tickets to these shows, folks).\n\nIf you are an actual fan of these titans of English rock and have not seen them already on this current tour, I implore you to do so, even if you have to drop a couple of Benjamins on Stub Hub to get yourself in the door. You won’t regret a second of it.\n\n©\n\nThey work hard for it, Robert Smith & Company. You understand Dolly Parton’s show business dictum, “It takes a lot of money to look this cheap”? Then you understand the generative contradictions of the Cure: It must take a lot of optimism to look that disenchanted. But in a certain corner of the band’s work, the opposite holds true, too: It has to take a lot of disenchantment to look that optimistic. And from there you can spin out other noun-adjective combinations, which similarly work in forward or reverse: confidence/shaky. Centrality/marginal. Generosity/self-absorbed. Forethought/nostalgic. Hardness/tender. Severity/sweet.\n\nBy “look” I don’t only mean physical image, and I’m not only talking about Mr. Smith, whose appearance on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, in the first of his band’s three-night run there, was the same as usual: loose black clothes, Struwwelpeter hair, black eye shadow and eyeliner, red lipstick that covered slightly more than the area of his lips. I mean visuals, sound and cultural meaning as one integrated and basically globalized post-punk thing — unwavering and with remarkably little grandstanding, for nearly three hours.\n\nThe live sound of the band amounted to an atmosphere: Simon Gallup’s rugged, grip-tape bass lines, high up in the mix; the pallid beams of Roger O’Donnell’s keyboard melodies; Mr. Smith’s vocal wail and bright, watery guitar tone; the drummer Jason Cooper’s thump at medium tempos; the extra layer of echo, viscosity and whoosh from the lead guitarist, Reeves Gabrels. The atmosphere suggested nearly every black-walled, beer-sticky alternative-rock club I’ve been in since the late ’80s, places of joy and cynicism. In retrospect, those places seem built for, or by, the Cure.\n\nMr. Smith spent almost no time on chat and platitudes, swapped out his own guitars rather than wait for roadies and tuned up at least once on his own. There were background screen visuals for very few of the 32 songs, and the stage-camera work was negligible: mostly fixed in place and far away from Mr. Smith. It really was a club show writ large. Maybe it takes a strong club band to be a strong arena band.\n\nA lot of Cure songs are either simple and short or comfortably repetitive in their middle sections when they push toward 10 minutes; not a lot of new strains, key changes and dynamics. But they are constructed with an almost classical sense of proportion and impact, and performed for even more: About two-thirds of the way through “Prayers for Rain,” Mr. Smith drew out a note near the top of his voice to drive home the last word of the title. The rest of the song was about coming down from that moment.\n\nThese songs become a disposition; you settle into them, and they keep coming. One source, setlist.fm, has tabulated that the band has played 79 songs so far on its current tour, which is a great amount for an old rock band. (The Cure began recording in 1978 and hasn’t stopped since, despite lineup changes.) The number may keep growing. Mr. Gabrels, in an interview last year, said that the band kept 97 active songs in its touring pool.\n\nSaturday’s show had four sets of encores, and after the first three, Mr. Smith put his hand up on his clavicle, seemingly not so much as a stagy gesture of being overwhelmed, but as you might do reflexively to collect your thoughts when you’ve got a lot on your plate; he looked away from the audience and briskly walked off. After the fourth, he acknowledged us, modestly but with intent.\n\nThe songs here traced back 37 years — “Boys Don’t Cry” the oldest, “Pornography” the most transfixing, and the fourth set of encores, including “The Perfect Girl” and “Close to Me” the most joyous. In that span were a lot of different styles, telegraphed more through the songs’ outer layers than their cores. Which is to say it was often Mr. Gabrels’s job to signal the aesthetics of 1981, or 1992 or 2008. Mr. Smith’s cry could remain constant.\n\nBut there was a taut discipline here that made all that music cohere into one long project. Part of it has to do with the fact that Mr. Smith is adding new songs to the set, and they’re good ones. One of Saturday’s was “It Can Never Be the Same,” the beginning of the first encore, after “Disintegration,” steady and glum. (“That pit that we fell down,” Mr. Smith explained, “we’re staying there for a while, till we climb out.”) And the new song — its title rendered in big letters on his guitar — was grand, slow, fuzzy, swirly: of a piece with what had gone before.\n\nIt seemed to be about dealing with the death of someone close; it moved from optimism to pessimism, from “it’s not like there won’t be another one” to “there won’t be another one.” Did he tear up? He may have. (Mr. Gallup patted him on the shoulder at the end.) An online video from the band’s May 17 concert in El Paso shows him tearing up; that was only the fifth time he’d played the song live. According to setlist.fm, Saturday was the 19th.\n\n© NYT"
