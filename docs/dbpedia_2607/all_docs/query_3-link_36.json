        "text": "SALEM – Mr. Roger E. Leger, 79 of Salem, loving husband of Marie M. (Baccari) Leger, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, August 9th, 2023 in the comfort of his home, surrounded by his loving family.\n\nBorn in Lynn, Roger was the son of the late Edward and Anita (Boucher) Leger. He was raised and educated in Lynn, graduating from St. Jean the Baptist High School in 1963.\n\nA proud veteran, Roger enlisted into the United States Air Force in 1963 and was honorably discharged after serving his country for nearly four years, two actively during the Vietnam War. He was a member of Redhorse 556, helping to build the first airbase for the B52’s to land. His honor, respect and courage sustained within him throughout his life, increasing his involvement in numerous veteran groups in Salem, including his position as Commander of the Salem Veterans Council, in addition to Post Commander of the Salem DAV as well as District Commander and Post Commander for the Salem VFW Witch City Post #1524. Roger valued being a voice and benefiting fellow veterans. An honored hospice volunteer for the No Veteran Dies Alone program at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Roger took great pride in simply being present with veterans during their final moments and honoring them for their many sacrifices. Volunteering for the hospital for over 16 years, Roger enjoyed assisting veterans in any way he could, no matter the time of day or night. To his core, he was an honorable veteran and represented that each and every day.\n\nProfessionally, Roger devoted his career to plumbing and pipefitting. First starting as a plumber in the Air Force, Roger would later dedicate over 25 years with General Electric in Lynn as a pipefitter until the time of his retirement.\n\nLeisurely, Roger was happiest when being outdoors. He enjoyed camping, fishing, hunting and golf. He delighted in watching all sports, especially the Red Sox, Patriots and Bruins and took pride in assisting in coaching his son’s little league teams, the Bears, the Cubs and the Astros in Salem during the 80’s. Together, Roger and Marie often traveled by both land and sea, visiting many countries on cruises, and touring many states with their family. His favorite destination was Las Vegas. He adored singing and was passionate about it from a young age. He was a member of St. Jeans Men’s Choir as a Tenor, having the opportunity to travel to Rome in 1987, where he met the Pope and performed at the Vatican. And later in life was a member of The Northshoremen Barbershop Chorus. Music was a form of comfort for Roger and something he cherished every day. Above all else, Roger treasured his loving family and will be fondly remembered by many for his kindness and devotion. He will be deeply missed. The family would also like to acknowledge the staff at Kaplan House - Care Dimensions in Danvers, as well as the VA West Roxbury Medical Center.\n\nIn addition to his loving wife Marie, with whom he celebrated nearly 53 years of marriage, Roger is survived by his son, Edward Leger and his partner, Robin Luciano of Lawrence and his daughter, Lisa Leger of Salem; his grandchild, LacyMae (Dani) Leger of Lawrence; sisters, Jeannine Boulanger of Shrewsbury, and Anita Kelley of Worcester; his brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, Larry Baccari and his partner, Marsha Conway, Frank Baccari, Camille Belle, and Ann Baccari all of Salem, as well as his beloved cat, Willow, and many cousins, nieces and nephews. Roger was the brother-in-law of the late, Ronald Boulanger and Jack Kelley.\n\nARRANGEMENTS: His funeral will be held from O’Donnell Cremations – Funerals – Celebrations, 84 Washington Sq., (at Salem Common) SALEM on Monday, August 14th at 10 A.M. followed by his funeral Mass at Ste. Anne’s Parish, 292 Jefferson Ave., Salem at 11 A.M. Relatives and friends invited. Burial in St. Mary’s Cemetery, Salem. Visiting hours on Sunday, August 13th from 3 to 7 P.M.
