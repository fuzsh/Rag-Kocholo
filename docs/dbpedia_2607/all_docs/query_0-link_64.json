Assembly Amendments add legislative findings and specify how CalVet and EDD shall collaborate with each other. ANALYSIS: Existing law: 1)Establishes the corps and requires the corps to implement and administer the conservation corps program. 2)Requires the corps, in conjunction with EDD, to place an emphasis on developing and executing plans to assist corpsmembers in obtaining employment following their participation in the corps program. This bill requires the corps to collaborate, as specified, with CalVet and EDD to assist any corpsmember who is a veteran in obtaining permanent employment after participating in the corps, and makes relevant legislative findings. Background The corps was created in 1976 and employs for one year young adults between the ages of 18 - 25 (veterans up to the age of 29 may participate in some circumstances). The corps offers both residential and nonresidential programs throughout the state and aims to, among other things, provide youth with educational and training opportunities and increase their understanding and appreciation of the environment. Over 120,000 individuals have participated in the program to date with roughly 3,000 new corpsmembers joining each year. SB 1227 Page 3 According to a 2013 report by the California Research Bureau, California has the largest veteran population at approximately 1.9 million of any state, and over half of the state's veterans are over the age of 60. While the statewide employment rates for both female and male veterans of all ages is greater than for non-veterans, young veterans have higher unemployment rates. Male veterans between the ages of 18 - 24 have a 4% higher unemployment rate than their civilian peers (20.4% vs. 16.4%), and female veterans between the ages of 25 - 34 years of age have a 3.3% higher unemployment rate (11.6% vs. 8.3%). CalVet estimates that 35,000 - 40,000 veterans will return to California each year for the next few years as the military downsizes following the reduction in troop deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, according to the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, 25 percent of recent veterans have service-connected disabilities, compared to about 13 percent of all veterans, which aggravates the veteran employment situation. EDD assists Californians, including veterans, with obtaining employment through its Workforce Services Branch. All veterans receive priority for workforce services through U.S. Department of Labor funding. In addition, the Jobs for Veterans State Grant also provides funding for specialized staff to assist veterans in finding work and to conduct outreach to employers on behalf of veterans. There have been and are veterans-specific programs at the corps. According to the corps, there are numerous corps crews composed of veterans active today. Two current active programs are in fisheries and firefighting. For eligible veterans, participating in corps programs is one method to return to the civilian workforce. According to 2011 - 2016 data from the corps, 554 veterans participated in corps programs for veterans of which about 57% either found employment after completion (289) or enrolled in school or returned to the military (28). SB 1227 Page 4 Comments This bill mandates collaboration between the corps, CalVet and EDD. Existing law already requires the corps, in conjunction with EDD, to place an emphasis on developing and executing plans to assist corpsmembers in obtaining employment following their participation in the corps. EDD has existing expertise and existing programs in place that emphasize veteran employment. No metrics are included to monitor or assess the impact of this required collaboration. FISCAL EFFECT: Appropriation: No Fiscal Com.:YesLocal: No According to the Assembly Appropriations Committee, there are no significant costs to the corps, CalVet and EDD as all agencies indicate the activities required by the bill are consistent with existing efforts.

The author states that CalVet's experience in helping veterans makes them best suited to assist the existing efforts of the corps and EDD in finding work placement for veterans. \"These brave women and men fought for us, it's time that we fight for them.\" ASSEMBLY FLOOR: 79-0, 8/18/16 AYES: Achadjian, Alejo, Travis Allen, Arambula, Atkins, Baker, Bigelow, Bloom, Bonilla, Bonta, Brough, Brown, Burke, Calderon, Campos, Chang, Chau, Chávez, Chiu, Chu, Cooley, Cooper, Dababneh, Dahle, Daly, Dodd, Eggman, Frazier, Beth Gaines, Gallagher, Cristina Garcia, Eduardo Garcia, Gatto, Gipson, Gomez, Gonzalez, Gordon, Gray, Grove, Hadley, Harper, Holden, Irwin, Jones, Jones-Sawyer, Kim, Lackey, Levine, Linder, Lopez, Low, Maienschein, Mathis, Mayes, McCarty, Medina, Melendez, Mullin, Nazarian, Obernolte, O'Donnell, Olsen, Patterson, Quirk, Ridley-Thomas, Rodriguez, Salas, Santiago, Steinorth, Mark Stone, Thurmond, Ting, Wagner, Waldron, Weber, Wilk, Williams, Wood, Rendon NO VOTE RECORDED: Roger Hernández SB 1227 Page 6 Prepared by: Katharine Moore / N.R. & W. / (916) 651-4116 8/30/16 14:37:40 **** END ****"
