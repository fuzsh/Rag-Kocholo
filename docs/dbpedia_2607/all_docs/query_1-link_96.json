        "text": "University Distinguished Professor Emeritus Thomas Vonder Haar’s 52-year career at Colorado State University has had many high points – both figurative and literal. As chair of the Department of Atmospheric Science, he led the graduate program to its ranking as one of the top three in the U.S., and as the founding director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, he oversaw satellite research and a NASA mission.\n\nVonder Haar’s interest in meteorology took off when he got his pilot’s license at 19 and accelerated in graduate school at the University of Wisconsin under the guidance of Verner Suomi, who is considered the father of satellite meteorology. Since then, Vonder Haar has made CSU a recognized leader in satellite meteorology.\n\nParticipating in Northern Colorado’s emergence as a nexus for science and technology has been most satisfying as he looks back on decades of remarkable accomplishments as a researcher, educator and leader in the field. This has been his goal since joining CSU in 1970.\n\nRead the full Source article, “In 52 years with CSU, Thomas Vonder Haar has taken atmospheric science to new heights.”\n\nA federal agency awarded 12 Colorado State University researchers more than $3.1 million for such innovative science as improving how satellites show smoke plumes, using AI to predict precipitation, and, perhaps for the first time, evaluating how individual storms could change with climate intervention.\n\nThe three-year grants from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, are aimed at scientists studying climate science and community resilience.\n\nNearly all CSU recipients are based in the Department of Atmospheric Science, which is considered among the best graduate programs in the nation.\n\nRead more about the projects here.\n\nWalter Petersen, chief of the Science Research and Projects Division at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, has been selected as the department’s 2022 Outstanding Alum.\n\nPetersen received his M.S. (1992) and Ph.D. (1997) from the department, studying with Professor Steven Rutledge. His dissertation was “Multi-Scale Process Studies in the Tropics: Results from Lightning Observations.”\n\nPetersen continued as a research associate in the department until 2002, when he accepted a position as senior research scientist in the National Space Science and Technology Center at the University of Alabama-Huntsville. Petersen served as science director for the UAH ARMOR dual-polarimetric Doppler radar facility.\n\nIn 2008, he became a physical scientist at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and in 2011, he became a supervisory research physical scientist and the branch chief of the Earth Science Field Support Office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Wallops Flight Facility. Petersen returned to NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville as division chief in 2015, where he leads 200 scientists, engineers and technical specialists.\n\nPetersen’s research spans many topics in cloud physics, mesoscale meteorology and radar meteorology, and he has made seminal contributions in remote sensing of tropical convection, the relationship between lightning and updraft strength, and how cloud-to-ground lightning relates to convective rainfall.\n\nAmong his many leadership roles, Petersen has been a principal leader of the calibration and validation of the NASA Global Precipitation Mission (GPM), providing an essential and sustained contribution to a major program of NASA’s Earth Science Directorate. He led the NASA-JAXA GPM ground validation program from 2011-2019 and helped organize eight associated field programs.\n\nPetersen has authored or coauthored at least 105 peer-reviewed journal publications, which have been cited more than 11,000 times. He is well known for his dedicated service to the atmospheric science community, including as chair of the AMS Committee on Atmospheric Electricity.\n\nPetersen was elected an AMS Fellow in 2020 and has received numerous other awards, including the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 2018. He was nominated for the Outstanding Alum award by Rutledge and University Distinguished Professor Emeritus Graeme Stephens.\n\nPetersen will be honored in a ceremony later this semester or early next year, when he will have the opportunity to present his work.\n\nNote from Petersen:\n\nI offer my sincere thanks to the Department of Atmospheric Science for this award. This honor is certainly not something I would have envisioned when joining the department as a graduate student back in 1990. There is no question that it is the result of the excellent education, coaching, mentoring, dedication, and more than occasional personal counseling and guidance offered by faculty, colleagues, fellow classmates, and most especially, my research advisor, Professor Steve Rutledge. Within the broader supporting infrastructure of the department, Steve did not just provide the opportunity to learn, he also provided me the examples and tools required to succeed in the role of a Ph.D.-level scientist; i.e., how to learn, do research, manage a field project, communicate, and how to lead. Those lessons were routinely reinforced by the faculty, students, and researchers that I was fortunate enough to interact with while at the department.\n\nMy rounded “education” in the department involved a great deal of one-on-one counseling from any number of faculty in any number of situations – and it was all good advice, much of which I relate to students I advise to this day. I was also fortunate to have been a member of a tight group of “well-seasoned” and personable graduate students in Radarmet. These people became the absolute best support group I could have ever hoped for while at CSU. To this day, I feel a special connection to those folks – they reflect the best of an integrated set, a standard really, of personal qualities blended with intellect that CSU Atmospheric Science attracts.\n\nFinally, there is no question that my professional direction has benefited from myriad field campaign adventures focused on studies of convection, lightning and precipitation using advanced radar technologies that are characteristic of a place like CSU. I got to experience the “atmospheric laboratory” from the jungles of the Amazon, the beautiful isolation of both the tropical western and eastern Pacific Ocean, and of course closer to home in Colorado and on the Great Plains. The field experiences, combined with the science knowledge, personal interactions, and all the science leadership skills taught explicitly or implicitly to me while being at CSU, brought me to where I am today. What a ride!\n\nMy sincere thanks again for this award and the integrated set of experiences and opportunity that laid the foundation for my receiving it.\n\nProfessor Scott Denning, a climate scientist at Colorado State University, has been awarded the Climate Communication Prize by the American Geophysical Union, a professional organization of Earth and space scientists. The prize recognizes significant impact communicating climate science to the public.\n\nDenning has presented hundreds of animated climate science talks over the past 15 years to audiences of all ages, all around the world. His outreach has included engaging 500,000 K-12 students in climate science and advising teachers, meteorologists and journalists in climate communication.\n\nDenning relishes invitations to speak to climate change skeptics and says he “takes special delight in engaging hostile audiences.” His passion for science and relatable style have won over even a few hardcore climate change deniers.\n\nRead the full Source story, “Four questions with AGU Climate Communication Prize winner Scott Denning.”\n\nData collected by a team of citizen scientists as part of a Colorado State University-led project will help the National Weather Service and meteorologists across the country report on the continued impact of Hurricane Ian.\n\nThe Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network – known as CoCoRaHS – began in the aftermath of the 1997 Spring Creek Flood in Fort Collins. It has since grown into a network of 25,000 people across all ages and backgrounds who use rain gauges to provide the NWS with precipitation reports about the conditions in their own backyards.\n\n“It’s so valuable for the National Weather Service to be able to get reports about what’s happening on the ground because radar and satellite can really only do so much,” said Noah Newman, the education and outreach coordinator for CoCoRaHS.\n\nRead the full Source story, “Data from CSU-led project shows on-the-ground reports from Hurricane Ian.”\n\nGraphic above: A screenshot of reports to CoCoRaHS the day Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida.\n\nTwo Colorado State University atmospheric scientists have been recognized by the American Geophysical Union, a professional organization of more than 60,000 Earth and space scientists. Professor Emeritus Wayne Schubert has been elected a fellow, and Professor Scott Denning will receive the Climate Communication Prize. AGU will honor Schubert and Denning during a ceremony at its Fall Meeting in Chicago.\n\nWayne Schubert – Fellow\n\nFellowship recognizes outstanding contributions to the Earth and space sciences. Fellows demonstrate remarkable innovation and/or sustained scientific impact. Less than one-tenth of 1% of AGU members are selected for this honor each year. This honor joins many others Schubert has collected during 48 years with the Department of Atmospheric Science. In 2021, AGU chose Schubert to deliver the Jule Gregory Charney Lecture. The Charney Lecture is presented to a prominent scientist who has made exceptional contributions to the understanding of weather and climate.\n\nScott Denning – Climate Communication Prize\n\nThe Climate Communication Prize is given annually to a scientist who has had significant impact communicating climate science to the public. Over the past 15 years, Denning has shifted his focus from climate and biogeochemical research to climate communication and outreach, delivering hundreds of talks to audiences of all ages and levels of openness to the subject matter.\n\nRead more about Schubert, Denning and their awards in the Source article, “American Geophysical Union honors two CSU atmospheric scientists.“\n\nProfessors Patrick Keys, Elizabeth Barnes and James Hurrell co-authored this piece for The Conversation, based on their recent research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Colorado State University is a contributing institution to The Conversation, an independent collaboration between editors and academics that provides informed news analysis and commentary to the general public.\n\nImagine a future where, despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly, parts of the world have become unbearably hot. Some governments might decide to “geoengineer” the planet by spraying substances into the upper atmosphere to form fine reflective aerosols – a process known as stratospheric aerosol injection.\n\nTheoretically, those tiny particles would reflect a little more sunlight back to space, dampening the effects of global warming. Some people envision it having the effect of a volcanic eruption, like Mount Pinatubo in 1991, which cooled the planet by about half a degree Celsius on average for many months. However, like that eruption, the effects could vary widely across the surface of the globe.\n\nHow quickly might you expect to notice your local temperatures falling? One year? Five years? Ten years? What if your local temperatures seem to be going up?\n\nAs it turns out, that is exactly what could happen. While modeling studies show that stratospheric aerosol injection could stop global temperatures from increasing further, our research shows that temperatures locally or regionally might continue to increase over the following few years. This insight is essential for the general public and policymakers to understand so that climate policies are evaluated fairly and interpreted based on the best available science.\n\nRead the full article, “Solar geoengineering might work, but local temperatures could keep rising for years.”\n\nGraphic: Some potential methods limiting the amount of solar energy in the atmosphere.

Professor Scott Denning explains why this is important in his piece for The Conversation, “US Senate ratifies treaty to phase down climate-warming HFCs from refrigerators and air conditioners – but what will replace them this time?”\n\nKevin Yang and Madison Shogrin each received an Outstanding Student Presentation Award from the AMS Collective Madison Meeting Aug. 8-12 in Madison, Wisconsin. Yang earned first place and Shogrin earned second place for their oral presentations during the 16th Conference on Atmospheric Radiation.\n\nYang presented results from a recent paper accepted by Geophysical Research Letters, which focuses on understanding the radiative impact of near-cloud aerosols using a newly developed machine learning-based aerosol retrieval method. Yang said the work highlights the importance of aerosol retrievals in near-cloud regions and need to incorporate the humidification effect in radiative forcing estimates.\n\nYang, who is advised by Professor Christine Chiu, said he was grateful to meet many prestigious scientists at the conference and collect insightful feedback on his work.\n\n“I would like to thank my adviser, Christine, for her tireless support of this research,” Yang said.\n\nShogrin presented new findings on the spatiotemporal variability of the photochemical pollutant peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), based on satellite observations over three megacities: Mexico City, Beijing and Los Angeles.\n\nShogrin, advised by Associate Professor Emily Fischer, was excited to give her first in-person conference presentation.\n\n“I am grateful for the opportunity to represent CSU at this conference and present new science,” she said. “I am also thankful to my adviser, Emily Fischer, and co-authors for their guidance in this project.”\n\nDepartment Head Eric Maloney announced Monday the renaming of the Alumni Award in honor of alumna Maria Silva Dias. The award is given annually to a senior Ph.D. student for outstanding research.\n\nSilva Dias was the first woman to graduate with a Ph.D. from the department, in 1979. She founded the atmospheric science department at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, where she has been a professor for most of her career. She also served as director of the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research.\n\nSilva Dias has done seminal research in tropical convection, South American precipitation and climate, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. She has led numerous South American field campaigns and employed novel numerical modeling approaches.\n\nSilva Dias won the CSU ATS Outstanding Alum award in 2017 and has been recognized nationally and internationally with numerous positions and accolades, including as president of the Brazilian Meteorological Society, member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, and fellow of the American Meteorological Society.\n\nStudents initiated the renaming of the award, and a committee of students, research scientists, and faculty identified a distinguished Ph.D. graduate to be its namesake.\n\n“Maria is excited to receive this honor and plans to be here for the Spring 2023 award ceremony at which this award will be first bestowed,” Maloney said. “We’re excited to celebrate with Maria at that time.”\n\nAssistant Professor Melissa Burt has joined the ADVANCEGeo Partnership to reduce hostile and exclusionary workplace behaviors that contribute to low diversity in the earth and space sciences and other STEM disciplines. The partnership formed in 2017, funded by a National Science Foundation ADVANCE award. Today ADVANCEGeo announced the NSF ADVANCE Program has contributed an additional $1.2 million to expand the partnership’s work.\n\nThe ADVANCEGeo program aims to catalyze behavioral and cultural change through interventions at the individual and collective level, including bystander intervention education and organizationally through the development of ethical codes of conduct that frame harassment, bullying and discrimination as scientific misconduct. The new award will support development of a workplace climate intervention program for academic STEM departments and training programs.\n\nBurt, who is also the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion in the Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering, is one of eight principal investigators from six universities and the American Geophysical Union.\n\nRead the press release, “New NSF funding launches second stage of ADVANCEGeo to transform workplace climate.”\n\nProfessor James Hurrell, who is also the Scott Presidential Chair in Environmental Science and Engineering, was interviewed by Denver television station 9News about Colorado State University’s research on climate intervention.\n\n“No climate scientist is advocating that we do climate intervention at this point in time, but we feel that it’s important to do the research on this,” Hurrell said in the interview.\n\nView the 9News interview and read the article here.\n\nProfessor Elizabeth Barnes was presented with the Professor of the Year award for the 2021-22 academic year during the New Student Welcome Picnic Aug. 31. Atmospheric Science graduate representatives determine the recipient based on which professor received the most feedback for teaching excellence on course evaluations by students.\n\nGraduate representative Emily Gordon presented Barnes with the award, noting that she was the professor most likely to be recommended to other grad students for both her fall and spring courses. She had one of the highest survey response rates.\n\nGordon shared a few excerpts from the surveys:\n\n“She explains things so thoroughly and I felt like I learned so much in her class. The subject she taught I hated in undergrad, but being in her class actually made me appreciate and love dynamics.”\n\nStudents commented on her passion and dedication for teaching and the clarity of her explanations.\n\nBarnes said this award is especially meaningful to her. This is the second time she has been named Professor of the Year; the first time she received the honor was in 2016.\n\nWe welcomed our incoming graduate students with a picnic at Spring Canyon Park on Aug. 31. Following a brief but productive rainstorm, faculty introduced their new students and postdoctoral fellows and shared a little about the research each will be doing.\n\nPhoto of the 2022 incoming class, from left to right: Charles Davis, Mitchell Gregg, Andrew Feder, Leif Fredericks, Angelie Nieves Jiménez, Camille Mavis, Michelle Kanipe, Joshua Quinnett and Ying-Ju Chen.

(Nova, front and center, is not an incoming student but a welcome addition to the group nonetheless. 😉 )\n\nThe American Meteorological Society will recognize three Colorado State University researchers for their outstanding contributions to weather, water and climate science.\n\nElectrical and Computer Engineering Professor V. Chandrasekar will receive the prestigious Verner E. Suomi Technology Medal. Eric Maloney, professor and department head of Atmospheric Science, and Mark DeMaria, senior research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, will be named AMS Fellows.\n\nThe recipients will be honored at the 103rd American Meteorological Society Annual Meeting Jan. 8-12 in Denver.\n\nRead the full Source story, “American Meteorological Society honors three Colorado State University researchers.”\n\nPat Keys, formerly the lead scientist with Colorado State University’s School of Global Environmental Sustainability, has joined the Department of Atmospheric Science as an assistant professor. Keys focuses on climate change impacts and human adaptation, creative scenarios developed through machine learning and science fiction storytelling, and societal interaction with the atmospheric water cycle.\n\nPrior to joining SoGES, Keys founded an environmental consultancy that worked with local and international partners. His fieldwork has taken him all over the world, from exploring climate impacts in Vietnam to documenting indigenous perspectives on conservation in American Samoa. He studied agricultural water policy in Morocco, the link between drought and conflict in sub-Saharan Africa, and municipal responses to extreme heat and wildfire smoke in Fort Collins.\n\nKeys presented the keynote address to the United Nations General Assembly’s 2nd committee in 2019, speaking on the challenges of achieving global sustainability. He is a member of the advisory council for CSU’s Center for Environmental Justice and the African Futures Advisory Board based at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa.\n\nRead the full Source story, “New Atmospheric Science faculty member aims to support forward-thinking education and research around climate change.”\n\nThe American Meteorological Society announced today the recipients of its 2023 awards and honors. Among them is Department Head Eric Maloney, who was named a fellow, and several other scientists with close ties to the department.\n\nAlumnus Mark DeMaria (M.S. 1979, Ph.D. 1983), a CIRA Fellow and senior research scientist, also was named an AMS Fellow. Fellows are elected based on their extensive record of contributions to atmospheric or related sciences. No more than two-tenths of one percent of all AMS members are considered for the honor any given year.\n\nV. Chandrasekar, CIRA Fellow, University Distinguished Professor of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and a close collaborator of the department, was selected for the Verner E. Suomi Technology Medal for leadership in developing techniques to observe precipitation processes using dual-polarization and spaceborne radar.\n\nAlumnus Bruce Albrecht (M.S. 1974, Ph.D. 1977) was awarded the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal, the highest award the society can bestow upon an atmospheric scientist. Albrecht was honored for outstanding contributions to the understanding of the structure or behavior of the atmosphere.\n\nAlumna Julie Demuth (M.S. 2001, Ph.D. 2015) was named the 2023 AMS Walter Orr Roberts Lecturer for groundbreaking interdisciplinary research to improve hazardous weather risk communication and dedicated work promoting the exchange of knowledge across the meteorology and social sciences communities. She also was conferred fellowship. Demuth was selected as an ATS Outstanding Alum in 2020.\n\nAlumna Jennifer Mahoney (M.S. 1992) and alumnus David Changnon (Ph.D. 1991) also were named fellows. Mahoney won the ATS Outstanding Alum Award in 2019.\n\nAll of the 2023 recipients will be recognized at the 103rd AMS Annual Meeting in Denver.\n\nChih-Chi Hu, Allie Mazurek and Marqi Rocque have been selected for ASCENT (Assisting Students, Cultivating Excellence, Nurturing Talent) scholarships to fund international research opportunities. ASCENT is a department program established to enrich the graduate experience.\n\nHu, advised by Professor Peter Jan van Leeuwen, will use the scholarship to collaborate with scientists at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in the United Kingdom to build and test the research group’s newly developed non-Gaussian observation error model into the ECMWF system.\n\n“We hope to improve the all-sky satellite radiances assimilation,” Hu said. He will spend two months in the U.K.\n\nMazurek, advised by Professor Russ Schumacher, will collaborate with scientists at the University of Pretoria and the South African Weather Service on a project related to understanding and forecasting severe convective storms in South Africa.\n\n“I hope to improve short-range predictions of severe hazards, such as tornadoes, in the region, which will help inform my work on forecasting hazardous weather in the U.S.,” Mazurek said.\n\nRocque, advised by Associate Professor Kristen Rasmussen, will work with Professor Rachel Albrecht and her team at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, studying the microphysical and electrical characteristics of severe storms in South America.\n\n“I will learn more about lightning-observing platforms and better understand how the land surface and terrain impact cloud and precipitation processes in the region,” Rocque said. “I hope to witness some of the extreme storms I study in person!”\n\nASCENT grants are funded by donations to the department. Contributions can be made here.\n\nCongratulations to our interns on completing the NSF-funded REU Site in Earth System Science summer research program! The students presented their work from the past 10 weeks in oral presentations Tuesday and a poster session Thursday. The program is coordinated by Assistant Professor Melissa Burt and Senior Research Scientist Charlotte DeMott.\n\nFrom left to right, Tom Juliano, Jennifer Seth, Shay Magahey, Hannah McDaniel, Kenny Tam, Abe Tekoe, Marshall Baldwin, Linda Arterburn and Eli Flicker.\n\nColorado State University hurricane researchers have reduced their forecast slightly but continue to call for an above-average Atlantic hurricane season in 2022, citing the likely persistence of La Niña as a primary factor for the continued anticipation of an active season. Sea surface temperatures averaged across the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean are slightly warmer than normal. A warmer than normal tropical Atlantic provides more fuel for developing storms. However, sea surface temperatures are only slightly above normal, so the forecast team considers this a mostly neutral factor for the remainder of the season.\n\nThe tropical eastern and central Pacific currently has La Niña conditions; that is, the water temperatures are below average. CSU researchers anticipate that these waters will likely remain cooler than normal for the remainder of the Atlantic hurricane season. Consequently, they believe that El Niño is extremely unlikely this year. El Niño tends to increase upper-level westerly winds across the Caribbean into the tropical Atlantic, tearing apart hurricanes as they try to form.\n\nThe primary reason for the reduction in CSU’s forecast from early July was a decrease in the statistical and statistical/dynamical model guidance that underpins these outlooks, along with some anomalous cooling in the subtropical Atlantic. When the subtropical Atlantic is cooler than normal, it can sometimes favor increased shear in the tropics, potentially counteracting some of the reduced shear typically observed in La Niña years.\n\nRead the full Source article, “CSU researchers reduce forecast but continue to predict active 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.”\n\nThis week marks the 25th anniversary of the Spring Creek Flood of July 27-28, 1997, when unprecedented extreme rainfall on the western edge of Fort Collins caused a flash flood that killed five residents and caused $140 million in damages to Colorado State University’s campus.\n\nCSU’s Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering had a unique role in helping the community to move forward after the disaster.\n\nEven as the waters receded from the Engineering building, two of the college’s departments were tapped to help the city understand what had happened, and what could be done to reduce the impact of similar storms in the future.\n\nAtmospheric scientists, who research forecasting, detection and reporting of extreme weather, watched the storm develop from their vantage point on the Foothills Campus. Civil engineers, who study urban infrastructure for flood events, had front row seats as the waters inundated the lower levels of their own building.\n\nNolan Doesken, then assistant state climatologist and later state climatologist for 11 years, recalled that morning clearly. Heavy rains the night before had left the ground saturated. More storms were in the forecast, and one irrigation ditch he passed on the way to the Foothills Campus was already “full to the brim – fuller than I had ever seen it.”\n\nA trusted volunteer had measured an astounding 10 inches of rain in nearby LaPorte. The sophisticated National Weather Service radars in the region showed nothing so remarkable. Faculty in the Atmospheric Science department were puzzled, recalled Doesken. “Where did all that rain come from, and how had it escaped detection by the world’s best national radar system?”\n\nRead the full Source story, “Spring Creek Flood 25 years ago led to a national precipitation network, infrastructure upgrades.”\n\nImage: A rainfall contour map from the storm shows dramatic variation in accumulations across short distances. Image courtesy of Colorado Climate Center.\n\nAssociate Professor Kristen Rasmussen has been recognized by the American Meteorological Society’s Scientific and Technological Activities Commission. Rasmussen received the Outstanding Early Career Award from the AMS Committee on Mountain Meteorology for “advancing the scientific understanding of complex interactions between terrain and convective precipitation.” The award is given to early career scientists who have made significant contributions to the discipline and are on a path to becoming science leaders in the community.\n\n“I am deeply honored to receive this award, as it represents the community I have been part of since I was an early-stage graduate student,” Rasmussen said. “In fact, my first conference presentation was at an AMS Mountain Meteorology conference, so this award is particularly meaningful for me.”\n\nThe AMS Mountain Meteorology STAC committee presented Rasmussen with the award at the 20th Conference on Mountain Meteorology at the end of June. The Scientific and Technological Activities Commission (STAC) is composed of committees and boards, which are made up of hundreds of volunteers who are primarily AMS members.\n\nWhile climate change is taking effect everywhere on Earth, the Arctic Circle is feeling those effects most of all, in the form of glacial melt, permafrost thaw and sea ice decline.\n\nKey players in climate change include the clouds that cover the Earth’s surface and the microscopic, airborne aerosols called ice nucleating particles that seed the formation of ice in those clouds. This dance of ice nucleation, cloud cover and heat all have major roles in climate. But those all-important ice-creating aerosols, which can be mineral dust, microbes or sea spray, have scarcely been studied in the Arctic ­– where they need to be studied most of all – because little is known about their effects there, and not many scientists venture that far north.\n\nColorado State University scientists did, though. In 2019, an intrepid team including atmospheric research scientist Jessie Creamean boarded a ship, sailed north, gathered thousands of air, seawater, sea ice, snow and meltwater samples, and brought home the physical evidence needed to determine exactly how ice nucleation and clouds over the Arctic Ocean ebb and flow over time.\n\nRead the full Source story, “Air samples from Arctic region show how fast Earth is warming.”\n\nPhoto of the Polarstern in the Arctic by Lianna Nixon.\n\nMilky seas – the rare phenomenon of glowing areas on the ocean’s surface that can cover thousands of square miles – are not new to scientists at Colorado State University. They have previously demonstrated the use of satellites to see these elusive phenomena. What was missing were photographic observations of milky seas observed from the Earth’s surface and from space at the same time.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIn a new paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Steven Miller, professor in the Department of Atmospheric Science and director of CSU’s Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, compares satellite observations of a 2019 milky sea event off the coast of Java to photographic evidence from the sailing ship Ganesha, a 16-meter private yacht. The yacht happened to be sailing in the milky seas at the same time. Unsure of what they had encountered, the yacht’s crew provided CSU their enlightening footage after learning of its expertise in satellite observations, and Miller’s particular interest in capturing milky seas from space.\n\nRead the full Source story, “CSU researcher links real encounter with ‘milky seas’ to satellite pictures.”\n\nImage above: A 100,000-square-kilometer bioluminescent milky sea south of Java, as seen from space on Aug. 2, 2019, and from the Earth’s surface by the private yacht Ganesha.

Faculty, former department heads, students and staff honored Collett’s leadership and character in a ceremony at the Atmospheric Science campus.\n\n“Our department is widely considered a world leader in no small part due to what Jeff has helped build over the last decade,” Maloney said. “He has provided creative, inspirational and visionary leadership through both good and extremely challenging times over the last 11 years that will be hard to match.”\n\nCollett hired 13 faculty members, more than half of the department’s total faculty. About half are women, increasing the number of women faculty from two to eight. He considers bringing so many outstanding faculty to the program a highlight of his career.\n\nRead the full Source story, “Department of Atmospheric Science honors Jeff Collett’s 11 years as department head.”\n\nPostdoctoral researcher Frances Davenport wrote this piece for The Conversation.

As the rain and meltwater poured into creeks and then rivers, it became a flood that damaged roads, cabins and utilities and forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate.\n\nThe Yellowstone River shattered its previous record and reached its highest water levels recorded since monitoring began almost 100 years ago.\n\nAlthough floods are a natural occurrence, human-caused climate change is making severe flooding events like this more common. I study how climate change affects hydrology and flooding. In mountainous regions, three effects of climate change in particular are creating higher flood risks: more intense precipitation, shifting snow and rain patterns, and the effects of wildfires on the landscape.\n\nRead the full article, “Climate change is making flooding worse: 3 reasons the world is seeing more record-breaking deluges.”\n\nImage at top: Fast-moving floodwater obliterated sections of major roads through Yellowstone National Park in June 2022. Jacob W. Frank/National Park Service\n\nKimberley Corwin, Gabrielle “Bee” Leung and Chen-Kuang “Kevin” Yang have been selected for the Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) program. FINESST awards funding for research projects that are designed and executed by graduate students and contribute to NASA’s science, technology and exploration goals. Corwin’s, Leung’s and Yang’s proposals were three of 62 selected from 394 submitted to the Earth Science Division, out of 932 proposals overall. The grant may be applied for up to three years.\n\nCorwin and her adviser, Associate Professor Emily Fischer, will research how wildfire smoke impacts solar energy generation in the U.S. using a combination of satellite observations, radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry models, solar energy production datasets, and solar resource models. They will assess the historical exposure of solar resources to smoke and quantify associated changes in solar generation. Using estimates of future fire emissions that account for different climate, population and emissions scenarios, they will estimate changes to surface shortwave radiation and compare these results to solar energy capacity and cost projections across the U.S.\n\n“We need to make sure that solar forecasting accounts for how wildfire smoke will affect solar panels, especially as wildfires grow larger and more frequent with climate change,” Corwin said. “I’m excited for the opportunity to work on an important interdisciplinary question and thankful for the support provided by NASA FINESST.”\n\nLeung will work with her adviser, University Distinguished Professor Sue van den Heever, to understand how changes to land surface, for example through deforestation or urbanization, impact tropical cloud properties in conjunction with changes to the aerosol environment. They will focus on the Maritime Continent, a region of the world undergoing rapid changes to both land cover and aerosol emissions.\n\n“There is still a lot of disagreement about whether land-cover changes in the region would increase or decrease precipitation overall,” Leung said. “It’s a very complicated problem, since changing the land cover consists of simultaneous changes to many physical parameters, such as latent and sensible heat fluxes, surface roughness and convergence, and aerosol sources.”\n\nThey will use a combination of satellite observations, realistic region-scale modeling and idealized large eddy simulations to quantify the magnitude of aerosol-land surface impacts on convection and explore the mechanisms driving those impacts.\n\nYang and his adviser, Associate Professor Christine Chiu, will assess the role of near-cloud aerosols in the radiation budget using retrievals from 3D radiative transfer and machine learning. They will develop a new method that incorporates 3D cloud radiative effects and aerosol hygroscopic growth for retrieving near-cloud aerosol properties, using shortwave reflectance observations from MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite instrument). The project is expected to provide new global and regional estimates of aerosol direct radiative effects that include near-cloud aerosols for the first time. They also will exploit the new aerosol retrievals to study the variability of aerosol direct radiative effects with organizations of shallow cumulus and to understand the implication for a warmer climate.\n\n“This research tackles the outstanding issue in the aerosol remote sensing community and could potentially change the current state of the aerosol direct radiative effect estimate,” Yang said. “I am very excited and grateful for the opportunity from NASA FINESST to do such exciting work.”\n\nThree Colorado State University experts on science communication – Ashley Anderson, Nicole Kelp and our own Melissa Burt – explain why it’s important to humanize scientists in this Q&A about climate change, misinformation and social media.\n\n“Spewing data and facts alone will not change people’s perceptions and oftentimes deters them. We need to meet our audiences where they are and figure out a way to talk about issues in a way that matters to them and addresses their values.” – Assistant Professor Melissa Burt\n\nRead the article, “Raise Your Voice: Three pioneers in science communication tackle climate change, misinformation, and social media.”\n\nPhoto above: Ashley Anderson, Nicole Kelp and Melissa Burt are professors and parents.

By identifying the key physical processes and environmental ingredients that cause high-intensity, long-duration rain events, their goal is to improve models for forecasters and eventually save lives.\n\nThe team is led by Michael Bell and Kristen Rasmussen, both faculty members in the Department of Atmospheric Science, and includes collaborators from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, seven other U.S. academic institutions and several international partners in Taiwan, Japan and Korea. The $6 million-plus field campaign is supported by the National Science Foundation and is called PRECIP, or Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign in the Pacific. Data collection began in late May and will continue through August.\n\nRead the full Source article, “CSU atmospheric scientists lead summer field campaign in Taiwan to study extreme rainfall.”\n\nPhoto at top: Erin Dougherty of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (and ATS 2020 graduate) tweeted this photo of the CSU SEA-POL radar being set up in Yonaguni, Japan.\n\nUniversity Distinguished Professor Sonia Kreidenweis will serve as interim Dean of the Graduate School and Vice Provost for Graduate Affairs until the appointment of a new dean to replace Mary Stromberger. Kreidenweis will begin in the interim role following Dean Stromberger’s last day on July 1.\n\nKreidenweis is a University Distinguished Professor of atmospheric science and serves as Executive Associate Dean in the Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering, where she also previously served as Research Associate Dean. She joined Colorado State University in 1991 to initiate the atmospheric chemistry program in the Department of Atmospheric Science. Kreidenweis is co-PI of the NSF Biology Integration Institute award to CSU, focused on the role of biological aerosols in ecology and climate.\n\nAdditionally, she has served on several NAS/NRC Committees, including the 2017 Decadal Survey Panel on Climate Variability and Change: Seasonal to Centennial. Kreidenweis is a past president and Fellow of the American Association for Aerosol Research, a past member of the executive committee and a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, and a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union.\n\nRead Provost and Executive Vice President Mary Pedersen’s message to the CSU community.\n\nAndrey Marsavin has been selected to receive a scholarship from the Rocky Mountain States Section of the Air and Waste Management Association. The scholarship is awarded to a deserving graduate student to advance air quality studies.\n\nMarsavin, who is a member of Professor Jeff Collett’s research group, will use the funding to study air quality issues in national parks. The group is investigating the impact of oil and natural gas developments on ozone pollution in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico.\n\n“I’m grateful to the A&WMA for supporting my research in air quality and atmospheric chemistry,” Marsavin said. “It’s reassuring to receive such recognition as a new graduate student, and I owe a lot of gratitude to my professors and mentors.”\n\nColorado State University hurricane researchers have increased their forecast and now predict a well above-average Atlantic hurricane season in 2022. The odds of El Niño for this year’s hurricane season are now quite low, and the odds of La Niña conditions have increased relative to what was projected with the initial outlook in early April.\n\nSea surface temperatures averaged across the tropical Atlantic are now warmer than normal, while the eastern Atlantic is much warmer than normal. This type of sea surface temperature configuration is considered quite favorable for an active 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe tropical eastern and central Pacific currently has weak La Niña conditions; that is, the water temperatures there are somewhat below average. CSU researchers anticipate that these waters will likely remain slightly (e.g., cool neutral ENSO) to somewhat below normal (e.g., La Niña) for the Atlantic hurricane season. They believe that El Niño is extremely unlikely this year.

And this student has demonstrated all of these three from day one,” Chiu said in her introduction before revealing Yang as the winner.\n\nThe Herbert Riehl Memorial Award honors the department’s founder. It recognizes an M.S. or beginning Ph.D. student who has submitted the best technical manuscript in the past 18 months.\n\nThe Alumni Award recognizes outstanding Ph.D. research by a senior student.\n\nProfessor Michael Bell, Cha’s adviser, nominated her for the paper, “Polygonal Eyewall Asymmetries During the Rapid Intensification of Hurricane Michael (2018).”\n\n“This was outstanding work both in terms of observational analysis and theoretical analysis,” Bell said.\n\nCha’s paper was selected as an Editors’ Highlight by Geophysical Research Letters and earned her third place in the Peter B. Wagner Memorial Award for Women in Atmospheric Sciences competition.\n\nCha will participate in the PRECIP campaign in Taiwan this summer. Following her graduation in the fall, she will continue her research at the National Center for Atmospheric Research through an Advanced Study Program Postdoctoral Fellowship.\n\nYang and Cha will present their research at the first colloquium of fall semester.\n\nThe department celebrated spring and summer graduates with a hybrid in-person and Zoom ceremony May 6. Advisers shared information about each graduate, and family and friends were able to attend.\n\nWe asked our graduating students about their plans following graduation and the most important thing they learned at CSU. Here are their responses.\n\nChloe Boehm\n\n“I am staying here to work on my Ph.D.!”\n\n“How important a great support system is and to always remain eager to learn from others.”\n\nEllie Casas\n\n“I’ll be going to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA to do a postdoc with Scott Powell (a postdoc here a few years ago). My specific projects are currently TBD, but they will probably be some combination of shallow to deep cumulus convection and/or machine learning.”\n\n“The most important thing I learned at CSU is how important a strong sense of community is for persistence, professional growth, and career satisfaction. I was fortunate to have been offered multiple opportunities due to the strong community at CSU, and I learned the hard way via the pandemic that research is much more satisfying when you can easily share it with others.”\n\nAli Cole\n\n“I’m joining CPP Wind Engineering Consultants as an atmospheric scientist!”\n\n“The most important thing I learned at CSU is the value of having a variety of backgrounds and viewpoints in any scenario. Everyone approaches situations differently, be it research or otherwise, and having that variety of perspectives is invaluable.”\n\nJacob Escobedo\n\n“Defense for master’s on May 16, planning on staying at CSU working with Russ Schumacher to pursue my Ph.D.”\n\n“I cannot control the unexpected, but I can control how I respond to it.”\n\nMegan Franke\n\n“My future plans are to finish up my master’s and defend next month! Plans for after graduation are still being decided but leaning towards staying for a Ph.D.”\n\n“The most important thing I learned while being here at CSU is to not be afraid to ask for help! I have heard it all my life, but never really lived it until coming here….also coding :)”\n\nEric Goldenstern\n\n“I’ll be sticking around at the department for my Ph.D.”\n\n“The most important thing I’ve learned at CSU is that nothing is ever perfect… just good enough for the moment.”\n\nJustin Hudson\n\n“I will be staying at CSU for my Ph.D. and joining Steve Miller’s group to study milky sea events in the Indian Ocean.”\n\n“How to deal with everything changing all at once.”\n\nNicole June\n\n“I will be continuing into the Ph.D. program in Jeff Pierce’s group.”\n\n“The most important thing I’ve learned so far is the importance of priorities and a support system.”\n\nEmily Lachemayer\n\n“I am taking a break from academia and heading to industry.”\n\n“How to systematically approach and implement concepts that are outside of my comfort zone.”\n\nLilly Naimie\n\n“I am staying in Jeff Collett’s group here in Atmos to pursue a Ph.D.!”\n\n“I learned how important balance is; to work hard and take the time to go for a bike ride.”\n\nMike Natoli\n\n“I am now working at NWS Cheyenne.”\n\n“This was a tough one to answer since I’ve learned and grown as a person so much in my time at CSU, but to try to pick one thing, I’d say recognizing the importance of collaboration, sharing of knowledge, and a supportive environment in achieving personal and academic goals.”\n\nSam O’Donnell\n\n“I’ll be staying on for a Ph.D.! I’ll be working on some tangential topics to my M.S. research.”\n\n“Being here during COVID-19 taught me the importance of social connection (while social distancing), and work-life balance. Also, aerosol particles are awesome!”\n\nSagar Rathod\n\n“I accepted a Postdoctoral Research Associate position at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Public Affairs department.”\n\n“In terms of academics, I appreciate the ‘always look at the big picture’ I learned from Tami and Jeff. In terms of life, I would say my experience with DEI initiatives across the campus is something I will definitely take from here.”\n\nRick Schulte\n\n“I will be starting a postdoc at CSU working on the CloudSat and INCUS missions.”\n\n“Ask around before tackling a tough problem, because someone else has probably already attempted it and has knowledge to share.”\n\nPhoto collage, from left to right, top to bottom row: Chloe Boehm, Lee Brent, Ellie Casas, Ali Cole, Jacob Escobedo, Megan Franke, Eric Goldenstern, Justin Hudson, Nicole June, Emily Lachenmayer, Lilly Naimie, Mike Natoli, Sam O’Donnell, Sagar Rathod and Rick Schulte.\n\nSpring 2022 Graduates\n\nChloe Boehm M.S.

But our planet is an incredible system in which energy, water, carbon and so much else flows and nurtures life. It is about 4.5 billion years old and has been through enormous changes.\n\nAt some points in Earth’s history, fires burned over large areas. At others, much of it was covered with ice. There also have been mass extinctions that wiped out nearly every living thing on its surface.\n\nOur living planet is incredibly resilient and can heal itself over time. The problem is that its self-healing systems are very, very slow. The Earth will be fine, but humans’ problems are more immediate.\n\nRead the full article, “Is it possible to heal the damage we have already done to the Earth?“\n\nImage at top: The Earth viewed from the Apollo 8 lunar mission on Dec. 24, 1968.

Colorado State award winners in Source.\n\nColorado State University hurricane researchers are predicting an active Atlantic hurricane season in 2022, citing the likely absence of El Niño as a primary factor. Tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures are near their long-term averages, while Caribbean and subtropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures are warmer than their long-term averages. The warmer Caribbean and eastern part of the subtropical Atlantic also favor an active 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe tropical Pacific currently has weak La Niña conditions, that is, water temperatures are somewhat cooler than normal in the eastern and central tropical Pacific. While La Niña may weaken and transition to neutral conditions by this summer, the CSU researchers do not currently anticipate El Niño for the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. El Niño tends to increase upper-level westerly winds across the Caribbean into the tropical Atlantic, tearing apart hurricanes as they try to form.\n\nWhile tropical Atlantic water temperatures are currently near their long-term averages, the warmer-than-normal subtropical eastern Atlantic typically forces a weaker subtropical high and associated weaker winds blowing across the tropical Atlantic. These conditions then lead to warmer waters in the tropical Atlantic for the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nRead the full Source article, “CSU researchers predicting active 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.”\n\nDaniel Hueholt has been selected for a prestigious National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in STEM disciplines who are pursuing research-based master’s and doctoral degrees at accredited U.S. institutions. The five-year fellowship includes three years of financial support.\n\nHueholt will use the funding to investigate rapid detection of the climate response to solar climate intervention using explainable artificial intelligence.\n\n“The GRFP also will allow me the freedom to explore all of the new ideas we uncover along the way,” Hueholt said. “I am very grateful for the help and advice I received in preparing my application. I particularly want to thank my advisers Jim Hurrell and Elizabeth Barnes, my fellow Barnes group members Kirsten Mayer and Charlotte Connolly, and CSU’s GRFP application editing program. I’m so excited to see what the next three years bring!”\n\nAmanda Bowden and Spencer Hill received NSF GRFP honorable mentions.\n\nColorado State University researchers will receive nearly $1 million from the Environmental Protection Agency to expand air quality monitoring in communities impacted by wildfires and improve communication of health risks from smoke exposure.\n\nResearchers will work with community partners throughout Colorado to add low-cost air quality monitors in places that aren’t currently monitored. They will create real-time, high-resolution maps to help people understand air pollution in their community and make decisions to minimize smoke exposure.\n\nEmily Fischer, associate professor of atmospheric science, will lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists from the Departments of Atmospheric Science, Journalism and Media Communication, and Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences.\n\nRead the full Source article, “EPA funds research to improve air quality monitoring, health risk communication.”\n\nProfessor Jeff Pierce is co-PI on a Global Challenges Research Team selected for funding by the CSU School of Global Environmental Sustainability (SoGES). The team will investigate wildfire smoke impacts on U.S. solar energy resources and agrivoltaic systems. Associate Professor Emily Fischer and Ph.D. candidate Kimberley Corwin also will contribute to the project.\n\nRead more about the project.\n\nIn honor of Women’s History Month, Colorado State University produced a video about Professor Sue van den Heever and her distinction as the first woman to lead a NASA Earth Venture Mission. The mission, INCUS, is a $177 million project that will study storms in the tropics, to improve weather and climate models.\n\nAssistant Professor Kristen Rasmussen has been selected for the Nelson Family Faculty Excellence Award through the Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering. The award recognizes exceptional performance and effective student engagement in teaching and research.\n\nPeggy and Jim Nelson created the award to advance the careers of outstanding mid-career engineering faculty and foster international collaborations. Funding from the award will help support Rasmussen’s activities for three years.\n\nRasmussen is an award-winning adviser and nationally recognized leader in mesoscale meteorology. She has actively engaged her students and students from other universities in international research through the RELAMPAGO campaign in Argentina and the upcoming PRECIP campaign in Taiwan. Rasmussen has made significant contributions to the department’s curriculum by developing a new course on mountain meteorology and contributing to a course on social responsibility in atmospheric science.\n\n“I am honored to receive this award and grateful to the Nelson family for their generous support in enhancing international collaborations in my group’s research and education activities,” Rasmussen said. “This award will provide new opportunities for students to participate in international field research and collaborations.”\n\nClimate scientist Elizabeth Barnes uses neural networks and explainable artificial intelligence to answer pressing questions about Earth’s climate. These cutting-edge, machine-learning methods help unravel the complexity of the Earth system, but they can be difficult to comprehend.\n\nBarnes wanted to break down these concepts in a few easy-to-understand videos, so she commissioned an artist to visually communicate her group’s research.\n\n“When you watch these videos, it becomes clear that our work is rooted in the fundamentals of climate science – we just use AI as a tool for exploring the data,” said Barnes, an associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Science.\n\nRead the full Source story, “Atmospheric scientist explains complex climate research through animations.”\n\nView the videos on the Barnes group website.\n\nProfessor Emeritus Bill Cotton wrote this piece for The Conversation. Colorado State University is a contributing institution to The Conversation, an independent collaboration between editors and academics that provides informed news analysis and commentary to the general public.\n\nOn mountain peaks scattered across Colorado, machines are set up to fire chemicals into the clouds in attempts to generate snow. The process is called cloud seeding, and as global temperatures rise, more countries and drought-troubled states are using it in sometimes desperate efforts to modify the weather.\n\nBut cloud seeding isn’t as simple as it sounds, and it might not be as promising as people wish.\n\nAs an atmospheric scientist, I have studied and written about weather modification for 50 years. Cloud seeding experiments that produce snow or rain require the right kind of clouds with enough moisture, and the right temperature and wind conditions. The percentage increases in precipitation are small, and it’s difficult to tell when snow or rain fell naturally and when it was triggered by seeding.\n\nRead the full article, “Cloud seeding might not be as promising as drought-troubled states hope.”\n\nPhoto at top: Cloud-seeding equipment near Winter Park in Colorado.

Dietrich Honorary Scholarship and Ting-Yu Cha received the Shrake-Culler Scholarship. After announcement of their awards, Moore and Cha each briefly presented their work.\n\nMoore’s advisers, University Distinguished Professor Sonia Kreidenweis and Senior Research Scientist Paul DeMott, nominated her for the Dietrich Scholarship based on her academic achievement and her skills as an aerosol scientist. Moore works at the intersection of air quality and climate science. During her M.S. studies, she participated in one of the most comprehensive sets of aerosol measurements ever collected over the Southern Ocean, sailing on a ship from Tasmania to the edge of Antarctica. She was responsible for the quality control of all the aerosol measurements on that voyage. Moore has participated in a wide variety of other studies as well.\n\n“There is virtually no project that our group has done in the last three or four years that she hasn’t assisted in one manner or another, and that’s reflected in about 18 co-authored publications already at this stage of her graduate studies,” DeMott said in presenting the award.\n\nThe Dietrich Scholarship recognizes a CSU student who has demonstrated outstanding ability in air quality research and education. Fort Collins-based Air Resource Specialists Inc. funds the Dietrich Scholarship each year. It is given in honor of retired ARS President David Dietrich.\n\nCha was nominated by her adviser, Professor Michael Bell, based on her strong work ethic and enthusiasm for higher education. Her primary research is on radar and tropical meteorology. One of Cha’s papers was selected by the American Geophysical Union as an Editors’ Highlight, a designation given to fewer than 2 percent of AGU journal articles. It also won third place in the Peter B. Wagner Memorial Award for Women in Atmospheric Sciences competition.\n\n“She’s one of the hardest working students I’ve known,” Bell said. “In evidence of her enthusiasm for higher education, she took a high-performance computing class on main campus in C++. She was the only female student in the class, the only atmospheric science student, and she got an A. I think she might have gotten the highest grade in the class.”\n\nBell noted that Cha was instrumental in the PRECIP campaign. “She’s one of the top students I’ve worked with over the years,” he said.\n\nThe Shrake-Culler Scholarship is given annually to a senior Ph.D. student. The student must have passed their preliminary exam, have a GPA of 3.5 or above, and demonstrate a strong work ethic and enthusiasm for higher education.\n\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was above average – in line with forecasts issued by Colorado State University’s Tropical Meteorology Project. Twenty-one named storms formed in 2021 (the third most on record), with seven of these storms becoming hurricanes and four reaching major hurricane strength. The average Atlantic hurricane season has 14 named storms, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. Seven named storms and two hurricanes made landfall in the continental United States, with Hurricane Ida striking the central Louisiana coast as a Category 4 hurricane. In addition to devastating winds and storm surge damage near where Ida made landfall, heavy rain from the hurricane’s remnants also brought catastrophic flooding to the mid-Atlantic states.\n\n“The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was above average, especially when evaluated by named storm frequency. Overall, our seasonal forecasts did an excellent job of predicting an above-average season, with predictions of hurricanes, major hurricanes and Accumulated Cyclone Energy being very close to what actually occurred,” said Phil Klotzbach, lead author of the forecast. Accumulated Cyclone Energy is an integrated metric accounting for intensity and duration of storms. Seasonal Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) was approximately 120% of the 1991-2020 average.\n\nThe report summarizes all tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic basin during the 2021 hurricane season and compares the team’s seasonal and two-week forecasts to what occurred.\n\nRead the full Source article, “CSU researchers correctly predicted above-average 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.”\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin professor and director of the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies Tristan L’Ecuyer was selected as the 2021 recipient of the department’s Outstanding Alum Award. He will receive the award and present a seminar on his work Dec. 9 at ATS.\n\nL’Ecuyer earned his Ph.D. from the department in 2001, under the supervision of Graeme Stephens, who is now a professor emeritus. His dissertation was “Uncertainties in Space-Based Estimates of Clouds and Precipitation: Implications for Deriving Global Diabatic Heating.”\n\nFollowing his Ph.D., L’Ecuyer spent a decade at CSU as a postdoc and research scientist, working extensively on the CloudSat mission. He then joined the faculty of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nSince 2018, L’Ecuyer has served as director of Wisconsin’s Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS). In 2020, he led the successful re-competition of CIMSS, ensuring the continuation of this crucial partnership with NOAA in satellite meteorology.\n\nL’Ecuyer’s research lies at the intersection of satellite remote sensing and climate science. He has published more than 150 papers, and his work is widely cited.\n\nL’Ecuyer runs an active research program, including current leadership of the NASA Earth Venture-Instrument PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far Infrared Experiment).\n\nHe has graduated nine Ph.D. students in his first decade at Wisconsin and continues to advise a large research group. In 2020, he was honored with the American Geophysical Union Ascent Award.\n\nNote from Tristan:\n\nI want to express my genuine appreciation to everyone in the Department of Atmospheric Science for recognizing me with the Outstanding Alum Award. It is an honor to be counted among the long list of very accomplished scientists that graduated from our department. I am and always will be proud to be a CSU Ram!\n\nI owe my interest in atmospheric science and my enthusiasm for pushing the envelope of what global observations can tell us about our environment to my time at CSU and my adviser Graeme Stephens. Coming from a theoretical physics background, ATS gave me my first true taste of the atmospheric and climate science fields.\n\nI still remember discussing elements of Earth’s energy budget in my first meeting with Graeme. Little did I know I’d still be trying to refine estimates of those quantities more than two decades later! From being able to independently explore ideas to opportunities to interact with leaders in the field, my experience at CSU has been fundamental to shaping my career.\n\nI am also indebted to the many great students and long list of collaborators I’ve been fortunate to work with since leaving the Foothills Campus. I’m especially grateful for my students. This award is really recognition of their hard work, and they, in turn, benefit from ATS as I pass on the lessons I learned during my time at CSU.\n\nIt is especially rewarding to now be able to highly recommend the ATS graduate program to our best undergraduate students here at Wisconsin. I hope I’ve prepared them for graduate school as well as CSU prepared me for my career!\n\nSincerely,\n\nTristan L’Ecuyer\n\nNASA has announced a $177 million Earth science mission led by Colorado State University that will study the behavior of storms in the Tropics, with the goal of better representing these storms in weather and climate models.\n\nThe mission will be a collection of three small satellites, flying in tight coordination, and is called Investigation of Convective Updrafts (INCUS). It is expected to launch in 2027 as part of NASA’s Earth Venture Program.\n\nINCUS’ principal investigator is Susan van den Heever, professor in the Department of Atmospheric Science, whose expertise is in cloud physics, cloud dynamics, and mesoscale meteorology and modeling. The team includes Kristen Rasmussen, assistant professor in atmospheric science; and Steven Reising, professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. CSU’s Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere will perform data processing for the mission, overseen by Phil Partain.\n\nRead the full Source article, “CSU atmospheric scientists lead $177 million NASA mission to study thunderstorms in the Tropics.”\n\nResearchers in Colorado State University’s Department of Atmospheric Science have developed a tool for predicting heavy rainfall that is now used daily by the Weather Prediction Center, part of the National Weather Service.\n\nBy working with the Weather Prediction Center over the past several years, Associate Professor Russ Schumacher and his group were able to tailor the tool to suit forecasters’ needs.\n\nRead the full Source article, “From research to real world: CSU atmospheric scientists develop heavy rainfall forecast tool used nationwide.”\n\nImage at top: Example CSU-MLP forecast, for the extreme rainfall associated with the remnants of Hurricane Ida in the mid-Atlantic states in September 2021. The left panel shows the forecast probability of excessive rainfall, available on the morning of Aug. 31, over a day in advance of the event. The forecast includes a “high risk” (probability exceeding 50%) for an area from Maryland through Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. The right panel shows the resulting observations of excessive rainfall (including flash flood reports and rainfall totals exceeding specified thresholds). The CSU-MLP correctly highlighted the corridor where widespread heavy rain and flooding would occur.\n\nFour Colorado State University researchers in earth and atmospheric sciences are among new Fellows of the American Geophysical Union who have “made outstanding achievements and contributions by pushing the frontiers of our science forward.” AGU is a 62,000-member organization of Earth, atmospheric, ocean, hydrologic, space, and planetary scientists formed in 1919.\n\nAGU Fellows serve as global leaders and experts who have propelled the world’s understanding of geosciences. Since 1962, AGU has elected fewer than 0.1% of its members to join its group of fellows.\n\nElizabeth Barnes, associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Science, was honored with the AGU James B. Macelwane Medal for early-career scientists this year, for which she was also conferred the title of fellow.\n\nRead the full Source article, “American Geophysical Union honors four CSU researchers as 2021 fellows.”\n\nThree Colorado State University atmospheric scientists have been recognized by the American Geophysical Union. Associate Professor Elizabeth Barnes was selected for the James B. Macelwane Medal, Senior Research Scientist Paul DeMott has been elected a Fellow, and Professor Emeritus Wayne Schubert was chosen to deliver the Jule Gregory Charney Lecture. They will be honored at the AGU Fall Meeting Dec. 15 in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nEarly-career excellence\n\nBarnes will receive the Macelwane Medal for “significant contributions to the geophysical sciences by an outstanding early career scientist.” Along with the medal, the AGU also will confer fellowship to Barnes.\n\nDeMott’s work ‘groundbreaking and influential’\n\nDeMott, an international leader in the study of ice nucleation and aerosol-cloud interactions, was elected an AGU Fellow for his research achievements and outstanding contributions to the field.\n\nMaking the complex understandable\n\nThe Charney Lecture is presented to a prominent scientist who has made exceptional contributions to the understanding of weather and climate. Schubert, now retired from teaching but not research after 47 years with the department, has made pioneering discoveries in his research of tropical cyclones, moist convection, and the dynamics of mesoscale and synoptic-scale phenomena.\n\nRead the full Source article, “American Geophysical Union honors atmospheric scientists Elizabeth Barnes, Paul DeMott, Wayne Schubert.”\n\nAmy Sullivan, Ilana Pollack, Associate Professor Emily Fischer and Professor Jeff Pierce will study urban emissions and air quality as part of $2.2 million in grants received by CSU researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe Climate Program Office at NOAA has announced research funding that increases understanding of emissions – and chemical transformation of those emissions – in the urban atmosphere. Four of the 10 new projects have gone to Colorado State University researchers, totaling over $2.2 million to CSU.\n\nThe federal research program, called Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle, and Climate, competitively selected projects that total $5.48 million in grants.\n\nRead the full Source article, “Emissions, air quality and heat in urban areas: CSU researchers receive over $2.2 million.”\n\nEmily Fischer, associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Science and a Colorado State University Monfort Professor, has received the Jon C. Graff, Ph.D. Prize for Excellence in Science Communication from the Society for Science.\n\nThe Society for Science is a nonprofit organization that promotes the understanding and appreciation of science and the vital role it plays in human advancement.\n\nNow in its third year, the award is given to one scientist included in the Science News SN 10, a list spotlighting 10 early- and mid-career scientists on their way to widespread acclaim. The Society for Science publishes both Science News and Science News for Students.\n\nIn 2021, rather than identify new scientists, Science News spotlighted 10 noteworthy SN 10 alumni. Fischer, who was included in the 2020 SN 10 list, was featured in the Oct. 9 special edition of Science News and will be featured again in the Oct. 23 edition.\n\nRead the full Source article, “Emily Fischer to receive Jon C. Graff, Ph.D. Prize for Excellence in Science Communication.”\n\nProfessor David Randall wrote this piece for The Conversation. Colorado State University is a contributing institution to The Conversation, an independent collaboration between editors and academics that provides informed news analysis and commentary to the general public.\n\nAs a climate scientist myself, I was excited to learn that Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize for Physics. I first met Manabe when I was a graduate student in the early 1970s, so I was particularly pleased that the prize recognizes the profound importance of Manabe’s decadeslong work on the creation of climate models, as well as the application of those models to understand how increasing levels of greenhouse gases have led to global warming.\n\nHow complicated is the weather and climate system?\n\nWeather is what you see hour to hour and day to day. Weather involves just the atmosphere. Climate is the average weather over decades and is influenced by the oceans and the land surfaces.\n\nWeather and climate are complicated because they involve many different physical processes – from the motion of air to the flow of electromagnetic radiation, such as sunlight, to the condensation of water vapor – across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.\n\nRead the full article, “Winners of 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics built mathematic"
