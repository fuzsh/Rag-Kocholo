        "text": "2021\n\nBob White - Player – Florence, AZ\n\nBob White excelled as a Fast Pitch softball player for more than twenty years during the 70’s and 80’s – often thought of as the golden age of Men’s Fast Pitch in Nebraska. He was widely respected as one of the best catchers of his era, helping his pitchers by knowing the opposing hitter’s weaknesses, calling the right pitch, and setting the right targets for them. He was also known for his legendary ability to get a bunt down and advance a runner in many critical situations. Bob also hit for average, touting a lifetime average of .310 while playing at the top level of competition during his entire career. He earned several tournament MVP and All-Star awards.\n\nBob played in Lincoln for the Stan’s Lounge, Bouwens Plumbing and Snyder Industries teams who won eight league titles, two state championships and were very competitive in several ASA Regional tournaments. He is fondly remembered as a great teammate and an ambassador of the game.\n\nRyan Elrod - Player - Omaha, NE\n\nRyan Elrod is one of the greatest Slow Pitch players to ever play the game in Nebraska. While he excelled playing defense, he was feared when at the plate. He possessed the speed to cover the ground needed to make a defensive play in the outfield and an arm that was both strong and accurate. As a hitter, he hit for both average and power. In fact, many regard Ryan Elrod as THE best power hitter that has ever come from the state of Nebraska. Here are some of his accomplishments: lifetime batting average of .685, 1145 career home runs, named to 11 straight Al Hawthorne league all-star games (and named MVP in five of those 11), led the Hawthorne league in home runs in eight of ten years, won 10 gold glove awards and won the batting title five times.\n\nRyan played for Prospector, The Steakhouse and T’s 13 during his Nebraska career. During his days with The Steakhouse, his team won six Nebraska ASA state titles. While playing for T’s 13, he was part of the team that won the 1997 ASA Class A National Championship held in Florida. Ryan was named 1st team All American in that tournament while batting .845 with 18 home runs.\n\nRoni Wobken - Commissioner - Scribner, NE\n\nFor 30 years Roni Wobken has served USA Softball of Nebraska as a Commissioner. Her dedication to the sport, and service to all the teams that have counted on her for guidance, communication, support, and advice, uniquely qualifies her for being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Roni has served USA Softball as a District Commissioner, Chairperson of the Scholarship Committee, and currently holds the position of State Junior Olympic Commissioner.\n\nHer passion and love for the game is without parallel. Outside of her service to USA Softball, she has given countless pitching lessons and softball clinics, coached numerous youth softball teams, was instrumental in building the Scribner softball complex, and helped start the high school softball program at Logan View. Despite all these accomplishments, she will best be remembered and admired by those who have crossed her path for the positive influence she has had on so many lives.\n\nLee Faaborg - Manager – Grand Island, NE\n\nLee Faaborg managed Men’s Fast Pitch teams for over 25 years in Grand Island, NE. Between Class B, Class C and Men’s 40-over divisions, Lee’s teams have won 16 league titles, 11 state tournaments, 2 regional tournaments and 1 national championship (in Hastings in 2001). His career won-loss record, with Home Federal and Time Out Sports is an impressive 947 wins against 699 losses, or a winning percent of 74% of his games.\n\nLee’s players describe him as a great third-base coach and praise his organizational abilities to coordinate team travel, entry fees, uniforms and equipment and getting information out to all the players. According to one player, all of Lee’s work “left the guys on the field to worry about nothing other than playing the game we love!”\n\nDarren Dubsky - Player - Omaha, NE\n\nFor over 30 years, Darren Dubsky was one of the most accomplished Fast Pitch pitchers of his time. While throwing for multiple teams in the Midwest, the Clarkson, NE native racked up over 1,000 wins and 12,000 strikeouts on the mound. If Dubsky was on your roster, your team had a great chance of winning the tournament. In playing in nine Nebraska State championships, his teams won eight of them.

He also won an astonishing 96% of his games when throwing against Nebraska teams.\n\nAlready a member of the Metro Omaha Softball, Des Moines Softball and Iowa State Softball Halls of Fame, Darren Dubsky is a welcome and deserving addition to the USA Softball of Nebraska Hall of Fame.\n\n2019\n\nJoe Morris - Metorious - Norfolk, NE\n\nWhen a younger Joe Morris burst upon the scene after his two year stint in the Army, many old-timers considered him to be a ballplayer's ballplayer and a throw-back to the Gashouse Gang days, by sliding and diving without missing a game for 10 years while amassing a 714 game playing streak on his way to a 1525 playing career with the Norfolk Flyers, who went on to finish 1044-481. Nine of those wins came in a single day as his team battled through a 63-team losers bracket in the heat to win Districts back in the days when teams had to qualify for State, finishing the tourney 11-1, and yet another State Appearance, that totaled 19. During his 38 year playing career, not only did he go 9 for 19 in 7 All Star games, but he collected the most documented triples outside the Major Leagues with 151. He also amassed 2,404 hits while turning nearly 400 double-plays from his second-base position, and his 2666 fielding assists included feeding-the-pivot man to total 628 career DP's and 5 triple plays. Of his 6207 total fielding chances, he was seen making bare-handed plays and back-to-the-infield running catches into the outfield seem almost routine. Needless to say, he was just one of the many sparkling players from Norfolk and Northeast Nebraska, who made the game exciting to watch. He went so far as to have softball playing cards, complete with statistics and action pictures, made up for his entire teams. A huge Chicago Cubs fan, Joe built a replica of Wrigley Field in his back yard, complete with dugouts and the green outfield wall, and regularly hosts anyone who wants to play whiffle ball at ‘Wrigley Junior’.\n\nDan Simmons - Player - Omaha, NE\n\nDuring Dan’s 20-year career as one of the premier fast pitch pitchers in Nebraska, he compiled a record of 834 wins against just 89 losses, competing at the Major and Class A levels for the vaunted Broken Bow Travelers. Between 1971 and 1987, he led his team to eight Nebraska ASA state championships and was their ‘Ace’ pitcher in some 27 state, regional and national tournaments. Dan had all the pitches- fastball, rise ball, drop ball, a knuckleball that baffled many hitters, and by many accounts- a world class changeup. His command of all these pitches contributed greatly to help him throw one perfect game and three no-hitters and an impressive career ERA of 1.82. Dan was named as the Tournament MVP 32 times during his playing career.\n\nAs if his playing credentials were not enough, Dan went on to become the head softball coach at Kearney State College and was at the helm when the college transitioned to the NCAA Division II level. During his stint as head coach from 1988 through 2000, Dan’s teams earned a record of 448 wins against 115 losses, including an NAIA National Championship in 1990.\n\nBrian Bruggeman - Umpire - Lincoln, NE\n\nDuring Brian’s 25 years as an ASA registered umpire, he has umpired over 70 Nebraska USA state and regional softball tournaments and served as Umpire-in-Chief at several others.

During that time, he won over seventy percent of his games, amassing over 1000 wins primarily for teams such as Hamm’s, West Point/Scribner Farm Supply and Silver Dollar. Ron’s teams won several ASA state titles and always went deep into the tournaments. Fittje effectively threw several pitches, and being able to change speeds on hitters was one of his strengths. He is a ‘lefty’ and was especially known for his rise ball that tailed up and in to right-handed batters making him very tough to hit.\n\nDuring his early years, he threw for Hamm’s in the ultra-competitive Men’s Fast Pitch leagues in Fremont and Northeast Nebraska. Ron would regularly battle future Nebraska Hall of Fame pitchers Darrell Dubsky and Huk Herring. During one stretch, Ron’s team won the league championship and league tournament an impressive 10 straight years.
