        "text": "After 40 years together, The Cure’s bassist Simon Gallup has finally had enough.\n\nThe musician announced Saturday that he has decided to leave the band once and for all. Gallup wrote in a brief statement on his personal Facebook account, “With a slightly heavy heart I am no longer a member of the Cure! Good luck to them all.” A friend commented on the post asking if Gallup was doing alright, to which he replied, “I’m OK...just got fed up of betrayal.” While he didn’t elaborate further about his sudden departure after so many decades, a couple of hours later the band’s keyboardist Roger O'Donnell appeared to also confirm the news in a tweet. “A friend just told me they saw Lol in the Guitar Centre buying a bass???????,” O’Donnell wrote, referring to the band’s former drummer and keyboardist, Lol Tolhurst.\n\nGallup was one of The Cure’s oldest members, playing bass on eleven out of the band’s thirteen albums over the course of the last 40 years, and also occasionally playing keyboard. Gallup performed with the band for the first three years of its existence from 1979 to 1982 before taking a brief hiatus after getting into an argument with frontman Robert Smith while on tour. He returned in 1984 at the singer’s request. Smith said in a 2019 interview with NME that while he and Gallup have had their differences in the past, they’d managed to establish “a really good balance” and “discourse” between them that’s “on a level that’s just more enjoyable than it used to be.” He added, “For me, the heart of the live band has always been Simon, and he’s always been my best friend. It’s weird that over the years and the decades he’s often been overlooked. He doesn’t do interviews, he isn’t really out there and he doesn’t play the role of a foil to me in public, and yet he’s absolutely vital to what we do.” Smith confessed, “We’ve had some difficult periods over the years but we’ve managed to maintain a very strong friendship that grew out of that shared experience from when we were teens. When you have friends like that, particularly for that long, it would take something really extraordinary for that friendship to break.”\n\nGallup’s departure from the band might seem sudden, but it also comes as the legendary rock group announced they are starting to wind down anyway. Smith told The Sunday Times in June that he expects their upcoming album will be their last. The singer said the record will be “very emotional” and represent “10 years of life distilled into a couple of hours of intense stuff.” He concluded, “And I can’t think we’ll ever do anything else. I definitely can’t do this again.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
