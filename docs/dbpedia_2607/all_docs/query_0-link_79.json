        "text": "Anderson Cooper\n\nThe CNN anchor, who hosts the nightly-news program Anderson 360, launched a new syndicated daily talk show on September 12, 2011. Despite having the late British singer Amy Winehouse's parents on the first episode, it premiered to soft ratings. Most recently, he has been embroiled in controversy after a minor who was to guest for an episode on the the teenage mind injured himself and fell into a coma. The show is under scrutiny for reportedly asking the boy to \"film the crazy stuff you do\" in advance of his appearance.\n\nShepard Smith\n\nThe anchor of Fox News’ evening news cast The Fox Report as well as daytime show Studio B with Shepard Smith, has been a member of the channel’s news team since 1996. He’s best known for his rapid-fire segments the “G-Block” and “Around the World in 80 Seconds.” Fox News chief Roger Ailes recently revealed he has had many talks with Smith about moving the network more to the center politically in its coverage. Smith has earned praise from the left for making on-air comments that don't go over well with Fox News' base audience.\n\nErin Burnett\n\nThe newest addition to CNN's evening lineup, Erin Burnett OutFront, launches Oct. 3. The program is taking over the 7 p.m. time slot from John King USA, which will move to 6 p.m.\n\nBurnett says the show will focus on a number of topics, including her particular interests in the Middle East, China's growing influence and women's issues.\n\nBill O’Reilly\n\nOne of Fox News’ most outspoken on-air personalities, the broadcaster (who has had his share of scuffles with both peers and politicians) has hosted cable news show The O’Reilly Factor for seven years, famous for it’s nightly-segment “The No Spin Zone.” He recently went head-to-head with The Daily Show's Jon Stewart when a stop on the show to promote his new book switched to a debate over taxes.\n\nAnn Curry\n\nThe five-time Emmy winner joined NBC News in 1990. After working her way up through the ranks, and serving for years as the Today Show’s news anchor, she was named co-anchor (replacing Meredith Viera) in June 2011. She is also co-anchor of the network’s Dateline NBC and regular contributor to NBC Nightly News. Her interview with the defense attorney in the Michael Jackson doctor trial, Matthew Alford on the Today show resulted in the judge issuing a gag order.\n\nMatt Lauer\n\nLauer has been co-anchor of NBC’s Today since 1997. He started out as the show’s news anchor in 1994 after working as an anchor on NYC’s WNBC morning newscast. He recently won the honor of being the only morning show Charlie Sheen visited with before his Comedy Central Roast and the new season of Two and A Half Men premiered without him.\n\nLawrence O’Donnell\n\nMSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell host started as a political analyst on the cable network in 1996. Before that, he won an Emmy for his executive producing and writing work on NBC’s The West Wing. He was also the creator and ep on the short-lived NBC show Mister Sterling. O'Donnell made headlines recently when he asked his Last Word panel if New Jersey governor Chris Christie's weight could be used against him in a presidential run.\n\nKatie Couric\n\nCouric has had a lengthy career in broadcast journalism. She achieved world-wide fame as the co-host of NBC’s Today Show from 1991 to 2006. From there, she took over the CBS Evening News and anchored the show (and served as a 60 Minutes contributor) for five years; her final broadcast was May 19. Next, she is launching a daytime talk show on ABC in September 2012. As part of a new ABC News partnership with Yahoo, Couric will host new online news shows.\n\nJoy Behar\n\nThe on-air personality appears as a co-host on ABC’s The View as well as her own HLN nightly talk program, The Joy Behar Show. She got her start as a comedian in NYC, after leaving her job as a teacher. The host was recently the first person to speak with \"Millionaire Matchmaker\" Patti Stanger after she made offensive comments about gay men and Jewish men.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos\n\nAnchor of ABC’s Good Morning America and the network’s chief political correspondent, Stephanopoulos anchored the political news program This Week until 2009 when he moved to GMA. Prior to joining ABC News, he was senior advisor of policy and strategy to President Clinton. The newsman kicked off a new partnership between Yahoo and ABC News with an interview with President Obama live from the White House as part of a new series called Newsmakers.\n\nBarbara Walters\n\nWalters co-anchored NBC’s Today show for 11 years, until moving to ABC for $1 million/year in 1976, to serve as the first woman co-anchor of a nightly news program. She joined 20/20 in 1979 and hosted the show for 25 years. She created daytime talk show The View in 1997, of which she is still a host. Walters tends to stay out of controversy, but she can get dragged into the drama around her co-hosts. Most recently, Walters caused a stir among her co-hosts when she used what many African-Americans consider a slur against them while discussing a news item.\n\nWolf Blitzer\n\nBlitzer has been a CNN reporter since 1990, and currently hosts the cable news network’s The Situation Room. He also hosted the Sunday talk show Late Edition and Wolf Blitzer Reports on CNN before their cancellations.\n\nHe recently issued a warning (of sorts) to colleague Erin Burnett as she was preparing to launch her show, Erin Burnett OutFront. \"At CNN, the news never stops so you're going to have no life ever,\" he says. \"You're just going to be working all, all the time for years to come.\"\n\nScott Pelley\n\nPelley is the anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News. He was named anchor in May 2011 after Katie Couric’s departure, and his first broadcast was June 6. Recently, more people have begun tuning into evening news shows across the board with a 2.7% increase for CBS with Pelley at the helm. The newsman also recently accepted multiple awards for 60 Minutes at the 2011 News and Documentary Emmys.\n\nPiers Morgan\n\nThe British journalist and television host has worn many hats throughout his career. He edited Rupert Murdoch’s now-defunct scandal-embroiled News of the World before taking over Britain’s Daily Mirror in 1996. He is currently the host of America’s Got Talent as well as the British version of the show, and on January 17, he filled Larry King’s vacant timeslot on CNN with the replacement show Piers Morgan Tonight. He's currently embroiled in a \"he said, he said\" controversy with The X Factor host Steve Jones after he walked out of an interview on the talk show.\n\nKeith Olbermann\n\nCurrent TV's Countdown With Keith Olbermann has seen a ratings dip since the show's June debut, losing nearly half of its viewers in the 25-54 demo in mid-Sept. He rose to fame as the co-host of ESPN’s SportsCenter from 1992 to 1997. He hosted his Countdown show on MSNBC for nearly eight years before announcing his departure January 21 after being suspended in 2010 for donating to the Democratic candidate in the 2010 Congressional elections. He's also had some famous feuds along the way.\n\nJon Stewart\n\nThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart won its ninth consecutive Emmy Award as outstanding variety, music or comedy series in 2011.\n\nStewart got his start as a stand-up comedian, which comes in handy on his satirical late-night Comedy Central program.\n\nGreta Van Susteren\n\nVan Susteren engaged in a seven-minute shouting match on Fox News in Sept. over a blog post in which she called the Daily Caller editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson a \"pig\" for a story about Mike Tyson's comments about Sarah Palin.\n\nSusteren joined Fox News Channel in 2002 as the host of On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. Before that, she hosted a prime-time news program and a daily legal show on CNN. She gained prominence for her coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial in 1995.\n\nGlenn Beck\n\nThe former Fox News host has announced that he’s launching a television show for the younger generation. The show, Liberty Treehouse, will air on his internet-based channel GBTV and will showcase the day’s news and history for the audience.\n\nThe conservative pundit hosts the radio show, the Glenn Beck Program on Premiere Radio Networks. Prior to that, he was the host of a similarly eponymous television talk show on both Fox News Channel and HLN, but was let go from Fox News airing his last one-hour program June 30, 2011.\n\nDiane Sawyer\n\nNetwork evening newscasts are seeing viewer growth for the first time since the 2001-02 season, including ABC World News with Diane Sawyer, which is up 3.3 percent.\n\nPrior to anchoring ABC World News, Sawyer served as the longtime co-anchor of the network’s morning show, Good Morning America (GMA).\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nThe Comedy Central host has created his own shell corporation to illustrate how former Bush adviser Karl Rove is able to hide donors to his American Crossroads Super-PAC.\n\nThe The Colbert Report namesake owes a lot of his late-night prowess to former colleague and boss, Jon Stewart, whose Daily Show he worked on until 2005 when The Colbert Report was created as a spinoff.\n\nChristiane Amanpour\n\nUnder an ABC News, Yahoo partnership announced Oct. 3, the reporter will be the center of the new web series Around the World with Christiane Amanpour, which she says will allow her to explore key issues that don't always get enough TV exposure.\n\nThe anchor of ABC’s Sunday morning political news program This Week with Christiane Amanpour started her gig in 2010. She came to the network from CNN where she had been their chief international correspondent.\n\nChris Matthews\n\nMSNBC’s Hardball anchor, who spent five years in the United States Senate and four years in Jimmy Carter’s White House, recently gave his take on Republican Party standouts: \"I find Michele Bachmann authentic. I’m very impressed about how she’s raised all those foster kids. I look at Mitt Romney and I think he’s a mood ring. I think Jeb Bush will really be a political talent down the road. I look at different people and I judge them individually. I voted for [George W.] Bush in 2000. I thought he had some common sense.”\n\nBrian Williams\n\nThe NBC Nightly News anchor is launching a primetime newsmagzine for the network called Rock Center with Brian Williams. Williams said, \"Hopefully our journalism will speak louder than any name. If it doesn't, perhaps people will tune in to Rock Center hoping to see Tina Fey.\"\n\nWilliams stepped in as anchor of NBC Nightly News after Tom Brokaw's departure in 2004."
