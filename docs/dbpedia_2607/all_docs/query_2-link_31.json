        "text": "Greg Gamer was born in Emporia but grew up in Wichita. He attended the University of Kansas with the intention of becoming a pharmacist, but later transferred to Wichita University (now Wichita State). While finishing an undergraduate degree in political science, he began working part-time at KFBI-AM (later to become KIRL, then KFDI). It was at KFBI that Greg became acquainted with Martin Umansky, who hired him to work at KAKE-TV, which had not yet signed on the air.\n\nOn October 19, 1954, as the station’s “booth announcer,” Greg spoke the first words heard on KAKE. For the next dozen years, he would help establish the station as the leader in local news in south central Kansas. When a tornado struck the Cowley County town of Udall late at night on May 25, 1955, Gamer and photographer Paul Threlfall were the first television journalists to arrive the next morning. Their reports were used by both ABC and NBC to inform the nation of the tragedy, which claimed 77 lives and injured 270.\n\nKAKE’s news reputation gave him the inside track to interview newsmakers and celebrities who would come to Wichita. He interviewed three future presidents – John Kennedy in 1960, Lyndon Johnson in 1959 and Ronald Reagan in 1963. Gamer also interviewed Eleanor Roosevelt in 1956 and Ted Kennedy in 1960.\n\nIn addition to news duties at KAKE, Greg would fill in doing weather and sports. He would occasionally substitute as host of live children’s and women’s shows. In 1966, he left KAKE to anchor evening newscasts at KARD-TV (which later became KSNW). At KARD/KSNW, he interviewed presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\n\nGreg spent 25 years at KARD/KSNW, retiring in 1991 – after 37 years and parts of five decades in Wichita news. He is a recipient of the Grover Cobb award from KU and was honored with a National Headliner award for a story on Special Education. Greg is active in his Rotary Club in Wichita.\n\nJack Hartle attended grade schools in Hutchinson, Sapulpa, Oklahoma, and two country schools in Rice County, Kansas before graduating from Lyons High School and Kansas State University.\n\nHis broadcasting career began at K-State working at the student station KSDB-FM in Manhattan and was the studio engineer at KSAC and the K-State Sports Network. Following his college years, Jack took a full-time position at KRSA in Russell, followed by two-year stints at KFOR in Lincoln, Nebraska, KJPW in Waynesville, Missouri, and a few months at KONE in Reno, Nevada.
