        "text": "THE mythical rock band composed of Robert Smith on vocals and guitar, Simon Gallup on bass, Roger O'Donnell on keyboards, Reeves Gabrels on guitar and Jason Cooper on drums is back after 5 years of absence.\n\nSince their first concert in 1979 at the Bataclan (already organized by the founders of Alias) and today, more than 40 years of Cold Wave history is staring at us.\n\nDon't miss the biggest French tour ever done by the cult band. Starting on November 7, 2022, they will travel all over France to finish in Paris on November 28, 2022 at the Accor Arena.\n\nThe opening act will be the Scottish band THE TWILIGHT SAD.\n\nWe take out the black gabardine, we put on the Creepers and we go to offer ourselves a good cure of youth. You can't be serious when you're 17!"
