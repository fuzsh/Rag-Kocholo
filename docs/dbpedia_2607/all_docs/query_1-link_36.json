Oban, Argyll and Bute, located on the west coast of Scotland, is the location of the distillery of a famous single-malt scotch. The town is a port and embarkation-place for Scotlands western isles, while Lorne is the area surrounding. In fact, Craig Cockburn remarks that the Gaelic name for Oban is An t‑Oban Latharnach, or the bay of Lorne, usually shortened to An t-Oban (the bay). Although the modern town only emerged in the 19th century, the area has a considerable and ancient history, starting with Loarn, the brother of Fergus, who settled there about the year 498 and established a fort at Dunollie, which remained the ancestral home of the Lorne family for generations.\n\nOBELISK, THE.

AABB. Composed by Turlough O'Carolan, and reportedly his own favorite (Flood, 1905). It shows the influence of the Italian masters Vivaldi, Geminiani and Corelli on the composer. There is a persistant story that O'Caroland and Geminiani met, and indeed, Geminiani visited Ireland, and stayed for a short time in Dublin. They did not meet, however, according to Flood (1906, who quotes Charles O'Connor of Belanagare {d. 1790}, a friend of O'Carolan's), they did correspond through the violinist Elphin. The legend persists, however, that the Italian played Vivaldi's 5th Concerto for him, whereupon O'Carolan declared he could compose a similar piece the result being \"O'Carolan's Concerto.\" See note for Carolans Concerto. Miller & Perron (Irish Traditional Fiddle Music), 1977; vol. 2, No. 63.

It was composed in 1719 for a Miss Fe(a)therstone, of Ardagh, County Longford who was on her way to church at Granard one Sunday of that year when she chanced to meet the blind harper on the road. ONeill (1913) records the conversation:\n\n***\n\nYour servant, Mr OCarolan, she saluted, I thank you.\n\nWho speaks to me? he replied.\n\nIt is I, sir, one Miss Featherstone.\n\nIve heard of you, Madam: a young lady of great beauty\n\nand much wit. The loss of one sense prevents my beholding\n\nyour beauty; and I believe it is a happy circumstance for me,\n\nfor I am assured it has made many captives. But your wit,\n\nMadam! I dread it.\n\nHad I wit, Mr. OCarolan, this is not the day for its display.\n\nIt should give place to the duty of prayer. I apprehend that in\n\nComplying with this duty, you go one way, and I go another--\n\nI wish I could prevail with you to quit your way for mine.\n\nShould I go your way, Madam, I dread you yourself\n\nwould be the chief object of my devotion.\n\n***\n\nMiss Featherstone invited the bard to visit her house and admonished him to pray for her at church, and OCarolan said, Could I withdraw my Devotion from yourself, I would obey; but I will make the best effort I can. Adieu, adieu.\n\nThe harper did not make it to church, however, but instead used the time to compose this song for her. ONeill calls the music, which compasses almost two octaves, of a high order.\n\n***\n\nTurlough OCarolan. National Gallery of Ireland.

The melody was famously recorded under this title by County Sligo fiddler Michael Coleman in 1922 in New York (where he had emigrated in 1914). The tune was paired with Star on Munster and both were played in G dorian. The ODowd of the title was John ODowd (or Dowd), an older man and a fiddler player from the same district of County Sligo as Coleman was from. He was a member of a musical family from Gurteen which includes fiddler Joe ODowd (1914-1987) and his son Séamus, a fiddler and guitarist with the group Dervish. Reg Hall (1995) says Dowd is reputed to have been the composer of the melody, and that he was one of Colemans models, if not one of his teachers. Hall (1995) elsewhere says New York fiddler Lad OBeirne, son of Philip OBeirne from Bunninadan, County Sligo, attributed Michael Colemans variation sets of Bonnie Kate to John Dowd.

The air appears in John Gay's Beggar's Opera (1729) as \"Is then his fate decreed, sir?\" however, the song of the title comes from D'Urfey's stage comedy The Richmond Heiress (1693). It was sung by Bowman in broken English, put into the mouth of a comic Welshman, Rice ap Shenkin. It was also published in several editions of Pills to Purge Melancholy, along with another song to the same air, and appears on period half-sheets. Playford gives a version in his Thesaurus Musicus, book I, 1693, and in various editions of the Dancing Master.\n\n***\n\nThe tune is sometimes claimed as Welsh, states Kidson (1922), but since the music to D'Urfey's play was by Henry Purcell and John Eccles it was probably written by one or the other, although it could have been based on a Welsh air. It does appear in Welsh publications that date from after its English popularity, the first from 1794 when it was included in Joness collection of Welsh airs in which it was labelled The Camp. Curiously, it appears under the title Danish Air in the Welsh publication of John Parry (Bardd Alaw) called Two Thousand Melodies (1841, No. 1980). Kidson (Groves) finds that Parry had previously published it in his first Welsh collection of 1809, then stating he was unable to trace its origin.

The composition is one by OFarrell, according to Francis ONeill, presumably due to its inclusion in his National Irish Music (1804). OFarrell (whose first name is not known) was an uilleann piper who published four important collections of Irish music between 1797 and 1810, and the first to publish a tutor for the improved Irish instrument. Though little seems to be known about him (including his first name) he seems to have spent a good deal of time in London where he performed on stage in such productions as the pantomime of Oscar and Malvina. A coarser Irish Gaelic title for the tune is An Phis Fhliuch, of which a polite translation would be The Choice Wife. The tune was first published in OFarrells Collection of National Irish Music for the Union Pipes (c. 1804).

AKA and see \"The Silver Box,\" \"Vincent's Hornpipe,\" \"Vinton's Hornpipe.\" Irish, Hornpipe. B Flat Major. Standard tuning. AABB. A very popular hornpipe found in many printed an manuscript collections under a variety of titles, including Vintons Hornpipe, Lord St. Vincent(s Hornpipe), St Vincents Hornpipe, The Silver Box and OFenlons Hornpipe. Professor Samuel Bayard thinks the \"Silver Box Hornpipe,\" dated c. 1770 (in Alfred Moffat and Frank Kidsons Dances of the Olden Time, 1912; pg. 31), is a simple, perhaps early, version of the tune. As Lord St. Vincents, \"St. Vincent's Hornpipe\" or Vincents Hornpipe the hornpipe appears in several 19th century publications and manuscripts. The tune appears under this title in Thompsons Twenty Four Country Dances for the Year 1799 (pg. 33). It also appears under this title in the mid-19th century music manuscript papers of Long Island painter and musician William Sydney Mount. Shropshire musician John Moore included it in his 1837-1840 music manuscript as St. Vincents Hornpipe, dropping the Lord from the title. John Burks music manuscript, dated 1821, has a similar version (as Vincents Hornpipe) to Moores, including being set in the key of B Flat. All of these titles probably honor Admiral Jarvis, Lord St. Vincent, a contemporary of the celebrated Lord Horatio Nelsons and himself a hero of the Napoleonic Wars and the victor of the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. The title Vintons, by which the tune appears in the Boston, Massachusetts, publisher Elias Howes various editions (from the mid-19th century on) is a probably a corruption of the original title honouring Jarvis. The piece is in the repertoire of Missouri fiddler Kelly Jones (b. 1947) who, having the ability to read music, learned the melody from Coles 1000 Fiddle Tunes, as previous generations of sight-reading mid-western fiddlers had learned this and similar tunes from both Coles 1000 and its predecessor, Ryan's Mammoth Collection (1883), both Howe publications which included instructions for a contra-dance to the tune. Indeed, the tune seems common to many of Howes publications, notes Paul Tyler, and first appears in the 1844 edition of his Musicians Companion (pg. 61) {containing 18 setts of cotillions arranged with figures, and a large number of popular marches, quick-steps, waltzes, hornpipes, contra dances, songs, &c.&c.}. ONeill prints the tune as OFenlons Hornpipe. O'Neill (Krassen), 1976; pg. 178. O'Niell (Music of Ireland: 1850 Melodies), 1903/1979; No. 1618, pg. 300.

The British musicologist Chappell, writing in the 19th century, seemed to imply that Englishman George Macfarren composed this very popular tune; which is impossible, according to Bayard (1981), since it appeared in print in the Irish Murphy MS. when Macferren was age 2 (1790). The Irish uilleann piper 'Piper' Jackson has also been credited with the tune (by Moffat) which he supposedly wrote c. 1760, but Bayard again thinks it unlikely due to stylistic reasons (it does not sound like Jackson's other tunes, or even particularly Irish). He concludes the composer and date of composition are still unknown, though he doubts it is older than the 1780's. An early printing occurs in the Calvert Collection (1799), assembled by musician Thomas Calvert of Kelso, Scotland. A note with his collection states that Calvert supplied a variety of music and instruments, instruments lent out, tund and repaired.\n\n***\n\nOff She Goes was popular throughout the British Isles and North America. One unnamed source gives that in the days of sail it was a tradition for the fiddle player to sit on the deck of the ship playing Off She Goes as the ship departed harbor. In French-Canadian usage the melody is known as La Danse des Sutins although Gaspésie fiddle Yvon Mimeault (b. 1928) called his version Gigue du Bonhomme (my old mans tune) since his it was a favorite of his fiddling father, Odilon. The author of English Folk-Song and Dance found the melody in the repertoire of fiddler William Tilbury (who lived at Pitch Place, midway between Churt and Thursley in Surrey), who, in his younger days, played the fiddle at village dances. Tilbury learned his repertoire from an uncle, Fiddler Hammond, who died around 1870 and who was the village musician before him. The conclusion was that Off She Goes and similar type country dance tunes survived in English tradition (at least in southwest Surrey) well into the second half of the 19th century. Off She Goes is contained in several 19th century musicians manuscripts, such as the Joshua Gibbons, John Clare, Joseph Kershaw and the Hardy family manuscripts. Kershaw was a fiddler who lived in Slackcote, Saddleworth, North West England, in the 19th century, and his manuscript dates from around 1820 onwards. Clare (1793-1864) was a poet and rural labourer from Helpstone, near Stamford, in the East Midlands. Gibbons was from Lincolnshirehis setting, originally appearing in the mss. in the key of C major, has a somewhat divergent second part, as does the Kershaw setting. [Off she goes in H.S.J. Jacksons (Wyresdale, Lancashire) manuscript book of 1823 is a differentbut interestingtune altogethersee http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Info/RRTuneBk/gettune/000005bf.html ]. See also the version in Ann Winningtons music manuscript book (No. 16), c. 1810, wherein the frontispiece indicates she resided in New York. The melody appears in England in Thomas Wilsons Companion to the Ballroom (1816) and in America in Rileys Flute Melodies (1814).\n\n***\n\nAccordion player Jim Coogan (Neuburgh, N.Y.), himself a repository for Irish accordion lore, related this bit, in a discussion about the relative abilities of musicians to talk and play at the same time, not an easy thing to do for most:\n\n***\n\nJoe Mills (rip), the original accordion player with the Aughrim Slopes Ceili\n\nBand when they started in 1932, used to tell the story about when they were\n\nplaying on R2Nwhich radio station later became Radio Erinn and now is\n\nRTEthat they were playing a set of jigs and coming up on the turn which\n\nwas to be \"Off she goes\" when Paddy Kelly, the fiddler looked over at Joe\n\nto find out what tune - Joe got excited and forgot the name and could only\n\nshout \"feck off\" - and they all immediately turned the tune and it went very\n\nwellexcept they forgot they were on live radio...\n\n***\n\nThe title is among those mentioned in Patrick J.

USA; New England, southwestern Pa. G Major (most versions). Standard tuning (fiddle). AB (Plain Brown, Silberberg): AABB (most versions). Irish in origin, although the melody has been adopted by several genres. The first part combines with other parts for \"Fireman's Reel,\" \"I'm Waiting for You [2],\" \"Silver Cluster,\" and \"Five Miles Out of Town.\" A version from the North of England appears as A Clog Dance in the Plain Brown Tune Book, the c. 1847 manuscript of Ellis Knowles, a musician from Radcliffe, Lancashire. Seattle fiddler, producer and folklorist Vivian Williams found a version of Off to California in a hand-written music manuscript book dating from the 1860s and 1870s from western Oregon, where the melody is titled only as Jig Cotillion. Like many such manuscripts, it belonged to a musical family, and tunes were entered in different hands and probably different generations. Francis ONeill also collected the tune in California in the mid-19th century. Allan's Irish Fiddler, No. 100, pg. 25 (appears as \"Humours of California\"). See also the related Hillside Cottage and the reel You Bet. Source for notated version: Capt.
