With tortured vocals and hard beats, they summon you to gyrate, grind, throb on the dance floor. Coming from their respective noise and industrial backgrounds, Peter Kalisch and Aaron December’s MMDA is a departure from their earlier work, allowing them to explore dance grooves paired with visceral walls of sound that engulfs the listener. Never ones to shy away from the taboo, they dive headfirst into a world of sexual desire, rainbow capitalism, and all the terrors and delights of being a 21st century queer.\n\nWednesday March 6th Distorted Disco hosts Mono No Aware(Germany/HANDS) , Threat of Innocence, Ratio Strain, and DJs Cervello Elettronico vs Nick Viola , Bractune, and Spheric.\n\nOur other resident, Sleep Clinic contributes this mix from his new home outside of LA.\n\nEnjoy as a complimentary soundscape to the night!\n\nMissing episodes?\n\nClick here to refresh the feed.\n\nKNIVES/INSIDE/HER is a valley girl, designer, single mom and a dj of 16 years.
