        "text": "Beloved wife of the late John O’Donnell. Devoted mother of Linda (Roger) Hess, Don Mueller, Mark (Billy) O'Donnell, and Darren (Cindy) O'Donnell. Loving grandmother to Joe (Cheryl) Mueller, Aubrey (Michael) Gonzalez, Karla (Nick) Barela, Chris (Mandy) Mueller, Kelley (Jeremy) Burt, Heidi (DeMarco) Murray and Cody (Sophia) O’Donnell, and great-grandmother to their 20 respective children.\n\nVisitation will be held on Friday, February 23, 2024, from 10 AM until time of service at 11 AM at Landmark Church, 1600 Glendale-Milford Rd., Cincinnati, OH 45215. Burial will follow at Landmark Memorial Gardens.\n\nPeggy Jo O’Donnell (nee Randall) entered the gates of heaven on Sunday, February 11, 2023, at the age of 91. She was loved by many and remembered as spirited, loving, faithful, honest, generous, strong and hardworking. Peggy loved to laugh and always had a beautiful smile and an open door. She was married to her love, Jack O’Donnell, for nearly 50 years until he preceded her in death in 2007.\n\nPeggy was proud to be from Louisville, Kentucky. She carried a life-long love of the Kentucky Derby and could usually pick the winning horse! She remained a southern girl at heart even after moving to Cincinnati. She loved watching westerns and was an expert at southern cooking. Throughout her life, Peggy worked multiple jobs to help provide for her family, her longest being at the Avon company. She enjoyed strong friendships with the women she worked with and the neighbors she lived near, though none as special as the inseparable bond she shared with her only brother, Bob, and his sweet wife, Irene, who became the sister she never had. Peggy Jo passed peacefully in her sleep in the presence of her children and awoke in the glorious presence of Jesus. She is experiencing the joy of a perfect body, in a place where there is no illness or sorrow. Peggy is now reunited with her beloved mother, Bernice Tomlinson, her husband, Jack, and those precious loved ones who have gone before her. Praise God for the promise of heaven, which gets sweeter every day!\n\n“Yet I am continually with You; You have taken hold of my right hand. With Your counsel You will guide me, and afterward receive me to glory.” Psalm 73:23-24"
