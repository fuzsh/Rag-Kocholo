His next achievement was developing a novel drainage technique—a logical next step. Dedrick's improvements in irrigated agriculture led to the development of Management Improvement Programs (MIP) for transferring the technology. MIP pulled together a wide range of interested parties into an effort to improve the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture. He led an interagency MIP of federal, state, and local entities, as well as an irrigation district and growers, that identified areas and established plans for improving performance. The Bureau of Reclamation then adapted and applied the process in irrigation districts in the western United States. Dedrick's achievements also have been widely adopted abroad. The world bank used the MIP model to improve irrigation around the world. Dedrick received both the award for the Advancement of Surface Irrigation and the Evelyn E. Rosentreter Standards Award from the American Society of Agricultural Engineers. He was voted Man of the Year by the Irrigation Association and was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the University of Nebraska, Department of Biological Systems Engineering. Dedrick was also honored with the Presidential Distinguished Rank Award. He has received numerous other awards and national and international recognition.\n\nRead\n\nRonald Fayer - Inducted 2011\n\nFood Safety\n\nRonald Fayer is a world-renowned expert on the study of microorganisms of medical and veterinary importance. Fayer pioneered in-vitro cultivation of coccidian parasites of domestic animals, and he was first to use these methods for testing anticoccidial drugs. His methods have been adapted and used throughout the world to investigate these and related organisms. Until Fayer, the source of Sarcocystis cysts in human and food-animal muscles was unknown. Fayer elucidated the life cycle of Sarcocystis, a parasitic infection that caused millions of dollars of beef to be condemned every year. He identified previously unknown precystic stages of infection that caused abortion, wasting, poor growth, and death in livestock. As a result, Sarcocystis disease is no longer a serious economic problem. Fayer is also recognized worldwide as a leader in the identification and naming of several new species of Cryptosporidium, a widespread pathogen affecting humans and animals. A preeminent international expert on protozoan pathogens, Fayer has received over 350 invitations to speak at scientific conference and has been invited to many countries to consult on problems involving protozoan pathogens. Honors include the Helminthological Society of Washington's Anniversary Award, Distinguished Veterinary Parasitologist from the American Association of Veterinary Parasitologists, the National Oceanic and Atomospheric Administration Unit Award, and the H.B. Ward Medal from the American Society of Parasitologists. Fayer received the USDA Superior Service award in 1978 and 1997 and USDA's plow award in 2005. He is also a recipient of the Presidential Rank Award for Distinguished Senior Professional.\n\nRead | Listen\n\nRonald F.

Dubey worked principally on three single-cell organisms: Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, and Sarcocystis neurona. Toxoplasmosis, caused by T. gondii, is a devastating disease among congenitally infected children and a major cause of foodborne disease in the United States. Dubey has spent years developing methods for identifying the presence of T. gondii and guidelines for rendering infected meat safe for consumption. Neospora caninum causes spontaneous abortion in livestock and paralysis in household pets. Having identified N. caninum as the cause, Dubey developed tests to identify it, discovered its lifecycle, and led research into developing a vaccine. Dubey identified the cause of Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis and developed a diagnostic test. He furthermore elucidated the protozoa's life cycle and discovered the drugs used to treat the disease. Dubey has received the Medal of the Toxoplasma Centennial Congress, the Eminent Parasitologist Award and the Barclay McGhee Award in Protozoology from the American Society of Parasitologists, the Presidential Rank Award of Meritorious Senior Professional, and Technology Transfer Award from USDA, Agricultural Research Service.

Van Vleck's greatest achievement is the development and release of general purpose software for estimation of genetic parameters from experimental and industry data. This involved a revolutionary breakthrough in computer strategy that reduced the time needed to process complex data by as much as 600-fold. He was the first to use simulated data to investigate intractable problems such as analysis of threshold traits, and he devised the \"animal model\" to estimate genetic parameters required to predict breeding values of dairy cattle. Van Vleck also developed an original procedure to compare the genetic value of bulls across breeds; previously bulls could only be compared within a breed. Van Vleck's honors include the Animal Breeding and Genetics Award and Morrison Award, American Society of Animal Science; National Association of Animal Breeders Award; Jay L. Lush Award, American Dairy Science Association; Pioneer Award, Beef Improvement Federation; International Distinguished Achievement in Agriculture Award and other awards, Gamma Sigma Delta; Pioneer Award, Beef Improvement Federation; and Living Pioneer Award, National Dairy Shrine.

Paape - Inducted 2009\n\nAnimal Health\n\nDairy scientist Max Paape is the world's leading authority on bovine mastitis, the costliest disease to the U.S. dairy industry. He is internationally renowned for his work on cells in milk and the neutrophil's role in defending the mammary gland against bacteria causing mastitis. His research into the biology of bovine neutrophils and his significant discoveries about factors influencing their function made groundbreaking contributions to the study of mammary immunology, which has benefited diary industries world wide in the control of mastitis in dairy ruminants. Early in his career, Paape developed procedures for quantifying the milk somatic cell count (MSCC), now used as an index of udder health. His research showed that noninfectious factors did not increase MSCC and led to the formation of abnormal milk control programs. His seminal work has had a lasting impact on dairy industries worldwide. Current regulatory limits, milk producer premiums, and animal selection all rely heavily on accurate MSC determination.\n\nRead\n\nJ. Neil Rutger - Inducted 2009\n\nCrops\n\nGeneticist J. Neil Rutger created a renaissance in the application of induced mutation as a breeding tool for rapid development of new rice cultivars. His work on semidwarf cultivars, early maturity, and grain characteristics has had great national and international impact. In 1976, Rutger released the first semidwarf table rice cultivar in the United States, Calrose 76, which had a 15-percent yield advantage over tall cultivars. Calrose 76 has been the ancestral semidwarfism source for many additional cultivars developed. Rutger also developed early maturity mutants, endosperm mutants, elongated uppermost internode mutants, genetic male steriles, low phytic acid mutants, giant embryo mutants, and semidwarf basmati and jasmine germplasm. He has released over 60 improved germplasms. As the first Director of the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, Rutger recruited staff and developed the Center into a world-class facility, which includes the Rice Genomics Facility and the Genetic Stocks-Oryza Collection.\n\nRead\n\nB.A. Stewart - Inducted 2009\n\nNatural Resources\n\nSoil scientist B.A. Stewart's seminal work on nutrient management, water quality, water management, and dryland agriculture has influenced research worldwide. His groundbreaking research on anhydrous ammonia, nitrogen fractions, and nitrate accumulation and movement beneath feedlots and cultivated fields stimulated research worldwide on agriculture's effects on environmental quality. In 1975, he led the team that prepared Control of Water Pollution from Cropland, a report jointly issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that inspired the concept of agricultural best management practices and, together with a follow-up ARS-EPA report, laid the foundation for ARS's water quality modeling program. He is an international leader in dryland agriculture and water conservation and is widely known for his conservation tillage research and no till advocacy.\n\nRobert E. Davis - Inducted 2008\n\nCrops\n\nPlant pathologist Robert Davis's 1979 discovery of spiroplasmas, a previously unrecognized form of life, revolutionized the worlds of plant pathology, medicine, and animal husbandry. The fundamental understanding of this entire group of lifeforms rests on his work. A form of bacteria without cell walls, spiroplasmas cause diseases of crop plants and of insects and are suspected in some human maladies. By showing the scientific world that this lifeform exists, Davis opened new categories of research. He showed the scientific community how to culture these smallest of microbes and how they survive outside plants on flower petals. Davis developed techniques to detect and identify spiroplasmas, and discovered spiroplasma diseases of honey bees and other pollinating insects. He conceptualized and led the project to sequence the spiroplasma genome. Davis even discovered a pathogen of the pathogen—a virus that infects spiroplasmas across species.\n\nRead\n\nAndrew N. Sharpley - Inducted 2008\n\nNatural Resources\n\nSoil scientist Andrew Sharpley is internationally recognized for his invaluable contributions in promoting soil and water conservation strategies that are both economically beneficial and environmentally sound. Sharpley's research on non-point-source pollution led to involvement in developing Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans that increased recreational use of waters, improved shellfish harvests, reduced fish kills, and lowered drinking water treatment costs. Sharpley's research on nutrient cycling in soil-water systems demonstrated the movement of nutrients in agricultural systems and their impact on water resources. This led to equations that predict the transport of elemental nutrients in runoff, including the Phosphorus Index (widely known as the \"P Index\") for identifying agricultural fields at greatest risk for nutrient loss. The P Index serves as an educational tool that shows the results of management options to provide flexible strategies for keeping nutrients in the field and out of surface and ground water. Sharpley's research recommendations and technological innovations have been widely adapted by regulatory and resource conservation agencies worldwide.\n\nRead\n\nDennis Gonsalves - Inducted 2007\n\nCrops\n\nDennis Gonsalves was a trailblazer in applying pathogen-derived resistance to the development of virus-resistant plant varieties and in related research into viral diseases of fruits and vegetables. After years of studying and improving disease resistance in cucumber, grapevine and other fruits and vegetables, he and his research team developed methods for transferring specific virus genes into host plants to create resistance to that virus. His ringspot-resistant papaya saved the small-farm-based Hawaiian papaya industry. This new variety was so successful that it became the first commercialized transgenic fruit crop. Gonsalves further adapted papaya varieties for local conditions in Africa and Bangladesh. These improved varieties will help in overcoming vitamin-A deficiency in children of those areas.\n\nRead | Listen\n\nJanet C.

Her work has profoundly influenced our understanding of maternal and infant health. She showed in a groundbreaking study that maternal nutritional status—particularly fat stores—at the inception of pregnancy strongly affects the pregnancy's outcome. This led to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies establishing differing weight-gain guidelines fior underweight, normal-range and overweight expectant mothers. King chaired the 2005 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee for the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, which guided revision of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Food Pyramid. She also chaired the National Academy of Sciences' Food and Nutrition Board, which established a new paradigm for U.S. Dietary Reference Intakes, and a United Nations committee on international harmonization of dietary standards.\n\nRead | Listen\n\nWayne W. Hanna - Inducted 2006\n\nCrops\n\nIn Wayne Hanna's 35 years of research in turfgrass breeding and genetics, he has improved the very surface of the earth we walk on. His bermudagrass varieties have more vigor and resistance to pests and heat and need less fertilizer, pesticides and water. His bermudagrasses are widely used for forage and on golf courses, ball fields and lawns. He developed new pearl millets for forage that cost farmers less to grow while producing higher yields of high-quality pasture. Hanna's seminal research on apomixis (plant cloning) is directed towards producing true-breeding cultivars that retain superior characteristics and hybrid vigor in crops for which traditional hybridization is not economically feasible and in which apomixis does not occur naturally. He has also done vital work on gene transfer in millet. Hanna was based at the ARS Coastal Plain Experiment Station, Tifton, Ga.\n\nRead | Listen\n\nRay D. Jackson - Inducted 2006\n\nNatural Resources\n\nThe \"Father of Remote Sensing,\" physicist Ray Jackson developed methods used worldwide to evaluate crop health. His methods provide quick, inexpensive, noninvasive assessments of plants and soils. Jackson's insight was to determine directly from plants what their condition was—by observing the difference between their remotely sensed \"body temperature\" (emitted infrared radiation) and that of the air and soil. Jackson's crop-water stress index better detects yield-robbing crop stress and can indicate when to irrigate. Because of his work at the ARS U.S. Water Conservation Laboratory in Phoenix, Ariz., commercial sensors soon became available. The technology expanded to use of airplane/ground systems and then orbiting satellites. Today, remote sensing of vegetation condition is commonplace around the world.\n\nListen\n\nVernon G. Pursel - Inducted 2006\n\nAnimal Health\n\nVernon Pursel is recognized worldwide for reproductive and genetic technologies in farm animals. His influence on gene engineering and his development of frozen swine semen profoundly influence animal and biomedical science. Freezing of swine semen for artificial insemination was unsuccessful until the 1970s when Pursel developed a procedure that is used to this day. Advances resulting from his research have increased use of artificial insemination to include over 80 percent of the U.S. swine herd. In 1984, Pursel was the first to successfully transfer foreign genes into farm animals. His centrifugation technique made methods used in mouse experiments possible in pigs and cows, and he proved gene transfer is practical in farm species. Transgenetic technology promises better animal growth and milk production, enhanced disease resistance and higher quality food, as well as inexpensive farm production of human medicines.\n\nRead | Listen\n\nNelson A.
