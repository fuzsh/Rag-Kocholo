        "text": "The Cure is an English rock band that was formed in 1978 by Robert Smith. They have released 13 studio albums, two EPs, and over 30 singles, and have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. [1] Their most recent album, 4:13 Dream, was released in 2008. The Cure were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. [2]\n\nHistory[]\n\nFormation & Early Years[]\n\nThe founding members of the Cure were school friends at Notre Dame Middle School in Crawley, West Sussex. [3] They first performed in public at an end-of-year show in April 1973 as members of a one-off school band, Obelisk. [4] In January 1976, while at St Wilfrid's Comprehensive School, Ceccagno formed a five-piece rock band with Smith on guitar and Dempsey on bass, along with two other school friends. [note 1] They called themselves Malice and rehearsed David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix and Alex Harvey songs in a local church hall. [note 2] By late April 1976, Ceccagno and the other two members had left, and Tolhurst (drums), Martin Creasy (vocals), and Porl Thompson (guitar) had joined the band. [note 3] This lineup played all three of Malice's only documented live shows during December 1976. In January 1977, following Creasy's departure, and increasingly influenced by the emergence of punk rock, Malice's remaining members became known as Easy Cure – after a song written by Tolhurst. [note 4]\n\nAfter winning a talent competition, Easy Cure signed a recording contract with German record label Ariola-Hansa on 18 May 1977. [note 5] In September 1977, Peter O'Toole, who had been the group's vocalist for several months, left the group to live on a kibbutz in Israel. The band auditioned several vocalists that month before Smith assumed the role. [note 6] The new four-piece of Dempsey, Smith, Thompson, and Tolhurst recorded their first studio demo sessions as Easy Cure for Hansa at SAV Studios in London in October and November 1977. [note 7] None were ever released. [note 8]\n\nThe band continued to perform regularly around Crawley throughout 1977 and 1978. On 19 February 1978 they were joined at The Rocket for the first time by a support band from Horley called Lockjaw, featuring bassist Simon Gallup. [note 9] Hansa, dissatisfied with the group's demos, did not wish to release their original song \"Killing an Arab\". The label suggested that the band attempt cover versions instead. They refused, and by March 1978 Easy Cure's contract with the label had been dissolved. [note 10] Smith later recalled, \"We were very young. They just thought they could turn us into a teen group. They actually wanted us to do cover versions and we always refused.\"\n\nOn 22 April 1978 Easy Cure played their last gig at the Montefiore Institute Hall [note 11] before guitarist Porl Thompson was dropped from the lineup because his lead-guitar style was at odds with Smith's growing preference for minimalist songwriting. [note 12] Smith soon renamed the remaining trio the Cure. [note 13] Later that month the band recorded their first sessions as a trio at Chestnut Studios in Sussex, producing a demo tape for distribution to a dozen major record labels. [note 14] The demo found its way to Polydor Records scout Chris Parry, who signed the Cure to his newly formed Fiction label – distributed by Polydor – in September 1978. [note 15] An early NME article on the band wrote that the Cure \"are like a breath of fresh suburban air on the capital's smog-ridden pub-and-club circuit,\" and noted: \"With a John Peel session and more extensive London gigging on their immediate agenda, it remains to be seen whether the Cure can retain their refreshing joie de vivre.\" [note 16]\n\nThe band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album (Three Imaginary Boys); in a 1987 interview, he admitted: \"a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it.\" [note 17]\n\n1980-1982[]\n\nSeventeen Seconds was a departure from the Cure's sound up to that point, with Hedges describing it as \"morose, atmospheric, very different to Three Imaginary Boys.\" [note 18] In its review of Seventeen Seconds the NME said, \"For a group as young as the Cure, it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time.\" [note 19] At the same time, Smith became concerned about the concept of an alleged \"anti-image\". [note 20] Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti-image association that some considered to be \"elaborately disguising their plainness\", stating, \"We had to get away from that anti-image thing, which we didn't even create in the first place. And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn't like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand.\" [note 21] That same year Three Imaginary Boys was repackaged for the American market as Boys Don't Cry, with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, \"I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music – the sort of thing that didn't interest me at all.\" [note 22]\n\nSmith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was \"undergoing a lot of mental stress. But it had nothing to do with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time\". [note 23] Gallup described the album by saying, \"Nihilism took over ... We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time.\" [note 24] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track \"The Hanging Garden\" for release as a single. [note 25] Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. [note 26]\n\nSimon Gallup left the Cure at the tour's conclusion after a bar fight with Smith; the two did not talk to each other for the following eighteen months. [note 27] Smith then placed the Cure on hold and rejoined Siouxsie and the Banshees as their lead guitarist in November 1982. [5] He subsequently became a full-time member of that band, and was featured on the live video and album Nocturne. He then recorded the album Hyæna with them, but left the group two weeks before its June 1984 release to concentrate on the Cure. [6]\n\n1983-1988[]\n\nWith Gallup's departure from the Cure and Smith's work with Siouxsie and the Banshees, rumours spread that the Cure had broken up. In December 1982, Smith remarked to Melody Maker, \"Do the Cure really exist any more? I've been pondering that question myself ... it has got to a point where I don't fancy working in that format again.\" He added, \"Whatever happens, it won't be me, Laurence and Simon together any more. I know that.\" [note 28]\n\nParry was concerned about the state of his label's top band, and became convinced that the solution was for the Cure to reinvent its musical style. Parry managed to convince Smith and Tolhurst of the idea; Parry said, \"It appealed to Robert because he wanted to destroy the Cure anyway.\" [note 29]\n\nMelody Maker praised the album as \"psychedelia that can't be dated\", while pondering, \"I've yet to meet anyone who can tell me why the Cure are having hits now of all times.\" [note 30] The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson and Anderson, along with Phil Thornalley who had produced The Top and assumed bass duties for live performances. Near the tour's end, Anderson was fired for destroying a hotel room and was replaced by Boris Williams, who had previously been the touring drummer for Thompson Twins. [note 31] Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring. [note 32] Former Cure bassist Simon Gallup, who had formed the band Fools Dance in the interim, rejoined the Cure after roadie Gary Biddles brokered a reconciliation between Gallup and Smith [note 33] Smith was ecstatic about Gallup's return and declared to Melody Maker, \"It's a group again.\" [note 34]\n\nThe band recruited Roger O'Donnell, previously the touring keyboardist for the Psychedelic Furs, to supplement the work of Tolhurst while allowing Thompson to focus on guitar. During the subsequent tour, Tolhurst's alcohol consumption began to interfere with his ability to perform. [note 35]\n\n1989-1993[]\n\nDuring the Disintegration sessions, the band gave Smith an ultimatum that either Tolhurst would have to leave the band or they would. [note 36] In February 1989, Tolhurst's exit was made official and announced to the press; [note 37] this resulted in O'Donnell becoming a full-fledged member of the band and left Smith as the Cure's only remaining founding member. Smith attributed Tolhurst's dismissal to an inability to exert himself and issues with alcohol, concluding, \"He was out of step with everything. It had just become detrimental to everything we'd do.\" [note 38] Because Tolhurst was still on the payroll during the recording of Disintegration, he is credited in the album's liner notes as playing \"other instruments\" and is listed as a co-writer of every song; however, it has since been revealed that while Tolhurst had contributed to the song \"Homesick\", his contributions to the rest of the album were minimal due to his alcoholism. [7]\n\nIn May 1990, O'Donnell quit and was replaced by Perry Bamonte, who played both keyboards and guitar and had been a member of the band's road crew since 1984. [8] In 1991, the Cure were awarded the Brit Award for Best British Group. [9] That same year, Tolhurst filed a lawsuit against Smith and Fiction Records over royalties payments and claimed that he and Smith jointly owned the name \"The Cure\"; the lawsuit finally ended in 1994 in favour of Smith. In the meantime, the band returned to the studio to record their next album. [note 39]\n\n1994-1998[]\n\nIn 1994 the band composed the original song \"Burn\" for the soundtrack to the movie The Crow, which went to number one on the Billboard 200 album charts. [10] Between the release of Wish and the start of sessions for the Cure's next studio album, the band's line-up shifted again [11] Porl Thompson left the band to tour with Page and Plant and was not replaced, [12] while Boris Williams quit and was replaced by new drummer Jason Cooper. [13] After a four-year absence, Roger O'Donnell returned to play keyboards. The sessions for their next album began in 1994 with only Robert Smith and Perry Bamonte present; Simon Gallup then returned from a health-related leave or absence, after which Cooper and O'Donnell joined the sessions. [14]\n\n1999-2005[]\n\nWith only one album left in their record contract and with commercial response to Wild Mood Swings and the Galore compilation lacklustre, Smith once again considered that the end of the Cure might be near and thus wanted to make an album that reflected the more serious side of the band. [note 40] In 2001, the Cure left Fiction and released their Greatest Hits album and DVD, which featured the music videos for a number of their songs. [15]\n\nIn 2003, the Cure signed with Geffen Records. [16] To promote the album (The Cure), the band headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival that May. From 24 July to 29 August, the Cure headlined the Curiosa concert tour of North America, which was formatted as a traveling festival and also featured Interpol, The Rapture, Mogwai, Muse, and Thursday, among other groups. [17] The same year the band was honored with an MTV Icon award in a television special presented by Marilyn Manson. [18]\n\nIn May 2005, O'Donnell and Bamonte were fired from the band. [19] O'Donnell claims Smith informed him he was reducing the band to a three-piece. Previously O'Donnell said he had only found out about the band's upcoming tour dates via a fan site and added, \"It was sad to find out after nearly twenty years the way I did, but then I should have expected no less or more.\" [20] The remaining members of the band – Smith, Gallup and Cooper – made several appearances as a trio [21] before Porl Thompson returned to the Cure's lineup for their summer 2005 tour. [22]\n\n2006-2015[]\n\nO'Donnell officially rejoined the Cure in 2011 before the band performed at the Vivid Sydney festival in Australia. This concert was the first in their Reflections concert series, in which they performed their first three albums in their entireties. [23] On 27 September, the Cure was announced as a nominee for 2012 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. [24]\n\nOn 1 May 2012, Porl Thompson, now known as Pearl Thompson, announced that he had left the Cure for the second time. [25] On 26 May, the Cure embarked on a 19-date summer festival tour of Europe, commencing at the Pinkpop Festival, joined by Reeves Gabrels on guitar. On the same day, it was announced that Gabrels would be standing in for the tour, but at that point was not a full-fledged member of the band. [26] Several weeks into the tour, the band invited Gabrels to become a member and he accepted. [27]\n\n2019-Present[]\n\nIn a 30 March 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, Smith commented on the band's next album, saying, \"For the first time in 20 years, we went into a studio – we actually went into the studio where they [Queen Official] did 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. The songs are like 10 minutes, 12 minutes long. We recorded 19 songs. So I have no idea what to do now... We'll finish it before we start in the summer, and it'll be mixed through the summer. And then so release date, I don't know, October? Halloween! Come on!\" [28] In an interview published on 5 July in NME, he noted that the band would be re-recording three or four 4 songs in August 2019 but that, \"I feel intent on it being a 2019 release and would be extremely bitter if it isn't.\" [29] However, the year passed with no new studio release, as did the following three years.\n\nIn interviews in June 2021, Smith referenced the recording of two new Cure albums, saying \"One of them's very, very doom and gloom and the other one isn't,\" and that the recordings have been completed, \"I just have to decide who's going to mix them.\" [30][31] On 15 August 2021, bassist Simon Gallup posted on his social media that he had left the Cure. [32] No official statement concerning his departure was made by Smith or the band [33] and Gallup subsequently deleted the post. On 14 October 2021, Gallup confirmed that he was still in the band. [34]\n\nPerry Bamonte returned to the band for their Lost World tour beginning with their 6 October 2022 concert in Riga, Latvia. [35] In March 2023, the Cure announced a 30-date North American tour called Shows of a Lost World, set to take place in May through July, the band's first full United States tour since 2016. [36] Smith was outspoken against Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing model and ticket scalpers, setting base prices as low as $20 before fees; [37][38] he also negotiated with the company to issue partial refunds to fans who were subjected to excessive fees above the list price. [39]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nThe Cure are often regarded as one of the most influential and significant alternative artists of the 1980s and 1990s. [40][41] They were one of the first alternative bands to have chart and commercial success in an era before alternative rock had broken into the mainstream; in 1992, NME declared that the Cure had during the 1980s become \"a goth hit machine (19 to date), an international phenomenon and, yet, the most successful alternative band that ever shuffled disconsolately about the earth\". [note 41]\n\nThe Cure, and Robert Smith in particular, have been credited with contributing to the development and popularity of gothic rock and broader \"goth\" fashion. [42] NME made Smith the cover artist in their 2004 edition Originals: Goth; Smith also served as partial visual inspiration for the title character of Tim Burton's popular 1990 film Edward Scissorhands. [43]\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame chose the Cure for induction in its Class of 2019. [44] Although the Cure had been eligible for the Hall of Fame since 2004, they were only nominated once previously, in 2012. [45]\n\nControversies[]\n\n\"Killing an Arab\"[]\n\n\"Killing an Arab\" garnered both acclaim and controversy: while the single's provocative title led to accusations of racism, the song is actually based on French existentialist Albert Camus's novel The Stranger. [note 42] The band placed stickers that denied the racist connotations on the single's 1979 reissue on Fiction.\n\nRiot[]\n\nIn late 1987 the band performed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, becoming one of the first British alternative rock bands to perform a large-scale concert there. [46] The concert ended in a riot after fans who had purchased counterfeit tickets were denied entry to the venue. [47] The Cure did not play in Argentina again until 2013.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nAlbums[]\n\nThree Imaginary Boys (1979)\n\nSeventeen Seconds (1980)\n\nFaith (1981)\n\nPornography (1982)\n\nThe Top (1984)\n\nThe Head on the Door (1985)\n\nKiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me (1987)\n\nDisintegration (1989)\n\nWish (1992)\n\nWild Mood Swings (1996)\n\nBloodflowers (2000)\n\nThe Cure (2004)\n\n4:13 Dream (2008)\n\nLive Albums[]\n\nConcert: The Cure Live (1984)\n\nEntreat (1991)\n\nShow (1993)\n\nParis (1993)\n\nBestival Live 2011 (2011)\n\n40 Live (Curætion-25 + Anniversary) (2019)\n\nRemix Albums[]\n\nMixed Up (1990)\n\nTorn Down: Mixed Up Extras 2018 (2018)\n\nCompilation Albums[]\n\nBoys Don't Cry (1980)\n\nJapanese Whispers (1983)\n\nStanding on a Beach: The Singles (1986)\n\nGalore: The Singles 1987-1997 (1997)\n\nGreatest Hits (2001)\n\nAlternative Rarities 1988-1989 (2010)\n\nAcoustic Hits (2017)\n\nBox Sets[]\n\nFirst Aid Box (1987)\n\nIntegration (1990)\n\nAssemblage CD Collection (1991)\n\nLimited Edition CD Box (1992)\n\nJoin the Dots: B-Sides & Rarities 1978-2001 (The Fiction Years) (2004)\n\nInto The Dark: The Early Cure (1979-1982) (2009)\n\nFade Away: The Early Years Vinyl Box Set (2009)\n\nClassic Album Selection (1979-1984) (2011)\n\nOther Sets[]\n\n...Happily Ever After (1981)\n\nThe Head on the Door & Wish (1996)\n\n3 for One (2000)\n\nThree Imaginary Boys/Faith (2008)\n\nPornography/Seventeen Seconds (2008)\n\nThe Head on the Door/Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me (2008)\n\nExtended Plays[]\n\nSingles (1982)\n\nA Single (1982)\n\nThe Walk (1983)\n\nHalf an Octopuss & Quadpus (1985)\n\nThe Cure (1988)\n\nThe Peel Sessions (1988)\n\nSideshow (1993)\n\nLost Wishes (1994)\n\nFive Swing Live (1997)\n\nSessions@AOL (2004)\n\nFrom Festival 2005 (2006)\n\nHypnagogic States (2008)\n\nSingles[]\n\nKilling an Arab (1978)\n\nBoys Don't Cry (1979)\n\nJumping Someone Else's Train (1979)\n\nI'm a Cult Hero (1979)\n\nCharlotte Sometimes (1981)\n\nLet's Go to Bed (1982)\n\nThe Walk (1983)\n\nThe Lovecats (1983)\n\nBoys Don't Cry (New Voice - New Mix) (1986)\n\nTours[]\n\nNotes[]"
