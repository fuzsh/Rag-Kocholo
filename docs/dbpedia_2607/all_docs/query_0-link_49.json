        "text": "Adélaïde de Bethune (1914-2002), known as Ade Bethune, was born in Brussels, Belgium. She and her family immigrated to the United States and settled in New York in 1928. Here, she attended Cathedral High School, the National Academy of Design, and Cooper Union. Newport, Rhode Island became her permanent home in 1938.\n\nWhile still living in New York in the 1930s, her experiences with the Catholic Worker movement gave her an outlet to help shape her social justice beliefs and to develop skills in social justice activities—specifically public speaking and writing. These experiences carried over into her involvement in the many local organizations and social justice concerns with which she was active later in life, including the Church Community Housing Corporation (CCHC). In addition, Ade became well known as a liturgical artist and architectural consultant. The skills and experience gained from this work gave her a foundation for the design of CCHC housing project plans.\n\nAde Bethune served on the founding Board of Directors of the CCHC and remained on the board throughout her life; she held the position of Treasurer from 1970-1976, of Vice President from 1977-1978, and of President during 1979. As well as being an active member of the Board of Directors, she contributed to the CCHC through the architectural design of many of the CCHC new homes and rehabilitation projects. She conducted much of the research to design and coordinate the construction of the CCHC Solar House, which was the first solar house in Newport, Rhode Island. She also put her skills to work in the artwork, layout, and editing for logos, publications, and newsletters associated with CCHC activities and CCHC sponsored property projects. Bethune remained actively involved in this and other local organizations concerned with social and environmental issues until her death in 2002.\n\nThe Church Community Corporation was incorporated in Newport, Rhode Island on November 18, 1969. The name was changed to the Church Community Housing Corporation (CCHC) in 1985. Its founders include Phil and Alma Stocklin, Sister Francis Xavier, Canon Lockett Ballard, Frank Boyle, Peter Grimes, and Lyle Matthews. CCHC started operations in July 1970 and the officers of the first Board of Directors were Hershel M. Carter, President; Rev. Canon Lockett F. Ballard, Vice President; Alma K. Stocklin, Secretary, and Ade Bethune, Treasurer.\n\nCCHC was established as a non-profit organization whose aim was to help low and moderate-income citizens of Aquidneck Island, and later, all of Newport County, to live in safe and affordable housing. It has used the help of local, state, and federal programs and private and foundational support to carry out projects of homeownership, house rehabilitation, neighborhood revitalization, low income rental housing, emergency and transitional housing, special needs housing, housing for the elderly, and homeowner/buyer education.\n\nOver the years, a small staff helped to carry out the CCHC operations. At various times, staff members included an executive director, housing specialist, office assistant, and rehab supervisor. Volunteers were also used to help with the labor of housing rehabilitation and new house construction; these included Rogers High School carpentry students, VISTA volunteers, the Neighborhood Youth Corps program, and other volunteers from the community.\n\nFunding for the first years of the CCHC’s activities came from loans and grants from the Rhode Island Department of Community Affairs and from donations made by churches, community organizations, and private entities. Through the utilization of Section 235 of the 1968 Housing Act for low income mortgage financing, CCHC built & rehabilitated 33 single family homes to sell to low income families at a reduced initial mortgage cost and low interest. The CCHC also became a Section 237 Home Ownership Counseling Agency in which participant homebuyers may be granted FHA insured mortgages.\n\nIn 1973, with the discontinuation of the Section 235 program and the withdrawal of the US Navy operations in the area, the CCHC changed its focus to rehabilitating properties with the purpose of renting to low income families under the new US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 program. The Navy withdrawal brought about a decline in local incomes and a surplus of vacant properties.\n\nIn 1976 the CCHC was given authority by the City of Newport City Council to administer Community Development Block Grant funding received by the city through the Redevelopment Agency of Rhode Island’s Residential Rehabilitation Loan and Grant program which was established through the Community Development Act of 1974. The loan & grant program helped existing homeowners make health and safety related improvements.\n\nLater, CCHC expanded to serve all of Newport County, which includes the cities of Middletown, Portsmouth, Jamestown, Tiverton, and Little Compton. As its scope expanded, it worked with the Rhode Island Housing Mortgage Finance Corp. (RIHMFC) to administer Community Development Block Grant money to the cities of Newport County.\n\nIn the 1990s CCHC helped in establishing additional housing programs. In 1992 it established its Newport Community Land Trust program in which CCHC kept the rights to the land of CCHC rehabilitated homes so that the homes located on the land will continue to be sold to low and moderate income families. In addition, the CCHC Homebuyer Club was established as a homebuyer education program. During this time, CCHC also helped local communities establish a Homeownership Assistance Loan Program and a Residential Rehabilitation Revolving Loan Fund. The first was intended to help low to moderate income homebuyers with no-interest loans to be used as a down payment, and the latter provided homeowners with low interest loans for rehabilitation improvements.\n\nOver the years, grant funding for specific projects was applied for and received from the Peyton Hazard Foundation, the Housing Assistance Section of DCA, the Urban Emergency Fund of United Way, the Campaign for Human Development, the City of Newport, and HUD. The RI Department of Community Affairs and the New England Non-Profit Housing Development Corporation (NENPHDC) in Concord, New Hampshire also helped in providing technical assistance and in providing seed money for property acquisitions.\n\nUnique among the CCHC’s housing projects was the Solar House located on Halsey Street; it was the first solar house in the city of Newport. Much of the collection for the years of 1975-1976 is dedicated to the work that Bethune put into the design, planning, funding, and coordination of this project. While many of the CCHC’s early housing projects were house rehabilitation projects, the Solar House was new construction done in cooperation with a class from the Rogers Vocational School. Architectural plans for the house construction include plans for the incorporation of solar heating technologies.\n\nOther housing projects with a specific focus included elderly housing and other special needs housing. Elderly housing projects included Mumford Manor in the City of Newport, Forest Farm Assisted Living in Middletown, Pemberton Place in Jamestown, Anthony House in Portsmouth, and West House in Middletown. Projects to address special housing needs include Villa Nia, in Middletown, a development of 15 accessible houses for those with physical disabilities; Oxford House, to support recovery of drug or alcohol abuse; and Washington Square, which provides apartments, transitional, and emergency housing facilities for the homeless.\n\nThe CCHC also helped sponsor Harbor House in the City of Newport, an elderly cooperative community with mixed incomes. This project was incorporated into the Star of the Sea Corporation."
