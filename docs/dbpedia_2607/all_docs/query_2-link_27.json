        "text": "What you may not know is that academia has been part of her DNA almost all of her life. She met her husband Ben Prasad while she was an undergrad at the University of Wisconsin in the early 1960’s. She put her college education on pause to raise a family – even delaying learning to drive until her 30’s. Moving around the country from Wisconsin to Minnesota to Nevada and then Ohio – the life of a wife of an untenured professor-for-hire. Many of you have probably packed up a carload of memories and family members - and made this same journey in life as well.\n\nAthens – and Ohio University – was a good place to settle down, establish roots. For her husband, it was the start of a full professorship career, for her it was the opportunity to raise now two children and become a part of a community of faith and friends and eventually push the “play” button back on continuing her own education. Twenty-plus years in Athens, one apartment and three different houses, and a bachelor’s degree with honors in English and an MBA from OU. Finally, she earned her PhD in Finance from the University of Cincinnati – and it was off to Mount Pleasant and Central Michigan University.\n\nMeanwhile, her husband was ready for his second chapter and a new home base at CMU as well. Their lives revolved around church, family, friends and CMU football, theatre and the University Libraries. Their academic lives were symbiotic in many ways – his was the life of research and writing, hers was aligned towards teaching and committee meetings. She has represented CMU as an instructor on military bases and foreign countries. She excelled at teaching. Acclaim from co-workers and students alike on being fair and even-handed; granting extra credit for showing school spirit. She once received a “hot tamale” badge from one of her students, on one of those rate-my-professor websites.\n\nFinally retiring in 2011, her third chapter in life has brought her to world travel and a more direct impact to Mount Pleasant’s community of needs. Even a pandemic could not stop her from Food Pantry work and a leadership role with the Mount Pleasant Rotary – she has continued her connections to family, friends and faith.\n\nW. Sidney (Sid) Smith has a long history with CMU that traces back to growing up on Washington Street. His father, Woodward C. Smith, was a history professor at CMU and later became Vice President of Public Services. Smith Hall is named in his honor.\n\nBusiness is in Sid’s blood. He was born to be an entrepreneur. Long before being the CEO of Smith Equities, Sid started his first business as a child selling Kool-Aid on Washington Street for three cents a cup. His second business was in high school when he began washing cars for extra change. After marrying his wife Judy and graduating from CMU with a B.S. degree in business administration, Sid quickly discovered that a typical 9-5 job was not for him. In 1968, he began brokering newspapers with his father. But once the newspaper business began to dry up, he decided to try his hand in building apartment complexes. This is when he discovered his true passion, real estate, and founded Smith Equities.\n\nThroughout the years, Sid has been an active member of the Mount Pleasant and CMU communities. He was elected Mayor in 1977, voted the Mount Pleasant Citizen of the year in 1993, and currently serves as Chairman of the National Charter School Institute. In 1999, Sid and Judy formed the W. Sidney and Judy French Smith Family Fund with the Mount Pleasant Area Community Foundation. The fund is used to support community gathering places and parks.\n\nAt CMU, Sid has served as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees in the 1990s and worked with former Governor John Engler to name CMU as the first authorizer of Charter Schools in the state. Sid also served on the National Campaign Committee, CBA Campaign Committee, Dean’s Business Advising Council, and the College of Medicine Campaign Committee. In 2007, Sid received the CBA Distinguished Alumni Award and was honored with a Doctorate Degree of Commercial Science from CMU. In 2013, Sid and Judy received the Dick Enberg CMU Alumni Commitment Award.\n\nToday, Sid and Judy continue to give back to the university. Together they have helped fund CMU’s Medical School, Education and Human Services Building, and the W. Sidney and Judith French Smith Medical Scholarship.\n\nDr. Vetter came to CMU from Drake University in 1987 as an assistant professor in the finance department. He received his PhD in finance from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, his MBA from the University of South Dakota, his BA in business from Dakota Wesleyan University and his BS in Health Administration from Ithaca College.\n\nHe held numerous leadership positions in the College of Business Administration, including three years as interim dean, six as associate dean and 10 as senior associate dean. Before retiring, Dr. Vetter was the longest serving senior officer in CMU's academic division. He was instrumental in countless campus projects, committees and organizations. His involvement spans everything from contract negotiations, MBA Program Director, the creation of the Martha Seger Investment Fund, to service as president of the CMU chapter of Beta Gamma Sigma. Dr. Vetter was a project leader and principal investigator for the largest contract in CBA history – a $2.0 million dollar collaboration with Dow Chemical Corporation that led to the development of CBA's Lean Six Sigma green belt and black belt certification programs. He also guided the college through three rounds of accreditation as the lead accreditation officer. He has impacted generations of students, faculty and staff with his intelligence, creativity and steady leadership.\n\n“CMU is where my course started. Everyone has that starting point. And I am proud to say mine was here.” Jon Voigtman.\n\nJon graduated with a BSBA in Marketing in 1984. After graduation, he began his professional career at Electronic Data Systems and then started his finance career at Freddie Mac. He has also held positions with Ocwen Financial Corporation, HSBC Securities, Goldman Sachs, and Lehman Brothers. Currently, Jon serves as Managing Director and Senior Officer at RBC Capital Markets in the Bahamas. He joined RBC Capital Markets in 2007 where he was responsible for the performance and liquidity of a multibillion dollar US and Canadian investment portfolio. He has held several board positions including: the American Securitization Forum (the investment banking trade group), TrueCredit (now a TransUnion company), and Ocwen Financial Services.\n\nJon, along with his wife Terri, have long been loyal supporters of the CBA and CMU. He has provided transformational experiences for CBA financial students, with the Voigtman Family Endowed Scholarship, and students from all colleges and majors with his participation in the New Venture Competition as a finals judge. He was a keynote speaker at Dialogue Days and served on the CMU Advancement Board and CBA Business Roundtable. The Voigtman name is synonymous with generosity. Their name can be found across campus spanning numerous programs and departments.\n\nThe late Doug Iles began his career as a Merrill Lynch Wealth Management Advisor in 1981 and formed The Iles Group seven years later. Throughout his career, he was frequently recognized as one of Barron's top financial advisors.\n\nIles brought transformational change to the personal financial program at CMU and helped dozens of students start their careers.\n\nHe channeled his knowledge of the industry to secure a Certified Financial Planning® Board certification for the university's personal financial planning program — making it one of only three CFP® Board-registered bachelor's degree programs in Michigan. As a professor and dedicated mentor, Iles helped dozens of students excel in the classroom and launch successful careers.\n\n\"He was an incredible man. Not only did he see value in me and decide he was willing to spend time mentoring me, he carved out so much time for all of his students,\" Dan Ingles, a 2015 CMU alumnus, said of Iles. \"He is the reason I went to work at Merrill Lynch.\"\n\nIles connected students with prominent employers attending on-campus financial planning program career events. He also developed and facilitated a CFP® boot camp to better prepare students for the CFP® certification exam. His guidance helped lead a team of students to second place at the 2016 International Association of Registered Financial Consultants National Plan Competition.\n\nIn addition to his many contributions directly to students and the personal financial planning program, Iles leveraged his success and knowledge to advance the university as a whole. He served a member of the Development Board, as well as chair of the Development Board Investment Committee and CMU Medical School Fundraising Committee.\n\nForward-thinking. Entrepreneurial. Innovative. These and more describe the incredible career and achievements of Dave Underwood.\n\nUnderwood founded two companies — Integral Technologies and Exacq Technologies. His down-to-earth demeanor and business savvy helped shape the businesses from the ground up and earned both a place on Inc. magazine's list of the 500 fastest growing private companies in America.\n\n\"I truly love seeing something created from scratch,\" Underwood said of his career.\n\nWhile Underwood and his partners sold Exacq Technologies in 2013, he remains active with the group. He also currently serves as the vice president and general manager of Johnson Controls.\n\nUnderwood's companies have employed hundreds of people. His teams have developed common products and technologies that many of us use today, including the first digital video recorder.\n\nUnderwood credits his success to the opportunities that were available to him as a student at CMU. His belief that a good education is an avenue to future success has led him to remain engaged with CMU and the next generation of business students.\n\nAs a Dow Corning Executive-in-Residence, Underwood has shared his business and entrepreneurial expertise with CMU students and faculty. He also lends his advice to students competing in CMU's New Venture Competition. In addition to his many contributions to the College of Business Administration, Underwood donated state-of-the-art technology from his companies to benefit CMU.\n\nMichael F. O’Donnell has had a storied career and is consistently sharing his knowledge and achievements with the university’s students, faculty and alumni. O’Donnell became a partner at Arthur Andersen within 10 years, then became head of it’s World Oil & Gas Industry practice. In 2002, O’Donnell co-founded Protiviti. Currently, he is chairman of the board for Unitek Global Services. “As I think about my successes in the business world, it’s not about the money I earned or the deals I was part of; it is all about the people. I was fortunate to have successes that allowed me to create job and career opportunities for many, many people,” said O’Donnell, who in 2004 received an honorary doctor of commercial science degree from CMU. “CMU provided me a sound education, but it really taught me to do the best you can at everything you do.”\n\nLeonard E. Plachta, Ph.D., proudly served the university as professor, dean of the College of Business and from 1992-2000 he was the 11th president of CMU. He was a man of integrity who had a heart for students and a passion for change. He led his department, college and university by practicing the very business principles CBA teaches. During his tenure as president he established one of the first leadership scholar programs in the country, expanded CMU's off-campus programs and advocated for improving medical services for the underprivileged in rural areas. A few of the most notable accomplishments during his time as dean was earning the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business accreditation for both CBA and the School of Accounting and the creation of the Applied Business Studies Complex. CMU stands where it does today in large part due to the leadership and dedication of Leonard Plachta."
