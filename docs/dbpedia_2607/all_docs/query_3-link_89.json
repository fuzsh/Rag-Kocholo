        "text": "Jupiter Crash\n\nooo. We’re back to the moody sound that I like. And we’ve got a classic long intro.\n\nI didn’t read the lyrics as I was playing it on my phone since Amazon Music didn’t have them for this one. I thought I caught some happiness here, and most of the lyrics are!… until we get to the end. I should have known the rug would be pulled out from the narrator based on the song’s title.\n\nNow this is a Cure song to me. Dare I say it’s too short overall despite the intro?\n\nI had go tended to give this a 3.5 but I’m bumping to a 4.0 after a review of the lyrics and another play.\n\n4/5\n\nThis is the kind of nonsense a group gets up to when no-one knows what the singles should be. Including the record label.\n\nJupiter Crash\n\nWhen I first popped WMS on a couple of weeks ago, this was easily the standout and it still is. It feels very KMKMKM to me - it has the same feel; slightly ramshackle psych with reverse reverb and odd noises zipping away in the background. The main riff made me think of Cranes, of whom Smith was, of course, particularly fond. Its reflective melancholy feels totally unforced and the unusual structure is to its benefit; a non-repeating chorus feels like a peak Cure move. \"So much for gravity\" is a wonderful closing line too. Whether or not they lost this one in the studio is in the ear of the beholder - I don't think they did, I think they just chose to locate the song where its title suggests, floating in the airlessness of space. Top drawer Cure. 4.5/5.\n\nLooks like a \"too much money\" problem to me. It was the mid-90s, no downloads or streaming, you were going to sell a million $20 CDs just on the name of a band alone. People were spending $1 million+ on music videos at the time... commissioning all of those remixes... excess, excess, excess. A band like The Cure was probably never supposed to be in the mainstream. Robert himself has even said that the record companies had never understood the band - always trying to push them in directions to gain new fans, when it was them following their own instincts that allowed the fan base to grow so huge and devoted in the first place. Having what was probably an endless budget by the time of WMS, those outside voices probably started to get a lot more vocal, those pressures probably started to weigh down on the band, leading to all of these questionable decisions around this time.\n\nForgot to vote. JC - 4/5\n\nTotally agree. Although, sometimes I slash harder to get it from a good album to what is arguably a great one. As with Wish, the CD era turns a double album into a single and results in too many songs being needed for an album plus multiple singles. Faith was 8 songs plus an instrumental b-side. Pornography was 8 songs plus two live b-sides. WMS as a 35-ish minute 8-10 track album is pretty solid.\n\nI quite like the brevity of the lyric. A nice little vignette.\n\nI'm not keen on 4:13 Dream, but maintain that there's a good album across the S/T era's album & B-side tracks with some tweaking to the track selection / running order. The album as is, I find similarly infuriating to WMS, in that not all the songs are up to scratch. There are some really excellent ones though as we will discuss before long. I know not everyone likes Bloodflowers, but for me it's the best post-Wish album from start to finish.\n\nBut before all that we have more WMS to both endure and enjoy. Not much joy in it for the next 2 days for me\n\nMy strong negative feelings about S/T are mainly about the 11 track version the ****ing American record company gave us. You at least got one of the amazing songs from that era on UK release.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself, since we have such WMS gems to look forward to…..\n\nThat said, 3iB, 17S, Faith, Pornography were all made one after the other in a 4 year burst. Maybe WMS is too long, and needs to be trimmed to a short, 50 minute burst of brilliance, but it is the result of four years of writing (albeit, sidelined by a long tour, and significant periods of upheaval forced by legal and lineup issues) and not one year.\n\nI heard that in this period, between 1993-1995, the label offered Robert a 'year out' fully paid to recuperate before coming back recharged - they'd only extended that offer to Paul Weller (who also took it), and Miles Hunt, who declined, as he didn't want to think he owed anyone anything.\n\nPerrys not a virtuoso that excels at guitar or keyboards, however is a solid, reliable, unshowy player. In terms of who was 'terrible' in The Cure, it's clearly Lol. Perry was more of a dependable all rounder than a widdly-woo fretboard wanking show off.\n\nYep. I always like it when the roadie is better than the member he's replacing, but considering he was originally meant to fill the Roger O'Donnell void, I'm thinking that didn't happen here.\n\nIf I were Lol, I'd have taken piano lessons after being fired from The Cure to become a Chopin level player out of pure spite.\n\nPerry was playing guitar in bands in the late 1970s. So, playing guitar a long long time. He knows how to play guitar and he can play guitar very well.\n\nIf he had been in a billion other indie guitar bands nobody would have ever said a word about him, however he happened to join a band which included Porl Thompson and then had to replace Porl entirely. Thus he had a yardstick that 99% of guitarists could not hope to match up to.\n\nFor some reason some people make out like he can't even play a chord, yet he managed somehow to be a Cure guitarist for 14 years first time round, over 10 of those as lead guitarist, managing to play three hour shows around the world over and over and over again through all those years.\n\nHis only crime it seems is he can't play as many notes in the FTEOTDGS solo as Porl can. That's about it in reality.\n\nHe plays all the Cure material as well as anyone.\n\nI didn’t even know untill now that people had issues with him. I think he is a fine guitarplayer.\n\nThe way people were going on in this thread, I figured they were trying to find polite ways to say that Perry sucks. The backbones of several Cure songs are beginner/novice level on guitar and keyboards. It was starting to sound like people meant he couldn't even really play up to that standard.\n\nI never really made the connection about Porl being a super virtuoso player either. I guess as a metal fan, I have a pretty high standard for calling someone technically brilliant. I do like Porl's playing better than most shredders though.\n\nBy all accounts, Porl carried Page on the '96 tour with Plant."
