        "text": "Simon Gallup\n\n26\n\nSimon Gallup’s first marriage was to Carol Thompson, a former secretary who had also contributed backing vocals to the Mag/Spys recordings in 1979. They had two children together, Eden (born 18 March 1990) and Lily (born 7 September 1992), before they divorced. Simon married his second wife Sarah in December 1997, and they have at least one child together, named Evangeline ‘Evie’ Gallup. According to The Cure’s Chain of Flowers Newsletter, the title to The Mission’s 2001 single Evangeline was dedicated by Wayne Hussey to Evie Gallup, although the lyrics were “about someone else altogether”.[7] Gallup’s eldest son Eden, who also goes by the name Ed Vendetta, is the frontman and lead guitarist for rock band Violet Vendetta [8], formed in 2004. Citing The Cure and Guns N’ Roses as influences, since 2006 Violet Vendetta have released one EP and two full-length albums.[9]\n\nReferences\n\n[1]Barbarian, Sutherland, Smith, The Cure: Ten Imaginary Years, Zomba Books, 1987, p. 120.

O'Donnell has also performed in the Psychedelic Furs, the Thompson Twins and Berlin, as well as having an active solo career.\n\nBackground\n\nO'Donnell was born in East London into a musical family, next to the piano in his parents' London home.[2] O'Donnell attended Art School but left to pursue a career as a professional musician, with his first paying gig coming in 1976, at Oxford Town Hall backing legendary British pop icon Arthur Brown.\n\nIn the early 1980s, while with The Thompson Twins, Berlin, and The Psychedelic Furs, O'Donnell was a big fan of synthesisers produced by Sequential Circuits, which produced such classics as the Prophet 5, Prophet T8, and Prophet VS. While on tour with The Psychedelic Furs, O'Donnell set the record for having the most Sequential models onstage at one time.\n\nRoger O'Donnell\n\n28\n\nTenure with The Cure\n\nO'Donnell first joined The Cure in 1987, replacing Lol Tolhurst on keyboards, after being longtime friends with drummer Boris Williams. He played with The Cure during their Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me tour, though he did not contribute to the album. (He does however appear in the music videos for \"Just Like Heaven\" and \"Hot Hot Hot!!!\" and appeared in tour promo art.) With O'Donnell on keyboards, Porl Thompson was able to focus on guitar full time, instead of assisting Tolhurst on keyboards for many of the songs. Some of O'Donnell's performances from this tour can be heard on the deluxe edition of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me.\n\nFor the next album Disintegration, O'Donnell became a fully integrated member of the band, and his songwriting contributions can be heard on the songs \"Untitled\" and \"Fear of Ghosts,\" which is the B-Side to the hit single \"Lovesong.\" He is also featured on the live album from this period, Entreat. Following The Cure's Prayer Tour in 1989, O'Donnell left the band temporarily in 1990 due to a difference of opinion with some of the other members.\n\nDuring the Cure's period of greatest success, O'Donnell was the band's only member to play piano and keyboards as his primary instrument. Previous keyboardist Lol Tolhurst also played drums for a time and subsequent keyboardist Perry Bamonte later switched to guitar. O'Donnell rejoined The Cure in 1995 and appeared on the albums Wild Mood Swings, Bloodflowers, and The Cure. He also appears on the live DVD Trilogy. During this period it is notable that O'Donnell introduced the band to digital recording.\n\nWhen O'Donnell started working on his solo album The Truth In Me in early 2005, he stated that he had no plans to leave The Cure. However, later in that year Robert Smith decided to reconfigure The Cure as a trio, without O'Donnell or Perry Bamonte. O'Donnell would later confirm that the rumour of him being fired by E-mail was false, and if The Cure hadn't been reduced to a trio he would have left regardless to concentrate on solo material.\n\nIn May 2011, O'Donnell and Laurence Tolhurst reunited with The Cure to perform the band's first three albums - Three Imaginary Boys, Seventeen Seconds, and Faith - in their entirety at the Sydney Opera House in Australia.[3] The set also included a number of B-sides and singles played during the encore.\n\nOn September 11 O'Donnell announced on his Facebook page that he had rejoined The Cure.\n\nSolo work\n\nO’Donnell’s current solo career commenced when he was asked to submit a song for a documentary being made about Bob Moog, “Moog”. This was in early 2004 whilst he was still a member of The Cure. Later that year whilst helping to promote the film with its producer Ryan Page at the Sheffield Documentary Festival, conversation led to the suggestion that O’Donnell should write an entire album of music composed and recorded in the same way as the song “Another Year Away”. The song was composed entirely and performed solely on a Minimoog Voyager.\n\nLater that year and into early 2005 when work with The Cure had ended O’Donnell completed the project which was to become “The Truth In Me” the album released in 2006.\n\nIn the Summer of 2005 O’Donnell and his longtime partner and collabrator Erin Lang formed their own label with the idea of supporting and encouraging otherwise unsignable artists, mainly in the electronic genre, and releasing their own music. The first release was in September 2005, a sampler “Nothing Concrete” featuring songs from 10 unsigned artists. The label is called 99 Times Out of 10 or 99X/10.\n\nIn discussions to find a distributor in the U.S. Roger was offered a record deal with independent label group Worlds Fair on their new Warner Brothers distributed label Great Society.\n\nO’Donnell released two albums with Great Society, “The Truth In Me” in 2006 and “Songs Form The Silver Box” in 2009. Both featuring Erin Lang on vocals with a special guest appearance from Australian singer Lenka on the latter. An EP of remixes was also released from “The Truth In Me” featuring versions by Dntel, Fourtet and Console all very highly regarded artists in the electronic field.\n\nRoger O'Donnell\n\n29\n\nRoger’s association with World's Fair and Great Society came to an end in 2009 when the label folded. All of his and Erin Lang’s future releases will be handled by 99X/10.\n\nFuture projects nearing completion as of Spring 2010 are a collection of songs for piano, cello and voice entitled Two/Three - Before. The trio features O'Donnell on piano, Erin Lang, vocals and longtime friend Paul van Dongen on Cello. A preview concert performance in Toronto in February 2010 with the Corktown Chamber Orchestra led to another project which O’Donnell has composed for the orchestra, Quieter Trees.\n\nQuieter Trees is a group of six songs inspired by a painting by British artist David Hockney “Bigger Trees Near Warter”. It was peformed in London Morley College by the Centre for Young Musicians on July 2nd 2011 and it will be performed in November in Toronto this time with O'Donnell playing piano.[4]\n\nAlso in a nod to his tenure with The Cure O’Donnell has formed a group with Bassist and vocalist Norelle French from the Toronto group Machetes. The project entitled Unterbrucke is a dark and intense collection of songs which will be released on an album entitled Detach in October 2010.\n\nSolo\n\n•Grey Clouds, Red Sky (previously unreleased instrumental solo album recorded in 1994.

The Thompson Twins became a duo (following the departure of Joe Leeway) had recorded a song for the film Nothing in Common starring Tom Hanks and featuring the last ever performance by Jackie Gleason. The video for the song of the same name as the movie was shot on location in Chicago, with Hanks making a cameo appearance playing drums. O'Donnell appeared playing the keyboards.\n\nRoger O'Donnell\n\n30\n\nReferences\n\n[1]http://www.rogerodonnell.com\n\n[2]\"\"Info\" at\" (http://www.rogerodonnell.com/info.html).
