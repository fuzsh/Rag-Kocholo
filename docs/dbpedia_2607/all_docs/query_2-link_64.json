        "text": "Michael Ahrnsbrak’s esteemed forty-year golf career earned him the Hall of Fame recognition by the Middle Atlantic PGA. His contributions to education, leadership and administration in the Section began as a young Assistant Professional first at Leesburg Golf and Country Club, then Woodmont Country Club, and culminated in election by his peers as one of the PGA of America’s fourteen District Directors. Throughout Mike’s tenure in the Section he served, as a Head Professional at Shenandoah Valley (1985-1999), followed by a number of years in management and organizational consulting, then returning to the Head Professional and General Manager ranks at Musket Ridge (2003-2006), Blue Ridge Shadows (2003-2016) and Lexington Country Club (2017-2018). Mike is currently the GM/COO at Pine Valley Country Club in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nOriginally from Seattle, the son of a US Navy Chaplain, Mike started swinging golf clubs quite early, maybe only a year old. His father’s naval career meant many moves for the family, so his first golf memory is caddying, actually pulling the cart, for his father in Rhode Island, before moves to San Diego, then Florida, and attending high school at four different locations, including Florida, New Jersey, Missouri and Virginia. Though baseball was a first love, eventually golf became the prime interest. During a short stay in Missouri, he played against Payne Stewart in junior and high school competitions, and in 1971 won the Missouri State Junior title. Then in Virginia at Herndon HS, he lost the District High School Championship by one shot to fellow inductee Wayne DeFrancesco. After attending Rollins College, Mike turned professional and secured an assistant’s position to Billy Pearl at Leesburg Golf and Country Club. Soon thereafter, he won a Pro-Am at Goose Creek. Before becoming a Head Professional he was schooled by Hall of Fame member Tony Marlowe as an Assistant Professional at Woodmont.\n\nThe “service” relationship in the MAPGA began with an Assistant Directorship in the Junior Golf Academy in 1979, followed by becoming Director in 1981. The membership elected him MAPGA A-8 Director in 1982. As a significant member of the Section, he first earned Assistant Professional of the Year honors in 1983. Within the Central Chapter, Mike moved up through the leadership ranks from Tournament Chair, Vice President and then President. His contributions to education earned him the Horton Smith Award in 1990. He followed that with a Merchandiser of the Year (Resort) Award in 1991. Under MAPGA President and Hall of Fame member, Allen Wronowski, he was appointed the Chair of the Employment Committee. Mike was named MAPGA Professional of the Year in 1992, the Section’s highest active honor. Once he won election to the MAPGA Section Secretary position in 1992, Vice President (1994-95) and President (1996-1997) ensued. After moving through the ranks to the MAPGA Section Presidency, Mike Ahrnsbrak earned the highest distinction from his colleagues when they elected him to serve on the PGA National Board of Directors as the District 10 Director in 2010, a three-year term.\n\nIn 1997, the Dewar’s Virginia Hall of Fame for Virginia Golf Professionals named him as one of their own. Additionally, his credits include a Golf Digest “Beat Teacher in Virginia” recognition in 2000; and an “America’s Top 100 Golf Shops” by Golf Shop Operators Magazine in 1991. Also, he hosted at the National level a “Seminar and Social for Non-PGA and Developing Golf Facilities.”\n\nAs a leader in the Section, Mike foremost accomplishments include a major role in bringing on Colonel Dick Johns as Executive Director, and Jon Guhl as Assistant Executive Director in 1995. He followed up as a team member that created the MAPGA “Superfund” that eventually paid for the purchase of land and the construction of an office complex unmatched throughout the PGA Section communities, replete with conference rooms, museum and library.\n\nAs a player, he earned his way into qualifying for five PGA Club Professional Championships, now deemed the Professional National Championship. Mike has won at least one section event in each decade of his career. Additionally, he played in the 1985 PGA Tour stop in Washington, the Kemper Open, and then the 1992 Anheuser Busch Classic and the 1994 Nike Tour Dominion Open.\n\nInfluences on his career and good work beyond his parents who introduced him to the game and championed his passion, are major figures in MAPGA circles, many of whom are Hall of Fame members, notably Bill Pearl, Carl Rasnic, Tony Marlowe, David Wortman, Bill Strausbaugh, Hank Majewski and Jim Folks.\n\n1896 – 1949. Robert Barnett, a native Philadelphian, rose to prominence in PGA circles as a founding member and President of two sections, the Philadelphia and the Middle Atlantic. He served the national PGA as a Vice President between 1944 and 1946 as well. The Philadelphia Section elected Bob their first President in 1922. He moved to the Chevy Chase Club in 1923. The Middle Atlantic PGA (MAPGA) membership elected him President twice, the first time for two consecutive terms, 1926 and 1927, succeeding the legendary Fred McLeod, and the second time in 1933.\n\nBob Barnett began his professional career as an assistant at the Bala Golf Club in suburban Philadelphia in 1914. Three years later he took the assistant position at the Pocono Manor Inn. US Army duty with the Fifty-Fourth Infantry landed him in France for a year as an infantry instructor during World War I. After the War Bob returned to Pocono Manor as the Head Professional for a year before accepting the head position at Tredyffrin CC in Berwyn, Pa, where he stayed until 1923. In a 1933 interview Bob reminisced how after the war he spent seven and eight hour practice sessions hitting hundreds of balls day after day to enhance his game.\n\nAs a player he won the Philadelphia Section championship twice, 1923 and 1925. The Philadelphia membership held Bob in such high esteem that even though he took the Chevy Chase position, they invited him to play in their Section championship. Bob won the 1929 MAPGA Section title besting J. Munro Hunter in the final match, but lost the Sectional title in 1931 to R. Cliff McKimmie.\n\nNationally, he played in seven US Opens, finishing 35th at Columbia in 1921 followed by a tie for 54th in 1925. In PGA Championships Bob lost a first round match in 1921, then in 1923 won a first round match before losing. He qualified for the PGA Championship again in 1924, 1945 and 1946. Locally, he finished second in the 1948 Maryland Open. In 1929, he shot a five under 64 on the Chevy Chase layout.\n\nIn a history of the The PGA, Herb Graffis cited Bob’s statement to the 1932 National Convention that “There are real-estate men in New York and Chicago who would give the PGA land, a golf course, and a club-house for a club on its own and make a large profit out of what a PGA club would do to increasing the value of surrounding property.” Certainly, Bob was thinking far ahead of those in his generation. Furthermore, he served on the 1941 PGA Teaching Program Committee headed up by a future PGA President, Joe Novak.\n\nFor about twenty years, Bob held the “winter” Head Professional position at one of South Florida’s premier clubs, Indian Creek in Miami. During that time two of his “winter” assistants included two future PGA and MAPGA Hall of Fame members: Max Elbin and Bill Strausbaugh Jr.\n\nAfter World War II when The PGA launched the “Wounded Veteran’s Rehabilitation Program,” Bob not only spearheaded the MAPGA efforts, but served on the National PGA Committee chaired by Frank Sprogell, the PGA Secretary. Robert Barnett’s contributions to the Middle Atlantic PGA, the Philadelphia PGA and the National PGA continued long after his premature demise in 1949 at age 53.\n\nOn a personal side, Bob could whistle with the best of them. He played golf whistling and when he needed to call a meeting to order or get everyone’s attention, he called on his famous whistling. (rev. 2011)\n\nThe District of Columbia Professional Golfers’ Association, a forerunner of the MAPGA, elected Fred McLeod their first President, and Bob Barnett and Leo Diegel to the first and second Vice Presidents positions in their inaugural meeting in April 1924. The next year, Bob and McLeod were instrumental figures in the formation of the MAPGA Section in March, 1925, along with Charles Betschler, President of the Maryland State Professional Golfers’ Association. The Maryland and District of Columbia organizations ceased operations in 1927 and 1928, respectively.\n\nJefferson Lakeside Country Club, Richmond, Virginia\n\nTom Barry’s unparalleled service and contributions to the Middle Atlantic PGA and the PGA of America span over thirty years. For that he is honored with MAPGA Hall of Fame recognition. Since assuming the Head PGA Professional position at the Jefferson-Lakeside Club in 1983, the MAPGA recognized his excellence and dedication with numerous awards, most notably the Horton Smith Award three times: 1989, 2000, and 2008 for excellence in PGA member education; the President’s Award in 1990; the Bill Strausbaugh Award in 1992 for service to fellow members in employment and club relations; and the MAPGA Professional of the Year Award in 1994. In 2012, the Virginia State Golf Association acknowledged him with the “Service to the Game” award.\n\nAdditionally, within the Section’s Virginia and then Southern Chapter, Tom Barry held the Director-at-Large position for of the Virginia Chapter in 1987 and 1988, served as Secretary of the Southern Chapter for three years between 1990 and 1992, and the Presidency of the Southern Chapter for three years between 1993 and 1995, and as the Honorary President of that Chapter in 1996. As a Committee member, he has held seats on both the Membership Committee and Club Relations & Employment Committee for some fifteen years.\n\nFurthermore, over the years Tom has become well known for his Rules of Golf expertise. After attending many PGA\\USGA rules workshops, and continuing to support the Section as an on-the-course rules official, he became the “go to guy” as many colleagues and even MAPGA staff members call him to confirm or ask for clarity on a ruling. As well, and of considerable importance, since 1990 he is one of the core teachers in MAPGA\\VSGA in Rules of Golf program in Virginia that MAPGA Honorary member Clyde Luther originally developed.\n\nOriginally from Waterbury, Connecticut, Tom was the fifth of eight children reared by Joe and Maryalice Barry, born on October 24, 1952. As a youngster the family relocated to Chicago Heights, Illinois. His golf career began at a local nine-hole venue, Cherry Hills Golf Course, playing alongside his father’s watchful eye just after he had turned nine-years old. At age 13, he joined the caddie ranks, his first golf-related job. From there on out, he worked every summer at the golf course, then becoming the shop assistant before turning professional in 1973.\n\nTom elected to PGA membership in September 1979. Flossmoor Country Club employed him as an Assistant Golf Professional for seven years, from 1973 until 1980. From there Tom’s career moved to the Head PGA Professional ranks at Oregon Golf Club in Oregon, Illinois in 1981 and 1982. Since 1983 Tom Barry has faithfully served the Jefferson Lakeside Club as their Head PGA Professional.\n\nWhile Tom was still a young man, David Ogilvie III, Head PGA Professional at Flossmoor Country Club in Flossmoor, Illinois, won over his esteem to such as extent that it subsequently influenced his decision to make the golf business a career. Tom says that more than anything else that Ogilvie stressed the importance of professionalism and demonstrating a gentleman’s persona at all times. David Ogilvie himself ultimately received the PGA of America “Professional of the Year” award in 1986. Interestingly enough, David Ogilvie’s father held the Head PGA Professional position at Jefferson Lakeside for some fourteen years, 1964 – 1978.\n\nTom and his wife Michelle Hoffmann were married in 1990. He says that there is no way he would have achieved any success in the golf business without her support and encouragement.\n\n1911–1981. Johnny Bass entered the MAPGA Hall of Fame for his notoriety on the golf course and his many years of providing Maryland charities his organizational assistance. He always did his utmost to lend support to boys’ clubs, sports teams, and the fund raising efforts of hospitals and churches. For the golfing community, Johnny is given great credit for bringing the LPGA tour stop to Baltimore.\n\nA native of Baltimore, Johnny started out as an “office boy” in his first job, but left that in 1932 to become the assistant golf professional at Clifton Park Golf Club. From there, John soon moved on to Woodholme Country Club, where his apprenticeship continued under Warner Mather, one of the leaders of the fledging Middle Atlantic Section. After three years he accepted a similar position at Hampton Roads Country Club, but stayed for only six months. In 1936, John returned to Clifton Park as the head PGA Professional where he remained through 1957. After World War II began, he enlisted in the Maritime Service and served as an onboard ship purser. Following more than a decade of service at Clifton Park after the War, he became the first head PGA Professional at the newly constructed Pine Ridge Golf, continuing there until his 1972 retirement.\n\nJohn’s playing career began in a noteworthy fashion when he led the assistant professionals in the Maryland Open at Baltimore CC Five Farms in 1933. He won the 1934 MAPGA Assistant Professional Championship at Baltimore CC Five Farms and then the 1935 MAPGA Section Championship at the “original” Indian Spring course. On his way to the 1935 MAPGA Championship title he defeated Mel Shorey, Charles Betschler, Alec Taylor, and then George Diffenbaugh in the finals for the $100 first place check. All of them were well-regarded players of the 1920s and 30s. In 1938, he played in the first Baltimore City Open at Baltimore CC Five Farms, but lost in the opening round to Charles Betschler.\n\nNationally, Johnny played in four US Opens and two PGA Championships. In 1935, he qualified for the PGA Championship at Rolling Road. However, he did not make the field for the match play portion in the thirty-six hole qualifier at Twin Hills CC in Oklahoma City. John captured medalist honors in the 1936 US Open qualifier at Hillendale. However, he missed the cut in the event held at Baltusrol. Two years later in 1938, he again qualified for the US Open, that time besting George Diffenbaugh in a playoff for the last spot. However, he did not play in the Tournament proper held that year at Cherry Hills in Colorado. After World War II, John qualified for the 1948 US Open at North Hills in Philadelphia, but missed the cut; qualified again in 1952, but missed the cut at Northwood in Dallas; and qualified for the last time in 1954 at Mt. Pleasant and finished in 50th place at Baltusrol. In 1948, he led the field briefly at Riviera Country Club. His last national appearance took place at the Hermitage CC in Richmond when he did not make the match play portion of the 1949 PGA Championship.\n\nIn 1963, John thumped his younger colleagues in the Belair CC pro-am, now Bowie Golf Club, by shooting 68 and gaining a tie with Billy Phillips from Winchester CC and leading the field by two strokes.\n\nJohnny was one of the last tournament players to wear a tie and long-sleeved shirt in competition. His peers named him the MAPGA Merchandiser of the Year (Public Category) in 1980. (rev. 2004)\n\nCharles Bassler, born and raised in Catonsville, Maryland, started in golf at 14 as a Rolling Road Golf Club caddie. In 1941, he won the club championship. During World War II, he served with the First Marines in Okinawa and Peleu. Soon after returning stateside in 1946, he turned professional as an assistant to Robert Barnett at Chevy Chase Club. Charlie was elected to membership in The PGA in 1948. He was the head PGA Professional at Rolling Road GC (1948 through 1958), Turf Valley CC (1959 and 1960), and Indian Spring CC where he remained until his retirement in 1981.\n\nKnown as a big hitter and swing stylist, “Golf Digest” featured Charlie in their initial issue in an instructional piece about driving the ball.\n\nCharlie won the Maryland Open seven times: 1948, 1950, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1958 and 1965. He conquered the field twice in the District of Columbia Open, 1949 and 1952, both times at Indian Spring CC. Charlie defeated Roger Peacock in a playoff to win the 27-hole 1951 Annapolis Roads Open by firing 37-36-33. The 1961 and 1962 Salisbury Open titles are in Charlie’s trophy case and, most impressively, in 1962, he shot 69-68 to win by seven. In regional competition, he lost the 1969 Middle Atlantic Open to Dick Whetzle in a playoff.\n\nCharlie regularly teed it up against national competition in the Eastern Opens in Baltimore when it was a PGA Tour stop in the 1950s at Mt. Pleasant GC. His highest finish occurred in 1953 when he, Chandler Harper, and Doug Ford ended in a three-way tie for second behind Dick Mayer. Then in 1961 and 1962, he finished 6th against the same field. The Uplands Open, South Jersey Open, and the Elizabeth City Open are all tournament victories in his list of titles.\n\nCharlie won the MAPGA Match Play Championship five times: 1949, 1950, 1951, 1954 and 1962, including final match victories over Walter Romans twice, Bill Collins, Andy Gibson and Dick Sleichter. He also lost in the finals to Andy Gibson in 1948 and 1954 and to Walter Romans in 1952. Charlie played in the final match for five consecutive years, 1948 – 1952.\n\nHis trophy shelf also includes the MAPGA Section Championship five times: 1952, 1953, 1957, 1959 and 1960. In 1952 he won by three over Jack Isaacs and Johnny Musser at Bonnie View; a second round 66 at Woodholme in 1953 led to a second title; and the third title came in a playoff over Clare Emery at the Cascades. Only a handful of MAPGA professionals have won the Section Championship in back-to-back years, Charlie did it twice. And he is the only person to triumph in the Section Championship more than three times. Between 1948 and 1960, except for 1956, Charlie won either the Maryland Open or an MAPGA Section Championship. The last title he captured was the MAPGA Pro-Assistant Championship in 1980 with Roger Simpkins.\n\nCharlie played in six U.S. Opens, making the cut three times: 1951(tied for 21st), 1952 (52nd), 1953 (tied for 56th). He also qualified for the 1955 U.S. Open but did not make the trip because of his wife’s illness. In thirteen National PGA Championships, Charlie played his way into the match play field six of the nine times. His best match play performance came in 1951 when he defeated Ed Furgol, Jim Turnesa (1952 PGA Champion), George Balesta, and Al Borsch, before losing to Sam Snead, the eventual winner, in the semifinals. In 1961, in stroke play, he tied for 29th at Olympia Fields. Charlie also competed in the 1952 Masters won by Sam Snead, finishing in a tie for 34th. The MAPGA began naming a Player of the Year in 1955, a title he garnered five times: 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961 and 1962. It is a feat that no one has come close to matching in nearly fifty years. Charlie is in the Maryland Sports Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 1980. (rev. 2004)\n\n1902–1981. Ralph Beach’s forty years of service and commitment to the MAPGA and The PGA places him amongst the most important figures in MAPGA history. He held the presidential reins twice, once in the 1930s and again in the 1940s. The MAPGA Professional of the Year Award was awarded to him in 1959.\n\nOriginally a Virginian, Ralph spent his early years as a caddie at Washington Golf and Country Club, including carrying President Woodrow Wilson’s bag in 1916. He turned professional in 1919 by taking a job as an assistant at the Chevy Chase Club, then moved on to take the head Professional position at Blairmount CC in Altoona, Pennsylvania, during 1924. After one season there, he returned to the Washington area as the Head Professional at the Burning Tree Club, remaining for three years. While at Burning Tree Club he taught the game to President Warren G. Harding. He assumed the head PGA Professional position at The Suburban Club of Baltimore County in 1928, where he held forth until retiring in 1965.\n\nWhen the MAPGA’s initial organizational meeting took place in 1925 at Columbia, Ralph Beach attended. Along with many other duties Ralph served the MAPGA as its Second Vice President in 1930, First Vice President in 1931, and President in 1932. At the member’s behest, he repeated the terms as Vice President and served as President for another two terms, 1939 and 1940. After World War II, the Baltimore contingent endorsed him as their regional vice president in 1948 and 1949. Nationally, Ralph contributed to the formation of the National Senior PGA group and served as its president in 1961 and 1962.\n\nNoted for his beautiful swing and fine shotmaking, Ralph played as a strong competitor throughout four decades: the 1920s – 1950s. He won the 1931 Maryland Open. Ralph captured the MAPGA Section Championship twice, first in 1933 when he defeated the defending champion, Glenn Spencer. Sixteen years later at Woodholme he bested Andy Gibson, Walter Romans and John O’Donnell when he won the title at stroke play. That year he eagled the par-4 7th hole during the afternoon en route to a one-stroke victory over Walter Romans. Ralph triumphed in the Match Play Championship in 1947. Three consecutive MAPGA Senior Championships, 1953 – 1955, are on his golfing credentials as well as four consecutive MAPGA Senior Teacher’s Trophy titles, 1954 – 1957. Additional accomplishments include winning the Maryland Senior Open in 1955 and the Uplands Open Invitational Senior in 1954 and 1955 at Rolling Road.\n\nNear misses included a playoff loss to Al Houghton in the 1933 Maryland Open; losses in the MAPGA Match Play final to Otto Greiner in 1939 and to Walter Romans in 1946, and a MAPGA Championship playoff loss to Chandler Harper in 1954.\n\nNationally, Ralph qualified through the Section for eight National PGA Championships: 1925, 1927, 1930, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1945 and 1949, and twice succeeded in making the match play field, 1927 and 1936. Between 1926 and 1936 he played in eight US Opens, making the cut in 1926, 1933 and 1936. His best finish, a tie for 39th at Scioto CC, occurred in 1926. He played fifteen PGA Senior Championships, making the cut seven times, and finished in a tie for third in 1953. (rev. 2003)\n\nTroy Beck, PGA\n\n1954 – 2021\n\nTroy Beck’s thirty-five-year career in golf was served as one of the Section’s major proponents for and leaders in Junior Golf. Furthermore, as both a stellar player and teacher, the LPGA and MAPGA awarded her for significant contributions to their organizations. She received the inaugural LPGA Nancy Lopez Achievement Award in 2008 for Leadership, Passion, Giving and Approachability. The MAPGA recognized her accomplishments with the 2000 Youth Player Development Award. She was honored with the “Lifetime Achievement Award” from the PGA President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. Additionally, in 2016 she organized a PGA of America HOPE program for Female Veterans with instruction by female professionals.\n\nGrowing up in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and active in many sports and notably basketball where she played for the Regina University team. As a student she double majored in Biology and Physical Education. Golf seasons are rather short in western Canada. However, at ten-years-old, Troy accompanied her father on one of his golf junkets to California and for her introduction to the game. Subsequently a membership to Regina Golf Club paved the way for her career which began as waitress at the club, followed by a stint in the bag room, then pro shop staff and a grounds crew member.\n\nOnce graduating from college, she began playing tournaments, including representing Saskatchewan in the Canadian Nationals to conclude her amateur career. In 1979, the then twenty-four-year-old took a professional position at Soboda Springs CC in Hemet, California. A year later, Troy enrolled in a PGA Business School, one of the first three women to do so. In 1984, Jim Hiskey, a well-known MAPGA Professional at the CC at Woodmore, hired her as an assistant professional. She earned her LPGA membership in 1987, and her PGA membership in 1989. Glen Barrett, the Head PGA Professional at Glenn Dale Golf Club, brought her on as his “first” assistant in 1988. The duo won the MAPGA Pro-Assistant Championship in 1990.\n\nAs an advocate and teacher for juniors, Troy established The Troy Beck Golf Academy. She and the academy became well-known throughout the area by touching the lives of some 800 juniors annually. Many came through the Junior Summer Camp program with some 400 children participating in one of nine camps. Furthermore, the early spring months her junior camps provided “free” instruction to approximately 150 over the four-week duration. The overwhelming participation revealed evidence of the positive image and leadership ability required to conduct such a successful program, which Carl Donner of the USGA called the “champion program of the country.”\n\nWhile maintaining her career long LPGA Class A membership, she organized two LPGA local Girls’ Clubs in conjunction with the USGA and Girl Scouts of America. She also published a quarterly instructional newsletter for junior entitled “Junior Pinseekers,” and another monthly newsletter to LPGA Girls’ Clubs. She won the LPGA’s Teaching and Club Professional Championship in 1994 and in 1995 received the LPGA Northeast Teacher of the Year Award. Noted for her expert use of video golf instruction, Golf For Women listed her in the Top 50 Female Instructors in the Country.” Nineteen of her “students” obtained college golf scholarships. Golf Magazine named her one of the Top Instructors in 2005. Furthermore, she held the LPGA Section President position, placing her on the LPGA Board of Directors, from 2003 – 2007.\n\nWith Canadian climates not conducing to developing golf skills, Troy did not begin serious work on her game until after college. However, when she did, she rapidly emerged as a serious player. In 1984 and 1985 she teed it up in the USGA Women’s Open. Then ten years later played in two more majors, the McDonald’s LPGA Championships. She eventually played in 13 LPGA Tour events. She won the LPGA National T&CP Championship at Woodlands Country Club in Texas in 1994. Within the MAPGA ranks, she took Women’s Player of the Year titles in 1993, 1994, 1998 and 2003 along with the Women’s Championship in 1998. In the 1994 MAPGA Match Play Championship, she knocked out well-known MAPGA stars, including Trent Wright, Craig Gunn, Brian Lehnhard and Wayne DeFrancesco before losing to the winner Glenn Barrett. Once she started spending her “winters” in Port St. Lucie Florida in 2000, Troy could be found teeing off in the PGA “winter” tournaments.\n\nTroy Beck’s countless contributions to Junior Golf in the Middle Atlantic Region and the goodwill she promoted earned her the respect of her peers, her community and thousands of juniors who will never forget the difference she made in their lives. Beck is entering based on her sterling playing credentials and is the first female to be inducted in the MAPGA Hall of Fame.\n\n1895-1983. Charles Betschler’s distinguished golf career included launching two regional golf associations that he ultimately served as President: the Maryland State Professional Golfers’ Association and the Middle Atlantic PGA. The MAPGA Senior Championship Trophy is named in honor of Charles Betschler.\n\nA native of Baltimore, Charles Betschler’s life in golf started as an 11-year-old caddie at the Maryland Country Club. The “old” Maryland CC, situated in the Baltimore’s Arlington section, no longer exists. His enthusiasm soon won him the affection of the golfing members who sought him out as a good luck charm. Displaying quite an aptitude for the game, he began giving tips to beginners by his mid-teens. He became an instructor, the caddie master, and then in 1916 the Head PGA Professional, a position he held until 1928. In 1929 he became the Head PGA Professional at Rodgers Forge Country Club (now the CC of Maryland), then moved to the “original” Hillendale in 1935 where he remained until retirement in 1954.\n\nIn 1924, when plans emerged to broaden the scope of the District of Columbia Professional Golfers’ Association and the Maryland State Professional Golfers’ Association, Charles Betschler played a prominent role in the formation of the MAPGA. At the time he served as the President of the Maryland group. He attended the inaugural meeting of Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia professionals at Columbia in March, 1925, which led to the formation of the Middle Atlantic PGA. In subsequent years, the membership elected him Vice President in 1927 and President in 1928. In 1929, they voted him Treasurer, the first person to hold that position. Then again in 1938, his fellow golfers again installed him as their Vice President.\n\nKnown as the “Little Dutchman,” Charlie was not particularly blessed with all of the physical attributes of other golfers, but well-known as one of the toughest match-play competitors of his time. Prior to winning the Maryland State Professional Golfers’ Championship in 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1927, he played in the 1921 US Open. When Charlie captured the fifth edition of the Maryland Open in 1925 at Rolling Road, he was the first professional to do so. His triumph followed a second place finish in 1924 at Baltimore CC – Roland Park course.\n\nThe MAPGA Section Championship came his way twice. First, in 1934 at the “original” Hillendale he defeated Johnny Bass, Al Treder, Carroll MacMaster and Al Houghton in match play to gather in the title. In the final match Charlie was 5 down to Al Houghton after 27 holes, but then rallied with birdies at 10, 12, 14, 15 and 16 to get even. Charlie then birdied 17 and halved 18 to win 1 up. In 1936 at Rolling Road, Tommy Ryan, Glenn Spencer, Leo Walper and Cliff Spencer lost to him as he carried the day. Additionally, he had been a semifinalist in 1931 at Woodmont and a finalist in 1932 at Maryland CC where he lost to Glenn Spencer.\n\nHis golfing credentials include a triumph in the inaugural MAPGA Senior Championship in 1949 at Woodholme which he followed up victories at Elkridge in 1950 and Bonnie View in 1952. In those days the MAPGA held a senior division within the Section Championship. In 1953, he and Ralph Beach shared the Bill Scott Trophy, accorded to the Senior Sectional Champion at the time, when they each shot 72 at Woodholme. Nationally, Charles Betschler tied for 13th in the 1947 PGA Seniors’ Championship in Dunedin, FL.\n\nOver the years Charlie scored seven holes-in-one. He also established a number of course records: Rolling Road (65), Maryland CC (65), “original” Hillendale (65), CC of Maryland (66), and the “original” Sherwood Forest (71).\n\nAt Charles Betschler’s 1954 retirement dinner, Jimmy Roche, professional at The Elkridge Club, said, “If there’s only one man on the golf course and that man is Charlie, you know there’s a gentleman on the course.” (rev. 2007)\n\nUnlike many golf professionals, Glenn’s interest in golf didn’t come at a very early age. He enjoyed sports as a teenager, but baseball was his preferred game. The only child of Allen and June Brown, Glenn was born and raised in Alexandria, VA. He was 16 when his father introduced him to the game of golf at East Potomac Park. His father’s enthusiasm was contagious, and Glenn soon became “hooked.” After a short stint in the Air Force, Glenn looked to golf as a career. In 1971, he declared his professional status and went to work as a shop assistant at Belle Haven Country Club in Alexandria, VA. Glenn earned his PGA membership in 1977, and in 1978 he left Belle Haven to accept a position as Assistant Professional at Westwood Country Club. In 1982, he was promoted to Head Professional of Westwood Country Club, where he remained until his retirement in 2018.\n\nGlenn was well-known throughout the Section for the countless hours of service he gave to the Section, serving as a member or chair of numerous Section committees throughout the years, including Special Awards, Tournament and Long-Range Planning. Most significantly, he served on and chaired the Employment/Club Relations Committee for almost 20 years and continually went above and beyond the call of duty in promoting the PGA professional to employers and the public. He was involved with many seminars in this arena and increased the number of business topics offered by the Section’s education program in order to enhance members’ professional status and value to their employers. Glenn was instrumental in the development of a Non-PGA Facilities Seminar which brought together representatives from facilities who were not currently employing PGA professionals with Section professionals in a relaxed setting to forge stronger relationships and inform them of the benefits of hiring PGA professionals.\n\nGlenn also initiated the revival of a section employment database. His section compensation survey and subsequent publicity campaign resulted in a 60% response rate. The statistics gleaned from these surveys was invaluable in assisting members with job searches, and eventually led to the PGA of America likewise instituting an annual survey. The MAPGA now annually leads the response rate among other Sections, with 80-85% return rate, all due to the habits formed when Glenn was Employment Chair.\n\nHe personally met with hundreds of club officials, owners, management companies and public officials to educate them about the PGA. Glenn helped develop and improve compensation packages by designing them to meet a specific golf operation. He received dozens of calls weekly from fellow golf professionals seeking his advice and guidance. In recognition for his dedication and commitment in this area, he was awarded the Section’s Bill Strausbaugh Award on three occasions, 1994, 1996 and 1998; and has been a national finalist three times, 1996, 1997 and 1999, and was selected as the National Bill Strausbaugh Award winner in 2000. Additionally, in 1992 Glenn was recognized for his superb merchandising skills and awarded the section’s Merchandiser of the Year (Private Category) award. Glenn’s distinguished record of service also includes serving on the Central Chapter Board of Directors from 1991 – 1994, Chapter Vice President 1994 – 1995, and Chapter President 1995 – 1996. He served on the section Board of Directors from 1993- 2003 as a chapter officer and then several terms as the Section’s Director-at-Large.\n\nGlenn was a great mentor, and his personal hiring philosophy was to hire good staff, help them establish direction, and then allow them the freedom to execute. This ideology helped seven of his former assistant professionals become head professionals and some win section-level awards. Three former assistants have won the MAPGA Assistant of the Year and the MAPGA Merchandiser of the Year awards, with one winning Professional of the Year (John Madden, PGA).\n\nGlenn lists Charles Muck and Ernie Garlem as his own mentors, the gentlemen who hired him at Belle Haven and Westwood. He notes that they provided him a wonderful opportunity to learn the golf business. He also closely observed Bill Strausbaugh’s ability to communicate with people at all levels and tried to emulate that. Lastly, he often utilized Bill Wallace, a longtime PGA member, as a sounding board and relied on for his advice and knowledge in the golf business for many years.\n\nGlenn had tremendous respect for the rich history and tradition of golf and its many rules and boundaries. He believed it was every PGA professional’s responsibility to promote not only the game of golf, but also the most important principle of the game — integrity.\n\nGlenn always relied on a few tenets for his success. He felt you should know your strengths and weaknesses, be honest, work hard, and remain dedicated. Always hire the very best people available, with a commitment to helping create a working relationship where they understand and learn the golf business and move forward in the industry. And lastly, to treat your employment not as a job, but as a career.\n\nGlenn currently resides in Vienna, VA and still enjoys playing golf, traveling, and seeing his adult children, Kate (Moore) and Allen and grandson Jasper.\n\n1921-2010. Ward Burgess entered the MAPGA Hall of Fame as a consummate professional who spent nearly a quarter century serving the MAPGA. He held many positions in the Association. First, he chaired the Publicity Committee which oversaw contributions to the PGA News for three years. Then he steered the Tournament Committee in two different tours of duty. For five years he held the Secretary – Treasurer’s job. He also served as the Maryland Vice President. And he led the Senior Association as Chair or Co-Chair for 15 years. As the leader of the senior professionals, he initiated the practice of having the assistants “work” the senior events so that they could get to know the “old guard,” as well as the game. For his meritorious work the MAPGA named him their Professional of the Year in 1961.\n\nDuring World War II, Ward served in the U.S. Navy aboard a sub chaser as a radio operator in the Mediterranean. His ship participated in the invasions at Anzio, Italy, and then Southern France. The Navy transferred him to the Pacific Theater where he served on the destroyer escort USS Hanna with duty in and around Tokyo, Yokahama, and Yokasuki. He was honorably discharged in 1945.\n\nWard turned professional in 1947 and the MAPGA elected him to membership in 1948. He worked for Johnny Bass at Clifton Park Golf Course in Baltimore for almost two years before moving to Chevy Chase Club as an assistant for Bob Barnett.\n\nChevy Chase club members quickly recognized the potential of the young assistant. When Bob Barnett died a few months later, they named Ward Burgess and Bill Hardy the co-head PGA Professionals. After five years, Ward became the sole head PGA Professional until his retirement in 1987.\n\nAs a player Ward Burgess first appeared on a leader board at the Assistant Professional Championship in 1948 held at Manor. He finished third behind Bobby Bowers and Severn White. He won or tied for first in pro-ams at Woodholme twice, once in 1949 and then by shooting 67 in 1954. In 1952 he won at Fort Dupont, the next year at Glenbrook and then in 1954 at Court House. In 1954 Ward and two others tied for low of the tournament, 67, in the Maryland Open at Manor. In the Pro-President Series, he and J.P. Marshall won the Pro-Official title in 1961 with a 63 at Indian Spring. He and Billy Bassler tied for first at Beaver Creek’s pro-am in 1969. He won the MAPGA Pro-Assistant Championship with Bob Murphy in 1971 when they combined for 63 at Northwest Park. The year before he and Bill Sporre had finished second at Turf Valley. Also in 1971, Ward, Dennis O’Leary, Claude King and Billy Phillips tied for first at the Country Club of Fairfax pro-am. Ward was victorious in the inaugural MAPGA Quarter Century Championship in 1974. In other senior competitions Ward won his age group in 1977 and 1979.\n\nThe MAPGA recognized Ward Burgess for his contributions to the Association’s administration, but also for innovative merchandising and teaching, and for his contributions to the success of pro-amateur tournaments over many years. (rev. 2010)\n\n1923-2008. Bill Clarke rose to prominence as one of the most important figures in the MAPGA and National PGA during the second half of the Twentieth Century. The PGA named him a “Legend” in 1997, the third person so honored.\n\nHis interest in golf started as a boy, frequently playing at Forest Park where Jimmy Flattery was the professional. Bill also had an early interest in art, eventually graduating from the Maryland Institute of Art. After service in the Navy during World War II as an aerial gunner, Bill began a career in golf by accepting the Assistant Professional position to Leo Kernan at Princess Anne in 1946. After spending a year as the head professional at Richardson Golf Course (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.), in 1948 he learned through Jimmy Flattery that Walter Romans sought a new assistant for Baltimore CC. Bill took over the “teaching” responsibilities there. Hillendale Country Club named him their Head PGA Professional in 1954. He remained for 35 years, serving as the club’s Executive Director for 14 of those years.\n\nBill assumed the responsibility as the MAPGA Tournament Committee Chair for four years, 1955 – 1958. He made a quick leap to the Presidency for 1959 – 1962. The MAPGA named him Professional of the Year in 1960 and the MAPGA Merchandiser of the Year (private category) in 1989 as well. For many years, some golf professionals in Virginia held VAGP membership, but not PGA membership. Bill Clarke, Leo Steinbrecher, Bill Strausbaugh and Carl Rasnic formulated the agreement which gained PGA membership of the VAGP members who had at least five years of professional experience. They entered the MAPGA as full members, and at the time created the Virginia Chapter of the MAPGA in 1966.\n\nBill Clarke’s rise through the National PGA ranks began as the Regional Vice President [1966 – 1968], Treasurer [1969 – 1970], then Secretary [1971 – 1972] and finally, President, [1973 – 1974]. He also served as Honorary President from 1975-1975. He provided the leadership for many important PGA committees over the years. What he considers his most important contribution was chairing the National Education Committee in 1966 – 1968 which pioneered the Home Study program for the PGA Business Schools. Additional assignments included the membership on the PGA Championship Committee from 1966 onward and chair of the Club Professional Championship Committee. Bill sat in the chairman’s position on the Rules Committee for five years, which is longer than anyone else, beginning in 1966.\n\nHe made his mark as one of the quintessential rules officials in the golf world. From 1968 through 1990 he regularly refereed at the Masters. He started as a rules official at PGA Championships in 1966 and “ruled” in a number of Tournament Player’s Championships and in the World Series of Golf. In 1967 he began as a Ryder Cup Official; through 2004 Bill only missed the 1985 Ryder Cup. In 1986, he and Clyde Manguum, the PGA Tour Representative, worked with Royal and Ancient Golf Club to rewrite the rules of golf.\n\nHis playing career included third place finishes in the Maryland Open twice, a second in the Howard County Open, and twice a second place in the MAPGA Assistant Professional Championship. That trophy is named in Honor of Bill Clarke. Bill’s credentials include a 67 in 1950 at Fountain Head, a 68 at Green Spring Valley in 1951, and a victory in the Mt. Pleasant Pro-Am preceding the Eastern Open. Bill was the NEWS AMERICAN Maryland Player of the Year for 1960 and 1961 based on a year-long points system.\n\nBill Clarke is a member of The PGA Golf Professional Hall of Fame Inaugural Class of 2005 and is also a member of the Middle Atlantic Golf Association Hall of Fame. The PGA awarded him the National Horton Smith Trophy in 1968 which “bestows special recognition on a PGA member for outstanding service and contributions toward developing and improving educational opportunities for PGA Professionals and Apprentices.” (Rev. 2009)\n\n1897–1969. Wilfred “Wiffy” Cox entered the MAPGA Hall of Fame for his contributions to the Section, including a term as President, and for his role as an important figure in the organization that evolved into the PGA Tour. He was a fine teacher with an engaging personality and unique sense of humor.\n\nWiffy was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1897, and came to the Middle Atlantic Section in 1935 as the Head PGA Professional at Kenwood CC. From there he moved on to Congressional where he served as the head PGA Professional from 1938 until his death in 1969. During World War II, when the OSS occupied Congressional Country Club, Wiffy held the head PGA Professional position at Hempstead Country Club on Long Island, New York. For a time during World War II, he served with the U.S. Navy as a fireman aboard the USS Nevada. Returning to Congressional in 1947, he rejoined his assistants Jocko Miller, Warner Gray, and Lew Worsham, who all toiled to re-open the course.\n\nThe PGA Tour credits him with nine championship victories. The first occurred in the Pinehurst Pro-Pro Medal Play with Willie MacFarlane in 1930. Wiffy led the 1931 money list with $11,000 and held the number one ranking amongst the touring professionals. That year, he won four consecutive titles: the Florida Open, the International Four-Ball with MacFarlane, the North-South Open in a playoff over Joe Turnesa, and the San Francisco Match Play. He also played in the Ryder Cup Matches at Scioto CC in Columbus, Ohio, compiling a 2-0-0 record. In 1932, Wiffy won the Pinehurst Pro-Pro for a second time with MacFarlane. In 1934, he won at the Agua Caliente Open and the Texas Open. Two years later, Wiffy won the Sacramento Open by defeating Bill Melhorn in a playoff. His career best scores include a 64 at Oakmont, California, in 1931; 64 at Westchester Biltmore in 1931, 65 at Tampa in 1933, and 66 at San Antonio in 1930.\n\nNationally, Wiffy played in six PGA Championships, four Masters, and eleven US Opens. He played in four consecutive Masters, 1935-1938, finishing 12th in 1937 and in a tie for 13th in 1936. His eleven US Open starts took place between 1924 at Oakland Hills and 1939 at Philadelphia CC. He only missed the cut three times. His best finish, a tie for third in 1934 at Merion, found him two shots behind Olin Dutra and one behind Gene Sarazen and tied with Bobby Cruickshank. Other notable US Open finishes included a fourth place tie at Inverness in 1931, fifth in 1932 at Fresh Meadow, and a fifth place tie at Baltusrol in 1936.\n\nLocally, Wiffy won the District of Columbia Open at the original Indian Spring course in 1937, earned the medal at the PGA Qualifier at Baltimore CC-Five Farms in 1938, took the District of Columbia Open again at Washington Golf in 1938, made the US Open field in the Sectional at Congressional in 1939, finished second in the MAPGA Section Championship at Columbia 1939, and lost a playoff to Andy Gibson for last spot in the US Open Sectional at Manor in 1940. In 1942, he won the Washington Open at Indian Spring and the Maryland Open at the original Prince George’s CC in Landover, MD.\n\nHe served as the MAPGA President from 1941 through 1943. The membership selected him as the MAPGA Professional of the Year in 1963. In February 1969, Wiffy played his last nine holes, shooting even par, three weeks before succumbing to cancer. (rev. 2011)\n\n1917 – 1998. Frank Cronin earned the Middle Atlantic Hall of Fame honors for his untiring work in promoting the game and educating a generation of students in Physical Education at the University of Maryland. He coached the University’s Golf and Boxing teams for many years. Frank Cronin is a member of three other Halls of Fame: University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame; the Golf Coaches Association of America Hall of Fame; and the Maryland Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nWithin the MAPGA ranks, he served as Treasurer in 1964 – 1967, as Vice President-at-Large in 1968, as Regional Vice President in 1969 and as the Northern Chapter President in 1969. He received the MAPGA’s Professional of the Year honor in 1971 and the Section’s Horton Smith Trophy three times: 1966, 1967, and 1975.\n\nFrank served as a member of the PGA’s Education Committee for three years. He coordinated three PGA Business Schools including the first one ever held outside the state of Florida, conducted in 1966 on the University of Maryland campus.\n\nOriginally from Colorado, his family moved to Bel Air Maryland in the 1930s. At Bel Air High School, his athletic prowess led to a University of Maryland track scholarship where be became one of the University’s all-time great athletes in track and boxing. As a boxer he won the Southern Conference Middleweight title in an undefeated season, 1938 – 1939, the only year he boxed. He defeated a United States Golden Glove Champion along the way. Frank was the Southern Conference indoor and outdoor quarter-mile champion five times; and the 1938 Southern Conference pole-vaulting championship. He graduated in 1939 and also received an Army ROTC commission.\n\nDuring WWII, he served as an instructor at the Fort Benning Infantry School before deploying to the Pacific Theater in 1945 where he served with the Occupation Forces in Japan until returning state side in 1946. Frank remained active in the reserves until the early 1960s when he retired as a Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nUpon returning to the University in 1946 he assumed responsibility for the golf team and a faculty position in the Physical Education Department. Overall, his golf team’s amassed 195 wins against 75 losses and 5 ties. He stepped down as golf coach in 1971, but remained the PGA Director of Golf Operations at the University of Maryland Golf Course until his retirement in 1980. His 1961-1965 golf teams won fifty consecutive home matches (an NCAA record) and his 1964 team tied for first place in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Some of the players he helped develop include Deane Beman, former PGA Tour Commissioner; Bill Calfee, Nationwide Tour President; and countless MAPGA Professionals. Five of his player’s garnered All-America honors: Deane Beman, Vern Novak, Bill Calfee, Rick Bendall and Mike Pratt. He also coached the boxing team from 1950-1954.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Coach Cronin launched a successful campaign to construct a university golf course. Using donations and money received from the football team’s appearances in the 1953 Sugar Bowl and 1954 and 1956 Orange Bowls, they built and then opened the course in 1958. Although officially credited to George W. Cobb, Frank was heavily involved in the design of the course.\n\nIn his career at College Park, he instructed more than 10,000 students in golf and physical education classes, coached successful golf and boxing teams, created the Women’s Golf Association, and directed the UM junior golf program for 10 years. Furthermore, Frank worked with the Lifetime for Sports Foundation and the National Golf Foundation.\n\nAnd, even though he came to golf late in his athletic career, Frank Cronin could play. In 1964, he set the course record at the University of Maryland Golf Course, then a par 72, with an eight under par score of 64. He also torched Prince Georges CC with a 67 that included nine 3s on his card. (rev. 2007)\n\n1894 – 1975. Robert Cruickshank entered the MAPGA Hall of Fame for his outstanding play at the regional and national level and for his contributions to the formation and leadership of the Virginia Association of Golf Professionals.\n\nBorn in 1894 in Scotland, he emerged as a golfing rival of Tommy Armour, but in school also starred in track and boxing. Bobby matriculated at Edinburgh College in 1914, but soon thereafter joined the Army with the outbreak of World War I. While a prisoner of war in Germany, he saved Sandy (Tommy’s brother) Armour’s life. Ironically, Bobby won the Edinburgh Trophy in 1919 by defeating Sandy Armour and repeated that victory in 1920.\n\nHe migrated to the United States in 1921 and turned professional holding assistant professional positions at Shackamaxon Country Club, Twin Hills, and Purchase Country Club. From 1932 to 1947, Bobby served as the Head PGA Professional for the Country Club of Virginia. He left there moving to Chartiers Country Club in 1948 where he remained until his retirement in 1968. “The Wee Scot’s” PGA credentials count 17 official tour victories. In 1927 Bobby won the Los Angeles Open, the Texas Open, the Hot Springs Open in Arkansas, the International Four-Ball in Miami with Tommy Armour and the North and South Open. He also led the PGA Tour in money earnings that year.\n\nOn the national scene he played in twenty-three US Opens, six Masters, and thirteen PGA Championships. Highlights of his US Open career include a playoff loss to Bobby Jones in 1923, a second place finish to Gene Sarazen in 1932, and a third place behind Ralph Guldahl and Sam Snead in 1937. Bobby’s last appearance, in 1957, occurred after he turned sixty-three years old. A fourth place finish in the 1936 Masters highlighted his career at Augusta. In thirteen PGA Championships beginning 1921 and concluding in 1951, he earned his way into the match play portion eleven times, advancing to the semifinals twice, but losing to Gene Sarazen in both instances.\n\nRegionally, Bobby won six Virginia State Opens: 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1939. He won the Virginia State Open in 1934 at Old Dominion in Newport News by ten, by seven in 1935 at Old Dominion again, and over Errie Ball in a playoff at Farmington CC in 1937. Before arriving at the Country Club of Virginia in 1932, he won the Maryland Open in 1928 at Baltimore CC-Five Farms by two over Tommy Armour. And in 1934, Bobby and Tommy Armour succeeded in the Pinehurst Fall Pro-Pro.\n\nAdditionally, as an MAPGA player between 1932 and 1947, Bobby laid out an impressive set of accomplishments. He captured the 1933 PGA Qualifier; qualified for the1934 US Open in a playoff over Al Houghton; won the 1934 National Capital Open at Kenwood, a PGA Tour event; and played on both the 1935 MAPGA team and the Virginia team against the touring Japanese All Stars at Kenwood and at the Cascades. His 1945 MAPGA Section Championship, which also served as the PGA Championship qualifier, found him ahead of Andy Gibson (by 4) and Ralph Beach (by 5).\n\nAfter leaving the Country Club of Virginia, Bobby won the Tri-State PGA Championship in 1949 and 1950, and played in several more US Opens, the last in 1957. The Tri-State PGA Section has elected him to their Hall of Fame as well. Towards the end of his career, Bobby played in seven PGA Senior Championships, finishing tied for 36th in 1964 and 1968.\n\nOn the personal side, “the Wee Scot” was well-known as a fisherman and expert flycaster. The National PGA Hall of Fame inducted Robert Allan Cruickshank in 1967. (rev. 2011)\n\n1925-1978. Bill Deck entered the MAPGA Hall of Fame for his contributions to the Association, for excellence in teaching, and for stellar play. He considered his most important contribution the initial handicap recording system used throughout the Middle Atlantic area which eventually spread nation-wide. The program still generates revenue for the MSGA, VSGA, and MAPGA more than thirty years later. As an officer in the MAPGA, Bill served as the Secretary (1972-1974), Treasurer (1973-1977) and a member of the Executive Committee. The MAPGA named him the 1975 Professional of the Year. During the mid 1970s, Bill Deck’s architecture of the Section’s ATP (Associated Tournament Players) series upgraded the tournaments and enhanced the payouts for the Monday and Friday pro-amateur tournaments.\n\nA native of Washington, D.C., Bill took up golf around age 13, but didn’t become serious about it until the early 1950s during his late 20s. Athletically, he stood out as a basketball player for Eastern High School. Bill completed a year at George Washington University, but the lure of becoming a pilot brought enlistment as a Naval Air Cadet as World War ended. Unfortunately, he sustained a broken neck while wrestling in a match during basic training just after turning 21.\n\nFor the next eleven years he worked as a meteorologist for the U.S. Weather Bureau. During this time he took a serious interest in golf. To sharpen his game, he frequented the well-known and historic gambling matches at East Potomac Park Golf Course, a public course that attracted talented golfers and hustlers.\n\nIn 1957, Bill accepted a job as an assistant to Walter Potter at the National Naval Medical Center course. In 1959, local Maryland businessman Doug Smiley formed a corporation which bought the Maenner Farm in Bowie, Maryland. They developed it into Belair CC and Bill served as the head PGA Professional at from the day it opened in 1959 until 1977. Then he moved to Hillsborough Country Club in Neshanic Station, New Jersey.\n\nAs a player, he went out on the Winter Tour twice and onto the Caribbean once during the early 1960s. Bill played in six PGA Tour events during that time and in 1965 qualified for The PGA Championship. In 1963, he won the Panama Open on the Caribbean Tour. Bill was the runner-up to Dick Mullen in the 1961 MAPGA Match Play, the Baltimore City Open. He once shot 62 at Bowie.\n\nThe 1964 MAPGA Section Championship victory highlighted his career, winning at Manor with a 71-69, even-par score. On the second day, Bill bested the leading players of his day, including Jimmy Clark from Argyle; Dick Sleichter, the defending champ; former champ Clare Emery; and Paul Haviland, a former MAPGA and Maryland Open Champion. During the second round he birdied the ninth after getting home in two, birdied the 10th, nearly holed out for eagle on the 12th, and birdied the 14th to sew up the tournament.\n\nThroughout the mid 1960s, he, Tony Marlowe, Ward Burgess, George Pigott, Bill Clarke, and Henry Girardi called themselves the “The Big Six.” They held a standing challenge in every tournament with the three highest scorers treating the lowest scorers to a “fancy” dinner afterwards. In 1968, he won three pro-amateur tournaments. He and Larry Wise tied at Maryland Golf, but won outright at Bonnie View and at Indian Spring. He won the 1972 pro-member at Fredericksburg CC. Bill Deck is one of those rare PGA professionals who served the MAPGA as both a magnificent player and organizational leader. (rev. 2004)\n\nWayne DeFrancesco’s exemplary golf career as a player and teacher earned his place in the Middle Atlantic PGA’s Hall of Fame. Over the organization’s history only he garnered both Player of the Year status and a Teacher of the Year recognition. Additionally, Wayne won the Section Championship three times and also received the Horton Smith Award for contributions to education. No other player in the Section’s history displays such an array of credentials.\n\nWayne was introduced to golf by his father, Henry, and his mother, Bobbie, who joined Lakewood Country Club in Rockville as charter members in 1959. Henry was an engineer and mathematician by trade, and thus he found the mechanics of the golf swing quite interesting and challenging. Wayne remembers having Ben Hogan’s “Five Lessons” and Cary Middelcoff’s “Master Guide to Golf” on the shelf from the time he could read. Henry had Wayne in the back yard hitting whiffle balls by age 8 and by age 10 they were out at Lakewood playing. Wayne played in his first event at age 12 and finished 2nd, and getting that trophy hooked him for life.\n\nHis successful playing career spans five decades, first serving notice winning the Washington Metropolitan Golf Association’s Bobby Gorin title in the thirteen-year-old and under division in 1971 and followed up with a win in the 14–15 year-old division two years later. Playing out of Langley HS, he captured the Frank Emmet School Boy Championship in 1975 and was named “Junior of the Year.” For success in a premier amateur career, the trophy case includes the Washington Metropolitan Amateur titles in 1978 and 1981, First Team All-America and Southeastern Conference Champion at Louisiana State (LSU) in 1979, as well as appearances in the 1975, 1978 and 1979 US Amateurs, where twice he went to the round of 32.\n\nWithin the Middle Atlantic PGA, Wayne DeFrancesco was a frequent visitor to the winner’s circle. He triumphed in the Section Championship on three occasions: 2000, 2001 and 2007; the Tournament of Champions twice: 1995 and 1998; the Assistant Professional Championship twice: 1999 and 2001. He won the Match Play Championship three times: 1996, 2004 and 2006; and the Senior Championship twice: 2007 and 2008. The MAPGA Player of the Year title came his way four times: 1994, 1995, 1997 and 2001. Over the years, additional victories include the Team Championship with Rick Schuller in 2006 and 2007, the 2009 and 2010 Facility Championship with Jay Lindell, the Senior-Junior Championship with Pat Coyner in 2014, and the Challenge Cup Tom Strange MVP Award in 1998.\n\nRegionally, Wayne captured the Maryland Open three times: 1994, 1995 and 2005; and the Maryland Senior Open in 2007.\n\nNationally, Wayne played in his first PGA Professional National Championship in 1995, finishing 5th and qualifying for his first PGA Championship at Riviera, where he made the cut and was the Low Club Professional. Wayne then qualified for his 2nd PGA in 1999, playing at Medinah CC. In his next PNC Wayne went to Bend, Oregon and led the event wire to wire (the only person to do so, leading alone every round) winning by 3 shots, a victory he considers the greatest of his career. In all, Wayne played in 5 PGA Championships, a U.S. Open (as an amateur in 1981 where he was Sectional medalist at the Army Navy Club, making the U.S. Open field at Merion), two Senior PGA Championships, a Senior US Open, and qualified for eleven PGA Tour Kemper Opens. In addition, Wayne won 4 USGA medals as medalist in local U.S. Open qualifying.\n\n“As soon as an instructor stops teaching beginners he or she ceases to be qualified for any honors…” so sayeth Wayne DeFrancesco. However, the accolades include the MAPGA’s Horton Smith Award for Education in 1998, and the Teacher of the Year (1994) recognition. He is both student and teacher of the game, participating in the PGA National Cracker-barrel, and Teaching and Coaching Summits, and becoming more than well-versed in the instructional literature. Accolades include Golf Digest’s 50 Greatest Teachers, and Golf Magazine’s Top 100 Teachers. His contributions to the literature include a four page spread in Golf Digest entitled “Drive 45 for Power,” Sports Illustrated articles and a three page piece on iron play in the 2008 PGA Guide to Instruction. Furthermore, he authored a long list of articles for GolfStyles Magazine over thirteen years.\n\nObjectively, his teaching attempts to “try to organize the information and teach you how to use your mental abilities in order to take what you learn out on the course and use it.” Wayne’s instruction is grounded in learning theory, technology and social media which emphasizes ongoing development for players at all levels of their potential. Given the difficulty of the sport he states that “best thing you can do is arrange for first rate instruction, but with the proviso there are no quick fixes. He has been particularly successful in guiding young teenagers through the ranks of junior, high school, collegiate and in some cases professional careers. At one time or other his younger students subsequently won a Virginia State Amateur, another qualified for two US Juniors and two US Amateurs, and one other won the Maryland State High School title and the State Amateur, and a young girl made First Team All-Ivy League. Amongst his professional peers, Wayne coached quite a number, most notably guiding Kevin Streelman to a victory in the PGA Tour’s Travelers Championship, and others have taken the time to study how he teaches. Such an honor is accorded to very few colleagues.\n\nThe Wayne DeFrancesco Learning Center offers both in person and online instruction as well as presentations and seminars. The attendant library includes “Lessons of the Week Videos” and online lessons and golf swing analysis, replete with copious articles on every aspect of the game. Wayne’s visibility on the internet has helped garner him lessons with such players as Brad Faxon, Tom Kite, Nick Price, Aaron Baddeley, Kevin Streelman, Len Mattiace, Gary Hallberg, Dick Mast, Andrew Loupe and Willy Wilcox.\n\nBob was born August 27, 1961 and grew up in Long Island, New York as part of a large family. His parents, Bob and MaryAnn Dolan, were very supportive of their children, offering encouragement at every opportunity. His father taught him to play golf when he was ten years old while living in Rhode Island. As a young man, Bob participated in several team sports, but he was particularly drawn to golf because he realized that his success was dependent solely upon himself.\n\nBob got his first golf-related job when he was 16 years old working at Fernway Driving Range under the tutelage of PGA Professional Luther Showaker. Bob turned professional and entered the PGA apprentice program in 1983 and was elected to membership in 1987. He worked at Leisure World Golf Club, Montgomery Village Golf Club and Chevy Chase Club as an assistant professional. Bob served as the Head Professional at South Seas Plantation on Captiva Island, Fla., Hidden Valley Resort in Somerset, Pa. (1987-1992) and Lakewood Country Club in Rockville, Md. (1992-1994). He then succeeded the legendary “Coach” Bill Strausbaugh at Columbia Country Club in 1995 and will move to Professional Emeritus at the end of 2022 after a 27-years as Head PGA Professional.\n\nBob received numerous awards at both the Section and National level. Middle Atlantic Section accomplishments include the 1996 President’s Award, 1997 PGA Professional of the Year, 1998 Junior Golf Leader, 1999 and 2010 Bill Strausbaugh Award, 2004 Professional Development Award and 2011 Merchandiser of the Year (Private). He was recognized by the National PGA with the 2000 Youth Player Development Award and the 2011 Bill Strausbaugh Award. He is one of the very few PGA professionals to win two or more National Awards (believed to be only 68 in PGA history).\n\nBob is the consummate PGA Professional. He not only understands – but embraces – all aspects of what it means to be a PGA Member. He personally works to “wear all the hats” of a PGA member. At his core, he is about service: service to his members, to his fellow professionals, to his students, to the community and above all to the game of golf. He works every day to both grow the game and further everyone’s love for the game. He is deeply committed to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in the game and growing and developing the golf industry’s workforce. He respects the history and traditions of the game and believes that golf is a vehicle through which he and others can bring people together and teach valuable life lessons. He is and always has been a wonderful ambassador for the game and an outstanding representative of the Middle Atlantic Section. Bob simply loves the game of golf and those that play it!\n\nBob has held all of the offices in Middle Atlantic Section, including his service as Section President in 2002-2003. He has served on the Employment, Government Relations and Special Awards Committees of the PGA of America and is a regular attendee at PGA Annual Meetings. He also chaired the Presidential Advisory Board for TaylorMade Golf from 2004-2011.\n\nTwo of his primary career passions are junior golf and career development among PGA members.\n\nBob has led many initiatives in junior golf. For example, he was instrumental in creating the MAPGA Junior Tour in 1998. Today, the Tour has over 60 events and with approximately 750 annual participants. Bob is also incredibly active in junior golf throughout the area. His work with The First Tee of Greater Washington DC included not only serving on the Executive Committee as chair of the Program Committee but also actively teaching golf and life skills. In addition, he works closely with other organizations such as The Neediest Kids Charity and Golf in Schools. It is certainly appropriate that the PGA of America awarded Bob the National Junior Golf Leader Award in 2000 (it has since been renamed the Youth Player Development Award).\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his predecessor and mentor, PGA of America Hall of Famer Bill “Coach” Strausbaugh, Bob has spent the past 27 years being the go-to person for professionals throughout the Middle Atlantic on issues of employment, professional growth, and career development. Bob recognizes Luther Showaker, Jack Doser, Jerry Heard, Bill Strausbaugh, Jim Fitzgerald, Jim Folks, Dennis Satyshur, Bob Ford, and Ward Burgess as his PGA mentors and tries to “pay it forward” to young professionals in our industry. In addition to the countless hours, he has spent coaching and mentoring fellow professionals, Bob also found time to create and launch the MAPGA Employment Summit to benefits professionals throughout our Section. The original Summit was such a success that the Section has institutionalized it as an annual event hosted in recognition of Bob at his home club. In fact, PGAHQ plans to duplicate the idea at the national level, and plans to host the first event at Columbia CC. It is no wonder that the PGA of America awarded Bob the National Bill Strausbaugh, Jr. Award in 2011.\n\nBob’s leadership role also extends to the community. Whether it be Board service or simply leading specific initiatives, organizations such as The First Tee and Folds of Honor rely on Bob in so many ways. His work ethic, professional demeanor, style, and approach inspires people to support the causes he champions. This work has resulted in not only significant financial support to these organizations but increased awareness, education and understanding of their important work.\n\nThe First Tee-DC hosted a “Bob Dolan Roast and Toast,” hosted by Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon, to raise over $100,000 for First Tee programs. In 2020, Bob and his team developed a program believed to be “first of its kind” which allowed for First Tee of DC kids to earn honorary guest privileges at Columbia CC. Bob has hosted a bi-annual Folds of Honor event in 2017 and 2019, with amateurs playing with members of Congress and PGA professionals, and raised over $350,000 for FOH, easily a top fund-raiser for that charity. Lastly, he was asked and proudly serves on the PGA Leadership group with PGA Magazine.\n\nBob’s commitment to his profession is surpassed only by his commitment to his family. He and his wife, Dawn, have been married since 1985 and have two adult children, Bobby and Shannon.\n\n1909–1999. Clarence Doser earned MAPGA Hall of Fame honors for his high caliber of play over four decades in regional and national circles. He was the MAPGA Player of the Year in 1958 nearing his 50th birthday.\n\nAt age 45, Clarence Doser moved to the Middle Atlantic Section in 1954 as the Head PGA Professional for Woodmont Country Club. Already a distinguished professional, he concluded his career with seven more years at Woodmont Country Club and then 15 years at Washingtonian Golf and Country Club before retiring to Florida in 1976.\n\nClarence Doser’s successful career got underway in 1929 when he reached the PGA Championship Match Play field, but lost a first round match. His early triumphs included the 1929 and 1935 Western New York PGA Section titles. Add to this the 1932, 1933 and 1934 Western New York Open, the Rochester Open in 1933 and 1935, the Buffalo Open in 1934 and 1935, and the Central New York Open in 1936. He played in many PGA Tour events throughout the remainder of the 1930s and into the 1940s. Before arriving in Maryland, Clarence won Metro New York Connecticut title in 1945, 1948 and 1953, and the Greenbrier pro-am in 1953. After arriving in Maryland he regularly played in the PGA Tour’s Eastern Opens. In that event, he finished 9th in 1958.\n\nIn the MAPGA, he won the Section Championship in 1955 and 1958 and the Match Play Championship in 1956. Clarence captured the Senior Championship six times: 1962, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1971. In 1958 he triumphed in the MAPGA Senior Teacher’s Trophy Championship at Woodholme and repeated the next year at Columbia. He triumphed in the Salisbury Open at Green Hill and the Howard County Open at All View in 1962, and the 1963 Maryland Open in a playoff over Dick Whetzle and Cosimo Tiso at Suburban. In 1975, Clarence won the MAPGA Quarter Century Championship.\n\nIn 1959, up against national figures, he and Lew Worsham defeated Sam Snead and Dick Iames in an exhibition at Court House CC. His 68 that day, low round of four players, put him two shots ahead of Sam Snead and three over Lew Worsham.\n\nOn the national stage, Clarence Doser played in 21 PGA Championships. His best showing occurred in 1945 when reached the semifinals. He lost to Sam Byrd who in turn lost to Byron Nelson in the finals. Several years later, in 1952, he reached the quarterfinals, only to lose to Jim Turnesa, the eventual PGA Champion. In his final PGA Championship appearance at age 52 in 1961, Clarence finished tied for 37th in the stroke play competition at Olympia Fields CC.\n\nIn 20 PGA Senior Championships, he made the cut 15 times. His highest finish, 3rd, occurred in 1961. Clarence’s accomplishments in those championships are attested by two top 5s, five top 10s and 11 top 25s. He played and made the cut for the last time in 1981 at 72 years of age. In 1973, at age 64, he finished 86th in the PGA Club Professional Championship in one of his three appearances in that series.\n\nIn US Open competitions, Clarence earned trips to the championship 19 times between 1930 and 1963, making the cut six times. A tie for 13th in 1952 highlighted his US Open career.\n\nIn two Master’s appearances, Clarence finished tied for 34th in 1953 (Ben Hogan won the Green Jacket) and for 38th in 1954 (when Sam Snead beat Hogan in a playoff for the Green Jacket). He shot his best round at Augusta in 1953, a 71, and in 1954 a 72.\n\nBeginning at the age 64 Clarence Doser shot his age more than 1644 times. At 79, he shot a 74 to finish in the runner-up spot in the South Florida Seniors in West Palm Beach, beaten only by a 50-year old. (rev. 2007)\n\nKenwood Country Club, Bethesda, Maryland\n\nHall of Fame Class of 2013\n\n1901-1977. During a fifty-seven year golf career, George Diffenbaugh rose from the caddie ranks at Baltimore CC to the Presidency of the MAPGA. He started as a caddie at Baltimore CC in 1917 under Aleck “Nipper” Campbell, a founding member of the PGA of America. George Diffenbaugh assumed the Presidency of the Middle Atlantic PGA in 1937. Towards the end of his career the Section awarded him the “Professional of the Year” distinction in 1957. As a pioneer, he attended the formative meeting on the Middle Atlantic PGA on March 2, 1925.\n\nIn 1925 George had relocated to Rock Creek Park Golf Course in the District of Columbia. Then served as an Assistant to J. Munro Hunter from 1928 – 1932 and then Head Professional at Indian Spring until 1938. He replaced Wiffy Cox at Kenwood later in the year where he remained for 38 years. As a teacher he played a prominent role in the development of a number of young amateur “stars,” including Roger Peacock, Bobby Brownell, Betty Palmer Meckley and June Nelson.\n\nThe first reference to George Diffenbaugh’s playing came in the 1922 Maryland State Professional Golfers’ Association (MSPGA) “Open.” During 1923 he won two MSPGA tournaments. He finished second to Toney Penna in 1928 MAPGA Assistant Professional Championship. As a player, high High Hfinishes in Maryland Opens marked his career. In 1931 he finished second to Gene Larkin at Congressional, then in 1932 and 1934 second to Al Houghton. In the 1935 MAPGA Championship he lost to Johnny Bass in the final match. Later in 1935, George secured a prominent win by taking the District of Columbia Open at Indian Spring and pocketing $75. Carroll MacMaster stated that the diminutive George Diffenbaugh got his great length from a perfect pivot.\n\nIn 1937 he qualified for the PGA Championship. George succeeded in the 36-hole qualifier at the Pittsburgh Field Club gaining entry to the match play portion, but lost in the first round. George qualified for the US Open in 1940 and the PGA Championship a second time in 1946.\n\nOver the years he successfully played against nationally known figures in exhibitions. In 1928, George and J. Munro Hunter halved the British team of Aubrey Boomer and Archie Compston. In 1931 they lost to Billy Burke and George Von Elm, the US Open Champion and runnerup by one. In the 1934 Mid South Professional Foursome matches at Pinehurst, he and Andy Merrilees defeated Bill Melhorn and Vic Ghezzi in a match. In 1934, he and Al Houghton along with Roland MacKenzie and Roger Peacock, played two exhibitions with Lawson Little, the 1934 and 1935 US and British Amateur Champion. During 1935, George and Al Houghton played two exhibitions against “tour” stars Jimmy Thomson and Henry Picard, halving the first, but losing the rematch 1 down.\n\nIn 1938 Merrell Whittlesey reported that George provided group lessons to competing teams in the District of Columbia schoolboy matches. Furthermore, he pushed his fellow professionals to give lessons free of charge to any schoolboy golfers and routinely attended the annual meetings of the scholastic body overseeing golf.\n\nOrganizationally, not only did George Diffenbaugh serve as President of the MAPGA, he did so during a difficult time for professional golf, the “Great Depression” of the 1930s. He, along with Al Houghton, successfully upgraded the purse and status of the Section Championship starting in 1937 held at the Chamberlin in Hampton. They changed the format to 72-hole stroke play and the number of players increased, particularly Virginians. In fact, for the first time professionals from Richmond, Hot Springs, Charlottesville and the Norfolk area entered.\n\nGeorge Diffenbaugh is one of those MAPGA personalities who made substantial contributions to the organization, but succeeding generations lost sight of his place in the organization’s history. So much so, that his recognition as “Professional of the Year” in 1957 did not appear in the MAPGA Annual until 2005 when his award came to light. The specific citation credited him with contributions to “Junior Golf.”\n\n1920-2008. Max Elbin entered the MAPGA Hall of Fame for his leadership of the Middle Atlantic PGA and for steering the National PGA through not only of the most difficult times, but also one of the most rapidly changing eras in professional golf, the late 1960s.\n\nMax Elbin and his brother started in golf by shagging balls and carrying “Sunday bags” at Cumberland CC in 1930. By thirteen Max was playing the game and in short order won the Cumberland CC Caddie Tournament in 1936. He also won the City Championship. At Allegany High School, where he was the Class President, Max played basketball, soccer, baseball and ran on the track team before graduating in 1938. His sports achievements brought him basketball and golf scholarship offers from the University of Baltimore.\n\nMax turned professional in 1940 as an assistant for Lew Worsham at Burning Tree Club. He worked for Worsham during the summer months and then with Bob Barnett at Indian Creek Country Club in Miami over the winters.\n\nAfter two years at Burning Tree he joined the Army Air Corps in 1942. The military initially assigned him to the U.S. Army Air Corps Headquarters Technical Training Command. From there he served with the Flying Training Command in Texas, and ultimately landed in the Pacific Far East Theater with a B-25 group where he saw the War upfront in New Guinea, the Philippines and eventually in Tokyo.\n\nAfter the War, he returned to Burning Tree, but by that time Worsham’s interest had turned to the PGA Tour. The story goes that in May 1946 Lew went off to play the Philadelphia Inquirer Open leaving Max in charge. Lew didn’t return. For nearly fifty years he tended to the club’s membership, became an integral of the MAPGA’s leadership cadre, and the advanced through the ranks of the National PGA ultimately becoming President.\n\nHis “organizational” career began as the Section’s Publicity Committee Chair in 1949, followed by chairmanship of the Tournament Committee (1952 and 1953), Regional Vice President in 1954, and ended with Presidential terms in 1956, 1957 and 1958. When the Section expanded their “Executive Committee” in 1963 from 8 to 11 members Max won one of the three new slots which he continued to hold for several years. At the time, his contribution to the Section involved the development of a standard “PGA Professional’s Employment” contract that was widely used for many years. The Section selected him as the MAPGA Professional of the Year in 1962.\n\nFrom the top position in the Section, Max started out on the path that led to the National PGA Presidency. He was elected to National PGA Treasurer in 1964, Secretary in 1965, and President in 1966 – 1968. Max steered the PGA during one of its difficult periods, the mid 1960s when the “touring pros” splintered toward their own organization. During that time he also oversaw the development of arrangements with the television industry by guiding the negotiations of the first TV contract. Furthermore, he was instrumental in early PGA educational efforts by hiring their first Educational Director.\n\nAs a Head PGA Professional he tutored many young professionals who went on to become prominent in their own right. By the time he retired in 1995, some 39 of his assistants had moved up in the ranks.\n\nThe PGA recognized Max Elbin as a “Legend” in 1995, becoming the first Past President so honored. In 1997, the Middle Atlantic Golf Association inducted him into their Hall of Fame. Max also received the Richardson Award in 1967, the highest honor bestowed by the Golf Writers’ Association of America. He also received the Washington Touchdown’s Club “Timmie” Award. He played with, or taught golf to, Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Bush.\n\nThe MAPGA Head Professional Championship trophy is named in honor of Max Elbin. (rev. 2009)\n\n1925-1980. Clare Emery earned MAPGA Hall of Fame honors for his outstanding playing record and for his contributions to the game. As a father figure to his employees, Clare assisted many of his assistants in becoming Head PGA Professionals. He was a superb teacher of the game who taught his students patience and the art of playing within their ability. In 1960 and 1967 he won the coveted MAPGA Player of the Year title. His peers awarded him the Tom Strange Memorial Trophy in 1977 as the MVP of the Yamaha Challenge Cup Matches.\n\nAdministratively, Clare served as a Vice President-at-Large for the Middle Atlantic Section for a number of years. Most importantly the Middle Atlantic PGA recognized him as their 1977 Professional of the Year, the Section’s highest honor for active PGA Professionals.\n\nHe served as the Head PGA Professional at Washington Golf & CC from 1954 until his death. Described as a wonderful gentleman, Clare meant many things to many people. An honorable man, known for his class and gracious demeanor, he could tell a great story and always found time to listen to the jokes and stories told by his members. The service Clare provided to his club members matched his outstanding playing ability. Regardless of how busy, he always made himself available to expand a member threesome into a fun foursome.\n\nBorn in Salt Lake City, Clare’s father was the superintendent at three municipal courses and introduced him to golf at age nine. He started working on the grounds crew at 16, then as a starter, and in 1948 turned professional. Clare moved to Woodmont CC as an assistant to George Fazio in 1950. After Fazio left Woodmont in 1950, Emery eventually moved to Congressional CC working for Wiffy Cox. Clare was elected to membership in The PGA in 1954, the same year that Washington G & CC selected him to succeed Earl Fling as their Head PGA Professional.\n\nClare won several Section Championships, including the 1961 MAPGA Section Championship, MAPGA Senior Championship five consecutive times (1975-1979), and the MAPGA Quarter Century Championship twice (1978,1979). In 1959, Clare won the MAPGA Pro-President with James Murphy. He won countless Pro-Am tournaments over the years. Regionally, he captured the1951 District of Columbia Open, 1960 Howard County Open, 1960 Eastern Shore Open.\n\nOn the national scene, Clare played in seven PGA Championships (1958,1959[T-28th], 1960, 1962, 1963, 1967 [T-64th], 1974[78th]); two US Opens (1957,1967), and five Senior PGA Championships (made all five cuts and tied for 3rd in 1977). One memorable experience for Clare took place during the first round of the 1967 PGA Championship at Columbine CC in Denver…he was walking up the ninth fairway, looked up to see the leader board, and there it was right at the top, Emery – 2 under! Years later in the final round of the 1977 Senior PGA Championship, Clare fired a 67 and passed half the field as the next best score was a 70 (George Bayer) and the eventual winner, Julius Boros, shot 72. The weather conditions included numbing cold, icy rain, tremendous winds, and fog!\n\nFurthermore, Clare competed in seven National PGA Club Professional Championships, making three cuts with his best finish at T-21st in 1973. He also qualified and competed in the first US Senior Open won by Roberto De Vicenzo at Winged Foot GC. He competed in four PGA Tour events, making all four cuts. Clare was simply an outstanding iron player and many believe he would have made it on the PGA Tour if his putter would have behaved a bit better.\n\nClare suffered a fatal heart attack as he was preparing for his afternoon tee time in the Charles Town Golf Classic in West Virginia. He had just finished lunch and was trading stories with some of the MAPGA professionals who had completed their earlier round. Washington G&CC honored Mr. Emery by renaming the Club Championship Cup (donated in 1916) the Emery Cup. (rev. 2009)\n\nWoody FitzHugh’s distinguished playing during the 1980s earned MAPGA Hall of Fame honors. Capturing the MAPGA Section Player of the Year titles four times: 1981, 1984, 1985 and 1987 included not only two Section Championships, but also three Virginia Opens.\n\nAdditionally, he spent three years on the PGA Tour, 1980 – 1982. Nationally in PGA Championships, he played in two PGA Championships (1980 and 1988), qualified for the Professional National Championship twelve times, and played in the Senior PGA Professional National Championship three times (2005, 2006 and 2007.\n\nGrowing up in McLean, Virginia, during the 1950s with his brothers Gill, Philip and Grayson, Woody attended Langley High School where he wrestled, and played on the baseball and basketball teams, starring in baseball. Following high school, Woody attended Hampden-Sydney College, playing on the baseball team. However, some unhappiness with his playing time led to expressing disappointment to Colonel Gustav Franke, his math professor, but also the college’s golf team coach. Col. Franke invited Woody to his make-shift driving range, a set up in one of the campus building’s basement. Hitting into a little net in this basement was where Woody had his first taste of golf. From that point, Woody decided to say good-bye to baseball and start a new life with golf.\n\nThe golf team practiced occasionally at Longwood College Golf Course in nearby Farmville where PGA Professional Mac Main, Sr. held forth as the head golf professional. Mac noticed Woody on the practice range, decided to give him instruction on his grip, and from there taught him how to play the game. Mac Main, himself already won two MAPGA Section Championships and a Virginia PGA Championship, had also played on the PGA Tour. Between the leadership of Col. Franke and the golf knowledge of Main, Woody started to develop one of the finest golf games in Virginia. While still in the amateur ranks, he finished second to his brother Gill in the Washington Metropolitan Amateur Championship in 1973. Little did he know at that time that his talents would take him to the highest levels of tournament play.\n\nWoody graduated in 1974 with a BA in Psychology and immediately decided on pursuing a golf career. His first golf job was an assistant golf professional position at Washington Golf and Country Club in Arlington, Virginia, to PGA Hall of Fame member, Clare Emery. After five years there, he struck out to play tournament golf for a living, earning a PGA Tour card. Woody spent three years on the PGA Tour where he played in 53 events, made eight cuts and had one top 25 finish. He only lost the 1980 Buick Open by four strokes to Peter Jacobsen after an opening round of 76. Also during this time, he established Woody’s Golf Range Inc.; a full service golf range that now includes batting cages, volleyball courts and a miniature golf course. Woody’s Range has been Woody’s passion for over 32 years.\n\nA PGA Member since 1978, Woody established a very impressive tournament record within the Middle Atlantic region. He is a three-time State Open of Virginia Champion (1984, 1986, and 1988). In one of the three State Opens, he defeated fellow Virginian and World Golf Hall of Famer Curtis Strange. Furthermore, Woody’s successful playing career also includes two-time MAPGA Section Professional Champion (1981 and 1985), an MAPGA Head Professional Champion (1988), an MAPGA Team Champion (1987), a four-time MAPGA Player of the Year winner (1981, 1984, 1985 and 1987), and a Middle Atlantic Open Championship (1984). In addition to these impressive finishes, Woody holds 15 course records, made 13 holes-in-one, and won more than 75 Pro-Am events. At one stage in his career, he played in eight consecutive events without making a bogey. In 2000, Hampden-Sydney awarded Woody with a Special Citation into their Athletic Hall of Fame. “If you can’t do it in a tournament, you haven’t practiced enough,” states Woody on his personal golf philosophy.\n\nOutside of golf, Woody has been very active in his community. In 1996, he established the Jeremiah House in Paeonian Springs, Virginia which was a home for battered and unwed mothers. The women who stayed at the Jeremiah House were provided medical care, so they could birth their children safely and then find occupations to get back on their feet. Over 50 babies were saved from abortion through Woody’s services at the Jeremiah House. An interesting side note about Woody is that he played Aide-de-camp to General Robert E. Lee in the movie Gods and Generals (General Lee’s character was played by Academy Award winner Robert Duvall).\n\nWoody’s personal life is based on his love for his family and his strong Christian faith. Joan FitzHugh has been at Woody’s side for over 38 years and they have three successful daughters, Tyler, Leta and Currie. Tyler FitzHugh is the owner/founder of Voila Event Studio and is an associate with Stoladi Property Management Corp. Leta FitzHugh works as a paralegal secretary and does theatrical scene painting in her spare time. Currie FitzHugh is the owner/founder of Currie FitzHugh Photography and also assists her dad in the management of Woody’s Golf Range. Woody’s life has been very blessed and he shares that his children “have proven to be the people in my life who have taught me the most about my life.”\n\nJohn Flattery’s prominent golf career moved him to the forefront of Middle Atlantic PGA leadership cadre for a longer period than any other officer in the organization’s history. Over a period of almost 20 years, he served the Section as either, the President, Regional Vice President, or Secretary-Treasurer.\n\nJohn was born to Michael William and Mary Anne (Reynolds) in Peabody, Massachusetts, a suburb of Salem. He was the oldest of seven children, five girls and two boys. Brother Jimmy would also become a prominent PGA Professional in the Baltimore area.\n\nJohn started as a caddie in 1911 (age 7) at Kernwood CC in Salem, Ma. When many golf professionals entered the military as World War I broke out, he became the caddie master, club maker and eventually assistant professional at Kernwood CC In 1917. Three years later John assumed the head professional position at the Franklin CC. Within a year he took over at Pine Brook Valley near Boston. John earned his PGA membership on May 1, 1922 a few months before his 18th birthday! Siwanoy CC in Mount Vernon, New York, came next where he remained as the Head PGA Professional for three years, 1928 -1930.\n\nFrom 1920 through 1929 John “wintered in Florida” as a teaching professional at Palm Beach Golf Club at the Breakers Hotel. After a long hiatus and at the behest of the owner, John returned to the Palm Beach Golf Club from 1950 through 1959. Every year he would depart Baltimore via train on Christmas day and return on March 19th. While in Palm Beach he enjoyed his interaction and involvement with numerous celebrities and prominent figures, among them, the Kennedy family, Prince Rainier of Monaco, and The Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\n\nIn the late 1920’s, a New York Railroad executive and amateur golfer, Ed “Gunboat” Smith, laid out the plans for a country club and resort in the Ellicott City area south of Baltimore. The course, Allview Golf Club, was first planted in 1928, the same year John would marry Catherine M. Fitzpatrick. These were exciting and changing times in the United States, beginning with the “Roaring Twenties” and followed by the Great Depression.\n\nJohn’s friends and associates included Gene Sarazen, Johnny Farrell, Babe Ruth, and other sports heroes. However, the 1929 stock market crash brought an end to the elaborate plan for a luxury resort but the golf course became a reality. In 1931 John, along with Catherine, came to Allview to be Head PGA Professional.\n\nHe remained at Allview through 1934 when he was selected as the first Head Professional at Rodgers Forge Golf Club (now known as the CC of Maryland) in Towson. In 1944, John moved to the Head PGA Professional position at Forest Park Golf Course (Baltimore) where he remained for two years before becoming the Head PGA Professional at Green Spring Valley Hunt Club in Garrison, Maryland. John hosted the MAPGA Match Play Championship (the Baltimore City Open) at Green Spring Valley from 1946 to 1965. John, known by all as a quiet and caring human being and the consummate PGA Professional, served the members of Green Spring Valley Hunt for 26 years before retiring in 1972.\n\nThe members of Green Spring Valley Hunt Club honored John at that time with the title of PGA Head Professional Emeritus while, at the same time, he became a PGA Life Member. Upon John’s 25th anniversary at the club, the members held a celebration in his honor. After presenting him with a silver tray, John in turn gifted it back to the club for use as the trophy for the Men’s Match Play “Season Long Championship.” It remains in use to this day.\n\nAt the MAPGA Annual Meeting in October 1939, the membership elected John as their Secretary – Treasurer. He held that position for just a year when in the fall of 1940, he took on the Baltimore Regional Vice President position which he held until May 1943. Also, in 1942 he carried out the Tournament Chair duties.\n\nJohn succeeded Wiffy Cox as MAPGA President in May 1943, serving through October 1946. When he stepped down as President, his colleagues trusted and relied on him so much that they elected him Secretary – Treasurer for a second time. He continued to serve in that capacity for another decade. Altogether, John Flattery served as a MAPGA officer continuously from 1939 through 1957.\n\nImpressively and true to his profession, it is noteworthy that during John’s outstanding career, he mentored and encouraged several other Middle Atlantic PGA Hall of Fame members – Bill Strausbaugh, Bill Clarke, Walter Romans, Andy Gibson, John O’Donnell and Dick Whetzle. John’s brother, Jimmy, also deceased, was the Head PGA Professional at Forest Park Golf Course in Baltimore. He orchestrated the prestigious Jimmy Flattery Junior Championship for many years at Forest Park, encouraging a substantial number of junior golfers who went on to become professionals.\n\nSadly, John’s wife, Catherine, passed away in 1959. They had three sons, John Jr., now deceased, William and Paul. John is currently survived by Bill, his wife Winnie; Paul, his wife Jane; 7 granddaughters, and 13 great grandchildren.\n\nThe MAPGA conferred Hall of Fame honors to James Folks for his career-long contributions to the organization’s development as a leading Section in The PGA of America. He either served or chaired the important committees and rose through the officer ranks, reaching the Presidency in 1986. Beginning in 1975, when elected a Regional Vice President, he steadfastly brought innovation and leadership to the MAPGA for over thirty-five years, and will continue to do so in retirement. In the past, the Section honored him with the Horton Smith Award (1981), the Bill Strausbaugh Award three times (1982, 1984 and 1985), Merchandiser of the Year (1986), Professional of the Year (1987), and the prestigious President’s Award (1994).\n\nOriginally from Georgia, a family relocation took him to Ocala, Florida, as a young boy. Playing with his father at Ocala Golf Club turned his interest from baseball to the links. Jim quickly picked up the nuances of the game under the tutelage of PGA Professional Lou Bateman. Within a short duration, he captured the Men’s Club Championship twice, the Ocala City Junior Championship three times, the Florida State Junior Jaycee title twice. And, winning the Henry N. Camp Invitational at age twenty highlighted his amateur career up until then.\n\nWhile attending Central Florida Junior College, the collegiate golf powers, the University of Florida, Florida State and Houston, pursued him with scholarship offers. However, Mississippi State University succeeded in the recruiting battle. He finished his bachelor’s degree there in 1964. Jim turned professional almost immediately, returning to Ocala Golf Course as an assistant to his original teacher and mentor, PGA Professional Lou Bateman.\n\nFollowing five years in the Florida Section, Jim came to Congressional Country Club in 1968 as the first assistant to Wiffy Cox, a MAPGA Hall of Fame member. However, later that year he sojourned back to Florida for the Winter Tour. But, by the spring of the next year, Jim returned to Maryland as Max Elbin’s assistant at Burning Tree. Three years later, Bethesda CC named him Harry Griesmer’s successor and he began what became thirty-nine years of service to the club and the MAPGA.\n\nFrom 1975 on, there is a considerable catalogue of contributions and leadership. To begin with, in 1975, 1976 and 1981, Jim served as a Regional Vice President. The Club Relations Committee Chairmanship took up his time between 1981 and 1983. That committee led the way in establishing area employment representatives throughout the Section’s expansive boundaries. Jim focused on compiling a compensation statistical database. He and Bill Strausbaugh, a MAPGA Hall of Fame member, collaborated on developing employment programs for the membership. In fact, subsequently as President, he hired MAPGA Past President and Hall of Famer Carl Rasnic as the Section’s first “Employment Director.”\n\nAs an officer of the Association, Jim started out on the path to the Presidency as the Treasurer in 1982 – 1983, Secretary during 1984 – 1985 and then the top spot in 1986 – 1987. While President, Jim led the effort to centralize the handicap program and negotiated the contracts with the Virginia State and Maryland State Golf Associations thereby establishing the continuity of the program. Additionally, he brought to fruition the MAPGA branch office in Richmond attempting to allay the effects of the geographical expanse with all its attendant difficulties.\n\nAnd i"
