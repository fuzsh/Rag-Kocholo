        "text": "Discover the people who helped shape the look of Palm Springs architecture.\n\nGeorge Alexander, Developer\n\nGeorge Alexander started out as an accountant and became involved in real estate, leading him to become a developer in Los Angeles. George began investing in Palm Springs in 1930 as one of the original developers of the Smoke Tree Guest Ranch, among others. The Alexanders were also active in Palm Springs society, civically engaged, and known for their philanthropic work.\n\nThe idea of building modern homes, and lots of them, came from his son, Robert (Bob), but George thought the idea could have been better. George’s vision for his construction company changed in 1956 when his health took a turn for the worse, and, under his doctor’s advice to seek a warmer, drier climate, he decided to relocate his George Alexander Company base of operations to Palm Springs. The Alexanders had already been enamored of the desert, where they spent many weekends each winter. The timing couldn’t have been better for the firm, as the popularity of the desert resort was ready to explode. It would be there where he and his son Bob and Bill Krisel would form the desert team that would go down in Palm Springs Modernism history.\n\nBob asked architect William Krisel to make sketches and drawings until Alexander saw what he wanted to build. George, the firm’s financier, selected and purchased sites throughout the Coachella Valley, and Bob Alexander did the building. Together, they would build over 1,200 homes in Palm Springs.\n\nOcotillo Lodge – 1957 – 1958\n\nTwin Palms Estates – 1957 – 1958\n\nRamon Rise – 1956\n\nEnchanted Homes – 1957\n\nRacquet Club Road Estates – 1958 – 1960\n\nVista Las Palmas – 1956 – 1959\n\nGolden Vista Estates – 1960\n\nRacquet Club Estates – 1959 – 1960\n\nGolf Club Estates – 1961\n\nSteel Houses – 1961 – 1962\n\nRiviera Gardens – 1961\n\nAlexander Home – 1962 – 1350 Ladera Circle\n\nLas Palmas Summit – 1962\n\nDesert Lanai – 1963\n\nFarrell Canyon Estates – 1963\n\nAraby Estates – 1964\n\nSunrise Estates – 1964\n\nGreen Fairway Estates – 1964 – 1965\n\nJohn Porter Clark, Architect\n\nIn 1932, he established the firm’s office in Palm Springs and designed several buildings in the desert for them. Clark met Albert Frey when he came to Palm Springs to design the Kocher-Samson building and collaborated with him on several projects. In 1939, Clark and Frey formed a partnership. Clark left the firm in 1958 to establish his solo practice. Notable works include the Hamrick House (1941), Welwood Memorial Library (1940)\n\nWilliam F. Cody, Architect\n\nIn 1945, Cody was retained to alter the Desert Inn, his first commission in Palm Springs. In 1947, he completed the Del Marcos Hotel, his first independent commission, which the AIA Southern California Chapter recognized with an honorable mention.\n\nPost-World War II, Palm Springs was becoming a fashionable weekend and winter retreat for the rich and famous, and Cody’s career flourished along with the city. He moved his practice and his family to Palm Springs. In 1950, he was retained to lead the successful conversion of the Thunderbird Dude Ranch into the Thunderbird Country Club, which led to commissions to design or alter clubhouses, recreational facilities, and residential developments at Eldorado Country Club (with Ernest J. Kump), Tamarisk Country Club, the Racquet Club, and the Tennis Club. In 1960, he began almost a decade of work altering and expanding the Palm Springs Spa Hotel.\n\nCody’s specialization in country club clubhouses with related residential developments led to additional commissions in California, Arizona, Texas, Cuba, and Mexico. His residential projects emphasized key elements of Modernism: simplicity of form, natural light, and large windows offering a seamless connection between residential interiors and the outdoors. Because he’s not boxed in by any one style, it makes his style hard to pin down and often overlooked in architectural circles.\n\nIn 1945, Cody was retained to alter the Desert Inn in Palm Springs. By 1946, Cody was licensed to practice architecture in California and Arizona. After the Abernathy House, he went on to design the Palm Springs Library in 1972 but suffered a debilitating stroke midway through the project. He died in 1978 at the age of 62.\n\nWilliam Cody Residence, 1946, 1950 E.

DuBois\n\nCharles attended UCLA for a year and then transferred to MIT from 1922 – 1930. Traveling between coasts and working at different architectural firms throughout the 1920s, Charles Du Bois was a draftsman at Walker & Eisen (1923- 1931), at Gogerty & Weyl (1926-1929), and at Horatio W. Bishop (1929). Charles E. Du Bois passed the California and national exams in the 1930s and started his own firm in 1938. During WWII, when housing construction slowed, he worked as a Senior Set Designer for MGM.\n\nThe Swiss Miss Houses – 1958 – 1962\n\nExamples:\n\n1133 Vista Vepero – 1958\n\n1110 Abrigo Road – 1958\n\n775 W Crescent Drive – 1958\n\n700, 855 Via Las Palmas – 1959\n\n1355 N Rose Ave – 1961\n\nThese homes were built in the Vista Las Palmas neighborhood of Palm Springs, which was being developed by builder Joe Dunas and the Alexander Construction Company – the local firm behind Donald Wexler’s prefabricated homes. William Krisel had completed several homes in the area with his famed “butterfly” roof and flat roofs that had become typical designs in Palm Springs. But when Dunas tasked Krisel to design homes that could be distinguished from this trend, he rejected the offer. Instead, Dunas turned to architect Charles DuBois, one of modernist architecture’s lesser-known figures. The pitched frames span the entire width of the residence, creating covered porch areas at the entrance and shaded terraces at the rear facing towards the pool. Inside each house, the structure forms a double-height space for the main living areas, while the rest of the facilities occupy the single-story volumes on either side. There are 15 Swiss Miss Houses remaining today in Palm Springs’ Vista Las Palmas.\n\nSunrise L’anai – 1962 – 1964\n\nLas Palmas Summit Historic District – 1962 – 1963\n\nVista Las Palmas neighborhood\n\nCanyon Estates – 1971 – 1973\n\nRoy Fey, Developer\n\nIn 1940, at age 25, he formed his accountancy group and then moved into residential housing development after World War II. He built at least 3,000 houses in Chicago before moving to Palm Springs in 1955 with his wife, Ethel, who had asthma. He also owned a women’s wear business in Chicago, manufacturing leather and suede clothes for both men and women, as well as a trailer manufacturing plant. H also owned the American Condenser Corporation, selling those products to television set manufacturers and the U.S. government.\n\nUpon arrival, Fey founded a real estate company, Fey’s Canyon Realtors, and a construction company, Fey Construction Company. One of his first purchases was the Desert Skies apartment hotel in Palm Springs which he paid $500,000. Located at 2290 S Palm Canyon Drive, these are now condos. He opened his office at 1011 N. Palm Canyon Dr. Immediately, he began developing residential property. He was also a founder of the Bank of Palm Springs in the early 1980s. They lived at 1120 S. Calle de Maria.\n\nCaballeros Estates – 1959 – Designed by Wexler & Harrison\n\nEl Rancho Vista Estates – 1960 – Designed by Wexler & Harrison.\n\nCanyon View Estates – 1962 – Designed by William Krisel\n\nMesquite Canyon Estates – 1979\n\nCanyon West Estates\n\nAlbert Frey, Architect\n\nAlbert Frey was born in Zurich in 1903. He was the son of Albert Frey Senior, an active artist in Zurich, Switzerland. He had three sisters who also lived in Zurich. Albert studied architecture and eventually took a position in Paris at the office of Le Corbusier under a student visa. At first, he received no salary, but eventually, he was offered a small salary because of the quality of his work. Work in Paris eventually declined, and Frey resigned. When his American visa was approved, he headed to New York, where he interviewed with A. Lawrence Kocher is also the managing editor of Architectural Record. He was offered a position for a salary of $25 a week, which was considered good money in the Depression years.\n\nFrey and his partner, A. Lawrence Kocher, began designing the Aluminaire House in 1930. The metal and glass structure was built in less than 10 days for the 1931 Architectural League Show in New York. This full-scale house was sheathed entirely in ribbed aluminum over an insulation board covered with building paper. Aluminum posts and lightweight steel beams with non-loadbearing exterior walls supported it. Aluminum washers and screws held the house together. All window sashes, doors, and frames were steel. Built-in furniture provided efficient use of space. The expo opened on April 18th, 1931, for one week. Over 100,000 people toured. Henry Russel Hitchcock and Philip Johnson included the house in the Museum of Modern Art, “Modern Architecture; an International Exhibition” in 1932. Traveling for two years to fourteen locations in the United States, the exhibition significantly developed the American modern movement.\n\nIt was sold to architect Wallace K. Harrison, who moved it to Huntington, NY, for a guest house. After escaping demolition by a new owner in 1986, it was moved to the New York Institute of Technology. After several years, they transferred it to The Aluminaire House Foundation, which was formed in 2010 to relocate it as a museum. In April 2012, the house was again dismantled and stored in a container in Ronkonkoma, NY. In 2016, Architecture Record designated Aluminaire as one of the 125 most significant structures in the world. In 2017, it was moved to Palm Springs. It is considered among the best examples of modern architecture in the United States. It is currently erected in front of the Palm Springs Art Museum.\n\nOne of the commissions that changed his life came in the summer of 1934. It was an office/apartment dual-use building on Palm Canyon for Kocher’s brother, Dr. J. J. Kocher of Palm Springs. Frey visited Palm Springs for the first time and fell in love with the desert. The building began what would be known as the “desert modernism.” After the project, there was no work for him in New York, so from 1935 to 1937, Frey stayed in Palm Springs and worked with John Porter Clark under the firm name of Van Pelt and Lind Architects, as both were yet unlicensed in California. April 1937 saw Frey briefly return to work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1939, he and his wife Marion returned to Palm Springs to resume their collaboration with Clark, which would continue for nearly twenty more years. Frey and Marion divorced in 1945, and neither remarried.\n\nAlbert Frey, Sr. arrived in the Village in September 1948 to make his home with his son, Albert Frey Jr. They lived at 1150 Paseo El Mirador in Palm Springs. He took an active part in the work of the local art colony almost instantly. Unfortunately, he passed away from pneumonia shortly after his arrival. He had been ill for only a few days.\n\nSignificant buildings by Frey during this period include his private residences, Frey House I and II, the Loewy House, built for industrial designer Raymond Loewy, the Palm Springs City Hall, the Cree House II, North Shore Yacht Club on the northeastern shore of the Salton Sea, the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway Valley Station and the iconic “flying wedge” canopy of the Tramway Gas Station at the foot of the entrance to the tramway on the northern edge of Palm Springs, now used as a visitors center.\n\nHis business partner, John Porter Clark, who had much to do with the building up of the Village since the early 1930s, was commissioned as a First Lieutenant in the Army Engineering Corps in 1942 and stationed with the Army Air Corps at Minter Field, near Bakersfield. During his absence, Albert Frey was also charged from their office at 869 North Palm Canyon Drive. During this time, Albert was also a member of the Palm Springs Desert Museum board.\n\nRobson C. Chambers joined the firm in 1946 and was made a partner in 1952.\n\nAt the end of 1956, John Porter Clark left the firm to establish a solo practice focusing on large commercial, public, and institutional buildings. Frey remained interested in various building types, mainly residential, for which he held a particular affinity. In their non-residential work, the remaining partnership is between Frey and Chambers. When the Tramway Gas Station was completed, the firm of Frey and Chambers dissolved. From 1966 to his retirement in the 1980s, Frey worked alone. Frey’s commissions consisted primarily of additions and alterations to houses in Smoke Tree Ranch. Frey died in Palm Springs in 1998 at the age of 95 and was buried at Welwood Murray Cemetery.\n\nFrey personified the same qualities found in his buildings: elegant, simple, streamlined, and clever. Even his wardrobe demonstrated a sensual notion of esthetic frugality. He wore shirts, trousers, and socks in a strictly limited white, powder blue, salmon, pale yellow, and beige palette. For Frey, Modernism was not merely a stylistic issue but a philosophical way of life.\n\nKocher – Sampson Building – 1934, 766 North Palm Canyon\n\nJames V.

A master carpenter by trade, Hicks built many of The Desert Inn buildings and oil magnate Tom O’Donnell’s house above what is now the O’Donnell Golf Course. O’Donnell financed Hicks’ purchase of the Whitewater Mutual Water Company from Prescott T. Stevens in the 1920s, and Hicks founded Palm Springs Water Company, as well as the first building supply store in the area, located at present-day Sunny Dunes Road and Palm Canyon Drive. Hicks also built the Ingleside Inn and several houses in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of Hicks’ buildings were designed by William Charles Tanner, an “architectural artist.” In the 1940s, Hicks developed the Little Tuscany Estates. He served on Palm Springs’ first city council and was involved in the City’s incorporation in 1938.\n\nA. Quincy Jones, Architect\n\nA. Quincy Jones was an architect from Los Angeles who designed many glamorous mid-century modern homes. He owned his own firm, A. Quincy Jones, AIA, and Associates. The company won the coveted American Institute of Architects’ Architectural Firm Award for “overall achievement in architecture” in 1969 and Jones personally was the recipient of more than 70 citations for excellence in his field. He collaborated with many architects, including Paul R. Williams for a few Palm Springs projects.\n\nTennis Club Addition – 1946\n\nTown & Country – 1947, 169 N.

Kaptur first worked briefly for Wexler & Harrison but was laid off during the 1957 recession. Skilled at free-hand drawing, he made artist’s renderings of buildings for Wexler, Albert Frey, and other local architects. Business picked up in 1958 when homebuilders began developing Palm Springs on a large scale, and Kaptur found himself designing post-and-beam houses. In 1962, he formed a partnership with licensed architect Robert Ricciardi to get the commission for Palm Springs Fire Station #3 and the Palm Springs Golf Course Clubhouse. After that partnership broke up in 1965, he formed a company with Larry Lapham, noted architect Howard Lapham’s son, which lasted ten years. After a partnership with James Cioffi, he semi-retired in 1992.\n\nIn 2001, Hugh Kaptur’s life took a new turn when he married Helen Dzo Dzo. Helen, a professional model in the 1960s, was a favorite of designers and photographers. Her friendship with Nelda Linsk led to a memorable event in 1970. Helen was invited to the Kaufmann house for a photo shoot by Slim Aaron, immortalizing the iconic photo ‘Poolside Gossip,’ which came to symbolize the epitome of the Palm Springs lifestyle.\n\nNoel Gillette House – 1957, 1033 East Via Colusa\n\nImpala Lodge – 1958, 555 East San Lorenzo Road\n\nArthur and June Boyer House – 1958, 984 North Rose Avenue\n\nThe Hugh and Rosemary Kaptur House – 1958, 1897 East Belding Drive\n\nDesert Park Estates – 1958\n\nEarl Stroube Spec House I – 1958, 1951 South Camino Monte\n\nEarl Stroube Spec House II – 1959,1935 South Camino Monte\n\nThe Pete Siva House – 1959, 660 Palisades Drive\n\nResidence – 1960 , 1577 Calle Marcus\n\nPalm Springs Fire Station #3 – 1963, Corner Via Miraleste and Racquet Club (next to Victoria Park)\n\nSteve McQueen House – 1964, 2203 Southridge Drive\n\nCasa Blanca Motor Hotel, now Musicland Hotel – 1967, 1342 South Palm Canyon Drive\n\nTahquitz Creek Golf Course Clubhouse – 1967, 1885 Golf Club Dr\n\nPalm Springs Fire Station #4 – 1971, 1300 S La Verne Way\n\nDesert Dorado – 1973\n\nThe William Holden House – 1977, 2433 Southridge Drive\n\nCanyon West Estates Condominiums – 1978\n\nCanyon East Estates Condominiums – 1978\n\nPalm Villas – 1979, 3155 Ramon Road\n\nTahquitz Plaza – 1974 – 1977, 600 – 700 East Tahquitz Canyon Way\n\nRancho El Mirador Condominiums – 1983, 291 E Mel Avenue\n\nThe Deauville Condominiums – 1985, East Amado Road and El Segundo\n\nVilla Caballeros Condos – 1985, 255 S Avenida Caballeros\n\nVilla Serena Apartments – 1986 , 900 East Saturnino Road\n\nPueblos Apartments – 1987\n\nPaul and Kay Selzer House – 1988, 38727 Maracaibo Circle\n\nThe Villas – 2002, 1700 South Araby Drive\n\nKaptur Court – 2016, 262 West Vista Chino\n\nWilliam Krisel, Architect\n\nWilliam Krisel, AIA, principal of the firm of Palmer & Krisel (formed with Partner Dan Palmer), was born in 1924 in Shanghai to American parents working overseas for the U.S. State Department. Krisel lived in China until age 13 when his family returned to the US, where he attended Beverly Hills High. He entered the army in the intelligence department and served as the Chinese-language interpreter for General Stillwell. On a GI Bill, he received his degree in architecture at USC in 1950 and has been a licensed landscape architect since 1954.\n\nKrisel went into partnership with Dan Saxon Palmer. Palmer and Krisel, A.I.A. Architects, designed custom homes and commercial projects tract homes in the Los Angeles area. As early as 1952, Palmer & Krisel’s modular post and beam construction system proved popular and effective.\n\nA close personal friend of developer Bob Alexander and his family, Krisel came to the Desert at Alexander’s request to design a tract of modernist houses dubbed Smoke Tree Valley (now known as Twin Palms for the pair of Palm trees that graced each of the homes).\n\nOther Palmer & Krisel projects include the Ocotillo Lodge, Las Palmas Estates (Vista Las Palmas), Kings Point and Canyon View Estates, Racquet Club Estates, “Valley of the Sun” in Rancho Mirage and the Sandpiper condo complex in Palm Desert (which garnered an AIA merit award for Landscape Architecture). The “House of Tomorrow,” conceived as an experiment in modern living, impressed Alexander’s wife Helene so that they made it their residence. The house later gained fame as the honeymoon home of Elvis and Priscilla Presley.\n\nJohn Lautner, Architect\n\nLautner studied under Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West and became site supervisor on several Wright projects including Ennis House, Los Angeles. His projects often characterized by an iconic image like a cave, terrace, or special roof line or shape. He would do models of the designs because he felt drawings were not always easy to visualize the space. In 1938 Lautner moved to Los Angeles and created for himself a life-long career focusing on residential architecture. Two of his most recognized works are Elrod House and Bob Hope’s Flying Saucer House.\n\nElrod House – 1968\n\nBob Hope Residence – 1973 – 1979\n\nJack Meiselman, Developer\n\nJack I. Meiselman was born in New York City to Jewish parents and was one of six children. During the 1920s, Meiselman relocated to Chicago and worked in the family handkerchief manufacturing business, but he also broadened his interests in construction. He did well financially there and married his wife, Berne “Babe” Meiselman. They were always both listed as co-owners/sub-dividers of Meiselman tracts. In 1944, the Meiselman’s moved to California. They appeared in the Palm Springs City Directory in 1946 at 1276 Indian Avenue. By 1948, the Meiselman’s had moved to 1240 Monte Vista Avenue. He was a developer, not an architect, but his firm developed the designs.\n\nIn the 1950s, Meiselman developed hundreds of mid-century modern-style tract homes in the city. Meiselman was fond of making functional and decorative exterior walls out of meticulously-designed concrete bricks. Such walls are beautiful, allow breezes to pass through, and provide shade. Common elements of Meiselman homes are their tongue-and-groove ceilings, clerestory windows, scored stucco, concrete block, and walls of glass at the rear. The homes were also all originally installed with central heating and air conditioning, a scarce commodity in 1959.\n\nHe worked with George Gannon, president of Gannon Realty, which had been in Palm Springs since 1934.\n\nEl Mirador Park – 1946 -1955, 1252 Pasatiempo Road.\n\nLuring Sands Park – 1953\n\nKarlisa Cove – 1956\n\nPalm Lane Estates – 1956 – 1958\n\nRamon Rise Estates – 1956, corner of El Cielo and Ramon Road.\n\nChino Palms Estates – 1958 – 1959\n\nAlejo Palms Estates – 1959\n\nRichard Neutra, Architect\n\nRichard Neutra built the Grace Lewis Miller House in 1937 at 2311 N. Indian Canyon Drive. Although a small home, it combined a dance studio for the owner. It is a good representation of Neutra’s use of simple, flat-roofed forms arranged and adapted to the sun, outdoor space, and the need for coolness and ventilation in the desert. The glass and steel home comprises taut plane surfaces with no ornamentation.\n\nNeutra created a modern Southern California regionalism, combining a light metal frame with a stucco finish to create a light, effortless appearance. “He specialized in extending architectural space into a carefully arranged landscape. The dramatic images of flat-surfaced, industrialized residential buildings contrasted against nature.\n\nIn 1946, Edgar Kaufmann hired Neutra to design a desert home for his family in Palm Springs. A decade earlier, Frank Lloyd Wright had built Fallingwater for Mr. Kaufmann. But Kaufmann, having seen Taliesin West, thought that Wright didn’t understand desert design and chose Neutra instead. The home turned out so well that when Wright saw it, he admitted it was beautiful (uncharacteristic of him). The building remains the most famous in Palm Springs in terms of international recognition.\n\nIt is located at 470 West Vista Chino Road. The flat roof, steel frame, and glass walls embodied one prominent version of Modernism by using sharp, clean, minimalist, machine-made lines contrasting with the beauty of the open, natural site with the rugged slopes of Mt. San Jacinto as a backdrop. Using stone and wood finishes represented an evolution of Neutra’s ideas from those seen in the earlier Miller House (1937, 2311 N. Indian Canyon Drive; HSPB-45). To finish the home, Kaufmann employed three crews, working 24 hours a day. He had a personal representative on the site, constantly on the phone with him, and drove up costs significantly with 600 change orders. A house initially priced at $35,000 — a pretty penny in the lean years immediately following World War II — ballooned to $295,000.\n\nWhen photographed by Julius Shulman and disseminated worldwide, the Kaufmann House became an iconic image of Modern architecture. The north wing is the guest’s quarters that are publicly accessible but retain their private needs as they are separated from the rest of the house. The house’s west wing is the service wing, which is pretty secluded from the rest of the open-plan design. The east wing is the most privatized aspect of the house, as it is Kaufmann’s primary suite.\n\nDan Palmer, Architect\n\nBy 1955, Palmer was overseeing work in Orange and Ventura counties, Krisel in San Diego and Riverside counties. George Alexander, Harlan Lee and other developers built more than 20,000 houses designed by Palmer and Krisel in Southern California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas and Florida by the end of the 1950s. Palmer and Krisel collaborated on projects in the Los Angeles area until dissolving their partnership in 1964.\n\nJames Schuler Associates\n\nVilla Roma – 1963\n\nPaul Trousdale, Developer\n\nOn either side of the banks of Tahquitz “Wash”, just south of central Palm Springs, lies this neighborhood which uniquely represents the past, the present and the future of Palm Springs. Paul Trousdale partnered with Pearl McManus to build 200+ modern & traditional style homes in the Tahquitz River Estates neighborhood.\n\nNot much could be done with it at first because the “river” would carve a new direction each rainy season. The first development in the area was called Palos Verdes Estates from the early 1930s on land originally owned by Judge John McCallum. When the county finally stabilized the banks, “Auntie” Pearl teamed with a famous builder from Los Angeles, Trousdale, to develop homes on either side of the banks.\n\nDonald Wexler, Architect\n\nDonald Wexler moved to Los Angeles in 1950 where he worked for architect Richard Neutra, and subsequently moved to Palm Springs to work for William Cody on the Tamarisk Country Club. In 1952, Wexler, along with Richard Harrison, a colleague from Cody’s firm, set up their own offices as Wexler & Harrison. That partnership dissolved amicably in 1961, and Wexler formed Donald A. Wexler Associates in 1963. Wexler retired in 2002. He was named a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 2004, and in 2009 he was the subject of a documentary titled Journeyman Architect: The Life and Work of Donald Wexler. Wexler passed away in Palm Desert on June, 25, 2015 at the age of 89.\n\nJoe and Joyce Pawling House – 1954, 230 West Lilliana Drive\n\nLeeds-Howard House I – 1954, 515 Via Lola\n\nWexler Residence – 1955, 1272 East Verbena Drive.

Stewart Williams arrived in Palm Springs in 1946 to join his father, Harry, and brother, Roger Williams, in architectural practice. Stewart’s father decided to move to Palm Springs in an attempt to ease the distress of his wife, Una, who had severe rheumatoid arthritis. Palm Springs was not new to Harry Williams, as he had designed the Spanish Colonial Revival style La Plaza Shopping Center for Mrs. Julia Carnell, an important Ohio-based client, in the heart of the growing desert city in 1936. After settling in Palm Springs following America’s entry into World War II, Harry Williams opened an architectural firm, obtaining commissions almost immediately. During World War II, the firm of Harry J. Williams was responsible for numerous single and multi-family dwellings, several medical clinics, a local hospital, a handful of retail stores, a hotel, high school classrooms, restaurants, a Masonic Temple, and a service station, among other projects.\n\nStewart moved to Palm Springs with his wife and two children at the age of 38. While studying in Stockholm, Stewart met and married Mari Schlytern, cousin of Anders Beckman, designer of Sweden’s exhibit at the New York World’s Fair. Mari and her two children, Jan Erik and Mari Anne, stayed at La Plaza, where the Williams maintained their architectural offices.\n\nHe was a graduate of Cornell and Pennsylvania universities. He came to California from the east after four years on the faculty of Bard College, Columbia University, where he taught both architectural design and modern painting. He was also associated with the firm of Raymond Loewy, a nationally known industrial designer, for several years in New York City. At 35, he has already won numerous prizes and medals for outstanding work in the arts, among them the American Institute of Architects Student Medal, the American Water Color Society’s Zabduskie Prize, and the American Academy in Rome Collaborative Prize.\n\nAlmost immediately, he took on the lead designer role in constructing two modest commercial buildings and his first important residential commission, the residence of Frank Sinatra. In the ensuing five decades of his career, Williams successfully united the warmth of natural materials with the precision of International Style Modernism in designing buildings devoted to client needs while tailored to the local setting. The business name was Harry J. Williams until 1948 when it became the firm of Williams, Williams, and Williams.\n\nWilliams’ architectural impact in the Coachella Valley was enormous. It is revealed in the number of projects he has built: houses, schools, hotels, banks, religious buildings, and educational and cultural institutions. It is revealed in the prominence of some of his buildings:\n\nThe Frank Sinatra House – 1947, 1148 East Alejo Road\n\nPalm Springs High School , 333 South Farrell Drive\n\nTemple Isaiah, 1949-1951 (substantially altered)\n\nOasis Commercial Building , 1953 – 1955 , southwest corner of Palm Canyon Drive and Tahquitz\n\nThe Edris Residence – 1954, 1030 West Cielo Drive\n\nKoerner Residence – 1955 , 1275 West Calle de Maria\n\nHarold Hicks Real Estate and Insurance Building – 1955, 345 North Palm Canyon Drive\n\nE.
