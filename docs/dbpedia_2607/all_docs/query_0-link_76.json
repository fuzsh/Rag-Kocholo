        "text": "The University of Mary Marauders Hall of Fame\n\nBack To Hall of Fame Back To Hall of Fame\n\nChoose a Hall Of Fame Member:\n\nShayne Walth\n\nClass\n\nInduction\n\n1999\n\nSport(s)\n\nFootball\n\nA Bismarck native and a St. Mary's graduate, Shayne Walth played on the first two University of Mary varsity football teams and is a member of the Marauders Hall of Fame. The 1984 North Dakota High School athlete of the year, he played football at Dickinson State University for two seasons and competed in track for a year at Moorhead State University. When U-Mary started a football program, Shayne came home and was a student-coach on the school's first football squad in 1987 and worked with defensive backs, quarterbacks and receivers. Walth would quarterback the first two Marauders varsity teams in 1988 and 1989. He earned All-NDCAC honorable mention honors in his first season and claimed All-NDCAC recognition after leading the league in total offense as a senior in 1989. One of the few upperclassmen along with Toby Schweitzer, the pair served as team captains for the offense and defense. While the 1987 team took their \"lumps,\" highlights included the win over Rocky Mountain College in the school's first varsity game and playing competitively with several last minute losses. 1989 highlights included winning their first conference games over Mayville State and Jamestown College and falling to three nationally ranked teams – Dickinson State, Valley City State and Minot State – by a total of 10 points with chances to win all three.\n\n\"We did not have the success that I would have desired but I take great pride in being the first QB and an original leader of the first teams that helped establish a tradition for future teams,\" Shayne commented. \"In search of some memories, I revisited my old scrap book to help with facts and found a favorite excerpt that I thought summed me up the best. 'A Fran Tarkenton like QB with the athletic ability and quickness to extend plays, Walth gives the Marauders a chance to win any game.'\"\n\nA graduate assistant coach on the 1990 team, Shayne also competed in track & field for the Marauders. He graduated from the University of Mary in 1990 with a degree in Social and Behavioral Sciences and a secondary education minor.\n\nShayne is now the general manager of Bruce's Manufactured Housing, a family owned and operated business that includes Spiffy Biffs, an active sponsor of Marauders athletics. Active in coaching youth sports in the community, Shayne is married to Marlina, a distinguished former Marauders cross country and track & field athlete, and has two sons, Isaac, a member of the Marauders track & field team, and Christian.\n\n(UPDATED APRIL 2016)\n\nBack To Hall of Fame"
