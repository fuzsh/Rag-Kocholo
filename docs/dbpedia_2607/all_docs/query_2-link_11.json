        "text": "If any rock millionaire other than Robert Smith claimed not to know the chart position of his latest single, it would be impossible to believe.The record in question, “Lullaby”, is at number five,the highest position ever achieved by his group, The Cure, yet he says, “We only knew it was out because the local record shop has it on sale.” Surrounded by standard fodder about love and dancing, Smith’s allegory of being eaten alive by a spider-man looks like an open wound in a kindergarten.\n\nOver 13 years his hypnotic chord progressions, his distressed voice, his lyric obsessions (religion, bleak dreams, lost love, fading memories) and not least his electrified crow’s nest hairstyle have lifted The Cure from cult obscurity to the point where their last album, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me (1987), quietly sold two million copies around the world. So quietly that taxi drivers still have no idea who he is, even after he tells them the name of his group. “I sit in the back thinking ‘This is perfect’.”\n\nSmith, 30 this week, has long been unconventional. At 11 he turned up at school in Crawley wearing his mother’s black velvet dress. “I really don’t know why. I thought I looked good. My teachers were so liberal they tried hard not to notice, but on the way home I was beaten up.”\n\nThree years later he was expelled from another school. “They said I was disruptive, but it was a personal thing. I hated the headmaster and he hated me.” He is not so very far from rock-and-roll orthodoxy.\n\nSmith spent some time on the dole, then formed The Cure in 1976. The group was loved by the critics and ignored by the public. Album cover artwork never featured the faces of the group a policy record companies still consider foolhardy, despite its having been employed by such notable successes as Yes, Led Zeppelin and The Smiths.If fans can’t see the group, how can they identify with them? “I’ve never been comfortable with the way we look,” Smith offers in explanation. “Our records were exactly what I wanted them to be. It would have spoiled them to put us on the front.”\n\nThis deliberate absence of image was maintained until the video era made it impossible.Cure videos, however, are hardly tailor-made for Top of the Pops. The “Lullaby” video is three minutes of surreal nightmare, an exquisitely frightening homage to the film Poltergeist, unlikely to be suitable for early evening viewing.\n\n“We didn’t want to release ‘Lullaby’. I actually want to get rid of some of the people who bought the last album,” Smith insists,but he conceded to Polydor Records that a single be released to promote the new album, Disintegration (out next Tuesday). “‘Lullaby’ is my least favourite track, but I suppose it’s a sensible choice because it sounds very Cure-like.”\n\nRadio One evidently shared Smith’s dislike of “Lullaby”, because it wasn’t playlisted in its week of release,despite which it entered the charts at number 11, the group’s highest new entry.\n\n“If I’d tried to be successful, if I’d listened to the advice the record company had given me over the years, I’m sure we wouldn’t be making music now.The way I behave only seems strange if you assume success has been my prime motivation.”\n\nHe still drives the same ageing Lada, lives in a spartan Maida Vale flat, and supports the same charities (Greenpeace, CND, Mencap) but mentions them only when asked. “It goes back to things like Morrissey not eating meat. I was a vegetarian for three years, but I didn’t feel a need to champion it as a cause. If people despise us as much as I despise Morrissey, and I say Greenpeace is wonderful, they’re likely to firebomb the Rainbow Warrior.”\n\nSmith’s logic may not make sense out here in the real world but, within the microcosm of The Cure, he has remained faithful to his ideals. He professes to have little idea of why he is successful, but, when pressed, it becomes clear that he understands the phenomenon very well. “I suppose our music fulfils a need some people feel. It communicates, but nothing specific, just the desire not to feel isolated.”\n\nThis sort of communication takes longer to establish than a dance craze, but Smith knows that once a fan is hooked, he (and it is usually he) tends to stay hooked. Given the group’s success, Smith is justified in thinking he must be doing something right. Disintegration features his most intense and agonized work for several years,but it looks set to double the sales of Kiss Me.\n\n“It has to stop,” he says quietly. “After Kiss Me it all got so big, I felt it was happening to some other band, but here I am doing it again.In some weird way, I suppose I must have become,” and he pronounces the word with evident dismay, “a performer.”\n\n© Johnny Black & The Times\n\nWith their 80s heyday long behind them, The Cure had been written off by many as Goth hasbeens. Then they release their best album in a decade – and Robert Smith says it will be their last. Caroline Sullivan asked him why\n\nn October 1998, an American beer company staged a mystery gig at the London Forum, starring a “top international band” whose identity was kept under wraps until the minute they walked on stage. Speculation centred on Blur and Oasis, which made the disappointment that much more acute when the curtain finally went up on a familiar dishevelled figure in makeup that had apparently been applied by a five-year-old. Voicing the thoughts of many, someone in the balcony sighed, “Oh, it’s the Cure” in the sort of tone you would reserve for “It’s the postman.”\n\nOnly an American brewery could have mistaken the Cure for a hot band in late 1998. Eclipsed by Britpop, they were a group out of time. Their last album, 1996’s Wild Mood Swings, lived up to its title by mixing morbid gothscapes with salsa in an ill-judged attempt to update. Considered the worst release of their 20-year career, it sold “only” one million copies, and a 1997 best-of, Galore, sold even fewer. To put it bluntly, the Cure and their doomy world view were part of an era nobody wanted to remember.\n\nClearly as delighted to be there as the crowd were to have them, they meandered glumly through their set. As ever, Robert Smith was the focal point, dominating the stage as only a hefty bloke in lipstick can. But there was a poignancy about him that night, if poignant is the right word for a man who had sold 27 million records and still had the allegiance of thousands of “disenfranchised” (his word) ex-Goths. It was embodied by his heterosexual-in-make-up look, which was confrontational when he pioneered it in the 80s but had since been adopted by everyone from Marilyn Manson to Kevin Rowland. And here he was, still clinging to eyeliner at the age of 39. Tragic.\n\nSixteen months later, it’s a different story. It’s February 2000 and Smith is lounging around a swanky Mayfair hotel, ready to take his band into the 21st century. There’s a sold-out show at London’s Astoria tonight and a new album that’s won the Cure their best reviews in a decade. Smith has recovered from the low ebb of the Forum and his black eye pencil has been applied for enhancement rather than shock value.\n\nHe remembers the Forum show with little pleasure. “I got into ‘principle’ trouble with that one. We got an absurd amount of money to play one gig and it was the one time I’ve ever compromised myself. The others threatened to mutiny if I turned it down.”\n\nThis is the rockster who refused to allow himself to be “done” on Stars in Their Eyes because, he says vehemently: “I loathe kitsch and irony. I hate that sardonic little ironic smile, it’s the worst type of patronising thing. This is pretentious, but I’ve always liked to think I’m doing it for art.”\n\nWhich is exactly why Cure fans – and they’re still legion, posting messages on websites with names such as It Doesn’t Matter If We All Die – see Smith as an almost mystical figure, ploughing his own bleak furrow in an age when other stars collude with Hello!. We’ll never see his south-coast house in the pages of gossip mags, or his wife Mary, who’s been in his life since he was 18, in the front row at Versace.\n\nEver since the Telegraph printed his address while reporting on a court case brought by former drummer Lol Tolhurst (“A malleable person. It took me a long time to get over the anger”), Smith won’t even reveal where he lives. “I beg of you to please just say Brighton,” he requests. He actually lives not in Brighton but about 20 miles from his home town of Crawley, West Sussex, where he started the Cure in 1976. His publicist, whom he shares with the Spice Girls, describes his current residence as “a really grey place where you’d never expect to find a rock star”.\n\nSmith has just taken a £65 cab ride from there, arriving at the hotel a few hours before he’s due on stage. Everyone in reception watches him arrive, as you do a geezerish six-footer with eggbeater hair and mascara.\n\nBut where’s the lipstick? “I put some on before I left. I wear make-up every day. I must’ve bitten it off in the cab,” he says a few minutes later, settled into a suite with two bottles of orange juice.\n\nI ask if I can make a suggestion. “What?” he asks warily. His usual shade is too dark, I venture. His skin has a yellow undertone, so he needs a brighter colour. “I haven’t got yellow in my skin!” he protests. “You mean like I’ve got jaundice?”\n\nI swipe some Clinique Golden Raisin on the back of his hand. “Too much brown,” he decides instantly. No, it goes with your eyes. “But they’re blue,” he says, wavering on the cusp of a fashion decision. Ultimately he fails to be swayed by the argument that brown better suits the nearly-41-year-old gentleman. And at the gig that night, his mouth is defiantly crimson. “I was sent a big box of lipstick by an American company called Jane that’ll probably outlive me,” he explains.\n\nHaving crossed the rubicon of 40 last April, Smith is finally happy, or as happy as someone who still despairs of “the futility of existence” can be. He looks unfeasibly healthy for someone who used to have drink and drug binges, he still adores his wife (“I’m amazed that the girl I fell in love with is still in love with me. I haven’t had any other girlfriend since we started going out at 18”), and he’s even been on South Park, which helped Uncle Bob’s credibility with his 22 nieces and nephews.\n\nThings are encouraging on the professional front, too. The Cure – whose ever-changing line-up includes not a single founder member except Smith – have just announced their biggest British date in years at Wembley Arena in April, and this week they release the album Bloodflowers, which many count as their best since 1989’s landmark of gloom, Disintegration.\n\nThere’s a sense of freedom: being out of the loop has allowed them to be themselves, and with the ghostly, desolate Bloodflowers, they’ve rediscovered their soul. Admitting that Wild Mood Swings was “mixed up and incoherent – it even confused me”, Smith sees Bloodflowers as his redemption, the last part of a trilogy that began with 1982’s acid-deranged Pornography and continued with Disintegration.\n\n“The tone is melancholy and regretful,” he confirms cheerily. “The dominant theme is time passing. There’s nothing beyond, no hope.” This typical bit of Smithspeak chimes with his latest announcement of the band’s imminent dissolution: “At the moment, I can’t imagine making another album. I haven’t written a song for ages and have no desire to.”\n\nIt also suggests a mid-life crisis, perhaps? Not at all, he insists, gingerly inserting a finger into the frazzled mass on his head. “Forty doesn’t bother me at all. Thirty did ‘cos I considered it to be old, but 40 is just a bit older. When I was very young I never even considered being 40. Like anyone else who listened to Bowie I thought I’d pack my life into 25 years and that would be it. But if anything I’m much happier and healthier now.”\n\nSmith’s car arrives to take him to soundcheck, and the conversation continues en route. A few minutes later the car pulls up outside the Astoria and dozens of fans instantly surround it, all intent on talking to Smith. “Ultimately I’d like to make film music so I wouldn’t have to be a public performer,” he sighs, preparing to meet his people. “Because it means shaving and putting on make-up and steeling my resolve.”\n\nThen he’s outside, signing autographs and posing for pictures as a gang of Japanese girls clamours for his attention. He assumes the professional rock star’s attitude of pleasant aloofness, never stopping even as he signs and poses until he finally eases through the crowd and into the building.\n\nHis last words before getting out of the car are: “I don’t love being the centre of attention. I’ve always worn black because I don’t want to be noticed, and it’s paradoxical that I’ve ended up being the singer in a group. The driving force in the modern world is to be famous, but I have a naive desire to be an artist.”\n\n© The Guardian\n\nSo you thought THE CURE’s first single was Lovecats, . Think again sucker as ANDREW COLLINS tumbles through the 11 years littered with kitchen sink angst, psychiatrist couch wails, spotty shirts and empty lipstick containers that brought them from the spiky stab of Killing An Arab to the whispering hush of Lullaby.\n\nI took a few steps towards the spring. The Arab didn’t move. Even now he was some distance away. Perhaps because of the shadows on his face, he seemed to be laughing. (The Outsider, Albert Camus)\n\nIt is poignant, indeed, that Albert Camus’ existential classic The Outsider should inspire a young Robert Smith to write a song called Killing An Arab, the very first installment in the vinyl history of The Cure.\n\nIn the book, Camus tackles the indifference of the universe and the alienation that results from subverting a Godless society’s rulebook. If today’s Cure are seen as eccentric ragdoll Pop beacons – the acceptable face of weirdness, kidstuff, even – then it can only be as a result of staring their own self-estrangement in the face and painting a clown’s smile on it.\n\nThere are those (our younger viewers) who are secure in the belief that The Cure’s first single was the jelly-and-cream Lovecats, . On the other side of the universe exist those who mourn the death of The(ir) Cure that followed the soul-scraping depths of Pornography. Either way, the story of The Cure is one that spans an entire decade of changes – musical, physical and spiritual.\n\nIn effect, whether by design or happy accident, they have turned their ‘outsideness’ to their own advantages, Robert Smith is the Outsider who came in from the cold.\n\nIn 1974 Smith lost his virginity to Mary (“the nicest girl in the school”). That the two are today happily married might say something about the man who has escorted his polymorphous Cure from classroom distraction in Crawley through to main attraction all over Europe. His first electric guitar was a Christmas present in 1972, by 1976, a group called Malice were rehearsing odd covers of David Bowie and Alex Harvey songs.\n\nJanuary 1977, Smith was expelled from school, and the band changed their name to Easy Cure. They won an Ariola-Hansa talent competition in May which resulted in no vinyl release but plenty of paid-for equipment and demo time. Hansa dissolved the contract in March ’78, refusing to put out Killing An Arab for fear of offending the Arabs.\n\nThen, with Smith on vocals, school chum Lawrence Tolhurst on drums and Michael Dempsey on bass, and with their name clipped to The Cure, they met Chris Parry, A&R at Polydor, and things began to happen.\n\nDECEMBER 1978\n\nWith a fair amount of gigs behind them (including slots with UK Subs, Wire and Generation X), December 78 was a crucial month for The Cure. They made their John Peel debut on the 4th, had their first music press interview published on the 16th (with Adrian Thrills for the NME – “I suggest you catch The Cure immediately’) and released their debut 45 Killing An Arab on the 22nd (initially on indie Small Wonder, then through Parry’s new subsidiary Fiction, with whom The Cure have stayed ever since).\n\nBeginning with a silly mock-Arabian retrain, a simple descending bass scale lowers us into a spikey stab of Pop despair. ‘Staring at the sky, Staring at the gun, Whichever I choose It amounts to the same, Absolutely nothing ” moans a seemingly inconsolable Smith over a tight arrangement of locomotive drums, splash cymbals and pounding bass.\n\nThe Cure managed to half-capture the intricacies of The Outsider’s pivotal scenario, which is no mean feat for a young, middle-class guitar band. There is none of the arbitrary unpleasantness of newtown punk, just an inspired sense of frustration not normally associated with Pop music.\n\nMAY 1979\n\nFiction put out the band’s first album, Three Imaginary Boys , an evasive title reinforced by no band shots on the sleeve, nor title tracks on the label. This deliberate crypticism was interpreted by some as snot-nosed and conceited, including NME’s Paul Morley who wrote: ‘They garnish their 12 little ditties with unreliable trickery, not content to let ordinary songs die ordinary deaths Fatigue music So transparent. Light and – oh, how it nags.\n\nIn truth it is a messy album, flitting from the fastback Pop of Grinding Halt and Fire In Cairo, through kitchen-sink angst (‘10.15 Saturday Night’, ‘So What’) to the shape of things to come, longer, drawn-out meanderings like ‘Three Imaginary Boys and Another Day.\n\nThe Cure are often miscast as Pop kids who disappeared up their own navels, but even at this young stage, Smith was never a get-down-and-party lyricist – it was just youthful energy that potted his objections and doubts into raucous three-minute bursts.\n\nJUNE 1979\n\n‘Boys Don’t Cry’ is still regarded by some as Robert Smith ‘s finest Pop single, Fuelled more by melancholy than malice, it squeezes all the happy – sad emotions of a holiday romance in Blackpool into one magic moment.\n\nOCTOBER 1979\n\nThe follow up, Jumping Someone Else’s Train is also a perfect, condensed POP jaunt, steeped in you the club cynicism that’s almost belied by it, careful guitar work and jolly train track drums.\n\nIf someone were to adhere to a diet of Cure singles they d save themselves a lot of undue worry Even when The Cure play with madness (see Charlotte Sometimes or Hanging Garden) it is in a far more palatable form than some of the excess baggage found at 33 rpm.\n\nNevertheless. as summarised on the pruned, more rounded US version of The Cure’s first movement ( Boys Don’t Cry – which was Three Imaginary Boys minus the weak link… plus the two singles) the early shape of Robert Smith’s vision was about to undergo its first transition Michael Dempsey left the band feeling alienated by Smith’s more protracted, indulgent musical style. He was replaced by Simon Gallup on bass, and Matthieu Hartley joined on keyboards (a clue in itself).\n\nThe sun was beginning to burn my cheeks … it was the same sun as the day of mother’s funeral. (The Outsider).\n\nPrepare to wallow A Forest was a momentous occasion, a turning point, The Cure’s first hit (affording them their TOTP debut) and the sort of song to confine a thousand teenagers to their bedrooms with old diaries and a red light bulb. It is a paranoid masterpiece: a celebratory spiral of symbolism and delicate self-abuse. The forest itself is nature’s own Kafka-esque maze, where Smith’s cry echoes into the trees’ as he searches for the elusive girl.\n\nThe LP Seventeen Seconds was heard – a continuation of this existential web, wherein A Forest becomes upbeat (along with Play For Today which might be a refugee from the first LP). In Your House , Seventeen Seconds (‘a measure of life’) and Three set the overall tone recurrent, unflinching essays of confused, almost incurable despondency. The sleeve is, aptly, all grey except for a last smudge of colour (one to which the retrospective reviewer must now say goodbye.)\n\nFollowing a year of extensive home and away touring (after which Hartley left) The Cure made their most unified bid for psychiatrist’s couch potatoes to date. The LP Faith , dressed totally in grey this time, is a shrine, a monument, and nothing less Tolhurst’s drum patterns are so hypnotically unplayful, Gallup’s bass so encased in the general melee of keyboard atmosphere and blunt-instrument guitar, the listener is either left mesmerised or divorced beyond reconciliation.\n\nThere are no inbetweens with these poems of faith and doubt The title track remains The Cure’s most gloriously depressing hour (Five years later, Robert admitted to crying during a rendition at The Albert Hall. “I wish everything I did had such a strong effect on me.”)\n\nA single, Primary, reached No 43 and typically, it was Faith’s most accessible track.\n\nOCTOBER 1981\n\nIt would be glib to say that The Cure’s grey Period was ‘over’ – never actually remedied, it merely evolved through a new therapeutic approach The single Charlotte Sometimes bridged the gap between “Faith” ‘s luxurious basking and the active exorcism which was to follow. If this all sounds rather serious and foreboding. that’s because it bloody well was.\n\nThe Cure has become a love-or-loathe phenomenon Sixth form poetry and ‘Grammar school angst’ were popular handfuls of mud slung at Robert Smith’s medicine show.\n\n‘Charlotte’ sees him lamenting a female Outsider, a “sacred princess The drum sound is curt, the enveloping synth net extends its reach. and the final cut is a frightening, incomplete musical catharsis. Lovely stuff, but not for the lighthearted!\n\nAPRIL 1982\n\n“It doesn’t I matter if we all die” snarls Smith the back-combed vampire clown on Pornography ‘s opening assault, One Hundred Years . An unwritten John Carpenter film soundtrack where the victim is his own killer, and sex is death The colours of Pornography are red and black, filling in the most impenetrable Cure of their career.\n\nThis is a scapel-happy beast with no movement in its legs – the guitars lash out like undead tongues, and Smith the protagonist lays bare his restless soul on the rack of erotic imagery.\n\nOne more day like today and I’ll kill you, A desire of flesh and real blood, And I’ll watch you drown in the shower, Pushing my life through your open eyes I most fight this sickness, Find a cure ( ‘Pornography’ )\n\nThis album hurts “It wasn’t I really violent,” commented Smith, “It was the inability to be violent.” ‘Phil Spector in Hell I,’ said NME s David Quantick.\n\nIronically, the LP’s wailing singIe, ‘The Hanging Garden’ reached a remarkable No 34 in the charts. Somebody out there was tuning in.\n\nAUGUST 1982\n\nBy this time, The Cure were beginning to crack. Robert recorded a new track, Lament for Flexipop magazine, just Steve Severin of The Banshees and himself.\n\nNOVEMBER 1982\n\n‘Let s Go To Bed’ was a more important turn for the band than their own halfhearted involvement suggested. Gallup had left, so the song was basically a Smith-Tolhurst duet, and if it was borne out of disinterest, it sounds like a fresh start. A jolly, if slightly awkward excursion into dance, it presents The Cure with a huge weight lifted from their chest. It got to No 44.\n\nJULY 1983\n\nWith The Cure a spent force, a dead duck in the eyes of many following disintegration of the line-up, an Oxford Road Show appearance in which Rob, Lol and Brilliant drummer Andy Anderson faltered through two old Pornography tracks and Smith’s temporary enrollment into old mates Siouxsie & The Banshees, The Walk was the biggest surprise of the year.\n\nA humorous paddling-poolfull of ideas. The Cure’s most carefree song thus far, arid – Smash Hits ahoy – a monster hit, peaking at No 12 The video for The Walk features Smith in as many coloured shirts as there are edits, and (gasp) a glimpse of his whimsical side Off-beam videomaker Tim Pope can be credited for this – his wacky style has complemented the ‘New Cure’ ever since.\n\nAnd I too felt ready to life my live again. As if this great outburst of anger had purged all my ills. (The Outsider)\n\nWith Anderson an official member, complemented by old mucker Porl Thompson on (double) bass, The Cure extended playtime once again, with the kitsch jazz sandwich Lovecats, A real family favourite, all Disney surreality and purring ‘Bob’ Smith scrunching his face up for the kids. Student discos up and down the land did a bastardised Twist and spots were worn on shirts.\n\nAccompanied by a dodgy sit-down TOTP appearance, The Caterpillar was a single that made The Cure’s previous forays into underbelly low-life feel like a bad dream. Light, fluffy and optimistic, it seemed to hint that Smith’s creepy-Crawley skin was shed for good.\n\nHowever, anyone using it as a yardstick for its parent LP, The Top was in for a punch in the guts. Shake Dog Shake, the opening blow, is a stray from Pornography, a deliberate warning not to relax too much. Elsewhere, the album is a hotch-potch of old and new. NME’s Danny Kelly deemed it “dreadful”, “ambitious”, and a wretched failure”.\n\nNext to the more vicious elements within, The Top ‘s tuneful peaks often appear ill-at-ease and unresolved But we could always put this down to Smith’s self-professed mid-life crisis.\n\nOCTOBER 1984\n\nThe obligatory live album Concert was released. Andy Anderson, meanwhile, was sacked in Tokyo, and replaced briefly by Psychedelic Furs drummer Vince Ely, then The Thompson Twins Boris Williams\n\nFEBRUARY 1985\n\nOld bassist Simon Gallup rejoined the band.\n\nJULY 1985\n\nCoinciding with Robert Smith’s longest, most ridiculous post-modern moptop ever, Inbetween Days was release and sent to No 15 in the charts, This new, tumbling Pop sound seemed to fit The Cure (now a solid five-piece BAND again) like the custom-made baggy suits they sport in the video – as loose and casual as the jangly acoustic guitar stream that carries the song towards its catherine wheel conclusion.\n\nThe album that followed was simply The Cure’s first confident, consolidated Pop menu. With enough loopy bits to prevent it from ever becoming over-safe, “The Head On The Door” is full of childlike bravado and naive maturity. The words are pithy, harmless and cute, and Smith’s voice sings for the first time. “Such innocence should be cherished if not taken very seriously, ” conceded NME’s Mat Snow.\n\nThe next single Close To Me was one of the band’s first to fairly and squarely represent the LP from which it was culled. A breath-catchy love song with claustrophobic undertones, brilliantly caricatured by Tim Pope in the video featuring your lovable, shaggy Cure inside a wardrobe teetering an the edge of Beachy Head.\n\nMeanwhile, across the Channel, The Cure had become the biggest thing in France since Toulouse Lautrec.\n\nAPRIL 1986\n\nAn odd career decision, considering the band’s burgeoning sense of optimism, Boys Don’t Cry was released, remixed with a newly recorded vocal by Smith. Reaching No 22, it was perceived by The Cure s second generation fans as a brand new song. I’ve liked The Cure ever since they started, ever since Lovecats (a fan outside the Royal Albert Hall gig)\n\nThe singles album Standing On A Beach followed (plus compilation video). It proved The Cure to be on a par with Madness and Depeche Mode as one of the most reliable singles bands of the decade.\n\nMAY 1987\n\nAfter another year of touring (mostly abroad, including a 20,000 seater gig at Buenos Aires Footy Stadium) the dangerous double LP Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me hit the racks, emblazoned with an enlargement of Smith’s now legendary smeared lips on the cover.\n\nIt’s all over the place (as 1 8-track collections are wont to be) – an extended delight for hard-Cure tans, but perhaps best served by its four splendid singles. ‘Why Can t I Be You?’ is delicious big-band nonsense: Catch, a romantic summer night serenade, ‘Just Like Heaven’, The Cure at their most assured, widely appealing and together, and Hot Hot Hot!!! a disco vacation remixed to irresistibly unnecessary proportions on the 12.\n\nIf nothing else, this monstrous catalogue of songs proved The Cure to be more of a united, working, songwriting team than they had ever been before. (Porl wrote three songs on Kiss Me’ and Simon wrote two, which was the first time The Cure had recorded non-Smith compositions\n\nAPRIL 1989\n\nAnd so to bed’ The Cure have surfaced again this month with a new LP Disintegration and the single Lullaby – a concise swoon-song that heralds their eleventh year as Pop’s Great Antidote Whispering Bob is in fine fettle, vocally scampering across this delicate, soft-centred backbeat, accompanied, funnily enough, by a mock-Arabian synth-line!\n\nI think I must have fallen asleep because I woke up with stars shining on my face. (The Outsider).\n\n-The Party just gets better and better. ( Faith )\n\n© Andrew Collings & New Musical Express"
