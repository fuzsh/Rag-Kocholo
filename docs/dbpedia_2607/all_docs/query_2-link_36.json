        "text": "PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y. – The Pace University Department of Athletics has announced that the 1976 football team will be the fourth Pace team recognized with the Team of Distinction Award. The team will be honored as part of the 2017 Pace Athletics Hall of Fame Dinner & Awards ceremony on Thursday, April 27, 2017. The event will be held at Whitby Castle in Rye, N.Y. A cocktail reception will begin at 6 p.m. with dinner and awards to follow at 7 p.m.\n\nThe early years of the Pace University football program saw growth and unparalleled success. Led by legendary Pace Hall of Fame coach George Maier, the 1976 team made its mark in the history books by putting together an outstanding 7-1 overall record, averaging 25 points per game, while allowing a meager 6.5 per game. The Setters registered three shutouts in eight outings that year, including a 27-0 triumph over St. John's, a 28-0 victory versus Marist, and a convincing 21-0 margin against Saint Peter's. Pace also appeared in a Sports Illustrated story about Brooklyn College, which the Setters ran past by a score of 36-14 and went on to capture the Metropolitan Conference Championship.\n\nThe 1976 roster featured 45 team members, including Pace Hall of Fame quarterback Doug Woodward who would go on to play professionally in the NFL, CFL, and USFL, and fellow Hall of Fame member Mike Buonassisi who was a team captain along with Jim Fenty, Jeff Nagy, and Dennis Holland. All totaled, 11 Setters were named All-Conference, five on defense and six on offense, while Buonassisi was selected as Offensive Lineman of the Year, and Maier was recognized as Coach of the Year.\n\nThe 1976 Pace football team will be recognized with this year's Athletics Hall of Fame inductees. The newest members to the Pace Athletics Hall of Fame are Chris Bayer (Baseball '91), Luke Hirten (Men's Lacrosse '00), James Stewart (Football '71), Patricia Thomas-Arscott (Women's Tennis '00) and Kim Zornow Wise (Women's Basketball '89). In addition, Pace Hall of Fame member Gene Westmoreland '65 will be awarded with the Peter X. Finnerty Leadership Award. The Pace Athletics Hall of Fame was started in 1997 with this year's ceremony marking the 16th induction class.\n\nTickets for the event are available for $125 per person. For more information on the 2017 Pace University Athletics Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, please contact Associate Athletics Director Drew Brown at 914-773-3271 or dbrown4@pace.edu.
