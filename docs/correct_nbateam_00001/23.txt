Amar'e Stoudemire was an NBA superstar during his years with the Phoenix Suns in the early 2000s. The player's contribution to the franchise was recognized Saturday night.

The Suns inducted Stoudemire into the organization's Ring of Honor and retired his no. 32 jersey.

"This is truly an out-of-body experience. When I was drafted here in Phoenix, my mission was to be the best player that I could possibly be. As a kid from high school, I was determined to be a top NBA player and also to be a winner - it was my objective. But first of all, I want to thank God.

And the reason for that [is] when I was a young kid growing up in Lake Wales, Florida, there was a lot of adversity that needed to take place for me to be successful. I always say my prayers every night, and I will ask God to be the best player for 400 years," Stoudemire smiled.

Stoudemire played 516 regular season games over eight seasons with the Suns from 2002-2010, averaging 21.4 points on 54.4% shooting, 8.9 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks. He ranks seventh in franchise history in points (11,035), fifth in scoring average (21.4), third in rebounds (4,613), and fifth in blocks (722).

Stoudemire was named the NBA's Rookie of the Year in 2003, beating out Yao Ming in the voting. He's a 6-time All-Star, a 4-time member of the All-NBA Second Team, and a 1-time member of the All-NBA First Team.

Stoudemire became the 11th player whose jersey was retired by the Suns, joining Dick van Arsdale (5), Walter Davis (6), Kevin Johnson (7), Dan Majerle (9), Steve Nash (13), Tom Chambers (24), Alvan Adams (33), Charles Barkley (34), Connie Hawkins (42), and Paul Westphal (44).
