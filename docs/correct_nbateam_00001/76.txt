JERUSALEM (JTA) — Former NBA All-Star Amar’e Stoudemire will return to the Israeli Hapoel Jerusalem basketball team, if he does not secure a position in the NBA.

The team made the announcement Sunday, saying that the all-star’s return was conditioned on him not finding a spot on an NBA team.

Stoudemire played for the New York Knicks and Phoenix Suns among other teams in a 16-year NBA career.

Stoudemire previously played for the team for a year, and left in September 2017, citing a desire to return to the NBA. Israeli media reported at the time that he had a rocky relationship with the Hapoel Jerusalem coach and his son was barred from playing on a local team because he is not an Israeli citizen.

Stoudemire is a partial owner of Hapoel, which he had to suspend in order to play.

During the 2016-2017 season, the team with his help won Israeli championships and reached the semifinals of the EuroCup tournament.
