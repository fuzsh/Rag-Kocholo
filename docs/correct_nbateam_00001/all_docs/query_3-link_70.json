        "text": "The Suns will induct Shawn Marion and Amar’e Stoudemire into their Ring of Honor this season, the team announced in a press release.\n\nDetails of the ceremonies will be worked out once the NBA’s schedule is finalized, but a separate celebration is planned for each player, according to the release. As part of the honor, Marion’s No. 31 and Stoudemire’s No. 32 will join the franchise’s list of retired numbers.\n\nMarion played in Phoenix from 1999-2008, earning All-NBA honors twice and making four All-Star appearances. He averagedÂ 18.4 PPG in 660 regular season games with the Suns and ranks fifth in franchise history in career points, second in both rebounds and steals and third in blocks. He’s also Phoenix’s all-time playoff leader with 706 rebounds.\n\nâThis is amazing to be recognized by the Suns family in this way,â Marion said. âThe fans in Phoenix are one of a kind and this city will always be a part of me. My time with the Suns was special and I am looking forward to being inducted into the Ring of Honor.â\n\nStoudemire was named Rookie of the Year in 2003 and averaged 21.4 PPG in 516 games during his eight seasons with the Suns. A four-time All-NBA selection and five-time All-Star in Phoenix, he’s seventh in franchise history in career points, third in rebounds and fifth in blocks.\n\nâI bleed purple and orange, making this a tremendous honor to be inducted,â Stoudemire said. âMy best and most transformative years came in Phoenix with the Suns. I have so much love for Suns fans and appreciation for the love they have always shown me. I am excited to reconnect with the fanbase in joining the Ring of Honor.â"
