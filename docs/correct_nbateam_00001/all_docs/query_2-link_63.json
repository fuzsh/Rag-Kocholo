        "text": "Amar’e Stoudemire on Tuesday announced that he will retire from the NBA as a player for the Knicks after signing with the New York team in his final contract in the league.\n\nThe six-time All-Star first signed with the Knicks in 2010 and was waived by the team in 2015. He had asked the team’s management permission to retire as a Knick, the NBA said in a news release.\n\n“Although my career has taken me to other places around the country, my heart had always remained in the Big Apple,” Stoudemire, 33, said in a statement. “Once a Knick, always a Knick.”\n\nThe power forward averaged 18.9 points and 7.8 rebounds in 846 career games he played in 14 NBA seasons for Phoenix, New York, Dallas and Miami."
