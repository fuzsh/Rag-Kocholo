        "text": "Former NBA star Amar'e Stoudemire offered a passionate, uncensored response to activists and politicians who have not condemned Hamas' attack on Israel as part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nHamas, a terrorist group, launched a surprise attack on Israel on last weekend that has killed at least 900 civilians.\n\n\"I woke up this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel, that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. That’s some coward (bleep) Stoudemire, who played four-plus seasons with the New York Knicks (2010-15), said on Instagram. \"For all y’all Black Lives Matter (supporters) ain’t saying nothing, ‘Well let me figure out exactly what’s happening before saying anything.’ (Bleep) you.\"\n\nStoudemire has held a special connection with Israel, one that began to emerge toward the end of his professional basketball career. After ending his 14-year NBA career on a one-day contract as a Knick in 2016 (following brief excursions with Dallas and Miami), Stoudemire played for Hapoel Jerusalem and Maccabi Tel Aviv of the Israeli Basketball Premier League. He held a major ownership stake in the former and helped the team to a championship in 2017.\n\n\"All you politicians who have something to say on the contrary, I see you. (Bleep) you,\" Stoudemire continued. \"All you Black Lives Matter people who always have something to say and always supported everything else and you quiet now, (bleep) you too. (Israel) is the only place in the world I can go and study Torah and eat Kosher food. Only place in the world. Some coward (bleep) dog and all y’all support it. (Bleep) you.\"\n\nOn a personal level, Stoudemire was connected to the Black Hebrew Israelite movement through his mother, Carrie, and later converted to Judaism in 2020 one year after he received Israeli citizenship.\n\nStoudemire's last NBA activities came with the Brooklyn Nets, where he served as a player development assistant for two seasons (2020-22)."
