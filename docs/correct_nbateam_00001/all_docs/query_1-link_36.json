        "text": "NBA All-Star Amare Stoudemire is a well-respected professional basketball player who has not only left his mark on the game, but also on the community through his award-winning outreach. Amare currently runs the Amare Stoudemire Foundation, a youth outreach program designed to creatively inspire and help at-risk youth to succeed with the goal of eradicating poverty through education. By providing education, support, supplies, tools and donations, the Amare Stoudemire Foundation helps each child thrive and achieve goals well beyond even their own expectations. Amare recently partnered with Scholastic to release a series of childrens books with the goal of turning more kids into readers.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election Stoudemire partnered with Rock the Vote to raise participation in the election by allowing people to register to vote directly from his website. In 2012, Stoudemire worked closely with the Superstorm Sandy Relief Fund to raise money for people whose lives were affected by the natural disaster.\n\nDuring the 2004-05 season Stoudemire teamed up with point guard Steve Nashto lead the Suns to a 62-20 record. Averaging 26 points per game that year and achieving a new career high of 50 points, he was selected to his first All-Star Game.\n\nMore--- In 2011, he played in the NBA All-Star Game, the first Knicks player to do so since Patrick Ewing in 1992. And in 2012, he and the Knicks went to the first round of the playoffs. During the season, he had averaged 17.5 points per game and 7.8 rebounds.\n\nSince entering the NBA in 2002, Amare Stoudemire has been active in the Phoenix and worldwide community. In 2003, Amar'e started the Each One Teach One Foundation and funded his first AAU Team, Team STAT. Later that year, he was the winner of NBA Week on \"Wheel of Fortune,\" donating his winnings to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Phoenix.\n\nIn November 2008, Stoudemire received the NBAs Community Assist Award, for his work with his Each 1, Teach 1 Foundation, and its efforts to provide safe drinking water in Sierra Leone by funding the building of water wells in impoverished villages. Stoudemire visited the country in the summer of 2008, making visits to water well sites and meeting with President Ernest Bai Koroma and the rest of the cabinet."
