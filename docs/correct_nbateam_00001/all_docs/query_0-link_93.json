        "text": "By Eurohoops Team/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nThe Phoenix Suns decided to retire jerseys 31 and 32, corresponding to Shawn Marion and Amar’e Stoudemire, respectively.\n\nThe players will enter the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor during the next season, the team announced Wednesday. The jersey retirement ceremony adds to the recognition of their overall contributions to the franchise based in Arizona.\n\nPer the press release: “The Phoenix Suns today announced that the team will induct legends Shawn Marion and Amar’e Stoudemire into the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor during the 2023-24 NBA season. Marion and Stoudemire will receive the franchise’s highest honor bestowed to individuals who have made an enduring impact on the organization, community and Suns fans.\n\n“Shawn and Amar’e are two of the very best to ever wear a Phoenix Suns uniform,” said Mat Ishbia, owner of the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury. “Shawn changed the game with his elite versatility and Amar’e was one of the most electrifying players the league has ever seen. Shawn and Amar’e helped define the Suns and inspired generations of fans, and our Suns family is incomplete without them in the Ring of Honor.\n\n“As we embark on the new era of Suns basketball it is a priority that we remain connected to our storied history. We are excited to celebrate Shawn and Amar’e and properly recognize their incredible contributions and achievements.”\n\nFor their official induction into the Ring of Honor, Marion and Stoudemire will each have their own night of celebration at a Suns home game. The dates of the Ring of Honor ceremonies will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n“This is amazing to be recognized by the Suns family in this way,” said Marion. “The fans in Phoenix are one-of-a-kind and this city will always be a part of me. My time with the Suns was special and I am looking forward to being inducted into the Ring of Honor.”\n\nMarion played 660 regular season games over nine seasons with the Suns from 1999-2008, averaging 18.4 points on 48.1% shooting, 10.0 rebounds, 1.9 steals and 1.4 blocks. He ranks fifth in franchise history in points (12,134), second in rebounds (6,616), second in steals (1,245) and third in blocks (894). Marion is the team’s all-time playoff leader with 706 postseason rebounds during his Suns career. Nicknamed “The Matrix,” he twice earned All-NBA honors and was a four-time All-Star selection while with the Suns.\n\n“I bleed purple and orange, making this a tremendous honor to be inducted,” said Stoudemire. “My best and most transformative years came in Phoenix with the Suns. I have so much love for Suns fans and appreciation for the love they have always shown me. I am excited to reconnect with the fanbase in joining the Ring of Honor.”\n\nStoudemire played 516 regular season games over eight seasons with the Suns from 2002-2010, averaging 21.4 points on 54.4% shooting, 8.9 rebounds and 1.4 blocks. He ranks seventh in franchise history in points (11,035), fifth in scoring average (21.4), third in rebounds (4,613) and fifth in blocks (722). Nicknamed “S.T.A.T.,” Stoudemire was named All-NBA four times, including to the First Team in 2006-07, was a five-time All-Star selection and the 2002-03 NBA Rookie of the Year during his time with the Suns.\n\nMarion, No. 31, and Stoudemire, No. 32, will have their uniform numbers officially retired as part of their induction to the Ring of Honor, joining Alvan Adams (33), Charles Barkley (34), Tom Chambers (24), Walter Davis (6), Connie Hawkins (42), Kevin Johnson (7), Dan Majerle (9), Steve Nash (13), Dick Van Arsdale (5) and Paul Westphal (44) as the Suns’ retired numbers. Marion and Stoudemire will become the 16th and 17th Suns inducted to the Ring of Honor, joining the ten previously mentioned players as well as Jerry Colangelo, Cotton Fitzsimmons, John MacLeod, Al McCoy and Joe Proski.\n\nAs part of the new era of Suns basketball, the organization will unveil a reimagined Ring of Honor this season. Further details will be announced later this month."
