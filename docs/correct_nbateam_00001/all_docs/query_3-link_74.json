        "text": "[jwplayer nnvOGlq0-z6KDnl0B]\n\nFormer NBA All-Star Amar’e Stoudemire last played in the league in 2015-16 with the Miami Heat where he averaged 5.2 points and 4.3 rebounds before announcing his retirement. After a few seasons out of the league, he’s ready to give it another shot.\n\nHe recently held a workout in Las Vegas where 15 teams were in attendance and the Golden State Warriors were one of those teams. The Warriors are looking for more big man depth and a guy like Stoudemire could fill in for that role.\n\nHe believes he can still offer a lot to a team:\n\n“A lot of the teams have a lot of young players and a lot of players that can learn how to train, how to become professionals and how to become great basketball players. And leadership goes a long way with teams in order to get from a playoff team to a contending championship team,” he said. “From that standpoint, I have a lot to offer. And also as a basketball player, I still have a lot of game left. I can help a team in any way they need.”\n\nStoudemire averaged 21.4 points and 8.9 rebounds in eight seasons with the Phoenix Suns where he made the All-Star team five times during his time in the desert. If he can be anything close to his former self, the Warriors will be getting a solid player if they were to sign him."
