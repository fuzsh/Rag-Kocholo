        "text": "Former Suns F Amar'e Stoudemire had his No. 32 retired during a Ring Of Honor ceremony at halftime of the Suns-Rockets game on Saturday. Stoudemire was joined by his family, Suns owner Mat Ishbia, longtime Suns broadcaster Tom Leander, former Suns coach Alvin Gentry and some of his former teammates as his jersey was “hoisted alongside the 11 other former players” (ARIZONA REPUBLIC, 3/2).\n\nBefore former Flames G Miikka Kiprusoff's No. 34 was raised to the rafters at the Saddledome, he spoke for six minutes -- being “sincere and thankful and funny.” He marked this special occasion by \"donating $34,000 to Calgary Minor Hockey\" (CALGARY HERALD, 3/2)."
