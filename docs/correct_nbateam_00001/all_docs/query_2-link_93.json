        "text": "NEW YORK, Aug. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Hapoel Jerusalem Basketball Club announced today that six-time NBA All-Star Amar'e Stoudemire is joining the team on a two-year deal. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStoudemire is a 14 year NBA veteran who was drafted by the Phoenix Suns with the ninth pick of the 2002 NBA draft, going on to play eight seasons for the team. In 2010, he signed with the New York Knicks and then played half a season with the Dallas Mavericks before ending his NBA career with the Miami Heat. Over his career, Stoudemire averaged nearly 19 points and 8 rebounds per game. He was one of the most dominant power forwards of his era and from 2004 – 2010 formed one of the most successful pick-and-roll tandems in the NBA with Suns teammate Steve Nash.\n\n\"We are thrilled to have a player of Amar'e's caliber join our team, solidifying our place among the top echelon of Israeli and European basketball,\" said Dr. Ori Allon, President and majority owner of Hapoel Jerusalem. \"More importantly, bringing Amar'e to Jerusalem raises the profile of the entire Israeli Basketball League, and we hope that his joining our team will lead to increased interest in our league from basketball fans around the world as well as talented international players.\"\n\nIn July 2013, Allon led an ownership group – including Stoudemire – in the acquisition of Hapoel Jerusalem. As part of his contract with Hapoel Jerusalem, Stoudemire will sell his shares in the club to Allon. Allon is a successful entrepreneur and is currently the Founder and Executive Chairman of Compass, a national real estate technology platform. Prior to founding Compass, Allon founded Orion, which was acquired by Google, and then founded Julpan, which was acquired by Twitter.\n\n\"I am looking forward to playing for Hapoel Jerusalem and helping the team compete for titles,\" said Stoudemire. \"My family and I are excited to start a new journey in Israel, a country I have grown to love.\"\n\nCurrently led by coach Simone Pianigiani, Hapoel Jerusalem is one of the oldest and most successful teams in the Israeli Basketball League. The club has won numerous Israeli State and League Cups, as well as one Israeli Championship and one EuroCup title.\n\n\"What impressed me most when talking to Amar'e was his deep desire to come play for Hapoel Jerusalem,\" said Pianigiani. \"His experience will be a great asset to our team. I'm confident he will have a positive impact on our season, and I look forward to it.\"\n\nAbout Hapoel Jerusalem\n\nHapoel Jerusalem Basketball Club was founded in 1943 and has played in the Israeli Basketball League's top division since 1955. The team has won four Israeli State Cups, three Israeli League Cups, one Israeli Championship and one EuroCup Championship, making it one of Israel's most successful basketball clubs.
