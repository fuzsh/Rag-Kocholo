        "text": "PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Suns are welcoming the newest member of the franchise's ring of honor tonight.\n\nAmar'e Stoudemire is getting his number 32 jersey retired and a banner up in the rafters during halftime of tonight's game against the Houston Rockets.\n\nStoudemire was an integral part of Suns teams that changed the way basketball was played and enjoyed much success with the franchise that drafted him - suiting up for the Suns from 2002-10.\n\nBut what are the best moments Stoudemire provided in his eight seasons with Phoenix?\n\n2003: Rookie of the Year\n\nStoudemire was picked with the ninth overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft straight out of high school.\n\nHe exceeded expectations as a rookie - averaging 13.5 PPG and 8.8 RPG.\n\nHe also beat out highly touted first overall pick Yao Ming as well as Caron Butler for rookie of the year.\n\nThe Stoudemire and Stephon Marbury-led squad made the playoffs in a surprise appearance - although they fell to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in six games.\n\n2005: Revolutionizing the Game\n\nStoudemire experienced a career-best season in which he scored a career-high 50 points and was selected to his first all-star game en route to a 62-win season.\n\nThis breakout coincided with the arrivals of Mike D'Antoni and Steve Nash - the brand of ball Phoenix played during the next few seasons got Stoudemire to receive comparisons to Karl Malone in the process.\n\nThe Suns eventually lost to the Spurs in the Western Conference Finals in five games - despite STAT averaging 37 points per game during the series.\n\nThe instrumental role he played in changing the way basketball is played today is memorable in basketball history at large, but is particularly special to an entire generation of Suns fans that grew up during the era.\n\n2007: All-NBA First Team Selection\n\nStoudemire came back in the 2006-07 season from knee surgery that cost him nearly all of the previous season - he was rewarded with an All-NBA first team selection which was the only honor of his career.\n\nStoudemire was also instrumental in another playoff run that fell short - and arguably was cut short by NBA commissioner David Stern decided to suspend Stoudemire and teammate Boris Diaw for Game 5 of the Suns' semifinal series against the Spurs yet again.\n\n2010: Final Run as a Sun\n\nThe 2010 season was a special one - as the Suns exceeded all expectations on the way to a 54-win season.\n\nThe Suns eventually lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games in the Western Conference Finals - and this was eventually the end of the relationship between the two sides for the next decade-plus, as STAT left for the New York Knicks in the summer of 2010.\n\nTonight should be a night to not only remember the Suns legend, but celebrate him as well.\n\nStoudemire is one of the greatest players in franchise history - and now his number 32 will be immortalized in franchise history."
