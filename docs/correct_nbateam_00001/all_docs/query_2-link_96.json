        "text": "NEW YORK - Amar’e Stoudemire was back at Madison Square Garden, maybe a little too familiar sight as he was in street clothes on the sidelines.\n\nStoudemire was the first star to join the Knicks makeover - the makeover before the Phil Jackson era began - and had thought about lighting the arena up. In his return after turns in Dallas, Miami and Israel before giving up the game this year, he was here to count down the lighting on the scoreboard of a virtual menorah for the first day of Hannukah.\n\n“The Knicks called me, wanted me to come out for today’s game,” Stoudemire said. “I was eager to do it, excited about it. I haven’t been back in a while, especially as a fan. It feels a little different. I’m excited about it. It’s going to be good to watch these guys tonight.\n\n“I miss New York itself like you wouldn’t believe. As far as playing I haven’t started missing the game yet. I don’t have the itch to want to play. I don’t really miss playing at the moment. I feel like I’m very content with the way I’m retired. I think that’s allowing me to be with OK with not playing.”\n\nStoudemire in the past has bemoaned the way the Knicks never achieved what he had hoped for when he arrived and then teamed up with Carmelo Anthony. He was bought out by the Knicks in Phil Jackson’s first year, trying to chase a championship ring that he never got in the NBA.\n\n“I never did understand what was going to happen once I left so I just stayed out of it,” Stoudemire said. “I was focused on what trying to figure out what I was going to do as far as my career. My goal was to win a championship. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get that done in the NBA. But I got a championship (in Israel). So I was able to accomplish all my goals as a basketball player and I feel very satisfied about that.”\n\nStoudemire spent a year in Israel, where he owns a professional team, and enjoyed the experience - in different ways than his NBA career.\n\nKID STUFF: Rookies Knicks Frank Ntilikina, Lonzo Ball meet at MSG\n\nCOMEBACK: Knicks' Jarrett Jack enjoying unexpected role\n\n“It was amazing,” he said. “I was a rookie all over again. Didn’t know what to expect. Didn’t know about the language barrier. We took buses to certain games and we flew commercial flights, all coach, but I was able to upgrade. It was great because we went to so many remote countries in Europe to play. A lot of fans that watched me on TV and seen me play over the years got a chance to see me in person. The energy was truly amazing. It was a great experience.”\n\nHe is now making his home in Miami and said that he might consider a front office or coaching role down the line.\n\n“I’m coaching my son’s 6th grade team,” he said with a laugh. “It’s going to be a heck of an experience. I’ve never coached before, I have no idea how to draw up plays but I’m going to figure it out. I don’t know what the future holds. There may be other opportunities down the line to broadcast, or front office work or something like that. As of right now, just taking it easy.”\n\nBRIEFS: Odell Beckham Jr., Davis Webb and Evan Engram were among a contingent of Giants players on celebrity row Tuesday, along with Lakers president Magic Johnson and Lavar Ball and his sons, LaMelo, LeAngelo.\n\nEmail: popper@northjersey.com"
