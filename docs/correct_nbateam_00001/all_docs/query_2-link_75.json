        "text": "NHL:\n\nOn the ice, the Rangers beat the Islanders 6-5, Calgary bested Boston in overtime 4-3, Montreal blanked Detroit 2-0, Winnipeg edged Edmonton in a shootout 5-4, Colorado defeated Arizona 5-2, Vancouver topped Minnesota 3-2, Carolina doubled up Ottawa 6-3, and it was Los Angeles over Tampa Bay 3-2.\n\nFor the first time since they left Lake Placid with their Olympic gold medals, all 19 surviving members of the 1980 USA Hockey Team are returning to relive their \"Miracle on Ice\" moment.\n\nGroups of players have gathered in Lake Placid or other parts of the country over the last 35 years. But the Olympic Regional Development Authority says the anniversary celebration Saturday will be the first time the entire squad will be together in the host village of 1980 Winter Games.\n\nThe event will be in the arena where the team beat the odds and defeated the Soviet Union 4-3.\n\nThe evening will conclude with the raising of fallen teammate Bob Suter's jersey to the rafters. Suter is the first member of the team to die, suffering a heart attack last September at age 57.\n\nNBA:\n\nAmar'e Stoudemire wasted no time finding a new team.\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the talks tells The Associated Press the forward has agreed to sign with the Dallas Mavericks after taking a buyout from the Knicks. The veteran forward can't make his verbal commitment official until he clears waivers on Wednesday.\n\nThe 32-year-old Stoudemire was waived Monday after requesting the Knicks buy out the remainder of his contract that was set to expire after this season.\n\nNFL:\n\nThe company that is moving quickly on a plan to build a stadium that could host a Southern California NFL team has given more than $118,000 in campaign contributions to officials in the city where it would be located.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times is reporting that campaign finance forms show most of the money went to Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts Jr., a major supporter of the stadium plan. The donations came during four different campaigns starting in 2006.\n\nMLB:\n\nFormer American League MVP Jason Giambi has announced his retirement after 20 major league seasons. Giambi made the announcement in a statement that was first sent to the New York Daily News.\n\nHe ends his career as one of 20 players in history with at least 400 home runs, 1,400 RBIs, 1,200 runs and 1,300 walks. The 44-year-old played for Oakland, the New York Yankees, Colorado and Cleveland.\n\nThe Yankees are retiring the uniform numbers of three members from their championship clubs of the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nThe team will honor Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, and Bernie Williams with plaques in Monument Park this season, along with Willie Randolph. The quartet will raise the Yankees' total of retired numbers to 20.\n\nFormer Dodger hospitalized\n\nFormer Dodgers third baseman Pedro Guerrero has been hospitalized in the Dominican Republic with bleeding on the brain. However, a friend says the 1981 World Series co-MVP appears to be in good spirits and is speaking with people in the hospital.\n\nThe 58-year-old Guerrero was in the intensive care unit and is being treated by a neurosurgeon while undergoing further testing.\n\nNCAA:\n\nThe West Virginia men's basketball program has its first 20-win season in four years following a mild upset against Kansas.\n\nJuwan Staten's layup with four seconds left gave the 23rd-rated Mountaineers a 62-61 triumph over the eighth-ranked Jayhawks. It was Staten's first field goal over the final eight minutes after he had gone to the bench with leg cramps. He finished with 20 points and helped West Virginia hold Kansas scoreless over the final 2:13.\n\nAlso in top-15 men's basketball, second-ranked Virginia and No. 6 Villanova both remain on pace to record their best regular season ever.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon scored 18 points and the Cavaliers rode an early 18-3 run to a 61-49 triumph over Pittsburgh. Anthony Gill added 12 points for Virginia, which scored eight straight late in the game to ice the victory.\n\nThe Cavaliers improved to 24-1 and tied the best start in school history, first accomplished in the 1981-82 season.\n\nThe Wildcats rolled to an 80-54 rout of Seton Hall behind Darrun Hilliard's 18 points. Daniel Ochefu had 11 points and 12 rebounds as Villanova picked up its seventh straight win and improved to 24-2.\n\nThe Wildcats allowed just 32 percent shooting and avenged last month's loss to the Pirates.\n\nAnd Butler pulled out a thriller on the road as Roosevelt Jones sank the winning layup with 1.9 seconds left to give the 19th-ranked Bulldogs a 58-56 triumph at Creighton. Kellen Dunham scored 19 points and Jones added 18 to help Butler avoid a loss to the worst team in the Big East.\n\nLights to dim for late UNLV legend\n\nSeveral Strip casinos have agreed to dim their bulbs at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday for a few minutes in honor of deceased University of Nevada, Las Vegas basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian.\n\nThe gesture will take place following a UNLV basketball home game.\n\nTarkanian is credited with elevating Las Vegas to the national stage for college basketball. He died Feb. 11 at age 84.\n\nCYCLING:\n\nAn arbitration panel has ordered Lance Armstrong and his defunct team management company to pay $10 million in a fraud dispute with a promotions company.\n\nDallas-based SCA Promotions sued after it paid Armstrong and Tailwind Sports Corp. $12 million in bonuses during Armstrong's cycling career, when he won seven Tour de France titles. Those victories were stripped after Armstrong and his U.S. Postal Service teams were found to have used banned performance-enhancing drugs."
