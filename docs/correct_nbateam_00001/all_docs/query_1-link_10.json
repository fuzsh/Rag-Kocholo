        "text": "NBA All-Star Amar’e Stoudemire is a well-respected professional basketball player who has not only left his mark on the game, but also on the community through his award-winning outreach. Amar’e currently runs the Amar’e and Alexis Stoudemire Foundation, a youth outreach program designed to creatively inspire and help at-risk youth to succeed with the goal of eradicating poverty through education. By providing education, support, supplies, tools and donations, the Amar’e and Alexis Stoudemire Foundation helps each child thrive and achieve goals well beyond even their own expectations. Amar’e recently partnered with Scholastic to release a series of children’s books with the goal of turning more kids into readers.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election Stoudemire partnered with Rock the Vote to raise participation in the election by allowing people to register to vote directly from his website. In 2012, Stoudemire worked closely with the Superstorm Sandy Relief Fund to raise money for people whose lives were affected by the natural disaster.\n\nIn February 2015, the Amar’e and Alexis Stoudemire Foundation unveiled a brand new basketball court, The Amar’e Stoudemire Court, in Lake Wales, Florida.\n\nOn the 24th of January, 2016 Amar’e and acclaimed artist Hebru Brantly teamed up for a live art installation at Little Black Pearl Art & Design Center aimed at inspiring children to engage in the arts."
