        "text": "PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) — Phoenix Suns superstar Devin Booker was named to the Western Conference All-Star team on Thursday for the fourth time in the past five seasons.\n\nBooker becomes just the eighth player in Suns history to earn at least four All-Star selections with the team, joining Steve Nash (6), Walter Davis (6), Amar’e Stoudemire (5), Shawn Marion (4), Charles Barkley (4), Paul Westphal (4) and Connie Hawkins (4).\n\nThe reserves were announced and Book made the list. He has career-highs in points per game (28.3), shooting percentage (50.2%), assists per game (7.3), 3-point shooting percentage (38.8%) and true shooting percentage (61.8%). His ppg is fifth-highest in the NBA. He’s averaging 4.9 rebounds per game, nearly a career-high. Booker was just named the Western Conference Player of the Month for January, where he averaged 30 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.3 assists per game and 4.4 rebounds per game.\n\nLeBron James from the Los Angeles Lakers, Nikola Jokic from the Denver Nuggets, Booker’s teammate Kevin Durant, Dallas’ Luka Doncic, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander from Oklahoma City were all voted as All-Star Game starters last month. Booker finished 8th. Booker and Durant being All-Star selections marks the 25th time the Suns have had multiple All-Stars.\n\nAlong with Booker, Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Edwards from the Timberwolves, Lakers’ Anthony Davis, Warriors’ Steph Curry, Clippers’ Paul George and Karl-Anthony Towns were all named as Western Conference All-Star reserves. NBA All-Star Game reserves are determined by voting from the 30 NBA head coaches, voting for two guards, three frontcourt players and two players at any position in their respective conferences.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
