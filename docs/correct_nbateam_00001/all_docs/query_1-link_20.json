        "text": "Amar’e Stoudemire knows how to make an impact on the court. A six-time NBA All-Star and winner of the Rookie of the Year Award, Amar’e joined the New York Knicks in 2010 and immediately helped lead the team to their first playoff appearance in seven years. He knows how to make an impact off the court, too. Stoudemire created the Amar’e Stoudemire Foundation to inspire and help at-risk youth, and in 2008 he was given the NBA’s Community Assist Award for his work providing safe drinking water in Sierra Leone. In Amar’e Stoudemire, readers will follow this NBA superstar’s basketball career and discover how he has made a difference in people’s lives both on and off the court. Large, full-color action photos and engaging text will keep readers turning the pages for more.\n\nStoudemire fits neatly into the Basketball Heroes Making a Difference series. His good works match his excellent on-court performance. Sandler begins with the power forward leading the New York Knicks to an eighth straight victory in 2010. The section ends with Stoudemire telling his team, “The sky’s the limit,” which turns out to be the same words his father said to him before he died, when Stoudemire was just 12. This phrase runs through the book (perhaps a bit too often), but that doesn’t distract much from the inspiring story of a boy who came from a rough neighborhood, whose family was often in trouble with the law, and who eschewed college to jump into the NBA. But Stoudemire has not forgotten his troubled roots and has started charities in Phoenix and New York, providing school supplies and educational opportunities. He has also reached out to Africa with a charity that helps with basic necessities such as wells for unpolluted water. The bright, eye-catching design provides a fine background for dynamic photos.\n\nStoudemire fits neatly into the Basketball Heroes Making a Difference series.
