        "text": "The New York Knicks reportedly will not sign and bring back forward Amar’e Stoudemire, who’s trying to make an NBA comeback.\n\nThis week, former NBA forward Amar’e Stoudemire held a workout in Las Vegas for 15 NBA teams. Stoudemire is trying to make a comeback when it comes to the Association. The New York Knicks were of the teams that were present at the workout.\n\nHowever, Marc Berman of the New York Post reports the Knicks will not be signing Stoudemire to a contract. There was some debate that maybe Stoudemire could be a mentor for the young guys on the roster such as RJ Barrett, Kevin Knox, and Frank Ntilikina.\n\nStoudemire last played for the Knicks in 2015 and hasn’t been in the NBA since 2016 when he was a member of the Miami Heat. He was a member of four teams, originally the Phoenix Suns, then the Knicks, then the Dallas Mavericks before finally wrapping up his career with the Heat.\n\nHe’s a six-time All-Star, having also won the Rookie of the Year award in 2003. In his NBA career, Stoudemire averaged 18.9 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 1.2 assists on 53.7% shooting from the field and 23.6% behind the arc.\n\nStoudemire recently played in the BIG3 league and mentioned how his body “feels amazing” to MSG150.\n\n“A lot of the teams have a lot of young players and a lot of players that can learn how to train, how to become professionals and how to become great basketball players,” Stoudemire said. “And leadership goes a long way with teams in order to get from a playoff team to a contending championship team. From that standpoint, I have a lot to offer. And also as a basketball player, I still have a lot of game left. I can help a team in any way they need.”"
