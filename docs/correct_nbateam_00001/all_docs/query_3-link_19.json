        "text": "Lynne Sladky/Associated Press\n\nAmar'e Stoudemire did not return to form with the Miami Heat last season, which left his future as a free agent this summer unclear. After STAT announced his retirement from the NBA on Tuesday, basketball reporter David Pick revealed Sunday that Stoudemire will play for Hapoel Jerusalem, a team he co-owns.\n\nMarc Stein of ESPN later confirmed the news via \"basketball officials in Israel,\" who said they expect Stoudemire to announce the move on Monday.\n\nStein reported on July 26 that Stoudemire \"has lucrative interest from China, sources say, or could play in Israel for the team [Hapoel Jerusalem] he co-owns.\" Stein added that Stoudemire \"plans to take some time before deciding if he intends to play pro basketball abroad in the coming season or stay put.\"\n\nAll the injuries Stoudemire suffered during his career rendered him a bench player over his final four seasons in the NBA. For the Heat, he averaged a career-low 14.7 minutes, 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds per game in 52 contests."
