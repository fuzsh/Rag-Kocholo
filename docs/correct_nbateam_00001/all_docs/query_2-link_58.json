        "text": "Three years ago, Amar’e Stoudemire discovered that he’s Jewish. While in Israel this week, president Shimon Peres invited STAT to hoop for their national team. Per the AP: “Shimon Peres met with Stoudemire on Thursday to discuss the player’s charity efforts. Stoudemire, who says he has ‘Hebrew roots,’ has traveled to Israel before and Peres urged him to help the national team. The six-time NBA All-Star already has significant ties to Israeli basketball. Last month, he joined a group looking to buy Hapoel Jerusalem, a team in Israel’s top league. Stoudemire is in Israel to coach the Canadian basketball team at the Maccabiah Games, a competition for Jewish athletes.”"
