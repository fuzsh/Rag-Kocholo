        "text": "Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nThe playoffs aren't just where reps are made. Contracts are made there, too.\n\nJust ask Jerome James.\n\nGuys like LeBron James and Dwyane Wade will get their greenbacks whether their teams soar (Cleveland) or stink (Miami). With Amare Stoudmemire, it's not such a given.\n\nMaybe that's because he hasn't been a given during his career. Until the second half of this season, it was almost commonplace to see 25 and 12 one night, followed up by 15 and six the next.\n\nStoudemire's stats during the Suns' series against Portland won't wow anyone, but if you've watched the games, you've seen the reason behind the regression in his numbers.\n\nPortland is swarming Stoudemire whenever he catches the ball below the free-throw line, forcing him to pass out of the double/triple team.\n\nHis willingness to do so has been revolutionary; in years past, Amare barreled through opposing defenses with the strength and foresight of an enraged elephant.\n\nHe's learned, and that's what has whispers of max money coming his way, and not in an incredulous tone, either.\n\nAmare's learned how to live in harmony with his teammates. He picks up their dinner tabs, socializes with them, and encourages them both on and off the court.\n\nHis comments to the press are no longer attention-seeking, but truth-telling. Instead of giving himself nicknames, he gives himself and the team honest goals to work towards.\n\nAll of this has been great, but again, it's only one half of one season out of eight. Is this fool's gold orchestrated by Amare and/or his agent in hopes of obtaining real gold?\n\nSince no one will know that until the aftermath of his next big contract, the best evaluation is his postseason performance. Others will look at Stoudemire as an individual. Phoenix is unique, in that they'll want to see how far the team goes.\n\nStoudemire and Nash have been together for half a decade now. If they, with an actual bench and a semblance of defense, can't get out of the West this year, will Suns' management think it can happen in the future, as Nash's skills decline even more?\n\nPhoenix's brass has a tendency to give themselves second, third, and fourth chances by clinging to mitigating circumstances...A.K.A. \"What if\" clauses.\n\nWhat if...Joe Johnson hadn't busted his eye socket in '05?\n\nWhat if...Stoudemire hadn't undergone microfracture surgery before the 2005-06 season?\n\nWhat if...Stoudemire wasn't suspended for Game 5 in the '07 semifinals?\n\nWhat if...they hadn't traded for Shaq in the middle of 2007-08 season despite having the best record in the West at the time?\n\nWhat if...Stoudemire hadn't needed eye surgery right as Gentry took over the reigns and unleashed the Suns' offense?\n\nThe Suns might convince themselves of another \"what if\" this season: what if Robin Lopez hadn't suffered back problems right before the playoffs? It'll be tantalizing to think of what the Suns could have done with a healthy Lopez to take pressure off Stoudemire on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor.\n\nIf that happens, the Suns will try to hang on to Amare for one, two, at most three years, just to see what their real, un-what-if-affected potential is.\n\nAll of that could become a moot point...if Stoudemire helps the Suns to at least the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThink about it. What team wouldn't offer Stoudemire max money after helping the Suns overachieve to that degree?\n\nInstead of waiting for the best offer, Amare could treat his suitors like a snobbish, fat, rich guy at a buffet line, taking his time and making everyone else wait for him to decide.\n\nIf Phoenix makes the Western Finals, Phoenix will feel nothing short of compelled to offer Stoudemire the max, because they know they can't get anything close to value, especially with only $8 million in cap space if he leaves for nothing.\n\nIf the Suns fall short, if they implode against Portland or prove to be inferior to the Spurs/Mavericks, questions will resurface about Stoudemire's true worth.\n\nIs he really a franchise player if he can't lead a team with guys like Steve Nash, Joe Johnson, Shawn Marion, or Jason Richardson out of his conference?\n\nIf that happens, Suns' owner Robert Sarver (A.K.A. Light Spending Sarve) will probably offer what he thinks is fair value, and what Amare will see as a low-balled offer.\n\nAnother team will swoop in, offer the max (deserved or not), and take Stoudemire and his hurt feelings away. Phoenix will say it wasn't worth keeping a guy who could only take them so far, that they've been there, done that and it's time for a fresh start."
