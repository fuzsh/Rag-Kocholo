        "text": "Being a New York Knick is awesome.\n\nI used to write \"NBA\" on the wall when I was seven, eight years old, get in trouble for it, with a crayon.\n\nI had a passion for basketball when I was a baby, and it never stopped.\n\nMy cousin played basketball.\n\nMy brother played basketball.\n\nMy uncles played basketball, football.\n\nBaseball was another sport that my family played.\n\nMy father was, you know, a hardworking man.\n\nHe was a churchgoing man.\n\nHe took us all to church every Sunday.\n\nAnd he passed away when I was 12 years old.\n\nAnd that was a tough time for me, to kind of get over that, that hump of not having him around My mom was on the streets.\n\nShe was hustling.\n\nWe traveled around a lot.\n\nWhen she had to, you know, run from the police, I mean, we moved from Florida to New York to Atlanta, back to Florida, from living inside a shelter to not really having a place to stay.\n\nThen my younger brother was right there with me, so I had to make sure he was straight, because he watched every move that I'd make, and he implements what I do.\n\nSo I think that helped me also to remain focus on the youth, because I had that mindset when I was even, you know, ten, 11, 12 years old.\n\nYeah, I was playing basketball as long as I can remember, on the playgrounds.\n\nAnd as I got older, and I realized I'm pretty good at it, and then I started to understand, \"You know what?\n\n\"This is going to get us out of the hood.\n\nThis is going to get us out of poverty.\"\n\nI told all my friends I was going to get drafted out of high school.\n\nI wrote it down on the walls, wrote it down on the bleachers.\n\nI had a goal in mind, and I was determined to make that happen.\n\nAnd I did.\n\nIt was one of those surreal, surreal moments.\n\nBecause I went from a high school player overcoming so many obstacles during my high school career, and then getting drafted into the NBA.\n\nI was at an all-time high at that point.\n\nAnd the first thing I did was give my mom a hug and a kiss.\n\nAnd I felt like I finally made it, accomplished my goal as an 18-year-old.\n\nMy mother and I have an awesome relationship.\n\nI talk to her about every other day.\n\nIf it was up to her, I'd talk to her every hour.\n\nShe calls me all the time.\n\nShe does a lot of great things right now, too, so she takes her story, and what she'd been through, and teaches young girls that are in her similar situations how to make the right decisions growing up as well.\n\nI got involved with writing children's books because reading is something that I think is very, ver important.\n\nEspecially for young boys in poverty.\n\nSo I figure if I write a book that has my slang words, has a few of my personal young stories, then that may give the youth to understand, \"Well, reading \"is not that bad, actually.\n\n\"I read that book, and it was fun to read that.\n\nNow I want to read another one.\"\n\nMy daughter, she's a great reader.\n\nShe loves to read, you know what I mean?\n\nSo when a word that comes up that I fumble over, and she reads it, you know, cleanly, I'm like, \"Wait a second.\"\n\nMy kids teach me something every day.\n\nMy son, I was introducing the game of chess to him.\n\nAnd we started playing, and he made a move on me, I was like, \"Hold on a second, wait a minute.\n\n\"Let me take you a little bit more seriousl on the chess board right now.\"\n\nMy children are pretty smart.\n\nI'm a proud father at this point."
