The report says that Stoudemire punched the girl and slapped her hard enough to draw blood, the outlet reported.\n\n\"I observed blood stains on the victim's sweater and sweatpants,\" the arrest report says according to The Herald. \"The mother of the victim showed me the photo she received from her daughter, which shows the victim crying and blood running down her face.\"\n\nThe Miami Dade Police Department did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on Sunday.\n\nThis is a developing story."
