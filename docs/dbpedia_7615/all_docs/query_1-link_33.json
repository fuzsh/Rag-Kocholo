As his proper name, Hans Muller, was quite common, he added the name of the Swiss village of Einigen to it.\n\nHe is known for his screenplay for The White Horse Inn (Im weisen Rosl, 1930), written together with Robert Gilbert and Erik Charell, set to music by Ralph Benatzky. Earlier works were the librettos for Erich Wolfgang Korngold operas Violanta (1916) and Das Wunder der Heliane (1927).\n\nMuller-Einigen went to Hollywood in the 1920s where several films were made from his scripts. Since 1930 he lived in Einigen.\n\nHis brother was the author and critic Ernst Lothar (real name: Ernst Lothar Muller)."
