        "text": "July 24, 2019\n\nOne Hour with You, based on the play by Lothar Schmidt\n\n8 out of 10\n\nOne Hour with You has been included on The New York Times' Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made list.\n\nFurthermore, it was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture.\n\nClassic it may well be, but this cinephile would not include it on his list of favorite films.\n\nGranted, the sense of deja by is not just unfair, it is absurd.\n\nSince this film was launched in 1932, it is other movies that have taken inspiration from it.\n\nIt is just a question of seeing it after so many others, that have not preceded it.\n\nMaurice Chevalier is self assured, remarkable and a good singer in the role of Doctor Andre Bertier.\n\nHe is married to Colette and they seem to have a happy life ahead of them.\n\nFurthermore, the doctor seems to be restrained and faithful, against type...well, at least contrary to the image that the French have or used to have.\n\nWhen he is sharing a cab with an attractive woman, early in the plot, they both notice that nobody would believe that they just behaved decently.\n\nHe reads the paper, she looks out the window,but who would believe it...they both admit that no one would.\n\nHence she says they must act as everyone would expect and she is ready to kiss him.\n\nStop the car! Shouts the doctor\n\nHe gets off, walks away and then returns to say:\n\nYou may think I am a coward, Madame...\n\nWell, I am!\n\nWhen Andre Bertier meets the best friend of his wife, he is asked...\n\nIsn't she splendid? Don't you like her?\n\nHe does and says it.\n\nMitzi Olivier is the name of this woman and there would be trouble now that a complicated ménage a trois seems to be initiated.\n\nSoon, this friend says she is ill and asks her maid to call the doctor.\n\nAndre Bertier does not want to be involved, when his wife answers the call.\n\nHe would rather have this patient call someone else.\n\nWith hindsight, he had been rather prescient.\n\nAdolph is a name that is anathema today, but may I remind you that this was produced before the monstrous Hitler became relevant.\n\nAnd Adolph is the name of Mitzi's husband.\n\nHe would try to get close to Colette, in a strange game that goes beyond the ménage a trois and becomes a square of possible infidelities.\n\nOne Hour with You is pleasant and amusing, but this viewer still does not see it as one of The Best Films Ever Made."
