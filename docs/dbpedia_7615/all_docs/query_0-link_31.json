        "text": "This blog is about the ethical challenges of leaving the field. I follow the suggestion of T.M.S. Evens (2008: x) to see anthropology as an intrinsically ethical discipline for its active engagement with notions and empirical research of other and otherness as well as relations between self and other. I would like to examine a situation in which relations between a group and a researcher reach a point when the latter feels compelled to leave the field of research.\n\nAnthropological literature relates to the experience of leaving the field to a much lesser extent than to entering it although the exit strategies and dilemmas produce significant reflexive gains (Delamont, 2016: 5). It’s a formative experience for an anthropologist who feels she collected enough research material and is confident in its interpretation (Gobo, 2008: 312). Sometimes anthropologists leave when they become too familiar with the field or start to gain power and authority (Fine, 1983 in Delamont, 2016: 6). However, every exit implies an ethical dimension because close relations between researcher and participants created during fieldwork are coming to an end. Anthropologists remind us that these relations are also power relations that include an exploitative potential by a researcher for whom interactions with the researched group are conducive to building an academic career (Delamont, 2016; Gobo, 2018; Girke, 2021).\n\nI would like to add to these important considerations an ethical dilemma that regards my own exit from a virtual café of philosophical practice in Russia, one of my research field sites[1]. This consideration is presented through the image of the zoom black windows (as participants’ names and locations are kept anonymous for the sake of their safety), with the ‘leave’ button appearing next to the image of the building in Kiev hit by Russian missiles on the first days of invasion to Ukraine. Timing played a crucial role in my decision to leave, due to unfolding of the tragic political events of invasion and fierce destruction as well as my questions piling up every day as the war was becoming a cruel constant of reality. Prior to this decision, I frequented the café’s weekly meetings between February 2020 and May 2022.\n\nGoing backwards on the timeline, I was a part of Russia, I was born and grew up there, my identity, my language, my habitus, my sense(s) of the world started to form on its vast landscapes. But not for long: thirty years ago I immigrated to Israel, cutting ties with the Russian-speaking community but not with literature, arts and philosophy of my former homeland. Entering a Russian site of research in 2020 was an exciting opportunity for me to investigate cultural changes in the country.\n\nI study philosophical practice, an international movement initiated by philosophy graduates in the early 1980s. The aim of this movement is to make philosophy accessible to a broader audience. In my research, I am exploring different methods philosophical practitioners apply to translate philosophical ideas to practices embedded in daily life.\n\nThe café-philo I studied started as a real café where for three years people would gather on a weekly basis, drink a cup of coffee, read and discuss an excerpt of philosophical or literary text. In February 2020, as the national lockdowns assumed a real form, the Russian café-philo went online and I decided to join in. The new virtual format allowed a much wider scope of participants to join, including people from other cities and even other countries. Café meetings were free of charge and everyone willing to join could do that quite freely.\n\nThe procedure of café-philo remained unchanged since the times it was a physical meeting place. People would read together a paragraph by Simone de Beauvoir or St. Augustin. The following discussion was not supposed to be analytical but to connect between the text and every participant’s personal experience, in accordance with the café’s motto: “find a philosopher in yourself”. However, this task proved to be difficult for people raised in Soviet and Post-Soviet Russian culture. This culture saw any direct expression of personal worlds as unwise and dangerous, and favored philosophical and literary abstractions instead (Epstein, 2010). Still, although participants were speaking in general, revealing as little as possible about their own lives and experiences, they seemed to enjoy discussions and participated in them passionately, sometimes with tears in their eyes, reflecting that in this group they could finally discuss matters of higher reality beyond tedious routine and in this way to “take care of self”[2].\n\nDuring my weekly participant observations in the café-philo, its participants grew to know me as presenting a different point of view outside of Russian reality. Sometimes people requested me to articulate my point of view on issues they discussed. Despite the virtual communication format, warm and friendly relations developed between me and others.\n\nIt all changed for me on the morning of 24/2/2022 with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Angry and confused by the Russian brutal attack, I couldn’t stay neutral to anything connected to Russia. I came to the next café session eager to meet my long-time companions for philosophizing.\n\nThe meeting was strained. Participants demanded not to record it (which was done previously). Although we all were confined in Zoom windows one could feel the tension in a virtual space between us. But not one word was said about the war. Instead, the facilitator presented a text by Miguel de Unamuno, the Spanish philosopher and writer who actively protested the rise of Spanish fascism in the 1930s and sacrificed his academic career, being sentenced to house arrest and dying broken-hearted soon afterwards. His life story in the beginning of the session appeared as a part of the usual procedure, after which we read an excerpt from The Tragic Sense of Life by Unamuno.\n\nThe conversation on a germane topic concerning the fragility of human life and its persistence through relations was deep and animated. Unamuno’s biographic example brought in the beginning of the session sounded inspiring regarding his struggle with a fascist regime. However, the recent Russian invasion continued to be unarticulated, ‘an elephant in the room’. During the next few weeks, the same pattern repeated. Although the text touched relevant themes, the discussion stayed unrelated to the current events in Russia. Any attempts to speak about the political situation were quickly suppressed and the conversation was diverted to a different path. For example, discussing a text by Jaspers on guilt, participants were not ready to accept the concept of guilt preferring that of responsibility instead. They led a vivid discussion on crimes of the Nazi regime, perhaps referring to but keeping silent about their own government. I understood that the group reluctance to protest against the war was due to the will to preserve their personal and professional safety. It actually matched my own aim not to harm people and to support their striving to keep freedom of thought (even without freedom of speech) when the last sprouts of freedom were weeded out.\n\nBut as the meetings proceeded, it became apparent to me that the existence of the café as a last resort of free thought was uncertain. While some participants continued to demand personal responsibility even in situations created by external circumstances, others started to ponder the possibility of silence and “continuing to do one’s own job” regardless of circumstances, or even to try to adapt to changing conditions. I came to realize that a refusal to call the violent invasion by its name and the liberal inclusiveness of discourse were conditions that enabled the initial thriving of free thought in the café-philo. However, three months into the war the same conditions have created tolerance to any opinion labeling it indiscriminately as ‘care of self’. In my view, this generated ethical confusion rather than ethical development. It was the point when I decided to leave.\n\nLeaving a physical field of research can be emotionally challenging due to the severing of personal connections forged during extended stays in the field, often accompanied by fear of betrayal towards the studied community. However, in today's digital age, researchers and communities can maintain contact through virtual platforms like Facebook or Twitter. Physical co-location is no longer a prerequisite for co-presence, allowing the process of leaving the field to be less final. As Girke (2021: 110) states, \"we are now forevermore betwixt and between, entangled with another place and other people.\" In my case, location was never a barrier as the Russian research site was virtual. The co-presence could continue if I wished to participate in the meetings. Yet, I found myself increasingly unable to refrain from evaluating or judging the perspectives I encountered during discussions since the onset of the war. Over several weeks, my dissatisfaction with both myself and the discussions deepened. I empathized with participants who faced moral dilemmas and attempted to escape them by focusing on familiar topics, like digital society or matters of good and evil. I couldn't blame them, as the Russian government tightened control over personal freedoms and suppressed any form of objection in the face of mounting evidence of war crimes. Nevertheless, I couldn't align myself with them either, haunted as I was by the cruelty, injustice, and lies perpetuated by their state. Café participants, unlike people in Ukraine, were physically safe and continued with their daily lives, and I felt that my presence as a Russian-speaking outsider was significant by enabling them to share thoughts and feelings. However, as informants grew hesitant to speak freely with me even outside the café, and my own concerns intensified that my participation might compromise their safety, I realized I had no right to prolong my research. Caught in this ethical conundrum, hanging \" betwixt and between,\" I made the choice to stay entangled with the group I studied not through social networks, as Girke suggests, but rather via a shared sense of despair and responsibility among individuals for whom Russia was a part of their personal timeline.\n\nBibliography:\n\nDelamont, Sara. 2016. “Time to Kill the Witch?

Although this concept is much debated today, generally speaking Foucault meant by it an ongoing effort for ethical and spiritual development of a person.\n\nSee for example, Richard White, 2014. “Foucault on the Care of the Self as an Ethical Project and a Spiritual Goal”. Human Studies 37: 489-504.\n\nOn the early morning of Tuesday, April 19th 2022, I drove through the empty streets of Sept Iles, on the way to the small Quebec North Shore & Labrador (QNS&L) train station. As there are no roads that connect Schefferville to Sept Iles and the rest of the country, the only options to reach it are by plane or by train. On that morning I was about to embark on the Tshiuetin, an partially indigenous-owned and operated train line that from Sept-Iles crosses the entirety of Labrador for 500 kilometers and stops in Schefferville.[1] Traveling with the Tshiuetin also means moving further and further into the Nitassinan (ᓂᑕᔅᓯᓇᓐ), the Innu people’s ancestral, unceded (yet still unrecognized) territory.\n\nIt has been almost exactly six years since I’ve taken that train for the first and only time, back in May 2016. It’s hard to recall my memories of that first experience. Some are still crystal clear in my mind: some faces, some events, some sounds, smells, and feelings. Others are very vague, almost dream-like. Some souvenirs have been washed away by time, while others have been crystallized by it and rendered even more vivid. Memory sometimes feels like a space existing in the tension between forgetfulness and onward projection, where only some selected fragments are conserved and irregularly re-invested by our very own subjectivities, feelings, and desires.\n\nSimilarly to that first time in 2016, that morning of April 2022 I took the train from Sept-Iles without really knowing when we would arrive, as the duration of the trip is determined by different factors. One of the major ones is the frequency of the intersections with the cargo trains transporting the extracted iron ore from Schefferville down south to Sept Iles, in the opposite direction. Another one is the number of on-demand stops that the train will do along its journey to disembark people in their remote cabins in the forest. As it was the first train operating after the Easter Holidays, the QNS&L station in Sept Iles was packed with people who had gone down South visiting their families or just doing vacations in Sept Iles itself, Québec or Montréal. On the return trip to their community, they were carrying with them as much luggage as possible, with plenty of food, new clothes, electronics, or any other item that is either impossible to find or is way more expensive to purchase in Schefferville.\n\nAlmost all the people taking the train, as well as most of the employees of the company, are Innus. For the first time since my departure from Switzerland, I am hit by the realization that I am now in another country within Québec, a country where I don’t speak the language, and a country where it’s inevitable to be recognized as a foreigner, a white man, un blanc. I remember that day with mixed feelings. On one side, I had a strong feeling of not belonging. I am there, alone and I don’t know anyone. I am going to a place that I can barely remember, for a reason that in that moment I can barely justify to myself. I feel a strange mix of anxiety and excitement produced by the alterity that surrounds me which in turn, like a mirror, brings me to a confrontation with my own self. However, I also remember a vivid feeling of concreteness produced by the reality surrounding me, by the start of an actual life experience, a kind of soulagement due to the connection with the immediacy of fieldwork, with its human and nonhuman encounters after months of uncertainty and intellectualizations. That day I finally realized that “it” was happening, and that from now on, I was in “it” – whatever that “it” was and meant.\n\nStarting from that day I conducted an 8-months fieldwork in the small mining settlement of Schefferville and in the adjacent Innu community of Matimekush – Lac John, at the border between the Canadian provinces of Québec and Labrador – Newfoundland. The North Shore region of Sept Iles and the inland area of Schefferville share a common, intertwined past, both from an indigenous and a settler perspective. At the start of the XXth century, before the start of the mining operations and before the creation of the reserves, the Innu people seasonally moved across this immense area, spending the summer on the Saint Laurent north shore and the winter inland, hunting and trapping. Then, in the following decades and in parallel to the proliferation of the prospection operations, the federal state intensified the process of sedentarization and allocated to them portions of land, creating Indian reserves. It is around the postwar period of the 1950s that mining operations started: during that time Sept Iles became officially a town and the settlement of Schefferville was created by the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) to house the mines’ workers and their families. Only a couple years later, families from the Innu reservation of Uashat – Maliotenam, next to Sept Iles, were relocated to the newly created reservation of Matimekush – Lac John, in the immediate vicinity of the company’s mining town. In the following decades and until today, these two regions have thus shared a similar path and have been heavily marked by the volatility of the mining operations. However, the way in which extractive activities affected the Innu communities is very different from the way Sept Iles and Schefferville experienced it. If the latter have mostly been able to capitalize on this “modernization project” of the Canadian North, the former are still struggling to cope with the processes of extractivism and the social, environmental and cultural damage that this settler project brought to their life and territories. [2]\n\nNowadays, life in Schefferville and Matimekush - Lac John still very much depends on and is affected by mining-related activities. Since my arrival on the late night of that same day after a 16-hour journey, I could start to experience the extent of the impact of the mining operations on the landscape and its human and nonhuman communities. However, the complexity and the multi-faceted nature of this impact came to me progressively, following both the rhythms of seasons, and the evolution of my relationships in the field. Schefferville is located where the subarctic taiga slowly transitions into the arctic tundra. The terrain is a mix of rocky hills and marshy lowlands where lakes and rivers abound. Large patches of boreal forest cover the region with small spruce trees growing from an incredibly rich and spongy soil – bog and muskeg. When I arrived, towards the end of April, the winter was still very much present, and the land was covered by a large white snowy cloth. Everything was clean and accessible, and people were still using snowmobiles to move around. Then, only a couple weeks after, in May, the snow started to melt, and the whiteness slowly left space to the redness of the iron-rich earth and the waste that was disseminated everywhere. Carcasses of old cars, pieces of metal, plastic, and a myriad of abandoned objects resurfaced from their winter sleep. And along with these objects came the dust, the iron ore dust. The dust covering the caribou lichens, dust in the water and in fish’s stomachs, dust entering humans’ eyes and skin, dust that was often mentioned as one of the potential causes of respiratory problems for the people of the community…dust coming from the mining operations, that the wind was now spreading everywhere in town. And suddenly, spring was there.\n\nI have no memory of dust in my first trip in 2016; I only remember the red earth starting to slowly resurface underneath the melting snow. On that occasion I only spent a few days in Schefferville accompanying a friend, a linguist, who was working on the Innu language – although not in Matimekush – Lac John. That time I came as a distanced visitor and went away fast, too fast, and since then I always felt a desire to come back and experience the landscape and the community for a longer period. Six years later I did, on a several months fieldwork stay during which I established an intimate relationship with this complex territory and simultaneously learned to resonate with the precarious and volatile life conditions of its human and nonhuman inhabitants. Nowadays, back from the field, I am patiently letting the dust settle while I slowly confront myself with the multilayered space of memory and its tensions. A new, different spring is here again.\n\n[1] Ownership of the Tshiuetin Railway is a more complex matter, as it is shared between the local indigenous communities (in charge of the trait linking Schefferville to Emeril Junction) and the Quebec and North Shore Railway, a subsidiary company of the IOC – Rio Tinto corporation.\n\n[2] The concept of « extractivism » defines the 500-year colonial and imperialist history of a mode of accumulation whereby raw materials were removed from colonized landscapes to enrich the centres of the world economy.\n\nThe Lieutenant-Colonel is in tight posture, wearing a remarkable number of military insignia on his left chest and gesturing the military salute. He directs his gaze at drivers and passers-by in city centers and on national roads in Armenia, a small country in the South Caucasus. With the statement “I serve my motherland” in the foreground of a waving Armenian flag he promises the observer his military commitment to his country. At the same time, with a certain moral obligation, he asks the passers-by to follow his roadmap. These posters, along with huge painted portraits of fallen soldiers on house fronts, their photos hung in classrooms, memorial sites in the streets, and national flags above graves in cemeteries are reminders of Armenia’s unresolved military conflict with Azerbaijan. As I will illustrate in the following, militarization can have multiple, conflicting as well as interlinked effects on people’s everyday lives and their futures, as I have experienced during my fieldwork.\n\nSince the Second Karabakh War in 2020, post-soviet Armenia finds itself in a tense security situation. Recurring violations of the ceasefire with Azerbaijan as well as the diplomatic conflict and the closed and militarized border between Armenia and Azerbaijan’s ally Turkey puts Armenia in an atmosphere of constant threat and uncertainty. At the same time, in times of global inflation and energy crisis, the war in Ukraine and the consequent immigration from Russia and Ukraine, paradoxically enough, triggered an unprecedented economic growth in Armenia.\n\n“Armenia under attack”, I read in the headlines just after I had woken up. Azerbaijan had launched a military offensive on Armenian sovereign territory. The morning news of last September 13th gave me a small sense of how uncertainty is present in Armenia’s everyday life. Even though the escalation calmed down after two days of heavy fighting, no sentiment of “security” or “peace” followed. The subsequent weeks were pervaded by violations of the ceasefire and a subliminal atmosphere of fear and of crisis preparedness persisted. For a few weeks, public life in Armenia was set on stand-by. Different media outlets and political experts warned of another large-scale attack by Azerbaijan, which, however, has not occurred up to this day. A few weeks later, streets and restaurants had filled with people again, concerts and other cultural events resumed. Everyday life between war and peace went into a next round. While people carry out their jobs, bring their children and grandchildren to school, and dig up their potato fields for the next harvest, the normality of conflict keeps lying like a gray haze over the present and the future of people in Armenia.\n\nNare is a teacher in Gyumri, Armenia’s second largest city and a border city with Turkey, where I conducted my fieldwork. After the latest aggression in September, she immediately re-started organizing the shipment of humanitarian aid to soldiers, an activity she has led in her school for years already. Over coffee in a newly opened restaurant in the city center, she shared her pain about the current situation. “The worst is when there is shooting at the border [with Azerbaijan]. You sit in class, and you look in your students’ eyes, and you see the uncertainty.” Between the “belligerent periods” she tries to organize cheerful events for her students. The spaghetti night in her classroom, which we organized together, was one of those events. “You never know what will be tomorrow”, she repeated time and again when explaining her exceptional dedication to her students. “You don't know as a teacher what to say to them”, Nare described her inner turmoil. Thinking about her students’ future, she tends to tell them to study a foreign language and to leave the country, she said. “On the other hand, I am Armenian. I love my land. I am a teacher, I am an educator and I want to give them some confidence, some hope that things are getting better in our country too.” While some of her students want to leave the country, many of them want to stay. “They said ‘whether it's safe or not, this is our country’. Two boys said that ‘we will stay here, and we will work for our country and invest’. [ …] There are also these kinds of students. Despite the uncertainty about what tomorrow will bring, and especially even though they must go to the army...”, she recounted in a perplexed tone.\n\n“I serve my motherland”: Who, how and at what price? This moralizing call to presumably men makes me think about how the government sets a normative roadmap for Armenians’ future-making.\n\nThe anthropology of the future can contribute to complicating predominant governmental discourses like this. How do people’s practices and orders of everyday life shape the imagination of their future? I have observed that, besides the governmental imaginations, in an environment of “generalized uncertainty” (Kleist and Jansen 2016:377), there are a variety of imaginations and hopes circulating in Armenian society. As I find myself in the middle of my fieldwork, I am faced with the challenge of navigating the realm of hope, which has become key to ethnographic knowledge production in the field of anthropology of the future. I opt for a critical engagement with the term, rather than contributing to naïve narrations of optimism. What does “hopefulness against all odds” (Kleist and Jansen 2016:379) feel like and what imaginations are behind it?\n\nReferences\n\nKleist, Nauja, and Stef Jansen\n\n2016 Introduction: Hope over Time—Crisis, Immobility and Future-Making.

We left our previous position in the city of Montevideo, replaced it with a trans-local one, and started a journey with our dog, Connie. It was not an escape attempt to detach us from the sedentary world and to abandon our sense of responsibility, nor to give up our plans for the future and to move to the margin of the nation-state paradigm. Rather, it was more to break the monotony affections of everyday life and to experience connecting to the world differently. The flexible lifestyle we got, exposed us to combined strategies of being connected and disconnected to the modern world, its technologies, and society. At the same time, we could proceed with our established activities such as pursuing my master’s degree in anthropology, and Jana could continue as an English teacher remotely. While travelling, we realised that our consumption should be reduced to follow the rhythm of this lifestyle. On the one hand, the limited space in our home wouldn’t allow any kind of unnecessary accumulations. On the other hand, the surplus time, the cultural interactions, and the frequent change of landscapes we have gained by this rhythm have only been possible along with accepting the risk of precarious economic conditions. The edge of the capitalist world has become challenge and ecstasy at the same time. After two years of living this way, we realized that the potential of the flexibility to move, change, and adapt allowed us to transform our fix roots to portable ones which travel with us along our migratory path. We are more confident to improvise than to lean on regular patterns, and we have developed a sense of adaptation to anywhere and everywhere in the world regardless of the political and national borders and limitations. Moreover, we realised that the impact of this lifestyle has transcended the human category, and Connie has accommodated to the change too.\n\nMay 18, 2022. Rio Gallegos, Argentina. We went back to spend the night near the river. We let Connie out for some time as we always do. She just freely runs around and plays with other dogs and then we call her back. However, this night, she was nowhere to be found. It was getting late and very cold. I had done many walks around, calling her, looking for her with a torch but she was nowhere. After a few hours, we found her walking on the street about 2km from the spot we had parked. I was angry with her for not staying close by and not listening when we were calling her but at the same time, I was relieved that we found her unharmed. When we lived in the city, we often used the leash and Connie used to stick to the rules. While travelling, our controlling logic towards Connie has been influenced by the new reality and the fact of spending more time in nature and small towns. Consequently, the use of the leash has been less required, and she gradually started to fill up the gap caused by the absence of the patterns of the past, and to expand her comfort zone. During the first few months, she would go for a quick walk by herself, and then she would lie down next to the motorhome’s door. Over time, this scenery started to change. Her walks started to last for longer periods. Ultimately, she would disappear and a few hours later, she would come back. We realised how independent she was becoming. We had no choice but to respect her space and spontaneity and wait for her to continue our journey. She is an energetic dog; however, she had not enjoyed spending time with other dogs when we lived in the city. Much less with cats, she got very territorial and would chase them. We were never sure if she chased them for fun or to expel them. However, we were sure that cats put themselves in a defensive position and would run away. After changing our lifestyle, this attitude started to change, gradually. She began to behave a bit differently with other animals, she became calmer meeting bigger animals such as a horse. While with dogs she would play for a short time, and then go her own way. As well, her relationship with cats is quite different now, she does not chase them anymore. We realised that she avoids them or at least she respects their space as far as they respect her space too. For the first time in her life, she cohabited in the same space with a cat while we were visiting some friends in Ushuaia. All of this made me realize how the mobile lifestyle has affected the hierarchal order of needs in our relationship with Connie, and how this change has allowed her to establish more equal relations with other species and to become more independent and relaxed.\n\nBy observing the change in Connie’s behaviour, I could make sense of Anna Tsing’s concept of “transformation through encounters”. The comparison I made between Connie’s attitude and adaptative modes while living in the city and lately in the mobile lifestyle allows us to follow the possibilities of new interspecies collaborations and the rise of unknown assemblages on the edge of the capitalist world. The connotations of this change reveal how the modern rhythm is not only affecting us as humans but is even transmitted by us to non-human through human-dominated interspecies relations. At the same time, Connie’s change reflects back to the human category by showing how the personal impression upon the surroundings is constituted by the surroundings' impression upon the personal. I tried to show how Connie’s adaptation modes have been influenced, to a certain degree, by the order we enforce upon her while in the city or on the move, and how this order changed after changing our perception of our surroundings. In our case, the mobile lifestyle has allowed us to encounter alternatives to capitalistically constituted relationships by allowing more improvisation and less control in our relations with other people and with other species that we keep establishing along the journey. In line with Anna Tsing’s concept, we realized how shifting our attention, expectations and preoccupations in life have reflected on our networks, and consequently, modified the shape of our entanglements. It might be odd to think that human control of other species will stop one day, however, by shifting our attention in life, we might refigure our understanding of survival as a collaborative project.\n\nI conducted nine months of fieldwork between July 2021 and June 2022 in a village by the Iraqi border in Iranian Kurdistan. Although I made short trips to other parts of Iranian Kurdistan during this time (mostly to visit urban settings), I was based in that village – whose name I intend not to mention. This decision is key to understanding not only my relationship as a researcher with my interlocutors in that village but also my relationship with my interlocutors in academia. Usually, when anthropologists try to display their erudition to other anthropologists, they feel compelled to give the readers accounts of fieldwork early on, especially about how they worked their way through building relationships with their informants and how the knowledge was acquired. But not everything the ethnographer has to say in this regard makes it into the ethnographies we read, and it is indisputable that in every action in the writing process, exist considerations that have convinced the writer to leave some parts out. Those left-out parts can be about a myriad of issues. They can be about traumas or difficult relationships the fieldworkers had with their informants, and especially the inexperienced fieldworkers may, among other things, think that writing about them would make them less of a good ethnographer in the eyes of their academic interlocutors. Or they can be about the fieldworker’s physical hardships, and they may think their narration of those hardships breaks anthropology’s old mold of the heroic lone fieldworker venturing out into the unknown,[i] where their “courage, love of adventure, and physical hardiness-as well as brains-are called upon.”[ii] Now imagine the inexperienced fieldworker is writing about a community of people who consider those hardships the least of their problems. Nevertheless, every time I look at this photo, which is not, quite tellingly, taken by myself (it was taken by the late local photographer and nature enthusiast, Mokrem Ghaderi), I can vividly see myself alone in one of those houses, doubting my sanity for embarking on fieldwork in a place that felt like the edge of the world on so many levels. I still cannot fathom how I endured the harsh January of 2022 there, where for over a week, roads were closed, telecommunication was down, and rolling blackouts were nothing out of the ordinary due to the heavy snowfall and poor infrastructure. For reasons of space, I cannot dwell on how I or my field interlocutors felt about this infrastructure fragility because here, I want to talk about considerations leading to my probable decision to leave other parts of my account of fieldwork out of my writing. Those considerations made me realize that the most formidable challenge is not doing fieldwork. Instead, it is starting to write about it.\n\nThe village’s landscape and its immediate mountainous environs, located at the margins of the nation-state, already give you, as a couple of young men from that village expressed to me, the feeling of residing in a big prison. Now imagine everything blanketed with snow, putting your ability to be mobile to a grinding halt. To exhaust the metaphor, imagine the public spaces of this big prison divided along gender lines, and women do not spend as much time outside in the open air each day as men do. Or they do not get the chance to leave for short or long periods as much as men do. I went there to do fieldwork as a man and realized that those men who live there are particularly obstinate about defending this gender divide partly based on the Islamic notion of man guardianship. But then, after a while, when the annoying snowy weather was disrupting my ability to move, I found out there was a group of young women who were, inter alia, openly fighting against that gender divide. With great tenacity, they fixed me up with meetings with other women, and towards the end of my fieldwork, I heard them lamenting about the fact that they could not talk to me sooner. They told me, time and again, to be their voice, and as much as I am uninterested in the anthropological cliché of being the voice of the voiceless, especially when it comes to a man researcher being the voice of women, I find it hard to shy away from writing about what I observed there in regard to women. Women’s presence in public spaces was regulated with exclusionary effects visible to any outsider; in a homosocial town where women were, for the most part, relegated to the confinement of houses with few exceptions of some laborious activities like tending to the garden or grocery shopping. Hardly a conversation with women finished without heartbreaking stories about suicide attempts, domestic violence, child marriage, and life after divorce. A pullback on the part of the Iranian state and leaving everything to the local religious leaders basically made those men the guardians of the chastity of the town’s women, not that the Iranian state’s record is any better when it comes to women’s rights and social liberty.\n\nAfter I finally broke from the place to go back to my academic cocoon, I was filled with anger and a profound urge to find words to make sense of what those women had told me. I needed to analyze those materials as my academic interlocutors expected me to. And for me, it was not a luxury. Channeling those heavy things I carried back with me into something worthwhile was a critical necessity to make up for what, at that time, felt like a lost year in my life. But after a conversation with a kindly man academic interlocutor who profoundly cares about my project, chiding me for putting those women in danger and hinting at the idea of leaving parts out of my writings to protect them, I found myself introduced to one of the many considerations behind left-out parts in ethnographies. I also read from other academic interlocutors who seemed to be in favor of toning down the voices of those who seem to back stereotypes about the Middle East/Islam. Even an analysis of different vectors of domination that are controlling my Kurdish woman interlocutors’ lives, written by a Persian man of all people, may come across as a portrayal of Muslim women as victims needing to be saved.[iii] While I appreciate these sensible remarks, I also have to consider those women’s yearning to be in my writings. But keeping their stories in my writings would mean that I would have to leave out many details about the place in which I conducted my fieldwork and about my key woman informants to protect them from possible retaliation by some of those men or the Islamic Republic authorities. But how many details need to be changed to complete the anonymization of women behind my stories? And what if they cannot find any trace of their stories in my writings, and I end up underrepresenting them (read: reproducing oppression) only because they are not supposed to speak up in a gender-apartheid setting?\n\nHowever, those women and other women of Iran can render some of my considerations moot. As I am writing these lines, those very same women are telling me about what the young schoolgirls in the village did after the school principal reported one of their classmates to the county’s security officials for supporting the nationwide protests that erupted across Iran after the killing of the 22-year-old Kurdish woman, Mahsa (Jina) Amini in the hands of Iran’s hijab police in Tehran. The schoolgirls started booing the school principal and chanted the nationwide movement’s slogans to her face: woman, life, freedom.\n\n[i] Laurent Dubois, ‘“Man’s Darkest Hours\": Maleness, Travel, and Anthropology’, in Women Writing Culture, ed.

This question was central to a course led by Dr. Darcy Alexandra I attended at this institute in the autumn semester of 2021. To engage with this question, I took a bike ride with my father along bodies of water in the \"swamp\" of the municipality of Wauwil (LU), where I grew up. Since the 19th century, the Wauwil plain has changed from a moor landscape to an area of intensive agricultural production (Birrer 1999). Specific historical periods and events, such as the glaciation and the Stone Age, among others, have shaped today's village – so too have local people's understandings of themselves and their surroundings. Claims about where certain archaeological findings were made – on the neighboring village of Egolzwils' side of the plain or on Wauwil’s side – form everyday discourses and influence discussions within the two villages.\n\nWithout any specific agenda other than following the water through the plain, my father and I took our phones and rode around the area as we had done many times before. This time, instead of talking, we silently cycled and took photos of scenes that caught our attention. While cycling along the gravel paths I have known so well since childhood, while passing the pile-dwelling houses I myself had helped to build and while cooling my hands in the icy water of the ponds and creeks, I thought about Tim Ingold's book, “The Temporality of the Landscape”, which argues that the landscape is a testimony to the lives of past generations who have left something of themselves in it by dwelling within it (Ingold 1993: 152). Ingold connects the practice of archaeology, which is, according to him, in and of itself a form of dwelling, to social anthropology. He writes:\n\n\"For both the archaeologist and the native dweller, the landscape tells - or rather is - a story. It enfolds the lives and times of predecessors who, over the generations, have moved around in it and played their part in its formation. To perceive the landscape is therefore to carry out an act of remembrance, and remembering is not so much a matter of calling up an internal image, stored in the mind, as of engaging with an environment that is itself pregnant with the past.\" (Ingold 1993: 152)\n\nThe bike ride was not only a way of reflecting on my own being and living within this landscape but also of looking into the past. I took the photo for this blog post from an observation tower in the conservation area of the former swamp. From atop the tower there is a wonderful view across the nature reserve areas on one side, and on the other, the agricultural lands. The thick reeds spread like a carpet, obscuring the view of the water below. The water is invisible at times and so are certain historical events which are not talked about much. They nevertheless linger in the present and have shaped this landscape. For example, the plain witnessed the horrors of an internment camp during WWII. Allied soldiers who were punished for escape attempts or other offenses were interned in the camp, which is known for the inhumane treatment of its inmates. The sanitary facilities were inadequate, and due to the camp’s location in the former swamp, which is characterized by high humidity, the inmates had to live ankle-deep in mud. The health conditions were correspondingly poor (Schlenker 2013). The landscape, and especially the water in the moor, in this case, was not only the stage where abuse was happening but, as a hostile environment, also an instrument of violence in and for itself. The camp no longer exists today. Instead, there is a semi-open prison in its place, which includes an agricultural business and, as a separate part of the same institution, a deportation prison. The history of internment is barely visible. I only recently learned about a memorial stone which was unveiled in 2015 at the site of the former internment camp.\n\nIn contrast, the history of the pile-dwelling era of the region is highlighted through different visual representations in the village, for example, large pictures of the pile-dwelling houses on the underpass walls of the Wauwil station or a learning path that leads through archaeological sites in the plain. These sites are located on the edge of the former Lake Wauwil, which was formed by glacial melting (Birrer 1999).\n\nWater has always been an integral part of shaping the landscape and the lives of people moving within it. The melting of the glaciers produced Lake Wauwil, which provided a livelihood for the pile dwellers. The drainage of this lake in the 19th century contributed to the region's industrialization and the expansion of agriculture. The humidity in the plain, which continued to influence the landscape, led to poor conditions in the internment camp during WWII.\n\nWhat started as a bicycle ride along the water in my hometown ended in an engagement and reflection about visibilities and invisibilities through time and space and my relations to these (in)visibilities. What could I learn then, thinking through and with water? I realized that our engagement with the world is in constant movement, and connections might come to the surface in the most familiar and, thereby, most unexpected places. The landscape and more specifically water is not only an object to be observed, and photography is not solely a way of capturing these objects – these tools become a way of thinking through issues and one’s own position to and engagement with them.\n\nLiterature\n\nBirrer, Simon (Hg.) 1999: Wauwiler Ebene.

Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, public and social media label it as a “lost year”. Forcing a pause to the business as usual, human responses to the pandemic also brought to light some of the mechanisms that cause suffering all over the globe – and its unequal distribution. In this blog post, I dwell on one aspect of these inequalities that emerged through a debate about pandemic politics in a migrant-rights activist group in which I participated in the context of my postdoctoral research in a middle-sized city in Italy. To do so, I will center on the above meme published by one of the group’s members on his social media account in June, evoking a combination of determination and exhaustion.\n\nOne of the tropes that came up in the early “first wave” of the coronavirus, mainly through videos shared on Messaging Apps, was the incentive to understand the forced halt as an occasion for contemplation, and as a welcome break from a general sense of frenzy and saturation. The trope was picked up by the Italian premier Giuseppe Conte who said on March 24, 2020 (Facebook live video): “I am convinced that this hard challenge which we are all facing will make us better […]. This is an occasion to stop - to do the musings that we usually don’t manage to do, because we are taken by a frenetic routine, a frenetic coming and going” (translation by the author). Yet, being able to pause (in serenity) is a privilege that is unequally distributed along race, class, and gender lines.\n\nIn the early days of the lockdown, our activist group raised attention to a long-standing problem that had become a health hazard: many of the people who continued to work in so-called essential sectors and thus secured the functioning of society were migrants. However, most of them did not have access to public health care nor unemployment pay because they were without papers. In May, the Italian government finally passed a legalization campaign (sanatoria) for agricultural and care-workers, presenting it as a victory over what is known as caporalato, i.e., exploitative employment conditions that ignore legal salary rates and working conditions by outsourcing the hiring of day-laborers to intermediaries.\n\nAs soon as the campaign was published, our group met online to organize a manifestation. Right from the start, activists decried the initiative. Energetic Fatou, who came to Italy in the early 1990s from Ivory Coast claims: “We have seen this before. They did the same with the sanatoria a few years ago.” The campaign would only offer residence permits limited to a few months. Plus: the government had promised to abolish Salvini’s Decreto Sicurezza from 2018 (which was replaced by a less stringent law in December 2020). Now they are promoting this campaign as a victory? Anyways, the activists agree, as long as the Bossi-Fini law from 2002 remains, structural discrimination will remain intact. The law ties residence permits to work contracts, thus pushing migrants to remain in exploitative working conditions lest risking illegalization. Ibou, a tall slim fifty-year-old from Senegal, added: “This is state-driven caporalato.” Indeed, as employers have to pay 400€ to regularize their workers, they are likely to ask the money from their employees, thus reinforcing the bondage created by the Bossi-Fini law. Yousef, just as the others, is not eligible to apply for legalization unless he abandons his job in the metal industry for more precarious agricultural employment. He exclaims “We are tired (siamo stanchi)! Many of us have been struggling for years to get papers. Now it is under these conditions that they are offered. This never ends (non finisce mai)!”\n\nOne week later, four policemen killed the Black American George Floyd in Minneapolis. The date of our manifestation thus fell into a period marked by the probably largest civil upheaval the United States has ever seen. In this context, the sanatoria became just one more example of necropolitics (Mbembe 2019). Our dozens of speakers at the event at the city’s main square tied their grievances of racism and exploitation in Italy to the Black Lives Matter movement in the US and ongoing colonialism in their African home countries screaming: “I am a black man!” and “No justice no peace!” A few weeks later, one of the activists posted the meme.\n\nThe feeling of exhaustion in combination with strength is not new, nor is it unique to migrants. Memes saying “I’m strong but I’m tired” have been circulating in various languages since the mid-2010s. The slogan found its way on titles of blog posts relating to experiences as different as white Western motherhood, romantic delusion or coping with life-threatening illness. The popularity of the meme highlights a widespread affective experience that is inherent to the Western neoliberal requirement of being self-sufficient, enterprising and resourceful (cf. Bauman 2000). In other words, the meme effectively illustrates Elisabeth Povinelli’s (2011) “enduring present”.\n\nTaking a presentist perspective on temporal dimensions of these affects, we can understand strength as a sensation that is intrinsically future-oriented: I feel strong because I am driven by expectations of the not-yet. Weariness, in turn, derives from the apprehension of past experiences becoming renewed in the present. For instance, in a high-speed train to Milano in September, I met a forty-year-old man with dense black curls who had come to Italy ten years before from Egypt. Doing unqualified jobs all along, the family father tells me that the pandemic has made life even more unmanageable than it was before. He never sees his kids and still struggles to make ends meet. His tiredness in the present is connected to the embodied experience of things constantly not turning out the way expected (not only in 2020), combined with the impossibility to rest and reorientate. His strength comes from his determination to live (or survive) rather than from the expectation of improving his lifestyle and values, as Conte promotes.\n\nThus, while there are uncountable reasons why one would post this meme, we can understand the particular motivation of the activist through the solidarity expressed with the Black Lives Matter movement. Their claims and disillusioned hopes are a form of “cruel optimism” (Berlant 2006), because they know that even the abolishment of the Bossi-Fini law would fail to truly break the ever repeating social and institutional mechanisms that keep them at the margins of society. In the light of this, Conte’s suggestion of finding peace through pausing appears like a farce. Anyways, the premier never said that the pandemic challenge would make society more just and inclusive.\n\nFeelings of exhaustion stem from the history of racial discrimination getting renewed in their everyday experience. This is even more so the case in a society like the Italian, where the tackling of racism and structural discrimination in the present is impeded by the denial of racist pasts (Heywood 2019). Yet, until the past – where the exhaustion has its origin – is not addressed, there can be no justice in the present. The idea of a peaceful future hinges on a strength that comes from the expectation of positive change, and not merely from the determination to live. No justice: tiredness - No peace: living on the edge of exhaustion.\n\nUnheard of: The Spanish Steps emptied of the smiles for the cameras of travellers, of the street vendors and their gadgets and of the whistles of the policemen and women chasing away those who unfortunately chose to sit down on the stairway.\n\nThis is June 2020 in Rome. The city is gently waking up from the slumber of lockdown. And not only are people re-discovering the possibility to exit their homes, after one of Europe’s strictest coronavirus containment measures. But they are also rediscovering their city and the squares, the parks, the fountains and even the outdoor terrazze in the windy alleyways between the Pantheon and Piazza Navona. Some people want to take this moment as an opportunity: reclaim the city! Take back the leases of those Airbnb flats! Others are concerned about the economic downturn brought about by the desertion of tourists.\n\nThe experience of an empty Rome was magical. I got to visit the Sistine Chapel, only bothered by about twenty other people. But it was also disconcerting. My fieldwork has nothing to do with tourists and did not involve meeting with large groups of people, even before the pandemic. However, the sudden absence of tourists in Rome, and the worries it brought about for many whose livelihoods depend on their presence struck me. Indeed, it greatly contrasted with my own fieldwork which pivots around the management of the absence or presence of another sort of ‘crowd’; migrants, the imagined invaders of Italy and Europe. The pandemic has not stopped those people from making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean.\n\nIn my research, I not only deal with the presence and absence of migrants, but also of the people who decide on their fate. I study the transnational governance of a maritime border zone, looking both at the architecture of externalisation policies and their effects in the Central Mediterranean. Conceptually, it is also about linking the absence of some fieldwork interlocutors based at the European Commission in Brussels or Italian Ministries in Rome to the space of the Central Mediterranean where their decisions have an impact on rescues and interceptions of migrants fleeing Libya, but where they, of course, are physically absent.\n\nMy fieldwork entailed a lot of waiting for busy officials and receiving countless refusals or rescheduling of brief meetings. Now, these people felt even more out of reach. Was COVID-19 set to become the best excuse of all, to not let the researcher in? In the months preceding the pandemic I had often had to make my way through the crowds of people on the Spanish Steps as I rushed to the precious interviews I had managed to secure. I was living at the Villa Maraini of the Istituto Svizzero – a five-minute walk from the top of the steps. Mid-March I had left Rome for Switzerland, amidst the pandemonium of the nascent pandemic. Fast-forward a few months later to June, when I returned for a few weeks and the steps were clear: I could run down them, undisturbed.\n\nBut there were no more meetings to which to run. The lawyers I had collaborated with had lodged complaints for the ways in which development funding had been used for the purpose of border externalisation projects in Libya. I had wanted to conduct court ethnographies to observe the outcomes of the cases but now due to COVID-19 related restrictions the court schedule had been disrupted and participating in the remaining sessions was no longer possible.\n\nNot all was bleak though. The limitations brought about by COVID-19 forced me to focus on what material I had already gathered. This was a welcome limitation to the hamster-like urge I had to continue collecting and collecting data, as a remedy for different fears which can hit the inexperienced doctoral researcher (the fear of having to start with the write-up phase, the feeling of not having an absolute command over the processes one is studying and that just this one more interview might provide the ounce more detail needed to describe a particular mechanism). Besides, the habit taken by some of the lawyers I worked with to hold all their meetings on Zoom made it easier to keep in contact and follow cases they are working on, even once I had left the Italian capital.\n\nThe empty Spanish Steps came to signify the double-edged sword of the Coronavirus for my fieldwork; the disruptions of the first COVID-19 wave had their advantages and disadvantages. It was yet another external (and uncontrollable) limitation which structured access to institutions and interlocutors who, even in the best of times, were not the easiest to get hold of. But the virus also stood for a limiting force which compelled me to accept the vagaries of conducting anthropological field research: sometimes it is better to just let go in the face of uncontrollability and search for the qualitative detail in what one already has.\n\n“Perlitas” (little pearls) refer to the string of bubbles that form around the rim of the glass when mezcal is poured. Perlitas are a sign of quality, the more the better. Mezcal is related to tequila and is particular to the state of Oaxaca in Mexico. Ricky, also known as “el chino” or “Mr Miyagi” (right), thinks of mezcal as his medicine, and after a couple of biscuits for breakfast to build up his defences he is ready to start drinking. Adán (left) is more of a connoisseur who knows everything about mezcal from beginning to end, including its preventative and curative qualities – basically it a cure for everything. They tend to come together every second or third day to reminisce about their youth and all the women they loved, watch the tourists pass by, and indulge in the pure pleasure of mezcal and its perlitas. A few mezcals at the end of the day just about cures any and all of their problems. Sometimes, especially for Ricky, it creates some new problems, for example when the next day he can’t find his keys or sunglasses, or when he finds the stinking fish in his backpack that he bought two days earlier and forgot to put in the fridge.\n\nRicky and Adán live on the coast of Oaxaca in a town called Puerto Escondido, which literally translates as “hidden port.” They have witnessed its transformation over the last decades from a remote and tiny port into a thriving tourist town, a tropical paradise. Originally Adán comes from the valley of Oaxaca, the home of mezcal, and he found himself here for work, driving supplies over the mountains in his truck. Ricky comes from the Philippines, although he spent much of his life in the USA, and he found himself here after escaping problems north of the border. Adán has a small income from renting out rooms to construction workers, and Ricky receives just enough to get by from his son in California.\n\nI got to know both of them doing fieldwork here and trying to understand how people get by in a tourist town. It was quite clear to me early on that there were aspects of the place that really were like paradise, and other aspects that were quite the opposite. It was also a place that seemed to attract an odd assortment of people, and it was often described to me affectionately as a bit of a “mental hospital”. Tourism seems to create these hard to grasp places. On the one hand, you can find all the worst aspects of a global industry that extracts and exploits value from nature and people’s daily lives and culture; and on the other hand, moments of joy, escape, pleasure, hope, novel encounter and celebration.\n\nYou could spend forever writing up the positives and negatives of tourism (does it do good or does it do bad?), but there is clearly a staging to it – with a frontstage or what we are meant to see and do, and a backstage with everything else. Think of the hotel cleaners that scurry in and out of rooms to create a pristine room. In Puerto the frontstage is clearly defined around the beach, bars and restaurants, and populated by the young, sexy and wealthy. Ricky and Adán are backstage due to their age and economic means, although they are always peeping their heads around the curtain to get a glimpse of the young girls parading up and down the street. Although they haven’t benefited in any great way from tourism they are not bitter. They have enough memories and adventures to reflect on and keep them satisfied.\n\nWhat I find interesting in a tourist town is the type of care that emerges in what should be a “care-free” place. When on holiday you are meant to leave all your cares behind and escape from work and daily concerns. While promoting this idyllic image, the industry has also embraced concerns around the ethics of travel and designed packages so that you can do “good” while away. In Puerto, for example, there are hostels where you can stay that offer surf lessons, that offer the chance to protect sea turtles and help orphans – then you are free in the evening to hit the bars and clubs. So these care-free places are in fact full of care, but it is a commoditised care that takes place on the front stage, where it is photographed and blogged and fed back into the marketing of the place.\n\nI guess what I am therefore interested in is the kind of care that takes place backstage, and how that interacts with more marketable forms of care. It is the care that sees Ricky shuffle over to Adán’s place for a few drinks, where Adán’s wife Mercedes always makes sure that Ricky has something to eat. Of course she disapproves of all the drinking but she knows it is also part of a shared gesture of care between the two. The perlitas offer a moment of promise and a daily cure in a mad world.\n\nHave you ever heard that crows can live for 200 years? I always find them very mysterious with their dark feathers. But I’ve never seen so many of them until I went to Kars, a city located in northeast Turkey near the Armenian border. With its controversial past engraved on its distinctive urban facade, Kars was so beautiful that it captured me quickly. Reflecting on the dark times crows might have witnessed in this magical space, I wholeheartedly fell for the rumour.\n\nI took this photo from a dull dorm room in Kars where I have stayed during the first weeks of my fieldwork in Autumn 2009. Back then, residents of the city were very much occupied with the normalisation protocols signed between the governments of Armenia and Turkey, which might have resulted in the opening of the Doğukapı/Akhourian border crossing that was closed since 1993. Although the crossing had long remained closed, people and goods have found imaginative ways to travel between the two countries—airspace, and through Georgia or Iran and Nakhichevan. The sealed border had negatively impacted the border provinces, Gyumri and Kars in Armenia and Turkey respectively, which are only 80 km away from each other. A Kurdish man from Kars I encountered once was so furious about the situation caused by the unquestionable power of central governments on communities living by the border and even his sarcastic tone could not hide it:\n\n“There are problems with all borders. But we don’t have any with ours - because it is closed! And it was not us who closed it. Some people, who don’t even live here, decided to open it and then decided to close it again. How great, isn't it? We don’t have any saying on how to regulate relationships with our neighbours in our daily lives!”\n\nDuring intense negotiations on the border crossing, a group of people working for the local television station from Gyumri visited Kars. Their task was to report on Kars and Karsians, a city and its peoples mostly unknown to their audience and I was to accompany them as the curious young researcher. As soon as the journalists appeared on the streets with their cameras, a couple of curious people surrounded us, welcoming the guests and posing questions. The journalists explained that they wanted to know more about their 'neighbours' and what they thought of the protocols, which somehow promised the opening of the borders in the near future. Conversations were casual and yet careful. They exchanged jokes and good wishes but also shared concerns about the burning issue, the Armenian genocide.\n\nAll of a sudden, however, an old man appeared and loudly addressed the Armenian group, accusing them of ‘murdering’ his ancestors. Due to his exaggerated gestures and loud voice, I expected a dispute between the groups. And yet, there was no tension at all. Karsians laughed at the old man and told the Armenian visitors that he was “deli (insane)”. Afterwards, journalists recorded some street interviews with the same people and returned to Gyumri. Two months later, a number of journalists from a local TV station of Kars went to Gyumri for the same purpose. They produced a documentary emphasising the similarity in architecture and lifestyle between two cities.\n\nYears later, in Yerevan, I told about this story during a public conference. As I finished my talk, though, an old man in the audience stood up and shouted at me in Armenian. He was angry because, for him, it was nonsense to talk about a border within so-called Eastern Armenia. He said, it was all Armenian land before the genocide, and he could not care less what Turks in Kars said about the border today. How dared I to talk about it in such casual ways in Yerevan? I heard this much until the translator stopped. Some people in the room intervened by laughter and suppressed the voice of the old man, while others were visibly upset and empathised with him. Meanwhile, the moderator told him that his response was not different than the man in my example. This statement was the only possible answer that I could also think of at that moment.\n\nA comparative ethnographic study on the closed Armenia-Turkey border and the people living in neighbour cities Gyumri and Kars would be illuminating to understand how they interpret the past, the present and the future. Clearly, neither of the two old men nor the incidents involving them I witnessed are the same. But the narratives they hold on to are. It does not matter whether the lifespan of a crow is at most a couple of decades. Their crows live for centuries and still fly in their sky. And - ten years after I completed my research in the region, a comparative ethnography of this kind is still waiting to be done.\n\n(The project’s blog is still online: https://karsandothers.wordpress.com/)\n\nMatondoni, Lamu Island, Kenya: A few fishing boats surrounded by tropical mangrove forests and white beaches. It slowly dawns and after a long day at sea, the fishermen set up the camp for the night. They sleep either on the traditional dhows (wooden-hulled ships) or at the beach. That’s a very idyllic picture that shows these fishermen on their way home of our sailing trip around Lamu Island. But appearances are deceptive. Only about 10km further north the large scale Lamu Port has been under construction for seven years as part of the LAPSSET project (Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor). While this huge port is being promoted as part of this mega infrastructure project that is compatible with the Sustainable Development Goals (especially goal 9 “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”), it is destroying a sustainable fishery and undermining a local common property system.\n\nSince the launch of the project, great development promises were made, also for local people. Thus, hopes and expectations were raised. But now seven years later fishermen and inhabitants of Lamu are disappointed and afraid for their future as promises of compensations for the loss of their fishery commons by the new port do not materialize. In my research in Lamu during January till February this year, it turned out that the current discussions in the fishing community mostly focus on the promised compensation payments. Apparently, such payments have been promised before construction started, but so far nothing has happened. Instead the negotiations have been resumed several times. There are many rumours about these compensation payments as well. Everyone has somehow heard about them, but nobody really knows how high the amount should be and who gets these payments and when. On the other hand, the impact of the new Lamu port for the fishermen is drastic: The biggest problems at the moment, but also in the future, are occurring during the rainy season. In this time of the year it is not possible to fish in the open sea, because the big waves are too dangerous for the small vessels or un-motorized sailing boats of the fishermen. Until now it was possible to fish in the canals during these months. But the construction of the port led to the destruction and pollution of a large area of these canals that had formerly sustained the fishermen during these times. In addition, there are also many fishermen who are specialized in prawn, lobster and crab fishing. These are often found in the mangroves and have to be partly caught with the diving method. But since a large part of the mangroves around the port have been cleared the water is dirty in most of the previous fishing areas. As a consequence, these fishermen are unable to see anything when diving. The pollution of the water also leads to a reduction in stocks and their disappearance. Therefore, local people in Lamu are disappointed and angry. The community is now looking for ways to defend itself and to enforce its rights to their common fisheries but negotiations about compensation for water and fisheries, which are now considered to be state property, are very difficult as water cannot be calculated in the same way as land. Fish stocks are not visible and also not static. Apparently the Malindi High Court ordered the national government one year ago to compensate the fishermen with $ 16.8 Mio after deciding that the project did not meet the basic constitutional and legal requirements. The construction of the port project violated the cultural rights of the community and the right to a clean and healthy environment. However, representatives of the fishing community believe that the Ksh1.76 billion is not enough. That’s why the fishermen are asking now the government to increase the compensation payment from $ 16.8 Mio. to $ 28.6 Mio. But the negotiations are still pending. At the moment they have no choice but to continue to insist on their rights and to wait.\n\nWhen I enjoyed the evening atmosphere in our dhow on the day the picture was taken and watched the fishermen sailing by while they were cooking and preparing themselves for the night, all the challenges that the fishermen were already confronted with or will be confronted during the construction of the Lamu port came to my mind. Therefore, a bad feeling developed in me. Because at that time I was already aware of many of the fishermen's concerns. For example, most of them did not have any education opportunities and therefore almost only fishing was a possibility for them. But especially the older generation will not get a chance to find another job without education. One interview partner mentioned that \"if you have no education and you are not able to speak English, you can work as a fisherman. But that won't work now anymore\". However, it is very unclear, if good education will guarantee a job as a replacement for the grabbed fisheries. For me as a social anthropologist it is important to know and show the fears and hopes of the fishermen and to deal with these stories. But as a friend and tourist it became more and more difficult for me to experience the same hopelessness and anxiety over and over again and still not be able to help.\n\nOn further processes of commons grabbing see the special issue in the journal LAND by Tobias Haller, Mariah Ngutu and Fabian Käser (Eds) Does Commons Grabbing lead to Resilience Grabbing? The Anti-Politics Machine of Neo-Liberal Agrarian Development and Local Responses\n\nin which several members of the Institute of Social Anthropology have published.\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/land/special_issues/landgrabbing\n\nThe auditorium of the Ajtté museum on Sami culture and the Swedish Fjäll region is packed to the last seat. I find Ellen here, the charismatic protagonist of my film ‘Älven min Vän, My Friend the River’. She is wearing a traditional Sami costume and her hair is curled up, she wears a pair of red glasses and carries a length of cloth upon her shoulders held by a silver brooch. The protagonist Eva Stina is here, too, with her husband Gunnar, who made the most beautiful gloves for me during my fieldwork. And so is Mandy, the singer whose song about the Lule river featured as my film’s main theme.\n\nI am nervous, because I’m screening my film for the first time in the area where it was made, in the context of the 416th ‘Jokkmokks Marknad’ Sami culture festival. The film’s protagonists are present, as well as locals who know about the situation here—in other words, the local experts. How will they react to the film? Or to me, as a researcher from the outside world?\n\nI had already had these questions on my mind while I sat on the 36-hour train journey from Bern to Jokkmokk. Every hour brought me closer to the Arctic Circle, the snow cover growing deeper even as the shadows lengthened and temperatures plummeted. It is -30 degrees in Jokkmokk when I arrive in a town that, on this occasion, is no longer merely a hamlet of 2000 inhabitants. 40,000 visitors come here to the culture festival over the course of three days, and I am one of them.\n\nI go to the Ajtté museum on the final day of the festival, for the screening of my film. I’m surprised by the fact that the show is sold out. One of my friends was unable to obtain a ticket and said, ‘I’m just not used to something being sold out in Jokkmokk.’\n\nFollowing a short introduction, we settle in to watch the film. The events that follow are difficult for me to formulate here: the audience get to their feet and start clapping. A man with tears in his eyes says, ‘Thank you so much for this movie. I understand why the young woman spoke. It is fantastic that you have been able to get the older women to speak and tell their story.’\n\nTwo things were foremost in my mind while I conducted my research: the fact that I worked on an indigenous topic, and my responsibility to the cast. To this day science has worked by telling indigenous people their own stories, rather than permitting them to tell the stories themselves. Those who write the texts or edit the movies are the ones who have power over content. Nobody in Jokkmokk had been waiting for me as an ‘outsider’ to come and research them. By doing so, aren’t I simply perpetuating a colonial relationship?\n\nAnother thing that was on my mind was that I, as a researcher, was picking up knowledge and that I wanted to return it in a different format. My cast is supposed to see the point in participating in the film project. I didn’t want to simply extract knowledge from them to then give it back to them as a ‘gift’. My intention had been to return a part of the research results to the cast when we watched the movie together, yet the effect that the movie has had changes my mind and makes me wonder who, precisely, was returning something, and to whom. One spectator said: ‘The fact that somebody makes the effort to learn the language and how to make a film, and then becomes acquainted with the topics as well as taking a train to watch the film with us, shows us our importance and the value of our story.’ Christine’s words also touch me when she says, ‘I thank you so much that you decided to make this film. It’s fantastic that you wanted to make the women’s voices and thoughts audible. And I am very happy that I chose to be a part of all of this.’\n\nMaybe it is less about returning something to people than about sharing something with them; in my case, this refers to influential encounters, shared stories, warmth and respect. I am left with great appreciation and deepest gratitude to the four women whose lives and river I was allowed to portray.\n\nThis project has also served to emphasise my belief that science should pay more attention to the medium of film, because it represents a form of knowledge that is accessible, easily applied and popular.\n\nWhen I return to Bern I find a thick envelope on my desk. The ‘Post Nord’ stamp is visible from a distance; the letter is clasped with a familiar brooch:\n\n‘Thank you for the recent evening in Jokkmokk. It was nice to see you again and I had the feeling that ‘two souls’ were meeting each other again. Hannah, to remind you of me, I want to give you the silver brooch that has accompanied me on all of my journeys as well as all of my festive but also sorrowful moments. We will continue to be in contact, won’t we? Many hugs from Ellen.’\n\nDuring a walk through Kalamoti I am greeted by many open front doors, although this is no warm welcome, for the houses have been abandoned. An icy wind blows through the roads; trash is piled amongst the ruins and there are dead sparrows, mice and even a desiccated cat, mouth gaping and eyes gone. It is morbid yet fascinating scenery. The uninhabited rooms and their colourful walls tell of livelier times, and they inspire me. Entering abandoned houses means entering the ‘world of imagination’ described by Yael Navaro-Yashin (2009: 2). Abandoned objects such as the kitchen stove, the mouldy couch or rotten shelves in a cupboard prove that this is no museum, and it is easy to picture how people once lived in these houses.\n\nI step back into the street and surprise a half-dozen cats that were hiding from the wind in the lee of the doorway. A stray hunting-dog passes by, its collar still attached. I try to photograph the animals, but fail because they flee from my camera before I can snap them. Instead, I try with my camera to capture the veil of melancholy draped across this village.\n\nMany of the houses and shops are up for sale. Sometimes this is announced by way of a piece of paper recently stuck in a dusty window, and sometimes it was painted on the wall by the door decades ago. Many of Kalamoti’s former inhabitants left long ago, and some of the houses have been derelict for more than a century. They left when the Greek island of Chios was struck by an earthquake; still more left following the financial crisis of 2008. Recently even the butcher moved to a larger town in search of more prosperity. Those who remain live amongst the ruins.\n\nOnce in a while a door is opened and one hears Jassas, or Kalimera. An elderly couple leave their house and limp around the next corner—they have put their restaurant up for sale even as they wait for customers every evening before they turn off the lights at midnight. Their names are Despina, Janis, Thomas, Vangelis, and they linger in Kalamoti, waiting for summer to come.\n\n‘In summer all of my school friends return from Athens, Germany or the US. Then we remember the times when our village lived off the mastic trees. The mastic resin defined village life over the cycle of a year, from the cutting of the bark and collecting of the resin to its sorting by size and quality.’ That is what Despina tells us while we sit in her tavern, where we are her only guests.\n\nThe tears of Chios, as the sap of the mastic tree is called, have been collected on this Greek island for over 2500 years and formed the basis of the island’s former wealth. During the Ottoman occupation, mastic was worth its weight in gold. Mastic villages like Kalamoti still exist, but these days their economic survival depends on far more than the legendary resin.\n\nI came to Chios to find out about the mastic, not in the interest of conducting field research but to gather some fresh air and find inspiration for my research project during a short break. Kalamoti, however, captivated me, in particular the way life here has clung on beside and between the ruins. The melancholy of the place, but also of those who live in the ruins, wouldn’t let go of me.\n\nThe things I see here are uninfluenced by scientific intention, yet my consciousness connects and orders snapshots into a chain of cause and effect. My innocent encounter with Kalamoti has provoked a reflective process in me that is influenced by two elements: the intuitive feeling to be standing in a research field that is concrete, tangible, characterisable; and the implicit knowledge of being able to place this in a larger and more general context. The methods of social anthropology permit me to process the things I find here, and my encounter begins to provoke questions in my mind: What are the effects of the ruins on the people of the village and on their social relationships? Which reflexes or reactions do the ruins provoke in locals? From inspiration to research question, from description to induction and abstraction: this is precisely how research can find its inception—even before you notice it yourself.\n\nLiteratur:\n\nNavaro-Yashin, Yael. 2009: Affective Spaces, Melancholic Objects: Ruination and the Production of Anthropological Knowledge. In: The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 15(1), S. 1–18.\n\nThe fascist symbolism that infuses the collection of wine bottles in this picture tends to evoke discomfort or disgust—but not in the collectors themselves. I took this picture of a shelf of wine bottles that had been collected over many years in a meeting room in Predappio in April 2014, in the context of my research into the Italian neo-fascist milieu. Predappio is the small town in northern Italy where Benito Mussolini was born and where his body is interred. It is a site of pilgrimage for hundreds of people from the fascist milieu, who go there to pay homage to Mussolini as a martyr for the fascist cause. In 2014 I accompanied a group of neo-fascists from Rome who visited the site on the anniversary of Mussolini’s death. Following the commemoration service it was in this meeting room that a communal lunch was organised. The reason why the picture contains only wine bottles rather than people is due to the exceedingly difficult nature of the research setting: taking photos of people gave my informants the impression that I was a potential spy, for example for the secret services—an accusation that drastically complicated my access to the research field.\n\nIn 2012-2013 I conducted research on the neo-fascist scene in Rome, and this was followed by several short visits until 2015. As a German researcher raised in an anti-fascist environment, such research amongst Italian neo-fascists was never going to be easy; over the course of many months, only few people would speak with me and most evaded me or accused me of espionage. It was a long process for me to be able to move freely within my research field and gain acceptance as a researcher from a different political background. At the outset I was threatened and told not to photograph any of the neo-fascist meetings I attended. It was only towards the end of my research trip that I was able to take pictures of any of the members for my personal use, albeit rarely and only of people with whom I had established a trusting relationship. Instead, I had to limit myself to taking pictures of objects (such as, for example, the collection of bottles in Predappio)—nostalgia-inducing kitsch of great importance to many within the milieu. All of these photos have their own story for me, specifically a story about people I was not allowed to photograph and who I would precisely describe every evening in my field journal, in the interest of recording my encounters with them and thereby recording an image of them for myself.\n\nSince Italy became an EU core country governed by a populist rightwing coalition in June 2018, the neo-fascist scene of the country has come under increased public scrutiny again. The government consists of comedian Beppe Grillo’s populist, euro-sceptic Movimento Cinque Stelle party and the Lega, which in a national context has shown itself to be an extremist, rightwing, racist party and is connected to neo-fascist parties. Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini belongs to the Lega and is staunchly anti-immigration, making for headlines throughout Europe for closing Italian ports to ships that carry migrants from the Mediterranean. Ever since the recent successes in regional elections of rightwing, neo-fascist political parties that explicitly relate themselves to historical fascism, as well as since the racist incidents of 2017 and early 2018 and the victories of the Lega at the national level, journalists and politicians have been speaking of an onda nera, a ‘black wave’ (‘black’ denoting ‘fascism’ in Italy). The rise of the right provokes questions over the genesis of such political phenomena.\n\nThe journey to Predappio and the people I met in that meeting room and whose stories I heard are an important element in the answer to this question. Alongside members of the neo-fascist scene of all ages, I also encountered a Catholic priest, who was a member of a traditionally-minded Catholic order that has contacts to the neo-fascist political scene. He was one of those who regularly attended Mussolini’s commemoration services as well as one of the people in charge of the meeting room. He was also a member of a group founded in the early 1990s which regarded itself as the successor to the Cult of Madonna established in the 1930s by the fascist regime. Both the martyr cult surrounding Mussolini (which includes such commemorations on the anniversary of his death as I witnessed in Predappio’s meeting room), as well as especially this Catholic priest’s tales of the Cult of Madonna made me aware of the importance of the religious dimension of post-war fascism which, since 1945, has established itself as a counter-culture to the predominant anti-fascism of mainstream society. Both of these cults belong within this religious dimension and are to be found on a spectrum that stretches from Catholicism to pagan rituals. Family and social networks developed since 1945 are an important characteristic of Italian post-war fascism; neo-fascism’s religious dimension crucially strengthens the integrity of these structures, which underlie the political scene. It is in this context that we can understand the stabilising factor inherent in the support provided by a number of deeply conservative Catholic orders.\n\nSeen from this perspective, the current political situation in Italy is not only a reaction to the immigration crisis or other contemporary challenges. Post-war fascism’s networks still exist, just as do the old meeting rooms and private collections of fascist kitsch—and they have become more visible in today’s political situation. Post-war fascism has reclaimed centre-stage and reveals a network that no longer needs to struggle to organise itself: the Lega has shown itself to be a party able to mobilise the political scene of rightwing populists as well as neo-fascists and bring them together, thereby pushing the entire country to the right.\n\n“La Paz” is Spain’s best hospital, and possibly one of the best in Europe, according to a communiqué from the Comunidad de Madrid which, in March 2018, announced a complete refurbishment of the dilapidated university hospital. To this day, La Paz symbolises the epitome of Spanish medicine. Established in 1964 by Dictator Francisco Franco, 25 years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, its name means ‘peace’. At the time La Paz was Spain’s most modern public hospital, and it was to provide Spain’s population with sophisticated medical services. This dream of efficient medical care for everybody is embodied by the architecture of a by-gone future, as well as by the fact that it treats almost 300,000 patients annually. The hospital is no longer new, and it is not only the physical facade of the medical dream that has begun to crumble.\n\nOn a cold morning in winter I am waiting in front of La Paz for Luis, a member of the union who works there. In the deep blue skies above Madrid I can see the four skyscrapers that have encircled La Paz for ten years. The ‘Quatro Torres Business Area’ was completed right before the Spanish real-estate crisis of 2008. Ten years later, the fifth tower is finally going to be built. ‘The private model is in the process of gobbling up the public model,’ Luis says, smiling ironically and pointing at the skyscrapers. The fifth tower is designed to contain a large, brand-new, private hospital. ‘From up there we must look like a slum, like dirt. We need to leave. They don’t want us here.’ Luis is an orderly and has worked at La Paz’s emergency ward since 1997. We had been planning this interview for some time already, in the wake of my research on austerity medicine and the resistance movements against the cutting of public funds in the health sector.\n\nOn our way to the union offices we pass the emergency ward. Luis takes me to the rear entrance, where mountains of laundry and trash from the hospital are collected every day. ‘Now you get to see the guts of the hospital,’ he jokes before we descend to the clinical underworld. We make our way along corridors marked by chipped plaster, through a labyrinth of stairwells, elevators and thick pipes that are always being patched up; we pass the staff cafeteria and squeeze against the walls so as to make room for carts of laundry, and arrive at the union’s quarters. The faded ochre of the walls is hidden by countless posters that call for resistance to precarious work contracts, the patriarchy, and cuts: “Los recortes matan”—the cuts kill—is printed on a sheet of paper. In the union’s office, which is a couple of square metres in size and has a single window, Luis describes the work routines of carers, kitchen staff, cleaners and orderlies. He talks about their fear of the ‘void’ of unemployment in times of ‘generalised crisis’, when work contracts are becoming shorter and ever more precarious; he tells of constant pressure during work due to the fact that colleagues on sick leave are no longer replaced; the creeping reduction of chores and sense in work, provoked by outsourcing and automation in the laundry rooms and kitchens.\n\nLuis talks about the situation of those who often work invisibly in La Paz’s clinical underground. This is the place that enables the functioning of treatment upstairs in the hospital’s wards; and it is where the effects of cuts and privatisation are most palpable. The clinical underground is the ‘base’ of medicine, in terms of Marxist terminology, and the site where, in Luis’s words, ‘the introduction of a factory’s methods of production’ become tangible in contemporary economical conditions and medical organisation. ‘Since the crisis struck, this has increased massively. What they’re looking for here is profitability, but that is difficult to achieve when you’re dealing with people.’\n\nI had hoped for Luis’s help in gaining access to everyday hospital life in La Paz, so that I could observe how sickness and treatment were lived at a time of such generalised economisation. I planned to be guided through my field research by the point of view of doctors, nurses, patients and orderlies, in order to examine the small and unspectacular spread of the effects of austerity on hospital life and hospital infrastructure, ethnographically and beyond a predetermined medical framework. In La Paz, however, access to clinical everyday life both above and below ground was denied to me. Possibly, my research interest was not sufficiently medical for La Paz, or possibly it was too political. ‘There is a general atmosphere of distrust and fear here,’ Luis kept on saying. ‘The hospital is a bunker.’\n\nFor medical anthropologists who examine the political, social and economic conditions of sickness, medicine and healing, access to the highly controlled world of hospitals is far from straightforward. This is even more true if their ethnography is not guided by a medically informed research question. In terms of ethics and politics, hospitals are strictly regulated spaces that frequently resist the gaze of outsiders. In his “Ways of Seeing”, John Berger says of such gazing: ‘We only see what we look at. To look is an act of choice. As a result of this act, what we see is brought within our reach.’ I chose to observe not only medicine and sickness in hospitals, but also to gaze at the economics and politics of everyday medical life in hospitals. I was able to see some things, even while other elements remained hidden. Despite the difficulties of gaining insight, I did learn much about La Paz as well as other hospitals. More than mere medical institutions, they are enigmatic, symbolically charged sites that combine decay, dirt and fragility with illusions, hope and crude everyday work. Yet, they are indeed also bunkers that can often resist curious gazes that aim to illuminate their inner life.\n\nWhen he sent me the picture above on WhatsApp during one of his night shifts, Luis captioned it with ‘Greetings from the Bunker’ and added a smiley. He’s also a photographer, and together we entertain dreams of an illustrated volume on the bowels of this fascinating bunker. Maybe this will become reality one day.\n\nI took this picture on the last day of my fieldwork on Saturday the 28th of July 2012. The previous months were shaped by the same routine. Every Wednesday and Saturday I would get up at 8:30 am. Twenty minutes for breakfast and another ten to get to the prison. Whilst standing in the slow-moving visitor’s queue, I often sought to picture the last day of fieldwork, particularly when I was not in the mood for spending another day in the bare cement building of Chorrillos maximum-security prison for women located in the south of Lima. In summer this place was boiling hot and in winter it was freezing cold. Before entering prison, I am stamped four times – not on a piece of paper, but on my flesh. The stamps are there to remind me of the modes and modalities of prison and who is in charge. The green number indicates the compartment in which my ID card is stored for the duration of the visit; the letter indicates the pavilion I am visiting; and each search officer has a personal stamp to mark that I entered during their shift (for one, a picture of a toddler). At times I felt so tired of the weight this place was capable of laying on me – a heaviness made of social frustrations, fears, and disgust that society hides away with barbed wire and walls that reach the sky. But unlike the prisoners, it was my choice to spend time here and most significantly, at the end of the day I would be able to leave again. I had come to see Lucero, Mili and Ana. The three of them were forced to a life in prison for their militancy in the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary movement, which is one of two insurgent groups that declared war against the Peruvian state during the internal armed conflict (1980-2000). Together, we had made a research-led film that would become integral part of my doctoral project. The purpose of the film was to look closely at the ways in which the conflict is remembered by different actors: insurgents, members of the armed forces and victim-survivors. But unlike my engagement with former soldiers and human rights activists, the stories told by my informants in prison were constantly subject to adaptations, mutilations, or silences. During the filmmaking process Lucero, Mili and Ana were mainly concerned with protecting themselves, their families and me. Most questions evolved around what could be said publicly and how, in order to avoid upsetting the authorities and their official narratives in which the government, the state and its executive authority are celebrated not only as victors, but as national heroes. The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation commission and much of the research that followed clearly challenged and still challenges these official narratives by locating the responsibility for the violence inflicted on civilians on all sides and by tracing the causes within the socio-political landscape at the time. Yet, until today Lucero and Ana remain in prison (Mili was released in 2016).\n\nThe price for upsetting prison authorities at the time were shorter visiting times for family and friends, additional restrictions on food and cash deliveries, on yard time, educational or recreational activities as well as fewer courtesies. In the worst of all cases new proceedings would have been opened with the possible outcome of longer prison sentences. For me, it could have meant a complete ban from prison and the end of my research, but also, I could have been accused of ‘defending terrorism’, which since 2017 and the modification of law N° 30610 of the penal code (with the addition of article 316-A), is a punishable crime with prison sentences of up to eight years. There was no question about it – we had to adapt our methodology to suit these circumstances. The camera never passed the prison walls and only their voice-over narrations were recorded over the phone. Interviews were forbidden, so we designed their narrations as inner dialogues: intimate, personal, subjective. No politics, no historical descriptions, only their individual narrations ju"
