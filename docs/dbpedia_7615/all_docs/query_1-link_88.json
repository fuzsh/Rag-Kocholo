The young Jacobson presented Straus with a libretto for 'Ein Walzertraum' at a coffee house in the Vienna Prater in 1906. Straus was inspired by the text and completed the work within 12 months for its premiere in the spring of 1907 at the Carltheater in Vienna. Vally Worth (on the card written as Wordt) played the role of Annerl, a member of the Ladies' band. \n\t\n\tFollowing the success of 'Ein Walzertraum' in Vienna, productions of the work, under the name 'A Waltz Dream', were mounted in English for premieres in 1908 at the Chestnut Street Opera House in Philadelphia, in New York City at the now-demolished Broadway Theatre, and in London at the Hicks Theatre, starring Gertie Millar, W. H. Berry and later Robert Evett, Jessie Broughton and Arthur Williams. Lily Elsie and Amy Evans starred in the 1911 revival at Daly's Theatre. The international success of the operetta exceeded Straus's expectations. In 1907, there was already a short film version, Ein Walzertraum (1907) with Fritz Werner. According to IMDb, it was the first film made and shown in Austria. Other film versions of the operetta include the Hungarian film Varázskeringő/Magic Waltz (Michael Curtiz, 1918) with Victor Varconi, the German film Ein Walzer Traum/A Waltz Dream (Ludwig Berger, 1925) with Willy Fritsch, Mady Christians und Xenia Desni, and The Smiling Lieutenant (Ernst Lubitsch, 1931), starring Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert.\n\t\n\tSources: Wikipedia (English and German) and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
