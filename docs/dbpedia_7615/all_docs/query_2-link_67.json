        "text": "Claudette Colbert, the versatile stage and film star whose flair for light comedy cheered audiences during the Depression and for decades afterward, died yesterday at Belle-rive, her home on the island of Barbados. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.\n\nMiss Colbert's wit, gaiety, cupid's-bow mouth and light touch took her from the Art Students League in New York to the height of stardom on Broadway and in Hollywood. She is best remembered for screwball comedies in which, no matter what situation befell her, she usually managed to keep her aplomb and good humor. Her greatest triumph was playing a runaway heiress opposite Clark Gable's cynical reporter in Frank Capra's film comedy \"It Happened One Night,\" a performance that won her an Academy Award as best actress in 1934.\n\nShe could appear worldly and sophisticated yet down to earth, a quality that, combined with attention to camera angles, lighting and other technical details, helped her to sustain a remarkably durable career encompassing more than 60 films and many stage appearances.\n\nIn 1981, in her seventh decade in show business, the New York Times critic Frank Rich, praising her performance in the Broadway flop \"A Talent for Murder,\" called her \"a lady of piquant, irrepressible, ever-so-amusing common sense.\" He cited \"her big Betty Boop eyes, curly light hair\" and \"her low, one-of-the-boys voice, effortlessly hurling asides like pool balls into every pocket of the house.\"\n\n\"Audiences always sound like they're glad to see me, and I'm damned glad to see them,\" Miss Colbert told an interviewer in 1978. \"If they want you, you want to do it. The feeling never dies.\"\n\nFrom 'The Lady Lies' To the Milk of Asses\n\nMiss Colbert had her first film success in 1929, as the heroine of the talkie \"The Lady Lies.\" Her early notable films, all box-office hits, included \"The Smiling Lieutenant\" (1931), a wistful Ernst Lubitsch comedy; \"The Sign of the Cross,\" a 1932 Cecil B. DeMille spectacular in which she played Nero's sensuous empress Poppaea, and the 1934 production of \"Cleopatra,\" in which she played the title role.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
