Around 41% of its population were born outside the UK,[1] and over 300 languages are spoken in the region.[2][3]\n\nHistory and ethnic breakdown of London\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of London's history, the population of the city was ethnically homogenous with the population being of White British ethnic origin, with small clusters of minority groups such as Jewish people, most notably in areas of the East End. From 1948 onwards and especially since the Blair government in the late 1990s and 2000s, the population has diversified in international terms at an increased rate. In 2011, it was reported for the first time that White British people had become a minority within the city, establishing it was a majority-minority city within the country. In 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages spoken and 50 non-indigenous communities with a population of more than 10,000 in London.[4]\n\nEthnic Group Year 1961 estimations[5][6] 1971 estimations[7][8] 1981 estimations[9] 1991 census[10][11] 2001 census[12] 2011 census[13] 2021 census[14] Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % White: Total 7,602,233 97.7% 6,901,596 92.6% 5,893,973 86.6% 5,333,580 79.80% 5,103,203 71.15% 4,887,435 59.79% 4,731,172 53.8% White: British[Note 1] – – 6,500,000 87% – – – – 4,287,861 59.79% 3,669,284 44.89% 3,239,281 36.8% White: Irish – – 401,596 5.4% – – 256,470 3.83% 220,488 3.07% 175,974 2.15% 156,333 1.8% White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller[Note 2] – – – – – – – – 8,196 0.10% 7,031 0.1% White: Roma – – – – – – – – – – 37,689 0.4% White: Other[Note 1] – – – – – – 594,854 8.29% 1,033,981 12.65% 1,290,838 14.7% Asian or Asian British: Total – – – – 425,426 6.3% 690,031 10.33% 946,894 13.20% 1,511,546 18.49% 1,817,640 20.8% Asian or Asian British: Indian – – – – 232,881 – 347,091 5.19% 436,993 6.09% 542,857 6.64% 656,272 7.5% Asian or Asian British: Pakistani – – – – 59,440 – 87,816 1.31% 142,749 1.99% 223,797 2.74% 290,549 3.3% Asian or Asian British: Bangladeshi – – – – 41,792 – 85,738 1.28% 153,893 2.15% 222,127 2.72% 322,054 3.7% Asian or Asian British: Chinese[Note 3] – – – – 35,938 – 56,579 0.84% 80,201 1.12% 124,250 1.52% 147,520 1.7% Asian or Asian British: Other Asian – – – – 55,375 – 112,807 1.68% 133,058 1.86% 398,515 4.88% 401,245 4.6% Black or Black British: Total – – – – 405,394 6% 535,216 8.01% 782,849 10.92% 1,088,640 13.32% 1,188,370 13.5% Black or Black British: African – – – – 102,230 – 163,635 2.44% 378,933 5.28% 573,931 7.02% 697,054 7.9% Black or Black British: Caribbean – – – – 239,956 – 290,968 4.35% 343,567 4.79% 344,597 4.22% 345,405 3.9% Black or Black British: Other Black – – – – 63,208 – 80,613 1.20% 60,349 0.84% 170,112 2.08% 145,911 1.7% Mixed or British Mixed: Total[Note 1] – – – – – – – – 226,111 3.15% 405,279 4.96% 505,775 5.7% Mixed: White and Black Caribbean – – – – – – – – 70,928 0.99% 119,425 1.46% 132,555 1.5% Mixed: White and Black African – – – – – – – – 34,182 0.48% 65,479 0.80% 77,341 0.9% Mixed: White and Asian – – – – – – – – 59,944 0.84% 101,500 1.24% 125,188 1.4% Mixed: Other Mixed – – – – – – – – 61,057 0.85% 118,875 1.45% 170,691 1.9% Other: Total – – – – 80,793 1.2% 120,872 1.81% 113,034 1.58% 281,041 3.44% 556,768 6.3% Other: Arab[Note 2] – – – – – – – – – – 106,020 1.30% 139,791 1.6% Other: Any other ethnic group – – – – – – – – 113,034 1.58% 175,021 2.14% 416,977 4.7% Non-White: Total 179,109 2.3% 547,588 7.4% 911,626 13.5% 1,346,119 20.2% 2,068,888 28.85% 3,286,506 40.2% 4,068,553 46.2% Total 7,781,342 100% 7,449,184 100% 6,805,599 100% 6,679,699 100.00% 7,172,091 100.00% 8,173,941 100.00% 8,799,725 100%\n\nRacial breakdown of London\n\n[edit]\n\nWhite population of London\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the 2021 census, the total White population of London stood at 3.2 million.[15]\n\nAs of the 2011 census: White British Population White Irish Population White Gypsy/Irish Traveller Population Other White Population Total White Population Inner London 1,130,882 66,808 1,946 534,723 1,853,209 Outer London 2,429,018 100,809 5,141 499,258 3,034,226 London 3,669,284 175,974 8,196 1,033,981 4,887,435\n\nWhites form a majority of London's population and are evenly spread.

Other waves followed, such as Lebanese fleeing the civil war. The centre of London has a thriving Arab community, centred around Edgware Road.[23]\n\nBangladeshis\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: British Bangladeshi\n\nA major wave of immigration began in the 1970s, as people from the Sylhet Division arrived in London, fleeing poverty and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Many settled around Spitalfields, where they entered the textile trade. This trade has declined causing unemployment, but the community has moved into other businesses, including restaurants and banking. The level of immigration peaked in 1986 and has since entered a decline with the introduction of stricter immigration laws.\n\nThe community remains concentrated around Whitechapel and has spread into other east London boroughs. London as a city is home to the single largest number of people of Bangladeshi origin outside of Bangladesh, with close to 200,000 individuals being of full Bangladeshi origin in 2007.\n\nThe community also annually hosts Europe's largest outdoor Asian event known as the Boishakhi Mela in Bethnal Green as part of the Bengali New Year celebrations.\n\nChinese\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chinese community in London\n\nFurther information: British Chinese and Chinatown, London\n\nChinese people constitute the fourth largest Asian group in London (behind the Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis respectively); numbering 114,800 in 2007, they are spread more or less across the entire city and have become successful in British life, especially when it comes to cuisine. The history of the Chinese in London is long and complex, with the first Chinese people arriving in the city in the 19th century as sailors.\n\nGermans\n\n[edit]\n\nFiona Moore, author of \"The German School in London, UK: Fostering the Next Generation of National Cosmopolitans?\", wrote that the London German community \"relies on subtle network connections rather than the displaying of obvious membership traits\", since London Germans attended the same churches, joined the same clubs, and sent their children to the same schools.[24] According to Moore this aspect was likely influenced by the outcomes of World War I and World War II, resulting in encouragement for UK-based Germans \"to try to blend in to a greater degree than elsewhere.\"[24]\n\nThe German business and expatriate community is centred on the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, which houses the German School London (DSL) and most German expatriates residing in London. Moore wrote that the borough \"does not immediately show signs of hosting a German community\" due to a lack of obvious German businesses and storefronts,[24] but that most residents know of the location of the DSL and that there are \"more subtle signs of German presence.\"[25]\n\nGerman expatriates are located throughout London. Some of them do not go to the Borough of Richmond upon Thames even though the centre of the German community is located there.[24]\n\nGhanaians\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ghanaian British\n\nBesides Nigerians, Ghanaians are one of the largest Black African groups in London, with the majority living in the boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, Newham, Hackney, Haringey, Lewisham, Merton, Waltham Forest, Croydon, Enfield and Brent.[26]\n\nGreeks\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Greek British\n\nAccording to the \"History of London's Greek community\" by Jonathan Harris,[27] the Greek population of London numbered several thousand by 1870 AD whereas in 1850 AD it was just a few hundred. The 2001 Census recorded 12,360 Greek-born people living in London, with particular concentrations in the Hyde Park, Regent's Park, Chelsea and Kensington Census tracts.[28]\n\nThe Census tracts with the highest number of Cypriot-born people in 2001 were Palmers Green, Upper Edmonton, Cockfosters, Lower Edmonton, Tottenham North and Tottenham South.[29] Many Greek-Cypriots reside in Wood Green, Harringay and Palmers Green, the latter harbouring the largest community of Greek-Cypriots outside Cyprus, resulting in these areas bearing local nicknames whereby the Green is replaced by Greek – as in Greek Lanes and Palmers Greek.[30][31][32]\n\nAccording to a City of London Corporation sponsored report,[33] there are between 280,600 and 310,000 Greek speakers in Greater London.\n\nThe Greek Primary School of London and the Greek Secondary School of London both serve the community.\n\nIndians\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: British Indian and Indian community of London\n\nBritish Indians have long been one of London's largest ethnic minority groups and in 2007 over 500,000 Indians were residing in London (this excludes people of half or less Indian origin). Around 7% of London's population is of Indian origin. Indians have been in the British capital for generations and come from all walks of life. They are influential in the city's culture and are major contributors to London's workforce and economy.\n\nSouthall, Hounslow and Wembley have significant Indian populations.\n\nIrish\n\n[edit]\n\nIrish migration to Great Britain has a lengthy history due to the close proximity of, and complex relationship between, the islands of Ireland and Great Britain and the various political entities that have ruled them. Today, millions of residents of Great Britain are either from the island of Ireland or have Irish ancestry. Around six million Britons have an Irish grandfather or grandmother (approximately 10% of the UK population).[34] 900,000 ethnic Irish people live in the capital (12% of the city's population); despite this, some sources put the population of people of Irish descent in London at 77% (some five and a half million people), although the White British and White Irish populations combined are less than this.[35][36] The highest numbers of the Irish population is in the North and West London boroughs of Brent and Ealing.[16]\n\nJamaicans\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Jamaican British\n\nThere are records that show black people, predominantly from Jamaica, living in London during the 17th and 18th centuries; but it was not until the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush, on 22 June 1948, that significant numbers of Caribbeans, in particular Jamaicans, arrived in the capital. This has since become an important landmark in the history of modern multicultural Britain. During the post World War II era, the presence of the Caribbean Community was requested to help reconstruct the British economy. Employers such as British Rail, the NHS and London transport recruited almost exclusively from Jamaica. Some 250,000 Londoners are of Jamaican origin.[37] Brixton and Harlesden are considered the community's cultural capitals.[38][39]\n\nJapanese\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Japanese community of London\n\nJunko Sakai, author of Japanese Bankers in the City of London: Language, Culture and Identity in the Japanese Diaspora, stated that there is no particular location for the Japanese community in London, but that the families of Japanese \"company men\" have a tendency of living in North London and West London. Japanese restaurants and shops are located around these groups of Japanese people.[40]\n\nJews\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: British Jews\n\nJews are an ethnic and religious minority, and are protected under the Race Relations Act.[41][42] London has the second largest Jewish community in Europe after Paris, numbering some 160,000, particularly in North London. Districts with a high concentration include Finchley, Mill Hill, Edgware, Stanmore, Golders Green, Hendon, Hampstead Garden Suburb, Highgate, and further east the Hasidic-strong exclave in Stamford Hill & South Tottenham.\n\nKoreans\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2014 there were about 10,000 ethnic Koreans in New Malden proper,[43] and as of the same year the Korean population in the area around New Malden is around 20,000, including about 600 originating from North Korea, giving it the largest group of North Koreans in Europe.[44] Many of the Koreans living in New Malden work for Korean companies, and they are either permanently settled and formerly expatriate, or they are still expatriates.[45] In 2015 Paul Fischer of The Independent wrote that the North Koreans were insular, and that there were tensions between the South Korean majority and the North Koreans in New Malden.[43]\n\nThe New Malden area has Korean-language churches and nursery schools as well as restaurants and shops with Korean clientele.[46] The area has Korean supermarkets, about 20 Korean restaurants and cafes,[43] including those serving bulgogi.[43] It also has a noraebang (Karaoke bar).[44] The Korean language is visible on several shop signs. The original Embassy of South Korea to the United Kingdom is in Malden.[43]\n\nSome factors cited in The Telegraph as reasons why the Korean community formed in New Malden included a 1950s joint venture partnership between a chaebol and Racal Avionics (formerly Dacca), Lord Chancellor's Walk in Coombe Lane West previously serving as the residence of the Ambassador of South Korea to the United Kingdom, and Samsung Electronics having its UK offices in New Malden until they moved to their current location in Chertsey, Surrey in 2005. Many Koreans settled in New Malden in the 1970s due to the ambassador's location.[44]\n\nThere is a newspaper published in New Malden, Free NK, which is opposed to the government of North Korea.[44]\n\nLithuanians\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Lithuanian community in London goes back to at least the early 20th century. Most of the community came in a wave of Eastern European immigration in the 2000s, after Lithuania joined the European Union.[47]\n\nMost of London's Lithuanians live in the boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Newham, Redbridge and Waltham Forest, with smaller numbers elsewhere. The main Lithuanian-speaking Roman Catholic church, St Casimir's, however, lies in Cambridge Heath.[47]\n\nNigerians\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Nigerian British\n\nLondon (in particular the southern boroughs) is home to the largest Nigerian community in the UK, and possibly the largest overseas Nigerian community in the world. The first recorded Nigerian in London was Olaudah Equiano who came to Britain after escaping from slavery over 200 years ago, becoming a member of the abolitionist Sons of Africa group.\n\nIn the mid-20th century a wave of Nigerian immigrants came to London. Civil and political unrest in the country contributed to numerous refugees arriving in England.[48] The vast majority of famous and notable British people of Nigerian origin were either born in or now live in London.\n\nPeckham (also known as Little Lagos and Yorubatown) is home to one of the largest overseas Nigerian communities in the world; many of the local establishments are Yoruba-owned. Nigerian churches and mosques can be found in the area. As immigrants become assimilated, English is becoming the predominant language of the local Nigerian British population. The Yoruba language is declining in use in the Peckham area despite the increasing Nigerian population.[49] In 2001, about 7% of Peckham's population was born in Nigeria.[50] A much larger proportion of the ward's 60% Black population is of Nigerian descent, as 40% are of other African descent.[51]\n\nPakistanis\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Pakistani community of London\n\nPakistanis in London form the largest concentrated community of British Pakistanis; immigration from regions which now form Pakistan predate Pakistan's independence.[52] The main concentrations of Pakistani settlement in London are found in Outer London with the boroughs of Redbridge, Newham and Waltham Forest accounting for nearly a third of Londoners of Pakistani descent.\n\nPolish\n\n[edit]\n\nLondon has had a notable Polish community since the Second World War. Many of the migrants from Poland in the 1940s were soldiers and their families. The Polish Government in Exile was based in London until it was dissolved in 1991 following the restoration of democracy in Poland. In the 2000s a wave of Polish immigrants came to Britain, including London, after Poland joined the European Union. As of 2016, Poles now account for about 4.5 per cent of London's foreign-born population.[53]\n\nThe boroughs of Ealing, Enfield, Kensington and Chelsea, Haringey, Lambeth, Lewisham and Wandsworth have significant numbers of Poles living there. The Church of the Evangelist in Putney is one of several Polish-speaking Roman Catholic churches in London, and the Polish Social and Cultural Association in Hammersmith is the community's main centre. Polish-style shops, with their distinctive red and white signs accompanied by words in the Polish language, can be found in many parts of London.[54]\n\nRomanian\n\n[edit]\n\nThere has been a growing Romanian community in London since World War II. In the 2000s a wave of Romanian immigrants came to the UK, including London, after Romania joined the European Union.\n\nA particularly concentrated community exists in the Edgware-London suburb of Burnt Oak which has gained the nickname \"Little Romania\" or \"Little Bucharest\".[55] Most Romanians belong to the Romanian Orthodox religion.[56]\n\nRomanis\n\n[edit]\n\nRomani people are concentrated in north and east London. Approximately 30,000 Roma and Travellers live in London.[57]\n\nSri Lankans\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: British Sri Lankans\n\nThere is a large Sri Lankan community in London. The population of Sri Lankans in London was 50,000 in 2001 and 84,000 in 2011.[58][59] British Sri Lankans in London (mainly Tamils) can be found in Harrow (West London) and Tooting (South London).[60] They have a long presence in the UK dating back to the colonial times in the 19th century.[61] However, the majority came as refugees during the Sri Lankan Civil War.[62]\n\nSouth Africans\n\n[edit]\n\nMore than 53,000 South Africans live in London.[63]\n\nThai\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkish\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Turkish community of London and British Turks\n\nLondon is home to the largest Turkish community in the UK. The boroughs of Enfield, Haringey and Hackney have a significant number of Turkish inhabitants. A large Turkish-cypriot community is also present in boroughs of South London such as Lambeth and Croydon.\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nChinatown, London during Chinese new year.\n\nLondon Turks protesting.\n\nKittitian and Nevisian street dancers at the Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nLarge numbers of Colombians live in London.\n\nA Polish shop in Ealing.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nLondon portal\n\nDemographics of London\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nMoore, Fiona. \"The German School in London, UK: Fostering the Next Generation of National Cosmopolitans?\" (Chapter 4).
