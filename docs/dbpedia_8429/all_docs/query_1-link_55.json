        "text": "Windrush Day has been held on 22 June since 2018, to celebrate the contribution Caribbean migrants and their families have made to the UK.\n\nHMT Empire Windrush docked in Tilbury, Essex, in 1948, bringing hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean to the UK.\n\nIn 2018, it emerged that the government had not properly recorded the details of people granted permission to stay in the UK, and many were wrongly mistreated.\n\nWhat is the Windrush generation?\n\nHMT Empire Windrush became a symbol of a wider mass-migration movement.\n\nPeople in the Caribbean were invited to the UK to help rebuild post-war Britain.\n\nAccording to the National Archives, which holds the ship's passenger list, there were 1,027 people on board. More than 800 gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean.\n\nSeveral hundred passengers were Jamaican, but others arrived from islands including Trinidad, St Lucia, Grenada and Barbados.\n\nThese travellers - and those on other ships which came to the UK until 1971 - became known as the Windrush generation.\n\nMany had served in the British armed forces in World War Two.\n\nWhy did the Windrush generation come to Britain?\n\nIn 1948, the British Nationality Act gave people from colonies the right to live and work in Britain.\n\nThe government needed workers to help fill post-war labour shortages and rebuild the economy.\n\nCaribbean countries were also struggling economically, and job vacancies in the UK offered an opportunity.\n\nMany of those who came became manual workers, drivers, cleaners, and nurses in the newly established NHS.\n\nWhat is Windrush Day?\n\nCommemoration events have been held on 22 June every year since 2018.\n\nIn 2023, the 75th anniversary of the arrival of HMT Windrush was marked with a series of concerts, exhibitions and seminars across the country.\n\nKing Charles, who held a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the anniversary, hailed the Windrush generation's \"profound and permanent contribution to British life\".\n\nWhere are the Windrush generation now?\n\nIt is unclear how many people from the Windrush generation are still in the UK, but the number is thought to be in the thousands.\n\nThey are among more than 500,000 UK residents who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971, according to University of Oxford estimates.\n\nWhat was the Windrush scandal?\n\nThe 1971 Immigration Act gave Commonwealth citizens living in the UK indefinite leave to remain - the permanent right to live and work in the UK.\n\nThis included the Windrush generation, but also people from other former British colonies in South Asia and Africa.\n\nHowever, in April 2018, it emerged that the UK Home Office had kept no records of those granted permission to stay, and had not issued the paperwork they needed to confirm their status.\n\nIt had also destroyed landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants, in 2010.\n\nThose affected were unable to prove they were in the country legally and were prevented from accessing healthcare, work and housing.\n\nMany were also threatened with deportation.\n\nA review of historical cases also found that at least 83 people who had arrived before 1973 had been wrongly deported.\n\nWhat did the government do about the Windrush scandal?\n\nIn April 2018, then-Prime Minister Theresa May apologised for their treatment. An inquiry was announced and a compensation scheme established.\n\nThe inquiry, which reported in March 2020, said that the scandal was both \"foreseeable and avoidable\", and criticised \"a culture of disbelief and carelessness\" in the Home Office.\n\nThe inquiry made 30 recommendations, including:\n\na full Home Office review of the UK's \"hostile environment\" immigration policy\n\nappointing a migrants' commissioner\n\nestablishing a race advisory board\n\nInquiry author Wendy Williams warned there was a \"grave risk\" of similar problems happening again without government action.\n\nThen-Home Secretary Priti Patel accepted the recommendations in full.\n\nBut in January 2023, then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced the Home office was dropping three of the commitments:\n\nto appoint a migrants' commissioner responsible for \"speaking up for migrants and those affected by the system directly or indirectly\"\n\nto give the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration new powers\n\nto hold events with people affected to \"listen and reflect on their stories\"\n\nMs Williams criticised the decision, saying the proposals would have raised the \"confidence of the Windrush community\".\n\nHow does the Windrush Compensation Scheme work?\n\nThe Windrush Compensation Scheme was established in April 2019, and about 15,000 people were thought to be eligible.\n\nIn 2021, the Home Affairs Committee of MPs found the scheme had itself become a further trauma for those eligible. It said many of those affected were \"still too fearful of the Home Office to apply\".\n\nThe government insisted it would ensure \"similar injustices can never be repeated and [was] creating a Home Office worthy of every community it serves\".\n\nAccording to the latest Home Office update, as at February 2024, the scheme had paid more than £83.8m across 2,307 claims."
