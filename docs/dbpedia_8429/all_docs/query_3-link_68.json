        "text": "In order to make manuscript submission as easy as possible for authors, we have introduced format-free initial submission for the majority of our journals, apart from Proceedings B and Biology Letters which requires a Word version upon initial submission to enable accurate length estimation.\n\nAt first submission, authors can submit their manuscript in any format; however, we do still encourage authors to read the manuscript preparation guidelines below and to consider how easy a manuscript is to read by reviewers and editors.\n\nWhere applicable, manuscripts must adhere to our guidelines regarding length (see each journal website).\n\nOnce an article has been accepted for publication the main manuscript must be submitted as an editable file, not a PDF, and the source files of any figures and tables must be provided. If you are submitting a LaTeX file please see our LaTeX guidelines below.\n\nSubmissions should include the following sections.\n\nTitle page\n\nYour article title should be a short description of the research you are reporting. The best titles are written with both human readers and search engines in mind; including keywords in your title will help readers discover your article online. The title page should also contain full names and affiliations for each author.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe abstract should be no more than 200 words and should not contain references or unexplained abbreviations or acronyms. Your abstract should be concise and informative and should read well as a standalone piece. The general scope of the article as well as the main results and conclusions should be summarised. Please also ensure that your abstract contains all likely search terms, to assist indexers (e.g. PubMed) that scan only the title and abstract of articles. If possible, it is beneficial to have all your keywords written into the abstract. Your abstract provided at initial submission is included in reviewer invitation emails - please think about how to describe your work to make it easy for a potential reviewer to determine whether they would be suitable to review it.\n\nKeywords\n\nPlease include at least 3 and up to 6 keywords. Try to avoid overly broad or specialised terms that might be meaningless to a reader.\n\nThink about the words you would use to search online for articles on the same topic; these often make the best keywords. They do not necessarily need to be single words; keywords can include short phrases or terms that are easily recognised by researchers in your field.\n\nMain text\n\nThe main text of your article should be split into clearly-labelled sections. Usually these will be background, methods, results, discussion and conclusions, however please feel free to use whatever headings and subheadings best suit your article. Abbreviations should be written out in full on first use.\n\nMethods section (if applicable)\n\nThe Methods section should contain all elements necessary to allow interpretation and replication of the results. Please include full specific details of materials used, such as reagents, animal models or software. References to published methods or protocols (e.g. protocols.io) can also be provided. You are also encouraged to preregister your methods at a suitable repository (e.g. https://osf.io/prereg). You will also be required to provide a Data Availability statement; detailed guidance can be found below. Please additionally include the accession details in your methods sections where appropriate.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nPlease acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship criteria.\n\nFunding\n\nPlease state the sources of funding including grant number for each author. Including this information is a requirement of many funders. You will also be asked to enter this information during the submission process, but please ensure that you also include it in the manuscript.\n\nWe suggest the following format:\n\nThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Natural Environment Research Council [grant number zzzz]; and the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number aaaa].\n\nReferences\n\nAll our journals use a system based on Vancouver style referencing. All references to the literature cited will be given in the order of their appearance in the text in a consecutively numbered list at the end of the article.\n\nWhilst it will aid our production team if your final manuscript uses this format, it is not a requirement for submission. However please note that numbered references reduces your word count significantly and may be helpful for meeting page limits.\n\nPlease note that references to datasets must also be included in the reference list with DOIs where available. For example:\n\n1. Torres-Campos I, Abram PK, Guerra-Grenier E, Boivin G, Brodeur J. 2016 Data from: A scenario for the evolution of selective egg colouration: the roles of enemy-free space, camouflage, thermoregulation, and pigment limitation. Dryad Digital Repository. (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5qt2k)\n\nEach reference should contain as many of the following elements as possible:\n\nAuthor surnames with initials (up to 10 before et al. is used)\n\nYear of publication\n\nTitle of paper or book\n\nJournal name using standard abbreviation\n\nVolume number\n\nBook publisher and location\n\nFirst and last page numbers, or article number\n\nDigital Object Identifier (DOI)\n\nEndNote style files are available for most of our journals. For Royal Society Open Science please use the Open Biology style file.\n\nSupplementary material can be used for supporting data sets, supporting movies, figures and tables, and any other supporting material. Larger datasets should be uploaded to an appropriate repository rather than provided as supplementary material (see section below). The main article should stand on its own merit. The number of references included in the supplementary material should be kept to an absolute minimum as these are not recognised by many indexing services. You will be asked during the submission process if supplementary material contains data sets, code or materials.\n\nNote that supplementary materials are created by the authors themselves and are not edited by the Royal Society so please proof-read these thoroughly before submitting. If your supplementary file contains complex formatting or equations we would recommend that you submit it as a PDF file with fonts embedded to avoid compatibility problems for readers.\n\nAll supplementary material will be published under a CC-BY licence. For more information see our data sharing policies and our licence to publish.\n\nAuthors should submit supplementary materials as supporting files with their submission via ScholarOne Manuscripts, including titles and descriptions in the submission form. Each file can be up to 350MB, but should ideally be much less. Authors with supplementary material files of a larger size (in particular, movies) should contact the relevant journal editorial office for further assistance.\n\nAll supplementary material accompanying an accepted article will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on figshare, an online repository for research data. Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI. Online supplementary material will carry the title and description provided during the submission process, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. An example, showing the title and description as provided during the submission process, is available here.\n\nAs part of the submission process in ScholarOne, you will be required to provide statements on the following, which are essential for rapid assessment. You are no longer required to add these statements in the manuscript itself - these statements will be automatically added to the paper if accepted for publication. Please have these statements ready when you submit your manuscript.\n\nEthics\n\nResearch on humans or human tissues will require a statement detailing ethical approval (including the name of the research body that granted approval and the project/licence number). Please also detail whether informed consent was obtained and by whom. If your study uses animals please include details of the ethical approval received, including the name of the committee that granted approval and number of the licence/approval received. Relevant fieldwork details (approvals, licences, permissions) should also be listed here. For studies requiring the removal of, for instance, fossil specimens, please also include details of the approvals sought to carry out extraction. The details of any museum and/or fossil specimens used (e.g. the specimen numbers and the institutions holding these) must be provided either in the manuscript or the supplementary files. For more information about preparing this section please visit our ethics and policies page.\n\nUse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-assisted technologies\n\nYou will be asked to declare whether you have used AI technologies in the preparation of your paper. If you have, please provide a statement about how you have used this – the statement will be published in the final article. Please read our policy for full details of allowed use.\n\nData, code and materials\n\nAll papers that report primary data will require a section that states where the article's supporting data, materials and code can be accessed. Please see the above section for more information on our policies.\n\nIf these have been deposited in an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and any other relevant details. Datasets included here must also be listed in the reference section. Citing datasets and code ensure effective and robust dissemination and appropriate credit to authors.\n\nFor example:\n\nDNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402 [REF#]\n\nPhylogenetic data, including alignments: TreeBASE accession number S9123 [REF#]\n\nClimate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311 [REF#]\n\nIf supporting data, materials or code have been included in the article’s supplementary material, this should be stated here, for example:\n\nThe datasets supporting this article have been uploaded as part of the supplementary material.\n\nCompeting interests\n\nPlease provide a statement if you have any competing interests to declare. Competing interests are defined as those that, through their potential influence on behaviour or content or from perception of such potential influences, could undermine the objectivity, integrity or perceived value of publication. Please see the Competing Interests section of our authorship policy for more information.\n\nIf you are unsure whether you have a competing interest please contact the relevant journal editorial office for advice.\n\nCRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)\n\nThe submitting author will be required to allocate roles to authors from a taxonomy. This taxonomy will be used to create an Authors’ Contributions section which lists the specific contribution of each author in the published article. The taxonomy consists of 14 roles that represent the different contributions authors make to journal articles. The roles are as follows: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Funding acquisition; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Resources; Software; Supervision; Validation; Visualization; Writing – original draft; Writing – review & editing. More information can be found at https://credit.niso.org/.\n\nThe list of authors should meet the criteria provided on our authorship policy page. All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the acknowledgements section.\n\nAfter publication, we encourage you to share your work on social media and across your professional networks. Sharing and promoting your article to ensure that your publication is seen by a wide and relevant audience is key to maximising the impact of your research. We want to provide you with the right tools to disseminate your published article. Take a look at our top tips for promoting papers published in our journals.\n\nMedia promotion\n\nThe Society's press office promotes articles that appear in our scientific journals through weekly lists of media summaries to journalists. Please note that, like many publishers, the Royal Society employs a strict embargo policy whereby the reporting of a scientific article by the media is embargoed until a specific time. If you are approached by a journalist prior to publication, please contact the Society's press office.\n\nIt is a good idea to alert your institution's press office to the fact you are having an article published. Given enough advance warning, they may want to produce a press release to coincide with the weekly list from the Society's press office.\n\nCloser to the time of publication, the Society's press office will contact you to confirm the online publication date for your paper, to provide additional information on the Society's embargo policy and to give you advance warning of when you may expect to be contacted by journalists.\n\nOnline article seminars\n\nWe encourage you to give an online seminar about your accepted article. Author seminars are given a DOI and are listed on our Cassyni seminar collection page and alongside published articles. For more information contact us."
