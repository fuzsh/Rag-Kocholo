Fallow deer were almost certainly introduced by the Normans while three Asiatic species, Reeves’ muntjac, Chinese water deer and sika arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBRITISH DEER NAMES\n\nThe characteristics of each deer species make them well-suited to the habitats found across Britain and highly adaptable to environmental changes. Together they make a valuable contribution to biodiversity and are some of our most engaging British mammals.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, the genders and offspring of deer in the UK can have different names depending on the species – not all young deer are called fawns and not all male deer are called stags!\n\nSpecies\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\nYoung\n\nStag\n\nHind\n\nCalf\n\nStag\n\nHind\n\nCalf\n\nBuck\n\nDoe\n\nKid\n\nBuck\n\nDoe\n\nFawn\n\nBuck\n\nDoe\n\nFawn\n\nBuck\n\nDoe\n\nFawn\n\nMEDIUM TO LARGE DEER SPECIES\n\nMEDIUM to SMALL DEER SPECIES\n\nWatch Deer in Action\n\nPLEASE HELP US TO KEEP EDUCATING & INSPIRING EVERYONE ABOUT DEER FOR FREE\n\nIf you have found our free resources about deer in the UK useful then we’d really appreciate your support in helping us keep them free for all!
