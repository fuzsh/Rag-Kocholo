        "text": "UCL logo (standalone)\n\nThe standalone logo is used primarily when UCL is working with partners. It is available in black (with white portico) or in white (with black portico) as shown.\n\nJust like with the UCL banner, the UCL letters in the logo are cut out, revealing the background colour or image beneath. The Portico remains in white or black and does not take the colour of the background.\n\nMake sure there is enough contrast between the background colour and the logo. If using a colour from the new colour palette for the background, refer to the colour pairing guidelines.\n\nUCL logo (department lockup)\n\nThe UCL logo can be personalised by adding your department. If you contact the brand team we will create this for you.\n\nThis is your department logo. Do not create any other logos.\n\nDepartment lockup logos can only be black or white. Make sure there is enough contrast between the background colour and the logo.\n\nRemember, the UCL logo (department lockup) should be used only when communicating with partners. For anything else, the banner should be used.\n\nFind out more about department logos on our Branding your department page (log in required).\n\nStaff / Students\n\nIf you need to use the brand for UCL-related communications, or for dissertations and other UCL-related projects, please use the available banners and templates.\n\nIf you are working on a partnership with a third party and you would like to use the UCL logo, or your departmental logo in conjunction with a third party, you must obtain permission via the logo request form.\n\nYou are not permitted to use or adapt the logo or banner for other items, such as business cards, student society logos, social media channels, websites, CVs or any other promotional materials."
