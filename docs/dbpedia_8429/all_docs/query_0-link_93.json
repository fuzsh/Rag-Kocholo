        "meta_description": "Welcome to Telford College! Each academic year, Telford College plans to engage with more than 2,000 young people in college-based programmes, plus more than 700 apprentices and over 3,000 adult learners. A particular priority is to help students living in deprived areas – more than 40% of the college’s young people and 45% of its adult learners live in areas which are officially classed as deprived. For every £1 of Government funding, Telford College’s A level, apprenticeship and higher education courses generate a return of more than £25 to the local economy – and collaboration with local employers is at the heart of everything we do. Our growing range of Employer Hubs are already strengthening these links, and opening up exciting new career opportunities for students. We are proud to be named among the top 25% of providers nationally, with 96% of our students receiving offers from their first-choice university.",
