        "text": "Britainâ€™s two largest cities are now minority white British, the census has revealed.\n\nLondon and Birmingham now both have minority populations who identify as white British, according to the results of the census, with statisticians saying the figures indicate the \"increasingly multicultural society we live in\".\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) data show that in 2011 the white British population of Birmingham accounted for 581,000, or 52 per cent of the city. By 2021, that fell to 43 per cent, or 491,000 people.\n\nMeanwhile in London, the figures fell from 45 per cent, or 4.9 million people in 2011, to 37 per cent, or 4.7 million people in 2021.\n\nAnalysis conducted by Migration Watch said: \"The Census figures reveal the extent of huge demographic changes wrought by mass immigration for the population of England and Wales.\"\n\nThe ONS found that the number of people in England and Wales identifying their ethnic group as white has fallen by around 500,000 over a decade.\n\nSome 81.7 per cent of residents described themselves as white on the day of the 2021 census, down from 86 per cent in 2011.\n\nThe second most common ethnic group was 'Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh' at 9.3 per cent, up from 7.5 per cent in 2011.\n\nPeople identifying as 'White: Other', stood at 3.7 million (6.2 per cent) in 2021, up from 2.5 million (4.4 per cent) in 2011.\n\nThe number of people identifying their ethnic group as 'Other' also rose to 924,000 (1.6 per cent), up from 333,000 (0.6 per cent) in 2011.\n\nFurthermore, those identifying as 'Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African' also increased (2.5 per cent, 1.5 million in 2021, up from 1.8 per cent, 990,000).\n\nAround one in 10 households (2.5 million) contained members from at least two different ethnic groups in 2021. This is an increase from 8.7 per cent in 2011.\n\nJon Wroth-Smith, census deputy director, said: \"Today's data highlights the increasingly multi-cultural society we live in. The percentage of people identifying their ethnic group as 'White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British', continues to decrease.\n\n\"Whilst this remains the most common response to the ethnic group question, the number of people identifying with another ethnic group continues to increase.\"\n\nHe added: \"However, the picture varies depending on where you live. London remains the most ethnically diverse region of England, where just under two-thirds identify with an ethnic minority group, whereas under one in 10 identify this way in the North East.\n\n\"But despite the ethnically diverse nature of society, nine in 10 people across England and Wales still identify with a UK national identity, with nearly eight in 10 doing so in London.\""
