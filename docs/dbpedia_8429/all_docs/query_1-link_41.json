Wearing a poppy is a show of support for the service and sacrifice of our Armed Forces, veterans and their families\n\nIt represents all those who lost their lives on active service, from the beginning of the First World War right up to present day.\n\nIt also honours the contribution of civilian services and the uniformed services which contribute to national peace and security and acknowledges innocent civilians who have lost their lives in conflict and acts of terrorism.\n\n6. Poppies are sold in every community across the UK\n\nEvery year the rumour that poppies been banned in some communities resurfaces. This is simply not true and each year thousands of volunteers from all walks of life take to the streets, train stations and supermarkets around the country to help us raise vital funds for the Armed Forces community.\n\nEveryone who wants to take part in remembrance can do so, either by making a donation for our traditional poppy, or by taking part in other activities."
