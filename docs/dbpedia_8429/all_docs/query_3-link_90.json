Write several drafts first\n\nMake at least three different Instagram caption drafts.\n\nThis will allow you to edit, proofread, and compare your captions side by side to see which one has the most effect.\n\nYour first draft will almost never be selected as the best option, which is why you should set aside enough time to write several.\n\n2. Front-load the most important information\n\nThe 2,200-characters limit for Instagram captions is mostly a formality. However, it's worth noting that ig captions are cut off in users’ feeds to around 140 characters.\n\nThis doesn't mean you must make your insta captions extremely short so people can see everything without clicking \"more.\"\n\nInstead, frontload your captions with the most important sentence or calls-to-action, and save any @mentions, hashtags, or other unimportant information for the end.\n\n3. Include a strong call to action\n\nThe most effective way to maximize the possibility for your Instagram post to get shared and improve engagement is to include a call to action in the captions.\n\nInstead of passively scrolling through, you should use action verbs to encourage people to take action.\n\nHere are some exåmples:\n\nVisit the link in bio to learn more\n\nShare your experience in the comments\n\nEnter by liking this photo and signing up for our monthly newsletter\n\nA hashtag on Instagram works the same way it does on Twitter and Facebook: it unites the conversations of many users into a single stream.\n\nAnyone who searches for that hashtag on Instagram may see your Insta post if your account is public.\n\nHowever, you should use hashtags sparingly. As a means to get more followers, some Instagram users add a string of searchable hashtags.\n\nToo many hashtags can come off spammy to your existing followers. Limit yourself to three or four hashtags at most.\n\n5. Use emojis and have fun with them.\n\nAdd some emojis to spice up your insta captions and make them more appealing.\n\nEmojis added at the end of sentences or paragraphs may act as \"bookends,\" visually breaking up long strings of text.\n\nYou can also use emojis to encourage readers to take action, such as clicking the link in the bio.\n\nIf you're going to use emojis, make sure they match your tone of voice and identity. You don't want to use too many emojis at once, particularly in the same caption.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nGood Instagram captions take your content to new heights.\n\nRemember not to rush your copywriting and to evaluate the success of your efforts so that you can use objective benchmarks to figure out what works.\n\nYour content will go far if you combine a beautiful photo with a great Instagram caption.\n\n-> Museum tours business Instagram name ideas\n\nmeet the author\n\nPat Walls\n\nI'm Pat Walls and I created Starter Story - a website dedicated to helping people start businesses.
