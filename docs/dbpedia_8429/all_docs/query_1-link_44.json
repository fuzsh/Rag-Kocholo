        "text": "There are around 56,800 new breast cancer cases in the UK every year, that's more than 150 every day (2017-2019).\n\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 15% of all new cancer cases (2017-2019).\n\nIn females in the UK, breast cancer is the most common cancer, with around 56,400 new cases every year (2017-2019).\n\nIn males in the UK, breast cancer is not among the 20 most common cancers, with around 390 new cases every year (2017-2019).\n\nIncidence rates for breast cancer in the UK are highest in people aged 90+ (2017-2019).\n\nEach year around a quarter (24%) of all new breast cancer cases in the UK are diagnosed in people aged 75 and over (2017-2019).\n\nSince the early 1990s, breast cancer incidence rates have increased by around a sixth (18%) in the UK. Rates in females have increased by around a quarter (24%), and rates in males have remained stable (2017-2019).\n\nOver the last decade, breast cancer incidence rates have increased by less than a twentieth (3%) in the UK. Rates in females have increased by around a twentieth (4%), and rates in males have remained stable (2017-2019).\n\nSee our new Early Diagnosis Data Hub for statistics on stage at diagnosis for breast cancer.\n\nThe most common specific location for invasive breast cancers in the UK is the upper-outer quadrant of the breast (2016-2018).\n\nBreast cancer incidence rates are projected to rise by less than 1% in the UK between 2023-2025 and 2038-2040.\n\nThere could be around 69,900 new cases of breast cancer every year in the UK by 2038-2040, projections suggest.\n\nBreast cancer incidence rates in England in females are 14% lower in the most deprived quintile compared with the least, and in males are similar in the most deprived quintile compared with the least (2013-2017).\n\nAround 3,000 cases of breast cancer each year in England in females are linked with lower deprivation.\n\nIncidence rates for breast cancer are lower in the Asian and Black ethnic groups, and in people of mixed or multiple ethnicity, compared with the White ethnic group, in females in England (2013-2017). See our publication Cancer Incidence by Broad Ethnic Group for more details.\n\nAn estimated 491,300 women who had previously been diagnosed with breast cancer were alive in the UK at the end of 2010.\n\nSee more in-depth breast cancer incidence (invasive) statistics\n\nThere are around 8,500 new breast carcinoma in situ cases in the UK every year, that's 23 every day (2017-2019).\n\nIn females in the UK, breast carcinoma in situ accounted for around 8,400 new cancer cases every year (2017-2019).\n\nIn males in the UK, breast carcinoma in situ accounted for around 40 new cancer cases every year (2017-2019).\n\nIncidence rates for breast carcinoma in situ in the UK are highest in people aged 65 to 69 (2017-2019).\n\nEach year a tenth (10%) of all new breast carcinoma in situ cases in the UK are diagnosed in people aged 75 and over (2017-2019).\n\nSince the early 1990s, breast carcinoma in situ incidence rates have around tripled (201%) in the UK. Rates in females have around tripled (202%), and rates in males have more than doubled (139%) (2017-2019).\n\nOver the last decade, breast carcinoma in situ incidence rates have increased by almost a third (31%) in the UK. Rates in females have increased by around a third (32%), and rates in males have remained stable (2017-2019).\n\nThe most common specific location for in situ breast carcinomas in the UK is in the cells lining the milk ducts (2016-2018).\n\nIncidence rates for breast carcinoma in situ are lower in the Asian ethnic group and in people of mixed or multiple ethnicity, but higher in the Black ethnic group, compared with the White ethnic group, in females in England (2013-2017). See our publication Cancer Incidence by Broad Ethnic Group for more details.\n\nBreast carcinoma in situ incidence rates in England in females are 28% lower in the most deprived quintile compared with the least, and in males are similar in the most deprived quintile compared with the least (2013-2017).\n\nAround 910 cases of breast carcinoma in situ each year in England in females are linked with lower deprivation.\n\nAn estimated 63,800 women who had previously been diagnosed with in situ breast carcinoma were alive in the UK at the end of 2010.\n\nSee more in-depth in situ breast carcinoma incidence statistics\n\nThere are around 11,500 breast cancer deaths in the UK every year, that's 32 every day (2017-2019).\n\nBreast cancer is the 4th most common cause of cancer death in the UK, accounting for 7% of all cancer deaths (2017-2019).\n\nIn females in the UK, breast cancer is the 2nd most common cause of cancer death, with around 11,400 deaths every year (2017-2019).\n\nIn males in the UK, breast cancer is not among the 20 most common causes of cancer death, with around 85 deaths every year (2017-2019).\n\nMortality rates for breast cancer in the UK are highest in people aged 90+ (2017-2019).\n\nEach year almost half of all breast cancer deaths (48%) in the UK are in people aged 75 and over (2017-2019).\n\nSince the early 1970s, breast cancer mortality rates have decreased by around two-fifths (41%) in the UK. Rates in females have decreased by almost two-fifths (37%), and rates in males have decreased by more than two-fifths (44%) (2017-2019).\n\nOver the last decade, breast cancer mortality rates have decreased by around a sixth (18%) in the UK. Rates in females have decreased by almost a sixth (16%), and rates in males have remained stable (2017-2019).\n\nMortality rates for breast cancer are generally lower in females of non-White minority ethnicity, compared with the White ethnic group, in England and Wales (2017-2019). See the publication Mortality from leading causes of death by ethnic group, England and Wales.\n\nBreast cancer mortality rates are projected to fall by 13% in the UK between 2023-2025 and 2038-2040.There could be around around 11,400 deaths of breast cancer every year in the UK by 2038-2040, projections suggest.\n\nBreast cancer deaths in England are more common in females living in the most deprived areas. There is no association for males.\n\nSee more in-depth breast cancer mortality statistics\n\nAround 3 in 4 (75.9%) women diagnosed with breast cancer in England survive their disease for ten years or more, it is predicted (2013-2017).\n\nAround 8 in 10 (80.6%) women in England diagnosed with breast cancer between ages 15-44 survive their disease for ten years or more, compared with almost 6 in 10 (57.1%) women diagnosed aged 75-99 (2013-2017); ten-year survival is highest in women aged 55-64 (87.2%) (2013-2017).\n\nBreast cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years in the UK.\n\nIn the 1970s, 4 in 10 (40.0%) women diagnosed with breast cancer survived their disease beyond ten years, by the 2010s it was almost 8 in 10 (78.4%).\n\nAlmost 9 in 10 (88.4%) women in England diagnosed with breast cancer in the least deprived group survive their disease for five years or more, compared with more than 8 in 10 (82.1%) women in the most deprived group (2016-2020).\n\nFive-year relative survival for breast cancer in women is below the European average in England, Wales and Scotland but similar to the European average in Northern Ireland. Further details on cancer survival in Europe can be found on the EUROCARE website.\n\nFor breast cancer, like other cancer sites, survival trends reflect a combination of changes in treatment and stage distribution. These factors themselves can vary by age, sex and deprivation.\n\nFurther survival statistics by stage can be found on the Early Diagnosis Data Hub and information on treatments for cancer can be found here.\n\nFurther one-, five- and ten-year survival statistics can be found on the Cancer Statistics Dashboard.\n\nA person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors (including some potentially avoidable lifestyle factors).\n\n1 in 7 UK females will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime (born in 1961).\n\n23% of breast cancer cases in the UK are preventable.\n\nLess than 1% of breast cancer cases in the UK are caused by oral contraceptives.\n\n2% of breast cancer cases in the UK are caused by post-menopausal hormones.\n\n8% of breast cancer cases in the UK are caused by overweight and obesity.\n\n8% of breast cancer cases in the UK are caused by alcohol drinking.\n\n5% of breast cancer cases in the UK are caused by not breastfeeding.\n\nSee more in-depth breast cancer risk statistics"
