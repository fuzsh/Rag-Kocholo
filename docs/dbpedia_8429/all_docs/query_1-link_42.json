More than 100 legal department leaders, law firm partners, and Diversity & Inclusion experts joined forces to pitch innovative D&I programs. The \"Shark Tank” inspired competition challenged participants to develop sustainable and scalable solutions to strengthen D&I across the legal profession, while also ensuring fair and equal access to high-quality work, sponsors and other opportunities for all talent. White & Case partner Caroline Miller Smith contributed as a key member of the “Career Catalyst” team, which designed a program bridging mentorship and sponsorship. The initiative pairs high-potential mid-level lawyers with experienced in-house counsel leaders, providing them with structured support, advocacy, and exposure to senior leaders. The “Career Catalyst” team received an honorable mention, and their program will be further developed and piloted alongside other winning solutions in participating organizations. Congratulations to all the winners and everyone who participated! #TogetherWeMakeAMark #DEI #Hackathon\n\n\"[AI] is not like the computer HAL in '2001: A Space Odyssey' that is literally doing everything.\" White & Case partner Joel Cohen discusses the US Department of Justice's enforcement efforts in the Artificial Intelligence sector with Law360, and how misunderstandings of the technology can lead to investigations.
