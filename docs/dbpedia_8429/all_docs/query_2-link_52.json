        "text": "Video and audio content counts as “time-based media” under the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (PSBAR). City has a legal requirement and responsibility to do what we can to provide corrected captions for all such media.\n\nBelow is our approach for our educational platforms for the academic year 2024 to 2025:\n\nProvide a caption correction service to address reasonable adjustment needs. We will work with the Disability and Neurodiversity Support team to provide an integrated service for students who may require captioning as part of a reasonable adjustment.\n\nWe will recommend correcting captions on pre-recorded media for learning e.g., screencast lectures. LEaD will provide a caption correction service which is accessed via the IT Self Service Portal.\n\nFor recordings of all live teaching on campus and online, we aim to provide automated speech recognition (ASR) captions and transcripts, which are not human corrected. These are in place for Teams, Zoom, and Echo360 Lecture Capture.\n\nIn August 2022, City completed a disproportionate burden assessment regarding correcting captions on all stored lecture recordings. Unique to the higher education context, there can be approximately 15,000 hours of recording per academic year.\n\nCaptions on live meetings can be accessed in Teams and Zoom and their use is recommended. Echo360 Lecture Capture currently does not have this feature and we have raised this with the supplier.\n\nYou can request caption correction for MediaSpace videos on the IT Self Service Portal.\n\nYou will need to provide the following information to help the team process your request.\n\nLinks to videos (must be hosted on MediaSpace)\n\nConfirm your videos are set as Unlisted\n\nNote any important deadlines (please note that we cannot guarantee any dates of delivery).\n\nAutomated speech recognition can be inaccurate. Captions or transcripts of your recordings may contain words incorrectly transcribed as profanities e.g. swear words or inappropriate words. Alternatively, you might find that the captions or transcripts on your recordings are censoring words with a row of asterisks which means that students relying on captions are missing key information.\n\nLEaD are gathering information on the impact of profanities and censorship in recordings. If you find any examples, please raise a ticket with us via the LEaD General Request Form on IT Self Service Portal.\n\nPlease include as much information as possible, including system used - Lecture Capture, Teams, Zoom, links to the recordings on Moodle and timecodes.\n\nRecorded multimedia generally falls into two categories:\n\npre-recorded media (eg: screencasts)\n\nrecordings of live media (eg: online lecture recordings on Lecture Capture)\n\nWe recommend uploading all video and audio content to Kaltura MediaSpace (or MyMedia within Moodle) and then linking your resources to your modules. If you need further information on this, here is our guide to adding multimedia to Moodle. This will allow students to stream your media resources whilst also being able to view captions.\n\nAll media uploaded unto Kaltura mediaspace will have auto generated captions. As these captions are autogenerated, they may contain mistakes and will need reviewing.\n\nIf live time-based media content is stored for more than 14 days it becomes pre-recorded time-based media. “Pre-recorded media published after 23rd September 2020 must be accessible so must have captions, audio-descriptions or transcripts (as applicable)” (Lexdis, n.d.)"
