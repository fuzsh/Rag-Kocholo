THE SIGNATURE GOLD COLOR OF CHANEL. In 2015, gold and beige were merged together to transform into a new material: 18-karat BEIGE GOLD. The metal is used in both watches and fine jewelry, bringing a unique luster to each piece. BEIGE GOLD is the expression of a creative gesture, distinguished by the subtle balance of its nuances. Hundreds of samples were developed to perfect its radiance. Composed of 750 thousandths of fine gold, this exclusive alloy stands apart for its sophistication and uncompromising quality. Choosing BEIGE GOLD means wearing more than just a precious metal. It means donning the color of a truly CHANEL creation.

Designed to enhance the freedom of the body and the elegance of movement, the Graphic Line necklace is adorned with a lacework of diamonds and a 10.15-carat cushion-cut sapphire, sourced from an exceptional set of five stones from Kashmir. The chevron motif and the gradation of 24.35 carats of baguette-cut rubies in pure, simple lines evoke rhythm and speed. Patrice Leguéreau, Director of the CHANEL Fine Jewelry Creation Studio, has taken on the challenge of making the reverse side of the necklace as beautiful as the front, displaying on the back the name of the House, a first in High Jewelry.

The volumes are diaphanous, the sleeves puffed, and the flounces pleated. Richly embroidered, the collection imbues the House codes with a romantic twist. A CHANEL suit revisited in burgundy tweed trimmed with white satin, a black corduroy tuxedo, a blouse with an embroidered plastron, and a fitted jacket embellished with black feathers, dance among long coats, voluminous capes and evening gowns. For the show, playwright, writer and director Christophe Honoré imagined a mise en scène in the corridors of the Palais Garnier, offering a renewed way to experience the opera.
