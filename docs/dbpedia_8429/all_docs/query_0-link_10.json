        "text": "Sadiq Khan has come under fire after his official website published a photo of a white family which said they do not \"represent real Londoners\".\n\nThe Labour politician faced calls to apologise after the message appeared in a branding guide on the Greater London Authority (GLA) website.\n\nA spokesperson for the London Mayor insisted the caption was added \"in error\" and \"doesn’t reflect\" his views.\n\nThe document, titled \"Look Book – Mayor of London Brand Guidelines\", has since been taken down.\n\nThe picture shows a white couple and their two children out and about in the capital with the London Eye and the Palace of Westminster in the background.\n\nThe caption read: \"Doesn't represent real Londoners.\"\n\nJoin our free WhatsApp group to get all the latest politics news\n\nREAD MORE: Sadiq Khan faces ULEZ revolt as hundreds of cameras stolen or vandalised\n\nTory London mayoral candidate Susan Hall called on Mr Khan to say sorry.\n\nShe told The Mail on Sunday: \"All Londoners are real Londoners, no matter their ethnicity, and Sadiq Khan needs to apologise and stop these desperate, politically-motivated attempts to divide people.\"\n\nOutspoken Tory deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded it \"dog whistle politics\" and urged Mr Khan to \"do your job\".\n\nPolitician turned broadcaster Nigel Farage said: “Sadiq Khan’s London is run by an anti-white prejudice, which could be called racism.”\n\nTory MP Steve Tuckwell, who represents Uxbridge and South Ruislip, said: \"Shocking evidence that Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan wants to divide people across London - Khan is out of touch and needs to go.\"\n\nConservative peer Shaun Bailey added: \"Enough of these poisonous identity politics. My wife is white; so she’s not a proper Londoner?! Are our kids half Londoner?! It’s absurd & wrong. Our Mayor is more intent on taking ‘on brand’ photos dividing our city than improving London for everyone.\"\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
