        "text": "This tileset reference document includes information to help you use the data in the Mapbox Streets v8 tileset.\n\nOverviewâ\n\nMapbox Streets v8 is a Mapbox-provided vector tileset that includes geometries and metadata for roadways, terrain, administrative boundaries, building footprints, land use classifications, rail stations, points of interest, and more.\n\nFor full examples of using Mapbox Streets vector tiles to create a map style, see the default styles in Mapbox Studio.\n\nMapbox Streets v8 vector tiles are based on a combination of proprietary Mapbox data, Open Data projects such as OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Open Maps and Wikidata, as well as data vendors such as Zenrin in Japan.\n\nThe current supported version of the Mapbox Streets vector tiles receives regular data updates as new information becomes available and existing information is improved.\n\nData qualityâ\n\nBesides the daily efforts of contributors all over the globe, the OpenStreetMap community uses several other methods for identifying errors in the data, including multiple quality-assurance feedback tools and a flagging system that allows users to identify possible mistakes or areas that may need attention from someone with local knowledge.\n\nMapbox also has a dedicated data team that is committed to ensuring the quality of Mapbox maps and to adding and improving features all over the world. We also use an automated quarantine system that detects changes to the map that look like accidental editing mistakes or vandalism and stages them for manual review by our data team.\n\nAttributionâ\n\nWhen you publicly use styles or software that use Mapbox Streets vector tiles, you must display proper attribution.\n\nA list of sources utilized in creating Mapbox Streets is available on the Mapbox website.\n\nMultiple geometry typesâ\n\nMapbox vector tiles support multiple geometry types in the same layer. Mapbox Streets v8 takes advantage of this in some layers.\n\nA geometry in the vector tile can be one of three types:\n\nIn Mapbox Studio, you can select one, two, or all the three types with the Geometry Type toggles in each layer's data selection tab.\n\nIDsâ\n\nEach feature in a vector tile contains an object ID. This ID is not available for styling via Mapbox Studio, but can be used to interact with features at runtime with Mapbox GL JS and other vector tile libraries.\n\nThe ID is derived from a unique ID assigned to each feature by the relevant data vendor or Open Data project.\n\nOften, multiple objects from the same or multiple proprietary sources are combined into a single object in our vector tiles. For example, water polygons are unioned to avoid seams, and road lines are joined to save space. In these cases the ID is either 0 or one of the input IDs chosen at random.\n\nData stabilityâ\n\nAs we make ongoing data updates to reflect changes in the world or integrate new data vendors, we may also add new layers, fields, and values to Mapbox Streets v8 tiles. Our goal is to do this in a way that preserves compatibility with existing v8 styles. Here's what you need to know about how Mapbox Streets v8 may change in the future:\n\nLayers\n\nExisting layers will not be renamed or removed.\n\nNew layers may be added.\n\nFields\n\nExisting fields will not be renamed or removed.\n\nNew fields may be added to any layer.\n\nField values\n\nThe meanings of existing values will not change.\n\nValues of specific features may change to correct errors or reflect real-world changes.\n\nNew values may be added to any field unless otherwise noted in this documentation.\n\nFields that may contain null values are noted in this documentation, and null values will not be introduced to existing layers that do not already have them.\n\nYou should design your styles to account for the possibility of new field values. Be explicit in your filters where possible, and make sure to include appropriate default styles when using expressions.\n\nCommon fieldsâ\n\nThere are several fields that are used across several layers. These fields are detailed below instead of being duplicated for each relevant layer in the Layer reference section.\n\nname text and name_<lang-code> textâ\n\nLabel names are available in many languages. The name_* value is null if no translation data is available for a given feature. When styling label layers, you are responsible for determining an appropriate fallback approach.\n\nIf the name field is null for a particular feature, then all the language-specific name_* fields is also null. This means that name should always be the final fallback value if you want to include it in your set of label languages.\n\nIf the name field contains text to be rendered on multiple lines (horizontally or vertically) the text is separated by zero-width space characters.\n\nFor languages that may have regional variations, the tileset gives no particular preference where place name spellings differ.\n\nname_script textâ\n\nWherever there is a name field, there is also a name_script field that describes the primary script used in that text. This can be helpful for customizing fonts or language fallback conditions. Values include:\n\nThe value is null if name is also null.\n\nsizerank numberâ\n\nThe sizerank field is a value from 0-16 included in label layers where points or lines have been derived from polygons, such as poi_label, natural_label, airport_label. It lets you style and filter based on the size of a feature relative to the current zoom level. The tileset assigns the largest objects sizerank=0 and assigns points sizerank=16.\n\nA single feature has a changing sizerank as you zoom in and the relative size of the feature increases. For example, a park might have a sizerank of 9 at z11, 6 at z12, and 2 at z13.\n\nThe value is never null and is always be within the range 0-16.\n\nfilterrank numberâ\n\nThe filterrank field is a value from 0-5 used to customize label density. It's intended to be used in style layer filters (in the 'Select data' tab in Mapbox Studio). The value is relative to the current zoom level. For example, the same POI might have filterrank=5 at z10 while having filterrank=1 at z14, since zooming in changed the relative importance of the POI.\n\nYou could set filterrank<=1 to only show the most prominent labels, filterrank<=3 to produce moderate density, and filterrank<=5 to see as many labels as possible.\n\nThe value is never null and is always in the range of 0-5.\n\nmaki textâ\n\nSome layers have a maki field designed to make it easier to assign icons using the Maki icon project or other icons that follow the same naming scheme. Each layer uses a different subset of the names, but the full list of values used in Mapbox Streets is compiled here so you can make sure your style has all the icons needed across different layers.\n\nNot all icons from the Maki project are used in Mapbox Streets, and different types of related features can sometimes have the same maki value (for example universities and colleges, or art supply shops and art galleries). Nameless POIs always have a Maki value of marker, the generic default.\n\nThe possible values for the maki field for all layers are listed below. Icon names that were not part of any layer in v7 are marked with ð. No further values will be added in Mapbox Streets v8.\n\nairport_label:\n\nnatural_label:\n\npoi_label:\n\ntransit_stop_label:\n\nmaki_beta textâ\n\nMaki icons that might be supported in future versions of Mapbox Streets are in maki_beta field. Possible values include, but not limited to:\n\npoi_label:\n\nnatural_label:\n\nmotorway_junction:\n\nworldview textâ\n\nMapbox Streets v8 introduces the notion of worldviews to the admin, airport_label, natural_label, and place_label data layers. The vector tiles contain multiple versions of some features, each with a worldview value indicating the intended audience. When the worldview filter is applied, it must include both all and one of the region-specific values. Additionally, for all worldviews except for US worldview, there are classes in respective layers, prefixed with disputed_ which user must select in conjunction with the worldview filter; classes in respective layers in US worldview do not have the disputed_ prefix.\n\nA worldview filter must be applied to style layers that use the admin data layer. It is highly recommended to also use a worldview filter with airport_label, natural_label, and place_label data layers to communicate intent, but if no worldview is applied to those layers, the labels displayed on the map will reflect the US worldview.\n\ndisputed_ class text {#disputed_-class-text}â\n\nMany layers have a class field. These classes are often used to filter out or style features based on their purpose or characteristics. The available values for the class field vary by layer and are detailed in the Layer Reference below.\n\nIn layers that have both a class field and a worldview field, the value for the class field can be any value listed in the Layer Reference for that layer or any of those values prefixed with disputed_. When a feature is marked as disputed, it falls under the disputed_{class} class. For example, a disputed bay feature belongs to disputed_bay class instead of bay class.\n\ndisputed text {#disputed-text}â\n\nWhile no single map will reflect all global perspectives, acknowledging disputes where they exist is an important aspect of cartography and can lead to more universally usable maps. The dispute value will always be either true or false (never null). Any feature with a disputed_{class} class will also have set disputed to true.\n\nLayer Referenceâ\n\nThe Mapbox Streets v8 tileset contains the following layers. For reference, the current minimum-available zoom level for each layer is mentioned, but note that this is subject to change as we roll out updates and improvements. It also does not apply to all features within a layer - only the most prominent features are available at lower-numbered zoom levels, and more features are available as you zoom in. Labels for physically-large features also have a maximum zoom level based on their size.\n\nadminâ\n\nThis layer contains boundary lines for national and subnational administrative units. The data source & shapes match polygons from the Mapbox Boundaries product."
