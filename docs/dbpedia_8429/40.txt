I am very concerned about the usage of "At"

People sometime use it like this.

At London, United Kingdom.

But as far as I know "London" is a place so they should be using " in" instead of.

At Delhi.

Now Delhi is metropolitan city of India. How could they use "At" like that.

Please help me to learn the proper usage of "At" in such cases.

I saw an IAS officer of India posting photo with her husband giving caption like this.

At London, United kingdom.

Also I saw some people posting photos abovementioned

At Delhi, India.

Yes. I have seen this wording in the captions to some older images, such as this: Stock Photo - THE EASTERN QUESTION: DANCING DERVISHES, AT CONSTANTINOPLE, ISTANBUL, TURKEY, 1876

These days, I don't think we would use a preposition in the caption: just "Delhi, India".

Yes, we don't generally use "at" with cities. On the other hand it's common enough to post photos of somebody with just the caption "At [name of place]" to denote where a photo was taken.

But in those examples I would say it's more usual to give the name of the specific place in the city, for example "At the Tower of London" or "At the Taj Mahal, Delhi". That's assuming, of course, that you know or can tell from the background in the photo whereabouts in the city it was.
