        "text": "Characteristics associated with purchasing antidepressant or antianxiety medications through primary care in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nAyalon, Liat; Gross, Revital; Yaari, Aviv; Feldhamer, Elan; Balicer, Ran; Goldfracht, Margalit\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThis study analyzed the role of patient and physician characteristics associated with the purchase of antidepressant or antianxiety medications in Israel, a country that has a universal health care system. A national sample of 30,000 primary care patients over the age of 22 was randomly drawn from the registry of the largest health care fund in Israel. Data concerning medication purchase between January and December 2006 were extracted. Physician and patient characteristics were merged with Israel's unique identification number. Multilevel analysis was conducted to identify patient- and physician-level predictors of medication purchase. Overall, 19% (N = 4,762) of the sample purchased antidepressant or antianxiety medications. Individuals with greater general medical and psychiatric comorbidity were more likely to purchase antidepressant or antianxiety medications. Older adults, women, those of higher socioeconomic status, and immigrants (with the exception of Jews born in Asia or Africa) were also more likely to purchase medications. Arabs and Jews born in Asia and Africa were less likely to purchase medications even after all other variables were accounted for. Physician characteristics were minimally associated with the purchase of medications. The findings demonstrate that despite universal health care access, there were variations by population groups. Educational efforts should target patients as well as physicians.\n\n[60 years of medical genetics in Israel].\n\nPubMed\n\nShalev, Stavit A; Borochowitz, Zvi U; Zlotogora, Joel\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe principle deeds of genetics in Israel consist of a wide array of disciplines including agriculture, nutrients, biotechnology, pharmacology and pharmacogenetics, pertaining to criminal as well as medical aspects. In the scope of this state of the art historical review, the authors emphasize the medical issues. The initial stimulus for genetic studies and medical awareness among the various ethnic populations in Israel was the immigration, in the early 1950s, of over a million Jewish immigrants from more than 100 countries from all continents. It was soon recognized that frequencies of genetic diseases differed markedly among the various communities, serving as a trigger for studying and managing these populations. In this state of the art historical review, particular emphasize was given to the historical events concerning genetics in the land of Israel, as well as in the state of Israel. Highlights of genetic diversity of the various ethnic and sub-populations are added, along with the advances and major achievements of the human genetics discipline in the state of Israel.\n\nMedical research in Israel and the Israel biomedical database.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerns, D S; Rager-Zisman, B\n\n2000-11-01\n\nThe data collected for the second edition of the Directory of Medical Research in Israel and the Israel Biomedical Database have yielded very relevant information concerning the distribution of investigators, publication activities and funding sources. The aggregate data confirm the findings of the first edition published in 1996 [2]. Those facts endorse the highly concentrated and extensive nature of medical research in the Jerusalem area, which is conducted at the Hebrew University and its affiliated hospitals. In contrast, Tel Aviv University, whose basic research staff is about two-thirds the size of the Hebrew University staff, has a more diffuse relationship with its clinical staff who are located at more than half a dozen hospitals. Ben-Gurion University in Beer Sheva and the Technion in Haifa are smaller in size, but have closer geographic contact between their clinical and basic research staff. Nonetheless, all the medical schools and affiliated hospitals have good publication and funding records. It is important to note that while some aspects of the performance at basic research institutions seem to be somewhat better than at hospitals, the records are actually quite similar despite the greater burden of clinical services at the hospitals as compared to teaching responsibilities in the basic sciences. The survey also indicates the substantial number of young investigators in the latest survey who did not appear in the first survey. While this is certainly encouraging, it is also disturbing that the funding sources are apparently decreasing at a time when young investigators are attempting to become established and the increasing burden of health care costs precludes financial assistance from hospital sources. The intensity and undoubtedly the quality of medical research in Israel remains at a level consistent with many of the more advanced western countries. This conclusion is somewhat mitigated by the fact that there is a decrease in available funding\n\nUndergraduate medical education in the U.S. and Israel: contrasts and common challenges.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeldman, Arthur M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn 2014, the Israeli Council for Higher Education (CHE) commissioned an international panel of outstanding educators to prepare an ad hoc report reviewing the four established medical schools in Israel. The report described the strengths, weaknesses and challenges facing medical education in Israel with a focus on three specific areas: workforce planning, the structure of the curriculum and the financing of medical education. There are interesting parallels between the challenges facing medical education in the U.S. and in Israel: a lack of clarity regarding the optimal size for the workforce and the optimal method for enhancing the number of primary care physicians; an absence of methodologies for evaluating innovations in medical education and a lack of transparency in funds flow. However, there are also important differences, one of the most important being an absence in Israel of students' hands-on responsibility for their patients until year six of their undergraduate medical education. The presence of a small number of medical schools with common funding and geographic proximity, in a relative sense, provides the Israeli medical schools with a unique opportunity to evaluate innovations in medical education and to set a high bar for inter-school collaboration and cooperation.\n\nHousehold medical waste disposal policy in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarnett-Itzhaki, Zohar; Berman, Tamar; Grotto, Itamar; Schwartzberg, Eyal\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLarge amounts of expired and unused medications accumulate in households. This potentially exposes the public to hazards due to uncontrolled use of medications. Most of the expired or unused medications that accumulate in households (household medical waste) is thrown to the garbage or flushed down to the sewage, potentially contaminating waste-water, water resources and even drinking water. There is evidence that pharmaceutical active ingredients reach the environment, including food, however the risk to public health from low level exposure to pharmaceuticals in the environment is currently unknown. In Israel, there is no legislation regarding household medical waste collection and disposal. Furthermore, only less than 14Â % of Israelis return unused medications to Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) pharmacies. In this study, we investigated world-wide approaches and programs for household medical waste collection and disposal. In many countries around the world there are programs for household medical waste collection. In many countries there is legislation to address the issue of household medical waste, and this waste is collected in hospitals, clinics, law enforcement agencies and pharmacies. Furthermore, in many countries, medication producers and pharmacies pay for the collection and destruction of household medical waste, following the \"polluter pays\" principle. Several approaches and methods should be considered in Israel: (a) legislation and regulation to enable a variety of institutes to collect household medical waste (b) implementing the \"polluter pays\" principle and enforcing medical products manufactures to pay for the collection and destruction of household medical waste. (c) Raising awareness of patients, pharmacists, and other medical health providers regarding the health and environmental risks in accumulation of drugs and throwing them to the garbage, sink or toilet. (d) Adding specific instructions regarding disposal of the drug, in the\n\n[Is the rate of medical publication from Israel similar to other countries? A comparative study of three medical specialties].\n\nPubMed\n\nZer, Matan; Lindner, Arie; Greenstein, Alexander; Leibovici, Dan\n\n2011-07-01\n\nAcademic careers of individual doctors are commonly evaluated by examining the number and quality of authored publications. Similarly, the extent and quality of medical research may be assessed nationwide by measuring the number of publications originating from the country of interest over time. This in turn, may indicate on the quality of medicine practiced. To evaluate the extent and quality of IsraeLi publications we measured the rate and quality of medical publications originating from Israel for two decades in the fields of urology, cardiology and orthopedics, and compared the data to those of other countries. Leading journals in urology, cardiology, and orthopedics were selected. A Medline search (http://www.ncbi.ntm.nih.gov/sites/entrez] was conducted for all the publications originating in Israel between the years 1990-2009 in the selected journals. Data from Israel was compared to those from Italy, France, Germany, Egypt and Turkey. The change in rate of publications was tested using Linear regression. The quality of publications was calculated by multiplying the number of publications by the relevant impact factor. While the urology publications rate in Israel increased by 32.7% in the second study decade as compared with the first, the urology publication rates during the same time period from Italy, France, Germany, Egypt and Turkey were 199%, 115%, 184%, 180% and 227% respectively. The regression coefficient for the urology publication rate was 0.51 for Israel, and 0.78, 0.95, 0.78, 0.87 and 0.97 for the other countries, respectively. The regression coefficient for the change in the quality of publications from Israel was 0.31 and 0.81, 0.75, 0.92, 0.73, and 0.92 for the other countries, respectively. In cardiology, the Israeli publication rate increased by 26% during the second study decade, whereas in the other countries the increments were 46%, 35%, 76%, 80% and 309% respectively. The regression coefficient for Israeli pubLication rate was 0.45, and\n\nImpact of new medical technologies on health expenditures in Israel 2000-07.\n\nPubMed\n\nRabinovich, Mordechai; Wood, Francis; Shemer, Joshua\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to estimate the impact of new medical technologies on public healthcare expenditures in Israel over the period 2000-07. For each year, government estimates for the costs of new technologies recommended as high-priority for public funding were summarized. The ratio of projected costs of these technologies to total public healthcare expenditures was calculated and compared with actual governmental budget allocations for new technologies. Funding all new high-priority medical technologies would have increased healthcare expenditures by 2.1 percent per year. Government allocations for new technologies raised expenditures by 1.0 percent per year. New medical technologies significantly increase healthcare expenditures in Israel. Budgetary constraints have reduced their actual impact by 52 percent. This study indicates the need for an annual addition of 2 percent to public healthcare budget for funding new high-priority technologies.\n\nAdolescent BMI at Northern Israel: From Trends, to Associated Variables and Comorbidities, and to Medical Signatures.\n\nPubMed\n\nMachluf, Yossy; Fink, Daniel; Farkash, Rivka; Rotkopf, Ron; Pirogovsky, Avinoam; Tal, Orna; Shohat, Tamar; Weisz, Giora; Ringler, Erez; Dagan, David; Chaiter, Yoram\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe increasing prevalence of abnormal body mass index (BMI), mainly obesity, is becoming a significant public health problem. This cross-sectional study aimed to provide a comprehensive view of secular trends of BMI, and the associated socio-demographic variables and comorbidities among adolescents with abnormal BMI. Individuals of the study population were born mainly between 1970 and 1993, and were examined at 16 to 19 years of age during the years 1987 to 2010, at 1 conscription center in the northern district of Israel.The study population included 113,694 adolescents. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between BMI categories, socio-demographic variables, and medical conditions.A downward trend in the prevalence of normal BMI among both male and female adolescents was obtained, while trends of overweight and obesity (in both genders) and underweight (only among females) rose. Socio-demographic variables such as religion, education, family-related parameters, residential environment, country of birth, and origin were all associated with different risks for abnormal BMI. Obesity was associated with higher risk for hyperlipidemia, endocrine disorders (only in males), knee disorders, and hypertension type I + II (in both genders). Overweight was associated with knee disorders (only in females). Underweight, exclusively in males, was associated with increased risk for endocrine disorders, proteinuria, and cardiac disorders. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the intricate relations between gender, BMI, and medical signatures. It brought to light novel clusters of diseases that were abundant among populations having above-normal BMI or underweight males. Furthermore, above-normal BMI was associated with a lower rate of cardiac anomalies and scoliosis/kyphosis, whereas being underweight was associated with a lower risk for hypertension and flat foot.This study provides a reliable and in-depth view\n\nHigh trait aggression in men is associated with low 5-HT levels, as indexed by 5-HT4 receptor binding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMc Mahon, Brenda; MacDonald Fisher, Patrick; Jensen, Peter Steen; Svarer, Claus; Moos Knudsen, Gitte\n\n2016-01-01\n\nImpulsive aggression has commonly been associated with a dysfunction of the serotonin (5-HT) system: many, but not all, studies point to an inverse relationship between 5-HT and aggression. As cerebral 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) binding has recently been recognized as a proxy for stable brain levels of 5-HT, we here test the hypothesis in healthy men and women that brain 5-HT levels, as indexed by cerebral 5-HT4R, are inversely correlated with trait aggression and impulsivity. Sixty-one individuals (47 men) underwent positron emission tomography scanning with the radioligand [11C]SB207145 for quantification of brain 5-HT4R binding. The BussâPerry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale were used for assessment of trait aggression and trait impulsivity. Among male subjects, there was a positive correlation between global 5-HT4R and BPAQ total score (Pâ=â0.037) as well as BPAQ physical aggression (Pâ=â0.025). No main effect of global 5-HT4R on trait aggression or impulsivity was found in the mixed gender sample, but there was evidence for sex interaction effects in the relationship between global 5-HT4R and BPAQ physical aggression. In conclusion we found that low cerebral 5-HT levels, as indexed by 5-HT4R binding were associated with high trait aggression in males, but not in females.

Incubation in rodents has been linked to time-dependent neuronal plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We tested the hypothesis that incubation of cue reactivity during abstinence from cocaine self-administration is accompanied by lower potency and/or efficacy of the selective serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2Câ receptor (5-HT2CR) agonist WAY163909 to suppress cue reactivity and a shift in the subcellular localization profile of the mPFC 5-HT2CR protein. We observed incubation of cue reactivity (measured as lever presses reinforced by the discrete cue complex) between Day 1 and Day 30 of forced abstinence from cocaine relative to sucrose self-administration. Pharmacological and biochemical analyses revealed that the potency of the selective 5-HT2CR agonist WAY163909 to suppress cue reactivity, the expression of synaptosomal 5-HT2CR protein in the mPFC, and the membrane to cytoplasmic expression of the 5-HT2CR in mPFC were lower on Day 30 vs. Day 1 of forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration. Incubation of cue reactivity assessed during forced abstinence from sucrose self-administration did not associate with 5-HT2CR protein expression in the mPFC. Collectively, these outcomes are the first indication that neuroadaptations in the 5-HT2CR system may contribute to incubation of cocaine cue reactivity. Copyright Â© 2016 IBRO.

This study explored the perceived stress and coping ability of students of the New York State/American Programme, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, who study medicine in Israel but are expected to return to America to practice. Students were surveyed using the Ways of Coping Checklist (WCCL), Appraisal Dimension Scale (ADS) and two instruments specifically designed for the study. The results supported the view that students having difficulty adapting to their new cultural environment also have difficulty at medical school. This pattern is a negative spiral in which anxiety and depression impair cognitive performance, which leads to academic difficulties and emotional distress. Improvements in student social support and primary prevention were implemented as a result of the study. Limitations of the study are discussed.\n\n\"It's Every Family's Dream\": Choice of a Medical Career Among the Arab Minority in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nPopper-Giveon, Ariela; Keshet, Yael\n\n2016-10-01\n\nApplication to medical studies and the choice of medicine as a career are influenced by many factors, some internal (academic ability, intellectual curiosity, interests) and some external (parental pressure, peer pressure, teacher and school expectations). Ethnicity plays a role in motivational orientation and belonging to an ethnic minority group may influence both internal and external motives and priorities in choosing medicine as a career. In this article, we present a qualitative study of the motives that impel Arab physicians in Israel to choose a medical career. As a theoretical framework, we apply self-determination theory (SDT) (Ryan and Deci in Am Psychol 55:68-78, 2000), consisting of three principal categories situated along a continuum: Amotivation, extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. We show that extrinsic motivation is dominant among Arab physicians in Israel, demonstrating specifically the unique political context and cultural characteristics of Arab society in Israel. These findings, and the attention to the unique motivations of people from different ethnic minority groups who choose medical career, may increase the number of physicians from minority groups, a step known to decrease health gaps in multi-cultural contexts.\n\nIncubation of cocaine cue reactivity associates with neuroadaptations in the cortical serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR) system\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSwinford-Jackson, Sarah E.; Anastasio, Noelle C.; Fox, Robert G.; Stutz, Sonja J.; Cunningham, Kathryn A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntensification of craving elicited by drug-associated cues during abstinence occurs over time in human cocaine users while elevation of cue reactivity (âincubationâ) is observed in rats exposed to extended forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration.

It is therefore essential that medical students possess the appropriate knowledge and attitudes regarding PLWHA. This study aims to evaluate knowledge and attitudes of pre-clinical Israeli medical students and to assess whether their knowledge and attitudes change throughout their pre-clinical studies. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among all pre-clinical medical students from the four medical schools in Israel during the academic year of 2010/2011 (a total of 1,470 students). A self-administered questionnaire was distributed. The questionnaire sought student responses pertaining to knowledge of HIV transmission and non-transmission routes, basic knowledge of HIV/AIDS treatment and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS. Results The studyâs response rate was 62.24 percent. Knowledge among pre-clinical medical students was generally high and showed a statistically significant improvement as students progressed through their pre-clinical studies. However, there were some misconceptions, mostly regarding HIV transmission via breastfeeding and knowledge of HIV prevention after exposure to the virus. Studentsâ attitudes were found to include stigmatizing notions. Furthermore, the majority of medical students correlated HIV with shame and fear. In addition, studentsâ attitudes toward HIV testing and providing confidential medical information were contradictory to health laws, protocols and guidelines. Overall, no positive changes in studentsâ attitudes were observed during the pre-clinical years of medical school. Conclusion The knowledge of pre-clinical medical students in Israel is generally high, although there are some knowledge inadequacies that require more emphasis in the curricula of the medical schools. Contrary to HIV-related knowledge, medical studentsâ attitudes are unaffected by their progression through medical school. Therefore, medical\n\nSerotonin (5-HT) augmentation reduces provoked aggression associated with primary psychopathy traits.\n\nPubMed\n\nFanning, Jennifer R; Berman, Mitchell E; Guillot, Casey R; Marsic, Angelika; McCloskey, Michael S\n\n2014-06-01\n\nPsychopathy has long been associated with aggressive behavior; however, the neurochemical underpinnings of this relationship are poorly understood. Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system abnormalities have been associated with provoked aggression in general. In addition, 5-HT dysregulation has been linked to empathy, a trait that is lacking in individuals who score high on primary psychopathy. The purpose of this study was to determine if 5-HT modulates the relationship between psychopathic traits and aggression. Participants (N = 47) completed a self-report measure of psychopathy and were then administered either 40 mg paroxetine (acutely augmenting 5-HT) or placebo. Aggression was assessed during a competitive reaction-time game in which electric shocks were exchanged with an increasingly provocative fictitious opponent. Results indicated that primary psychopathy (but not secondary psychopathy) was related to aggressive responding to provocation. Moreover, 5-HT augmentation attenuated this effect, supporting the notion that aggressive responding associated with primary psychopathic traits may be due in part to 5-HT dysregulation.\n\nThe relational underpinnings of quality internal auditing in medical clinics in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarmeli, Abraham; Zisu, Malka\n\n2009-03-01\n\nInternal auditing is a key mechanism in enhancing organizational reliability. However, research on the ways quality internal auditing is enabled through learning, deterrence, motivation and process improvement is scant. In particular, the relational underpinnings of internal auditing have been understudied. This study attempts to address this need by examining how organizational trust, perceived organizational support and psychological safety enable internal auditing. Data collected from employees in medical clinics of one of the largest healthcare organizations in Israel at two points in time six months apart. Our results show that organizational trust and perceived organizational support are positively related to psychological safety (measured at time 1), which, in turn, is associated with internal auditing (measured at time 2).\n\nHospital CIO Explains Blockchain Potential: An Interview with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's John Halamka.\n\nPubMed\n\nMertz, Leslie\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWork is already underway to bring blockchain technology to the healthcare industry, and hospital administrators are trying to figure out what it can do for them, their clinicians, and their patients.

It provides a rare opportunity for planning an educational agenda tailored to local needs. This article moves from a description of the context of Israeli health care and the medical education system to a short overview of two existing Israeli medical schools where reforms have recently taken place. This is followed by an assessment of Israeli BME and an effort to use the insights from this assessment to inform the fifth medical school blueprint. The fifth medical school presents an opportunity for further curricular reforms and educational innovations. Reforms and innovations include: fostering self-directed professional development methods; emphasis on teaching in the community; use of appropriate educational technology; an emphasis on patient safety and simulation training; promoting the humanities in medicine; and finally the accountability to the community that the graduates will serve.\n\n[Ethiopia in Israel--an ethnopharmacological study of Ethiopian immigrants in Israel].\n\nPubMed\n\nDanino, Dikla; Amar, Zohar\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThere is a large Ethiopian community in Israel which preserves its unique culture and customs. Many of the members of this community still use traditional methods of healing, such as blood-letting, burns, tattooing, amulets, healing water, incense and various medicinal herbs that are prescribed based on the diagnosis of the disease. This study deals with documenting the use of the medicinal drugs implemented by the Ethiopian community in Israel, which is a rapidly vanishing world. The study is based on interviews with hundreds of informants, among them traditional healers, and it surveyed some fifty shops which sell Ethiopian medicinal drugs and spices. The survey brought to light a list of medical materials which are found in the Ethiopian markets in Israel including 89 kinds of plants (some 85%); 6 different minerals (some 6%); 5 types of animals (some 4.5%); and 5 substances of various origins (some 4.5%). Most of the drugs are imported from Ethiopia to Israel, since they are endemic. There are also other medicinal drugs that are gathered in the field in Israel or brought through personal import; in total, our estimate is that there are approximately 150 different kinds of medicinal drugs in use in Israel. This is a relatively small number when compared to the inventory of drugs in the land of origin, Ethiopia. The decline in the use of traditional drugs, due to limited availability and processes of modernization in the Ethiopian community in Israel, heightens the importance of a study that documents this unique culture. The study is also of assistance to the modern medical authorities in order to better understand and become more familiar with the Ethiopian community and with its needs and special practices, in terms of both prevention and treatment.\n\nSpecial forces medicine in Israel: history and future direction.\n\nPubMed\n\nOstfeld, Ishay; Paran, Haim; Chen, Jacob; Barneis, Yotam; Dreyfuss, Uriel; Kedem, Hagai; Glassberg, Elon\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Special Forces (SF) of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) have a long and pioneering history in tactical and medical aspects. Moreover, the importance of medical assistance is highly regarded in the Israeli SF community. Consequently, as current military challenges of Israel increase, the need for SF activity and for its medical support increases as well. Therefore, the authors anticipate that further development of SF medicine (SFM), as a specific branch of military medicine in Israel, will continue. 2014.\n\nIsrael`s unauthorized arms transfers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nClarke, D.\n\n1995-10-01\n\nIsrael confronts a spectrum of security threats. Given that harsh reality and America`s firm commitment to the Jewish state as reiterated by successive presidents, Israel requires, and rightly receives, unique attention and support from the United States (U.S). Indeed, Israel`s welfare, even survival, is dependent on its `special` relationship with Washington. Thus far, U.S.-Israel ties have weathered America`s post-Cold War retrenchment in world affairs. Israel retains its customary level of foreign aid, for example, even as the overall foreign assistance budget shrinks. Yet below the surface, the relationship is threatened by Israel`s repeated contraventions of American law.

Despite a growing scientific interest in the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of MOH, few studies have focused on the role of genetics in the development of the disease, as well as on the genetic determinants of the inter-individual variability in the number of drug doses taken per month. Our study was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood of 227 MOH patients and 312 control subjects. Genotype-specific risks were estimated as odds ratios with associated 95% confidence intervals by unconditional logistic regression and adjusted for age and gender. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was employed to identify significant predictors of the number of drug doses taken per month. No significant association was found between 5HT2A A and 1438G and C516T gene polymorphisms and MOH risk. In contrast, a higher consumption of monthly drug doses was observed among 516T 5HT2A carriers (median 50, range 13-120) compared to 516CC patients (median 30, range 12-128) (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = .018). In the stepwise multiple regression analysis, C516T 5HT2A polymorphism (P = .018) and class of overused drug (P = .047) emerged as significant, independent predictors of the monthly drug consumption in MOH patients. Although our results do not support a major role of the A-1438G and C516T polymorphic variants of the 5HT2A gene in the susceptibility of MOH, our findings support an influence of the C516T polymorphism on the number of symptomatic drug doses taken and, possibly, on the drug-seeking behavior in these patients.

However, little is currently known about the mechanisms, loci, or time window of the actions of 5-HT. The aim of this review is to discuss some recent results on the effects of systemic administration of selective agonists and antagonists of 5-HT on associative learning in a Pavlovian/instrumental autoshaping (P/I-A) task in rats. The results indicate that pharmacological manipulation of 5-HT1-7 receptors or 5-HT reuptake sites might modulate memory consolidation, which is consistent with the emerging notion that 5-HT plays a key role in memory formation.

We studied 129 subjects who met the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia according to a structured clinicai interview (MINI-PLUS), Patients underwent a semistructured interview to assess suicide attempt history and its characteristics, in addition, at least one close relative of the patient was interviewed to assess prohand and family suicidal behavior. Healthy controls were students and hospital staff members free of psychiatric and medical illness. Genotypes were determined after polymerase chain reaction amplification of the region of 5-HT2A/T102C containing the polymorphic site and digestion with the restriction enzyme Hpall, We found no association between suicidal attempt history and suicide attempt characteristics and genotypic or aileie frequencies. Suicidal behavior was also not associated with demographic or psychopathological characteristics. These results suggest that the S-HT2A gene polymorphism (102T/C) is not involved in genetic susceptibility to suicidal behavior, but further studies in a larger sample are needed.

The transition has been informed, in part, by evaluation in 2014 by an International Review Committee (IRC). The review is followed by an analysis of its implications as well as the emergent roadmap for the future. The review documents a trend of modernizing, humanizing, and professionalizing Israeli medical education in general, and BME in particular, independently in each of the medical schools. Suggested improvements include an increased emphasis on interactive learner-centered rather than frontal teaching formats, clinical simulation, interprofessional training, and establishment of a national medical training forum for faculty development. In addition, collaboration should be enhanced between medical educators and health care providers, and among the medical schools themselves. The five schools admitted about 730 Israeli students in 2015, doubling admissions from 2000. In 2014, the number of new licenses, including those awarded to Israeli international medical graduates (IMGs), surpassed for the first time in more than a decade the estimated need for 1100 new physicians annually. About 60Â % of the licenses awarded in 2015 were to IMGs. Israeli BME is undergoing continuous positive changes, was supplied with a roadmap for even further improvement by the IRC, and has doubled its output of graduates. The numbers of both Israeli graduates and IMGs are higher than estimated previously and may address the historically projected physician shortage. However, it is not clear whether the majority of newly licensed physicians, who were trained abroad, have benefited from similar recent improvements in medical education similar to those benefiting graduates of the Israeli medical schools, nor is it certain that they will benefit from the further improvements that have recently been recommended for the Israeli\n\n[Dr. Moshe Sherman--the first otolaryngologist in Eretz-Israel: 100 years since his arrival].\n\nPubMed\n\nGolz, Avishay; Netzer, Aviram\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOn 4.8.1911 Dr. Moshe Sherman landed at the port of Jaffa. He was the first otolaryngologist in Eretz-Israel and for one year he was the only specialist in the country. Dr. Sherman was born in Nikolayev (Russia) in 1881. He started his medical education in Odessa, continued in Berlin, graduated in 1907 at the University of Dorpat (Estonia) and pursued postgraduate studies in otolaryngology at Moscow University. He settled in Jaffa, started a private practice and soon became a famous specialist. He volunteered at the Jewish hospital in Jaffa--\"Shaar Zion\", and twice a year spent several weeks in Jerusalem seeing patients and performing small operations. On January 1912 Dr. Sherman, together with another 5 physicians, laid the foundations for the first doctors' organization in Israel: \"The Medical Society of Jaffa and Jaffa district\". In 1918 Dr. Sherman was elected consultant at the Hadassah Hospital in Tel Aviv, and in 1932 a department for ear, nose and throat diseases was established there under his management. He was the founder and first chairman of the Ototaryngology Society in Eretz-Israel, and in 1935 was elected the chairman of the Jewish Medical Association in Eretz-Israel (later--its honorary president). He was the initiator and founder of the \"World Fellowship\", and the Editor in Chief of 'Harefuah' and \"Michtav Lachaver\". Dr. Sherman was the author of numerous papers related to his specialty and to the history of Jewish organizations in Eretz-Israel and, later, in the State of Israel.

In Israel, envenomations are the third most frequent cause of poisonings that are of moderate to major clinical severity. Most studies focus on the clinical descriptions of snakebites in tropical climates, and we sought to investigate the association between snakebite frequency and meteorological parameters. We sought to investigate the seasonality of snakebites and evaluate the association between increasingly common heat waves and other meteorological parameters and snakebite frequency in a semiarid nontropical climate. We obtained data for all medical evacuations (2008-2015) because of snakebites in Israel. Climate data included daily 24-hour average temperature (Â°C) and relative humidity (%). We used a time-stratified case crossover method, in which a conditional logistic regression was applied to estimate the association, and we also stratified our analysis by season and by region. We identified 1234 snakebite cases over 8Â years, of which most (74.2%) occurred in hot seasons and between 6 pm and 9 pm. The risk of snakebite was positively associated with temperature >23Â°C (odds ratio [OR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.53) and inversely with humidity >40% (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.97). We also found an association with heat waves both in cold (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.01-2.60) and hot seasons (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18-1.92). In a semiarid nontropical climate, we observed an association between an increase in the number of snakebite cases and higher temperatures and lower humidity. Moreover, heat waves increased the frequency of snakebites in both cold and hot seasons. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A discussion on the indications and contraindications of the medical use of cannabis and on the changes of the regulatory framework has already begun in Germany. It is useful to draw from the experiences of other countries with a more liberal medical use of cannabis. The Israeli and Canadian experience is outlined by physicians who have been charged with expertise on the medical use of cannabis by their jurisdiction. In Israel, only the plant-based cannabinoid nabiximol (mixture of tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol) can be prescribed for spasticity/chronic pain in multiple sclerosis and for cancer pain. The costs of nabiximole are reimbursed by some, but not by all health maintenance organizations. The medical use of marijuana is permitted; however, it is strictly regulated by the government. Selected companies are allowed to produce marijuana for medical use, and only certain physicians are licensed to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic drug for specific indications such as chronic neuropathic, and cancer pain, inflammatory bowel diseases, or posttraumatic stress disorder if conventional treatments have failed. The costs of marijuana are not reimbursed by health insurance companies. In Canada, synthetic cannabinoids and the plant-based (nabiximol) are licensed for neuropathic and cancer pain, HIV-related anorexia and chemotherapy-associate nausea. The costs of these synthetic cannabinoids are covered by health insurance companies. The medical use of marijuana as a treatment option is allowed for individual patients suffering from any medical condition when authorized by a medical practitioner or nurse. Licensed producers are the only source for patients to newly access medical cannabis, although those with previous permission to grow may continue cultivation at the present time.

Plastic surgery, which has progressed significantly during the 20th century, has also grown rapidly in the new state. The arrival of Jewish plastic surgeons from all over the world with the knowledge and experience gained in their countries of origin, as well as the need for reconstructive surgical treatment for many combat injured soldiers, also contributed to the development of plastic surgery. This review tells the story of plastic surgery in Israel, since its foundation until nowadays. This article reviews the work of the founders of plastic surgery in Israel, indicating significant milestones in its development, and clinical and scientific contribution to the international plastic surgery profession. Moreover, the article describes the current condition of the field of plastic surgery in Israel and presents the trends and the future challenges facing the next generation of plastic surgery in Israel.\n\nMedicine Among New Immigrants and Arab Minorities in Israel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMishkin, Seymour\n\n1965-01-01\n\nThe reaction to modern medicine and the general health of the new immigrants and Arab populations of Israel are described.

The population genetics analysis of the 5HTTL gene showed the highest frequency of the SS genotype 5-HTTLPR in sportsmen (p = 0.04), as well as the trend toward higher frequency of united genotypes of the locus of 5-HTTLPR VNTR and SNP rs25531--SASA (p = 0.06) in comparison with the control group. As for the polymorphisms for other genes 5-HT1A (rs6295), 5-HT2A (rs6311), and MAOA (VNTR), we found no significant differences between the groups tested. Using the NEO PI-R questionnaire we analyzed the possible correlations between the genotypes and the psychological traits in our samples. It was demonstrated that the athletic success in elite sportsmen was associated with lower openness to experience and higher conscientiousness. The interaction effect of the gender and 5-HT2A on the self-rating for openness to experience, interaction effect of the level of the sport success and 5-HT2A, and the interaction effect of the gender and 5-HT1A genotype on self-reported conscientiousness were observed as a trend.\n\nAttitudes and Beliefs Associated with Mammography in a Multiethnic Population in Israel\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBaron-Epel, Orna\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis article highlights beliefs, attitudes, and barriers that are associated with mammography use in four distinct cultural and ethnic groups in Israel: veteran, ultra-orthodox, and immigrant Jewish and Arab women.

Ninety cases of depressive disorder at the acute stage were randomized into a combined therapy group and a medication group, 45 cases in each one. In the medication group, SSRIs were prescribed forl oral administration, once or twice a day, continuously for 4 weeks. In the combined therapy group, on the basis of treatment as the medication group, acupuncture was combined. The main acupoints were Baihui (GV 20), Yintang (GV 29), Shenting (GV 24), Fengchi (GB 20), Dazhui (GV 14) and Sishencong (EX-HN 1), once every two. days, continuously for 4 weeks. Before treatment, and after the 1st, 2nd and 4th weeks of treatment, the Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) was used to evaluate the depression severity. Separately, before and after the 4 weeks of treatment, the levels of serum 5-HT, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were determined and compared with those in 45 cases of the healthy group. HAMD score was reduced in the 1st, 2nd and 4th weeks of treatment as compared with that before treatment in the combined therapy group (all P<0 01). HAMD score was reduced in the 2nd and 4th weeks of treatment as compared with that before treatment in the medication group (all P<0. 01).

Early compounds (mosapride, cisapride, renzapride, tegaserod) were identified before several of the 5-HT receptors were even described (including 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(2B)), whereas prucalopride came later. Several compounds were hampered by non-selectivity, introducing cardiac liability (cisapride: activity at human Ether-a-go-go Related Gene) or potentially, a reduced intestinal prokinetic activity caused by activity at a second 5-HT receptor (renzapride: antagonism at the 5-HT(3) receptor; tegaserod: antagonism at the 5-HT(2B) receptor). Poor intrinsic activity at gastrointestinal 5-HT(4) receptors has also been an issue (mosapride, tegaserod). Perhaps prucalopride has now achieved the profile of good selectivity of action and high intrinsic activity at intestinal 5-HT(4) receptors, without clinically-meaningful actions on 5-HT(4) receptors in the heart. The progress of this compound for treatment of chronic constipation, as well as competitor molecules such as ATI-7505 and TD-5108, will now be followed with interest as each attempts to differentiate themselves from each other. Perhaps at last, 5-HT(4) receptor agonists are being given the chance to show what they can do.\n\nOCD is associated with an altered association between sensorimotor gating and cortical and subcortical 5-HT1b receptor binding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPittenger, Christopher; Adams, Thomas.

This effect may be related to abnormalities in the serotonin (5-HT) system. 5-HT1B agonists can impair PPI, produce OCD-like behaviors in animals, and exacerbate OCD symptoms in humans. We measured 5-HT1B receptor availability using 11C-P943 positron emission tomography (PET) in unmedicated, non-depressed OCD patients (n = 12) and matched healthy controls (HC; n = 12). Usable PPI data were obtained from 20 of these subjects (10 from each group). There were no significant main effects of OCD diagnosis on 5-HT1B receptor availability (11C-P943 BPND); however, the relationship between PPI and 11C-P943 BPND differed dramatically and significantly between groups. 5-HT1B receptor availability in the basal ganglia and thalamus correlated positively with PPI in controls; these correlations were lost or even reversed in the OCD group. In cortical regions there were no significant correlations with PPI in controls, but widespread positive correlations in OCD patients. Positive correlations between 5-HT1B receptor availability and PPI were consistent across diagnostic groups only in two structures, the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala. Differential associations of 5-HT1B receptor availability with PPI in patients suggest functionally important alterations in the serotonergic regulation of cortical/subcortical balance in OCD.

We made computerized queries and descriptive analyses of the medical records database of the IPIC during 2012. A total of 31,519 poison exposure cases were recorded, a 157.6% increase compared with 1995. Children < 6 years of age were involved in 43.1% of cases; 74.0% of calls were made by the public and 23.7% by physicians; 74.8% of exposures were unintentional and 9.1% intentional. Chemicals were involved in 35.8% of all cases (single and multiple substances), pharmaceuticals in 48.8%, bites and stings in 3.8%, and plants and mushrooms in 1.6%. Substances most frequently involved were analgesics, cleaning products and antimicrobials. Clinical severity was moderate/major in 3.4%. Substances most frequently involved in moderate/major exposures were corrosives, insecticides and snake venom. Four fatalities were recorded; all were intentional exposures in adults (corrosive, medications, energy drink). Poison exposures and poisonings have increased significantly and have contributed substantially to morbidity and mortality in Israel. The IPIC database is a valuable national resource for the collection and monitoring of poisoning exposure cases. It can be used as a real-time surveillance system for the benefit of public health. It is recommended that reporting to the IPIC become mandatory and its activities be adequately supported by national resources.\n\nPHP-HT (VitaResc Biotech).\n\nPubMed\n\nBaldwin, A; Wiley, E\n\n2001-04-01\n\nVitaResc (formerly Apex) is developing PHP-HT, pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate, for the potential treatment of nitric oxide-induced shock (characterized by hypotension), associated with various etiologies, initially in septic shock. A phase I safety study and an initial phase I/II patient trial for NO-induced shock have been completed, and VitaResc has enrolled patients in three of five planned cohorts in a continuation of these trials to include a protocol of continuous infusion and dose escalation [330680,349187,390918]. The results from the dose escalation trials are expected to provide the basis for a randomized, controlled phase II/III pivotal trial of PHP-HT [390918]. VitaResc has licensed PHP-HT exclusively from Ajinomoto for all indications, worldwide, except Japan [275263]. Ajinomoto originally developed the human derived and chemically modified hemoglobin preparation as a blood substitute, but no development has been reported by the company since 1997 [275277,303577]. The other potential indications of PHP-HT include shock associated with burns, pancreatitis, hemodialysis and cytokine therapies [275277].

They were young doctors in their late twenties or even mid-thirties, graduates of European medical schools. Educated, independent women, with high motivation and belief in the future of medicine in the country, they worked unceasingly, with devotion and determination and invested most of their efforts and knowledge in creating medical institutions there, in order that a new generation, sound in mind and body, might flourish. These doctors came with a sense of vocation, viewing medicine as a national, Zionist mission and not merely a source of income. Despite the contribution these first doctors made to the creation of the health system in this country, they remained largely anonymous, while their medical and social involvement has been largely ignored in the historical literature. This paper focuses on twenty-two women who successfully completed their medical studies in European institutions, followed by emigration to Eretz Israel between 1900 and 1918.

Methods PubMed and the National Institute for Health Research Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, conferences of 4 organizations (ie, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, American Society of Clinical Oncology, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, and Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer), and the bibliographies of relevant articles were queried for the medical subject headings and key terms of âondansetron,â âgranisetron,â âpalonosetron,â âdolasetron mesylate,â âcosts,â âcost analysis,â and âeconomics.â We included records published (full-length articles after 1997 and conference presentations after 2010) in English and with human patients, reporting data on cost and utilization (rescue medication, outpatient and inpatient services) associated with the use of 5-HT3RAs for the treatment or prevention of CINV. Results Of the 434 identified studies, 32 are included in the current analysis: 7 studies report costs, 18 report utilization, and 7 studies report both. The costs are reported in US dollars (7 studies), in Euros (5 studies), and in Canadian dollars (2 studies). The studies vary in designs, patients, 5-HT3RA regimens, and the definition of outcomes. The US studies report higher drug costs for CINV prophylaxis with palonosetron compared with ondansetron, lower medical outpatient and inpatient costs for palonosetron versus other 5-HT3RAs, and higher acquisition costs for palonosetron versus ondansetron or other 5-HT3RAs. Fewer patients receiving palonosetron versus with\n\nAssociation between 5HT2A polymorphism and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced sexual desire disorder (SDD) among Malaysian women.\n\nPubMed\n\nMasiran, Ruziana; Sidi, Hatta; Mohamed, Zahurin; Mohamed Saini, Suriati; Nik Jaafar, Nik Ruzyanei\n\n2013-04-01\n\nSSRIs are known for their sexual side-effects with a variable rate of sexual dysfunction (SD). 5HT2A (rs6311) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was found to have significant association with SD. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of female SDD, its clinical correlates and association with 5HT2A (rs6311) SNP in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with SSRIs. This was a cross-sectional study. We evaluated 95 female outpatients with MDD treated with SSRIs who were in remission. Outcome measures were stratified by the presence or absence of SDD. A buccal swab was obtained from each patient and sent for genotyping in the Pharmacogenomics and Medical Biotechnology Laboratory of Universiti Malaya. The overall prevalence of female SD was 32.6%. The prevalence of female SDD was 62.1%. Those with arousal problem, lubrication problem, sexual satisfaction problem, orgasm problem and problematic marriage were more likely to have sexual desire disorder. The majority of participants who had sexual desire disorder had genotype TT (42.4%) but there was no significant association observed. After controlling for age, number of children, education level, SSRI type, lubrication problem, orgasm problem, satisfaction problem and marital problem, only arousal problem significantly enhanced the presence of sexual desire disorder by 8.5 times (odds ratioâ=â8.46, 95% confidence intervalâ=â1.24-57.58; Pâ=â0.018). This study showed that there was no significant association between SDD and the 5HT2A (rs6311) SNP. Arousal problem significantly enhanced the presence of sexual desire disorder.

The aim of this descriptive study was to investigate the management practices of first-episode schizophrenia in a cohort of patients in Israel and to document use of the various \"typical\" or \"atypical\" antipsychotic agents. Fifty-one consecutive patients (26 M, 25 F) with first-episode psychosis were recruited for study participation and were administered either typical or atypical antipsychotic medications in a naturalistic manner. While an approximately equal number of subjects received typical and atypical medications at illness onset, a prominent shift to atypical antipsychotic treatment occurred over the study course; 18 subjects had medication class shifts: 17 from typical to atypical, and one from atypical to typical. Negative symptoms did not affect length of hospitalization, but were associated with aggression. Higher depression rates were noted in patients with long hospitalizations who received typical antipsychotic medications. Immigrants were admitted at an age approximately four years older than native-born Israelis. The prominent shift from \"typical\" to \"atypical\" antipsychotic medications may indicate sensitivity of first-episode psychotic patients to side-effects of \"typical\" medications and prominence of use of atypical medications in this patient subpopulation be it due to improved efficacy over time or successful marketing. Unique cultural and population characteristics may contribute to the manifestation of first-episode psychosis and suggest the importance of more effective outreach to the immigrant population in order to manage an apparent treatment delay.\n\nAcanthamoeba keratitis: study of the 5-year incidence in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nGraffi, Shmuel; Peretz, Avi; Jabaly, Haneen; Koiefman, Anna; Naftali, Modi\n\n2013-11-01\n\nAcanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is not a notifiable disease in Israel, so there are no accurate incidence rates for this condition in Israel. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of AK in Israel for the years 2008-2012. We distributed a survey questionnaire to laboratory managers in Israel. The laboratories were affiliated to medical institutes that either provided ophthalmology services or served community ophthalmology clinics. Our questionnaire requested survey respondents to provide information regarding the methods used to diagnose AK, and the number of positive and negative cultures for Acanthamoebae species performed for each of the years from 2008 to 2012. Six laboratories used non-nutrient agar with Escherichia coli as the culture medium, one used calcofluor-white staining with fluorescent microscopy, and two used PCR for diagnosing AK. Twenty-three AK cases were identified, to give an estimated incidence of 1/1 668 552. AK is mostly attributable to the use of contact lenses. As contact lenses are popular in Israel, we expected a higher incidence rate. A lower than expected incidence rate may indicate insufficient awareness of AK in Israel.\n\n5HT-2C receptor polymorphism in suicide victims. Association studies in German and Slavic populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nStefulj, Jasminka; BÃ¼ttner, Andreas; Kubat, Milovan; Zill, Peter; Balija, Melita; Eisenmenger, Wolfgang; Bondy, Brigitta; Jernej, Branimir\n\n2004-08-01\n\nSustainable observations suggest that suicidal behaviour by itself may have biological correlates, among which those related to the serotonergic synapse hold the key position. Based on the association of suicide and serotonergic dysfunction, it was proposed that genetic mechanisms affecting suicidal behaviour could be related to the alterations of the genes encoding the elements of 5HT synapse. The present study tested the association of the polymorphism in the serotonin 2C (5HT-2C) receptor coding region (Cys23Ser) with suicide commitment. Study was based on two independent samples, one of German (284 suicide victims versus 297 controls) and other of Slavic/Croatian (118 suicide victims versus 275 controls) ethnicity. No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between victims and controls were demonstrated. Results did not provide supporting evidence for the potential involvement of the investigated variants of 5HT-2C receptor in the susceptibility to suicide.\n\nRegulatory tasks of national medical associations - international comparison and the Israeli case\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground In many countries, NMAs, along with other stakeholders, play a part in the regulation of physicians. The purpose of this paper is to compare and explain the level of involvement of NMAs in physician regulation in several developed countries, with a specific emphasis on Israel. Methods The authors conducted a review of the literature on physician regulation, focusing on licensing and registration, postgraduate training and physician disciplinary measures. Detailed country specific information was also obtained via the websites of relevant NMAs and regulatory bodies and correspondence with select NMAs. Five test cases were examined in detail: Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Israeli case will be discussed at greater length. Results Medical licensing usually lies in the hands of the government (on the national or state level). Specialist training, on the other hand, is often self-regulated and entrusted in the hands of the profession, frequently under the direct responsibility of the NMA, as in Israel, the Netherlands and Germany. In all the countries presented, other than Germany, the NMA is not involved in instituting disciplinary procedures in cases of alleged physician misconduct. Discussion The extent to which NMAs fulfill regulatory functions varies greatly from country to country. The relationship between government and the profession in the area of regulation often parallels the dominant mode of governance in the health care system as a whole. Specifically, the level of involvement of the Israeli Medical Association in medical regulation is a result of political, historical and ideological arrangements shaped vis-Ã -vis the government over the years. Conclusions In Continental Europe, co-operation between the NMA and the government is more common than in the USA and the UK. The Israeli regulatory model emerged in a European-like fashion, closer to the Netherlands than to Germany. The Israeli case, as\n\nIs Israel ready for disease management?\n\nPubMed\n\nLinden, Ariel\n\n2006-10-01\n\nApproximately 60% of all worldwide deaths are caused by chronic disease resulting from modifiable health behaviors. In the United States, structured programs tailored to identify and modify health behaviors of patients with chronic illness have grown into a robust industry called disease management. DM is premised upon the basic assumption that health services utilization and morbidity can be reduced for those with chronic illness by augmenting traditional episodic medical care services and support between physician visits. Given that Israel and the U.S. have similar demographics in their chronically ill populations, it would make intuitive sense for Israel to replicate efforts made in the U.S. to incorporate DM strategies. This paper provides a conceptual framework of how DM could be integrated within the current organizational structure of the Israeli healthcare system, which is uniquely conducive to the implementation of DM on a population-wide basis. While ultimately the decision to invest in DM lies with stakeholders at various institutional levels in Israel, this paper is intended to provide direction and support for that decision-making process.\n\n[The organization of Jewish dentists in pre-Israel Palestine].\n\nPubMed\n\nKeren-Kratz, M\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe first modern dental institutes were established in Europe and in the USA during the 1840s. At that period there wasn't a single qualified doctor in Palestine, not to mention a professional dentist. A couple of decades later, as the number of Christian pilgrims grew, some modern hospitals were established and a few non-Jewish dentists opened their clinics in Jerusalem, which was then and in the following decades, the region's largest city. In Europe, dentistry became a popular profession among Jews in general and among Jewish women in particular. The first Jewish dentist settled in Jerusalem in the mid-1880s. Other dentists were slow to arrive and their number began to grow only after the turn of the 20th century. Their professional education varied from those who were trained as apprentices by other dentists to those which studied a couple of years in an academic dental school. The devastation caused by WWI prompted American-Zionist organizations to send a special medical unit to Palestine in 1918. Along medical supplies it also brought a small group of doctors and dentists. The two American dentists that decided to remain in Palestine took upon themselves to spread their medical and scientific knowledge. They also organized the dentists, whose number grew considerably during the 1920s, and called the authorities to regulate the dental profession. In 1926 the British authorities issued a decree regulating all medical professions. It demanded that dental practitioners will be licensed after proving their previous studies and professional knowledge. In 1931, local dentists' organizations decided to establish the Palestine Dental Association. Five years later it was accepted as a member by the International Dental Federation (FDI) and was recognized by the local authorities. Since the 1930s, prominent Jewish dentists from abroad were invited to come to Palestine to lecture, and local dentists participated in international conferences. This prompted the first\n\nRisk-seeking for losses is associated with 5-HTTLPR, but not with transient changes in 5-HT levels.\n\nPubMed\n\nNeukam, Philipp T; Kroemer, Nils B; Deza Araujo, Yacila I; Hellrung, Lydia; Pooseh, Shakoor; Rietschel, Marcella; Witt, Stephanie H; Schwarzenbolz, Uwe; Henle, Thomas; Smolka, Michael N\n\n2018-05-05\n\nSerotonin (5-HT) plays a key role in different aspects of value-based decision-making. A recent framework proposed that tonic 5-HT (together with dopamine, DA) codes future average reward expectations, providing a baseline against which possible choice outcomes are compared to guide decision-making. To test whether high 5-HT levels decrease loss aversion, risk-seeking for gains, and risk-seeking for losses. In a first session, 611 participants were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and performed a mixed gambles (MGA) task and two probability discounting tasks for gains and losses, respectively (PDG/PDL). Afterwards, a subsample of 105 participants (44 with S/S, 6 with S/L, 55 with L/L genotype) completed the pharmacological study using a crossover design with tryptophan depletion (ATD), loading (ATL), and balanced (BAL) conditions. The same decision constructs were assessed. We found increased risk-seeking for losses in S/S compared to L/L individuals at the first visit (pâ=â0.002). Neither tryptophan depletion nor loading affected decision-making, nor did we observe an interaction between intervention and 5-HTTLPR genotype. Our data do not support the idea that transient changes of tonic 5-HT affect value-based decision-making. We provide evidence for an association of 5-HTTLPR with risk-seeking for losses, independent of acute 5-HT levels. This indicates that the association of 5-HTTLPR and risk-seeking for losses is mediated via other mechanisms, possibly by differences in the structural development of neural circuits of the 5-HT system during early life phases.\n\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy in the pediatric patient: the experience of the Israel Naval Medical Institute.\n\nPubMed\n\nWaisman, D; Shupak, A; Weisz, G; Melamed, Y\n\n1998-11-01\n\nThe pediatric patient is to be found in hyperbaric facilities throughout the world, receiving hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy for both life-threatening and chronic diseases. To review the experience accumulated at the Israel Naval Medical Institute in the treatment of pediatric patients. A retrospective analysis and review of all records of patients younger than age 18 years. Between 1980 and 1997, 139 pediatric patients age 2 months to 18 years (mean, 7.7 years) received HBO treatment at the Israel Naval Medical Institute. Of the children, 111 (79%) suffered from acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning; 13 (9.2%) were treated after crush injury, traumatic ischemia, or compartment syndrome; 4 (2.8%) had clostridial myonecrosis; 1 (0.7%) had necrotizing fasciitis; 5 (3.6%) had refractory osteomyelitis; 2 (1.4%) had suffered massive air embolism; 2 (1.4%) had purpura fulminans; and 1 (0.7%) suffered from decompression sickness. Outcome, judged by neurologic sequelae, mortality, and extent of soft tissue loss and limb amputation, was favorable in 129 patients (93%). Two patients (1.4%) died, 1 as a result of CO poisoning and the other, gas gangrene; 2 of the patients in the CO group (1.4%) remained with neurologic sequelae, and 6 patients in the acute traumatic ischemia group (4.3%) underwent limb amputation. We had a favorable experience with 129 of a total 139 pediatric patients treated at our facility for the indications listed. A basic knowledge of HBO therapy is needed to refer the pediatric patient for treatment when indicated. The needs of the pediatric patient, especially the critically ill, require specific skills and equipment inside the hyperbaric chamber. Close collaboration between the pediatrician and the hyperbaric medicine physician is essential to ensure adequate care for infants and children.\n\nBrucellosis Outbreak in Children and Adults in Two Areas in Israel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMegged, Orli; Chazan, Bibiana; Ganem, Atef; Ayoub, Abeer; Yanovskay, Anna; Sakran, Waheeb; Miron, Dan; Dror-Cohen, Ahuva; Kennes, Yoram; Berdenstein, Svetlana; Glikman, Daniel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTwo parallel outbreaks of Brucella melitensis infection occurred in 2014 in two geographical areas in Israel. In two medical centers in northern Israel and one medical center in Jerusalem, 102 patients (58 children, 47 adults) were diagnosed with brucellosis. Most patients (N = 76, 72%) were Muslim Arabs, 28 (27%) were Druze, and one was Jewish. The source of infection was often traced to cheese from the Palestinian Authority. Biovar-1 was evident in 98% in northern Israel but only in 42% in Jerusalem. Most common manifestations were fever (82%) and osteoarticular symptoms (49%). The major differences between the geographic areas were ethnicity and duration until diagnosis. Compared with adults, children had higher rates of hospitalization (93% versus 64%, P = 0.001), osteoarticular symptoms (60% versus 36%, P = 0.05), elevated alanine aminotransferase (12% versus 0%, P = 0.01), and lower C-reactive protein (2.28 Â± 2.08 versus 5.57 Â± 6.3l mg/dL, P = 0.001). Two unrelated brucellosis outbreaks occurred in 2014 in two different geographic areas of Israel and were limited to sections of the Arab and Druze populations. Most of the demographic and clinical aspects of patients were not affected by geographic variability. Clinical and laboratory differences were found between children and adults emphasizing the nonuniformity of the disease in different age groups. Effective control of unpasteurized dairy foods, health education programs, and improved regional cooperation are required to control brucellosis in Israel.

It is widely accepted, while not openly declared, that Israel has nuclear weapons, and that Iran has enriched enough nuclear material to build them. The medical consequences of a nuclear exchange between Iran and Israel in the near future are envisioned, with a focus on the distribution of casualties in urban environments. Methods Model estimates of nuclear war casualties employed ESRI's ArcGIS 9.3, blast and prompt radiation were calculated using the Defense Nuclear Agency's WE program, and fallout radiation was calculated using the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC) V404SP4, as well as custom GIS and database software applications. Further development for thermal burn casualties was based on Brode, as modified by Binninger, to calculate thermal fluence. ESRI ArcGISTM programs were used to calculate affected populations from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's LandScanTM 2007 Global Population Dataset for areas affected by thermal, blast and radiation data. Results Trauma, thermal burn, and radiation casualties were thus estimated on a geographic basis for three Israeli and eighteen Iranian cities. Nuclear weapon detonations in the densely populated cities of Iran and Israel will result in an unprecedented millions of numbers of dead, with millions of injured suffering without adequate medical care, a broad base of lingering mental health issues, a devastating loss of municipal infrastructure, long-term disruption of economic, educational, and other essential social activity, and a breakdown in law and order. Conclusions This will cause a very limited medical response initially for survivors in Iran and Israel. Strategic use of surviving medical response and collaboration with international relief could be expedited by the predicted casualty\n\nTrauma and identification of victims of suicidal terrorism in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nHiss, J; Kahana, T\n\n2000-11-01\n\nThe postmortem examination and identification procedures performed by medical and law enforcement personnel involved in mass disaster management in Israel are reported. The Israel National Police, the Israel Defense Forces, and the L. Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine's experts examined 171 victims who died in 21 incidents of suicidal terrorism. The trauma sustained by the victims and perpetrators of suicidal bombings included complete body disruption and explosive, flying missile, and blast injuries. The modus operandi of the perpetrators, reconstructed from the distribution and type of injury of the victims, is discussed. Fifty-five victims perished in open space bombings and 91 inside buses. All perpetrators of these bombings died at the time of the incident regardless of their location. Identification of the victims was achieved using fingerprints, dental records, medical intervention signs, anatomic variation, genetic profile, and personal recognition. Prompt identification of the perpetrators allowed speedy apprehension of the accomplices and prevention of similar attacks. Collaboration between the different forensic, military, and law enforcement teams increased the efficiency of disaster management efforts.\n\nHaliotis tuberculata hemocyanin (HtH): analysis of oligomeric stability of HtH1 and HtH2, and comparison with keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH1 and KLH2.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarris, J R; Scheffler, D; Gebauer, W; Lehnert, R; Markl, J\n\n2000-12-01\n\nan almost 100% conversion into didecamers, whereas the HtH2 subunit produced a mixture containing large numbers of short multidecamers and relatively few didecamers, together with a considerable number of smaller diameter helical/tubular polymers. The association properties of the HtH1 and HtH2 decamers, and the subunit reassociation, firmly indicate the integrity and structural competency of the protein under the experimental conditions used. Data on the association of KLH2 decamers is also presented, which together with previously published data on the association KLH1 decamers and the reassociation of KLH1 and KLH2 subunits, enables a detailed comparison of the two hemocyanin isoforms from both molluscan species to be made. Biochemical manipulation of the oligomer states and the subunit reassociation of molluscan hemocyanins can usefully be assessed by the study of negatively stained TEM specimens.\n\nProgress in palliative care in Israel: comparative mapping and next steps\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPalliative care was established rapidly in some countries, while in other countries its establishment has taken a different trajectory. This paper identifies core steps in developing a medical specialty and examines those taken by Israel as compared with the US and England for palliative care. It considers the next steps Israel may take. Palliative care aims to provide quality of life for those with serious illnesses by attending to the illness-prompted physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs of patients and their families. It has ancient roots in medicine; its modern iteration began against the backdrop of new cures and life-sustaining technology which challenged conceptions of how to respect the sanctity of life. The first modern hospice was created by Saunders; it provided proof that palliative care works, and this has occurred in Israel as well (the first step). Another key step is usually skills development among clinicians; in Israel, few education and training opportunities exist so far. Specialty recognition also has not yet occurred in Israel. Service development remains limited and a major shortage of services exists, compared to the US. Research capacity in Israel is also limited. Policy to develop and sustain palliative care in Israel is underway; in 2009, the Ministry of Health established policy for implementing palliative care. However, it still lacks a financially viable infrastructure. We conclude that palliative care in Israel is emerging but has far to go. Adequate resource allocation, educational guidelines, credentialed manpower and specialty leadership are the key factors that palliative care development in Israel needs.

Current evidence points towards native 5-HT(3) receptors originating from homomeric assemblies of 5-HT(3A) or heteromeric assembly of 5-HT(3A) and 5-HT(3B). Novel genes encoding 5-HT(3C), 5-HT(3D), and 5-HT(3E) have recently been described but the functional importance of these proteins is unknown. In the present study, in silico analysis (confirmed by partial cloning) indicated that 5-HT(3C), 5-HT(3D), and 5-HT(3E) are not human-specific as previously reported: they are conserved in multiple mammalian species but are absent in rodents. Expression profiles of the novel human genes indicated high levels in the gastrointestinal tract but also in the brain, Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) and other tissues. Following the demonstration that these subunits are expressed at the cell membrane, the functional properties of the recombinant human subunits were investigated using patch clamp electrophysiology. 5-HT(3C), 5-HT(3D), and 5-HT(3E) were all non-functional when expressed alone. Co-transfection studies to determine potential novel heteromeric receptor interactions with 5-HT(3A) demonstrated that the expression or function of the receptor was modified by 5-HT(3C) and 5-HT(3E), but not 5-HT(3D). The lack of distinct effects on current rectification, kinetics or pharmacology of 5-HT(3A) receptors does not however provide unequivocal evidence to support a direct contribution of 5-HT(3C) or 5-HT(3E) to the lining of the ion channel pore of novel heteromeric receptors. The functional and pharmacological contributions of these novel subunits to human biology and diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome for which 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists have major clinical usage, therefore remains to be fully determined.\n\nBioethics governance in Israel: an expert regime.\n\nPubMed\n\nShalev, Carmel; Hashiloni-Dolev, Yael\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper provides an overview of bioethics governance in Israel through an analytical description of the legal framework for the interface between individuals and biomedical practices. There is no national agency with general oversight of bioethics policy and decision making, and the rules that apply to individual usage of biomedical technologies are laid down in a multitude of different statutes, regulations and administrative directives. Expert committees play a central role in this regulatory system in two capacities: as governmental advisory bodies that recommend policy; and as decision-making bodies that resolve conflicts around patients' rights or grant individual access to biomedical technologies. This decentralised system of governance through expert committees allows for adaptation to dynamic technological developments and flexibility in accommodating creative societal usage. At the same time the experts are the agents of the state's bio-power at the expense of personal autonomy and open public deliberation. The paper is part of a larger study investigating Israel's bioethics governance and its regime of experts, which includes an examination of the normative level of regulation, and an analysis of the composition of the expert committees. Our findings suggest that Israel has a decentralised system of governance with piecemeal regulation that has established a bioethics technocracy, governed by the ministry of health and dominated by the medical profession. The present paper is confined to a description and discussion of the legal framework of Israel's expert bioethics regime. Here, our major conclusion is that Israel has established a technocracy of official expert ethics committees, which controls life and death decisions.\n\nPromoting meaningful use of health information technology in Israel: ministry of health vision.\n\nPubMed\n\nGerber, Ayala; Topaz, Maxim Max\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) of Israel has overall responsibility for the healthcare system. In recent years the MOH has developed strong capabilities in the areas of technology assessment and prioritization of new technologies. Israel completed the transition to computerized medical records a decade ago in most care settings; however, the processes in Israel was spontaneous, without government control and standards settings, therefore large variations among systems and among organizations were created. Currently, the main challenge is to convert the information scattered in different systems, to organized, visible information and to make it available to various levels in health management. The MOH's solution is of implementing a selected information system from a specific vendor, at all the hospitals and all HMO's clinics, in order to achieve interoperability. The sys-tem will enable access to the patient's medical record history from any location.\n\nBrucellosis Outbreak in Children and Adults in Two Areas in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nMegged, Orli; Chazan, Bibiana; Ganem, Atef; Ayoub, Abeer; Yanovskay, Anna; Sakran, Waheeb; Miron, Dan; Dror-Cohen, Ahuva; Kennes, Yoram; Berdenstein, Svetlana; Glikman, Daniel\n\n2016-07-06\n\nTwo parallel outbreaks of Brucella melitensis infection occurred in 2014 in two geographical areas in Israel.
