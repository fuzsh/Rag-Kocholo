His brother is actor Finn Wolfhard.\n\nNick’s brother Finn has said:\n\n…Wolfhard means, I think, heart of the wolf in German. What’s funny is I’m German, but then I’m like French – I’m French and German and then Jewish. It’s really weird. I have really weird blood. And then I go to Catholic school, which is really weird.\n\nFinn has also specified:\n\nMy mother was adopted by a family of French, Irish, British and Canadian descent. My mother’s birth mother was from Wales and Ireland, but she didn’t know anything about her birth. Eventually, through genetic testing, my mom found out she was half-Jewish. On the other hand, my father thought he was Jewish, but found out he was actually from Germany and Scandinavia. My dad converted to Catholicism in his 40s, so the past year, he’s been attending Catholic school. It’s pretty complicated, but this is my background.\n\nNick’s maternal great-great-aunt was silent film and theatre actress Rita Jolivet.\n\nNick likely is descended from John Wolfgang Wolfhard, who was born, in 1903, in Bichofingen, Germany.
