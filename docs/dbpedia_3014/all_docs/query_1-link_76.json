In Israel, one can choose whether to take an HIV test in confidential centers (giving one's name under medical confidentiality) or in anonymous centers (Israel AIDS Task Force in Tel Aviv and Beer Sheva, Levinsky Clinic in Tel Aviv and Haparsim Clinic in Haifa]. At least 21% of the clients of the anonymous testing centers in Israel belong to a high risk population in contrast to 2.6% in confidential clinics, and so, in this study, we hypothesize that characterization of sexual behavior patterns in anonymous testing centers might enable us to better characterize sexual behavior patterns in high risk populations. In this cross-sectional study, we used questionnaires distributed in the clinics by the Israel AIDS Task Force in order to characterize their clinic's clients. The questionnaires were completed by the Israel AIDS Task Force consultants during the consultation period at which the anonymous test was performed. Data collected included: gender, age, testing history, specific sexual behaviors and reasons for applying for the current test. A total of 926 questionnaires were collected; 29.9% of them were of female patients. The average age was 29.47 years (1Â±8.66]; 21.3% of the clients were men who have sex with men [MSM]; only 2.3% of the clients belonged to other high risk populations. In all groups, the majority of the patients reported high risk sexual behavior (any sexual contact without a condom) and the average age for the first test was much higher than the average age of first sexual intercourse common in Israel. Women reported more participation in unprotected vaginal intercourse than heterosexual men, and a substantial part of MSM reported performing unprotected\n\nKnowledge of elementary school teachers in Tel-Aviv, Israel, regarding emergency care of dental injuries.\n\nPubMed\n\nFux-Noy, Avia; Sarnat, Haim; Amir, Erica\n\n2011-08-01\n\nImmediate management of traumatized teeth is often critical to the prognosis of the teeth. Most of the traumatic dental injuries occur at home, followed by school. There is a high probability that first aid would be given by lay people such as parents, teachers, or coaches. Knowledge of those people regarding emergency management of dental trauma is crucial for better prognosis. To investigate: (i) the knowledge of elementary school teachers regarding traumatic dental injuries to permanent teeth and emergency treatment, (ii) their source of information, and (iii) the demand for more education in dental trauma. A three-part questionnaire comprised of questions regarding demographic data, attitude, and knowledge about dental injuries was distributed to teachers in 12 elementary schools in the Tel-Aviv area, Israel. The average knowledge score was 4.59 (in a scale of 0-10). Three individual predictors significantly improved the respondents' knowledge: being in the 35-49-year age group (P-value = 0.042), those who had children themselves (P-value = 0.002) and those who had previous experience with trauma (P-value = 0.049). There was no correlation between the demand for further education in dental trauma and knowledge score. The knowledge regarding management of traumatic dental injuries in a group of teachers in the Tel-Aviv area is inadequate. Educational programs as well as addition to the curriculum are necessary to improve their emergency management of traumatic dental injuries and provide better protection to the students.

The main strategy of the facility is based on smartly reducing the size of the compounds collection in similarity clusters and at the same time keeping high diversity of pharmacophores. This strategy allows parallel screening of several patient derived - cells in a personalized screening approach. The tested compounds are repositioned drugs derived from collections of phase III and FDA approved small molecules. In addition, the facility carries screenings using other chemical libraries and toxicological characterizations of nanomaterials.\n\nThe Dialectics of Assimilation and Multiculturalism: The Case of Children of Refugees and Migrant Workers in the Bialik-Rogozin School, Tel Aviv\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDvir, Nurit; Aloni, Nimrod; Harari, Dor\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper focuses on children of refugees and migrant workers from 48 countries who study together in one multicultural school in the city of Tel Aviv, Israel.

Simultaneous monitoring of several air pollutants and noise levels were conducted. The results showed that urban parks can reduce NOx, CO and PM10 and increase O3 concentrations and that park's mitigation effect is greater at higher NOx and PM10 levels. During extreme events, mean values of 413 ppb NOx and 80 Î¼G/m3 PM10 were measured in the street while mean values of 89 ppb NOx and 24 Î¼G/m3 PM10 were measured in the park. Whereas summer highest O3 values of 84 ppb were measured in the street, 94 ppb were measured in the park. The benefit of the urban park in reducing NOx and PM10 concentrations is more significant than the disadvantage of increased O3 levels. Furthermore, urban parks can reduce noise by â¼5 dB(A).

Free medical-care is provided by two walk-in clinics in Tel-Aviv. This study aims to compare the medical complaints of UM from different origins, define their community health needs and assess gaps between medical needs and available services. This cross-sectional study included a random sample of 610 UM aged 18-64Â years, who were treated in these community clinics between 2008 and 2011. The study compared UM who had complex medical conditions which necessitated referral to more equipped medical settings with UM having mild/simple medical conditions, who were treated at the clinics. MHA were younger, unemployed and more commonly males compared with UM originating from other countries. MHA also had longer referral-delays and visited the clinics less frequently. UM with complex medical conditions were more commonly females, had chronic diseases and demonstrated longer referral-delays than those who had mild/simple medical conditions. The latter more commonly presented with complained of respiratory, muscular and skeletal discomfort. In multivariate analysis, the variables which predicted complex medical conditions included female gender, chronic illnes and self-referral to the clinics. The ambulatory clinics were capable of responding to mild/simple medical conditions. Yet, the health needs of women and migrants suffering from complex medical conditions and chronic diseases necessitated referrals to secondary/tertiary medical settings, while jeopardizing the continuity of care. The health gaps can be addressed by a more holistic social approach, which includes integration of UM in universal health insurance.\n\nA tap water turbidity crisis in Tel Aviv, Israel, due to technical failure: toxicological and risk management issues.\n\nPubMed\n\nWinston, Gary; Lerman, Shlomo; Goldberger, Shalom; Collins, Malcolm; Leventhal, Alex\n\n2003-06-01\n\nHerein, we report on the actual events linked to an ammonia spillage into the main waterline of the Tel-Aviv metropolitan area and its surrounding municipalities. Based upon a large magnitude increase of unknown origin in the turbidity and ammonia levels of the main drinking water supply, area residents were warned of possible serious contamination and advised to refrain from drinking tap water until further notice. Turbidity was later linked only to CaCO3, which was precipitated from the water due to the rise in pH caused by the excessive ammonia levels. The source of the ammonia (a malfunction of the measurement buoy in the ammonia tank) was not identified until several days after the warning was issued. The toxicological implications of the turbidity and ammonia elevations are considered and reconciled with the management strategies that followed. Of consequence to the management of this crisis was the approach of Ministry of Health officials to regard the ammonia, from the onset, as an indicator of several possible sources of origin rather than as a contaminant. Decision-making policies were hampered by ineffective communication between the national water supplier and government health officials. An outcome of this crisis was a heightened awareness of the potential of a water crisis occurring during peace time and not only in association with terrorist activities, to which Israeli citizens are highly sensitized. Finally, the present paper may serve to guide municipal environmental and health officials more appropriately in the event of similar drinking water crises in Israel or elsewhere.\n\nThe contribution of cat owners' attitudes and behaviours to the free-roaming cat overpopulation in Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nFinkler, Hilit; Terkel, Joseph\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe attitudes and behaviours of cat owners in regard to treatment of cats may have a cumulative effect on the food availability, reproduction, density and welfare of the free-roaming cat population and thus also on the extent of cat overpopulation. Understanding this is thus a vital step in the a priori planning of cat management programs on any scale, as well as in developing public education programs on this issue. Although recent years have seen an accumulation of knowledge in regard to cat owners' attitudes and behaviours, the findings vary among countries and locations and in Israel this has never been investigated systematically. Using a questionnaire provided to cat owners in veterinary clinics, this study aimed at identifying those attitudes and behaviours that may be contributing to cat overpopulation in Tel Aviv, Israel, and at exploring the socio-economic factors that influence this problem. The findings show that the influential factors can be predicted from the cat owners' socio-economic status, mainly education and income, as well as gender and age. A consistency in those cat owner behaviours that contribute to cat overpopulation was also uncovered, revealing a sub-population of individuals who persist in the undesirable behaviours. Finally, a strong relationship between attitude and consequent behaviour was demonstrated, indicating the importance of education and targeted publicity as a means to influence attitudes and thereby change behaviours in this respect. We propose several measures by which to reduce the current extent of cat owners' contribution to the cat overpopulation: discouraging unwanted owner behaviours such as abandonment of their cats and allowing them to breed; promoting awareness of the neutering option among cat caretakers; and increasing pre-adoption neutering rates in shelters. Regional and national laws promoting responsible pet ownership need to be enacted. By improving the current level of knowledge and awareness among cat\n\nDiffusion of Web Supported Instruction in Higher Education--The Case of Tel-Aviv University\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSoffer, Tal; Nachmias, Rafi; Ram, Judith\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper describes a study that focused on long-term web-supported learning diffusion among lecturers at Tel Aviv University (TAU), from an organizational point of view.

To evaluate the STD burden among MSM and heterosexuals visiting the Tel Aviv walk-in STD clinic. Records of all male patients who attended the clinic once were reviewed to identify demographic characteristics, behavioral attributes, and test results. Between 2002 and 2008, 1064 MSM (22%) and 3755 heterosexuals (78%) visited the clinic once. Positivity rates in MSM for HIV, urethral Neisseria gonorrhoea and infectious syphilis were higher than in heterosexuals (2.5%, 2.5%. 0.7% vs. 0.6%, 1.3%, 0.3%, respectively), while urethral Chlamydia trachomatis was higher in heterosexuals than in MSM (2.7% and 1.4%, respectively). MSM tested in our clinic were younger than heterosexuals (P<0.001), more commonly circumcised (P=0.03) and Israeli-born (P<0.001), used substances during sex (P=0.04), and had prior STD (P<0.001), a greater number of sexual partners (P<0.001), and earlier sexual debut (P=0.02). The final multivariate results for MSM to be diagnosed with HIV/STD were greater number of sexual contacts, previous diagnosis with STD, and infrequent use of condom during anal intercourse. MSM visiting the Levinsky Clinic had higher rates of HIV/STD than heterosexual males, which correlated with their higher-risk behaviors. The unique characteristics of MSM found in our study, such as sex work, substance use, previous diagnosis of STD, multiple partners and inconsistent use of condom during anal sex should be addressed with innovative interventions to prevent STD/HIV in the gay community in Israel.\n\n75 FR 58356 - Mission Statement for Executive-Led Trade Mission to Jordan and Israel\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-09-24\n\n..., geothermal energy, and agro-ecology.

This cross-sectional study included a sub-sample from a random representative National study performed in Israel, which included Jewish males aged 18-44 who completed online anonymous questionnaires regarding their sexual attraction and practices, commercial sex-work, as well as condom and substances' use. Additionally, participants were asked to identify themselves as gay, bisexual, or heterosexual. National estimates regarding prevalence of risk-behaviors and HIV-infection among MSM were based on the Statistical Abstract of Israel and the National HIV Registry, respectively. Of the total sample of 997 men, 11.9% reported lifetime male sex encounters, while 4.5% and 3.7% self-identified as gay or bisexual, respectively. The estimated population of self-identified Jewish gays/bisexuals aged 18-44 in Israel was 94,176, and in Tel-Aviv 33,839. HIV prevalence among MSM was estimated at 0.7% in Israel and 1.0% in Tel-Aviv. MSM were more likely to live in Tel-Aviv, had higher levels of education, and were scored higher on several determinants of sexual risk in comparison to those attracted to women, including early sexual debut, greater number of sexual partners, ever paid/been paid for sex, sexually coerced, and substance use. In conclusion, MSM were involved in greater risk behaviors than those who only had female sex partners. Most MSM were living in Tel-Aviv and their estimated HIV prevalence was 1.0%.\n\nSame-sex sexual attraction, behavior, and practices of Jewish men in Israel and the association with HIV prevalence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMor, Zohar; Davidovich, Udi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nABSTRACT In order to efficiently direct efforts and resources required for the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Israel, it is necessary to define their particular behaviors, estimate their size, and asses the HIV-burden.

We studied C. auris and C. haemulonii clinical isolates from 2 hospitals in central Israel. C. auris was isolated in 5 patients with nosocomial bloodstream infection, and C. haemulonii was found as a colonizer of leg wounds at a peripheral vascular disease clinic. Liberal use of topical miconazole and close contact among patients were implicated in C. haemulonii transmission. C. auris exhibited higher thermotolerance, virulence in a mouse infection model, and ATP-dependent drug efflux activity than C. haemulonii. Comparison of ribosomal DNA sequences found that C. auris strains from Israel were phylogenetically distinct from isolates from East Asia, South Africa and Kuwait, whereas C. haemulonii strains from different countries were closely interrelated. Our findings highlight the pathogenicity of C. auris and underscore the need to limit its spread.\n\n[The beginnings of orthopedic surgery in Israel].\n\nPubMed\n\nTauber, Chanan\n\n2013-08-01\n\nIn early mandatory Israel, orthopedics was mainly conservative, The first modern orthopedic surgeon was Ernst Spira from Czechoslovakia who established an orthopedic service at the Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva and left in 1948 to establish the Orthopedic Department and the Rehabilitation Center in Tel Hashomer, which treated the War of Independence casualties including amputees and victims of spinal cord injuries. A second orthopedic department was opened in Tel Hashomer by Shmuel Weissman who left in 1961 to open the Orthopedic Department at the Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv. Shmuel Weissman became the first Chairman of Orthopedic Surgery at the Tel Aviv University medical school. In 1955, Myer Makin opened a modern orthopedic department in the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem and the Alyn Hospital for crippled children. In 1951, Assaf Harofeh Hospital opened the Department of Orthopedic Surgery headed by Anatol Axer who specialized in the treatment and rehabilitation of polio patients. The majority of the second generation of orthopedic department directors was trained by these four surgeons. Major developments in the 1960s and 1970s were the introduction of the AO system revolutionizing fracture treatment from conservative to operative treatment, the advent of total hip and knee replacements, Harrington instrumentation in spinal surgery and arthroscopy were major advances in orthopedic patient care brought to Israel by the aforementioned second generation of orthopedic surgeons. Hand surgery became an independent subspecialty of orthopedics and was lead by the internationally renowned hand surgeon, Isidore Kessler.\n\nReflections of Changes in Higher Education in Israel: The Case of Social Work Departments\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDavidovich, Nitza; Sharlin, Shlomo\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis study focuses on the profiles of students of social work and examines whether different profiles of students can be identified in various social work programs in Israel's institutions of higher education (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Haifa University, Tel Aviv University and the College of Judea and Samaria).

He was the first otolaryngologist in Eretz-Israel and for one year he was the only specialist in the country. Dr. Sherman was born in Nikolayev (Russia) in 1881. He started his medical education in Odessa, continued in Berlin, graduated in 1907 at the University of Dorpat (Estonia) and pursued postgraduate studies in otolaryngology at Moscow University. He settled in Jaffa, started a private practice and soon became a famous specialist. He volunteered at the Jewish hospital in Jaffa--\"Shaar Zion\", and twice a year spent several weeks in Jerusalem seeing patients and performing small operations. On January 1912 Dr. Sherman, together with another 5 physicians, laid the foundations for the first doctors' organization in Israel: \"The Medical Society of Jaffa and Jaffa district\". In 1918 Dr. Sherman was elected consultant at the Hadassah Hospital in Tel Aviv, and in 1932 a department for ear, nose and throat diseases was established there under his management. He was the founder and first chairman of the Ototaryngology Society in Eretz-Israel, and in 1935 was elected the chairman of the Jewish Medical Association in Eretz-Israel (later--its honorary president). He was the initiator and founder of the \"World Fellowship\", and the Editor in Chief of 'Harefuah' and \"Michtav Lachaver\". Dr. Sherman was the author of numerous papers related to his specialty and to the history of Jewish organizations in Eretz-Israel and, later, in the State of Israel.

These centers have been exposed to 2 distinct forms of violence-sporadic, large-scale terror attacks in the metropolitan areas in the heart of Israel and daily \"war-zone\" conditions in the settlements beyond the 1967 borders of Israel. A semistructured interview and questionnaire survey of a random sample of 314 inhabitants of a suburb of Tel-Aviv, a settlement in the West Bank (Kiryat-Arba), and the Gush-Katif settlement cluster in the Gaza Strip was performed. Symptoms of acute stress and chronic (posttraumatic) stress as well as symptoms of general psychopathology and distress were assessed. The inhabitants of Gush-Katif, in spite of firsthand daily exposure to violent attacks, reported the fewest and least severe symptoms of stress-related complaints, the least sense of personal threat, and the highest level of functioning of all 3 samples. The most severely symptomatic and functionally compromised were the inhabitants of the Tel-Aviv suburb, who were the least frequently and least directly affected by exposure to violent attacks. Because the Gush-Katif population is exclusively religious, the data were reassessed according to religiousness. The religious inhabitants of Kiryat-Arba had almost the same symptom profile as the Gush-Katif population, whereas secular inhabitants of Kiryat-Arba reported faring worse than did either population in the Tel-Aviv suburb. Deeply held belief systems affecting life-views may impart significant resilience to developing stress-related problems, even under extreme conditions. Religiousness combined with common ideological convictions and social cohesion was associated with substantial resilience as compared to a secular metropolitan urban population.\n\nHow is health-related \"deservingness\" reckoned? Perspectives from unauthorized im/migrants in Tel Aviv.\n\nPubMed\n\nWillen, Sarah S\n\n2012-03-01\n\nDo unauthorized im/migrants have a right to health? Do they deserve health care, or health protection, or access to the social determinants of good health? Are they party to prevailing social contracts, or does their exclusion from mainstream systems of health promotion, prevention, and care \"make sense\"? Questions like these, which generate considerable attention in multiple spheres of scholarship, policy, and public debate, revolve around an issue that merits substantially greater consideration among social scientists of health: health-related \"deservingness.\" In addition to putting the issue of health-related deservingness squarely on the map as an object of analysis, this article further argues that we cannot focus solely on those with power, influence, and public voice. Rather, we also must investigate how deservingness is reckoned in relation to--and, furthermore, from the perspectives of-- unauthorized im/migrants and members of other groups commonly constructed in public and policy discourse as undeserving. Additionally, we must consider the complicated relationship between universalizing juridical arguments about formal entitlement to health rights, on one hand, and situationally specific, vernacular moral arguments about deservingness, on the other. The paper analyzes findings from a 29-month mixed-methods study conducted in Tel Aviv, Israel, that approached unauthorized im/migrants as subjects, rather than simply objects, of ethical deliberation. Participants' conceptions of health-related deservingness are investigated using two sources of data: (1) quantitative findings from a self-administered, closed-ended survey conducted with 170 im/migrant patients at an NGO-run Open Clinic (2002-2003), and (2) qualitative findings from the larger ethnographic study of which the survey was part (2000-2010). The study findings both (1) contradict commonly circulating assumptions that unauthorized im/migrants are \"freeloaders,\" and (2) highlight the need for\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians: Prospects for a Two-State Solution\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2010-01-08\n\n20080820%20Two%20State%20Solution%20FEW%20final%20_3_.pdf. 11 Barak Ravid and Natasha Mozgovaya, âSource: Obama Strongly Expressed His Impatience to...98 See Steven J.

This community has undergone a wonderful, nearly exponential growth over the last three decades. How exactly did this happen? There are approximately fifty research groups that focus on developmental biology questions in Israel today that are members of the Israel Society of Developmental Biology (IsSDB; http://issdb.org/). The community has representative groups in a plethora of model systems, such as Nematostella, C. elegans, Drosophila, sea urchin, ascidians, zebrafish, Xenopus, chick and mouse, as well as plants, representing all the major universities and their branches, which include Bar-Ilan University, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, The University of Haifa, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Tel Aviv University and the Weizmann Institute of Science.\n\nRole of the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipal workers in the treatment of survivors of missile blasts.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilverberg, D S; Sofer, E\n\n1991-01-01\n\nOf the nine missiles that landed on the city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa during the Persian Gulf war, three fell in heavily populated areas. As a result 192 people were sent to hospital and 1,663 (520 families) were left homeless. These were seen and evaluated near the site of the blast by a municipal multidisciplinary team and then sent to one of 15 hotels in and outside the city. There they were treated for acute post-traumatic stress disorder by a municipal health care team (general physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists) and by psychiatrists from a local sick fund. Many acute and chronic medical problems, including attempted suicide, were also encountered. Community outreach programs aimed at high risk groups and several telephone counselling services were also instituted. We believe that it is crucial to train and provide a multidisciplinary team for handling the survivors of major disasters.\n\n[DR. SHOSHANA SZKOP-FRENKIEL: THE FIRST FEMALE PLASTIC SURGEON IN ISRAEL].\n\nPubMed\n\nShehory-Rubin, Zipora\n\n2015-11-01\n\nIn the history of Israeli medicine, Dr. Shoshana Szkop-Frenkiel is regarded as the first plastic surgeon in the country and among the founders of the profession of plastic surgery. This article describes the long road she traveled, from her acceptance into medical studies in Vilna--at a time when the entry of any woman to the faculty of medicine was strictly limited and of Jewish women in particular; her emigration to Eretz Israel and her struggles as she underwent training in internal medicine at the \"Hadassah\" Hospital in Tel-Aviv, when she was denied training as a surgeon; and up to the moment she was accepted by the plastic surgery unit of the Tel Hashomer Hospital and became the first such female practitioner in Israel. Dr. Shoshana Szkop-Frenkiel thus fulfilled a childhood dream to become a surgeon at a time when women were excluded from surgery on the grounds that it called for \"male\" characteristics. This article is intended to illustrate the character of a female doctor pursuing a career in surgery during the time of the British Mandate, to illuminate her professional travails in Israel, and to emphasize her important contribution in the field.\n\n75 FR 5322 - Formations of, Acquisitions by, and Mergers of Bank Holding Companies\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-02-02\n\n....5 percent of the outstanding voting shares of Israel Discount Bank, Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel, and thereby indirectly acquire additional voting shares of Discount Bancorp Inc., and Israel Discount Bank of...\n\nJPRS Report Near East & South Asia\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-03-14\n\nrepresent the wishes of the Iraqi people.

To determine breast-feeding patterns and the association between sociodemographic characteristics and breast-feeding in the Tel Aviv district. The mothers of infants aged 2, 4, 6 and 12 months, attending 59 well-baby clinics in the Tel Aviv district, were interviewed by telephone. Singleton infants who weighed less than 2,000 g and multiple-gestation infants were excluded from the study. The questions covered background data, sociodemographic characteristics of the family, and breast-feeding practices. Stepwise logistic regression was used to analyze the association between breast-feeding and various sociodemographic characteristics. Altogether, 78.5% of the mothers (1,307/1,665) initiated breast-feeding. The rate of breast-feeding at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months was 55.8, 36.8, 29.9 and 11.8%, respectively. Only 35.8% of the infants at 2 months and 11.2% at 6 months were exclusively breast-fed. The mean duration of breast-feeding was 5.2 +/- 0.2 months. Grand multiparas (> or = 5 children) had a significantly higher rate of breast-feeding than women with one to four children (P < 0.001). More likely to breast-feed for 2 weeks or longer were women married to Yeshiva students (odds ratio = 5.3), women with > or = 13 years education (OR = 2.1), and women on maternity leave (OR = 1.6). The predictors for breast-feeding for 6 months or longer were similar. Although the rate of breast-feeding initiation in central Israel was 78.5%, only 29.9% of the mothers continue to breast-feed for 6 months. Already at a young age, an appreciable number of breast-fed infants receive infant formula. Breast-feeding promotion should focus on less educated women, homemakers, and families with one to four children.\n\nSpatial variability of soil and vegetation characteristics in an urban park in Tel-Aviv\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSarah, Pariente; Zhevelev, Helena M.; Oz, Atar\n\n2010-05-01\n\nMosaic-like spatial patterns, consisting of divers soil microenvironments, characterize the landscapes of many urban parks. These microenvironments may differ in their pedological, hydrological and floral characteristics, and they play important roles in urban ecogeomorphic system functioning. In and around a park covering 50 ha in Tel Aviv, Israel, soil properties and herbaceous vegetation were measured in eight types of microenvironments. Six microenvironments were within the park: area under Ceratonia siliqua (Cs-U), area under Ficus sycomorus (Fi-U), a rest area under F. sycomorus (Re-U), an open area with bare soil (Oa-S), an open area with biological crusts (Oa-C), and an open area with herbaceous vegetation (Oa-V). Outside the park were two control microenvironments, located, respectively, on a flat area (Co-P) and an inclined open area (Co-S). The soil was sampled from two depths (0-2 and 5-10 cm), during the peak of the growing season (March). For each soil sample, moisture content, organic matter content, CaCO3 content, texture, pH, electrical conductivity, and soluble ions contents were determined in 1:1 water extraction. In addition, prior to the soil sampling, vegetation cover, number of species, and species diversity of herbaceous vegetation were measured. The barbecue fires and visitors in each of the microenvironments were counted. Whereas the soil organic matter and vegetation in Fi-U differed from those in the control(Co-P, Co-S), those in Oa-V were similar to those in the control. Fi-U was characterized by higher values of soil moisture, organic matter, penetration depth, and vegetation cover than Cs-U. Open microenvironments within the park (Oa-S, Oa-C, Oa-V) showed lower values of soil penetration than the control microenvironments. In Oa-V unique types of plants such as Capsella bursa-pastoris and Anagallis arvensis, which did not appear in the control microenvironments, were found. This was true also for Fi-U, in which species like Oxalis pes\n\nTuberculosis diagnostic delay and therapy outcomes of non-national migrants in Tel Aviv, 1998-2008.\n\nPubMed\n\nMor, Z; Kolb, H; Lidji, M; Migliori, Gb; Leventhal, A\n\n2013-03-21\n\nNon-national migrants have limited access to medical therapy. This study compares diagnostic delay and treatment outcomes of non-insured non-national migrants (NINNM) with insured Israeli citizens (IC) in the Tel Aviv tuberculosis (TB) clinic between 1998 and 2008. Patient delay was the time from symptoms onset to doctor's visit, while system delay was measured from doctor visit to anti-TB therapy administration. We randomly sampled 222 NINNM and 265 IC. NINNM were younger than IC, had lower male to female ratio and fewer smoked. They had less drug/alcohol abuse, more cavitations on chest radiography, longer patient and shorter system delay. Mean patient and system delays of all patients were 25 Â± 14 and 79 Â± 42 days, respectively. In multivariate analysis, being NINNM, asymptomatic or smoking predicted longer patient delay, while being asymptomatic or having additional co-morbidity predicted longer system delay. Treatment success in sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB NINNM was 81% and 95.7% in IC (p=0.01). Treatment success was not associated with patient or system delay. In multivariate analysis, work security and treatment adherence predicted treatment success. NINNM had longer patient delay and worse therapy outcome, while IC had longer system delay. Both delays should be reduced. NINNM should be informed that TB therapy is free and unlinked with deportation.\n\nAbstracts of the 15th Annual Meeting of the Israel Society for Neuroscience Eilat, Israel, December 3â5, 2006\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Israel Society for Neuroscience (ISFN) was founded in 1993 by a group of Israeli leading scientists conducting research in the area of neurobiology. The primary goal of the society was to promote and disseminate the knowledge and understanding acquired by its members, and to strengthen interactions between them. Since then, the society holds its annual meeting every year in Eilat during the month of December. At these annual meetings the senior Israeli neurobiologists, their teams, and their graduate students, as well as foreign scientists and students, present their recent research findings in platform and poster presentations. The meeting also offers the opportunity for the researchers to exchange information with each other, often leading to the initiation of collaborative studies. Both the number of members of the society and of those participating in the annual meeting is constantly increasing, and it is anticipated that this year about 600 scientists will convene at the Princess Hotel in Eilat, Israel.

It is uncertain whether geomagnetic anomalies at a similar scale have existed in the past owing to limited coverage and uncertainties in the paleomagnetic database. Here we provide new evidence from archaeological sources in the Levant suggesting a large positive northern hemisphere anomaly, similar in magnitude to the SAA during the 9th-8th centuries BCE, called ;Levantine Iron Age anomaly;. We also report an additional geomagnetic spike in the 8th century. The new dataset comprises 73 high precision paleointensity estimates from ca. 3000 BCE to 732 BCE, and five directional measurements between the 14th and the 9th centuries BCE. Well-dated pottery and cooking ovens were collected from twenty archaeological strata in two large contemporaneous stratigraphical mounds (tells) in Israel: Tel Megiddo and Tel Hazor. The new data are combined with previously published data and interpreted automatically using the PmagPy Thellier GUI program. The Tel Megiddo and Tel Hazor data sets demonstrate excellent internal consistency and remarkable agreement with published data from Mesopotamia (Syria). The data illustrate the evolution of an extreme geomagnetic high that culminated in at least two spikes between the 11th and the 8th centuries BCE (Iron Age in the Levant). The paleomagnetic directional data of the 9th century BCE show positive inclination anomalies, and deviations of up to 22Â° from the averaged geocentric axial dipole (GAD) direction. From comparison of the Levantine archaeomagnetic data with IGRF model for 2015 we infer the ;Levantine Iron Age anomaly; between the 10th and the 8th centuries BCE is a local positive anomaly. The eastward extent of the anomaly is currently unknown.\n\nTracheal reaction to three different intraluminal stents in an animal model of tracheomalacia.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeinberg, Mark; Sandbank, Judith; Flumenblit, Yoseph; Klin, Baruch; Vinograd, Itzhak\n\n2005-06-01\n\nThree different internal airway stents were studied in an animal model of tracheomalacia: the Palmaz stent (Johnson & Johnson, Warren, New Jersey) and the NIR stent (Medinol Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel)--both made of stainless steel in the form of tubular mesh--and the Nitinol stent, made of nickel-titanium formed into a spiral shape. All three stents could be adequately stabilized in the malacic tracheal segment. The Nitinol stent (Medinol Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel) proved to be less reactive to the tracheal mucosa, demonstrated higher biocompatibility with significantly less granulation tissue formation, and showed superior radial resistance. Extraction of the Nitinol stent also proved to be much smoother. This stent may be the stent of choice in the treatment of tracheo- and bronchomalacia.\n\nKnowledge, attitudes, sexual practices and STI/HIV prevalence in male sex workers and other men who have sex in Tel Aviv, Israel: a cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMor, Zohar; Dan, Michael\n\n2012-12-01\n\nTo explore knowledge, attitudes and sexual practices of male sex workers (MSW) in Tel Aviv in comparison with men who have sex with men (MSM) classified by their risk behaviours and to outline attributes related to sexually transmitted infections (STI)/HIV prevalence. MSW were recruited for this cross-sectional study from designated street venues and gay-dating internet site. MSM were recruited from gay-related venues and divided into high-risk MSM (HRMSM) if they performed unprotected anal intercourse in the last 6 months with an HIV-discordant/unknown partner and to low-risk MSM (LRMSM). Each participant completed a questionnaire and was tested for STI/HIV. Of 87 MSW and 635 MSM approached, 53 (60.9%) and 235 (37.0%) participated, respectively. Street-MSW (N=32) had more female sex partners and were more drug dependent than internet-MSW (N=21). No differences were found in their knowledge regarding STI/HIV transmission, practices and STI/HIV burden. Compared with HRMSM, MSW had different demographic attributes and demonstrated more realistic perception regarding the risk to getting STI/HIV, while no differences were found in their knowledge and sexual practices. STI burden among MSW, HRMSM (N=119) and LRMSM (N=116) were 28.3%, 23.5% and 10.3% (p=0.009) and HIV burden among MSW, HRMSM and LRMSM were 5.6%, 9.2% and 0%, (p=0.001), respectively. Multivariate models evaluating attributes associated with HIV/STI diagnosis did not find sex work to be significant if the variable used was MSW versus HRMSM, regardless of the adjustments performed. However, when MSW versus LRMSM was used in the model, sex work was associated with STI/HIV diagnosis. Street-MSW and internet-MSW, similar to all MSW and HRMSM, had comparable sexual practices and had no difference in their STI/HIV prevalence.\n\nDefense.gov Special Report: Travels with Gates - March 2011\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nin the U.S.-Israel relationship and the implications of dramatic Middle East political shifts were Barak.

This study explored the perceived stress and coping ability of students of the New York State/American Programme, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, who study medicine in Israel but are expected to return to America to practice. Students were surveyed using the Ways of Coping Checklist (WCCL), Appraisal Dimension Scale (ADS) and two instruments specifically designed for the study. The results supported the view that students having difficulty adapting to their new cultural environment also have difficulty at medical school. This pattern is a negative spiral in which anxiety and depression impair cognitive performance, which leads to academic difficulties and emotional distress. Improvements in student social support and primary prevention were implemented as a result of the study.

This study aimed to investigate alteration of soil properties with land usages within urban park and with area size of park. Ten parks differed by size (2 - 50 acres) were chosen, in random, in Tel-Aviv- Jaffa city. Soil was sampled in four microenvironments ((lawn, path, picnic and peripheral area (unorganized area) of each the park)), in three points and three depth (0-2, 5-10 and 10-20 cm). Penetration depth was measured in all point of sampling. For each soil sample electrical conductivity and organic matter content were determined. Averages of penetration depth drastically increased from the most disturbed microenvironments (path and picnic) to the less disturbed ones (lawn and peripheral). The maximal heterogeneity (by variances and percentiles) of penetration depth was found in the peripheral area. In this area, penetration depth increased with increasing park size, i.e., from 2.6 cm to 3.7 cm in the small and large parks, respectively. Averages of organic matter content and electrical conductivity decreased with soil depth in all microenvironments and increased with decreasing disturbance of microenvironments. Maximal heterogeneity for both of these properties was found in the picnic area. Increase of park size was accompanied by increasing of organic matter content in the upper depth in the peripheral area, i.e., from 2.4% in the small parks to 4.5% in the large ones. In all microenvironments the increasing of averages of all studied soil properties was accompanied by increasing heterogeneity, i.e., variances and upper percentiles. The increase in the heterogeneity of the studied soil properties is attributed to improved ecological soil status in the peripheral area, on the one hand, and to the high anthropogenic pressure in the picnic area, on the other. This means that the urban park offers\n\nMedical aspects of the Iraqi missile attacks on Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarsenty, E; Shemer, J; Alshech, I; Cojocaru, B; Moscovitz, M; Shapiro, Y; Danon, Y L\n\n1991-01-01\n\nDuring the period 18 January-28 February 1991, a total of 39 Iraqi modified Scud missiles landed in Israel, most of them in the densely populated Tel Aviv area. There were 23 missile attack alerts. These attacks caused 1,059 cases of injury; there were two deaths and 232 patients were admitted to emergency rooms for injuries directly related to the explosions, only one of which was severe. A survey among 91 of the injured showed that 46.6% of the wounds were caused by glass splinters, 31.1% were blunt contusions, and 22.2% were acute psychological reactions. No case of blast injury was reported. Inappropriate injection of atropine was reported in 230 cases. Acute anxiety was the reason for admission of 544 patients to emergency rooms. Another 40 patients sustained various traumas while rushing to the sealed room. The relatively low number of injured people is striking in view of the density of population in the areas hit. Various explanations are discussed.\n\nHepatitis E Virus Genotype 3 in Sewage and Genotype 1 in Acute Hepatitis Cases, Israel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRam, Daniela; Manor, Yossi; Gozlan, Yael; Schwartz, Eli; Ben-Ari, Ziv; Mendelson, Ella; Mor, Orna\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging infectious agent in developed countries. HEV genotypes 1 (G1) and 3 (G3) have been identified in environmental and clinical samples in Europe. In Israel, the overall prevalence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies was found to be 10.6%; however, reports of HEV infection are scarce. In this study, the presence of HEV in Israel was investigated using 169 sewage samples from 32 treatment facilities and 49 samples from acute hepatitis patients, all collected between 2013 and 2015. Fourteen sewage samples, from Haifa (11/18 samples), Tel Aviv (2/29 samples), and Beer Sheva (1/17 samples), regions with good sanitary conditions and middle-high socioeconomic populations, were HEV positive. Among the patient samples, 6.1% (3/49) were HEV positive, all returning travelers from India. Genotype analysis revealed G1 HEV in patients and G3 HEV sequences in sewage. Evidence that HEV could be establishing itself in our region may justify more active surveillance to monitor its spread.

This study is aimed to examine the extent to which agism, professional education, and geriatric training explain work burnout. The study included a convenience sample of 154 nurses working in 17 long-term care facilities in the Tel Aviv area in Israel. To examine agism, Kogan's Attitudes toward Old People Scale was used, and to probe burnout, the Maslach Burnout Inventory was used. Overall burnout was significantly explained by agism, nurses' professional education, length of working as a nurse, and type of facility ownership. When examining each dimension of burnout, agism was a significant predictor of depersonalization and personal achievement. Agism plays a role in overall burnout. Therefore, training programs that can combat agism can reduce burnout of nurses in long-term care facilities.\n\nAirborne infrared video radiometry as a low-cost tool for remote sensing of the environment, two mapping examples from Israel of urban heat islands and mineralogical site\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBen-Dor, E.; Saaroni, H.; Ochana, D.\n\n1996-10-01\n\nIn this study we examined the capability of a laboratory infrared video camera for use in remote sensing of the environment. The instrument used, INFRAMETRICS 760, was mounted onboard a Bell 206 helicopter. Under the flight conditions examined, the radiometer proved itself to be very stable and produced high-quality thermal images in a real-time mode. We studied two different environmental aspects, as follows: (1) Urban heat island of the most dense city in Israel, Tel-Aviv- and (2) lithological distribution of a well-known mineralogical site in Israel, Makhtesh Ramon. The radiometer used in both studies was able to produce a temperaturemoreÂ Â» presentation, rather than a gray scale from an altitude of 7,000 and 10,000 feet and at 70 knots air speed. The instrument produced a high-quality set of data in terms of signal-to-noise, stability, temperature accuracy and spatial resolution. In the Tel-Aviv case, the results showed that the urban heat island of the city can be depicted in a very high spatial and thermal resolutions domain and that a significant correlation exists between ground objects and the surrounding air temperature values. Based on the flight results, we could generated an isotherm map of the city that, for the first time, located the urban heat island of the city both in meso- and microscales. In the case of Makhtesh Ramon, we found that under field conditions, the radiometer, coupled with a VIS-CCD camera can provide significant ATI parameters of typical rocks that characterize tile study area. Although more study is planned and suggested based on the current data, it was concluded that the airborne thermal video radiometry, is a promising, inexpensive tool for monitoring the environment on a real-time basis. 10 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nServing the Needs of Various Groups of Stakeholders.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGeva-May, Iris; Peretz, Hannah\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe extent to which evaluation results answer different stakeholders' needs was explored in the evaluation of a business English course at Van Leer Institute for the Development of Executive Assistants in Tel-Aviv (Israel), using diagnostic tests.

The Israeli Tel Aviv stock market TA-100 Index was used as an indicator of reactivity to suicide terror bombings. After accounting for factors such as world market changes and attack severity and intensity, the analysis reveals that although Israel's financial base remained sensitive to each act of terror across the entire period of the Second Intifada (2000-06), sustained psychological resilience was indicated with no apparent overall market shift. In other words, we saw a 'normalisation of terror' following an extended period of continued suicide bombings. The results suggest that investors responded to less transitory global market forces, indicating sustained resilience and long-term market confidence. Future studies directly measuring investor expectations and reactions to man-made disasters, such as terrorism, are warranted. Â© 2011 The Author(s).

The aggregate data confirm the findings of the first edition published in 1996 [2]. Those facts endorse the highly concentrated and extensive nature of medical research in the Jerusalem area, which is conducted at the Hebrew University and its affiliated hospitals. In contrast, Tel Aviv University, whose basic research staff is about two-thirds the size of the Hebrew University staff, has a more diffuse relationship with its clinical staff who are located at more than half a dozen hospitals. Ben-Gurion University in Beer Sheva and the Technion in Haifa are smaller in size, but have closer geographic contact between their clinical and basic research staff. Nonetheless, all the medical schools and affiliated hospitals have good publication and funding records. It is important to note that while some aspects of the performance at basic research institutions seem to be somewhat better than at hospitals, the records are actually quite similar despite the greater burden of clinical services at the hospitals as compared to teaching responsibilities in the basic sciences. The survey also indicates the substantial number of young investigators in the latest survey who did not appear in the first survey. While this is certainly encouraging, it is also disturbing that the funding sources are apparently decreasing at a time when young investigators are attempting to become established and the increasing burden of health care costs precludes financial assistance from hospital sources. The intensity and undoubtedly the quality of medical research in Israel remains at a level consistent with many of the more advanced western countries. This conclusion is somewhat mitigated by the fact that there is a decrease in available funding\n\nThe significance of visitors' pressure for soil status in an urban park in Tel-Aviv\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhevelev, Helena; Sarah, Pariente; Oz, Atar\n\n2010-05-01\n\nA park is one of the most important elements of sustainable development and optimization of the urban environment. The equilibrium within the complex of natural and anthropogenic factors defines the status of a park's ecosystem. The seasonal dynamics and spatial variations of soil properties in areas under differing levels of visitors' pressure were studied in a park in Tel-Aviv. Soil was sampled twice a year, in wet (March) and dry (July) seasons, from three types of areas, subjected to differing levels of visitors' pressure: high, low and none (control). In each type of area samples were taken from two depths (0-2 cm and 5-10 cm), at 14-39 points. In total, 268 soil samples were taken. Before the soil sampling, penetration depth was determined at each point. In addition, the numbers of barbecue fires in each of the three areas were counted. Gravimetric soil moisture, organic matter, pH, electrical conductivity, and soluble ions were measured in 1:1 water extraction. Penetration depth and electrical conductivity, and organic matter, sodium, potassium and chlorite contents differed under differing levels of visitors' pressure, whereas soil moisture, pH and calcium content exhibited only minor differences. Soil moisture, electrical conductivity, and magnesium and chlorite contents exhibited strong seasonal changes, whereas the organic matter, potassium and pH levels were unaffected by seasonal dynamics. Calcium, organic matter, magnesium and chlorite contents, and electrical conductivity were significantly affected by the depth of soil sampling, whereas pH was not so affected. The seasonal changes in soil properties in the area subjected to high visitors' pressure were higher than in the one under low visitors' pressure. In most cases, visitors' pressure led to increases in variance and coefficient of variation. Different soil properties were differently affected by visitors' pressure, seasonal dynamics and soil depth. The surface of the soil was more sensitive to\n\nObservations of Sprites and Elves Associated With Winter Thunderstorms in the Eastern Mediterranean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGanot, M.; Yair, Y.; Price, C.; Ziv, B.; Sherez, Y.; Greenberg, E.; Devir, A.; Yaniv, R.; Bor, J.; Satori, G.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThe results of the 2005-6 winter sprite campaign in Israel are reported. We conducted optical ground-based observations aiming to detect transient luminous events (TLEs) above winter thunderstorms in Israel and in the area over the Mediterranean Sea between Israel, Cyprus and Lebanon. We alternated between two observation sites: the Tel-Aviv University campus in central Tel-Aviv (32.5N, 34.5E) and the Wise astronomical observatory in the Negev desert, near Mitzpe-Ramon (30N, 34.5E). We used 2 WATEC cameras, mounted on a pan-and- tilt unit with GPS time-base and event-detection software (UFO-Capture). The system was remote-controlled via the Internet and targets were chosen in real-time based on lightning locations derived from a BOLTEK lightning detection system stationed in Tel-Aviv. Detailed weather forecasts and careful analysis of lightning probability allowed us to choose between the two observation sites. The optical campaign was accompanied by ELF and VLF electromagnetic measurements from the existing TAU array in southern Israel. During five separate winter storms (December 2005 through March 2006) we detected 31 events: 27 sprites (4 halo sprites) and 4 elves. Detection ranges varied from 250 to 450km. Sprites were found to occur almost exclusively over the sea, in the height range 44-105km. Most sprites were columnar, and the number of elements varied from 1 to 9 with lengths varying from 10 to 48km. The average duration of sprites was ~43ms. All TLEs were accompanied by distinct positive ELF transients, which were clearly identified by our ELF station in Mizpe-Ramon and by the ELF station near Sopron, Hungary (range ~2500km). Calculated charge moment values were 800-1870 CÂ·km, with some events exceeding 2500 CÂ·km. We employed different lightning location systems (Israel Electrical Company LPATS and TOGA, ZEUS global networks) to determine the ground location of the parent lightning and succeeded in geo-locating 7 events.

An intentional attack (e.g. terrorism) on drinking-water systems can shock and disrupt elements of national infrastructures. We report on an unintentional drinking-water contamination event that occurred in Tel Aviv, Israel in July, 2001. Initially of unknown origin, this event involved risk management strategies used by the Ministry of Health for abating a potential public health crisis as might be envisaged of water contamination due to terrorism. In an abrupt event of unknown origin, public health officials need to be responsible for the same level of preparedness and risk communication. This is emphasized by comparison of management strategies between the Tel Aviv event and one of dire consequences that occurred in Camelford, England in 1988. From the onset of the Tel Aviv incident, the public health strategy was to employ the precautionary principle by warning residents of the affected region to not drink tap water, even if boiled. This strategy was in contrast to an earlier crisis that occurred in Camelford, England in 1988. An outcome of this event was heightened awareness that a water crisis can occur in peacetime and not only in association with terrorism. No matter how minor the contamination event or short-term the disruption of delivery of safe drinking-water, psychological, medical and public health impact could be significant.\n\n2016 Annual Scientific Meeting of EUBS\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-12-23\n\nGeneva, Switzerland), discussing, among others, the pharmacological effects of slight to moderate hyperoxygenation (such as in the use of hyperbaric air...34 HBO and neuroscience\". i.

The course is open to students from all faculties, who must fulfill all academic requirements, without a prerequisite of a background in anatomy. Approximately 120 students attend annually, a third of them are nonmedical students who major in philosophy, archeology, and sociology. This article discusses the course's contributions to students' understanding of a scientific concept that a scientific theory can be contradicted by new evidence, because facts govern science. Also, research methods of applying scientific principles establish the understanding of the human body, which evidently contributes to health and medicine. In the classes, the students are divided into mini-groups of 2-3 students, while the lecturer moves among students to examine fossils. In addition, analogies, open-discussions, and explanations accompany the tangible experiences. The lecturer of the course is an experienced anthropologist-anatomist researcher. He is a role-model and a mentor, sharing with the students his belief that a scientist should be persistent in his research to overcome difficult circumstances. Students, regardless of their backgrounds, express high appreciation of the course in their feedback questionnaires. The message conveyed by this course is that not only knowledge counts but also its integration with scientific principles. This course teaches us that science can bring students from different areas to study together and share ideas. In conclusion, this is a unique course in the eyes of the faculty and students alike.

We tested its presence in the routine urine monitoring of all patients in both Tel Aviv and Las Vegas MMT clinics. Data on demographic and addiction history, ADHD (Wender Utah Rating Scale), cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Exam), and lifetime DSM-IV-TR psychiatric diagnosis from admission were retrieved, and retention following 6 months. None of the 190 patients in Las Vegas tested positive for methylphenidate, while 14.7% (45/306) did in Tel Aviv. Abusers were less educated (p = 0.01), had higher ADHD scores (p = 0.02), lower cognitive scores (p = 0.05), and a higher benzodiazepine (BDZ) abuse rate (p < 0.0005), with no difference in age, gender, duration in MMT, cannabis, opiates, and cocaine abuse and infectious disease. Of the methylphenidate abuse 42.2% have take-home methadone dose privileges. Not like opiate use, being methylphenidate positive did not relate to 6-months retention. Compared to Tel Aviv, Las Vegas patients were more educated, with lower BDZ, and cocaine abuse. The greater abuse of methylphenidate among ADHD subjects might indicate their using it as self-medication, raising a possible indication for its prescription for that subgroup of MMT patients. The high rate of methylphenidate abuse in Israel needs future study. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Since serving as the first chairman of the Chemistry Department of the newly formed Tel-Aviv University he has been immersed in research, in the training of young scientists, and in intensive and extensive international scientific collaboration. Together with the members of his \"scientific family\" he has explored the phenomena of energy acquisition, storage and disposal and structure-dynamics-function relations in large molecules, condensed phase, clusters and biomolecules, and is looking forward to many future adventures in physical chemistry. \"What to leave out and what to put in?

They were feeling tired and frustrated and burn-out was rising. The district's nursing management took the decision, together with Tel Aviv University's nursing research unit, to conduct a quality improvement project based on issues that arose from meetings with focus groups on the nurses' difficulties. This paper is a case study of a quality improvement project targeting nurses daily working life. One of its chief contributions is as a study of meeting PHNs' frustration by integrating focus groups and round-table brainstorming (involving nurses, clinic managers and nursing inspectors) in order to identify targets for practical intervention. This strategy has been very successful. It has provided the district's nursing management a battery of forcefully argued and realistically grounded proposals for making the work of Well Baby clinics more relevant to their communities and giving nurses (a) the conditions to meet their assignments and (b) greater professional self-respect.

It included 133 dogs with ES and 133 negative controls diagnosed at the hospital, and 343 dogs diagnosed at the KVI. The average incidence of ES at the HUVTH was 22.5/year, and the percentage of spirocercosis cases was stable at both institutions (HUVTH, 0.67-1.23%; KVI, 5-8%). Dogs aged > 5 years old had 100-fold likelihood to be infected compared to dogs aged â¤ 1 year of age (P < 0.001). Mean body weight (P = 0.0004), proportion of Retrievers (P = 0.002) and sporting breed dogs (P = 0.006) were higher, while proportion of toy breeds (P = 0.004) was lower in the ES group compared to the control group. The proportion of cases from Greater Tel-Aviv decreased (P = 0.002), while that of those from Judea and Jerusalem increased (P = 0.01) compared to the 1990 s. Spirocercosis occurred in 22 dogs despite past prophylactic avermectin treatment. Vomiting and regurgitation were the most common clinical signs of ES. Coproscopy was S. lupi-positive in 33/60 dogs (55.0%). The median number of esophageal nodules was two (range 1-8), with a median diameter of 3.5 cm (range 1.0-11.0). Malignant esophageal lesion transformation was confirmed in 29 dogs (22%). Despite preventive attempts, spirocercosis has spread in Israel over time, compared to previous findings, raising questions about the efficacy of the currently accepted prophylactic protocol is incompletely effective.

In Israel, alcohol use has become an emerging problem during the last decade, and its use has increased among adolescents and young adults. Binge drinking is the common pattern of alcohol consumption among young adults who drink for recreational purposes. The present survey was conducted among 16-35Â years old visitors to the ED. The aim was specifically to identify binge drinkers in order to assess the scope of the need for a brief counseling intervention among young people who arrive intoxicated to a large tertiary care urban ED in Israel. The survey was conducted throughout a 1 week period (24Â h per day) at the general EDs in a large, tertiary care center, situated in Tel Aviv. During the survey week, 946 individuals, aged 16-35, visited the ED and 573 (63%) of them were approached for an interview. 89% of those approached agreed to be interviewed. Consenting patients [NÂ =Â 348] were asked whether they drink any alcohol, how often they drink and how much. About one fifth of those interviewed were in the habit of consuming more than four units of alcohol per occasion. Drinking several times a week or every day was reported by 19% of the males and 26% of the females. Frequency of the drinking episodes was highly correlated with the number of units of drink per occasion. The study found a very high rate of binge drinking among ED visitors, and this suggests a need for large scale ED-based interventions. As binge drinkers are at elevated risk for accidents, violence and related problems, effective ED-based interventions could make an important contribution to public health. Accordingly, Israel is in the process of assessing the effectiveness of a large-scale ED-based counseling intervention.

Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. This prospective study measured IOP and OPA at baseline and 1 and 10 minutes after administration of lidocaine anesthesia in 40 consecutive adult patients having elective cataract surgery. The IOP remained stable throughout the study with both modes of anesthesia. One minute after injection of the anesthetic agent, the OPA was significantly decreased in the injected eyes in both the sub-Tenon's (24%; P < .05) and peribulbar (25%; P < .05) groups. The decrease in the OPA in the sub-Tenon's group (14%; P < .05) was detectable after 10 minutes in the control eyes. In the peribulbar anesthesia group, the OPA in the control eyes increased significantly (9%; P < .05) 1 minute after injection of the anesthetic agent, returning to preinjection levels 10 minutes after the injection. The OPA in the eyes in which lidocaine was injected decreased significantly in both the sub-Tenon's and peribulbar groups. These findings have implications for the management of patients whose ocular circulation may be compromised.\n\nReducing health disparities: the social role of medical schools.\n\nPubMed\n\nDopelt, Keren; Davidovitch, Nadav; Yahav, Zehava; Urkin, Jacob; Bachner, Yaacov G\n\n2014-06-01\n\nMedical education based on the principles of social medicine can contribute toward reducing health disparities through the \"creation\" of doctors who are more involved in community programs. This study compared the social medicine orientation of graduates from various medical schools in Israel. The authors conducted an online cross-sectional survey in May 2011 among physicians who are graduates of Israeli medical schools. The study included 1050 physicians practicing medicine in Israel: 36% who are graduates from the Hebrew University, 26% from Tel Aviv University, 22% from the Technion and 16% from Ben-Gurion University. A greater percentage of physicians who studied either at the Technion or Ben-Gurion are working or have worked in the periphery (â¼50% vs. â¼30% at the Hebrew and Tel Aviv Universities). Among Ben-Gurion graduates, 47% are active in social medicine programs vs. 34-38% from other schools. Among physicians active in social medicine programs, 32% of Ben-Gurion alumni estimated that their medical education greatly influenced their social medicine involvement vs. 8-15% from other schools. Hebrew University alumni described their studies as more research-oriented. In contrast, Ben-Gurion graduates described their studies as more social medicine-oriented and they exhibited more positive attitudes about the role of physicians in reducing health disparities. Social medicine-oriented medical education induces a socialization process reinforcing human values regarding doctor-patient relationships and produces positive attitudes among future doctors about social involvement. Findings emphasize the need to develop educational programs with this orientation and to strengthen medical schools in the periphery.\n\nImplementing a Cost Effectiveness Analyzer for Web-Supported Academic Instruction: A Campus Wide Analysis\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCohen, Anat; Nachmias, Rafi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the implementation of a quantitative cost effectiveness analyzer for Web-supported academic instruction that was developed in Tel Aviv University during a long term study.

H.; Evgeni, K.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAn exceptionally rare Eastern Mediterranean super-cell thunderstorm occurred during the morning hours of October 25th 2015. The storm developed within the northern tip of a Red-Sea trough (extending from Sudan to the Southeastern Mediterranean Sea) off the Egyptian coastline near Alexandria and moved north-west, crossing the Israeli coast just north of Tel-Aviv at 0900 local time. Deep convective cells developed rapidly over the sea, with thunderclouds exhibiting cloud top temperatures colder than -70Â°C (18 km) and radar reflectivity cores > 65 dBz at 10 km. The storms were accompanied by intensive lightning activity, severe hail, downbursts, and intense rain. The super-cell subsided upon reaching the Jordan rift in eastern Israel. The super-cell caused 1 fatality, extensive flooding and agricultural damages. It also impacted the national electrical network with power outages lasting for 3 days in central Israel. More than 17,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strokes were registered by the lightning detection system of the Israeli Electrical Corporation, exceeding the annual average for the entire country. The average cloud-to-ground flash rates between 0940-0950 and 0950-1000 (local time) were greater than 436 and 430 strokes per minute respectively, exceeding the global record flash rates found in the Argentina-Paraguay border (Zipser et al., 2006). This was the most powerful thunderstorm ever observed in Israel since lightning detection became operational in 1997. Medium-range forecast models such as ECMWF and the GFS missed the timing and severity of this unusual storm. We will present a mesoscale and microphysical analysis of this event to better understand the origins and severity of this rare super-cell. WRF high-resolution simulations with lightning assimilation (Fierro et al., 2012; Lynn et al., 2015) coupled with the Dynamic Lightning Scheme (Lynn et al., 2012) will be used in order to evaluate the performance of the WRF for accurately nowcasting such events.\n\nThe beginning of metallurgy in the southern Levant: a late 6th millennium CalBC copper awl from Tel Tsaf, Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarfinkel, Yosef; Klimscha, Florian; Shalev, Sariel; Rosenberg, Danny\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe beginning of metallurgy in the ancient Near East attracts much attention. The southern Levant, with the rich assemblage of copper artifacts from the Nahal Mishmar cave and the unique gold rings of the Nahal Qanah cave, is regarded as a main center of early metallurgy during the second half of the 5th millennium CalBC. However, a recently discovered copper awl from a Middle Chalcolithic burial at Tel Tsaf, Jordan Valley, Israel, suggests that cast metal technology was introduced to the region as early as the late 6th millennium CalBC. This paper examines the chemical composition of this item and reviews its context. The results indicate that it was exported from a distant source, probably in the Caucasus, and that the location where it was found is indicative of the social status of the buried individual. This rare finding indicates that metallurgy was first diffused [corrected] to the southern Levant through exchange networks and only centuries later involved local productionThis copper awl, the earliest metal artifact found in the southern Levant, indicates that the elaborate Late Chalcolithic metallurgy developed from a more ancient tradition.\n\nThe Beginning of Metallurgy in the Southern Levant: A Late 6th Millennium CalBC Copper Awl from Tel Tsaf, Israel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGarfinkel, Yosef; Klimscha, Florian; Shalev, Sariel; Rosenberg, Danny\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe beginning of metallurgy in the ancient Near East attracts much attention.

One strategy for producing more registered nurses worldwide and in Israel in particular is to offer graduate entry nursing programs for individuals with non-nursing academic degrees. In order to recruit academic degree holders into the nu"
