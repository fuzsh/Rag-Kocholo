Originally this surname was written with two \"T\" and not with one. In the Yizkor Book it were put with two \"T\" as NUTTE.(Nute ia a version in Yiddish) Her father Maier NUTA told her that his father said to him, as an oral history from father to son, that this family came from the Northern Italy region of LombardÃ­a-Venetto and all the family NUTA went to two countries:\n\nPoland, and in this country principally in region of Plonsk and Warszawa. Is the only family NUTA in all the world; and to\n\nRomania. But in Romania there are Nuta's who are Jews and Christians. It is possible that the family during the Inquisition converted; and the people who actually live there didn't know anything about this convertion. The Jews who Ana Nuta found had moved to Israel or were murdered in the ShoÃ¡h.\n\nThe region from North Italy (it is an Italian name) was under the Empire Austro-Hungarian and may be it was very bad for Jewish people with wars and pogroms.\n\nWhat is the meaning of this surname: There is different opinions:\n\n1) the first said at it is an Italian name.In Italian the word Nutta means naked. And may be it can be from Spain. This is very surprising for Ana, because in her family never she heard they could be sephardic. Always the family said they are askenazim.\n\n2) The second opinion said as this is a polish word, because in polish means \"melody\" or \"musical note.\" It can be Italian, or Polish, but this surname for many researchers must came from Nathan, like nosik, nusynn, noske, notko, etc. The person who provided this information is a researcher whose name is Ana Raquel Nuta, she was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina where she lives. She was born in June 21,1939, is a lawyer in Real State Law, Family Law and Notary Law, she had two PhD's in Law, two Masters Degrees, and was Profesor in different Universities in Argentina, in the Schools of Law and in Post Graduate studies; she was married in fist time and had two children; then she divorced from her first husband and have her GET.
