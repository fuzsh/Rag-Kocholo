        "text": "I just joined this discussion and thus I'll just throw in my hat.\n\nThe way I learned it and the way we grammarians still see it today, the ending of a sentence or clause with a preposition is wrong.\n\nTraditional English tells us that there are ways around it and if we look, simply, to the French we can see how things are supposed to be done - the pages on which the book was written, the store at which I bought the hat - do these not sound much more distinguished in written language?\n\nLet us look to the reason why it is acceptable today to end sentences with prespositions - in a word, laziness. People over the ages have left their prepositions to the end of their clauses and now because this is so widespread it has been accepted by grammarians as informally correct.\n\nI do not see many situations in which grammarians would except the \"hanging\" preposition, but I advise all of you to use it cautiously and, above all, only in spoken or colloquial language. Using it in written language would definitely harm your professionalism."
