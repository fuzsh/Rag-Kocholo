        "text": "Younger learners (and older ones too) enjoy folktales, fairy tales of all kinds, and most EFL teachers know that. Textbook writers too, including versions of familiar ‘children’s stories’ from the international or English repertoire. But how many teachers here in Bulgaria use English versions of Bulgarian traditional tales in their teaching—stories that all the teachers and a portion of the younger (and older) learners probably know in original Bulgarian versions? Using indigenous traditional tales: toward a ‘Bulgarian Applied ELT’. In ‘indigenizing the EFL syllabus,’ making it closer in feeling, content and imagination to the life worlds of Bulgarian learners, Bulgarian folktales in English translation have a key role to play. In this vein, Pishghadam and Zabihi (2012) stress the need for localization of materials in ELT, moving toward a distinctively ‘Iranian TEFL’ in their own country, including much more Iranian culture in the content of the teaching syllabus. In this they cite Kumaravadivelu’s (2006: 171) pedagogic parameter of ‘particularity,’ where postmethod EFL pedagogy “must be sensitive to a particular group of teachers teaching a particular group of learners pursuing a particular set of goals within a particular institutional context embedded in a particular sociocultural mileu.” I would argue that indigenizing materials in Bulgaria, integral to a ‘Bulgarian TEFL,’ needs to take this parameter into clear account, within a framework of an ‘Bulgarian Applied ELT’ sensitive to local realities.\n\nThis is a report on action research that developed story cards and supporting games for ELT based on Jungian archetypes and the journey, and empirical research that demonstrates significant improvement (5.4%) in narrative writing against a control group taught through only textbook and PowerPoint. This improvement may be due to how ELTMAC games can benefit English language learning: This research seems to corroborate Jungian researchers who have found improved language memory in tests with metaphorical associative cards derived from the Archetypal Symbol Inventory. The cards are easily scalable to learner level; with vocabulary profiling against a corpus linguistics BNC-COCA database, the 59 cards can be named with the most common (<2000) English words. Recent fMRI studies support Jung’s claim that archetypes are neurological structures and are universal worldwide; ELTMAC therefore transcends intercultural boundaries and accesses the brain on the level of language formation. The cards are based on fairytale, i.e., European folklore; both English and fairytales originate in the Bronze Age Indo-European dispersal, so the game affects a Whorfian synergy that imparts cultural competence. Story helps us understand ourselves; hence ELTMAC games aid development of L2 identity. Fairytale confronts the realities of life, so the games allow for authenticity and meaningfulness to reemerge in ELT classrooms where commercial or social-political forces have censored it. And, narrative story card games are highly adaptable, with broad use for teaching of skills and language forms. What analytical psychology might contribute to TESOL has to date been little investigated; this research seems to show Jungian approaches have some usefulness for the field and suggests avenues for future development.\n\nThis paper aims to bridge folk narrative studies and literature on foreign language learning, by providing an overview of the applications of folk narratives-from fairy tales to contemporary legends-to EFL teaching and learning. It focuses on how the very nature of oral narratives, of which the English language has a particularly varied and rich tradition, can act on the acquisition of English as a foreign language from a linguistic and a cultural point of view.\n\nThe teaching of narratives is not new but it has taken a number of different shapes. In order to appreciate the myriad of approaches one must also decide on the productive focus (written, or spoken) since the language choices and complexity varies in each. Whether it is a story to be told or a story to be read, however, creating a good structure seems to be a universally agreed upon requirement. Furthermore, most agree that story creation works well as a collaboration whether at the planning stage or later at the editing stage. This chapter is an exhaustive compilation of the various approaches available for the teaching of how to write and perform narratives.\n\nThis is a report on action research that develops story cards for ELT based on Jungian archetypes, and empirical research demonstrating improvement in narrative writing versus textbook and PowerPoint taught groups. Improvement may be due to how ELTMAC games can benefit English language learning: Jungian researchers finding improved language memory in tests with archetypal metaphorical associative cards is corroborated. The cards are scalable to learner level; the 59 cards can be named with the most frequent English words. Recent MRI studies support Jung’s claim that archetypes are universal neural structures; ELTMAC therefore transcends intercultural boundaries and accesses language parts of the brain. The cards are based on fairytale, i.e. European folklore; as both English and fairytales originating in the Bronze Age Indo-European dispersal, the game imparts cultural competence via Whorfian synergy. Story helps us understand ourselves; hence ELTMAC develops L2 identity. Fairytale confronts the realities of life, allowing meaningfulness to reemerge in ELT classrooms where commercial or social-political forces are censoring it. And, narrative card games are adaptable to broad uses.\n\nThis qualitative case study explores the intersection of multimedia, bilingualism, and culturally responsive practices by examining the responses that children of Korean descent have to animated folktales and the discussions about traditional cultural values that they sparked. Data were collected over 5 months in a classroom for children of kindergarten age in a Korean Language School in the midwestern United States. The focal literacy activity was online storybook reading sessions in which the children watched animated folktales taken from online storybook-reading software programs or YouTube clips. Data were collected from the children, their parents, and the teacher through interviews and observations of classroom literacy activities. The study found that listening to animated folktales and having dual language discussions about them created a supportive literacy environment in which the children were able to be more engaged in the stories they were reading and also gained a deeper understanding of the moral lessons of those stories. Findings suggest the possibilities of incorporating animated folktales as culturally responsive pedagogies to create more technology-enhanced literacy environments in early bilingual classrooms."
