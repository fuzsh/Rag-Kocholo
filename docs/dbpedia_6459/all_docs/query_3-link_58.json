        "text": "iTranslate's mission is to give its users the perfect tool to read, write, and speak in all languages, anywhere in the world.\n\nWith \"Grammatica,\" iTranslate's AI-Powered writing assistant released in August, the company went beyond just breaking down language barriers by helping users create effective and clear communication. Especially now, when open and efficient communication in written form is more crucial than ever, iTranslate has been at everyone's side helping to communicate and to become more confident in writing and texting.\n\nTransitioning from a Language Translation App Developer to an AI-Powerhouse\n\n\"Artificial Intelligence\" (AI) is often used as a generic term that encompasses a multitude of technologies; including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision (AR, VR, and 3D analysis), and natural language processing (NLP). These technologies, individually or in combination, make applications \"intelligent.\" The trend towards it is unbroken worldwide since it is used in more and more application fields, making artificial intelligence an essential factor for sustainable business success.\n\nBut behind every great technology is always a team of exceptionally talented people. Since specializing in AI technology, iTranslate's skilled machine translation team has grown even more prominent over the years and now represents a state-of-the-art quality regarding language translation and processing. This ultimately allowed the company to live out their belief of enabling people (and therefore, other companies) worldwide to break language barriers by offering iTranslate's own translation APIs. Instead of laboriously developing their own localization solutions, companies can now buy a translation API \"off the shelf\" for their products, which sequentially enables successful implementation even with a lack of necessary specialists and avoids costly in-house developments that are not economically viable.\n\nGrammatica is the ultimate showcase for iTranslate's AI-Power\n\nUnderstanding and processing natural language are among the most challenging AI areas. Machine Learning, as a part of AI, plays a vital role in this process. The revolutionary writing assistant Grammatica comes with a dedicated spell check and grammatical assistance. It also offers predictive typing, autocorrection, synonyms, style suggestions, a personal dictionary - and, most importantly, a Keyboard Extension, which can be used in conjunction with other apps. Grammatica is a brilliant culmination of using today's AI technology for language processing.\n\nTaking care of such a complex AI system used for apps like Grammatica isn't easy. With a combination of Machine Learning, diverse natural language processing approaches, and high-quality training data, the AI system can analyze and enhance the written text from character level to words, paragraphs, and full texts.\n\nGrammatica also becomes the next Multi-Platform Product\n\nBesides ongoing improvements and working towards new languages for Grammatica, diversifying the app's availability to other platforms is a crucial step for the company. Since Grammatica's release in August this year for iOS devices, the team behind the app works tirelessly to expand Grammatica to other platforms.\n\nThe most recent milestone in the transition to a multi-platform product is the launch of Grammatica's Chrome extension. Like any other Chrome extension, Grammatica can be installed via the Chrome web store. Combined with a required Grammatica account, users can benefit from the same features they already know and love from the iOS app. The Android app version of Grammatica, with first releases planned for January, will be the perfect final and crowning touch for the company."
