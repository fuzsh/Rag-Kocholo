        "text": "The rules and guidelines for punctuation and grammar on data.govt.nz - these aim to increase the accessibility, readability, and usability of information.\n\nOn this page\n\nExclamation marks\n\nColon and semi-colons\n\nApostrophes\n\nBold\n\nBrackets\n\nCapitals\n\nCommas\n\nContractions\n\nDashes\n\nHeadings\n\nHyphens\n\nPlurals\n\nQuotations marks\n\nTitles of documents or publications\n\nExclamation marks\n\nWe don’t use exclamation marks.\n\nColon and semi-colons\n\nWe don't use semi-colons or comma splices – we’ll write 2 sentences instead, or separate the clauses using a dash (with a space on either side).\n\nApostrophes\n\nWe generally don’t add an extra 's' after nouns or names ending in 's'. Exceptions are okay where the alternative reads more naturally.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"The business’ work\" – not \"the business’s work.\"\n\n\"Department of Internal Affairs’ address\" – not \"Department of Internal Affairs’s address.\"\n\nWe don’t use an apostrophe for dates, numbers, or plurals of abbreviations.\n\nFor example:\n\n1960s.\n\nBoeing 767s.\n\nTVs.\n\nBold\n\nWe rarely use bold – using too much will make it difficult for users to know which parts of your content they need to pay the most attention to. To emphasise words or phrases, we:\n\nput key information at the start of sentences\n\nuse headings\n\nuse bullets.\n\nBrackets\n\nWe limit the use of brackets and avoid using them in the middle of a sentence. Whenever we provide a link to a downloadable document or report, we use include details about the format and size in square brackets.\n\nFor example:\n\nAlgorithm assessment report – full report [PDF 10.1 MB]\n\nCapitals\n\nWe only use capitals for proper nouns, such as:\n\nnames of people, places and things, including buildings and brands\n\nspecified committee, faculty, department, institute or school: Public Administration Select Committee\n\nnames of groups, directorates and organisations: Affordable Housing Action Group\n\ntitles of specific acts or bills: Human Rights Act (but \"the act\" or \"the bill\" at second mention)\n\nnames of specific schemes known to people: Right to Buy\n\nnames of wars: World War 1 and World War 2\n\njob titles following the person's name\n\ntitles like Mr, Ms, Dr, the Duchess of Cambridge (the duchess at second mention)\n\ntitles of books: Content Design\n\nheader cells in tables: Yearly budget.\n\nWe use a capital letter for the Crown, and for Government and Parliament when referring to a specific government or sitting of the parliament in New Zealand. We use lower case for general references to government.\n\nGenerally, terms are not proper nouns, so should not be capitalised. Technical terms are not proper nouns. But if a word or term is branded as a distinct thing, treat it as a proper noun.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"The Government introduced a new policy in 2020\" – not \"The government introduced a new policy in 2020.\"\n\n\"Fiscal responsibility is important for good government\" – not \"Fiscal responsibility is important for good Government.\"\n\n\"As a marathon runner, you'll get a medal and a massage\" – not \"As a Marathon Runner, you'll get a medal and a massage.\"\n\n\"I'm running in the ASB Auckland Marathon and Half Marathon\" – not \"I'm running in the ASB Auckland marathon and half marathon.\"\n\n\"We're running an open data project\" – not \"We're running an Open Data Project.\"\n\n\"The Eden Project\" – not \"The Eden project.\"\n\nCommas\n\nWe use the Oxford or serial comma only if it makes a list in a sentence clearer or easier to understand.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"This includes things like the family home, cars, furniture, and money like superannuation and wages.\"\n\nContractions\n\nContractions make text feel more conversational and friendly. They also make complex sentences easier to read – for native English speakers.\n\nHowever, the punctuation can make sentences harder to read for some users. We rewrite sentences to avoid using contractions if it fits with the overall tone.\n\nWhen we use them, we only use simple contractions:\n\nyou're\n\nit's\n\ncan't\n\ndon't\n\nisn't\n\nthere's\n\nyou'll\n\nthat's.\n\nWe don't use complex or potentially confusing contractions like:\n\nshould've, would've, they've\n\nmustn't, aren't, couldn't, haven't\n\nit'd, it'll.\n\nWe don't use any contractions on pages that are aimed at people who might not speak English well.\n\nDashes\n\nWe use a dash with a space on either side to separate thoughts in a sentence.\n\nFor example:\n\nScans of documents – for example meetings minutes – aren’t machine readable.\n\nWe use a dash without spaces to:\n\nshow numerical ranges\n\nseparate proper nouns of equal value.\n\nFor example:\n\n10–12 items.\n\nNew Zealand–Australia group.\n\nWe don’t use a dash when we’re using the words 'between' and 'from'.\n\nFor example:\n\nAged from 10 to 15 years.\n\nBetween 8pm and 6am.\n\nHeadings\n\nWe use sentence case so only the first letter is upper case.\n\nHeadings in any content adhere to the proper structural order: H1 > H2 > H3 > H4 > H5.\n\nFor example, we don’t follow an H1 with an H3 or an H2 with an H4.\n\nWe never link headings.\n\nHyphens\n\nWe sometimes hyphenate words to make sure their meaning is clear.\n\nFor example:\n\n'8 year old children' could mean children who are all aged 8, or 8 children who are 1 year old.\n\n'8-year-old children' means children who are all aged 8.\n\nPlurals\n\nWe don’t use brackets or '/s' to refer to something that could be either singular or plural. We use the plural instead, as this covers both possibilities.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"Send your completed documents to Stats NZ\" – not \"Send your completed document(s) to Stats NZ.\"\n\nQuotation marks\n\nWe use double quotation marks for:\n\nexact quotations\n\ndirect speech.\n\nWe use single quotation marks for:\n\ntechnical terms (the first time it is used)\n\nclassification descriptors\n\ntitle of documents or publications (see below).\n\nTitles of documents or publications\n\nWe prefer to use sentence case for the titles of documents or publications. We use single quotations to separate document titles from their surrounding text, unless the title is a link.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"The 'Community resource kit' will help you hold a discussion with your whānau, workmates or members of a community you’re part of.\"\n\nMore information\n\nWriting content for everyone\n\nGOV.UK Verify and the government Design Standards\n\nContractions\n\nContact us\n\nIf you’d like more information, have a question, or want to provide feedback, email datalead@stats.govt.nz.\n\nContent last reviewed 26 January 2022."
