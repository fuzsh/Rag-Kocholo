        "text": "It was a historic and record-setting day – at the track, in the pool and on the streets of Paris – for Team USA Sunday at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe American gold rush ended with one of the U.S. biggest stars, Noah Lyles, cementing himself as the world’s fastest man by running to gold in the 100 meters in a photo finish.\n\nThe U.S. swim team capped off the last day of competition in the pool with two more gold medals and two world records. Bobby Finke won the 1,500 freestyle for the second consecutive Olympics, and Team USA ended a thrilling week of swimming with gold in the women’s 4x100 medley relay.\n\nBut the day began with U.S. cycling history when Kristen Faulkner stunned the field – and everybody watching – to win the women’s road race, becoming just the second American woman and the first in 40 years to race to gold in the Olympic cycling event.\n\nCatch up on everything that went down Sunday with USA TODAY Sports' highlights and more from throughout the day.\n\nInteractive Graphic: Want to train like an Olympic champion? Start with this expert advice\n\nAmericans Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng defeated Italy 2-1 in the final women's beach volleyball match of the day. The team of Hughes/Cheng won the first set of the Round of 16 match 21-18, before the Italian duo of Valentina Gottardi and Marta Menegatti rallied to win the second set 21-17. Hughes and Cheng prevailed in the decisive third set 15-12.\n\nHughes and Cheng now move onto the quarterfinals for a Tuesday afternoon match against Switzerland. The other American women's team of Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth face Canada in their Round of 16 match on Monday.\n\nJuliette Whittaker will be the only American woman in the 800-meter final after squeaking through the semifinals Sunday night. Whittaker, a sophomore at Stanford, won the NCAA championship at the beginning of the summer.\n\nWhittaker, 20, nabbed the third and final 800-meter spot on Team USA at the Olympic trials but is now the only one of them left. Allie Wilson did not make it out of the first round, and Nia Akins fell short in the semifinals.\n\nAfter making the final and running a personal best of 1 minute, 57.76 seconds, Whittaker said she feels like she's playing with house money now.\n\n\"I think I'm just so excited now just to see what I can do tomorrow, without any expectation,\" she said. \"Even if I get last in the final, I will be overjoyed just to make it that far. So yeah, I'm just excited.\" — Tom Schad\n\nThere will be plenty of red, white and blue in the men's 1500-meter final.\n\nAll three Americans left in the field qualified for the final, with Yared Nuguse and Hobbs Kessler finishing first and second in one of the two semifinals to advance. Both ran under 3 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\nCole Hocker also cruised into the final after placing third in his semi and spending most of the race shadowing two of the medal favorites: Jacob Ingebrigsten of Norway and Josh Kerr of Great Britain.\n\n\"That was just the very last bit of confidence that I needed, heading into the final,\" said Hocker, who ran collegiately at Oregon. — Tom Schad\n\nIf you thought Noah Lyles missed out on the gold medal in the 100-meter dash, you weren't the only one. Just be thankful you don't have a microphone in front of your mouth.\n\nNBC broadcaster Leigh Diffey was into the moment like the rest of the audience taking in the 100m, but he seemed a bit more decisive with his call than what the eye told. As the sprinters crossed the line, the cameras panned to Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson and Diffey declared Thompson the winner, not Lyles.\n\n\"Jamaica's gonna do it, Kishane Thompson is a gold medalist, on debut,\" Diffey declared, before going silent.\n\nThe competitors were all huddled waiting for photo evidence of the finish. When the photo did come in, it was Lyles who was the winner of the race, by just thousandths of a second over Thompson.\n\nLyles' victory secures the U.S.'s first gold medal in the 100 meter in 20 years, and solidifies his standing as the fastest man in the world.\n\nNo harm, no foul. But someone get @OldTakesExposed on the line.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Noah Lyles is the fastest man in the world.\n\nThe U.S. sprinter won the 100 at the Paris Olympics. Lyles crossed the finish line with a gold-medal winning time of 9.79 in a photo finish to win track and field’s marquee sprint event.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson ran a 9.79 to finish second and American Fred Kerley came in third, posting a time of 9.81 to get bronze.\n\nThe runners had to wait for photo review moments after the race and didn’t know who won seconds after the race.\n\nBut the moment belonged to Lyles inside a packed house at Stade de France. Lyles is the first American sprinter to win an Olympic gold medal in the men’s 100 since Justin Gatlin won gold at the 2004 Athens Games. — Tyler Dragon\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France - Team USA women's high jumper Vashti Cunningham missed out on a medal for the third consecutive Olympics Sunday. Still, despite a troubling back injury this season, she recorded her highest Olympic finish ever (fifth place). The daughter of former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham cleared the bar at 1.86, 1.91 and 1.95 meters, but failed on three attempts to clear 1.98 to fall out of medal contention. The gold medal went to Ukranian Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who cleared 2.0 meters in fewer attempts than silver medalist Nicola Olyslagers of Australia. Ukranian Iryna Gerashchenko and Australia's Eleanor Patterson tied for the bronze.\n\nCunningham narrowly qualified to reach the Games, but entered the Olympics ranked No.7 in the world. She recorded finishes of 13th at the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, and sixth at the Tokyo Games in 2021.\n\n“I felt good about my performance. I was happy when I made the bar and when I missed the bar, I knew what I was doing wrong,” Cunningham said. “I just need to go back to the drawing board and work on a few things.”Asked if she’s committed to a run at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, Cunningham said “Absolutely. I’m only going to be 30 years old, guys.” — Charles Goodbread\n\nThe Belgian triathlon team pulled out of Monday's planned mixed relay event in the Seine river because one of its athletes, Claire Michel, got sick, according to the country's national Olympic committee.\n\nThe Belgian team shared the news in a statement on the same day that Olympic organizers canceled a training session for the swimming leg of the race because the Seine failed to meet water-quality tests. It also comes as a report surfaced in Belgian media claiming Michel is hospitalized with an E. coli infection.\n\nMichel competed in Wednesday's women's triathlon.\n\nUSA TODAY could not confirm the report about Michel's alleged hospitalization or the E. coli infection. It appeared in Belgian newspaper De Standaard. The Belgian Olympic Committee would not comment directly on the claims. World Triathlon, the sport's international body, said it was not aware of the report. Nor was the International Olympic Committee, according to spokesman Mark Adams, which said it was looking into the report. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team crushed German 87-68 to close out group play with an undefeated mark.\n\nThe clash determined the winner of Group C, with both teams entering the game unbeaten. Both Team USA and Germany had already clinched berths in the quarterfinals, but the U.S. will now receive a theoretically easier assignment ahead of knockout play as the group winner.\n\nLas Vegas Aces star Jackie Young, who won gold in Tokyo as a member of the U.S. 3x3 basketball team, led all scorers with 19 points.\n\nTeam USA started its quest for an eighth straight gold medal with a 27-point win over Japan on July 29, and followed it up by beating Belgium by 13 on Thursday. They finished off group-stage competition with a 19-point win over Germany.\n\nThe Team USA men's foil squad had a big lead in the early legs of the team foil bronze medal match. The operating word is \"had.\"\n\nFrom the start of the fourth leg on, France controlled the match, resulting in a bronze medal victory.\n\nMidway through the match, Miles Chalmey-Watson had a small injury scare, but would stay in to finish. France would hit the 45-touch threshold for the medal win in the ninth leg.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Noah Lyles is going to have to make some adjustments ahead of the 100 final.\n\nLyles placed second his first semifinal heat, running a 9.83. Jamaica’s Oblique Seville won the heat and looked at Lyles as he crossed the finish line in a personal-best time of 9.81.\n\nLyles lost to Great Britain’s Louie Hinchliffe in the opening round. But all that matters is he qualified for Sunday’s final.\n\nThe top two from each heat plus the next two fastest times advance to the final. – Tyler Dragon\n\nIt was an Olympics to forget for Team USA 3x3 hoops.\n\nTheir quest for an Olympic medal ended on Sunday with a 21-6 loss to the Netherlands. Without Jimmer Fredette on the floor, the team of Canyon Barry, Kareem Maddox and Dylan Travis combined for just six points.\n\nFredette suffered an injury in their matchup vs. Poland. The U.S. finished the competition with a 2-5 record.\n\nNANTERRE, France — Team USA ended swimming at the Paris Olympics on Sunday with a standout relay, winning gold and breaking the world record in the women's 4x100-meter medley relay at Paris La Défense Arena.\n\nIn the final event in the pool of these Games, the team of Regan Smith (backstroke), Lilly King (breaststroke), Gretchen Walsh (butterfly) and Torri Huske (freestyle) swam a spectacular race obliterating the field by nearly four seconds. Their time of 3:49.63 broke the Olympic record set by Australia at the Tokyo Games (3:51.60) and the Americans' own world record of 3:50.40, set in 2019. – Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nNANTERRE, France — American distance swimmer Bobby Finke successfully defended his Olympic title in Sunday’s men’s 1,500-meter freestyle, winning his second consecutive gold in the event and setting a new world at the Paris Olympics.\n\nFinke won gold with a time of 14:30.67, besting the world record set by China's Sun Yang in 2012 (14.31.02) by nearly a half a second. Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri took silver with a time of 14.34.55, and Ireland's Daniel Wiffin, who won the 800 meters in Paris, got bronze in 14.39.63. – Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nNANTERRE, France — Swedish superstar Sarah Sjöström swept the women’s sprint freestyle events at the Paris Olympics, winning gold in the 50-meter freestyle final Sunday at Paris La Défense Arena.\n\nSjöström powered through the fastest event in the pool with an Olympic record time of 23.66 to win gold, after previously winning Olympic gold in the women’s 100-meter freestyle at Paris La Défense Arena. The 30-year-old five-time Olympian is the world record holder in both. – Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nKristen Faulkner used a late charge to pull away from the field and win a shocking gold in the women's cycling road race Sunday.\n\nFaulkner, 31, is the first U.S. woman to win gold in the race since Connie Carpenter in 1984.\n\nFaulkner was competing in her first Olympics, in a sport she began doing competitively only seven years ago, and she carved her name into American cycling history by winning a gold medal in breakaway fashion.\n\nShe covered the 158-km course in 3:59.23, pulling away from a four-racer pack in the final three kilometers.\n\nMarianna Vos of the Netherlands took silver and Lotte Kopecky of Belgium took bronze in a photo finish, 58 seconds behind Faulkner. – Dave Birkett\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France — The legend of Scottie Scheffler keeps growing, and the latest addition is golden.\n\nWorld No. 1 Scheffler caught fire on the back nine at Le Golf National, coming from off the pace to swipe the gold medal for Team USA from a group of elite contenders in the final holes of a enthralling Paris Olympics competition.\n\nOpening the final round four shots back of the leaders, Scheffler tied a course record by firing a 9-under-par 62 on Sunday. He birdied his first three holes of the afternoon and then six of nine after the turn, including a pivotal run of four in a row to seize a place atop the leaderboard that he wouldn't lose.\n\nScheffler's tournament total of 19 under beat silver-medalist Tommy Fleetwood of Great Britain by one shot. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (17 under) won the bronze medal. – Gentry Estes\n\nPARIS — Novak Djokovic finally has an Olympic gold medal around his neck.\n\nAfter chasing this last prize his entire career – the only major accomplishment in tennis he hadn’t been able to check off – the 37-year old Djokovic was down to his last chance here in Paris.\n\nSummoning every bit of energy he had left in the tank Sunday, against the 21-year old who has taken his place on top of the sport, Djokovic managed to play one of the best matches of his career to beat Carlos Alcaraz 7-6, 7-6 inside Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nWhen it was over after 2 hours, 37 minutes and one monster down-the-line forehand on match point, Djokovic dropped his racket and put his hands over his mouth. Then, after an embrace with Alcaraz, he dropped to his knees in exhaustion and emotion and stayed down for nearly a minute. Then he went into the stands, embracing his team and family.\n\nEven for a man with 24 Grand Slam titles and nearly every significant record in the sport, this is the crowning achievement that he has long sought. Because this one wasn’t just for himself, it was for his beloved Serbia.\n\nAfter gutting defeats in Rio and Tokyo, Djokovic wanted this badly. Even built his year around it. But after injuring his knee during the French Open and having meniscus surgery, it was unclear whether he would even be healthy enough to play the Olympics.\n\nBut Djokovic managed to return in time for Wimbledon, getting to the finals before Alcaraz crushed him in three sets.\n\nThis one was tightly played throughout, with no breaks of serve on either side. In the end, Djokovic was better in both tiebreakers. – Dan Wolken\n\nThanks to three straight birdies, American golfer Scottie Scheffler is 8-under on the day and now has a share of the lead in the Olympic golf tournament. Both he and Tommy Fleetwood sit at 18-under for the tournament.\n\nSpain's Jon Rahm has dropped a number of strokes on the day, falling off the podium for the time being.\n\nAusten Smith took bronze in women’s skeet shooting Sunday, when she qualified for the six-person final and hit 45 out of 50 targets.\n\nIn her second Olympics experience, Smith, 23, survived stage 1 and the elimination stage of finals to stand on the podium.\n\nThe gold medal came down to a shoot-off between Francisca Crovetto Chadid of Chile and Great Britain’s Amber Rutter. That sudden-death format went five rounds with both shooters matching each other until Crovetto Chadid finally bested Rutter.\n\nChile had never won an Olympic shooting gold medal. – Chris Bumbaca\n\nUSA's Suni Lee went last in the uneven bars final, scoring a 14.800 and winning bronze.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nNovak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz went back and forth during the first set of their men's singles gold medal match, but Djokovic earned the 7-6 win.\n\nWhat else would you expect from the finalists from last month's Wimbledon?\n\nDjokovic won the first-set tiebreaker, which happened after 13 unsuccessful break points. The second set is underway.\n\nThe Team USA women's volleyball team held off France in three sets, 29-27, 29-27, 25-20, during a preliminary round match.\n\nAndrea Drews led the way for the Americans with 15 points, while Chiaka Ogbogu added 13 and Haleigh Washington and Kathryn Plummer each had 11. Ogbogu and Plummer also combined for six blocks.\n\nThe U.S. improved its record to 2-1 at these Olympics and officially qualified for the quarterfinals.\n\nGymnastics at the 2024 Paris Olympics continues with two more individual event finals: uneven bars and men's vault. Suni Lee, who won bronze on bars in Tokyo and has so far won team gold and all-around bronze at these Games, is the only American competing today.\n\nThe still rings final was the first event of the day, China's Liu Yang and Zou Jingyuan winning gold and silver, respectively, with Greece's Eleftherios Petrouinas rounding out the podium.\n\nSimone Biles, who won gold in the vault final Saturday, returns to the competition floor on Monday with the balance beam and floor exercise finals.\n\nFollow along for live results, scores and highlights throughout today's individual finals. — Nancy Armour\n\nIn the gold medal match of men's individual archery, American Brady Ellison fell to South Korea's Kim Woo-Jin in a shootoff – losing by a mere five millimeters.\n\nEllison will have to settle for silver, the third of his Olympics career to go with two bronze, one of which came earlier in these Olympics in mixed doubles with American Casey Kaufhold.\n\nWoo-Jin made it three gold medals in these Paris Games by narrowly winning a one-arrow shootoff to edge Ellison 6-5 on Sunday in one of the most dramatic gold-medal finishes in these Games.\n\nEach of the two archers shot a perfect score of 30 in the match's final set to force the one-arrow shootoff. Ellison went second, and his arrow was only slightly outside of his opponent's arrow, which had landed on the line to score a 10.\n\nEllison, a 35-year-old from Arizona who's a world-record holder and considered one of the sport's all-time best, won three consecutive matches Sunday to reach the gold medal final. — Gentry Estes\n\nSpain's Jon Rahm is threatening to rush for gold in Paris, opening up a four-stroke lead at 20-under par.\n\nRahm has shot 6 under for the day and his closest competitors at the moment are Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood at 16 under. Team USA's Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele, the gold medal winner in Tokyo, are tied for fourth at 15 under.\n\nTeam USA women's basketball's group-stage clash against Germany will determine who wins Group C, with both teams so far unbeaten in Paris. Both have assured themselves a place in the quarterfinals, but the group winner will theoretically receive an easier assignment once the final eight teams are paired for knockout play.\n\nTeam USA started its quest for an eighth consecutive gold medal with a 27-point win over Japan on July 29, and followed it up by beating Belgium by 13 on Thursday. Germany has had similar results, besting Belgium by 14 to open the tournament and then claiming an 11-point win over Japan in its second Group C game.\n\nFollow along for updates and highlights. — Jack McKessy\n\nThe first set is all tied up at 3-3 in the men's singles gold medal match between Serbia's Novak Djokovic and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic earned the first point and jumped out to a 2-1 lead before Alcaraz battled back to even the score.\n\nBrady Ellison of the United States has moved on to the gold medal match in men's individual archery.\n\nEllison defeated Germany’s Florian Unruh 7-3 in the semifinals to unofficially clinch his fifth career Olympics medal, but he's still searching for his first gold.\n\nEllison will take on No. 1 seed Kim Woojin of South Korea at around 8:45 a.m. ET.\n\nAusten Smith advanced to the women’s skeet final by finishing first in qualifying with 122 points. Smith turned in three perfect rounds and missed three clay disks out of 125 total – two in the second round and one in the fifth. She and five others advanced to the final, meaning she’ll have to do better than three competitors to make the podium.\n\nFellow American Dania Vizzi, the silver-medalist at last year’s world championships, did not qualify for the finals.\n\nSpain's Jon Rahm moved to 3 under for the day and has taken a one-shot lead over the Paris Olympics field in search of a gold medal.\n\nAt 17 under par, Rahm leads USA's Xander Schauffele by one stroke, while Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood lurk at two shots back. Matsuyama has been especially good so far Sunday, shooting 4 under through six holes.\n\nIn a rematch of the men's final at Wimbledon, staged less than a month ago, Serbia's Novak Djokovic will get a chance at revenge against Spain's Carlos Alcarez.\n\nDjokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion, is taking aim at winning the \"Golden Slam,\" which encompasses all four Grand Slam titles and an Olympic gold medal. Steffi Graff, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams are in the exclusive club.\n\nTeam USA's Freddie Crittenden jogged through a preliminary men's 110-meter hurdles round Sunday to finish with a time of 18.27 at the Paris Olympics, nearly five full seconds behind heat winner Louis Francois Mendy of Senegal.\n\nWhy? Strategy. And misfortune.\n\nCrittenden came up with a minor physical issue Saturday – so minor, in fact, he wouldn't even describe it as an injury – but it was enough to give him concern that it might cause an injury. So in order to save his body and give himself the best chance of recovery, he willfully finished last with a plan of taking the next two days to rest, then hopefully rebound to medal contention in Tuesday's repechage round. — Chase Goodbread\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Sunday was just another day at the park for 400-meter hurdles world-record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran a 53.60 like it was an afternoon stroll. She won her fifth and final heat by nearly three seconds. Morocco’s Noura Ennadi placed second at 55.26.\n\n\"It’s good to shake the rust off. I haven’t raced since U.S. trials,\" McLaughlin-Levrone said. \"I feel good. The track is pretty fast … It feels good to get back out there and compete.\"\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is defending her Olympic title in Paris. Her main competitor is expected to be Netherlands’ Femke Bol who won her third heat, running a 53.38.\n\nThe world-record holder and defending Olympic champ was voted a U.S. track and field co-captain before the start of the track and field competition.\n\n\"Honor to have that role. I know Allyson (Felix) had that last time,\" McLaughlin-Levrone said. \"It’s just great that my peers respect me as a competitor. I’m just hoping to represent Team USA the best I can.\"\n\nThe semifinals in the women’s 400 hurdles are on Tuesday. — Tyler Dragon\n\nSundays always bring out the best golf in the world's best golfers. That's no different at the Olympics.\n\nAmerican star and Masters winner Scottie Scheffler is at 3-under par after five holes to get to 13 under for the tournament and within three shots of the lead -- which is held by Spain's Jon Rahm and Team USA teammate and defending Olympics gold medalist Xander Schauffele.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Grant Holloway looks destined for a gold medal in Paris.\n\nHolloway ran smooth over 10 hurdles in the opening round and crossed the finish line at 13.01 to win the fifth heat in the 110-meter hurdles. He won by at least three meters. The next fastest in the race was 13.42 by Jamaica’s Rasheed Broadbell.\n\n\"I love the consistency that I’m having and how everybody recognizes how consistent I am,\" Holloway said prior to the race.\n\nThe semifinals in the men’s 110-meter hurdles are on Wednesday. Holloway has the fastest qualifying time entering the semis.\n\nHolloway was voted a USA track and field team co-captain before the start of the Olympic track and field action. − Tyler Dragon\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Gabby Thomas, McKenzie Long and Brittany Brown all won their opening round heats in the women’s 200.\n\nThomas won with relative ease, running a 22.20. Long ran out of lane No. 9 but it didn’t phase her as she crossed the line first at 22.55. In heat five, Brown clocked a 22.38 to win her opening-round race. − Tyler Dragon\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Gabby Thomas had a relatively easy time halfway around the track in the women’s 200.\n\nThomas easily won her first-round heat in the women’s 200, running a time of 22.20. Thomas was in heat two and ran out of lane No. 5.\n\nJamaica's Niesha Burgher ran a 22.54 to finish second and Switzerland's Mujinga Kambundji took third, running a 22.75.\n\nThomas is part of USA TODAY Sports’ 10 athletes to watch series.\n\nThe 27-year-old sprinter owns the fastest 200 time in the world this year at 21.78. She won the 200 at the USA Olympic track and field trials in June.\n\n\"Team USA is really deep. Getting to represent Team USA at the Olympics is incredibly special,\" Thomas said. \"I’m so glad that I have the opportunity to represent Team USA.\"\n\nThe top three in each round advance to the semifinals. All others have a chance to advance in the repechage round. − Tyler Dragon\n\nThe Jamaican women sprinters are having a forgettable Olympics.\n\nShericka Jackson, the two-time world champion in the 200, withdrew from her signature event Sunday. Jackson was the favorite in the women's 200, but suffered an apparent injury last month. She scratched from the women's 100 before the start of Olympic track and field competition.\n\nJamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce scratched from the 100 semifinals on Saturday.\n\nElaine Thompson-Herah suffered a season-ending Achilles' injury earlier this season. − Tyler Dragon\n\nTeam USA's Valerie Constien and Courtney Wayment qualified for the final of the women’s 3000m steeplechase Sunday morning at the Stade de France.\n\nWayment finished fourth in heat one with a time of 9:10.72.
