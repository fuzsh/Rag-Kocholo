        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nThe Ghost tells Hamlet a tale of horror. Saying that he is the spirit of Hamlet’s father, he demands that Hamlet avenge King Hamlet’s murder at the hands of Claudius. Hamlet, horrified, vows to “remember” and swears his friends to secrecy about what they have seen.\n\nEnter Ghost and Hamlet.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0719 Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak. I’ll go no\n\n0720 further.\n\nGHOST\n\n0721 Mark me.\n\np. 57\n\nHAMLET 0722 I will.\n\nGHOST 0723 5 My hour is almost come\n\n0724 When I to sulf’rous and tormenting flames\n\n0725 Must render up myself.\n\nHAMLET 0726 Alas, poor ghost!\n\nGHOST\n\n0727 Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing\n\n0728 10 To what I shall unfold.\n\nHAMLET 0729 Speak. I am bound to hear.\n\nGHOST\n\n0730 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.\n\nHAMLET 0731 What?\n\nGHOST 0732 I am thy father’s spirit,\n\n0733 15 Doomed for a certain term to walk the night\n\n0734 And for the day confined to fast in fires\n\n0735 Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature\n\n0736 Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid\n\n0737 To tell the secrets of my prison house,\n\n0738 20 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word\n\n0739 Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,\n\n0740 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their\n\n0741 spheres,\n\n0742 Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part,\n\n0743 25 And each particular hair to stand an end,\n\n0744 Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.\n\n0745 But this eternal blazon must not be\n\n0746 To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!\n\n0747 If thou didst ever thy dear father love—\n\nHAMLET 0748 30O God!\n\nGHOST\n\n0749 Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\n\nHAMLET 0750 Murder?\n\nGHOST\n\n0751 Murder most foul, as in the best it is,\n\n0752 But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0753 35 Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift\n\np. 59\n\n0754 As meditation or the thoughts of love,\n\n0755 May sweep to my revenge.\n\nGHOST 0756 I find thee apt;\n\n0757 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\n\n0758 40 That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\n\n0759 Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\n\n0760 ’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\n\n0761 A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark\n\n0762 Is by a forgèd process of my death\n\n0763 45 Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,\n\n0764 The serpent that did sting thy father’s life\n\n0765 Now wears his crown.\n\nHAMLET 0766 O, my prophetic soul! My uncle!\n\nGHOST\n\n0767 Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\n\n0768 50 With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts—\n\n0769 O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power\n\n0770 So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust\n\n0771 The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\n\n0772 O Hamlet, what ⟨a⟩ falling off was there!\n\n0773 55 From me, whose love was of that dignity\n\n0774 That it went hand in hand even with the vow\n\n0775 I made to her in marriage, and to decline\n\n0776 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\n\n0777 To those of mine.\n\n0778 60 But virtue, as it never will be moved,\n\n0779 Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,\n\n0780 So, ⟨lust,⟩ though to a radiant angel linked,\n\n0781 Will ⟨sate⟩ itself in a celestial bed\n\n0782 And prey on garbage.\n\n0783 65 But soft, methinks I scent the morning air.\n\n0784 Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\n\n0785 My custom always of the afternoon,\n\n0786 Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole\n\n0787 With juice of cursèd hebona in a vial\n\n0788 70 And in the porches of my ears did pour\n\np. 61\n\n0789 The leprous distilment, whose effect\n\n0790 Holds such an enmity with blood of man\n\n0791 That swift as quicksilver it courses through\n\n0792 The natural gates and alleys of the body,\n\n0793 75 And with a sudden vigor it doth ⟨posset⟩\n\n0794 And curd, like eager droppings into milk,\n\n0795 The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,\n\n0796 And a most instant tetter barked about,\n\n0797 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\n\n0798 80 All my smooth body.\n\n0799 Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand\n\n0800 Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,\n\n0801 Cut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,\n\n0802 Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,\n\n0803 85 No reck’ning made, but sent to my account\n\n0804 With all my imperfections on my head.\n\n0805 O horrible, O horrible, most horrible!\n\n0806 If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.\n\n0807 Let not the royal bed of Denmark be\n\n0808 90 A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.\n\n0809 But, howsomever thou pursues this act,\n\n0810 Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\n\n0811 Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven\n\n0812 And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge\n\n0813 95 To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.\n\n0814 The glowworm shows the matin to be near\n\n0815 And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\n\n0816 Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.⟨He exits.⟩\n\nHAMLET\n\n0817 O all you host of heaven! O Earth! What else?\n\n0818 100 And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart,\n\n0819 And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\n\n0820 But bear me ⟨stiffly⟩ up. Remember thee?\n\n0821 Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat\n\n0822 In this distracted globe. Remember thee?\n\n0823 105 Yea, from the table of my memory\n\np. 63\n\n0824 I’ll wipe away all trivial, fond records,\n\n0825 All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\n\n0826 That youth and observation copied there,\n\n0827 And thy commandment all alone shall live\n\n0828 110 Within the book and volume of my brain,\n\n0829 Unmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!\n\n0830 O most pernicious woman!\n\n0831 O villain, villain, smiling, damnèd villain!\n\n0832 My tables—meet it is I set it down\n\n0833 115 That one may smile and smile and be a villain.\n\n0834 At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.\n\n⌜He writes.⌝\n\n0835 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word.\n\n0836 It is “adieu, adieu, remember me.”\n\n0837 I have sworn ’t.\n\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n\nHORATIO 0838 120My lord, my lord!\n\nMARCELLUS 0839 Lord Hamlet.\n\nHORATIO 0840 Heavens secure him!\n\nHAMLET 0841 So be it.\n\nMARCELLUS 0842 Illo, ho, ho, my lord!\n\nHAMLET 0843 125Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, ⟨bird,⟩ come!\n\nMARCELLUS\n\n0844 How is ’t, my noble lord?\n\nHORATIO 0845 What news, my lord?\n\nHAMLET 0846 O, wonderful!\n\nHORATIO\n\n0847 Good my lord, tell it.\n\nHAMLET 0848 130 No, you will reveal it.\n\nHORATIO\n\n0849 Not I, my lord, by heaven.\n\nMARCELLUS 0850 Nor I, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0851 How say you, then? Would heart of man once think\n\n0852 it?\n\n0853 135 But you’ll be secret?\n\np. 65\n\nHORATIO/MARCELLUS 0854 Ay, by heaven, ⟨my lord.⟩\n\nHAMLET\n\n0855 There’s never a villain dwelling in all Denmark\n\n0856 But he’s an arrant knave.\n\nHORATIO\n\n0857 There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\n\n0858 140 To tell us this.\n\nHAMLET 0859 Why, right, you are in the right.\n\n0860 And so, without more circumstance at all,\n\n0861 I hold it fit that we shake hands and part,\n\n0862 You, as your business and desire shall point you\n\n0863 145 (For every man hath business and desire,\n\n0864 Such as it is), and for my own poor part,\n\n0865 I will go pray.\n\nHORATIO\n\n0866 These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0867 I am sorry they offend you, heartily;\n\n0868 150 Yes, faith, heartily.\n\nHORATIO 0869 There’s no offense, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0870 Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,\n\n0871 And much offense, too. Touching this vision here,\n\n0872 It is an honest ghost—that let me tell you.\n\n0873 155 For your desire to know what is between us,\n\n0874 O’ermaster ’t as you may. And now, good friends,\n\n0875 As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\n\n0876 Give me one poor request.\n\nHORATIO 0877 What is ’t, my lord? We will.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0878 160 Never make known what you have seen tonight.\n\nHORATIO/MARCELLUS 0879 My lord, we will not.\n\nHAMLET 0880 Nay, but swear ’t.\n\nHORATIO 0881 In faith, my lord, not I.\n\nMARCELLUS 0882 Nor I, my lord, in faith.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0883 165 Upon my sword.\n\np. 67\n\nMARCELLUS 0884 We have sworn, my lord, already.\n\nHAMLET 0885 Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.\n\nGHOST cries under the stage 0886 Swear.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0887 Ha, ha, boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there,\n\n0888 170 truepenny?\n\n0889 Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.\n\n0890 Consent to swear.\n\nHORATIO 0891 Propose the oath, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0892 Never to speak of this that you have seen,\n\n0893 175 Swear by my sword.\n\nGHOST, ⌜beneath⌝ 0894 Swear.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0895 Hic et ubique? Then we’ll shift our ground.\n\n0896 Come hither, gentlemen,\n\n0897 And lay your hands again upon my sword.\n\n0898 180 Swear by my sword\n\n0899 Never to speak of this that you have heard.\n\nGHOST, ⌜beneath⌝ 0900 Swear by his sword.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0901 Well said, old mole. Canst work i’ th’ earth so fast?—\n\n0902 A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.\n\nHORATIO\n\n0903 185 O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0904 And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.\n\n0905 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\n\n0906 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come.\n\n0907 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,\n\n0908 190 How strange or odd some’er I bear myself\n\n0909 (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet\n\n0910 To put an antic disposition on)\n\n0911 That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,\n\n0912 With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,\n\n0913 195 Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,\n\np. 69\n\n0914 As “Well, well, we know,” or “We could an if we\n\n0915 would,”\n\n0916 Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be an if they\n\n0917 might,”\n\n0918 200 Or such ambiguous giving-out, to note\n\n0919 That you know aught of me—this do swear,\n\n0920 So grace and mercy at your most need help you.\n\nGHOST, ⌜beneath⌝ 0921 Swear.\n\nHAMLET\n\n0922 Rest, rest, perturbèd spirit.—So, gentlemen,\n\n0923 205 With all my love I do commend me to you,\n\n0924 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is\n\n0925 May do t’ express his love and friending to you,\n\n0926 God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,\n\n0927 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.\n\n0928 210 The time is out of joint. O cursèd spite\n\n0929 That ever I was born to set it right!\n\n0930 Nay, come, let’s go together.\n\nThey exit."
