        "text": "The Crown returned on Sunday (15 November), with series four focusing on the relationship between Queen Elizabeth II (Olivia Colman) and Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson).\n\nA divide between the two leaders begins to play out in episode two, “The Balmoral Test”, after Thatcher fires half of her cabinet because of their “lack of grit as a consequence of their privilege and entitlement”.\n\nIn response, the Queen tells Thatcher that she’s playing a “dangerous game” making so many enemies, to which the prime minister replies that she is “comfortable” with having enemies.\n\nThatcher then recites “No Enemies” by Scottish poet Charles Mackay, who lived from 1814 to 1889.\n\nMackay was a part of the Chartist movement, which campaigned for the working class people of England to gain political rights, suffrage and influence. It was at its most popular from 1838 to 1948.\n\nIn real life, Thatcher was extremely fond of the poem, with a 2019 BBC documentary revealing that she kept it on her desk.\n\nRead the full poem below…\n\nYOU have no enemies, you say?\n\nAlas! my friend, the boast is poor;\n\nHe who has mingled in the fray\n\nOf duty, that the brave endure,\n\nMust have made foes! If you have none,\n\nSmall is the work that you have done.\n\nYou’ve hit no traitor on the hip,\n\nYou’ve dashed no cup from perjured lip,\n\nYou’ve never turned the wrong to right,\n\nYou’ve been a coward in the fight."
