        "text": "The NHS will provide any clinically necessary treatment needed to keep your mouth, teeth and gums healthy and free of pain.\n\nDecisions about which treatment is appropriate will be based on a clinical assessment and clinical judgement.\n\nYour dentist must make clear which treatments can be provided on the NHS and which can only be provided on a private basis, and the costs associated for each.\n\nIf you decide to choose alternative private options, this should be included in your treatment plan. You'll be asked to sign the plan and be given a copy to keep.\n\nAsk the dentist to explain in more detail the reason behind the treatment options being proposed.\n\nYou should feel properly informed before any treatment is undertaken, including about the clinical risks and benefits.\n\nYour dentist has to provide you with a written treatment plan for Band 2, Band 3 or a mix of NHS and private treatments.\n\nYour treatment plan sets out the proposed dental treatment and associated costs.\n\nTreatment plans are not usually given for Band 1 or urgent dental treatments, but you can ask for one if you like.\n\nInform your dentist if you decide not to proceed with a certain treatment option.\n\nLikewise, the dentist should inform you of any changes to the treatment plan.\n\nSometimes a proposed treatment can change on further investigation or as a result of changes in your oral health after the initial assessment.\n\nAny changes to treatment should be discussed and agreed with you.\n\nCommon dental treatments available on the NHS\n\nCrowns and bridges\n\nCrowns and bridges are available on the NHS (Band 3, £319.10).\n\nAs with all restoration treatments, they may need to be replaced in the future.\n\nYou may be offered a metal-coloured crown on a back tooth to help restore it.\n\nYou could discuss with your dentist what alternative cosmetic options can be offered privately, and the risks and benefits of these, to help you make an informed decision.\n\nFind out more:\n\nWhat are dentures, bridges and veneers made of?\n\nDental abscesses\n\nA dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form in the teeth or gums as a result of a bacterial infection.\n\nDental abscesses can be treated on the NHS (usually Band 1, £26.80).\n\nIf you feel unwell or have a large swelling in your face or mouth, your dentist may refer you to a specialist for treatment.\n\nThis treatment is also available on the NHS.\n\nFind out more about dental abscesses.\n\nDentures (false teeth)\n\nDentures are removable false teeth made of acrylic (plastic) or metal. Dentures are available on the NHS (Band 3, £319.10).\n\nFind out more about dentures.\n\nOrthodontics\n\nOrthodontics is a type of dental treatment that aims to improve the appearance, position and function of your teeth.\n\nThere is a standard method for assessing whether orthodontic treatment is clinically necessary and available on the NHS.\n\nYour dentist or orthodontist will be able to explain to you what alternative options exist if you or your child do not qualify for NHS-funded orthodontic treatment.\n\nYou cannot mix NHS and private treatment in orthodontics. The British Orthodontic Society offers patient information about general orthodontics, as well as information aimed at adults and teenagers.\n\nFind out more\n\nOrthodontics\n\nBraces\n\nRoot canal treatment (endodontics)\n\nRoot canal treatment is a dental procedure to treat infection at the centre of a tooth (the root canal system). This treatment is available on the NHS (Band 2, £73.50).\n\nYour dentist should be able to provide it for you or, where the treatment is complex, refer you to a practitioner with additional skills.\n\nYou may be offered an option to see a specialist privately as an alternative to being referred on the NHS.\n\nIt will be your choice whether you opt for the private treatment with this specialist or be referred to an NHS specialist service.\n\nFind out more about root canal treatments.\n\nScale and polish\n\nIf your dentist says scaling is clinically required, this is available on the NHS.\n\nThis can be provided by a hygienist or dental therapist.\n\nA simple scaling is included in a Band 1 (£26.80) course of treatment, but more complex treatment for gum problems may be charged within a Band 2 (£73.50) course of treatment.\n\nMany dental hygienists now work under direct access, where you can request to see the hygienist directly for a scale or polish.\n\nHygienists can only provide this open access on a private basis, and you should check the cost of the treatment before booking an appointment.\n\nIf your dentist says a scale and polish is not clinically necessary but you want one anyway, you will have to pay for it privately.\n\nWisdom teeth\n\nWisdom teeth can be removed on the NHS when clinically necessary.\n\nYour dentist will assess the need for removal based on guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).\n\nYour dentist may perform the procedure or refer you to a dentist with additional experience.\n\nYou'll be charged with a Band 2 (£73.50) treatment course.\n\nYour dentist can also refer you for private wisdom teeth treatment if you wish.\n\nFind out more about wisdom tooth removal.\n\nWhite fillings\n\nWhere clinically appropriate, white fillings are available on the NHS and are generally charged as Band 2 (£73.50).\n\nFor example, if you need a filling in one of your front teeth (incisors and canines), the filling material of choice may be a white filling.\n\nIf the filling is in one of your back teeth (such as molars and premolars), for a large filling the more clinically effective option may be an amalgam filling (a silver-coloured material).\n\nYour dentist should explain the options to you in advance.\n\nIf you prefer to have the white filling or any other cosmetic filling options, your dentist will be able to advise you on the private costs for such treatments, and the risks and benefits associated with it.\n\nFind out more about what NHS fillings and crowns are made of\n\nComplaints\n\nIf you're not happy with the treatment or service you have had, it's usually best to tell the practice directly that you're unhappy and give them a chance to put things right.\n\nThey may be able to sort out the problem there and then.\n\nIf you need to make a more formal complaint to the practice, ask for a copy of the policy that explains what you need to do.\n\nIf you'd like support to make a complaint, you can get help from an NHS Complaints Advocate.\n\nContact your local Healthwatch to find out who provides Independent Health Complaints Advocacy in your local area.\n\nIf you'd rather not go directly to the practice, you can contact your local integrated care board (ICB) instead.\n\nIntegrated care boards (ICBs) are responsible for commissioning (buying) NHS dental services.\n\nIf you're not happy with the way your complaint was handled – either by the dental practice or the integrated care board (ICB), if you chose to go to them – you can go to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO).\n\nThe Ombudsman makes the final decision on complaints that have not been resolved by the NHS in England.\n\nFind out more about feedback and complaints about NHS services on the NHS England website.\n\nComplaints about private dental treatments\n\nIf you had private dental treatment and an informal approach does not solve the problem, ask for a copy of the complaints procedure.\n\nAny private dental practice must have one.\n\nIf you have already made a formal approach to the practice and the problem has not been resolved, you can contact the Dental Complaints Service (DCS).\n\nThe DCS provides a free and impartial service to help private dental patients and dental professionals settle complaints about private dental care fairly and efficiently.\n\nSafety concerns about a dentist or practice\n\nIf the problem is so serious that you think the dental professional could be a risk to other patients, you should contact the General Dental Council (GDC), which regulates dental professionals in the UK.\n\nIf the issue is serious enough, the GDC can stop individual dentists from practising.\n\nThe GDC does not get involved in complaints being managed locally. It does not resolve complaints or award compensation.\n\nIf the problem is so serious that you think the care provided at the practice could be a risk to other patients, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) would like to know about it.\n\nThe CQC cannot investigate individual complaints, but its inspectors use this information when they inspect services to make sure they're meeting quality and safety standards."
