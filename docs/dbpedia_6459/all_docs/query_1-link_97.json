        "text": "A little over a year ago, I made a beauty move I'd been fantasizing about for years: I went from brunette to colorful strands with the help of blue hair dye, by dyeing my hair blue with green at the ends. I walked out of the salon feeling like a mermaid whose inner self was finally out there for the world to see.\n\nI loved my mermaid hair, but it's also been more work than I expected. Because of that, I've since let my hair grow in brown instead of re-coloring it. That said, through my time with colorful hair, I learned a few key lessons. Here are some things I didn't realize about coloring my hair that you should definitely read up on before taking that plunge.\n\n1. It takes a LONG time.\n\nI expected to be in and out of the salon in one afternoon, but I got in at noon and didn't leave until after 6:00 PM. Between washing, bleaching, drying, coloring, drying again, styling, and possibly cutting, getting mermaid hair is a time investment whether you go to a salon or do it at home. Basically, don't schedule anything immediately afterward. And maybe bring snacks.\n\n2. Bleach can destroy your hair.\n\nIf you're not already blonde, you'll likely have to bleach your hair so that the color shows up. Bleach zaps your hair of moisture, which can cause damage, says celebrity hairstylist Kiyah Wright. Be prepared to get a haircut when you go in as well, which is sometimes necessary to prevent extreme damage on the ends. This is the main reason I don't plan to color my hair again: The bleach damaged it so much, I still can't wear it down to this day unless it's been blow-dried, or it just poufs out in a ball of frizz.\n\n3. You can minimize the damage, though.\n\nThe good news is that you can take steps to prevent most of the damage and dryness. Jesse German, a celebrity colorist at Martinez-Samuel Salon in West Hollywood, recommends getting a professional conditioning treatment at a salon a few times a year to maintain your hair's moisture and a trim every few months to prevent split ends. Kiyah suggests using a deep conditioning and moisturizing conditioner or hair mask every week (try the Leonor Greyl Masque Fleurs de Jasmin for an effective treatment that also boasts the prettiest scent).\n\nYou should also talk to your colorist about taking steps to prevent over-bleaching your hair in the first place — a good colorist will be able to tell you what's feasible and what's not, and won't damage your hair in order to get your dream color.\n\n4. It fades fast.\n\nI didn't realize that even though I dyed my hair blue, those strands would spend the majority of their lifetime green. Within a month, the hair was teal, and within in two months, it was a pastel green. Red dye is also notoriously short-lived, turning to copper and orange, says Kiyah. Black and brunette are safer but still fade eventually. Jesse says you'll have to touch up a color about every two months to maintain it. To make this less necessary, he recommends a toner and color-safe shampoo. You can also use a color-depositing conditioner, says Kiyah. (The Davines Alchemic and evo Fabuloso lines are particularly good for this.)\n\nIn addition to fading, your roots will start to show as your hair grows out. If you don't want to rock grown-out roots, you'll have to go in for touchups. Platinum blonde hair, for example, can require a touchup as often as every 10 days, says Sharon Dorram, master colorist at Sharon Dorram at Sally Hershberger Salon.\n\n5. Certain factors make it fade even faster.\n\nI recently redid my blue hair right before a vacation, only to see it fade again after a few days. I probably have all the time I spent in pools, oceans, and jacuzzis to thank for that. Chlorine and salt water can both add a green tint to your hair hue, says Kiyah. You can get the green out through a treatment mask, clarifying shampoo — or, weirdly, ketchup or tomato juice. To avoid this issue from the get go, try putting on a color-preserving conditioner before you go swimming.\n\nHair products containing alcohol and sunlight can also impact your hair color and make it fade faster. In both cases, a UV-protectant like iThrive Color Vibrancy Color Treatment can help preserve your color in the sun. If you dyed your hair a dark shade, avoid clarifying or volumizing shampoos, since they can remove dark pigment, says Kiyah. (In general, sulfate-free shampoos like Pureology Hydrate are the way to go.)\n\n6. The dye gets EVERYWHERE.\n\nTo replace the color after it faded, I DIYed my hair dye while I was staying in a hotel. After I washed my hair, I realized I was still leaking blue everywhere. I had to scrub the sink and shower and sleep with a shirt around my head so I didn't get any more dye on the towels or the pillow.\n\nLesson learned: If you have to dye your own hair, let it dry before sleeping so it doesn't get all over your bed. Kiyah recommends splurging on a salon, though, especially if you want a drastic change. There's just too much that can go wrong if you're not in the hands of a professional — and your mermaid strands deserve the best."
