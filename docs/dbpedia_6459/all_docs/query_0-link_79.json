        "text": "What does the parietal lobe do?\n\nYour brain’s parietal (pronounced “pa-RY-ah-tul”) lobe handles a few different jobs.\n\nSelf-perception\n\nYour parietal lobe is a processing center for sensations you can feel with your sense of touch. These include temperature (hot and cold), pressure, vibration and pain.\n\nSelf-perception also uses your sense of touch to tell you where parts of your body are without needing to see them (the technical term for this is “proprioception”). A good way to test this is to close your eyes and bring the palm of your hand up to your face. Even with your eyes closed, you can usually tell the approximate position of your hand (and avoid smacking yourself in the face).\n\nSensory integration\n\nOther brain areas process sensory information they’re responsible for, and then forward what they processed to your parietal lobe. Your parietal lobe takes that information, including the self-perception information mentioned above, and integrates it into a form you can understand. It then sends information to other areas of your brain so you can respond (or not respond) to what you sense.\n\nLearned movements\n\nYour parietal lobe also helps you learn each time you plan and carry out complex, precise movements. A big example of this is writing. That’s why writing gets easier with practice. The same is true of similar activities like doing math by hand.\n\nLocation awareness\n\nYour parietal lobe plays a key role in how you understand where things are around you. Knowing if something is on your left or right side, for example, is a function that relies on your parietal lobe.\n\nYour parietal lobe is also an important part of “big picture” perception. It helps you process situations when you perceive multiple objects in a related context. An example of this would be seeing a stove, countertops, sink and refrigerator and understanding that you’re looking at a kitchen.\n\nWhat are the common conditions and disorders that affect the parietal lobe?\n\nMany conditions and disorders can affect your brain, most of which can affect your parietal lobe. Some of the most common include:\n\nAlzheimer’s disease.\n\nLewy body dementia.\n\nBrain lesions (either from diseases or with damage from surgery or medical procedures).\n\nBrain tumors (including cancer).\n\nConcussions and other traumatic brain injuries (these are rare because of the parietal lobe’s location).\n\nGerstmann syndrome.\n\nBalint syndrome.\n\nHeadaches and migraines.\n\nInfections (including those that cause encephalitis).\n\nMental health conditions that can involve hallucinations, such as schizophrenia.\n\nSeizures and seizure-related conditions such as epilepsy.\n\nStroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).\n\nWhat are some common signs or symptoms of parietal lobe conditions?\n\nMany symptoms can happen with conditions that affect your parietal lobe. However, some symptoms are more likely or more common, and they usually fall into specific categories.\n\nDisruptions in learned abilities\n\nThese abilities involve coordination between your eyes and hands. Examples include:\n\nAgraphia (inability to write, a more severe form of dysgraphia).\n\nAcalculia (inability to do math, a more severe form of dyscalculia).\n\nAlexia (inability to read, a more severe form of dyslexia).\n\nDifficulty telling apart left from right.\n\nFinger agnosia (trouble identifying and telling apart different fingers).\n\nSense of touch problems\n\nSymptoms can affect your sense of touch in many ways, including what you can feel or how your brain processes that information. Touch-related symptoms include:\n\nDisruptions in your ability to feel temperature, pressure, vibration or pain.\n\nTrouble recognizing an object with your sense of touch (you can still recognize them in other ways, such as by looking at them). For instance, if you close your eyes and someone places a metal key in your hand, you should be able to move it around in your hands and identify it by touch. People with parietal lobe damage may have trouble with this or may not be able to do it at all.\n\nPerception issues\n\nYour parietal lobe helps with your sense of direction relative to the world around you. A major part of that is how you tell left from right, how you orient yourself and parts of your body using your eyesight, and how you understand sensory input from both sides of your body. Symptoms can include:\n\nConfusing left and right sides.\n\nLoss of control when shifting your gaze, not related to muscles of your eye (ocular motor apraxia).\n\nTrouble seeing how objects fit into a setting, like being able to see individual trees without recognizing that you’re looking at a forest (simultagnosia).\n\nReaching for and missing something while looking at it (optic ataxia).\n\nWhat are some common tests to check the health of the parietal lobe?\n\nThere are many ways healthcare providers can check the health of your parietal lobe. These include diagnostic tests, lab tests, imaging scans and more. Examples include:\n\nBlood tests (these can detect many problems, ranging from immune system issues to toxins and poisons, especially metals like copper, mercury or lead).\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scan.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid tests.\n\nElectroencephalogram (EEG).\n\nElectromyogram (nerve conduction test).\n\nEvoked potentials (sensory tests).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nNeurological examination.\n\nNeuropsychological assessment.\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan.\n\nWhat are common treatments for conditions affecting the parietal lobe?\n\nThere are many possible treatments for conditions that affect your parietal lobe, and they can vary widely depending on the issue. A healthcare provider is the best person to tell you about the available treatments and which they recommend.\n\nWhat can I do to take care of my parietal lobe?\n\nYou can do many things to maintain the health of your entire brain, including your parietal lobe. Some brain-related conditions are preventable. Others aren’t preventable, but you may be able to reduce your risk of developing them. Some things you can do to maintain your brain health include:\n\nEngage your brain. Your brain is like any other part of your body. To keep it healthy, you need to put it to work. Keeping your brain busy is a key way to delay age-related decline in mental abilities, especially your memory.\n\nEat a balanced diet. What you eat affects your circulatory health, so your diet affects how your brain works (a stroke is an example of a condition that happens when circulatory disorders affect your brain). Too much or too little of certain vitamins can also affect your brain.\n\nReach and maintain a weight that’s healthy for you, and find ways to be physically active. Your weight and activity level can prevent or delay conditions that affect your brain, especially circulatory issues like high blood pressure. Your primary care provider can advise you on what weight range is healthy for you and help you find ways to reach and stay in that range. Physical activity also benefits brain health directly, encouraging good circulation and how your brain produces chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which your brain uses for communication.\n\nWear safety equipment as needed. Concussions and traumatic brain injuries can disrupt how your parietal lobe works. Helmets, safety restraints (such as seat belts) and other types of protective gear are essential to preventing serious injuries.\n\nManage your chronic conditions. Many conditions that affect your brain worsen over time. However, treating those conditions can sometimes stop them or delay how long it takes for them to worsen. Examples of conditions like this include Type 2 diabetes, epilepsy and more.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nYour parietal lobe is a key part of how you understand the world around you. It also processes your sense of touch, and it plays an important role in how you control the movement and positioning of your body. While your parietal lobe is at the top of your brain, it’s not always at the top of your mind or something you think about often. Taking care of the health of your entire brain — including your parietal lobe — can make a big difference in your life. That way, you can take in the world around you and prioritize the parts of your life that you value most."
