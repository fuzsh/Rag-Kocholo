        "text": "Chapter Text\n\n“Talk?”\n\nThe spirit knight, Natsuki Subaru, looked at his counterpart with a mixture of confusion and disgust. His voice trembled with barely contained rage. “Do you really think I’d want to talk with you? After all the shit you pulled!” he shouted, gesturing towards the ruined state of the city around them.\n\n“Oh come on, that was just a bit of fun,” the Archbishop, Pride, forced a chuckle, trying to find his own sense of humor amidst the serious situation. The laugh was hollow, failing to mask the malice in his eyes. “Besides, you don’t have much of a choice. I’ve already called Elsa over… so we might as well have a chat.”\n\n“That sucks for you, considering the fact that your psycho girlfriend is busy fighting my friends,” Subaru snapped back, his voice dripping with sarcasm.\n\nThe Archbishop gave an exasperated sigh, shaking his head in mock disappointment. “Think for a second with that brain I’m… 90% sure you have. Where do you think all the cultists who were following me went?”\n\nSubaru’s mouth clamped shut as he processed Pride’s words, his mind racing to piece together the implications. He also noted that Pride didn’t shut down the idea that he was dating Elsa right away… something he was certainly going to use later.\n\n“Finally, some peace and quiet,” Pride said, a smug smile playing on his lips. “Honestly, it’s so much better when the only one talking is yourself… well, I can’t really say that considering who I’m talking to.”\n\n“Cut it with your stupid jokes,” Subaru growled, his patience wearing thin.\n\n“What?” Pride said defensively. “I thought you liked cracking jokes. I’m sure your friends will be fine… probably. I give them like a 50/50 chance.”\n\n“Not helping…” Subaru muttered through gritted teeth.\n\n“I know, I wasn’t trying to,” Pride replied, his tone casual, as if they were discussing the weather.\n\n“Just get to the point, you psychopath,” Subaru demanded, his frustration boiling over.\n\n“Hey, if I’m a psychopath, so are you!” Pride retorted, his eyes narrowing.\n\n“We’re nothing alike,” Subaru shot back, his voice firm with conviction.\n\n“Really? This handsome face of mine disagrees,” Pride said, grinning widely. Subaru’s anger flared, the Archbishop’s arrogance fueling his rage.\n\nSubaru was quickly growing infuriated with this “conversation.” Was this how his enemies felt talking to him? If so, he owed all of them an apology.\n\n“Now, before we start, there are two things I want you to know.” Pride held up one finger before continuing. “I know my precious Emilia is hiding somewhere around here. You probably told her to freeze my limbs so I couldn’t do anything drastic…”\n\nHe then held up a second finger. “Two, I have a makeshift vial of poison attached to my mouth. If I ever feel threatened, I’ll bite down and—well, you already know what happens.” He opened his mouth, pointing to a container inside. It was just like he said; Subaru couldn’t touch him or he would be risking a reset.\n\n“Now then, I feel like I’ve been doing most of the talking. You go ahead… ask anything, I’m all ears, for real this time! But I would recommend hurrying up; Elsa isn’t a really patient woman so…”\n\nSubaru snickered slightly. “What, are you worried she’s going to take you for another round?”\n\nThis question threw Pride off guard, and it took him a bit to reclaim his thoughts. “Didn’t I tell you not to imply I do things with that freak?”\n\n“Well, you’ve done a lot of things, considering for some unknown reason you’ve teamed up with her…. Why is that?”\n\n“She was convenient and useful to me, that’s all.”\n\n“Convenient? Teaming up with the lady who killed me three times is not something I’d do—”\n\n“Eighty-eight…”\n\nSubaru was forced to stop talking as Pride interrupted him part way through. “It was eighty-eight times… not three…”\n\n“You’re not really helping your case here…”\n\n“…”\n\nSilence overtook the area before Subaru continued. “Doesn’t sound like you had the best time…”\n\n“You think?” Pride looked up at the sky, almost as if getting lost in the past. “But it doesn’t matter. That day… or several days to be more specific, taught me one thing… that death is the best ally I have in this world, and I will use death in whatever way I need to achieve my goals.”\n\n“So you’re throwing your own life away to achieve what you want? Sounds kind of twisted.”\n\nHe said knowing full well that what he was saying was hypocritical… but he felt if there was one person who could call someone out on this… it was someone who was guilty of the exact same thing.\n\n“I never claimed I wasn’t twisted…” Pride wasn’t wrong. Every time Subaru called him a psychopath, a crazy person, anything of the sort, he never tried to refute it, almost as if he embraced those titles wholeheartedly.\n\n“What do you want?”\n\n“Come on, don’t tell me you’re so mentally inept I have to spell it out for you?”\n\n“Can you seriously not go a minute without insulting me?”\n\n“Why would I stop doing something that’s fun?” Pride snickered slightly before continuing. “It should be obvious…” He extended his arms out as if presenting the city he burned as a crowning achievement of his. “I want to be the villain… and the day I die, I want to make sure everything here goes with me…”\n\n“You're a selfish bastard…” Subaru said with a grimace as he clenched his fist.\n\n“So are you… but there's no need to point out the obvious,\" he said with his usual condescending attitude.\n\n“Seriously, what would Mom and Dad think seeing you like this?”\n\nSuddenly, the Archbishop’s eyes snapped with rage as his tone escalated dramatically. “AT LEAST I’M DOING SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE THIS TIME INSTEAD OF ROTTING MY USELESS LIFE AWAY IN MY ROOM!”\n\nSubaru flinched at the sudden outburst, the raw emotion catching him off guard. It made Pride look more human, far more human than the cold, calculating figure he had faced up to this point.\n\nAfter a few deep breaths, Pride continued, his voice more controlled but filled with a deep-seated bitterness. “I wanted a purpose… I wanted to be somebody, but as you know… I have no strength, so I want to take it from others…” His mind flashed to Reinhard, the epitome of strength and virtue he could never attain.\n\n“I have no knowledge, so I use others to compensate.” His thoughts went back to the various people he’d manipulated, exploiting their skills and intelligence to serve his own ends.\n\n“And yet I continue to struggle in this stupid world.” His mind replayed the countless deaths he had experienced, each one a painful reminder of his own inadequacies and failures.\n\n“Every part of me is twisted, every part of me disgusting… I understand that I will never be a hero… I can never stand beside truly great people, so I stopped trying to stand beside them… and instead, I’ll leech off them like the rotten person I am. I’ll be the parasite that I always knew I was but never had the courage to be. I thought that I had no character, but I was wrong…”\n\nHe paused slightly before extending his arms out again, as if embracing his own vileness. The fire around him flared to life, almost as if responding to his own emotions. “I hate myself, and I’ll forever take pride in that.”"
