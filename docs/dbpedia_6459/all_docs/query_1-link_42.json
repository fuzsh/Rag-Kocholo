        "text": "CASSIUS\n\nTherefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laugher, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester, if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And, after, scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.\n\nCASSIUS\n\nBe prepared to listen, good Brutus. And since you know the best way to see yourself is by reflection, I'll act as your mirror and show to you the parts of yourself of which you are unaware, without exaggerating. Don’t be suspicious of what I say, noble Brutus. If I were some frivolous fool; or made the same stale vows of friendship to every new friend I met; or if you knew that I flatter men to their faces only to slander them once they're gone; or if you learn that I make declarations of friendship to all the mobs of people while at a feast, then, of course, don't believe me.\n\nCASSIUS\n\nI know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life, but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar. So were you. We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me, “Darest thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow. So indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake! His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan, Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books— “Alas,” it cried, “give me some drink, Titinius,” As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone.\n\nCASSIUS\n\nI see that good quality in you, Brutus. It’s as familiar to me as your appearance. In fact, honor is what I want to discuss with you. I don’t know what you and other men think of this life. But, as for me, I’d rather not live at all than stand in awe of a man no better than myself. I was born as free as Caesar. So were you. We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the winter's cold as well as he. Once, on a harsh and windy day, as the Tiber River swelled against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, would you dare to jump with me into this rough water and swim to that distant point?” The moment he said that—though I was still in my clothes—I jumped in and told him to follow. He did. The water roared, and we fought against it with all our strength, inspired to overcome it by our competitive natures. But before we could reach our destination, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I'll sink!” Just like Aeneas carried on his shoulders his elderly father Anchises from the fires of Troy, I carry the tired Caesar from the waves of the Tiber. And this man has now become a god, while I am a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar carelessly nods my way. When he was in Spain, Caesar had a fever. And when he was in its grip, I noticed how he shook. It’s true, this “god” was shaking! His cowardly lips lost their color, and that same eye whose gaze now terrifies the world lost its gleam. Yes, I heard him groan. And that tongue of his that ordered the Romans to listen to him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried like a sick girl, “Oh, get me a drink, Titinius.” Oh, by the gods, it amazes me that a man of such weak constitution could get an advantage over the entire world and carry the prize of victory alone.\n\nCASSIUS\n\nWhy, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars But in ourselves, that we are underlings. Brutus and Caesar—what should be in that “Caesar?” Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name. Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well. Weigh them, it is as heavy. Conjure with 'em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough, When there is in it but one only man. Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say, There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king.\n\nCASSIUS\n\nWhy, sir, he straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peek out just to find our graves, as if we were slaves. Men can be masters of their fate. Brutus, our problem is not destiny, but ourselves. “Brutus” and “Caesar\"—what's special about “Caesar?” Why should that name be shouted more than yours? Write them together—yours looks just as good. Say them—yours is just as pleasant to say. Weigh them—it’s just as heavy. Do magic with them, and “Brutus” will call up a spirit just as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what meat Caesar has eaten that has made him grow to be so great? The people of our time should be ashamed! Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men! When was there an age, since the great flood, that didn’t contain more than one famous man? When could anyone speaking of Rome say, before now, that just one man ruled the entire city? Indeed, now Rome only has room for one man. Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say that once there was a Brutus—your ancestor—who would have let the devil reign in the Roman Republic before he would allow a king.\n\nBRUTUS\n\nThat you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider, what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us.\n\nBRUTUS\n\nI do not doubt that you love me. I’m starting to understand what you would like me to do. I'll tell you what I think about this and about what’s happening in Rome later. For the moment—in the name of our friendship—I would prefer that you not try to do any more persuading. I’ll think over what you’ve said; I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say; and I’ll find an appropriate time for us to consider and make a decision about such weighty matters. Until then, my noble friend, think about this: I would rather be some villager than call myself a citizen of Rome during the difficult situation these times are likely to put us through.\n\nCAESAR\n\n[aside to ANTONY] Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much. He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony . He hears no music. Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him.\n\nCAESAR\n\n[To ANTONY so that only he can hear] If only he were fatter! But I’m not afraid of him. Yet, if I myself were capable of fear, I don’t know of any man I would avoid more than skinny Cassius. He reads a lot. He’s a skilled observer, and he sees the hidden motives behind men’s actions. He doesn’t enjoy plays like you do, Antony. He never listens to music. He almost never smiles. Though when he does smile, he does it as if he’s mocking the part of himself that could be inspired to smile by anything. Men like him can never be content as long as they know that there is someone better and more powerful than they are. And therefore they’re very dangerous. I’m telling you what should be feared rather than what I fear, because, after all, I am Caesar. Step over to my right side, because my left ear is deaf, and tell me honestly what you think of Cassius.\n\nCASCA\n\nI can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery. I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once—but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it . Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again—but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by. And still, as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopp'd hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar—for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, Idurst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.\n\nCASCA\n\nI'd just as soon be hanged than describe it! It was all foolishness. I paid no attention. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, it was more like a wreath—and, as I told you, Caesar refused it once. Although, in my opinion, he would’ve gladly taken it. Then Antony offered it to him again, and Caesar refused it again—though, in my opinion, he didn't want to take his hand off it. Then Antony offered it the third time, and Caesar refused it the third time. Yet even as he refused it, the masses hooted and clapped their chapped hands, and threw up their sweaty hats, and roared out such a load of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it nearly choked Caesar, who fainted and fell down. As for me, I didn’t dare laugh because I feared opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air.\n\nCASCA\n\nMarry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked meope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them. If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less.\n\nCASCA\n\nWell, before he fell down—when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown—he pulled open his jacket and offered them his throat to cut. If I were a common laborer and didn't take him at his word and cut his throat, then to hell with me. Then he fainted. When he came to, he said to the crowd that if he’d done or said anything wrong, he wanted them to know that it was caused by his sickness. Three or four women standing near me cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But don't pay any attention to them—if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have said the same thing.\n\nCASSIUS\n\nWell, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes, For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night, In several hands, in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at. And after this let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure.\n\nCASSIUS\n\nWell, Brutus, you’re noble. Yet I see that your honorable nature can be turned from its usual inclination. Therefore, it's better for noble men to spend time only with other noble men, because who is so firm that he can’t be seduced? Caesar doesn't like me, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, I wouldn’t have let him persuade me. Tonight I’ll throw a few letters through his window—each written with different handwriting, as if they came from different citizens—all saying how great his reputation is throughout all of Rome, while also hinting at Caesar’s ambition. And after this, Caesar won't be able to sit comfortably in his power, because we’ll either overthrow him, or suffer worse than we do now."
