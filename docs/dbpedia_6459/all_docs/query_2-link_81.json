        "text": "An excerpt from the diary of Nursing Sister Helen Fowlds, who was at Lemnos when Nursing Sister Munro died of dysentry. The entry was written September 15, 1915, and headed \"Our First Funeral.\" Sadly, it would not be the last, as ten days later, Matron Jessie Jaggard also died of dysentry. Helen writes: Miss Munroe of #3 died at dusk the evening of the 7th of September. She had a severe attack of dysentery and in her weakened state an old heart lesion developed again and in the end was the cause of her death. Mrs. Bell was on Special with her at the last and the day of the funeral she looked about gone herself. They have a large Indian tent for sick nurses and gave Miss Munroe every possible attention. A Specialist saw her the day before and held out no hope though when she lived through that night they hoped for a change. She was a woman of about 50 - very keen for work and as soon as the tents were up, she threw herself into the organization of her particular ward, taking no rest. She was a very fine woman and a great loss to the unit. I had talked to her a great deal coming out, meeting her through Mrs. Bell, and she was so full of enthusiasm. We went over about 2 o'clock as the funeral was the next afternoon. Such a distracted place! Mrs. Jaegert [Jaggard] was nearly crazy, and half sick herself, but gave to the last inch and thoughtful of every detail. The officers had made a casket and covered it with black cotton, and on top they chalked a white cross. It was rude and bare in the extreme but the best obtainable. They closed the coffin early in the day and we are glad to remember her as we knew her on the boat. Every thing possible was done to spare the feelings of the others, and it was wise for they were all partly hysterical and dead tired having Miss Saunders also in a critical condition. We all took our places in the Sisters' mess which had been hurriedly fixed up. The benches were covered with army blankets and in the centre was a table draped with a sheet. The officers brought the body in and though we all knew it wasn't wise to let our feelings get the better of us, the sight of her cap and belt on top of the flag was the crowning touch of pathos. Their padre was a big, whiskered man, who seemed to be trying to make the best of a painful duty. He hastily read the service and in an amazingly short time it was all over. He was very weak and unconvincing but perhaps it was better for the other girls whose nerves were pretty raw. He didn't affect us any more than if he had read so many statements about the weather. We were all together at one end of the mess and the officers at the other, including representatives from the Staff and various surrounding units. After the service there was a long wait for the transport waggons. By this time little Miss Askin was crying like a baby and we all felt rather like outsiders as we couldn't feel as they did. Finally the transport waggons appeared, drawn by four mules with riders, and followed or headed by a firing party as a Tommy had died in the hospital and was to be buried at the same time. We all stood outside while they arranged the transport and then the soldier was carried out to the other waggon. #3 men were paraded and fell in after the waggons, and the officers after them. It had been arranged previously that no Sisters would go to the grave and it was perhaps wise but it seemed too bad to see her go away without a single woman near her. In France all the English Sisters in Boulogne went to the grave when their Sisters died in Wimereux. But when they (#3) didn't go, we couldn't very well. It was one of the hottest days we'd had and the dust rose in clouds. As the little procession vanished over the hill we started home and kept it in sight till it crossed the river. It surely was a sad sight and awfully hard on her people to have her die out here. Such a desolate place for a woman to be buried and everything so different from what it would have been at home. The dirty, springless waggon, the half wild mules needing the whip every few yards to keep them from breaking into a gallop, the white cap fluttering in the wind, the poor little Tommy in the next waggon with spades etc. that they did not trouble to hide, \"the foot sore firing party and the dust and stench and staleness\", the millions of flies, the squad of buglers that joined the procession farther along, all jarred terribly on one's nerves. It was so absolutely matter of fact, and military, strictly active service. Somewhere across the valley they have a graveyard, and later in the afternoon we heard the firing of the Salute and the \"Last Post\". It got me terribly, and every night since when they blow \"Lights out\" from all the camps around I think of that \"Last Post\" wailing across the valley. After all it is only \"Lights Out\" but that morning seems so far away.\n\nCreated by: , Kristen1288"
