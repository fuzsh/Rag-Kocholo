        "text": "In this Pasta Primavera recipe, I swap the heavy cream for a lighter lemony sauce that lets the colorful seasonal vegetables shine. This vegetarian pasta is easy, healthy, and very weeknight-friendly–it’s ready in 40 minutes!\n\nI make pasta primavera sheet pan-style to make things as easy as possible. I simply toss the veggies with olive oil and herbs and roast until they’re just tender, sweet, and a little bit crisped at the edges. Meanwhile, I boil some pasta and throw together a bright fresh salad, like lemon parmesan lettuce salad or panzanella.\n\nThis versatile primavera recipe is a delicious way to celebrate fresh vegetables no matter the season. That means it’s never boring! I rarely make it with the same ingredients twice.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPasta Primavera Ingredients\n\nHow to Make Pasta Primavera\n\nGetting Ahead, Leftovers, and Storage\n\nWhat to Serve with Pasta Primavera\n\nMore Vegetarian Pasta Recipes\n\nEasy Pasta Primavera Recipe Recipe\n\nPasta Primavera Ingredients\n\nPasta primavera comes from the Italian word for “spring.” Traditionally, the Italian-American dish was used to make the most of a garden bursting with spring veggies. But I love it year-round with whatever seasonal vegetables I have on hand. Feel free to substitute with what you have on hand and what is in season.\n\nFresh veggies: Zucchini, yellow squash, carrots, bell peppers, red onion, and grape tomatoes.\n\nFlavor-makers: Garlic, dried oregano, fresh thyme, salt, and pepper, and fresh lemon zest.\n\nPasta: A short pasta is best for making sure everything is bite-sized. I used farfalle, but rigatoni or any short pasta you like would also work well.\n\nOil: Use a full flavor yet smooth extra virgin olive oil. I love our buttery Italian Nocellara.\n\nParmesan: Adds a savory-salty-nutty quality. Feel free to skip this part if you’d like a vegan or dairy-free primavera.\n\nHow to Make Pasta Primavera\n\nTo make this pasta primavera recipe, grab a pot, sheet pan, knife, grater, peeler, cutting board, and a bowl.\n\nGet ready. Preheat your oven to 450°F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then season generously with kosher salt.\n\nWhile your oven heats, grab a large bowl to add the prepared veggies as you go. Slice the zucchini, yellow squash, and onion into half moons. Peel and cut the carrots into short sticks. Slice the bell peppers into strips. Mince the garlic.\n\nSeason the vegetables. Add 1 tablespoon of dried oregano and 1 1/2 teaspoons of fresh thyme leaves. Season with a big pinch of kosher salt and black pepper. Drizzle enough extra virgin olive oil to coat the veggies (about 3 tablespoons). Toss to coat.\n\nRoast the veggies. Spread the vegetables on a large sheet pan so they’re in one layer. (You may need to use two pans.) Roast on the middle rack for 10 minutes. Give them a good stir, spread them out again, and continue to roast until they’re tender and starting to brown at the edges, about 10 minutes more.\n\nBoil the pasta. While the vegetables roast, cook the pasta according to the package (about 10 to 12 minutes). Reserve one cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain. Halve the grape tomatoes and zest the lemon. Grate the parmesan.\n\nFinish the pasta. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl. Add the roast vegetables, tomatoes, and lemon zest. Add a splash of the pasta cooking water and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If you’d like, add a sprinkle more of oregano and fresh thyme.\n\nServe. Divide among shallow serving bowls and sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.\n\nGetting Ahead, Leftovers, and Storage\n\nTo get ahead on your pasta primavera, chop all of the vegetables the night before. Add them to a large bowl, cover, and store them in your refrigerator. Simply add the oils and seasonings and roast the next day.\n\nIf you have leftovers, allow them to cool completely. Store, covered in your refrigerator, for up to 4 days. To reheat, add the pasta primavera to a saucepan on medium heat on the stovetop. Add a small amount of water and cook until warmed through. Or, serve at room temperature pasta salad-style. You can even dress it up a little with fresh greens like arugula or spinach, a big squeeze of lemon, and a drizzle of olive oil.\n\nWhat to Serve with Pasta Primavera\n\nThis pasta primavera recipe is satisfying and nutritious enough to stand alone. You can happily stop there, but if you’d like extra protein, try our grilled garlic-parmesan shrimp or grilled chicken breast.\n\nA crunchy side salad also goes well with the silky roast vegetables. Try lemon parmesan lettuce salad or panzanella to keep the Italian flavor party going.\n\nMore Vegetarian Pasta Recipes\n\nBrowse all Mediterranean Recipes\n\nVisit Our Shop\n\n4.84 from 135 votes\n\nEasy Pasta Primavera Recipe\n\nSuzy Karadsheh\n\nThis pasta primavera recipe features a light, lemony sauce (no cream!) and a medley of fresh vegetables.
