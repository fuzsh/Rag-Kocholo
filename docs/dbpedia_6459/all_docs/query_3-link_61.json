        "text": "What initially inspired your study of this language?\n\nI wanted to study Russian because I love Russian history and literature.\n\nWhat was a fun or unique experience you had at the U related to your language program?\n\nI was able to study abroad in Kyrgyzstan last summer and it was one of the best experiences of my life. I never thought I would ever go to Central Asia and I never expected Russian to take me there!\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans? Short-term and/or long-term?\n\nGood question! I don't know. So far I'm planning on staying in Utah to keep working for the Utah Historical Society but we will see...\n\nWhat words of inspiration or advice do you have for students still at the U studying in your language program?\n\nStudy those verbs and read Russian literature.\n\nWhat initially inspired your study of this language?\n\nI have always wanted to learn a second language, and Korea's phonetic alphabet and culture made me want to learn the language.\n\nWhat was a fun or unique experience you had at the U related to your language program?\n\nOnce I got into third year Korean, there were always fewer than ten people in the class. That meant that I got to spend a lot of time inside and outside of class really getting to know my classmates and professors. Because of those relationships, I felt relaxed enough in my language classes to have fun, make jokes, and be creative with my final projects. I also always felt like I had a support group that I could turn to when I needed help. The small class sizes have really made my time at the U amazing.\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans? Short-term and/or long-term?\n\nI'm planning on applying to grad school later this year to get a master's degree in genetic counseling. I eventually want to research genetic disorders and gene therapies, and I would love to collaborate with researchers from other countries, or conduct research in other countries, especially Korea.\n\nWhat words of inspiration or advice do you have for students still at the U studying in your language program?\n\nDon't be too afraid to talk to the other students in your class. They're probably feeling the same thing that you are about learning a new language, and they may end up being some of your best friends. I wish that I hadn't been so timid in my beginning Korean classes. I can also promise you that you will not regret dedicating so much time to a language. Learning Korean has been incredibly rewarding and has given me more opportunities and friendships than I can explain here\n\nWhat initially inspired your study of this language?\n\nI initially began my Russian studies after living in Lithuania and being exposed to Russian communities there. I always wanted to be able to read Russian literature and I became very interested in the history of Eastern Europe. Studying Arabic started out as a pandemic hobby and intellectual pursuit to help me focus on something while everything around us seemed to be in flux, and ended up becoming an integral of my humanities studies over time.\n\nWhat was a fun or unique experience you had at the U related to your language program?\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the WLC program was my study abroad program in Egypt. I was able to travel around the Middle East and see so many new and beautiful places. I was able to learn a lot about Islam and practice my Arabic, and my experiences from that summer are some of my most cherished.\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans? Short-term and/or long-term?\n\nI will stay at the U to finish my Master's program in Biomedical Engineering, continuing my research in immunotherapy and novel treatments for leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. After I complete my graduate degree, I plan to continue working in immunological research and development, with a focus on translational medicine. Additionally, I hope to be able to use my foreign language experience to work with international teams in localizing and distribution novel therapies to help increase treatment options for patients across the world.\n\nWhat words of inspiration or advice do you have for students still at the U studying in your language program?\n\nThere are so many opportunities for speaking your language, and they will present themselves in the most unexpected places and times. Trust yourself and be confident - you know more than think you do. These opportunities lead to new friendships and new experiences, and being able to connect with someone else in their native language may make all the difference in their sense of community, belonging, and appreciation.\n\nWhat initially inspired your study of this language?\n\nWhile serving a mission in Paraguay, I was introduced to several languages. After spending the bulk of my time learning Spanish and a bit of Guarani, I was sent to Saltos Del Guairá - a city on the border with Brazil. I spent my final 8 months there, and in that time fell in love with the sound of Portuguese. I really tried to practice and pick apart the language daily while there, since everybody spoke Portuguese in that town. Upon returning home, I was lucky enough to discover the FLAS scholarship, which gave me the resources and time to formally study a language and culture I came to love so much.\n\nWhat was a fun or unique experience you had at the U related to your language program?\n\nSo many things I could mention here - Medical Portuguese, a Study Abroad in Brazil, even lifelong friends I've made in my classes. However, the one that stands out the most is my C.E.L. projects with Anna Hodgson. Through them I began interpreting (in both Spanish and Portuguese) for Maliheh Clinic. This decision not only opened a lot of doors in my life, but helped me find a way to use my language skills in a beneficial and emotionally rewarding way for those in need. I have spent many personal moments with patients and family members as doctors discussed cancer, diabetes, glaucomas, pregnancies, and more. I became a conduit for speech, and in the process learned a lot about clear communication in the medical field and built empathy for patients as attempted to transmit their worried, anxious, and yet still hopeful thoughts. As a future doctor, these experiences are some of my crowning memories upon which I will build my character.\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans? Short-term and/or long-term?\n\nRecently, I was accepted into the University of Utah's medical school, where I plan to start this fall. My wife and I will also likely attend a study abroad in Portugal over the summer, for which we are very excited. Beyond that, I hope to explore and find a medical career where I can regularly use my language skills and make a difference in peoples lives. I have never felt like one who wants to tackle the bigger issues in society. Instead, I want to focus on the issues at hand, and devote my efforts to the needs of those around me. My community, my family, and especially my wife. I say this, because I want to emphasize that my philosophy will be to make an impact on the lives of patients I see. That is something I know I can work towards, and it starts by using the knowledge and experience gained from my WLC major. Who knows? Maybe a positive influence can spread to others around me, and perhaps that will have a greater impact on the larger picture than anything else I could have done.\n\nWhat words of inspiration or advice do you have for students still at the U studying in your language program?\n\nYou have no idea how many opportunities there are around you, especially with the resources available at the U. Seek them out, ask around, and take advantage of as many of them as you can. I promise they will take you places you could have never predicted.\n\nWhat initially inspired your study of this language?\n\nI took Latin on a whim when I first transferred to the University of Utah, and it was because of the incredible Professors in the Classics department that I decided to pursue a degree in Latin. I was additionally inspired through my studies in the Classics to expand my research interests and take on a second major in German. While the professors in both departments passion made me excited to learn all I could about both languages respectively, it was my study of these languages themselves that made me fall in love with them. Interacting with ancient Latin texts and modern German people are experiences that will remain with me forever.\n\nWhat was a fun or unique experience you had at the U related to your Religious Studies program?\n\nMy favorite memories of my time at the U are also some of my first. Within the midst of the pandemic, all classes were moved online, and my first semester seemed to be thrown into disarray. I won’t lie, I was quite discouraged. Online learning was a necessary transition, but an unwanted one. Yet, despite all of the obstacles, my Latin 1010 professor, Dr. Margaret Toscano, arranged for us to meet on campus once a week in a big auditorium so that we could take exams together and have some time to collaborate in person. These days were often disrupted by storms and sickness, but they helped cement in me not just a deep love and appreciation of the Latin language, but also a love of being at the University and experiencing life on campus. Without Latin, Professor Toscano, and the WLC department writ large my college expirience would have likely been vastly different and substantially less memorable.\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans? Short-term and/or long-term?\n\nI have won and accepted a Fulbright Scholarship to Berlin, Germany which will begin in 2024 and extend into 2025. Following this, I will attend graduate school in pursuit of an advanced degree in Latin. After I complete graduate school, I want to teach Latin at the secondary level.\n\nWhat words of inspiration or advice do you have for students still at the U studying in your language program?\n\nSometimes the work we do in the humanities can be written off as wasteful decadence, but it is important to remember, that while the translational work we do and languages we study can get \"lost in translation\" the work we do must not because it matters. Language and communication is the basis of what makes us human and to study another language is to open your mind to a new way of thinking and imagining the world entire. Learning languages is hard work and requires a lot of patience, but when one truly dedicates themselves to learning a new language, they learn not just how to speak to others, but also how to relate to the world and its people in an entirely new way.\n\nWhat initially inspired your study of this language?\n\nGrowing up I’ve had this dream of traveling to Italy and learning their culture and way of life. I became very interested in studying the language in hopes to one day visit Italy, and be able to experience the culture and learn of the many things that Italy has to offer.\n\nWhat was a fun or unique experience you had at the U related to your Religious Studies program?\n\nWhile I took my first semester of Italian classes at the U, the professor’s passion for teaching and getting student involved with the culture and language was incredible it encouraged me to participate in the Intensive Italian Language Program in Verona. It was one of the best experiences I've had while attending the university. Being able to fully immerse myself into Italian culture and be around peers who share the same interest made the experience comforting and overall amazing. I got to create friendships while aboard and memories that will last forever, I am so grateful I was able to experience that. I was able to practice my Italian with locals as well as peers. I was able to travel and learn about other cities in Italy that made the dreams of traveling to Italy so real. Being able to experience this has created a love for the Italian culture and language it has inspired me to share the same passion my professor showed me to others around me and to eventually return to Italy and experience new memories. I would have not found this love for the language and culture if it weren’t for my professor and if it weren’t for the study abroad program.\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans? Short-term and/or long-term?\n\nI am preparing to attend nursing school spring 2025.\n\nWhat words of inspiration or advice do you have for students still at the U studying in your language program?\n\nIf you have the opportunity to experience a summer aboard, you should do it! It will be one of the best things you ever do, you will learn the language and culture in a whole other way.\n\nWhat initially inspired your study of this language?\n\nWhen I was in elementary school I watched my older brother take Spanish classes as a high schooler. He excelled at the language and made meaningful connections with Spanish speaking friends and co-workers as a result. I decided from a young age that I wanted to become fluent in Spanish because I wanted to be like him. Thank you Brady for introducing me to something I've grown to love so much.\n\nWhat was a fun or unique experience you had at the U related to your language program?\n\nI spent my fall semester of 2022 studying in Cusco, Peru and it changed everything. I quickly became enamored with the people, food, landscape and culture. I watched my ideological and religious beliefs shift as I became friends with people from different parts of the world, and loved feeling stretched and challenged in such a beautiful place. Upon returning home, I decided to switch my Spanish minor to a major and vowed to return to Peru to live in the Sacred Valley. I can't get enough of it.\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans? Short-term and/or long-term?\n\nI will be solo backpacking through Europe for two months this summer! In May I fly to Barcelona to begin the famous Camino de Santiago trek. After spending a few weeks wandering through the beautiful Spanish countryside on the Camino Primitivo, I will make my way to Switzerland and Italy to hike and climb. After a month at home I will fly to South America for an extended solo trip for the remainder of the year :) I plan to spend the rest of my life exploring as a travel adventure journalist.\n\nWhat words of inspiration or advice do you have for students still at the U studying in your language program?\n\nYou're better at the language than you think. It's easy to doubt your competence when you're learning a second language, but trust yourself enough to keep speaking even if you don't know how to express yourself perfectly. Use the mistakes you'll inevitably make as momentum to keep practicing. Don't forget to take time to step back and acknowledge your progress. You've come a long way since you started!\n\nWhat initially inspired your study of this language?\n\nI have always been fascinated by languages and cultures from around the world. I learned German in high school and had dabbled in a few other languages. I finally chose to study in the Chinese program at the University of Utah after meeting many wonderful people from mainland China and Taiwan while serving as a missionary in northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., which is an incredibly diverse area. I also met people from many other cultures who spoke many different languages, but I had a particularly strong desire to deepen my knowledge about the rich and amazing Chinese culture that I encountered through the people I met.\n\nWhat was a fun or unique experience you had at the U related to your language program?\n\nIn the Fall 2023 semester, during my senior year, I had the opportunity to fill in as a Learning Assistant for third-year Chinese students for five weeks. This was a fun and invaluable experience, and it was meaningful to me because I was able to get to know more of my fellow students and help them practice and improve their Chinese. Explaining the grammar concepts and vocabulary also strengthened my own knowledge, and so it was an enjoyable and instructive experience.\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans? Short-term and/or long-term?\n\nAfter graduation, I would definitely like to use Chinese in my future career. I am considering applying for a Master’s program and becoming a teacher, but there are many other possible pathways. No matter what my future career ends up being, I plan to make Chinese a part of the rest of my life.\n\nWhat words of inspiration or advice do you have for students still at the U studying in your language program?\n\nMy advice for students of Chinese is to make the language part of your daily life. Classroom instruction is important for building a strong foundation and receiving the instructor’s feedback, but in my experience, confidence and fluency in a language mainly come through using it outside the classroom. Mandarin Chinese is not the easiest language to learn, but it is doable! It just takes time. Integrating the language into your hobbies and other aspects of your life will not only increase your language study time but, more importantly, it will make learning a lot more enjoyable and expose you to a greater variety of topics and situations. Just be sure to start slow to avoid overwhelming yourself. You should push yourself a little out of your comfort zone, but not too much or too fast, especially in the beginning stages. You can increase the amount of input over time as your abilities grow.\n\nFind some Chinese artists or bands you like. Watch videos or listen to podcasts about your favorite topics in Chinese. Change the language of your game to Chinese, if it is an option, or try some new games. If you like reading, you can start with graded readers or children’s stories and work up to higher-level content. Use the clip reader and other features on Pleco (purchasing the basic bundle of add-ons is worth it). Try going to a Chinese supermarket and converse with the employees or customers there. Try following some Chinese recipes. Make some Chinese friends, find a language exchange partner online or on campus, or hire a tutor if you want. Many Chinese native speakers are looking to practice English and would be happy to help you with your language as well. Of course, there are many other methods of learning too. Be creative and find what works for you.\n\nFinally, avoid comparing yourself to others. Keep in mind that everyone has different backgrounds, strengths, and learning styles. Only compare your progress and current abilities with your past self so you can see how far you have come. With enough time and work, you are all capable of reaching your desired proficiency and accomplishing amazing things. 加油！"
