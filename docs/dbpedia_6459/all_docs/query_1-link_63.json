        "text": "During the First World War, on 24 April, 1916, Irish republicans seized notable buildings in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic in what became known as the Easter Rising. The British Army clashed with rebels in the streets of Dublin and buildings in the city centre, including the General Post Office, were all but destroyed by British artillery. Within a week, the uprising had been quashed. More than 2,000 people, including civilians, were killed or wounded.\n\nThe British response to the uprising, which included the execution of 15 of its leaders and a protracted period of martial law, fueled support for the republican cause in Ireland.\n\nIn 1919, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) launched a guerrilla campaign against the British Army and loyalist forces. After more than two years of conflict, in May 1921, the Government of Ireland Act was passed, which divided Ireland in two. A ceasefire followed in July. The Act brought together 6 counties to form the self-governing region of Northern Ireland, whose population was majority loyalist and Protestant.\n\nThe Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 brought the Irish War of Independence formally to a close. The treaty also provided for the establishment of the Irish Free State in southern Ireland. The Irish Free State was to exist as a dominion within the British Empire but this changed in 1949, when Eire officially became a Republic.\n\nThe Catholic population often found itself at greater disadvantage economically and politically that the Protestant community. However, social and economic conditions were often very similar for working class Protestants.\n\nTensions spilled over in August 1969 during the annual Apprentice Boys of Derry march. The route of the march passed through the predominantly Catholic Bogside area of Derry. Attempts by the Royal Ulster Constabulary to separate residents from the marchers resulted in three days of rioting. The event became known as the Battle of Bogside and it caused unrest across Northern Ireland. The British Army was brought in to restore order.\n\nAbout 15,000 people gathered in Derry on 30 January 1972 to participate in a march against the policy of internment without trial that had been in Northern Ireland. The march was banned and the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment was deployed to prevent it from completing its route. The march was diverted but some groups of marchers clashed with soldiers at a barricade and were fired on with rubber bullets and teargas. The soldiers moved out from the barricade to make arrests and opened fire on the marchers with live rounds. Fourteen people were killed â€“ 13 on the day with John Johnston dying in June from his injuries.\n\nThe latter half of the 1970s and the 1980s were characterised by assassinations and acts of terrorism carried out by loyalist and republican paramilitary groups.\n\nLoyalist action was focussed largely in Ireland. The Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association carried out shootings of Catholic civilians and bombed bars and pubs in Belfast. The Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974, in which three car bombs were detonated in Dublin and one in Monaghan, killed 33 civilians - the largest death toll of any single action of The Troubles. The UVF did not admit responsibility for the act until 1993.\n\nThe Provisional IRA also carried out the majority of their attacks in Northern Ireland. In 1972, 9 people were killed in a series of bombings in Belfast. The attacks were carried out in response to Bloody Sunday and became known as Bloody Friday. The Provisional IRA also carried out several high profile attacks in England. The Birmingham pub bombings in 1974 killed 21 civilians, the highest death toll in England during The Troubles. Targets included London department stores such as Selfridges and Harrods, as well as public buildings including the Old Bailey (1973) and the Houses of Parliament (1974). In 1982, 11 soldiers and 7 horses were killed when bombs were detonated in Hyde Park, during the Changing of the Guard, and Regents Park during a concert. In 1984, a bomb at the Grand Hotel in Brighton targeted the Conservative Party Conference, killing five people.\n\nOne of the most high-profile victims of IRA attacks was Lord Louis Mountbatten, a cousin of the Queen. In August 1979, Mountbatten was among those killed in County Sligo, Ireland when a bomb was placed on his fishing boat.\n\nDespite ongoing violence, by the early 1990s negotiations had begun between political parties in Northern Ireland and between the British and Irish governments. The Downing Street Declaration of 1993 was signed by Prime Minister John Major and Taoiseach Albert Reynolds. The declaration set out key principles, including that any unification of Ireland could only take place with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, and that only Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland had the right to solve their disputes. The declaration was approved by the Republican party Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA.\n\nBy 1997, both the Provisional IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries had called ceasefires and the majority of the main parties in Northern Ireland were at the negotiating table.\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was signed on 10 April, 1998. It was the culmination of talks between unionist parties, the political wings of both the UVF and UDA, Sinn Fein and the British Government. The agreement created a plan for a power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly and outlined plans for future relationships between Ireland and Britain. It was approved the following month by a referendum in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Elections took place in June and it formally took power in December 1999.\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement can be viewed as marking the end of The Troubles."
