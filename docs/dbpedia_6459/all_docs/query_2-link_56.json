Certain people who went to Yale in 1952 wore them, as did a few diehard traditionalists, but that was about it.''\n\nThe bareheaded 1960's and 70's may well be remembered, in fact, as the\n\nonly\n\nperiod during which hats were not a regular part of male attire. Ever since the first bunch of leaves was rudely plopped upon some primitive pate to shield it from the elements, hats, in one form or another, have been in constant demand. Now that they are emerging from their temporary eclipse, it is likely that many men will be wearing them for the first time since they struggled with flaps, straps and snaps in grade school.\n\nBerinsky, whose factory and shop at 30 West 39th Street is a mecca to hat fanciers throughout the world, counsels the neophyte to seek some good advice before buying that first hat: ''The best authority is a knowledgeable salesman, preferably one who doesn't talk to you as if he were about to sell you a used car. If you hear, 'I'm going to put you into a great hat,' don't be shy - walk out.'' A good hat salesman, according to Berinsky, should ask the customer about himself: Is the suit he is wearing typical of his wardrobe? What are his favorite colors? What is his preferred cut of coat and width of lapel. Then, he should consider the customer's build - his height and weight, the shape of his face - and go from there. Generally, styles with narrower brims tend to compliment thinner faces, while portlier faces are minimized by wider brims.\n\nMost hats now available are versions of standard 19th- and early-20th-century designs, from the black topper to the porkpie. The most versatile hat for city and country wear is the fedora, named after Victorien Sardou's once-popular melodrama, which he wrote for Sarah Bernhardt in 1882. Early fedoras were low, soft felt hats with a tapered crown, creased lengthwise, and a permanently rolled brim, but modern ones have a medium-width flat brim, two-and-five-eighths-inches wide, that can be shaped to the wearer's taste.\n\nOne version of the fedora is the trilby, named after the heroine of George du Maurier's 1894 novel. Originally very similar to the homburg, the trilby evolved during the 1920's into a soft English country hat with a creased tapered crown worn with a front pinch, a streamlined brim (Jay Lord's is two-and-a-quarter- inches wide) and a half-inch grosgrain band or ribbon. The edge of the brim is usually left raw, but it can be bound with matching grosgrain.\n\nA third soft felt style, beloved of race-track touts, is the porkpie, which gets its name from the characteristic groove around the flattened top of the crown, lending it the appearance of that hearty old English pastry. Porkpies are usually worn with a snap brim - down in front, up in back. Most men wear soft felt hats this way, but for a little more panache, wider-brimmed fedoras and trilbies can be worn with the brim down all around, a la F. Scott Fitzgerald, or in the somewhat operatic manner with the brim down on one side. Incidentally, the term ''Borsalino,'' frequently applied to any wide- brimmed felt, ought not to be used indiscriminantly. It refers, in fact, only to the products of Borsalino Giuseppe e Fratello of Alessandria, Italy, a company that has been making some of the world's most luxurious felt and straw hats since the 1850's.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
