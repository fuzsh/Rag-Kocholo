        "text": "I'm in Philly to find the absolute best cheesesteak.\n\nI'm Elazar the restaurant editor at Bon Appetit\n\nand I eat at restaurants for a living.\n\nI'm about to try 19 different cheesesteaks in a single day,\n\nall of them recommended by locals, best-of lists\n\nand a lot of online forums.\n\nThen tomorrow I'll revisit my top picks\n\nto crown the absolute best one.\n\nWe are at Pat's, the originator of the cheesesteak.\n\nSuper classic cheesesteak.\n\nJust okay. Bread is really dry.\n\nI'm at Geno's. It's a bit of a mystery.\n\nCan't really see any Whiz.\n\nIt's kind of just giving beef.\n\nThe cheese isn't really like super\n\nincorporated and the meat's a little dry.\n\nTo keep things standardized,\n\nI'm ordering every cheesesteak with onions and Cheez Whiz.\n\nIf Whiz isn't an option, I'll order American cheese instead.\n\n[Elazar crowing]\n\nTony and Nick's, absolutely decked out with cheese,\n\njuicy, flavorful.\n\nIt's really good.\n\nI'm at John's Roast Pork.\n\nThe bun is seeded.\n\nThe steak is really nicely charred\n\nand it's working really, really well.\n\nWe're outside Rocco's.\n\nBuilt into the Home Depot parking lot.\n\nI do really like it,\n\nbut it's almost giving me like beef bulgogi.\n\nGooey Looie's told me that they only do real cheese\n\nand that means no Whiz.\n\nThe beef is great, but it's straight beef.\n\nThis is Mike's BBQ\n\nand this is a brisket cheesesteak\n\nwith homemade Cooper Sharp Whiz.\n\nGot that deep, smoky flavor,\n\nso it's definitely something a little bit different.\n\nI like it a lot.\n\nIt's about 12 o'clock.\n\nI've had seven cheesesteaks today.\n\nI would say my body is suffering a little bit by now.\n\nMost of the cheesesteaks are sitting like right here.\n\nI've eaten a lot of beef.\n\nI waited 30 minutes outside of Angelo's\n\nfor this cheesesteak.\n\nIt seemed like all of Philly is here.\n\nThe onions are really, really well caramelized.\n\nI haven't seen that on any of the other cheesesteaks.\n\nAmazing across the board.\n\nOutside Lorenzo's Pizza.\n\nIt looks great. It's got a ton of cheese.\n\nThe meat is nicely chopped.\n\nI wish there was more cheese.\n\nLube it all up, but it's really nice.\n\nI'm next door to Woodrow's.\n\nRead to you from the receipt.\n\nAll caps. Our truffle whiz is not from a can.\n\nThe truffle is strong.\n\nThis is Jim's.\n\nThis is Jim's cheesesteak just submerged in Whiz\n\nall around the perimeter.\n\nThe meat looks super juicy.\n\nBread for me is reading just like a tiny bit dry,\n\nbut overall it was really, really juicy.\n\nIshkabibble's one.\n\nI'm learning, I think I like a really juicy,\n\noverloaded cheesesteak.\n\nThe ratios on this one look really nice to me.\n\nThe bread actually holds up to sort\n\nof keep all that juice in.\n\nI think this is a really good cheesesteak.\n\nWe're having a late roadside lunch at Cleavers.\n\nIt's a really nice looking sandwich.\n\nThe bread is really nice and pillowy.\n\nI'm getting a bit of a bite that's really juicy right here\n\nand then it's just kind of straight bread.\n\nAcross the street from Taste,\n\nthere's a neon sign that reads, Do you want to taste me?\n\nAnd I do.\n\nThe meat is cut pretty fine. It's good.\n\nIt's like a really moist, classic,\n\ntotally satisfying cheesesteak.\n\nThis is Sonny's Famous Cheesesteaks and Burgers.\n\nThe onions, they're long, they're not chopped very finely.\n\nLittle bit unusual in contrast with\n\nwhat else I've tried today.\n\nThey're good, but I wish they were throughout the sandwich.\n\nYou know, I think a lot of people think that,\n\nOh, just eating all day, it's so easy.\n\nIt's not really a job.\n\nAnd you're right,\n\nbut it still causes serious pain to the body.\n\nI'm at Campo's and these onions are cut\n\ninto pretty long strips.\n\nThis one's fine.\n\nI'm at Steve's Prince of Steaks.\n\nThe meat, sliced as opposed to shredded or chopped.\n\nSo it's these like long slices.\n\nI don't think I love this one.\n\nThis is cheesesteak number 18.\n\nJust went into Cafe Carmela,\n\nwhich is mostly seemingly a sit-down restaurant.\n\nWhoa, that is a good looking cheesesteak.\n\nSuper flavorful, super moist.\n\n[indistinct] day of cheese steaks in Philly\n\nwould not be complete without a trip to Dalessandro's,\n\nbut I was convinced by the owners to do provolone\n\nand American.\n\nThe sharpness of the cheese does something really\n\ndifferent than the Whiz.\n\nThe flavor's like way deeper.\n\nAnd that was my final cheesesteak.\n\n19 in a single day.\n\nI truly did not think it was possible.\n\nI'm not even sure how we crammed them all in, but we did it.\n\nI had a ton of great sandwiches today,\n\nbut four stood out as deserving of another try.\n\nAngelo's, Cafe Carmela,\n\nJohn's Roast Pork, and Tony and Nick's.\n\nTomorrow I'm going to head back to analyze every part\n\nof those four cheesesteaks\n\nand decide which is the best in Philly.\n\n[groovy music]\n\nWe are back at Angelo's today.\n\nTechnically we are above the restaurant.\n\nThere is nowhere to sit down there\n\nand there is a line around the block.\n\nSo they're letting us basically hang out\n\nin their living room.\n\nEven though I woke up with heartburn,\n\nindigestion, mildly concerning headache,\n\nI was still thinking about eating this sandwich yesterday.\n\nIt really just does sort of stick in your mind.\n\nOh my god, that is such a good sandwich.\n\nIt's the bread.\n\nIt's got like a real crispness.\n\nIt doesn't quite have like a crust that you can feel\n\nbut in the mouth it like still gives you\n\nsomething kinda sturdy.\n\nIt doesn't feel soggy at all.\n\nAgain, I don't really know how that's possible.\n\nI mean it's, you can see it's totally saturated.\n\nA lot of cheesesteaks are made with bread from just one\n\nor two really prolific,\n\nrespected bakeries throughout the city and they're good.\n\nThey make a really, really solid crusty piece of bread,\n\nbut their bread oven is taking up a full back wall\n\nof the restaurant.\n\nSo this is something that they clearly are taking\n\nsuper seriously.\n\nThe beef, it's tender, it's thinly sliced,\n\nit's not overcooked.\n\nIt's got a tiny bit of color on it.\n\nOkay, here's the thing about Whiz,\n\nit's kind of weird.\n\nI really like it. I wouldn't order it in any other sandwich.\n\nYou know, there's a lot of other classic cheeses\n\nthat can kind of complete this sandwich.\n\nWith the quality of the bread\n\nand the really well seasoned steak,\n\nthe Whiz is really nice.\n\nIt doesn't just melt and then re-harden.\n\nIt just sauces the whole sandwich and then it stays that way\n\nand I think it really, really works in this sandwich.\n\nWe actually got here before Angelo's opened,\n\nwithin five minutes of pulling up,\n\nthere was a line around the block.\n\nYou should definitely come here,\n\nbut you should come here early\n\nor you should come here prepared to wait.\n\nBut there is something about it that this sandwich just kind\n\nof keeps getting better and better for me.\n\nSo I'm really interested to get a sense for what the rest\n\nof the day's gonna be like.\n\nThis is starting really, really strong.\n\nThis is gonna be a hard sandwich to beat.\n\n[groovy music]\n\nI'm in the dining room at Cafe Carmela right now.\n\nYesterday it was not part of my plan to come here,\n\nbut I was looking through some of the comment boards,\n\ndoing a bit of trolling on Reddit,\n\ntrying to figure out if there was anything that we missed\n\nand I kept noticing this name\n\ncome up again and again and again.\n\nI think the reason we missed it is it's pretty new.\n\nIt opened in 2020.\n\nI feel like you know it's good when the like protective\n\npaper completely soaked through.\n\nYesterday this was cheesesteak number 18\n\nand I think it really says something that even\n\nafter eating that much, it was still that good.\n\nOh my God. You see the drip?\n\nMy favorite thing about this steak, the Whiz,\n\nthey make their own cheese sauce here, tried to get them\n\nto tell me what's in it,\n\nbut it is definitely a house secret.\n\nSo I cannot tell you too much about the contents,\n\nbut it is really, really delicious.\n\nA little more complex than Whiz. Shocker.\n\nWe actually got a little extra.\n\nIt's still got the sweetness.\n\nIt's still salty, but you can actually taste cheese,\n\nfor one.\n\nIt's a little bit sharp.\n\nI wouldn't describe it as like aged.\n\nIt's not funky at all. It just has a lot of flavor.\n\nJust to open it up a little bit,\n\nthe whole sandwich is soaked through with that cheese.\n\nThe bread is coming from a local bakery called Carangi's.\n\nIt's a seeded loaf. I'm really liking seeded loaf.\n\nIt's just that extra little bit of sort\n\nof like nutty flavor from the seeds.\n\nI was talking to the mother-in-law of the owner\n\nand she was explaining they mix the cheese sauce\n\nwith the meat on the grill.\n\nThat's part of why the sandwich feels so well combined\n\nand it almost feels like the meat and the onion\n\nand the cheese are like one cohesive element.\n\nIt's really getting like almost emulsified on the flat top.\n\nThat's really working for me.\n\nSo I think that's an awesome technique.\n\nMeat itself, ribeye, not super finely chopped.\n\nYou're getting little sort of shreddy pieces\n\nbut you're still getting enough to kind of chew through it.\n\nThe onions are nice.\n\nI like that they're there.\n\nI think I wish that they were cut up a bit more finely\n\nso that they were kind of soaking through the sandwich\n\ninstead of just being dotted around.\n\nBefore we started filming, I was talking to a customer,\n\nhe's from Philly and it actually has become his favorite\n\ncheesesteak in the city.\n\nAnd I think that speaks volumes in a city like Philly\n\nwhere a cheesesteak is really like legacy.\n\nIt's really history.\n\nI don't think that you get a ton\n\nof new cheesesteaks that contend for best-in-the-city.\n\nThat just doesn't happen that often.\n\nTwo down, two to go.\n\n[groovy music]\n\nI'm outside at John's Roast Pork.\n\nI mean come on.\n\nIt is a thing of beauty.\n\nExtremely heavy, absolutely packed with meat.\n\nIt's really, really generous.\n\nThinly sliced, chopped a little bit but not shredded up.\n\nThe bread is really holding up\n\ndespite being totally soaked with juice.\n\nThere's cheese all throughout.\n\nWe got white American cheese on this one.\n\nThe bread on this cheesesteak might be familiar,\n\nsame as one of the other four\n\nthat we're trying today, comes from Carangi's.\n\nHolds up really nicely to a cheesesteak like this,\n\nwhich just has so much going on inside of it.\n\nOh my God.\n\nIt's all about the steak.\n\nThe bread is good and the cheese is flavorful,\n\nbut there's so much meat.\n\nIt is so moist that that is what you taste.\n\nLike that is exactly where your brain goes.\n\nIt's just cooked so well.\n\nLayer of onions, layer of oil to get everything starting\n\nto caramelize and then the meat goes down.\n\nYou get beautiful color on the onions.\n\nReally, really nice caramelization and sear on the meat.\n\nAnd that for me is what really, really stood out\n\nyesterday when we came here the first time.\n\nI don't know if you can see,\n\nbut the steak is really peppery.\n\nThis is the first cheesesteak I've had\n\nwhere it actually leaves like a little bit\n\nof heat in the back of your throat.\n\nIt's really nice.\n\nSo the meat here is just kind of in between texture.\n\nIt gets a little bit of cook on both sides\n\nbefore those line cooks start chopping it up.\n\nAnd so it's kind of holding together in these smaller\n\nbits in the mouth.\n\nThat just means chewy.\n\nIt doesn't melt away right away,\n\nbut it's small enough that it's still just like\n\none bite after the other.\n\nKind of my ideal texture for the steak on a cheesesteak.\n\nReally interesting thing I picked up yesterday\n\nwas that the steak is so flavorful,\n\nI almost thought there were like mushrooms in the mix.\n\nThere weren't. It was just onions.\n\nThe way they cooked the meat with the onions,\n\nletting it really char and caramelize,\n\nit just gives it this amazing flavor.\n\nIt's the same ingredients as a lot of other cheesesteaks,\n\nbut it just tastes really different.\n\nAnd that is it for John's Roast Pork.\n\n[groovy music]\n\nWe are at Tony and Nick's.\n\nAlmost definitely holds the title of world's best mascot.\n\n[Elazar crowing]\n\nIt's perfect.\n\nIt should really be the flag of Philly.\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nand think about a super traditional cheesesteak,\n\nthis was the one that came to mind.\n\nThe bread is super sturdy, really, really generous\n\nwith the meat and then it has these onions\n\nall the way throughout.\n\nAlso get lots of Whiz, seems pretty nicely proportioned.\n\nThey go heavy on the Whiz here and I'm glad they do\n\n'cause the meat is definitely a little less juicy than some\n\nof the other spots we're hitting today.\n\nIt's okay, but without that Whiz,\n\nI think this would start to dry out a little bit.\n\nI am missing a bit of that juiciness.\n\nSome places buy their bread from a wholesale bakery.\n\nSome places make it themselves in the back of the shop.\n\nWe're falling somewhere in the middle here.\n\nThis is their own recipe\n\nand they're finishing the bread in their own ovens\n\nright back here, but they're sending it off\n\nto get proofed.\n\nAll of that at a wholesale bakery.\n\nTo me that's the most important thing\n\nthat this bread is being baked fresh every day.\n\nI want you to see there's like a quarter\n\nof an onion chopped up in here.\n\nThat's gonna be some people's poison.\n\nI'm an onion lover, so for me this is kind of nice.\n\nIt gives it some sweetness, it balances out that Whiz,\n\nit cuts through a lot of that beef.\n\nBut if you are someone who does not go hard for onions,\n\nthis is gonna overwhelm you.\n\nI'll admit that when we tried this one yesterday,\n\nit was like the second or third cheesesteak of the day.\n\nI was still kind of a cheesesteak baby.\n\nI didn't have the world opened to me yet.\n\nI don't think I was wrong exactly,\n\nbut after trying the other three today\n\nI will say it doesn't hold up quite as much.\n\nIt's leaving my mouth just a little bit dry.\n\nI'm wishing it was a little bit juicier.\n\nSo we live, we learn,\n\nwe salute the bald eagle holding the cheesesteak.\n\nThat is it for the final four.\n\nAfter two straight days of eating,\n\nI think I've finally found the best cheesesteak in Philly.\n\nMy absolute favorite cheesesteak in Philly was Angelo's.\n\nThey're making their own bread.\n\nIt kind of doesn't get better than that\n\nbecause each bite is just so incredibly fresh.\n\nIt absorbs the juices, it balances out the flavor,\n\nit keeps the sandwich feeling really, really sturdy\n\nfor every single bite.\n\nI just really couldn't get over that sandwich.\n\nThe meat was really tender\n\nand really well sliced.\n\nCheese, perfectly coated every single bite.\n\nAnd actually I thought the onions were pretty standout too.\n\nThey were just a little bit caramelized.\n\nSo it gives more sweetness,\n\nbut also just a little bit more depth to every bite.\n\nUltimately though it was the bread.\n\nIf I had an also-perfect award,\n\nI would give it to John's Roast Pork.\n\nI think that that is such an excellent sandwich\n\nand it was truly so standout.\n\nThe only thing putting Angelo's just a tiny bit above\n\nwas that homemade bread.\n\nEverything from the hospitality to the freshness\n\nof the ingredients and the way they cook that steak\n\nat John's is really, really special.\n\nAnd if you have time in a day for two cheesesteaks,\n\nyou've gotta hit 'em both.\n\nOne spot in our top four\n\nthat gets a little bit less shine probably\n\n'cause it's a lot newer, is Cafe Carmela.\n\nI thought that was a really, really good sandwich.\n\nThe homemade cheese is just such a nice touch\n\nand having it robe every single bite of steak\n\nfor me was a really special experience.\n\nWelcome to Philly. Thank you.\n\nPhilly in the Building.\n\nAnything to say about cheesesteaks?\n\nOh yeah, the best cheesesteaks.\n\nYou gotta go to Angelo's.\n\nThere you have it. 7th and Fitzwater.\n\nThere you have it. There you go.\n\nBest cheesesteaks in the city.\n\nWill Skiano told you. You heard.\n\nDo we have a release? Get it, get it.\n\n[Elazar] Do we have a release?\n\n[Cameraman] Are we gonna get like a once over on what Whiz\n\nis during the intro?\n\nWhat the [beep] is Whiz?"
