When we say we are partners in your child’s education we put those words into action by providing a variety of opportunities for you to participate in our classrooms, in our community and in the direction of our school. You will receive information on events in our classrooms, Parish and our School Community Council for you to participate in. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us to share your talents.\n\nAll of our students are given the opportunity to lead in various ways. Each class is in charge of a Mass and students are asked to participate in reading and serving. The classrooms have jobs and responsibilities that require stepping into leadership. Classrooms also have ambassadors that greet visitors or host new students. To learn more click here"
