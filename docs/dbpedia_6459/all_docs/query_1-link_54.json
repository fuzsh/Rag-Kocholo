        "text": "Root canals, crowns, dental implants and replacement dentures for Medicaid recipients who are 21-years-old or older.\n\nCrown lengthening is now covered by Medicaid when it is done as part of a medically necessary crown or root canal procedure. Refer to the section of this FAQ on crowns and root canals to determine when a procedure is considered medically necessary.\n\nIf you haven’t been to the dentist recently, please refer to this resource about how to access Medicaid benefits.\n\nYou can also bring the Guidance document with you to the dentist in case your dentist doesn’t know about the changes.\n\nThe new rules only apply to requests submitted on or after January 31, 2024. You should ask your dentist to resubmit the request so the new rules will apply.\n\nIf you already have an appeal filed for a denial of one of these services that was requested before January 31, 2024, it still may be best to ask your dentist to resubmit the request. But if you prefer, you can still go forward with the appeal. A fair hearing decision may order the Medicaid program to reconsider the request under the new rules. However, it may also affirm the denial under the old rules. An external appeal may overturn the denial or affirm the denial.\n\nSee this resource for more information on Medicaid appeals.\n\nNo. It is important to note that a crown SHOULD NOT be denied solely because you have too many teeth in your mouth. This rule is called the “8 points of contact rule.” It no longer applies to crowns.\n\nA crown will be covered where there are 8 or more points of contact, unless there\n\nis a reason that the tooth needs to be pulled.\n\nIn deciding whether a root canal is medically necessary, the reviewer should consider a list of factors. You do NOT have to meet all of these factors:\n\nYou have a documented medical condition which makes pulling the tooth not possible or dangerous.\n\nThe root canal is needed to hold a denture in place.\n\nIf the tooth is a front tooth (teeth # 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,27), the following additional factors will make it more likely that the root canal would be covered:\n\nThe health of your gums and jaw bones surrounding the teeth is good.\n\nYou follow your dentist’s instructions on how to care for your teeth.\n\nThe problem can’t be fixed with a filling.\n\nThere is a good chance that the tooth can be saved.\n\nIf the tooth is a back tooth (teeth # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31,32), the following additional factors will make it more likely that the root canal would be covered:\n\nThe health of your gums and jaw bones surrounding the teeth is good overall.\n\nYou have followed your dentist’s instructions on how to care for your teeth.\n\nThere is a good chance that the tooth can be saved.\n\nYou have four pairs of back teeth that touch when you bite down.\n\nIf the back tooth is a molar (teeth #1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,19, 30, 31, 32), a root canal is necessary to maintain a functional or balanced bite.\n\nA root canal on a wisdom tooth (teeth# 1, 16, 32, 17) may be covered if the tooth has moved in to the first or second molar position.\n\nNo. It is important to note that a root canal SHOULD NOT be denied solely because you have too many teeth in your mouth. This rule is called the “8 points of contact rule.” It no longer applies to root canals.\n\nA root canal will be covered where there are 8 or more points of contact, unless there is a reason that the tooth needs to be pulled.\n\nIf you already had your dentures replaced once in the past 8 years and you need another replacement, your dentist needs to fill out this form explaining why you need replacement dentures and explaining the efforts taken to prevent the need for future replacements.\n\nIn deciding whether a dental implant is medically necessary, the reviewer will consider the complete treatment plan and this form submitted by your dentist that includes:\n\nYour medical history\n\nCurrent medical conditions\n\nCurrent medications\n\nAn explanation for why you can’t wear dentures\n\nAny explanation of why you need implants\n\nMedicaid will review the explanation of why you can’t wear dentures based on how many and which teeth you’re missing. This is because the rules for Medicaid coverage for your first set of dentures have not changed. Medicaid will cover dentures if you do not have 4 sets of top and bottom teeth in the back of your mouth that touch, or if you are missing one tooth on the top or two front teeth on the bottom.\n\nIf your request is for a root canal, crown, replacement dentures, or dental implants and the denial says it is not a covered benefit, this notice is wrong.\n\nContact the Department of Health to complain about this notice from the plan.\n\nPhone: 800-206-8125\n\nEmail: managedcarecomplaint@health.ny.gov\n\nMail:NYS Department of Health, Managed Care Complaint Unit, OHIP DHPCO 1CP-1609, Albany, NY 12237\n\nThis contact information can be found here.\n\nThe plan should send another notice. The new notice may still be a denial, but it can’t be denied because the services is not a covered a benefit.\n\nYou must file your appeal within the deadlines."
