        "text": "He had to feel the popular enthusiasm up close, first-hand if possible, and share a little of the Olympic effervescence with the French people. On Friday, August 2, a week after having declared the \"33rd Olympics of the modern era\" to be open, with a voice fraught with the stress of a potential security breach, Emmanuel Macron came out of his Mediterranean getaway at the Fort de Brégançon to applaud the French athletes.\n\nThe presidential Falcon landed in the Paris region at around noon, enabling the president to reach Versailles, where the equestrian events were taking place, a little later. In the château's gardens, the president greeted the French show jumping team (bronze medalists), then made his way to the Eiffel Tower to watch some beach volleyball, before heading to the tatami mats, where the judokas Romane Dicko (bronze) and Teddy Riner (gold) were competing.\n\nEnchanting images. French pride. Presidential elation. These scenes were repeated throughout a legendary afternoon in which Florent Manaudou (bronze) and Léon Marchand (gold) shone in the swimming events, and Joris Daudet, Sylvain André and Romain Mahieu all stood on a fully French podium for the BMX cycling final (winning gold, silver, and bronze respectively). Prodigious. Night had fallen by the time the president slipped away, leaving the Olympic cauldron and its golden reflections behind him. \"Like the French, Emmanuel Macron was blown away. He had no doubt that it was going to be a success, but the things we can't predict are the touches of magic,\" said a source at the Elysée enthusiastically.\n\n'Sports fan president'\n\nHaving left Paris on Sunday, July 28, to take in the sea air from the presidential summer residence in southern France, the president had, until now, only been virtually watching the events. With one eye on his WhatsApp feed, which his staff had set up so that he could be alerted to French medal wins at a moment's notice, the president would comment on the victories on X, between two outings at sea: \"And one!\" (after the first victory, a bronze medal won by judoka Shirine Boukli); \"Marchand de rêve\" – \"Dream Merchant\" (following swimmer Léon Marchand's gold medal in the 200m butterfly); \"Glorious day\" (after Cassandre Beaugrand's gold in the triathlon). The congratulations were systematic, but delivered from afar; while Gabriel Attal, France's caretaker prime minister, was present in the photos, witnessing the French champions' crowning achievements first-hand.\n\n\"The Games belong to the French. There's been a lot of politics lately, and Emmanuel Macron doesn't want to steal [the spotlight from] the sporting event,\" sources at the Elysée argued. The president, who has been described as unloved and worn down by seven years in power, was keeping his public appearances to a minimum. Yet he has also been nicknamed the \"sports fan president,\" who rejoiced in the stands at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and he has never been able to stay away from the capital, where so much of his country's history is being played out, for long."
