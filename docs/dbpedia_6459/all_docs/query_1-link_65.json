With as few as three non-invasive and affordable treatments spaced 30 days apart, you can improve your appearance for six months after your last treatment – and step out with confidence.\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nSkinPen creates hundreds to thousands of “micro” skin punctures per second to stimulate the skin’s natural wound healing process – inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling – to prompt tissue remodeling without causing scar tissue formation. Most patients can return to normal activities within 24 hours.\n\nWhy Use it?\n\nSkinPen is clinically proven to fight the appearance of neck wrinkles and reduce the appearance of acne scars. In fact, 90% of subjects in the clinical trial would recommend the treatment to friends and family. It’s a minimally invasive procedure performed in-office with little to no downtime. As the first FDA-cleared microneedling device, SkinPen sets the industry standard for safety.\n\nWill it Work for Me?\n\nUnlike some alternatives, SkinPen has been clinically proven to be effective for women and men with with all Fitzpatrick Skin Types I – VI. Likewise, unlike lasers or chemical peels that can damage skin over the long term, SkinPen treatments, when properly spaced and overseen by a physician, can be used for years.\n\nIs It Safe?\n\nYes, by design. SkinPen’s patented – and single-use – sterile needle cartridge is built with safety in mind. SkinPen is also surrounded by a custom-designed BioSheath that acts as a barrier to prevent cross contamination between procedures. That’s part of the reason SkinPen by Crown Aesthetics is the world’s first FDA-cleared microneedling device. Learn more by reviewing our patient labeling document.\n\nWho Should Not Use It?\n\nSkinPen should not be used on patients who have active skin cancer in the treatment area(s); open wounds, sores, or irritated skin in the treatment area(s); an allergy to stainless steel or anesthetics; a hemorrhagic (bleeding) disorder or hemostatic (bleeding) dysfunction; are pregnant or nursing; or are currently taking drugs with the ingredient isotretinoin (such as Accutane). Talk to your doctor to see if this treatment is right for you.\n\nHow Much Does it Cost?\n\nMicroneedling procedures tend to cost less than the alternatives, due to their non-invasive nature. The cost of SkinPen procedures varies depending on the size and the number of treatment areas. During your consultation, your physician can develop a plan to work within your budget.\n\nWhat About SkinPen Did the FDA Clear?\n\nQuite a bit. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s clearance covers not only the SkinPen device but the entire protocol. That includes the Skinfuse® Lift HG hydrogel used to protect against abrasion and friction during the treatment, as well as the custom-designed BioSheath to prevent cross contamination.\n\nSkincare Confidential:\n\nTrue SkinPen Stories, Uncovered\n\nReal feedback from real SkinPen clients.\n\n\"I understand that the terminology 'microneedling' sounds scary, I would say the benefits I have seen with it is less scarring, a boost of confidence - 100% - I can't deny that at all.

I would recommend SkinPen\" - David\n\nWhy SkinPen Works\n\nFind a Provider\n\nExperience the benefits of SkinPen by finding a provider near you.
