Cross-cultural and geographical exploration continues, and holidays and festivals are celebrated and investigated through crafts, songs, and culinary traditions.\n\nPractical Arts\n\nAlongside their study of geology, sixth graders learn to pinch, burnish and barrel fire their own bowls and vases. They dig a small amount of Hartsbrook clay, clean and process it for use.
