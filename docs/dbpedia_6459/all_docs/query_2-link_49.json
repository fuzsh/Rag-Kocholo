        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTo the soldier, the civilian\n\nThe martyr, the victim\n\nThis is war.\n\n– ♛♛♛ –\n\nAEMOND\n\nThe final day had arrived, his stay in Dorne now coming to a close, and he had not yet received any answer from Qoren Martell in regards to their offer. Aemond was packing the little amount of clothes and belongings he had brought with him, ready to go retrieve his aunt Viserra and to depart from Dorne.\n\nHe had hoped he would leave them as an ally, but he was just as prepared to leave as an enemy. He felt a slight pang in his heart, Coryanne’s face forming in his mind’s eye for a moment before pushing it away and steeling himself.\n\nHe could have loved her, probably. She was a warrior in many ways, similar to he. He had found a kindred spirit of sorts in her, in the few days they had gotten acquainted. And she was beautiful, perhaps one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen.\n\nBut there was no use in being upset over what the Gods had willed for him, and for his path in life. There was a knock at the door, interrupting him from his musings.\n\n“Enter!” He called, his back to the door. Soft footsteps entered the room and he turned, and was surprised to see Coryanne.\n\n“Princess,” He said simply. “I did not expect to see you.”\n\n“Leaving so soon?” She inquired, a put upon expression on her face. “Can you not stay a bit longer?” She asked, her voice having a seductive lilt to it as she moved closer to him.\n\n“I must be back in King’s Landing for the coronation.” Aemond said briskly. “And it appears your father has not yet reached a decision regarding my offer.”\n\n“That is actually why I’m here,” Coryanne admitted. “Father wants to see you before your departure. One of the guards has already retrieved the Princess Viserra.”\n\nAemond raised a brow and shouldered his pack.\n\n“Lead the way, Princess.” He said, waving his arm. She took his hand, lacing their fingers casually as she began to lead him to what he assumed would be Qoren’s solar. He ignored the tingling in his fingertips and the warmth that seemed to envelope him at her touch and silently followed her.\n\n“I am sad to see you go,” Coryanne admitted after a few moments of silence. “I’ve grown to enjoy your company.”\n\n“My my,” Aemond clucked his tongue. “You’re admitting that you’ll miss me? How irregular of you, Princess.”\n\nShe elbowed him in the abdomen and shot him a dry glare, and he snorted, biting back a laugh that was bubbling past his lips.\n\n“Shut up.” She said primly.\n\n“If all goes well, you won’t have to miss me so much,” Aemond conceded. “If that is, of course, what you want.”\n\nShe appraised him for a moment, eyeing him skeptically before shrugging, a teasing lilt in her voice as she spoke.\n\n“I could do worse.” She acknowledged, dipping her head. “You could be a troll, or an old man with a cock so withered it would practically have disappeared.”\n\n“High praise,” Aemond said dryly. “I’m glad that you rank me ahead of ghastly trolls and wheezing old men with withered cocks.”\n\nShe winked at him, a melodic laugh escaping her lips.\n\n“Here you are, My Prince.” She said, turning to leave before hesitating and turning back.\n\n“Yes?” Aemond asked quizzically, raising a brow.\n\n“Forgive me for being forward, but, I do hope to be seeing more of you,” She said, and taking a deep breath, placed a soft hand on his jaw, pressing a gentle kiss to the scarred side of his cheek, her crimson, soft lips, kissing the puckered line of his scar, uncaring of the rough and uneven skin. He held his breath, closing his eyes for a long moment after she pulled away, and lamented the cold at the absence of her touch for a moment.\n\nOnce he opened his eyes, she was gone. He inhaled a shaky breath, and pushed the door to the solar open.\n\n“Prince Aemond!” Qoren exclaimed, a smile on his face as he surveyed the man with pink cheeks and a red lipstick stain. His smile turned knowing. “I’m glad you found your way alright.”\n\nAemond nodded, his cheeks turning even pinker as Viserra smirked and with a handkerchief, dabbed at his cheek. He grew mortified upon seeing the red lipstick adorning the white garment, and wanted the Earth to open up and swallow him whole. He cleared his throat, straightening his spine.\n\n“I did,” Aemond dipped his head. “I suppose you have come to a decision?” He asked.\n\n“I have,” Qoren nodded.\n\n“Not a moment too soon,” Aemond drawled. “We depart within the hour.”\n\n“Then allow me to make this quick.” Qoren said simply. “I have sent an envoy to the captain of my ships, with an order to withdraw from the blockade. House Martell, now, in perpetuity is aligned with House Targaryen. Myself and Coryanne will prepare the journey to King’s Landing, to swear our oaths to the Dragon Queen. Your wedding shall take place soon after.”\n\nHe sidled a document in front of Aemond, who quickly surveyed the contents. No loopholes, nothing out of the ordinary. It was everything that was discussed and agreed upon, the terms remain the same and it was written plainly. An irontight agreement and treaty.\n\nAemond surveyed him for a moment before grabbing a quill and signing his name. He inclined his head.\n\n“Our alliance will strengthen the realm in ways it never has before.” Aemond spoke, his voice clear and even.\n\n“I look forward to all we can accomplish,” Qoren smiled, sharp and wise.\n\nViserra smirked.\n\n“We’ll see you after the coronation, Prince Qoren.” She said smoothly.\n\nThey were mounted on Vhagar and flying back home within the hour, a feeling of triumph and eagerness blooming within Aemond’s heart.\n\n“You did it,” Viserra whispered into his ear as they were flying in the sky, figures blurring below them, the clouds and blue sky surrounded them in a blanket of cool tranquility. She squeezed his waist, and he patted her hand in reply.\n\n“ We did it.” He answered her, his voice lost in the wind. But, he was sure she heard him.\n\n– ♛♛♛ –\n\nJACAERYS\n\nHe ignored the hums and murmurs of the people behind him as he stood, back straight and a golden coronet braced upon his brow. He watched as his mothers kneeled in front of Aegon, who had been chosen to do the honors. The symbolism was not lost on him. Having the main opposition to her rule to be the one to place the crown upon her head in front of the masses.\n\n“Do you, Rhaenyra Targaryen, swear before the Gods to govern the Seven Kingdoms according to their respective laws and customs?” Aegon’s voice boomed throughout the room, the whispers and murmurs descending into a hushed silence. Aemond, having arrived just a few days prior, stood behind Jace, straight backed and impassive as he watched the scene in front of them. Their family stood, surrounding them all, watching with various expressions on their faces.\n\nRhaenyra was garbed entirely in red and black, her dress bejeweled and extravagant in a way Jace had never seen his mother dress before. Her hair was braided intricately, with rubies woven into them. She donned a cape, with the Targaryen three headed dragon emblazoned on the back for all to see.\n\n“I solemnly swear, before the Gods.” Rhaenyra answered, her voice even and unwavering. Aegon’s face had a proud smile, a glint in his eyes as he spoke once more.\n\n“Do you swear to rule with honor, justice, and mercy, to follow the will of the Gods and protect your subjects from all that dare to cause them harm?”\n\n“I swear so to do,” Rhaenyra intoned, her answer ringing through the ears of all that witness this moment that Jace imagines will be enshrined in history forevermore. Jace, for a moment, thought it ironic, that this statement and solemn promise was soon to be followed by an execution, and then, war.\n\nAegon moved, the crown in his hands as he gently placed it upon her brow.\n\n“Then by the sacred law vested in me, Prince Aegon Targaryen, I crown you, Queen Rhaenyra of the Seven Kingdoms, the First of her Name, Queen of the Andals, The Rhoynar, and the First Men, the Lady Protector of the Realm.” She stood onto her feet steadily, turning and facing them, Aegon standing proudly at her back.\n\nQueenmaker , they whisper in regards to Aegon. Her face was impassive, Daemon stood just a few inches behind her now, a coronet adorning his brow much like Jace’s, but far more extravagant, designed in the image of the Conqueror’s Crown.\n\nIt was silent for a long moment, before Jace knelt.\n\n“Long live the Queen!” He shouted, kneeling before his mother. He smiled, feeling as though they had conquered the worst of it, but knowing that they hadn’t. He felt, for the barest of moments, untouchable.\n\nEveryone followed, the chant echoing until Jace was sure it could be heard in the far North, the pride in his eyes swallowed by the tears in her eyes and the smile that bloomed across her face. She had finally ascended to what was rightfully hers, and now, in earnest, is when the war truly began.\n\n“Citizens of King’s Landing!” She spoke, her voice echoing, quieting the chants as she held onto the hilt of Blackfyre and the golden crown of the Conciliator glistened upon her brow. “You have put your faith and your trust into me, and I assure you, it is not misplaced.”\n\nA pin drop could be heard, as everyone held their breath, hanging onto her every word as though she were a goddess coming to speak with the mere mortals. She looked saintly, queenly in a way he had never before seen. Jace had always thought she had a royal air to her, someone born to be queen, but now, he sees it more in this moment than he ever has before. She was not just his mother, but his ruler. He would die to protect her, to protect her claim and his own.\n\n“I am sure you have heard whispers of a coming war, of vipers and poison plotting to take down the House of the Dragon,” and then, whispers arose once more. Of fear and unrest, of speculation. He turned towards them, moving smoothly to stand beside his mother, his coronet marking him as the new Heir to the Iron Throne and Prince of Dragonstone, his authority now only second to his mother. An imposing figure and shadow in her corner. Her sword, her son, her heir.\n\n“These whispers are true. Vile treasons have been levied against the Crown, against my House, and though I swore to myself I would try to uphold the peace that my father and grandfather have held for many years, it seems the Gods have willed for my path to be otherwise.” She spoke clearly, her voice even and her gaze cold.\n\n“Our realm is threatened, you are threatened, by those who profess to be scholars, learned people, those who swore to be kind, and just, to help not just the royal family and the noblemen and women, but the smallfolk. We have been misled, by the Maesters of the Citadel, by the Hightowers of Old Town, and by the Faith.”\n\nThe whispers grew louder as she spoke the horrid words, dissent beginning to crawl up in the ranks of not just the witnessing nobles, but of the smallfolk that were gathered before them, witnessing the first crowning ever of a Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n“As Queen, I swore to protect you from those who seek to do you harm, and I will. I will protect you from these treacherous oathbreakers, from the lies they sow and the havoc they wreak.” Raising her voice and turning her head towards the Kingsguard — Queensguard — she speaks. “Bring forth the prisoners!”\n\nShocked gasps and shouts were released from the crowd as Otto Hightower and Grandmaester Mellos were brought forth in front of them all, roughly placed on their knees, bound, chained, and dirty from the days they spent in the Black Cells. Rhaenyra and the royal family stared down at them coldly.\n\nJace stepped forward, his hand upon the pommel of his sword, his family standing at their backs.\n\n“You stand accused of treason, of murder, of conspiracy against the Crown and the Royal Family.” Jacaerys spoke, his voice cold and eyes promising death as he stared down the two people that have caused his family such grief and such pain. “How do you plead?”\n\nOtto Hightower spat at his feet, a vicious glare painted upon his face. Maester Mellos merely stared hollowly at the ground, not a sound coming from him, confession nor defiance, not even a whimper.\n\n“I have done my duty, I have served loyally and faithfully.” Otto spat. “It is you who sullies the Crown, it is you who brings forth sin and welcomes heathens and barbarians into the Red Keep. You’re nothing but a whore , crowning bastards and stealing a birthright meant for the firstborn SON! ” He panted, his hatred and anger coming off him in waves.\n\nJace ignored the displeased murmurs, hisses of hatred and jeers against Otto as they watched the once proud and tall man, reduced to behind on his knees before those he professes to hate.\n\n“I have no wish for the crown,” Aegon intoned. “It is not my birthright, Rhaenyra has been heir for longer than I’ve been alive, and it has remained as such throughout my life. I support the One True Queen, the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.”\n\nCheers and applause followed his words, but Jace paid them no heed.\n\n“Otto Hightower, we have found correspondence to and from Old Town, speaking of your and the Grandmasters' involvement in the murder of Queen Aemma, and her son, the Prince Baelon.” Jace ignored the gasps and curses of outrage. “We have gauged the authenticity of this correspondence and found it to be true. How do you plead against these charges?”\n\nOtto opened his mouth, to refute, Jace was sure, but was interrupted by Mellos, who seemed to have been broken by his stint in the cells. The old man collapsed at their feet, blubbering and begging.\n\n“It is true, I was tasked by the Lord of the Hightower to convince Viserys to cut the babe from the late Queen Aemma, to make sure the little Prince stopped breathing in the night. I was instructed to poison the dragons, and to let the assassin of Prince Jacaerys into the Red Keep. I confess!” He shouted, growing delirious as the tears streamed down his wrinkled, red face. “I confess to it all!”\n\nJace tried not to look taken aback, not expecting the confession. Not expecting any of it at all. He had been gearing himself for a trial by combat, and it appears he would not have to endure such ceremony.\n\nThe people had seen it, it had been laid bare and uncovered now for all to witness. The corruptness, the evil that had been allowed to fester and take root.\n\nSyrax and the dragons stood tall, perched upon the buildings behind them, showing their strength and their power. Syrax screeched a deafening sound, a sound of vengeance, followed by the other dragons who roared in tandem, joining the screaming and the cursing of the smallfolk, calling for blood.\n\nThere was one thing nobody of sound mind was fond of, and that was people that harmed children.\n\n“I, Crown Prince Jacaerys, Prince of Dragonstone, deem you guilty of treason against the crown. Your punishment shall be death.” He intoned, his voice cold as he unsheathed his sword. “In the name of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, I sentence you to die.”\n\nThe Queensguard placed the blocks underneath the necks of the prisoners, and he decided to behead the Maester first, savoring the look of hatred and fear in Otto’s eyes as he watched the old man be beheaded. He swung his sword in the air, the sunlight dancing off the metal, making it glint with an almost divine presence. He felt the woosh as he swung, and felt the sword pass through the man's squishy neck with ease. The squelching sound reverberated through the air, and the blood dripped from his sword as the man's head disconnected from his neck seamlessly, and dropped to the ground with a thud.\n\nHe turned to Otto, and smiled.\n\n“Isn’t it funny?” Jace whispered, their exchange only to be heard by them. “The last thing you’ll see, is the bastard you so despise, as I separate your miserable head from your wretched shoulders.”\n\n“This will not die with me,” Otto hissed, vitriol spewing from his tongue. “There are others.”\n\n“And I will kill them as well, just as I will now kill you.” Jace promised, and swung. The air stilled for a moment, time slowed down, and the cheers and chants were dulled, as though he were underwater. He lifted his head, and for a moment, witnessed the Conqueror standing before him in the Crowd, taller than anyone, everyone blurring until all Jace could see was him, and his crossed arms and imposing figure. His crown glinted against his white hair, his arms were crossed.\n\nTheir eyes met, and the Conqueror nodded. Jace inclined his head back, and it seemed that time had caught up with itself once more. Aegon was gone, and the crowd's screams were deafening in his ear.\n\nOtto Hightower was no more. From this moment, there was no turning back.\n\nHe raised his bloody sword in triumph, and the dragons all roared in answer with him.\n\nThey have called their banners. Their people cheer for them, chant for their new queen and their Black Prince, and as he wiped the blood from his sword, he turned to his family. Standing with him, with their dragons at their backs and their chins raised in defiance and power alongside his.\n\nThis is a war that the Hightowers will not win. The dragons were coming, and though Rhaenyra swore to rule with mercy, Jacaerys, his Uncles, and Cregan had not, as of yet, made any such oath.\n\nThey would be reminded to fear the dragons. They would be reminded to fear the wolves.\n\nIt would be entrenched in legend, carved into stone, what the Targaryens could accomplish when together. For generations, for centuries to come, when people hear the names Stark and Targaryen put together, hear that they were united and march underneath one banner, the feeling of fear and death would soon follow.\n\nHe stepped back, allowing Rhaenyra to be front and center in the eyes of the smallfolk as she personally grabbed the severed heads by the hair, and mounted them upon the spikes herself.\n\nWhen she spoke, her voice carried through the crowds.\n\n“My House words are Fire and Blood , and I swear to you all, those who think to harm you, shall die screaming .”\n\nThe cheers that followed were deafening.\n\nAll hail the Dragon Queen."
