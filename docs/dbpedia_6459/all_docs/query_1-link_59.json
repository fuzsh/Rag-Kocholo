        "text": "Quick facts\n\nStrawberries need full sun to produce maximum fruit.\n\nSpace plants 12 to 18 inches apart.\n\nStrawberries are self-fertile, but require bees for pollination.\n\nRemove some of the runners throughout the season or your strawberry plants will take over your yard.\n\nAfter removing flowers for a few weeks after planting, you can pick fruit later that summer.\n\nOne June-bearing plant can produce up to 120 new daughter plants in one season.\n\nTypes of strawberries\n\nThere are three types of strawberries available to the home gardener.\n\nJune-bearing strawberries produce a large, concentrated crop in mid-June to early July.\n\nEver-bearing types produce two crops, one in early summer and the second in early fall.\n\nDay neutral plants produce fruit throughout most of the growing season.\n\nOf the three types, June-bearing strawberries normally produce the largest yield per season, but in a short period of time.\n\nStrawberry plants usually begin flowering in mid-May in southern Minnesota. For June-bearing varieties it takes about four weeks from plants flowering to picking fruit.\n\nDay neutral and ever-bearing types begin flowering around the same time in the spring and take about the same time between flowering and harvest. The difference is that they keep flowering through the summer months.\n\nIn addition to leaves, flowers and fruit, a strawberry plant has a crown, roots, runners and produces daughter plants.\n\nThe woodland strawberry\n\nThe woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) is a day neutral strawberry species. You might also see it called alpine strawberry, fraises des bois, wild strawberry or European strawberry. The plants produce small, sweet fruit with maybe two to three berries per plant per week.\n\nBecause many of these plants are grown from seed, the plants can either produce runners or not. They tolerate shadier sites and can be planted in the front of perennial beds, walkways or in containers.\n\nFollow this calendar to keep strawberries healthy and productive\n\nWhat to do When to do it\n\nThese varieties were chosen mainly for flavor and, when mulched, they are winter hardy in USDA Zone 4.\n\nUSDA Zone 3 is much colder and plants need additional cover to survive temperature extremes without snow cover.\n\nAlthough most garden centers sell strawberry plants in spring, many of the varieties listed here are commonly available only from mail-order sources. You can find nurseries online that carry the ones you'd like to plant.\n\nVariety Type Hardiness (zone 4 to zone 3) Description Annapolis June-bearing Good to poor Vigorous plants produce medium-large fruit with mild, sweet flavor. Produces many runners. Earliglow June-bearing Fair to poor Firm, glossy fruit with classic strawberry flavor. Some disease resistance. Vigorous. Great variety for beginners. Jewel June-bearing Good to poor Firm, glossy fruit with excellent flavor. Tolerates molds and rots. Heavy producer. Honeoye June-bearing Excellent to very good Very productive. Aromatic, large, glossy, crimson berries with excellent flavor. Disease resistant and easy to grow. Cavendish June-bearing Excellent to very good Ripens over a long season. Produces large berries with very good flavor. Prolific runners. Ogallala Ever-bearing Excellent to very good Vigorous plants produce soft, deep red, rich-flavored berries. Drought tolerant. Seascape Day neutral Very good to poor Productive from early summer through fall. Bright red berries inside and out. Disease resistant. Great for containers and garden beds. Albion Day neutral Fair to poor Medium, firm berries have excellent flavor. Produces consistently from June until frost. Great for containers or in the garden. Alpine strawberry Day neutral Excellent to good Not a variety but a different type/species of strawberry. Grows well in part shade. Does not produce runners, so plants remain small.\n\nPlanting and caring for young plants\n\nStrawberries require sun to produce fruit. Ten or more hours of sunlight each day is ideal,but they need a minimum of six hours of direct sunlight each day.\n\nBefore planting, a soil test will help you find out if you need to add any nutrients to your soil.\n\nIt's a good idea to work some well-rotted compost into the soil before planting. Compost helps add nutrients to the soil, improves drainage and increases microbial activity, all of which will benefit the plants.\n\nAlthough most garden centers sell strawberry plants in spring, many of the best varieties for Minnesota are available only from online or mail-order sources.\n\nNurseries generally ship dormant, bare root plants at the appropriate time for planting in your region. The plants arrive looking small and brown; they have not started growing yet.\n\nKeep the plants moist and cool, and plant them as soon as possible.\n\nYou will see fresh green growth appearing within a week or so.\n\nIf you buy potted plants from a garden center, look for vigorous plants without any discolored or dead leaves.\n\nKeep the soil in the pot moist until planting.\n\nSite selection\n\nBy choosing the right site to grow strawberries, you can lower disease and insect pest pressure.\n\nChoose a site located away from trees and buildings that cast shade for more than a few hours each day.\n\nTrees will compete for water and nutrients as well as cast shade, so the strawberry bed should lay beyond the root zone of large trees. The root zone is roughly the same size as the canopy of a tree.\n\nStrawberries should be planted in well-drained soil that does not accumulate standing water following a heavy rainstorm.\n\nPlanting on higher ground minimizes frost damage, while increasing air circulation around the strawberry plants.\n\nGood air circulation allows the berries to dry out faster, reducing the incidence of some diseases.\n\nPlant spacing\n\nIf planting a large number of strawberries plant in rows. This makes it easier to control weeds, runners and pests.\n\nThere are many methods of row planting that work well for strawberries, but by far the most common method is the matted row system:\n\nSpace plants 18 to 24 inches apart\n\nSpace rows 3 to 4 feet apart\n\nJune-bearing plants especially will send out many runners throughout the season and fill in the space between plants, so it's important to go with the recommended spacing, otherwise your plants will quickly become overcrowded.\n\nStrawberries in the landscape\n\nStrawberries don't need to be planted in rows when incorporated into the home landscape.\n\nDay neutral types work well at the front of a perennial border or along a sidewalk or driveway. Because they produce fewer runners than June-bearing types, maintenance is minimal.\n\nStrawberry plants may also be grown as a ground cover.\n\nTo grow a strawberry ground cover, space the mother plants in a grid, either 1 x 1 foot or 2 x 2 feet.\n\nThe planting will require regular weeding, especially in the first year, but maintenance should be minimal after the plants are established.\n\nStrawberries grown as a ground cover may not produce quite as much fruit as those grown in rows, but the plants will add a beautiful touch to your landscape.\n\nPlanting depth\n\nPlant dormant strawberry transplants in spring as soon as the soil is warm enough to easily get a trowel into it. Potted plants should be planted soon after purchase, after risk of frost is past.\n\nIt is important to plant dormant transplants at the right depth.\n\nIf the crowns are planted too shallow they lose water and can die.\n\nIf the crowns are planted too deeply the leaves may not be able to emerge from the soil.\n\nIf planting a growing plant bought from a nursery or garden center, simply plant at the same depth the plant was in the container.\n\nDormant transplants have no growth, but sprout quickly when exposed to light and warm temperatures. Plant center of the crown (red line) at the soil line with the roots fully buried and growth visible.\n\nTransplants can be planted into a trench as seen here, or into holes dug for each plant.\n\nThis transplant has been planted at the proper depth. The roots are fully below the soil line and the growth points are visible above the soil.\n\nAfter planting, firm the soil around the plant and water thoroughly.\n\nStrawberries perform best when they are given the equivalent of 1 inch of rainwater per week.\n\nUse a rain gauge to monitor rainfall and water with a soaker hose or drip system if needed.\n\nOne good soaking each week should be enough in most soil types.\n\nAlways water early in the day so that leaves have a chance to dry before nightfall. This will help prevent leaf diseases.\n\nHow to keep strawberries healthy and productive\n\nSpring of planting year\n\nAfter planting, pinch off any flower buds that appear for the first few weeks. This allows the plant to produce leaves and roots so when the flowers are pollinated and begin to produce fruit there is enough energy in the plant to develop large, juicy strawberries.\n\nSummer\n\nAs runners begin to appear, place them where you want the plants to fill in and gently press the end of the runner into the soil. This will encourage the daughter plant to root where you want it to. If the plants are running too much, simply cut them off with a scissors or pruning shears.\n\nAfter harvest\n\nContinue to water plants.\n\nThin out plants, leaving remaining plants about 6 to 8 inches apart.\n\nRemove older, woody plants and leave the younger plants for next year.\n\nFertilize with compost around the plants to keep them growing through the season.\n\nDay neutral plants flower and fruit throughout the summer. If plants are not growing well, applying compost along the side of the plants will give them a boost of nitrogen. Other organic fertilizers such as blood meal can be used too.\n\nFall\n\nJune-bearing strawberry plants continue to grow and produce runners until the frost kills the leaves. Keep removing runner plants if there is a lot of crowding.\n\nAfter the plants have entered dormancy due to cold temperatures, and the temperatures are staying below 40°F, straw mulch should be applied about 4 to 6 inches over the top of the plants. This mulch will protect the plants from extreme winter cold so they will emerge again next spring.\n\nMost day neutral varieties are not quite hardy enough to over-winter in Minnesota, but it may be worth a try. Cover these with straw just as you would June-bearing plants.\n\nWinter\n\nWinter is the time strawberry plants will rest, so there isn't much for you to do. A good snow cover on top of the straw mulch will help insulate the plants from bitter cold temperatures, so enjoy watching that snow pile up!\n\nAfter raking straw mulch off in the spring, keep the straw mulch between and under plants to help retain soil moisture, prevent weeds, and give the berries a nice clean surface on which to ripen.\n\nSpring of the second year and beyond\n\nStraw mulch applied to protect plants from winter cold should be removed when the snow and ice melts completely.\n\nThis winter mulch makes a great summer mulch too. Rake the straw off the plants and leave it between them to help conserve water and keep weeds down as the temperatures begin to rise.\n\nFertilizing\n\nIf June-bearing plants do not produce many runners by mid-July this usually means the plants need more nitrogen.\n\nYou can apply compost or an organic fertilizer, such as blood meal, around the plants to increase nitrogen for plant growth.\n\nBefore plants begin to grow in the spring of the second year, you may need to add more compost or organic nitrogen to encourage plant growth and fruit development.\n\nWeeding\n\nBecause strawberries are poor competitors, keep all weeds out of the strawberry bed.\n\nHand-weeding is recommended for home gardeners.\n\nCareful cultivation with a hoe is effective for managing weeds in strawberry plantings, but be careful not to dig too deeply, as you could damage the plant's shallow root system.\n\nHarvest and storage\n\nStrawberries ripen from the tip towards the leafy stem end. Some varieties have \"white shoulders\" because the leaves cover the fruit and do not allow for the red color to develop. But most will be completely red when ripe. They might not all be large, but a deep red, homegrown strawberry will always have a big flavor.\n\nLook through the plants daily once you see the red color developing and harvest ripe fruit.\n\nStrawberries do not store for very long in the refrigerator. For best results, pick the fruit when it is dry and place fruit in refrigerator immediately. This will help extend the storage life of the berries.\n\nWinter protection\n\nThe crown of a strawberry plant may be killed at 15°F, therefore winter protection is essential.\n\nAfter 2 or 3 frosts have hardened off the plants, cover them with 4 to 6 inches of weed-free straw\n\nStraw is especially valuable in late fall or early spring when bitter cold temperatures might occur without snow cover\n\nSnow is an excellent insulator and will be sufficient protection where snow cover is reliable\n\nRake straw away in spring when growth begins, but leave some at the base of the plants to act as the summer mulch.\n\nIf frost is predicted after flowering begins, either re-cover the plants with straw or protect them with spun-bonded polyester fabric row covers.\n\nRenovation helps control diseases and insect pests by disrupting their life cycles.\n\nRegardless of the size and shape of your strawberry patch it is best to mow or cut the foliage back before August 1.\n\nA new canopy will develop by mid-August.\n\nFirst, mow plants and remove clippings.\n\nThis helps to control diseases by removing older leaves that are infected by leaf spot or fruit rot pathogens. This helps to control insects by removing their food source and potential breeding sites.\n\nThin rows\n\nIf plants are grown in rows, renovation is a good time to thin widening rows back to their original width. This will improve airflow through the patch and reduce the time that the leaf surfaces are wet, which can reduce disease severity.\n\nTo have a good crop in the following year requires healthy thriving plants from post-renovation to dormancy in the fall. Pay attention to the health of your plants in this time period.\n\nManaging pests and disorders\n\nGardeners need to be able to identify pests and the damage that they cause in order to choose the best way to manage them.\n\nYou can find additional help identifying common pest problems by using the online diagnostic tools What insect is this? and What's wrong with my plant? or by sending a sample to the UMN Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic.\n\nFor detailed management strategies for specific insects and diseases see Pest management for the home strawberry patch.\n\nWhat to do When to do it Protect strawberry flower buds from spring frosts. Do not remove straw mulch used for winter protection until there is no longer a threat of frost, around when lilac buds begin to open. Early spring Leave mulch in the alleyways. To reduce spread of diseases from soil to fruit and leaves, add straw mulch around plants and in alleyways if remaining winter straw mulch is less than 2 inches deep. Early spring If gray mold was a problem the previous year, completely remove all straw mulch from the bed and replace with new straw. Early spring Use mulch to recover flowers if a frost is predicted. Early spring Do not apply nitrogen in spring. It can produce too much young leaf tissue susceptible to leaf-disease fungi. Early spring Look for clipped buds that could mean strawberry bud weevil activity. Before strawberry flowers bloom Look for Tarnished plant bug adults when flower buds are green or white. Before strawberry flowers bloom If gray mold has been a problem in the past, and high humidity or frequent rain during bloom is predicted, spray flowers with fungicide beginning when 10% of the flowers open and repeating once after the time period specified on the label. Before strawberry flowers bloom Set out traps for spotted wing Drosophila. Strawberry flowers are in full bloom Inspect for slugs. Apply baits if damage is detected. Strawberries are ripe Harvest fruit as it ripens to help protect against sap beetles and spotted wing Drosophila; remove and dispose of overripe fruit. Strawberries are ripe Take care not to wound or bruise berries during harvest. Strawberries are ripe Remove berries infected with fruit rot to prevent spread of disease to ripening fruit. Do not place healthy fruit and diseased fruit into the same container. Strawberries are ripe Renovate in the two weeks following harvest. After harvest Rake up and remove all leaf debris from the bed after renovation. After harvest Apply nitrogen fertilizers. After harvest Apply straw that is free of weed seeds two to three inches deep over the plants after they have been subjected to several sharp freezes in the low 30s or high 20s. Fall\n\nTo produce healthy plants, avoid situations that favor the development of diseases or contribute to insect infestations.\n\nWatering\n\nWhen watering plants, avoid getting the leaf surfaces wet by using a drip system or a soaker hose.\n\nIf a sprinkler system is used, water plants in the mornings on a sunny day to allow leaf surfaces to dry quickly, to reduce fungal diseases.\n\nSite rotation\n\nLand that has been planted in strawberries for 4 years or more can build up a population of root-rotting diseases.\n\nIf possible, move strawberry plants to different areas of the garden every 3 to 4 years.\n\nWinter injury\n\nStraw mulch reduces winter injury and plants that have less winter injury have reduced disease.\n\nStraw mulch is important in the spring and summer to reduce fruit and flower diseases by covering the soil and reducing spore movement carried by raindrop splash.\n\nWhen removing straw in spring, leave 1/2 to 1 inch of straw between rows to keep fruit off the soil and reduce weeds.\n\nThere are many different insect pests of strawberries. Some of these pests will be present every year, and some you will never see.\n\nMost insect damage can be reduced by following the best practices mentioned above and:\n\nRemove leaf litter to reduce the number of insect overwintering sites.\n\nRemove weeds and keep lawns mowed as they can provide habitat for adults to feed and overwinter.\n\nRenovate the patch to remove potential habitat and reduce insect numbers.\n\nFrequently harvest crops to ensure ripe fruits are not in gardens for too long.\n\nRemove and destroy any old fruit that remains on stems or that has fallen to the ground.\n\nThe most common insect pests of strawberries in Minnesota are tarnished plant bugs, strawberry bud weevils, slugs and flower thrips.\n\nThe tarnished plant bug feeds on developing flowers, causing deformed berries.\n\nThe strawberry clipper clips off flower buds in spring, thus reducing harvest.\n\nSlugs feed on ripe fruit, leaving small, deep holes in the fruit and irregular holes in foliage.\n\nFeeding by thrips causes berries to appear bronzed and seedy.\n\nSpotted wing drosophila is a particular problem of ever-bearing strawberries and other soft fruits in Minnesota.\n\nWildlife\n\nRodents and birds may cause more trouble in home strawberry plantings than insects. Large holes in ripe fruit are a good sign that these creatures are enjoying your strawberries. Pick fruit as soon as it is ripe to prevent damage.\n\nFrost during bloom can cause strawberries to be deformed and undersized as it ripens. Damaged fruit is still edible.\n\nFrost damage is easily mistaken for tarnished plant bug (TPB) damage. Both cause puckering and concentrations of seeds on parts of the berries, as the damaged part grows more slowly than the rest of the berry. However, frost damage has a less predictable injury pattern, while TPB injury causes puckering or “cat facing” at the tip of the berry.\n\nTips for distinguishing frost damage from TPB damage:\n\nFrost damage appears randomly over the fruit. TPB damage is concentrated at the tip of the berry.\n\nIf only one berry on a cluster is damaged, then it is more likely due to frost damage. TPB often feed on multiple berries per cluster.\n\nConsider the bud stage of the plants during the last frost. The more developed the blossoms were, the higher the risk of frost damage.\n\nConsider whether you noticed blossoms with black centers after the frost. This is a sign of frost damage.\n\nDiseases of strawberries\n\nStrawberries are susceptible to fruit rots and leaf diseases. Fungi causing fruit rots infect the flowers and fruit as early as bloom time. Leaf diseases often have little effect on plant growth.\n\nTo keep fungi to a minimum:\n\nPlant in full sun.\n\nKeep plants from being crowded.\n\nWater early in the day to reduce the amount of water on the flowers and fruit.\n\nUse straw mulch under the plants.\n\nIdentify and manage fungal diseases\n\nGray mold, leaf blight, leaf scorch and leaf spot are caused by different fungi, but are managed mostly in the same way.\n\nChoose sites with full sun, good soil drainage and air circulation. Fungi require long periods of continuous wetness to infect plants. Any practice that promotes quick drying of leaves and fruit will reduce disease.\n\nRemove weeds to improve air circulation around plants.\n\nPlant in rows or narrow beds, no wider than 12-18 inches, to promote good air movement in and around plants. Patches grow with time as new runners are produced. Use renovation to maintain narrow beds.\n\nRenovate strawberry beds every year after harvest.\n\nFollowing renovation, rake and remove old leaves.\n\nIrrigate with drip irrigation or a soaker hose. If overhead sprinkling is your only option, water early in the morning on a sunny day so leaves dry quickly after irrigation.\n\nApply nitrogen fertilizers after renovation. Avoid early spring applications of nitrogen which encourage overly lush growth that reduces airflow and promotes a moist microclimate optimal for the growth of fungal diseases.\n\nFungicides are either not necessary or not available to home growers to control these diseases.\n\nCultural control practices usually reduce disease to a manageable level.\n\nGray mold\n\nGray mold (Botrytis cinerea) is the most common fruit rot disease of strawberries in Minnesota. The disease is most prevalent when there is prolonged cool, wet weather during flowering.\n\nThe gray mold fungus overwinters on dead strawberry leaves, infected straw, mummified fruit and weeds.\n\nInfection is most severe in rainy or humid conditions where flowers remain wet for more than 12 hours.\n\nCan begin anywhere on the fruit but is most common on the stem end, where the fruit comes in contact with infected flower parts or anywhere the fruit is touched by another infected berry.\n\nInfections may attack blossoms, which then do not develop into fruit.\n\nMore commonly, infections grow in the young fruit and remain dormant until the fruit begins to ripen.\n\nThe fungus rots the fruit and produces powdery, gray spores on the surface of the fruit.\n\nRot spreads to adjoining berries wherever the healthy and rotten fruit touch.\n\nFruit remain attached to the plant but dry down to a shriveled mummified berry.\n\nNew spores are produced on mummy berries during wet weather.\n\nThe gray mold will colonize young leaves and remain dormant within them.\n\nWhen leaves die naturally, they can become an important source of gray mold spores in the strawberry patch.\n\nPlants damaged by winter injury may develop Botrytis crown rot, where leaf and flower stems rot and turn brown at the point where they attach to the crown of the plant.\n\nManagement\n\nHoneoye is the only variety recommended in Minnesota that has shown partial resistance to gray mold.\n\nIn patches with a history of gray mold, remove and discard all straw in early spring approximately when lilac flower buds appear.\n\nPlace fresh straw or other organic mulch between beds to reduce rain splash and weeds and improve air movement around berries.\n\nAvoid wounding plants. Wounds facilitate entry of the disease.\n\nSee more on how to manage this disease above.\n\nHarvest recommendations\n\nHarvest frequently and remove infected fruit from the field throughout the harvest season.\n\nTake care to keep diseased fruit separate from healthy fruit as gray mold can spread rapidly even after harvest.\n\nHandle berries with care and refrigerate soon after picking.\n\nFungicides\n\nFungicides may be needed to protect fruit from gray mold fruit rot in years where rainy wet weather persists while plants are in bloom. In this case, fungicides should be applied during blossom to prevent fruit rot.\n\nRead and follow all label instructions. If the season is one characterized by prolonged periods of wet or humid weather, continue spraying at the interval described on the fungicide label until petal drop.\n\nIf possible watch the weather and spray before rain is predicted. Fungicides with copper or Captan as active ingredients will reduce gray mold fruit rot in strawberry when applied properly. Fungicide sprays applied to green fruit and during fruit harvest do little to reduce disease and are not recommended.\n\nCAUTION: Mention of a pesticide or use of a pesticide label is for educational purposes only. Always follow the pesticide label directions attached to the pesticide container you are using. Remember, the label is the law.\n\nBe sure that the plant you wish to treat is listed on the label of the pesticide you intend to use. Also be sure to observe the number of days between pesticide application and when you can harvest your crop.\n\nLeaf blight\n\nThe leaf blight fungus (Phomopsis obscurans) infects all green parts of the plant and rarely causes a soft rot on ripening and ripe fruit.\n\nLeaves are most severely infected in shaded patches that have heavy dew or in years with frequent rain.\n\nThis fungus requires long periods of continuous wetness to infect plants.\n\nAny practice that promotes quick drying of leaves and fruit will reduce disease.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSolid reddish-purple spots on leaves.\n\nSpots develop tan center as they grow.\n\nSpots enlarge to V-shaped lesions with dry brown centers and reddish-purple borders.\n\nSevere infection can turn whole leaf brown.\n\nBlack specks produce fungus spores.\n\nReddish-purple spots can appear on stems.\n\nMushy pink spots on fruit become dark brown and dry.\n\nSee above for how to manage this disease.\n\nLeaf scorch\n\nIn addition to leaves, leaf scorch (Diplocarpon earlianum) can infect petioles, runners, fruit stalks and berry caps.\n\nIf unchecked, plants can be significantly weakened reducing the growth of all plant parts.\n\nSeverely infected plants are weakened and can die from other stresses such as drought or extreme temperatures.\n\nThe leaf scorch fungus overwinters on infected leaves and on leaf debris within the patch.\n\nThe fungus can remain dormant for long periods in dry leaves, but it produces spores quickly in the presence of moisture.\n\nSpores are spread by wind or by splashing water. Spores will germinate and new leaf spots will form if leaves remain wet for 12 hours or longer.\n\nOnce mature, leaf spots will produce spores throughout the growing season in response to wet conditions. These spores are spread mainly by splashing water.\n\nHot dry weather halts disease progress.\n\nSevere infection in summer and fall can mean fewer strawberries the following year.\n\nInfections on fruit and flower stalks can girdle the stalk and kill the fruit and flower.\n\nSymptoms\n\nDark purple, angular to round spots appear on the upper surface of the leaf.\n\nAs the disease progresses the tissues around these spots turn reddish or purple.\n\nIn severe cases, the infected area dries to a tan color and the leaf curls upward-looking scorched.\n\nLesions remain reddish-purple and do not turn tan or gray in the center.\n\nSee above for how to manage this disease.\n\nLeaf spot\n\nLeaf spot (Mycosphaerella fragariae) was once one of the most common and destructive fungal diseases of strawberry.\n\nSevere infection on susceptible varieties can result in the death of leaflets and the defoliation of plants.\n\nMany new strawberry varieties have resistance to leaf spot and the disease is no longer as common or as problematic as it once was.\n\nThe leaf spot fungus can infect leaves, petioles, runners, fruit stalks, berry caps and fruit.\n\nThe fungus overwinters on infected living leaves and in leaf debris.\n\nSpores are produced in the spring and spread to healthy tissue by splashing rain or irrigation.\n\nCool temperatures (68 to 77 F) and long periods of leaf wetness (more than 12 hours) are required for new infections to develop.\n\nConsecutive wet days with temperatures between 50 and 86 F favor disease development.\n\nThe disease will progress as long as temperature and moisture are in acceptable ranges.\n\nMany strawberries commonly grown in Minnesota can tolerate some leaf spot infection.\n\nAlthough leaf spots may be observed on foliage, the damage is typically not severe enough to reduce yield.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSmall purple spots on leaves or stems.\n\nThe centers of leaf spots turn gray and then white with age.\n\nAs the disease progresses multiple leaf spots merge together creating a reddish purple area with multiple round white centers.\n\nIn severe cases, the leaves turn brown and die.\n\nFruit infections are not common, but appear as small, sunken, leathery, black spots on unripe and ripe fruit.\n\nSeeds within the infected area of the fruit turn black.\n\nSee above for how to manage this disease.\n\nStrawberry black root rot, or BRR, is the most common root disease in Minnesota.\n\nThis disease is a complex problem involving several different pathogens (Rhizoctonia fragariae, Pythium spp., Fusarium spp.) along with a variety of plant stresses such as winter injury. It is common in older strawberry patches or patches stressed by poor growing conditions like soil compaction or poor drainage.\n\nPlants infected with BRR decline overtime, producing significantly lower yields than uninfected plants.\n\nDisease develops when plants are:\n\nStressed by drought, water-logged soils, winter injury, poor nutrition, and root feeding by lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans) or insects; and\n\nOne or more of the black root rot fungi, Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia spp., and Fusarium spp., are found in soils.\n\nRoot tips and young feeder roots may be completely rotten and fall off.\n\nInfection in older roots is limited to the outer tissues of the root, leaving a white core that is unaffected.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe first symptoms of BRR are often missed. Infected plants have poor growth and produce fewer and smaller fruit. As the disease becomes more severe, plants are clearly stunted.\n\nPlants may wilt and the edges of leaves turn brown or have a 'scorched' appearance.\n\nPlants continue to decline and often die after the high stress of fruit production.\n\nIn larger patches, disease often starts in low lying areas or areas with poor drainage. Each year the area of infected plants expands.\n\nPlants with BRR are often described as 'rat tail' because most of the finer feeder roots are rotted away leaving only the thick anchor roots.\n\nThe remaining young roots have random gray to reddish brown sunken blotches. These lesions can expand to cover large areas of the root.\n\nThe infected roots are soft and mushy. When touched, the outer layer often falls away, leaving only a thin strand from the core of the root.\n\nPlants displaying the above symptoms should be carefully dug up and washed, keeping intact as much of the root system as possible. A healthy plant will have young roots that are creamy white with multiple fine root hairs and older roots will have a dark brown to black woody outside layer but a white interior.\n\nManagement\n\nPrevention of black root rot is based on good site selection and proper plant care.\n\nThere are no strawberry varieties that are resistant to black root rot.\n\nChoose a variety that is hardy in Minnesota to reduce winter injury and stress on the plant.\n\nPurchase new plants from a reputable supplier. Roots of young strawberry plants should be white and fleshy.\n\nFor new patches, choose a location where strawberries have not been present for the past 2-4 years.\n\nChoose a location with good drainage or improve drainage before planting through adding organic matter to soil and redirecting water away from the area.\n\nStrawberries can also be planted on raised beds where drainage creates a soil environment less favorable to some root rotting fungi.\n\nAdd organic matter like high quality compost, peat or straw to the soil prior to planting. This will improve drainage and encourage growth of beneficial microorganisms in the soil.\n\nUse a soil test to determine optimum fertilizer applications for the site.\n\nRenovate patches of June-bearing strawberries each year after harvest to maintain a healthy growing patch.\n\nTo avoid winter injury, apply two to three inches of straw in the fall after several frost events below 20 F and above 30 F.\n\nIn existing patches with black root rot, consider starting with new plants in a new location. Do not relocate old plants to the new location as the BRR pathogens will be carried on the roots of infected plants.\n\nThere are no fungicides registered for use by home gardeners that are effective in controlling BRR.\n\nLeather rot occurs sporadically in Minnesota. The disease infects flowers and fruit at all stages. Infected strawberries have a distinctively unpleasant odor and a strong, bitter taste. Infection of a few ripe berries that are processed into jam can ruin the whole jar with this off-taste.\n\nThe leather rot fungus (Phytophthora cactorum) is a water mold (oomycete). Water molds thrive in wet conditions and produce three types of spores.\n\nOospores are tough resting spores that form in mummified berries and can survive many years in soil. These germinate when soils are saturated to produce sporangia and zoospores.\n\nZoospores are swimming spores that move through a film of water on the plant or soil to reach susceptible fruit and flowers. Zoospores only need two hours of moisture on the plant surface to start an infection.\n\nOnce infected, sporangia are produced on fruit and are splashed by rain or irrigation to infect other fruit.\n\nThe leather rot fungus thrives in areas where water stands for awhile after a rain event.\n\nSymptoms\n\nInfections on green fruit are typically tan to brown areas or green outlined by a brown margin.\n\nAs the disease progresses these unripe berries become completely brown and have a rough leathery texture.\n\nInfection of ripe fruit may cause little to no color change, or the infected area may become pale, purple or brown.\n\nRot on ripe fruit becomes dry and leathery over time.\n\nBoth ripe and unripe infected fruit eventually dry down into fruit mummies.\n\nManagement\n\nChoose a location with good drainage or improve drainage before planting through adding organic matter to soil and redirecting water away from the area. Strawberries can also be planted on raised beds to improve drainage.\n\nUse straw mulch to keep berries from contacting soil and any puddled water. Mulch will also reduce splashing of spores from the soil up onto fruit and flowers.\n\nWater through drip irrigation or a soaker hose. If overhead sprinkling is your only option, water early in the morning on a sunny day so leaves dry quickly after irrigation.\n\nPick fruit frequently and remove over ripe and diseased berries from the field.\n\nThere are no fungicides available to home gardeners that are effective in preventing leather rot.\n\nAnthracnose fruit rot is a fungal disease that causes fruit rot and flower blight in warm wet weather.\n\nThe anthracnose fruit rot fungus, Colletotrichum acutatum (rarely C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides), is usually introduced to a site on infected planting material.\n\nThe fungus overwinters on infected plants, plant debris and mummified fruit.\n\nSpores are produced in a sticky mass on any infected plant part during warm (68° F) wet weather.\n\nSpores are spread by water via splashing or wind-driven rain, and by people or equipment moving through the field.\n\nThey are not airborne so they do not spread over long distances in the wind.\n\nThe fungus can attack all plant parts, but fully open flowers and ripening fruit are most susceptible to the disease.\n\nUnder warm, wet conditions, the fungus will produce spores on infected fruit which spread to neighboring plants causing new infections.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPink and red fruit develop light-brown lesions that turn darker brown and sunken.\n\nRotted areas of the fruit remain firm and dry.\n\nPale orange to salmon colored spore masses cover the lesion during warm humid conditions.\n\nUltimately the fruit dries down to a hard, black, shriveled mummy.\n\nBlossoms can be infected at any stage of development.\n\nInfected blossoms quickly die, dry out and turn brown.\n\nThe brown discoloration often extends down the flower stalk.\n\nManagement\n\nThere are no varieties resistant to anthracnose fruit rot that are hardy in Minnesota.\n\nPurchase plants from a reputable supplier. Inspect all plants for symptoms of disease. Plant only healthy symptom free plants.\n\nBecause spores are spread by splashing water, avoid the use of overhead irrigation and use drip irrigation or a soaker hose. If overhead irrigation cannot be avoided, water early in the morning on a sunny day to keep the time that the foliage is wet to a minimum.\n\nMaintain one to two inches of straw mulch between the rows or walking alleys to reduce splash dispersal of disease spores.\n\nRemove infected berries from the planting during harvest to reduce spread of the disease to developing fruit.\n\nFungicides\n\nIf anthracnose has been a problem in the past and weather is warm and wet during flowering and fruit production, fungicides can be applied to reduce infection.\n\nAnthracnose is not easily controlled by fungicides and gardeners should expect a reduction in disease but not complete protection.\n\nFungicides with copper, Captan or Bacillus subtilis listed as the active ingredient provide some protection from anthracnose fruit rot.\n\nAll label instructions must be read and followed when applying a pesticide.\n\nCAUTION: Mention of a pesticide or use of a pesticide label is for educational purposes only. Always follow the pesticide label directions attached to the pesticide container you are using. Remember, the label is the law.\n\nBe sure that the plant you wish to treat is listed on the label of the pesticide you intend to use. Also be sure to observe the number of days between pesticide application and when you can harvest your crop.\n\nAngular leaf spot (ALS) is caused by a bacterium (Xanthomonas fragariae) that primarily infects leaves. This disease is not a common problem today.\n\nAngular leaf spot bacteria are usually introduced to a berry patch on transplants that are infected but not showing symptoms.\n\nUnder favorable weather conditions the bacteria ooze from leaf tissue and are dispersed by rain splash.\n\nThe bacteria can then invade other plants through wounds or natural openings.\n\nThis disease thrives in wet conditions with moderate daytime high temperatures (68° F) and cold nights close to but above freezing (36-39° F).\n\nThe angular leaf spot bacteria can overwinter in the crowns of live plants or in leaf debris.\n\nSymptoms\n\nWater-soaked spots on the underside of leaves delineated by leaf veins creating an angular appearance, best seen by picking a leaf, holding it up to the light and looking at the lower surface.\n\nSpots appear translucent with light behind them but look dark green when the leaf is held in your hand.\n\nAs the disease progresses the damage is visible on the upper surface of the leaf as reddish brown spots surrounded by a yellow halo.\n\nHeavily infected leaves may die.\n\nIn warm wet weather, bacteria ooze out of infected tissue in slimy droplets that dry to a clear scaly film, similar to dried egg white.\n\nIn severe infections, lesions can appear on the fruit caps that are identical to those on leaves.\n\nThe small leaves on top of the berry stem (calyxes ) can also become dark brown and later dry up.\n\nManagement\n\nAt present there are no strawberry varieties resistant to angular leaf spot.\n\nIf angular leaf spot has been a problem in the past, don't plant these susceptible varieties: Allstar, Annapolis, Cavendish, Honeoye and Kent.\n\nPurchase new plants from a reputable supplier and inspect all plants for symptoms of disease prior to planting. Accept only healthy, symptom-free plants.\n\nWater using drip irrigation or a soaker hose. If overhead sprinkling is your only option, water early in the morning on a sunny day so leaves dry quickly.\n\nAvoid working in an infected patch when the plants are wet as bacteria are easily spread on hands and tools at this time.\n\nUse straw mulch to minimize water splashing.\n\nRemove weeds to improve air circulation around plants.\n\nPlant in rows or narrow beds, no wider than 12 - 18 inches, to promote good air movement in and around plants.\n\nPatches grow with time as new runners are produced.\n\nUse renovation to maintain narrow beds.\n\nRenovate strawberry beds every year after harvest.\n\nFollowing renovation, rake and remove old leaves.\n\nAlthough fungicides with copper as an active ingredient have been shown to reduce the number of leaf spots caused by ALS, these applications do not affect yield and are not recommended.\n\nPowdery mildew is a fungal disease that infects leaves and occasionally fruit. Powdery mildew thrives under conditions of low light intensity and warm humid weather. As a result powdery mildew is common in greenhouse-grown plants but occurs only occasionally in gardens.\n\nThe powdery mildew fungus (Podosphaera aphanis) is most commonly introduced into a garden on contaminated transplants but can be present on wild strawberries as well.\n\nThe fungus overwinters in live infected plant tissue.\n\nSpores are carried by wind and can germinate on dry leaf surfaces given high humidity.\n\nPowdery mildew likes warm (60 - 80°F) weather with high humidity.\n\nFrequent rain, dew or irrigation slows the progress of disease.\n\nThe disease can establish in the spring if there are extended periods of warm weather and high humidity.\n\nMore often the disease establishes in mid to late summer where cooler nights lead to high humidity conditions favorable for infection.\n\nSymptoms\n\nWhite patches of fungal growth develop on the lower leaf surface.\n\nIn some varieties, this fluffy white growth is thick, abundant and can cover the entire leaf surface.\n\nIn other varieties, the fungal growth is thin and difficult to see.\n\nSome varieties develop purple to red blotches when infected.\n\nThe leaf margins of infected plants frequently roll upwards.\n\nInfected fruit have raised seeds, a bronze cast to the fruit, and have patches of fluffy white fungal growth.\n\nThese fruit symptoms are similar to symptoms caused by thrips. Use a hand lens to look for white fungal growth around the seeds, which is characteristic of powdery mildew. Bronzing on the underside of calyx tissue would indicate feeding by thrips. Some day-neutral varieties are susceptible to fruit infection in fall even though leaves may appear healthy.\n\nManagement\n\nAlthough some varieties have been reported to show resistance to powdery mildew, these have not proven to be reliably disease-free in Minnesota.\n\nPurchase plants from a reputable supplier. Inspect all plants for symptoms of disease. Plant only healthy symptom free plants.\n\nRenovate strawberry beds every year after harvest.\n\nFollowing renovation, rake and remove old leaves.\n\nFungicides\n\nFungicide sprays may be necessary to protect plants after summer renovation if powdery mildew has been identified in the patch before renovation. Several fungicides are available to control powdery mildew. Choose products with an active ingredient of myclobutanil, sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, or horticultural oil. Apply products according to the label instructions. Repeated applications will be necessary as long as conditions favorable for disease continue. Do not use sulfur on fruit intended for canning.\n\nAuthors: Emily E. Hoover, Extension horticulturist, Emily S. Tepe, Doug Foulk and Annie Klodd, Extension educator\n\nReviewed in 2024"
