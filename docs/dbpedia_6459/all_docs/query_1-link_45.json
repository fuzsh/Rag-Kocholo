        "text": "Before your hearing\n\nWhat to bring with you\n\nIf you’re coming to a court or tribunal for a hearing, bring:\n\nyour hearing letter with your case number – the case number helps you find where you need to go in the building\n\nany papers that you need for your hearing\n\na face covering, if you choose to wear one\n\nhand sanitiser, if you have some\n\nfood and drink, including water (not all buildings have refreshments available)\n\nYou cannot bring weapons, glass or liquids other than non-alcoholic drinks or hand sanitiser into the building.\n\nWhat to wear\n\nApart from a face covering, you cannot wear anything on your head in a court or tribunal building unless it is for religious reasons.\n\nThere are no other rules about what you should wear, but dress smartly if you can.\n\nWhen to arrive\n\nYou need to arrive 30 minutes before the time stated in your hearing letter. Do not arrive earlier as you may be turned away, particularly during busy times.\n\nThe time given in your letter is when the day’s cases start. Your case might not be first so be prepared to wait.\n\nMake any arrangements you need to, for example childcare or taking time off work.\n\nYour safety\n\nWe know that coming to a court or tribunal can feel overwhelming or frightening.\n\nWe have security at all our buildings.\n\nYou should contact the court or tribunal on your letter if you have any worries about your safety on the day.\n\nThere are other things we can do to help you feel safe, for example:\n\nseat you in a different part of the building to others in your case while you wait\n\nprovide a screen in the hearing room so that the other party cannot see you\n\nWho will be at your hearing\n\nFind out who else might be at your hearing and what their roles will be.\n\nSupport available\n\nWho can come with you\n\nIf you need support, only bring one person with you – such as a friend or family member.\n\nIf you come with more than one person, they may not be allowed to enter.\n\nThere are no childcare facilities and staff cannot look after your children while you are in the hearing room.\n\nYou can breastfeed or express milk in all court or tribunal buildings.\n\nIf you have a disability\n\nYou can get support in the court or tribunal building and during your case. This is sometimes called a ‘reasonable adjustment’.\n\nBefore your hearing date, contact the court or tribunal on your letter to let them know what you need.\n\nFor example, this could be:\n\nramps or accessible toilets\n\na hearing loop\n\nforms in large print\n\nguidance in audio or easy read formats\n\nThe day of your hearing\n\nWhen you enter the building\n\nWhen you enter a courts or tribunals building, your bags and pockets will be checked like they would be at an airport. This may include:\n\nhanding over your bag for it to be checked\n\nemptying your pockets into a tray\n\ntaking off your shoes, coat, gloves, hat or belt\n\nwalking through an archway detector\n\nbeing checked with a handheld scanner\n\nYou may be asked to leave certain items with security staff – you’ll get them back when you leave.\n\nA member of staff will call you into the hearing room and show you where to sit.\n\nWhat to do during the hearing\n\nYou must silence all calls and notifications on mobile devices when you are in the hearing room.\n\nYou can take notes but you must not take photos or videos.\n\nWhen a member of staff says ‘all rise’ you must stand up. This means the judge or magistrate is about to come into the room. They will tell you when you can sit down again.\n\nYou can ask a member of staff if you need to take a break at any point during your hearing.\n\nWhat to say at the hearing\n\nAs part of the hearing, someone will explain who will speak and when.\n\nYou’ll be given time to ask questions and give evidence in your case. If you have a solicitor or barrister, they’ll ask questions for you.\n\nIf you’re giving evidence during the hearing you will be asked to swear an oath or make a legally binding promise (known as an affirmation) that your evidence will be true.\n\nThe usher will read out the oath and ask you to repeat the words after them. The relevant holy book will be placed in front of you, but you will not need to touch the book. Affirmations are equally solemn, significant and come with the same responsibilities as a religious oath. If you prefer to affirm, the usher will read out the affirmation and ask you to repeat the words after them.\n\nSpeak clearly and politely to the judge or magistrate. It’s okay to call them ‘judge’ if they are a judge, or ‘sir’ or ‘madam’ if they are a magistrate. You may see some people bow to the judge or magistrate when they walk in or out of the hearing room. You don’t have to do this, but you can if you want to.\n\nAt the end of the hearing\n\nThe judge or magistrate may leave the room to think about their decision. They may make a decision on the day or send it to you by post later.\n\nLeave the building straight away after your hearing, this helps limit the number of people inside at any one time."
