        "text": "Aphasia is when a person has difficulty with their language or speech. It's usually caused by damage to the left side of the brain (for example, after a stroke).\n\nSymptoms of aphasia\n\nPeople with aphasia often have trouble with the 4 main ways people understand and use language.\n\nThese are:\n\nreading\n\nlistening\n\nspeaking\n\ntyping or writing\n\nSpeaking problems are perhaps the most obvious, and people with aphasia may make mistakes with the words they use.\n\nThis could be sometimes using the wrong sounds in a word, choosing the wrong word, or putting words together incorrectly.\n\nAlthough aphasia affects a person's ability to communicate, it doesn't affect their intelligence.\n\nAphasia can occur by itself or alongside other disorders, such as visual difficulties, mobility problems, limb weakness, and problems with memory or thinking skills.\n\nTypes of aphasia\n\nAphasia is often classified as \"expressive\" or \"receptive\", depending on whether there are difficulties with understanding or expressing language, or both.\n\nBut most people with aphasia have some trouble with their speaking, and will have a mixture of problems with writing, reading and perhaps listening.\n\nSymptoms can range widely from getting a few words mixed up to having difficulty with all forms of communication.\n\nSome people are unaware that their speech makes no sense and get frustrated when others don't understand them.\n\nRead more about the different types of aphasia.\n\nCauses of aphasia\n\nAphasia is caused by damage to parts of the brain responsible for understanding and producing language.\n\nCommon causes include:\n\nstroke – the most common cause of aphasia\n\nsevere head injury\n\na brain tumour\n\nprogressive neurological conditions – conditions that cause the brain and nervous system to become damaged over time, such as dementia\n\nAphasia can affect people of all ages, but it's most common in people over the age of 65. This is because strokes and progressive neurological conditions tend to affect older adults.\n\nDiagnosing aphasia\n\nAphasia is usually diagnosed after tests carried out by a clinician – either a speech and language therapist or a doctor. They can also help arrange treatment if necessary.\n\nThese tests often involve simple exercises, such as asking a person to name objects in the room, repeat words and sentences, and read and write.\n\nThe aim of these tests is to understand a person's ability to:\n\nunderstand basic speech and grammar\n\nexpress words, phrases and sentences\n\nsocially communicate – for example, hold a conversation or understand a joke\n\nread and write letters, words and sentences\n\nImaging techniques such as a CT scan or MRI scan can be used to assess brain damage.\n\nTreating aphasia\n\nSpeech and language therapy is the main type of treatment for people with aphasia.\n\nThis aims to help restore some of your ability to communicate, as well as help you develop alternative ways of communicating, if necessary.\n\nYou may receive speech and language therapy on an individual basis or in a group, depending on your needs and the service provided.\n\nAn increasing number of computer-based applications are available to support people with aphasia.\n\nBut it's important to start using these with the assistance of a speech and language therapist.\n\nHow successful treatment is differs from person to person. Most people with aphasia make some degree of recovery, and some recover fully.\n\nIf the aphasia is caused by a one-off event, like a stroke, most patients recover to some degree with therapy. There's no evidence to suggest that recovery stops at a specific time after stroke.\n\nBut the chance of recovery is poorer for people with aphasia resulting from a progressive neurological condition.\n\nSome people can still respond to therapy, but there are currently no good ways of reversing the ongoing injury to the brain.\n\nWhen aphasia is caused by a progressive condition, treatment focuses on making the most of what people can still do and developing other ways of communicating to prepare for a time when speaking will be more difficult.\n\nRead more about treating aphasia."
