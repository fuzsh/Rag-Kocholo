        "text": "Adhya and Bhabhi were engaged in conversation, absorbed in something on Adhya's tablet. At the sound of my footsteps, they looked up. The sight of my blood-soaked attire caused them to freeze. Adhya's eyes met mine, and a shudder ran through her as she saw the intensity and emptiness in my gaze.\n\nWithout acknowledging their presence, I moved past them and ascended the stairs to our floor. I heard hurried footsteps behind me, unmistakably Adhya's. She was following me, her concern evident in her hurried pace.\n\nReaching our room, I entered without a word and shut the door behind me. I made a beeline for the bathroom, my mind set on cleansing myself from the remnants of my fury. I turned on the shower, letting the water cascade down as I stood with my hands pressed against the wall.\n\nThe hot water streamed over me, soaking through my clothes and washing away the blood. The rhythmic sound of the water filled the space, mingling with the echoes of my earlier violence. As I stood there, the adrenaline began to ebb away, leaving me with a profound sense of exhaustion and relief.\n\nThe water continued to pour over me, each drop a step toward shedding the remnants of my rage and focusing on the task ahead. My mind raced with thoughts of what needed to be done, but for now, I allowed myself this moment of solitude and cleansing.\n\nAfter cleaning myself, I stepped out of the shower and into the closet. Adhya was waiting there, her face etched with concern. I began dressing, purposefully ignoring her presence. My focus was on the task at hand, not on addressing her questions or concerns at the moment.\n\n\"Rudra, are you okay?\" Adhya's voice broke through the silence. I didn't respond; right now, I was too lost in my own turmoil to offer any reassurance. I moved toward the door, but she stepped in front of me, effectively blocking my path. Her gaze fell on my bruised knuckles, and a look of distress crossed her face.\n\n\"How did this happen?\" she asked softly, her voice tinged with worry. She reached out and took my hand in hers, but I remained silent, unable to offer her any explanation. Her frustration was palpable as she shook her head, clearly hurt by my lack of response.\n\nSighing deeply, Adhya guided me back to the room, taking a first aid kit along the way. She gently made me sit on the edge of the bed and took a seat beside me. Her movements were tender and careful as she began to clean and tend to my bruised knuckles.\n\nAs she worked, tears began to stream down her cheeks. It was clear that the sight of my injuries, coupled with the emotional strain of the situation, was deeply affecting her. Each gentle stroke as she cleaned the wounds seemed to mirror the ache in her heart. Her pain was evident, and it broke through the barriers I had tried to maintain.\n\n\"I'm okay,\" I finally said, my voice soft but firm. Adhya raised her head, her eyes meeting mine with a mixture of frustration and relief. The intensity in her gaze made me smile, a rare moment of lightness amid the heaviness.\n\nI reached out and pulled her into a tight embrace, burying my face in her neck. It was in these moments with her that I found solace, a brief escape from the turmoil that had consumed me. Her warmth enveloped me, providing a comfort that nothing else could match.\n\nAs I held her close, my arms tightened around her, seeking the reassurance and calm she always seemed to offer. Her fingers began to move gently through my hair, a soothing rhythm that instantly eased some of the tension I was feeling. The simple act of her touch, combined with the steady beat of her heart against mine, helped to ground me and bring a sense of peace.\n\nIn her embrace, the chaotic world outside seemed to fade away. I could feel her breath against my skin, steady and calming, and for a moment, everything felt right again.\n\nAfter some time, Adhya tried to pull away from our embrace, but I held her tightly, reluctant to let go. With a resigned sigh, I finally released her. Just then, a knock on the door interrupted our moment. Adhya went to answer it and found the butler standing there. He informed us that dinner was ready and then left.\n\nA minute later, we walked to the dining area. As we entered, everyone's gaze fell on my bandaged knuckles, and a collective sigh of concern filled the room. My father was about to ask questions, but Adhya discreetly signaled him to hold off. I took my seat at the table, and Adhya began serving me food. The meal was consumed in silence, the atmosphere heavy with unspoken tension.\n\nOnce I finished eating, I cleared my throat to gather everyone's attention. The room fell quiet as they looked to me. With a commanding tone, I announced, \"After three days, Adhya's crowning ceremony will be held.\" The statement was more than an announcement .\n\n**********************\n\nShare your views on chapter...\n\nShaurya Malhotra?
