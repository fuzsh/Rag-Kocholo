        "text": "What is coronavirus?\n\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They are called “corona” because of crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.\n\nThe new strain of coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has since spread to every country around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhere do coronaviruses come from?\n\nCoronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live in but don’t infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate) as they transfer to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and begin to infect humans. In the case of SARS-CoV-19, the first people infected are thought to have contracted the virus at a food market that sold meat, fish and live animals.\n\nHow do you get COVID-19?\n\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or from the transfer of the virus from your hands to your face). It then travels to the back of your nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves into lung tissue. From there, the virus can spread to other body tissues.\n\nHow does the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spread from person to person?\n\nCoronavirus is likely spread:\n\nThe virus travels in respiratory droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you. You may be infected if you inhale these droplets.\n\nYou can also get coronavirus from close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person and then touching your face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow long is a person with COVID-19 considered contagious?\n\nIf you have COVID-19 it can take several days to develop symptoms — but you’re contagious during this time. You are no longer contagious 10 days after your symptoms began.\n\nThe best way to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others is to:\n\nStay 6 feet away from others whenever possible.\n\nWear a cloth mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.\n\nWash your hands often. If soap isn’t available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\nAvoid crowded indoor spaces. Open windows to bring in outdoor air as much as possible.\n\nStay self-isolated at home if you are feeling ill with symptoms that could be COVID-19 or have a positive test for COVID-19.\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\n\nWho’s most at risk for getting COVID-19?\n\nPersons at greatest risk of contracting COVID-19 include those who:\n\nLive in or have recently traveled to any area with ongoing active spread.\n\nHave had close contact with a person who has a laboratory-confirmed or a suspected case of the COVID-19 virus. Close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.\n\nAre over the age of 60 with pre-existing medical conditions or a weakened immune system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow soon after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 will I develop COVID-19 symptoms?\n\nThe time between becoming infected and showing symptoms (incubation period) can range from two to 14 days. The average time before experiencing symptoms is five days. Symptoms can range in severity from very mild to severe. In about 80% of people, COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms, although this may change as variants emerge.\n\nIf I recover from a case of COVID-19, can I be infected again?\n\nIf you test positive for SARS-CoV-2 three months after your last positive test, it’s considered a reinfection. Before the omicron variant, reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 was rare but possible.\n\nOmicron (B.1.1.529) was first reported in South Africa in November 2021 and quickly spread around the world. With many mutations, omicron was able to evade immune systems and we had more reinfections than ever before.\n\nAs the virus that causes COVID-19 continues to mutate, reinfection remains possible. Vaccination — including a booster dose — is the best protection against severe disease.\n\nHow is coronavirus diagnosed?\n\nCOVID-19 is diagnosed with a laboratory test. Your healthcare provider may collect a sample of your saliva or swab your nose or throat to send for testing.\n\nWhen should I be tested for the coronavirus (COVID-19)?\n\nCall your healthcare provider if you:\n\nFeel sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing.\n\nHave been in close contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.\n\nYour healthcare provider will ask you questions about your symptoms and tell you if you need to be tested for COVID-19.\n\nIf I have a positive test for coronavirus, how long should I self-isolate?\n\nAccording to current CDC recommendations, you should self-isolate until you've met both of the following criteria:\n\nIt's been five days since your symptoms first appeared and your symptoms are improving.\n\nYou've not had a fever for 24 hours and you've not used fever-lowing medications during this time.\n\nWhile at home, self-isolate within a separate room of your home if possible to limit interaction with other family members. If you can’t stay 100% isolated in a separate room, keep 6 feet away from others and wear a cloth mask, wash your/family members' hands often and frequently disinfect commonly touched surfaces and shared areas.\n\nYou don't need to be retested after your period of self-isolation. But every case is unique, so follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for testing.\n\nIf you have a weakened immune system or have had a severe case of COVID-19, the CDC's criteria don’t apply to you. You may need to stay home for up to 20 days after your symptoms first appeared. Talk with your healthcare provider about your situation.\n\nHow long do I need to isolate myself if I’ve been around a person with COVID-19?\n\nYou should quarantine for five days if:\n\nYou haven’t been fully vaccinated.\n\nMore than six months have gone by since your second vaccine dose and you haven’t been boosted.\n\nAfter this time, you should wear a well-fitting mask whenever you’re around others for an additional five days. The CDC recommends testing on day five if possible. This quarantine period may vary depending on variant strains and the availability of testing.\n\nIs it possible to test negative for coronavirus and still be infected with it?\n\nYes, it’s possible. There are several reasons for “false negative” test results — meaning you really do have COVID-19 although the test result says you don’t.\n\nReasons for a false negative COVID-19 test result include:\n\nYou were tested too early in the course of illness. The virus hasn’t multiplied in your body to the level that it could be detected by the test.\n\nThe swab didn’t get a good specimen. You or the healthcare personnel may not have swabbed deeply enough in your nasal cavity to collect a good sample. There could also be less likely handling errors and transportation errors.\n\nThe test itself was not sensitive or specific enough to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Sensitivity refers to the ability of the test to detect the smallest amount of virus. Specificity refers to the ability of the test to detect only the COVID-19 virus and not other similar viruses. Many different commercial and hospital laboratories have developed tests for SARS-CoV-2. All must meet standards, but there’s always the possibility of “false negative” and “false positive” tests.\n\nIf you think you might have COVID-19 even if your test is negative, it’s best to follow the current CDC recommendations. Stay home for 10 days if you think you are sick (“social distancing”). Stay 6 feet away from others (“physical distancing”) and wear a cloth mask. Contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms worsen. Don’t decide on your own if it’s safe for you to be around others. Instead, contact your healthcare provider when your symptoms improve."
