SOME of the most enduring images of the British Empire in the popular imagination have come from films. Some of these films are of average quality and imperfect in their historical accuracy, but many are excellent and effectively recreate the environment and compelling issues that people living in different parts of the empire faced at various points in their history. And since films are the media through which much of the general public gain their impressions of the British Empire, they are worthy of consideration by historians for that reason alone.

Below is a selection of films useful for complementing our study of the history of the British Empire. Most of these films are available on DVD or Blu-Ray at Watzek Library. You can also find many of them on streaming services. In addition to this list, Colonial Film: Moving Images of the British Empire holds detailed information on over 6000 films showing images of life in the British colonies. Over 150 films are available for viewing online.

GUNGA DIN

Director: George Stevens, 1939

This classic film, starring Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks jr, was one of the very first Hollywood depictions of India. Set in the nineteenth century, three British soldiers and a native waterbearer must stop a secret revival of the murderous "Thuggee" cult before it can spread across the land. The film is based very loosely on Rudyard Kipling's 1892 ballad of the same name (though it is more like The Three Musketeers) and is interesting for its stereotypes as much as for its story.

SHATRANJ KE KHILARI | THE CHESS PLAYERS

Director: Satyajit Ray, 1977

In 1856, officials of the East India Company move to consolidate their hold over North India by annexing the wealthy kingdom of Awadh.

THE RISING: THE BALLAD OF MANGAL PANDEY

Director: Ketan Mehta, 2005

This Bollywood epic is the first major film to focus on the 1857 Indian Rebellionor "Mutiny" as it is usually referred to in British history. The story follows the rebel leader Mangal Pandey, an Indian sepoy in the service of the East India Company, and his friendship with a British officer.

Director: Shyam Benegal, 1979

The plot is further complicated when British forces return seeking vengeance for the mutiny.

THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH

Director: Ferdinand Fairfax, 1985

This miniseries recounts the tragic story of the Scott expedition's failed attempt in 1911 to be the first to reach the South Pole. Their arrival at the pole five weeks after Roald Amundsen's Norwegian team was demoralizing enough, but the return journey proved even worse. After his death, Capt. Robert Scott was lionized as an Edwardian hero but in recent years his leadership and personality have been questioned. This series, beautifully filmed in Greenland, offers a much less flattering portrayal of Scott than the glorified image in the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic.

Elspeth and her unconventional parents decide to settle down in British East Africa and begin a coffee plantation.

GALLIPOLI

Director: Peter Weir, 1981

In 1915, Archy and Frank meet at a sprinting competition in Western Australia and decide to join the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps (the "ANZACs"). A few months later they land at Gallipoli on the Turkish coast and participate in one of the most disastrous British campaigns of the First World War. This is one of the best film portrayals of the horrors of war and the waste of young lives. It also gives insight into a distinctly anti-British sense of Australian nationalism that arose after this war.

LAWRENCE OF ARABIA

Director: David Lean, 1962

This is a classic film about T.E. Lawrence, a young officer assigned to the British Foreign Office in Cairo during the First World War. Lawrence is given the task of riding into the Arabian Desert to unite the various Bedouin tribes against the Turkish forces (which are allied with Germany). The film is a highly romanticized portrayal of Lawrence's campaign and has been the subject of much controversy among historians and cultural critics. Based loosely on Lawrence's 1922 memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

THE LAST SEPTEMBER

Director: Deborah Warner, 1999

Set in Co. Cork in 1920, this film revolves around the lives and romantic complications of an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family living on their estate in the midst of the Irish war for independence.

THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY

Director: Ken Loach, 2006

This film won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.

THE LONG DUEL

Director: Ken Annakin, 1967

Set in the 1920s, this film is based very loosely on the true exploits of the notorious Bhanta dacoit, Sultana, and the colonial police officer, Freddy Young, whose mission it was to capture him. Sultana (Yul Brynner) and Young (Trevor Howard) develop a strong respect for each other during their game of evasion and pursuit across the hills and plains of North India. However, the portrayal of Sultana as a nationalist rebel and Young as ambivalent toward British imperialism in India is historically inaccurate.

MISTER JOHNSON

Director: Bruce Beresford, 1991

Set in colonial Nigeria in 1923, this film tells the story of Harry Rudbeck, an ambitious magistrate who wants to build a road connecting his backwater post to the outside world. Struggling to find ways around colonial bureaucracy, he relies on his resourceful African clerk, Mr. Johnson. Yet Johnson is an oddity: an educated black man who does not really fit in with either his fellow Africans or the British. Based on the 1952 novel by Anglo-Irish writer Joyce Cary.

SANDERS OF THE RIVER

Director: Zoltan Korda, 1935

A British district officer in 1930s Nigeria governs his area strictly but justly and, with the aid of a loyal native chief, takes on local gunrunners and slavers. The chief was played by African-American actor and activist Paul Robeson who later became so disillusioned with the editing that he publically disowned the film and attempted, unsuccessfully, to buy back all the prints to prevent it from ever being shown. The film is based on the stories of Edgar Wallace.

THE RIVER

Director: Jean Renoir, 1951

This coming of age story revolves around Harriet, the daughter of an English jute mill owner, who lives in a house on the banks of the Ganges. Harriet's family life and friendships immerse her in a world that blends Indian and western culture. Based on the 1946 novel by Margaret Rumer Godden, The River was the first Technicolor film made in India. Martin Scorsese saw this film as a child and it had a profound effect on his later development as a filmmaker. Satyajit Ray, the great Bengali director, also cited The River as a major influence on his style of filmmaking.

BLACK NARCISSUS

Directors: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1947

This strange and haunting film focuses on a group of Anglican nuns who arrive in a remote location in the Himalayas to set up a school and clinic for the local residents. The fragmentation and collapse of their own community force them to abandon the mission. The film was released a few months before Indias independence and some critics speculate that the plot is an allegory about Britains retreat from India. Based on the 1939 novel by Margaret Rumer Godden.

NIRGENDWO IN AFRIKA | NOWHERE IN AFRICA

Director: Caroline Link, 2001

In the late 1930s, a Jewish family, the Redlichs, reluctantly emigrate from Germany to British East Africa to manage a farm.

They soon find themselves treated more humanely by Africans than they ever were in the supposedly civilized Europe from which they fled. Based on the 1995 autobiographical novel by Stefanie Zweig.

RABBIT-PROOF FENCE

Director: Phillip Noyce, 2002

In 1905 the Australian government authorized the forcible removal of aboriginal children from their mothers' care and sent them hundreds of miles away to schools designed to stamp out their culture and train them for domestic service. This film tells the true story of three girls who in 1931 escaped and found their way home over a thousand miles of outback. These children were part of what have come to be known as the "stolen generations" and remains a dark chapter in Australian and imperial history.

MALTA STORY

Director: Brian Desmond Hurst, 1953

This film focuses on the heroic defense of Malta, the British Empire's vital fortress colony in the Mediterranean, during the Second World War. While the plot focuses on the exploits of a British reconnaissance pilot stationed on the island and his romance with a young Maltese woman, much attention is given to the courage of the Maltese people themselves in successfully withstanding one of the longest and most destructive bombardment campaigns of the war.

BOSE, THE FORGOTTEN HERO

Director: Shyam Benegal, 2005

This film focuses on the final years in the life of Subhas Chandra Bose, one of the most controversial figures in Indian nationalism. A rising star in the freedom movement, Bose fell out with Gandhi and was pushed to the margins of Congress politics. At the outbreak of war in 1939, he fled to Germany and later conspired with Japanese forces to lead an army of Indian soldiers against the British during the Burma campaign. Bose remains a hero to many Indians, especially in his native Bengal.

EARTH

Director: Deepa Mehta, 1998

The movie opens in the city of Lahore in Punjab in 1947 before India and Pakistan became independent.

Based on the 1988 semi-autobiographical novel The Ice Candy Man by Bapsi Sidhwa.

VICEROY'S HOUSE

Director: Director: Gurinder Chadha, 2017

The transfer of power and partition of India and Pakistan told largely through the experiences of the house staff at the stately New Delhi residence of the viceroy following the arrival of Lord and Lady Mountbatten in early 1947. As the clock ticks down to independence, the servants prepare for an uncertain future for themselves and their families. This film was lambasted by historians for the unsupported premise that partition was conceived as a conspiracy by Churchill's wartime government to contain postwar Soviet expansion into the oil-rich Middle East.

PINJAR

Director: Chandra Prakash Dwivedi, 2003

Lajjo is a recently married Hindu woman abducted by Muslims during the chaos of partition and taken to Pakistan. There she is forced to become the second wife of an abusive and controlling alcoholic.

COTTON MARY

Directors: Ismail Merchant and Madhur Jaffrey, 1999

In 1954, seven years after India has gained independence from Britain, many Indians still feel like second-class citizens in their own country, as the nation's sovereignty has not immediately erased the perception that the British are superior to Indians. An example is Cotton Mary, an Anglo-Indian nurse in the employment of the wife of a BBC correspondent. Mary claims she is the daughter of a British army officer (although she has no firm evidence) and views herself as more British than Indian.

GUNS AT BATASI

Director: John Guillermin, 1964

Regimental Sergeant-Major Lauderdale is an old-school martinet assigned with other British NCOs and officers to a remote African outpost to train soldiers of a newly independent former colony (a thinly veiled Kenya).

Released in 1964, at the height of decolonization, this film is a useful artifact of British feelings about the end of their empire.

AN UNGENTLEMANLY ACT

Director: Stuart Urban, 1992

As Argentine forces land on the eastern island and make their way towards the town of Stanley, a detachment of Royal Marines prepares to defend the governor, his family, and their fellow islanders from the invaders.

ILUMINADOS POR EL FUEGO | BLESSED BY FIRE

Director: Tristán Bauer, 2005

This Argentine film tells the story of the Falklands War through a series of flashbacks among veterans living with the scars of their country's "unwinnable" war. The plot takes the men back to their foxholes on the windswept and desolate Malvinas (Falklands) during the harrowing battles they fought with British forces sent to retake the islands. Victory in the Falklands revived Britain's pride in its former empire and was in some sense a redemption from the humiliation of the Suez crisis of 1956.
