        "text": "Largely unsatisfying remake of Cocteau's LES PARENTS TERRIBLES in an English setting. Enoch is a young boy who falls in love with father Warrender's mistress. The mother (Spencer) fears she'll lose her son as well as her husband, but Warrender sacrifices his own happiness for his son. Dunning is the aunt, secretly in love with Warrender, who settles the peace. The film is too talky and constricted by stage motifs. Enoch and Albiin, the mistress, do have a nice chemistry, though."
