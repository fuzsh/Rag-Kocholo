Family ties are stretched to breaking point, and the mother fears she'll lose her son as well as her husband.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nHarold Warrender as George\n\nMarian Spencer as Yvonne\n\nRuth Dunning as Leonie\n\nWilliam Russell as Michael (as Enoch Russell)\n\nElsie Albiin as Madeline (as Elsy Albin)\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New York Times's review concluded \"the film's highlight, one superbly conceived and well-performed scene with the father and girl at loggerheads over the boy. As we contend, the author does know better. He has perceptively hammerlocked youth and age, and until the half-way mark, the above-mentioned encounter, the quandary is genuinely intriguing. But M. Cocteau's triumphant rattling of the Oedipus legend tilts the apple cart, and some of his own dialogue provides the best summary. \"What a nightmare!\" moans Miss Spencer at one point. Mr. Warrender: \"You're telling me\" ;[4] and TV Guide wrote \"the film is too talky and constricted by stage motifs. Enoch and Albiin, the mistress, do have a nice chemistry, though.\"[2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
