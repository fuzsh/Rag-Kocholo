        "meta_description": "Intimate Relations: Directed by Charles Frank. With Harold Warrender, Marian Spencer, Ruth Dunning, William Russell. Based on the play by Jean Cocteau, and looking like a play as all the action takes place indoors, a neurotic mother almost devours a son with smothering, possessive and misdirected love. When she learns that he is in love with a young girl, she moves to break up the romance. Complications arise when it is discovered that the girl, not knowing of the relationship, had also been in love with the boy's father.",

        "text": "This British version of Cocteau did good business on the strength of it's 'X' certificate and saucy title.\n\nNaturally critically it was a sitting target and reviled as a calamitous mistake (mainly by people who hadn't actually bothered to see it), but Cocteau actually quite liked it and thought it a considerable improvement on the 1948 version.\n\nThe use of friction between two middle-aged to provide the story's driving force is a welcome novelty. The atrocious sound recording simply heightens the theatricality of the piece (a cupboard that loudly creaks opens at inopportune moments is a nice touch); while the framed photographs of the son at different ages liberally scattered about the room provide an ironic commentary on the present events.\n\nThe whimsical tone is established at the outset by a tongue-in-disclaimer that the events depicted could only happen abroad. The setting is explicitly identified as Paris, but all but one of the cast speak impeccable English and apart from an obviously painted Sacre Couer seen through the young hero's window and a kitsch accordion score by Rene Cloeric that's all folks.\n\nThat one character is a diabetic shooting up on insulin is probably a discreet reference to Cocteau's own penchant for drugs."
