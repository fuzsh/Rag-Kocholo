        "text": "Romantic Relationships in Young Adulthood and Their Developmental Antecedents\n\nThe challenge of determining what constitutes normative romantic development in young adulthood is recent. In previous decades, this development was both clear and uniform, with young adults launched from their family of origin into a committed relationship that represented their entry into adulthood (Duvall, 1962). Whereas marriage used to represent a first step into adulthood, dramatic changes in the sequencing and timing of interpersonal partnerships and parenthood over the last few decades of American family life coupled, with the rising focus on self-development, have pushed the marriage milestone further into adulthood (Cherlin, 2009). Though young adults still value marriage (Scott et al., 2009), most no longer appear to be willing to commit to a relationship before they fully explore their options. This has not only given rise to unprecedented variability in young adult romantic experiences, a trend clearly illustrated by the five unique romantic profiles found here, but it suggests that the definition of normative needs to be revised.\n\nPerhaps most illustrative of the sociodemographic shifts experienced in today's society was that the most prevalent romantic relationship profile in this sample was the later involvement cluster—young adults who postponed the pursuit of a serious relationship well into their midtwenties, if not later for some (9.4% of the sample had yet to report a romantic relationship of at least 3 months in duration by age 25). This pattern's prevalence, which corresponds with its prevalence in Meier and Allen's (2009) study of adolescent relationships, dovetails nicely with Cherlin's (2009) assertion that a committed relationship now often represents the last step into adulthood rather than the first. Although such individuals appear to be fairly normative both in the current sample and according to Cherlin, their delayed entry into a committed relationship is nonnormative according to previous studies proposing these individuals should have achieved this milestone years earlier (Collins, 2003; Seiffge-Krenke, 2003). This later involvement, however, may reflect a focus on achieving other developmental tasks before this one. For example, although women who pursue higher education are more likely to delay marriage, they are also more likely to eventually marry (Goldstein & Kenney, 2001). This delay may simply be that and not reflective of an overall reduced capacity for intimacy. However, recent work has suggested that individuals who delay romantic activity in young adulthood are less likely to achieve success in other key domains (Lehnart et al., 2010; Seiffge-Krenke, 2010).\n\nPossibly shedding light on whether this lack of serious romantic relationship involvement is problematic are the developmental antecedents of noninvolvement. Romantic activity delays may signify the larger problem of a difficulty relating to other individuals, as less involvement in romantic relationships, which characterized those in both the later and sporadic involvement clusters, was related to both lower observed mother–child relationship quality and less friendship support in adolescence. Our analyses suggest these represent persistent patterns of difficulty in the family and peer domains that go back to early childhood. This history may have made these individuals feel less confident to establish healthy, outside relationships (Englund, Kuo, Puig, & Collins, 2011). It may also be the case that these individuals had personality or social characteristics that made it difficult for them to establish and maintain healthy romantic relationships. Thus, although young adults in the sporadic involvement cluster initiated romantic relationships earlier than did those with later involvement and thus could be considered more successful by some standards (Seiffge-Krenke, 2010), they had difficulty maintaining this involvement across young adulthood. It may be, then, that it is not the delay in romantic relationship activity itself that is problematic but rather that individuals who had difficulty in connecting competently with others earlier in life continue to have these difficulties in the romantic domain as adults, especially if these problems with parents and peers persist across multiple developmental periods.\n\nThe rather abbreviated romantic relationship history of those in the lower involvement clusters may also owe to the disproportionate number of males in these clusters. A national study revealed that young men are not only less likely to be in a romantic relationship in comparison to young women, but they are also less likely to consider lifelong commitment as a critical component of a successful relationship (Scott et al., 2009). Thus, it is less surprising that young men may not be as interested in pursuing a long-term relationship (Wood et al., 2008). Though these delays in romantic involvement may be expected, Seiffge-Krenke (2010) found men who stayed single from ages 20 to 28 experienced substantial declines in their self-esteem. Interestingly, women who remained single had relatively stable self-esteem. This suggests that although young men profess to not be as interested in serious, committed relationships as are women and behave accordingly, spending a significant portion of one's young adulthood single may have consequences down the road. Even for men, romantic relationships represent an important and vital connection to others.\n\nIt thus appears that the timing of romantic relationship activity cannot be the only measure by which we evaluate romantic success. Delays in commitment for those who established healthy connections with others early in life may be of an entirely different nature, as indicated by those with frequent and steady involvement. These young adults had not yet progressed to the serious commitment seen in the long-term committeds but they did have a high level of involvement in romantic relationships, which may reflect a history of high-quality relationships with family and peers. Interestingly, despite more consistent participation in romantic relationships, these individuals switched partners across the study period as much as did those with sporadic involvement and far more often than did those with later involvement or the long-term committeds. Though romantic turnover can be traumatic (Simpson, 1987), these dissolutions did not appear to deter these young adults from the pursuit of intimacy. Looking at the antecedents, it may be that these individuals are more embedded in their peer networks, not only giving them access to a wider range of potential romantic partners (Furman, 1999) but also perhaps reflecting a tendency to gravitate toward relationships of all types (Cavanagh, 2007). The fact that these seemingly less stable relationships are likely to become more common in the future (Wood et al., 2008) does not necessarily warrant heightened concern, because a lack of early commitment may be problematic only when it represents a full abstention from romantic relationship activity and other key developmental tasks. This echoes Seiffge-Krenke's (2003) conclusion that greater involvement in early romantic relationships, regardless of how many partners it involves, should lead to eventual positive romantic outcomes, as it provides individuals with valuable learning experiences they can apply to later romantic relationships.\n\nIf delaying serious romantic involvement now appears to represent the normative course of development for young adults, what about those who adhere more closely to the theoretically expected progression to a single, committed relationship (Seiffge-Krenke, 2003)? Representing approximately one fifth of the analytic sample, the long-term committeds appeared to buck the trend of postponing key markers of adult status, as evidenced by their earlier entry into marriage and parenthood compared to other young adults in this sample and to national trends (Mathews & Hamilton, 2009). What contributed to this earlier entry into adulthood? Strong relationships with family and peers earlier in life coupled with less deviant friends may have fostered earlier commitment. Attachment theory suggests that the high-quality parent– child and peer relationships they experienced earlier in life likely enabled them to not only establish but also maintain healthy, committed romantic relationships as young adults (Hazan & Shaver, 1987). Thus, what differentiates these young adults from those with later and sporadic involvement is that although none may be very comfortable interacting with multiple romantic partners, the long-term committeds have developed the social skills early on that are necessary to sustain a romantic relationship once they do initiate romantic activity with their chosen partner. It is also possible that personality differences in social anxiety and preference for stability contributed to the divergent paths of the two groups, a question addressable in future studies."
