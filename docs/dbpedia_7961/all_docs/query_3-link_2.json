At the same time, George, Michael's father, confides in Yvonne's sister, Leo, that he is in fact Madeleine's other lover. Together, they hatch a plot to end Madeleine's hopes of marriage - by threatening to reveal George's scandalous secret to his son.",

        "text": "Every drama takes place in mother's bedroom, the scene of the crime.\n\nA fascinating rarity â€“ the first British adaptation of Jean Cocteau brings manipulations, sniping and incisive dialogue delivered with bite, and a camera that can't help but swoon back to innocuous family photos to pervert the action onscreen.\n\nMarian Spencer is marvellous as a malevolent matriarch controlling her son with hysterical outbursts and and incestuous possessiveness. I also loved Ruth Dunning as her sister manoeuvring the other characters around their insular (stagebound) chess board."
