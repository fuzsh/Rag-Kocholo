        "text": "Education and Early Career\n\nAlfred Charles Kinsey was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, June 23, 1894. He attended Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine (1914-1916), graduating magna cum laude with a B.S. in biology and psychology. He received his Sc.D. in biology from Harvard University in September 1919.\n\nDr. Kinsey arrived at Indiana University in 1920 as an assistant professor of zoology. For the next 20 years, Kinsey studied gall wasps, and established a solid academic reputation for his biology tests and his research in taxonomy and evolution. By 1937, American Men of Science listed him as one of their \"starred\" scientists.\n\nDuring his work on gall wasps, Dr. Kinsey developed many of the techniques around recording and organizing data that would come into play in his later research into human sexuality. He took dozens of minute measurements on each tiny wasp, and recorded the data in sheafs of notes, later developing his own coding system for the information - precursors to the detailed sex history questionnaires and recording codes he developed for use by his sex research team.\n\nTransition to Sex Research\n\nIn 1938, the Association of Women students petitioned Indiana University to offer a course on marriage for students who were married or contemplating marriage, part of a nationwide demand for similar courses. Dr. Kinsey, popular with students, was invited to coordinate the new course, \"Marriage and Family,\" restricted to senior and married IU students.\n\nFaced with questions from students about sexuality, Kinsey could find little scientific information on human sexual behavior that was not value-laden or based on small samples from clinical trials. His interest in the topic was piqued by this \"gap in our knowledge,\" and he began collecting sex histories, first from his students, and then from groups and individuals in Bloomington and throughout Indiana.\n\nIn 1940, President Wells gave Kinsey a choice: to continue either with the marriage course or with his sexuality research project. Kinsey chose to concentrate on his sex research, again crisscrossing the United States, this time to conduct sexual behavior interviews. Over the next few years, Dr. Kinsey sought out funding for his research expenses and began gathering a research team.\n\nIn 1947, Dr. Kinsey became the founding director of the new Institute for Sex Reseach (ISR), which published Sexual Behavior in the Human Male in 1948 and the complementary work, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female ,in 1953. The two books were wildly popular, and Dr. Kinsey became an American celebrity mentioned in cartoons, novels, and popular music.\n\nThe Great Collector\n\nDuring his early career as an entomologist and zoologist, Kinsey travelled across North America collecting specimen wasps and the galls from 36 states and parts of Mexico. Altogether he amassed a collection of more than 7.5 million gall wasps that is still available to researchers through the Division of Invertebrate Zoology of the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nIn his personal life, he was known for his collections of both irisis and 78 rpm records. His expansive gardens included over 250 different varieties of irises, some of which he sold to local gardeners and other collectors. A music lover, when the 78 rpm record was introduced, Kinsey began avidly collecting again, building one of the largest private record collections in the Midwest at the time.\n\nWhen he turned his attention to sexology, Dr. Kinsey was no less ambitious, outlining a goal to collect comprehensive sex histories from 100,000 interviewees. The interview questionnaire he designed for his research team included hundreds of questions on every aspect of human sexual behavior. While the average interview lasted a couple of hours, some could run as long as six hours or more. The resulting collection of over 18,000 detailed sex histories has never been matched.\n\nIn Introduction to Biology, Kinsey said about the passion for collecting:\n\n\"If your collection is larger, even a shade larger, than any other like it in the world, that greatly increases your happiness. It shows how complete a work you can accomplish, in what good order you can arrange the specimens, with what surpassing wisdom you can exhibit them, and with what authority you can speak on your subject.\""
