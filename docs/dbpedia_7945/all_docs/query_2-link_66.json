        "text": "At first, Chris Sarandon scoffed when he received the script for the 1985’s “Fright Night,” one of his most well-known roles.\n\n“I thought, ‘Oh, Jesus, I can’t do a horror movie. I’m a great classical actor and I have an Academy Award nomination’ (for 1975’s ‘Dog Day Afternoon’),” recalled Sarandon, of New York, laughing.\n\nStill, Sarandon – who’ll be appearing with “Fright Night” co-star Amanda Bearse at Motor City Nightmares in Novi Sept. 16-18 (see sidebar) – read the script by Tom Holland (who also directed) and was impressed. In it, horror movie buff Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) discovers that his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Sarandon) is a vampire. He tells everyone he can, but they blow him off.\n\nCharley recruits Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), a washed-up actor that played a vampire-hunter in B-movies who now hosts a late-night TV horror anthology series. Peter realizes Charley’s telling the truth. The two join forces to stop Jerry, who has Charley’s girlfriend Amy (Bearse) in his thrall.\n\n“It was a wonderfully collaborative experience because I had some ideas which (Holland) incorporated into the movie,” said Sarandon, who suggested Jerry’s DNA should include a fruit bat. At various points throughout the movie, he’s eating fruit.\n\n“That scene when Jerry’s leaving the house and Charley’s hiding in the bushes, I’m eating an apple and take a big bite out of it. I toss the apple and Tom brilliantly had it roll right up to almost exactly where Charley is in the bushes and there’s this immense, inhuman chunk bitten out of it – it’s a terrifying moment,” he said.\n\n“Fright Night” spawned a 1988 sequel and a 2011 remake with Colin Farrell playing Jerry. Sarandon cameoed in the latter.\n\n“The producers asked me if I wanted to be in it. I wanted to be this guy Jerry devours,” he said. “It’s the passing of the torch: The new Jerry consumes the old Jerry “\n\nSarandon’s role as Det. Mike Norris in 1988’s “Child’s Play” – also written and directed by Holland – was a direct result of “Fright Night.” In this movie, a murderer transfers his soul into a kid’s doll, which comes to life and kills anew. Sarandon’s not surprised “Child’s Play” also became a franchise.\n\n“It’s everyone’s nightmare to have their favorite doll come to life and they milked it for all it’s worth,” he said.\n\nSarandon also spoke about portraying Al Pacino’s transgendered lover in the aforementioned “Dog Day Afternoon,” based on a true story about a bank robbery. Not only was it Sarandon’s film debut, but an auspicious one at that: He was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n“I was bowled over by the prospect that I was among the group of people selected,” he said. “I wasn’t a kid; I was in my early 30s, so I had a healthy perspective on it.”\n\nPerhaps he’s best known for the odious Prince Humperdinck in “The Princess Bride,” 1987’s beloved fantasy adventure-comedy based on William Goldman’s 1973 novel of the same name, which he adapted for the big screen. Sarandon attributed its staying power to a strong screenplay that had an unusual combination of adventure, humor, and romance – all of which appeal to a cross-generational audience.\n\n“People watched it when they were kids and they now watch it with their kids. (They appreciate) different aspects of the movie when they got older, so the movie revealed itself in a way. When you’re very young, the movie’s about what it’s about: a princess, a pirate, a bad prince, a giant, a funny magician, all those elements,” explained Sarandon. “But as you get older, you start appreciating the irony and the humor and also the homage that it paid to movies like it – those old great adventure pictures starring Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn.”\n\nHe’s looking forward to making his Motor City Nightmares debut this weekend.\n\n“It’s interesting because I’m a creature of the theater. I started out in the theater when I was younger,” said Sarandon. “In theater, you have a direct connection with your audience. There’s a give-and-take as it were – it’s not necessarily one in which people talk to you – but there is sort of a symbiotic relationship. When you’re making a movie or working on a television show, you don’t really have that immediate audience response to what you’re doing and to the work at hand.”\n\nHe continued: “These conventions, in a way – I’ve talked to other actors and they agree – give me a chance to interact with fans, get a sense what kind of effect the work that you do has on people. It’s quite profound. It’s moving and humbling at the same time. I enjoy that interaction very much.”\n\n* If you go: Motor City Nightmares\n\n* This year’s event occurs Friday, Sept. 16, from 5-10 p.m.; Saturday, Sept. 17 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Sunday, Sept. 18, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\n* Gold pass holders get in 30 minutes early.\n\n* Located in the Novi Sheraton, which is at 21111 Haggerty Rd. in Novi.\n\n* Tickets vary from $15 to $150.
