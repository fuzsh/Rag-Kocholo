        "text": "Chris Sarandon: an exhibit around the career and archives around the WVU alumni\n\nOnline and temporary at DL Entryway cases\n\nThe cult classic film Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas originally premiered in 1993. Since then, it has grown in popularity with its whimsical style and tribute to two of the most celebrated holidays of all time. But what does this fantastical film have to do with WVU? This holiday season, we are celebrating the spooky and jolly holidays with West Virginia University Alumnus Chris Sarandon. Known for his role as the speaking voice of Jack Skellington, Chris Sarandon also famously portrays Prince Humperdinck in The Princess Bride and Detective Mike Norris in the horror film Child’s Play. This exhibit is dedicated to Chris Sarandon and the many film artifacts he donated to the West Virginia & Regional History Center. Along with donated material and facts about his career, you can find an interview between Chris Sarandon and WVU Libraries graduate assistant Makenzie Hudson. If you are interested in learning about this West Virginia native’s childhood, film career, time at WVU, and famous roles, please view the online exhibit at https://wvulibraries.wixsite.com/chrissarandonexhibit There will also be a companion temporary display in the WVU Downtown Library entryway cases starting end of October through December.\n\nAbout the exhibit curator:\n\nThis exhibit was researched, designed, and created by West Virginia University graduate student Makenzie Hudson. During her senior year at WVU, Makenzie interned with WVU Libraries and discovered Chris Sarandon’s donated artifacts, including items from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Her love of the film grew into a passion project that was supervised and supported by WVU Libraries Exhibit Coordinator Sally Brown. With the encouragement of the WVU Libraries staff and her family, Makenzie was able to reach out to Chris Sarandon and conducted a phone interview with him. Over the course of a year, this exhibit was planned, designed, and finalized, resulting in several art pieces and an online website that is dynamic and engaging for all audiences."
