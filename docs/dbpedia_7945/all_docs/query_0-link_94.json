        "text": "Character in The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nFictional character\n\nJack SkellingtonThe Nightmare Before Christmas characterFirst appearanceThe Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)Created byTim BurtonVoiced byChris Sarandon[1]\n\nDanny Elfman (singing in film)[1]Full nameJack SkellingtonAliasPumpkin King, Pumpkin JackSpeciesSkeletonGenderMaleSignificant otherSallyOriginHalloween Town\n\nJack Skellington is a character and the protagonist of the 1993 film The Nightmare Before Christmas. He is a tall, sentient skeleton who is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, a fantasy world based solely on the Halloween holiday.[2] Jack is voiced by Chris Sarandon.[1][3] Danny Elfman provided Jack's singing voice in the original film and soundtrack album, with Sarandon providing Jack's speaking and singing voice in subsequent productions.\n\nHis overall appearance is a skeleton dressed in a black pin-striped suit and a bow tie that strongly resembles a bat. Originally, his suit was meant to be completely black, but it blended with the background too well, so it was changed. At the beginning of the film, Jack makes his grand entrance by emerging out of the fountain in Halloween Town's plaza. His last name is a play on the word \"skeleton\". He has a ghost dog named Zero for a pet, who has a small jack-o'-lantern for a nose. He is adored by Sally, a feminine creation of Doctor Finkelstein. The character is a popular design on bags, hats, clothing, umbrellas, belt buckles, pet collars, and other items.[4]\n\nIn The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nJack Skellington is the patron spirit of Halloween, portrayed as being on par with Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny within his own holiday. As a living skeleton, he is supernatural and can remove parts of his body without harm, as is often demonstrated for comic relief. He is the most important of many Halloween spirits, with the implication that their job is to scare people in the real world on Halloween night.\n\nJack, as the \"Pumpkin King\" and master of ceremonies, is in charge of Halloween Town's Halloween celebration. He is loved, respected, and even idolized by the other residents for his role, but he has grown weary of celebrating the same holiday endlessly and is depressed about it. The only one who understands Jack's feelings is a lonely rag doll named Sally. She overhears his singing monologue and feels she can relate to his situation.\n\nOne morning after the usual annual celebration, Jack enters a forest containing portals to other worlds themed around holidays. He discovers Christmas Town and decides that this new experience is what his life was missing. He makes preparations for his own Christmas celebration in Halloween Town and wants to impersonate Santa Claus in the real world. While his intentions are not malicious, Jack does not understand the true spirit of Christmas. Halloween Town plans to give the holidays a macabre makeover. Sally reveals to Jack a bad premonition, but Jack's basic nature is impulsiveness. He does not seem to register contradictory information. By the end of the film, he notices Sally and her determination to help him. He proves that love can be a part of his nature by calling Sally his \"Dearest Friend\", telling Sally that they were meant to be together, embracing his future with her and embracing her.\n\nJack follows the formula of a tragic hero because he begins the story at a lofty position. In spite of all his fame and talent, he yearns for another side of life. While a desire for completeness is not a flaw, his impulsiveness proves to be. He tends to be enthusiastic and inclusive, and his charisma is enough to sway every member of Halloween Town except Sally. His selfish decisions lead to the near destruction of Christmas and himself. The strength of Jack's character is demonstrated by his will to correct his own mistakes.\n\nThe official film soundtrack CD contains an epilogue not in the film, stating that \"many years later\", Santa returned to Halloween Town to visit Jack, where he discovered that Jack had \"four or five skeleton children at hand\" who play together in a xylophone band.\n\nIn video games\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King\n\n[edit]\n\nJack Skellington has been shown to have an extreme hatred for Oogie Boogie as was proven when he spoke of this plan to Lock, Shock, and Barrel, stating to \"leave that no account Oogie Boogie out of this!\" He later finds out that Santa Claus and Sally have been kidnapped by the Boogie Man and are in his underground lair. While trying to save his friends, Jack manages to destroy Oogie and save Christmas.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge\n\n[edit]\n\nTired of using the same old themes over and over on Halloween, Jack Skellington goes to Doctor Finkelstein, who gives him the Soul Robber, an invention that changes shape. Jack decided to leave Halloween Town to get new ideas for Halloween frights. When Jack comes back to town, he finds that Oogie Boogie has been resurrected. Now Jack has to set things right again. Jack dances, fights and sings in this game to attack Oogie Boogie's minions. Jack is portrayed as inept to some degree in this game.\n\nChris Sarandon did both the speaking and singing voice for Jack in this game.\n\nDisney Universe\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Disney Universe\n\nJack Skellington features in the Nightmare Before Christmas downloadable expansion pack which includes Jack Skellington, Sally, Oogie-Boogie, Dr. Finkelstein, and the Mayor as in-game playable costumes. The downloadable content can be bought from console stores (e.g. the PlayStation Store). The package included the costumes of which some could be found in the downloaded level. Unlike the worlds originally in the game which all had 3 chapters, the Nightmare Before Christmas world only had 1 chapter called 'Halloween Graveyard'.\n\nKingdom Hearts series\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kingdom Hearts\n\nJack Skellington appears in four installments of the Kingdom Hearts video game series. He inhabits the world of Halloween Town, where the evil Heartless threatens its denizens. The games' protagonists, Sora, Donald Duck and Goofy, befriend Jack and together they battle the Heartless, and also Oogie Boogie. In combat, Jack uses some of his scary powers with demonstrations of some magic, making him a formidable sorcerer.\n\nChris Sarandon reprises his role for the English version, and Masachika Ichimura provides Jack's Japanese voice.\n\nKingdom Hearts\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kingdom Hearts (video game)\n\nJack Skellington introduces himself to Sora, Goofy, and Donald Duck as the ruler of Halloween Town. Jack plans to use the heart that Finkelstein created to control the seemingly docile Heartless to make a festival called \"Heartless Halloween\" so that Halloween can be frightening, but the idea fails when not only the first experiment cause the Heartless to go berserk, but Oogie Boogie steals the finished heart, and plans to use it to take over Halloween Town. At Oogie's manor, Jack, Sora, and the gang confront him. After Oogie is defeated, Jack finds out that Oogie uses dark orbs as his source of life, which Oogie combines himself with his manor to become a giant boss. Once the gang defeats Oogie once again, and his manor crumbles, revealing Halloween Town's keyhole. Jack is considerably shorter in this game than as he appeared in the movie, though he is still rather tall when compared to the game's protagonists.\n\nChain of Memories\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Created\" from Sora's memories of Halloween Town, when Jack Skellington wanted to ask Doctor Finkelstein what happened when he sniffs the potion that can bring \"true memories\", Heartless appeared. When Jack Skellington had found out that Oogie Boogie had stolen Doc's potion, he must stop him before Oogie drinks the whole potion. They fail to reach him before he does, but they defeat him, as Oogie becomes overwhelmed with fear as a side effect of the potion. Sora becomes worried about what will happen when he discovers his true memories, but Jack reassures him that fear is a sign of a strong heart.\n\nKingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\n\n[edit]\n\nIn this game, Roxas arrives at Halloween Town while Jack is in the middle of brainstorming for Halloween. Jack is having trouble with thinking of things but gets inspiration when he sees Roxas leaving through a Dark Corridor. Time after time, Roxas' adventures through Halloween Town inspire Jack to create such things as balloons filled with spiders, exploding frost pumpkins, and Halloween lanterns. When Roxas is sent to find the source of a terrible drop in heartless population, he finds the town overrun with monsters called Tentaclaws. After seeing Roxas defeating the source of the Tentaclaws, the cannibalistic Leechgrave, Jack invents a terrifying scarecrowish version of Roxas as his centerpiece for that Halloween.\n\nKingdom Hearts II\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kingdom Hearts II\n\nFollowing the film loosely to some degree, out of reference, Jack tries to take Santa Claus's place again. To that end, Jack asks Sora and the gang to help him be Santa's bodyguards. But after fighting the Heartless and Oogie Boogie, who has been resurrected by Maleficent, Santa explains to Jack that they each have a job to do with their respective holidays. Despite this, he begins to wear a Santa suit Sally sewed together for him. In the second trip to Halloween Town, Jack still wears the Santa suit, as he still longs to deliver Christmas presents and feels that it would be rude not to wear the suit Sally worked so hard on. Along with Sora and the gang, he helps defeat Doctor Finkelstein's experiment, who stole Christmas presents from Santa in search of a heart. As a reward for all his hard work and assistance, Santa brings Jack on a ride-along with him in his sleigh for a while. After Santa drops Jack off at Halloween Town, Jack learns the true meaning of Christmas by understanding the act of giving. He dances with Sally in the end, finally realizing all of the gifts she had given to him were all from the heart and wishes to give her something in return. She tells him that the nicest present she could ever ask for is just to be with Jack. Jack responds telling her that she does not even have to ask for that, meaning Jack feels the same way for her. During a cut scene in the end credits, he is shown to be wearing his original suit, suggesting he has taken Santa's previous advice to heart completely, and apparently begins presenting new ideas for next Halloween.\n\nDisney Infinity\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Disney Infinity video game series, Jack appears as part of the second wave of playable characters. He has the ability to scare enemies and throw exploding jack-o'-lanterns. If he rides Ghost Rider's motorcycle, his head will catch on fire, resembling Ghost Rider's flaming head.[5]\n\nDisney Magic Kingdoms\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the world builder game Disney Magic Kingdoms, Jack appears as a playable character to unlock for a limited time.[6]\n\nDisney Mirrorverse\n\n[edit]\n\nAn alternate version of Jack Skellington appears as a playable character in the video game Disney Mirrorverse.[7]\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley\n\n[edit]\n\nJack Skellington was added as a villager to Disney Dreamlight Valley as part of a free update in December 2023, again voiced by Chris Sarandon.\n\nFortnite: Battle Royale\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the 24th of October, 2023, Jack Skellington was added to the game as an Item Shop skin for Fortnitemares 2023 alongside two other crossover skins, Alan Wake and Michael Myers from Halloween to celebrate The Nightmare Before Christmas’s 30th anniversary.
