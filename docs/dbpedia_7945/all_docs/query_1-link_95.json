        "text": "Chris Sarandon in ‘Dog Day Afternoon’ (Everett)\n\n“I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man’s body,” says Leon, the transgender woman played by Chris Sarandon, in Sidney Lumet’s 1975 hostage drama Dog Day Afternoon. No doubt this was the first time that many audience members had heard that expression. As our culture experiences a moment of transgender awareness in television and film — thanks to performers like Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox, as well as shows like Transparent and films such as acclaimed indie Tangerine and the upcoming The Danish Girl — Sarandon’s character seems like a trailblazer, a sympathetic and complex portrayal of a trans woman trying to come to grips with her identity. “Times were very different then,” says Sarandon, “and the culture was not only very homophobic, but also the whole idea of transgenderism was anathema in a way.” On the 40th anniversary of Dog Day Afternoon, Yahoo Movies spoke with Sarandon about his Oscar-nominated film debut as Leon. (A new Blu-ray of the movie is hitting stores on Sept. 21.)\n\nRelated: Why ‘Dog Day Afternoon’ Was Ahead of Its Time\n\nBased on true events (read more about those here), Dog Day Afternoon tells the story of a bank robbery in Brooklyn turned hostage situation. The robber, Vietnam veteran and novice criminal Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), hopes to win back his estranged boyfriend (Sarandon) by stealing money for the sex reassignment surgery Leon can’t afford. (Sonny also calls Leon his wife; however, he uses male pronouns to refer to Leon, who is still using her given male name. To make it more confusing, Sonny also has a legal wife and children whom he left for Leon.) The situation in the bank spirals quickly out of control, with police officers and rowdy bystanders filling the street as Sonny attempts to find his way out of the mess he created. About halfway through the film, the police pull Leon out of a psychiatric hospital — where she’s receiving treatment after a suicide attempt, partly induced by Sonny’s erratic behavior — and urge her to talk some sense into him. Though she is onscreen for just a few minutes, talking first to the police and then to Sonny on the phone, Leon’s presence transforms the film, and allows Pacino’s character to be seen in a more sympathetic light.\n\nAl Pacino in ‘Dog Day Afternoon’ (Everett)\n\nFrom the moment Sarandon auditioned for Dog Day Afternoon, director Sidney Lumet made it clear that Leon should not be a Hollywood caricature. After his first reading with Pacino, Sarandon tells Yahoo Movies, “Sidney took me aside and said, ‘Chrissy, a little less Blanche DuBois, a little more Queens housewife.’ And the light bulb went off immediately. So the next time I did it, that’s the Leon that you see basically onscreen.”\n\nOnce he got the part, Sarandon was interested in meeting real-life transgender women (though, he notes, “the vocabulary was much less sophisticated back then”). A gay friend arranged a dinner party with Sarandon and four twenty-something trans women as guests — all “dressed like middle-class young secretaries,” he recalls — and the actor spent an eye-opening evening listening to their stories. “We sat around and talked for four hours and ate spaghetti and meatballs,” he says. “And it was such an incredibly informative and also transformative evening, just in terms of how I thought about the whole idea of being transgender, what the character that I was playing had gone through. I had very specific conversations with them about, 'When was the first time you dressed up in drag? Did you always know that you were somehow had been born in the wrong sex?' And all of them said, 'Yes.'”\n\nChris Sarandon today.\n\nOne of the trans women told Sarandon that she first knew she wanted to be a woman when she saw Fay Wray in King Kong. “While that didn’t necessarily inform my character, it did give me a sense that there was a very strong identification [among trans women] with troubled female movie stars,” says the actor. “So I kind of thought along those lines — who would I be if I were a movie star? — because that’s probably what Leon fantasized. I did know that a lot of my gay friends were big on Judy Garland. And I think Leon saw himself as something of a tragic figure, for good reason.”\n\nIn building his character, Sarandon looked at photos and listened to voice recordings of the actual person who inspired his character, Elizabeth Eden. To make himself feel more feminine, he grew out his hair, plucked his eyebrows, and walked around the house in clogs, pretending they were high heels. At one point, he decided to put on makeup and walk the streets of New York City “to know what it feels like to be shunned.” To his surprise, “not one f—ing person turned around, not one eyebrow was raised, not one glance,” he says. “I was part of the fabric of New York City. Which was another eye-opener, to say the least.”\n\nWatch the movie’s trailer:\n\nPrior to shooting, Lumet guided the cast through several weeks of rehearsal, during which Sarandon and Pacino — who never actually share the screen in Dog Day Afternoon — practiced together. Leon and Sonny’s big scene is a telephone call, which takes place while Leon is with the police and Sonny is trapped in the bank. During the 14-minute conversation, Sonny explains his motivation for the robbery and assures the police that Leon had no knowledge of his plan. Contrary to some reports, the actors didn’t improvise this scene on camera. In the original draft of Frank Pierson’s screenplay, says Sarandon, “the scene started in a very melodramatic way. It was, ‘You sonuvabitch, how could you have done this to me. You’re killing me.’ Which we got to. But we both felt that in any universal long-term relationship, the bottom line is that when you first speak to each other after a long time, generally you want to know how the other person is. ‘How are you doing? What’s going on?’ And we just started improvising that kind of dialogue to begin the scene, and it led us into the scene that Frank had written, with some changes.” Pierson reworked his original scene based on Sarandon and Pacino’s rehearsals, and drafted the final version to include some of their ad libs.\n\nWatch part of the scene here:\n\nThe shoot itself took only a few days for Sarandon, including his big entrance when Leon faints on the street wearing a hospital robe. (Sarandon still has the robe.) For the telephone scene, he and Pacino filmed separately, with the other actor doing his half of the conversation in a different room. In addition to the scenes he filmed, Sarandon had a day of still photography, during which he posed for a photo (seen in the movie) of Leon in a wedding dress on the day of her marriage to Sonny. “While I was standing there, there were maybe three crew members who came onto me who had no idea that I was a guy,” he recalls proudly. “On the other hand my mom, who saw the picture and just cracked up, asked if she could have it and took it to a family reunion,” he says. “She told my uncles she had been to a wedding in Queens and this was the bride, and all of them, to a man went, ‘Oh my god, what a dog.’\""
