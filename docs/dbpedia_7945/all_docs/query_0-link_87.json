        "text": "He played a transsexual in his first film, a rapist in his second. And now, Chris Sarandon is about to begin a gothic horror film here called “The Sentinel,” in which he plays “a very normal, upstanding heterosexual Manhattan lawyer”—quite a radical departure for an actor who made his reputation playing sexual misfits.\n\nIn “Dog Day Afternoon”the 33‐year‐old Sarandon received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actor for his sensitive, down‐played portrayal of Al Pacino's fluttery, suicidal transsexual “wife,” Leon. And in his second film, “Lipstick,” which was wiped out by most critics as being sleazy and exploitative, Sarandon nevertheless received praise for his role as the clean‐cut. All‐American boy psychotic rapist whose errant ways are brought to a permanent halt by several blasts from victim Margaux Hemingway's shotgun.\n\n“I have covered the sexual spectrum, to say the least,”Sarandon says with a smile as he sits in the sun‐drenched penthouse apartment on Beekman Place that he has sublet from actress Stifle Newman “To be frank,\n\nJudy Klemesrud is a staff reporter for The Times. though, one of the reasons I wanted to do ‘The Sentinel’ was because it was a straight role, a normal role. I had done those two weirdo roles, and this is a nice change, playing a successful Manhattan attorney with a girlfriend. I don't have to be defrazzled for a change.”\n\nSarandon (pronounced suhRAN‐dun) looks more like a Marlboro cowboy than a successful Manhattan attorney as he sits on the sofa, taking an occasional swig from a sweating green bottle of beer. His slender, 6‐foot frame is accentuated by snug‐fitting jeans, which he wears with a blue western‐styled shirt and brown cowboy boots. The area above his upper lip, bare in his previous movies, has sprouted a thick brown mustache. Ask Sarandon why he has been so successful of late, and he is likely to reply with one word: Surprise. “I just refuse to play roles in a ctichdd way,” he explains. “I refused to make Leon, the transsexual, into some sort of screaming queen, because I knew it would just reinforce everything people think drag queens are like. And I said I wouldn't do the part of the rapist in ‘Lipstick’ if he was supposed to he Just some slavering psychotic. My definition of surprise is that it is unpredictable, but at the same time inevitable, If you know what mean. I think characters are they're not cliched, if there is surprise. Usually that's the thing that is remembered most.”\n\nSarandon, whose rapid‐fire conversation is punctuated with dramatic hand gestures and finger jabs, says proudly that he has never had an acting lesson. When asked about his approach to acting, he replies, “I don't know, I just know it when I'm doing it. It's the sort of creative process that changes from film to film, What it boils down to, I guess, is ‘Do your homework.’ I like to talk to a lot of people and observe people before I do a part. I expose myself to a person's life and then let my instincts take over. The more you know about Oe person's life, the better you will be in the role. And whether or not you use all those facts, your audience will get a better sense of the\n\nIn the last few weeks, for example, Sarandon has been hanging out in Manhattan law offices and watching trials down on Centre Street, soaking up how lawyers talk and work. As a result of his research, he has decided to play his character in “The Sentinel” as “a little cool and aloof, totally twitchless and tic‐less, wearing custom‐ tail. ored three‐piece suits and looking very slick.” The film, directed by Michael Winner and co‐starring Cristina Raines, Ma Gardner and Sylvia Miles, has been de. scribed as a cross between “The Exorcist” and “Rosemary's Baby.”\n\nTo prepare for the part of the transsexual in “Dog Day Afternoon,” Sarandon says he had dinner one night with two drag queens, listened to several tapes that were made of the real transsexual the character was based on, plucked his eyebrows, grew and painted his fingernails, and wore women's clothes around his ramshackle, 19thcentury house in Westchester County.\n\n“It was important to me to play the character with a dignified femininity rather than stereotyped swishy,” he says. “I wanted to approach it positively, as a woman trapped in a man's body, which is what a transsexual is. So I said to myself, ‘Play a woman.’ So I spent a couple of days at home alone floating around in loose, flowing clothing and wearing clogs. wanted to get the feeling of how women sit, and how they move. So often, the way women move is caused by what they wear.”\n\nSarandon didn't get a chance to do his usual meticulous research for the role of the rapist in “Lipstick': He had only three days’ notice before he started making the film. “Since there was no time to prepare, what I did Was try to find a way to connect my anger to his anger. And yes, I do have anger, But that is such a complicated process, I really can't describe it in a linear way. What I decided to do with him, what I was trying to get at with him, was the kind of character people look at and say, ‘He's really sweet, he's really nice,’ and then they say, ‘What did he say?’ and then they go on, and he does something else strange. He is a little off. Most people are a little off. Everybody's weird, we all are. Like when I was a kid, I'd eat equal amounts of everything on my plate so I'd finish everything at the same time. Now, that's\n\nSarandon refused to comment on the scathing reviews “Lipstick” has received, on the grounds that he “cannot be objective” about the film. “It's like saying your kid heat up somebody next door. Do you hate your kid?”\n\n“One thing that attracted me to making the film,” he volunteers, “is that it might help some women in this country, women who are up against the wall—housewives in dangerous areas, young working women, senior citizens on the Upper West Side. They're up against the wall because they're scared, afraid to walk out on the street at night, and the reason is that they're not being protected by men—men are the ones who are doing the raping. When I read the script, thought it was an interesting treatment of the subject. It showed the way women ate being exploited, not just by men but by society, too. And I thought, ‘Here's a woman who does something about\n\nDoes that mean he agrees with the ending—that a rape victim is justified in taking the life of a man who raped her? “No, I don't think he got xvhat he deserved.” be says slowly, ‘'Everybody loses when someone decides to take the law into their own hands it should be done by the courts, hitt it isn't., is it? And that's the catch.”\n\nThe movie's rape scene, which was toned down so that it would get an R rather than an X rating, was choreographed by a stunt man and took a week and a half to film. “It was awful,” Sarandon says. “It was a very traumatic experience, both for Margaux and me. It's .a very degrading thing, for a woman to he tied up to a bed like that, with the crew around. And it was degrading for me, because I'm a sensitive human being. The walls were padded during the filming, but still, Margaux was literally covered with bruises. And I cut my lip once when her head hashed up against my mouth.”\n\nSarandon was born in Beckley, West Va., a coal town where his Greek father ran a restaurant called the Eatwell Cafe. Chris studied speech at the state university and went on to get a master's degree at Catholic University, in Washington, D.C., where he met and married Susan Sarandon, an actress who appeared in “The Front Page” and “The Great Waldo Pepper.” They are now sepa, rated.\n\nUnlike most actors. Sarandon never had to endure The Struggle. He landed good acting jobs ,right out of college in the regional theater’ circuit, came to New York to do the TV soap opera. “The Guiding Light,” and made it to Broadway as one of the five brothers in “The Rothschilds.” “I'm one of the fortunate ones,” he says. “I've always earned my living as actor.”\n\nSarandon says lw has no definite goal in life other than, “to he happy,” and in talking to him, it becomes obvious that he seems very 4iappy with the way his life is going right now—with one exception.\n\n“Since ‘Dog Day Afternoon,’ men have been coming on to me,” he says. “They do it in every way that men do it to women, and now know what it's like to be treated as a sex object, that feeling that comes through in ‘Lipstick.’ A lot of people think I'm a homosexual even though I've said in all my interviews that I'm straight. I suppose I could he accused of the lady cloth protest too much, but it's gotten to the point where I'm apologizing for being straight, and it\n\nHe pauses for a long swig of beer. “Someday.” he says evenly, “I hope people will he able to sit hack and have the freedom to say, ‘I'm hopelessly heterosexual’ or ‘I'm gay,’ and that will be the end of it.” ■"
