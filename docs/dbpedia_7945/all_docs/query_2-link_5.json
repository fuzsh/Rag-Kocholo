In the original film, Sarandon only voiced Jack's speaking voice, composer Danny Elfman did Jack's singing. In the video-game spin-off Oogie's Revenge, Sarandon did do Jack's singing. He reprised the role for Jack in many other subsequent Disney productions, such as the video games The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge, the Kingdom Hearts series, and Disney Infinity, along with Halloween Screams and the Haunted Mansion Holiday, at the Disneyland Resort. He also made a cameo as Jay Dee in the Fright Night remake, as a nod to his role in the original.\n\nRoles[]"
