For other uses, see The Nightmare Before Christmas (disambiguation).\n\nThe Nightmare Before ChristmasDirected byHenry SelickScreenplay byCaroline Thompson Adaptation byMichael McDowellBased onstory and characters\n\nby Tim BurtonProduced by\n\nTim Burton\n\nDenise Di Novi\n\nStarringCinematographyPete KozachikEdited byStan WebbMusic byDanny Elfman\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nDistributed byBuena Vista Pictures Distribution[2]\n\nRelease dates\n\nRunning time\n\n76 minutes[3]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$24 million[4]Box office$101.7 million[5]\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy film directed by Henry Selick in his feature directorial debut and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of \"Halloween Town\", who stumbles upon \"Christmas Town\" and schemes to take over the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack.[6] The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix and Ed Ivory.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids\".[1]\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time.[7][8][9][10][11] It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, but lost to Jurassic Park.[12] The film has been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010.\n\nIn 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"[13]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nHalloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and supernatural beings associated with the holiday. Jack Skellington, the well-respected \"Pumpkin King,\" leads the town in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. Unbeknownst to his subjects however, he has grown tired of the same annual routine this year and wants something new. Wandering in the woods the next morning, he discovers several trees containing doors, which lead to other holiday-themed worlds (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, Independence Day, Valentine's Day and Saint Patrick's Day). Stumbling through the one leading to Christmas Town and awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack develops an obsession for it.\n\nJack returns home to share his discovery with his friends and neighbors. They relate to Christmas Town's ruler, Santa Claus, or \"Sandy Claws\" as Jack mistakingly knows him as, but are unfamiliar with the concept of Christmas and conflate its customs with the Halloween traditions that they are used to. Frustrated, Jack isolates himself in his house and studies Christmas further, intent upon finding a way to rationally explain it. When days of study and experimentation accomplish nothing, however, Jack abandons his attempts to understand Christmas and decides to \"improve\" the holiday instead.\n\nJack announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year and assigns Christmas-themed jobs, such as singing carols, making presents and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, to various residents. Sally, the feminine creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision detailing that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her warnings and instructs her to make a Santa Claus suit for him. He also tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa; however, he orders them not to involve his long-time rival and their superior, Oogie Boogie, a bogeyman with a passion for gambling, in their plot.\n\nWhen Lock, Shock and Barrel bring Santa to Halloween Town, Jack tells Santa that he will take care of Christmas this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe. However, they disobey Jack's orders and bring Santa to Oogie, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Meanwhile, despite her best efforts, Sally is unable to stop Jack from proceeding with his plan. As Jack departs to deliver presents in the real world, she attempts to rescue Santa from Oogie, only to be captured herself.\n\nUnbeknownst to Jack at first, his presents terrify the real world's populace, who contact the local authorities and are instructed by them to lock down their homes and residences for protection. When word spreads about Jack's presumed wrongdoings, the military is alerted and Jack is shot down by them, causing him to crash into a nearby cemetery. While the residents of Halloween Town believe that he is dead, Jack actually survived the ordeal. Bemoaning the disaster that he has caused, he realizes that he enjoyed the experience nonetheless, reigniting his love for Halloween, but must act fast to set things right.\n\nUpon returning home, Jack rescues Santa and Sally, then confronts Oogie and defeats him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all of the bugs inside Oogie to spill out and reduce him to nothing. Jack then apologizes to Santa, who scolds him for the trouble he caused, as well as ignoring Sally's warnings. As Santa departs, however, both he and Sally assure Jack that Christmas can still be saved.\n\nSanta resumes his yearly duties as he replaces Jack's presents with genuine ones, while all of Halloween Town celebrates Jack's survival and return. To assure Jack that there are no hard feelings between them, Santa brings a snowfall to the town, thereby bringing the Christmas spirit upon it and, in a way, fulfilling Jack's original dream. The citizens finally realize the true meaning of Christmas, while Jack and Sally declare their love for each other.\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Sarandon (speaking voice) and Danny Elfman (singing voice) as Jack Skellington, a skeleton known as the \"Pumpkin King\" of Halloween Town. Elfman was initially cast as Jack's singing voice and, after the songs were recorded, Sarandon was cast to match Elfman's voice style.[14][15]\n\nElfman also voices:\n\nBarrel, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie.\n\nThe Clown with the Tear-Away Face, a self-described clown who rides a unicycle.\n\nCatherine O'Hara as Sally, a rag doll/Frankenstein's monster-like creation of Finkelstein and Jack's love interest. She is a toxicologist who uses various types of poison to liberate herself from the captivity of her \"father.\" She is also psychic and has premonitions when anything bad is about to happen. O'Hara had previously co-starred in Burton's Beetlejuice.\n\nO'Hara also voices Shock, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie.\n\nWilliam Hickey as Doctor Finkelstein, a mad scientist and the loving but overbearing \"father\" of Sally. He is listed in the credits only as \"Evil Scientist\" and is only mentioned by name twice in the film.\n\nGlenn Shadix as the Mayor of Halloween Town, an enthusiastic leader who conducts town meetings. His head spins between a \"happy\" and \"sad\" face, mirroring his wild mood swings; where some career politicians are described as figuratively two-faced, the mayor is literally so. Shadix and Burton had previously worked on Beetlejuice.\n\nKen Page as Oogie Boogie, a villainous bogeyman in Halloween Town, who has a passion for gambling and rivalry with Jack.\n\nEd Ivory as Santa Claus, the ruler of Christmas Town. Santa is responsible for the annual celebration of Christmas, in which he delivers presents to children in the real world. He is also referred to by Jack and Halloween Town's residents as \"Sandy Claws.\" Ivory also provides the brief narration at the start of the film.\n\nJoe Ranft as Igor, one of Dr Finkelstein's creations and his lab assistant.\n\nPaul Reubens as Lock, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie. Reubens and Burton had previously worked on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Batman Returns.\n\nThe cast also features Kerry Katz, Carmen Twillie, Randy Crenshaw, Lisa Donovan Lukas, Debi Durst, Glenn Walters, Sherwood Ball, John Morris and Greg Proops voicing various characters. Patrick Stewart recorded narration for a prologue and epilogue. While not used in the final film, the narration is included on the soundtrack album.[16]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nAs writer Tim Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. \"Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, […] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before,\" Burton would later recall.[17] After completing his short film Vincent in 1982,[17] Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas.[18] Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price,[19] but also considered other options such as a children's book.[20] He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models;[21][22] Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time.[23] After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special.[21] However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed \"too weird\" to the company.[24] As Disney was unable to \"offer his nocturnal loners enough scope\", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984[19] and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989) for Warner Bros. Pictures.[24]\n\nOver the years, Burton regularly thought about the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights.[25] He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film with the latter as director.[23] Burton's own success with live-action films piqued the interest of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who saw the film as an opportunity to continue the studio's streak of recent successes in feature animation.[26] Disney was looking forward to Nightmare \"to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\"[27] Walt Disney Pictures president David Hoberman believed the film would prove to be a creative achievement for Disney's image, elaborating \"we can think outside the envelope. We can do different and unusual things.\"[26]\n\nNightmare marked Burton's third consecutive film with a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns, and he did not want to be involved with \"the painstakingly slow process of stop motion\".[23] To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs.[4] Elfman found writing Nightmare's eleven songs to be \"one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington.\"[21] Caroline Thompson had yet to be hired to write the screenplay.[4] With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, \"there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually.\"[28]\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nSelick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming.[23][29] Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation.[30] At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming.[31] In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book.[21][28] In addition, Selick stated, \"When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\"[32] Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory.[14] Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack.\n\nOn the direction of the film, Selick reflected, \"It's as though [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films.\"[28] When asked about Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, \"I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total.\"[28] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with digital effects and some second-layering traditional animation.[23] Burton found production somewhat difficult, because he was simultaneously filming Batman Returns and pre-production of Ed Wood.[4]\n\nThe filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having \"around four hundred heads\", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.[33] Sally's mouth movements \"were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, […] only Sally's face 'mask' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronized mouth movements.\"[34] The stop-motion figurine of Jack was reused in James and the Giant Peach (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack.[35]\n\nSoundtracks\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film's soundtrack album was released in 1993 on Walt Disney Records. The film's soundtrack contains bonus tracks, including a longer prologue and an extra epilogue, both narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart. For the film's 2006 re-release in Disney Digital 3-D, a special edition of the soundtrack was released, featuring a bonus disc that contained covers of five of the film's songs by Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, Fiona Apple, and She Wants Revenge. Four original demo tracks by Elfman were also included.[36] On September 30, 2008, Disney released the cover album Nightmare Revisited, featuring artists such as Amy Lee, Flyleaf, Korn, Rise Against, Plain White T's, The All-American Rejects, and many more.[37]\n\nAmerican gothic rock band London After Midnight featured a cover of \"Sally's Song\" on their 1998 album Oddities.\n\nLiLi Roquelin performed a French cover of \"Sally's Song\" on her album Will you hate the rest of the world or will you renew your life? in 2010.\n\nPentatonix released a cover of \"Making Christmas\" for their 2018 Christmas album Christmas Is Here!.[38]\n\nIn 2003, the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday soundtrack CD was released. Although most of the album's songs are not original ones from the film, one song is a medley of \"Making Christmas\", \"What's This?\", and \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\". Other songs included are original holiday songs changed to incorporate the theme of the film. However, the last song is the soundtrack for the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday ride.\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released under Walt Disney Pictures as part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation lineup, but Disney decided to release the film under the studio's adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner, because the studio thought the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids,\" Selick remembered. \"Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.\"[39] To convey Burton's involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.[26] Burton explained that, \"…it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about.\"[4] The film made its world premiere on the opening day celebration of the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993,[40] and was given a limited release on October 13, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29, 1993.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas was reissued under the Walt Disney Pictures label and re-released on October 20, 2006, with conversion to Disney Digital 3-D, and was accompanied by Pixar's short film Knick Knack.[1] Industrial Light & Magic assisted in the process.[30] The film subsequently received three re-releases on October 19, 2007, October 24, 2008, and October 23, 2009.[41] The El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, has been showing the film in 4-D screenings annually in October, ending on Halloween, since 2010.[42] The reissues have led to a reemergence of 3-D films and advances in RealD Cinema.[43][44]\n\nIn October 2020, The Nightmare Before Christmas was re-released in 2,194 theaters. It made $1.323 million over the weekend, finishing fourth behind Tenet.[45] For the film's 30th anniversary and in commemoration of The Walt Disney Company's centennial, it was re-released in theaters across the United States and Canada on October 20, 2023, including engagements in 4DX.[46]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nWith years of successful home video sales, The Nightmare Before Christmas later achieved the ranks of a cult film.[30] Touchstone Home Video first released the film on VHS and LaserDisc (in both deluxe CAV and widescreen editions) on September 30, 1994, and on DVD on December 2, 1997.[47] The Nightmare Before Christmas was released on DVD a second time on October 3, 2000, as a special edition. The release included an audio commentary by Selick and cinematographer Pete Kozachik, a 28-minute making-of documentary, a gallery of concept art, storyboards, test footage and deleted scenes. Burton's Vincent (1982) and Frankenweenie (1984) were also included.[48] Both DVDs were non-anamorphic widescreen releases. The film was released on UMD for PlayStation Portable on October 25, 2005.[49]\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on DVD again (this time with an anamorphic transfer) and on Blu-ray Disc (for the first time) on August 26, 2008, as a two-disc digitally remastered \"collector's edition\", but still containing the same special features.[50][51]\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The Nightmare Before Christmas on Blu-ray 3D on August 30, 2011. The release included a Blu-ray 3D disc, Blu-ray disc and a DVD that includes both a DVD and digital copy of the film.\n\nIn 2018, Disney issued a singalong version of the film, accompanied by the theatrical cut and a Movies Anywhere copy, as a single-disc version for the film's 25th anniversary.[52] The singalong version was also released on Disney+ on September 30, 2022.\n\nIn celebration of its 30th anniversary, the film was remastered in 4K and was released on 4K Blu-ray, including extra content, on August 22, 2023.[53][54]\n\nMarketing\n\n[edit]\n\nDisney has extensively marketed the film and its characters across many forms of media and memorabilia, including action figures, books, games, art crafts, and fashion products. Jack Skellington, Sally, Pajama Jack, and the Mayor have been made into bendable figures,[55] while Jack and Sally even appear in fine art.[56] Sally has been made into an action figure and a Halloween costume.[57]\n\nVarious Disneyland and the branching theme parks host attractions featuring Nightmare characters, particularly during Halloween and Christmas seasons. Since 2001, Disneyland has given its Haunted Mansion Holiday attraction a Nightmare Before Christmas theme for the holiday season. It features characters, decorations and music from the film, in addition to Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party and Mickey's Halloween Party featuring the film's characters.[58] Additionally, Jack hosts the Halloween Screams, HalloWishes, and Not So Spooky Spectacular! fireworks shows at Magic Kingdom (where the host is Ghost Host) and Disneyland (where the host is Jack himself), as well as the Frightfully Fun Parade.[59]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nAround the release of the film, Hoberman was quoted, \"I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn't have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us.\"[21] The film earned $50 million in the United States in its initial theatrical run[41] and was regarded as a moderate sleeper hit.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas made an additional $11.1 million in box office gross in its 2006 reissue.[60] The 2007, 2008, 2009, 2020, and 2023 reissues earned $15.8 million, $2.5 million, $2.3 million, and $10 million, respectively[clarification needed], increasing the film's total box office gross to $101.7 million.[41][61]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 95% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.\"[62] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[63] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[64]\n\nRoger Ebert praised the film's visual inventiveness: \"One of the many pleasures of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is that there is not a single recognizable landscape in it. Everything looks strange and haunting. Even Santa Claus would be difficult to recognize without his red-and-white uniform.\" He wrote that it presented a world \"that is as completely new as the worlds we saw for the first time in such films as Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Star Wars. What all of these films have in common is a visual richness, so abundant they deserve more than one viewing.\" He wrote that \"The songs by Danny Elfman are fun too, a couple of them using lyrics so clever they could be updated from Gilbert & Sullivan. And the choreography, liberated from gravity and reality, has an energy of its own, as when the furniture, the architecture, and the very landscape itself gets in on the act.\" He notes that \"some of the Halloween creatures might be a tad scary for smaller children, but this is the kind of movie older kids will eat up; it has the kind of offbeat, subversive energy that tells them wonderful things are likely to happen.\"[65]\n\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone called it a restoration of \"originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. … It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic.\"[66] James Berardinelli stated \"The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain.\"[67] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film's similarities to the writings of Oscar Wilde and the Brothers Grimm, as well as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and other German Expressionist films.[68]\n\nMichael A. Morrison discusses the influence of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! on the film, writing that Jack parallels the Grinch and Zero parallels Max, the Grinch's dog.[69] Philip Nel writes that the film \"challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters\", contrasting Jack as a \"good trickster\" with Oogie Boogie, whom he also compares with Seuss' Dr. Terwilliker as a bad trickster.[70] Entertainment Weekly reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession, profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick, a couple whose \"degree of obsession with [the] film is so great that … they named their son after the real-life person that a character in the film is based on.\"[71] This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan.[72] Yvonne Tasker notes \"the complex characterization seen in The Nightmare Before Christmas\".[73]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.
