        "text": "Choreographed\n\nBob Saget, Catherine Bell, Chris Sarandon and Bernadette Peters guest star in a case of murder and infidelity - A woman, is found dead in Central Park, and medical examiner Warner (Tamara Tunie) can find no apparent reason for her death. Det. Stabler (Chris Meloni) begins the investigation by himself, talking to the victim's husband, Wesley (Chris Sarandon), who owns a dance troupe, as his friends Glenn (Bob Saget) and Naomi Cheales (Catherine Bell) pay a condolence visit. Stabler's investigation unravels a case of drugs, infidelity and an elaborate plot that impacts everyone involved in the troupe. Attorney Stella Danquiss, who defends Glenn, is played by guest star Bernadette Peters. In this star-studded episode, Stabler also discovers Det. Benson (Mariska Hargitay) is back in town, so he pays her a visit.\n\nNecromancing the Stone\n\nWhen Grams comes to the manor for a Wiccan birthday ceremony, for Wyatt, the sisters find out that she has brought a memory from her past, a former lover who wants to kill the Charmed Ones and bring back the love they once shared.\n\nThe Wheel\n\nThe charred body of a young Asian female is found outside the upscale penthouse of Li Chen (Tzi Ma), the Deputy Counsel General to China. It takes a while to identify the victim, who is a Falon Gong follower named Helen Quan. But the Medical Examiner explains what was initially thought to be a suicide is a homicide since it's evident she was strangled before burned. Tommy Wong (Ken Leung), a driver for an elderly woman in the building is questioned. He initially claims to know nothing but when detectives Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) and Green (Jesse L. Martin) figure out he knew Helen, he admits to that. They then question Chen, who mysteriously has a sculpture by a local artist from Tianjen, China, where Helen's mother is a prisoner."
