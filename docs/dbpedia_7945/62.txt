Christopher "Chris" Sarandon, Jr. is an American actor and voice actor, who is best known for his roles as Prince Humperdinck in the movie The Princess Bride, Jerry Dandrige in Fright Night, and Detective Mike Norris in the first entry of the Child's Play film series.

For Disney, he voiced Jack Skellington in Tim Burton's 1993 stop-motion fantasy film The Nightmare Before Christmas. In the original film, Sarandon only voiced Jack's speaking voice, composer Danny Elfman did Jack's singing. In the video-game spin-off Oogie's Revenge, Sarandon did do Jack's singing. He reprised the role for Jack in many other subsequent Disney productions, such as the video games The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge, the Kingdom Hearts series, and Disney Infinity, along with Halloween Screams and the Haunted Mansion Holiday, at the Disneyland Resort. He also made a cameo as Jay Dee in the Fright Night remake, as a nod to his role in the original.
