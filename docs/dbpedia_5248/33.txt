Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy! is the tenth in a series of direct-to-video films based upon Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo Saturday morning cartoons. The Mystery, Inc. gang are caught in the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle, while vacationing on a creepy eerie cruise, with ghost, pirates, and monsters.

the gang attends a costume party dinner. The creepy cloaked man appears on stage, who turns out to be Mr. Mysterio, a famous hypnotist. Shaggy and Scooby are picked from the audience to demonstrate his powers, but they prove immune to his hypnotism: yet the audience falls under the trance, except for the gang, Garcia, and Skip, who were looking a different direction. Mysterio dispels the hypnotism and disappears in a puff of smoke.
