        "text": "Linda Edna Cardellini was born in Redwood City, California, to Lorraine (Hernan) and Wayne David Cardellini, a businessman. She is of Italian (from her paternal grandfather), Irish (from her mother), German, English, and Scottish descent. Linda grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, California, the youngest of four children. She became interested in acting at age ten, when she performed a singing role in a school Christmas play. She continued to do school productions and community theater.\n\nLinda attended Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, California. After graduating, she had to decide whether to go to New York to pursue theater or Los Angeles to pursue film and television. She chose LA. Linda was cast in her first role, on the series Bone Chillers (1996). Her breakthrough part came when she was cast in Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999). She played academic decathlete Lindsay Weir on the celebrated series, which won an Emmy Award in the Category of \"Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series\".\n\nCardellini captured the hearts of young girls, boys and teenagers, worldwide, for her portrayal of Velma in Warner Bros.'s Scooby-Doo (2002). She also co-starred in 'Brian Robbins'' Good Burger - Die total verrückte Burger-Bude (1997), Natürlich blond (2001), with Reese Witherspoon, and Tom McLoughlin's The Unsaid (2001) with Andy Garcia, as well as in the Adam Sandler-produced comedy, Grandma's Boy (2006).\n\nIn 2005, Cardellini starred in the ensemble film, American Gun (2005), for IFC Films, alongside Donald Sutherland, Forest Whitaker and Marcia Gay Harden. \"American Gun\" was the debut feature of director/co-writer Aric Avelino, which has earned a Best Picture nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards in 2007. In the same year, Cardellini delivered a heartfelt performance as a jilted lover in Ang Lee's highly-acclaimed drama, Brokeback Mountain (2005), which garnered major accolades from critics, including an Academy Award nomination and Golden Globe win for Best Picture and Outstanding Ensemble in a Motion Picture Drama by the Screen Actor's Guild.\n\nIt was upon working with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana on this film, that they later cast her in CBS's Hallmark Hall of Fame mini-series Comanche Moon (2008), a testament to their trust in Cardellini's talent and presence on screen. Cardellini starred alongside Val Kilmer and Steve Zahn in the six-hour, epic mini-series in 2008, written by McMurtry (based on McMurtry's novel of the same name), directed by Simon Wincer and executive-produced by Ossana. This western, which was the prequel to \"Lonesome Dove,\" (the television series created in 1989 by McMurtry) aired on three consecutive evenings for two hours each night.\n\nIn 2008, Cardellini portrayed the lead role of 'Julie Ingram' in the feature film \"The Lazarus Project\" starring alongside 'Paul Walker'. Directed by John Glenn, this thriller tells the story of a former criminal who is drawn into an illicit endeavor and subsequently finds himself living an inexplicable new life working at a psychiatric facility.\n\nIn 2011, Cardellini co-starred in Jonathan Hensleigh's independent feature film \"Kill the Irishman,\" alongside Christopher Walken, Ray Stevenson and Val Kilmer. The film was based on the true story of Danny Greene, a tough Irish thug working for mobsters in Cleveland during the 1970s. In February 2012, Cardellini starred as 'Kelli' in the independent film \"Return,\" opposite Michael Shannon and John Slattery which earned Cardellini an Independent Spirit Award nomination for \"Best Female Lead.\" \"Return\" was featured in the Director's Fortnight section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and was an official entry at The Deauville, London and Palm Springs International Film Festivals. \"Return\" follows 'Kelli' as she returns home from war and learns how to adjust to a slower, normal life.\n\nIn 2013, Cardellini was almost unrecognizable, but turned heads, for her provocative portrayal of 'Sylvia Rosen,' 'Don Draper's' married mistress, in a guest arc in the sixth season of the critically acclaimed AMC series, \"Mad Men.\" She received her first Emmy nomination for \"Outstanding Guest Actress in A Drama Series\" for her portrayal.\n\nWorking in both film and television, Linda is well-known for her portrayal of 'Nurse Samantha Taggart' on NBC's highly-rated, critically acclaimed series, \"ER\". She will next be seen as 'Meg Rayburn' in Netflix's new untitled family drama series created by Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman and Todd Kessler. Cardellini also has a co-starring role in the indie comedy Willkommen bei Alice (2014), opposite an all-star cast that includes Kristen Wiig, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, James Marsden and Wes Bentley. The film is directed by Shira Piven. \"Welcome to Me\" was produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nOn the small screen, Cardellini was a guest star, playing 'Dr. Megan Tillman', in CBS' Person of Interest (2011). The crime drama show was created by Jonathan Nolan and stars Jim Caviezel, Taraji P. Henson and Michael Emerson. Cardellini also lends her voice to a diverse group of animated series including Nickelodeon's \"Sanjay & Craig\" wherein she plays 'Megan,' IFC's \"Out There\" wherein she voices 'Starla,' and Disney's \"Gravity Falls,\" in which she is 'Wendy.' Cardellini's past voiceover work includes the role of 'Bliss,' the family daughter in the ABC animated television program, The Goode Family (2009).\n\nLinda has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre from Loyola Marymount University, and completed a summer study program at the National Theatre in London. She resides in Los Angeles.\n\nA true triple-threat, Emmy Award-winner Julianne Hough is known to audiences around the world for her success in the worlds of film, television and music. She became a household name virtually overnight as a two-time professional champion on ABC's top-rated \"Dancing With the Stars,\" before making a seamless transition to award-winning recording artist and making her mark on the world of motion pictures, recognized by the National Association of Theatre Owners as Rising Star of the Year at the 2011 CinemaCon Conventions.\n\nIn 2013, Julianne starred opposite Josh Duhamel in Nicholas Sparks' \"Safe Haven,\" directed by Lasse Hallstrom, which topped the box-office on its Valentine's Day opening and earned her a Teen Choice Award nomination. Prior to that, she starred opposite Russell Brand and Octavia Spencer in Diablo Cody's \"Paradise,\" marking the Oscar-winning screenwriter's directorial debut. She starred as Sherrie Christian, the female lead in the film adaptation of the international musical sensation, \"Rock of Ages,\" part of a superstar cast including Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand and Mary J.

As performed by Julianne and the cast, the show-stopping \"You're the One That I Want\" won the MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Musical Moment, beating such heavy hitters as Ariana Grande and John Legend's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Justin Timberlake's \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" and the Ryan Gosling-Emma Stone duet, \"City of Stars\" from \"La La Land.\"\n\nIn 2014, Julianne and her brother, Derek, produced, co-directed and starred in MOVE Live on Tour, which sold out theaters across North America. They followed that success with an all-new production in Summer 2015, which featured live vocal performances by Julianne and Derek in addition to fresh, exciting choreography featuring the superstar siblings and the MOVE Company Dancers.\n\nThey hit the road again in 2017 with MOVE Beyond Live on Tour, their biggest and best show yet, with brand-new stage production inspired by the elements - earth, wind, fire, and water - which the duo have infused into fresh, high impact choreography that only they can deliver. The show brought fans on a journey of dance and music, taking inspiration directly from the four elements as an exploration of the human relationship with nature. The pair was joined by the Move Company Dancers for group performances in styles ranging from ballroom and tap to salsa and hip-hop and everything in between.\n\nIn 2015, Julianne launched her lifestyle website and blog, Jules.\n\nA born entertainer, Julianne Hough (pronounced \"Huff\") always loved singing, dancing and acting. At age 10, she was presented with an opportunity to study performing arts in London, which established her fierce independence and was the beginning of a period of intense training and education. She returned to Utah at age 15 and, after graduating high school, moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of a career in entertainment.\n\nQuickly earning a solid reputation for her talent, discipline and professionalism, it took less than a month for Julianne to land a job as a dancer on the ABC game show, \"Show Me The Money,\" and shortly thereafter joined the \"Dancing With the Stars\" tour as a company dancer before joining the cast of the hit series in the show's fourth season, where she was paired with two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner Apolo Anton Ohno. She toured with the troupe again, before returning to the hit show for seasons five through eight, pairing with Indy race champion Helio Castroneves, comedian Adam Carolla, actor Cody Linley and country singer Chuck Wicks. Hough remains the youngest dancer to have won the competition twice, with partners Ohno and Castroneves. Her skills as a choreographer also led to a collaboration with Gwen Stefani on the singer's \"Wind It Up\" video.\n\nJulianne earned Emmy nominations in 2008 and 2009 for Best Choreography for her work on the show and in 2015, won the Emmy for choreographing, along with her brother Derek and Tessandra Chavez, her and Derek's memorable performance of Sia's \"Elastic Heart,\" performed live by the singer-songwriter.\n\nFollowing her departure from \"Dancing With the Stars,\" Julianne made several appearances on the show to promote her films and as a guest judge. She thrilled fans when she returned full-time to the ballroom as a judge for three hit seasons in 2014-15 and again in Fall 2016 and Spring 2017.\n\nJulianne's self-titled debut album, released by Universal Music Group Nashville in 2008, hit the Billboard Country charts at #1 and entered the Billboard 200 at #3, marking the highest debut for a country artist since 2006. Her first two singles from the album, \"That Song in My Head\" and \"My Hallelujah Song,\" soared up the country charts and she earned her first two 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards for Top New Female Vocalist and Top New Artist.\n\nHitting the road for the first time as a recording artist in 2009, Julianne opened for superstar Brad Paisley and later toured with George Strait, playing over 100 shows. Her second album, The Julianne Hough Holiday Collection, became an instant holiday classic for her legions of fans, distributed exclusively at Target.\n\nIn 2009, Julianne also starred in her first fitness DVD, \"Cardio Ballroom,\" the first in a series designed to motivate exercise novices and enthusiasts alike on the dance floor. The second, \"Just Dance!,\" was released in 2010, also topping sales charts for months.\n\nIn 2012, she created her own shoe line, Julianne Hough for Sole Society, a collaboration with leading women's footwear designer Vince Camuto and is highly sought-after in the world of commercials and endorsements, as an international spokesperson for Proactiv Solution and previously as the official spokesperson for Venus Embrace, co-authoring their \"Goddess Guide to Getting Closer\" for the company's 2009 marketing campaign. She was featured in the iconic Got Milk? Campaign and sang an updated version of the Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum theme, \"The Taste is Gonna Move Ya,\" with numerous international campaigns in the works.\n\nJulianne has a long-term partnership with MPG Activewear, which was introduced with 12 favorite styles curated and selected by Julianne from the popular line's Spring/Summer 2016 collection and now features quarterly collections designed by Julianne. She is the face of Giorgio Beverly Hills Fragrances, celebrating the iconic brand's 35th anniversary and the recent introduction of Giorgio Beverly Hills Glam.

In May 2017, Julianne executive produced and co-hosted The Miss USA Competition for the second time.\n\nIn addition to her performing career, Julianne is also active in a wide range of philanthropic endeavors, charities and humanitarian efforts. Julianne has joined forces with the Kind Campaign to create and host Kind Camp, empowering and encouraging girls to be confident, beautiful women and to eradicate girl against girl bullying. Her charitable affiliations range from numerous causes and organizations that serve women and girls to those that are fueled by her lifelong passion for dogs and other animals, among many others.\n\nFrom bringing dynamic characters to life on screen to producing and writing films, award winning actor Mehcad Brooks has become known in the entertainment industry for his raw and refined talent, charisma, and moving presence. This year, Mehcad can be seen starring as Jackson 'Jax' Briggs, a cybernetically-enhanced super soldier and leader of Earthrealm in Warner Bros' highly anticipated action adventure feature film \"Mortal Kombat.\" Directed by Simon McQuaid and produced by James Wan (\"Aquaman\"), the film is based on the iconic video game series that centers on an extensive roster of character fighters from a variety of realms in a fictional universe battling for supremacy; the series has sold over 49 million copies, spanning over a dozen canon games and expansions, making it one of the most profitable video game franchises of all time. \"Mortal Kombat\" was released simultaneously in theaters worldwide, and on HBO Max on April 16, 2021.\n\nIn film, Mehcad starred in Netflix's most watched thriller of 2020, Tyler Perry's \"A Fall From Grace,\" which in its first four months following its debut remained one of the Top 10 Most Watched titles. He also recently starred in \"Nobody's Fool\" (Paramount Pictures) opposite Tika Sumpter, Tiffany Haddish and Whoopi Goldberg. Additional film credits include \"In the Valley of Elah\" opposite Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron, Disney's \"Glory Road\" produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, \"Just Wright\" opposite Queen Latifah, Common, and Paula Patton for Fox Searchlight Pictures and \"About Last Night\" opposite Kevin Hart, Michael Ealy, and Regina Hall for Screen Gems.\n\nOn the television front, Mehcad most recently starred in the DC Comic superhero action-adventure series \"Supergirl\" (The CW) opposite Melissa Benoist. The series debuted in 2015 to critical acclaim, being called \"a damn good time\" by The New York Observer, \"bright, fun, exciting\" by Forbes and \"just great television\" by The Los Angeles Times. For five seasons, Mehcad was a fan favorite as friend, mentor, and object of affection to Supergirl (Benoist), James \"The Guardian\" Olsen.\n\nMehcad landed his first big break in television in 2005, securing the role of Matthew Applewhite (Alfre Woodward's son) on the award-winning series \"Desperate Housewives\" for ABC. During his time on the show he won a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, and also secured a NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Mehcad went on to co-star on the critically acclaimed Alan Ball HBO series \"True Blood\" as Benedict 'Eggs' Talley opposite Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer from 2008-2010. When his time on \"True Blood\" came to an end, he quickly booked a lead role on USA's drama series \"Necessary Roughness,\" which was based on the true story of a female psychologist who worked for the New York Jets. Mehcad was a scene stealer as football player Terrence 'TK' King, a star wide receiver who becomes notorious for his frequent fumbles and regular run-ins with the law. The series ran for three seasons, from 2011-13. In between \"True Blood\" and \"Necessary Roughness,\" Mehcad landed a celebrity endorsement deal with Calvin Klein, in one of the most notorious global campaigns to date, making international headlines as one of the four faces of their CK X underwear line two years in a row.\n\nBorn and raised in Austin, Texas Mehcad grew up excelling at academics while being immersed in sports, becoming an all-state basketball player. While he loved spending time on the court and in the classroom (being recognized nationally in academics), he had a deep-rooted passion for the arts, whether it was acting, playing music, producing, or writing. Upon graduating high school, he decided to forgo 26 basketball scholarships and a full academic scholarship to Yale. He decided to attend the prestigious University of Southern California to study at their School of Cinematic Arts, to further hone his craft. Early credits for Mehcad include: \"Malcolm in the Middle,\" \"Boston Public,\" \"One on One,\" \"Cold Case,\" \"The Game,\" \"Dollhouse,\" and \"Ghost Whisperer.\"\n\nWhile bringing characters to life remains one of Mehcad's biggest passions, his love for telling stories through music is equally important. Mehcad recently released his debut, full length album \"May 20th\" which was inspired by multiple near-death experiences, all taking place on May 20th and forever changing his life. \"May 20th\" is available on all digital platforms."
