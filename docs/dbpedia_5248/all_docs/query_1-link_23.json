        "text": "This needs a stretch. (Feel free to remove when satisfied of completion.)\n\nNeeded: Synopsis is missing details\n\nThis article is about the film. For other uses, see Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King (disambiguation).\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Goblin King is the twelfth in a series of direct-to-video films based upon Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo Saturday morning cartoons. It was released on DVD September 23, 2008.[1] It was the first to be released under the Warner Premiere label after the folding of Warner Bros. Family Entertainment.\n\nPremise[]\n\nA clumsy, faux magician steals the magic of a real fairy, but that's only the beginning of his plan to take over both the mortal and magic world.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThe Mystery, Inc. gang goes to the annual Coolsville Halloween carnival on Halloween night. While there, they encounter the resident magician \"The Amazing Krudsky\" who refuses to allow Scooby to see his show after an accident. In retaliation, he and Shaggy, who feel that Halloween is the one night of the year where the usual scares have to be fake, expose Krudsky as a fraud during one of his acts, causing his audience to walk out and Krudsky to swear revenge on the duo. The gang gets thrown out of the carnival and decide to go trick-or-treating instead.\n\nIn his tent, Krudsky reveals his desire to become a real magician. The Fairy Princess Willow enters Krudsky's tent and accidentally causes Krudsky to notice an entry about the Goblin Scepter in a spellbook, which can be combined with fairy magic to control Halloween. Krudsky then gets an idea to obtain the scepter and rule the world with it. Willow decides to toy with him, but knocks herself out; Krudsky sees that she is a fairy and absorbs her magical powers, thus becoming a real magician. Meanwhile, Shaggy's and Scooby's last stop trick-or-treating is a spooky-looking house which claims to be a \"genuine magic shoppe\". Once inside, a thunderstorm begins, frightening them. The proprietor of the magic shop, Mr. Gibbles reveals to the duo that magic really does exist. Krudksy enters the shop chasing Willow, captures her and then turns Gibbles into a rabbit and steals the magic equipment before leaving. Mr. Gibbles explains Krudsky's plan to Shaggy and Scooby and shows them a vision of Krudsky turning their friends into monsters, horrifying the two. Gibbles gets them to board the Grim Reaper Railway which will fly them to the spirit world, warning them that they have to return home before sunrise or else they will be trapped in the spirit world forever. Before they depart, Shaggy and Scooby are magically disguised with the use of temporary magic cards into monster-like versions of themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, while looking for Shaggy and Scooby back in the real world, the rest of the gang see Krudsky conversing with the Goblin King through a mirror who reluctantly agrees to exchange his scepter for Princess Willow at midnight. Seeing all the magic causes the overly rational Velma to fall unconscious; Fred and Daphne leave Velma to rest in the mystery machine while they set a trap for both the Goblin King and Krudsky.\n\nIn the magic world, Shaggy and Scooby's disguises disappear as they encounter a werewolf. In order to get past him, they convince him that they are collectively a werewolf. Fooled, he brings them to a monster-filled bar. During the song \"Bump in the Night\", Shaggy adds in a lyric asking how to get to the Goblin King's castle, terrifying all of the monsters into running away. The Goblin King's two bumbling goblin henchmen, Glob and Glum, attempt to capture Scooby and Shaggy, but are stopped by Jack O'Lantern. The trio then encounters the Headless Horseman who wants Jack for a pumpkin head. They escape the Horseman and arrive at the Witches' Hut where they meet the Grand Witch and her two fellow witches. The witches send Shaggy and Scooby on a ride on their flying broomstick towards the Goblin King's castle, but they are shot down by Glob and Glum by a goblin cannon.\n\nCrash-landing in a small fairy village in a forest, Shaggy and Scooby find three fairies named Sparkplug, Honeybee and Tiddlywink, who help them to the Goblin King's castle entrance. Using a potion from the witches (apparently made from someone called \"Scratch\"), Shaggy and Scooby disguise themselves as Daphne and Velma in order to get inside the castle. Only a few minutes away from midnight, Shaggy and Scooby try to steal the scepter from the Goblin King but are captured when their disguises wear off and sent to the tower dungeon.\n\nBack in the mortal world, Krudsky and the Goblin King are almost through with their trade when Fred and Daphne spring a trap, only managing to catch the Goblin King. Krudsky takes the scepter, turning himself into the new Goblin King before turning the Goblin King into a goose. Krudsky and his new goblin army set off to take over the world. He turns the Mystery Machine into a living monster vehicle called the \"Monstrous Machine\" to chase Fred, Daphne, Velma and Willow. The goblins capture the three and Krudsky uses his newfound powers to turn Fred into a vampire, Daphne into a witch and Velma into a werewolf (fulfilling the terrifying vision that Scooby and Shaggy were shown by Mr. Gibbles earlier).\n\nAt that moment, Scooby, Shaggy and Jack O'Lantern arrive, having been saved from the dungeon before sunrise by the fairies and Broomy. Jack sacrifices himself, making Krudsky drop the staff. Scooby then uses the staff to break Krudsky's spells before returning it to the Goblin King, who is revealed to be Princess Willow's father. The Goblin King holds his daughter responsible for all the trouble caused and punishes her by declaring her grounded for a year, though he admits he's relieved to have her back and safe. Mr. Gibbles brings Jack back to life with the Goblin King's help as the latter takes Krudsky prisoner for his crimes. He, the goblin army, Willow, Jack, Broomy and Mr. Gibbles all return to the magical world. Before departing, the Goblin King uses one final spell to erase the memory of the events from Fred, Daphne and Velma's minds, to keep the balance between the worlds. However, Scooby and Shaggy are allowed to keep their memories as they have proven their courage. After the Carnival packs up, Daphne wonders if they are a little too old for this stuff. Velma says that no one would even believe in monsters and magic even if it is just one night a year, and then Scooby dresses up like the Headless Horseman just to scare Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain characters:\n\nMystery Inc.\n\nScooby-Doo\n\nShaggy Rogers\n\nFred Jones\n\nVelma Dinkley\n\nDaphne Blake\n\nSupporting characters:\n\nFairy Princess Willow (only appearance)\n\nMr. Gibbles (only appearance)\n\nHoneybee (only appearance)\n\nSparkplug (only appearance)\n\nTiddlywink (only appearance)\n\nGrand Witch (only appearance)\n\nOwl Witch (only appearance)\n\nCat Witch (only appearance)\n\nVillains:\n\nAmazing Krudsky (only appearance)\n\nGlob (only appearance)\n\nGlum (only appearance)\n\nJack O'Lantern (only appearance)(redeemed)\n\nHeadless Horseman (only appearance)\n\nHeadless Horseman's horse (only appearance)\n\nGoblin King (only appearance)(redeemed)\n\nMonstrous Machine (only appearance)(no lines)(transformation)\n\nOther characters:\n\nFangface (only appearance)(photograph)(cameo)\n\nTrain conductor (only appearance)\n\nWerewolf bouncer (only appearance)\n\nMonster bar patrons (only appearance)(miscellaneous speaking)\n\nBroomie (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nLocations[]\n\nCoolsville\n\nCoolsville Halloween Carnival\n\nGhost Coaster\n\nPhoto-op\n\nFerris wheel\n\nClock tower\n\nMr. Gibbles' Genuine Magic Shoppe\n\nSpirit world\n\nHangman's Corner (mentioned)\n\nMonster bar\n\nThree witches' home\n\nOld Oak Grove\n\nGoblin Graveyard\n\nGoblin Castle\n\nDungeon\n\nObjects[]\n\nApples\n\nMagic cards\n\nPumpkins\n\nGoblin cannon\n\nGoblin Scepter\n\nBroomie\n\nVehicles[]\n\nAfterlife Express\n\nThe Mystery Machine\n\nThe Monstrous Machine\n\nCast[]\n\nFrank Welker Scooby-Doo\n\nFred Jones Casey Kasem Shaggy Rogers Mindy Cohn Velma Dinkley Grey DeLisle Daphne Blake\n\nCat Witch\n\nHoneybee Hayden Panettiere Fairy Princess Willow Wayne Knight Amazing Krudsky Wallace Shawn Mr. Gibbles Jay Leno Jack O'Lantern Tim Curry Goblin King\n\nWerewolf bouncer James Belushi Glob Larry Joe Campbell Glum Lauren Bacall Grand Witch Thom Adcox Sparkplug Russi Taylor Owl Witch\n\nTiddlywink\n\nSongs[]\n\nSong Credits Performed by Character performance by \"Who's at the Door\" Music by Thomas Chase Jones\n\nLyrics by Joe Sichta and Sandra Frame\n\nWritten and produced by Thomas Chase Jones Wallace Shawn Mr. Gibbles \"Bump in the Night\" Music by Thomas Chase Jones\n\nLyrics by Joe Sichta\n\nWritten and produced by Thomas Chase Jones Randy Crenshaw\n\nCasey Kasem Various monsters\n\nShaggy \"Goblin Oogie Boogie\" Music by Thomas Chase Jones\n\nLyrics by Joe Sichta and Thomas Chase Jones\n\nWritten and produced by Thomas Chase Jones James Belushi\n\nBackground vocals by Molly Pasutti Glob \"Moocher Durge\" Written and produced by Thomas Chase Jones N/A N/A\n\nProduction[]\n\nContinuity[]\n\nThe sign on the carnival acknowledges that Coolsville is the setting.\n\nShaggy and Scooby get turned into monsters to get inside the Afterlife Express. Shaggy already turned into that same monster in the Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo short Movie Monster Menace for a brief moment during the end, albeit with no hair on the head and red coloured.\n\nIn this movie and the following, Daphne's robe-like top introduced in the What's New, Scooby-Doo? episode There's No Creature Like Snow Creature, has been redesigned to be a regular top with a V-neck.\n\nAt the amusement park, the Monstrous Machine crashes into a stand full of stuffed toys of Scrappy-Doo. Even though Scrappy himself doesn't appear, this is the only time he's used in a DTV film.\n\nIn the scene where Shaggy & Scooby enter the monster bar, in the part where all the monsters sing, some of the monsters from various Scooby series, are part of the group:\n\nThe Werewolf from SDWAY: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Werewolf\n\nA Phantom Shadow from SDWAY: A Night of Fright is No Delight\n\nThe Creeper from SDWAY: Jeepers, It's the Creeper\n\nThe Ghost of Witch McCoy from TSDS: The Ozark Witch Switch\n\nThe Mummy of Ankha from SDWAY: Scooby-Doo and a Mummy, Too\n\nA blue version of the Roller Ghoster from WNSD: Roller Ghoster Ride\n\nDracula (A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts) from SDWAY: A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts\n\nThe Zombie (Which Witch is Which?) from SDWAY: Which Witch is Which?\n\nSnow Ghost from SDWAY: That's Snow Ghost\n\nGhost of Mr. Hyde from SDWAY: Nowhere to Hyde\n\nThe No-Face Zombie from TSDS: The No-Face Zombie Chase Case\n\nPenguin's Troll disguise from TNSDMovies: The Caped Crusader Caper\n\nA Kelp Monster from TSDS: Scooby-Doo, Where's the Crew?\n\nSpecter of Ebenezer Crabbe from TSDS: High Rise Hair Raiser\n\nGhost of the Great Haldane from SD&SD (1st series): The Sorcerer's a Menace\n\nShadow Creature from SD&SD (1st series): The Ghoul, the Bat and the Ugly\n\nWax Phantom from SDWAY: Don't Fool with a Phantom\n\nThe Phantom from SDWAY: Hassle in the Castle\n\nThe Scarecrow from TNSDMovies: The Frickert Fracas\n\nThe Creepy Keeper from WNSD: Fright House of a Lighthouse\n\nIronically, these monsters are actually friendly, in contrast to the people who dressed up as them.\n\nScooby and Shaggy previously dressed up as Velma and Daphne in Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy!.\n\nNotes/Trivia[]\n\nThe Shaggy-and-Scooby-centric storyline, set in a truly supernatural world, and with minimal screentime for Daphne, Velma, and Fred, is reminiscent of the 1987-8 trilogy Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers, Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School, and Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf.\n\nThe book Krudsky looks at when he captures the fairy has a picture of Fangface, a lesser known Hanna-Barbera detective.\n\nThe film is dedicated to Paulette Oates, whom helped resurrect Warner Bros. Animation in the late 1980s.\n\nWallace Shawn (Mr. Gibbles) voices the regular character Rex in Disney/Pixar's Toy Story franchise. Wayne Knight (Amazing Krudsky) voiced Al the Collector in Toy Story 2 and Emperor Zurg in the Buzz Lightyear of Star Command DTV spinoffs.\n\nTim Curry previously voiced Ben Ravencroft in Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost.\n\nThe scene with the musical number \"Goblin Oogie Boogie\" has many similarities to crucial scenes in the stop-motion comedy-horror movies The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Corpse Bride (2005), both written by Tim Burton.\n\n\"Goblin Oogie Boogie\" shares the name from the villain from The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nReleased in Australia as part of a double DVD with Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster in 2011.\n\nCultural References[]\n\nThe Cat Witch, Owl Witch, and the Grand Witch are likely a homage to the Sanderson Sisters from the film Hocus Pocus (1993).\n\nMiscellaneous[]\n\nDisguises: Shaggy and Scooby as monsters; Shaggy as Daphne and Scooby as Velma.\n\nTraps:\n\nClues:\n\nScooby Snacks bribe: 0.\n\n\"Zoinks\" count: 11.\n\n\"Rikes\" count: 1.\n\n\"Ruh-roh\" count: 0.\n\n\"Jeepers\" count: 4.\n\n\"Jinkies\" count: 2.\n\n\"Gang way\" count: 1.\n\nAdaptations[]\n\nWarner Bros. published online a video game version with the same name.\n\nThe comic book story Scooby-Doo and the Shadow Goblin is a loose adaptation.\n\nAnimation mistakes and/or technical glitches[]\n\nMr. Gibbles' Genuine Magic Shoppe is missing an apostrophe on its sign.\n\nHowever, this may be an in-universe attempt to make the sign seem like it is written in \"Olde English,\" as possessive apostrophes are a fairly recent invention, first becoming popular in the 18th century, and standardizing the rules gradually.\n\nThe werewolf bouncer's blue overalls turn brown after he transforms into his werewolf form.\n\nInconsistencies/continuity errors and/or goofs/oddities[]\n\nFairy Princess Willow is the Goblin King's daughter. Either she is adopted, or their biology works in a manner that is not definable by anything dreamt of in our philosophy.\n\nIf the Goblin King is a fair and just ruler, as suggested at the end, why are so many of his subjects afraid of him?\n\nIn other languages[]\n\nHome media[]\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Goblin King DVD released by Warner Home Video on September 23, 2008.\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Goblin King DVD released by Warner Home Video on October 20 2008.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
