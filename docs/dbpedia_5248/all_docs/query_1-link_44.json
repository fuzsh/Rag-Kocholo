        "text": "* Indicates required field\n\nShould the weekly polls include options that are not a significant part of the episode/film? *\n\nOnly options that are a significant part of the episode/film should be included All possible options should be included\n\nWe're going to do a very different type of poll this week! This is a poll I actually wanted to do last week following the museum poll, but I was on vacation, so I decided to hold it back until this week, since this is a poll where I wanted to be able to check a couple times throughout the day to respond to any potential discussion.\n\nWe've been doing a lot of \"what's your favorite episode involving a certain type of setting/villain?\" questions for the weekly polls lately. In the past few weeks, there has been a lot of debate in the comments about whether every possible option should be included in the poll, or if the options should be limited to only episodes/films where the type of setting or villain in the question plays a significant role in the overall plot. For example, two weeks ago with the museum poll, episodes like \"Chiller Diller Movie Thriller\" and \"The Spooky Case of the Grand Prix Race\" where a museum played a small role in the episode were suggested as options. There was also some discussion over whether episodes including Alcatraz should count as a museum since it is one in real-life, even though none of the episodes presented Alcatraz as a museum.\n\nI really appreciate when you all remind me if I've forgotten an option, or propose a potential option that people might want to choose. There are definitely times where I forget to include an episode, and I'm sure there will be times in the future where I forget options again.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we started with 10 options for the museum poll, and we ended up with 26 different options by the end of the week. I was thinking it would be a good idea to do a poll like this to see people's preference of how broad you want the poll options to be, just so there's less confusion over what should count. I think it would be good to have most of us on the same page, so people aren't having to go back and revote multiple times because options keep being added. I'm sure I'll still forget to include an option somebody thinks should count every once in a while, and I'm happy to still add options as needed.\n\nIn the past, I've tried to limit it to only options where the setting/villain play a prominent role in the plot, so that the amount of poll options don't get too overwhelming for people. However, I am open to making the polls include all possible options if that's what most people on here would prefer. The results of this poll will determine how I approach the options for weekly polls in the future. Obviously, the results of this poll won't please everybody, but I think it would be nice to establish what the majority of people on the blog want, so I can write up these polls with a clearer idea in mind of what everybody thinks should and shouldn't count.\n\nIf you have any thoughts you want to share on this issue, feel free to share them in the comments!\n\nHere are the results for last week's poll:\n\nWhat is your favorite Scooby episode spotlighting an aspect of American history?\n\nThe Loch Ness Mess - 19\n\nWitch's Ghost - 12\n\nThe Spirits of '76 - 9\n\nTo Switch a Witch - 7\n\nGourmet Ghost - 7\n\nA Mystery Solving Gang Divided - 5\n\nVote Velma - 3\n\nBig Scare in the Big Easy - 2\n\nWorld of Witchcraft - 2\n\nSweet Dreams Scooby - 1\n\nA Night Louse at the White House - 0\n\nWhile this is not technically a Scooby-Doo fun fact, it is somewhat related as it's about Mumbly from Laff-a-Lympics. I had originally thought that WB renamed Muttley just for Laff-a-Lympics; however, it was apparently more of a character evolution. Mumbly was originally named Mugger in the 1964 film Hey There, It's Yogi Bear, and was a circus dog. He also walked on all four legs in this film rather than his hind legs as he did in later appearances. In 1968, the version of Muttley that most of us are familiar with appeared in Wacky Races. He had brown fur in this series, rather than the white fur he had in Laff-a-Lympics. However, right before Laff-a-Lympics, Muttley was given his own show, The Mumbly Cartoon Show, and his character name was changed to Mumbly. This show also changed his fur from brown to white. This show also significantly changed Mumbly's personality, and he was not evil like we see in Laff-a-Lympics. Rather, in The Mumbly Cartoon Show, Mumbly was a private eye who fought crime with a human sidekick. Mumbly also had a brief cameo in the third episode of Dynomutt, Dog Wonder, where he meets Dynomutt for the first time.\n\nOn a separate note, I'll also throw in an extra little tidbit here that I learned while researching this fact. Apparently, John Stephenson's Mildew Wolf voice was intended to be him doing an impression of Paul Lynde, who was a famous comedy actor at the time."
