        "text": "This needs a stretch. (Feel free to remove when satisfied of completion.)\n\nNeeded: * Synopsis not copied on wikipedia or any other media\n\n* Miscellaneous is incomplete\n\nThis article is about the film. For other uses, Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico (disambiguation).\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico is the sixth in a series of direct-to-video films based upon Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo Saturday morning cartoons. It was released on VHS and DVD on September 30, 2003.\n\nPremise[]\n\nScooby and the gang are in Mexico for the Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead) when they discover a frightening Chupacabra on the loose!\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nOne night in Veracruz, Mexico, El Chupacabra attacks a musical celebration.\n\nSometime before the attack, Alejo Otero, a pen pal of Fred's, invites him and Mystery Inc. for the Day of the Dead celebration. Alejo owned the Villa Bella Hotel with a coffee shop managed by his brother, Luis, and his fiancée, Charlene. They also meet Alejo's wife, mother, son, and pet: Sofia, Dolores, Jorge and Chiquita. During dinner, the gang meets Diego Fuente a business partner of Alejo and Luis's deceased father who wanted to buy the hotel.\n\nDuring rain, Alejo explained the Chupacabra attacks that started after he emailed Fred. They decided to stay in the hotel for the night just to be safe. However, after hearing stranger noises, they found footprints outside, Velma thinks they scared whatever made that noise away. However, the next morning, a message on the Mystery Machine said \"Sal ahora o no veras el dia de manana!\" or \"Leave today or you won't see tomorrow!\" The gang decided to go with Alejo and Luis around town for clues, Charlene gives Luis a medallion for good luck. Fred, Daphne and Velma encounter a statue of Quetzalcoatl and met El Curandero, who warmed them that they are in grave danger. Alejo briefly got separated from Luis and encountered El Chupacabra on a cliff. He fell but managed to grab a branch, Luis claimed that Chupacabra hit him on the head and knocked him out. Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy find their friends in the Mystery Machine, but somebody drained their brake fluid preventing the van from stopping. El Chupacabra chased Fred, Daphne, Velma, Alejo and Luis until Shaggy and Scooby picked them up. Luckily, the Mystery Machine ran out of gas miraculously in front of a gas station.\n\nThe next morning, they visit a museum about the ancient Aztecs. The museum guide gives them a personal tour and show. However, during the show, she has Daphne volunteer for something and disappears with her. While searching the place, Velma finds a piece of cloth saying \"Mile Enter\" and Fred finds a secret passageway. It opened up a crazy ride where everyone eventually ended up outside near the Aztec pyramids, where they find Daphne on top of one. Back at the bottom, another statue of Quetzalcoatl (which apparently wasn't there where they first arrived) crumbles and a cage suddenly appears over the seven. A \"magical eagle\" named Paco convinces the tourists that the gods will wrath upon Mexico unless the seven are run out.\n\nAfter managing to escape, encountering living statues on the way, they return to Veracruz for the Day of the Dead celebration, where Dolores reveals that El Chupacabra kidnapped Charlene. As the Otero family give offerings to Alejo and Luis' father, they are visited by his ghost, who urges them to sell the hotel to get rid of a curse. However, after Fred discovered that Luis' medallion was actually a tracking device, Scooby and Chiquita found a tomb where a skeleton man was controlling the ghost. The man was Mr. Smiley, who wanted to build a theme park by scaring off the citizens. He never learned Spanish resulting in him misspelling \"Mañana\", \"Mile Enter\" actually meant \"Smiley Entertainment\", Alejo and Luis' father only spoke Spanish, and Smiley made those animatronics like Paco to scare everyone away.\n\nSuddenly, El Chupacabra appears, but the gang manages to catch it with bees and wiring. El Chupacabra turned out to be the museum guide, who was actually an actress at one of Smiley's theme parks, they fell in love, but she told Luis he'll never see Charlene again. However, when noticing that all of the offerings except for Charlene's are gone, Velma realizes that the museum guide is Charlene! She only loved Luis for his money and planning on sharing with Smiley if their scheme was successful. At this moment, Fuente returns, revealing he had actually grown to accept Alejo and Luis' father's decision about the hotel, and was actually trying to warn them about Charlene and Smiley. After the two are taken into custody, Luis confesses that he faked being knocked out due to being too cowardly to confront El Chupacabra. Alejo forgave saying there are worse things than being a coward, Shaggy agrees saying he's the king of them. Then, everybody celebrates the Day of the Dead.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain characters:\n\nMystery Inc.\n\nScooby-Doo\n\nShaggy Rogers\n\nFred Jones\n\nDaphne Blake\n\nVelma Dinkley\n\nSupporting characters:\n\nAlejo Otero (only appearance)\n\nLuis Otero (only appearance)\n\nSofia Otero (only appearance)\n\nDolores Otero (only appearance)\n\nChiquita (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nDiego Fuente (only appearance)\n\nCurandero (only appearance)\n\nVillains:\n\nChupacabra (only appearance)(no lines)(Charlene's disguise)\n\nCharlene (only appearance)\n\nMuseum guide (only appearance)(Charlene's disguise)\n\nPaco (only appearance; destroyed)(robot)\n\nQuetzalcoatl (only appearance)(no lines)(robot)\n\nGhost of Señor Otero (only appearance)(projection)\n\nSkeleton man (only appearance)(Mr. Smiley's disguise)\n\nMr. Smiley (only appearance)\n\nOther characters:\n\nJorge Otero (only appearance)\n\nMusician 1 (only appearance)\n\nMusician 2 (only appearance)\n\nRicky (only appearance)(picture)\n\nSkunk (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nCustoms officer (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nBull (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nOliver (only appearance)\n\nNatalia (only appearance)\n\nCristina (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nFernanda (only appearance)(no lines)(no lines)\n\nCarolina (only appearance)\n\nMirelia (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nGabriella (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nSebastian (only appearance)\n\nSeñor Otero (only time mentioned)(deceased)\n\nStreet painter 1 (only appearance)\n\nStreet painter 2 (only appearance)\n\nOld woman 1 (only appearance)\n\nUncle Flaco (only time mentioned)\n\nBulldog (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nIce cream vendor (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nCoyote (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nHen (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nSuspicious tourist (only appearance)\n\nYogi Bear (mask)(cameo)\n\nWoman 1 (only appearance)\n\nOld woman 2 (only appearance)\n\nWoman 2 (only appearance)\n\nLittle girl (only appearance)\n\nPolice officers (only appearance)(no lines)\n\nWoman 3 (only appearance)\n\nLocations[]\n\nMexico\n\nVeracruz\n\nLos Tacos\n\nCustoms\n\nStadium\n\nVilla Bella Hotel\n\nCafé Lechera\n\nHen house\n\nMovie theater\n\nGas station\n\nCemetery\n\nMexico City\n\nMuseum of Anthropology\n\nTeotihuacán\n\nUnited States\n\nFred's home\n\nVelma's home\n\nDaphne's home\n\nShaggy's home\n\nKitchen\n\nShaggy's bedroom\n\nMr. Smiley's Fantastic Funland (billboard)\n\nObjects[]\n\nTrumpets\n\nBicycle\n\nFred's computer\n\nDaphne's computer\n\nVelma's laptop\n\nPizza\n\nShaggy's computer\n\nRefrigerator\n\nDoughnuts\n\nOranges\n\nSandwiches\n\nBanana\n\nSalsa\n\nTacos\n\nChili pepper\n\nBucket\n\nPumpkins\n\nTire\n\nJack\n\nCoffee\n\nMilk\n\nMarshmallows\n\nFlashlights\n\nVelma's camcorder\n\nCharlene's medallion\n\nScooby Snacks box\n\nScooby Snacks\n\nIce cream\n\nIce cream cone\n\nLadder\n\nFried egg\n\nVelma's glasses\n\nCacti\n\nIce pack\n\nVelma's binoculars\n\nCage\n\nHandcuffs\n\nWatermelon\n\nViolin\n\nWheelbarrow\n\nBeehive\n\nStilts\n\nVehicles[]\n\nThe Mystery Machine\n\nSuspects[]\n\nSuspect Motive/Reason Diego Fuente He had been trying to get Alejo and Luis to sell their family hotel to him.

A movie titled, Legend of the Vampire is seen in the marquee, along with two posters for the Vampire Rock Music Festival. This is a reference to the previous film, Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire.\n\nThe disguise that Scooby wears is similar to the one he wore in the original series episode Decoy for a Dognapper.\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe working title was Scooby-Doo! Beware of the Bigfoot, as mentioned by actor Rip Taylor in the DVD's behind the scenes extra.\n\nNotes/Trivia[]\n\nThis is the last time Heather North and Nicole Jaffe voice Daphne and Velma respectively, before North's death in 2017, with their successors being Grey DeLisle and Mindy Cohn, respectively. DeLisle debuted as Daphne in the fourth DTV film Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase. Cohn and DeLisle were also already voicing their roles in the TV series What's New, Scooby-Doo?\n\nFred reveals to Alejo that the reason why Shaggy eats so much and doesn't gain any weight is because he has a high metabolism.\n\nMiscellaneous[]\n\nDisguises: The entire gang as natives.\n\nTraps:\n\nDaphne getting kidnapped: She's placed onto a table to disappear and gets taken to the top of an Aztec temple.\n\nClues:\n\nScooby Snacks bribe: 1 for Shaggy and Scooby each.\n\n\"Ruh-roh\" count: 0.\n\n\"Zoinks\" count: 4 (1 from Shaggy's mail notification sound).\n\n\"Jeepers\" count: 1 (From Daphne's mail notification sound).\n\n\"Jinkies\" count: 4 (1 from Velma's mail notification sound).\n\nCultural references[]\n\nInstead of the correct reptilian (or canid) monster, a purple Bigfoot was used for the Chupacabra.\n\nThroughout the entire film even the characters native to Mexico say the Chupacabra's name as it's adapted in English. In Spanish it's spelled Chupacabras.\n\nThe Chupacabra's roaring sounds are the same stock roars originally recorded for Hanna-Barbera's Godzilla animated series from 1978–1979, as performed by Ted Cassidy.\n\nOne of the lyrics in the \"Viva Mexico\" song is \"Let me hear you scream '¡Ándale! ¡Ándale!'\", which was a common exclamation from another Warner Bros. Animation character, Speedy Gonzales.\n\nAt the beginning of the Day of the Dead ceremony, a child is wearing a Yogi Bear mask.\n\nThere are a couple of references to the film The Wizard of Oz:\n\nVelma, Fred, and Daphne mention \"Coyotes, jaguars and boars, oh my\", which is a reference to the line \"Lions, and tigers and bears, oh my\".\n\nMr. Smiley's line, \"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain\" is a paraphrase from the Wizard of Oz's line \"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain\".\n\nThe wheel spun by the museum guide stopped when the needle pointed to 1325. That was the year the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán (where modern-day Mexico City is located) was founded.[Note 2]\n\nThe intro with \"you've got mail\" is referencing the late AOL internet service which had just merged with Warner in one of the biggest mergers in history.\n\nAdaptations[]\n\nScholastic published a novelization using the same name on October 1, 2003. It was written by Jesse Leon McCann.\n\nThis movie inspired the tenth level of the game app Scooby-Doo! Mystery Cases, which is called The Legend of El Chupacabra.\n\nAnimation mistakes and/or technical glitches[]\n\nScooby's fore legs vanish for a split-second the moment he touches the water in the pool. (Though it's almost impossible to notice without slow motion.)\n\nWhen Doña Dolores was talking about Diego Fuente, her skirt and Velma's were switched to each other.\n\nWhen Charlene hands Luis the \"protective charm\" and tells him about its power, her collar is as pink as the rest of her blouse.\n\nWhen Chiquita was giggling at Scooby for walking into a gravestone, and laughing at the Chupacabra tripping over a pumpkin, her eyes were colored black instead of brown.\n\nWhen the Ghost of Señor Otero appeared, Sofia's right wrist band is missing.\n\nWhen Alejo tried to wake up Doña Dolores when she fainted, and Alejo comforting Luis, his wristwatch on his left arm is missing\n\nWhen Fred shows the gang how a tilde is used in the Spanish word for \"tomorrow,\" he writes the symbol over the wrong n, spelling the word as \"manaña\" instead of \"mañana.\"\n\nOn the VHS and DVD front covers, Daphne's scarf is purple instead of green.\n\nDuring the \"Mueve Mi Sangre\" chase when Velma is getting ready to throw the pumpkin, the entirety of El Chupacabra's face is a shade of purple instead of just it's chin/mouth area\n\nInconsistencies/continuity errors and/or goofs/oddities[]\n\nWhile in split-screen, the gang go from speaking out loud to themselves then to typing, and finally to just speaking without typing and somehow everybody seemingly knows what each other is saying. The four-way split-screen could be breaking the \"fourth wall\" for them, a narrative device so that the viewers will not be bored by watching an extended silent scene of people typing.\n\nIt's unexplained how Fred, a teen, got in contact with Alejo, a family man, with a business. (Although this is by no means the only such oddity in the franchise.)\n\nOnly Jorge is supposed to be Alejo and Sofia's kid, but Carolina, Sebastian, and Natalia are given the Otero name in the credits. It could be that they are distant cousins.\n\nEl Chupacabra is claimed by to be Mexico's version of Bigfoot, although such a description is grossly inaccurate for two reasons:\n\nEl Chupacabra is described is quite different from Bigfoot. There's two popular depictions of the creature: 1) A strange reptilian (sometimes humanoid) beast with big red eyes and sharp teeth or 2) a strange rabid wolf- or dog-like creature with gray fur.\n\nEl Chupacabra has its origins in Puerto Rico, not Mexico.\n\nThese mistakes could be explained as made by the ignorant American villains, but none of the locals point out any discrepancies.\n\nVelma incorrectly states that Teotihuacan (the pyramid complex where the gang emerges after following a secret passage from the Museum of Anthropology) was built by the Olmec civilization. Teotihuacan is thought to have been established around 200 BCE, in the highlands of Central Mexico, near Mexico City. The Olmec civilization flourished from 1500 BCE to 400 BCE in the Gulf Lowlands to the east and south.\n\nDuring the scenes of Paco framing the Mystery Inc and Alejo and Luis just before the tourists started chasing them on top of the Aztec pyramid, Alejo's clothes suddenly changed into the same colors as Luis'. Also, the angry tourists keep swapping positions.\n\nWhen Charlene is unmasked as the museum guide, only her wig and glasses are removed, even though she clearly wears a mask while disguised as the museum guide.\n\nDoña Dolores and Sofia witnessed El Chupacabra abducting Charlene off-screen, but it was later revealed that Charlene was El Chupacabra.\n\nMr. Smiley was likely the one in the costume for that particular incident.\n\nIn other languages[]\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Greek Scooby-Doo! και το Τέρας του Μεξικού Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico Russian Скуби-Ду и монстр из Мексики Scooby Doo and the Monster from Mexico Turkish Scooby Doo: Meksika Canavarı Scooby-Doo: Mexican Monster\n\nHome media[]\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico VHS released by Warner Home Video on September 30, 2003.\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico DVD released by Warner Home Video on September 30, 2003.\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico Blu-ray Disc released by Warner Home Video on March 12, 2013.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nImages[]\n\n[]\n\n[]"
