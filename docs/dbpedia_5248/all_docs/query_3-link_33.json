Eight years later, Scoob and Shaggy appeared in three made-for-TV films—part of the Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10 series. But it wasn’t until Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island that the long-running line of direct-to-video releases began.\n\nHere’s a list of every TV special/movie, direct-to-video release, and animated theatrical release in the Scooby-Doo universe.\n\nWhere to watch Scooby Goes Hollywood (1979)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers (1987)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School (1988)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf (1988)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights (1994)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo! and the Witch’s Ghost (1999)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (2000)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase (2001)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire (2003)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico (2003)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster (2004)\n\nWhere to watch Aloha, Scooby-Doo!

Sure, things are tonally awkward in the first film, and its villain twist is disappointing. But Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, and Linda Cardellini make for a fun time.\n\nAs far as the other live-action outings go, they exist. We wouldn’t blame you for skipping them. But a true Scooby fan would power through—with a box of Scooby Snacks in hand, of course.\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo: The Movie (2002)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004)\n\nWhere to watch Scooby-Doo!

There are typically many sales around Halloween.\n\nFor physical media collectors, most entries in the Scooby-Doo universe are widely accessible on DVD and Blu-ray via Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Some compilation DVDs even offer The Flintstones, The Jetsons, and The Yogi Bear Show alongside iconic Mystery Machine adventures—an ideal gift for fans of classic Hanna-Barbera animation.\n\nHow to watch Scooby-Doo FAQ\n\nIs Scooby-Doo on a streaming service?\n\nYes, Scooby-Doo is available across several streaming services—including Max, Netflix, and Tubi. You can also rent and purchase Scooby content through digital retailers like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and Fandango at Home.\n\nCan you watch Scooby-Doo on HBO?\n\nYes, you can watch Scooby-Doo series and movies on Max (formerly HBO Max). However, you won’t often find Scooby-Doo content on traditional HBO channels. Scooby and the gang usually appear on Boomerang and Cartoon Network.\n\nWhat streaming service has Scooby-Doo for free?\n\nYou can watch free episodes of various Scooby-Doo series across Tubi and YouTube. Tubi offers plenty of Scooby-Doo content under its Tubi Kids section, while the WB Kids YouTube channel hosts various Scooby episodes and clips. Internet Archive also has full Scooby-Doo episodes.\n\nIs Scooby-Doo on Disney+?\n\nNo, you won’t find Scooby-Doo movies or TV shows on Disney+. Warner Bros. Entertainment owns the Scooby-Doo franchise, and Walt Disney Studios is one of its main competitors. While studios often license content to services owned by other companies, it’s unlikely Scooby-Doo would ever appear on Disney’s streaming service."
