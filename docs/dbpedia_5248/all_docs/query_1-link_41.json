Mystery Incorporated is the 11th Scooby-Doo television series. Taking place in the small town of Crystal Cove, where the adults (especially Mayor Jones) often try to use the phony spooks as ways of making money, the show follows the kids as the mysteries they solve leads to an even bigger, even more dangerous, even more terrifying mystery. New to this series that separates it from other revivals of Scooby-Doo is the overarching story plot, the focus on the romantic relationships of the gang, and the darker tone of the show.\n\nSeason 1\n\n[edit]\n\nBeware the Beast from Below\n\n[edit]\n\n(First lines)\n\n(The gang cheers)\n\nVelma: Another mystery bites the dust.\n\nFred: Way to go, gang!\n\nDaphne: Let's celebrate!\n\nScooby: Yeah, celebrate.\n\n(Sheriff Stone closes the cell door)\n\nSheriff Stone: Better idea.\n\nFred: Aw, come on, Sheriff.\n\nSheriff Stone: Just cork it. You see this badge? Know why it's here?\n\nVelma: It came with the shirt?\n\nSheriff Stone: It's here because if there's a crime, I solve it. (goes to the office door) Oh, and by the way, I've called all your parents, who, by now, I have on speed dial. (mocking) Oh, are you in trouble. Especially you, Fred. Say hi to dad, the Mayor. (leaves)\n\nDaphne: Just once, it would be nice if someone thanked us for solving a mystery.\n\nFred: Good thing we're not in this to be liked. (Scooby, Shaggy, Velma and Daphne look a little annoying to him) Maybe that didn't come out quite right.\n\nShaggy: (after being attacked by the slime monster) Zoinks! Like, (laughs nervously) what was that?\n\nFred: (getting out of the Mystery Machine) It looks like a mystery to me, and I think that's just a little more important than school.\n\nDaphne: (finds locket) Fred, I found something! (Opens locket and music plays)\n\nFred: Huh. Could be a clue! Good work Daphne!\n\nDaphne: Thanks, Fred. You're so sweet.... (looks up. Fred has walked away, looking for clues) It's okay. We can talk later, um.....\n\nSheriff Stone: All right, you see what happens when you kids stick your noses where they don't belong? People get cocooned!\n\nShaggy: Like, man, we found them like that!\n\nDaphne: (trying to show what she means with her hands) Sheriff, there was a monster--\n\nSheriff Stone: Quiet. From this point forward this is a crime scene and future tourist attraction - stay out of it. (walks away)\n\nVelma: I gotta stay out of it right here. (holds up fist)\n\nFred: Let me talk to him. (walks away)\n\nDaphne: (dreamily) Don't worry. Fred will make him understand.\n\nFred: (runs back carrying body) Shaggy, start the car!\n\nShaggy: Like, I thought you were going to talk to him!\n\nFred: He wasn't in a listening mood.\n\nVelma: (opens back of the van) So you stole a body? Rockin!\n\nDaphne: (Angel opens door. Fred is lying down with his head on the record player) Fred? Fred, it's us. We're here for you. (sits down next to him. Scooby Doo licks his hair)\n\nFred: It's no use, gang. I was the one who stole the body and Professor Raffalo paid the price. I should have listened to my dad and stayed out of any new mysteries.\n\nVelma: We all helped steal the body, Fred.\n\nShaggy: Well, I actually never took pa- (Velma elbows him in the ribs) Okay, fine, yes we all took part, Freddie.\n\nDaphne: Fred Jones, you've never backed away from a mystery in your life.\n\nFred: I've got nothing!\n\nVelma: Man up, Fred! We still have our first clue, the cocoon! I brought a sample - Scooby, what are you doing? (Scooby is eating the slime from the cocoon)\n\nScooby: What? Rit's Ruitmeiers! Yummy! (Starts eating again)\n\nVelma: Eww!\n\nAngel: Check it out. If that dog mutates, I'm putting it down. Dead.\n\nShaggy: Like, hold on. I think I get it. (walks over and tastes the slime)\n\nDaphne, Fred, Velma, Angel: Ew!\n\nShaggy: No, you guys, it's Fruitmeier's! The cocoon is made of the same stuff as Fruitmeier's Deserts.\n\nDaphne, Fred, Velma, Angel: What? (They all get up and taste it)\n\nDaphne: You're right. But if the cocoon is made of Fruitmeier's Deserts...\n\nShaggy: That means if we capture the monster, we can have our own shop. And we can have an endless supply of Fruitmeier's Deserts. Oh boy.\n\nFred: No. It means that that slime mutant may not be a monster at all. What do we know about Franklin Fruitmeier?\n\nVelma: Franklin Fruitmeier. Showed up in town out of nowhere two months ago. Before that, nothing. He's hiring right now for female servers.\n\nFred: And that's our in.\n\nShaggy: If the girls can get jobs at Fruitmeier's, they can snoop around and find out more.\n\nFred: Great idea, Shag!\n\nShaggy: (he and Scooby are dressed as girls). Uh, this isn't exactly what I had in mind. Why are Scooby Doo and I dressed like girls when Velma and Daphne are girls?\n\nScooby: Yeah. My skirts too tight.\n\nDaphne: Because Velma and I refused. (Shaggy and Scooby glare at them)\n\nFred: This is gonna be awesome! (the cage eventually falls on him, Shaggy, Scooby, and Velma. The slime monster laughs and covers them in slime. Daphne gasps, then sees the slime mutant next to her)\n\nDaphne: Aaaahhh!!! (runs)\n\nVelma: Daphne, run! (Daphne runs past and jumps through hole in the ceiling, followed by slime mutant)\n\n(Scooby starts eating slime)\n\nFred: Eat, gang! It's Fruitmeier's!\n\nDaphne: Fred! You saved me!\n\nFred: Not right now, Daphne. I have to figure out why my trap didn't work.\n\nSheriff Stone: What is going on here?\n\nMayor Jones: Why is the town's latest tourist attraction cocooned to the wall?\n\nFred: Dad! Sheriff! Hold on. You don't understand. That is not a monster.\n\nMayor Jones: Oh, hopping steamed clams, Fred. Then who is it?\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma and Daphne: Franklin Fruitmeier.\n\nVelma: He was trying to rob Crystal Cove bank.\n\nSheriff Stone: Uhh, that's impossible. Franklin Fruitmeier's the one who called us. (Franklin arrives)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred: What?\n\nFranklin: I was making a clipper ship out of circus balloons when the silent alarm rang at my home. Oh, good gracious! What is that?\n\nShaggy: But if the monster isn't Franklin Fruitmeier, then, dude, who is it?\n\n(Scooby unmasks The Slime Mutant)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred: Professor Emmanuel Raffalo?\n\nEmmanuel: That's right. I was trying to scare people away from the sewers while I dug my way into the bank and got rich.\n\nDaphne: But you've got a job as a teacher. Why do you need more money?\n\n(Emmanuel doesn't answer)\n\nDaphne: Yeah, my bad.\n\nFred: Oh, yeah, right.\n\nShaggy: You're really getting ripped off.\n\nEmmanuel: I discovered that the Crystal Cove caves were connected to the sewer by accident while collecting mold spores for my class. Once I realized the cave led right under the bank, I put my plan into motion. Fruitmeier's gave me secret access to the sewer, so I decided to frame balloon boy for the crime by using his disgusting dessert. I staged my own disappearance to throw doubt on any hint of my involvement. Oh, it was foolproof, genius. That is, until you... you--\n\nSheriff Stone: Meddling.\n\nEmmanuel: Meddling. Yes, meddling kids and your blasted dog ruined everything.\n\nDaphne: Wait. (shows the locket) What about this locket we found where you were digging?\n\nEmmanuel: Never seen it before.\n\nSheriff Stone: All right. Well, guess we owe you kids thanks. You did save the bank. Although you also lost the town a serious revenue stream. Stream of revenue!\n\nFred: You okay, Daph?\n\nDaphne: I just don't get it. If this locket didn't belong to Professor Raffalo, then who?\n\n(The telephone rings, Shaggy pressed the button)\n\nShaggy: Like, K-Ghoul 101.4. What can we scare up for you, daddy-o?\n\nMr. E: You're all doomed.\n\nShaggy: Like, uh-uh-- Like, who--who is this?\n\nMr. E: You can call me Mr. E. You should never have brought that locket out of the cave. You don't know what you've uncovered.\n\nDaphne: Uncovered? Uncovered what?\n\nMr. E: A truth that should have remained hidden the truth behind the curse of Crystal Cove. The real mystery has just begun.\n\nScooby: Scooby... Dooby... Doo.\n\nThe Creeping Creatures\n\n[edit]\n\nScooby: What is it?\n\nShaggy: Like, um, I think it's a box.\n\n(Fred and Daphne glare at him annoyed)\n\n(Fred opens the box)\n\nVelma: (picks up a card inside) It's from Mr. E! (reads) Saved this for a rainy day. Enjoy.\n\nDaphne: Mr. E gives me the creeps. (Fred starts to open the box) Fred, careful. That could be a bomb! (Fred pulls out a purse) Ooh, strike that. Cute purse! (reaches for it, but Velma takes it)\n\nFred: Check it out! 100% pure gator. Made in Gatorsburg!\n\nScooby: Ratorsburg?\n\nDaphne: But that's impossible! Gatorsburg hasn't manufactured Gator products in decades!\n\nVelma: Not since the gator mines dried up!\n\nScooby: Rator mines?\n\nFred: Gang, we have a mystery on our hands!\n\nVelma: Oh, sweet Christmas, finally!\n\nMrs. Dinkley: Hello?\n\nMayor Jones: Yello.\n\nMrs. Blake: Yes?\n\nVelma: (into phone) Hey, Mom. We're stuck in Gatorsburg.\n\nFred: (into phone) The van broke down.\n\nDaphne: (into phone) Think you could come and get us?\n\nMrs. Dinkley: Oh, I wish I could, but tonight's race night! You know me and horses! Venus is in it's third retro grade which means I'm betting on Sick Little Monkey to show.\n\nMayor Jones: Meddling mushroom caps, Fred! I've already got the recliner in the reclined position. There's no going back from that.\n\nMrs. Blake: Oh, sweetie, it's dark out. I can't go out in the dark. (Fred, Daphne, and Velma hang up)\n\nShaggy: (calls and gets the answering machine) Oh, wait. Duh. It's still life night.\n\nVelma: (slyly) I guess we're here for the whole night.\n\nScooby: And Scooby Dooby too!\n\nGreta Gator: I got a few hotel rules. (Fred enters the room, but Greta blocks Daphne and Velma) Rule number one: Boys and girls in separate rooms. No exceptions!\n\nVelma: Then I guess I'm with you, Daphne.\n\nGreta: I said no exceptions!\n\nVelma: But, I'm a girl.\n\nGreta: Oh, right. Rule number two: stay in your rooms, no matter what you hear. That includes screams, moans, wails, pounding, claws scratching, and anything that sounds like a body being dragged across a hard-wood floor.\n\nFred: Okayy...\n\nFred: (showing Daphne his trap scrapbook)....and I left a few pages blank, you know, for future traps.\n\nDaphne: (extremely bored) Good thinking. (Scooby bursts into the room, terrified and panting)\n\nFred: Scoob! What's the matter?\n\nDaphne: He's trying to tell us something! (Scooby tries to show them what he means)\n\nFred: Tater people! Uh, crater sneeple? (Scooby starts wheezing) Skater feeple!\n\nDaphne: (stands up) Gator people! (Scooby sighs in relief)\n\n(The police car arrives)\n\nFred: Time to find out who these greedy gators really are. (unmasks the Creeping Creatures)\n\nDaphne: Grady Gator?\n\nShaggy: Greta Gator?\n\nScooby: Gunther Gator?\n\nFred: But why?\n\nGrady: After we ran out of gators, everybody moved OUT of Gatorsburg. But not us.\n\nGreta: This here's our HOME.\n\nDaphne: So with no alligators left, you decided to make imitation gator products and pass them off as real.\n\nVelma: But you couldn't have anyone snooping around Gatorsburg. So you created the Creeping Creatures to scare people away.\n\nFred: Then you could run your gator ring without anyone knowing who you were or what you were up to.\n\nShaggy: Like, that is one ridiculous plan.\n\nGunther: And you know what? We would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling juveniles and your unauthorized investigation of our synthetic gator accessories.\n\nSheriff Stone: You're telling me this gator stuff is fake? I paid a fortune for this track suit!\n\nVelma: Sorry, Sheriff.\n\nSheriff Stone: (sighs) Man, I gotta get out of this suit. This fake gator doesn't breathe. I'm starting to smell a little... funky. Arrest them... even though I have absolutely NO JURISDICTION HERE! (drives away)\n\nFred: Wait, Sheriff. can you give us a ride? The Mystery Machine isn't...\n\n(The engine of Mistery Machine is revving)\n\nEveryone: (gasp)\n\nShaggy: Zoinks! Like, there's no engine in the Mystery Machine. It's haunted!\n\n(Fred opens the hood, there's a letter of Mr. E)\n\nVelma: It's from Mr. E.\n\nDaphne: (opens the letter and reads) \"Hope you had a good time in Gatorsburg. But be warned, there are more mysteries to come. This is only one piece of the puzzle\".\n\nFred: Puzzle? What's that supposed to mean?\n\nShaggy: Like, I've got a bad feeling we're gonna find out. Oh.\n\n(The lightning appears loudly in the sky, Shaggy grabs Scooby whimpering)\n\nThe Secret of the Ghost Rig\n\n[edit]\n\nPolice Officer: You realize you were speeding?\n\nTeenage Driver: Y-yes, I do, Officer.\n\nPolice Officer: Okay, as long as you know.\n\nMayor Jones: Ah, Fred my boy! Today is a very exciting day for you, because today you learn the family business: politics!\n\nFred: Politics? That's adult stuff! You know, kids my age are into traps and solving mysteries!\n\nMayor Jones: No they're not, son! You're going to learn all the vital things I do for this community, like create pamphlets and strategize about new places to put parking meters.\n\nVelma: I know a place he can put another parking meter.\n\nRung: Anyway, give me a jingle and we'll plan a magical night on the town. (glances at his watch) Oh yeah, the life of the seventh largest regional ladder manufacturer never stops. Sorry, but I gotta rung.\n\nDaphne: Are you trying to set me up with - him? What about Fred?\n\nMr. Blake: You're just friends, right?\n\nDaphne: Well, yeah - but we're really good friends. And I don't know, it feels like cheating. On a friend.\n\nMrs. Blake: Darling, think of it like trying a new cut of meat. Why have ground beef, when you can have a nice prime rib?\n\nDaphne: But I don't even like meat! I like vegetables. Like Fred.\n\nMayor Jones: What's going on here - (notices George Avocados) Avocados.\n\nAvocados: That's Avocados.\n\nVelma: (flirtatiously) You know, Shag, I have plenty of food back at my place.\n\nShaggy: Um, like, thanks Velma, but Scooby Doo has had his tongue tattooed with a map of every single pizza joint in town. As you can see, we got it covered.\n\nVelma: Yeah, in drool.\n\nSheriff Stone: And so you're saying this ghost truck disappeared like a, uh... ghost truck.\n\nScooby: Yep, that's pretty much it.\n\nSheriff Stone: Well, looks like you kids might have stumbled onto a new tourist attraction.\n\nShaggy: Tourist attraction? Like, man, it nearly dumped us in the cove!\n\nVelma: Besides, we're not even sure it was a ghost!\n\nSheriff Stone: I'm sorry, but didn't you say there was no driver? That's textbook ghost truck, case closed!\n\nVelma: I knew it! Anyone with hair that perfect has to be guilty of something.\n\nMayor Jones: (caught in Fred's trap) Screaming pandas, what is the meaning of this?\n\nFred: Dad, we think George Avocados is the ghost trucker, and he's trying to sabotage your reelection!\n\nMayor Jones: That's completely absurd. Why would a ghost drive a truck when everyone knows they can fly? Especially an eighteen wheeler, those require a Class Six license.\n\nScooby: Nice going, Raggy. (laughs) Good job.\n\nMayor Jones: (arrives) Pickled porcupines. What's going on here, Fred? I was in my office working late, when suddenly it sounds like some demonic force is tearing apart city hall. Tell me it's true.\n\nFred: It's even better, dad. We caught the Ghost Trucker. And he's none other than...\n\nThe Ghost Trucker: Let me out of here! Aaah! (crawls from out of the Ghost Truck and falls to the ground) Uhh!\n\nEveryone: Rung Ladderton?\n\nRung: Ooh, ahh, shock. Yeah, yeah, that's right. And I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling... peers.\n\nDaphne: Of course. It all makes sense. Rung was using the Ghost Truck to smuggle doorknobs out of Crystal Cove, so he could find Theodore Avocados' missing diamond.\n\nFred: Avocados disguised the diamond as a doorknob. That's why it was never found.\n\nRung: You are correct, my little ascot-wearing friend, but that idiot Avocados didn't say in his journal which crystal knob was really the diamond. So, I had to steal 'em all. And what better way than with a Ghost Truck to smuggle them all out of town?\n\nVelma: We should have known. The other guy who bought the tires was G. Nurno Treddal, a name far too ridiculous to be real, because it's Rung Ladderton spelled backwards!\n\nFred: But Rung, you're rich. You've got everything: ladders, ascots. Why did you need a diamond?\n\nRung: I inherited a ladder company. We make the one product in the world that no one ever replaces. Ladders don't wear out like TVs or personal trainers over 40. (Sheriff Stone handcuffs Rung) No, no. They're built to last, which means no sales. The company's broke.\n\nDaphne: I don't think you'll be needing this anymore. (removes Rung's orange ascot)\n\n(Sheriff Stone takes Rung into custody)\n\nFred: Thanks, Daph.\n\nDaphne: No worries. I'm always here for you, Fred. (removes the purple ascot and puts the orange one to Fred) Seriously, right here.\n\nMayor Jones: I gotta hand it to you, Fred. Your traps actually came in handy this time.\n\nFred: Gee, dad. Does this mean you finally accept what I want to do with my life?\n\nMayor Jones: (laughs) Oh Fred. No.\n\nRevenge of the Man Crab\n\n[edit]\n\nDylan: Here, I brought some water.\n\nBrenda: Ew, I don't want any of that fatty fat water! I want Trickells' Trickquid!\n\nDylan: Trickell's Trickquid is water.\n\nBrenda: Um, no, it's one hundred percent diet moisture.\n\nVelma: Ugh, not that place! That guy's a total freak!\n\nShaggy: No, he's, like, totally cool! Just don't mention his nose.\n\nVelma: Hey there, Cappy! What happened to the old sniffer? (Shaggy groans)\n\nSkipper Shelton: What happened? I'll tell it for you! It was a clam that took it, fierce and mighty was he, and reduced me to wearing facial underwear he did! But I'll find him, and I won't stop shucking till I do. Understand?\n\nVelma: Yes sir, Captain Admiral, sir!\n\nDaphne: You know, we're still close to the water. All kinds of fish in there.\n\nFred: (watching the volleyball game) Yep, they're so beautiful!\n\nDaphne: The girls?\n\nFred: No, the nets!\n\nDaphne: The nets?\n\nFred: I wonder what their tensile strength is? They're nylon, absolutely perfect for traps!\n\nFred: We can't let that thing get away!\n\nShaggy: Sure we can, Fred! All we have to do is stand right here!\n\nScooby: Yeah, stand right here!\n\nVelma: Wow, who are you trying to impress?\n\nDaphne: What, this old thing? I've had it forever. I just want to do a good job. Would you rub oil on my back? Fred likes shiny things, and I'm tired of him staring at nets.\n\nFred: There's a book over here. Daphne read a book once. And that chair, Daphne liked to sit in chairs. And that card catalogue over there -\n\nVelma: Not helping, Fred.\n\nFred: I know. What's wrong with me?\n\nVelma: Hey, Daphne? Let me ask you something. If you liked a boy -\n\nDaphne: Who told you? Was it one of my sisters? [ Daphne mad at Velma] Dawn! Ha! She thinks she's so perfect. Well, what no one knows is, she has a sixth toe on her -\n\nVelma: Um, what are you talking about?\n\nDaphne: I - clearly, not what you were talking about...\n\nShaggy: Like, we've got him!\n\nVelma: Good going! But how did you find your way out?\n\nScooby: (sniffing) Clam cones.\n\nVelma: You were saved by junk food?\n\nShaggy: Like, what can I say? Junk food and me have a very special relationship.\n\nVelma: Maybe I should ask it for advice.\n\nFred: Speaking of clam cones, I see Skipper Shelton isn't around again. Or are you, Skipper? (unmasks the Man Crab)\n\nSkipper: (arrives) Ah, back from the Laundromat, I am. And once more does me nose-hammock smell fresh as the morning tide.\n\nDaphne: Wait, if you're not the Man Crab, then who...?\n\nVelma: Everyone, meet Bud Shelton. (grabs Bud's head out of Man Crab disguise)\n\nScooby, Shaggy and Daphne: Who?\n\nVelma: The Trickell's Triquid mascot.\n\nBud: And the inventor, not that dirtball, Trickell.\n\nShaggy: Like, how did you know, Velma?\n\nVelma: I knew it wasn't a real crab because Daphne never got allergic when she was around it. Plus, when I saw the mole pattern on the cheek of man next to Trickell in the newspaper, I remembered the same pattern on the mascot.\n\nBud: He took the credit for my creation. It was supposed to be called Bud's Bloosh. I was still working on the name. I spent countless hours making the Man Crab costume and even more time building my system of trap doors and stairs under the beach. And in case anyone came snooping in between kidnappings, I hid my costume in a locker big enough to hold it, putting a label with Skipper's name on it over the real label. So if anyone found it, they'd blame him.\n\nDaphne: All that work just to get back at Mr. Trickell? Wouldn't it have been easier and-- more legal to sue him?\n\nBud: Are you kidding? Lawyers take forever. I would have succeeded, too, if it weren't for you meddling brats probing into my crustacean-themed revenge scheme.\n\nSkipper: Well, \"almost\" doesn't shuck the clam, (to Scooby) does it, wolfie?\n\n(Skipper and Scooby laugh)\n\nScooby: I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nThe Song of Mystery\n\n[edit]\n\nVelma: Shaggy, you promised me you weren't going to use the word 'like' so much. It makes you sound ignorant.\n\nShaggy: Oh, right. Like, um, I forgot.\n\nDaphne: They can't just leave all the kids!\n\nSheriff Stone: They'll be fine. We'll air drop in some freeze dried camp food. Just because they're 'spookified' doesn't mean they can't reconstitute macaroni!\n\nVelma: Here, pick out a new pair of pants.\n\nShaggy: What's wrong with my pants?\n\nVelma: You promised me you were going to start caring more about your appearance.\n\nShaggy: But I like those pants.\n\nVelma: You've worn them since the eight grade.\n\nShaggy: They're comfortable pants\n\nVelma: Fine.\n\nMrs. Dinkley: (giving tour) This is the location of the most recent attack by the creature that's been spookifying the children of Crystal Cove. (notices the gang) Velma, sweetheart, how are you? (yelling) Sheriff, they're back!\n\nVelma: Mom, please! We just wanted to see what was happening!\n\nMrs. Dinkley: There's nothing to see. Not unless you're paying.\n\nDr. Portillo: The peoples have long told the tale of Qué Horrífico. A normal man by day, but every sundown he changes into Qué Horrífico. He roams through the villages and plays his song of mystery on a pan flute, turning the childrens into... Terriblegatos!\n\nFred: In America, we call it 'getting spookified'.\n\nDr. Portillo: That is good enough, thank you. Eventually, he takes them to his spooky town, or cave or something. There's a lot of debate on that, who can really know.\n\nMary Anne Gleardan: Fred Jones, Jr. You were supposed to meet me in the library for your civics tutoring.\n\nFred: Mary Anne, I can't. I have something important I need to do.\n\nMary Anne Gleardan: What could possibly be more important than civics?\n\nDr. Portillo: Oh no! I think - I think [the transformation] is happening! Oh no! It's happening! It's happening! AHHH! Here it comes! Oh, I so scared! I so scared! Here it comes! Oh - No, it's just gas.\n\nDaphne: This is nice.\n\nFred: Watch it, Daphne! Remember, we're married; don't look so happy!\n\nVelma: It's almost sunset. We'd better get inside.\n\nFred: Right. (loudly) Come, two young children, it's bedtime! Grandma's gonna tell you a story!\n\nShaggy: Oh goodie!\n\nFred: Quick, get inside.\n\n(Inside, ready for trap)\n\nScooby: Aren't you going to tell us a story?\n\nVelma: Yes, The End. Now shh.\n\n(Mayor Jones and Sheriff Stone arrive)\n\nMayor Jones: What in the name of whole wheat toast is going on?\n\nFred: We got him, dad.\n\n(Scooby unmasks Qué Horrífico)\n\nMary Anne Gleardan: You mean her.\n\nFred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy: Mary Anne Gleardan.\n\nMayor Jones: Your tutor? But why?\n\nMary Anne Gleardan: I was trying to scare all the adults out of Crystal Cove so I could run the city my way. (hocking) (to Fred) I told you, I have brilliant ideas. (to everyone) With all the adults gone, there's be no one to stand in my way. I learned about the legend of Qué Horrífico in Dr. Portillo's honors class. It was the perfect solution. I used the high school's theater department for my costume. I went to every kindergarten and elementary school in the city to convince the children to pretend to be spookified. In return I offered them Utopia! When that didn't work, I offered them candy. Whenever the children heard me playing the pan flute, that was their signal to put on their fake hair and fangs and commence spookification. I almost had the whole town cleared of adults. I would have, too, if it weren't for you (speaks latin)\n\nFred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby: Huh?\n\nMary Anne Gleardan: (sighs) Loosely translated it means \"Meddlesome kids\" in latin.\n\nArthur: I'm going home. I miss my mom and dad. (The other kids say goodbyes and walk into their homes) By the way, this was lame.\n\n(Sheriff Stone handcuffs Mary Anne)\n\nMary Anne Gleardan: Wait, you're taking me to jail? But I'm just a kid!\n\nSheriff Stone: Do you know how many boxes we're stuck with of Qué Horrífico t-shirts, Qué Horrífico pamphlets, Qué Horrífico dance CDs, Qué Horrífico--?\n\nMary Anne Gleardan: Okay, okay. I see your point.\n\nThe Legend of Alice May\n\n[edit]\n\nDaphne: I'm telling you, she's up to something!\n\nFred: C'mon, Daphne. So, Alice was using the shower and hanging out in the school basement late at night. Haven't we all?\n\nDaphne: What if Alice is the ghost girl the Sheriff mentioned? You could be in danger, Fred.\n\nFred: Don't you think I'd know if she were a ghost girl?\n\nVelma: I'd be willing to bet... no.\n\nScooby: Yeah, me too.\n\nShaggy: Yeah, like, what do we really know about Alice?\n\nFred: You mean, besides the fact that she's super nice, and her hair smells like peaches, and sometimes I get lost in her eyes, and -\n\nDaphne: Fred Jones, do you like this girl?\n\nFred: (points at his \"watch\") Wow, look at the time.\n\nDaphne: You're not wearing a watch, Freddie.\n\nFred: Oh. Well, I'd better go find one, then!\n\nAngel: Looks like your ghost girl's building herself... a man posse.\n\nShaggy: Zoinks! Like, what if Fred's her latest possum?\n\nDelilah: Hey, baby sis. Something got you down.\n\nDaphne: Hey, Delilah. It's okay, I'm fine.\n\nDelilah: No, no, I can tell. Same way I can tell when I look in the eyes of the enemy and see their cold, grey heart and know it's either me, or them.\n\nDaphne: Uh, okay...\n\nDelilah: Ah, boy trouble. I've been Fear's bunkmate before. Let me tell you a story. There was a beach. Enemy dug in along the shore. They picked us off one by one but I knew I had to get my men through, understand?\n\nDaphne: No.\n\nDelilah: All right, here's another story -\n\nDaphne: Delilah, really, don't worry. I'm gonna figure this out.\n\nDelilah: I hear you. Call if you need me. Whoo-aahh!\n\nShaggy: Like, wow! I didn't know this year's prom theme was terror and pandemonium!\n\nVelma: What's going on?\n\nEthan: Somebody's mom is trying to kill Fred.\n\nGary: Yeah, thanks, Mystery Geeks, for wrecking our prom.\n\nGhost Girl: Don't touch me!\n\nMayor Jones: (arrives with Sheriff Stone) Hazy fantasie, Fred. Didn't you hear me when I said, \"if you see a ghost girl, do not go to the prom with her\".?\n\nFred: Don't worry, dad. She may look like a ghost girl, but in reality she's... (unmasks the ghost girl) Alice May. Or she's also known as...\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred: Alice Carlswell.\n\nSheriff Stone: Carlswell? As in Deacon Carlswell? The Creeper?\n\nAlice: That is right. He was my father. When daddy was in prisoned, I vowed revenge on those who put him there. I used his old costume to construct my own. When I found the legend of the evil ghost girl online, I was ready to spring my trap. I grabbed that fool Randy to throw you all off the track. And I kept him hidden and fed in my father's crypt until I could let him go. After that, it was just a matter of getting rid of your precious leader, and Fred. I'm going to zap your gang the way you feeded my father. And I would have succeeded, too, if it weren't for you meddling... schoolmates... of mine.\n\nIn Fear of the Phantom\n\n[edit]\n\nFred: Perfect! Daphne's our phantom bait.\n\nDaphne: Oh, this is so exciting - wait. Bait?\n\nSheriff Stone: All right, now let me get this straight; these T-shirts are fifty dollars each, this is cotton, right? The kind that comes from cows?\n\nVelma: Sheriff, you need to focus. The phantom has already taken Daphne!\n\nSheriff Stone: Right. Where's Daphne?\n\nShaggy, Velma, Scooby, and The Hex Girls: The phantom took her away!\n\nSheriff Stone: All right, now we're getting somewhere! And by the way, what's wrong with the Jones kid? He's acting a little... squirrely.\n\nFred: Daphne. Now. I need to talk to her.\n\nDaphne: (dressed as crush) Daphne's gone. Call me Crush.\n\nFred: Darn it, lady, I'm serious! Where is she?\n\nDaphne: Urgh, Fred. It's me, okay?\n\nFred: Uh... oh. I need to tell you something and I need you to listen. I'm not a guy anymore.\n\nDaphne: What?\n\nFred: I have feelings! I care!\n\nHarry: If you had a lizard face, I'd still love you, Scooby.\n\nScooby: And I'd love you, Harry. More Sandwich?\n\nShaggy: Like, okay, you know what? Enough! You can't replace me with a dummy!\n\nScooby: Do you hear something, Harry?\n\nShaggy: Like, there is no Harry. Harry is you, and like, dude, I am your best friend!\n\nHarry: Um, no, I don't think so.\n\nShaggy: Why don't you just stay out of it, Harry? And, like, stop watching Vincent van Ghoul movies. That's mine and Scooby Doo's thing!\n\nHarry: Really? Cause Scooby Doo thought you cared more about girls and going to proms! (Shaggy begins to wrestle with 'Harry' before realizing that Harry's a puppet)\n\nShaggy: Wait, wha - what am I doing?\n\nMayor Jones: (arrives with Sheriff Stone) Bug-eyed biscuits, Fred. Couldn't you have waited until after the show to catch the phantom?\n\nFred: Sorry, dad. Not with Daphne in danger. (unmasks the phantom)\n\nEveryone: Daniel Frizette?\n\nShaggy: Or, like, should we call you Fantzee Pantz?\n\nHex Girls: Fantzee Pantz?\n\nGus: Doth my eye shadow deceive? How did you know?\n\nFred: The villain had to be someone close to the Hex Girls to access the stage.\n\nShaggy: And the Hex Girls' equipment.\n\nScooby: And their bus.\n\nVelma: Someone with a grudge against the Hex Girls.\n\nDaniel: The Hex Girls took my career. I tried to get revenge by writing bad songs for them, but they can make anything a hit. So, I became the phantom. And I'd do it again if it weren't for the uncanny boy band knowledge of you meddling brats!\n\nSheriff Stone: Let's go.\n\nThe Grasp of the Gnome\n\n[edit]\n\nSheriff Stone: No admittance. This is a quarantined area. Besides, the movie's already started.\n\nScooby: You're showing them a movie?\n\nShaggy: Yeah, aren't they, like, frozen with gnomey magic?\n\nSheriff Stone: I already saw the movie. Believe me, magically frozen is the perfect viewing state to be in.\n\nFred: Now let's see who you really are. (unmasks the Gnome)\n\nDaphne, Velma and Scooby: (gasp) The Court Fool? Uh-Oh.\n\nAmanda Littlefoot: That's my husband, Gill Littlefoot! What did you think you were doing, fool? (hits Gill with her staff)\n\nGill: What I've wanted to do for years: Frame you for the gnome attacks. And once you were out of the way, take your fortune for my own. (Amanda hits him again) Ow! Will you stop that?\n\nVelma: But you're too tall. How could you ever be the gnome?\n\nGill: There's a reason our family name is Littlefoot. (takes off the gnome disguise to reveal his real size) (Everyone gasp) I planned this over a year. And while I've always hid my tiny legs, this finally provided me a way to make them useful. Since Amanda's dislike of pirates was well known, I planted her earring on a victim, hoping to throw suspicion her way. I used my toxin-coated gloves to paralyze all the pirates, but you would not quit. The beautiful part is that because of my--\n\nSheriff Stone: I believe the medical term is baby legs.\n\nGill: No one would have ever suspected me. That is, until you, meddling, gnome-hating, pirate-loving--\n\nSheriff Stone: Yeah, yeah, Shrimpo, we got the picture.\n\nAmanda Littlefoot: (annoyed) All these years, you've looked down on me. Now it turns out I'm actually taller than you. (hits Gill again with her staff)\n\nGill: Ow!\n\nSheriff Stone: Let's go, little footy. (laughs)\n\nMayor Jones: Boy, I had big plans for him! Thanks for nothing-- again.\n\nFred: Anytime, pop.\n\nBattle of The Humungonauts\n\n[edit]\n\nMayor Jones: So they didn't show! I don't see why we couldn't just seize the ticket money as evidence. Prancing piccolos, Fred. One of your traps actually worked!\n\nSheriff Stone: Greetings, big and hairy space travelers. As a representative of planet Earth, I welcome you.\n\nVelma: I'm afraid these two aren't space travelers, Sheriff. I'd like to introduce (unmasks the Green Humungonaut) Max Minner and (unmasks the Red Humungonaut) Jax Minner.\n\nSheriff Stone: It's the Minner brothers? They've been taking care of all of Crystal Cove's insurance needs for years.\n\nMayor Jones: But how did you know they'd both show up here?\n\nVelma: All I did was double insure the boat repair shop with a policy from both brothers. You see, each brother was only attacking the places the other brother insured.\n\nMayor Jones: But why?\n\nMax: What do you think? Money.\n\nJax: And the fact that we can't stand each other.\n\nMax: Oh, yeah. That, too.\n\nJax: This intense dislike started back when we were circus strongmen. We had just come up with a great idea for our act: The Hercules apes...\n\nSheriff Stone: Humongonauts is catchier.\n\nJax: When this jerk decides to break up our act and join a rival circus.\n\nMax: Huh! You were just jealous.\n\nJax: We became bitter enemies who, as chance would have it, both went into the insurance business here in Crystal Cove.\n\nMax: After that, we each focused on the same thing: Destroying each other's business.\n\nJax: And it would have worked, too, if it weren't for...\n\nMax and Jax: My meddling brother! (look each other) What? Why you? (start fighting)\n\nVelma: Mystery solved.\n\nHowl of The Fright Hound\n\n[edit]\n\nSheriff Stone: What's going on? I heard what sounded like some sort of hideous, undying machine in here.\n\nDaphne: We've solved the mystery of the Fright Hound.\n\nFred: And your culprit is... (opens the hood of the mysterious person)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred: Jason's mom?\n\nJason's mother: That's right, it was me all along. I saw how you treated my Jason at school. So naturally I did what any mother would do. I built a demonic robot dog to destroy you! I framed your little doggy friend to break you up, leaving Jason a clear shot at his true love. But when you showed up and blamed him of all things, I decided to GET RID OF YOU ALL! I gave up a career in military robotics to raise my son, not to watch him get triped on!\n\nJason: Now Velma will never want to be my girlfriend. And she would have, too, if it weren't for my meddling mom!\n\nVelma: I'm sorry, Jason. I should have been clearer with you earlier. But you and me, it's just not gonna happen. But we can still be friends.\n\nJason: Really?\n\nVelma: Yeah. You took that very well.\n\nJason: And you touched my knuckle again. Ha ha! (kisses his fingers)\n\nThe Secret Serum\n\n[edit]\n\nVampire: Aaahh! Let me go! I'll drain you all!\n\nDaphne: Mom! Your vampiring is tearing this family apart! I'm sorry, but you've left me no choice. I'm going to have to stake you.\n\nVampire: Wait! I'm not a vampire! I'm-- (unmasks herself)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred: Sheila Altoonian.\n\nDaphne: But why?\n\nSheila: Isn't it obvious? My looks are starting to fade.\n\nShaggy: No. You're gorgeous.\n\nFred: No. Your skin is as tight as my ascot.\n\nSheila: This is all your mother's fault. We're the same age, but she's so beautiful. She has the skin of a teenager. That's when I realized she must be a vampire. I went to the Dinkley Shop to do a little research and found the recipe for the youth juice. That potion was gonna make me young and beautiful forever. You see, in college I majored in zoology and acrobatics, studying the habits of flying squirrels. I propelled myself into the air with my quad and glute muscles. All this gave me the illusion of a real flying Vampire.\n\nDaphne: Why didn't you just try maybe wearing a little less makeup? Or a cuter haircut? Or use tape to pull back all your wrinkly sacks of. (grabs her cheeks with hands) You know, age gracefully.\n\nSheila: Age gracefully? Are you crazy? No, the Vampire serum was my only hope. And I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling--\n\nNan Blake: What's going on here?\n\nDaphne: Mom!\n\nSheila: Even now, she's stealing my moment.\n\nDaphne: I'm so glad you're not an undead creature of darkness.\n\nNan Blake: Thanks, honey.\n\nDaphne: But what are you doing here? Why have you been sneaking out?\n\nNan Blake: I didn't want to say anything, but I've been taking night classes. I'm getting my public notary degree!\n\nVelma: Oh, how exciting.\n\nShaggy: What an opportunity.\n\nNan Blake: You know, I may be outrageously gorgeous, but knowledge, knowledge is the key to true beauty. Well, I better get going. I have to figure out what a notary is before tomorrow's final exam. (laughs)\n\nThe Shrieking Madness\n\n[edit]\n\nShaggy: Like, you don't hear many monsters from other dimensions scream for help.\n\n(Fred ties the Char Gar Gothakon's mouth with ascot)\n\nVelma: This is no monster. (unmasks Char Gar Gothakon) It's Howard E. Roberts, Hatecraft's student assistant and biggest fan. Just as I suspected.\n\nShaggy: Suspected how?\n\nVelma: Think about it. We found a book written by Hatecraft, with sentences underlined that smelled like Char Gar Gothakon.\n\nHoward: Of course it was me. Someone had to defend the Professor against his critics. And what better way than to dress as his greatest creation? Fortunately, I'd taken a class in the military application of sonic shriek technology at the learning annex. Although, in retrospect, it might not have been a good idea to glue real octopus legs to my face.\n\nEveryone: Ah, so that was the smell!\n\nVelma: But when Hatecraft admitted he made it up?\n\nHoward: That's when he had to fall. And he would have, too, if it weren't for the dark elder forces conspiring in the inky black of time most foul! Oh. And you meddling kids.\n\n(The police takes Howard into custody)\n\nHarlan Ellison: H.P., are you all right?\n\nProfessor Hatecraft: Harlan. Yes. Just an overeager fan who got carried away.\n\nHarlan Ellison: Fans. Imbeciles fit only to be gnawed by rabid rats.\n\nProfessor Hatecraft: Yes. Someone could write a book.\n\nHarlan Ellison: How about, \"A boy and his fans\", by Harlan Ellison and H.P. Hatecraft?\n\nProfessor Hatecraft: I was thinking something more along the lines of, \"Shavu-ra hatafar, the fan that had no name\".\n\nHarlan Ellison: Except, uh, you just named it.\n\nProfessor Hatecraft: Don't start with me, Ellison.\n\nWhen the Cicada Calls\n\n[edit]\n\nShaggy: Like, I don't think it's Dr. Yantz!\n\nVelma: Really? You think?\n\nFred: Now, get him!\n\n(Scooby grabs the Cicada Creature's hat)\n\nEveryone: Grandma Moonbeam?\n\n(Sheriff Stone, Mayor Jones and the photographer arrive)\n\nMayor Jones: Did we miss it? Where are the bugs?\n\nFred: You're the Cicada Creature? But why?\n\nGrandma Moonbeam: Isn't it obvious? I wanted to shut down Destroido. I found out they added a secret ingredient to make nature slivers more tasty: Landfill waste! I demanded that they return to my original healthy recipe, but they refused, and because they owned it, there was nothing I could DO. I vowed to get even. I saw a Norwegian documentary about a researcher using sound waves to control penguins' movements. I decided to adapt the idea for my revenge. Since I didn't have any penguins, I used cicadas. And I would have succeeded, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling young people.\n\nSheriff Stone: Well, now, it's the big house for you, grandma. Let's go.\n\nMayor Jones: (sighs) Why can't anything in this town ever turn out to be real?\n\nFred: Glad we could help, dad.\n\nVelma: Well, another mystery successfully solved.\n\nMystery Solvers Club State Finals\n\n[edit]\n\nTaffy-Dare: i was born in 1994 when i was a kid in 1997\n\nVelma: Look at that. For the time ever, the sidekicks have solved the mystery.\n\nScooby: Now, let's see exactly who Lord Infernicus is. (unmasks the Lord Infernicus)\n\nEveryone: The Funky Phantom?!\n\nMudsy: That's me, don't you know.\n\nScooby: But why?\n\nMudsy: I was sick of being a sidekick. Resentful, even. I'm not a real ghost. I'm Jonathan Wellington Muddlemore, actor, thespian, dramatator. I was behind in my rent at the Y, so a friend told me about this clock I could squat in. When they found me and thought I was a ghost, I figured why not. Ghost gig got me 3 hots and a cot, but I got tired of taking a back seat, don't you know. I wanted to headline. I wanted to be the boss. In charge, even. With my own sidekicks. That's when I stumbled upon the mystery solvers state finals. I had workshopped my Lord Infernicus character at various comedy clubs and state fairs around the country. And it has always been a hit. It was a simple matter to use mirrors and a video projector to make myself appear and fly. A little smoke, fireworks, a skeleton puppet identical to my own bone structure for close-up work, a pre-recorded voice, and the deed was done. I even abducted my own cat Boo. The plan was to ship everyone off to Africa, where there is a desperate need for teenage mystery solvers. I then created the ruse with the Guinea pigs; sewing each of their tiny costumes by hand, using the actual vintage fabrics of their real life counterparts just to throw you off track. It was perfect. Genius, even. Until your ridiculous dog started acting like a HERO instead of a SIDEKICK.\n\nScooby: (annoyed) Ohhh.\n\nBoo the Cat: You lied to me. Meow! (attacks Mudsy)\n\nShaggy: Like, Scoob, looks like you and your pals are the heroes of this mystery. Let's hear it for the sidekicks. Hip hip--\n\nEveryone: Hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!\n\nThe Wild Brood\n\n[edit]\n\nBiker Dude: Hey, little muffin, how 'bout you and me go for a moonlight ride?\n\nGirl: No thanks, I'm allergic to the stink of desperation.\n\nRandom Spanker Gang Member: Let's go spank somewhere else!\n\nDaphne: Oh, Freddie, this is such a romantic setting for our second date.\n\nFred: If you say so. All I know is, since my dad owns the place, we get free refills.\n\nSheriff Stone: Hold it right there, leather-wearing creepy. First section seven forty-one dot B of the Chrystal Cove bylaws; there are no monsters or monster-like creatures allowed in public areas.\n\nMayor Jones: Unless tickets are being sold.\n\nDaphne: Wow, that was very... poetical.\n\nMember of The Wild Brood: Velma, do you believe in love at first sight?\n\nVelma: In your case... no.\n\nDaphne: Did you break into the armory and steal a rocket launcher?\n\nOrc: No.\n\nDaphne: (to Fred) See, I told you, let's go.\n\nOrc: My gratitude is yours, fair Daph.\n\nFred: Fair Daph?! Listen here, Tusky, only I get to call her Daph, and I never say fair!\n\nOrc: Crazy driving there, Frederick.\n\nFred: Thanks. And it's Fred. Unless we're dating, and then it's Freddie.\n\nDaphne: Okay. Let's see who was trying to give the Wild Brood a bad name.\n\n(The Orc unmasks the Impostor Orc)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred: Another geek?\n\nThe Orcs: Maxwell?\n\nShaggy: Like, who's Maxwell?\n\nOdnarb: He works in the copy room at our gaming company. Maxwell, why?\n\nMaxwell: Why? I'll tell you why. You all thought you were so cool. You never let me join in the beta testing of any of your new video games. No, I was just the lowly copy boy. So I sought my revenge. I made a Wild Brood costume of my own. From that point on, all I had to do was steal a rocket launcher, grab someone to hack the computer to divert the train, reroute said train, board the train from a moving motorcycle, defeat the train's security system, blow up the bridge the train was on, which would cause the Swordfish console to be destroyed in a massive train wreck, ruining your careers and hopefully giving rise to my own in the process. Simple!\n\nShaggy: Dude. Seriously?\n\nMaxwell: Overkill, huh? Well, it might have worked, if it wasn't for you meddling kids. Am I right?\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred: Uh, no.\n\nVelma: Don't think so.\n\nShaggy: Not really.\n\n(Maxwell feels sorry)\n\nSheriff Stone: (puts the Orc mask on Maxwell's face) And keep that mask on. You geeks freak me out without them. (drives away with Maxwell arrested)\n\nVelma: Don't be so hard on yourself. You tried to do a very brave thing.\n\nFred: No, Odnarb was the brave one. He saved us all. Go ahead. Hang with him, Daph.\n\nOdnarb: We've got to get back to our render farm. But I was thinking... maybe one last ride? I'll let you hold onto my jacket. It's genuine elf thigh.\n\nDaphne: Oh. No thanks, Od. You're awesome with all your deep thoughts and poetical nobility and stuff. But my heart has always been with Freddie. (kisses Fred on the cheek)\n\nFred: Yes! In your face, Odnarb, or whoever you are. She digs me. She digs me! SHE DIGS ME!\n\nWhere Aphrodite Walks\n\n[edit]\n\nSoccer Player: Fred missed another match. What he'd get, trapped?\n\nAphrodite: Run down that mangy mongrel! Run him down with the love! Now!\n\nProfessor Pericles: The antidote to stop Aphrodite has several distinct components: Pewter, found in grout used only in stained glass windows of the eighteenth century. Ectoplasm, or as it's more commonly known, ghost mucus. And finally, rose quartz, mined in the caves beneath Crystal Cove.\n\nMayor Jones: Silver plated seesaws, Fred, you're not in the love anymore? Then, I'm going to have to let out an unearthly howl and destroy you.\n\nVelma: Look, about what happened -\n\nShaggy: Yeah, uh, about that...\n\nVelma: We don't have to -\n\nShaggy: No, no way.\n\nVelma: In fact, I'd prefer -\n\nShaggy: Absolutely. My thoughts exactly.\n\nDaphne: We've got a great look for everyone!\n\nShaggy: Does mine involve wearing a skirt and lipstick?\n\nDaphne: No...\n\nShaggy: Awesome!\n\nDaphne:: But Scooby's does!\n\nScooby: Not fair!\n\nAphrodite: I am the goddess of love! Bow at the feet of Aphrodite!\n\nVelma: I think you mean Amanda. (unmasks Aphrodite) Amanda Smythe?\n\nAmanda Smythe: Oh, you think you're so smart. Do you know how it feels to be humiliated? Me, the smartest and most gifted student in the history of Crystal Cove, laughed at by everyone in this school.\n\nVelma: Well, actually...\n\nAmanda Smythe: You know nothing! They had promised me I would be prom queen, but instead they pulled a hideous mask over my face: The face of a monster. They ridiculed me. I left Crystal Cove that night, but I promised that someday I would return. I had always been good at chemistry, so when I stumbled on the formula for an artificial pheromone that could make people lose their minds with love, I knew I would have my revenge.\n\nDaphne: Why? You're pretty now.\n\nAmanda Smythe: The scars run deep. I would reclaim the crown that was rightly mine, then I would destroy this town the way it destroyed me. My plan was genius! And I would have succeeded, too, if it wasn't for your olfactory-challenged sidekicks. (The deputies arrest Amanda)\n\nPericles: I am no one's sidekick.\n\nScooby: You said it.\n\nShaggy: Well, Scooby Doo, like, you saved the day.\n\nScooby: And Pericles, too.\n\nDaphne: I guess even a diabolical and criminal bird can change his evil in malevolent ways.\n\nEd: (appears) Highly doubtful.\n\nShaggy and Scooby: (nervously) Who--who are you?\n\nEd: I am an associate of Mr. E. Pericles left him a message that you should hear. (plays the recorded tape)\n\nPericles: It was I who gave Aphrodite the secret formula. Once that was accomplished, I could go after the real ingredients I needed to find. First, an ancient conquistador's ship manifest. Next, a stone piercing industrial-grade diamond drill bit. And finally, the geological reports from the Darrow Mining Company. Your move, Mr. E. (The tape ends)\n\nShaggy: Okay, can I get a teeny little time-out here? What does any of that stuff have to do with anything?\n\nEd: The curse of the haunted treasure, an ancient fortune left behind by the conquistadors that first settled this area. Legend has it that it is buried somewhere deep beneath us, and it now appears that Pericles is on the verge of discovering it. (Everyone gasp) And if he does, it could well mean the end of Crystal Cove. (walks away)\n\nEscape from Mystery Manor\n\n[edit]\n\nFred: Way to go, gang. Who's been served now, huh?\n\nDanny: I won't deny it, you are a worthy opponent.\n\nFred: Gee, thanks. You're not bad yourself.\n\nDanny: Was that a gage burrow strategy you used back there?\n\nFred: You recognized it? You know, I thought at first I'd go with the Orpheus proposition, but I didn't have any milk.\n\nVelma: (interrupts Fred) Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt, but what's the big idea trying to kill us? And what's with this thing?\n\nDanny: My treasure! I thought you had returned to steal it.\n\nDaphne: Returned? I think you have us confused with the original Mystery Inc.\n\nDanny: Say, now that you mention it, you don't look anything like I remember you. Especially that parrot over there.\n\nScooby: Thank you.\n\nDanny: I've made a terrible, terrible mistake. What has become of me? I suppose it started that Halloween night. My family came upon a mysterious artifact, a key to finding the great cursed treasure rumored to lie beneath Crystal Cove. It corrupted us with greed. I had just gotten my hands on it when the earth shook and swallowed our entire house. My loved ones grew old and passed all around me, but I hardly even noticed. Then, those meddling kids showed up. They were after my treasure. I knew it! So I spied on them. And I booby-trapped the whole house in ways that would prey upon their weaknesses. Eh, but they left.\n\nDaphne: So you've been waiting for them to come back all this time?\n\nDanny: Truth be told, I kind of lost track. Has it really been that long? How do I look? Haven't let myself go, have I?\n\nFred: Uh, no.\n\nScooby: You look fine.\n\nDaphne: I love what you've done with your hair.\n\nDanny: My whole life has been a waste. (sits in the chair, dodges the booby-trap arrow launched by crossbow and laughs) That's one of my earlier models.\n\n(The Mansion begins rumbling and collapsing)\n\nShaggy: What's going on?\n\nDanny: All those traps going off must have awaken the area's fault line. (falls on the floor broken in half)\n\nFred: Quick, grab my hand!\n\nDanny: Don't worry about me! (The gang watches the ceiling breaking outside) Now's your chance for escape.\n\nVelma: But your treasure?\n\nDanny: (last words) Keep it! And may it bring you more happiness than it ever brought me. (The ceiling is still breaking, the light shines outside) Now, through that crevice before it's too late!\n\n(The gang escapes the Mansion collapsed leaving Danny Darrow alone)\n\nDaphne: After all that, he saved us.\n\nVelma: Or did we save him?\n\nShaggy: Yeah. Like, he did say this wedge was...\n\nScooby: Cursed.\n\nFred: Whatever it is, it's our responsibility now. The question is, are there other pieces out there? And if there are, who else is looking for them?\n\n(Mayor Jones watches the gang from the car window and drives away)\n\nThe Dragon's Secret\n\n[edit]\n\nFred: Ta-da! The Brownberger B-41. It's the trapper's trap.\n\nMayor Jones: (arrives) Spicy giblet ponies, Fred! Why do you have a geisha tied up in here? You know they belong downtown in Crystal Cove's geisha house of terror.\n\nFred: He's not a geisha, dad. He's a wizard. Or at least that's who he's pretending to be...\n\n(Velma unmasks White Wizard)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred: Mr. Wang?\n\nScooby: Big surprise.\n\nMayor Jones: What?! Wang?! Why?!\n\nMr. Wang: I've searched for the dragon's heart all my life. I tracked it to your silly little town, and it was almost mine. Mine!\n\nMai Le: You won't be needing these anymore. (takes the 4 rings off of Mr. Wang)\n\nDaphne: Now it all makes sense. Mr. Wang used his supposed research trip to Crystal Cove as an excuse to hunt for the dragon's heart. When he saw that Mai Le was wearing the fourth dragon ring, he knew he was close. Mr. Wang posed as the evil White Kung Fu Wizard to steal the fourth dragon ring from Mai Le, but Chen pretended to be a Red Wizard in an effort to stop him.\n\nVelma: After the wizard battle downtown, Mr. Wang came to my house in one last effort to get the ring.\n\nShaggy: But how did he make himself fly?\n\nChen: Oh, the same way I did, (takes the White Wizard costume off of Mr. Wang) jetpack.\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma and Fred: Oh! Of course.\n\nDaphne: And the magic lightning bolts?\n\nVelma: (shows Mr. Wang's hand) Homemade Tesla coils. Genius!\n\nMr. Wang: It was the perfect plan. That ruby is priceless. I was going to be rich! And I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you--\n\nFred: (masks Mr. Wang with the White Wizard's head) Save it, Wang. We've heard it all before.\n\n(Scooby laughs)\n\n(Inside the ship, Mai Le keeps the ruby in secret)\n\nMai Le: Finally mine. So long, Mystery Incorporated.\n\n(The ship turns hard left, Mai Le accidentally drops the ruby, Shaggy arrives and catches it)\n\nShaggy: Hello, dude. Or should I say... Mai Le? I went to the airport to see you off, but you weren't on the plane. It was always about the ruby, wasn't it? You just used us to get Wang out of the way so that you could get the other rings.\n\nMai Le: That's right. While you and your idiot friends were explaining Wang's plan, I opened the jade dragon and took the ruby. The dragon's heart belongs to me!\n\nShaggy: Fine. Come and get it. (Mai Le destroys table with her strong fist) Zoinks!\n\nMai Le: (in a Fred's trap) Let me down, you idiots!\n\nScooby: You okay, Shaggy?\n\nShaggy: Was everything about you a lie? Like, even us?\n\nMai Le: Sorry, dude.\n\nVelma: He's too good for you, dog issues or no dog issues.\n\nMai Le: I still don't know what that means.\n\nNightfright\n\n[edit]\n\n(Daphne unmasks Nightfright)\n\nDaphne, Velma and Fred: The production assistant?\n\nVincent van Ghoul: No, it's not. It's Argus Fentonpoof, the writer of \"Scream, Scream, Time For You to Die\".\n\nArgus: I'm both. When you pulled out of the movie, they decided not to make it. I went bankrupt. I had to take a job as a production assistant.\n\nVincent van Ghoul: But, why have you done this?\n\nArgus: Well, by scaring you and everyone watching on TV, I was going to prove that Nightfright deserved his own horror movie. Right before you started filming, I hid my Nightfright costume in a closet. I used the conduit to sneak in and put the costume on. I paid the other actors to pretend to be knocked out when I attacked. Of course, I couldn't let anyone know that I was Nightfright. I had to sneak out every now and then, and get everyone coffee.\n\nHarry: (arrives) Hold it right there. I'm Harry Shneste-Boysen, the executive producer of this show. I've been watching the whole thing from my jacuzzi. I'm blown away. (to Vincent van Ghoul) Not only is your reality show going to be a surefire hit, (to Argus) (2 deputies handcuff Argus) but I found your pathetic tale of lost dreams inspiring. It's gonna make a great movie.\n\nArgus: A movie, about me? Really? Heh. Gee! Uh, you know, none of this would have happened without you meddling kids. Thanks.\n\nSheriff: All right, let's go.\n\nArgus: Bye, everyone! See you on the big screen in 10 to 20 years.\n\nVincent van Ghoul: Well, all's well that ends well.\n\nThe Siren's Song\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Spike: I would like to see who's been holding me captive all this time. (unmasks the one Fish Freak)\n\nDaphne: Ernesto?\n\nErnesto: Hello, comrade Daphne and her fellow comrade mystery-solving teenagers. (The other 3 Fish Freaks unmask themselves)\n\nDaphne: But aren't you against all this anti-environment stuff?\n\nErnesto: Funny you should ask. It all started when we were doing a little research into our old foe Destroido. We were going through their trash when we ran across some very interesting information: Dr. Cavanaugh's report on this giant oil deposit off Dead Man's Point. We came up with a plan to make enough money to fund our various protests. We were gonna drill for the oil ourselves and sell it.\n\nFred: You were doing this for cash?\n\nErnesto: You have no idea how expensive it is to be a grassroots activist! After we found the location of the oil platform, all we had to do was scare off anyone who started nosing into our business. And we would have, too, if that meddling mermaid had kept her fin to herself and never contacted you.\n\nVelma: Hold on. Are you telling us that you were going to cause a major environmental disaster in order to get the cash to protest against major environmental disasters?\n\nErnesto: Yes! You must be willing to kill the environment to save it.\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred: Uhh... no. I don't think that's right.\n\nVelma: Hey, you're not a mermaid!\n\nDr. Spike: Allow me to introduce my lovely wife Amy Cavanaugh, ordinary human and professional Commercial jingle singer.\n\nFred: That explains why your eerily beautiful singing voice made me want to put on deodorant!\n\n(Velma is disappointed)\n\nAmy: Velma...\n\nVelma: You lied to me. You acted like you were my friend, and I believed you.\n\nAmy: I'm sorry. I came up with the mermaid character out of desperation. I'd gone to the police to report that my husband had been kidnapped by Fish Freaks, but they just laughed at me, then asked for directions to the oil platform so they could add it as a stop to on the Crystal Cove Mystery Tour. I thought that if I could make it sound like one of your mysteries, you'd help me rescue my husband. And you did.\n\nVelma: How do you even know about us?\n\nAmy: I read your blog. I'm a fan.\n\nVelma: Does that mean you're going to stay in touch?\n\nAmy: If you'd like to me to.\n\nVelma: Well... whatever. It's your decision. But I wouldn't mind if you did. As far as helping, it's what we do. Our friend Angel also deserves a lot of credit. She knew about Destroido's involvement from some old newspaper articles. That's how we made the connection.\n\nAmy: Newspaper articles? That's strange. Destroido covered the whole thing up. The papers never even knew about it.\n\nVelma: Hmm.\n\n(In K-Ghoul, Angel Dynamite looks at the LP and Velma appears behind)\n\nAngel: Lordy, Velma! Baby, you just about scared me out of my skin-tight leather foxy pants. What's with all the sneaking around?\n\nVelma: You tell me.\n\nAngel: What's that supposed to mean?\n\nVelma: For the short amount of time that you've been in Crystal Cove, you sure know a lot about this town's mystery history.\n\nAngel: Well, I'm just curious by nature. Remember the heebedy-jeebedies?\n\nVelma: Stop. One of my big problems, on a list that's long and distinguished, is that despite my skeptical nature, I trust people. I want to see the best in them. Unfortunately, they usually let me down. Things have been adding up for me, Angel. The help you gave us on this oil platform mystery, the diary you provided for the Mystery Manor case; stuff that you shouldn't know and shouldn't have had, no matter what the heebedy-jeebedy.\n\nAngel: What are you saying?\n\nVelma: I'm saying Angel Dynamite isn't your real name. I think your real name is Cassidy Williams, and you're one of the members of the original Mystery Incorporated that vanished in the caves beneath Crystal Cove. Tell me I'm wrong... friend.\n\nMenace of the Manticore\n\n[edit]\n\n(Angel Dynamite enters the Mr. E's lair)\n\nAngel: The Mystery, Inc. kids have found a piece of the Planispheric Disk.\n\nMr. E: So now, we know where 2 of the pieces are. Good work, Angel.\n\nAngel: Just remember, I'm working with you, not for you, E. I'm worried about those kids.\n\nMr. E: Why?\n\nAngel: Pericles is loose, and that nutso parrot might go after the piece, which puts them in danger, and us, if the former members of our club get wind of it.\n\nMr. E: Don't worry, little Angel. The other 2 won't move a muscle as long as Fred Jones is still alive.\n\nDaphne: Look at that! Are Manticores double-jointed?\n\nVelma: This is no Manticore, Daphne. This is... (unmasks the Manticore)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne and Fred: Hot Dog Water?\n\nVelma: Just as I suspected. It totally makes sense when you put the clues together. Someone with computer skills had to make that fake website, and Hot Dog Water has those skills. And remember, just before the Manticore attacked, I smelled something familiar. It was briny, greasy hot dog water. (to Hot Dog Water) But what I don't know is why Shaggy and Scooby had such high voices after you attacked them before, or why you'd want this amusement park to close so badly.\n\nHot Dog Water: How could you know? Your intellect is so far inferior to mine. (takes off the Manticore's outfit) It all started on a boring Friday night when I didn't have a date.\n\nVelma: Hard to imagine.\n\nHot Dog Water: I decided to run some experiments on the steel used to build the park's rides. I found that if you melted the steel down and combined it with chromium, stalagmite, and mercury phosphate, it created a kind of super helium. Shaggy and Scooby must have inhaled some helium gas from the Manticore's posterior relief hole. That's why their voices were so high. I figured if I could get the park to close, I could take all the steel, melt it down, and sell the super helium to the Australian zeppelin fleet. I'd have made a fortune and shown you up in the process, Velma.\n\n(Sheriff arrests Hot Dog Water)\n\nDaphne: Another mystery solved.\n\nFred: It still seems like something's missing.\n\n(The Fortune Telling Machine prints the fortune)\n\nHot Dog Water: (reads) \"Meddling kids and their dog will foil your plan\".\n\nFred: Yep. That would be it.\n\n(Sheriff drives away)\n\nAngel: I know who has the Planispheric Disk piece, but not where.\n\nMr. E: Speak.\n\nAngel: I put a bug on Velma when I saw her earlier. She didn't suspect a thing. Later, I heard Fred tell her that Shaggy and Scooby have the piece. But he didn't say anything more than that.\n\nMr. E: He told Velma and us enough. Everything will work out just fine. You see, Scooby is a far more trusting companion than Pericles was to me.\n\nAttack of the Headless Horror\n\n[edit]\n\n(Sheriff Stone arrives with Cachinga in the police car)\n\nSheriff Stone: What in the name of kettle corn is going on? I thought you said he (Cachinga) was the creature.\n\nDaphne: Sorry we had to trick you, Sheriff, but we needed everyone to believe it was Cachinga (Fred deactivates the trap) so we could set a trap for the person who's really behind this.\n\n(Fred unmasks the Headless Horror)\n\nHeadless Horror/Marion: (gasps)\n\nRick Spartan: Marion!\n\nSheriff Stone: But how did you know that she'd attack? I don't get that!\n\nFred: We knew that if Dr. Spartan found out that the curse was fake he'd want to go back to living a life of adventure in the jungle.\n\nVelma: A life she definitely didn't want.\n\nMarion: (annoyed) Fine. I admit it.\n\nSheriff Stone: Well, you kind of have to. We caught you in the costume. But how--how did you know it was her?\n\nFred: We found this ring at the botanical gardens. A woman's ring. (to Marion) You went to Oxford, too, didn't you?\n\nMarion: Yes. (puts the ring on her finger)\n\nRick Spartan: But, Marion, why did you do it?\n\nMarion: Because I love you! Because I hate living in the jungle. It's icky. I decided if I couldn't convince you to give up that life, I'd scare you out of it. I came up with the fake legend of Sklar Gringat. I forged an ancient map to the ruins and put it someplace you'd find it. I knew you wouldn't be able to resist the challenge. You would be so consumed with finding your next great treasure, you wouldn't be thinking of me, as usual. I pretended to break my ankle because I knew you'd send Cachinga for help and go up into the ruins by yourself. And when you did, my plan fell into place. It gave me a chance to sneak around the back of the ruins, which were actually an old abandoned movie set. The Headless Horror costume was the final piece of the puzzle. I had it specially designed and took months of pilates to train my abdominal muscles to the point where I could control the mouth with my abs.\n\nRick Spartan: But the shrunken head... It talked to me.\n\nMarion: I got it at a Halloween store. You can record whatever you want it to say. I'm sorry, darling. I never meant to hurt you. I just wanted us to live a normal life. Which we could have if it weren't for those meddling sycophants. Can you ever forgive me?\n\nRick Spartan: Sure, I do, baby. I know I'm not the easiest guy to live with. You were just trying to get through to me. Don't worry, we'll work it out. (He and Marion kiss) Sheriff, I don't want to press any charges.\n\nSheriff Stone: Yeah, I, uh, figured.\n\nRick Spartan: Take me back to my room?\n\nMarion: Anything.\n\nRick Spartan: Cachinga, come.\n\nCachinga: (leaves the police car with the spear) Thank you. It's been lovely.\n\nA Haunting in Crystal Cove\n\n[edit]\n\nShadowy Figure: Oof. Eahhh! Wood gets older than kindle!\n\nScooby: Nice to see you again... (unmasks the Shadowy Figure)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred: Professor Pericles.\n\nPericles: Well, hello, children. How did you know?\n\nVelma: Simple. There's only one brain large enough, beside my own, that could have pulled this off. We found the trojan horse program you put on Fred's laptop that let you control all of Fred's traps remotely.\n\nPericles: Fred really should have come up with a more secure password than \"trappin' guy\".\n\nShaggy: Once you had control of the traps, it was like totally simple to simulate a haunting and terrify the Mayor.\n\nVelma: And your avian attributes provided the means to make your spooky shadow creep float like a real ghost.\n\nDaphne: Too bad for you your avian diet gave you away.\n\nPericles: Oh, what can I say? A bird's got to eat.\n\nFred: It still doesn't explain where my dad is, and why you were haunting him.\n\nPericles: Why do you think? I wanted his piece of the Planispheric Disk, of course. I knew he would have it close. I just didn't know where. So I decided to scare it out of him.\n\nFred: (looks at the mysterious piece) Planispheric Disk? (to Pericles) But how did you know he had it in the first place?\n\nPericles: Because, dear friend, he stole it from me a long time ago. (the gang is confused) Don't believe me? Ask him yourself. (takes off the Shadowy Figure costume and pushes the remote control's button that changes the stairs to slide, Fred unhands the piece of the Planispheric Disk and the gang falls down to the basement) (takes the piece #1 of the Planispheric Disk) I am the smartest criminal parrot in the world! You didn't think I have a back-up plan? (laughs) Until we meet again. Auf wiedersehen, Mystery Incorporated. (flies away)\n\nScooby: Did you know we were standing on a trap?\n\nFred: (grabs Daphne) Honestly, there's so many in this house, I've kinda lost track.\n\n(The gang hears a man trapped in a sheet)\n\nShaggy: Zoinks! Another ghost!\n\nFred: Dad! (releases Daphne and uncovers the sheet) You're okay!\n\nMayor Jones: Dimpled puppet eggs, Fred! I am clearly not okay. Untie me.\n\nFred: (unties his dad) Dad, the house wasn't haunted at all. It was Professor Pericles.\n\nMayor Jones: Pericles? Are you sure? Did he get the--?\n\nDaphne: Planispheric Disk? Yeah. He said you stole it from him.\n\nMayor Jones: That's... that's absurd! We confiscated it off him years ago, when we locked him up. I've felt it was best to keep it here, safe. That's why I went back in for it.\n\nVelma: Mayor Jones, why would Professor Pericles want that piece of the Disk so badly?\n\nMayor Jones: Oof! Ha! Ha! How should I know? Are you kids trying to imply something? Because if you are--\n\nFred: No, no, dad. We're just all really happy you're okay. That's what's important, right, gang? This mystery is over. (hugs Mayor Jones)\n\nDaphne: I'm not sure this mystery is over at all.\n\nDead Justice\n\n[edit]\n\nVelma: Time to reveal who Dead Justice really is. (unmasks Dead Justice)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred: Deputy Bucky?\n\nSheriff Stone: What? Bucky, you were like a father to me!\n\nBucky: You're 20 years older than me!\n\nSheriff Stone: There's no proof of that. Why'd you do it?\n\nVelma: Sheriff, I think we can explain.\n\nDaphne: Bucky was tired of being just a deputy. He craved the power and prestige of the Sheriff's office.\n\nFred: Bucky failed every one of his promotion exams. But it wasn't just his grades that got me thinking.\n\nShaggy: Like, Bucky's a doodler, and his drawings looked an awful lot like Dead Justice's demon bullets.\n\nVelma: Bucky disguised himself as the Ghost of Dead Justice and chased down the town's most wanted.\n\nDaphne: He knew nothing would hurt Sheriff Stone more than losing his job to his hero.\n\nFred: The only thing I don't understand is how he created those bullets.\n\nBucky: CGI. It's all CGI these days. I programmed a laser pointer to simulate the animation.\n\nSheriff Stone: Much as I hate to admit it, I owe you kids one. (Fred puts his hand on Sheriff's shoulder but he lets it go)\n\nMayor Jones: (gives an award to Sheriff Stone) People of Crystal Cove, there's a new old new Sheriff in town.\n\n(The crowd cheers and applauds)\n\nSheriff Stone: Thanks, Mayor Jones. And... Thanks for giving me a raise.\n\nMayor Jones: Raise? What raise? An hour ago, your job was free. Don't think I won't find another undead lawman if I have to.\n\nSheriff Stone: (laughs) You're joking, right?\n\nFred: You know, dad, Bucky would have gotten away with it if it hadn't have been for us meddling kids. Maybe a little thank you might be, uh...\n\nMayor Jones: Uh, that's great, Fred. Listen, I'm late for a work meeting. (leaves)\n\nFred: But work's that way. (Daphne arrives) Why do I even bother?\n\nDaphne: (accompanies Fred) He cares, Fred, in his own way.\n\nPawn of Shadows\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessor Hatecraft: Now, Regina, time to come clean and reveal that you're-- (unmasks The Obliteratrix)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred: Alice May?\n\nProfessor Hatecraft: Who's Alice May?\n\nDaphne: She once pretended to be a Ghost Girl to kidnap Fred for her man posse because she wanted revenge for her father, the Creeper.\n\nShaggy: But, like, how did you get out of jail?\n\nAlice May: I got out with the help of the same person who sent me to destroy you... Mr. E!\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred: Huh?\n\nAngel Dynamite: Huh?\n\nAlice May: E enlisted my services to put you kids in danger in hopes of drawing out his enemy, Professor Pericles. He figured if Pericles thought you were in trouble, he'd come to your rescue. E knew if he could get Pericles to reveal himself, it'd leave his piece of the Planispheric Disk vulnerable. Everything was fake. Special effects.\n\nShaggy: But, like, where'd you get all the high-tech stuff? How'd you disappear?\n\nAlice May: E took care of that. It was all courtesy of one of Destroido's shell corporations: Quest Research Laboratories. They supplied me with everything I needed: Weapons, a high-tech cloaking device, even the effects.\n\nAngel Dynamite: (handcuffs Alice) So this was all staged by Mr. E to use the kids as parrot bait.\n\nAlice May: That's right. And it would have worked, too, if I hadn't been stopped by you, Miss meddling sassy pants!\n\n(Next scene in the police car with Sheriff Stone and Alice May arrested)\n\nSheriff Stone: Wait, so are you telling me that you escaped from prison months ago, and I never noticed? (laughs) I don't think so. (drives away)\n\nFred: Well, gang, another mystery solved.\n\nDaphne: I just wish we could have done something about your job, Professor Hatecraft.\n\nDean: (arrives with car) H.P.? Yoo-hoo! Oh, there you are, you dear man.\n\nProfessor Hatecraft: Don't worry, Dean Fenk. I'm on my way to clean out my office now.\n\nDean: Clean out your office? Oh, never. Heh! Haven't you heard the wonderful news? The song \"Char Gar Gothakon\", based on your novel, is a huge hit in Japan. And since Darrow College published the book, we're gonna make a fortune! (Professor Hatecraft is amazingly surprised) Now, I'm giving you Regina's old office Vampire books are so done and I'm having the dusk mobile repainted. (she and Professor Hatecraft drive away)\n\nFred: Well, Angel, it looks like we owe you one.\n\nScooby: Yeah. You saved our tails.\n\nDaphne: How'd you know where we were?\n\nVelma: It's time, Angel. I can't keep this secret anymore.\n\nAngel Dynamite: I wanted to tell you kids earlier, but I was afraid.\n\nScooby: Afraid of what?\n\nAngel Dynamite: Of telling you the truth. My real name isn't Angel Dynamite. It's Cassidy Williams. I'm one of the original members of Mystery Incorporated that disappeared.\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne and Fred: What?\n\nAngel Dynamite/Cassidy: It was all an accident. We should have never been in that condemned church. But Brad said he'd seen someone coming and going at night, and he wanted to investigate. We thought we'd found a treasure map, but it wasn't treasure; it was a threat, to not just our lives but the lives of our families. The thing in those caves forced us to leave Crystal Cove, or those who loved us would pay the price.\n\n(Shaggy and Scooby are terrified)\n\nShaggy: L-l-like, who threatened you?\n\nAngel Dynamite/Cassidy: He called himself the Freak. The Freak of Crystal Cove. There, now you know the truth. That's what happened to the original Mystery Incorporated, and it will happen to all of you if you don't stop! Forget about the Planispheric Disk. Give Pericles your piece, or Mr. E. I don't care. The mystery is over. Let it end tonight!\n\nFred: You lied to us, Angel. You've been lying to us from the beginning. Why should we listen to anything you have to say to us now? This mystery isn't over until we say it's over. Come on, gang.\n\nAngel Dynamite/Cassidy: No. No, you don't understand. He's still out there. (The gang drives away) The Freak is still out there!\n\nThe Freak: The curse begun, but soon they'll see, the buried truth will end with me. (laughs)\n\nAll Fear the Freak\n\n[edit]\n\nPericles: Hello, Ed Machine.\n\nEd: What are you doing here?\n\nPericles: I'd like you to deliver a message to Ricky. Or should I call him Mr. E?\n\nEd: (last words) Say what you want to say Pericles, then get out of my house.\n\nPericles: (chuckles) Dear Ed, you misunderstand. I don't want to say anything. (attacks Ed Machine in the dark)\n\n(The gang arrives at an old ruined church)\n\nFred: This is where the mystery started, gang. And tonight, this is where it ends.\n\nNan: [gasps] [Barty: Unh!] [Points Mayor Jones and grabs Daphne and takes Daphne home] This is your fault, Mystery Incorporated is over.\n\nDaphne: Fred!\n\nFred: Daphne!\n\nDaphne: Freddie! Freddie!\n\nFred: NO! [Daphne yelps] Shaggy, Scooby, guard in the piece in your room. Velma.\n\nVelma: I'm already on it.\n\nSheriff Stone: Freeze freako.\n\nDaphne: Fred, you're alright.\n\nSheriff Stone: What have you kids done now? First I get a hysterical call from the Rogers saying Scooby and Shaggy jumped out the window during still life night. And then the other parents start phoning, saying that their kids have disappeared. And then Angel calls me all frantic about-- Who is this guy?\n\nFred: I'll tell you who he is, Sheriff. The Freak of Crystal Cove... (unmasks the Freak) is my father. Who is it?\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Daphne and Velma: Mayor Jones?\n\nSheriff Stone: (gasps) But...?\n\nMayor Jones: How did you know?\n\nFred: When I found out both pictures of my mother were just cut-outs from a magazine, I checked the dates on the back. It was the same day I was born, or what you said was the same day I was born. Still, I wasn't sure. Not until now. Why?\n\nMayor Jones: Why do you think? Because of the curse. For years I'd heard about the curse and the supposed haunted treasure. That was the reason I came to Crystal Cove. I'd been accepted to Darrow University's history department, which gave me access to the town archives. When I found the story about the conquistadors that disappeared, I decided to disguise myself and begin my search for the Planispheric Disk. Sadly, I found nothing. Until Mystery Incorporated walked into the library seeking advice. They had no idea what they'd found. Well, that wasn't true. Actually, their mascot knew. For access to my knowledge, Pericles was willing to betray his friends. We concocted a scheme to blackmail the kids into leaving town by threatening them with fabricated documents implicating their parents in various crimes. They were unaware of my true identity, but I still had one loose end. Pericles had to go. I placed an anonymous call to the police implicating him in the kids' disappearance. By the time, Pericles woke, he was already in custody. He was sentenced to spend the rest of his miserable parrot life where he belonged... in a cage. Becoming mayor allowed me to continue my search for the remaining pieces. And I would have found them, too, if it weren't for you, my meddling-- Fred.\n\nFred: That still doesn't explain what happened to my mother.\n\nMayor Jones: The truth is, I don't know. I assume she's still with Brad Chiles.\n\nDaphne: Wait, are you saying that Judy Reeves is Fred's mother? But that would mean...\n\nMayor Jones: Brad Chiles is your real father. (Fred is shocked) Two years after they left, Brad tried to return to Crystal Cove. By that time, he and Judy had married and she'd given birth to a baby boy. I had to stop Brad. I took you and told him you'd be safe, as long as they never returned again.\n\nFred: All this for a treasure no one's even sure exists? Where's the piece?\n\nMayor Jones: Fred, you're still my son. I raised you.\n\nFred: (grabs the Mayor Jones) You used me. Where'd you hide it? In your pocket? (tries to search the piece in his pocket but it's empty)\n\nMayor Jones: It's gone? We have to find it. That piece is priceless. Fred! (Fred puts Mayor Jones down) Uhh. FRED!? (Fred runs away and Daphne follows him)\n\nSheriff Stone: (sobs) Tell me this isn't true.\n\nDaphne: Fred, I'm sorry. You'll get through this.\n\nFred: My whole life has been a lie, Daphne. I have parents I've never known.\n\nDaphne: We'll find them. Together.\n\nFred: No. I need to do this on my own. I'm sorry, Daphne, the engagement is off. I'm leaving Crystal Cove, and I'm leavin' tonight and do nothing. Dean Fenk is never seen it fired at Mr. Hatecraft again.\n\nDaphne: But what about us? Mystery Incorporated?\n\nFred: Mystery Incorporated is dead. (walks away)\n\nMayor Jones: Freddie?!\n\nDaphne: Shaggy, Scooby, do something.\n\nShaggy: Freddie? (his parents stop him and Scooby) Oh, mom, dad. Like, what gives?\n\nPaula Rogers: Norville, your father and I have given this a lot of thought, and we feel it best you go away for a while.\n\nShaggy: What? Go away?! Like, where?\n\nColton Rogers: Farmsdale Military Academy.\n\nPaula Rogers: And don't worry about Scooby. We found him a nice farm to live on.\n\nScooby: (shocked) Farm?!\n\nShaggy: Huh?!\n\nVelma: (Daphne sobs) It'll be okay, Daph. Fred will come back.\n\nDaphne: (cries) Didn't you hear him? Mystery Incorporated is dead. If you had just told us about Angel sooner, this never would have happened. (walks away)\n\n(Velma's parents take her in the car)\n\nShaggy: Well, like, dudes, I can't go to military school. I'm an eater, not a fighter.\n\nPericles: What an amusing turn of events.\n\nScooby: (yelps) Pericles!\n\nPericles: Don't be afraid, Scooby. I've no reason to hurt you. (holds up piece) I have what I came for. (chuckles)\n\nScooby: The mayor's piece! You have it!\n\nPericles: Two down, four to go. (opens car window) Until we meet again, auf wiedersehn, Scooby-Doo. (laughs and flies away)\n\nScooby: I'll get the gang back together, Pericles. We'll be coming for you, or my name isn't Scooby-Dooby-Doo!\n\nSeason 2\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Night the Clown Cried\n\n[edit]\n\nCrybaby Clown: You all know me. You know how I earn a living. I'm a bad clown. Stopping me ain't going to be easy. There's no string and a net to catching me like Mano Tiki Tia or Redbeard's ghost. This Crybaby Clown swallow your town whole. (chuckles) You want your tourism back? You're gonna pay me $5 million. For that, you get the pacifier, the rattle, the whole darn clown. So what's it going to be? Me, or Mystery Incorporated?\n\nSheriff Stone: Well, it sounds like a good deal to me. I'll start passing the hat. So long, mystery goofs.\n\nScooby: Hold on, Clown! That is our town.\n\nShaggy: (chuckles nervously) That's right! And we don't need money to protect it. Although it would be nice-- (Velma hits him with elbow) Ow!\n\nVelma: Freddie, I think it's trapping time.\n\nFred: Right, Velma! And I know the perfect g-- the perfect-- ah-- I-- guh!\n\nMayor Nettles: What's wrong?\n\nFred: I-- my trapping knowledge! It's gone! My mind is-- is empty!\n\nCrybaby Clown: Wahh wahh. So tragic. Oh, well, I offered. (The door closes abruptly and the lights are shut off) Time's up, Crystal Cove.\n\nCrybaby Clown: Aww, this makes me think you don't like me. Wahh wahh! And by the way, building your little donut shop trap next to a fireworks store might not have been the best idea. See ya soon, Mystery Incorporated! (throws the baby bottle bomb in the fireworks store to explode. Crybaby Clown drives away)\n\nVelma: Run!\n\nFred: Daphne!\n\nVelma: Isn't coming!\n\nVelma: Well, I think it's safe to say, if the town didn't hate us before. This should certainly do the trick.\n\n(Fred feels disappointed)\n\nScooby: Freddie? Are you okay?\n\nFred: No, Scoob, I'm not. My trap failed, and for the first time, the bad guy got away. And it's my fault.\n\nShaggy: We're all responsible, Fred. We're a team, remember?\n\nFred: That's just it, Shaggy. We're not a team. Not without Daphne. And now I know... she's never coming back.\n\nThe House of the Nightmare Witch\n\n[edit]\n\n(Sheriff Stone handcuffs Baba Yaga)\n\nFred: And now, let's see who Baba Yaga really is. (unmasks Baba Yaga)\n\nEveryone: Curator Vronsky?\n\nVelma: Exactly. He was using Baba Yaga's house to smuggle stolen Fabergé eggs into the country.\n\nCurator Vronsky: That's right. I was going to sell them on the black market. Finally, I was to be a rich capitalist with all my loot. I had it planned perfectly. Before becoming a museum curator, I spent many years in Spetsnaz, Soviet Special Forces. This allowed me to make modifications on the house using what I could find on the ship. I even put a remote control in my walking stick to move the house. I needed to get assistant curator Anna Arkadyevna out of the way before she became suspicious of my plan. I tied her up and kept her prisoner in the house while I donned the Baba Yaga costume and used the voice modulator to frighten away the curious. But, when one of the eggs was damaged, I had to alter the plan. But you brats kept interrupting my repair of the legs. I could not leave any of my precious eggs behind. There were too many. I needed the house to carry them all. And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you decadent bourgeoisie teenagers and your slobbering, democracy-loving dog!\n\nAnna: I had my suspicions of Vronsky all along. That is why I came with him. Thank you for saving the Fabergé eggs, our national treasure.\n\nThe Night the Clown Cried II: Tears of Doom!\n\n[edit]\n\nFred: And now let's see who Crybaby Clown really is. (unmasks the Crybaby Clown)\n\nScooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne, Hot Dog Water and Fred: Baylor Hotner!\n\nBaylor Hotner: That's right-ner. Actor, humanitarian, guy with amazingly super awesome abs. I came here to Crystal Cove to research the part of a crazed clown for my upcoming blockbuster movie, \"The Night the Clown Cried\". It was gonna be my Oscar. Using my knowledge of Hollywood makeup and effects and a trick buggy I stole from the back lot, I honed my crazed clown performance to perfection. Then, I built my entourage: a therapist, a hairdresser, a plastic surgeon, and a publicist. Everything I needed to be a great actor. Of course, I put tracking chips in all of them because you have to know where your posse is at all times. I even had an innocent small-town girl that would make me look like the nicest guy. I had it all! And I would have been the world's greatest Hollywood thespian, too, if it hadn't have been for you small-town scene stealers.\n\nDaphne: (slaps Baylor) Small-town that, Baylor Hotner. These are my friends. Take him away, Sheriff.\n\n(Sheriff Stone arrests Baylor)\n\nDaphne: Thanks, guys. You, uh, really saved me.\n\nShaggy: Like, you're one of us.\n\nFred: Um, you know, Daphne, you could come back to me... to the gang, I mean.\n\nDaphne: Really? I'd like that. Very much.\n\nScooby: (hugs Daphne) Hooray! Daphne's back. Group hug. (Fred, Velma, and Shaggy hug Daphne) Scooby-Dooby-Doo! And Daphne, too. (laughs)\n\nWeb of the Dreamweaver!\n\n[edit]\n\nShaggy: Hey, gang, look at this. (shows the newspaper to the gang) Last night Horbert Feist, prominent banker, drove his car at high speed into the Crystal Cove bank.\n\nScooby: Why would he do that?\n\nDaphne: I don't know and I don't care, but a mystery is just the thing we need now to wipe away our skull-crushing guilt.\n\nFred: I'm in. Velma?\n\nVelma: (a bit sad) Sure, I could use a little soul cleansing right about now.\n\nSheriff Stone: (imprisones Horbert Feist) Horbert Feist, I must advise you not to say anything until your lawyer arrives. And don't say anything then, either!\n\n(The gang arrives)\n\nFred: Hi, Sheriff Stone.\n\nSheriff Stone: What are you kids doing here?\n\nDaphne: We've come to ask what you know about Mr. Feist.\n\nSheriff Stone: What? Look, who said I knew him? I've never seen him before in my life. (The gang is confused) All I know is he's a thief, and he belongs behind bars.\n\nShaggy: A thief? Papers didn't say anything about that. What'd he steal?\n\nSheriff Stone: Nothing I could find, but you don't need to steal something to be a thief.\n\nHorbert: Come on, Bronson. You've known me for years! We grew up together. You know I'd never steal anything.\n\nSheriff Stone: (singing and covering his ears) La la la, la la la, can't hear you, la la la la. (leaves)\n\nFred: Mr. Feist, can you tell us what happened last night?\n\nHorbert: Everything was normal. I was asleep, and then I had this terrible dream.\n\n(In the dream world, which is a labyrinth based on Escher's House of Stairs, Horbert runs in fear trying to escape from the Dreamweaver until he finds him carrying a glowing purple orb)\n\nDreamweaver: I've come for you, Horbert. (Horbert runs to the other side but the Dreamweaver appeared on the other side) Breath of frost. (uses the purple orb to attack Horbert making him paralyzed) (to Horbert's ear) Level 99.\n\nHorbert: And the next thing I knew, I was driving my car into the bank.\n\nShaggy: That's the weirdest dream I've ever heard, and I've had some pretty weird dreams.\n\nHorbert: I loved that car... more than my own children! And now it's gone. Gone! (sobs)\n\nVelma: Feist's alibi is pretty weak, and that dream... What does level 99 mean?\n\nShaggy: How would I know? Oh. (whimpers)\n\n(In the dream world, Francilee Jackson runs in fear trying to escape from the Dreamweaver until she finds him)\n\nDreamweaver: No one can escape, Francilee. (uses the purple orb to shine with lightning and the rope gets out of it) Ropes of binding!\n\nFrancilee: (runs to the other side) No! It can't be! You can't be back! (The rope catches Francilee) Please. Please. This can't be happening!\n\nDreamweaver: (to Francilee's ear) Twenty-sided dice.\n\n(The Dreamweaver laughs maniacally and Francilee screams in horror)\n\n(In Francilee's tv show \"The Francilee Show\", the audience is applauding)\n\nFrancilee: Now, no meal is complete without cornbread stuffing. And the best cornbread stuffing in the world is Francilee's Cornbread Stuffing! (the audience applauds again) Made from my little ol' super secret family recipe handed down through generations. And the super secret about Francilee's Cornbread Stuffing is there ain't even no corn in it! (The audience gasps) Oh, my goodness, why did I say that? (starts sleeping)\n\n(The screen is shut off by Sheriff Stone, revealing the tv screen in the next scene)\n\nSheriff Stone: Lying about there being corn in your cornbread stuffin'-- that's what we in the sheriffing world call fraud! I think.\n\nFrancilee: (in the prison cell) Oh, Bronson, how can you do this to little ol' me? We've known each other since we was chillun!\n\nSheriff Stone: What?! I've never seen your face before in my life!\n\nDaphne: But it's on the box in your hand.\n\nSheriff Stone: What box? (hides the box in his back) What hand? (The gang tries to look the box in Sheriff Stone's Back) I--I have to go now to destroy this very tasty evidence.\n\nScooby: Uh, we'll help!\n\nDaphne: Mrs. Jackson, tell us what happened.\n\nFrancilee: It's a mystery. Took me a nap this afternoon, and I had this frightful dream! When I woke up, I was on the TV, and everyone knew my recipe! I loved that secret stuffin' recipe more than my own chillun, and now it's ruined!? (sobs hardly)\n\nVelma: Did your dream by any chance involve a labyrinth, spells, a purple orb, and a mysterious inhuman mage?\n\nFrancilee: Yes, exactly!\n\nFred: Did the pointy-eared freakwad say anything?\n\nFrancilee: Yes, he said, \"twenty-sided dice\".\n\n(Shaggy whimpers and Sheriff Stone is a bit shocked)\n\nFrancilee: First Horbert, now me? I don't know who all's doing this, but I know who all will be next: Melvin Keisterbaum.\n\nDaphne: Melvin Keisterbaum?\n\n(Daphne drives the Mystery Machine)\n\nDaphne: Mr. Keisterbaum lives in the big house next-door to my parents. We have to warn him! (The gang arrives at Melvin's big house) We're here. (knocks the door) Mr. Keisterbaum? Hello? Guess he's not home.\n\n(The gang leaves the mansion, in a moment an explosion appears in it, the gang falls down to the ground)\n\nFred: (lifts Daphne) Daph? Unh.\n\nDaphne: Thanks, Fred.\n\nFred: No probs, Daph. It's what anyone who's just a friend would do for anyone else who's just a friend.\n\n(Daphne smiles and Velma finds a broken light bulb)\n\nVelma: Hmm. What's this? A broken light bulb? Never seen one like this before.\n\nMelvin: (arrives) My mansion! My beautiful mansion! I loved that mansion more than my own children... if I had any.\n\nDaphne: Mr. Keisterbaum, what happened?\n\nMelvin: Who knows? One moment I'm asleep on the couch, the next I'm standing in the garden with an empty canister of napalm.\n\nDaphne: Did you have any dreams?\n\nMelvin: Yes! I was in a labyrinth, and there were spells, a strange glowing orb, and a terrible monster! He was saying one word over and over: \"Dreamweaver. Dreamweaver!\"\n\nVelma: Level 99, 20-sided dice, Dreamweaver. What's the connection?\n\nShaggy: Like, what are you asking me for? Do I look like the kind of nerd that plays Crypts and Creatures?\n\nFred: Crypts and Creatures? Isn't that the nerdy fantasy role-playing game that nerdy nerds play?\n\nShaggy: Like, it--um--I... OK, fine. Like, yeah. I was a closet CNC player. I used to roll the dice every night.\n\n(Flashback starts, in Shaggy's bedroom)\n\nShaggy: (playing Crypts and Creatures with dice) Come on, saving throw. Shagdolf needs a new pair of +5 forks of feasting.\n\nPaula Rogers: (outside the room door, knocking on it) Norville? What are you doing in there? Norville?\n\nShaggy: Mom! Like, no, mom! No! Don't come in! Please don't come in!\n\n(Next, in the school with Emmanuel)\n\nShaggy: (narrates) Then, one day, I thought my science teacher was a bugbear, and I smote him with a magic missile.\n\nShaggy: I smite thee with magic missile! Magic missile! Magic missile! Magic missile! Magic missile!\n\n(Flashback ends)\n\nShaggy: Roll crit. Yes. Double damage! Ha ha ha ha! And that's when I knew I had to quit.\n\nScooby: (laughs) It's all right to be a nerd, Shagdolf. (laughs again)\n\n(Sheriff Stone arrives with police car)\n\nMelvin: Bronson, he's after us. You're next!\n\nSheriff Stone: (gasps) I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even know you. Who are you, strange little mustached man?\n\nMelvin: It's the Dreamweaver!\n\nSheriff Stone: (starts panicking) What? No. No, it's not possible. The Dreamweaver? THE DREAMWEAVER? Ohh. (to the gang) Kids. Kids, you gotta help me. If the Dreamweaver is back, I can never sleep again!?\n\n(In the flashback, the young Sheriff Stone, Francilee Jackson, Melvin Keisterbaum and Horbert Feist were playing Crypts and Creatures)\n\nYoung Bronson Stone: (to young Melvin) OK, you've defeated the goblin warriors and now stand in the lair of the diabolical Dreamweaver. (whispers) What do you do?\n\nYoung Melvin: I use night vision to check for traps.\n\nYoung Francilee: I drink a large potion of health.\n\nYoung Horbert: I cast detect magic... on my butt!\n\n(Young Melvin and Francilee laugh)\n\nYoung Bronson Stone: If you guys don't take this seriously, I'm gonna take my soda and my dice and go home!\n\nYoung Melvin, Francilee and Horbert: Sorry, Bronson.\n\nYoung Bronson Stone: (shows the Dreamweaver drawing) The Dreamweaver, lord of the sleep realm, with his mystical orb of power, stands before you... ready to cast you into the abyss.\n\n(Flashback ends)\n\nSheriff Stone: And now the Dreamweaver's come out of the game to finish what he started! AND I'M NEXT. (sobs)\n\nShaggy and Scooby: Whoa.\n\nVelma: But why would he go after you guys?\n\nSheriff Stone: Aren't you paying attention? It's because we stopped playing CNC. We turned our backs on imagination. Because we grew up!?\n\nShaggy: (whimpers) Like, let's never grow up, Scoob.\n\nScooby: Uh-uh, never.\n\nVelma: We'll go investigate what this light bulb thing is. Shaggy, Scooby, stay here and make sure the Sheriff doesn't fall asleep.\n\nShaggy and Scooby: Got it.\n\n(Fred, Daphne and Velma go to the Mystery Machine, Velma's cell phone rings, the call is from Mr. E)\n\nVelma: (answers the phone in secret) Mr. E.\n\nRicky: I thought you were the smart one, Velma, but you're making mistakes.\n\nVelma: I'm smart enough to trust my friends. Mystery Incorporated is a team. That's why I gave Fred the piece of Planispheric Disk.\n\n(Next scene in Destroido)\n\nRicky: A team without Hot Dog Water? That was wrong move number 2. Maybe I misjudged you, Velma.\n\n(Next scene on the outskirts of the Norville house)\n\nRicky: Maybe you don't want to save your friends. (Velma is annoyed) Maybe you don't want to save Crystal Cove. Maybe you-- (Velma hangs up her cell phone)\n\nFred: Who was that?\n\nVelma: Wrong number. (enters the Mystery Machine)\n\n(In the dream world, Scooby, Shaggy and Sheriff Stone appeared)\n\nScooby: Where are we?\n\nSheriff Stone: The lair of the Dreamweaver. It's exactly the way I designed it.\n\nShaggy: Next time, design something less scary.\n\nScooby: And put in a snack bar.\n\n(Sheriff Stone, Shaggy and Scooby walk)\n\nSheriff Stone: I remember the layout perfectly.\n\n(Shaggy whimpers)\n\n(Sheriff Stone, Shaggy and Scooby start running trying to find the exit)\n\nSheriff Stone: There's the exit.\n\n(The Dreamweaver arrives in front of Sheriff Stone, Shaggy and Scooby)\n\nDreamweaver: Welcome back, Bronson. Time to cast you into the abyss. (laughs)\n\nShaggy: Like, run!\n\n(Sheriff Stone, Shaggy and Scooby run to the other side)\n\nDreamweaver: (appears on the other side) Polymorph! (uses the orb to attack Shaggy and transform into a rabbit) (Sheriff Stone, Scooby and rabbit Shaggy run to the other side and the Dreamweaver appears) Flesh of stone! (uses the orb to attack Sheriff Stone and transform into a stone) (Scooby screams and runs to the other side trying to escape the Dreamweaver) Crashing tide! (uses the orb to raise the wave and crush Scooby)\n\nScooby: Uh-oh!\n\n(The dream world is interrupted as Sheriff Stone, Shaggy and Scooby woke up wet from bucket of water, thrown by Fred)\n\nFred: Way to go on keeping Sheriff Stone awake, guys.\n\nShaggy: We just met the Dreamweaver. He is one scary dude.\n\nVelma: Sheriff, do you have your Dreamweaver drawing with you?\n\nSheriff Stone: It's right here with my character sheets and dice. A CNC player is always ready to play.\n\nScooby: Hmm?\n\nShaggy: Wait a minute. Hey, Scooby-Doo, which hand did the Dreamweaver juggle his orb with?\n\nScooby: Uh, his right. No, l--left.\n\nShaggy: Sorry, Sheriff. It seems you're not quite the cryptmaster you thought. The Dreamweaver holds his orb in his off hand, not his main.\n\nFred: Uh, in non-nerdspeak?\n\nDaphne: It means this Dreamweaver is a righty, but ours is a lefty.\n\nVelma: Sheriff, it's time to face your fears one more time.\n\n(In the dream world, Sheriff Stone runs trying to escape from the Dreamweaver)\n\nSheriff Stone: (panting) Keep running. Don't look back.\n\nDreamweaver: (laughing) Rain of fire! (uses the orb to trap Sheriff Stone with the wall of fire) I've waited for this for a long, long time. Game over, Bronson.\n\nSheriff Stone: Time for some magic of my own. (unmasks himself revealing to be Fred)\n\nFred: Confess, Dreamweaver.\n\n(The Dreamweaver starts panicking, Fred unmasks himself revealing to be Shaggy)\n\nShaggy: Like, confess.\n\nDreamweaver: (scared) What?\n\n(Shaggy unmasks himself revealing to be Daphne)\n\nDaphne: Confess!\n\nDreamweaver: Aah!\n\n(Daphne walks and unmasks herself revealing to be Velma, Dreamweaver walks backwards scared)\n\nVelma: Confess!\n\n(Velma unmasks herself revealing to be Scooby)\n\nScooby: Confess!\n\n(Dreamweaver falls down scared, throws the purple orb, the orb is broken)\n\n(Dream world ends)\n\nHorbert: (wakes up in the bed) I confess! I did it! I did it! I'M THE DREAMWEAVER!\n\n(The gang with Sheriff Stone, Francilee and Melvin appeared)\n\nFred: (with the dream machine helmet on his head) Busted.\n\nHorbert: How--how did you know?\n\nVelma: In all the dreams, the Dreamweaver held his orb in his left hand. But when we looked at everybody else, guess what? They're all righties. You're the only lefty in the bunch.\n\nDaphne: This type of light bulb is used to stimulate them sleep. You used them to create this: a dream machine, which allowed you to project yourself into another person's dreams and manipulate them.\n\nFred: It cost you millions of dollars, which you loaned yourself from your own bank. Then you drove your car into your bank, blowing it up to cover your tracks.\n\nShaggy: Like, the only thing we don't know is why.\n\nHorbert: (to Sheriff Stone, Francilee and Melvin) It was all your fault!\n\nSheriff Stone, Francilee and Melvin: (annoyed) Huh?\n\n(In the flashback, the young Sheriff Stone, Francilee Jackson, Melvin Keisterbaum and Horbert Feist were playing Crypts and Creatures)\n\nYoung Bronson Stone: Horbert, the Dreamweaver raises his orb, ready to cast his smiting spell. Make a saving throw.\n\n(Young Horbert throws the dice to reach the highest number)\n\nYoung Horbert: Whoo-hoo!\n\n(The dice moved to the lowest number, Young Bronson Stone, Francilee, Melvin and Horbert are surprised)\n\nYoung Bronson Stone: The Dreamweaver laughs as he casts your broken, lifeless elven body into the eternal abyss.\n\nYoung Horbert: (shocked) NOOOOO!\n\n(Flashback ends)\n\nHorbert: I loved that elf, (sobs) I LOVED HIM MORE THAN MY OWN CHILDREN!? (annoyed) (to Sheriff Stone, Francilee and Melvin) And you took him away from me. You were all part of it! So I vowed to take away the things you all loved. (to the gang) And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you--you ROLE-PLAYING NERDS!\n\n(Sheriff Stone handcuffs Horbert and takes him into custody)\n\nMrs. Feist: Horbert, what are these people doing in our bedroom?\n\nHorbert: Go back to"
