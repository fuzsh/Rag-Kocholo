In 2010, during the celebrations of the Rock Day celebrated annually on July 13 in Brazil, the team called Brasiliense, from Taguatinga, in the Federal District, decided to make a shirt to paid tribute to the punk rock band Misfits.

The result is the image below, where the team put a series of images of the Misfits mascot, the Fiend Skull, under a blue background and is all very messy. The suggestion of the art with the legendary skull was given by a fan on the internet.

Misfits

The Misfits are an American punk rock band often recognized as the progenitors of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery. Founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, the original lineup consisted of vocalist and keyboardist Glenn Danzig, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Manny Martínez.

Danzig and Only were the only consistent members throughout the next six years, during which they released several EPs and singles, and with Only’s brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums Walk Among Us (1982) and Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood (1983), both considered touchstones of the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. The band has had several lineup changes over the years, with bassist Jerry Only being the only constant member in the group.
