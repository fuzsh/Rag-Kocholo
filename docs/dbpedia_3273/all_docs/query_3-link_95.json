        "text": "Aug. 7—Long before Chase Jackson became the world's top shot putter, she was already all-world at Los Alamos High School.\n\nJackson (neé Ealey) made her Olympics star turn in the early morning hours of Thursday at the Paris Games when she competed in the preliminary round of the shot put as one of the favorites to win the event — if not the favorite, thanks to her status as a two-time world champion.\n\nFor the people at Los Alamos who saw the teenager blow people away with her athleticism and power, they are proud of the 30-year-old's development into one of the elite athletes in the world.\n\nMany of her friends, teammates and classmates said they were going to sacrifice a little bit of sleep to watch her perform Thursday. Assuming she qualifies, she'll compete in the finals of the event Friday morning, Mountain time.\n\nSome of her former coaches and teammates say what Jackson has accomplished is impressive, but not surprising, because they saw the 1.0 version of the athlete before the upgraded version was unveiled.\n\nThat version was a state champion 100-meter champion sprinter, as well as champion shot putter. She was an All-State volleyball player her senior year and had a scholarship offer to play for the University of New Mexico after just picking up the sport as a sophomore. She played basketball for two years and soccer as a freshman.\n\n\"She just excelled at everything so quickly,\" said Erica Rendon, who was a volleyball teammate of Jackson's. \"Thinking back about it, I'm not surprised at how amazing she is now.\"\n\nThough Jackson's feats are unparalleled, she does follow great footsteps in Los Alamos. Carol Cady, a Hilltopper star in the early 1980s, competed in throwing events at the Olympics both in 1984 and 1988.\n\nThe 2.0 version of Jackson emerged after a four-year career at Oklahoma State University, where she was a runner-up in the NCAAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 2016. She became the U.S. indoor and outdoor champion in 2019, and her evolution took another step in 2022 when she won the shot put at the World Track and Field Championships, becoming the first American to do so.\n\n\"Someone her size and strength is just unbelievable,\" said Bob Scott, who was a throwing coach at Los Alamos when Jackson competed for the school from 2009-12. \"And her footwork ... What can I say? She's just so quick. It's amazing.\"\n\nAnd yet it wasn't. Scott said her blend of speed, strength and quickness helped her become the elite athlete she is. He is still amazed she could run the anchor leg of a state-championship 400-meter relay team, claim a 100 title, then earn another medal by taking the javelin within 90 minutes, which she did her junior year at the 2011 state track meet.\n\nFormer Los Alamos volleyball coach Diana Stokes, who coached Jackson when she first tried volleyball as a sophomore, said she overheard track coaches one time talking incredulously about the 5-foot-11 Jackson as she lined up for a 100 heat.\n\n\"They were talking to each other, 'Everybody talks about that girl,' \" Stokes recalled. \"'Look at her size and everybody says she's great.' I told them, 'You just wait,' and she won easily.\"\n\nFor all the success Jackson attained even as a freshman phenom, winning the 100 and anchoring the 400 relay to a Class 4A record, she never lost her herself in the hype.\n\nRendon said Jackson was a jokester and prankster, which underscored her happy-go-lucky nature. She was a regular fixture with Rendon's family as she played club volleyball with them for one year before she turned her focus to track and field. Rendon's mother, Laura Rendon, one time gave Jackson a book to read just so she would stop talking for an hour or two.\n\n\"She was so much fun,\" Rendon said. \"She had a great, silly personality and never took things too seriously. She was just a really fun person to be around.\"\n\nStokes and Scott said Jackson never let success get to her head, and found her very coachable.\n\n\"She had a great personality and is just an all-around good person,\" Stokes said.\n\nScott said Jackson was a good teammate who would do anything to help the team, even though it stunted her growth as a thrower. Despite competing in sprints, the javelin and shot put, Jackson still holds the 5A state record in the event (47 feet, 3 inches) and is the second-best distance overall.\n\nThat generosity continued into college, as Jackson told him there were times she would run on Oklahoma State's 400 relay team.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh my God, how can you do that?' \" Scott said. \"Well, because she can.\""
