        "text": "Coach: Mario Zagallo / Luiz Felipe Scolari\n\nAchievements: World Cup winners 2002, Finalists 1998\n\nKey Players: Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, R. Carlos, Cafu, Dunga, Denilson\n\nStar Player: Ronaldo\n\nFormation: 4-2-2-2\n\nBrazi won the World Cup in 1994 but winning alone is not enough for Brazilians and the ultra-pragmatic side that accomplished this was never really loved. In 1998 the veteran Zagallo was back and produced a team that played with typically Brazilian attacking flair. The young Ronaldo was the star of that year's world Cup and he was accompanied by the attacking talents of Rivaldo and Leonardo, the authoritative defensive presence of Dunga and the brilliant attacking full-backs: Roberto Carlos and Cafu. Brazil's familiar 4-2-2-2 was back to accommodate these various talents. Unfortunately a myseterius episode involving Ronaldo's fitness before the Final clearly affected the team and they slumped to a 3-0 defeat.\n\nIn 2002 the more pragmatic Scolari gave the team a better balance - employing a 3-4-3 system to allow the full-backs to charge forward whilst being releived of some of their defensive duties. Up front the 'three Rs' combination, now incorporating the magical Ronaldinho delighted spectators in the tournament. For Ronaldo, after major injuries that meant he played very few club games between the World Cups, victory in 2002 was seen as a well deserved redemption, justly confirming his status as one of the game's legends.\n\nBrazil 1998"
