        "text": "(CNN) -- Carlos Alberto Parreira will coach hosts South Africa at the 2010 World Cup after he was reappointed by the South African Football Association on Friday.\n\nThe 66-year-old Brazilian replaces compatriot Joel Santana who was sacked after a miserable run of eight losses in nine friendly internationals.\n\nParreira, who was in charge of the Bafana Bafana from February 2007 to April 2008 and had recommended his predecessor Santana, has signed an eight-month deal until the end of next year's finals.\n\nThe decision to reappointment Parreira, who coached Brazil to victory in the 1994 World Cup in the United States, was confirmed by SAFA president Kirsten Nematandani 230 days before the event kicks off on June 11.\n\n\"I am pleased on behalf of the executive committee to announce to you that after that lengthy debate that we had, we want to announce that the country has a coach - and that coach is Mr Parreira,\" Nematandani told a press conference to confirm the decision.\n\nIs Carlos Alberto Parreira the right man to lead South Africa at the 2010 World Cup? Sound Off below.\n\n\"It does not only stop there and we felt that it was very important because of the time that we have to ensure that he comes in as soon as possible and takes the process forward.\n\n\"There were a number of candidates, but we felt that if we had to go through the process, we may run up against time. It was not easy for this executive committee to arrive at this decision,\"\n\n\"You will understand that this is a person that had started this process. The players we are looking at now are his players. We felt that logically after we didn't have time, it was best to get somebody who will continue with the process that he has started.\"\n\nNematandani played down concerns that the 66-year-old would again leave the country in the lurch as he did initially when he called time to be with his sick wife and also revealed that following the World Cup the country will be lead by a South African.\n\nHe said: \"One thing for sure is that he is going to be in the country and all those questions can be asked to him. But we did was put it forward to him that it is important that he brings his family here.\n\n\"I must confirm that we have justice to the process and we hope everything will go according to plan. With so few days to go before the World Cup, surely you'll agree with us that there is a big task ahead of us.\n\n\"But we do believe it is a task that we should be able to overcome and ensure that come 2010 we have a team that can compete against the best.\"\n\nNematandani added: \"The task of the coach is to take the team to 2010 and that's the end of it. I need to announce that we have taken a definitive decision that post-2010 it will be wise not to appoint anyone else, but a South African.\n\n\"It will be a principle stand that we have taken, meaning the next coach will be one of yours, a South African.\""
