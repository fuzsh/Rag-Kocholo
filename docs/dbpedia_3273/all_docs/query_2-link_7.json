Her journey began with dancing and modelling, but she truly stepped into the limelight in 2002 when her charismatic presence and singing talent earned her a spot in the television talent show, Popstars: The Rivals. The competition resulted in the formation of Girls Aloud, one of the most successful British pop groups in the 21st century. With their harmonious blend and Cheryl's distinctive vocals, they released 20 consecutive Top 10 singles in the UK, including four number ones. Besides her music career, Cheryl also made impactful strides in television. In 2008, she joined the judging panel of the popular reality TV show The X Factor.

He was born on February 23, 1983, in Columbia, South Carolina to Tamil Muslim parents from India. Ansari's passion for comedy blossomed during his time at the New York University Stern School of Business, where he graduated with a degree in marketing. Ansari's career breakthrough came with his role as Tom Haverford on the critically acclaimed NBC series Parks and Recreation which aired from 2009 to 2015. His portrayal of the quirky, ambitious city official earned him a place among the top comedic performers of his generation. Beyond acting, Ansari co-created and starred in the Netflix series Master of None, which won him several awards including the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2018, making him the first Asian-American actor to win this award. In addition to his successful television career, Ansari also shines as a stand-up comedian and author.

Born on August 11, 1983, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, Hemsworth's acting career took flight with his role as Kim Hyde in the popular Australian TV series Home and Away. However, it was his portrayal of Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that catapulted him to international stardom. Hemsworth's embodiment of the Norse god Thor began with the titular movie Thor released by Marvel Studios. His compelling performance earned him critical acclaim and he reprised this iconic character in several sequels and Avengers films. Beyond his superhero persona, though, lies a versatile actor whose repertoire includes genres ranging from horror to biographical sports dramas. He demonstrated this versatility through movies like The Cabin in the Woods, a horror film where he played a significant role; Rush, where he portrayed Formula One driver James Hunt; and In The Heart Of The Sea, an adventure-drama based on real-life events. Beyond acting, Chris Hemsworth has also made notable contributions to philanthropy. He supports various charitable organizations like Australian Childhood Foundation and Make-A-Wish Foundation. Despite being one of Hollywood's leading men, Hemsworth maintains strong ties with his home country Australia - often using his platform to raise awareness about environmental issues affecting Australia such as bushfires and conservation efforts."
