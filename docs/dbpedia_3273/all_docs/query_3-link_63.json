        "text": "Brazilian Ronaldinho has played 87 times for his country\n\nRonaldinho could miss the World Cup after being omitted from Brazil's final warm-up friendly ahead of the summer tournament in South Africa.\n\nHe will not face Ireland at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium in London on 2 March.\n\nThe AC Milan star, 29, has not played for Brazil since the start of 2009, but his improved recent form has encouraged supporters to call for his return.\n\nBut coach Dunga has resisted pressure from the fans and local media in Brazil to recall the ex-Barcelona forward.\n\nThe 1994 World Cup winning captain has kept faith with Michel Bastos (Lyon), Juan and Doni (both Roma), Kleberson (Flamengo) and Gilberto (Cruzeiro).\n\nFormer Manchester City forward Robinho, who is now on-loan at Santos, has been included in the squad as has Liverpool midfielder Lucas. But there is no place for Manchester United midfielder Anderson.\n\nRonaldinho won the World Cup in 2002 and famously knocked out England at that tournament after lobbing keeper David Seaman with a second-half free-kick.\n\nBrazil legend Pele was another who called for Ronaldinho to return to the fold.\n\nRonaldinho has appeared 87 times for his country, scoring 32 times.\n\nHe was also twice named World player of the year in 2004 and 2005 and has won the prestigious Ballon d'Or (european player of the year) once.\n\nBrazil squad to face Ireland:\n\nGoalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Inter Milan), Doni (Roma).\n\nDefenders: Maicon (Inter Milan), Daniel Alves (Barcelona), Gilberto (Cruzeiro), Michel Bastos (Lyon), Juan (Roma), Lucio (Inter Milan), Luisao (Benfica), Thiago Silva (AC Milan).\n\nMidfielders: Gilberto Silva (Panathinaikos), Josue (Wolfsburg), Felipe Melo (Juventus), Lucas (Liverpool), Kaka (Real Madrid), Ramires (Benfica), Elano (Galatasaray), Julio Baptista (Roma), Kleberson (Flamengo).\n\nForwards: Robinho (Santos), Adriano (Flamengo), Nilmar (Villarreal), Luis Fabiano (Seville)."
