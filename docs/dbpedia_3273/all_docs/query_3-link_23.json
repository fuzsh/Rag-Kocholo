        "text": "This page by Ramsey Al-Khalil\n\nA nation of many soccer triumphs, Brazil has seen dozens of managers of the national team. On their way to a record five FIFA World Cup titles, there have been several coaches whose tenures stick out for at least one large reason. Read a bit about eight of the most well-known leaders of the Selecao in Brazilian history.\n\nFlávio Costa was the manager of the Brazilian national team during the 1950 FIFA World Cup. Uruguay’s victory over Brazil in the final has caused it to be regarded as the worst thing to ever happen to the nation. As a result of the loss, he lost prestige among much of his previous supporters, though he remained coachin 1955 and 1956 [1].\n\nCláudio Coutinho was originally appointed as the physical fitness coach of the national team in preparation for the 1970 World Cup, during which he introduced the Cooper method to the team [2]. This method, originally used in 1968 for military purposes, consists of players running as far as possible in a 12-minute span [3]. After remaining the technical coordinator of the team in the 1974 World Cup, he took the reigns in 1978 when he applied the philosophy of players working together like parts of a larger machine.\n\nDunga, born Carlos Caetano Bledorn Verri, played on the World Cup champion team in 1994 and coached the Selecao during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, his tenure was short since he was let go shortly after Brazil’s quarterfinal exit from the tournament [4]. He is also known for leading the Brazilian squad in their comeback from a 2-0 deficit against the United States in the 2009 Confederations Cup final, a match they eventually won 3-2.\n\nLuiz Antonio Venker de Menezes, known to the world as Mano Menezes, replaced Dunga as the manager of the national team following their loss in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Having experienced some early victories [with only 4 players remaining from the World Cup roster], the team lost in the quarterfinals of the 2011 Copa America to Paraguay and again to Mexico in the final of the 2010 Summer Olympics [5, 6]. Following these disappointing finishes, he was let go by the CBF [7].\n\nCarlos Alberto Parreira managed the Selecao to victory during the 1994 World Cup, the 2004 Copa America, and the 2005 Confederations Cup. Parreira compiled a technical report of the 2002 World Cup, and soon after was reinstated as manager. However, this ended soon after 2006 when he failed to get the national team past the quarterfinals of the World Cup and drew much criticism for mismanaging his players.\n\nLuiz Felipe Scolari, pictured above, was appointed managed of Brazil in 2001. Despite having nearly missed qualification for the 2002 World Cup, the squad thrived in South Korea/Japan and eventually won their fifth World Cup title. At the end of the same year, Scolari resigned from his position [8]. In 2012, he replaced Mano Menezes as manager and has since won the 2013 Confederations Cup [9, 10]. He is tasked with winning the 2014 World Cup on home soil, something which many people are excited to see unfold.\n\nTelê Santana is credited with assembling the Brazilian squads in 1982 and 1986, teams that are widely considered the best squads in history to have never won a World Cup. Regardless, he’s still pitted as one of the most important football managers in the nation’s history and is well known for his offensive-minded style of play.\n\nMário Zagallo was the first person in history to win the World Cup as both a player (1958 and 1962) and a manager (1970; 1994 as assistant coach) [11].\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flávio_Costa\n\nhttp://national.soccerhall.org/history/NASL_AllTimeCoachesRegistry.htm\n\nCooper, Kenneth H.
