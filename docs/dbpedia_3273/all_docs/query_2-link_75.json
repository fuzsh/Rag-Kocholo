The Host Country Brazil 113 Photo: Divulgação Secom/Prefeitura de São Paulo Brazil stands out for its mixture of indigenous, European, African and Asian roots, with its various facets reflected in the national culture. Food, music, crafts, architecture and popular festivals mix values that go beyond borders. Brazil is the country of racial, cultural, religious and social tolerance. The many ethnic groups present in the Brazilian territory coexist without hostility and there are an experience trading environment and respect for the differences. This peaceful coexistence results in popular versatile culture manifestations, full of originality. Diversity also sets the tone for the rich national architectural heritage, ranging from colonial baroque to the modernism of the Federal Capital, Brasilia. Immigration was of extreme importance to form the national culture. Characteristics of the four corners of the world have been incorporated by Brazilians over the five centuries since the Portuguese arrived in Brazil in 1500. In addition to the contributions of the native Indians, Africans and Portuguese colonists, the significant arrival of immigrants from all parts of Europe, Middle East and Asia has influenced the formation of the national identity. Immigrants from neighboring countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Chile, also contributed to the diversification of customs, habits and beliefs. Despite the large territory, the same language is spoken in all Brazilian regions. Portuguese is the fifth most spoken language in the world, and third among the Westerners, after English and Spanish.\n\n5. The Host Country Brazil 114 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL™ – MEDIA GUIDE Brazil was a colony of Portugal from the landing of Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500 until 1815, when it was elevated to the United Kingdom of Portugal and Algarve. In 1808, the capital of the Portuguese kingdom was moved from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, after the invasion of Napoleon's troops and after 14 years, Brazil became independent in 1822. In 1889, it passed from Empire to Republic. The current Constitution defines Brazil as a Federal Republic. The Federation is formed by the Federal District, 26 states and 5,564 municipalities. Photo: Divulgação RioTur Brazil has a huge variety of climates and micro- climates, due to its vast territorial extension. Thus, it is possible to have in the same month of the year a city in the north with temperatures above 30° C and others, usually in the south, with temperatures below zero. According to studies by the National Institute of Meteorology, the FIFA World Cup™ will be played in cities that are divided into four different types of climate during June and July.

Maracanã was built for the 1950 FIFA World Cup™, and for many years it was the largest stadium in the world. At the championship final, about 200 000 people watched Uruguay defeat Brazil (2-1), in what was called by the Uruguayans “The Maracanazo” and considered the greatest tragedy in the history of Brazilian soccer. Brazilian passion for football is notorious and recorded in numbers. The ten largest audiences in soccer belong to Brazil. But not only because of Maracanã. In almost every Brazilian state, historic antagonisms are exposed in classics, as Corinthians x Palmeiras (São Paulo), Atlético x Cruzeiro (Belo Horizonte), Grêmio x Internacional (Porto Alegre), Bahia x Vitória (Salvador), Ceará x Fortaleza (Fortaleza) and Santa Cruz x Sport (Recife), all bringing large crowds throughout the country. Photo: Action Images In 1958, for the first time, the Brazilian Team assembled a professional structure to compete in the FIFA World Cup™. Counting on a generation of unforgettable superstars, as Pele, Garrincha, Didi, Nilton Santos, among others, they were champions for the first time. In 1962 and 1970 they repeated the act. At that time, Brazil was, indeed, the country of soccer. In the 80s, Brazil became a reference in exporting players to all parts of the world. By the way, the “players factory” does not stop production. Five players were already elected best in the world by FIFA: Romário (1994), Ronaldo (1996, 1997 and 2002), Rivaldo (1999), Ronaldinho Gaúcho (2004 and 2005) and Kaká (2007). There are Brazilian players in several federations around the world.\n\n7. The Host Country Brazil 116 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL™ – MEDIA GUIDE In the beginning of the 90’s, a deep modernization was implemented in CBF (Confederacao Brasileira de Futebol), making it self-sufficient and able to meet the needs of the Brazilian Team in all categories. The result was a new cycle of conquests, with three Cup finals and two FIFA World Cup™ titles (1994 and 2002). Despite all this passion and all these achievements, Brazilians were missing the opportunity to have modern, comfortable and impressive stadiums. With the FIFA World Cup™, the country will have 12 totally new sites, completely adapted to what is most modern in concept that the fan is the customer of a unique spectacle. Stadiums like Maracanã, Mineirão, Fonte Nova, Beira-Rio and Castelão, used to receive huge public, were fully modernized for the competition. Cities such as São Paulo, Cuiaba, Brasilia, Manaus, Recife and Natal received completely new arenas, due to the FIFA World Cup™.\n\n8.

BHZ Host Cities Belo Horizonte 119 Since the 18th century, during the days of the Inconfidência Mineira – an independence conspiracy against the domination of the Portuguese crown – the state of Minas Gerais gambled with the idea of instating a new capital to replace Ouro Preto. Once Brazil declared its independence (1822) and became a republic in 1889, the stage was set for a new capital to be chosen. Among several contestants, the small village of Curral del-Rei achieved the right to host the Cidade de Minas, officially inaugurated in 1897 and whose name was eventually changed in 1906 to Belo Horizonte (Portuguese for ‘beautiful horizon'). Engineer Aarao Reis, an admirer of Paris and Washington, D.C., was responsible for putting the urban planning for the new state capital together. What his project did not contemplate, though, was the fast-paced development through which Belo Horizonte would go after a period of stagnation in the first decades of the 20th century. Soon the city expanded beyond its original limits and new neighbourhood had to be planned and developed – the most notorious of them the Pampulha, an area of wide avenues and many squares and parks designed in the 1940s by Brazil's premier architect Oscar Niemeyer. Today Belo Horizonte – or Beagá, as the city is famously known, after the sound of initials BH in Portuguese – is the sixth-most populous city in Brazil with about 2.4 million residents, while its metropolitan area comprising a total 34 cities ranks third in the country, behind Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. From the beauty of its green areas to the careful city-planning; from the wide array of cultural activities to the nature wonders of the Serra do Curral surrounding it, Belo Horizonte has a lot to entertain its visitors.

Host Cities Belo Horizonte 120 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL™ – MEDIA GUIDE Football The number one question when someone meets a belo-horizontino is often the same: Atletico Mineiro or Cruzeiro? The city is in love with football and lives under a constant atmosphere of rivalry between two of the top contenders in Brazilian football: Clube Atletico Mineiro, the Galo (Rooster), and Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, also known as the Raposa (Fox). América Futebol Clube, the Coelho (Rabbit), is also a traditional state rival and has had its successful surges over the years. Atletico Mineiro, the winner of the maiden edition of the Campeonato Brasileiro in 1971 and current champion of Copa Libertadores has been graced by the talents of Reinaldo, Toninho Cerezo, Eder and Ronaldinho Gaucho, among others, while Cruzeiro's silverware collection goes from two Bra- sileiros (in 2003 and 2013) to four Copa do Brasil titles, two Copa Libertadores crowns (1976 and 1997). The Raposa were the first stage in the career of such big names as Tostão and Ronaldo. The ultimate stage for the Atletico vs. Cruzeiro derbies and for the big matches held in the state of Minas Gerais is the Mineirao; a comfortable 62,000-seater that has once housed over 100,000 fans and is one of the best and most charismatic football grounds in Brazil.

BHZ Host Cities Belo Horizonte 121 Photo: Click Estudio Profissional – Acervo Belotur Estadio Mineirao One of the most historic venues in Brazilian football and called home by Cruzeiro, the 62,547 capacity Estadio Mineirao has undergone a complete overhaul prior to hosting three matches at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ Mineirao will host six games, including one semi- final. The modernisation project included the lowering of the pitch surface and improving stadium accessibility, among other issues, with sustainability principles at the core of all work carried out. Exemplifying this approach is the facility to capture and store up to 6,270,000 liters of rainwater, which can then be reused. Located in the Pampulha neighbourhood of Belo Horizonte and inaugurated on 5 December 1965, the stadium belongs to the Minas Gerais state government. Going by the official name of the Estadio Governador Magalhães Pinto, in footballing circles it is almost universally known as the Mineirao. Boasting an enthusiastic and vibrant atmosphere on matchdays, whether it be Galo (Atletico Mineiro) or Raposa (Cruzeiro) that are playing there, the Mineirao has also proved a worthy setting for Brazilian national team matches – including the Seleção’s clashes with arch-rivals Argentina in FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers in 2004 and 2008.\n\n15.

Brasilia\n\n22. BRS Host Cities Brasilia 127 The city that will host seven games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ is the accomplishment of the work of three of Brazil’s most important and memorable men, who in the middle of the last century planned to transfer the capital of the country from Rio de Janeiro to the centre lands of the territory: president Juscelino Kubitschek and architects Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer. Built from sketches, Brasilia is a tribute to modern architecture and its buildings, churches and palaces are part of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage registry. But the city’s importance goes far beyond the cultural aspects. Since 1960, Brasilia is the centre of power in Brazil, uniting the three spheres of government – Executive, Legislative and Judiciary. Brasilia was planned to be a nice place to work and live. Localized in the the heart of the country, it is a green city, embraced by the natural diversity of the Cerrado. With 120 m2 of green area per inhabitant – almost four times what is recommend by World Health Organization (WHO) - Brasilia has 50 million m2 of grass covered lands, 4 million planted trees and one thousand rock-gardens sharing space with planned apartment buildings, divided in the so called superblocks. The large avenues and roads were built for fast displacement. Still, the federal capital is also Brazil’s third gastronomic centre, with more than 3,5 thousand restaurants, bars and coffees serving dishes and drinks from the traditional Brazilian cuisine. One of the city's striking features is its wide avenues, which surround both its public buildings and its two districts, one to the north and the other to the south. These are divided into so-called superblocks, each of which contains numerous buildings. The central part of this “cross” is the Praça dos Três Poderes (Three Powers' Square). Here can be found the country's seats of Executive and Legislative Power as well as the headquarters of the Supreme Federal Court. Photo: Pedro Ventura\n\n23. Host Cities Brasilia 128 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL™ – MEDIA GUIDE Football Since a good part of the people living in Brasilia comes from other parts of the country, there is a huge number of fans of Brazil’s most famous football teams, like Flamengo, Corinthians, Atletico-MG and Internacional, only to name four. This passion is reflected in numbers: in 2013 Estadio Nacional Mané Garrincha had the highest average audience between Brazilian stadia – 34,413. But the Federal District has also its own teams, which the most famous are Gama and Brasiliense.

BRS Host Cities Brasilia 129 Estadio Nacional Few Brazilian cities can match Brasilia when it comes to architecture, and the imposing Estadio Nacional Mané Garrincha, named after Brazilian soccer legend Garrincha, is a reflection of that, an arena with seating for 70,042 spectators, making it the second largest of the stadiums hosting matches at the 2014 FIFA World Cup™. In the place where once stood the former Estadio Mané Garrincha, the Estadio Nacional boasts a new facade, metal roof and stands, as well as a lowered pitch enabling unobstructed views from every seat. Founded on carbon neutrality, recycling and complete access via public transport, this environmentally friendly construction project will consolidate Brasilia’s status as a world leader in sustainable urban planning, creating a valuable legacy for other sectors of the local economy.

CBA Host Cities Cuiaba 135 The capital of the state of Mato Grosso, Cuiaba is situated in the exact geographic centre of South America, 2,000 km from both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. It was founded in 1719 during the Brazilian Gold Rush, and is home to a number of historical buildings which were declared national heritage sites in 1992. For around 250 years, Cuiaba had a reputation for being a quiet backwater in the mid-west of Brazil. That changed abruptly during the 20th century after the Brazilian government implemented a plan aimed at the economic expansion of the heartland of the country. This resulted in motorways linking Mato Grosso to the states of Goias and Sao Paulo, and within 30 years the population had grown from 57,000 in 1960 to 400,000 in 1990. The enormous 3,538 km2 metropolis of Cuiaba is today home to more than 540,000 people. Photo: Beto Garavello/LUME Cuiaba itself is situated in a unique spot for tourists, located as it is at the nexus of three of the most important and unique ecosystems in Brazil: the grasslands of the Cerrado, the wetlands of the Pantanal and the Amazon. Surrounded by such exuberant natural delights, it is no wonder that Cuiaba is known as the Cidade Verde, or the Green City. The city is also not far from one of the most remarkable natural landscapes in Brazil, the Chapada dos Guimaraes, a national park of 3,300 km2 dotted with archaeological sites, which attracts thousands of visitors every year.\n\n33.

CUR Host Cities Curitiba 143 Curitiba is the perfect example of how a city can develop and grow in an organised, responsible fashion. After becoming capital of the state of Parana in 1853, the development of the city was subject to a series of urban planning projects aimed at avoiding unchecked growth. Curitiba has become an example to follow in terms of dealing with sensitive issues of public transport and environmental protection. With 1.8 million inhabitants, the capital of Parana is the most populous city in the south of Brazil. It is also the centrepiece of a prosperous metropolitan area, which ranks fourth in Brazil in terms of contribution to GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Despite its size, Curitiba offers its residents a high quality of life, thanks to its countless parks and a rich, diverse cultural calendar. This cultural diversity can be traced to the waves of immi- gration that arrived in the city during the 20th century. During this period, a large number of German, Italian, Ukrainian and Polish immigrants moved to the south of Brazil. Their influence can be felt in the Italian restaurants of the Santa Felicidade neighbourhood, the Bosque Alemao (“the German Woods”), and the Memorial Ucraniano, a replica of a typical Ukrainian church located in the Parque Tingui. There is certainly no shortage of parks in Curitiba. The city’s desire to preserve green spaces amongst the hustle and bustle of urban life can be seen in oases such as the Parque Tangua, Parque Barigui and the beautyful Jardim Botanico. Another fascinating spot is the Opera de Arame, a wonderful steel and glass building, and the Oscar Niemeyer Museum, designed by the legendary architect himself.

Their rivalry began in 1924 and the Atletiba derby is one of the most important clássicos in the country. Coritiba won the Brazilian title in 1985 and play at the Couto Pereira stadium, while Atletico Paranaense, whose home is the Arena da Baixada, were national champions in 2001. The third team in the city is Parana Clube, formed in 1989 following the merger of two other clubs, Colorado and Pinheiros.

FTL Host Cities Fortaleza 151 With shiny days the most part of the year, Fortaleza is known as “The city of light”, a place with wonderful beaches, gentle people and which history and culture are influenced by native Brazilians and European conquerors. Founded as a village in 1726 by the Portuguese, it became the capital of the state of Ceará in 1799. But the city owes its name to the period between 1637 to 1654, when it was controlled by the Dutch, who built the “Schoonenborch”, or Fort, to defend it from foreign invaders. Fortaleza has been one of the main tourist destinations in the northeast of Brazil for several years. It is an attractive city, not only for people from other parts of the country, but especially for Europeans, because of its geographical position – it takes only a 6h30 flight from Europe. The tourism potential and the public investments over the last years has influenced the growth of Fortaleza, which is a densely populated city with over 2,5 million people living in the metropolitan area. The beaches are really Fortaleza’s most famous attractions: the Praia do Futuro (Future Beach) where one can taste fresh seafood; Iracema with its bars and nightclubs and the bucolic Mucuripe Beach, from where fishermen venture into the sea with their jangadas (handmade wooden boats). The coastal Beira Mar Avenue is also the place for a traditional daily craftsmen's fair and for some of the top spots to dance the forró, a typical rhythm from the northeast of Brazil. Over the decades, as the city built infrastructure to receive visitants, new attractions emerged, like the Centro Dragão do Mar de Arte e Cultura (Sea Dragon Art and Culture Centre) and the Beach Park, Brazil's largest water park, with several cutting-edge speed-slides distributed along 35,000 square kilometres.

Host Cities Fortaleza 152 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL™ – MEDIA GUIDE Football Two of the most popular clubs from the northeast of Brazil come from Fortaleza: Ceará Sporting Club and Fortaleza Esporte Clube. Both teams have historically shared the attention of the fans throughout the whole state of Ceará, as well as the state titles. The two sides have also played important roles in national competitions: Ceará were the runner- ups in the Copa do Brasil in 1994, when they lost to Grêmio, and they reached the semi-finals in 2005, while Fortaleza finished runners-up twice in the Taça Brasil (a predecessor to Campeonato Brasileiro), in 1960 and 1968. The city of Fortaleza offers two main stadiums for the matches involving Ceará, Fortaleza and Ferroviário Esporte Clube: the new Castelão, which will host six 2014 FIFA World Cup™ games, with the capacity to accommodate 64.846 fans and the city-owned Presidente Vargas.

And it is an attachment that can only grow with the now completely remodeled Castelão. Built in 1973 and officially known as the Estadio Governador Plácido Castelo, the Castelão is the home to both teams and has been entirely renovated to host matches at the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. As well as having its capacity increased to 64,846, the revamped stadium has an underground car park with 1,900 spaces, executive boxes, a VIP area, media centre, mixed zone and fully refurbished dressing rooms. In addition, a new roof now covers all its tiers, including the pitchside ring of seating. Access to the Castelão has also been upgraded, with the creation of four exclusive bus lanes and a LRV (light rail vehicle) lines, making it far easier for fans to reach the stadium and the complex it is part of, which will house restaurants, cinemas, a hotel and an Olympic centre. The Castelão was the venue for the Seleção’s second group match at 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, against Mexico. The support from the home team fans was amazing, boosting Brazilians players to beat the Mexicans 2:1. The two teams will meet again on that same ground now at 2014 FIFA World Cup™ on 17 June.

The dark waters of the Negro and the muddy waters of the Solimoes flow side by side for 18 km, divided as though by an invisible barrier, creating one of the most majestic sights in the Amazon region. Manaus evolved constantly following its foundation in 1669, first becoming the capital of the state of Amazonas and finally the great metropolis that it is today. It is currently the 12th biggest city in Brazil, with almost 2,000,000 residents, and has been the region’s main economic hub since it was designated a Free Trade Zone. Photos: Brazilian Ministry of Sports The combination of the natural beauty that flourishes in and around the city, a rich local culture, and the energy of a growing metropolis give Manaus a unique atmos- phere, reflected in attractions such as the Teatro Amazonas – a concert hall that is home to the annual Festival Amazonas de Opera – and Boi Manaus (“Manaus Bull”), a festival that celebrates the anniversary of the city and is fuelled by the infectious rhythms of the Boi-Bumba dance.\n\n63.

NTL Host Cities Natal 167 Known as the Cidade do Sol – the City of Sun – thanks to its predominantly sunny weather and average annual temperature of 28°C, Natal is one of the gems of Brazil's northeast region. With breathtaking natural beauty, particularly its stunning beaches and enormous, rolling sand dunes, Natal is Brazil's closest city to Europe. Founded on 25 December 1599 when Brazil was still a Portuguese colony, today Natal is the second-smallest of Brazil's state capitals by area, and sixth-biggest state capital by popu- lation density. The local economy is based on various areas of commerce and services, including health and education. The city's large-scale industrial complexes are also of note. Historically, Natal was a battleground between the Portuguese and French pirates, which had taken control of the Rio Grande do Norte captaincy around the year 1600. The dispute – and the subsequent Portuguese victory – gave rise to the Forte do Reis Magos (Fortress of the Magi), which remains an architectural landmark for the entire state of Rio Grande do Norte to this day.

Its society has been strongly influenced by the culture and customs of the German, Italian, Portuguese and Polish immigrants who arrived in Porto Alegre as a result of great waves of European migration here in the 19th and 20th centuries. Different from most of Brazil, the climate in Porto Alegre is classed as “humid subtropical”, characterised by its well-defined seasons, with scorching summers and harsh winters. The average temperature for the months of June and July is around 15°C, but temperatures close to or even below freezing are not uncommon during the cold nights that this season brings.

RCF Host Cities Recife 183 A city moved by music and football, with beautiful beaches and great gastronomy. This is Recife, the capital of the state of Pernambuco. From the rhythm of Frevo to the thrill of the great duels between Santa Cruz, Sport Clube do Recife and Naútico, three of Brazil’s most traditional football clubs, it’s impossible to leave Recife without enjoying wonderful times. With nearly 3.7 million people in the metropolitan area, which includes another 13 cities, like Olinda and Jaboatão dos Guararapes, Recife is called “the capital of the Northeast”. Like Fortaleza, in the state of Ceará, the history of Recife is influenced by the struggle between Portugal and Netherlands for the control of commercial roots in the South Atlantic in the 17th century. As the Dutch West India Company dominated the region – the city was taken from the Portuguese garrison in 1630 – Maurice of Nassau disembarked in Recife in 1637 and ordered the construction of bridges, canals and levees of the then-called Mauritsstad or Maurice City, which was the capital of the Dutch colonies in the Americas. Maurice of Nassau's term only lasted until 1644, but Recife inherited its architectural legacy that eventually led to the nickname “the Brazilian Venice”. Photo: Rafa Medeiros Because of the Dutch presence and the several twists of fate over its history, besides the tropical climate and the spectacular beaches that are common to the northeastern coast of Brazil, the region of Recife is also prolific on historical attributes, such as the Orange Fort and the very city of Olinda, which was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1982. But Recife’s most visited tourist attractions are really the beaches. Not only the ones found in the urban area, like Boa Viagem, Pina and Piedade, which together have nearly 8km of sand and warm water, but also some natural paradises like Porto de Galinhas, which stands among the top tourist destinations in the country and is located some 70 km away from Recife. Like in other parts of Brazil, it is possible to enjoy the sun and the sea while partying in the streets of Recife. Especially during Carnival, when the seaside streets and avenues gather millions of people dancing Frevo and Macaratu, two of Pernambuco’s most famous rhythms. While in the city centre, always on the first saturday of the Carnival, a huge crowd follows the steps of the Galo da Madrugada, the biggest carnival block in the world, with nearly two million participants.\n\n93. Host Cities Recife 184 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL™ – MEDIA GUIDE Football One say that football is passion. And in Recife this is very true. It is a tough task to determine which of the three top clubs of the state of Pernambuco relies on a more passionate fan base; Sport Club do Recife, Santa Cruz Futebol Clube or Clube Náutico Capibaribe. All three teams have had glorious moments, although Sport stand slightly apart from their competitors thanks to two major national titles: the 1987 Campeonato Brasileiro and 2008 Copa do Brasil.

RIO Host Cities Rio de Janeiro 191 Friendly and happy people, intense nightlife, lovely beaches and other worldwide famous tourist attractions like Pão de Açucar and Cristo Redentor. A place where nature, art and culture live together in perfect harmony. This is Rio de Janeiro, a fantastic city, chosen to host seven games during 2014 FIFA World Cup™, including the final. Founded on 1 March 1565 by the Portuguese Estácio de Sá, Rio de Janeiro was the second capital of Brazil, after Salvador, from 1763 to 1960. Preserving many memories from this time, the city has a strong cultural and economic role and it is Brazil’s most important gateway for visitors as well as Latin America’s number one tourist destination. It has the second largest GPD in the country, estimated at about R$ 209 billion. Highlights of the calendar are News Year’s Eve celebrations and Carnaval. On the 31st of December, the fireworks show at the beaches, especially Copacabana, usually gathers as much as 2 million people. During Carnaval, the Samba School’s show at Sambódromo and the more than 400 carnival clubs that parade through the streets of the city grasp millions of cariocas and tourist from all parts of Brazil and the world. In Rio, the most visited places are Pão de Açucar and Cristo Redentor, from where one can have a breath taking view from the whole city. And from above, it’s possible to see another symbol of the city: Maracanã. Photo: Divulgação RioTur Built to host eight games of the 1950 FIFA World Cup™, the temple of Brazilian football has a long list of historical moments. Starting with fateful 1-2 loss of the home country to Uruguay at the FIFA World Cup™ final, shocking more than 200.000 fans at the stadium. It was there also that Pelé scored his thousandth goal on 19 November 1969. For those who decide to explore Rio’s nearby cities, there are very different and attractable options. One can choose between the fantastic beaches in Buzios, Cabo Frio, Angra dos Reis and Paraty, or a trip to the mountain in places like Petrópolis, Teresópolis and Nova Friburgo, with climates and customs that, somehow, resemble European cities.\n\n103.

Once the largest stadium in the world, packing in crowds of up to 200,000 – among the highest attendances ever seen in the history of the game – Maracana will have a reduced capacity of 76,935 for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. It remains, nevertheless, the country’s biggest football ground. Respecting the original layout of the stadium, the project for its refurbishment includes the demolition of the lower ring of seats, the construction of a new ring offering improved visibility, the expansion of the access ramps and the replacement of all seating. The stadium will also be fitted with a new roof complete with a rainwater collection system. The facade, which has been listed by the National Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage, will remain untouched.\n\n105.

SAL Host Cities Salvador 199 When the Portuguese crown first decided to carry out the endeavour of colonising Brazil, the first urban area to be settled in was Salvador, which was established on 29 March 1549. This is one of the reasons why the coastal city in the country's northeast was one of the main poles of slave trade in South America. As a consequence, Salvador grew under deep influence of Portuguese, Afro-descendents and indigenous alike: a situation that contributed to the cultural richness that typifies the city today. The presence of African elements is all around in Salvador, from the circles of capoeira (a combination of martial art and dance brought to Brazil by African slaves) at the Modelo Market to the beat of the agogôs and atabaques (percussion instruments) in the rites of the Candomblé – a syncretic religion conceived in Brazil. Such African heritage has awarded Salvador with the nickname Roma Negra (Black Rome). Photo: Divulgação Secom/ Prefeitura de Salvador Salvador's privileged topography is one of its most appealing attributes, with a clear division between the Cidade Baixa and Cidade Alta (Low City and High City), both of which are connected to each other by one of the city's most important sights, the Elevador Lacerda. But the ultimate icon of the city is the Pelourinho, which is its historical centre: its churches and colourful colonial buildings have been a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. Besides being a historical gem and the birthplace of several of Brazil's most significant artists, the capital of the state of Bahia has also grown and developed to become one of the economic centres in the northeast and the country's third-most populous city, with roughly three million residents.

Host Cities Salvador 200 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL™ – MEDIA GUIDE Football It comes as a surprise to no-one after an edition of the Campeonato Brasileiro when the figures show that a team from Salvador – either Esporte Clube Bahia or Esporte Clube Vitória – topped the attendance average charts. The soteropo- litanos are as mad about football as anyone else in Brazil. The two rivals comfortably dominate the football scene within the state of Bahia, and have an important national background as well: Bahia, the Tricolor, won the Campeonato Brasileiro in 1988 and the Taca Brasil in 1959 (a predecessor of the national championships), while Vitória have collected three North-east Cup titles and were runners-up in the Brasileiro in 1993. The Leão are also famous for housing one of the best youth academies in the country, having produced the likes of FIFA World Cup™ champions Bebeto and Dida. One of the most fantastic moments for one to be in Salvador – only comparable to the city's vivacious Carnival celebrations – is during a Ba-Vi, the famous derby between the two rivals. While Vitória owns the Barradão and EC Bahia plays its home matches at state-owned Pituaçu, the ultimate stage for big matches at the state of Bahia is the Fonte Nova. The former stadium was imploded and a brand new one was built upon the same ground to host the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup™.

SAL Host Cities Salvador 201 Arena Fonte Nova The first capital city in Brazil’s history, Salvador will welcome the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ with a new and already tested, purpose-built stadium with a capacity of more than 48,000. Officially known as the Estadio Octavio Mangabeira, the Fonte Nova was opened on 28 January 1951 and was the venue for many derbies between Esporte Clube Bahia and Esporte Clube Vitória. It was closed in November 2007 and subsequently demolished three years later. The stadium built in its place, the Arena Fonte Nova, is modelled on its predecessor and is covered by a lightweight, metal roof. A public-private joint venture, the complex will house a panoramic restaurant, museum of football, car parks, shops, hotels and a concert hall. Maintaining the proud tradition of the Fonte Nova, the new stadium will host four group matches at the FIFA World Cup™, three of them featuring top- seeded teams, as well as a Round-of-16 match and a quarter-final tie.

SAO Host Cities Sao Paulo 207 A Terra da Garoa – “The Land of Drizzle”, the affectionate nickname given to Sao Paulo due to its changeable and rainy climate, is the city that will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ opening match on 12 June. Photos: Brazilian Ministry of Sports The city was founded in 1554, attributed to groups of Jesuits roaming the country on a mission to catechise the indigenous peoples who inhabited the continent. As numerous settle- ments were created, clusters began to form, which today make up the biggest city in South America. One of the world's ten most-populous cities, and with a population of over 11 million people, Sao Paulo's allure is not confined to its status as the financial and commercial heart of Brazil. Capital city of an eponymous state, Sao Paulo offers the chance to rub shoulders with people from around 100 different ethnic backgrounds. This mixture resulted in a cosmopolitan, culturally rich metropolis. Sao Paulo offers a wide range of cultural programs to fit all budgets, and is known for its exquisite gastronomic scene of over 12,000 restaurants.\n\n123. Host Cities Sao Paulo 208 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL™ – MEDIA GUIDE Football Replicating the economic might of the city, Sao Paulo's football teams are among the top clubs in Brazilian football in terms of investment. This financial power, allied with tradition, are reflected in the results on the pitch. The “Iron Trio” – Corinthians, Palmeiras and Sao Paulo – have clinched 18 national titles and won the FIFA Club World Cup three times – 2005 (Sao Paulo), 2002 and 2012 (Corinthians). Aside from the Arena de Sao Paulo, which belongs to Corinthians and will host the opening match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, the city is also home to the Estadio do Morumbi, which has room for 72,000 fans and belongs to Sao Paulo football club, as well as Palmeiras' new stadium, which should be opened early in 2015 and has room for 43,000 spectators.
