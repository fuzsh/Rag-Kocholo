        "text": "Mark Lovell@ @LovellLowdownFeatured Columnist\n\nBrazil vs. Germany 2002 World Cup Final: Where Are They Now?\n\n0 of 35\n\nTHOMAS KIENZLE/Associated Press\n\nGermany battered Brazil 7-1 in their own backyard to win a place in the 2014 World Cup final.\n\nAmazingly for these footballing heavyweights with eight World Cup wins between them, the semi-final clash in Belo Horizonte was only the second occasion the two nations have met at the showcase tournament.\n\nBrazil won the first-ever meeting, 2-0 in the 2002 World Cup final, which featured a certain 24-year-old named Miroslav Klose, and the famous three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho.\n\nHere we recall the stars making the headlines on that momentous day in Yokohama and reveal where they are now.\n\nAll player statistics are correct as indicated on the fantastic Sambafoot Brazil database and the German Football Association website.\n\nBrazil Before\n\n1 of 35\n\nLUCA BRUNO/Associated Press\n\nBrazilians smile on the eve of the 2002 final.\n\nWell spotted! Yes, there are more than 11 men in this photo.\n\nMaybe that's why Brazil won?\n\nAnd After\n\n2 of 35\n\nAlex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nCelebrate good times!\n\nGermany Before\n\n3 of 35\n\nDavid Cannon/Getty Images\n\nGerman starting lineup from left to right, starting from the back row:\n\nDietmar Hamann, Miroslav Klose, Marco Bode, Christoph Metzelder, Thomas Linke, Jens Jeremies, Carsten Ramelow, Bernd Schneider, Torsten Frings, Oliver Kahn (captain), Oliver Neuville.\n\nAnd After...\n\n4 of 35\n\nShaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nGermany. Gutted.\n\nLuiz Felipe Scolari\n\n5 of 35\n\nAssociated Press\n\nFew can handle the pressure as well as the coach dubbed ''Big Phil.''\n\nScolari shocked Brazil in 2002 by leaving out the legend Romario from the final squad.\n\nRelying on the attacking talents of the three Rs (Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo), Scolari secured the Selecao's fifth World Cup title.\n\nThe 65-year-old coach was aiming to match Italy's Vittorio Pozzo (1934, 1938) as the only coach to win the World Cup twice.\n\nHowever, the 7-1 demolition by the Germans left the hosts' World Cup dream in tatters. It was the highest semi-final margin in the history of the competition.\n\nRudi Voller\n\n6 of 35\n\nELISE AMENDOLA/Associated Press\n\nVoller was a member of the legendary 1990 World Cup-winning side.\n\nHe was famous for his haircut that earned him the nickname “Tante Kathe” (Aunt Kathe). Tight-perm hairstyles were definitely the fashion back in the day.\n\nHis finest hour as Germany coach came as he guided an unfancied team all the way to the final in 2002.\n\nVoller is still a popular figure in the game today, serving Bayer Leverkusen (where he ended his playing career) in a whole host of capacities—currently as director of football.\n\nPierluigi Collina\n\n7 of 35\n\nQuite simply, the world's best referee.\n\nIt was only fitting that the 2002 final was refereed by revered Italian Pierluigi Collina.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, Collina was voted the world's best official by his peers.\n\nA charismatic figure with a crazy stare and distinctive bald head, Collina continues to be a popular and respected figure in the game today, despite retiring nearly 10 years ago.\n\nHe is head of referees at UEFA and is still widely sought after by companies wishing to plug their wares.\n\nCafu\n\n8 of 35\n\nAssociated Press\n\n147 caps, five goals\n\nCafu was a remarkable right-back and the only player to have appeared in three World Cup finals, winning two in 1994 and 2002.\n\nHe was handed the captaincy in 2002 after a freak injury to Emerson in training and thrived on the added responsibility as Brazil marched to the title.\n\nHe has a remarkable record of 16 wins in 20 games at the tournament. He is also the most capped Brazilian of all time with 147 appearances for the national side.\n\nHe retired in 2008 after an outstanding Serie A career with Roma and AC Milan. Cafu is currently a World Cup ambassador, and his foundation does excellent work all over the globe.\n\nRonaldo\n\n9 of 35\n\n105 games, 67 goals\n\n\"The Phenomenon\" is arguably the greatest finisher in the modern game. Check out the video for his trademark goal celebration with outstretched arms similar to the famous Christ the Redeemer statue in his native Rio de Janeiro. Who can also forget his famous buck-toothed smile?\n\nAt only 17, Ronaldo made the Brazilian squad that won in 1994. He did not play in the tournament, but gained valuable experience in the big-time.\n\nHe scored both goals as Brazil gunned down Germany in the final of 2002 and won the Golden Boot award as top goalscorer with eight goals. This made up for the bitter disappointment of 1998, when a clearly unfit Ronaldo was a shadow of his normal self against France in the final. It was later revealed that Ronaldo had suffered convulsions on the eve of the match in Paris.\n\nDuring the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo became the highest goalscorer in World Cup history with 15 goals, surpassing Gerd Mueller's record of 14 for West Germany.\n\nRonaldo racked up the goals all over Europe from 1994 to 2008. He started his adventure with PSV Eindhoven in Holland, played in Italy for both AC and Inter Milan, and also appeared for both the Spanish giants, Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\nThe striker had battled manfully against a whole host of potentially career-ending injuries throughout his career. He finally called it a day in 2011 while at his final club Corinthians back in his homeland.\n\nRonaldo cuts a bit of a roly-poly figure these days and looks to be very much enjoying his retirement.\n\nAnd why shouldn't he?\n\nAfter all, he is one of the most famous footballers on the planet, is a World Cup ambassador and does splendid charity work. He also has numerous sponsors to satisfy and co-owns a sports marketing company.\n\nRivaldo\n\n10 of 35\n\n79 caps, 35 goals\n\nA vibrant forward with a very potent left foot, Rivaldo was rampant in the 2002 final.\n\nGerman keeper Kahn could not hold his fierce shot on 67 minutes, and Ronaldo was on hand to tap in the rebound to put Brazil ahead. The game was closed out after a casual Rivaldo dummy allowed Ronaldo to double the lead 12 minutes later.\n\nHe damaged his reputation for fair play at the 2002 tournament, after getting a Turkish player, Hakan Unsal, sent off. Rivaldo fell theatrically to the ground clutching his face, when the ball had merely hit him on the thigh.\n\nHe spent five years at Barcelona, forging a successful partnership with Patrick Kluivert, winning the league twice in 1998 and 1999. He also won the Champions League with AC Milan in 2003.\n\nHe enjoyed four years in Greece for AEK Athens and Olympiacos. In latter years, Rivaldo appeared to chase the money a little, appearing in Uzbekistan for Bunyodkor from 2008 to 2010.\n\nIt was only in March of this year that Rivaldo, aged 41, announced his retirement. He is now President of Mogi Mirim Esporte Clube in Brazil. His son, Rivaldinho, plays for the side.\n\nRonaldinho\n\n11 of 35\n\n101 caps, 36 goals\n\nArguably one of the most skilful players of his generation, Ronaldinho Gaucho became famous for his no-look passes and outstanding trickery. He was another Brazilian star with a goofy smile, who also looked like he was enjoying his football.\n\nHe dashed England's World Cup hopes in the 2002 quarter-finals with a fluke goal from 40 yards, that flew in over the head of stranded keeper David Seaman.\n\nRonaldinho won his 100th cap against England at Wembley in 2013 and still harboured hopes of making the World Cup the following year.\n\nHowever, the 34-year-old's hopes were dashed by coach Scolari, in similar fashion to 2002 when Big Phil left out Romario from the squad.\n\nIn Europe, he won the Champions League in 2006 in Barcelona and also had bright spells at PSG and AC Milan.\n\nHe is seeing out his career with Atletico Mineiro after returning to Brazil to initially play for Flamengo in 2010. Ronaldinho will be watching the game on Tuesday wondering perhaps what might have been.\n\nRoberto Carlos\n\n12 of 35\n\n134 caps, 11 goals\n\nOnce considered the world's best left-back, Roberto Carlos, at least to this neutral observer, always looked like he was enjoying his football.\n\nHe was nicknamed el hombre bala (\"the bullet man\") in reference to his fearsome free-kicks, which were regularly measured at over 100mph.\n\nRoberto Carlos started his Selecao career back in 1992 and played in three successive World Cups from 1998. He was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team in 1998 and 2002.\n\nHe spent 11 largely successful seasons at Real Madrid from 1996, playing 584 matches in all competitions, scoring 71 goals. At Real he won Spain's La Liga on four occasions and three Champions League titles.\n\nCarlos is currently coach of Sivasspor in Turkey, after initially cutting his teeth in management with big-spending Russian side Anschi Machatschkala.\n\nMarcos\n\n13 of 35\n\n29 caps\n\nMarcos was the steady, ever-present goalkeeper in Brazil’s last World Cup triumph.\n\nHe is pretty unique in the modern game, a one-club man, playing the entirety of his 19-year professional career with Palmeiras in Brazil.\n\nMarcos retired in 2012 at the age of 38 after a distinguished career, also winning the Copa Libertadores in 1999 and the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\nMarcos has been an ambassador for Palmeiras since hanging up his gloves.\n\nLucio\n\n14 of 35\n\nTHOMAS KIENZLE/Associated Press\n\n106 caps, four goals\n\nLucio played in all 630 minutes of the tournament for Brazil and was the proverbial rock at the back for Scolari's side.\n\nThe 36-year-old defender enjoyed a celebrated career in the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich and enjoyed Champions League success with Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan in 2010.\n\nLucio is seeing out his career back in his homeland for Palmeiras. Last year, he turned out for Sao Paulo and started his way in the game with Internacional.\n\nGilberto Silva\n\n15 of 35\n\nGary M. Prior/Getty Images\n\n99 caps, three goals\n\nGilberto Silva was arguably one of the best defensive midfielders in the game after the turn of the century. In the words of Veja magazine, Gilberto \"carried the piano for Ronaldo and Rivaldo to play their tunes on.\"\n\nHe scored all his three goals for Brazil in his first four games but didn’t score again in the next eight years and 95 games. Gilberto also represented his country at the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.\n\nAt Arsenal, he became an \"Invincible\" as an integral part of the undefeated Gunners' 2003-04 title-winning procession. He also won two FA Cups with Arsene Wenger's side.\n\nIn 2013, Gilberto returned to Atletico Mineiro, where he lifted the Libertadores Cup, the South American Champions League. Gilberto is currently doing TV work during the World Cup.\n\nEdmilson\n\n16 of 35\n\n43 caps, two goals\n\nA classy central defender, his only World Cup goal was a stunning overhead kick against Costa Rica en route to the final.\n\nHe won three league titles in a row in France with Lyon (2002-03 and 2003-04) and two more straight after moving to Spain with Barcelona. He also won the Champions League in 2006 with the Catalan club.\n\nEdmilson is heavily involved now with his own foundation, spreading the feel-good factor all over Brazil.\n\nRoque Junior\n\n17 of 35\n\nDavid Cannon/Getty Images\n\n49 caps, two goals\n\nRoque Junior played in all seven wins of the 2002 tournament and was a reliable defender in Scolari's side that lifted the trophy in Japan.\n\nHis greatest success in Brazilian club football came while at Palmeiras, with whom he won the 1999 Copa Libertadores.\n\nIn Europe, he enjoyed a less-than-distinguished spell with Leeds United in the Premier League, and he also played in the Bundesliga for Bayer Leverkusen and Duisburg and in Italy's Serie A for AC Milan.\n\nRoque Junior is now committed to helping Sao Jose Esporte Clube's youth players with a project called \"Project First Jersey\" and until recently was director of football at Clube Parana.\n\nKleberson\n\n18 of 35\n\nERALDO PERES/Associated Press\n\n34 caps, two goals\n\nManchester United fans may doubt this, but Kleberson is a World Cup winner and, according to coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, was the undoubted midfield driving force behind the victory.\n\nKleberson went closest to opening the scoring in the first half against Germany, firing against the crossbar with keeper Kahn stranded.\n\nOn the back of stunning performances at the 2002 World Cup finals, Sir Alex Ferguson took the plunge and signed the bustling midfielder for £6.5 million from Atletico Paranaense.\n\nKleberson endured a torrid time in England. He was injured in only his second outing for United and made only 20 appearances in two seasons.\n\nAfter a spell in Turkey with Besiktas, Kleberson went home to play for Flamengo and was recalled to the national team in 2009 after more than four years in the international wilderness. He also played in the 2010 World Cup against Chile.\n\nAfter a loan spell at Philadelphia Union in the MLS last year; Kleberson currently plays for Indy Eleven in the North American Soccer League.\n\nJuninho Paulista\n\n19 of 35\n\nStu Forster/Getty Images\n\n55 caps, seven goals\n\nJuninho Paulista came on as a late sub for Ronaldinho in the final with the game all but sewn up.\n\nThe tricky midfielder is much loved in England after two successful spells in the North East with Middlesbrough.\n\nDuring his professional career, he also played for Brazilian clubs Sao Paulo, Vasco da Gama, Palmeiras and CR Flamengo, as well as in Spain for Atletico Madrid, Celtic in Scotland and Sydney FC in Australia.\n\nJuninho now owns his hometown team and is President of Ituano; who earlier this year beat Santos to win the Sao Paulo state championship.\n\nHe is a pundit on Brazilian TV station Fox Sports and is also working for the BBC in England during the World Cup.\n\nDenilson\n\n20 of 35\n\nGary M. Prior/Getty Images\n\n63 caps, nine goals\n\nOnce the world's most expensive player when he signed for Real Betis in 1998, Denilson never quite fulfilled expectations.\n\nSouth American football expert Tim Vickery maintains that Denilson failed because “he believed all the hype about himself, thought that he was well on the way to being crowned the world’s best player, and when he saw that it wasn’t going to happen he lost momentum.”\n\nIn a 16-year professional career Denilson appeared in two World Cups for Brazil and saw out his playing time in exotic locations such as America, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn the 2002 World Cup, he was mainly used as a substitute, coming on for Ronaldo in the last-minute as the double goalscorer left the pitch to standing ovations.\n\nAfter retirement, Denílson has worked as a sports commentator for Rede Bandeirantes and on the TV show Jogo Aberto.\n\nOliver Kahn\n\n21 of 35\n\n86 caps, two own goals\n\nOliver Kahn was once undoubtedly the best keeper in the world—an intimidating monster of muscular authority who dominated opposition strikers as they bore down on his goal.\n\n\"The Titan\" was fiercely aggressive and had spectacular agility, which inspired a distinctly average German side all the way to the 2002 World Cup final, where, despite losing, he was the first-ever goalkeeper to win the Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.\n\nWe should turn a blind eye to his blunder, which allowed Ronaldo to fire Brazil ahead, as without \"King Kahn\" the Germans would have been on the plane home from Asia a fortnight earlier.\n\nToday, Kahn remains a popular German icon. He has has carved out a new career as a TV pundit and is a much sought-after advertising figure.\n\nMichael Ballack\n\n22 of 35\n\n98 caps, 42 goals\n\nMichael Ballack missed the 2002 final due to suspension in a cruel twist of fortune.\n\nThe German legend was in inspired form and scored in both the quarter- and semi-final wins but was robbed of the chance to play in the most important game of his career after being booked against South Korea.\n\nThe rules have since been changed as a result of the body blow for Ballack that prevented him from taking part in the showcase 2002 final. Ballack also missed the 2010 tournament due to injury and then had to say goodbye to the international arena.\n\nHe enjoyed a trophied club career with Bayern Munich and Chelsea in England. However, he never managed to win the Champions League or a team title with Germany.\n\nThe recently retired Ballack is very present in the media, and he is currently working for ESPN at the World Cup and is also a popular advertising figure.\n\nThomas Linke\n\n23 of 35\n\nGary M. Prior/Getty Images\n\n43 caps, one goal\n\nScored his only goal for Germany in the 8-0 demolition of Saudi Arabia at the 2002 World Cup.\n\nA tough, uncompromising defender, Linke scored the decisive spot-kick for Bayern Munich in the 2001 Champions League penalty shootout against Valencia.\n\nLinke is currently director of football at German second-division side Ingolstadt.\n\nOliver Neuville\n\n24 of 35\n\n69 caps, 10 goals\n\nOliver Neuville was actually born in Switzerland but elected to play for Germany, on account of his father's roots.\n\nNeuville went closest to scoring for Germany in the 2002 final, his rasping drive was tipped onto the post just before half-time by Brazil keeper Marcos.\n\nThe tricky attacker played for Hansa Rostock, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Monchengladbach and Arminia Bielefeld in Germany. He also starred for Servette in Switzerland and Tenerife in Spain.\n\nHe is currently a youth-team coach at former club Gladbach.\n\nTorsten Frings\n\n25 of 35\n\n79 caps, 10 goals\n\nTorsten Frings was an all-action combative midfielder with an eye for goal, who starred for Werder Bremen, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. He ended his playing career in Canada with Toronto FC.\n\nHe recently completed his coaching badges in Germany and is currently a co-trainer with Bremen reserves.\n\nJens Jeremies\n\n26 of 35\n\nAssociated Press\n\n55 caps, one goal\n\nThe gritty midfielder replaced the suspended Michael Ballack in the final to no avail.\n\nJens Jeremies played for both Munich sides: 1860 and their slightly more successful neighbours, Bayern.\n\nHe picked up a Champions League winners' medal in 2001 at Bayern, amassing a bountiful 16 titles during nine years of sterling service.\n\nUnfortunately, Jeremies had to retire at the age of 32 after persistent knee problems curtailed his career.\n\nToday, Jeremies works for a well-known sports marketing agency and runs his own charity.\n\nCarsten Ramelow\n\n27 of 35\n\n46 caps, three goals\n\nCarsten Ramelow made his breakthrough with Hertha Berlin's amateur side in the German capital during their amazing run to the German Cup final of 1993.\n\nHe was a solid, reliable defensive midfielder, who only managed to catch the eye with his distinctive blonde hair.\n\nRamelow played all his Bundesliga top-tier football for Bayer Leverkusen, scoring 22 times in 333 appearances. He finished second in the league on four occasions, including 2001-02, a season in which \"Neverkusen\" also lost in the German Cup and Champions League finals.\n\nTherefore, it was probably no real surprise that the trend of seconds continued with a runners-up medal in the World Cup final of 2002.\n\nRamelow now works for a ticketing and event marketing agency and has dipped his toes into the music industry as a singer to earn money for charity.\n\nBernd Schneider\n\n28 of 35\n\n81 caps, four goals\n\nBernd Schneider earned the nickname \"The White Brazilian\" for his dribbling and passing skills. He was definitely Germany’s most creative player in the 2002 final, but even he couldn’t break down the Brazilians.\n\nFormer Brazil and Leverkusen star Juan once said about Schneider, “he’s the only German footballer, who could play right away for the Selecao.”\n\nSchneider started out at his hometown club Carl Zeiss Jena and made a name for himself during his decade-long stint at Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nHe retired in 2009. He moved back home to Eastern Germany and acts as an advisor to his first club, Jena. He also scouts for Bayer Leverkusen and occasionally helps with kids coaching. He also posts some interesting musings on his website.\n\nDietmar Hamann\n\n29 of 35\n\nMarco Bode\n\n30 of 35\n\n40 caps, nine goals\n\nBode retired immediately after defeat in the 2002 final.\n\nHe was another member of the winning Euro 1996 side at Wembley, Germany's last major international title.\n\nBode scored the crucial opening goal in the group win that sealed progression at the 2002 World Cup.\n\nToday, Bode is a supervisory board member at his old club Werder Bremen. He is also involved with a sports marketing company and acts as a TV pundit when time allows.\n\nGerald Asamoah\n\n31 of 35\n\nMark Thompson/Getty Images\n\n43 caps, six goals\n\nBorn in Ghana, Asamoah and his family emigrated to Germany in 1990. Gerald became the first African-born player to play for Germany.\n\nAsamoah came on as a substitute with Germany chasing the game and played in two World Cups for his adopted country.\n\nHis most successful spell in the Bundesliga came with Schalke 04, making over 250 games over 11 years.\n\nAfter spells at St Pauli and Furth, He returned to the Gelsenkirchen club to help out with the reserves and also works in the PR department.\n\nHe runs a thriving charity for children with heart problems. It is a subject very much close to his heart, as he himself had a serious condition, which, thankfully, he overcame to pursue a successful playing career.\n\nChristian Ziege\n\n32 of 35\n\n72 caps, nine goals\n\nThe former Bayern Munich and AC Milan left-sided player was used as a late substitute in the final, but he could not turn the tide.\n\nHe was a member of the winning Euro 1996 side at Wembley, Germany's last major international title.\n\nZiege made over 70 appearances for Germany, spread over 11 years. He had a very potent left-footed shot and enjoyed a successful spell in the Premier League with Liverpool, Spurs and Middlesbrough.\n\nHe is currently coaching German third-division side SpVgg Unterhaching in the Munich suburbs, having also coached various youth national teams.\n\nChristoph Metzelder\n\n33 of 35\n\nGary M. Prior/Getty Images\n\n47 caps\n\nA Bundesliga winner in 2002 with Borussia Dortmund, Christoph Metzelder made his international breakthrough in Asia with some stoic performances at the back for Germany.\n\nIn 2007 he moved to Real Madrid where he spent three injury-riddled seasons.\n\nAfter moving back to Germany to play for Schalke, he decided to retire in 2013 at the age of only 32 after finally admitting defeat to the injuries.\n\nToday, he is very present in the media, doing punditry for Sky Germany, and talks very eloquently about German football. He also helps out with coaching his local amateur club in Haltern.\n\nOliver Bierhoff\n\n34 of 35\n\nTHOMAS KIENZLE/Associated Press\n\n70 caps, 37 goals\n\nBack in 2002, Bierhoff came on as a late substitute in the final but was unable to find a goal to worry the Brazilians.\n\nBierhoff enjoyed a successful career in Italy, with his best spells coming at the league's lesser lights of Ascoli and Udinese. He also won a title with AC Milan in 1998–99.\n\nHe played a pivotal role in Germany's last international tournament success in 1996.\n\nIn the Wembley final against the Czechs, Bierhoff scored the decisive golden goal in extra time, the first-ever in the history of the competition. Germany became European champions again, the first time as a unified country.\n\nToday, he is still very much involved with the German national team as manager. This is not a coaching role. Bierhoff handles media, PR and organisational responsibilities with aplomb.\n\nMiroslav Klose\n\n35 of 35\n\n136 caps, 71 goals\n\nMiroslav Klose is still going strong and was the only player remaining from the 2002 final who had the chance to again shape history in the 2014 semi-final.\n\nThe 36-year-old striker equalled Ronaldo’s World Cup scoring record of 15 goals with an equaliser against Ghana in the group stages.\n\nThat precious equaliser meant Klose matched his compatriot Uwe Seeler's and Brazilian legend Pele's feat of scoring at four different World Cups.\n\nHe is also one of only two players, along with Peru’s Teofilo Cubillas, to have scored at least five goals in two different World Cups, as well as the only player to have scored at least four goals in three different tournaments (2002, 2006 and 2010).\n\nRemarkably, Germany have never lost a game in which Klose has scored and is their all-time leading scorer, having hauled in the long-standing record previously held by the legendary “Bomber” Gerd Mueller.\n\nAnd the Hollywood ending duly arrived in Belo Horizonte as Klose scored his 16th World Cup goal in Germany's 7-1 demolition of the hosts.\n\nFollow Mark Lovell @LovellLowdown\n\nX"
