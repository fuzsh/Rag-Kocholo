Production of the special-edition DVD Jefferson sent was supervised by another São Paulo friend, Felipe Lindoso. Jefferson and his wife, Bia, and I would regularly see one another at the São Paulo home of the writer Edla van Steen, who introduced us and, like Jefferson but in a different way, was instrumental in my decision to write this book. In 2018 Jefferson and Bia introduced me to Sérgio Muniz, who is a mine of information about the Farkas Caravan in which he played a central role and whose documentaries I write about in chapter 4. The Universidade de São Paulo film historian Eduardo Morettin has been a touchstone for my questions about Brazilian history and documentary; his extensive writings on documentary along with his activities encouraging publication in the field are inspirational. São Paulo is also the home of the Cinemateca Brasileira, where I conducted research; there I received the generous support of Gabriela Sousa de Queiroz, head of the Center for Documentation, who called my attention to many invaluable resources for the book. In Rio I worked with the archive of Edgard Roquette-Pinto at the Academia Brasileira de Letras (Brazilian Academy of Letters). Cícero Sandroni greatly facilitated my research there, and I cherish my friendship with him and his wife, Laura. Knowing of my documentary interest, Ivelise Ferreira wrote from Rio of a seminar about contemporary Brazilian documentary to take place online; we both enrolled and as student-participants had many lively discussions about the films and interviews we saw in class, all of which kept our friendship close as the pandemic raged around us. I received two grants from Indiana University to support research at the Cinemateca Brasileira. At Indiana, the Moving Image Archive specialist Carmel Curtis provided invaluable help with the preparation of images for the book. ix\n\nx |\n\nacknowledgments\n\nFor several years I have had the good fortune to work with senior editor Jim Burr at the University of Texas Press. Jim has sound editorial judgment, and I am grateful for his advice and excellent sense of humor. My thanks to assistant editor Sarah McGavick and senior manuscript editor Lynne Ferguson for their work on this book. James Naremore has always encouraged me in my writing, and this book is no exception. There are no words to convey my deep appreciation for his enthusiasm about the project, his careful reading of chapters, his invaluable feedback, and most of all his loving support. The book is dedicated to him.\n\nA CENTURY OF\n\nBRAZILIAN DOCUMENTARY FILM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis book covers one hundred years of documentary film in Brazil, with films organized in roughly chronological order, often grouped according to their thematic concerns. Brazilian scholarship classifies documentaries as curtas (shorts up to thirty minutes), médias (mediums from thirty to sixty-nine minutes), and longas (feature-lengths over seventy minutes). Examples of all three appear in this book, although I have used the terms “shorts” and “feature-lengths” as descriptors. I discuss a wide variety of documentaries—anthropological, propagandistic, biographical, autobiographical, instructional, educational, state-sponsored, independent— without worrying too much about employing the term “documentary” to cover them all, but I trust readers will accept my use of it. Any commentary on documentary films, whether from Brazil or elsewhere, is haunted by the question of what counts as a documentary. We can all think of examples of such films, but like every generic category in cinema, “documentary” is a loose concept with members at its margins that make precise definition difficult or perhaps impossible. The range of works that could count as documentary include “observational,” fly-onthe-wall studies of people or institutions; extended talking-head interviews; “essay” films; and reenactments mixed with on-the-spot footage. Not all documentaries must contain original or archival photographic evidence; for example, it would be possible to make a documentary about the history of Brazilian cartoons consisting entirely of clips from animated pictures. The term “nonfiction film” is somewhat easier to manage, but it, too, is difficult to pin down exactly. From at least the time of Robert Flaherty’s Nanook of the North (1922) until now, documentary filmmakers have staged events, sometimes without revealing that fact, and their practice often raises questions about ethics or truth-telling. Orson Welles’s F for Fake (1973) is a nonfiction film with plenty of documentary footage, but its whole purpose is to trouble the distinction between truth and fakery by openly playing tricks on the audience. I hope to demonstrate both the art and social purpose of documentary, 1\n\n2 |\n\nintroduction\n\nand I believe a study of this kind has another value. Taken together, the films provide a way of discussing the larger history of Brazilian society, politics, and culture. In addition to celebrating certain achievements or individuals, they document the nation’s social problems and radical shifts between liberal-democratic and authoritarian governments. The earliest examples I discuss tend to be nationalistic and propagandistic, and as I show, several later examples were made during periods of heavy censorship or repression. But as technology began to give filmmakers greater flexibility, documentary became a powerful means of social protest, an alternative to the official accounts in mainstream media. In all such cases, I have tried to give readers the historical context for these protests, developing an implicit narrative that runs alongside them. The rich history of Brazilian cinema as a whole has been studied in English by numerous scholars, beginning with Randal Johnson and Robert Stam’s seminal volume Brazilian Cinema (1982, revised 1995) and more recently by Lisa Shaw and Stephanie Dennison’s Brazilian National Cinema (2007). These and other works, such as Lúcia Nagib’s edition The New Brazilian Cinema (2003), all include insightful discussions of documentary films within their larger focus on fiction films. David William Foster’s Latin American Documentary Filmmaking: Major Works (2013) and Vinícius Navarro and Juan Carlo Rodríguez’s edited volume New Documentaries in Latin America (2014) offer other Brazilian contributions to this growing cinematic field. Looking back in time, Luciana Martins’s Photography and Documentary Film in the Making of Modern Brazil (2014) focuses on the role of image-making in the country’s first four decades of the twentieth century, and Maite Conde’s Foundational Films: Early Cinema and Modernity in Brazil (2018) is required reading on silent cinema and film culture of the Belle Époque at the turn of the twentieth century. In his 2019 Documentary Filmmaking in Contemporary Brazil, Gustavo P. Furtado studies a broad range of films since 1985, when Brazil returned to democracy after twentyone years of dictatorship. Every film scholar owes a debt of gratitude to Julianne Burton Carvajal for her groundbreaking Cinema and Social Change in Latin America (1988) and for The Social Documentary in Latin America (1990), with essays on documentary by two of Brazil’s leading film critics, Jean-Claude Bernardet and Ismail Xavier. My study is indebted to these and many other important works. Public interest in films documenting the Brazilian reality dates to the end of the nineteenth century, before my history begins, with what were initially called “naturals.” Some of the oldest to appear, 1897–1898, feature fishermen, forts, and warships in Rio’s Guanabara Bay; a train’s arrival in\n\nintroduction |\n\n3\n\nPetrópolis, the summer home of royals and presidents; and a visit with President Prudente de Morais’s family in the Catete Palace.1 The last two were filmed by Afonso Segreto, son of Italian immigrants; along with his brother Paschoal, Afonso Segreto was a major figure in early Brazilian cinema. Paschoal opened the country’s first movie theater, the Salão de Novidades de Paris in Rio, then the nation’s capital. Afonso is credited with making Brazil’s first documentary, in 1896, composed of scenes of Rio he filmed from a ship entering Guanabara Bay.2 The Lumière cinematograph’s debut at the Teatro Lucinda on July 15, 1897, and at the Salão de Novidades a few days later was widely publicized and a cause for celebration; most titles were imported from Europe, especially Portugal, as local production geared up.3 The Teatro Lucinda program offered, among other things, sights of Portugal’s trains, boats, and seascapes and a segment on firemen from Oporto.4 Cinema operators often changed titles, announcing already exhibited films as new attractions to ensure income but leaving repeat customers often disenchanted with the sly switch. Documentaries from the Belle Époque (1898–1914) centered on topics common to those of other countries.5 Dignitaries’ visits, especially those of presidents and notable foreigners, were popular with audiences, who possibly for the first time saw their nation’s leaders up close and in motion. This was certainly the case of the moviegoing public outside Rio, where presidents resided until the construction of Brasília some fifty years later. President Afonso Pena was filmed visiting São Paulo in 1908; one year later, movie theaters were showing his funeral on screen. The oldest surviving documentary footage was also made in 1909. A film sponsored by the Automobile Club of Brazil, Circuito de São Gonçalo (São Gonçalo circuit),6 captures an enthusiastic crowd cheering drivers at the country’s second major automobile race held in Niterói.7 Footage of expeditions into the little-known interior were also popular. The short Rondônia (1912), filmed on location by the anthropologist Edgard Roquette-Pinto, was an ethnographic study of the remote Nhambiquara tribe. Theodore Roosevelt was often the subject of shorts commemorating his exploits in Brazil; celebrations in Rio over his visit there were the subject of the 1913 Festejos realizados no Rio de Janeiro em honra do ex-Presidente Theodoro Roosevelt (Festivities held in Rio de Janeiro in honor of former President Theodore Roosevelt). Shortly after that, cinemas were featuring Expedição Roosevelt ao Matto Grosso (1915, Roosevelt expedition to Mato Grosso), about his adventures in the interior. Brazil’s large German immigrant population no doubt delighted in seeing compatriots in Almoço no Kaiser oferecido ao Presidente da República e esposa (1914, Lunch on the Kaiser offered to the\n\n4 |\n\nintroduction\n\npresident of the Republic and his wife). Hermes da Fonseca was president during the German visit on the cusp of World War I. Publicity beckoned audiences to see “the salutes exchanged and the Brazilian and German squads in Rio de Janeiro’s bay.”8 Thousands of miles from the nation’s capital, footage was being shot of the jungle and river systems in the Amazon. As festas no Amazonas (1909, Festivities in the Amazon) was among the shorts shown at the cinema Recreio Amazonense in Brazil’s rubber capital, Manaus. Roaming Amazonian waterways with his 35 mm camera, the photographer-turnedcinematographer Silvino Santos spent three years, 1918–1920, filming the feature-length Amazonas, o maior rio do mundo (The Amazon, the largest river in the world). The story of that lost project, his follow-up prizewinning feature, and Santos’s long undervalued role as one of Brazil’s most important silent-film directors is where this book begins. Many of the films I discuss, among them the 1929 São Paulo “symphony” film, the government educational shorts begun in the mid-1930s, and the 1950s Vera Cruz Companhia Cinematográfica’s documentaries made during that studio’s short lifetime, fortunately were available at the Cinemateca Brasilieira in São Paulo. Were it not for that institution, with its excellent library, paper and film archives, preservation center, digitized catalogues, online resources, and dedicated specialist staff, this book and many others would not be possible. Of special importance is the rich trove of materials in its Banco de Conteúdos Culturais (Bank of Cultural Contents).9 As I write this introduction, however, the Cinemateca has only recently been opened by the government, which seized the keys in August 2020. On July 27, 2021, a fire in one of its shuttered warehouses destroyed three rooms of films and paper documents. Many online forums, petitions, and articles appeared insisting that the Cinemateca’s holdings, which are invaluable for study of the nation’s audiovisual history, be returned to the public and researchers. In 2020, as the COVID pandemic raged through Brazil and moviegoing shifted almost completely to cable, streaming networks, and other viewing platforms, a four-week online seminar was announced in Brazil on the topic of the contemporary Brazilian documentary. Curated and moderated by the filmmaker Bebeto Abrantes and critic Carlos Alberto Mattos, the twelve two-and-a-half-hour sessions included live interviews with directors and online access to one or more of their films, supported by bibliographic selections. Produced by Márcio Blanco, director of the nonprofit association Imaginário Digital, the subject and timing of the seminar, entitled Na Real_Virtual, was fortuitous for the present book as\n\nintroduction |\n\n5\n\nI began to write about twenty-first century documentary. Sold out prior to its July 20 opening with acclaimed director Maria Augusta Ramos’s O processo (2018, The Trial), a documentary about the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff, the seminar coincided with that year’s National Documentary Day, celebrated annually in Brazil on August 7. Established by the Association of Brazilian Documentarians, the date is an homage to Olney São Paulo (August 7, 1936-February 15,1978), whose short fiction film Manhã cinzenta (1969, Gray morning), about the arrest and torture of two protesters, resulted in his own arrest and torture in 1969 by the military dictatorship then in power. What the organizers of Na Real_Virtual were recognizing with the opening seminar and its equally successful Part II in November 2020 was the rise in production and scholarly and popular interest in documentaries. Historically relegated to private showings, film clubs, and film festival circuits, documentaries were capturing larger audiences with occasional theatrical releases such as Aurélio Michelis’s O cineasta da selva (1997, Filmmaker of the Jungle) and José Padilha and Felipe Lacerda’s Ônibus 174 (2002, Bus 174) and more importantly with television. Among the earliest programs devoted to documentary was journalist Nelson Hoineff’s Documento especial: Televisão verdade (Special document: Television truth), which first aired in 1989 on the Manchete network and continued on two other networks until 1998. Pay-TV channels like GNT began featuring documentary series such as Nelson Pereira dos Santos’s four-part Casa grande & senzala (2001, Masters and the Slaves), which he followed with Raízes do Brasil (2003, Roots of Brazil), a commercially released documentary on the historian Sérgio Buarque de Holanda and his classic study for which the film is named. What is known as the retomada (resurgence) of Brazilian cinema in 1995, with the international success of Carla Camurati’s historical satire Carlota Joaquina: Princesa do Brasil (Carlota Joaquina, Princess of Brazil) saw, in the following year, the first É Tudo Verdade (It’s All True) film festival, featuring twenty-nine works by Brazilian and international documentary filmmakers.10 Festival founder Amir Labaki’s prescient decision to use Orson Welles’s tongue-in-cheek title for the film that Welles was forced to abandon in Brazil served to call attention to the mix of objective and subjective, of truth and “fake” strategies that have characterized documentary from before the time of No país das amazonas in 1922. In the context of the pandemic, É Tudo Verdade held its twenty-sixth festival online in 2021 with a roster of seventy feature-length and short documentaries from twenty-four nations.\n\n6 |\n\nintroduction\n\nThe creation of DOCTV in 2003 in association with TV Cultura in São Paulo brought more regional works into the public television sector, supporting independent filmmaking with prizes and other financial incentives. It also enlisted some of Brazil’s major documentarians, including Eduardo Coutinho and Geraldo Sarno, to evaluate projects and advise on selections to be aired. In 2006 the government of Brazil launched DOCTV Ibero-América in collaboration with fourteen other countries to promote documentary production and distribution. Now called DOCTV América Latina, the documentaries made under its auspices also appear daily on the public network TV Brasil and online. The cable TV and online arts and culture channel Curta! is dedicated exclusively to documentary. In 2018 government edicts launched under the Ministry of Culture boosted financing for documentaries about Black and Indigenous peoples, childhood and youth, and subjects to commemorate Brazil’s bicentennial in 2022. However, the dismantling of that ministry by President Jair Bolsonaro on his first day in office in 2019 and his administration’s attacks on culture and the arts, including the closing of the Cinemateca Brasileira in 2020, do not bode well for government-funded projects unless they are economically beneficial to the Ministry of Tourism, which oversees the Special Secretariat of Culture, where the Audiovisual Department is located. At the same time, digitalization has made filmmaking of all kinds more affordable, while major festivals and online programs offering films below theater costs, along with platforms like Vimeo, Netflix, and revived cinema clubs, have increased viewing and distribution potential and revenue streams. The history of documentary is ongoing in Brazil, and the possibilities, as evidenced by the Na Real_Virtual seminars, are endless. I hope the following pages will indicate how significant its history has been.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Jungle and the City MODERNITY IN TWO 1920S DOCUMENTARIES\n\nTwo of the most important and, until recently, rarely seen works of Brazilian silent cinema are No país das amazonas (1922, In the country of the Amazons), directed by Silvino Santos, and São Paulo: A sinfonia da metrópole (1929, São Paulo: Symphony of the metropolis), directed by Adalberto Kemeny and Rodolfo Rex Lustig. The first is a travelogue-style documentary about the Amazon rainforest economy with occasional ethnographic sequences; the second is a city symphony in modernist montage about a day in the industrial capital. On the surface, the two films could not be more different. At bottom, however, each is designed to celebrate a modern nation of industry, commerce, and distinctive identity. Both laud the “order and progress,” the motto on the national flag, of a Brazil eager to proclaim its modernity. The films are also implicitly about migration within the country and from Europe that helped compensate for the loss of labor after the abolition of slavery in 1888. Both films were in fact made by immigrants.\n\nNo país das amazonas Viva Brazil! The pleasure is complete: neither an idiotic love story nor a dull farce, nothing, ultimately, of those imbecilic episodes that constitute the mediocre plot of moving pictures. Estado de São Paulo, July 27, 1923 The quote is from a review in the Estado de São Paulo newspaper in response to the feature-length documentary No país das amazonas, which was about to open in São Paulo after a three-month run in Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of Brazil. Featured at the government-sponsored Exposição 7\n\n8 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nInternacional do Centenário da Independência (International Exhibition for the Centenary of Independence), a world’s fair held from September 7, 1922, to July 24, 1923, the film attracted large, enthusiastic audiences and received a gold medal. US officials in attendance were so impressed by the film that they organized a special Amazons Day to screen it at the US pavilion.1 The São Paulo theatrical run also proved successful, with showings at the Teatro Avenida, where it opened on August 8, and at sixteen other locations around the city. From there the film traveled to northeastern and southern Brazil and later crossed the ocean to theaters in London and Lisbon and was shown in the United States.2 No país das Amazonas was nearly left out of the Rio exhibition despite agreement by officials that motion pictures were an ideal way to promote Brazil’s natural resources to the fair’s other thirteen nation-participants. To achieve this end, fair officials had selected items from extant films on the country’s history and regional economies; they also created guidelines for newly contracted works, paid for by the metric foot, to hype commodities such as coffee, sugar, and cotton. Not surprisingly, given the financial incentives, filmmakers often expended greater efforts on length than artistry. Unlike the films commissioned by the exhibition, No país das amazonas was a private initiative financed by Joaquim Gonçalves “J. G.” Araújo, a rubber baron and entrepreneur in Manaus who decided to make a documentary about Amazon commodities sold by his company domestically and abroad. Araújo found the exhibition a perfect venue for a film about the region’s economy that could be used as a stage for attracting new markets to his business. He hired Silvino Santos, who worked for his firm and had considerable experience photographing the Amazon, as the ideal director. Negotiations between Araújo and Rio officials began in 1921, as Santos was well into filming, but stumbling blocks soon appeared. Among the organizers’ chief concerns was that other filmmakers had been contracted for films about the Amazon region, and a feature documentary, a “natural” as it was called then, by an unknown director might not appeal to Rio audiences. Subsequent disagreement arose over film rights. Discussions continued off and on after the fair opened. Frustrated by the impasse, Agesilau de Araújo, J. G. Araújo’s son and Santos’s collaborator on the film, contacted Minister of Agriculture Miguel Calmon about the scope and significance of the project. Convinced of its appropriateness for the centennial, Calmon arranged a private showing for Artur Bernardes, the newly elected president of Brazil, and his ministers at the presidential palace.3 Bernardes’s praise was sufficient to end the stalemate, and No país\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 9\n\nMythical women warriors as publicity for No país das amazonas.\n\ndas amazonas debuted at the exhibition on March 22, 1923. The film’s enthusiastic critical and public reception proved that a documentary could succeed as box-office entertainment. Born to a middle-class family in Portugal in 1886, Silvino Santos left home for the Amazon when he was fourteen years old. In his unpublished memoir, he recounts that he was captivated by a story about the Amazon River in an illustrated magazine for high school students.4 With Portuguese relatives already relocated in the Amazon, he booked passage to Belém. His trip was part of a pattern of heavy migration from Portugal to Brazil, especially to the Amazon region, where fortunes were made during the rubber boom. The Portuguese Ferreira de Castro’s bestselling 1930 novel, A selva (The Jungle, 1935), is based on his own experiences as a young migrant who travels to Belém. J. G. Araújo also was among the thousands of Portuguese who migrated to the Amazon during the rubber boom and the much smaller number of them who made their fortunes. Unlike most export companies, Araújo’s business was diversified with commodities from\n\n10 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nSilvino Santos.\n\ndifferent regions, including tobacco, rubber, and nuts. Because his son Agesilau was interested in photography, Araújo invested in a laboratory for developing negatives and in the sale of imported film stock. Santos supervised the company’s film division, which operated until 1934, then moved to another part of the business. To complement the company’s film section, J. G. Araújo opened a separate shop called Manaus Arte that specialized in photographic and film equipment.5 Although unknown in Rio prior to the exhibition, Silvino Santos was a seasoned photographer and filmmaker who began his photographic career in Manaus in the final years of the rubber boom of 1879–1916. The harvesting of rubber transformed Manaus from a remote jungle capital into a modern metropolis and popular destination for international travelers. Among the city’s attractions was the Teatro Amazonas, where noted Italian opera companies regularly performed. One of Santos’s first large albeit controversial photographic commissions was from the Peruvian Consul Carlos Rey de Castro on behalf of the Peruvian Julio César Arana, a latifundista\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 11\n\nand head of the Peruvian Amazon Rubber Company. Complaints had been lodged against the company by Walter Hardenberg, an American engineer in Peru who accused Arana of killing Indians and enslaving thousands more in the Putamayo district to work as rubber tappers. The company’s executive board in London, where Arana arranged financing, was informed of the atrocities and sent a representative to Putamayo who confirmed Hardenberg’s account.6 To discredit the accusations, Arana employed Santos to travel to Putamayo and make still photographs of the Indians’ working and living conditions. Santos’s visual record from the period August to October 1912 survives. Perhaps not surprisingly, his photographs document a tranquil jungle environment, with shots of fraternal gatherings of rubber workers alongside company foremen, local politicians, and Arana. Numerous photographs focus on Indigenous families and their festivals that likely served as evidence that workers were free to practice their cultural traditions. The photographic record also includes portrait studies of individual Indians, who pose in traditional as well as European dress, the latter likely to demonstrate the company’s supposedly civilizing effect.7 Arana was convinced that a motion picture about the Putamayo workers was an even better way of combating adverse reports and publicity. In 1913 he sent Santos to study filmmaking for three months at PathéFrères and Lumière Brothers in Paris. In 1914 Santos returned to Peru to make his first feature documentary about the Putamayo communities and labor conditions. But World War I had begun, and the ship carrying the film negative to England for processing was destroyed at sea and the film lost. Santos’s interest in the Putamayo people nevertheless continued. In 1920 he completed his second feature, Amazonas, o maior rio do mundo (The Amazon, the largest river in the world), a three-year project that cut across the Amazon Basin beginning at the mouth of the river in Belém, the capital of the state of Pará, and ending in Peru. The Peru segment featured footage of festival performances by the Putamayo Indians, some of whom Santos had photographed years earlier. Although not lost at sea, the negative sent to London for processing was never to return.8 By the time Santos made No país das amazonas in 1922, he had directed sixteen feature-length and short documentaries. His films were mostly about the Amazon River and its tributaries, although several shorts focused specifically on Manaus. Like No país das amazonas, his early films were often sponsored by individual entrepreneurs; Amazônia Cine-Film, a company founded in 1918 by Amazon businessmen, financed Amazonas, o maior rio do mundo and other works. But after joining J. G. Araújo’s firm in 1920,\n\n12 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nSantos gained access to state-of-the-art equipment, including a Bell and Howell camera and a Duplex copier, and was able to develop his own negatives, beginning with the footage of No país das amazonas. By the end of his life, he had filmed most of the Amazon Basin in Brazil and parts of Peru. Of his approximately one hundred films, only forty survive today.9 A straightforward, impressively photographed, sometimes relatively artless film, No país das amazonas has lost none of the fascination and wonder it must have had for its original audience. We, of course, see it differently, aware of certain historical ironies. It gives striking evidence of an early form of Taylorized, assembly-line production that was still dependent on arduous, amazingly skillful manual labor, and it shows the remarkably wide range of goods the Amazon Basin made available to industry. It documents the strange flora and fauna of the jungle and provides images of the Indigenous populations, who are presented to the camera almost as museum exhibits. It demonstrates a burgeoning economy that gave employment to thousands but overlooks the dangers to the Native population and the ecological crisis that would inevitably result from modernity. The film celebrates nature and wildness while at the same time celebrating the forces that commodify and destroy nature. No país das amazonas is organized paratactically as a series of episodes devoted to various commodities: fish, latex, Brazil nuts, tobacco, cattle, and more. Each episode has a kind of plot, showing how a product is harvested, industrially developed, sometimes brought to a factory, and shipped domestically or abroad. The temporally organized sections on the industrial processes are interspersed with what might be called travelogue-style digressions, less time-bound sequences showing the rail and shipping infrastructure in the jungle, the architecture and urban population in the capital of Manaus, the local folklore, and the beauties and dangers of the jungle in its native state. Significantly, and perhaps not always consciously, the film juxtaposes two orders of time that are symptomatic of modernity: on one hand are sequences organized by the efficient clock time of industrial labor and the production of commodities; on the other hand are almost still shots or sequences that seem outside time, impervious to development or change, illustrating the surrounding jungle and its Native inhabitants. The result is a kind of catalogue of wonders, all the more intriguing for viewers today because it depicts what has long passed. The film opens with a series of title cards that describe the size and resources of Amazonas, a remote and little-known region that was still largely associated with myth and legend. In fact, the word “amazonas” in the film’s title refers not to the geographic area but to the Amazons,\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 13\n\nthe mythic women warriors of ancient times for whom the river and state were named. So compelling and pervasive were the tales surrounding these women that speculation about their existence carried into the nineteenth century. The Austrian naturalists Johann Baptist von Spix and Karl Friedrich Phillipp von Martius wrote about Brazil during that century; their descriptions of a New World of fantastic beings were often designed to engage readers, shock Old World sensibilities, and, one might add, boost sales. Santos and Araújo may have had a similar strategy in mind when titling their work and using a woodcut of naked Amazons on horseback to publicize it. The language of the film’s title cards, which were written by Agesilau Araújo, harks back to colonial times and the ufanista (hyperbolic) prose that extolled Brazil’s natural wealth. There are also titles modeled after a seventeenth-century nativista rhetoric that was used to tout Brazil in comparison with other countries, such as that Amazonas is an “enormous territorial expanse greatly superior to that of so many other countries.” New World writers employed ufanista and nativista rhetoric to convince Portuguese kings to invest in the bountiful land with its endless profit potential. King Manuel, who reigned from 1495 to 1521, and his successors did just that, and the returns were immense. Discovered in the late seventeenth century, Brazilian gold, along with silver and diamonds, bankrolled one of the most luxurious periods in the history of the Portuguese Empire and, indirectly, the industrial revolution in Britain. No país das amazonas employs similar rhetorical devices to attract new markets for goods handled by Araújo’s firm. Once it was approved for the exhibition, the film was perfectly placed to accomplish its aims. Following the introductory title cards, an iris-out appears featuring Manaus’s modern port facilities, also described in ufanista terms as a “center of great activity and progress.” Footage of river commerce segues into a title card commentary that despite eight hundred miles that separate Manaus from the mouth of the Amazon River, there are no obstacles to shipping goods; the large transatlantic British freighter Hildebrand is shown smoothly gliding from port into the Rio Negro. Santos also draws attention to the port’s large warehouses, long floating docks, and easy loading and unloading of passengers and products. From the port scenes the film broadens to showcase the Amazonian capital’s large public squares and such architectural landmarks as the Municipal Palace, St. Sebastian’s Cathedral, the Governor’s Palace, and the world-famous Teatro Amazonas opera house with its stained-glass dome. Inserted into this architectural tour is footage of the city’s main\n\n14 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\ncommercial thoroughfare. The street scene is not especially interesting, yet the camera lingers until a title card appears to inform viewers that the J. G. Araújo Company occupies buildings on the avenue. This is the first of several references to Araújo’s firm. In this way, Santos emphasizes the company’s importance by seamlessly featuring it alongside Manaus’s most influential institutions and landmarks. Transitions between scenes of the modern capital and the surrounding jungle take on a conventional travelogue rhetoric in which viewers are invited to board ship on a river journey into the rainforest. Most of what follows consists of stops along the Amazon River and its tributaries to observe the collection and processing of different products. Like entries in a textbook or encyclopedia, title cards appear at regular intervals to identify each product by name in Portuguese and Latin. A title card for the first stop informs viewers that the “Manatus Americanos” is one of largest inhabitants of the jungle’s lake system. Devoted largely to the manatee, also known as the sea cow, these scenes are both riveting and unsettling. Santos begins the segment with a disturbing shot of four dead manatees arranged in a row on their backs. Manatees are large, strange-looking mammals, like the fantastic sea creatures described in colonial works that were both captivating and frightening. A close-up of one of the manatees with closed eyes and armlike flippers crossed and resting on its body looks uncannily like a human laid to rest. Consumed as an alternative to fish, the meat of the manatee did not appeal to everyone because it resembled human flesh. Following these intriguing yet eerily grotesque images, the documentary turns into a primer of sorts on the skill and labor required to capture, kill, and process the mammals. Manatees are strong and agile; they can be as long as thirteen feet and weigh a ton. The film documents these characteristics by showing a harpooned manatee pulling a fisherman in a rowboat at waterskiing speed until the animal finally tires and gives up. A subsequent scene focuses on the rower’s struggle to haul the giant catch onboard. It is an amazing demonstration of human skill and strength, involving a manatee so large it barely fits in the boat. The film shifts to the shoreline filled with rows of dead manatees and pirarucús, a much-prized fish that can weigh more than two hundred pounds. The pirarucú is also fierce and resilient, as shown in a shot of a fisherman repeatedly clubbing one on its head to haul it onboard. Additional blows are meted out to kill the captured pirarucús as they wriggle on the shore. The documentary then proceeds to examine the different stages in processing the catch. These include gutting and trimming flesh from the\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 15\n\nA dead manatee in No país das amazonas.\n\nbone and a process called moquear, in which large filets are roasted over fire and then preserved in their own fat. During the cleanup, fishermen toss handfuls of discarded entrails into the lake. Here Santos turns his camera on a large group of crocodiles that expectantly huddle close to the shore. The footage includes dramatic close-ups of their powerful jaws and razor-sharp teeth as they furiously snap up and tear apart the treats. The film rarely comments on the workers’ origins, but many darkskinned laborers, as seen in the fishing sequence, were likely northeasterners or blood relations of the thousands who fled the drought-stricken Northeast and, like the Portuguese, migrated to the Amazon in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Northeasterners were prominent among the rubber tapper population, and they continued to migrate during the 1920s and long after. When work as tappers grew slack as demand for rubber declined, they turned to other local industries such as those associated with fish, Brazil nuts, tobacco, and cattle. No part of the film is a more compelling portrait of labor and efficiency than the segment on Brazil nuts, which documents the different stages of the product from the jungle to the city. Santos begins with shots of the tall trees where the nuts grow inside large, round, outer shells that hang from the limbs. Like the rhetoric in colonial texts, visual references to size are everywhere in the film. To give an idea of one nut tree’s circumference, Santos films five workers who extend their arms and join hands but can encircle only a portion of the massive trunk. Although danger in the jungle is more commonly associated with wild animals and insects, a title card comments on the perils of collecting nuts, whose large shells must\n\n16 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nbe sufficiently mature to have dropped onto the ground. For a worker to approach a tree prior to maturation was to risk serious injury and possibly death from a plummeting, baseball-like shell. With large baskets strapped to their backs, workers use machetes to pierce the round shells, which they quickly toss over their shoulders into the baskets. Their speed and accuracy are dazzling, as is their dexterity in breaking open the shells and removing the clusters of nuts from inside. The film then follows other stages in the nuts’ preparation, including sorting and discarding unusable items and washing and loading the nuts into boats bound for a riverside warehouse. There Santos continues to focus on workers’ skill and swiftness of movement from one level of processing to another. In a primitive assembly line involving factorylike speed and repetition, workers shovel nuts into boxes, separate them by size, and weigh and empty the boxes into large containers. These are loaded onto freighters identified in a title card as North American and British, a nod to the international markets for Brazil nuts in “the most important centers of consumption.” Viewers learn that some export markets prefer Brazil nuts removed from their individual shells, and the film promptly segues to an Araújo factory in Manaus, where that process is carried out. Unlike workers deep in the jungle, those in the factory are women. Seated at tables arranged in long rows, they use a levered device to crack nutshells one by one to retrieve the meat. Santos holds the camera on a few workers who are charmingly conscious of being filmed. Everyone wears a cap and apron, and a few seem dressed up for the camera. Close-ups of the women’s faces, smiling whether genuinely or just for the camera, are designed to convey a congenial and pleasant work atmosphere. As in other segments, skill and efficiency are on display in the women’s rapid hand movements; one hand places a nut on a tiny metal plate, and the other pulls a lever for a rod to crack the shell. The fast pace of the repeated action is mesmerizing, as if humans had become machines. Tiny, precise movement of hands reinforce the common belief of factory organizers that women, unlike men, are naturally endowed with nimble fingers, ideal for detailed piecework. That age-old notion kept women in the most menial and tedious and lowest-paid factory jobs for decades. Speed is a primary objective of the assembly line, and rewards are based on the number of items processed. In the shelling factory, workers carry boxes with the results of their labor to supervisors, who weigh and note what each worker has produced. The film closely follows the women as they approach the scales in silent, orderly fashion, on the order of a solemn\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 17\n\nFactory workers shelling nuts in No país das amazonas.\n\npilgrimage to make an offering. This long sequence is followed by a brief jungle scene in which a little monkey repeatedly hits a Brazil nut with a rock and eventually cracks the shell. This is one of several instances in which the film’s attempt at a light touch creates an unwanted effect, at least for today’s viewers, who are unlikely to appreciate the comparison between a cute monkey hammering on a nut and scores of women performing hard, repetitive work. The nature scene ends as the monkey eats the nut, which is his reward, while the factory shots of smiling women suggest that the work is itself gratifying and rewarding. The section concludes with crowd shots of women contentedly walking home after a day in the shelling factory. Perhaps because of his experience with Arana and the Putamayos in Peru, Santos often appears to try to convince viewers that working conditions in the jungle and the city are humane. The section dedicated to tobacco cultivation and processing contains a fascinating scene in which women pack leaves into tight bundles as they sit in a circle on the ground. After a close-up of their rapid, nimble-fingered work, the camera pulls back to show them taking a coffee break. Tiny cups and saucers are carefully placed in their hands by other workers. Despite the dainty, tea party–style serving, the women remain seated on the ground, so that no time is lost in returning to their labor. There are also several references to the plentiful fish and game available to workers in the jungle. In one instance, the film moves from scenes of manual labor to shots of a successful boar hunt by workers followed by a recreational moment as they relax around a fire awaiting the roasting meat. In another scene, the menu is duck. Seemingly contented family life and camaraderie are other motifs. The section on the collection and processing\n\n18 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nof latex begins with a poignant domestic scene in front of a hut where a rubber tapper says goodbye to his wife and child before going to work in the jungle. This obviously staged moment evokes the stereotypic movie image of the suburban middle-class breadwinner who kisses his wife and baby at the door before heading to the office. In other scenes, workers pause in their labor to smile at one another and share a cigarette. Within and between sections dedicated to labor Santos inserts spellbinding close-ups of flora and fauna to showcase the rainforest’s beauty. Like a naturalist excited by his finds, he presents a close-up of the clusters of large orchids that grow on the same trees that are valued for their nuts; in an iris-out that simulates a cameo portrait, a young woman looks at the camera through a garland filled with guaraná berries. Although harmful to tobacco plants, small worms with bright-colored rings and a snail with trailing shell appear in close-ups of leaves, looking more like ornaments than pests. Other shots focus on an anteater as it weaves its way among rubber trees, otters as they crisscross a small waterfall, and a jaguar on a tree limb awaiting its prey. Captured in mid-journey, a sloth looks at the camera as it climbs a tree near a riverbank. The famous Amazon butterflies appear in close-up and in long-distance shots of a field where thousands of the insects flutter their wings like flower petals in the wind. In still other parts of the film Santos combines his naturalist’s eye with the interests of an ethnographer. One of the most impressive sequences is of the Parintintin, who are introduced in an intertitle as the strongest and most aggressive Indians in the Amazon. Santos sets up an expectation of fierce natives, but the footage documents a taciturn community of men, women, and children. Several men and boys, none of whom appears especially strong, line up to face the camera and then turn for a profile shot. Aside from feathered headdresses, they wear a bit of cloth around their hips, and long narrow tubes cover their genitals. In another shot the men and boys walk in a tight circle as if performing a dance or ritual, then in single file directly toward and past the camera. Although the scenes of labor are also staged in the film, the staged segment with the Parintintin males is particularly discomforting. Like the jungle flora and fauna, they are treated as exotic specimens and posed so that they can be examined from different angles. Scenes with the female community, although also staged, seem slightly less rigid. Photographed in their nakedness while lying in low-hanging hammocks, the women converse, eat, and nurse infants without acknowledging the camera. One woman stands up and turns her back to the camera to attend her hammock. The still photographs of the Putamayo community that Santos made\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 19\n\nAn iris shot portrait featuring guaraná berries in No país das amazonas.\n\nten years earlier are similar to his filming of the Parintintin, although the latter had yet to reckon with the impact of modernity. At the time Santos was making No país das amazonas, the Parintintin population numbered about four thousand. Following a second rubber boom during World War II and construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway in the 1970s, their numbers fell dramatically, to around one hundred fifty. The importance of Santos’s footage of the Parintintin lies partly in its archival documentation of a remote, little-known Indigenous people nearly extinguished by the very industrial development that Santos and his film promoted. In contrast to the Parintintin, indigenous women described in a title card simply as “civilized” are employed to shell the berrylike guaraná fruit from which the popular caffeinated beverage is made. Seated on the ground and dressed in western-style apparel, they perform the same repetitious, nimble-fingered labor carried out by women in the nut factory. The chief difference is that instead of a modern-style factory warehouse in the city, the guaraná shelling takes place in the jungle. The ostensibly uncivilized life of the Parintintin women seems almost idyllic when compared to the assembly-line efficiency of their urban counterparts. A more powerful scene suggests the degree to which modernity is transforming Indigenous rituals. Santos films young Indian women performing a dance described as one of the “solemn” traditions practiced by the community. The apparent point is to demonstrate that the arrival of modernity does not mean rituals are lost or suppressed. As per tradition, the women are naked except for large, intricate designs painted on their bodies. Santos features these artful patterns in a scene where the women are lined up next to one another facing the camera, similar to the staging\n\n20 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nMembers of the Parintintin tribe in No país das amazonas.\n\nof the Parintintin males. Unlike the Parintintin, however, these women are aware of their nakedness and glance at one another shyly and in slightly amused embarrassment. The degree to which supposed civilization has transformed one of the most traditional aspects of their culture is conveyed in the final shots of the solemn dance. Here, the formerly naked young women wear long, white frocks and dance in an energetic, playful ring-around-the-rosy. The frocks with their ruffled necklines evoke the long, white, ruffled shirts that European explorers made female Indians wear to cover their nudity. Given the centuries-old religious practice of converting Indigenous populations, the white frocks might possibly be baptism or communion apparel. Santos inserts footage of other Indigenous inhabitants who have yet to experience the full force of modernity. No indication is given of who they are or where they live, but, like the Parintintin, they are mostly naked; they stand and face the camera and turn to offer their profiles. The relation between wildlife and Indians is suggested by two portrait-like shots in the section devoted to latex. In the first, a smiling boy in traditional feathers and beads is photographed with a large parrot perched on his raised hand. In the second, a little monkey clings to the shoulder of a girl who happily holds an infant in her arms. No explanation is given for the white bandage strips that appear around this child’s eyes, strangely mirroring the monkey’s partially white visage. The monkey’s pat of the child’s head enhances the visual record of jungle kinship. These curiously compelling interludes appear in the midst a sequence on balata, a latex used in submarine and transmission cables. Santos focuses\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 21\n\non the skill and special climbing footwear needed to scale and score the extremely tall trees, releasing the latex. The scoring from top to bottom of the tree requires crisscross cuts in a highly uniform pattern, and the result is a tree trunk that has an artful resemblance to a pineapple. In a scene demonstrating daring agility, one worker scales swiftly up a tree to take a cigarette break with another, who is poised at the very top. A sequence follows showing how latex is processed into large sheets that are folded, packaged, and shipped to Manaus, where workers busily unload the product at a warehouse bearing the J. G. Araújo name. Although the Amazon waterways were the primary means of transporting goods in the region, not all parts of the river were navigable. No país das amazonas includes historic footage of the Madeira-Mamoré Railway, a cooperative project between Bolivia and Brazil that enabled Bolivian goods, especially rubber, to reach the Atlantic and overseas markets. The railway buoyed expectations for greater economic growth and was another indication of the industrial revolution’s arrival to the interior. Although the plan was conceived in the nineteenth century, construction did not begin until 1907 and took five years to complete. The railroad, 228 miles long, ran parallel to the Madeira and Mamoré Rivers, connecting Porto Velho, now the capital of Rondônia, with the town of Guajará-Mirim, near the Bolivian border. Inaugurated in 1912, it was dubbed “the Devil’s Railroad” because of the thousands who perished from disease and other causes during its construction. The cost of human life became even more tragic as demand for Amazon rubber declined in the late 1910s and the railway lost its primary purpose. Fewer markets meant less money to run and maintain the line, with most of the costs falling to Brazil. Márcio Souza’s historical novel Mad Maria (1980; Mad Maria, 1985) is about the folly of building the railroad; once the Trans-Amazonian Highway was constructed, giving Bolivia direct access to the Amazon River, the near-moribund railway was finally closed. Despite reduction in demand, latex remained a valuable commodity and continued to be transported by rail when Santos made his film. One scene shows the arrival of a locomotive and several cars in Porto Velho, where Araújo had a warehouse. Dramatic camerawork from the viewpoint of the last car of the fast-moving train shows the long line of track left behind. The scene epitomizes an idea of modernity that was associated with trains and velocity, yet it also invites the viewer to ponder the superhuman effort (not to mention lives) expended to open the narrow wilderness vein for the train to pass. Hovering high above the tracks on either side, the jungle\n\n22 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\npartly surrounds and funnels the train like an endless tunnel or channel open to the sky. While the film shows the rubber industry’s reliance on trees, it also shows that other industries thrived on what we now call deforestation. A busy Araújo sawmill is the destination for massive logs rolled by workers into the Amazon River and floated downstream. Mill workers at the river site jump from log to log as they prepare them for processing into planks. Santos includes shots of the towering pissaba palm, another Araújo export whose vegetable fiber is used to make ropes, brushes, and mats. No país das amazonas concludes with a lengthy segment on cattle ranching in the area around the Rio Branco, a tributary of the Rio Negro that splits and flows as far north as Guiana and Venezuela. Santos begins with an iris-out of early rising cowboys, followed by a second iris of a cattle drive across the plains to the farm corrals where they are branded. A title card accompanying scenes of cowboys lassoing rebellious steers compares their riding and roping skills to those of North American cowboys in the Far West. A bronco-busting scene is immediately followed by an amusing shot of a young boy riding toward the camera on a large, energetic sow. Anyone who has read Graciliano Ramos’s Vidas secas (1938; Barren Lives, 1965) or seen Nelson Pereira dos Santos’s 1963 film adaption will recall how the youngest son tries to emulate his bronco-busting father by riding a goat. Like the film’s other long segments on commodities, close-ups of nature occasionally appear amid the cowboy scenes. Santos pauses to consider the beauty and size of the Victoria water lilies, named for Queen Victoria. Other recurring motifs are the plentiful foodstuffs and recreation available to workers. As elsewhere, there are hyperbolic descriptions of the quantity of fish and deer. Deer are so bountiful that five have just been killed in two hours before the scene was shot. Herons are also plentiful, hunted not as food but for their feathers, which are prized by “men and women imbued with an equally inhumane and ambitious instinct.” Shots of fishing and swimming depict some of the leisure activities enjoyed by the cowhands. It is impossible today to view scenes of logging and cattle ranching without considering their impacts on the environment and ecology. As is well known, agribusiness in the Rio Branco region has greatly expanded grazing lands for cattle by slashing and burning the rainforest. Logging has decimated other parts of the Amazon, and violence has ensued, including assassinations to silence activists who protest the forest’s destruction. Of course none of this is evident in No país das amazonas. Only a few scenes of Indians and the skeletons of trees in a lake suggest the problematic effects\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 23\n\nof industrialization. The film ends with a title card that proclaims “Viva o Brasil!” I suspect that those who view this amazing documentary about modernity in the Amazon might be doubtful about the enthusiasm behind that exclamation.\n\nSão Paulo: A sinfonia da metrópole São Paulo! Commotion of my life . . . Mário de Andrade, Paulicéia desvairada, 1922 No; it is not a natural film: it is a poem. Guilherme de Almeida, Estado de São Paulo, May 23, 1929 While officials were preparing for the International Exhibition for the Centenary of Independence in Rio, where No país das amazonas would be shown, a group of writers, artists, and musicians in São Paulo, with the backing of the state and its governor Washington Luís, organized the Semana de Arte Moderna (Modern Art Week), a centennial celebration that opened on February 11, 1922, at the Teatro Municipal in São Paulo. Both events were highly nationalistic in character; the world’s fair touted Brazil’s natural wealth and economic modernity, while the Semana de Arte Moderna proclaimed the advent of Brazilian modernist literature and art. Although avant-garde and modernist works were in evidence prior to the week, 1922 is generally acknowledged as the start of Brazilian modernism.10 The art week program consisted of lectures on art and literature, musical and dance performances, an art exhibition, and poetry readings by a new generation of writers, among them the now canonical figures Mário de Andrade, Ronald de Carvalho, Oswald de Andrade, Menotti Del Picchia, and Guilherme de Almeida. Organizers considered the event a resounding success despite or possibly because of the tumultuous readings of combative and satiric verses on February 15 that elicited audience catcalls and boos. Mário de Andrade’s Paulicéia desvairada (1922; Hallucinated City, 1968), parts of which he read on stage at the Teatro Municipal, captured the defiant spirit of early Brazilian modernism with a brash, polemical tone and unsettling references to São Paulo as a “big mouth with a thousand teeth” and “three-cleft tongue oozing pus.” Like Guillerme Apollinaire’s Paris in “Zone,” Andrade’s images of the anthropomorphized city are often delirious; he also denounces self-satisfied city politicians, the “fat-flanked bourgeoisie,” and São Paulo’s cultural void, with “neither poetry nor joys.”\n\n24 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nIn Paulicéia, Andrade makes only a brief, nostalgic reference to a past film era, although he was intrigued with the possibilities of cinema, as seen in his novel Amar, verbo intransitivo (1927; To Love, Intransitive Verb, 2018). Unlike the Rio industrial exposition, the Semana de Arte Moderna did not include film in its program. The film historian and critic Ismail Xavier attributes this exclusion to the state of Brazilian filmmaking in 1922; he reports that it lacked “a modernist and Brazilian practice, which was demanded by the movement’s [Semana de Arte Moderna] platform.”11 Hollywood had so saturated the post–World War I film market that only eleven Brazilian feature films were released in 1922. Nine were documentaries, including two on the world’s fair, along with No país das amazonas; the fiction films were melodramas, one of which was an adaptation of the Brazilian writer Bernardo Guimarães’s classic novel A escrava Isaura (1875, The slave Isaura).12 In 1922 São Paulo was one of the country’s three most powerful states, alongside Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, and coffee exports accounted for 70 percent of São Paulo state’s income. With the abolition of slavery in 1888, thousands of immigrants came to work the São Paulo coffee fields, whose owners grew richer as the demand for coffee rose worldwide. In tandem with the ever-widening cultivation of coffee and increased migration to the countryside and the city came the rise of manufacturing in commodities for local consumption such as textiles as well as cement, bricks, and other construction materials. The historian Warren Dean has found that by 1920 São Paulo surpassed Rio de Janeiro as Brazil’s most important industrial center.13 Among Europeans to arrive in São Paulo was the Hungarian Rodolfo Rex Lustig (1901-1970), who was hired by Armando Pamplona, head of the newly established Independência Filme, to work on films for the 1922 Rio world’s fair.14 Pamplona owned Independência with José and Menotti Del Picchia, the latter a Semana de Arte Moderna participant with whom Pamplona shared an enthusiasm for the modernist idea of “making it new.” Lustig had considerable prior film experience. In 1918 he was a technician at Pathé in Budapest, where he collaborated on projects with his coworker and friend Adalberto Kemeny (1901–1969). Two years later, in 1920, he and Kemeny moved to Berlin, where they worked at UFA, the state-ofthe-art studio whose directors at the time included Ernst Lubitsch and F. W. Murnau.15 Lustig was the technical director at Independência in 1926 when Kemeny joined him in São Paulo. In 1928, when Pamplona decided to retire from filmmaking, they purchased Independência’s equipment and\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 25\n\nstarted their own firm, Rex Filme. In addition to newsreels and occasional pieces for the Brazilian Department of Agriculture, the pair spent their first year making a feature about a day in the life of the city. On September 6, 1929, their filmic tribute titled São Paulo: A sinfonia da metrópole (São Paulo: Symphony of the metropolis) opened auspiciously on the eve of Brazilian Independence Day at the Teatro Paramount in São Paulo.16 Distributed by Hollywood’s Paramount Studios, it played for close to two months locally as well as other screenings in Curitiba and Manaus. São Paulo audiences saw their neighborhoods, department stores, restaurants, parks, schools— and possibly themselves and their family members or acquaintances—on the movie screen. Two favorable reviews appeared immediately after the film’s release; one was in Cinearte, the popular Rio film weekly, and in his São Paulo newspaper column, “Cinematographos,” the poet Guilherme de Almeida praised its rhythmic poeticism. Kemeny and Lustig’s portrait of São Paulo has little in common with Mário de Andrade’s poetry in Paulicéia desvairada, which remains a literary touchstone. Both works are about modernity, but unlike Andrade, whose poems were skeptical of the city’s transformation and progress, Kemeny and Lustig exulted in São Paulo’s industrial development, as proclaimed in the ufanista-style rhetoric of the film’s many title cards. They made a flamboyantly patriotic work featuring a dramatic reenactment of the country’s independence, several flag-waving scenes, and exhortations that not just paulistas but all Brazilians take pride in the “greatness of this lofty metropolis.” Their documentary also flaunts its technical sophistication with passages of rhythmic montage and optical experiments typical of the European avant garde. One of its fascinations for today’s viewers is that it provides an invaluable and impressive visual record of São Paulo and its citizenry at the end of the 1920s. Alongside Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera, which also was released in 1929, São Paulo: A sinfonia da metrópole was the last of several city symphony films to appear in the 1920s. Brazilian film historians regularly point to Walter Ruttmann’s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis (1927) as the model for São Paulo, although Kemeny stated in a 1960s interview that he had no knowledge of the Berlin film at the time.17 Despite his claim, there seems little question of Berlin’s importance to São Paulo, ranging from the film’s title to its specific scenes and formal elements. Among the most obvious borrowings from Ruttmann are shots of department-store mechanical dolls in motion, a milk-bottling factory, a child running late into school, pedestrians’ legs and feet, and a spinning spiral optical. This last element became a symbol of modernist cinema, first seen in Marcel\n\n26 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nPoster of a modern city for São Paulo: A sinfonia da metrópole.\n\nDuchamp and Man Ray’s short film Anemic Cinema (1926). Ruttmann’s images of animals in the Berlin zoo are given an interesting twist in São Paulo, which focuses on animals pictured on tickets for the jogo do bicho lottery game. City-symphony films made prior to Berlin also seem to have been influential. Like Paul Strand’s short Manhatta (1921), São Paulo uses title cards to praise the city and the labor that went into its construction, while Berlin eschews title cards. Nearly equivalent scenes from the Brazilian-born Alberto Cavalcanti’s Paris film Rien que les heures (1926, Nothing but Time) also appear in São Paulo, including a public swimming-pool sequence, a montage of newspaper headlines, and a finale with the image of a turning globe. But aside from the modernist day-in-the-city organization of these films, there are significant differences among them. Artistic modernism had\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 27\n\nno single politics. Nothing but Time is a left-wing film about the déclassé and disenfranchised of Paris; Berlin is an almost apolitical symphony of metropolitan and cosmopolitan life; Man with a Movie Camera, which creates an artificial geography by combining scenes from different cities, is a celebration of the Soviet Union’s five-year plan of industrial and technical growth; and São Paulo is an exuberant homage to the cosmopolitan middle-class and the military. Berlin shows horses with feed bags and pushcarts commingling with streetcars and automobiles, but São Paulo focuses exclusively on modern forms of transport. While Manhatta and Berlin are poetic, lyrical films about the beauty of cities built by laborers, São Paulo celebrates order, progress, and the nation. All the city films of the 1920s make time their subject matter, using modern workdays as a chief formal element; the industrial assembly-line time of factories that we find in No país das amazonas is either absent or subordinated to the more irregular rhythms of the day in the city—its slow start and finish, its hubbub and speed as the streets fill, its moments of lassitude at lunchtime. One of the striking features of São Paulo, however, is the way it departs from the single-day rhythm to propagandize for modernity. In an essay on the film, the critic André P. Gatti makes the important point that São Paulo was an expensive endeavor for the fledging Rex Filme. Based on internal evidence, Gatti speculates that it had several financial backers ranging from local industry to the state plus its distributor, Paramount.18 The film may also have garnered support or at least approval from the former governor Washington Luís, who was now the country’s president. Gatti’s surmise about backers is convincing, especially considering the film’s footage on municipal and state initiatives such as a public dental clinic and a progressive prison system, which are among the few segments in the film to feature interior shots. Gatti also correctly points out that São Paulo lacks commentary on the city’s cultural traditions, art, and poetry, an absence that calls to mind Mário de Andrade’s complaint in Paulicéia desvairada of a city devoid of poetry and joys. On the other hand, São Paulo is a film that repeatedly flaunts its artistry at a formal level by using rhythmic montage, optical signifiers of modernist art, and specially designed title cards by João Quadros featuring modernist illustrations. At the start of the film, intertitles announce the city’s wee-hours’ silence and slow awakening. The first of these is written in cursive lettering accompanied by an artistic flourish; the second uses large block letters to emphasize the word “Desperta” (It awakens) in a futuristic design of concentric circles that open out onto the city. This last design anticipates other circular imagery such as wheels and dials, clock\n\n28 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\npieces and spirals that give the film momentum and a thematic motif. There are more than sixty title cards in the hour-long documentary, an unusually large number, and they have an integrally educational function, which may explain the decision to make them especially distinctive. But the illustrations may also have been a way to entertain viewers who were unable to read. São Paulo shows a metropolis whose history, monuments, institutions, and neighborhoods were unfamiliar to many in the large, predominantly Italian immigrant population and to some who had lived there for years. Title cards describe landmarks such as the glass-enclosed Luz train station designed by Charles Henry Driver, and the law school founded in 1827. The cards also announce the hour of the workday, giving the first part of the film an orderly progression. The lunch hour is introduced with the words “Syncope: Brains rest. Nerves asleep,” accompanied by a drawing of a plate of steaming food. In the lunch sequence, a montage of handwritten, illustrated, and playful restaurant signs promote daily specials such as bacalhau (cod) and “tripe cooked Portuguese style.” Here eateries of all kinds are shown, street stalls and storefronts for the working class and more formal dining for businessmen. There is even one whose sign reads, “Restaurant for Ladies.” Unlike other city-symphony films, São Paulo interrupts its narrative and its rhythmic montage on the workday, leaving images of the bustling metropolis behind for segments on medical achievements and statesponsored reforms. The first of these is a two-minute presentation on the Butantã Institute, a world-famous research center where lifesaving vaccines were made from the venom of insects and snakes. The close-ups of researchers handling reptiles and insects and extracting the venom have the same fascination as the scenes in No país das amazonas in which men wrestle with fish and mammals. This is not the first reference to public health in the film São Paulo; between earlier shots of the city’s Banco do Brasil and a kindergarten where all the children are white is a twentysecond inside look at a roomful of patients being attended at a free dental clinic administered by the School of Orthodontics. The Butantã segment is longer, more detailed, and without a hint of the metropolis outside; its wild-kingdom approach to the business of handling snakes is both engaging and educational. A six-minute segment that abandons the city-symphony approach focuses on the state penitentiary called the Regeneration Institute, whose motto over the entryway proclaims, “Here work, discipline, and kindness redeem the misdeed committed and redirect men toward social\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 29\n\nparticipation.” This remarkable episode, unusual because it suspends for so long the formal logic of a city documentary, shows the prison motto in action as inmates perform tasks normally assigned to professionals, such as fingerprinting newcomers and examining heads and hands for injuries. The prisoners are shown making shoes, brooms, and baskets for sale to help cover operating costs. Inmates are filmed in educational classes, receiving religious instruction, and enjoying family visits important to their rehabilitation. The prison is the only place in the film where more than one Black Brazilian appears.19 Considerable footage is devoted to prison discipline, which involves boot camp–style calisthenics and drilling. Militarism is especially evident in scenes of uniformed prisoners marching with flags to the drumbeat of a prison band. The prison section can be understood as an indirect paean to positivism, a nineteenth-century philosophy attributed to the Frenchman Auguste Comte that emphasized instrumental rationality and scientific or empirical study as opposed to metaphysics or religion. Embraced by the Brazilian military and the leadership that overthrew the monarchy in 1889, positivist “order and progress” became the motto for the new republic’s flag. In São Paulo, the prison is a microcosm of an orderly, self-disciplined society that manufactures goods and earns money. The prison’s motto and ethos reflect the positivist credo of “Love as principle, order as the basis, progress as the goal.” The whole segment promotes the state’s approach to reform, without comment on such issues as violence or recidivism. Although dealing with labor, it is a digression, like the Butantã segment, that seems more propaganda than symphony and is strangely at odds with the city sights photographed outside its walls. In this context, the idea of order and progress has obvious right-wing implications. São Paulo moves more explicitly in a political direction with title cards that proclaim, “And a strong race trains itself for the formation of an even stronger race” and “Today they swear allegiance to the Fatherland.” The intertitles appear after a segment that features Brazilians playing tennis, running races, diving, and racing horses. References to “athleticism” and “stronger race” lead into footage of soldiers standing at attention and giving an extended right-arm salute to vow allegiance to the flag; the right-arm salute was eventually used by Brazil’s schoolchildren. A title card completes the unfinished sentence in the previous intertitle, “tomorrow, in bursts of daring, [the stronger race] will be the heroic sentinels of its defense.” This language is consistent with opinions expressed in A Defesa Nacional, a newspaper founded in 1913 by young military officers who had been trained in Germany. The editors believed that a nation’s progress was\n\n30 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\ncontingent on the modernization of the military. The newspaper called for the buildup of “better sons” to counter the deleterious effects of slavery and bachelarismo, snobbism associated with educated but faint-hearted elites.20 It is impossible today not to draw connections between this ultranationalistic language and the extended-arm salute with the growth of nascent fascism in São Paulo, a development whose origins date back to Mussolini’s rise to power in 1922. Il Duce became a topic of interest and increased adulation in the pages of Fanfulla, Il Piccolo, and other Italian-language newspapers in São Paulo that promoted cultural and economic ties with the Italian fatherland.21 In 1923 the fascist organization Fascio Filippo Corridoni was founded in the city, offshoots of which appeared throughout the state and beyond. By the end of the decade, nationalistic ideals of a strong and homogeneous Brazil were commonplace, ideals that Lustig and Kemeny support in their film.22 The film even includes shots of both Fanfulla and Il Piccolo in a rapid montage of São Paulo newspapers. A lead article immediately under the Fanfulla banner head is titled “Fascismo.”23 The filmmakers portray the future “heroic sentinels” in a staged cavalry charge in which soldiers with drawn swords gallop on horseback through a field. There is no indication of an antagonist in this dramatic sequence, but the next segment criticizing antiprogressive behavior leaves little doubt. Interestingly, this short sequence features only women, who fail to observe the city’s rules, regulations, and march toward progress. In one scene, an old woman ignores a signal and tries to cross a busy street. In another, a woman jumps the line to pay for a streetcar ride and then discards the ticket on the ground. Thus, order and progress are associated with a masculine military and disorder with feminine behavior. It should be noted that while the Brazilian nineteenth-century educator Nísia Floresta Brasileira Augusta, who knew Comte in Paris and introduced him to others, was instrumental in positivism’s spread to Brazil, it was a philosophy that tended to regard women and other minorities as socially inferior. Intermittently throughout all this, São Paulo is filled with optical experiments that convey modernity and movement, most prominently the spinning spiral and various kaleidoscopic shots with rotating image fragments such as one of a trolley car. One of the most unusual experiments appears after a sequence on the jogo do bicho lottery game ends with numbers rotating over a spinning spiral to suggest a wheel of fortune. In the next segment, a giant, disembodied hand moves high across the cityscape and descends to deposit a coin in a beggar’s palm. A quasisurrealistic shot superimposes the giant hand on a panorama of cityscape in motion. After the modest\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 31\n\nAn optical experiment in São Paulo: A sinfonia da metrópole.\n\nThe “giving” hand in São Paulo: A sinfonia da metrópole.\n\ncharitable act of giving a coin to a beggar, the hand withdraws, moving back across the city. It next appears in a darkened limbo where it magically produces a pile of money on a table. An element of greed is suggested as the hand clenches over the bills and the pile grows. Across the table, two hands reach out and scoop up the cash, as if having won a wager. This sequence is one of only a few to acknowledge poverty, although the focus is on the hand that gives and not the one that receives. The giving hand and the hands that scoop up the money belong to well-dressed men in suits. The meaning of the sequence is unclear, but it appears to be a comment on chance, which serves some better than others. Or the hands might be understood as emblematic of those with means who publicly donate a coin and privately clutch at a fortune that can be lost should luck\n\n32 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nfavor another. Whatever the intent, the segment shows the circulation of money and its unequal distribution. At the time, Lustig and Kemeny were undoubtedly aware that the São Paulo economy was in trouble, with the fall of coffee sales in the spring of 1929, only months prior to their film’s release. There is nothing to suggest that the money sequence has anything to do with the looming world financial crisis that affected all sectors of society, from wealthy coffee planters to the proletariat. But the wheel of fortune was no longer spinning in São Paulo’s favor as coffee prices plunged, unemployment grew, and the state edged toward bankruptcy. Shots of street traffic, shops, and labor continue to appear, inserted between the sections about money, the prison system, the Butantã Institute, and the military. A visit to the Museu do Ipiranga segues into an unusual and rather static reenactment of Dom Pedro’s 1822 proclamation of Brazilian independence. A sort of tableau vivant, the scene is based on Pedro Américo’s late nineteenth-century painting titled Independência ou morte (Independence or death). The frequency and length of such scenes tend to sidetrack the film from its images of the workday schedule; only in the final minutes do the filmmakers regain focus on passing time in the city with images of long shadows, rush-hour traffic, crowded streetcars, a tolling bell, and a setting sun announcing the end of the workday. The intertitles’ ufanista rhetoric builds to a crescendo, with references to progress and São Paulo’s brilliant future “in the vanguard of the greatest centers of activity in the world.” Composed of three animated segments, the film’s finale is intriguing for today’s viewers to contemplate. A nighttime image shows aircraft flying over a skyscraper landscape, an image that conveys the forces of progress. Next, a spotlight flashes Hollywood-style into the darkened sky while a movie theater’s illuminated marquee appears in the background. This self-reflexive image seems to suggest that cinema, like other industries, has a role to play in the march toward progress; the airplane and skyscraper animation briefly reappears as if to ensure those connections are made. The last sequence consists of a title card and four dissolves to images that shift emphasis from São Paulo to the nation as a whole, a shift prefigured in the film’s initial intertitles, which were addressed to paulistas and all Brazilians. An intertitle heralds the coming of a “new Brazil, greater and more powerful” with the “most beautiful and most powerful of flags.” The country’s well-advanced march toward worldwide prominence is suggested in an iris shot of an hourglass with sands partially disbursed and that shot dissolving into a spinning globe. In another dissolve, the globe becomes the round, star-studded “order and progress” emblem that in turn dissolves\n\nThe Jungle and the City | 33\n\ninto a full-screen image of a briskly waving Brazilian flag. In a somewhat ironic twist on the themes of nationalism, industry, and future greatness, the word “FIM” (End) appears over another round emblem, the Paramount Studio logo encircled with many more stars. Paramount’s control over distribution may explain São Paulo’s limited domestic circulation and failure to be shown or commented upon abroad.24 It was a silent film in a period when sound was on the rise in Brazil, although the first successful sound film, Coisas nossas (Our things), a Hollywood-inspired musical by Columbia Records executive-turnedfilmmaker Wallace Downey, did not appear in Brazil until 1931. Lustig and Kemeny photographed and shot the Downey musical, an experience that undoubtedly led to their remake of São Paulo into the sound short São Paulo em vinte e quatro horas (1934, São Paulo in twenty-four hours), which was also distributed by Paramount.25 But the times were very different; the 1930 revolution replaced Júlio Prestes, the elected presidential candidate from São Paulo, with the gaúcho Getúlio Vargas, from Rio Grande do Sul; two years later, in 1932, the state of São Paulo launched a failed constitutional revolt against the provisional presidency of Vargas. Perhaps not surprisingly, patriotic scenes of flag-waving militancy, cavalry charges, and prison tributes, among others, were left on the cutting-room floor. Over the years, footage from São Paulo was used as stock imagery to show how the city looked in the late 1920s; meanwhile, No país das amazonas had completely disappeared from public view. The year 1997 was important for the revival of both. A restoration of São Paulo that year by the Cinemateca Brasileira gave the film new life at festivals, including Pordenone in 2016, and the film’s appearance on YouTube in 2015 has ensured broader public attention in Brazil and internationally. Also in 1997, the documentary filmmaker Aurélio Michiles included rare scenes from No país das amazonas in his film tribute to Silvino Santos, O cineasta da selva (Filmmaker of the Jungle). Two years later, the novelist Márcio Souza published his own homage in Silvino Santos: O cineasta do ciclo da borracha (Silvino Santos: Filmmaker of the rubber boom), in which every frame of the film was reproduced from a copy housed in the Cinemateca. In 2014 the city of Manaus brought out a special-edition DVD from materials in the Cinemateca, in other archives, and in private hands. Together, No país das amazonas and São Paulo: A sinfonia da metrópole now constitute extraordinary visual evidence of people and places as they looked one hundred years ago. Though focused on geographically distant and distinctive areas of the country, when placed side by side, the two films show, for better or worse, the growing impact of modernity on the nation as a whole.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nGovernment Educational Shorts, Bandit Footage, and Vera Cruz Documentaries Consequently, cinema will be the book of luminous images from which our coastal and rural populations will learn to love Brazil, adding confidence in the destinies of the Fatherland. Getúlio Vargas, June 25, 1934\n\nThe films that fall into these groups are documentaries made during the administrations of Getúlio Vargas, who presided over Brazil for nearly twenty years as provisional president (1930–1934), president (1934–1937), president-turned-dictator (1937–1945), and president (1951–1954). In the early 1930s Vargas invested in the production of hundreds of short educational documentaries and semidocumentaries with the aim of unifying the nation and bolstering pride in Brazil’s accomplishments, especially in the sciences and arts. The educational films, though ideological in general purpose, were free of political controversy, but all films in the period were subject to censorship. Once Vargas’s Estado Novo (New State) dictatorship was installed in 1937, films were more closely scrutinized for political content. One of the most notable cases of censorship involved the complete repression of film footage documenting a famous bandit couple, Lampião and Maria Bonita, who were folk heroes for many in the rural Northeast. What remains of that footage, titled Lampião, gives extraordinary evidence of legendary figures who have become part of the Brazilian imaginary. Vargas’s return to power as a democratically elected president in 1951 coincided with a period of rapid industrialization of São Paulo, leading to an increase in the number and variety of documentary films. As part of 35\n\n36 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nthe capital’s growth, the Hollywood-style Vera Cruz studio was built on the outskirts of the city. Vera Cruz produced eighteen features during its five years of operation (1949–1954), but it also made a series of excellent, little-studied documentary short subjects about national treasures and public events, including the building of Vera Cruz itself.\n\nInstituto Nacional de Cinema Educativo (National Institute of Educational Cinema) On April 4, 1932, Getúlio Vargas announced the creation of a national film censorship commission and at the same time voiced his support of educational film, which, in his words, represented “an instrument of unequaled advantage for public instruction and propaganda about the country, within and outside its borders.”1 At the urging of prominent educators who expressed concerns about the adverse impact of lowbrow comedies and morally suspect dramas, the commission was established in the Ministério da Educação e Saúde Pública (Ministry of Education and Public Health).2 In addition to acting as a censorship agency, the commission was charged with identifying films with educational value, in the words of the government decree, “films whose intended objective is disseminating scientific knowledge as well as those whose musical or figurative plot is developed with artistic aims, tending to display the grand aspects of nature or culture to the public.”3 The decree also mandated a tax to support educational films and the showing of one educational short before every commercial feature.4 Perhaps most importantly for educators, the decree moved film censorship out of the hands of municipal police and into the hands of a five-member board in Rio, with one representative each from the Office of the Chief of Police and the Juvenile Court, a professor selected by the Ministry of Education and Public Health, a female educator chosen by the Associação Brasileira de Educação (Brazilian Educational Association), and the director of the Museu Nacional (National Museum). The museum director at the time was Edgard Roquette-Pinto (1884–1954), an anthropologist, radio broadcasting pioneer, and founder of the museum’s pedagogical division, which produced educational shorts about its natural history collections.5 Vargas understood the propaganda potential of educational films and their power to instill a sense of unity and national pride in a geographically divided, culturally distinct, and mostly illiterate population. “Propaganda” was a term commonly used in Brazil to describe the dissemination of information; the less favorable connotation of the term, associated with\n\nGovernment Shorts, Bandit Footage, and Vera Cruz Documentaries | 37\n\ntotalitarian regimes and anathema to proponents of Western liberalism, emerged when strict control of information was implemented by the Vargas dictatorship. On July 10, 1934, just days before the promulgation of a new constitution and his election as president following his interim presidency, Vargas moved the national film censorship commission into the Ministério da Justiça e Negócios Interiores (Ministry of Justice and Internal Affairs). The move was unpopular with the educational elite and just one example of a tug-of-war that developed between the education and justice ministries over the control of mass culture.6 For Vargas, who was gradually consolidating his powers, turning to the right, and setting the stage for the Estado Novo, educational films meant those luminous images about a modern, progressive Brazil that would build popular confidence in the destinies of the Fatherland under his leadership.7 In March 1936, at the request of Gustavo Capanema, the newly appointed minister of education, Vargas approved the creation of INCE, the Instituto Nacional de Cinema Educativo, with Roquette-Pinto as its director.8 Roquette-Pinto immediately contracted Humberto Mauro (1897–1983), a highly respected silent and early sound filmmaker; Mauro worked at INCE from 1936 to 1964 and directed 357 of its 412 titles.9 Roquette-Pinto’s directorship was much shorter, from 1936 to 1947, coinciding with the period of the Estado Novo. It also overlapped with Vargas’s Departamento de Imprensa e Propaganda (DIP, Department of Press and Propaganda), perhaps inspired as early as 1934 by a similar German agency.10 From 1939 to 1945 the DIP censored all Brazilian media, produced propaganda newsreels, and reported directly to the president. The DIP’s most prominent pro-government newsreels, Cinejornal Brasil­ eiro, were a required part of every movie theater program. The DIP was also charged with encouraging educational filmmaking by offering prizes and other incentives.11 In the mid-1930s Roquette-Pinto commented favorably on Germany’s decision to create separate entities for educational film production and propaganda.12 Recognizing the propaganda value of educational films, Lourival Fontes, head of the DIP (1939–1942), tried to bring INCE under his control. Roquette-Pinto resisted, and the institute remained in the newly renamed Ministry of Education and Health until 1966, when it was transferred to the Instituto Nacional de Cinema (National Institute of Cinema) until it was closed in 1969. The Vargas government’s broad 1932 definition of what constituted an educational film carried over to INCE, which made shorts about a wide range of documentary and semidocumentary subjects including science and technology, public health, history, literature and the arts, public figures,\n\n38 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nHumberto Mauro (left) filming in the Minas Gerais interior.\n\nand commemorative events. INCE was a modest operation in many ways but a vertically integrated enterprise that controlled everything from the development of scripts to nontheatrical film distribution. In addition to a lab and film studio, the institute had book and film libraries and a projection room. Most movies were shot in 16 mm and shown in schools and other nontheatrical locations. Until 1949 most were silent, accompanied by recordings or scripts to be read during exhibition. Not all schools had 16 mm projectors, and often those were lent by INCE; film lengths varied, but works tended to be under fifteen minutes. Several of the 16 mm silent films were remade into longer, better-quality, 35 mm sound films in color that showed theatrically with DIP approval. A good example is Um apólogo—Machado de Assis: 1839–1939 (An apologue), a two-part film about the distinguished author, directed by Mauro for the centennial of Machado’s birth. In the first part Roquette-Pinto, as narrator, discusses Machado’s life in Rio; here scenes of a poor hillside community where Machado grew up contrast with images of the prestigious Academia Brasileira de Letras, which Machado established in 1897 and presided over. Mauro focuses on the statue of Machado outside the academy as well as several of his many possessions on display, including his eyeglasses and handwritten manuscripts. Roquette-Pinto comments briefly on Machado’s most famous novels, and the books’ covers appear alongside illustrations by Santa Rosa, one of Brazil’s foremost artists. The film’s second part is a dramatization of Machado’s famous short story “Um apólogo,” an allegorical tale about human vanity, introduced on screen by the literary critic and Machado scholar Lúcia Miguel-Pereira. The story, narrated in the third person by a man speaking to an unidentified interlocutor, takes the form of conversations between actors playing the\n\nGovernment Shorts, Bandit Footage, and Vera Cruz Documentaries | 39\n\nroles of a needle and a spool of thread in a sewing box where they debate one another’s importance in the preparation of a ball gown by a seamstress; the thread prevails by becoming part of the dress, while the needle is returned to the sewing box. As the tale nears conclusion, Machado adds a new character, a straight pin, who admonishes the needle for having opened the way for the vain thread to become part of the garment. The fable ends as the interlocutor, “a professor of melancholy,” admits to his narrator friend, “I also have served as a needle for much ordinary thread!”13 The seven-minute black-and-white version of this film was among the first INCE productions to appear in 1936; the fifteen-minute 1939 color version is more charming and amusing, with the actors dressed as the needle, thread, and pin inside a set designed as a sewing box. Outside the box is the room where the seamstress works on the gown. Following the thread’s success and the pin’s admonition to the needle, the scene cuts to a shot of the despondent needle, now back in the sewing box. The film ends with the reappearance of Miguel-Pereira, who reads the melancholy professor’s sad admission. Like Um apólogo, commercially distributed INCE films tended to focus on national figures, among them the composers Henrique Oswald and Carlos Gomes, aviator Santos Dumont, medical pioneer Oswaldo Cruz, and writers Vicente de Carvalho and Euclides da Cunha.14 Films about natural wonders such as the giant Amazonian water lily in Vitória régia (1937) and national holidays in Dia da pátria (1937, Day of the fatherland) also played in theaters. But after 1939, INCE films about national icons and newsworthy or patriotic events became the purview of the DIP’s Cinejornal Brasileiro newsreels that were required showings in movie theaters. Among the many subjects filmed by Mauro during Roquette-Pinto’s administration, none were more interesting and significant than those about public health and the treatment of disease. Along with poverty and illiteracy, disease was a constant obstacle to the stronger national body that Vargas sought to build. Roquette-Pinto, who was especially drawn to the sciences, recruited eminent physicians including Carlos Chagas Filho and Evandro Chagas from the Fundação Carlos Chagas and Miguel Osório de Almeida from the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz for films about vaccines for rabies and yellow fever and about diseases such as leprosy and syphilis. Despite the films’ technical expertise and informative content, it is difficult to imagine them being shown to schoolchildren then or today. An example of a vaccine film is a two-part 1938 sound short by Mauro on yellow fever, Febre amarela I and Febre amarela II, made in conjunction with the Rockefeller Foundation and the laboratory at the Instituto Oswaldo\n\n40 |\n\na c e n t u r y o f b r a z i l i a n d o c u m e n ta r y f i l m\n\nCruz in Rio. Part 1 follows the preparation of the vaccine; first eggs are inoculated with the yellow fever virus and then incubated to allow an embryo to develop. Each egg is stamped with the inoculation date. There is no discussion of the disease or of how it is transmitted. Only the technician’s arms and hands appear in the frame. The step-by-step narration and illustration of the process shows a technician gently cracking the eggs and extracting the live chicken embryos from the shells. The bodies of the tiny creatures are slick from their eggshell home. Embryos that do not survive are discarded. The delicate process of embryo extraction takes an unexpected turn once the embryos are placed in a large, clear, glass receptacle. Without any sign of what is to come, the technician flips a switch and the embryos are suddenly whirled at high speed in the blenderlike vessel until they assume the consistency of a paste. It is a startling and unforgettable scene for the novitiate, largely because it is shown so matter-of-factly and exactly, without apparent concern for the squeamishness of viewers. The film then describes the steps to make the vaccine, which is distributed into glass ampoules for injections meant to protect human lives. It is not easy to forget that the basis for the precious vaccine is those tiny, soft-boned creatures summarily whipped into a purée. Part 2 shows clinical experiments with the virus and vaccine on rodents and monkeys. Unlike the living but immobile embryos, small white rats playfully scurry and tumble over one another in a box. The box lid is then closed, although viewers can still see their antics as they are slowly anesthetized by an infusion of ether. The next shot shows the yellow fever virus being injected into a rodent’s head. More discomforting than watching a needle penetrate the tiny skull is the demonstrat"
