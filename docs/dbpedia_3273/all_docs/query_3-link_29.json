Is it the players? Is it the fans and its stadium?\n\nWell, it's all of that...and some.\n\nAnd this is why we have compiled for you the 100 Greatest Football Clubs of All Time. We used the IFFHS's Club World Rankings from Dec. 1 2009-Nov. 29, 2010 to give you our list of 100 of the best teams out there. 100 examples of greatness.\n\nNow you might question where they stand in this table. You can approach this list in no particular order; we'll stick to how they are listed here. Regardless of whether or not they are out of order, they are still the 100 Greatest Football Clubs of All Time. So let's begin.\n\n100. Newell's Old Boys\n\n1 of 100\n\nClub Atlético Newell's Old Boys, known simply as Newell's Old Boys or Newell's, is a sports club from Rosario, Santa Fe Province, Argentina. The club was founded on November 3, 1903 and is named after Isaac Newell, one of the pioneers of Argentine football. Newell's is best known for their association football team, playing in the Argentine Primera División (top level of the Argentine league system).\n\nThey have won the Primera División five times throughout their history, the first being in the 1974 Metropolitano and the last in the 2004 Clausura.
