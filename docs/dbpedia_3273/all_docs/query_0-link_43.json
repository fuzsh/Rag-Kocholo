        "text": "Brazil has been widely mystified as the ‘football land’ since the late 1930s. This mythos has been central in the narratives about Brazilian identity. This paper addresses the historical origins and the social consequences of the ‘football land’ myth to the country, as well as the current state-of-the-art to this myth. Through the use of the rich Brazilian literature on football and society, combined with data from Brazilian mainstream and social media, this study attempts to resignify the meanings of emblematic moments in Brazilian football history such as the 1950 Maracanazo and the 2014 Mineirazo. The paper explores the causes of the contraction of the football land myth that once was so central to Brazilian identity but can no longer claim its supremacy over the whole country. As the country becomes a more sophisticated society, an increasing process on the fragmentation of the country’s identities is precipitated by turbulent social moments. The article acknowledges that football can still play a key role in the social transformation of public life in Brazil, but also that it is no longer a magical tool to mask or solve all societal problems. Football is now a social space where creative solutions for civic life challenges can emerge.\n\nThere are few studies on the historiography of Brazilian soccer. This article aimed at performing a necessary critical reflection about some of the most important works of soccer history in Brazil, not only in order to evaluate the state of art production on the theme, but also to stimulate methodological and conceptual reflections. We also sought to perceive how the memory pertaining Brazilian soccer was elaborated by those who wrote its histories.\n\nThe progressive commercialization of football in Brazil has been accompanied by the emergence of social movements that seek increased visibility and power over decision-making processes in the sport industrial complex. These groups are responding to rapid changes in the political economy of Brazilian sport, particularly football. While many of these processes were well underway before FIFA selected Brazil to host the 2014 World Cup in 2007, the event preparations are accelerating the trends toward corporatization, privatization, and mercantilization of football culture. In the years leading up to the 2014 World Cup, social movements have formed to respond to these changes in the political economy of football. This article will analyze the emergence and decline of the National Fans’ Association (Associação Nacional dos Torcedores, ANT) as an attempt from Brazilian civil society to insert more progressive social agendas into the rapidly neo-liberalizing framework of Brazilian sport. I contextualize this movement with the larger frames of fandom and fans’ rights, the role of activist academics within social movements more generally, and explore the successes and failures of the ANT. The conclusion suggests that even short-lived experiments in the formation of social movements are worthwhile as they can take future shapes and directions that can eventually bring about the desired change.\n\nThis essay offers a brief historical background to the evolution of women’s soccer in Brazil. It focuses on the main obstacles women faced to pursue the game, which was forbidden to women in Brazil in 1941. By analysing how the newspapers treat women’s teams, the essay will try to highlight significant changes in the stereotypes that long guided perceptions of people about women soccer players."
