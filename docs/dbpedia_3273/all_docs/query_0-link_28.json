        "text": "We investigated the impacts of president longevity and the geographic orientation of owners on team performance and on the effectiveness of dismissing the leader. In addition, we considered their impacts on the effectiveness of not dismissing the leader while the same organisation fires them at another time for a similar performance. We also tested the impact of dismissing the leader or not on performance. We explored the aforementioned risk-taking relationships in the first tier of French men’s football over the 1994–2016 period (n = 4918 observations). To do so, we used a counterfactual based on the evolution of the team position over the last three games leading to the leader change and estimate linear regression models with fixed team effects. Our findings show that performance improves either after a leader dismissal or not in the same situation, and both president longevity and the geographic orientation of owners impact the effectiveness of dismissing the leader or not. In pa...\n\nReserarch question: the paper investigates the influence of football clubs investments on their performancen the first division of the Brazilian league. Motivation: Considering football as the most important sport in Brazil, representing a cultural symbol of the country, understanding it better becomes necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the financial amounts involved in the management actions to try to understand the influence of the investments that the clubs make about the marketing and championships improvement and, thus, to be able to delineate the relation between investment and success in Football. Idea: In this perspective, the central hypothesis of this study is that the clubs that present the highest expenditures on soccer will also present the best classifications, since these expenses are related to better training conditions and salaries, which may contribute to the recruitment of the best athletes. Data: The study was conducted with data collected over...\n\nThe authors use sports data to study the effects of manager replacement on firm performance. Using match results of the major Italian soccer league (“Serie A”), the effects of coach (manager) changes on team performance are analyzed. To control for the “Ashenfelter dip” and to compare similar teams facing similar opponents two alternative econometric strategies are undertaken: the estimation of a number of team-season fixed effects models and the use of a matching estimator. From team-season fixed effects estimates, it emerges that changing the coach does not produce a positive effect on team performance, with the exception of the number of goals scored. Matching estimates confirm that changing the coach does not affect team performance neither when considering as dependent variable the number of points per match nor when looking at the number of goals scored or conceded.\n\nAfter the 1990’s, the changes in the football world had helped to develop and to grow the economy of football rapidly. The development of digital broadcasting led to build a bigger commercial structure. With the effect of those changes, commercial incomes, sponsor revenues, stadium and facilities incomes, and betting incomes have increased over time. This rapid change also brings several problems. UEFA has published UEFA criteria in order to protect football’s sustainability and viability in a long term. Depending on license criteria that is published by UEFA, it has used a road map for football clubs, regarding of corporate structure of UEFA to work, that identified the general rules like in a company structure and management that should be all the necessary factors of production in a systematic and effective way in order to transform football clubs to a corporate organization and make them sustainable. With this out of the common guide explains readers how to run a club in today’s...\n\nThe goals of this paper are first to identify why professional football clubs replace their head coach and, second, to investigate the effect of coach dismissal on team performance. To do that, we propose a new method for assessing the performance expectations of professional sport teams using Monte Carlo simulation. We apply our method to the English Premier league and the French Ligue 1 football teams over the 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 seasons. We find that coach dismissal is the result of a drop in the average expected performance compared with the performance expectations at the beginning of the season. We also show that dismissing a coach may enhance performance only if the team under-performed before the dismissal. There is no obstacle to using the same method for professional teams in other sports. The method is easily reproducible and does not require much information in order to be applied.\n\nIt may be assumed that Brazilian soccer clubs should broaden their horizons in terms of their economic and social maintenance through more effective commercial activities. This can be done through greater transparency of their strategic activities in terms of their relationships with partners such as investors, supporters, governments and the public. This study focuses on the following research question: how can the adoption of governance practices by the main soccer clubs in Brazil create new business relationships? The study analyzes the adoption of governance practices and the relationship with partners in 14 soccer clubs with the highest revenues in the country. The method was a multiple case study with a qualitative and quantitative analysis approach. The data were compiled in 5 dimensions with 48 indicators of the Brazilian Governance Institute. The description resulted in a suggestion for adapting the structure and practice of governance of soccer clubs through transparency, advice, norms and social actions as a framework for economic and social sustainability through better business relationships with direct and indirect partners.
