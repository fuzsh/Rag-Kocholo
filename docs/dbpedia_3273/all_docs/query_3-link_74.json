        "text": "Legendary full-back Dani Alves has been recalled to the Brazil international squad after an absence stretching back to October 2019.\n\nThe Selecao named their 24-man squad for next month’s World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay with Alves back in the fold.\n\nThe forward-thinking right-back has already been capped 118 times by his nation - more than any other active Brazilian player and only behind former full-backs Cafu (142 caps) and Roberto Carlos (125).\n\nThe latest call-up is an indication that Alves is also likely to be involved for Brazil in the upcoming Copa America tournament, where Tite’s side have been pitted against Venezuela, Peru and Colombia in the group stages - with that squad set to be named on 9 June.\n\nNow aged 38, Alves was inspirational in helping his nation land the previous Copa America title in 2019 - when he was named as Player of the Tournament - while he had also been the team’s captain in place of Neymar.\n\nBrazil boss Tite has said of the defender’s recall to the squad: “Alves is in a good moment and has a great history with the National Team.\n\n“In qualifying matches for the World Cup there is no time for recovery and he is playing at his physical peak.\n\n“He has great leadership skills and that's very good for the group.”\n\nAlves is hoping to now prolong his glittering career with the international side, for whom he has won four trophies - the last Copa America title was added to the 2007 version, while he has also played a crucial role in the Confederations Cup winning teams of 2009 and 2013.\n\nIndeed, the veteran has won more trophies throughout his professional career than any other current active player - winning a total of 41 tournaments at senior level over a 19-year period.\n\nHe won the Copa do Nordeste at Brazilian minnows Bahia before adding five trophies at Sevilla - including two UEFA Cup crowns and a Copa del Rey - before a glorious spell at Barcelona where he totalled 23 trophies, including six La Liga titles and three Champions League winning medals.\n\nAlves went on to win the domestic double at Juventus in 2016-17 before winning six trophies across two seasons at Paris Saint-Germain, whom he left in 2019 to return to Brazil to play for Sao Paulo.\n\nRegarded as one of the best full-backs of his generation, Alves in part redefined the position due to his natural attacking instincts - establishing himself as one of the greatest attacking threats on the pitch in spite of his position, scoring 74 career goals.\n\nKnown primarily for his pace, stamina, overlapping attacking runs, technical skills, crossing accuracy and work-rate, the Brazilian is one of the most well-rounded players of recent times.\n\nWhen leaving Barcelona in 2016, he had made more La Liga appearances than any other non-Spaniard ever and provided over 100 direct goal assists, more than any player over the same period apart from Lionel Messi. He provided more assists than Xavi Hernandez or Andres Iniesta, and all from right-back - an asset which was previously unheard of.\n\nThe Brazilian’s vision, technique and engine created a hybrid that played a large role in reinventing the role and expectation of what a right-back could be.\n\nAlves has even described his style of play as: “I play as a creative midfielder from the back.”\n\nIndeed, his move to Sao Paulo has seen him wear the number 10 shirt - typically reserved for playmakers - as an indicator of his style of play, while the team finished fourth last season (which ended in February) and just five points from being title winners.\n\nAlves initially spent most of his time under his first Sao Paulo boss Fernando Diniz as a playmaker or central midfielder, with former Atletico Madrid stalwart Juanfran instead occupying the right-back slot.\n\nDiniz was subsequently replaced in the dugout by legendary striker Hernan Crespo - formerly of Chelsea - who reinstated Alves to his more accustomed right-back slot, operating on that side of a five-man defence, with Juanfran having exited the club.\n\nAlves told an interview with The Guardian in April: “In Brazil, I need to be right-back because I was the best right-back in the world.\n\n“But if I return to right-back, they will say I’m old. But just look at the statistics. I am performing well. Whoever works with me knows what I can do.”\n\nCrespo believes that Alves was the best full-back in the world - and he had been for many years.\n\nHe told reporters, as quoted by Goal.com : “It will be hard to move Dani from the right, because he has been the best right-back in the world for a long time.\n\n“And he is confirming that week in, week out.”\n\nThe praise for Alves does not only come from the coach but from the player himself, who is not shy in describing his qualities.\n\nHe has said: “I’ll be sincere, I created a new way of playing as a full-back. No false modesty. I am always adapting to my teammates. If they’re wide, I’ll go into the middle. If they’re attacking, I’ll help with the control. If the ball’s on the other side, I tuck in. I play as a creative midfielder from the back. Barcelona gave me this understanding.”\n\nHis remarkable career shows no sign of slowing down - now back in the Brazilian national side and as influential as ever at club level, albeit in a league that is a level below the elite tier of European football.\n\nHowever, he is increasingly likely to feature in this summer’s Copa America and will probably be aiming for one final swansong at the next World Cup - the one trophy that has eluded him throughout his career.\n\nIt would be a fitting way to bow out at the top level and a send-off worthy of such a successful and era-defining career."
