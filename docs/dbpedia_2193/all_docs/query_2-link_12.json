        "text": "Welcome to the Wicked Wax Museum is the twelfth book in the Give Yourself Goosebumps gamebook series. It was published in 1996.\n\nThe cover illustration features Sybil Wicked in a museum. In the background, there are statues and head busts that are to the right of the window.\n\nBlurb[]\n\nTOO HOT TO HANDLE!!\n\nYour teacher thinks it'll be good for your class to hang out at the new wax museum in town. Yeah, right! Once you get there your teacher starts blah-blahing about something or other and that's when you and your friend see the red door.\n\nIf you decide to check out what's behind door #1, you'll discover the museum owner's secret for making lifelike sculptures. And it doesn't look like fun! If you decide to ditch the red door and go the other way you'll end up meeting scary Sybil Wicked — and wish you hadn't. Will you escape this creepy place before you're turned into a human candle?\n\nThe choice is yours in this scary GOOSEBUMPS adventure that's packed with over 20 super-spooky endings!\n\nPlot[]\n\nA history class is taking a trip to the Wicked Wax Museum the day before it opens. You and your friends, Jake and Liz, misbehave while on the bus. Then you are told by Mr. Dunning, the teacher, that you are not allowed inside. Eventually, Jake decides to go inside and soon starts screaming, providing you with the first choice in the book: whether to go in after him or to go find help. If you and Liz go after Jake, you find out the museum's secret of making their exhibits. Unfortunately, you and your friends may end up as the newest additions. If you go for help, the two of you will run into a mysterious man named Axel. He leads you to Sybil Wicked, since he's apparently working for her, and she is looking for a new face to replace her disfigured one, and she might get yours!\n\nList of endings[]\n\nThere are twenty bad endings and two good endings.\n\nBad endings[]\n\nGood endings[]\n\nPage map[]\n\nInternational releases[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Norwegian cover art doesn't seem to exist anywhere in digital format. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that, like the rest of the Grøssernes Mysterier collection, it uses the illustration of Mark Nagata.\n\nAdvertisement[]\n\nArtwork[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn an interview, Mark Nagata stated that this book's cover was one of his favorite covers in the series alongside Night in Werewolf Woods.\n\nThe phrase \"No bones about it\" in one of the endings was used in the previous book, Deep in the Jungle of Doom.[1]\n\nThis book's description of Sybil Wicked differs heavily from her depiction on the cover. While this book says she has a tuft of red hair above her forehead, a small blue eye, a larger brown eye, and a patchwork face made in various natural skin colors, the cover depicts her with black hair, blue eyes that are the same size, and purple skin.\n\nAccording to Mark Nagata, the cover design of Sybil Wicked was based on Vampira. [2]\n\nThe two main storylines of this book do not seem to be within continuity; Jake is serious in Izzy's story but is joking in Sybil's story. Hence, it is difficult to tell if Izzy and Sybil are aware of each other's plans, or if the plans are even occurring simultaneously.\n\nThis book involves a maze to decipher a message at one point and at another point you may even get a second chance at completing the book from the beginning.\n\nAlthough a hidden message exists within the maze, it is never called upon for you to prove you have deciphered it, or even mentioned again.\n\nThis is the second book in the series where you are given the chance to leave another character to their fate, but this is the first time where you can be punished for doing so.\n\nA similar scenario from The Deadly Experiments of Dr. Eeek appears in this book. The scenario is that something grabs your right hand and you must be left-handed to escape.\n\nWhile the Scholastic logo is on the front of the book cover and the red border is on the spine, the logo itself is missing from the spine.\n\nThis book references Count Dracula and The Creature from the Black Lagoon.\n\nThe 2015 ebook replaces \"CD player\" with \"a full music library\".\n\nReferences in other Goosebumps Media[]\n\nSybil Wicked appears in Download and Die!, the second arc of the Goosebumps comic series."
