        "text": "Scrape off as much wax as you can with a butter knife or spoon when it’s dry. You can also freeze the clothing item to harden the wax. Be sure not to try to remove the wax when it’s still warm, as this may cause it to spread into the fabric.\n\nPlace your garment, stain side down, on a paper towel. Put another paper towel on top. Using an iron on a low-setting, press the paper towel to pull as much wax out of the fabric as possible. Replace the waxy paper towels with a clean batch, and repeat the process until the wax no longer transfers onto the paper towels.\n\nPretreat the wax stain with a stain treatment or detergent. Check your clothing’s care label for wash instructions, specifically for water temperature. Fill a sink or basin with about 2 cups of the hottest water that’s safe for the fabric. Soak your clothing for at least 1 hour. Rinse the item thoroughly, making sure there are no excess suds before putting it in your washer.\n\nSelect Whirlpool® top load washers have a Pretreat Station so you can soak, scrub and wash right in the washer with a built-in dual temperature faucet and pretreat brush.\n\nAdd your clothing to your washer and select a heavy soil setting. Use regular detergent and choose your wash setting according to the water temperature recommended on the clothing care label.\n\nConsider using a small amount of oxygen bleach in the wash load if you find any residual color from the wax on the fabric. Unlike chlorine bleach, oxygen bleach is generally color-safe.\n\nHang up the garment so that it fully dries. When the fabric is wet, you may not notice the stain. If the stain remains in the fabric after the item is dry, wash it as many times as necessary to remove it."
