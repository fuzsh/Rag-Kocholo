        "text": "American bootlegging record label\n\nThe Amazing Kornyfone Record Label (TAKRL) was one of the first bootlegging record labels in America. Kornyfone was based in Southern California in the 1970s. The label released albums from such artists as The Beatles, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Elton John, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Genesis, and others. Kornyfone was known for its packaging, with interesting artwork and informative covers.\n\nAccording to Clinton Heylin,[1] \"Though Dub's output [at TMQ] in the five years separating Great White Wonder from Tales from The Who had outstripped any of his competitors, TMQ's catalogue pales alongside what Ken and co. unleashed between 1974 and the end of 1976. One hundred-plus titles from the flagship label, The Amazing Kornyphone Record Label,[2] were supplemented by represses of Smokin' Pig titles, thirty-two titles on TKRWM (The Kornyphone Records for the Working Man), a dozen double-albums on Singer's Original Double Discs (SODD), 20 releases on the Phonygraf label (Phonygraf), and sixteen releases on Highway High Fi Collector's Edition Records (HHCER) (which regularly appeared with TAKRL or Smokin' Pig labels - just to add to the confusion).\" The TAKRL label was active between 1974 and 1977. In 1978 they re-pressed some of their titles with black and white covers.\n\nReleases\n\n[edit]\n\n1373-RS – George Harrison – US tour 1974 : Let's Hear One for Lord Budda\n\n1374-RS – The Beatles – EMI outtakes\n\n1375-RS – Yes – Live in Amsterdam\n\n1376-RS – Deep Purple – Glutton for punishment\n\n1377-RS – Queen – Royal American tour\n\n1379-RS – Black Sabbath – Gr'ndlepol\n\n1380-RS – Elton John – Closet keepers\n\n1387-RS – Yardbirds – Golden eggs\n\n1900 – The Beatles – On stage in Japan : The 1966 tour\n\n1901 – The Jeff Beck Group – European tour\n\n1902 – Blind Faith – Recorded live along the U.S tour\n\n1903 – Pink Floyd – In celebration of the comet\n\n1904 – Cat Stevens – The Hoaxer's midnight daydream\n\n1905 – David Bowie – Dollars in drag : The 1980 floor show[3]\n\n1906 – Fleetwood Mac – Merely a Portmanteau\n\n1907 – Elton John – Rock and roll Madonna\n\n1908 – Joe Cocker – The lost live album\n\n1909 – Frank Zappa/Mothers – Poot face boogie\n\n1910 – Moody Blues – Grande toure\n\n1911 – Emerson, Lake and Palmer – The callow and cash and idle eyes\n\n1912 – Bob Dylan – Ode for Barbara Allen\n\n1913 – Pink Floyd – Nocturnal submission : robot love\n\n1914 – The Yardbirds – Last hurray in the big apple\n\n1915 – David Bowie – Good enough to eat : Soft in the middle\n\n1916 – The Who – Decidedly belated response\n\n1917 – Neil Young – The last album\n\n1918 – Mott The Hoople – Behind Enemy Lines\n\n1919 – The Rolling Stones – The Jean-Clarke Mammorial Sonic Barbecue\n\n1920 – Procol Harum – Tales with tangrams\n\n1921 – Buffalo Springfield – Stampede : the gold star acetates\n\n1922 – The Bonzo Dog Band – Loose Caboose\n\n2922 – Bob Dylan – Lovesongs for America : Cast-off Lungs and Retoughed Badlands\n\n1923 – The Mahavishnu Orchestra – Bundled Sunspray Demise\n\n1924 – Steely Dan – Rotoscope Down Pleasantly Retired (A Peak Behind the Curtain)[4]\n\n2924 – Emerson, Lake and Palmer – The 1972 American tour\n\n1925 – Joni Mitchell – Lennie and Dom Songs (Early On)\n\n1926 – Rick Wakeman – Unleashing the Tethered One\n\n1927 – Van Der Graaf Generator – Fellow Traveller\n\n2927 – Elton John – No title\n\n1928 – King Crimson – Un Rêve Sans Conséquence Spéciale\n\n1929 – Frank Zappa / Mothers – Safe muffinz\n\n1930 – Deep Purple – Perks and tit\n\n1931 – Traffic – On by the way\n\n1932 – Alice Cooper – Parricidal slumbers\n\n1933 – Pink Floyd – Ohn suite ohm : we've blown (ahhaa!) the clone\n\n1934 – Santana – Flako De '57 Sportshirt\n\n1935 – David Bowie – Last stand : his masters voice\n\n1936 – The Nazz – Twenty/twenty hindsight\n\n2936 – The Who – Jaguar anyone?\n\n1937 – Lothar and The Hand People – Spores\n\n2937 – Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young – Nice to see you : the nineteen seventy-four excursion\n\n1938 – Chicago – On stage\n\n1939 – Robin Trower – Guitar bandit\n\n1940 – The Kinks – Survivors\n\n1941 – The Rolling Stones – Bedspring symphony\n\n1942 – Little Feat – Electric lycanthrope\n\n1943 – Gentle Giant – Playing the foole\n\n1944 – Elton John – Just like strange rain : pink-eyed in paradise part one\n\n1945 – Genesis – As though emerald city\n\n1946 – Elton John – All across the havens : pink-eyed in paradise part two -
