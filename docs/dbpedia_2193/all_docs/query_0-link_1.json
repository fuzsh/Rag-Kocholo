        "text": "Cover image shows the fresh faced band onstage with Jordan (“Queen of Punks”) at Andrew Logan’s loft, Valentine’s day, 1976, their 10th ever gig. In 1977 she briefly managed Adam & The Ants – which are next up, coincidentally.\n\nJapan: 1981\n\nMost of the Sex Pistols’ concerts on their summer 1977 Scandinavian Tour took place in Sweden:\n\n13.7.77 Daddy’s Dance Hall, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n14.7.77 Daddy’s Dance Hall, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n15.7.77 Beach Disco, Diskotek Ostra Stranden, Halmstad, Sweden\n\n16.7.77 Mogambo Disco, Helsingborg, Sweden\n\n17.7.77 Discotheque 42, Jonkoping, Sweden\n\n19.7.77 Club Zebra, Kristinehamn, Sweden\n\n20.7.77 Pinvinen Restaurant, Oslo, Norway\n\n21.7.77 Studenter Samfundet, Trodheim, Norway\n\n23.7.77 Barbarellas Disco, Vaxjo, Sweden\n\n24.7.77 Barbarellas Disco, Vaxjo, Sweden\n\n27.7.77 Happy House, Student Karen, Stockholm, Sweden – 23 & over\n\n28.7.77 Happy House, Student Karen, Stockholm, Sweden – 15 & over\n\nRecordings from this tour are worth having as the band had arguably hit a peak as a live band.\n\n**\n\nDisc one was recorded at the last Swedish concert at the Happy House, Student Karen in Stockholm on July 28 (not the 21st as stated on the back and not disc 2.\n\nSide A: Anarchy In The UK / I Wanna Be Me / Seventeen / New York / EMI\n\nSide B: Submission / Problems / God Save The Queen / Pretty Vacant\n\nThe gig was filmed on 16mm (see YT clip below) and broadcast on the radio and subsequently bootlegged (minus ‘No Feelings’ and ‘No Fun’).\n\n“It was the father of NOMADS’ guitarist Hasse who made the 16mm film and supplied the tape for the BAD BOYS LP, made by ”Tummen”, manager of punk band The ASS.” [acc.umu.se/~samhain/summerofhate/stockholm2.html]\n\nThe first release of this material was on the Swedish BAD BOYS LP (PECCA records matrix no: BB77), limited to 1000 copies.\n\n***\n\nDisc 2 is the same recording as the Japanese bootleg TOUR OF SCANDINAVIA (SP 3117 / ZAP–7961) minus the studio tracks, previously presented in this blog here.\n\n**\n\nThe UD release was then copied in Australia ca. 1983 on the Happy Porpak punk and new wave bootleg label:\n\n**\n\nPrices at auction have fluctuated quite a bit from $130+ t0 $300, one auction finished at a remarkable $437 in July of 2014.\n\nSource: Audience recording from the 100 Club in London’s Oxford Street taped on 31 August 1976 (the flyer shown on the cover is misleading but perhaps it was the only one the person designing the cover art had access to).\n\nJapan: ? – if I had to submit my best educated guess, I would say 1980 +/- 2 years on either side. philjens.plus.com/pistols/pistols/pistols_bootlegs_vinyl.htm seems to say that this Japan release was the first ever release of this material, which is surprising. They also state this also exists with a b&w cover.

Halmstad was the first gig in Sweden on their Scandinavian tour. Likely a copy of the Swedish bootleg Anarchy In Sweden\n\nSide A: Anarchy In The UK / I Wanna Be Me / Seventeen / New York / EMI / No Feelings\n\nSide B: Pretty Vacant / Problems / God Save The Queen\n\nPlus 4 UK B-sides: I Wanna Be Me (EMI 2566B)/ Did You No Wrong (VS181B) / No Fun (VS 184B)/ Satellite (VS 191B)\n\nQuality is listed as “Fair mono” for the Swedish concert (“Exs” for the official B-sides), however it’s “Vgm” for the Swedish original and I doubt the Japanese copy sounds that much worse.\n\n***\n\nThese 9 songs were the complete concert, lasting just over 30 minutes. This material was first released on the Swedish bootleg Anarchy In Sweden GUN 001\n\n“Songs from Halmstad are also available on a number of other bootlegs and semi official records. TOUR OF SCANDINAVIA (SEX PISTOLS RECORDS cat no:SP3117) is another classic bootleg from Sweden. It’s the exact same recordings but with an added bonus of the 4 7” b-side tracks in their normal studio versions. The bootleg double LP SWEDEN [on the UD label, which will make an appearance on this blog soon] includes both HALMSTAD and STOCKHOLM SECOND NIGHT.\n\nPOWER OF THE PISTOLS (77 RECORDS cat no:772) has the first six numbers on side A, but the sound quality is not as good as on the original bootlegs. “\n\n1st pressing (300 copies): Fold-out white cover with red rubber stamp. A metal enforced hole + safety pin in the top right corner. Songs stamped on the inside left partial panel. “Holidays in the Sun” is listed instead of “New York” and “I’m A Lazy Sod” instead of “Seventeen”.\n\n2nd pressing: Same as above with “New York” listed instead of “Holidays in the Sun” and “Seventeen” instead of “I’m A Lazy Sod”.\n\n3rd pressing: Same fold-out cover with “SEX PISTOLZ” & “GUN001″stamped in purple ink on front. Hole on top right corner. Some copies came with a safety pins but not all. “This version is said to have been made in 500 copies but it’s much harder to find than the first one, so I don’t know?” This seems to be due to the fact that the first and second printing look identical, except for the corrected track list on the inside panel, so there are more with the red rubber stamp.\n\nThere are further variations among these 3rd pressings: “There are also different versions of the cover for the 3rd pressing. One has a safety pin going through the metal rings on both sides of the cover as on the first pressing. But the rubber stamps are not just the two, this one’s got 10 or 12 of them on the front of the cover. No track listing on the inside.”\n\n4th pressing: Plain white cover, no safety pin, “SEX PISTOLZ” and “GUN001” stamped in purple ink.\n\n5th pressing: Plain white cover and no stamp. Green paper insert with “Sex Pistols” in large letters (same logo as the 1st pressing) + date, venue, track listing.\n\nEach pressings was limited to 300 – 500 copies each. An eBay seller wrote “…near all had warp on vinyl some bad some better,,.”.\n\nFew bootlegs make it into the world of fiction but this one did: “In Unni Drougge’S Swedish novel JAG JAG JAG (Forum 1994, Månpocket 1995) there are stories about the making of this LP and her bringing a copy of it to Malcolm McLaren in London.”\n\nThe Halmstad performance “The bouncers were hitting people for no reason.”\n\n“Diskotek Stranden (Beach Disco), located on Badvägen 38, was a very small place, just the restaurant of the hotel Östra Stranden. Sold out with 125 people in the audience. The band was escorted by both uniformed and plain clothes cops. There were no advance tickets available for any of the Scandinavian 1977 gigs, as that’s what the band wanted.” [Source for this and all other quotes: https://www.acc.umu.se/~samhain/summerofhate/halmstad.html]\n\nIn the 1970’s, there were two phases when rock bootlegs managed to transcend their humble existence: First, in 1969/’70 when this was a new phenomenon, satisfying the urge to hear new/live material by 1960’s icons and giving those interested a first taste of how some of the hottest new acts of 1970 sounded live. Second, in 1977 in the UK when only bootlegs were the only medium to capture the fleeting nature of a musical revolution.\n\n“…it would be impossible to consider either the social or musical impact of English punk without considering The Sex Pistols’ Spunk and Indecent Exposure, The Buzzcocks’ Time’s Up, Siouxsie and the Banshees’ Love In A Void or Joy Division’s Warsaw – albums as central to the movement as The Clash, Never Mind The Bollocks or Pink Flag. For a brief moment, the lines were down.” [Bootleg, Heylin, p. 163]\n\nBands changed line ups so fast that it was all over months ago by the time fans caught up. Only the bootlegs could fill this demand for any tangible evidence of a band’s fleeting moment of brilliance.\n\nA copy of the UK bootleg Spunk with short intro track added (parts of Janet Street Porter interview with John Lydon). The first edition of Spunk is described in detail here: http://www.discogs.com/Sex-Pistols-Spunk/release/673946\n\nSmilin’ Ears version released in 1978.\n\nSpunk is one of the few bootlegs that has its own Wikipedia entry AND probably the only entry where a Smilin’ Ears title is mentioned: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spunk_%28album%29\n\nDiscussion about how to identify an original pressing and the speed issue can be found here: http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/sex-pistols-spunk-original-pressing-question.289041/\n\n***\n\nSome images relating to the original UK release:\n\n“Alan Henderson: […] … And the first few thousand we took out into my back garden and spray painted a stencil with Spunk. […] [Bootleg, Heylin, p. 169]\n\nI wonder if this record store owner isn’t mistaken and they had spray painted it with the band’s name – which would have made more sense marketing-wise – and this is one of these copies?\n\n***\n\nSuch is the legend of this bootleg that the Independent UK newspaper wrote in their obituary for Dave Goodman, the producer of the demo sessions immortalized here “Dave Goodman was the man behind the notorious Sex Pistols bootleg Spunk. Reviewed in glowing terms by the New Musical Express and Sounds, …” as if the bootleg had been Dave’s initiative – also making him the only individual so far to have a bootleg LP listed as their top achievement in life.\n\nNobody was ever prosecuted for copyright infringement, despite Johnny Rotten stating on BBC radio that he knew exactly who was behind the album and fully intended to deal with the person. Malcom McLaren, suspected by many to be behind it all, denied his involvement. It was all very punk and certainly helped the band immensely, the publicity in the press alone could not have been bought for any amount.\n\n***\n\nThe album repressed as “No Future U.K?” with a couple of extra tracks (not to be mistaken with the live bootleg by the same name):\n\nNo Future UK?

Also pressed as ‘Spunk 2′ and ‘Son Of Spunk’. Some copies of No Future UK? (GD 002) carry Spunk BLA-169 labels on both sides, however the contents comprise of the 15 track LP as listed above.\n\nAnother version of No Future UK? was released under the name of ‘Golden Bullet’.

[03:52]\n\n17. Trident Jam [03:43]\n\n“Jiving Sister Fanny” was recorded on July 2nd, 1969 at Olympic Studio, the day before Brian Jones died. Two versions with different lyrics were recorded that day. This is the rarer of the two, having appeared on some pressings of Metamorphosis while the second take appears on most pressings of the album and on the London Years.\n\n“I’m Going Down” was initially worked on between April 17th to July 1969 at Olympic Studio and later right before the US tour from October and November, 1969 in Los Angeles. This take, which was also used for Metamorphosis in 1975, dates from July 14th and July 15th, 1970 at Olympic. This track differs from the commercial version by having a false start. This track features Bobby Keys on sax, Rocky Dijon on percussion, Stephen Stills on guitar, and Bill Plummer on upright bass.\n\n“Hamburger To Go” (aka “Give Me A Hamburger To Go” and “Stuck Out Alone”) dates from sessions at Olympic from March and April, 1968 and remains unreleased. ”Downtown Susie” is a Bill Wyman tune recorded on April 23rd, 1969 at Olympic Studio and is the same as the version on Metamorphosis except is shorter at the fade by five seconds.\n\n“Blood Red Wine” was recorded May, 1968 at Olympic Studio. Jagger sings the vocals, Nicky Hopkins plays piano, and no other information is available. It has never been released which is a shame because it is the most intriguing song in this collection. “Travelin’ Man” is another unreleased song recorded at Olympic in October, 1970.\n\nThe first version of “Family” dates from May, 1968 in Olympic and it the arrangement with the electric guitar. The acoustic guitar arrangement which would appear on Metamorphosis would be recorded the following month. “Still A Fool” was recorded at the same sessions and is a ten minute jam on the Muddy Waters tune. Jagger tries his best to sing like the blues singer too.\n\nSix out of the last seven tracks are instrumentals. “Leather Jacket,” recorded on June 22nd, 1970 at Olympic Studio in London, is a lighthearted and infectious pop instrumental whose sunniness is outside the pale of the Stones. “Dancing In the Light,” dating from the spring of 1970, is another upbeat instrumental but with some recognizable Stones raunch. “Potted Shrimp” and “Aladdin Story” come from the same time period as “Leather Jacket” but recorded at Stargroves. “And I Was A Country Boy” comes from the Feb.18-Mar.31 1969 sessions.\n\n“Who Am I?” (aka “See I Love You”) is a true mystery. It is listed on this release as being from Olympic Studio in March to May 1970. Others sources say late 1969 and even others from Jamaica 1972 and still others claim it comes from 1963 because of its simplicity. The best sources say it was recorded on July 14th – 15th, 1970.\n\nThe final Trident jam is another mystery. There is no name associated with it and was never used by the band. […] Although there are no hidden gems on this (there is a reason why many of them still reside in the vaults) but this is an interesting collection. ” [collectorsmusic.com]\n\nA few years later copied in Europe on colored wax (5 different colors – green, blue, red, yellow, mcv), easily identifiable by the shorter matrix number K&S 072\n\n***\n\n073:\n\nSource: 23 June 1977 (early show) – Bottom Line, New York – KBF radio broadcast.

Capturing the Sex Pistols during their whirlwind 1978 tour of some of the United States’ most elegant saloons, this features a zonked-out Sid Vicious as court jester (at one point referring to the audience members–in Dallas, Texas, mind you–as “faggots”), essentially leaving Steve Jones in charge of all the musicianship here. As Johnny Rotten blood-curdling voice roars an epic cover of the Stooges’ “No Fun” (which is, believe it or not, even better than the original!), Jones slashes away on this simple two-chord track as if his life depended on it, putting even Johnny Thunders’ guitarwork–the player Jones most clearly imitates–to shame. This live album is not about musical precision: it’s about the shambolic spirit of sloppy musicianship combined with precision of passionate onstage intensity that transcends anything capable by the likes or Rush and Genesis. This is the real shit right here.”\n\n“A pretty good sounding recording of the show.
