Pure abstraction can be interpreted as any art in which the depiction of real objects has been entirely discarded and whose aesthetic content is expressed in a formal pattern or structure of shapes, lines and colors. When the representation of real objects is completely absent, such art may be called non-objective.\n\nABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM\n\n1940's New York painting movement based on Abstract Art. This type of painting is often referred to as action painting.\n\nACCENT\n\nEmphasis given to certain elements in a painting which makes them attract more attention.

Art that actually transforms the natural landscape.\n\nETCHING\n\nThe technique of reproducing a design by coating a metal plate with wax and drawing with a sharp instrument called a stylus through the wax down to the metal. The plate is put in an acid bath, which eats away the incised lines; it is then heated to dissolve the wax and finally inked and printed on paper. The resulting print is called the etching.\n\nEXPRESSIONISM\n\nAny art that stresses the artist’s emotional and psychological reaction to subject matter, often with bold colors and distortions of form. Specifically, an art style of the early 20th century followed principally by certain German artists.\n\nFAUVISM\n\nA short lived painting style in early 20th century France, which featured bold, clashing, arbitrary colors - colors unrelated to the appearance of forms in the natural world. Henri Matisse was its best-known practitioner. The word fauve means “wild beast.”\n\nFIGURE - GROUND\n\nIn two-dimensional art, the relationship between the principal forms and the background. Figure-ground ambiguity suggests equal importance for the two.\n\nFINE ART\n\nAn art form created primarily as an aesthetic expression to be enjoyed for its own sake. The viewer must be prepared to search for the intent of the artist as the all-important first step toward communication and active participation.\n\nFIRING\n\nHeating pottery or sculpture in a kiln or open fire to bring the clay to maturity. The temperature needed to mature the clay varies with the type of body used.

The picture plane is commonly associated with the foreground of a painting.\n\nPIGMENT\n\nA coloring substance made from plants, earth, or minerals and may include other synthetic elements. When mixed with binders it becomes paint, ink or crayon, etc.\n\nPOINTILLISM\n\nA branch of French Impressionism in which the principle of optical mixture or broken color was carried to the extreme of applying color in tiny dots or small, isolated strokes. Forms are visible in a pointillist painting only from a distance, when the viewer's eye blends the colors to create visual masses and outlines. The inventor and chief exponent of pointillism was George Seurat (1859-1891); the other leading figure was Paul Signac (1863-1935).\n\nPOLYCHROMATIC\n\nHaving many colors, as opposed to monochromatic which means only one hue or color.\n\nPOP ART\n\nA style derived from commercial art forms and characterized by larger than life replicas of items from mass culture.

Prints are referred to as multiples, because as a rule many identical or similar impressions are made from the same printing surface, the number of impressions being called an edition. When an edition is limited to a specified number of prints, it is a limited edition. A print is considered an original work of art and today is customarily signed and numbered by the artist.\n\nPRIMITIVE ART\n\n1. Paintings and drawings of and by peoples and races outside the influence of accepted Western styles.\n\n2. Religious portrayals predating scientific studies of perspective and anatomy.\n\n3. Intuitive artists with a \"naive\" style often due to little, if any, training (or works intentionally made to\n\nlook this way).\n\nPROPORTION\n\nSize relationships between parts of a whole, or between two or more objects perceived as a unit.\n\nREALISM\n\nAny art in which the goal is to portray forms in the natural world in a highly representational manner. Specifically, an art style of the mid 19th century, which fostered the idea that everyday people and events are worthy subjects for important art.\n\nRELATIVE APPARENT SIZE\n\nObjects appear smaller as their distance from the viewer increases.\n\nRELATIVE POSITION\n\nWe view nature from our own eye level. Objects in the foreground appear lower and distant objects appear higher relative to the imaginary line created by our level of sight.\n\nRELIEF\n\n1. Sculpture in which figures or other images are attached to a flat background but project out from it to some degree (bas-relief, haut-relief). 2. A printmaking technique in which portions of a block meant to be printed are raised above the surface.\n\nRENAISSANCE\n\nLiterally, “rebirth”. The period in Europe from the 14th to the 16th century, characterized by a renewed interest in Classical art, architecture, literature, and philosophy. The Renaissance began in Italy and gradually spread to the rest of Europe. In art, it is most closely associated with Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL\n\nWorks of art that closely resemble forms in the natural world. Synonymous with naturalistic\n\nROCOCO\n\nA style of art popular in Europe in the first three quarters of the 18th century, Rococo architecture and furnishings emphasized ornate but small-scale decoration, curvilinear forms, and pastel colors. Rococo painting has a playful, light-hearted romantic quality and often pictures the aristocracy at leisure.\n\nROMANESQUE\n\nA style of architecture and art dominant in Europe from the 9th to the 12th century. Romanesque architecture, based on ancient Roman precedents, emphasizes the round arch and barrel vault.\n\nROMANTICISM\n\nA movement in Western art of the 19th century generally assumed to be in opposition to Neoclassicism. Romantic works are marked by intense colors, turbulent emotions, complex composition, soft outlines, and sometimes heroic subject matter.\n\nSALON\n\n1. Fashionable gathering of artists, writers, and intellectuals held in a private home.\n\n2. In France, a state-sponsored exhibition of art, held in Paris, controlled by the\n\nAcademy of Fine Arts.\n\nSCALE\n\nSize in relation to some “normal” or constant size. Compare with proportion.\n\nSCULPTURE\n\nA three-dimensional form modeled, carved, or assembled.\n\nSECONDARY COLORS\n\nA hue created by combining two primary colours, as yellow and blue mixed together yield green. In pigment the secondary colors are orange, green, and violet.\n\nSERIGRAPH\n\nSerigraphy is a color stencil printing process in which a special paint is forced through a fine screen onto the paper beneath. Areas that do not print are blocked with photo sensitive emulsion that has been exposed with high intensity arc lights. A squeegee is pulled from back to front, producing a direct transfer of the image from screen to paper. A separate stencil is required for each color and one hundred colors or more may be necessary to achieve the desired effect. A serigraph, also referred to as a screen print, differs from other graphics in that its color is made up of paint films rather than printing ink stains. This technique is extremely versatile, and can create effects similar to oil color and transparent washes, as well as gouache and pastel.\n\nSFUMATO\n\nFrom the Italian work for “smoke,” a technique of painting in thin glazes to achieve a hazy, cloudy atmosphere, often to represent objects or landscape meant to be perceived as distant from the picture plane.\n\nSHAPE\n\nA two-dimensional area having identifiable boundaries, created by lines, color, or value changes, or some combination of these; broadly, form.\n\nSIMULTANEOUS CONTRAST\n\nThe tendency of complementary colors to seem brighter and more intense when placed side by side.\n\nSILHOUETTE\n\nThe outer shape of an object. An outline, often filled in with color.\n\nSKETCH\n\nA preliminary drawing of a composition.\n\nSPACE\n\nIn painting, space may by defined as the distances between shapes on a flat surface and the illusion of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface. Also refers to a physical site where art is displayed for viewing.\n\nSTILL LIFE\n\nA painting or other two-dimensional work in which the subject matter is an arrangement of objects - fruit, flowers, tableware, pottery, and so forth - brought together for their pleasing contrasts of shape, color, and texture, Also the arrangement of the objects itself.\n\nSTIPPLING\n\nA pattern of closely spaced dots or small marks used to create a sense of three-dimensionally on a flat surface, especially in drawing and printmaking. See also hatching, cross-hatching.\n\nSTUDY\n\nA detailed drawing or painting made of one or more parts of a final composition, but not the whole work.\n\nSTYLE\n\nA characteristic, or a number of characteristics that we can identify as constant, recurring, or coherent. In art, the sum of such characteristics associated with a particular artist, group, or culture, or with an artist’s work at a specific time.\n\nSTYLIZED\n\nDescriptive of works based on forms in the natural world, but simplified or distorted for design purposes. See also abstract.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nThe surface on which a work of two-dimensional art is made i.e.: canvas, paper, cardboard, or wood.\n\nSURREALISM\n\nA painting style of the early 20th century that emphasized imagery and visions from dreams and fantasies, as well as an intuitive, spontaneous method of recording such imagery, often combining unrelated or unexpected objects in compositions .\n\nSYMBOL\n\nAn image or sign that represents something else, because of convention, association, or resemblance.\n\nSYMMETRICAL\n\nDescriptive of a design in which the two halves of a composition on either side of an imaginary central vertical axis correspond to one another in size, shape, and placement.\n\nTACTILE\n\nA quality which refers to the sense of touch.\n\nTAPESTRY\n\nA type of weaving in which the crosswise yarns are manipulated freely to create patterned or pictorial effects.\n\nTEMPERA\n\nA painting medium in which the binder is egg yolk.\n\nTERTIARY COLORS\n\nSix colors positioned between the primary and secondary colors on the color wheel.\n\nTEXTURE\n\nThe actual feel (roughness or smoothness) of a surface. In art, texture may refer to the illusion of roughness or smoothness often achieved with contrasting patterns.\n\nTRIPTYCH\n\nA three-part work of art; especially a painting, meant for placement on an altar, with three panels that fold together.\n\nTONALITY\n\nThe overall color effect in terms of hue and value. Often one dominating hue is employed in various shades and values.\n\nTROMPE-L’OEIL\n\nA French term meaning \"deception of the eye.\" A painting or other work of two-dimensional art rendered in such a photographically realistic manner as to ‘trick’ the viewer into thinking it is three-dimensional reality.\n\nUNDERPAINTING\n\nThe traditional stage in oil painting of using a monochrome or dead color as a base for composition. Also known as laying in.\n\nVALUE\n\nThe relative lightness or darkness of a hue, or of a neutral varying from white to black.\n\nVANISHING POINT\n\nIn linear perspective, the point on the horizon line where parallel lines appear to converge.\n\nVEHICLE\n\nThe entire liquid contents of a paint.\n\nVERTICAL\n\nA line from top to bottom or bottom to top. upright.\n\nVOLUME\n\nSimilar to mass, a three-dimensional form implying bulk, density, and weight; but also a void or empty, enclosed space.\n\nWARM COLORS\n\nThose which suggest a sense of warmth i.e.: red, yellow and orange.\n\nWASH\n\nUsed in watercolor painting, brush drawing, and occasionally in oil painting and sculpture to describe a broad thin layer of diluted pigment, ink, glaze or patina.
