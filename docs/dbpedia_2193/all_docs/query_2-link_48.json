        "text": "Soft colorless solid derived from petroleum, coal or shale oil\n\nThis article is about the wax. For the fuel, see kerosene.\n\nParaffin wax Identifiers ECHA InfoCard 100.029.375 UNII Properties CnH2n+2 Appearance White solid[1] Odor Odorless Boiling point > 370 °C (698 °F) ~1 mg/L[1] Hazards Flash point 200–240 °C (392–464 °F; 473–513 K)[1]\n\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\n\nChemical compound\n\nParaffin wax (or petroleum wax) is a soft colorless solid derived from petroleum, coal, or oil shale that consists of a mixture of hydrocarbon molecules containing between 20 and 40 carbon atoms. It is solid at room temperature and begins to melt above approximately 37 °C (99 °F),[2] and its boiling point is above 370 °C (698 °F).[2] Common applications for paraffin wax include lubrication, electrical insulation, and candles;[3] dyed paraffin wax can be made into crayons. It is not to be confused with kerosene and other petroleum products that are sometimes called paraffin.[4]\n\nUn-dyed, unscented paraffin candles are odorless and bluish-white. Paraffin wax was first created by Carl Reichenbach in Germany in 1830 and marked a major advancement in candlemaking technology, as it burned more cleanly and reliably than tallow candles and was cheaper to produce.[5]\n\nIn chemistry, paraffin is used synonymously with alkane, indicating hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2. The name is derived from Latin parum (\"very little\") + affinis, meaning \"lacking affinity\" or \"lacking reactivity\", referring to paraffin's unreactive nature.[6]\n\nProperties\n\n[edit]\n\nParaffin wax is mostly found as a white, odorless, tasteless, waxy solid, with a typical melting point between about 46 and 68 °C (115 and 154 °F),[7] and a density of around 900 kg/m3.[8] It is insoluble in water, but soluble in ether, benzene, and certain esters. Paraffin is unaffected by most common chemical reagents but burns readily.[9] Its heat of combustion is 42 MJ/kg.[10]\n\nParaffin wax is an excellent electrical insulator, with a resistivity of between 1013 and 1017 ohm-metre.[11] This is better than nearly all other materials except some plastics (notably PTFE). It is an effective neutron moderator and was used in James Chadwick's 1932 experiments to identify the neutron.[12][13]\n\nParaffin wax is an excellent material for storing heat, with a specific heat capacity of 2.14–2.9 J⋅g−1⋅K−1 (joules per gram per kelvin) and a heat of fusion of 200–220 J⋅g−1.[14] Paraffin wax phase-change cooling coupled with retractable radiators was used to cool the electronics of the Lunar Roving Vehicle during the crewed missions to the Moon in the early 1970s.[15] Wax expands considerably when it melts and so is used in wax element thermostats for industrial, domestic and, particularly, automobile purposes.[16][17]\n\nIf pure paraffin wax melted to the approximate flash point in a half open glass vessel which is then suddenly cooled down, then its vapors may autoignite as result of reaching boiling liquid pressure.[18]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nParaffin wax was first created in 1830 by German chemist Karl von Reichenbach when he attempted to develop a method to efficiently separate and refine waxy substances naturally occurring in petroleum. Paraffin represented a major advance in the candle-making industry because it burned cleanly and was cheaper to manufacture than other candle fuels such as beeswax and tallow. Paraffin wax initially suffered from a low melting point. This was remedied by adding stearic acid. The production of paraffin wax enjoyed a boom in the early 20th century due to the growth of the oil and meatpacking industries, which created paraffin and stearic acid as byproducts.[5]\n\nManufacturing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe feedstock for paraffin is slack wax, which is a mixture of oil and wax, a byproduct from the refining of lubricating oil.\n\nThe first step in making paraffin wax is to remove the oil (de-oiling or de-waxing) from the slack wax. The oil is separated by crystallization. Most commonly, the slack wax is heated, mixed with one or more solvents such as a ketone and then cooled. As it cools, wax crystallizes out of the solution, leaving only oil. This mixture is filtered into two streams: solid (wax plus some solvent) and liquid (oil and solvent). After the solvent is recovered by distillation, the resulting products are called \"product wax\" (or \"press wax\") and \"foots oil\". The lower the percentage of oil in the wax, the more refined it is considered (semi-refined versus fully refined).[19] The product wax may be further processed to remove colors and odors. The wax may finally be blended together to give certain desired properties such as melt point and penetration. Paraffin wax is sold in either liquid or solid form.[20][21][22]\n\nApplications\n\n[edit]\n\nIn industrial applications, it is often useful to modify the crystal properties of the paraffin wax, typically by adding branching to the existing carbon backbone chain. The modification is usually done with additives, such as EVA copolymers, microcrystalline wax, or forms of polyethylene. The branched properties result in a modified paraffin with a higher viscosity, smaller crystalline structure, and modified functional properties. Pure paraffin wax is rarely used for carving original models for casting metal and other materials in the lost wax process, as it is relatively brittle at room temperature and presents the risks of chipping and breakage when worked. Soft and pliable waxes, like beeswax, may be preferred for such sculpture, but \"investment casting waxes,\" often paraffin-based, are expressly formulated for the purpose.\n\nIn a histology or pathology laboratory, paraffin wax is used to impregnate tissue prior to sectioning thin samples. Water is removed from the tissue through ascending strengths of alcohol (75% to absolute), and then the alcohol is cleared in an organic solvent such as xylene. The tissue is then placed in paraffin wax for several hours, then set in a mold with wax to cool and solidify. Sections are then cut on a microtome.\n\nOther uses\n\n[edit]\n\nCandle-making\n\nWax carving\n\nBicycle chain lubrication\n\nCoatings for waxed paper or waxed cotton\n\nFood-grade paraffin wax:\n\nShiny coating used in candy-making; although edible, it is nondigestible, passing through the body without being broken down\n\nCoating for many kinds of hard cheese, like Edam cheese\n\nSealant for jars, cans, and bottles\n\nChewing gum additive\n\nInvestment casting\n\nAnti-caking agent, moisture repellent, and dustbinding coatings for fertilizers\n\nAgent for preparation of specimens for histology\n\nBullet lubricant – with other ingredients, such as olive oil and beeswax\n\nPhlegmatizing agent, commonly used to stabilise/desensitize high explosives such as RDX\n\nCrayons\n\nSolid propellant for hybrid rocket motors[23][24]\n\nComponent of surfboard wax, ski wax, and skateboard wax\n\nInk.

It has been found that patients who have used paraffin bath therapy have yielded lower VAS and AUSCAN scores (pain scores) compared to those who did not.[31]\n\nUsed for wood finishing\n\nUsed as a fuel for fire breathing\n\nUsed in Lava Lamps\n\nOccupational safety\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople can be exposed to paraffin in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, and eye contact.
