But I came across a problem.\n\nThe table is by default sorted alphabetically, since the first item in the table is an alphabetical value (a toponym). It is then followed by a second, numerical value, and this is the value I need the table to be sorted by.\n\nI need to sort it because I can't just publish a 3474 line table. I need to sort it by this numerical value, and then divide into several smaller tables, and then publish them on Wikipedia.\n\nI was using Notepad for editing, but I got Notepad++ hoping I could find an easy fix, but no luck. Line example:\n\n| Gorna Banjica (Gostivar) || 3436 || 839 || 811 || 1053 || 610 || - || 1 || - || 15 || - || - || 107 |- | Mitra≈°inci (Berovo) || 555 || 519 || - || - || - || - || 1 || - || 1 || - || 1 || 33 |-\n\nHow can I do this? Any help is welcome, because sorting 3474 lines manually is going to take quite a while, and my daily schedule doesn't allow me to spend more than an hour working on the table."
