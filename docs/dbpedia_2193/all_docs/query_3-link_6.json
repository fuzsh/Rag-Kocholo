The tutor will be happy to discuss this with you.\n\nAT OUR COURSES YOU WILL BE WORKING ON EACH OTHER, SO NO MODELS ARE REQUIRED UNLESS YOU PREFER TO BRING ONE AS YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE WORKED ON. JUST LET US KNOW WHEN YOU BOOK AND WE ARE HAPPY TO HELP WITH THIS.\n\nFor ITEC courses only over 5 - 6 days, students need to bring a model ONLY on the exam day – no other day – just a model on exam day.\n\nOne day courses no models are required.\n\nWhat should I bring with me\n\nAll products that you use on the day whilst learning will be provided on the day of your training for massage, beauty and spiritual courses and are included in the price of your course.\n\nStudents should bring pen/pencil, paper and own lunch. Loose/comfortable clothing should be worn. You do not need to take anything with you to a class - all massage & beauty couches, chairs, towels and equipment are all provided.\n\nIf you are booking a massage course - because massage will be undertaken, normal standards of cleanliness will be expected including short fingernails.\n\nThe class runs with 2 or more people booked on and you can book 24 hours before the start date if you wish.\n\nThe tutors will be able to advise you on the best and most affordable equipment and/or kits to buy when you train with them so you can use these with your clients, or if you wish to buy them before you train you can!\n\nThere are no written exams for our one day courses, only a practical assessment by the tutor as you work during the day. The guidance you receive from your tutor will allow you to easily grasp your new skill.\n\nYou do not need to wear a therapist tunic or whites unless you wish to, comfortable clothing is fine.\n\nOur One Day Course certification is not brand specific.\n\nYou will get a practitioner's certificate and it does NOT say one day course anywhere on it.\n\nIt is a professional practitioner’s certificate and the accreditation body logos are also on your certificate, showing who has approved it for insurance purposes.\n\nTrusted, Recognised & Insurable Courses on Government/Councils Approved Accredited list.\n\nIf you are choosing a massage or beauty course, our courses are popular because the certification we give you allows a student to work with whichever particular brand they choose to purchase later and use with their clients.\n\nImportantly, we teach effective and safe methods with products that our tutors love to use, but do not insist on the students who attend having to continue with any one given brand afterwards to gain insurance and use what they have learned with us professionally.\n\nThis then allows students to make their own choice of brand and also means that they are not tied by any particular brand when it comes to their insurance, so should they ever have a problem and if a claim is made and they have changed brand, they would still be covered, (please check this with your insurance provider) giving you a lot more flexibility.\n\nThis also means you are not tied into buying brands from us, which is very restrictive and only makes the school you are buying them from money but does not benefit you. This means the certificate you gain with us gives you the freedom to use whichever brand you wish, the tutors can guide you towards good products but ultimately it is your choice!\n\nIn some cases your insurance may be invalid if you train with a branded product detailed on your training certificate and you then change to another brand. However, providing non brand specific training allows us to offer our courses at a lower cost, allowing you to spend what is right for you on the necessary products rather than buying unnecessary and costly equipment.\n\nThe tutor will be happy to discuss products, prices and how much you can charge for the therapy on your training day. The tutor will also cover the insurance information for you, we receive a discount with a large insurance company covering our training for those of you new to this field or wanting to change to a new and more affordable cover.\n\nYes we do offer discounts for products you can use after your course - We have teamed up with some excellent companies to offer really good discounts to our students.\n\nWe give you all of this information in your course manuals you receive (included in the price of your course) on the day of your training\n\nTHE ITEC COURSES - THE CERTIFICATES ARE ISSUED BY ITEC\n\nYou can only qualify and receive your certificate after both the home study and practical day have been completed.\n\nOur courses are approved and accredited by professional bodies/companies like ITEC, FHT, CTHA, Towergate, ABT and ThinkTree - Please check individual course pages regarding who accredits each one.\n\nOur One Day Course certification is not brand specific.\n\nYou will get a practitioner's certificate and it does NOT say one day course anywhere on it.\n\nIt is a professional practitioner’s certificate and the accreditation body logos are also on your certificate, showing who has approved it for insurance purposes.\n\nTrusted, Recognised & Insurable Courses on Government/Councils Approved Accredited list.\n\nIf you are choosing a massage or beauty course, our courses are popular because the certification we give you allows a student to work with whichever particular brand they choose to purchase later and use with their clients.\n\nImportantly, we teach effective and safe methods with products that our tutors love to use, but do not insist on the students who attend having to continue with any one given brand afterwards to gain insurance and use what they have learned with us professionally.\n\nThis then allows students to make their own choice of brand and also means that they are not tied by any particular brand when it comes to their insurance, so should they ever have a problem and if a claim is made and they have changed brand, they would still be covered, (please check this with your insurance provider) giving you a lot more flexibility.\n\nThis also means you are not tied into buying brands from us, which is very restrictive and only makes the school you are buying them from money but does not benefit you.

Please note the numbers available (which are showing when you visit our site) are correct on a minute to minute basis and will show full as soon as the course date becomes fully booked.\n\nIf the venue you selected says there are no dates available, please choose a different venue you can travel to or alternative date option - or you can email us to be put on the waiting list for any cancellations and we are happy to let you know as soon as one becomes free.\n\nFOR OUR ONE DAY COURSES\n\nNo you do not have to take a written exam on the day, only a practical assessment.\n\nNo case studies are required - no written exams, certificate given on the day on completion of a successful practical assessment with your tutor.\n\nAll our courses have been awarded CPD points (Continuing Professional Development). There are a certain amount of points required by the various bodies (IFPA, FHT etc) to ensure that members are up to date with various therapies. For example Aromatherapists are required every 3 years to keep their training in massage up to date and will look for CPD courses to be able to do this.\n\nPlease check with whom you are registered for their guidelines on how many points they award for one day courses as they all differ.\n\nFor Existing CTHA Members\n\nYou can attend this course and gain your CPD points through the CTHA as it is recognised as additional learning and students are able to get insurance cover through Holistic Insurance Services who will add it to the therapists insurance.\n\nFOR ALL ITEC EXAMS YOUR TUTOR WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN THESE ARE PLANNED AND GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS TO MAKE IT EASY - THEY ARE THERE TO HELP EVERY STEP OF THE WAY\n\nOur Tutors\n\nOur tutors are like a family unit; they deliver their courses with care and passion and have very high standards when it comes to our training. When taking a course with Gateway, you have peace of mind that you will be training with a long-established company, whose training courses are recognised and passed by the top professional bodies, ensuring quality training with experienced tutors.\n\nEstablished in 1998, we have a great team of tutors who have a wealth of knowledge and are passionate and caring. They also take pride in the way they look after their students both on the day of their training and also offer great aftercare and help where needed. All tutors are experienced in dealing with all different levels of skills and with small classes you are assured of individual attention.\n\nAll Gateway tutors hold a professional teacher training qualification (often the Award in Education, PTLLS level 3 or 4 or equivalent) and have also been a therapist for many years as well as a trainer, so you know you are in good hands.\n\nWe have years of experience to offer you, ensuring that you will be delighted with the course you choose.\n\nNO\n\nAll products will be provided on the day of your training (within the price of your course) that you use on the day whilst learning so you do not have to pay anything extra as it is all included in the price.\n\nThe tutors will be able to advise you on the best and affordable kits to buy when you train with them so you can use these with your clients, or if you wish to buy them before you train you can! Details are further down this page with a link offering a discount.\n\nGateway Workshops Limited are pleased to confirm that we have agreed a discount with a top company, offering affordable prices and high quality products which can be used by all of our students - the discount will be added for all orders, not just the first one. The company we use is the most popular one with our students each year so we are very happy to continue to recommend them to new students too who can also benefit from student discounts.\n\nIf it is a massage or beauty course the answer is -\n\nNo\n\nAvoid being caught out - continue learning your massage and beauty at a venue with a tutor to get the best tuition - be safe and ensure you can use what you learn professionally and still get insurance cover.\n\nWe do offer some of our others courses online as well as at our venues - for example some of our spiritual courses are available online but no massage or beauty courses.\n\nIt will be mentioned on each course page, if there is an online version available.\n\nWhy we do NOT offer the hands on practical massage or beauty courses online\n\n1. This is because we feel that it is not safe to offer massage or beauty courses online as you require a tutor to be with you in a room to guide you as these are hands-on therapies\n\n2. Also the councils are looking to regulate our industry and the insurance companies are looking to make stricter laws with their policies and cover - which we welcome\n\n3. It will be a lot harder to get many courses verified and covered for insurance soon due to new Government and council laws coming very soon\n\n4. You need a professional assessment on the day of your course in person to make sure you have learned a hands-on therapy safely, this cannot be done online or by zoom and likely not be accepted in the near future\n\n5. We want to make sure any massage or beauty qualification you gain can be used professionally and this needs to be with a tutor at a venue for insurance companies to be able to continue to insure you moving forwards\n\n6. Many large spas, hotels and salons will not take an online training certificate for massage or beauty and will ONLY accept a qualification gained with a tutor face-to-face at a venue for their insurance purposes\n\n7. To be taken seriously in our industry you want to make sure you get the right training with an experienced tutor - you can never replace this with online training as practical courses should be learned safely with a tutor face-to-face who has the right experience and tutor insurance to teach you correctly\n\n8.You learn a lot by receiving a treatment as well as learning how to give a treatment, you cannot experience how it feels or what it should feel like if you learn over zoom or by video - this is why you learn best being in a class with other students\n\nWe have two massage courses that have both practical hands on and also online learning:\n\nPLEASE NOTE FOR THE CANCER ONCOLOGY MASSAGE COURSE AND OUR BABY INSTRUCTOR MASSAGE COURSE - THESE TWO COURSES ONLY HAVE ONLINE LEARNING AS WELL AS PRACTICAL HANDS ON LEARNING AS WELL\n\nThe practical part of these courses are held at one of our venues and the theory part of the course is learned online.\n\nThe online part of the course will be yours to start in your own time with your own tutor to guide you every step of the way.\n\nThe Practical hands on Part of the Course:\n\nYou will be guided through the practical day by your tutor, in a small group, with lots of individual attention.\n\nYou do NOT need insurance to take our one day courses, but we advise you to act professionally and obtain suitable professional liability insurance (if you intend to use what you have learned on our practitioner courses and use them with the general public.)\n\nPrices for insurance vary but work out at about £60 - £80 a year depending which therapy you train in.\n\nFull details are given to you on the day of your course, however if you are a therapist already and have insurance you will be able to add your training to your existing insurance (we always advise you to check first before booking) or if they do not offer it for what you have learned we can suggest alternatives, so you are covered.\n\nAll this information can be found in your course information or you can contact your tutor at any time for further information or help and aftercare when needed.\n\nGateway highly recommends Westminster for therapist insurance. They are affordable, reliable and many of our students use them on a yearly basis. You will be given full information for Westminster insurance on the day of your training and you can also find their information in the product/shop section of our website.\n\nFOR OUR ITEC COURSES ALL STUDENTS WILL NEED THERAPIST INSURANCE TO TAKE AN ITEC COURSE - WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND WESTIMINSTER INSURANCE AND THEY OFFER A DISCOUNT TO ALL GATEWAY STUDENTS\n\nYour tutor can give you all of this information when you sign up for this course and help you with any questions you may have.\n\nYes\n\nFOR OUR ONE DAY COURSES\n\nMany other companies offer similar courses but have much larger classes therefore it has to be taught over a longer period of time. You may be asked to come back a second day to go over what you have learnt as the tutor does not have time to get around the class due to the large numbers.\n\nSome other schools offer their courses over 2 days, sometimes it is a good way to get you to pay more but very often you will learn the same routines, so what is the difference? They will often have much larger classes so they will have to spread their training over a longer period of time, however we believe in small numbers so you receive one to one tuition.\n\nIf you feel one day is not enough training, you are able to come back to repeat the course again free of charge. However, due to small classes this is rare but available if required.\n\nFOR MASSAGE AND BEAUTY COURSES\n\nWe also send you a fantastic FREE Anatomy and Physiology manual before you attend our courses; another reason why some training classes elsewhere are over 2 days.\n\nThis will be due to the fact the tutor will spend a lot of the time reading about the A & P on the day which we feel you should not pay for, so we give you a free manual so you can to do this in your own time. Relevant anatomy and physiology will of course be covered on the day.\n\nPlease however remember this manual is an extra freebie from us, your course training manual is included in the cost of the course and you will receive this as a fully bound hard copy on the day of your training.\n\nFOR THE ITEC TRAINING - THIS IS SPREAD OVER 5-6 DAYS OVER SEVERAL MONTHS (DEPENDING WHICH COURSE YOU SIGN UP FOR) ALLOWING YOU TIME TO DO YOUR CASE STUDIES\n\nYou can find all the latest students’ feedback, good or bad, here on this page.\n\nPlease scroll to the STUDENT FEEDBACK section on this page.\n\nWhen you complete a course with us, you will receive an email asking you to fill out our student feedback form.\n\nAll of our testimonials are genuine coming from the students who have taken our courses and we have a very high rating on Trustpilot and our Gateway Facebook business pages.\n\nYou know when you book with us you are booking with a company that has over 20 years’ experience teaching thousands of students and we have passionate and caring tutors you can trust.\n\nWe look forward to you attending a course with us and receiving your feedback too!\n\nOur tutors are passionate and kind and look after all our students, we are an established company with a 20+ year history behind us to make sure we get it right and we thank all those students who have sent in feedback, as we love to hear from them after a class.\n\nAll dates and availability are updated live as you book, once the deposit has been paid online, a place is allocated.\n\nPlease note the numbers available (which are showing when you visit our site on the date and venue pages) are correct on a minute to minute basis and will show full as soon as the course date becomes fully booked.\n\nCourses run with two or more people booked on and some can get booked very quickly so early booking is advised so you do not miss out on the date you can make.\n\nIf a date is full, most students book onto the next date available that they can make and when filling out your details, there is a note box section within the booking form and you can request here that you can be moved to the earlier date if there are any cancellations so you can be prioritised and contacted if we have anyone drop out.\n\nIf the venue you selected says there are no dates available please choose a different venue you can travel to or if no other venues have a date suitable, you can email us to be put on the waiting list for any cancellations and we are happy to let you know as soon as one becomes free."
