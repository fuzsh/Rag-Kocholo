        "text": "TL;DR Summary\n\nParaffin lubrication problems.\n\nHello everyone, I'm trying to make lubrication out of paraffin, this is what I am doing, 1/3 melted paraffin wax, 1/3 paraffin oil, and 1/3 xylene. After melting the wax I add the oil, I then add the oil, mix it well to the correct consistency, I then transfer it to a glass container where I add the xylene. The problem is once it cools it turns to a soft paste. What am I doing incorrectly? The idea was the xylene was the carrying agent that would evaporate quickly and leave the wax lube behind.\n\nThank you Bob, should I keep the base oil at 7.8 grams also? What I want is the xylene to evaporate and keep the wax behind. I have hexane also, could I use this instead of xylene?\n\nHexane will work a little bit better per the linked document. Cyclohexane is way better.\n\nBoth the solid and liquid forms are paraffins so I doubt you will get 7.8g of each to dissolve. Please note that dissolving that amount requires it to be heated to 38C.\n\nWhat are you attempting to lubricate?\n\nBoB\n\nI am will be lubricating chains, the wax is good as a water and dirt repellent, and the lubrication is very good.\n\nThe idea was to melt the wax add the base oil to make the paraffin wax not too crumbly when it drys on the chain. The hexane was just a carrying agent which evaporates quickly once applied.\n\nDo you think i should just melt the wax and add the hexane? The wax i am using has a very low oil content.\n\nSo by adding the base oil, which i would use paraffin oil it would loosen the wax and would coat the chain bett\n\ner.\n\nThanks again\n\nDene\n\nDene said:\n\nSummary: Paraffin lubrication problems.\n\nHello everyone, I'm trying to make lubrication out of paraffin, this is what I am doing, 1/3 melted paraffin wax, 1/3 paraffin oil, and 1/3 xylene.

As lamp oil or jet fuel. Now widely adopted in the US lamp oil business where it means deodorized kerosene."
