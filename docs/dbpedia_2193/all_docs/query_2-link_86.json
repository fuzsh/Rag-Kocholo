        "text": "Type of chili pepper\n\nBanana pepperSpeciesCapsicum annuumHeat MildScoville scale0–500 SHU\n\nThe banana pepper (also known as the yellow wax pepper or banana chili) is a medium-sized member of the chili pepper family that has a mild, tangy taste. While typically bright yellow, it is possible for them to change to green, red, or orange as they ripen.[1] It is often pickled, stuffed or used as a raw ingredient in foods. It is a cultivar of the species Capsicum annuum. Its flavor is not very hot (0–500 Scoville units) and, as is the case with most peppers, its heat depends on the maturity of the pepper, with the ripest being sweeter than younger ones.\n\nNomenclature\n\n[edit]\n\nA mature fruit will be about 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) in length and have a curved shape and yellowish colour similar to a banana, giving rise to the fruit's common name. Friggitelli (pepperoncini) are often erroneously referred to as banana peppers.[2] The hot varieties of banana pepper are called Hungarian wax peppers.[3]\n\nCultivation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe plant requires full sun, like other Capsicum annuum varieties, and should be treated the same as most other plants in the pepper family. Plants can be grown from seed and cuttings. A mature plant will reach 1 to 2 feet tall and can be grown in many climates, but prefers warmer climates. Cultivars include Early Sweet Banana, Hungarian Yellow Wax, Long Sweet Yellow, Sweet Banana, and Sweet Hungarian.[3]\n\nNutritional information\n\n[edit]\n\nPepper, banana, rawNutritional value per 100 gEnergy113 kJ (27 kcal)\n\n5.3 g\n\nSugars1.9 gDietary fiber3.4 g\n\n.5 g\n\n1.7 g\n\nVitamins and minerals\n\nVitaminsQuantity\n\n%DV†\n\nVitamin A equiv.\n\n2%\n\n17 μg\n\n2%\n\n184 μg\n\nThiamine (B1)\n\n8%\n\n0.1 mgRiboflavin (B2)\n\n4%\n\n0.05 mgNiacin (B3)\n\n8%\n\n1.2 mgPantothenic acid (B5)\n\n5%\n\n0.27 mgVitamin B6\n\n21%\n\n0.36 mgFolate (B9)\n\n7%\n\n29 μgVitamin C\n\n92%\n\n82.7 mgMineralsQuantity\n\n%DV†\n\nCalcium\n\n1%\n\n14 mgIron\n\n3%\n\n0.5 mgMagnesium\n\n4%\n\n17 mgManganese\n\n4%\n\n0.1 mgPhosphorus\n\n3%\n\n32 mgPotassium\n\n9%\n\n256 mgZinc\n\n3%\n\n0.3 mg\n\nOther constituentsQuantityWater91.8 g†Percentages estimated using US recommendations for adults,[4] except for potassium, which is estimated based on expert recommendation from the National Academies.[5]\n\nRaw banana peppers contain 92% water, 5% carbohydrates, and negligible fat and protein (table). They are rich sources of vitamin C, containing 100% of the Daily Value (DV) in a 100 gram reference amount (table). Vitamin B6 is present in substantial content of 28% DV, with no other micronutrients in appreciable amounts (table).\n\nUses\n\n[edit]\n\nCulinary\n\n[edit]\n\nPickled banana peppers are commonly sold sliced and used to garnish pizzas, sandwiches and Greek salads.[6]\n\nPickled and stuffed banana peppers are common inclusions on antipasto bars filled with prosciutto and/or cheese.\n\nStuffed banana peppers are served warm with a variety of Italian sausage and cheeses.\n\nChopped or diced banana peppers are used in many relishes and salsas to add sweetness with other peppers providing heat.\n\nBanana peppers may be jellied along with other hot green peppers such as jalapeños.\n\nBhaji, a snack food.
