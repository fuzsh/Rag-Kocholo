        "text": "British band\n\nHi-Tension are a British band based in North West London, and are pioneers of Brit funk.[1] with the original line-up being Paul Philips (guitarist), Jeff Guishard (percussionist & vocalist), David Joseph (keyboard player and lead vocals), Paul McLean (lead guitar and vocals) Ken Joseph (bass player) Patrick McLean (Saxophonist & vocalist), David Reid and Paapa Mensah (both drummers)[2] and Leroy Williams. Hi-Tension originally performed as 'Hot Wax' but due to a legal technicality, they changed the band name to Hi-Tension in 1977. They had hits with the songs \"Hi Tension\" and \"British Hustle\", both top were 20 hits in the UK.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1971, the group started as Hott Wax with original members being Paul Philips, Lloyd Philips, David Joseph and Ken Joseph. In 1975, Phil Fearon (later a member of the bands Galaxy and Kandidate) joined as a member of the group but had later left by 1977. After this, David Joseph recruited other members that lived in the area to join the group.[3]\n\nIn 1978 they released their first single aptly named \"Hi Tension\" that peaked to No. 13 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1978.[4] They then released a second single titled \"British Hustle\" which eclipsed their first single and peaked to No. 8 in late 1978.[4] In the same year a short film was subsequently made about British soul music called British Hustle.[1][5]\n\nBy 1981, David Reid, Patrick McLean and Paul McLean left the band. The remaining members of Hi Tension continued and secured another recording contract with EMI records. Whilst touring they recruited Courtney Pine as a session player, playing saxophone during their tour. Subsequently, Paul Philips left the band. From 1983 to 1987 David Joseph secured a solo career and accomplished two hit songs: \"You Can't Hide (Your Love from Me)\" and \"Let's Live It Up (Nite People)\".[6]\n\nIn 1984, Ken Joseph, Leroy Williams and Jeffrey Guishard remained resilient and secured a further recording contract with Streetwave Records and released the singles \"Rat Race\" and \"You Make Me Happy\" in 1984. The latter single was written, produced and arranged by David Pic Conley of the band Surface whom later released a cover version of the song under the title \"Happy\" for their debut album in 1986.[3]\n\nIn 2014, Paul McLean reformed Hi Tension with four original members, Paul Philips, Jeffrey Guishard, Paapa Mensah and his brother Patrick McLean to headline and perform at the Summer Soulstice Festival in Barnet, London.[3]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Label UK\n\n[7][8] 1978 Hi-Tension Island Records 54 1983 The Joys of Life[9]\n\n(only solo album of David Joseph) —\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Best of David Joseph & Hi-Tension (1993)\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Song Label UK\n\n[7][8] 1978 \"Hi Tension\" Island Records 13 \"British Hustle\" 8 \"Peace on Earth\" — \"Autumn Love\" / \"Unspoken\" — 1979 \"Funktified\" — \"There's a Reason\" — 1981 \"We've Got the Funk\" EMI — 1982 \"How D'you Feel\" — 1984 \"Rat Race\" Streetwave 83 \"You Make Me Happy\" — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n\nDavid Joseph solo singles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Song Label UK\n\n[6] 1983 \"You Can't Hide (Your Love from Me)\" Island Records 13 \"Let's Live It Up (Nite People)\" 26 \"Be a Star\" 81 1984 \"Joys of Life\" 61 1987 \"No Turning Back\" 4th & Broadway 85\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
