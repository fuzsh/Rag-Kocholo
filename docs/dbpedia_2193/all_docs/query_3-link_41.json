        "text": "HUNTINGTON BEACH – He is a living bronze statue, a member of surfing’s Hall of Fame and Walk of Fame, a man who won a world championship in real life and later played a surfer’s body double in a movie.\n\nSo Peter Townend is an expert when he talks about a sport that, to some of us, is foreign enough to have an accent.\n\n“To be a surfer, you need three things,” Townend says. “You need a board. You need wax. You need a pair of trunks because we don’t surf naked.”\n\nAnd thank goodness for that. Otherwise, imagine the demand for sunscreen.\n\nToday, we are at the International Surfing Museum, a place dedicated to a centuries-old sport that still arrives fresh daily in a series of unending waves.\n\nWe’re here to learn about an aspect of surfing rarely discussed on the sports pages, even this week as the U.S. Open of Surfing eclipses this town.\n\nWe’re talking about the one thing – the only thing – that can come between a hardcore surfer and his board. Wax.\n\nSeriously. The stuff really matters, otherwise, instead of “We’re waxing down our surfboards…” The Beach Boys might have opined “We’re sunscreening down our pale buns…“\n\n“There isn’t one guy who’s ever gone surfing who hasn’t waxed his board,” Townend says. “Waxing your board is just part of the culture. Wax is a slice of a surfer’s life, from the day you start.”\n\nWax is what gives the surfer traction, meaning it’s only as important as tires are to Dale Earnhardt Jr., as Nikes are to Kobe Bryant. Wax is so vital that it can permit a mortal like Kelly Slater to walk with confidence on water.\n\nThis significance is being acknowledged by the museum, which just unveiled an exhibit called “Wax On.” It is a collection of 1,000 bars, from “Honey Wax” to “Foot Suckers” to “Sticky Feet,” a presentation that includes one bar purchased for $150 and another that weighs 100 pounds.\n\nDave Reynolds, a director at the museum and the man behind the display, called it “just a crazy idea that I had.” The exhibit is expected to remain in place for the rest of the year.\n\nAsked what surfers did before the introduction of wax, Reynolds, who, minutes before this interview was surfing, says, “They slipped off their boards a lot.”\n\nWax comes in a rainbow of colors and a bouquet of scents, the most popular ones being coconut (beach-like, makes sense), root beer (refreshing, but makes less sense) and bubble gum (huh?).\n\nReynolds makes his own wax and has produced one version that smells like bacon and another like beer. Bacon and beer – an aromatic combination that also can be found late night at the Denny’s on Beach Boulevard. One of Reynolds’ waxes glows in the dark and another is made using hemp.\n\nYou’ve probably seen wax being sold in stores, and, if you’re anything like us, were slightly confused the first time you noticed “Mr. Zogs Sex Wax.” Don’t worry. The product has everything to do with surfing and nothing to do with sex.\n\nOne day in junior high, Reynolds was sent home because he was wearing a “Sex Wax” T-shirt.\n\n“They wouldn’t even let me turn it inside out,” he says.\n\nThe exhibit here also includes examples of wax being applied to turn surfboards into works of art. One board features a meticulous rendering of “The Last Supper.” It is, frankly, a moving tribute, and we regularly attend church.\n\nNow, before you start thinking of this as being blasphemous, remember that everyone in that original picture was wearing flip-flops.\n\nIt seems wax is just another thing to be shared in a culture that is all about being one – one with the waves, one with the board, one with the experience.\n\n“We have this common bond, all of us do,” Townend, 59, says. “It’s the thrill of the ride. Once you’ve done it, I’ve done it or you’ve done it or somebody else has done it, everybody knows what it is. It’s a bond that’s really rare.”\n\nOne of the founding fathers of professional surfing, Townend also was instrumental in establishing the U.S. Open of Surfing.\n\nThis week, just a few blocks from this museum, the event is rising again like a wave does, swelling larger and larger with each passing day, rolling and rolling until finally crashing on the sand in a beautiful, sudsy celebration of life.\n\n“We felt that surfers could be like tennis players or other pro athletes,” says Townend, who minutes after this interview would be surfing. “It was our dream to surf in front of big crowds and get paid lots of money, and that dream’s a reality now. When I walk down there, I’m proud that the dream we had came true.”\n\nHe should be proud. So, too, should Reynolds and the rest of the folks at the International Surfing Museum, who taught a sportswriter who sometimes loses his balance just surfing the Web about something as obscure as wax.\n\nThankfully, since surfers face that requirement concerning trunks, wax is all anyone will be exposed to today."
