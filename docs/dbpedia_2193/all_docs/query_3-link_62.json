        "text": "There are several factors to consider when deciding how much wax you’ll need to purchase to finish a project. We recommend the regular 2.25oz bars for smaller projects such as waxing caps, shoes, bags, etc. The large 5oz bar is best suited for projects such as jackets, pants, etc. As a general rule of thumb, plan on using more wax to treat un-waxed or oiled fabrics. Factory-waxed fabrics are already saturated with wax, so will not absorb as much as an untreated fabric. Also consider the nap or weave of the fabric. Thick, unwaxed canvas (such as a Carhartt jacket) will absorb a lot of wax for the first application, but will require less in subsequent applications.\n\nOur Wax Bars and Fabric Dressing are fairly similar however the Fabric Dressing has a higher proportion of oils to wax. The higher oil content helps the wax to melt down faster, and is also what makes it ideal for re-proofing factory waxed or oiled garments in the traditional manner. Because our Fabric Dressing is melted down when applied, it permeates the fabric and yields a more factory-waxed and matte appearance. This is ideal for multi-layered coats and jackets, or for re-proofing factory-oiled fabrics.\n\nOur Wax Bars are excellent for one-sided waxing because it creates a seal on the top layer of the fabric. It’s ideal for hats, shoes, bags, and jackets where you wouldn’t want waxed fabric in direct contact with your skin. Our bars are also great for quickly re-proofing factory waxed and oiled garments. Our Wax Bars are really easy to apply, and just need to be rubbed directly onto the fabric. The appearance of this method will yield a really great look that will usually darken the fabric and give it a leathery, coated appearance.\n\nFirst off it's important to determine what it is that you smell: Right after waxing an item you might notice the scent of cedar wood (natural preservative/anti-microbial properties) and/or a waxy a smell. This is perfectly normal and fades away while the wax cures over the coming days and/or weeks. The other type of odor is more closely related to body odor and can occur after several months of wearing your item. Fabrics that are treated with wax become much less breathable than when they are unwaxed. Over time, moisture trapped inside an item can become home to odor-causing bacteria. This problem is easily solved by spraying the inside of your item with ourBotanical Enzyme Odor Eliminator. This spray begins to digest and break down odor-causing bacteria almost immediately while freshening with all natural peppermint essential oils and can be used as often as needed while not disturbing the wax coating that has already been applied to your item.\n\nOur Fabric Dressing (And also Fabric Wax Bars) will work on most any type of fabric. However, because our wax is made from all-natural ingredients, it will generally bond best with natural fibers (cotton, hemp, etc.) It is also very effective on blended fabrics where the proportion of natural fiber to synthetic is in the majority. Nylon is a synthetic fiber so if you are going to use our products we recommend to always test in a discrete location to ensure desired results will be achieved.\n\nWaxing fabric will darken the color of a fabric and give it a light shine. A distressed appearance and color variance is typical, so we always recommend testing our wax on a small inconspicuous area before waxing a larger area to ensure that the desired appearance will be achieved.\n\nBe sure to check out our Waxed Canvas Swatch Gallery to see how a wide variety of canvas in varying weights and colors look once they've been treated with Otter Wax.\n\nOur Fabric Wax and Fabric Dressing are semi-permanent wax applications. This means that our waxes will remain bonded with fabric indefinitely, but may require a periodic touch-up in order to maintain its waterproofing ability. We recommend reapplying our waxes once a year, however certain \"high-stress\" areas of a garment, such as the hood of a raincoat or the knees of a pant may require a touching up more often.\n\nOur waterproofing waxes also act as a protective barrier against dirt, dust, and debris. Using a natural bristle brush is a great way to keep an item clean and also helps to smooth away the wax creases that may appear in \"high-stress\" areas.\n\nUnpleasant odors originating from waxed canvas are caused by bacteria that thrive in warm, dark, and damp environments. You can keep your waxed item smelling and feeling fresh by spraying the un-waxed side of with our Botanical Enzyme Waxed Canvas Odor Eliminator.\n\nIf you need to remove dirt, mud, or stubborn stains from the surface of your waxed item we only recommend spot-treating. We recommend using our Waxed Canvas Spot Cleaner only on the affected area. This is because the cleaning process will break down and remove the wax coating. Once the spot-cleaned area has completely dried, all you need to do is re-wax that area and allow to cure for 24~48 hours before first use.\n\nIf spot cleaning the outside of a waxed item, dip a rag or soft-bristle brush into a bowl of warm water (ape. 12oz) mixed with and 2 tablespoons of our Waxed Canvas Spot Cleaner and gently scrub the affected area until stain is removed. Allow cleaned area to completely dry, and reapply wax as needed.\n\nWe typically don't recommend washing an entire garment, but if you absolutely have to, fill a large bucket with cold water, and 4 tablespoons of our Waxed Canvas Spot Cleaner. Turn item inside out and submerge completely. While item is submerged, use a rag or soft-bristle brush to gently scrub the fabric. When finished, remove and allow water to drip back into bucket. Do not bend or twist fabric to remove excess water. Keep the garment turned inside-out and hang in a warm and dry place. If you are cleaning a waxed canvas bag or a pair of shoes, you can speed the drying time by stuffing your item with crumbled newspaper or paper towels. Once the item is completely dry, turn right-side out and reapply wax to any areas where necessary.\n\nMink Oil is a refined skin fat harvested from the slaughter of the incredibly adorable and cuddly mink, which just so happens to be a close relative of the otter. It is most-often imported from mink farms in China and blended with petroleum distillates to stretch the resource. It’s effectiveness as a leather conditioner stems from its high concentration of palmitoleic acid, an excellent source of nourishment for skin, hair, and nails. Our Leather Salve and Leather Oil both have high concentrations of palmitoleic acid sourced exclusively from botanical sources.\n\nIf the sofa isn't too dirty you can vacuum the creases, wipe it down with a warm damp cloth, then apply the Leather Oil. Click Here to view our how to care for leather furniture guide! If the sofa is really dirty and really dry you can clean with the Saddle Soap and condition with the Leather Salve. Then follow the steps above to maintain the leather. Click Here to view our guide on how to clean and condition older dry leather. The results are so great! I love this guide!\n\nIn most cases (depending on the condition of your leather item) we recommend using our leather care products in the following order:\n\nSaddle Soap: Use to remove any stains, dirt, or mud from the surface of the leather.\n\nLeather Salve: Use to deeply condition heavily weathered leather that is beginning to show signs of dry cracking.\n\nLeather Oil: Use on a regular basis to keep leather looking and feeling its very best by maintaining proper hydration and nourishment.\n\nBoot Wax: Use as an added layer of waterproofing protection after utilizing any of the other products mentioned above. Boot Wax is best for leather items that will be used outdoors such as boots, gloves, and hats. We do not recommend treating indoor furniture with Boot Wax.\n\nYou do not need to use all of our leather care products every time you would like to treat your leather. Each product can be used separately and independently of the rest depending on the condition of your leather item. We always recommend treating the entire item in order to maintain even coloration and a uniform appearance.\n\nPlease note that we can only cancel orders if we receive the cancellation request before the order has shipped.
