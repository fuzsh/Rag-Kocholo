        "text": "Hi Mo,\n\nHere are a few encouraging thoughts to get you back into using sealing wax.\n\nFirst, I suggest you do some practice seals on a piece of paper, just to get your technique down. If you're worried about wasting wax for this, then you don't have enough wax, and I advise you to get some more.\n\nIf your wax impressions aren't deep enough, make sure you're melting a large enough puddle of wax to fully utilize the surface of the seal.\n\nAfter melting the wax, shape the pool with the end of your wax stick into your desired shape (oval, circle, square — similar to shape of your seal). This should just be a quick stir to smooth it out. Don't take too much time with this or your wax will harden before you've made the impression.\n\nApply your vapor barrier if desired (exhale on the seal, or touch it to an ice cube, or touch it to a wet sponge). Again, this should be quick.\n\nPress firmly and hold the seal on the wax until it cools a bit — maybe 15 or 20 seconds. I don't time it, but the point is to not be too eager to lift the seal. Waiting while the wax cools should avoid chances of warm wax collapsing back into itself; plus, it's easier to lift the seal after the wax has cooled.\n\nI hope this helps. In my opinion, slight imperfections add to the charm of using sealing wax. I don't want my wax seals to look perfect, as though a machine made them, but I don't want messy blobs either. Practice, practice, practice.\n\nFor a clear imprint, you need to wait for the wax to be semi-solid. If it's too soft, the imprint is all mushy. If it's too hard, the imprint isn't distinct enough.\n\nAfter melting the wax, wait about 10-15 seconds before making the impression.\n\nAlso, keep the stamp cool. Lick it before you stick it. A film of moisture will prevent the hot wax from sticking to the seal and this will give you an easier time of it. And believe me, digging solidified wax out of a sealing-stamp is a REAL pain. Take it from one who knows!!\n\nAargh, I have no sealing wax at all at home! Disaster - nothing to test with! Have ordered some Herbin's as that is more easily available in UK than the Gargoyle and will just have to possess my soul in patience in the meantime.\n\nHowever I have decided that should I ever own a pub/inn a great name for it would be The Huff and Puddle. All pen fanciers welcome of course, and I think there would really have to be a guestbook to sign (bring your own pen with preferred choice of ink) and to then affix your seal in the approved manner. Happy days!\n\nMo\n\nThis is slightly off topic, but I figured it would be better to ask here as opposed to making a new thread about it.\n\nIf one wants to use a letter as a seal, is it more common for him/her to use the first letter of his/her first name or last name? Is one method used more than the other? I assume this is a \"personal preference\" type thing but I just wanted to satisfy my curiosity.\n\nI am not aware of any 'protocol' about which initial to use ..... perhaps, if you've signed with just your first name, it would be more appropriate to use that initial, as it's less 'formal'?\n\nThat said, I tend to use B rather than R, because the first name of one of my frequent correspondents begins witha 'B'.\n\nI use my signet ring quite often, because it is unique (made for me), gives a nice deep imprint, and is symmetrical, so doesn't come-out 'reversed!\n\nIf I have several letters to write, I sometimes use a small pot of ice-water, otherwise just a quick lick! (Breathing on it doesn't work too well in our warm, dry climate!)\n\nBy the way, I found that Herbin's 'Violet' wax is not quite as good as the other colours I have (2 reds, and gold are those I use most). I don't get such a sharp imprint with Violet.\n\nEdited April 7, 2011 by rogerb\n\nThe wax arrived today - I used a torch lighter, I huffed and puddled and it worked! VERY happy with the result, so thank you all for the help and advice, and in particular Chris and Rena. Fingers crossed I'll have attached some images here so you can see the fruits of your labours!\n\nAnd - because we all care about the details:\n\nPen: Parker 51 Medium nib\n\nInk: Diamine Damson (it was what was in the pen at the time)\n\nPaper: Bought in a great shop called Chimanlal Paper Culture in Mumbai last year\n\nWax: J Herbin's Supple Wax Bleu Nuit\n\nStamp: My initial, Past Times\n\nBest,\n\nMo\n\nPS - Sorry about the writing, love all the stuff to do with writing, but the penmanship isn't really of the same quality I'm afraid..."
