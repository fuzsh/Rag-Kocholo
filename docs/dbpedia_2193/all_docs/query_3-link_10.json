        "text": "Whether you’re just starting out in your waxing career, or just want to expand your product knowledge, knowing the difference between soft wax and hard wax is essential to giving clients their best results.\n\nAs you know, different wax formulas serve a variety of purposes, and in the end, you’ll want to be able to meet any need that regular or walk-in clients alike might have. Knowing the ins and outs of which wax formulas will work best for each skin, hair, and service type, will let you cover these needs while continually mastering new waxing products.\n\nIn this article, we explore whether hard wax or soft wax will be the best for you and your clients’ services. We’ll discuss each of the wax type’s characteristics and which service types they work best on, as well as the difference between hard and soft wax hair removal.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy You Should Know the Difference Between Hard and Soft Wax\n\nHard Wax vs. Soft Wax at a Glance\n\nWhat is Hard Wax?\n\nHow to Wax with Hard Wax\n\nWhat is Soft Wax?\n\nHow to Wax with Soft Wax\n\nHard Wax vs. Soft Wax for Services\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhy You Should Know the Difference Between Hard and Soft Wax\n\nIt seems like it may be easier to keep one wax type brewing for every service—and you’d be right. It is easier to use a one-wax-type-fits-all approach and call it a day, but it doesn’t give you a leg up on the client experience, nor does it allow you to cater to all skin types.\n\nKnowing the difference between soft wax and hard wax is just a small part of waxing, being an expert in both hard or soft wax offers the following benefits:\n\nThe more you know about as many formulas as possible, the more it can position you as an ultimate wax authority.\n\nIt provides your clients with a more tailor-made experience for their various needs.\n\nMastering both wax types and different formulas helps you step out of your comfort zone to continually challenge yourself.\n\nThe best waxers know their wax formulas from the inside out, and know the best way to meet any skin type, hair type, or client request that comes into their salon. They know their melting points, consistencies, and every removal technique. Knowing the type of wax to use, the right temperature to use it at, and how to apply it at the right moment to create the perfect waxing session can meet each client’s specific needs.\n\nHard Wax vs. Soft Wax at a Glance\n\nThe most significant difference between hard wax and soft wax is that one method requires no wax strips, and the other does. Of course, that’s not all; here, we’ll give you an at-a-glance breakdown of hard wax vs. soft wax. But you canfind your wax in a variety of formulas that best fit your style and technique on our page. Remember, thereis a wax for that!\n\nStripless Hard Wax\n\nOften less painful than other waxing methods\n\nLess Mess\n\nDoesn’t stick to your skin\n\nExcellent at grabbing shorter hair\n\nIdeal for working in smaller sections and areas like underarms, and facial, Brazilian, and bikini waxing\n\nCan be applied twice on the same spot when necessary\n\nCan be applied thicker than soft wax\n\nSoft Strip Wax\n\nAdheres well to micro-tiny and fine hair\n\nIdeal for larger body parts\n\nGives maximum spreadability\n\nExcellent for speed waxing\n\nHas a longer setting time\n\nExfoliating\n\nWorks well on short to long hairs\n\nApplied in thin layers\n\nWhat is Hard Wax?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between hard vs. soft wax, you’ll also need to know which warmer is best for your formulas.\n\nThe best professional wax warmers to use with hard wax are explicitly made for loose hard wax because their wax wells are wider. They usually have fitted lids to insulate the warming wax better and keep it at the desired temperature. Most Starpil Professional Wax Warmers, depending on the hard wax formula and environment, get the hard wax’s initial meltdown at 90°C (194°F). Its optimal thick, honey-like consistency is reached by reducing the temperature to between 70°C - 80°C (158°F - 176° F).\n\nAll Starpil hard wax formulas have low-temperature applications to inhibit burning, but as with any wax for hair removal, test your wax’s temperature before application. Apply film hard wax in the direction of hair growth. Let it cool for a few seconds, hold the skin taut, then firmly peel off the wax, pulling it back in the opposite direction of hair growth.\n\nWho is the Ideal Client for Hard Wax?\n\nSince there are so many hard wax varieties, you are bound to find the perfect formula to represent your clientele. All normal skin and hair types, from fine to coarse, can benefit from this wax.\n\nHard wax is also a go-to choice for sensitive to hypersensitive skin types. Even those with suspiciously short hairs could make the cut for a hard waxing service.\n\nFor clients with especially sensitive skin or with especially fine hairs, we recommend the following formulas:\n\nCoral Film Hard Wax\n\nThis detoxifying wax is a crystalline formula that reduces redness, irritation, and promotes skin regeneration while locking in on fine hairs for complete removal.\n\nStarsoft Film Hard Wax\n\nThis luxurious formula is ideal for hypersensitive or aged skin, and nourishes and desensitizes skin while providing amazing results.\n\nPink Film Hard Wax\n\nThis wax is a staple go-to for waxers who have many clients with sensitive skin. This creamy hard wax formula grips even the tiniest, fine hairs at the root while being gentle on skin.\n\nFor clients with coarser hair types, these formulas should be your go-to:\n\nBlue Film Hard Wax\n\nThis wax is unparalleled in its ability to remove even the tiniest or hard to reach hairs, and spreads over large areas without breaking or cracking.\n\nBlack Film Hard Wax\n\nIdeal for full body waxing, this hybrid formula combines creamy and crystalline properties to remove coarse hairs from hard to reach areas.\n\nHow to Wax with Hard Wax?\n\nTo wax with hard wax, you’ll want to start by making sure that you’re using the best hard wax for your client’s needs, and that you’re working with the correct temperatures for the specific formula you’re using.\n\nPay attention to the environment you’re in and the difference it can make whether or not you’re using a lid while warming your wax. Test your wax prior to waxing your client. Before you wax, be sure to use the proper pre-wax care products for your client’s skin type and use the right size wax spatula for the service you’re performing.\n\nREAD:How to Use Hard Wax Like A Pro: The Complete Guide\n\nHard Wax Application\n\nSpread hard wax in an even strip in the direction of hair growth, and be mindful of your thickness, pressure, and how you create the lip (the part of the strip you will pull from).\n\nAll of these will dictate how well your removal will be. If there are gaps or uneven lines at the edges of your strip, feel free to add more wax to make it clean and straight. Give adequate time for wax to fully set to avoid tearing.\n\nHard Wax Removal\n\nKeep the skin as stabilized as possible when removing your strip, meaning skin needs to be anchored so it doesn’t move with the hair as it’s pulled. Hold skin taut and remove strip parallel to the skin in the opposite direction of the hair growth. After removing the strip, press firmly onto the area to dissipate the pain. Follow with the best post-wax care products according to the client’s skin type.\n\nAfter your wax sets:\n\nFlick up or pinch the lip between your pointer finger and thumb or waxing spatula.\n\nHolding the skin taut with your free hand, remove the wax strip quickly in the opposite direction of the hair growth.\n\nApply pressure immediately on your client’s skin with your free hand to relieve any discomfort they may feel upon removal.\n\nHard Wax Learning Curve\n\nHard wax users need to understand the timing of allowing the wax to cool on the skin before removal.\n\nThough this wax type has a great spread, it works best in smaller areas for the most control.\n\nWhat is the Best Hard Wax Brand?\n\nWe have some pretty hard-hitting evidence that Starpil Wax is the best wax brand on the market. But no matter which hard wax brand you use, always choose a brand based on your fellow pro’s reviews, their experience working with professional salons and their wholesale accessibility.\n\nIf you’re a pro, the products you use and carry are connected to a company. It’s important that you enjoy working with that company. Looking for professional benefits?

Soft wax is awesome for all hair types, no matter how thick or fine because it envelops strands and the dead layer of skin with a tight grip, giving a perfect pull almost every time.\n\nWe recommend Starsoft Soft Wax for your most delicate clients’ skin and Blue Soft Wax or Pink Soft Wax for almost everyone else!\n\nSoft Wax Learning Curve\n\nSince even the best soft wax is exfoliating, you need to pay special attention to those with hypersensitive skin types and how hot your soft wax temperature is.\n\nHard Wax vs. Soft Wax for Services\n\nWe weigh in on which services go better with hard or soft wax.\n\nWhich is Better: Hard Wax or Soft wax for Eyebrows?\n\nThe eyebrows are often a difficult area for many waxers because of the precision needed to create the perfect shape.\n\nWhile soft wax is fantastic for facial waxing services due to how it removes microscopic hairs, you need to be mindful of how close to the brow it’s applied and leave space for how it may spread under a non-woven removal strip.\n\nEven though hard wax can get even the tiniest hairs, not all hard wax formulas can get those microscopic hairs like soft wax can.\n\nHowever, hard wax comes in many different formulas that work perfectly with a potentially ultra-sensitive area and you don’t have to worry about it spreading; where you place it is where it stays.\n\nThe Verdict: Soft or Hard Wax for Eyebrows?\n\nWe say that both Pink Soft Wax or Pink Film Hard Wax would both be an excellent choice, but Starsoft Film Hard Wax might just give them both a run for their money.\n\nThe Verdict?\n\nYou can call it a draw but we can’t forget about Starsoft and Calendula Roll-On Wax Cartridges. They provide exceptional calming ingredients for sensitive skin types, while still offering a fast application.\n\nREAD: The Complete Guide to Leg Waxing\n\nIs Hard or Soft Wax for the Bikini Area Better?\n\nGiven the delicate nature of the bikini line, we love all of the ultra-sensitive options available. Of course, we love how no hair can escape being removed once it’s covered in soft wax, making a bikini wax service seem to go faster.\n\nFor bikini area waxing, we’re going to go with hard wax. It is extremely gentle on delicate, intimate areas. Additionally, its accuracy makes it an easy choice for waxing on the bikini line. For ideal bikini waxing, look for Starsoft or Pink Film Hard Wax.\n\nWould You Use Hard Wax vs. Soft Wax for Brazilian Waxing?\n\nLet’s cut to the chase: when it comes to using hard wax vs. soft wax on a Brazilian waxing service, we would recommend hard wax as being the way to go.\n\nSince you have to get into delicate and especially sensitive areas, using soft wax and non-woven strips doesn’t provide as easy or as straightforward of an experience as hard wax does. Hard wax also limits the amount of touching and, in this case, can be faster than soft wax.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs you can see, both hard and soft wax hair removal have their merits. Both have so many of their own benefits, that we think having both formulas available at your salon can be a viable solution for any issue your clients can throw at you. If you know the strengths and weaknesses of each formula, you can harness their exact uses and benefits to meet your specific waxing style. Master them both and you’ll be at the head of the waxing game.\n\nWhat do you think? Which formulas do you think are best for facial or Brazilian Waxing?
