        "text": "There has never been a better time to be in beauty, with women spending more than ever on treating themselves to look and feel their very best.\n\nWhether you want control of your own destiny and be a full-time entrepreneur, or work some extra hours around your usual job, an extra-preneur, or enjoy time out from being a busy Mum, Mum-preneur, the flexibility of working for yourself in beauty, is easier than ever and its an amazing fun industry to be in.\n\nWith Accredited “Guild of Professional Beauty Therapist” Courses that are recognised by all major insurance companies, you’ve definitely come to the right brand, Sienna X has set up over 23,000 people up in beauty since we started in 2004 and having started the business from an idea, we have learnt a few things along the way that we can share with you, to help you along your “living the dream” journey.\n\nThe Sienna X Beginner Wax training course is a bespoke 2-day course designed to equip you with the knowledge and confidence to start offering professional, full body Waxing treatments.\n\nThis easy-to-follow course is suitable for absolute beginners and allows you to study online at home before you undertake the professional, hands on, 2 day course with our friendly, expert trainers to boost your confidence in waxing.\n\nWith hard work and a lot of fun you will soon be reaping the rewards and with our training, you will learn all the tricks of the trade to help you keep your clients loyal and returning.\n\nWith our Highest awarded CPD points beauty training and support, your go-getter attitude, and the award winning products and equipment from Sienna X, you can be up and running in a matter of a few weeks!\n\nCrack open the champagne? A surprise holiday? A great night out? A present “just for you”? However you choose to celebrate your success as a Sienna X beauty therapist – one thing’s for sure. You’ll enjoy the work as much as you enjoy the rewards!\n\nWell it depends on how much you are prepared to work; it really has no limits.\n\nDepending on your area and the types of waxes you are going to offer, it can be anything from £15 -£44 + for a treatment.\n\nFor instance, for a full leg treatment with warm wax, you could charge £28-£39 for a treatment, or for a Brazilian wax with hot wax, you could charge £32-£44.\n\nRemember it’s rare to find cheap and good and you have to work twice as hard to earn your money back, better to offer the best service and charge a little more, build a rapport with your clients, make the treatment all about them. We all have so little money left after we have paid the bills, that when we treat ourselves, we want it all about us. So, keep your conversations about them, note any family occasions or holidays they have coming up etc on their consultation card, so that you can remember to mention it next time. It’s all about the little things.\n\nUse the Wax Calculator to see how much it’s possible to earn…\n\nWe have kits to suit all your needs for setting up your new waxing business!\n\nAt the very least you will need:\n\nTraining\n\nAny type of waxing treatment is very easy when you know how, it’s also very easy to make it uncomfortable to your client if you get it wrong, so always make sure you’ve been trained in Sienna X Waxing before starting up your new treatment.\n\nSienna X Wax\n\nA LUXURIOUS WAX RANGE for professionals looking to offer premium treatments with less pain.\n\nThe Sienna X wax range includes both hot and vegan warm waxes, with non-sticky formulations that leave no residue.\n\nIf you’re looking to make your waxing treatments stand out from the crowd and build a loyal customer base then then the Sienna X range of waxes are right choices for you!\n\nThe Professional Touch\n\nIt’s all in the preparation and application, we use specially formulated pre/post products that give your brow treatments a luxury touch, with minimal to no discomfort.\n\nProvide your clients with a luxury treatment with these expert Pre and Post waxing products.\n\nProfessional Accessories\n\nFirst impressions count; make sure your treatment area stands out and looks professional with this easy to carry, lightweight display stand, perfect for neatly storing and displaying your pre and post products, spatulas and strips.\n\nIdeal for transferring your treatment equipment from top to bottom shelf in seconds, as and when needed.\n\nThe modern, Sienna X branded, digital heaters, with their luxury design also look great on your waxing trolley and is a fantastic space-saver.\n\nMobile Kit Bag\n\nEnsure you carry all your equipment safely from home to home, logo’d with Sienna X to go along with your uniform for that Pro look.\n\nShort answer: this could be anything between £6 and £44 +\n\nA.The true answer really depends on whether you are in a salon; operating your own home-based business; or offering a mobile wax business.\n\nIt also depends on:\n\nArea of the wax\n\nHow much you charge for a wax can depend on the size and complexity of the area you are waxing.\n\nFor instance, for a small upper lip wax, you may only charge £6, however for a similarly small treatment such as a brow shape, you may charge £10 as this takes a little more concentration and time to get right.\n\nDepending on the size of the area you are waxing, you may also want to charge more as this can take up more time. For instance, for a half leg wax treatment, you may only charge £15, however for a full leg wax treatment, you may decide to double the cost of the treatment to £30 as it may take double the time to do.\n\nThe type of wax you are using (if this is hot wax or warm)\n\nOffer your clients the option of either a warm wax, or a hot wax for an additional extra.\n\nSome clients, particularly clients which are new to waxing will prefer the Gold Film Hot Wax for large areas such as legs, rather than warm wax, as this can be slightly less painful. As Hot wax is a little more expensive than warm wax and can take a little longer, you can justify putting the price up on these types of wax treatments.\n\nYour geographical location\n\nDepending on your geographical location, you may also decide to adapt your pricing to match the standard of living cost in your location. For instance, a wax treatment in the south of the country would be expected to be more than a wax treatment in the north of the country.\n\nDo your research and look how others in your area are charging for their wax treatments.\n\nRemember, as the Sienna X range of waxes are luxury and high quality, you can justify charging a little more for your treatments than many of your competitors using lower quality waxes.\n\nUse the Wax Calculator to see how much it’s possible to earn…"
