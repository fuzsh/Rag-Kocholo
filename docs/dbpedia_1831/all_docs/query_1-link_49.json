        "text": "In the spring of 1918, the wooded area known as Belleau Wood, about 30 miles northest of Paris, was a quiet sanctuary of graceful old-growth trees, a hunting preserve for well-off Parisians, teeming with birds and game. Despite its proximity to the front, it had been largely untouched by the war. That all changed in June.\n\nWhen the battle at Belleau Wood was over, the ground was soaked with the blood of nearly 10,000 American casualties, including more than 1,800 killed, and an unknown number of Germans. The U.S. Marine Corps suffered more casualties in that battle than it did in its entire history to that point.\n\nThe battle was three weeks of carnage that left the once-beautiful preserve a scorched ruin, its trees splintered or uprooted. Only the stone walls of the hunting lodge that marked the northern edge of the forest remained standing when the smoke cleared.\n\nActs of extraordinary heroism were commonplace. \"Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?\" 1st Sgt. Dan Daly famously yelled to his attacking Marines as he urged them into German lines. The lines would come to epitomize Marine Corps espirit for generations to come.\n\nThe battle was a result of a major German offensive launched that spring. The Bolshevik revolution had taken Russia out of the war, which allowed Germany to move troops from the eastern front to the west.\n\nThe offensive was working and by June 1 the Germans had moved into Belleau Wood. Capturing Paris looked possible. If successful, it would almost certainly have led to an Allied defeat.\n\nArmy Gen. John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, ordered U.S. troops — including a brigade of untested Marines — to blunt the German advance.\n\nPershing was wary of the Marines. Before World War I, the Marine Corps was a relatively small force that specialized in protecting U.S. interests abroad or performing security duties on military bases. Pershing was skeptical of their ability to serve as a major ground force going up against the German army.\n\nFor the same reason, the Marines were itching to get into the fight, eager to prove they were more than just a constabulary force with fancy uniforms. “This was a defining moment for the Marine Corps,” said Charles Neimeyer, director of the corps' history division in Quantico, Va.\n\nRushing into the breach, the Marines encountered exhausted French soldiers heading in the other direction. French officers told the Marines they, too, should turn around.\n\nThe Marines dismissed the idea. “Retreat, hell,” one Marine is alleged to have said. “We just got here.”\n\nFor weeks, the fighting went back and forth as Marines attacked the German lines repeatedly, crossing an open wheat field that was raked by machine-gun fire coming from well-protected German positions in the woods.\n\nTheir marksmanship training paid off, as they picked off Germans from great distances. When command broke down, junior officers and noncommissioned officers stepped into provide leadership — a rare occurrence in most armies of the time.\n\nBut it was their tenacity that stood out above all else.\n\n“The only thing that drove those Marines through those woods in the face of such resistance as they met was their individual, elemental guts, plus the hardening of the training through which they had gone,” wrote Lt. Col. Frederick May Wise, the commander of 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines.\n\nOn June 26, 1918, Maj. Maurice Shearer sent a message: \"Woods now entirely U.S. Marine Corps.\"\n\nThe battle was over.\n\nThe battle of Belleau Wood did not win the war, but it prevented the Allies from losing it, said Alan Axelrod, author of Miracle at Belleau Wood: The Birth of the Modern U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nAfter three weeks of combat, sometimes at the tip of a bayonet, the Marines had pushed the Germans back and cut off their path to Paris.\n\nThe battle would become an essential part of Marine Corps history, almost as iconic as the flag raising at Iwo Jima would become less than 30 years later.\n\n“It really is fair to compare the Marines to the Spartans at Thermopylae,” Axelrod said in an interview, referring to the battle between Greeks and Persians in 480 B.C. “A very small group of dedicated warriors stopped a superior force.”\n\nBut the battle was significant for another reason. It established the Marines as a major force capable of sustained ground operations. The Marines had been assigned security duties in garrison and were often referred to dismissively as “bellhops and stevedores,” because of their sharp uniforms and work associated with naval ports, Axelrod said.\n\nThe battle would have made it into the history books anyway, but thanks to Floyd Gibbons, a swashbuckling war reporter for the Chicago Tribune, the Marines' exploits were plastered across the nation’s front pages.\n\nPershing had an ironclad rule that no individual units were to be identified in reporters' dispatches from the front. His aim was to prevent rivalry within the American Expeditionary Force.\n\nGibbons was shot through his left eye during the battle while accompanying Marines into the fight. Certain that Gibbons would die – he survived – military censors allowed his report to go out unchanged.\n\nThe stories boosted morale back home, and men lined up at Marine recruiting stations across the country. Congress would go on to enlarge the corps.\n\nBack in France, the Marines were taking stock of what they had accomplished, and at what cost.\n\nBattalion commander Wise's wife was in France working as a hospital volunteer. After the battle, she asked him, “How are the Marines?” according to Miracle at Belleau Wood.\n\n“There aren’t any more Marines,” he replied."
