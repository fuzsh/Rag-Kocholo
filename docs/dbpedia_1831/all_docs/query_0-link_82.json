        "text": "The \"Chemin des Dames\" runs east and west in the département of Aisne, between in the west, the Route Nationale 2, (Laon to Soissons) and in the east, the D1044 at Corbeny. It is some thirty kilometres long and runs along a ridge between the valleys of the rivers Aisne and Ailette. It acquired the name in the 18th century, as it was the route taken by the two daughters of Louis XV, Adélaïde and Victoire, who were known as the \"Ladies of France\". At the time, it was scarcely a carriage road, but it was the most direct route between Paris and the Château de Boves, near Vauclair, on the far side of the Ailette. The château belonged to Françoise de Châlus, former mistress of Louis XV, Countess of Narbonne-Lara and former lady of honour to Adélaïde, whom the two ladies visited frequently. To make the journey easier, the count had the road surfaced, and it gained its new name. The ridge's strategic importance first became evident in 1814 when Napoleon's young recruits beat an army of Prussians and Russians at the Battle of Craonne. After their retreat from the Marne it was a logical place for the German Army to choose to turn and attempt to check the Allied advances. For most of the 1914–1918 war the German army held the ridge but the French made numerous attempts to remove them from it and this resulted in an enormous loss of life.\n\nBeneath the ridge is an almost one-square-kilometre cave network called \"The Dragon's Lair\" (La Caverne du Dragon). The subterranean caverns were originally a tunnel system created from excavations of limestone for building purposes in the 17th century. The caves are some 20–40 metres below the surface and during the war they were used by both French and German forces as field hospitals and command posts.\n\nThe Chemin des Dames has along its length many visible reminders of the war. The Fort of Malmaison held a strategic position and at La Royere the part which colonial troops played in the war is recorded. At Cerny-en-Laonnais we find the little chapel, which is the official remembrance site for the Chemin des Dames and the Caverne du Dragon Museum on the spot where the Germans used the old quarry there as underground barracks. We find the Monument to the Basques in memory of the 36th Division most of whom hailed from the south-west of France. We find the Plateau de Californie which affords magnificent views over the Aisne valley, which was the scene of the offensive launched by General Nivelle on 16 April 1917. We find the rebuilt village of Craonne with its arboretum of Remembrance and the National Tank Monument, all these memorials interspersed with cemeteries and smaller monuments to the dead.\n\nIt is calculated that over 130,000 men lost their lives in this area and in the French, German, British and Italian cemeteries only half of the men who died could be identified and many were laid to rest in ossuaries.\n\nWhilst there were always almost daily skirmishes along the Chemin des Dames during the war there were three major battles fought. These were-\n\nFirst Battle of the Aisne (1914) - The Anglo-French counter-offensive following the First Battle of the Marne.\n\nSecond Battle of the Aisne (1917) - Part of the Nivelle Offensive.\n\nThird Battle of the Aisne (1918) - The third phase or (Operation Blücher) of the German Spring Offensive.\n\nThe First Battle of the Aisne was the Allied follow-up offensive against the right wing of the German First Army (led by Alexander von Kluck) & Second Army (led by Karl von Bülow) as they retreated after the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914. The Aisne battle began on the evening of 13 September but it was inconclusive and the two armies concluded that a head-on breakthrough was not possible and started the \"Race to the Sea\" with one attempt after another to take the opposition's flank, which, when no one managed this, saw the race finish on the North Sea Coast. Thereafter a \"war of movement\" ended and trench warfare and a static war took its place.\n\nAfter the First Battle of the Aisne no major battles were fought in the area until March 1917 but during this time several thousand soldiers died in local attacks or coup de main operations and on 25 January 1915, German forces captured the Creute farm (today La Caverne du Dragon or the Dragon's Lair), the last remaining French position on the plateau. This was what is known as the \"Battle of the Creute\". The Germans now dominated the ridge.\n\nThe Second Battle of the Aisne took place between 16 and 25 April 1917. This was to become known as the \"Nivelle Offensive\". General Robert Nivelle was an artilleryman by training and started the battle with a six-day long artillery bombardment involving some 5,300 guns but this arguably did no more than alert the Germans to the fact that an attack was coming. On 16 April, seven French army corps attacked the German line along the Chemin des Dames ridge but Nivelle had underestimated the enemy's defensive preparations (the Germans had created a network of deep shelters in old underground stone quarries below the ridge, where their troops had been able to take shelter during the French barrage) and the well prepared German positions dominated the southerly slope over which the French attackers were attacking, the Germans making maximum use of their new MG08/15 machine guns. The French took 40,000 casualties on the first day alone and during the following 12 days of the battle, French losses continued to rise to 120,000 casualties (dead, wounded, and missing). The final count, when the offensive was over, was 271,000 French casualties and 163,000 Germans casualties and although the German defenders suffered less, they lost some 20,000 prisoners, 40 cannons, and 200 machine guns. The high French casualty count and in such a small space of time and with such minimal gains, was perceived at headquarters and by the French public as a disaster. There was also much criticism of the agonizingly slow evacuation of the French wounded which it was thought demonstrated a lack of logistical preparations. Nivelle had to resign, and the French Army now suffered from instances were soldiers refused to accept orders: Mutiny was in the air.\n\nThis situation developed into a threat of complete disintegration and General Pétain, who had opposed Nivelle's offensive, was called in to take over from Nivelle and to reestablish order. This he did without harsh collective punishments and he also instituted positive changes, such as longer home leaves and better food and medical/surgical assistance for the troops. By the autumn of 1917 everything began to settle down and the British army took over the defenses at the western end of the ridge during the following twelve months.\n\nDuring the summer of 1917 the area saw the Battle of the Observatories which was a series of local attacks and counterattacks to gain control of high positions commanding the views between Craonne and Laffaux and in October, after the allied victory at the Battle of Malmaison the German forces left the Chemin des Dames and moved to the north of the Ailette River valley.\n\nThe Third Battle of the Aisne was part of the German \"Spring Offensive\" and the Germans wanted to recapture the Chemin des Dames ridge before the American Expeditionary Force arrived in France in any great numbers. It was one of a series of offensives, known as the Kaiserschlacht, launched by the Germans in the spring and summer of 1918. The American Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division (United States) and the 93rd Infantry Division (United States) were the first Americans to fight in France, albeit detached from the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) and under French command. The 92nd & 93rd would continue to fight under French command for the duration of the war. The massive surprise attack (named Blücher-Yorck after two Prussian generals of the Napoleonic Wars) lasted from 27 May until 6 June 1918.\n\nOperation Blücher-Yorck was planned primarily by Erich Ludendorff, who was certain that success at the Aisne would lead the German armies to within striking distance of Paris. Ludendorff, who saw the BEF as the main threat, believed that this, in turn, would cause the Allies to move forces from Flanders to help defend the French capital, allowing the Germans to continue their Flanders offensive with greater ease. Thus, the Aisne drive was essentially planned as a large diversionary attack.\n\nThe defence of the Aisne area was in the hands of General Denis Auguste Duchêne, commander of the French Sixth Army. In addition, four divisions of the British IX Corps, led by Lieutenant-General Sir Alexander Hamilton-Gordon, held the Chemin des Dames Ridge; they had been posted there to rest and refit after surviving the \"Michael\" battle. On the morning of 27 May 1918, the Germans began a 4,000 gun bombardment of the Allied front lines and the British suffered heavy losses, because Duchêne (reluctant to abandon the Chemin des Dames Ridge after it had been captured at such cost the previous year had ordered them to mass together in the front trenches, in defiance of instructions from the French Commander-in-Chief Henri-Philippe Pétain. Huddled together they were to make for easy artillery targets. The bombardment was followed by a poison gas drop and once the gas had lifted the main infantry assault by 17 German Sturmtruppen divisions commenced.\n\nTaken completely by surprise and with their defences spread thin, the Allies were unable to stop the attack and the German army advanced through a 40 km gap in the Allied lines and reached the Aisne in under six hours. In fact the Germans were to smash through eight Allied divisions on a line between Reims and Soissons, pushing the Allies back to the river Vesle and gaining an extra 15 km of territory by nightfall.\n\nVictory seemed near for the Germans, who had captured just over 50,000 Allied soldiers and well over 800 guns by 30 May 1918 but, after having advanced within 56 km of Paris on 3 June, the German armies were beset by numerous problems, including supply shortages, fatigue, lack of reserves and many casualties along with counter-attacks by and stiff resistance from newly arrived American divisions, who engaged them in the Battles of Chateau-Thierry and Belleau Wood and on 6 June 1918, the German advance halted on the Marne.\n\nThe French had suffered over 98,000 casualties and the British around 29,000. German losses were nearly as great if not slightly heavier. Duchêne was sacked by French Commander-in-Chief Philippe Pétain for his poor handling of the British and French troops but on a positive note the Americans had arrived and proven themselves in combat for the first time in the war. During the Second Battle of the Marne, the last fight on the Chemin des Dames occurred between 2 August and 10 October 1918 and the Germans finally abandoned the ridge and were pushed back northwards. Peace now returned to the Chemin des Dames but it had witnessed unimaginable scenes of horror! [14]\n\nCemeteries in the Chemin des Dames area[]\n\nCemeteries in the Chemin des Dames area Given the huge loss of life which the area was to see over the four years of war it comes as no surprise that it holds many military cemeteries. During the 1920s, French graves which were scattered throughout the area where moved into 14 central cemeteries. In some cases these cemeteries have also absorbed British or Russian casualties and although they are in the Chemin des Dames area some of the cemeteries hold the bodies of men killed at Soissons or in the Battle of the Marne. Conversely the French military cemetery of Maison Bleue (in Cornicy) and situated in the department of the Marne, shelters combatants who had fallen on the Chemin des Dames and in particular in the area of Berry-au-Bac.\n\nThese 14 French Military cemeteries located in the Chemin des Dames area are-\n\nBerry-au-Bac French National cemetery- contains 3,971 bodies of which 3,933 are French, 31 British (2 from WWII), 6 Russian and 1 Belgian. Of the French graves, 2,014 soldiers are in individual graves and 1,958 rest in two ossuaries.[15]\n\nBraine French National cemetery- Contains the bodies of 1,583 French soldiers. 1,088 of these are in individual and collective graves and another 495 are buried in ossuaries.[16]\n\nCerny-en-Laonnois French National cemetery- contains the bodies of 5,150 French soldiers and 54 Russian soldiers. Of the French graves 2,764 are in individual and collective graves and another 2,386 soldiers were buried in ossuaries.[17]\n\nCrouy French National cemetery- Contains the bodies of 2,994 soldiers. 2,941 of these are French soldiers of which 1,465 are buried in individual graves and 1,476 rest in ossuaries.[18]\n\nCraonnelle French National cemetery- contains the bodies of 3,910 French soldiers, 1,884 of whom are in ossuaries. There are 24 graves of British soldiers scattered between the French ones and only 7 of these could be identified.[19]\n\nOeuilly French National cemetery - contains the bodies of 1,159 French soldiers in individual and collective graves. Cemetery also the location of a memorial to the 163rd French Infantry.[20]\n\nPontavert French National cemetery- Contains the bodies of 6,815 soldiers. There are 6,694 French soldiers buried in individual graves and 1,364 in ossuaries. Cemetery also holds 67 British graves and those of 54 Russians.[21]\n\nSoupir n°1 French National cemetery- Contains 7,808 bodies of which 3,088 lie in three ossuaries. This military cemetery also has 4 communal graves, which contains 266 bodies coming from sites of Veil-Arcy, Athies-sous-Laon, Glennes and Pargny-Filain; as well as the grave of a Belgian soldier and of a Russian soldier.[22]\n\nSoupir n°2 French National cemetery- Contains the graves of 1,966 French soldiers with another 250 laid in ossuaries, Also holds 2 British, 5 Belgian, 27 Russian and 1 German grave.[23]\n\nVailly-sur-Aisne French National cemetery- holds the graves of 1,576 French soldiers.[24]\n\nVauxaillon French National cemetery- Contains the graves of 1,909 French soldiers.[25]\n\nVauxbuin French National cemetery- Holds the graves of 4,916 soldiers.[26]\n\nThere are 9 German cemeteries in the area. Some of these cemeteries were laid out by the German Army during the war (Veslud, Laon-Bousson and Montaigu in particular) and the others were built by the French authorities in the beginning of the 1920s in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles which had stated that the victorious countries had the exclusive right to organise the German graves. Again in the 1920s bodies in individual graves scattered around the area were concentrated into these 9 cemeteries.\n\nIn 1966 management and care of the cemeteries was passed to the \"Service d’Entretien des Sépultures militaries\", the French subsidiary of the German Volksbund Deutsche Krieggräberfürsorge.\n\nThese cemeteries are:-\n\nCerny-en-Laonnois German cemetery-Cemetery holds 7,526 graves. 3,533 soldiers have individual graves and 3,993 rest in an ossuary.[27]\n\nLaon-Champ de manœuvre German cemetery\n\nLaon-Bousson German cemetery- Holds the graves of 2,653 German soldiers.[28]\n\nMontaigu n°1 German cemetery- Holds 7,192 German soldiers with 5,402 of these buried in individual and collective graves and 1,790 laid to frest in an ossuary.[29]\n\nMontaigu n°2 German cemetery- Holds the graves of 633 German soldiers.[30]\n\nMons-en-Laonnois German cemetery- 1,753 bodies were buried in two ossuaries.[31]\n\nSoupir German cemetery- A large cemetery holding 11,089 German soldiers, of which 5,955 were laid to rest in an ossuary.[32]\n\nSisonne German cemetery- Another large cemetery with 14 694 burials of which 3,995 are held in two ossuaries.[33]\n\nVeslud German cemetery- Holds 1,704 German soldier's graves.[34]\n\nVauxbuin German Cemetery- 9,229 German soldiers are buried here, 5,557 of which rest in four ossuaries.[35]\n\nThe Chemin des Dames area contains 5 British military cemeteries although many British graves still remain within Chemin des Dames communal cemeteries and some of the British dead from the Chemin des Dames are buried in Grand-Seraucourt British military cemetery, near St-Quentin, and in Montcornet British cemetery, both of which are located outside the Chemin des Dames area. The graves of many British soldiers can also be found in French military cemeteries, in particular in Vauxbuin French military cemetery, Berry-au-Bac military cemetery and in Crouy French military cemetery,\n\nThe British Cemeteries are:-\n\nGrand-Seraucourt British cemetery- Almost 2,000 British soldiers are buried here.[36]\n\nLa Ville-aux-Bois-les-Pontavert British cemetery- 564 British and 1 New Zealand soldiers graves are in this cemetery. It was in this area that the British 8th, 21st and 50th Divisions were resting in the spring of 1918 when on 27 May 1918 Ludendorff launched his \"Spring Offensive\". In this cemetery is a monument dedicated to the Devonshire Regiment who took part in the subsequent fighting against Ludendorff's soldiers.[37]\n\nMontcornet British Cemetery- 119 British and 1 Canadian servicemen are buried here.[38]\n\nSissonne British cemetery- 291 Commonwealth soldiers are buried here.[39]\n\nSoupir British cemetery- Contains 36 Commonwealth soldier's graves.[40]\n\nVendresse British cemetery- Holds 728 British graves.[41]\n\nVailly-sur-Aisne British Cemetery- Holds 674 British graves, I Canadian, I French and I German grave.[42]\n\nThe area also holds the Oise-Aisne American cemetery at Seringes-Nesles. In this cemetery are buried 6,012 soldiers most of them casualties of the fighting in the area north of the river (Aisne) and beyond. The names of 241 soldiers whose remains were never found are written on the walls of the cemetery's chapel. The Oise-Aisne military cemetery was created on the very spot where the 42nd American Division, the so-called “Rainbow Division” fought. Among the 6,012 graves is that of the poet Joyce Kilmer, a sergeant in the 165th Regiment (42nd Division), who was killed on 30 July 1918.\n\nThere is also a Danish cemetery at Braine which contains the graves of 79 Danish soldiers. The Danish cemetery at Braine is situated nearby the N31-E46 at around ten kilometres from Soissons and more precisely on the side of the D14 in direction of Reims, near the French military cemetery. This holds the graves of 79 Danish soldiers. They came from Schleswig, a territory annexed by Prussia in 1886 and they had no choice but to serve in the German ranks and sacrifice themselves for a cause that wasn’t theirs. To commemorate their tragic fate on French soil, a Committee (in Denmark with a section in Paris) was charged with the task of gathering the bodies together to be re-buried at Braine. There is a monument designed by the Danish architect Gundlach-Petersen in the cemetery which was unveiled on 7 May 1934. Representatives from the Danish and French Government attended to the ceremony. [43]\n\nThe \"Guardian Angel\" Calvary /\"Le Calvaire de l'Ange Gardien\"[]\n\nThe \"Guardian Angel\" Calvary /\"Le Calvaire de l'Ange Gardien\"=== At the crossroads of the N2 and the D18 between Laon and Soissons and in the direction of Chavignon there is a calvary dedicated to all those soldiers who fought on the Chemin des Dames and in the fighting for Malmaison. The inscription on the calvary reads\n\n\"Calvaire érigé le 14 septembre 1924 par souscription nationale pour perpétuer la mémoire de nos vaillants soldats tombés au Chemin des Dames et dans les combats de la Malmaison\"\n\nThere is also a plaque on the calvary dedicated to those who served in the 165th and 365th French Infantry as well as plaques remembering Claudius Champromis and Lieutenant René de Wismes. [44]\n\nThe Monument to the Missing on the California Plateau[]\n\nThe Monument to the Missing on the California Plateau This monument is located at Craonne and pays tribute to all who fell in the Chemin des Dames between 1914 and 1918 but have no known graves. The bronze sculpture is nearly 4 meters high and was designed by Haim Kern. It was unveiled on 5 November 1998 by the French First Minister Lionel Jospin accompanied by the Minister of Culture and Communication and the State Secretary to War Veterans. This work is entitled \"Ils n’ont pas choisi leur sépulture\" (they didn’t choose their grave). Kern's composition is enigmatic and presents what appears to be metal netting in which the faces of soldiers appear at intervals. They appear trapped in the meshing and unable to escape. They are, as it were, caught in a situation that has resulted in their death but they are lost, as their remains were lost, and could not be found.\n\n[45]\n\nMonument for the R.I.C.M- The Moroccan Colonial Infantry[]\n\nMonument for the R.I.C.M- The Moroccan Colonial Infantry This monument stands in the Chemin des Dames area between the Malmaison farm and the Malmaison Fort and was inaugurated on 8 July 1934.\n\nThe inscription tells us of the efforts made by the R.I.C.M on 23 October 1917, when they took the quarries at La Bohéry on the southern slope of the ridge. Under the command of Lt Colonel Debailleul they successfully fought the Prussian Guard, taking 950 prisoners and capturing 10 of the German's guns.\n\n\"Regiment d'élite sous l'énergique commandement du lieutenant-colonel Debailleul a, le 23 octobre 1917, par une manoeuvre audacieuse difficile et remarquablement exécutée, encerclé et enlevé de haute lutte les carrières de la Bohéry, s'est emparé ensuite des lignes de tranchées du Chemin des Dames que la garde prussienne avait l'ordre de défendre à tout prix, puis progressant encore sous un feu violent d'artillerie et de mitrailleuses sur une profondeur de plus de deux kilomètres et demi malgré des pertes sensibles, a atteint avec un entrain admirable tous les objectifs, infligeant à l'ennemi de lourdes pertes, capturant 950 prisonniers dont 14 officiers, 10 canons, de 8 de gros calibre, et un nombreux matériel de guerre\"\n\n[46]\n\nMonument commemorating Captain Joost van Vollenhoven of the Régiment d'infanterie coloniale du Maroc (RICM)[]\n\nMonument commemorating Captain Joost van Vollenhoven of the Régiment d'infanterie coloniale du Maroc (RICM) This monument celebrates one of the officers of the R.I.C.M, Captain Joost van Vollenhoven, a former Governor of French West Africa, who was killed in the nearby village of Pharmacy in 1918.\n\nThe monument shows the Captain leading his men for the last time, as well as scenes from his previous service in the colonies of Africa and Indochina. Citations to both the Regiment and van Vollenhoven adorn the sides of the monument. Like some of the other monuments in the area it was badly damaged by the German occupiers during the 2nd World War but restored after the war. Joost van Vollenhoven, as his name would suggest, was Dutch by birth. His parents had commercial interests in Algeria and this is where he grew up, eventually taking French citizenship in 1899 at the age of 22. He joined the French Foreign Office and in 1912 he was in Indochina serving as Governor. At the outbreak of war he was promoted to Goveror General in Hanoi but he was anxious to serve in the army and in April 1915 he joined the R.I.C.M. After being wounded numerous times and having received several citations for valour, he was asked in May 1917 to return to his Civil Service duties and take up a post as Governor General of French West Africa - this at the age of 40 but this posting did not last long and he soon rejoined his old regiment, this time as a Captain. It was in July 1918 that the R.I.C.M. attacked the Germans from the Forest of Retz and it was during this action that Vollenhoven was fatally wounded. On 22 July 1918 the French 38th Division (of which the RICM were a part) was relieved by the British 34th Division.

It is a relatively new commemoration and was commissioned as part of the celebrations marking the 90th anniversary of the end of the 1914–1918 war. It is the work of Christian Lapie and comprises nine wooden figures. The inauguration took place on 22 September 2007.\n\n[48]\n\nMonument to the 31st French Infantry Regiment[]\n\nMonument to the 31st French Infantry Regiment This monument is located in the Pontavert National Cemetery and is dedicated to the 31st Infantry and in particular to those who fell in the assault of the \"Bois des Buttes\" and Ville-aux-Bois on the 16, 17 and 18 April 1917 during the Nivelle Offensive. The inscription reads\n\n\"Le 31ème R.I. a enlevé très brillamment les 16, 17 et 18 avril 1917 tous les objectifs qui lui avaient été assignés, et, par un combat opiniâtre, est parvenu à réaliser un gain de terrain de 3 kilomètres en profondeur faisant à lui seul 1.500 prisonniers dont 34 officiers et 170 sous-officiers, et capturant 6 canons, plusieurs minenwerfer, 50 mitrailleuses et un important matériel de toute nature. Régiment d'élite de la plus haute valeur offensive. Ordre général n°172du 1er mai 1917 du général commandant la Vè Armée\"\n\n[49]\n\nThe Basque Memorial[]\n\nThe Basque Memorial One of the memorials on the Chemin des Dames is that to the people of the Basque Country who lost their lives on the Chemin des Dames. The memorial was erected in 1928.\n\nThe 36th Infantry Division, notably the Infantry Regiment of Pau, the 34th Infantry Regiment of Mont-de-Marsan and the 14th Artillery Regiment of Tarbes, was composed mostly of recruits from the southwest region of France: The Landes, Hautes Pyrenees and Basses Pyrenees. It was involved in fighting on the Chemin des Dames on many occasions and suffered very heavy losses whilst attacking or defending difficult positions in particular between Hurtebrise and Craonne and on the Californie Plateau. In September 1914, the 36th Infantry Division attempted in vain to hold French positions on the crest of the Chemin des Dames. From 4 to 6 May 1917 it attacked Californie Plateau and managed to occupy it. Losses were extremely high but the 36th Division returned to the front on 3 and 4 June 1917 and was on the receiving end of a fierce German counterattack.\n\nThe 36th Division returned again to the Chemin des Dames on 15 September 1918 when it went into the attack in the Allemant sector and fighting continued until the German retreat beyond the Aisne in October 1918. The Basque Monument was unveiled on 30 September 1928, the ceremony being attended by many war veterans, widows and orphans who had made the journey for the occasion. Both the architect Forest and the sculptor Claude Grange were veterans themselves and had been wounded in the war. The stone used is from Souppes near Melun, the stone used for the Arc de Triomphe and the basilica of Sacre-Coeur at Montmartre.[50] At the base of a 14 metre high obelisk laurel wreaths bear the names of the administrative areas from which soldiers of the 36th Infantry Division came and the sides bear the division’s monogram. A Basque stands at the foot of the obelisk in traditional, civilian costume and looks towards the Aisne Valley. He wears the \"béret basque\". See images below. [51]\n\nImages of Basque Memorial[]\n\nMemorial to the 2nd Colonial Corps[]\n\nMemorial to the 2nd Colonial Corps The area of the Chemin des Dames between Cerny and the Ferme d'Hurtebise was the sector attacked on 16 April 1917 by the 2nd Colonial Corps of General Mangin's 6th Army as part of Nivelle's offensive. The Ferme d'Hurtebise was a known strong point but Nivelle decided that it would be there in the centre of his battle plan that he would place the dividing line between the 6th and the 5th Armies. Military strategists would say that this was a strange choice. The seam of a garment is not perhaps its strongest point.\n\nThe 2nd Colonial Corps were under instructions to advance at 05:45 hours and take the farm. They would then take the plateau in front of them, the Vauclerc Wood, the valley of the Ailette, the valley of the Bièvres beyond that and then the hill in front of them so that they would at that stage be able to see the town of Laon right in front of them. They had been given just seven hours of fighting to advance over many kilometres of terrain and two valleys. Mangin had insisted that the troops would advance 100 metres every three minutes which was a minute faster than Haig's calculations up at Arras where the British were attacking hopefully to divert the German's attention from the Nivelle attack.\n\nThe Senegalese soldiers who were part of the 2nd Colonial Corps were already suffering from the cold and although they went forward with great spirit and the first German positions were taken with ease, gaining many prisoners, this could not be sustained as there were German machine gun posts everywhere - even behind them. What the planners do not appear to have taken into account was the depth of the \"creutes\" (called \"boves\" in Arras), the underground chalk quarries that riddled the ridge and were used by the Germans to great advantage. Three of the four 2nd Corps colonels were killed and as the second and third waves of troops advanced, in accordance with Mangin's strict timetable, they became an easier target for the German gunners. The 15th Colonial Division on the left were charged with taking Cerny but like the 10th on their right they could only get as far as the road and a little beyond.\n\nIn this area is a memorial which is in memory of 2nd Lieutenant Louis Astoul of the 70ème Sénégalais who fell on the field of honour at the age of 24 during the course of the assault on 16 April 1917. This is a private memorial erected by Astoul's parents. He had been reported missing near the village of Paissy before even reaching the ridge. Whenever there are ceremonies at Cerny the Guard of Honour is often the 1er Régiment d'Artillerie de Marine - The 1st Marine Artillery Regiment. The Marines had been created to guard France's colonial interests in 1622 by Cardinal Richelieu and as overseas troops they would fight in the African Army (The 19th Corps during the war). Known as the 1st Colonial Artillery Regiment, the \"Bigors\" as their gunners were called fought with intense bravery winning their 9th Battle Honour at the Somme in 1916.\n\nAlthough disbanded in 1940 following the armistice, the soldiers rallied to de Gaulle in 1941 and fought in Africa gaining an 11th Battle Honour at El-Alamein in 1942. [52]\n\nThe Fort at La Malmaison and the Battle of Malmaison[]\n\nThe Fort at La Malmaison and the Battle of Malmaison The Fort at Malmaison had been abandoned as a fort by the French in 1914 because of its poor condition but the Germans found it quite useful and it soon became integrated into their defensive system.\n\nThe Battle of Malmaison was fought on 23 October 1917 and after the failure of the Nivelle offensive, Pétain, who had replaced Nivelle, focused on restoring his soldiers morale. He knew that they needed a small scale victory that would give them faith in themselves and more importantly - restore their faith in their commanders. Malmaison was chosen to be the location for this battle. It needed to be well organised with all the tanks, aircraft and shells needed, casualties were to be kept to a minimum and this time the casualty services would be up to the task. General Maistre had taken over the 6th Army from Mangin and it was his sector that was allotted the battle. With just three Corps - the 11th, 21st and 14th, they would take the western end of the Chemin des Dames and with it the Fort at Malmaison. On 17 October 1917, the artillery bombardment of the fort began and it was soon reduced to a crumpled mess. At 05:15 hours on the 23rd, following a final crescendo from the guns, the troops \"went over the top\". They advanced as they had not done for months, things were going to plan and objectives were being taken even if after a hard struggle. The 11th Corps who were charged with taking the Fort took the majority of the casualties but 554 soldiers from the 4th Regiment of Zouaves charged the fort and by 06:00 hours it was theirs. As the French paused to prepare their second attack, the Germans thinking they had the French beaten launched a counter-attack but ran headlong into the second French barrage. On the 25th Pétain called a halt to his operation as he felt he had achieved all that he had set out to do. He had lost about 2,000 dead and 14 000 wounded over the three days - mostly from the 11th Corps but many prisoners were taken and the Germans suffered at least twice the casualties as the French. More importantly, the loss of this position acted as a lever against the remainder of the German line on the Chemin des Dames and over the next week the Germans were forced to give up the ridge to the French. A well prepared and limited attack had therefore taken territory that Nivelle's full frontal assault had only dented. On 27 May 1918 during their Spring Offensive the Germans retook the fort (or at least what was left of it) and the remainder of the ridge within three hours. The whirlwind nature of the attack had been too much for the defenders to stand but at 1130 hours on 28 September 1918, the 25th Alpine Chasseurs retook the fort and the Germans were pushed out of the Aisne for good. [53]\n\nMemorial to the 36th French Infantry Division at the Fort de la Malmaison[]\n\nMemorial to the 36th French Infantry Division at the Fort de la Malmaison As one enters the site of the Fort of Malmaison there is a memorial which remembers the actions of the 36th Infantry on 23 October 1917\n\n\"Le 23 octobre 1917, la 38ème Division comprenant le 4ème Régiment Zouaves, le R.I.C.M. (Régiment d'Infanterie Coloniale du Maroc), le 4ème Régiment mixte Zouaves-Tirailleurs, le 8ème Régiment Tirailleurs Tunisiens, le 32ème Régiment d'Artillerie de campagne, part à l'attaque. D'un seul élan, le 4ème Zouaves s'empare du Fort de la Malmaison et de tous ses objectifs, faisant les 23-24-25 octobre 600 prisonniers, capturant 17 canons et de nombreuses mitrailleuses, obtenant sa 6ème citation à l'ordre de l'Armée\"\n\n[54]\n\nTank Memorial at Berry-Au-Bac[]\n\nTank Memorial at Berry-Au-Bac The Tank Memorial (Mémorial des Chars d’Assaut) pays tribute to all those tank drivers who fell in the course of 1917–1918. It was erected following the efforts of a group of ex-infantrymen, and inaugurated on 2 July 1922 in the presence of both Marshal Foch and Pétain and Generals Mangin and Weygand, as well as General Estienne, the so-called “father of the tank”. The monument is situated at Choléra Farm from where a mass attack of French tanks was thrown in the direction of Juvincourt on 16 April 1917. A plaque to the rear of the memorial recalls that on 16 April 1917, the 151st Infantry Regiment continued to advance with the assistance of Bossut’s tanks right up to Béliers Wood. There are some tanks dating back to the 1950s on display near the memorial.[55]\n\nThe Calvary at Choléra[]"
