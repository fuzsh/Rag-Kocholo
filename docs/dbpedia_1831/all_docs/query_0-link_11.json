        "text": "The Battle of Belleau Wood (June 1–26, 1918) occurred during the German Spring Offensive in World War I, near the Marne River in France. The battle was fought between the U.S. 2nd and 3rd Divisions along with French and British forces against an assortment of German units. The battle has become a key component of the lore of the United States Marine Corps.\n\nGermans advanced through Belleau Wood as part of a major offensive. The commander of the Marine Brigade, Army General James Harbord, countermanding a French order to dig trenches further to the rear, ordered the Marines to \"hold where they stand\". With bayonets, the Marines dug shallow fighting positions. German infantry attacked the Marine positions through grain fields with bayonets fixed. The Marines waited until the Germans were within 100 yd before opening deadly rifle fire which mowed down waves of German infantry and forced the survivors to retreat into the woods.\n\nUnited States forces suffered 9,777 casualties, included 1,811 killed. Many are buried in the nearby Aisne-Marne American Cemetery. After the battle, the French renamed the wood \"Bois de la Brigade de Marine\" (\"Wood of the Marine Brigade\") in honor of the Marines' tenacity.\n\n▼ Organizational Supporters - HonorStates.org and the National Unified Archive of American Gold Star Veterans is stringently curated.

This took place at the Rayburn House in Washington DC, the center of Congressional Representative offices.\n\n★ Featured National Supporter\n\nWe appreciate the generous help + encouragement from our research teams, volunteers, and foundational supporters. Each of them are essential team members contributing to the archive building progress.\n\nHonor States and the National Unified Archive of American Gold Star Veterans has an established policy of developing \"most complete\" datasets. These are groups, campaigns and actions of special historical significance. Some notable examples include:\n\nBrothers Who Served\n\nMedal of Honor\n\nPearl Harbor\n\nNormandy Landings\n\nIt's required 8+ years, 1000s of skilled labor hours, scores of active contributors, and millions of visitors to realize the value in the National Unified Archive of American Gold Star Veterans. We have not satisfied everyone. That's impossible, considering the unique + personal needs of individuals. However, our annual positivity ratings exceed 95%. It's tough to get that many people to agree on anything. So, we do seem to be on the right track.\n\nNone of us would be who we are, or have what we have, if not for the strengths and sacrifices of others. Most of us enjoy lives of relative freedom. Our freedom has come at enormous cost. The price paid by those who gave their all. In service to their country, states and communities. Each of them a beloved member of our global family.\n\nYou meet a new friend. Common question. \"Where are you from\"? Alabama. Ohio. California. Grew up in the Bronx. Family lives in Pasadena. Went to school in Boston. Worked in Chicago. We have roots everywhere. These state and community identities are foundational in defining who Americans are at heart. It's the who and what we fight for when pressed.\n\nErica - It makes me happy to Honor the fallen while helping research their backgrounds.
