The battle is known for the line reported back to headquarters following the successful conclusion, \"Woods Now U.S. Marine Corps Entirely.\" Although the operation cost the 4th Marine Brigade 4,719 casualties, including over 1,000 killed, the Marines proved their courage to both the French and the American Expeditionary Forces. Heartened by the American performance, the French awarded the division's infantry brigades, including the 4th Marine Brigade unit citatations for \"gallant action\" and officially renamed the woods -- Bois de la Brigade Marine."
