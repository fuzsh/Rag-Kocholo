        "text": "The Legacy Divisions of the Army Reserve\n\nToday, the 79th Theatre Sustainment Command is based in Los Alamitos, California, whose mission is to “provide trained, ready, cohesive, well-led sustainment units for world-wide deployment to meet the U.S. Army’s rotational and contingency mission requirements in support of the National Military Strategy.” (79th Division).\n\nThe “Blue Ridge” 80th Division, organized at Camp Lee, Virginia, Aug. 5, 1917, saw action in the St. Mihiel area of battle, primarily as a reserve division. It played a more active role in the Meuse-Argonne campaign, and saw heavy action in the Somme offensive. On the night of September 25-26, the 80th division found itself on the front line as part of III Corps, sandwiched in by the 4th Infantry Division on the left and the 33rd Infantry Division on the right. III Corps was at the heart of the First Army attack that now encompassed I Corps, V Corps and the French XVII Corps to its right. Before dawn, the Meuse-Argonne offensive began with the American First Army spearheading the assault against the German Third and Fifth Armies.\n\nAfter several days of fighting, pressure from all sides forced the Germans to shift seven more divisions in front of the Allied armies, but the added forces were too late as the 80th Infantry Division and the accompanying American and French Soldiers were driving deeper into German lines. So deep in fact, the German High Command urged its government on September 29 to offer a peace settlement. This was done Oct. 6th. After another week of fighting, the 80th and 3rd Divisions broke through the famed Hindenburg Line near the Bois de Cunel, Oct. 9th. This breakthrough, combined with the German withdrawal from the Argonne at the same time, proved decisive as German forces began to fall back in ever greater numbers and ever greater territory.\n\nFrom this point, the 80th Division continued the fight until Nov. 7, 1918 when relieved by the 1st Division. A few days later, and the war was over.\n\nWith 6,029 casualties, the Doughboys from the Mid-Atlantic States returned home in early 1919. Their legacy is carried on today by the 80th Training Command in Richmond, Virginia, whose mission is to train Army Soldiers in 12 career military fields for combat support and combat service support, including engineering, health services, supply, and information operations.\n\nThe 81st “Wildcats” Division arrived in theater late in the war in August 1918. The 81st Division did not see action at St. Mihiel, but rather was put in the training pipeline for the Meuse-Argonne offensive where it suffered 1,104 casualties, all in the final four days of the war, as they replaced the 35th Division near Bois de Manheulles. From this position, the 81st protected the right flank of the American First Army, where its front-line units were meeting resistance in the local woods when the Armistice went into effect, including the Bois de Moranville that was captured by the 81st in spite of terrific German resistance.\n\nThe 81st stayed in France until May 1919 and was inactivated on June 11. Its legacy is continued today by the 81st Readiness Division, stationed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, whose mission is to “… provide essential customer care and services to Soldiers, Civilians and their Families in the Southeast Region and Puerto Region, enabling supported commanders and leaders to maximize resources and meet global requirements” (81st RSC).\n\nThe 89th Division, known as the “Rolling W” division arrived in France in mid-summer 1918 and participated in the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne campaigns, where it saw extensive action and suffered 7,091 casualties. Soldiers within its ranks were awarded with nine Medals of Honor (MoH), tied with the 33rd Division for second place behind the 30th Division, which had 12 Medal of Honor recipients.\n\nAction for the 89th began on the first day of the St. Mihiel offensive at the tip of the spear, with the 1st and 42nd Divisions on the left, and the 2nd, 5th, and part of the 90th, on the right. They continued the attack, advancing well into German lines before encountering an enemy strongpoint at Ansoncourt Farm, near Limey-Remenauville. During this attack, 2nd Lt. J. Hunter Wickersham earned the Medal of Honor posthumously for saving the life of his orderly, and refusing medical treatment for his disabled right arm while leading his men forward to continue the advance. He later died from loss of blood.\n\nAs the advance continued, the 89th jumped through the woods and captured the town of Euvezin, and later, the ground which is now consecrated with the remains of 4,153 Soldiers as the St. Mihiel American Military Cemetery. Among the Soldiers buried there, in Plot B, Row 19, Grave 12, is Lieutenant Wickersham.[4]\n\nOn the opening day of the offensive, Sgt. Harry J. Adams completed an amazing feat of arms:\n\n\"Harry J. Adams, First sergeant, Company K, Three hundred and fifty-third Infantry, Eighty-ninth Division, of Rochester, N.Y., came over with the first 700. On September 12 he was told by lieutenant to see if there were any more Germans in town, after he and the lieutenant had captured 80. Adams saw a German run into a house and he followed. He entered in time to see the Boche go through a trap door in the wall. At that time he had two shots left in his automatic. He fired these through the door and told him to come out. This left him with an empty pistol. The Boche came out; with him came 1 lieutenant colonel, 18 staff officers, and 355 soldiers.” The World War – Past Perfect Online and American Armies and Battlefields in Europe.\n\nThis event occurred in the French town of Bouillonville. For his actions, the poker-faced Adams was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the French Croix De Guerre.\n\nThe next day, Soldiers of the 89th captured the village of Beney which was part of the larger American objective to capture the market town of Xammes, one of the key areas in the overall plan. The 89th continued to push to the Bois de Dampvitoux and secured that area in cooperation with the 42nd Infantry Division later in the day, capturing an important aviation field and several barracks in the process.\n\nThis part of the battlefield now secured, the 89th pulled out of the line and began movement to the Meuse-Argonne sector. As the attack began, the “Rolling W” division was held in reserve along with the rest of the IV Corps, before heading into the line with the 78th and 90th divisions to the west of Pont-a-Mousson Oct. 4. Ten days later the Division had again been pulled from the line and placed in V Corps reserve, only to rejoin the battle Oct. 22 in its drive to support the capture of Romange by the 90th Division.\n\nPershing now ordered an all-out general attack by all American forces with the objective of cutting the Metz-Sedan-Mezieres railroad. Launching Nov. 1st, “Black Jack’s entire Army group marched forward, with V Corps assigned the difficult task of capturing the area known as the Barricourt Heights. Once secured, this opened the way for the other Corps to rush through, forcing the Germans to order a general retirement from the American First Army front west of the Meuse River, a stretch of territory that included the battle line as far north as Holland. When units of I Corps reached the heights over-looking Sedan, thereby severing German rail communications, the objectives of the Meuse-Argonne offensive had been reached.\n\nDespite the Germans retreating and negotiating with Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the overall Allied commander ordered the offensive to continue. As a result, the 89th pushed off to force a crossing of the Meuse south of Mouzon on November 9 and they had secured their objective by the time the Armistice went effect.\n\nThe 89’s legacy is carried on today by the 89th Sustainment Brigade.[5]\n\nThe 90th “Tough Ombres” Division saw action in the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne campaigns, accumulating 7,549 casualties, the second most of any National Army division during the war. These casualty figures began on the first day of the St. Mihiel campaign as part of the 90th division protected the right flank of the initial assault wave, shielding the 5th division from a counter-attack as it took the village of Vieville-en-Haye. They later teamed-up with the 82nd division, cleaning out the west bank of the Moselle River and shoring up American positions in that sector. By Sept. 13th, all objectives assigned to First Army had been achieved, as had Pershing’s desire to lead an American Army comprised of American Divisions, in a large-scale offensive action.\n\nThe assault continued with the 90th Division flanking the 5th and taking large amounts of machine-gun fire from the woods, Bois de la Rappe, near the village of Regnieville. They quickly pushed aside resistance and continued on toward Vandieres, side-by-side with the 82nd Division. Seizing their objectives, the 90th survived severe gas and artillery fire and held their position.\n\nThe 90th remained in France until 1919. Its lineage is carried on by the 90th Sustainment Brigade. The role of the sustainment brigade is to execute sustainment support on an area basis to Army forces, or if required, to joint and multinational forces as directed by its higher headquarters. In this role, the sustainment brigade, depending on the assigned mission, is capable of providing support from the operational to the tactical level. (U.S. Army ATP 4-93).\n\nThe 91st Division, known as the “Wild West Division,” was formed at Camp (now Fort) Lewis on Aug. 5, 1917 and got into action 13 months later during the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne campaigns, the latter with V Corps. Staying in First Army reserve for the St Mihiel campaign with the 35th and 80th Divisions, the 91st went into the line for the Meuse-Argonne offensive and found itself on the left flank of V Corps, to the right of the 35th Division and I Corps, and to the left of 37th Division, in the push for Montfaucon.\n\nThe 91st stayed in the line until Oct. 14, including a rapid assault of Epinonville, its headquarters from Sept. 28th until Oct. 4th, Cheppy and key German positions, when it was pulled back as First Army reserve, along with the 1st, 80th and 90th Divisions.\n\nDuring this period, in a battle on Sept. 28 Maj. Oscar F. Miller displayed a remarkable degree of leadership for which he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. According to the citation:\n\n“After 2 days of intense physical and mental strain, during which Maj. Miller had led his battalion in the front line of the advance through the forest of Argonne, the enemy was met in a prepared position south of Gesnes. Though almost exhausted, he energetically reorganized his battalion and ordered an attack. Upon reaching open ground, the advancing line began to waver in the face of machinegun fire from the front and flanks and direct artillery fire. Personally leading his command group forward between his front-line companies, Maj. Miller inspired his men by his personal courage, and they again pressed on toward the hostile position. As this officer led the renewed attack he was shot in the right leg, but he nevertheless staggered forward at the head of his command. Soon afterwards he was again shot in the right arm, but he continued the charge, personally cheering his troops on through the heavy machinegun fire. Just before the objective was reached he received a wound in the abdomen, which forced him to the ground, but he continued to urge his men on, telling them to push on to the next ridge and leave him where he lay. He died from his wounds a few days later.”\n\nMaj. Miller is buried in Plot F, Row 10, Grave 36 of the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery, Romagne-sous-Montfaucon, France.\n\nFollowing a brief rest and re-fit, the 91st Division was sent to Belgium to assist the Group of Armies of Flanders near Audenarde, under the command of the King of the Belgians, Albert I. King Albert directed a general offensive in an easterly direction toward Brussels and the 37th and 91st American divisions (Both recognized by Pershing as two of his best divisions) stayed on the offensive until the end of the war, marching virtually unopposed as far east as the villages of Elst and Boucle-St. Blaise when the Armistice went into effect. During its time in battle, the 91st sustained 6,108 casualties.\n\nNow based at Fort Hunter Ligget in California, the 91st Training Division carries on the legacy of its predecessor, where its mission is to: “… train and assess Army Reserve units in accordance with United States Army Reserve Command and United States Army Forces Command directives in support of Operational and Functional Commands through the conduct of Warrior and Combat Support Training Exercises (WAREX/CSTX). Training is provided to Joint, Combined and Active Army forces as directed to Joint, Combined and Active Army forces as directed (91st Training Division).\"\n\nMaj. (P) Franklin Huffman, is the Operations Officer for the Public Affairs Office of the United States Army Reserve Command, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. With 19 years of service, he is a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom and holds a Master’s degree in Social Science Education from Appalachian State University, Boone, North Carolina."
