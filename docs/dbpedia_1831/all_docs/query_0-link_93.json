        "text": "Sources of Information on US Navy Casualties in World War II\n\nThe Bureau of Naval Personnel's official list of the Navy's World War II casualties resulting from enemy action is a 1947 IBM printout arranged chronologically by the campaigns as listed in the Secretary of the Navy's Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual. Under each campaign, the ships and units are listed alphabetically and then, the personnel casualties are listed alphabetically by last name. The man's service number, rank/rate, casualty code (wounded or killed), and date of casualty are included. The original printout and extensive records including folders of casualties from naval ships and of the armed guard crews of merchant ships, as well as microfilm and microfiche additions are located at the National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.\n\nThe National Archives in College Park, Maryland, also has several other lists of personnel casualties on microfiche. An eight fiche set contains a list of personnel killed or wounded in World War II actions not designated in the Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual, such as naval gun crews on merchant ships and Army transports. The casualties are arranged chronologically and then alphabetical under the unit. The name, service number, rank or rate, casualty code, and date of casualty is included. There is a two fiche set list of officers and enlisted prisoners of war as of 25 September 1945. Arranged alphabetically, the list includes service number, rank or rate, date of capture and the prisoner of war camp designation. Another two microfiche set consists of an alphabetical list of the officer and enlisted prisoners of war in the Pacific and Asiatic areas as of 28 July 1945.\n\nLists of casualties are also included in two publications which may be located at a large university or depository libraries in your area or through interlibrary loan channels:\n\nUS Navy. Naval Historical Division. United States Submarine Losses, World War II. Washington: Naval History Division, 1963. (Includes crew lists.)\n\nUS Navy. Office of Information. Combat Connected Naval Casualties, World War II, by States. 2 vols. Washington: Office of Information, 1946. (Vol. 1 covers Alabama through Missouri; vol.2. covers Montana through Wyoming and other areas)\n\nUS Navy and Marine Corps Casualty Statistics for World War II\n\nSource:\n\nUS Navy. Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. History of the Medical Department of the United States Navy in World War II: The Statistics of Diseases and Injuries. vol.3. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1950.\n\nThis history lists the Navy and Marine Corps personnel who were killed in action with the enemy, died of wounds, and died as a prisoner of war, as well as those who were discharged from the service because of their wounds (invalided from service.)\n\nThe history provides statistics by officer and enlisted, but for the purpose of this summary, these numbers are totaled for each service."
