In April 2015, his grand nephew Vernon Murray emailed:\n\n\"I was reading the list of those killed in action at the Battle of Belleau Woods, and noticed that my great uncle, Clyde H. Slider was missing from the list. I don't want his sacrifice to be forgotten. If you could add his name to the list of marines killed on June 18, 1918 I would surely appreciate it. THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE. His sister, Wealtha B. Slider (Murray) was my Paternal Grandmother\n\n\"The grave stone reads: CLYDE H. SON OF T. E.& M. A. SLIDER, BORN MAR 7, 1897, KILLED IN ACTION IN FRANCE JUNE 18, 1918, U. S.
