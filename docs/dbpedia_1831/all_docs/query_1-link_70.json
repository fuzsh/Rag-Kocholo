        "text": "The Battle of Belleau Wood … wow. This is sacred ground for Marines. Much of our ethos was born during this famous battle. Every Marine knows GySgt Dan Daily’s quote, “Come on, you sons of bitches! Do you want to live forever?” that was said here, at Belleau Wood, on 6 June 1918 when 1,087 Marines were killed in action in ONE day. Over the 3 week battle there were 9,777 American casualties, 4 Medals of Honor, and 152 Navy Crosses awarded. Wow. Can you imagine the carnage? And the pure grit and spirit to fight on? Today I had the immense and humbling opportunity to walk the hallowed ground of Belleau Wood. The cold, eerie fog lingered in the air… it felt spiritual. A drink from the Devil Dog fountain…. It is said that Marines who drink from it will receive strength and protection in battles to come. It's also done to remember the Marines who fought at Belleau Wood and those who never came home. I hope my drink from the fountain today gives me strength to press on in the inevitable conflicts to come. I have no doubt that Marines of the present will “show up” to the future fight with the same esprit de corps that Marines of the past displayed - it’s in our blood. Semper Fidelis, Marines!"
