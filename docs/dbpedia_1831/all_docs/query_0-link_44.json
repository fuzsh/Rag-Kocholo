The battle was fought between the U.S. Second (under the command of Major General Omar Bundy) and Third Divisions (plus the 4th Marine Brigade) and an assortment of German units including elements from the 237th, 10th, 197th, 87th, and 28th Divisions.\n\t\n\tU.S. forces suffered 9,777 casualties, included 1,811 killed.

The French government also later awarded the 4th Brigade the Croix de guerre. \n\t\n\tBelleau Wood is allegedly also where the Marines got their nickname \"Teufel Hunden\" meaning \"Devil Dogs\" in poor German (actually \"Teufelshunde\" in proper German), for the ferocity with which they attacked.
