About UEL

The University of East London is a careers-first university.

We prepare our students for the jobs of the future and have been doing this proudly for 125 years.

Hero Carousel

Our story started in 1898. We've survived wars, celebrated momentous sporting events and fought against society's biggest sustainability issues.

Now in the digital age, the world of work is rapidly changing, and we're adapting to ensure our graduates have the skills and resilience to succeed in their careers and make a positive impact on society and the planet.

Pioneering Futures

In 1898, the University of East London was founded with the aim of serving both its local community and a wider audience. Our belief is that education is a potent tool in decreasing inequality and promoting a brighter future for everyone. As a demonstration of our dedication to this cause, we partnered with Luke Gray, a former student, to produce an interactive mural at our Docklands Campus that mirrors our fundamental principles. Luke is a surrealist street artist who combines conventional painting methods with augmented reality and integrates various textures and designs into his creations.

The careers-led university

We're changing the face of education to match the ongoing fundamental shift in working cultures. We have collaborated with industry to re-develop, re-design and validate our course portfolio, so the knowledge our students gain reflects the changing needs of industry and prepares our learners for sustainable careers of the future.

Your career

Our vision

We've always been a pioneering institution and Vision 2028 is our ambitious 10-year strategy. We're reshaping education for the benefit of all, giving students from any background the skills and opportunities to thrive in the modern world.

London is moving east

The East of the capital is full of opportunities with businesses, developments and innovative careers at every turn. The Olympic Boroughs have the youngest, fastest growing, and most multicultural neighbourhoods in the UK. There has never been a better time to live and learn in east London.

There will be 125,000 new jobs in East London by 2030 (london.gov.uk)

With campuses in Stratford and the Royal Albert Dock, we're at the heart of it all. Global businesses are making the area their base and the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf create a brilliant backdrop. Because industry in the area is connected to the rest of the world, so are we.

The location of the Docklands campus is simply amazing. During my very first day in university, it was early morning, I was quite nervous, but when I saw the sunrise and the reflection of the sun in the river, that made me stop, think and calm down."
