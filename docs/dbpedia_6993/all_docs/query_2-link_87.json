        "text": "1823 - Charing Cross Hospital Medical School\n\nThe origins of the Charing Cross Hospital Medical School can be found at a meeting of gentlemen at the home of Dr Benjamin Golding to discuss setting up a charitable institution to be known as the West London Infirmary. This was to be a hospital with training facilities, to supply the want of a University, so far as medical education is concerned. Golding drew up a medical education plan in 1822.\n\nThe hospital opened in 1823 in Villiers Street and in 1827 was named Charing Cross Hospital. New Medical School facilities opened in Agar Street in 1834 with 22 students, and again in Chandos Place in 1881. The School was enlarged in 1894, adding physical, biological and pathological laboratories and the curriculum was lengthened from 4 to 5 years.\n\n19th Century alumni from the School include the explorer David Livingstone who was a student there between1839-1840. T.H. Huxley took his medical training at the School, publishing his first paper in 1845 whilst a studentOn a hitherto undescribed structure in the human hair sheath’. It describes the inner layer of the root sheath of the hair follicle since known as Huxley's layer.\n\n1834 - Opening of Westminster Hospital Medical School\n\nThe Westminster Hospital Medical School began in 1834 and, by 1837, each surgeon was allowed three 'cubs', as the students were known. Formal development for training and provision of a building in Dean Street were made in 1841. After financial difficulties in 1847-1848, the School was re-launched in 1849 and a museum of anatomy established.\n\nThe lecturers effectively subsidised the students as they financed the School by paying into the School fund an amount equal to the value of their Chair. A purpose built School behind the hospital was opened in 1852, but as the School expanded, a new building was required and opened in Caxton Street in 1885./\n\nThe School's 19th Century famous alumni include John Snow, anesthetist and epidemiologist who administered chloroform to Queen Victoria during childbirth in 1853 and 1857. He identified the source of the 1854 Golden Square outbreak of cholera as being the water supply in Broad Street. The water pumps were shut down and the epidemic subsided.\n\n1845 - Creation of the Royal College of Chemistry\n\nThe Royal College of Chemistry was founded in 1845 by subscription as a necessary national resource for industrial and technical development. Royal patronage came from Prince Albert, who was President of the Council. The founders, John Lloyd Bullock and John Gardner appointed August Wilhelm Hofmann as the first Professor. He held the post until returning to Germany in 1865.\n\nThe College was situated in Oxford Street, backing on to Hanover Square. In 1853 the Royal College of Chemistry merged with the Royal School of Mines based in Jermyn Street, though teaching continued at the Oxford Street premises until the removal of much of the School of Mines teaching to South Kensington in 1872.\n\n1851 - Creation of the Royal School of Mines\n\nThe Government School of Mines and of Science as Applied to the Arts was founded by Sir Henry de la Beche in 1851. He also largely founded and was Director-General of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, responsible for the Museum of Economic (later Practical) Geology, the Library of the Museum and Survey and the Mining Record Office.\n\nDe la Beche created a school which laid the foundations for the teaching of science in Britain, and which has its legacy today at Imperial. Prince Albert was a patron and supporter of the later developments in science teaching, which led to the Royal College of Chemistry becoming part of the Royal School of Mines and to the creation of the Royal College of Science and eventually to these institutions becoming part of his plan for South Kensington being an educational region.\n\nListen to Dr S W Smith describe, in 1957, a memorable lecture in the RSM that he attended in 1897\n\n1854 - St Mary's Hospital Medical School established\n\nSt Mary's Hospital was founded in 1845 by Samuel Lane, surgeon and anatomist, and from its inception was intended to be a teaching hospital. It opened in 1851 with two students. The Medical School was founded in 1854 and the number of students soon rose to 40. Samuel Lane donated his collection of specimens for the pathological museum at the hospital.\n\nThe School gradually grew and in the 1880s there was a much needed expansion of facilities, with pathology laboratories particularly being enhanced.\n\nFamous alumni include The Lien Wu who entered the School on a Scholarship in 1899. He returned to China and became Director of the Imperial Army Medical College, was Chief Medical Officer to the Manchurian Plague Service and an historian of Chinese medicine.\n\nSir Almroth Wright joined St Mary's in 1902 as Director of the Inoculation Department, later the Wright Fleming Institute until 1946. His great contribution to medicine was vaccine therapy, which was to be so effective in saving the lives of men of the allied armies during the Great War.\n\n1881 - Creation of the Royal College of Science\n\nIn 1881 the Normal School of Science was established which quickly changed its name to the Royal College of Science. The title Normal had been intended by T.H. Huxley to indicate the high status of the School as in the Ecole Normale in Paris. This did not translate well into the English language and was altered in 1890. The main objective was to support the training of science teachers (other students were admitted) and to develop teaching in other science subjects alongside the Royal School of Mines earth sciences specialities.\n\n1884 - Creation of City and Guilds College\n\nThe Central Institution, later to become the City and Guilds College, was established by the City Livery Companies under the City and Guilds of London Institute. Unable to find a site in the City, they first set up the Finsbury Technical College. This was intended as a feeder school for the main College. As no other site became available in the City the CGLI were persuaded by General Sir John Donnelley, Secretary of the Science and Art Department, to build on land in South Kensington bought by the profits of the Great Exhibition of 1851 'for purposes of art and science' in perpetuity.\n\nThe Central Institution building was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, the architect responsible for the Natural History Museum. The City and Guilds Waterhouse building opened in 1884 and full time teaching began in 1885.\n\n1893 - The Imperial Institute opened\n\nThe Imperial Institute was created in 1887 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Jubilee with the intention of it being a scientific research institution exploring and developing the raw materials of the Empire countries. It was administered by a Governing body with the then Prince of Wales as President.\n\nThe Imperial Institute building was constructed in South Kensington between 1888 and 1893. Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone in 1888 and opened the building in 1893. The Institute building spanned from the Queen's Gate side, to where Mechanical Engineering now stands. It faced the Imperial College Road (which then was called the Imperial Institute Road and was open to traffic).\n\nThe Imperial Institute was designed by T. E. Collcutt in the neo-renaissance style. It was 700 feet long with a central tower (the Queen's Tower) and smaller towers at the east and west ends. It contained a library, laboratories, conference rooms and exhibition galleries with gardens at the rear.\n\n1900 - Building work commences on the Royal College of Science\n\nAs the Royal School of Mines and Royal College of Science continued to develop, there were more than double the applications for student places than could be physically accommodated. A new building was needed especially for chemistry and physics, with large, modern, well equipped, laboratories.\n\nIn 1898, the 1851 Commission offered the land opposite the Imperial Institute, valued at £100,000 if government funding was made available for construction of the building. The architect for the Royal College of Science building was Sir Aston Webb and was completed in 1906.\n\n1906 - Board of Education Departmental Committee Report on the need for a higher technical education institution\n\nThe Board of Education Committee report, in 1906, indicated that a high level scientific and technological educational institution should be established, combining Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines and the City & Guilds College.\n\nIn educational and government circles, the debate about the need for a ‘London Charlottenberg’, a British higher technical education institution with applications to industry, had been continuing from the 19th century. The grouping of the RSM, RCS and C&G in South Kensington lent weight to the proponents’ arguments for such an institution.\n\nIn 1904 the Board of Education instituted a Departmental Committee to investigate the ‘present working of the RSM, RCS and C&G to see how they could best be utilised in the development of an integral higher technical and scientific institution. The Preliminary Report in February 1905 was positive about the integration into one body of the three institutions, but this required co-operation of the Board of Education and the government (for financial support) and the City and Guilds of London Institute. The private benefactors would contribute to building and equipment costs for the new institution.\n\nIn November 1905 the government funding was confirmed. The final Report of the Committee was published in January 1906, recommending combining the institutions into one. The 1851 Commissioners would make land available.\n\n1907 - Signing of the Charter forming Imperial College\n\nThe final Report of the Board of Education Committee was published in January 1906, recommending combining the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines and the City & Guilds College into one institution.\n\nNegotiations on detail amongst the governing bodies of the institutions continued and in February 1907, the Board of Education issued a letter outlining its deliberations. On 26 March at the Old RSM old students dinner, the President of the Board of Education, Mr McKenna, read out some of a draft of the Charter of Imperial College. A list of members of the Governing Body was issued on 1 July and the charter forming Imperial College, was granted on 8 July.\n\n1909 - Construction commences on Goldsmith's Extension and Royal School of Mines\n\nIn 1909, construction commenced on the Goldsmith's Extension and Royal School of Mines. It had become clear that the new institution, Imperial College, needed a new building to begin its expanded brief in. The 1851 Commission granted land, and an extension to the City and Guilds Building was funded by the Goldsmiths Company with the Royal School of Mines building being funded by benefactions from the Wernher, Beit and Company and the Bessemer Memorial Fund equipping the Metallurgy laboratories. The architect for the construction was Aston Webb.\n\nExactly two years after the creation of Imperial College, the foundation stone was laid on 8 July 1909 by Edward VII.\n\n1910 - City & Guilds Delegacy\n\nIncorporating the City & Guilds College into Imperial College involved altering the Charters of the City & Guilds of London Institute, the City & Guild College’s parent body and Imperial. The C&G Delegacy replaced the temporary committee of management set up by the City and Guilds of London Institute until satisfactory negotiations regarding control were completed.\n\nThe City & Guilds Delegacy was the outcome, comprising 19 members from the CGLI, the Goldsmith’s Company and Imperial’s Governing Body. It was responsible both to the CGLI and Imperial’s Governing Body for the administration of the C&GC. As all engineering subjects were deemed part of the C&GC, an Engineering Board was set up to advise Imperial’s Board of Studies.\n\nSir Walter Prideaux (1846-1928) Knight Clerk to the Goldsmith's Company, was one of the first members of the Governing Body and the Delegacy, serving 1907-1919.\n\n1912 - Bessemer laboratory opens\n\nThe Bessemer Laboratory for Metallurgy, funded by the Bessemer Memorial Fund, opened in 1912.\n\nIt was established at the same time as the drive for a College such as Imperial and so deemed an integral part of the new institution.\n\n1913-14 - Beit Buildings completed\n\nThe original Students Union building in the north of the quad was designed by Sir Aston Webb and built in 1910-11. The idea for a building came from Sir Arthur Acland, a member of the governing body. He saw the need for a place in which students could meet and develop a collegiate social life. Sir Arthur 'emphasised the value in the life of students of a spirit of good comradeship, without which a student career was of little account'.\n\nThe east side was designed to house the departments of botany, plant pathology and physiology and was completed in 1914.\n\n1914-18 - The College at war\n\nBy the outbreak of the First World War, there were approximately 900 students in college. Some 300 of them volunteered for war in 1914, joined by 60 staff members.\n\nThe South Kensington site was affected by the commencement of hostilities with buildings commandeered for war billeting of soldiers and military work. The War Office pay office took over the top two floors of Goldsmith's extension and RSM rooms and the Army Pay Corps Machine Gun section commandeered the RSM examination hall. Admiralty Inventions & Research Board took over the Engineering Structures lab & hydraulics lab in Goldsmith's.\n\nThe Admiralty commandeered the Physics workshop for bomb sighting research. The Air board (royal flying corps) took over the Huxley building drawing office and printing press. The Air Ministry also operated from the engine testing house resulting in complaints of noise from their neighbours.\n\nIrish and Scots Guards Reservists also billeted soldiers in the RSM.\n\n1914-18 - Scientific contribution to the war effort\n\nThe College's most significant contribution to the First World War came from its inventions and scientific advances made throughout the war. Official badges were issued to those engaged in war work. Just a few examples follow:\n\nJ.C. Philip oversaw production of drugs in academic institutions\n\nJocelyn Thorpe set up a drug production line in the Chemistry department\n\nTrench warfare under the control of Martha Annie Whiteley who worked on lachrymatory gases; experimental trenches were constructed\n\nH. Brereton Baker worked on analysis of poison gases used by Germany, absorbants for gasses and a device for venting carbon monoxide after firing weapons in a pill box development and detection\n\nHilda Judd and Dorothy Haynes of Botany worked on cold storage for foods\n\nEntomology Department worked on insecticides\n\nAeronautical training was undertaken by Mechanical Engineering Professor W.E. Dalby\n\nAlfred Fowler, Professor of Astrophysics, worked on optics\n\nThe Metallurgy Bessemer labs worked on Ministry of munitions work\n\nMining Geology undertook oil testing for air ministry\n\nThe physics department was involved in x-ray research, fuels and engines\n\nThe Botany team worked on food science including large scale field experiments on wheat, cold storage, plant pathology and tropical hygiene\n\nThe Biochemistry department investigated adhesives for aircraft\n\nThe Entomology department worked on insecticides\n\nEngineering - Dalby - Admiralty Board of Inventions alternatives to steam engines in warships, diesel engines for submarines munitions manufacture\n\nJ.T. Irwin from Electrical Engineering developed a giant parabolic reflector at Dover used as an early aircraft detection device\n\nMorley Davis from Geology created a one millionth map of Europe\n\nPercy Boswell worked on glass sands with the Ministry of Munitions\n\nAlumni also contributed to the war effort:\n\nWilliam Sansome Tucker (RCS 1898-1902) as Major Tucker, was Director of Acoustical Research, Air Defence Experimental Establishment, Biggin Hill. He worked on artillery sound ranging in WW1 and afterwards continued government research on sound, that eventually led to the massive parabolic concrete sound mirrors still standing on the south coast, that would hopefully have detected the approach of enemy bombers. Construction was halted around 1937 when Wimperis set up the Tizard Committee on Radar.\n\nWilliam Watson (1868-1919), RCS 1887-1890 and later Professor of Physics. He became Lieutenant Colonel and Director of Central Laboratory of Western Front and died from exposure to poisonous gas from the gas shells he examined.\n\n1917 - Technical Optics Course established\n\nThe first technical optics course in the world was established in the Imperial Physics Department, developed partly in response to World War I and the need for the development of technical optics in the UK after reliance on German technology until the war.\n\n1919 - Founding of Imperial College Boat Club\n\nThe Imperial College Boat Club was founded on 12 December 1919, with Charles Bristow beginning a life long association with the Club. The club developed from a union of the three constituent College boat clubs.\n\nThe Club's first win at the Henley Royal Regatta came in the 1923 Wyfold Challenge Cup.\n\n1933 - Boanerges becomes the official mascot of the City & Guilds College Union after being bought for £40 in 1933\n\nBoanerges, or Bo’, is the official mascot of the City & Guilds College Union and is run by the City & Guilds Motor Club. The present Bo’ has been owned by the City and Guilds College since 1933 and has been maintained by students ever since.\n\nThe first Boanerges was a 1908 Rover which took part in several Brighton runs during the 1920s. However, the organisers began to realise that he shouldn't really take part because he was too young and he no longer became eligible for the run. The story of the first Boanerges' disposal is an amusing anecdote in the history of the college. He was driven to Downing Street (Ramsay Macdonald was Prime Minister), the gearboxes were promptly filled with gravel, and a well dressed dummy with a biscuit in his hand was left in the passenger seat. This was a protest against the recent knighthood of the chairman of a leading biscuit manufacturer. Apparently, the police had considerable difficulty in moving the car and so the Guilds students had proved their point.\n\nThe first Boanerges was never seen again although it was becoming uneconomical to keep the car running and in a satisfactory condition. After this event, a search was begun for a pre-1904 veteran which would be eligible for future Brighton runs. 3 enterprising Guilds students found a suitable car and the current Bo' was purchased for £40 in 1933.\n\nSince coming to the College, Bo’ has taken part in nearly every Brighton run for the last 65 years, and finished most of them.\n\nListen to a description of Bo recorded in 1957.\n\nRead more about Bo and shared your memories of the C&G mascot\n\n1934 - Hilary Bauerman Bequest\n\nA student in Metallurgy at RSM 1851-1853, and close associate of College throughout his career, even though much of it was spent abroad, Bauerman left a bequest to enable students to travel after graduation.\n\n1938 - Opening of the Boat House at Putney\n\nThe new Boathouse at Putney was opened by Lord Desborough, on 21 October 1938, designed and built by Charles Bristow.\n\nThe commemorative plaque from the occasion reads, \"May all who use this boathouse in it find such happiness and make such friendships as may endure throughout their lives.\n\n1939 - The outbreak of war\n\nFollowing the declaration of war, it was decided not to take in new students to the College. However this decision was rescinded on 17th October 1939 and College re-opened. Some courses were evacuated - Metallurgy, Metallurgy Department teaching for 3rd and 4th year students transferred to Swansea but the South Kensington Department remained open to provide instruction for students of others departments, conducted by Dr. S. W. Smith. 1st and 2nd year metallurgy students remained in South Kensington.\n\nThe Miners moved to Cambourne and the Biologists to their field station at Slough.\n\nAs with the First World War, many buildings were commandeered by the government and military including the Huxley Building, Henry Cole Wing, Beit, RSM and Boathouse.\n\n1941 - College life during the war\n\nAs students were unable to train with the University of London Officer Training Corps because of the Second World War, the Rector, Sir Henry Tizard (1885-1959) invited Major W.H. Bevan to address the students with the idea of them forming a Home Guard Platoon. \"C\" Company, 2 London, Home Guard, Imperial's own company, formed in September 1941, with the addition of some Royal College of Music volunteers later that year.\n\nAt first it was a student Home Guard Platoon, but in 1942 was joined by staff members from Imperial College Maintenance Party, the College war emergency group. C Company was responsible for an area including Kensington Gardens, Knightsbridge, Queen's Gate, Fulham Road and Old Brompton Road to Drayton Gardens. In all, 250 Imperial College students passed through the Company.\n\nMajor Bevan showed his high regard for the Company by obtaining special official appreciation from the military authorities in the form of two presentations to individuals of a Certificate of Good Conduct and Commendation. The Company was at \"Stand Down\" from 1944.\n\nOn 13th and 14th May 1944 some members of C Company, including Charles Benjamin Alcock, a Chemistry Undergraduate (1942-1944), shown in the picture, were part of the King's Guard at Buckingham Place.\n\nAn Imperial College Maintenance Party and Air Raid Precaution (ARP) centre was set up and housed in the RSM building with W. R Jones in charge. Many staff volunteered for night watching and weekend duties.\n\nThe Imperial College Administration and Maintenance Party was formed to undertake fire watching and other Air Raid Precautions. ARP duties were extremely important for the protection of College buildings and personnel. Dr H.J.T. Ellingham, Chemistry, played a leading part in A.R.P. activities, including the leisure aspects.\n\nProfs. Read and Sweeting volunteered for the permanent squad and for most of the 1940-41 session lived in the basement of the Mines Building, alongside Dr. Davies, W. S. Tweed and Faulkner of the Mining Department. They cooked and cleaned for themselves, sleeping in camp-beds (christened by Read as the \"Ghetto\"). The Fire Captain was the Head Cleaner of the R.S.M., Bill Guiver.\n\nSpecial regulations related to enemy air raids were applied during College hours. A loud bell warned of 'approaching raiders', often followed by another denoting 'raiders overhead'. Staff and students were instructed to leave their rooms and make for the basement. Early in the war this descent occurred about once a day but later in 1943/44 it frequently happened three times daily.\n\nThere were two direct hits by enemy bombs on College buildings, but no-one was injured. One bomb exploded at the rear of the RSM and one fell on the City and Guilds Waterhouse building, but did not explode.\n\nParts of the Beit Building were taken over to house military personnel early in the war, and returned to College in 1942. College was able to claim for damage caused during the requisition period, as were all owners of similarly requisitioned buildings.\n\nBut besides study and Home Guard/ARP duties, not to mention the problems of rationing and public transport, students carried on with activities such as amateur dramatics and sports. The Radio Society was shut down at the start of the war for fear of a breach of security.\n\nListen to Mrs Phoebe Arnold in a 1965 interview talking about the college during the second world war.\n\n1944 - Alumni and the Second World War\n\nBelow are just a few of the many alumni who contributed to the war effort:\n\nSir Frederick Handley-Page (1885-1962) City and Guilds (Finsbury Technical College 1901-03), founded Britain's first aircraft manufacturing company in 1909. During World War II his company produced heavy bombers, including the Halifax.\n\nAlan Dower Blumlein (Electrical Engineering 1903-1942) City and Guilds 1921-23 worked for EMI on a radar system, and adapted some of his previous work on circuit design technology for use in television to a 60 MHz pulsed radar. Accuracy of navigation was very important to the accuracy of bombing and it was to increase navigation accuracy that the H2S ground mapping radar was designed. Blumlein researched one format using the klystron as a transmitter, but development of this was slow, and the Telecommunications Research Establishment with GEC was speedily developing a system using the magnetron. It was during a test flight demonstrating the TRE/GEC model that Blumlein died as faulty maintenance of the Halifax caused it to crash.\n\nBruce White (Electrical Engineering 1902-05) directed the work on the Mulberry Harbours, the sheltered harbour structures used to land equipment and supplies in readiness for the Allies D-Day landings for the War Office. Advice was taken from staff in the Civil Engineering Department.\n\nA.C. Hartley (Civil and Mechanical 1908-10) worked on implementing the system for Fog Dispersal (FIDO - Fog Investigation and Dispersal) on selected airfields for the Petroleum Warfare Department. His co-workers included E. G. Walker (Civil and Mechanical 1902-04) and D.A. Fox (Civil 1933). The Chief Engineer for the contractors was W.H.G. Roach (Civil 1919-21).\n\nColonel Bill Hudson worked for the Special Operations Executive Section D \"ungentlemanly\" warfare section, and Mrs Yvonne Cormeau, who worked for the College Archives in the 1960s, was a member of the French Resistance, her code name being \"Annette\".\n\n1945 - Visit of King & Queen that Commemoration Day is named after (October 1945)\n\nKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1945 visited College to commemorate centenary of Royal College of Science, oldest forerunner to Imperial.\n\nKing George said: \"You students here assembled - men and women who soon will be going out from the Imperial College to your work in the world - have not only an opportunity but also a responsibility greater than men of science have known before. To you, I say: Regard your knowledge and your skill always in the light of a trust for the benefit of humanity, and thereby ensure, so far as in you lies, that science may never be put to uses which offend the higher conscience of mankind.\"\n\nListen to the full speech.\n\n1947 - Acquisition of Silwood Park Campus\n\nImperial College acquired Silwood Park in 1947, as a Field Station to provide a site for research and teaching in those aspects of Biology not well suited for the main London campus. Instrumental in this was Munroe.\n\nWatch a documentary made about Silwood Park in 1982.\n\n1949 - Felix - student newspaper - launched 9 December 1949\n\nFelix, Imperial's student newspaper, was launched on 9 December 1949.\n\nRead Felix online\n\nVisit the archive of Felix issues\n\n1950 - Inception of expansion scheme was 29th January 1950\n\nOn 29th January 1950, the government announced in the Commons that it was intended that imperial College should expand to meet the scientific and technological challenges of the 20th century. As a result, the Rector, Sir Roderic Hill, launched the Jubilee Expansion Scheme. Development officers were appointed, who investigated similar overseas and UK institutions. The expansion had to include both technology and science; plans for innovations such as computing were made, General Studies, Management Studies and History for Science and technology were all new subjects to be added to the curriculum. New buildings included a large library and a 1000-seat Great Hall.\n\nBetween 1953 and 1963, the government required Imperial College to double in size. Student numbers had to be increased to 3,000 during the quinquennium 1957-1962. The Rectors in office during this period, both Sir Roderick Hill until 1954 and between 1954 to his untimely death in 1966, Sir Patrick Linstead enthusiastically took up the challenge.\n\n1953 - Private visit to Imperial by Duke of Edinburgh\n\nShortly before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II May 10th Prince Philip visited College privately. Prince Philip has a strong interest in Science and Technology and its application to industry.\n\n1955 - Jez is donated to the Royal College of Science Motor Club as its mascot\n\nIn 1955 the students of the Royal College of Science were looking for a suitable means of transport for their President. On finding that there was a fire engine for sale, the students made an offer of £50 for the vehicle, but the owners, Joseph Crosfield and Son, decided to donate it to the students for its \"educational value\".\n\nThey travelled to Warrington to collect it, with their only introduction being a drive round the block, after which they faced a two hundred mile journey with considerable trepidation. The reliability of the fire engine was in serious doubt, and the problems attached to restarting the engine if it stalled, or indeed was deliberately stopped, appeared to be rather overwhelming. The average range for a man when operating the starting handle had been quoted as 25 feet. The brave four set out, and were soon tearing along, but the driver at the time claimed he was not quite sure whether he, or the fire engine, was in control at the time. The name \"Jezebel\" was eventually chosen due to the vehicle's temperament, which can be summed up by the following quote from a driver at Crosfield's: \"when not trying to turn around in a circle, Jezebel had a pronounced tendency to proceed sideways like a crab\".\n\nRead more about Jez and share your memories of the RCS mascot.\n\n1957 - The Roderic Hill building opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother\n\nA new building for Aeronautics and Chemical Engineering, named after Sir Roderic Hill, Rector 1948-1954 was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1957.\n\n1957 - College's 50th anniversary\n\n1957, the 50th anniversary year, saw College far into a great building project to accommodate the modern teaching and research facilities and students that would fulfil the vision for expansion in scientific and technological education. By 1957, the floor space had been increased by 20%.\n\nEstimates for the building work in December 1957 were: 85,000 cubic yards of cement, 3,250 tons of steel reinforcements and 6 million bricks! It was not all plain sailing though as disputes could not be settled as easily as Professor Blackett envisaged by imposing academic solutions.\n\nAlso in 1957, work began on the Mechanical Engineering Building, which was being constructed behind the Waterhouse designed City and Guilds Building.\n\nOther 50th birthday celebrations included a 50th birthday dinner held at Mansion House, a ceremony in the new Union Concert Hall and a College Ball.\n\nListen to a special 50th birthday radio broadcast about Imperial\n\n1957 - Exploration Board established\n\nImperial's Exploration Board set up to assist students who wish to travel and work on projects, with the first trip to Karakorum.\n\nRead about today's expeditions.\n\n1959 - Biochemistry Department\n\nIn 1959 the Wolfson Foundation gave £350,000 for a new Biochemistry Department, with Sir Ernst Chain as its first Professor.\n\n1959 - Weeks Hall is completed and opened\n\nAn increase in halls of residence capacity was a necessity and the opportunity to expand residences in Princes Gardens, the square across Exhibition Road, was enthusiastically developed with Sheppard Robson as architects.\n\nWeeks Hall was begun in 1957 due to the generosity of a donation from Vickers the engineering company which benefited from Imperial trained students. Lord Weeks was the Chairman of Vickers Ltd 1945 - 1956 and was instrumental in obtaining funding for the Hall, which was to include a summer conference centre for Vickers.\n\n1960 - Clem joins the Royal School of Mines as its motorised mascot\n\nClementine II (Clem) is the Royal School of Mines motorised mascot. She is a 1926 Morris T-type (tonner) truck and was bought by the RSMU in 1960 as a replacement for their previous mascot, Clementine I - a five ton Aveling and Porter steam traction engine.\n\nListen to a description of Clem from 1957\n\nFind out more about Clem and share your memories\n\n1963 - Special Relationship with the Indian Institute of Technology (Delhi)\n\nThe special relationship with the Indian Institute of Technology (Delhi) was launched in 1963. It was to include long term secondments of Imperial staff, the training of Indian staff and short visits to Delhi by senior Imperial staff. Professor Sir Willis Jackson headed the Imperial initiative and chaired the group involved. Professor N. P. W. Moore of Mechanical Engineering was the first seconded member of Imperial staff to visit Delhi.\n\n1963 - Department of History of Science and technology opened\n\nThe teaching of the history of science and technology at Imperial began in 1963, with the first Professor A. Rupert Hall. The department was based in Queen's Gate and taught postgraduate students.\n\n1963 - Princes Margaret opens Southside, Electrical Engineering and Civil Engineering buildings\n\nHRH Princess Margaret opened Southside Halls of Residence on 8th October. This increased student accommodation so that 20% could live in halls, compared to 8% in 1955.\n\nAfter she had opened Southside, she visited two other new buildings at South Kensington. In Electrical Engineering, she was given a demonstration of bandwidth compression and in Civil Engineering she viewed a model dam.\n\nListen to Sir Patrick Linstead’s speech from the official opening ceremony of Southside in 1963.\n\n1963 - Falmouth Gates given as memorial to Lord Falmouth\n\nThe Falmouth Gates were designed as a memorial to Viscount Falmouth, Chairman of the Governing Body 1947-1962 and placed at the East entrance to Imperial by 170 Queen's Gate. They were inaugurated by Lady Falmouth.\n\n1965 - Biochemistry Building opened\n\nOn Thursday 4th November 1965, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Chancellor of London University opened the new Biochemistry Building. She unveiled a commemorative plaque and was presented with a bouquet by Judith and Daniel Chain, the 8 year old twins of Professor Ernst and Mrs Anne Chain, Professor Chain being head of the Biochemistry Department. Listen to the opening ceremony.\n\n1965 - Nuclear Reactor opened\n\nAn increasing demand for research and training facilities in nuclear science led in 1961 to a Government announcement of a national programme for the provision of low-power nuclear reactors to be available to universities and colleges of technology. Three reactors were approved in principle, one to serve the needs of the South of England. The University of London subsequently decided that this reactor should be located at the Imperial College Field Station at Silwood Park where the College would be responsible on behalf of the University for its management.\n\nThe project was financed for an initial period of five years from 1962 by a grant from the Science Research Council and subsequently supported by the University with funds from the University Grants Committee. The 100 kW 'Consort' Reactor Mark II, which was designed jointly by the Nuclear Power Group of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Imperial College and by the General Electric Company Limited, commenced operation in April 1965. A new building adjoining the reactor hall was completed in 1971 and provides radiochemistry and physics laboratories, workshops and office and study accommodation.\n\n1966 - Physiological Flow Studies Unit opened\n\nFounding staff of the Physiological Flow Studies Unit included Professor Colin Caro and Bob Schroter. The creation of the unit was instigated by joint research between Colin Caro a physician and James Lighthill, an applied mathematician and fluid dynamist. They applied medical and engineering knowledge to study of blood and body fluid circulation and respiration.\n\n1968 - Opening of Linstead Hall\n\nConstruction was funded by an anonymous benefactor in 1963 who stipulated that dining facilities must be available for male residents. Originally known as New Hall, it was named Linstead Hall after Sir Patrick Linstead, who died prematurely in 1966. Sir Patrick was the Rector responsible for obtaining the land on Princes’s Gardens for student accommodation. It was his vision that every student should have the opportunity of spending a year in a hall of residence.\n\n1969 - College appeal launched to raise 2 million for costs towards student accommodation\n\nAn appeal for £2million for student and staff accommodation and for academic and general purposes was launched in 1969:\n\n£1.1 million for residential building and conversion\n\n£200,000 for the development of Silwood park, for laboratory blocks and student accommodation\n\n£700,000 for academic and general purposes as Imperial almost completely lacked endowment.\n\nSpeakers at the appeal launch were Lord Sherfield, Chairman of the Governing Body; Lord Penney, Rector; Professor M.J.Lighthill, Royal Society Research Fellow at Imperial and Rex Lowin, the President of the Imperial College Students Union.\n\n1969 - Demolition of the Imperial Institute and completion of Queen's Tower as free standing campanile\n\nFollowing the move of the Imperial Institute to the Commonwealth Institute, it became clear that the Institute building was no longer suitable for its original purpose of being a \"scientific research institution exploring and developing the raw materials of the Empire countries\". It was not adaptable to the College requirements for mid 20th century science and technology. It was agreed that the building should be demolished to enable the expansion of Imperial College and the building of modern laboratories, under the auspices of the governments plan for development of science and technology in higher education.\n\nPlans for this were well developed when a campaign against the demolition developed, led by the Poet Laureate and great supporter of Victoriana, John Betjeman. Press articles appeared and as the pressure mounted, parties on both sides had their say. As Lord Home stated - \"many will regret this change in the Kensington landscape. But it is symbolic of the needs of the times that we can no longer rest on the memorials of past greatness but must prepare for a new but different greatness of the future.\" Julian Huxley suggested in a letter to the Times that the situation be resolved by retaining the Collcutt Tower (now the Queen's Tower) as a free standing campanile. This compromise was accepted, though it took another ten years for this work to be completed, with the planning being undertaken by the Civil Engineering Department.\n\nDuring demolition, a casket was found under the foundation stone, the Bhownagree casket. This contained a lock of hair of Awabia Merwanje Bhownagree, the sister of Sir Mancherjee Merwanjee Bhownagree. Mr Bhownagree funded the colonnade which connected the Jehangir Hall with the Indian Gallery.\n\n1969 - Opening of the College Block (Sherfield Building) and Library\n\nThe College Block, including the Administration and Library Buildings, was initially known was opened by her Majesty the Queen, in November 1969.\n\nListen to a recording of the official opening\n\nWatch a film clip of the opening ceremony\n\n1995 - Merger with the National Heart & Lung Institute at Royal Brompton\n\nThe National Heart and Lung Institute's merger with Imperial in 1995 makes it one of the founding divisions of what later became the School of Medicine. It now carries out pioneering research on all aspects of heart, lung cardiovascular disease, with increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary work in the areas of biomedicine, biophysics and bioengineering.\n\nThe merger of the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 with Imperial College marked another step in the development of the Institute from its beginnings in the nineteenth century and subsequent mergers with: The Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest 1841, later the Brompton Hospital and its sister hospital in the East End, the London Chest Hospital; The National heart Hospital; The Institute of Cardiology; The Brompton Hospital Medical School and the Institute of Diseases of the Chest.\n\n1996 - Imperial wins University Challenge\n\nDuring the Jeremy Paxman era of the popular and intellectual UK quiz show University Challenge, Imperial teams have fared well, becoming series champions twice and runners up once.
