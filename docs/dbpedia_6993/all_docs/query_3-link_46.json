        "text": "New gathering spaces will include a glass-lined building featuring a pub with a small stage to host bands, DJs, comedy nights and more. A rooftop patio over the pub will provide an open-air space for gathering and dining, connected to the Cohen Lawn via a grand staircase.\n\nDesigned to engage students year-round, the Cohen Lawn will feature flexible outdoor seating arrangements, sheltered areas and fire pits. A covered performance stage pavilion and open-air plaza, along with expanded seating, will accommodate events and seasonal activities.\n\nCohen Lawn’s green space will be enhanced with the addition of a native plant garden, an oak tree grove and improved pedestrian access.\n\n“This project is an excellent example of how we can focus on wellness and inclusion in a multifaceted way to support the student experience,” said Susan Davis, vice president of Student Affairs. “I believe that it will transform how our students build community and form connections to both place and space at Northwestern.”\n\nJeremy Schenk, associate vice president of operations and services in Student Affairs, noted that the project reflects Northwestern’s commitment to creating holistic, student-focused campus spaces.\n\n“We know spending time relaxing and enjoying the outdoors enhances mental health and wellbeing,” Schenk said. “By creating this vibrant green space, we’re providing a dynamic hub for relaxation and socialization — with everything from planned outdoor events to casual interactions.”"
