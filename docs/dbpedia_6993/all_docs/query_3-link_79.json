The report highlights some of our inspiring graduates, delves into collaborations with our industry and community partners, and tells stories about the innovation, research, and community being built at Northeastern’s Roux Institute.\n\nThe report highlights our successes to date, but also invigorates us for all that’s yet to come. We’re looking forward to continued partnership with our Maine community!"
