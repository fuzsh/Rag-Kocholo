        "text": "Rev. Lars Esbjorn was the first president in 1860 when Augustana Seminary opened in the basement of the Norwegian Lutheran in Chicago, Illinois. Twenty-one young men were enrolled. Esbjorn and Pr. Abraham Jacobson served as the instructors.\n\nIn 1861, five graduates of the seminary were ordained on June 9, thus the first \"commencement.\"\n\nThe outbreak of the Civil War made the recruitment of students and raising money very difficult. In 1862, the seminary closed early so that Esbjorn could return to Sweden to raise money for the school.\n\nThe school moved to Paxton, Illinois, and Tuve N. Hasselquist became president in 1863. Five students — three Norwegians and two Swedes — were enrolled as Esbjorn returned to Sweden.\n\nIn 1865, the school received its official charter as Augustana College and Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 1869, the Norwegians wanted their own school and parted ways with the Swedes and moved to Marshall, Wisconsin. The name of the new school was Augsburg Seminary and Marshall Academy to distinguish it from the Augustana College and Theological Seminary in Paxton. Rev. August Weenaas was the third president. The school was the first co-educational institution maintained by Scandinavian Lutherans in America and enrolled 16 students. Wisconsin farmer Endre Endresen Eidsvaag gave a bell to the school, which was eventually called \"The Eidsvaag Bell.\"\n\nWeenaas left with seminary students and taught them in different locations in Marshall. John J. Anderson was named the fourth president in 1870.\n\nAugsburg Seminary and Professor Weenaas left Marshall and relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1872.\n\nRev. David Lysnes was named fifth president in 1876, and the school is re-named Salem's Seminary and Marshall Academy.\n\nBecause of westward migration and the convincing argument of Norwegian James Wahl, Commissioner of Immigration for Dakota Territory, to \"move with the people,\" the school relocated to Beloit in northwest Iowa in 1881, and re-claimed the name Augustana Seminary and Academy.\n\nThe Eidsvaag Bell became the subject of a legal argument over whether or not it was school property and could therefore be taken as the school left Marshall and relocated to Beloit, Iowa. The bell was impounded by the local sheriff from the platform of the railroad station so that it wouldn't leave town. Court action followed for two years when finally, following an out-of-court settlement, the bell arrived in Beloit in September 1883.\n\nIn 1884, the academy — and its bell — moved to Canton, Dakota Territory, and officially became known as Augustana College. Classes were held in a newly-built hotel that wasn't used for its intended purpose following the embezzlement of funds by the county treasurer to build it. This made it possible for the college to buy it for a fraction of what it cost to build. Professor M.D. Miller became the sixth president of the school and began to emphasize the liberal arts. Sixty-seven students were enrolled. (The seminary remained in Beloit until 1890, when its assets were moved to Augsburg Seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota.)\n\nHenry M. Solem was awarded the first Bachelor of Arts degree in 1888.\n\nIn 1889, Rev. Christian S. Salvesen became the seventh president and served only one year. In Sioux Falls, Richard F. Pettigrew, a lawyer and land developer, granted a parcel of land at the corner of what is now 28th Street and Summit Avenue for the construction of the Lutheran Normal School, now known as Old Main. Rev. Amund Mikkelsen was called to be its president.\n\nAnthony Tuve assumed presidency of Augustana, at age 26, in 1890. One-hundred-sixteen students were enrolled — 76 boys and 40 girls.\n\nEnrollment grew to 170 in 1891.\n\nDue to the economic panic of 1893, the church withdrew support from the school and it was leased to Tuve. College courses were discontinued, leaving only preparatory, secondary and normal courses offered.\n\nA second bachelor's degree is conferred upon Otto Schmidt in 1894.\n\nIn 1895, the Augustana College Association was formed to operate the college.\n\nOle Rolvaag, who wrote Giants in the Earth, graduated from the academy division in 1901.\n\nA new building is built on the east side of Canton to accommodate the growth of the school and was dedicated in 1903.\n\nIn Sioux Falls at the Lutheran Normal School, Ladies Hall — now known as East Hall — is built in 1905 to house girls.\n\nBack in Canton, in 1908, the first college paper, The Augustana, was published. Its aim was to \"... develop healthy school spirit, be a true exponent of school life, and an interesting median between the school and its friends.\" The first band was organized. A full 4-year business course was developed to prepare students for a career in modern business.\n\nIn 1910, the Augustana College Association voted to provide for freshman and sophomore college work.\n\nDr. Paul M. Glasoe assumed the ninth presidency of the college in 1916.\n\nThe last academic year in Canton, 1917-18, enrollment reached a record 324 students and 16 faculty members.\n\nBy action of the church, Augustana College in Canton merged with the Lutheran Normal School in Sioux Falls, and became Augustana College and Normal School (ACNS) in 1918; 195 students were enrolled. Professor H.S. Hilleboe became the 10th president. The Eidsvaag Bell was installed in the school's belltower.\n\nRev. Dr. Charles Orin Solberg became the 11th president in 1920, determined to expand the liberal arts curriculum of the college and improve the quality of the faculty. The Administration Building was built and the first baseball and football teams were formally organized at Augustana College and Normal School.\n\nThe Augustana Concert Choir was founded by Dr. Carl Youngdahl in 1921.\n\nThe Augustana Student Association (ASA) was organized; the college joined the South Dakota Intercollegiate Conference (SDIC) in athletics and became known as the \"Vikings.\" Blue and gold were chosen as the official school colors. Augustana helped to create the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra (SDSO) in 1922.\n\nIn 1923, Miss Julia Tisthammer received the first Bachelor of Arts degree awarded by the consolidated Augustana College and Normal School.\n\nThe first homecoming was held on Oct. 15, 1924.\n\nIn 1925, the Augustana College Association became the legal entity governing Augustana College and Normal School in Sioux Falls, and the Augustana Academy in Canton.\n\nIn 1926, Augustana was recognized as a 4-year college.\n\nApproximately 85% of the students were Lutheran in 1927; 13 denominations were represented.\n\nDr. H. J. Glenn, pastor at First Lutheran Church, agreed to serve as the 12th president for one year only and believed the key to the college's future was to hire more Ph.D. faculty. The Edda, the school yearbook, was first published in 1928, and for three straight years received All-American ratings.\n\nDr. O. J. H. Preus was named president No. 13 in 1929. Homecoming was officially recognized as Viking Days.\n\nThe first night football game was played on campus on Sept. 27, 1930.\n\nAugustana received accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1931. Arthur Larson was named the college's first Rhodes Scholar and Coach Lefty Olson arrived on campus to build an athletic program.\n\nIn 1932, music organizations increase in number and size with a string quartet, 40-member band, 75-member orchestra and a 51-voice choir. Rev. Clemens Granskou became the 14th president.\n\nIn 1933, the college purchased a home for the president at the corner of 26th Street and Duluth Avenue. This served as the president's home until the Fellows built a new home at the corner of 37th Street and Grange Avenue during the Balcer administration.\n\nJoe Foss, WWII flying ace, Congressional Medal of Honor winner, former governor of South Dakota and first commissioner of the American Football League, enrolled at Augustana in 1934 while Sig Mickelson, future president of CBS News, graduated.\n\nIn 1936, the Augustana forensics squad placed first in the nation at the Pi Kappa Delta speech tournament in Houston, Texas, and the football team won their fifth straight SDIC conference championship.\n\nThe gymnasium is completed in 1937.\n\nIn 1938, the faculty organized itself into three divisions: humanities, social science and natural science. An aviation minor was added to the curriculum, directed by Dr. Albert Hoyem, physics professor.\n\n\"The Huddle\" opened in the basement of the gym and Ole the Viking was created by Austin Kilian '42. Crown Prince Olav and Princess Martha of Norway tour the campus. The Forensic Department was given first place in the nation in accumulated records in regional and national tournaments over an 8-year period in 1939.\n\nOlson led the effort to build a new on-campus football stadium. Much of the materials and labor is donated by area businesses and friends of Lefty's. The total cost when completed in 1941 was $32,000. The stadium was built on the site of the college farm adjoining the campus. It provided seating for 2,600. The Moses statue and Humanities Center now sit where the stands and field were located.\n\nThe nursing program was developed; Olson's football teams won 10 of 11 conference championships in the SDIC; Augustana joined the North Central Conference (NCC) in 1942.\n\nThe beginning of the 1942-43 academic year opened with the largest enrollment in school history with 587 students. By Oct. 1, enrollment dropped to an official 561; by second semester, 1943, it was down to 410. On Mar. 1, enrollment dropped to 339. All of this happened as a result of the draft and enlistment of men into the military. Later that summer, Dr. Lawrence Stavig was named the 15th president. In the fall of 1943, Augustana became the third college in the NCC to drop football, following the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State College. All 29 members of the previous year's championship squad were in military service. Olson enlisted in the navy, where he became an instructor in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nIn 1944, students could prepare for specialized training in teaching the deaf, and a degree course in nursing was offered.\n\nSeveral barracks were moved from the Sioux Falls Air Base in 1946 to campus to accommodate a post-WWII increase in enrollment. The last of these temporary facilities was removed from campus in 2006.\n\nAugustana graduated its first international student, Kari Prydz of Norway, in 1947.\n\nIn 1948, an \"H-shaped\" barracks was moved to the east side of campus and became known as the Science Building.\n\nSometime in the late '40s, perhaps 1949, Professor of Art Ogden Dalrymple designed the official college seal.\n\nTuve Hall was built and Dr. Earl Mundt was named director of the Augustana Theater in 1950.\n\nAwards Day was first observed in 1951; it is now known as the annual Scholarship Dinner.\n\nAugustana was the first Lutheran college to offer a major in deaf education in 1953. Viking Varieties, one of Augustana's most beloved homecoming traditions, held its first show in the gym, opening to a full house. Dr. V.R. Nelson, chair of the Physics and Math Department, invented a “heart shocker” for use at McKennan Hospital.\n\nBetween 1954 and 1965, the college had 14 Woodrow Wilson Scholars, six Danforth Scholars, 17 Fulbright Scholars, four National Science Scholars, 22 National Defense Scholars, three Rockefeller Scholars and one Rhodes Scholar.\n\nMikkelsen Library was dedicated in 1955.\n\nSolberg Hall was built in 1956.
