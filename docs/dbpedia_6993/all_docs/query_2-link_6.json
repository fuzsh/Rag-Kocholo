        "text": "Universities have been around for hundreds of years. The 10 oldest universities were established before the end of the 13thcentury. Though some of the world’s oldest universities have split into different colleges or have become incorporated into a different institution altogether, it is a fascinating thing to take a look at how each university has adapted to modern contexts to remain relevant. Many of these universities are now among the world’s most prestigious and popular universities. With 6 universities in Europe, 2 in the UK, and 2 in Africa, there’s much to discover in the different histories of each individual institution. Here we present the 10 oldest universities in the world ranked by official founding year.\n\n10. University of Toulouse\n\nLocation: Toulouse, France\n\nEstablished: 1229\n\nAbout: The University of Toulouse was one of the earliest universities to emerge in Europe. It’s located in the large, modern city of Toulouse known for its art, history, and culture, but the city feels like a village. Since the closing of the university in 1793 due to the French Revolution, the University of Toulouse no longer exists as a single institution. However, there have been several independent \"successor\" universities inheriting the name under the association of universities and higher education institutions called Université fédérale de Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées(UFTMP).\n\nThe institution was formed as part of the Treaty of Paris in 1229, teaching theology. Law and medicine were added later. The university was split in 1969 into three separate universities, and the present-day University of Toulouse was founded in 2007. It no longer represents a single university, but is institutions under UFTMP are associated with the University of Toulouse, such as the National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse and Toulouse Business School.\n\nNumber of students: 100,674\n\nNotable Alumni: Thomas Pesquet, European Space Agency astronaut and is the youngest member of the European Astronaut Corps, as well as the last of the ESA astronaut class of 2009 to arrive in space\n\nNobel laureates: Jean Tirole, awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2014 for his analysis of market power and regulation\n\nFun fact: Since Toulouse is best known for its food, international students are in for a treat when they study in the region. As home of classic French country dishes, students can indulge in cassoulet, a nourishing meat and bean stew, and confit de canard, duck that has been preserved and cookies in its own fat.\n\n9. University of Naples Federico II\n\nLocation: Naples, Italy\n\nEstablished: 1224\n\nAbout: The University of Naples Federico II is a state-supported, public, non-religious university in Naples, a city sitting on the Bay of Naples and by Mount Vesuvius, the still-active volcano responsible for Pompeii. The institution is organised today into 13 faculties under three semi-independent divisions: the Division of Science and Technology, the Division of Life Sciences and the Division of Social and Human Sciences. These are responsible for the research and teaching of 13 schools and 82 different departments.\n\nIn 1224, the head of state Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, decided to create an educational institution that was not significantly influenced by the Pope. The institution was renamed Frederico II in 1987 in acknowledgement of its founder. It was created to facilitate the cultural development of promising young students and scholars, avoiding any unnecessary and expensive trips abroad, and has since has been in stable operation in Naples.\n\nNumber of students: 78,324 (Undergraduates 44,700; Postgraduates 33,600)\n\nMotto: Ad Scientiarum Haustum et Seminarium Doctrinarum(Latin); For the inculcation of the sciences and the dissemination of knowledge\n\nNotable Alumni: 3 Italian presidents; Samantha Cristoforetti, the first Italian woman in space who is also known as the first person who brewed an espresso coffee in space\n\nFun fact: Pizza Margherita was named after Queen Margherita Teresa Giovanni visited Naples in 1889.

The world’s first pizzeria, called Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba, opened its doors in Naples in 1830 – students can gladly enjoy a slice from the centuries-old establishment.\n\n8. University of Padua\n\nLocation: Padua, Italy\n\nEstablished: 1222\n\nAbout: The University of Padua is a public university in a city known for frescoes, beautiful arcaded streets, and stylish cafes that are frequented by students.

It also manages nine museums, including a History of physics museum.\n\nThe institution was founded in 1222 as a school of law and medicine, and was one of the most prominent universities in early modern Europe. The first two subjects taught were law and theology, but the curriculum expanded rapidly and by 1399 had divided into two universities for civil and Canon law and for the teaching of astronomy, dialectic, philosophy, grammar, medicine, and rhetoric. The university became one of the universities of the Kingdom of Italy in 1873, and ever since has been one of the most prestigious in the country for its contributions to scientific and scholarly research.\n\nNumber of students: 59,317 (Undergraduates 38,495; Postgraduates 20,822)\n\nMotto: Universa Universis Patavina Libertas(Latin); Liberty of Padua, universally and for all\n\nColours: Padua red\n\nNotable Alumni: Nicolaus Copernicus, astronomer who placed the Sun at the centre of the Solar System\n\nFun fact: Since 1595, Padua's famous anatomical theatre drew artists and scientists studying the human body during public dissections.

It houses the world's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world, Cambridge University Press. The University operates multiples cultural and scientific museums and provides its students with access to around 15 million books.\n\nIn 1209 groups of scholar congregated in Cambridge for the purpose of study, and the Bishop of Ely founded the first college at Cambridge, called Peterhouse.
