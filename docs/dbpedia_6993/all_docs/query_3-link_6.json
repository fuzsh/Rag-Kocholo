        "text": "Following the university’s founding in 1869, a campus was laid out on four city blocks and its first building, University Hall, was constructed. Built of wood and sun-dried bricks in what its builders termed the “Franco-Italian Style,” University Hall was an impressive structure to young people visiting the capital city. One student, born and reared in a sod house, likened it to the Parthenon. Such was its attraction and its adherence to the egalitarian ideal that Alvin Johnson, later to found the New School in New York City, fondly remembered a fellow new student who “had walked from Loup City, a hundred and fifty miles, on a broken ankle, to save a few dollars on train fare.”\n\nAttempts to impose a more civilized appearance on the campus landscape often were turned back by the harsh conditions of the prairie. Hundreds of trees were planted, only to perish, and the first flower beds were cut down numerous times by marauding hordes of locusts.\n\nEven University Hall paid nature’s toll. By the time the university erected its second building in 1886, old U Hall was crumbling back into the prairie, victim of frontier engineering and laxity in construction.\n\nBut the spirit of higher education prevailed in great leaders like Chancellor James Canfield. In the early 1890s, during construction of the new library, Canfield stood over its builders, personally holding contractors to specifications. The completion of this building marked a new era for the university—its collection of books and artworks were permanent declarations of learned civilization in a raw land.\n\nToday the old library appropriately serves the College of Architecture. Its turrets, winding staircase, and owls of wisdom are reminders of the great aspirations of its builders.\n\nThe Campus Expands\n\nAs the university’s mission grew, so did its size. A farm campus was established east of Lincoln in 1873. Separated from the city by an unbroken stretch of prairie, it was regarded by students to be a great distance from the main city campus. By 1904 the farm campus went beyond its own boundaries to establish an experimental station at North Platte, the first of many research centers that would serve the state in later years. NU made its first operational tie with the city of Omaha when that city’s then-ailing Medical College merged with the university in 1902.\n\nGrowth during the war years occurred amid fierce debate in the legislature over a proposal to consolidate both campuses on the farm campus. Put to the vote of the people in 1915, the proposal was defeated, and work was begun anew for expansion on both campuses.\n\nThe orderly development of the farm campus, under the scrutiny of Chancellor Andrews, included a number of large, buff-brick buildings arranged around a central mall. Despite this classical arrangement, the campus retained the feel of the countryside, with its barns, livestock and test fields.\n\nCity campus, on the other hand, developed in a variety of styles, experiencing rapid growth in the postwar years of the 1920s. This period brought such monumental structures as Social Sciences Hall (later known as the College of Business and currently as Louise Pound Hall), and Morrill Hall, also known as the University of Nebraska State Museum. Millions of visitors have passed through its massive colonnades to view astonishing displays of prehistory, including the remarkable exhibition known as Elephant Hall. The 1920s also saw the continued rise of athletic excellence at the University of Nebraska with the construction of two large-scale sports complexes—Memorial Stadium and the Nebraska Coliseum.\n\nBuilding Boom\n\nThe 1990s saw the start of a building boom on campus which continues today. The construction of such large-scale facilities as the Beadle Center for Biomaterials Research, the Kauffman Center residential learning community, a new building for Teachers College, and expansions of Memorial Stadium and the Nebraska Union were completed in that decade. In the new millennium, Innovation Campus and its Innovation Commons, Greenhouse Innovation Center and Food Innovation Center were added, and on City Campus, major renovations of several historic buildings as well as the all-new Gaughan Multicultural Center, Van Brunt Visitors Center, Jorgensen Hall (physics and astronomy), Othmer Hall (engineering) and Howard Hawks Hall (business) have been completed. Memorial Stadium's East Stadium saw a massive renovation, the Bob Devaney Sports Center was renovated as the permanent home of Husker volleyball, and the university partnered with the City of Lincoln on Haymarket Park and Pinnacle Bank Arena, catalyzing development of the Railyard District. On East Campus, the International Quilt Museum and the Ken Morrison Life Sciences Research Center were opened. On-campus residential living got a boost with major renovations and facility additions across traditional, suite-style and apartment-style facilities on both City and East campuses.\n\nThe University of Nebraska–Lincoln celebrates the 150th anniversary of its founding with a mission deeply rooted in its status as a land grant university. It is of national and international influence, with students from every state and more than 100 nations. It is a research university at the forefront of discovery in the humanities and sciences.\n\nIt is as it has always been, a place of pioneer spirit and restlessness, forever seeking the horizon."
