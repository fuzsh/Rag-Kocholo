        "text": "David Jonathan Handel, passed away July 31, 2024. He was born January 2, 1946 to Ruth and Milton Handel, of New York City. He often described his wonderful childhood growing up in the Bronx and living in Parkchester. David graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1962 and went on to attend Cornell University, earning a degree in Industrial Relations in 1966. He then proceeded to the University of Chicago where he earned his MBA in 1968.\n\nDavid was a servant leader in healthcare from the time he graduated business school and throughout his 42 year career. During the Vietnam War, he served in the Public Health Service from 1968 to 1970. Following his service, he served in senior management positions with Northwestern University Medical Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Indiana University Hospitals, and Clarian, now IU Health. David moved to Indianapolis in 1985 to be CEO of IU Hospitals (University and Riley). He was on the executive team that led to the legal consolidation of Methodist Hospital and the IU Hospitals to create Clarian that now does business as Indiana University Health (IU Health). David was the first Executive Vice President and COO of Clarian. Upon retiring from Clarian in 2004, David continued to serve the Indiana healthcare community as Director of the Indiana University Masters of Health Administration Program. Other contributions included serving on the boards of the Sisters of St. Francis Health System, St. Vincent Health, and the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indianapolis. In 2011, David fully retired and transitioned to volunteer work founding the Executive Volunteer Services Program (EVS) in which high-level retired executives work with local nonprofits that need pro bono assistance.\n\nDavid’s commitment to healthcare, however, was surpassed by his commitment to his family. His love for his wife of 53 years was evident every day as he would frequently credit her for the gifts in their life. Some of his favorite times were with his children, whether it was scout camping overnights, travel soccer tournaments, watching marching band competitions and orchestra performances, or family trips home and abroad. His grandsons delighted him and he was always proud of each of them and their unique talents. Retirement provided more opportunities to travel and for David to pursue additional hobbies both with Julie and his friends. Whether it was bike tours exploring multiple countries and continents, taking the whole family on a trip or playing pickleball, disc golf or racquetball, he was dedicated to spending time and investing in his family and friends. And if he had downtime, he could always be found with a book in hand or a list of numerous books on hold at the Public Library.\n\nDavid is survived by his wife Julia Noll Handel, his son Daniel A. Handel (Nicole Chao, grandsons Zachary and Logan Handel), daughter Jennifer Handel Richter (Adam Richter, grandsons Landon and Isaac Richter), brother Stephen Handel (MaryAnn and nephew Mark Handel), and in-laws Maurice, William, John (Terri), and Robert Noll, and Mary (Greg) Slack.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held on Saturday, August 10th at 4pm, with visitation beginning at 3pm, at Randall and Roberts Fishers Mortuary, 12010 Allisonville Rd, Fishers, IN.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, David’s family suggests donations to the Hamilton East Public Library or a Non-Profit of personal significance.\n\nCondolences: www.randallroberts.com"
