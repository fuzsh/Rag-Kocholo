According to the Richmond Palladium-Item, the center offered night classes for the first two years of college credit, postgraduate classes for teachers, non-credit courses, and popular lectures. Classes were held at Earlham College, which benefitted from the collaboration because IU offered courses not previously offered at Earlham, such as economics and accounting. Students could receive credits from either IU or Earlham and veterans could take courses as part of their GI Bill benefits. IU East’s 2011 Self-Study noted that in the institution’s early years it “functioned well in fulfilling the purposes of a community college model by providing services aligned with predominantly non-traditional learners,” such as associate degrees and conveniently-located tutorials.\n\n[2] “Johnson Replaces Huff As Head Of Earlham-IU Center,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), July 6, 1962, 1, accessed Newspapers.com; “Educators Discuss New College Center,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), June 14, 1967, accessed Newspapers.com; “Earlham to Lead Educational Venture: 3 Universities Join Local College; To Expand Courses On 2-Year Basis,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), July 17, 1967, 1, accessed Newspapers.com; Advertisement, “The Eastern Indiana Center of Earlham College in Cooperation with Ball State University—Indiana University—Purdue University,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), September 5, 1967, 4, accessed Newspapers.com; I.U. East Self-Study Committee, A Special Indiana University Trustees Report on IUPUI and the Regional Campuses, vol. 2, Appendices A-I, (May 20, 1971), 12-13, Indiana State Library.\n\nIn 1967, Purdue University and Ball State University partnered with Earlham College and Indiana University to expand the center’s vocational and technical courses. A 1967 newspaper advertisement billed the reorganized center as the “Eastern Indiana Center of Earlham College in Cooperation with Ball State University—Indiana University—Purdue University.” IU East’s 1971 Special Indiana University Trustees Report described the venture as a “quadripartite consortium” that “provided a unique program of courses for students who could select various degree objectives available at any of the four institutions.” The Richmond Palladium-Item noted that Purdue would teach technology and engineering, IU would offer business and liberal arts courses, and Ball State would specialize in education and industrial arts classes. Earlham had “primary responsibility for monitoring the new center” and would provide facilities, administrative services, and housekeeping. The three other universities would share in the budget. According to the 1967 article “Earlham to Lead Educational Venture,” Earlham President Landrum Bolling described the collaboration as a “unique example of cooperation between the independent liberal arts college and state supported public education which will be widely watched in educational circles.”\n\n[3] “Building Plans Encouraged for Eastern Indiana Center,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), March 2, 1969, 7, accessed Newspapers.com; “Community College Good Idea,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), August 1, 1969, 22, accessed Newspapers.com; Emmett Smelser, “Community College Is Bright Star on Horizon,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), December 21, 1969, 22, accessed Newspapers.com; “University Board Gives Full Approval,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), September 18, 1970, 1, accessed Newspapers.com; Emmett Smelser, “IU Ties ‘Only Way’ For Local College,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), September 20, 1970, accessed Newspapers.com; Emmett Smelser, “Leaders Generally Enthusiastic About Regional Campus of IU,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), September 20, 1970, accessed Newspapers.com; “Assembly Now Holds Key to Start of IU Campus,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), March 4, 1971, accessed Newspapers.com; Minutes of the Board of Trustees of Indiana University, Bloomington, April 24, 1971, 7, submitted by applicant; I.U.

By 1970, the community and local businesses raised funds for a new campus, investing in the education of their residents. The new facility accommodated more full-time students by offering daytime classes. A piece in the Palladium-Item titled “Community College Good Idea” contended that the “vocational phase of the curriculum will help Richmond lower its shortage of skilled labor.” The piece noted that officials sought to locate the new campus near I-70 and U.S. 27 because “By being located on the interstate highway, the center would be within easy driving range for residents from Connersville, New Castle, Winchester, Union City and Knightstown.” IU assumed administrative responsibilities of the new campus, rather than Earlham College.\n\n[4] “University Board Gives Full Approval,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), September 18, 1970, accessed Newspapers.com; Emmett Smelser, “IU Ties ‘Only Way’ for Local College,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), September 20, 1970, accessed Newspapers.com; Emmett Smelser, “Leaders Generally Enthusiastic About Regional Campus of IU,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), September 22, 1970, accessed Newspapers.com; “Better Off As Regional Campus,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), October 15, 1970, accessed Newspapers.com; “Assembly Now Holds Key to Start of IU Campus,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), March 4, 1971, accessed Newspapers.com; “Indiana University East Is New Name for Center,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), April 30, 1971, accessed Newspapers.com; I.U.

With the new campus, the North Central Association transferred accreditation from Earlham College to IU East. A 1970 Richmond Palladium-Item piece reported that the new campus was originally proposed as a community college. However, in order to be eligible for federal grants, it needed regional status. Another Richmond Palladium-Item article published in September 1970 described the benefits of becoming a regional campus, noting “in additional to federal funds available will be all the administrative, architectural and technical skills and academic prestige of a great university.” The IU East regional campus also enabled “both area industries’ employes [sic] and employes’ [sic] children to acquire advanced education for a lower cost than going away for that schooling.”\n\n[5] “IU East ‘Initiates’ New Building,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), December 11, 1974, accessed Newspapers.com; “IU East Advisory Board Meets, Learns Dedication to Be Feb. 22,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), December 12, 1974, accessed Newspapers.com; “It’s Moving Time for IU East,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), December 22, 1974, accessed Newspapers.com; Invitation, Palladium-Item (Richmond), February 23, 1975, accessed Newspapers.com; Indiana University East, Master Plan for Development, 1976-1986, (August 10, 1976), XII-1, Indiana State Library; Minutes of the Board of Trustees of Indiana University, Indiana University Bloomington, May 8, 1992, 12, 14, submitted by applicant; Keena D.

In December 1974, construction was completed on IU East’s first building, located on Chester Boulevard, and classes began in January 1975. The community raised funds for the new campus in 1970 (see footnote 3). IU East was a one building campus until Hayes Hall was constructed in 1992. Hayes housed the school’s new library and provided eleven additional classrooms. Board of Trustees notes show that, with the new building, trustees named the original building “Whitewater Hall” that same year. The Palladium-Item noted in September that Whitewater had undergone renovations for six month, improving the science labs, centralizing student services, and offering a classroom for courses offered through the Indiana Higher Education Television System. IU East hosted the building’s grand reopening in October with an open house exploring five decades of jazz. John Hasse, Grammy nominee and curator of the American Music at the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution, presented a tribute to musicians like Hoagy Carmichael and Duke Ellington.\n\n[6] Program, Indiana University East Dedication Week, February 16-23, 1975, submitted by applicant; Invitation, Palladium-Item (Richmond), February 23, 1975, accessed Newspapers.com; “Registrations Pour In, IU East Adds 5 Sections,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), January 11, 1976, accessed Newspapers.com; Indiana University East, 1977/79 Bulletin, 34, submitted by applicant; “Potential, Practicing Teachers Can Take Many Classes at Indiana University East,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), January 2, 1977, accessed Newspapers.com; “Dave Stouffer to Get First 4-Year Degree Earned Completely on IU East Campus,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), May 8, 1977, accessed Newspapers.com; Program, 1977 Commencement, IU East, Sixth Annual Commencement, Wednesday, May 11, 6, submitted by applicant; “Six Certificates in Engineering Technology New IU East Offering,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), August 7, 1977, accessed Newspapers.com; “Trustees Hear from IU East Students on 4-Year Degree,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), June 4, 1978, accessed Newspapers.com; Minutes of the Board of Trustees of Indiana University, Indiana University East, November 2, 1979, 3, submitted by applicant; “IU East Honors Record Number of Graduates,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), May 14, 1983, accessed Newspapers.com; Susan Loughmiller, “IU East Has Ok to Offer 4-Year Degrees,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), August 25, 1983, accessed Newspapers.com; “IU East Is Looking to 4-Year Degrees,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), January 29, 1984, accessed Newspapers.com; “IU East Honors Record Number of Graduates,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), May 14, 1983, accessed Newspapers.com; “IU East Honors 91 Graduates,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), May 12, 1984, accessed Newspapers.com; “IU East Gets OK for Nursing Program,” Palladium-Item (Richmond), July 2, 1984, accessed Newspapers.com; Indiana University East, Report to the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools: Self-Study (2011), i-2, accessed https://www.iue.edu/chancellor/documents/self-study.pdf.\n\nIndiana University East’s new campus, the sixth regional campus of the IU system, was dedicated on February 23, 1975. The Richmond Palladium-Item reported the following year that registration at the new campus was so high that IU East had to add five class sections. The university soon expanded its offerings, including new certificates in engineering technology offered through Purdue University. These certificates included “Quality Control and Planning” and “Mechanical Tool Design,” meeting the vocational needs of the local community. In addition to technology, IU East also expanded graduate courses for teachers, such as “Diagnosis and Remediation of Learning Disabilities 2” and “Theory and Practice of Exposition.”\n\nSince its beginnings in 1946, IU East offered associate degrees and courses for the first two years of college credit. In 1977, the Richmond Palladium-Item reported that Dave Stouffer earned the first bachelor degree at IU East. He received a Bachelor of General Studies, which was an “external degree.” The newspaper noted that Stouffer “was able to earn his degree at IU East through the auspices of the IU School of Continuing Studies. IU East . . . now also is able to offer the external degree as an IU systemwide school.” IU East’s 1977/79 Bulletin described the external degree program, stating it was “designed especially for individuals who need greater freedom in timing and pacing of their learning experiences or who are interested in taking courses at a more leisurely pace.” In 1978, the paper reported that students lobbied the school for bachelor’s degrees in other fields. Student Gene Huckery informed trustees that the “campus loses many students each year through transfer to four-year schools or through a ‘drop-out’ process when they have completed a two-year curriculum at the local campus.” The Richmond Palladium-Item noted that although it offered a B.S. in general studies, the degree did not allow for a major. By 1984, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education gave approval to IU East to offer bachelor’s degrees. At the end of that year, IU East advertised bachelor’s degrees in nursing and the school continued to expand its B.S. offerings. As of 2018, IU East offers fifty academic programs, as well as online programs, and over 800 courses that range from Financial Forensic Investigations to Sports Marketing & Management."
