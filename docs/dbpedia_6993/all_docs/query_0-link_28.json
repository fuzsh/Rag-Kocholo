        "text": "As one of the country's first public universities, Miami University was made possible by a law that President George Washington signed in 1795. Our institution was officially chartered in 1809 and welcomed its first students in 1824.\n\nIn the following years, Benjamin Harrison would attend, graduate, and go on to serve as the 23rd President of the United States. Another notable alumnus is Professor William Holmes McGuffey, who taught at Miami from 1826 to 1836. During this time, he performed research for his Eclectic Readers series, which would revolutionize education for generations of Americans.\n\nIn the years that followed, Miami's reputation grew as quickly as its enrollment. Once referred to as the \"Yale of the West\" for its ambitious liberal arts curriculum, Miami consistently ranks among the nation's top public universities for the quality of teaching and overall student experience."
