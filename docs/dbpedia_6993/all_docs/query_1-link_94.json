        "text": "A four-year non-denominational school in Chicago, East-West University primarily caters to minority populations. East-West University’s goal is to give students opportunities that they might not otherwise have. The administrators at the college hope that by attending East-West University students will gain a unique perspective on life. Administrators also hopes that students will “gain great insights, engage in valuable dialog, make lifelong friends, and are welcomed and valued at East-West University.”\n\nEnrolling nearly 1,200 students and offering majors such as; government, urban planning and social work, students can use the knowledge they learned in school to help their communities and truly make a difference. It is the goal of administrators at East-West University that upon graduation students will become “an honorary citizen of the world.”\n\nStudent History\n\nFounded in 1980, East-West University’s goal was to provide quality education to students who might not have access to it. A college that was both multi-cultural and affordable that challenged students to make a difference, not just in their lives but those around them.\n\nFurthermore, East-West University continues to break barriers by being one of the top private schools that offer the lowest tuition in the Chicago area. It’s also credited with being the only majority-minority school in Illinois. Furthermore, East-West University has the highest number of international students in the country.\n\nCampus Life\n\nStudents live off campus as East-West University as the school does not offer residency. With many housing opportunities in Chicago, students don’t tend to have trouble finding housing and even tend to room with fellow East-West students. Living and going to school in the city, students are constantly immersed in Chicago’s culture. Whether they’re dining in Chinatown, shopping in the Windy City or visiting museums, there are endless opportunities for fun within the city limits. Students can also find professional opportunities such as part-time jobs and internships in their majors.\n\nWhat East-West University lacks in resident halls, they make up with organizations and events held at the school. Students can participate by writing in the newspaper or joining theatre.\n\nEast-West University also hosts the East-West Perspective lectures on campus that are free to attend. In the past they have had many notable speakers such as architect Jeanne Gang, investment manager Louis Holland, and former Chicago Tribune journalist Mike Conklin.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nThe financial aid department at East-West University offers many scholarships (both merit and financial need), loans, and grants to students who need financial assistance.\n\nTuition for East-West University costs close to $19,000 a year. Students can pay by credit card, check, payment plans, or deferred payment. In the 2010-2011 school year, 100% of students who were found to have financial need received some form of it. The average package that was awarded to students by the college was close to $14,000. Upon graduation, students can expect to be in debt by less than $4,000."
