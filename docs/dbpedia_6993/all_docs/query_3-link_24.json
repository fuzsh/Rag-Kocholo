Citations are issued to vehicles without a valid permit and parked prior to the opening of garages, at 7 a.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nParking is free from 6 p.m. on Friday through 7 a.m. on Monday, unless otherwise noted. If you have an EM-P permit, you may access the garages free of charge any time.\n\nGated facilities require hourly payment upon exit when the gates are lowered, unless a valid permit is scanned for entry. Non-gated facilities require a valid permit be displayed beginning at 7 a.m. weekdays.\n\nWe accept CrimsonCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, or Visa. As of June 1, 2021, cash payments will not be accepted."
