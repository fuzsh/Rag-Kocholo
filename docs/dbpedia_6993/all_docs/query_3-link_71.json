        "text": "The faculty in the Department of Supply Chain Management (SCM) at Michigan State are global industry leaders and are considered the voice of the SCM field. We hold the prestigious reputation of offering the top-ranked undergraduate and graduate offerings in the country.\n\nWe equip graduates with a competitive edge. Through an integrative educational approach, we prepare students for the next era of SCM and careers in areas such as procurement, manufacturing, inventory management, warehousing, logistics and transportation.\n\nDepartment Information Sheet\n\nPushing the Envelope in Supply Chain Management\n\nWelcome to the Department of Supply Chain Management at MSU’s Broad College. Our team comprises about 40 individuals: tenure-stream professors, fixed-term instructors, academic specialists, staff and doctoral students, each with a passion to push the frontier of supply chain management research and educate the highest quality students that would make a difference in practice. The collective outcome is that the department is very well recognized for its expertise in empirically oriented research and our undergraduate and graduate programs have been ranked as No. 1 in SCM education.\n\nI joined MSU in June 2016 and am serving as interim chairperson till August 2024. My research centers on understanding employment dynamics, safety, and market behaviors in the for-hire trucking sector. I engage extensively with the practitioner community through webinars and LinkedIn commentary, in addition to serving as a source for various media outlets including The Wall Street Journal, NBC News, The Washington Post, and Reuters.\n\nThe SCM Department offers three levels of degree programs: a bachelor’s in supply chain management, a master’s in supply chain management and two distinct doctoral programs, in logistics and in operations and sourcing management. Our faculty also teach in the Full-Time MBA, Executive MBA and any number of SCM-related certificate programs. We focus on teaching our students at every level how to improve supply chain operations, take the cost out of the supply chain, reduce supply chain failures and mitigate supply chain risk. While our research is at the forefront of supply chain, we aim to make sure that the training we offer prepares our students for working environments challenged by Industry 4.0.\n\nWe have achieved our position because of the unique approach our SCM faculty take to research and teaching. Our focus is to bridge the gap between theory and practice — to identify and explore issues of current and future importance to managers using the methodological and theoretical rigor of the academic environment. This is one reason that we are consistently ranked highly — we do research that is not only done well but that has high impact.\n\nSupply chains are the institutions and processes that move raw material, works-in-progress and finished products from the fields, mines and oceans to our homes and workplaces to satisfy our daily wants and needs. Without supply chains, there would not be the products that society relies on, such as food, clothing, shelter and entertainment. The institutions or organizations involved in supply chain operations include material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and service providers such as transportation firms.\n\nSupply chain professionals source raw materials, manufacture B2B and consumer goods, manage inventory, run sophisticated warehouse operations, transport goods between businesses or to the final consumer and keep the world greener by developing better ways to use, return and recycle both manufacturing and consumer waste.\n\nFor example, one would expect the local grocery store to be stocked with all the products available from anywhere in the world. This includes cereal from Battle Creek, wine from France and sushi from Asia. While one may think that any grocery store maintains a large amount of product, it is only about a three- to four-day supply for many items, particularly those that are perishable. Grocers rely on just-in-time supply chains to make sure that shelves remain stocked with the products that consumers want."
