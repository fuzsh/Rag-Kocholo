        "text": "On February 22, 1853, one of these men — State Senator Wayman Crow — saw an opportunity to act on their vision and drafted a charter for an “Eliot Seminary” for the governor. The charter was signed into law the same day, effectively establishing the seminary. This action had not been discussed with the others and was a surprise to all, including William Greenleaf Eliot Jr., the St. Louis Unitarian minister after whom Crow had named the institute.\n\nNevertheless, under Eliot’s leadership, the men took their charge seriously and set about to build a university.\n\nOne of Eliot’s first actions was to change the institution’s name to Washington University to free it from any implied sectarianism or personal self-interest. Eliot insisted that Washington University remain forever nonsectarian and politically nonpartisan.\n\nWithout a prior endowment or backing by a religious or political group, or a single wealthy donor, Washington University’s growth was small at first. Evening classes for local St. Louisans offered the university’s first big successes.\n\nWhere is WashU located?\n\nWashU is in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nWe are sometimes confused with the University of Washington located in Washington state and George Washington University located in Washington, D.C., given our similar names.\n\nWhy is the university named Washington University?\n\nWashU is named for George Washington, the first president of the United States, because:\n\nThe university’s charter was (by a historical coincidence) passed on Washington’s birthday: February 22, 1853.\n\nThe trustees saw Washington as an important symbol and a uniting figure in the pre-Civil War United States.\n\nThe words “in St. Louis” were added to the university’s name in 1976 to better distinguish the institution in the national conversation.\n\nWhat are the symbols in the university’s shield?\n\nThe three stars and two horizontal bands are part of George Washington’s coat of arms and also represent the stars and stripes of the American flag. The three fleurs-de-lis at the bottom of the crest symbolize King Louis IX of France, after whom the city of St. Louis is named. The open book represents a university. The university’s motto appears across the pages of the book: Per Veritatem Vis, “Strength through Truth.”\n\nOriginally developed in 1896 by Holmes Smith, professor of drawing and history of art, the shield has undergone two notable redesigns, the most recent of which was in 2023.\n\nWhat is the university’s motto?\n\nPer veritatem vis; or “Strength through truth” was adopted as the university’s motto in 1915."
