        "text": "From Jefferson Medical College to Sidney Kimmel Medical College, and Philadelphia Textile School to Philadelphia University – we have a rich legacy. In fact, through unifying two widely acclaimed and highly honored legacies of innovation, education, research and professional excellence we’ve surpassed 300 years of combined history.\n\nThomas Jefferson University was founded in 1824 as Jefferson Medical College, and Philadelphia University was founded in 1884 as the Philadelphia Textile School. Both were ahead of their time and focused on the importance of experiential learning. The new Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University) was established on July 1, 2017 as a result of the merger of our two respected universities."
