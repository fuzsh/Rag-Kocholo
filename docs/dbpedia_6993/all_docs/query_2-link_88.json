        "text": "Welcome to the Department of Social Work!\n\nThe California State University, East Bay Master of Social Work program's philosophy and curriculum are grounded in the reality of an urban environment. We graduate practitioners who have a social justice focus and who are competent to work in a diverse, multicultural setting. The Department of Social Work is established to address the diverse social work needs and problems particular to urban, multicultural and multiracial populations, including issues of poverty, discrimination, racism, sexism, ageism, classism, ableism, homophobia, and other forms of injustice.\n\nThe mission of the Master of Social Work program is to graduate culturally responsive urban social workers in the areas of Children, Youth, and Families and Community Mental Health. Social work graduates are well prepared to address individual, family, group, and community needs caused by inequalities of class and identity, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, immigration status, religion, caste, and other forms of social injustice. Advocacy and social change to address these injustices form the core of the MSW program.\n\nOur Department's vision is to create a cadre of diverse leaders who will be catalysts for social change and transform oppressive systems in partnership with the communities they serve.\n\nThe Department of Social Work offers graduate instruction leading to the Master of Social Work (MSW) Degree to a diverse, multicultural and multiracial student population. The faculty, through teaching, advising and the practicum experience, works to foster a sense of activism, social justice, commitment to change and a new vision of professional competence in students admitted to the program. Currently, there are two concentrations: Children, Youth and Families (CYF) and Community Mental Health (CMH). Within the program of study, students engage in both academic classes and an internship experience. This unique melding of coursework and internship experiences is designed to provide students with preparation for effective social work practice in todayâ€™s increasingly diverse, complex, multicultural and multiracial society.\n\nSocial Work is a growing profession with extensive opportunities for employment. Social workers have over a hundred year history of working with oppressed and vulnerable populations. As we continue in the 21st century, social workers will maintain their key role as change agents assisting those in need to meet the challenges of living in an increasingly complex multicultural and multiracial society. Read about social work career opportunities for MSW Graduates.\n\nOur CSWE accredited MSW program was founded in fall of 2003 and we are celebrating our 20th anniversary in 2023! We now have over 1,000 alumni. Watch some brief interviews with current students and former students."
