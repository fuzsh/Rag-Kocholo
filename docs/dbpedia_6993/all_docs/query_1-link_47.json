        "text": "Our Mission\n\nThe Center for East Asian Studies (CEAS) is made up of faculty, staff, and scholars with academic, professional, and personal interest in the region of East Asia (China, Japan, and Korea). The Center aims to promote the study and appreciation of East Asian cultures by offering a wide range of scholarly, artistic, and community programs inspired by these cultures, and to expand the university's East Asian curriculum, library resources, and teaching materials.\n\nDepartments\n\nThe Center for East Asian Studies is a campus-wide center housed under the College of Arts and Humanities. The center is supported by the College of Arts and Humanities; the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences; the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences; the College of Education; and the Office of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nRelated Degree Programs\n\nThere are several degree programs in the School of Language, Literatures and Cultures related to East Asian Studies. Follow the links below to learn more.\n\nDr. James Gao (1948-2021)\n\nThough his work and memory will endure, Professor Gaoâ€™s death is a great loss for the Center for East Asian Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. His introductory courses on East Asian civilizations served as the foundation for East Asian Studies from where our students began their journey in the exploration and understanding of East Asia. His life and work will continue to inspire us in this direction. Professor Gao is survived by his wife, Laura Liu, and his son, Weijing Gao."
