        "text": "Carroll University, often called Wisconsin's pioneer college, is the first four-year institution of higher education in the state. In 1841, settlers living in the Wisconsin Territory community of Prairieville established the academy that five years later would become Carroll College. Soon after its founding, Carroll affiliated with the Presbyterian Church and adopted the motto, \"Christo et Litteris,\" which means \"for Christ and Learning.\" Carroll was chartered by the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature on Jan. 31, 1846, two years before Wisconsin became a state. On May 10, 2008, the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the institution's name to Carroll University, effective July 1, 2008."
