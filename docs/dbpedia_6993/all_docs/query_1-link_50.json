        "text": "Since our humble inception in the late 1940s, Stevenson University has continually evolved to meet the needs of students, gradually expanding both our physical presence and academic offerings. Here is a sampling of SU’s rich history.\n\n1947\n\nVilla Julie College is founded by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur at “Seven Oaks,” an 80-acre estate in Greenspring Valley, formerly the home of the George Carrell Jenkins family. The College opens its doors on October 1, specializing in medical-secretarial training.\n\n1954\n\nOfficial approval as a two-year college is granted by the Maryland State Department of Education. In that same year, a new classroom facility, Founder’s Hall, is opened.\n\n1965\n\nThe College receives Maryland state approval for a child development program and for transfer programs in the arts and sciences as well as teacher education. Shortly thereafter, the College is granted an “A” rating for transferability of credits by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.\n\n1967\n\nVilla Julie becomes an independent institution, separating from the Catholic Church. Control is vested in a newly formed Board of Trustees comprised of business, civic, and professional leaders.\n\n1971\n\nIn response to increasing enrollment, the College builds a multi-million dollar complex consisting of an art wing, learning resource center, and student center. Evening and summer sessions are inaugurated this same year.\n\n1972\n\nVilla Julie becomes co-educational, admitting its first full-time male student.\n\n1984\n\nVilla Julie becomes a four-year college, offering a bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems. Later, a degree in Paralegal Studies is added. The College continues to offer a two-year program leading to associate’s degrees for all available majors.\n\n1985\n\nAgain, in response to increasing student interest, the College constructs a new three-story laboratory building.\n\n1986\n\nThe concept of career education combined with the liberal arts becomes a hallmark of Villa Julie’s philosophy, Pro Discendo, Pro Vivendo: for learning, for living.\n\n1990\n\nThe College designs and installs a sophisticated computer network, enabling students and faculty to access software and library resources from any building on campus.\n\n1993\n\nCuvilly Hall is fully renovated and becomes The Student-Faculty Exchange. Containing an upscale cafe, a spacious reading room, and faculty offices, the Exchange provides an area for students and faculty to meet on an informal basis. Off-campus apartments are opened a short distance from the College this year.\n\n1994\n\nVilla Julie’s athletic programs are accepted into NCAA Division III.\n\n1995\n\nConstruction of the current Dawson Center, Inscape Theatre, Manuszak Center, Greenspring gymnasium, and science center begin as the first phase of the College’s master plan for the campus.\n\n1996\n\nThe Maryland State Department of Education grants approval for programs designed to prepare elementary and early childhood teachers. That same year, the College receives the endorsement of the Maryland Higher Education Commission for a Master of Science degree in Advanced Information Technologies.\n\n1997\n\nThe Dawson Center and Inscape Theatre open in August and the Manuszak Center and gymnasium open in November.\n\n1998\n\nA new Science Center opens with top-notch research facilities and equipment.\n\n2000\n\nKevin J. Manning, Ph.D., assumes his role as Villa Julie’s fifth president.\n\n2003\n\nThe Academic Link, the College’s unique academic assistance center, reopens after undergoing extensive renovations, including the addition of quiet rooms for students to take tests, space for student tutors, and an expanded computer area.\n\n2004\n\nVilla Julie opens its first College-owned housing complex in Owings Mills. The garden apartments and community center surround a quad perfect for campus activities.\n\n2005\n\nOn the Owings Mills property, Villa Julie opens the first of three planned suite-style residence buildings that accommodate between three and four students in a mixture of single and double bedrooms. The College names the residence buildings and community center after historical sites in Baltimore County, such as the Avalon Inn, and various valleys, including Cromwell Valley and Worthington Valley.\n\n2006\n\nThe College opens Rockland Center (a dining and student center) and the Caves Sports and Wellness Center on the Owings Mills Campus in the fall. Renovations to the Exchange create new space for the music program. The expanded Nursing Skills Lab offers a new home for SimMan, a life-like manikin designed to develop the clinical skills of nursing students.\n\n2007\n\nVilla Julie marks its 60th anniversary with the first Founder’s Day Celebration on Oct. 1. The first complete history of the College, A Vision and a Promise: Villa Julie College, is published. Construction begins on the School of Business.\n\n2008\n\nOn June 11, the Board of Trustees voted to change the name of Villa Julie College to Stevenson University.\n\nThe name Stevenson University is chosen for its perceptions of tradition, history, and academic quality-three hallmarks of the Villa Julie spirit. The name also maintains a geographical connection to the founding location of Villa Julie in Stevenson, Md. The Villa Julie name endures as the Villa Julie College of Arts and Sciences. With this change, the original campus in Stevenson is now referred to as the Greenspring Campus.\n\nOn the Owings Mills campus, the School of Business and Leadership opens to students in August. Housing the Divisions of Business and Legal Studies and Information Technology, the School joins the School of Graduate and Professional Studies as the second established within the new University structure. The 60,000-square-foot building offers cutting-edge classroom technology and a Mock Trial Courtroom.\n\n2009\n\nOn March 24, President Kevin J. Manning, Ph.D., approves the University Restructuring Plan, which supports the creation of three new schools within the Villa Julie College of Arts and Sciences. The plan divides the departments to form the new Schools:\n\nArt, Business Communication, Film, Video, and Theatre\n\nScience, Math, and Nursing\n\nPsychology, English, Human Services, Humanities, and Public History\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences will also include the Department of Education.\n\nOn April 30, Stevenson University names the new School of Business and Leadership after Baltimore builder and developer Howard S. Brown at an official ribbon-cutting ceremony. The school is now referred to as the Brown School of Business and Leadership.\n\nThe new residence hall, Wooded Way, located behind the Rockland Center, houses more than 200 students at the start of the fall semester. The building provides selected upperclassmen a unique “learning-living” experience. The first floor houses the Learning Beyond and Career Services Office and provides premier suite-style residences on the floors above.\n\n2010\n\nNew degrees and programs introduced this year include a bachelor’s degree in fashion merchandising, a criminalistics track in forensic studies, a sport management track in business administration, and a master’s degree in nursing. In the fall, the new Owings Mills gymnasium opens, encompassing approximately 60,000 square feet, featuring seating for 1,400, and offering premier athletic and fan amenities.\n\n2011\n\nThe University unveils a new 3,500 seat stadium on its Owings Mills campus. Designed to rival any facility found in Division III athletics, the stadium accommodates football, lacrosse, and soccer on two synthetic turf fields and provides a host of features for athletes, patrons, the press, and fans. Stevenson’s first football team and marching band debut in the fall, and the first women’s ice hockey coach is hired.\n\n2013\n\nThe Stevenson Men’s Lacrosse team won its first NCAA Division III National Championship against RIT on May 26, 2013, at Lincoln Financial Field with a 16-14 victory. The lacrosse team finished the season (22-2) with a school record of 22 wins and a 10-game winning streak. The Mustangs led the nation with 11 United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American’s and two Scholar All-American’s. Not only was this the first National Championship for the Men’s Lacrosse team, but was the first National Title won in Stevenson history.\n\nStevenson’s New School of Design opens. Located on the Owings Mills North Campus, the School of Design houses a new gallery space and sound stage in addition to classrooms and lab spaces for the University’s visual communication design and film/video students.\n\n2014\n\nTo have a tangible representation of Stevenson’s spirit, the University commissioned original artwork from Bart Walter, a nationally renowned plein air artist. The result was two sculptures that have become focal points for building new traditions: a 12-foot-high bronze rearing mustang and a smaller replica of it. Both pieces are installed on the Owings Mills Campus, with the larger located outside of Mustang Stadium, a landmark feature. The smaller statue can be found within the Stadium to spur on our student-athletes as they take the field.\n\nTo view a complete list of accomplishments, check out the 2014 Year in Review.\n\n2015\n\nTwo new NCAA Division III sports are added to the Mustangs roster. With the introduction of women’s beach volleyball, SU becomes the first DIII athletic program in the country to offer the sport. Men’s ice hockey becomes the University’s 27th NCAA DIII Sport.\n\nThe University launches the new Center for Forensic Excellence on June 15, which will serve as a resource for both forensic professionals and students and help cement Stevenson as a national leader in forensic education.\n\n“From Strategy to Reality” was unveiled as a publication highlighting the incredible transformation Stevenson has made over the last 15 years.\n\nTo view a complete list of accomplishments, check out the 2015 Year in Review.\n\n2016\n\nStevenson’s state-of-the-art, 200,000-square-foot Kevin J. Manning Academic Center opens on August 30, providing resources for the Beverly K. Fine School of the Sciences, the Sandra R. Berman School of Nursing and Health Professions, and additional space for the School of Design.\n\nKevin J. Manning, Ph.D., retired on November 29, 2016 after 16 years as President of Stevenson University. Manning was inaugurated as the fifth president of Villa Julie College in October 2000 and played an integral role in many of the University’s groundbreaking accomplishments. Villa Julie College alumna Claire E. Moore, who has served as Vice President of Student Affairs, begins serving as Interim President of Stevenson University.\n\n2017\n\nStevenson opened the Center for Student Success on the Owings Mills Campus to provide student resources and academic support services, including the Office of Student Success, the John L. Stasiak Academic Link, and the Experiential Learning Center. In March 2017, the Board concluded its presidential search and unanimously named Elliot Hirshman, Ph.D., President of San Diego State University (SDSU), as the new President of Stevenson as of July 2017. Prior to President Hirshman’s appointment at SDSU, he served as Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
