        "text": "The East End Transformation of the Danforth Campus is more than a construction project: It furthers the university’s mission and values, setting the course for the next era of academic excellence and service to society.\n\nThis transforming project includes eight major components — three new academic buildings, an expansion of the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, two new multi-use facilities, an underground parking garage and the expansive new Ann and Andrew Tisch Park.\n\nAnn and Andrew Tisch Park\n\nAnabeth and John Weil Hall\n\nHenry A. and Elvira H. Jubel Hall\n\nJames M. McKelvey, Sr. Hall\n\nGary M. Sumers Welcome Center\n\nMildred Lane Kemper Art Museum Expansion\n\nCraig and Nancy Schnuck Pavilion\n\nUnderground Garage\n\nSustainability\n\nAll new buildings on the east end have been designed to achieve LEED-Gold certification, and include solar photovoltaic arrays located on many of the roofs to generate renewable electricity. High-efficiency heat recovery chillers will harvest waste heat for much of the heating needs, and the underground garage will be capped with a green roof, creating a dynamic, car-free park above. The park’s landscape design features rain gardens with bio-retention, native plantings, and a diverse tree canopy. Low-carbon transportation will be encouraged with a new bike commuter facility which includes showers and lockers, electric vehicle charging stations, and a network of bicycle and pedestrian pathways to link campus to Forest Park and regional greenways.\n\nFind out more about the university’s overall efforts towards sustainable campus operations.\n\nDiversity\n\nWashington University has a strong commitment to the consideration and use of local certified minority and women-owned business enterprises (M/WBE) to the greatest extent possible. The university actively seeks to include qualified M/WBE firms when choosing vendors to be solicited and the encourages all contractors to seek M/WBE subcontractors and suppliers.\n\nThe university is also committed to the development of workforce diversity and strongly encourages women and people of color in meaningful leadership positions for all consulting and contracting teams.\n\nNews and Media"
