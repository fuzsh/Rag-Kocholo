        "text": "Take a walk through this timeline of significant milestones in UMBC’s history — from its beginnings as a plot of Baltimore County farmland to its arrival as a Research 1 university— and you’ll see how this community has lived its values of inclusive excellence from the very start. Welcome to our community of inquiring minds!\n\nSkip To: 1960s I 1970s I 1980s I 1990s I 2000s I 2010s I 2020s\n\n1960s\n\n1960\n\nThe Warfield Commission, appointed by Maryland Gov. John Millard Tawes, issues “A Plan for Expanding the University of Maryland,” which suggests transforming the state’s public teaching colleges (Towson, Frostburg, and Salisbury) into liberal arts institutions and creating three additional university centers.\n\n1962\n\nA commissioned study, chaired by John Curlett and titled “Public Higher Education in Maryland 1961 – 1975,” offers a plan that focused on functional diversity and independent development of campuses.\n\n1963\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly passes a bill to establish UMBC as one of four additional campuses of the University of Maryland. The legislation is the fruit of four state commissions – dating back to the mid-1950s – that recommended expansion of higher education in Maryland.\n\nThe University of Maryland’s Board of Regents approves a location for UMBC: A 435-acre tract of former farmland operated by Spring Grove State Hospital. The site was suggested by Maryland Comptroller Louis L. Goldstein, and the hospital’s donation of the site saves the state millions of dollars in costs to acquire land for the campus.\n\n1965\n\nAlbin O. Kuhn is named as vice president of the so-called “Baltimore Campuses” – UMBC and University of Maryland, Baltimore. (In 1967, he is named as UMBC Chancellor.)\n\nGround is broken at UMBC.\n\nDavid T. Lewis is hired as the first faculty member, heading the division of social sciences. He lectures on world populations, race relations, and even organizes a series of lectures on the energy crisis in the 1970s. Before he retires in 1985, he coordinates a documentary photography project on East Baltimore that becomes a book, Neighborhood: A State of Mind.\n\n1966\n\nWith applications already exceeding the anticipated 500 students, UMBC prepares for a year of firsts. The entire community is involved in the school’s opening. On the eve of opening day, twenty people show up and spend a Sunday tidying up the buildings, “including one lady who had read that we were opening and just came down to see if anything needed dusting,” Dr. Albin O. Kuhn said.\n\nUMBC opens its doors on September 19. On its first day of classes, the campus consists of three buildings: Gym I, Lecture Hall I, and a portion of the present-day Biological Sciences building. UMBC had 750 students, 45 faculty members, 35 support staff, and 500 parking spaces. The newspaper that would become The Retriever carries an article written to students by chancellor Albin O. Kuhn: “We do not expect UMBC to be quite like any other campus. Each of you brings individual backgrounds, talents, and education to our new campus. Collectively, you are a different student body from any previously assembled. In working with the faculty and staff of UMBC, make the most of this opportunity to help create a center of learning in which those who give their best in the laboratory and on the playing field develop a brilliance that is the mark of their efforts and the UMBC environment.”\n\nUMBC’s first student is Gabija Brasauskas Blotzer ’70, English, who chooses UMBC after her housing application to the University of Maryland, College Park is lost. She returns to UMBC twice after graduation to get teaching certificates in English and Latin.\n\nUMBC plays its first intercollegiate game on November 4, a spirited 4-1 loss by the men’s soccer squad to the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\n1967\n\nStudents enter a contest to choose UMBC’s mascot, suggesting unicorns, angels, muskrats, and crabs. But UMBC chooses the nomination of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever. And soon after, UMBC receives a donation of a puppy, its first live mascot, who lives at the Catonsville home of Guy Chisolm, UMBC’s first director of the physical plant.\n\nIn April 1967, Otis Redding performs “Soul Sound of 1967” at a semi-formal dance in the gym during the university’s first “spring week.” “Awesome Otis is coming!” trumpeted the headline in the Retriever. The concert, also featuring Redding’s twelve-piece band, the Upsetters, is broadcast to overflow crowds in the cafeteria. The legendary soul singer would die eight months later in a plane crash.\n\nThe men’s basketball team plays its first varsity contest after a year on the club level, dropping a 73-63 verdict to Catonsville Community College. The team would finish its first season at 4-7.\n\nThe Baltimore Colts play UMBC in basketball and the baseball team plays its first game. The first varsity men’s lacrosse game ends in defeat to Loyola College and men’s basketball plays its first varsity contest after a year on the club level.\n\nUMBC announces its first Winter Session. It is the first university in Maryland to offer such classes.\n\n1968\n\nPhase I of the university library opens.\n\nDebates spring up on campus on college and societal topics. A “Vietnam Teach-In” is held with opposing viewpoints represented and a “Time Out Day” focuses on issues facing students on campus and in larger society.\n\nOn January 9, the men’s basketball wins its first intercollegiate game, an 84-75 triumph over Eastern College of Commerce.\n\nMen’s and women’s tennis play their first matches.\n\n1969\n\nThe campus literary magazine, Dialogue, publishes a series of soft-focus nude photographs by artist Robert Stark, depicting a male and female dance duet. The publication draws criticism from legislators, despite the photos hanging in an exhibit at the same time at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and creates rifts between UMBC administrators and the university’s faculty and students. Read more in UMBC Magazine.\n\nThe UMBC’s women’s basketball team forms. They play (and win) their first game on January 11, 1969.\n\nIn the year of Woodstock, UMBC’s Sage Players stage “Keep the Peace, Baby,” a rock musical version of the classic Greek comedy, “Lysistrata,” newly translated by ancient studies faculty members Jay Freyman and Walt Sherwin. The play centers around a plot by Greece’s women to deny their husbands sex until they sign a peace treaty to end the Peloponnesian War.\n\nProfessors Walt Sherwin, Jay Freyman, and Rudy Storch found UMBC’s first overseas study program, “Rome: Ancient and Modern,” leading 42 students on a three-week tour that included stops in London and Paris, followed by two weeks in Rome.\n\nThe physical campus continues to grow with the opening of the Mathematics/Psychology building.\n\nSkip To: 1960s I 1970s I 1980s I 1990s I 2000s I 2010s I 2020s\n\n1970s\n\n1970\n\nCommencement for UMBC’s first freshman class is held on the Quad. In all, 241 students are granted degrees.\n\nUMBC’s first dormitory opens, housing 118 students. Two more dormitories and a dining hall follow by 1973.\n\nA sit-in is staged by students protesting faculty hiring and firing policies and the lack of reinstatement of four specific instructors. Students continue with a sleep-in and hold a peaceful rally the next day attended by 300. One result was the Faculty Senate’s acceptance of student representation on committees reviewing faculty and the development and use of an instrument measuring teacher effectiveness.\n\nIn September, UMBC is officially accepted into its first athletic conference, the Mason Dixon Athletic Conference. UMBC remains a member of the MDAC through 1978 and again from 1983-86.\n\nFollowing the Kent State shootings on May 4, students and faculty protest, picket and conduct teach-ins. A rally ends with a march to the Catonsville Selective Service Board office and the Catonsville Armory.\n\n1971\n\nAlbin O. Kuhn resigns. After a nationwide search, Calvin B. T. Lee, the acting president of Boston University, is named as UMBC’s second chancellor for the 2,800 students.\n\nThinking big, the Faculty Senate recommends that UMBC seek to increase total enrollment of 10,000 to 15,000 students.\n\nLecture Hall II, the Dining Hall, the Chemistry building, Dorm II (Chesapeake Hall), the physical plant building, as well as the campus greenhouse open. In the greenhouse, plant biology students and professors have studied plant immunity, drought resistance, and the development mechanisms of green algae.\n\nThe Fine Arts, Social Sciences, and Administration buildings open.\n\n1972\n\nThe Women’s Union forms and the first women’s studies course is offered. Gender, Women’s, + Sexuality Studies majors have gone on to work in women’s health care, equity economics, and as attorneys, teachers, and human rights advocates.\n\nThe fencing team, UMBC’s only co-ed sport, debuts against Johns Hopkins. The program continued for eight years. Now a club, UMBC Fencing provides fencing instruction and competition experience to students.\n\nThe UMBC Symphony is founded by Robert Gerle, a noted concert violinist, conductor, and professor. Gerle led UMBC’s orchestra program for two decades.\n\nThe first computer on UMBC’s campus arrives, a massive punch-card machine. The Univac 9400 took up an entire room, and students waited for days for the computer to crunch the data on their fruit fly study or math equations. The first programming class, in Fortran, is also offered this year.\n\n1973\n\nThe Fine Arts Building, the Social Sciences Building, and Administration Building open.\n\nMen’s basketball wins the Potomac Intercollegiate Conference Championship.\n\nUMBC Department of Theatre presents T. S. Eliot’s “Murder in the Cathedral,” which is the first university production selected for the American College Theatre Festival at the Kennedy Center.\n\nSenior class president Steve Rothfield ’73, sociology and education, invites noted psychologist B. F. Skinner to give the commencement address and receive an honorary degree. Skinner’s audience was receptive; psychology was UMBC’s most popular undergraduate major this year, with 140 graduating with a psych degree out of the 543 undergraduate degrees.\n\nUMBC awards its first graduate degrees.\n\n1974\n\nThe UMBC Department of Theatre presents You’re A Good Man Charlie Brown.

Sorority members would go on to hold voter education campaigns, pack boxes of donations for charities, and nominate UMBC students for their Black Girl Excellence awards.\n\n1975\n\nThe Office of Cooperative Education is created at UMBC. This office was the forerunner of today’s Shriver Center, which is established in December 1993.\n\nUMBC’s library, now known as the Albin O. Kuhn Library and Gallery, is expanded, starting this year, with the east wing. The unfinished concrete exterior, modeled in a Brutalist architectural style, is recognized by the Baltimore Chapter of the American Institute of Architects with their highest honors.\n\nIn December, the men’s cross country team wins its first Mason Dixon conference title, capping a perfect 10-0 season.\n\n1976\n\nUMBC awards its first Ph.D., in applied mathematics.\n\nAfter a spring semester of strong opposition from faculty and students, Chancellor Calvin B.T.

The choir will go on to perform with the Handel Choir of Baltimore and the Howard County Concert Orchestra.\n\n1978\n\nDespite its growing resident student population, UMBC is still largely a commuter campus. By the end of the 1970s, the university will have over 3,000 parking spaces. The first parking meters are installed in 1978, with a fee of 10¢ per hour.\n\nUMBC’s Natatorium, an Olympic-sized indoor swimming pool, opens.
