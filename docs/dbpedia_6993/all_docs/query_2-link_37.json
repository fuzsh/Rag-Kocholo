The Charter of 1650, which continues to govern Harvard, pledges the University to “the education of English and Indian youth.”\n\nFrom 1655 to 1698, the “Indian College” stood in Harvard Yard, on the site currently occupied by Matthews Hall.\n\nIt was not until 1970 that a program was established to specifically address Native American issues. In early 1970, the American Indian Program (AIP) emerged on campus."
