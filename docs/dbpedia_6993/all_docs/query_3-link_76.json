Faculty strive to maintain an open door policy for students to seek out additional information, to offer help with difficult concepts, or help to support students through the stresses of PA education.\n\nTuition & Fees\n\nFor tuition and fees, please visit our Registrar’s page.\n\nProgram Highlights\n\nWhy Choose the Jefferson Physician Assistant East Falls & Voorhees Program?\n\nOur Success\n\nOur job placement has been excellent for the past several years based on post-graduate surveys.\n\nFounding members of the PA faculty have been nationally recognized with awards such as the PAragon Award for Outstanding Physician Assistants by the AAPA and the Education of the Year by PAEA.\n\nOur Locations\n\nThe University and main campus is located in the East Falls section of Philadelphia.
