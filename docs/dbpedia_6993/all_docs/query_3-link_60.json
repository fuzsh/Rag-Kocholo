        "text": "Vision 2028\n\nOur goal is to build a future that is sustainable, equitable and open to all. Explore the ways we're making this happen with our Vision 2028 strategy.\n\nHero Carousel\n\nWhat is Vision 2028?\n\nVision 2028 progress\n\nWe are halfway through our ambitious 10-year strategy, Vision 2028, to reinvent the University and redefine Higher Education’s role in society.\n\nOur mission is to empower students for successful future careers, equipping them with skills valued by employers, fostering connections, and providing unwavering support in collaboration with industry partners.\n\nWe are diversifying talent in all industries and cultivating an inclusive environment where students thrive and contribute to a dynamic, rapidly evolving workforce throughout the world.\n\nWe've accomplished a lot, but it's just the beginning. Join us as we reflect on our journey and broader impact five years into our 10-year strategy.\n\nTo shape a better tomorrow, universities can't stick to the status quo. We must harness our influence as community catalysts and innovation engines to drive positive change. UEL's Vision 2028 strategy aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a collective global effort to create a fairer, more sustainable world. These goals are integrated throughout our strategy and impact initiatives, with clear frameworks highlighting their relevance to specific areas.\n\n1st\n\nDiversity of Thought programme won the Best University and Employer Engagement Strategy Award (Institute for Student Employers 2023).\n\n6th\n\nUEL is ranked 6th in the UK for annual graduate start-ups.\n\n10%\n\nIn the top 10% of the sector for employment-related outcomes.\n\nI encourage other universities, and indeed businesses, to draw inspiration from the urban sustainability work that UEL and Siemens are pioneering. Their approach to achieve net zero on UEL campuses by 2030, develop a unique Living Lab for realtime and real-world teaching and research, and create new future-focused degrees, is fast becoming an example of how to combine with an industry partner to achieve a goal of global importance.\n\nSadiq Khan\n\nMayor of London\n\nVision 2028 Progress & impact\n\nWe have made tremendous progress over the past four years on achieving the priorities outlined above through clear strategies and frameworks. While our success speaks volumes beyond numbers, our remarkable progress is unmistakably reflected in the statistics.\n\nRead our impact report.\n\n1\n\nThe 2023 Times Social Inclusion ranking placed UEL 1st in London for social inclusion and 12th nationally.\n\nC02\n\nUEL has reduced its CO2 emissions more than any other modern university in London.\n\n815\n\n£815m - UEL’s total annual impact on the UK economy.\n\nThe University of East London has been pioneering futures since 1898, from the 2nd Industrial Revolution through to where we are now, the 4th. We are a careers-led university. Our mission is to prepare you for the jobs of the future.\"\n\nProfessor Amanda J. Broderick\n\nVice-Chancellor & President\n\nWe believe that talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not\n\nOur commitment to inclusive education is more than just a corporate strapline. For over 125 years, diversity and inclusion have been central to our mission and more than a corporate strapline. We continue to work tirelessly to expand access to higher education with a focus on attracting students from Global Ethnic Majority (GEM) backgrounds, mature learners, and those from economically deprived households.\n\n1st\n\nUEL is ranked 1st in the UK for the number of care experienced undergraduate students.\n\n2.2\n\nUEL spent a total of £2.2million on undergraduate student bursaries in 2023.\n\n70%\n\n70% of UEL students identify as being from Global Ethnic Majority backgrounds.\n\nInclusive education\n\nThe Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) strategically implements equity initiatives throughout the University, focusing on areas like the Degree Awarding Gap. Currently at 8.8%, the gap between White and Black student degree outcomes has reached its lowest point in recent years, thanks to dedicated resources and expertise.\n\nRead more about The Office for Institutional Equity.\n\nUEL has academic partnerships with institutions in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, attracting 17,818 students to study as part of its transnational education programmes.\n\nOver half of UEL’s UK undergraduate students are the first in their family to attend university.\n\nAlmost half of UEL’s students are mature learners and 75% of UK students come from the most deprived 40% of English households.\n\nCareers first\n\nWe have been working hard on achieving our careers-first mission to prepare students for the challenges of a 5.0 economy, by forging innovative collaborations with industry to bridge skill and innovation gaps like never before.\n\nUEL works with over 2,500 active employer partners, an increase of more than 830% since 2018.\n\n85% of students reported that the skills and experience they developed through the Mental Wealth and Professional Fitness curriculum were useful to their future careers.\n\nIn the last three years, over 500 on-campus graduates have secured graduate employment with companies in the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers 2023.\n\nThe University has invested further in our local area and is playing a vital role in building up Newham for the future. Its new partnership with Newham Council on the Stratford Youth Zone, for example, seeks to unlock untapped potential in the wider area as a vibrant hub for creative arts and culture, driving arts sector innovation with the community voice at its heart.”\n\nThe Rt Hon Sir Stephen Timms MP for East Ham Chair of the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee.\n\nOur new brand\n\nAs part of our Vision 2028 strategic plan, we worked with staff, students, alumni, partners and other stakeholders to articulate who we are and what we have to offer. We worked with our stakeholders to come up with a new visual identity that reflects both our heritage and our relevance in the modern world.\n\nStrategic objectives\n\nFuture life\n\nMaximising mental wealth\n\nThe world of work is changing and so are our degrees.
