Title IX was part of a social and cultural revolution that allowed women to train as physicians and join the high-stakes professional world of surgery. This film documents the pervasive stereotypes and gender-based discrimination that persist within workplaces designed for, and still controlled by men. Within medicine and surgery, the failure to apply culture change has wide ranging impacts on the careers of women, the healthcare system, and the patient care experience.\n\nDirector Biography\n\nSarah is a first-time filmmaker. She was trained as a gynecologic oncologist and spent over 20 years providing surgical and medical care for women with cancer of the female genital tract. She is widely published in the medical literature and has contributed throughout her career to conversations about equity in healthcare, including gender equity within the physician workforce. She was inspired to make this film, informed by her lived experience, after leaving clinical practice in 2020.\n\nA Chocolate Lens (21 minutes)\n\nFilm by Gabriel Veras\n\nHow do you take a picture and tell the whole story?

As Mary faced isolation and debilitating treatment, Cig set out to bring the world to Mary. Over the coming years, Cig captured and sent Mary images of beauty, life and color. Images that evoked the sensual, the sacred, the delicate and the brave. Images exploding with color, piercing with light, evoking the pain and beauty of life, even as we face death.

One of them was film. “Filming Under Fire: John Ford’s OSS Field Photo Branch” tells the story of how Hollywood’s greatest director, John Ford, and many of its leading filmmakers contributed to America’s victory over Nazism and fascism in World War II through their service in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Field Photographic Branch. They conducted surveillance. They made training films. They shot combat. They created films to boost Americans’ morale and to demoralize the enemy. At the war’s conclusion, they gathered evidence that was instrumental in convicting the Nazi High Command at Nuremberg. This film is a tribute to their heroic efforts; to Hollywood’s contribution to America’s victory in World War II; and to the enduring power of film in the never-ending struggle for freedom and human dignity.\n\nProducer Biography\n\nCharles Pinck is president of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Society of Falls Church, VA, a nonprofit organization that celebrates the historic accomplishments of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the World War II forerunner to CIA and the U.S. Special Operations Command. In addition to \"Filming Under Fire: John Ford's OSS Field Photo Branch,\" he has produced three award-winning short documentaries for The OSS Society: “Operation Overlord: OSS and the Battle for France”; “Call Sign CHAOS: Gen. Jim Mattis and the U.S. Marine Corps”; and “The Tip of the Spear: From Virginia Hall to Gina Haspel.” He has led The OSS Society’s efforts to build the National Museum of Intelligence and Special Operations to honor Americans who have served at the “tip of the spear” as our Nation’s first line of defense since World War II, and to inspire future generations to serve.\n\nSpanish Joe Remembers (26 minutes)\n\nFilm by Samuel A. Miranda and Ellie Walton\n\nSpanish Joe Remembers is a documentary film that tells the story of Washington, D.C. bass player Pepe Gonzalez.
