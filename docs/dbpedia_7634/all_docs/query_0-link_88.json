        "text": "1st Logo (March 30, 2012-July 15, 2016)\n\nVisuals: Within a white bordered rectangular box against a black background, two hands open up a blue button up shirt to unveil the logo on the aforementioned background fill. The logo is shown to consist of a gradient and beveled \"V M\" stacked on top of one another. The logo zooms out and changes from a grainy version to a print form of itself alongside \"Victory Man Productions\" in white appearing underneath it.\n\nTechnique: Live-action and 2D computer animation.\n\nAudio: The opening theme of the film.\n\nAvailability: The logo is seen on Servitude and The Missing Ingredient: What Is the Recipe for Success?.\n\n2nd Logo (April 26, 2024)\n\nVisuals: On a black background with gray bokeh lights, two strokes draw in a thin, metallic white version of the letters from before from left to right and right to left respectively. The upper left and bottom right-most sections of the letters have a red and blue gradient. Before the formation of the letters are finished and during their zoom-out animation, a red-blue scrolling light flash appears below it to unveil \"VICTORY MAN\". As the background fades to black, the fill of the text changes to a blue-white gradient and the logo flattens with the form of its gradients waving along the way.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: The opening theme of the film."
