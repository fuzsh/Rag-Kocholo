The film was produced and distributed by Warner Brothers. It was the first film directed by Rapper. It is based on the 1940 play Jupiter Laughs by A. J. Cronin.[1] Bette Davis makes a brief cameo appearance as a nurse. The working title of the film was Winged Victory, but it was changed after it was discovered that Moss Hart was writing a play with this title. Hart's Winged Victory was filmed in 1944 by Twentieth Century Fox.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Paul Venner, a brilliant research psychiatrist, is driven from Budapest by his superior, who has published and taken credit for Paul's work. In London, an old friend, Dr. Drewett, introduces him to the head of a Scottish sanatorium who offers him the opportunity to continue his research on dementia praecox, a disease from which Paul's father suffered.\n\nDr. Mary Murray becomes his laboratory assistant. They fall in love, but she plans to engage in medical missionary work in China in a year's time. Paul convinces her to remain with him, and the two become engaged. A fire breaks out in the lab, and Mary dies saving Paul's irreplaceable records. Heartbroken, Paul declines posts at several prestigious universities in order to realize Mary's dream of helping the sick in war-torn China.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJames Stephenson as Dr. Paul Venner\n\nGeraldine Fitzgerald as Dr. Mary Murray\n\nDonald Crisp as Dr. Drewett\n\nBarbara O'Neil as Miss Leeming\n\nMontagu Love as Dr. Blake\n\nSig Ruman as Professor Herman Von Reiter\n\nGeorge Huntley, Jr. as Dr. Thornton\n\nRichard Ainley as Dr. Hale\n\nBruce Lester as Dr. Bentley\n\nLeonard Mudie as Mr. Foster\n\nDoris Lloyd as Mrs. Foster\n\nFrank Reicher as Dr. Esterhazy\n\nHermine Sterler as Miss Hoffman\n\nBilly Bevan as Chivers\n\nClare Verdera as Miss Dennis\n\nCrauford Kent as Dr. Corliss\n\nIan Wolfe as Mr. Carew, a Banker\n\nTempe Pigott as Miss Weatherby\n\nMary Taylor as Mrs. Kent\n\nBunny Beatty as Nancy Hormiston\n\nAlec Craig as Jeweller\n\nLouise Brien as Nurse\n\nHilda Plowright as Nurse\n\nOttola Nesmith as Nurse\n\nBette Davis as Nurse\n\nBarlowe Borland as Patient\n\nRudolph Anders as Police Officer\n\nWolfgang Zilzer as Subordinate\n\nClaire Du Brey as Matron\n\nPaul Panzer as Mailman\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of American films of 1941\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nGoble, Alan.
