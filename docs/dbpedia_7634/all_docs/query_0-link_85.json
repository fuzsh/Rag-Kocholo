        "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe all look for inspiration in different ways. Some people turn to religion; some turn to the self-help section of the App store. Some crank up their go-to motivational tunes (read: anything by Destiny's Child), while others queue up the next big podcast.\n\nAnd us? Well, a good ol' movie night always helps. Whether it's a biopic celebrating someone who turned the world upside-down for the better, a sports film with \"Eye of the Tiger\" on repeat, or a tale of overcoming adversity, certain movies simply have a knack for lifting us up and inspiring us to do more and be more.\n\nWho hasn't aspired to the wisdom of Atticus Finch, or the tenacity of Rocky Balboa? What movie-goer hasn't felt a spring in their step after watching the women of Hidden Figures rightfully get their due? Hell, even the Jamaican bobsled team can make a compelling case for the importance of chasing your dreams, no matter how far-fetched they may seem.\n\nLooking to shake yourself out of complacency and get a little fired up? These films should do the trick.\n\nADVERTISEMENT"
