I am really very proud. Recently I have received many invitations from various Predatory Publishers. They accept papers without any serious peer review and they ask more than 1500 EUR. For me, any Publisher that charges more than 1500 EUR is Predatory. I am proud for my Journal WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications. Most of the WSEAS Journals have no fees or have some small fee (300 EUR). Stay away from Predatory Publishers. Publish in WSEAS which is a genuine, honest, reputable Publisher.

There is no definition\n\nAnyway, leading scholars and publishers from ten countries have agreed a definition of predatory publishing that can protect scholarship.\n\nIt took 12 hours of discussion, 18 questions and 3 rounds to reach.(Agnes Grudniewicz, David Moher, Kelly D.

Graham, Matt Hodgkinson, Karim M. Khan, Mahlubi Mabizela, Andrea Manca, Katrin Milzow, Johann Mouton, Marvelous Muchenje, Tom Olijhoek, Alexander Ommaya, � Manoj M. Lalu )\n\nThe consensus definition of Predatory Journals accourding these Scholars and according WSEAS is: �Predatory journals and publishers are entities that prioritize self-interest at the expense of scholarship and are characterized by false or misleading information, deviation from best editorial and publication practices, a lack of transparency, and/or the use of aggressive and indiscriminate solicitation practices.�\n\nI think that our WSEAS Members, WSEAS Authors, WSEAS friends must be careful and must not fall fall into the trap of Predatory Journals\n\nElena Triantafyllou\n\nAnna Papadimitriou\n\nWSEAS\n\n\"WSEAS is a very good Publisher and it is our Good hope among the Ocean of Predatory Publishers that sent us Predatory Spam every day!I have excellent experience with WSEAS.

I thank the WSEAS reviewers (really international experts on their field of research) that WSEAS used for my papers. These reviewers' comments helped my team to improve my papers. It is usual the reviewers of WSEAS to send you 2-3 pages with comments commenting on your paper. Usually the WSEAS reviewers find in my papers various mistakes in Equations, various omissions in Figures and Tables and several corrections in English Language. All these years, I have published several papers in WSEAS and nobody has asked me to pay for anything. WSEAS is really the emerald of academic publishers.

WSEAS Authors sent us complaints that they receive spam from these hackers. So, it has come to our notice that some hackers and crooks use the name of one of our former clerks just to collect papers. They sent spam with the email: andrew.rosseli@jpmorgan.com\n\nSeveral WSEAS authors sent us complaints that they received spam from some crooks/hackers with email address andrew.rosseli@jpmorgan.com\n\nThis email address and the domain that they used had never had any relation with WSEAS. We will examine in this study what's happened. Also the same email address andrew.rosseli@jpmorgan.com sent email to us for some \"WSEAS Conference\" in Nigeria. However WSEAS has never organized any conference in Nigeria.\n\nKey-Words: - Predatory Publishers, Predatory Practices, Predatory Journals, Predatory Academicians, Predatory Techniques, Predatory Magazines, Predatory Conferences, Hackers, Hacking, WSEAS, WSEAS Journal, WSEAS Conferences, WSEAS Seminars, Andrew Roselli\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn our WSEAS organization, it has come to our notice that some hackers used on the Internet the name of one of our former clerks just to collect papers from innocent and unsuspecting authors. These hackers used the email address : andrew.rosseli@jpmorgan.com that does not belong to WSEAS. This email address is not @wseas.com or @wseas.org\n\nWe decided to publish our concerns to some other journal outside the WSEAS. On the other hand the WSEAS had never sent any email using fake email addresses. Nobody from WSEAS (Editors-in-Chief, Co-Editors, Reviewers, Authors etc) has any relation with these fake and counterfeit emails. WSEAS has no relation actually with these predatory hackers. In fact, the falsified name of our clerk who does not work in WSEAS after January of 2022 was used by hackers in a poor attempt to grasp some scientific papers from innocent and unsuspecting authors.\n\nWSEAS and the Editors-in-Chief, Co-Editors, Reviewers, Authors etc have no connection with platforms of J.P.Morgan @jpmorgan.com and hackers and we do not use any email like andrew.rosseli@jpmorgan.com\n\nWSEAS does not use J.P.Morgan emails to collect papers! That would not be possible for us to hand out the email addresses to people that we don't know and we don't trust. It would be a foolish action. On the other hand the predatory journals are not inviting author to publish their manuscripts free of charge!\n\nIn these falsified, fake and bogus emails it is supposed that WSEAS used other domains to collect articles! This is not possible and never will happen!\n\nWSEAS has never sent emails using other domains articles, except those of wseas.com or wseas.org and some of our conferences like cscc.co and mcsc-conf.org. In any event, the reported clerk in these emails is not an employee of WSEAS in 2022.\n\nAuthor testimonials. Over than 100000 Reviews from 2011 to 2022.

Recently I have received many invitations from Predatory Publishers. They accept papers without any serious peer review and they ask more than 1500 EUR. For me, any Publisher that charges more than 1500 EUR is Predatory. I am proud for my Journal WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications. Most of the WSEAS Journals have no fees or have some small fee (300 EUR)\n\nProf. Klimis Ntalianis\n\nUniversity of West Attica,\n\nEgaleo, Athens, Greece\n\nE-mail: kntal@image.ntua.gr, Kntal@uniwa.gr\n\nand\n\nDear WSEAS,\n\nOver the last 15 years I have been with WSEAS, as scientific paper author,\n\nreviewer and Editor-in-Chief of WSEAS Transactions on Power Systems.

In WSEAS Journals, Peer review of the paper is carried out by experts in the discipline on which the paper is based. Reading a paper with a critical and analytical mind means that these comments must be logical, coherent, and focused.\n\nIn WSEAS Journals, the review can make a dramatic change in scientific work and serves to highlight valuable material for researchers and subsequently facilitate its publication.\n\nThe development of the research structure and the valorization of knowledge is a challenge for doctors in all fields.\n\nDear researchers, valorization is a secret of development.\n\nAs experts, we still have a chance to leave our mark in the world of science: \"The real investment in the world is not the one where we earn money; scientific research is an investment in the future\". So, We thank the editor-in-chief and Assistant Editor of WSEAS journal and we thank Reviewers who review interesting papers in various fields.\n\nMany Thanks.\n\nRegards.\n\nAsmae ZBIRI, Doctor in Ecology and Environment, Mohammed V University Rabat - Morocco.\n\nEmail: asmaegedd@gmail.com.\n\nAzeddine HACHMI, Doctor in Plant Ecology, Mohammed V University Rabat - Morocco.\n\nEmail: hachmi.azd@gmail.com.\n\nGood Morning\n\nHope this mail finds you well\n\nThis is to inform you that Yesterday our manuscript has appeared on the Scopus database.

I do respect your professional work, transparency, integrity, high quality strict peer review by 3-5 reviewersand honesty with the authors.

I have published some papers in WSEAS Transactions, while several of my papers submitted in WSEAS have been rejected. Recently, I organized a special Issue with 5 papers in WSEAS Transactions on Environment and Development. I received 5 papers and I forwarded them to WSEAS. Only one paper was accepted in WSEAS Transactions on Environment and Development, the other 4 were rejected. So, the statistics on their web site are absolutely true. For several years now, for every paper submitted in WSEAS journals and WSEAS Transactions, I received rigorous peer review line by line on all of my papers. I thank the WSEAS reviewers (really international experts on their field of research) that WSEAS used for my papers. These reviewers' comments helped my team to improve my papers. It is usual the reviewers of WSEAS to send you 2-3 pages with comments commenting on your paper. Usually the WSEAS reviewers find in my papers various mistakes in Equations, various omissions in Figures and Tables and several corrections in English Language. All these years, I have published several papers in WSEAS and nobody has asked me to pay for anything. WSEAS is really the emerald of academic publishers. Do not publish in various dubious, fake, predatory publishers (outside WSEAS). Publish in WSEAS conferences, WSEAS books and WSEAS journals.\"\n\nProf. Badea Lepadatescu,\n\nTransylvania University of Brasov,\n\nBrasov, Romania\n\nE-mail:lepadatescu@unitbv.ro\n\n\"The new year is coming, and I wish you a happy new year! For the last several years, I have published some papers in WSEAS journals. Although some of my papers submitted in WSEAS have been rejected, I am really grateful to the reviewers, because the reviewers' comments helped us very very much to improve our papers. For every paper submitted in WSEAS journals and WSEAS Transactions, I received serious, detailed and rigorous peer review. WSEAS is really a very nice academic publisher, which is really much better than many predatory publishers. I wonder why the ISI Web of Knowledge has not been indexed the WSEAS Transactions yet. Thanks! And happy new year!\"\n\nProf. Xiaodong Zhuang,\n\nElectronics & Information College,\n\nQingdao University\n\nQingdao, China\n\nE-mail:xdzhuang@qdu.edu.cn\n\n\"I have sent some papers to WSEAS recently. WSEAS is a real, genuine, publisher and it does not have any relation with dubious publishers with fake review. I work in the University Space in the last 25 years and I certify to everybody that the WSEAS does not have any relation with the so-called predatory publishers and has neven been involved in Predatory Publishing practices. I have never sent papers to Predatory Publishers and I have never been involved in predatory publishing techniques When I receive an email from a Predatory Publisher I inform the Authority against Cyber Crime and other Predatory Practices in my country https://cyberalert.gr/contact/ and I learn very soon who is the owner of the predatory email! I am proud that my papers have been published in WSEAS which WSEAS does not have any relation with Predatory Publishers\n\nBest Regards and stay away from predatory publishers\n\nMarios Poulos\n\nIonio University\n\nCorfu, Greece\n\n4 WSEAS Reviewers\n\nTaking this opportunity, we would like to let you know that more than 14,000 reviewers have evaluated WSEAS articles the past 10 years. Their names and email addresses are available at our website www.wseas.com. Moreover, every author that publishes with us is obliged to sign a certification where is mentioned that i) at least three or more reviewers responded with comments and that certifies the peer-review process ii) no references where added by the reviewers or WSEAS and iii) the article has passed the Turnitin check.\n\nMoreover to inform you that the rejection rate is very high with 1/5 articles being accepted and all the Editors-in-Chief have signed a certificate where they certify the rejection rate.\n\nSo, it would be totally unfair to think that our journals are Predatory\n\nWhat do the Editors-in-Chief say about the review process in our Journals:\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-1.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-2.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-3.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-4.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-5.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-6.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-7.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-8.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-9.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-10.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-11.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-12.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-13.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-14.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-15.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-16.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-17.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-18.pdf\n\nhttp://wseas.com/documents/Statement-of-Peer-Review-signed-by-the-editor-in-chief-19.pdf\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nWSEAS Authors sent us from time to time complaints that they receive spam from Predatory Publishers. It has come to our notice that some hackers and crooks used the name of one of our former clerks just to collect papers from authors. Also, they sent us complaints that they received spam from a hacker with an email address andrew.rosseli@jpmorgan.com.
