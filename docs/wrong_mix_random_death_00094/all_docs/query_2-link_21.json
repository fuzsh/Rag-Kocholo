        "text": "Comment\n\nI wanted to take a few minutes to respond to your letter. Working with the Bentham Science Editorial team has been a very rewarding experience for me. I find the staff highly trained, organized and professional. This experience has made it a pleasure to publish with Bentham Sciences because the support is so helpful. Staff have been encouraging, patient and very detail oriented while helping me to fine-tune my manuscript(s) into their final format ready for public viewing. Publishing is a challenge for me due to time constraints and a full-time teaching assignment but working with the Bentham Science group has been a pleasure.\n\nKimberly A. Stieglitz\n\nSTEM Biotechnology Division, Roxbury Community College, Roxbury, MA\n\nUnited States\n\nComment\n\nThank you for contacting me. In regards to feedback on my experience working with this publisher, my only complaint is that the peer review process seemed to take longer than expected (about 2 months), and I received comments from 4 reviewers rather than the usual 2. Because each reviewer had several requests/questions, it took me a significant amount of time to make edits to the manuscript prior to re-submission.

They kept us up-to-date and informed about the status of our manuscript. The peer review process was performed very efficiently and effectively. The reviewers did an excellent job of identifying gaps and asking relevant questions that improved the quality of the manuscript. We were very pleased with the quality of the reviews and the assistance of the reviewers. The journal has published overall good/high quality papers and is becoming recognized as an impactful resource for scientific thought and outcomes. Based on our experience as contributors to the journal and the quality of papers published in the journal, I would recommend to my colleagues that they strongly consider the journal for their future publications.\n\nMilton Sommerfeld\n\nArizona Center for Algae Technology and Innovation,\n\nArizona State University, Mesa, AZ, 85212\n\nComment\n\nI am very pleased with the quality of service that I received from every part of Bentham Science, including your journal, Current Drug Discovery Technologies. First, let me thank you and the editor for inviting me to submit a review article. The 2nd edition was written as a text for the first semester of the two semester course in medicinal chemistry that is taught in pharmacy schools around the world. Bentham Science is doing a great job of helping my books reach the market.\n\nAt the same time, the article I wrote for Current Drug Discovery Technologies gave me an opportunity to reach a broader audience than the one that I reach in my research on food and natural products chemistry at the FDA. It also gave me the opportunity to review the very important subject of allo-network drugs, which has emerged recently and is described in more detail in the 3rd edition. The review process was fast and efficient. It caught the mistakes that I made and recommended several important improvements. The final proofs look excellent.\n\nThe other thing that Bentham Science has done for me is to greatly increase my scientific reputation, which has led to several other publishers inviting me to write review articles for them. In conclusion, Bentham Science continues to support my career and I hope that you have found me to be a valuable contributor.\n\nRobert E. Smith\n\nU.S. FDA, 11510 W 80th St., Lenexa, KS 66214\n\nUSA\n\nComment\n\n\"I found the editorial staff of Current Biotechnology friendly and helpful. I appreciate the interaction at the end when important decisions had to be made, and the editors were helpful and accommodating. The peer review process was at a very acceptable rate. Most of the reviewers suggestions helped to improve the quality of our manuscript. I think there is a lot of scope as the area is rapidly growing and it will be a very important journal in the field. I will certainly look into publishing with you again.\"\n\nAbigail Elizur\n\nQueensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, Bribie Island Research Centre, Queensland\n\nAustralia\n\nComment\n\nI have a very good experience working with the Bentham Science Publishers through my long-term relationship with one of the imaging journals, Current Medical Imaging (CMIM, previously named Current Medical Imaging Reviews). Previously I served as an editorial board member of CMIR, then was promoted to section editor, then to Co-editor in CMIM in 2020. I have published in many imaging and medical journals, thus having experience with different publishers such as Springer, Elsevier, AME Publishing Company, and Wiley, etc. My experience with Bentham Science Publishers is generally positive due to its excellent service, taking care of the author’s request, and the high quality of published articles. My only comment on future improvement is to shorten response time as I realized that it takes a few days (sometimes even longer) to respond to my query, such as after checking the first round of galley proof, I have to wait for another week or even longer to receive the corrected proof. This is rarely encountered with other publishers. Fast turnaround time is very important for authors nowadays as we would like to speed up our publications including citations of articles that are online.\n\nZhonghua Sun\n\nDepartment of Medical Radiation Sciences Curtin University, Perth,\n\nAustralia\n\nComment\n\nThis was my first submission to Current Biotechnology so, understandably, I was a bit apprehensive to try a new publisher. However, I was very pleased with the process and particularly the very kind and helpful interactions I had with the EiC and all of the members of the CBIOT team. The peer review process was thorough but also timely and the reviews improved the quality of the final manuscript. It is a great honour for me to have one of my papers published in this journal and I will certainly be submitting future manuscripts.\n\nComment\n\nI would like to congratulate you on the great work on our paper in Current Nanoscience.\n\nAll the people in Bentham Science have been very helpful, prompt when I needed assistance and have exhibited a high level of professionalism.\n\nIt is very likely that I will consider your journal for the submission of papers in the future and I will recommend it to my colleagues.\n\nAngelos P. Markopoulos\n\nSection of Manufacturing Technology, School of Mechanical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens\n\nGreece\n\nComment\n\nMy experience of working with Bentham Science Publication Current Computer-Aided Drug Design has been excellent.

Both the EiC as well as the editorial staff responded directly to our questions and helped us a lot. The peer review process was rapid and efficient. The suggestions and remarks of the reviewers and the editorial staff helped us a lot to improve the manuscript. The journal is relatively new, and has to compete with a large number of online journals in the same field, but the dedication of the EiC and editorial staff, as well as the efficient reviewing and publishing process, will eventually make the difference. CBIOT has the potential to find a stable position (niche') within the number of high quality journals publishing articles in the field of biotechnology.\n\nGerard Muyzer\n\nDepartment of Aquatic Microbiology, Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystems Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nComment\n\nThe communication and information supply by the editorial staff and EiC was open, friendly, to the point, and fast. Also their help in getting the required adjustments to the figures done in an efficient way was very much appreciated. The peer review process was fast for the first review, but the response on my resubmission took longer. The reviewers suggestions were helpful in improving the manuscript. The overall quality and authority of the journal is good; good scientific papers in diverse fields of Biotechnology; the special issues with themes of current interest are also adding to the quality of the journal, and a reason to recommend it to colleagues.\n\nMargot E.F.

The reviewers and the editors, especially the editor in chief Prof. Mikhailidis, have been extremely helpful with their constructive comments, which have improved our paper considerably. Also, the author guidelines found on your website are very clear and easy to follow. The main reason why I chose your journal is that it is indexed in pubmed and medline, as well as in many other important databases. The only one missing, which could add real value to your journal, is science direct (http://www.sciencedirect.com); so this is the only thing that could be improved. Other than that, everything was perfect.\n\nNikolaos Louvis\n\nClinical Pharmacologist, Community Pharmacist; Department of Pharmacology, Therapeutics & Toxicology, Cardiff University\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nComment\n\nit has been a real pleasure to have worked with BSP.

The peer review process was fast initially and moderate further. It also might be because we specially faced a problem regarding the late review response in a case. Anyway, we queried to the editorial team and received quick response, that the required last reviewer comments were not received yet then. The reviewers suggestions were very helpful. We are deeply indebted to all the respected anonymous reviewers. The overall quality and authority of the journal was very satisfying. We will surely recommend the journal to our colleagues as a source of high quality papers\n\nSujay Ray\n\nUniversity of Kalyani\n\nIndia\n\nArundhati Banerjee\n\nNational Institute of Technology\n\nIndia\n\nComment\n\nI wish to give a few words of appreciation related to the sincere and kind service provided by the Editorial Team of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, BSP at this moment of getting published three scientific research papers of our Institution.\n\nSince the start, the communication has been prompt, clear and cordial.
