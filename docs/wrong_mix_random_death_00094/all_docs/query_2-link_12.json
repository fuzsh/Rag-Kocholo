        "text": "Corine Tachtiris interviews Alice Guthrie, winner of the 8th Annual Jules Chametzky Prize for Translation for her translation of Atef Abu Saif's \"The Lottery\".\n\nCorine Tachtiris: I thought we could start by talking about “The Lottery.” One of the things I noticed is that there’s a balance between this really intimate voice, where you feel like you’re part of a community, and these larger political forces that are outside of people’s control. So I wanted to ask you about creating that balance in the translation.\n\nAlice Guthrie: Yes, that was something that I really liked and like still about the story. I mean, without being faux humble, I don’t feel that’s so much in my job as translator as in [Atef Abu Saif’s] job as writer. I guess it does come into the way I tried to use, hopefully, very realistic language in the spoken dialogue, but that’s always a key attempt of mine. I feel like what you said is a really good description of what is so great about the story itself.\n\nCT: And did you find that readers who aren’t familiar with the environment in which the story is happening would have enough context to understand it? Did you feel like you maybe wanted to insert some glosses? The life of these people in this refugee camp may be unfamiliar to people, especially because I think it doesn’t seem to be what people usually imagine a refugee camp is like—there are cars and crowds and homes.\n\nAG: Absolutely. With regards to people having that stereotype, obviously part of the Palestinian tragedy and the crime that’s being committed against Palestinians is that these refugee camps have become very established. And so what started off as tents have become concrete buildings and so on, so that you’ve got multigenerational [families], people born into the refugee camp and everything. So that’s a specific Palestinian thing, but it’s also sadly increasingly relevant in the wider world as we see the criminalization of the displaced. So there’s an entrenching of displacement as part of the new normal in our late-stage capitalist (or whatever you want to call it) moment. So that has a specific and a universal relevance or value in terms of making people re-examine what they might think of when they think refugee camp, because there’s so many versions of the refugee experience.\n\nIn terms of the beginning of your question, I think something that I really like about this story is the way that Abu Saif strikes this very masterful balance between really painting the picture of where they are—without overdoing it, without explaining every little thing. And I think that that’s really hard to get right. You know, I think I often get annoyed with writers who aren’t giving us enough information about what’s going on in the background, about what the situation is, about where these people are, who assume that the reader is inside their mind or something. But it would also bother me if it were being overdone. For my taste, [Abu Saif] gets a really nice balance there. So when he feeds in little bits like right at the end when he talks about the refuse truck coming, it’s not contrived. It somehow feels natural and really effective, which I really like. And similarly, to go back to your first question, for me, the political stuff that he brings in is not contrived. It doesn’t feel like he had a political idea and just wanted to write the story around it. And this is something that I would say about him in general, what I really like about his work, is that he’s really political, but he is genuinely a really skilled fiction writer as well.\n\nCT: The numbers of translations being published in the UK, at least, are going up. Do you see that also applying to literature translated from Arabic?\n\nAG: Yeah, I do. I’m suppose I’m still aware that we’re a tiny niche within a tiny niche. Translated literature in general is really tiny, and then Arabic is tiny within that, and so what’s also really problematic is the temptation to use literature as a kind of sociological document, and have this reductive gaze. So people ask me things like, “What do Arabic women think about...?” You know any question that begins with that is obviously really problematic. The way that can translate, no pun intended, into choices, you can suddenly get attention for the wrong reasons, and especially around women. But there are lots of people who are doing a lot to try and make that not be the case, and to problematize and diversify the offer. But I guess I still feel like there’s a lot to be done about who’s translating and how, and whether and how it’s being edited, and the whole scene of how stuff’s being assessed and awarded. There are difficulties within all of those, despite the fact that there’s some great stuff happening, too.\n\nCT: That ties into the work that you’re doing with the Shubbak Festival, which also seems to be about advocating for a diversity of voices, about bringing literature from Arabic to a wider public. Could you talk about the work you do there and also how you choose which authors to bring?\n\nAG: Yeah, it’s really exciting being able to do that. What’s also kind of terrifying about it is that, as you can imagine, you have such a long list, and then you shorten it down, and then you have to narrow it down even more, and then people are like, “How come you didn’t include so-and-so?” And we have certain pressures, we have to raise the funds for things. Our program is definitely not dictated by the funders, but that’s in the mix. But within that, it’s really exciting to be able to program people.\n\nOne of the things that I’m most excited about in my current work is—I identify as queer—that I’m increasingly able to focus, not exclusively but as much as I can, on queer writing and queer writers in my translating and also programming and curational practice. And in the last edition of Shubbak, in 2017, for the first time we did a panel of queer writers, and that was an incredible process behind the scenes, finding who was willing to appear under that banner and making sure that everybody felt good about it. And it was a real roaring success. As a result of that we’re making that a regular event within the literary strand, which is what I program at the Festival. That has been so incredibly moving and exciting to be able to program queer content from a region in which it is so difficult to make queer art, or have a queer identity, or live a queer life.\n\nAnd so, that’s incredibly moving, and it intersects with another project that I’ve got going on, which is putting together an anthology of queer Arabic writing in collaboration with a publisher from Cairo. So that will be an Arabic edition and an English edition in parallel, and that just feels like really important work. What’s really, really nice about Shubbak is when my wider existence as a writer, translator, editor, can feed into that and vice versa. Not that it’s exclusively down to me to choose who goes in or not, because we’ve got other people in the team, but I’m leading on that and so it feels, in a small, humble way, like a really lovely thing to be able to do, to hold a space for those kind of works, as well as plenty of other people who don’t identify as queer or aren’t doing queer work, of course.\n\nCT: Also in regards to bringing in a diverse range of voices, I noticed that one of your interests is in the vernacular. So I wondered, as you’re translating texts from Syria, Palestine, Jordan, and other places, how much of the vernacular is reflected in the literature and how much is modern standard Arabic that doesn’t allow for as much diversity in what things end up sounding like in translation? Do you get to play with vernacular and how to bring that over?\n\nAG: It’s super interesting because even if a writer is writing completely in fuṣḥá, which is modern standard Arabic, including all of the dialogue, you’re still going to have to make it sound like convincing vernacular. So that’s really hard for us to wrap our heads around: the fact that they have characters speaking to each in other in what you could say sounds very formal, like Latin or high German or something, but you still have to translate that as, “Alright, how’s it going?” or whatever. It would be a mistranslation to be rendering it very formally. So there’s already that to deal with.\n\nWhen writers are using dialect in writing, it’s very exciting. I was always really keen to make sure that I learnt dialect. So I speak Syrian dialect, which is very similar to Lebanese and Palestinian. And I love the fact that when I’m in Morocco, people say, “Ah, did you learn in Syria?” They can hear it. It’s an amazing thing. So when I work on Syrian texts with Syrian dialect, it’s very satisfying to be hearing that in the way that you would in a conversation with a Syrian person, and rendering it in the way that you would talk in English. But of course, it can be really problematic when translators work on dialects that they don’t speak themselves. There is a lot that can go wrong. I’m currently learning vernacular Moroccan, but I would not at the moment take on translating something that was written in Moroccan Darija dialect because I would miss loads of stuff.\n\nCT: I also translate Caribbean texts, where it’s something different from French from France, and when bringing that over into English, some people put that into an African American dialect, but African American dialect isn’t the same as a Caribbean dialect. So how do you choose what English to bring a dialect into?\n\nAG: I know, that whole thing is fraught with imperfection. I remember this being mind-blowing when I first started translating. One of the early things I did was another Palestinian writer, and it had loads of strong dialect all the way through it. And [I just got] in a complete tangle with the editor of that project. We’re from different parts of the country, and we totally disagreed on how things sounded, just within British vernacular—we had totally different associations for slang terms.\n\nSo I totally agree, I think it’s super confusing and inappropriate for something to be culturally transplanted so that you get a Gazan sounding like somebody from Washington Heights or whatever it would be, somebody sounding like a really specific thing. That’s just mad to me, that’s really inappropriate. Like, I would be interested to see maybe a drama production of a play from Gaza that was put into really strong Glaswegian or something, but that’s not something that I would want to read as a translation, that would be a different project.\n\nSo there’s something about finding that middle ground, where it’s completely contradictory, isn’t it, because what you’re looking for is a universal slang, and there’s no such thing. You’re looking for a slang that is bland enough and generic enough that it’s just going to kind of be in the background so that there’s a sort of suspension of disbelief that we’re reading a text in English and this is how they talk. And as soon as you do anything that’s too extravagant, or too formal, too exaggerated, too clunky, whatever it is, then you’re going to break the spell. The reader’s going to be like, “hang on a minute, this is in Gaza, right? why are they saying ‘dude’?” or whatever. So I think that is such a difficult tightrope walk act. It’s an incredible thing to even attempt, isn’t it really? It’s amazing that so many of us throw ourselves into it for some reason. It’s not like it pays well.\n\nCT: How do you balance those loyalties to the text and its cultural contexts, and your loyalties also to the reader, and their expectations, their aesthetic expectations, their cultural expectations, how they enjoy literature? You have that balance of trying to respect one thing and also respect the reader and also give them a text that they want to read because if it goes too much against their expectations they might not even read it.\n\nAG: In a way, I think that’s kind of a road to madness because the idea of trying to guess, even the idea that there is a reader who is going to think this or that is, if you think about it, a kind of a road to madness because we know that we’re all idiosyncratic individual readers with our own tastes. I mean I know obviously there are bestselling works and there are trends in publishing. I guess it really depends a lot on the writer. When I was reading back through the story just now, I was thinking, yeah, Atef does a lot of really neat stuff. Like, I wouldn’t say it was easy to translate, and there was quite a long editorial process, but it also was able to stay pretty closely cleaving to the original, obviously as it should. But with some writers, there’d be really quite a lot of things that don’t really work that you have to unpick, you go back to the writer, and you go, “hmm, your metaphor changed halfway through, did you notice?” [Atef] has really got it under control.\n\nAnd about Atef: The latest is that he seems to be on the firm road to recovery, which is great news. He’s still in hospital, but he’s progressing. A terrible trauma happened to him, and it’s very upsetting that it happened to him, but thank God it seems like he’s escaped more serious consequences since initially he was unconscious. One thing that I did want to say is that it was really poignant timing because I literally found out about the prize and emailed him just a few days before the attack. I emailed to tell him congratulations, and to say they really praised your story, it’s not just my translation, and kind of said, we haven’t been in touch for a while, [but] I always love working on your stuff. A while ago we’d been in touch about me possibly translating his novel, and things kind of fell by the wayside. And it just seemed so poignant that I’d just written to tell him about this win and suddenly this news came. And I already knew that I really appreciated his work and really respected him and really liked him as a writer, but when something like this happens, when you think someone’s possibly about to die, it really kind of throws it into relief, doesn’t it? You realize just how important people are.\n\nA friend who used to be a journalist in Gaza said to me: the thing is in Gaza you can feel like anything could happen and the world wouldn’t react, like it’s a separate place. So hopefully once he gets stronger and he’s out of hospital this will be like a big greeting of solidarity to him. You can’t say the world is watching, but a lot of us, we see you.\n\nALICE GUTHRIE is a British translator, editor, journalist and event producer specializing in Arabic-English literary and media content.

I was delighted when I found out.\n\nMR: You certainly deserve it. The translation is beautiful. Would you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you became interested in translation? When did you begin translating poetry, and what drew you to it?\n\nIW: My parents were very strict about speaking Polish at home when I was growing up, so from a very young age I was existing in both languages: reading in both, writing in both, and thinking about both. I’ve always been interested in language and words, so working in two languages was fun for me and came pretty naturally. I didn’t actually start translating until I enrolled in the MFA program at Columbia University, which was just beginning its Literary Translation program. It gave me the opportunity to add a translation concentration to what I was already doing, creative nonfiction. I took great classes with great translators like Susan Bernofsky and Idra Novey, and began to workshop some translations. I started with prose but ultimately settled into poetry and began translating Anna Piwkowska in earnest.\n\nMR: How did the “settling into” poetry come about? Did you first decide that you wanted to translate poetry and then find a poet you were interested in, or was it the other way around?\n\nIW: Well. . . Anna Piwkowska is my aunt, so I was already very familiar with her poetry and with her. I’ve always really loved her poems, and I studied and wrote poetry a bit in college. Although I decided to pursue nonfiction in the MFA program, I thought I could keep a part of my writing self involved in poetry by translating it. Which isn’t to say that I couldn’t also have been writing my own poetry, but I haven’t.\n\nMR: I, myself, began translating as a way of keeping myself writing, and nowadays it has, happily, become all that I do.\n\nIW: It’s a nice break from writing my own things—still writing, but very differently.\n\nMR: To what extent do you collaborate with Anna Piwkowska herself? Does the fact that you are family affect the degree to which you collaborate? What do you do when you disagree?\n\nIW: Certainly it makes it very easy to ask her questions when they come up. I’ll email her about ambiguity or context, or we’ll talk about it when we are together, which has been very helpful. But we’ve never really sat down together to work on a poem, which is something I would actually really love to do and hope to still.\n\nI don’t think there have been any real disagreements about the translations. But she has discussed with me how important rhyme and rhythm are to many of her poems, and sometimes I feel a bit guilty that I can’t entirely recreate that in English.\n\nMR: What do you think is the most challenging aspect of translating a work of poetry? And more specifically, what are some of the challenges particular to translating from Polish into English?\n\nIW: I think balancing all the elements is very challenging. You have rhyme and rhythm on top of content and meaning, and inevitably something somewhere has to get sacrificed. For me, it’s an enjoyable puzzle, knowing that if I get rid of a rhyme here, I can perhaps make something else rhyme elsewhere. Or I can move a sentence around to get the rhythm right. It’s definitely challenging to connect all those moving parts, and some poems are easier to translate than others.\n\nPolish is a much more flexible language than English. It has a very complicated grammar, but as a result, the same sentence can be said in any number of ways, changing the order of the subject, object, or verb, and declining or conjugating appropriately. This makes it pretty easy to rhyme, for example, but the rigidity of our syntax thwarts doing something similar in English. Polish also has an enormous literary history, and though this may be unique to Piwkowska’s work, I read a lot of poems with allusions to Polish literature. This is challenging in translation because that context just doesn’t exist for an English readership.\n\nMR: How do you navigate that? Do you assume that your reader, if interested enough in the work, will seek to learn more and perhaps unearth some of the literary references that do not translate? Or do you ever add material or a paratext to the original? What techniques do you work with for dealing with such problems?\n\nIW: To be honest, so far I’ve avoided translating her most allusion-heavy poems. There’s one in particular that is sort of a collage of lines drawn from or alluding to old Polish literature. I’ve approached that one several times and haven’t been able to crack it yet—but soon, I hope! In any case, for the times I have run across this problem, I’ve generally not included any additional material or context, but I wouldn’t necessarily be opposed if I thought it was absolutely necessary to understanding the poem. It’s my hope, however, that the poem can stand alone and convey its meaning even if the reader might not be familiar with some of the allusions. A translated poem is inherently going to be a different poem for a reader in a different language, even without this sort of trickiness.\n\nMR: Concerning “A letter from Paul Éluard to his wife who is in Cadaqués with Salvador Dali,” are there any words, lines, or sections that exhibit the sorts of challenges you’re talking about? Are there pieces you would like to tinker with further? Are there moments where you wish you could whisper in the reader’s ear to help them grasp ambiguities that simply do not translate poetically?\n\nIW: You know, this one is a relatively unambiguous poem; it has these stunning images that come across just as effectively in both languages. It does lose a little bit of rhyme though, in translation. As for wanting to whisper in the reader’s ear: yes, all the time! I particularly felt this when I first started translating. I would workshop a poem and if I got positive feedback, my reaction would so often be, “Really? How can you like this when you don’t understand this line, or you’re missing this particular wordplay?”\n\nMR: Workshopping a translation is such a curious experience, and for just that reason. About process, then, how do you go about translating a poem? What variables speed up or slow down the process? Do you work on one poem at a time, or is your process oriented more toward an author’s body of work?\n\nIW: I’ll usually work on several poems at a time, but hone in on one when I feel it’s really beginning to take shape. I nearly always start with a pretty fast, literal translation with little regard to the poetics of the thing or even concern for whether the sentences fully make sense. Then I’ll go back and work on a sentence level to smooth them out, and then go back again and tinker with it on an individual word level. This is where a big Polish-English dictionary and a thesaurus come into play. I look up words in the dictionary even if they’re very familiar, easy words, just to get a sense of whether there are alternate definitions that could be useful, or if there’s something I might have missed.\n\nOnce I’m happy with that, I read the poem through several times, often out loud, to get a sense of how it sounds and how the rhythm can be adapted; whether to change words to get a better assonance if necessary; where to insert rhyme if I can. This takes place over a few weeks, because I find that stepping away from a poem and coming back to it afresh later helps with smoothing it out. I tend to get lost in the nitty-gritty of synonyms or vowels or syllables, and letting the poem breathe for a few days works wonders.\n\nWhat slows down the process is what we talked about earlier—the sort of allusions or wordplay that really need to be addressed in a certain way that’s not immediately obvious. Poems with a lot of nouns, lists of things, names of trees or animals, things like that tend to go faster because those are generally pretty unambiguous.\n\nMR: Have you ever gotten midway through your process with a given poem and decided that you cannot finish? That it simply won’t work?\n\nIW: I have quite a few half-finished poems saved in a Word document, and I revisit them occasionally. Once in a while, I’m able to salvage one or two, but often only after not working on them for months. It’s definitely frustrating, and I can’t even really pinpoint what it is about a particular poem that makes it so stubborn, but some just really do seem so untranslatable.\n\nMR: Is your personal writing process similar to your translation process?\n\nIW: My personal writing process is sort of similar: I definitely have the same habit in my own writing of going back to something that’s already written and giving it a very close read on a sentence and word level. I put a lot of stock in words and rhythm in my own prose, and translating poetry has really helped me develop a voice in prose. But I also pay a lot more attention to detail when I start a first draft of my own writing, so in that sense, the beginning of the process is different.\n\nMR: That brings us to a good note to end on. What current translation projects are you working on? What can we expect to see from you (and Anna) next?\n\nIW: Lots of writing and translating for the foreseeable future, which I’m very happy about. I am finishing a few remaining poems from a book of Anna’s called Farbiarka (The Dye Girl), which I hope to be able to publish. She published a new book of poems in Polish last year, which I immediately fell in love with, and I’ve started translating poems from that as well. So I hope there are a lot more poems to come!\n\nThe project I’m working on now is nonfiction rooted in a particular place in Poland that’s significant to my family— about a palace, aristocracy, art, war, and family—and getting fairly close to being able to shop that around. My aunt writes a lot of poems about this place too. So in that way my translation work and my own writing are very related; it’s interesting to me to see very specific things or experiences described in her poems that maybe I’ve also written about, but differently.\n\nMR: If the rest of Anna’s work is as striking as “A letter from Paul Éluard to his wife who is in Cadaqués with Salvador Dali” I’m sure you will have no trouble finding an eager publisher, Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us —it truly has been a pleasure.\n\nAn Interview with Paula Bohince, winner of the 7th Annual Jules Chametzky Prize for Translation\n\nKrzysztof Rowiński: First of all, congratulations on winning the Jules Chametzky Translation Prize! Thank you for taking the time to talk about your work. Could you start by telling me about how you came to translation? Was it something that was a result of your own writing, or was it more about the love for Italian language or literature?\n\nPB: I began in 2015, after my third book of poems was finished but before it was published—in that kind of blank space. That collection, Swallows and Waves, was based on Japanese Edo-period artworks, and I approached those poems as a kind of erasure of self—there is no “I” in the book—and I (as the poet) felt transformed by that process of disappearing into looking, into feeling diffuse, in feeling like a vessel for the poem to pass through. And so, when that years-long experience was finished, I was kind of dazed. I didn’t exactly know how to inhabit a poem again. So I began reading poems in translation. I’d already felt “elsewhere” and wanted to keep going. I think, though, that this seed was somehow planted decades ago when I first started writing, when I read Jane Kenyon’s translation of Anna Akhmatova and learned how she came to them, after Donald Hall suggested she find someone to translate as part of her own growth as a poet. I have always loved Jane’s poems and sensibility and these translations over the years. So, I think that thought was always rumbling around in my mind.\n\nKR: Could you elaborate on the relationship between translation and your own writing? Do you find that one helps the other—or does it stand in the way? How do you balance the two activities?\n\nPB: Well, I’m definitely a beginner translator, and it feels good to grow and learn and approach it as a new art form, one that is informed by my own practice, but really (as with my ekphrastic poems) a new way to situate my writing self differently within the process. As with those artworks, translation provides a kind of companionship. I like the conversation I feel I’m having with another voice, another vision, across time and language and geography and mortality. It’s incredibly interesting to me to see all of the choices that are available in translation and to be truly thoughtful about word choice, line break, the tension of meaning against music, and to feel comfortable with a perhaps necessary “gap” between the original and the translation, and even find that space to be poignant.\n\nI already enjoy revision as an extension of the creative process, and the challenges of translation—the puzzling and striving and pleasurable anxiety—just lights up all of these areas. As for the balance between my own work and translation, I go back and forth over periods of months. That creates a nice bulk of time for concentration, and then one well is exhausted and the other gets filled.\n\nKR: I’m interested in the behind-the-scenes of this particular translation. How did you approach it, and what were some of your strategies? Did you read aloud, for instance, to focus on the original’s rather characteristic rhythm?\n\nPB: I had to approach it rather slowly, assembling a rough working draft, and then adding lots of offshoot notes, going forward (and back) between versions, refining images, trying to balance my vision against his intention. I read the original aloud and then the translation at various stages as a mode of revision. Something that I struggled with in the beginning was understanding that Govoni’s rhythmic play and end rhymes were just not going to be recreated in my translation. There’s the emotion of the poem beneath the mechanics of its form, and it’s that undersong I wanted utterly at the fore of my translation. At times, in my own work and in the work of other poets (in English), a driving rhythm can be kind of distancing. Loosening that knot can allow for a reader to participate more fully in the poem and not merely observe it enacted. As if I’m watching the plates spin and can’t feel close to what is being said. When it came down to it, I wanted the poem to feel surprising, almost spontaneous, clear, with its emotional core—that delicateness—intact.\n\nKR: Tell me more about your discovery of Corrado Govoni. You said you feel kinship with Govoni—what kind of resonances did you find while reading his poems? How do you think his poetry resounds today?\n\nPB: I discovered Govoni through Geoffrey Brock’s terrific FSG Anthology of Twentieth-Century Italian Poetry. I was immediately drawn to his images, to the freshness and almost naiveté there, in the way that Elizabeth Bishop or Sylvia Plath can appear naïve (appear being key). I saw shades of James Wright and other Deep Imagists. There was the childlike wonder that I love in Stevie Smith, a kind of seeing-the-world-for-the-first-time quality, of true strangeness. It felt restorative, non-cynical. The poems made me happy, and it made me happy to think that I could be of some use in bringing them to a wider audience. As I learned more about him—growing up in the country, struggling with depression—I thought, I know him. As for resonance, I think of the pleasure-principle first—they felt restorative to me. Maybe because they feel so timeless, so out of time, and with images at the fore, easy for an audience to connect with.\n\nKR: And how did you decide on this particular poem—was there a central image that made you decide to translate \"Il palazzo dell’anima\"?\n\nPB: The White City and its roaring bee—those images together took my breath away. The movement in size (huge to tiny), abstract to specific, silence to noise, cold to hot, grand to quotidian—it’s incredibly dynamic while appearing effortless. And have we not all experienced that “roaring bee” inside of us? That amplification shook me. The entire poem is telescopic (like Bishop), and I felt I was following Govoni’s poetic gaze, completely enraptured. The poem itself is like the burning river, with its turns and surprises. I love the brazen quietness of the last line. That direct address of “you,” the sound of “see the sea,” the looking outwards to the regular world. It’s a devastating downshift.\n\nKR: What are your next projects? Are you working on other poems by Govoni, or moving on to other authors?\n\nPB: I’m continuing to translate Govoni and work on my own poems. His poems have been such a gift in terms of renewing my energy and giving me an appreciation for slow, pleasurable work on the level of word and line. I love feeling outside of myself with translation and, in some way, of service. I'm trying to take that spirit alive in my larger life. As far as my own poems go, I’ve recently finished a manuscript, so I’m just letting that rest for a while in order to see it with new eyes in a few months.\n\nPAULA BOHINCE'S most recent poetry col­lection is Swallows and Waves, published by Sarabande in 2016.\n\nKRZYSTOF ROWIŃSKI is a PhD candidate in Comparative Literature at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He is working on a dissertation titled “Never-lasting Effects: Failure in Twentieth-Century American, Italian, and Polish Literature, Film, and Performance,” a study of non-redemptive yet generative failure in the works of John Williams, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Bruno Jasieński. His chapter on Pasolini’s early films in Pasolini Framed and Unframed is forthcoming with Bloomsbury.\n\nAlternative Realities\n\n(Read Part One and Two here.)\n\nJH: One of the things we’ve done in the Massachusetts Review blog—because we thought we needed to—is book reviews of other work that pretends to come out this period and this history. In particular, two novels were very successful in the US: Téa Obreht’s The Tiger’s Wife and Sara Nović’s Girl at War. About the reviews we did, well, I’ll give you just the title of the one for The Tiger’s Wife: “Balkan Zoology.”\n\nSo that’s what I wanted to ask you two about. Ever since Robert Kaplan, and his horrendous book Balkan Ghosts, one of the main ways of representing the history of the ‘90s and the wars of the former Yugoslavia takes an exotic, primitive look from the outside. With the so-called West looking on, as if it’s civilized, at these strange animals doing subhuman things to each other. So, in light of that sort of history, when you do any kind of work that represents this period—and in this case you’re creating a new form of story for a story that came from that history—how do you avoid this kind of reception?\n\nAB: We thought about that. We talked about it. And our decision was to situate the story in different periods of the city.\n\nEČ: Different moments of its history. You have the Austro-Hungarian time, you have the socialist period, World War Two, and the overall look of the city—that could be Vienna, or any Austrian city.\n\nAB: What we’re trying to say is that, we wanted to get past the idea that we’re just tribes, bloodthirsty tribes, always at each other’s throats. And maybe the easiest way to bridge that gap, without being too explicit about it, is to simply show that, “No, this is what this place looks like.”\n\nJH: In that other form of representation, the idea is that other parts of the world are a Gothic horror show. And as long as you’re a safe viewer in a safe seat in the theater, it’s kind of fun. One way of responding to this distortion is to remember that what you’re watching is most of human history. If you think it’s confined to these years and this place, well, then it’s time for you to go back to the classroom and study a bit more.\n\nLet me push farther, though, because we haven’t talked too much about the content of this story. We’ve mentioned that it’s about Tesla, and we’ve mentioned that it does different things in different places. But it’s also a detective story, or a thriller, and it involves Tesla’s experiments with a death ray, with harnessing something more powerful than nuclear weapons. And the story suggests that somehow the secret is still out there. Almost like an X-Files story. So it’s also true that that your genre is not that far away from the fairy-tale version of history that Téa Obreht uses, or the Hunger Games tale that Sara Nović imposes on history.\n\nOn the other hand, this was a tale that Karim Zaimović was telling at the time, in this place. But it still has this supernatural, fantasy content.\n\nEČ: I think you could connect it to this place and that time, because everything is what we wrote, or talked about, everything is connected to this city, to Sarajevo, its center, its living past.\n\nAB: There are all sorts of alternate realities. War makes a place into an alternate reality.\n\nJH: When I was teaching here, I remember telling my students, as they were reading Thoreau, that they probably knew twenty-five or thirty Thoreaus. People who were taking notes about this strange separation from the rest of the world and the rest of history.\n\nAB: So it’s no wonder that’s what appears in Karim’s stories. But if we want to talk specifically about this particular story, well, when you’re constantly being shelled, you might think that the very last thing you’d think about is this sort of ultimate weapon. It’s kind of absurd.\n\nNow I don’t know if there’s a connection, but at that time Karadžić was talking about this vacuum bomb he was going to buy from the Russians. And this was widely publicized; it was quite well known. And he was going to use it on Sarajevo. To suck all the air out of the city, so people would suffocate.\n\nJH: Yet part of the feel of this story, and part of the content as well, is a conspiracy theory: that “There’s somebody out there, and they’re controlling everything, and if you can just find them, and trace them. . .”\n\nAB: Well, ask any person in Sarajevo what they would do if they had a time machine. I think there’s a list of people that they would go back and kill. It’s not like we would go back to the French Revolution to see it first hand, or go hang out with the Beatles.\n\nJH: Or go to meet Columbus and tell him not to get on that damned boat. . .\n\nAB: And I think conspiracy theory is interesting in the same sense. When war happens, and you want to get to the why. . .\n\nJH: Everybody is telling all kinds of stories, trying to make sense of what can’t be made sense of, and a lot of it sounds pretty crazy. And then some of what sounds pretty crazy. . .\n\nAB: Turns out to be true. And some of what sounds quite normal turns out not to be true. So I guess it makes sense. That’s the nature of Karim’s story, because that’s the nature of war.\n\nJH: I think we’re done. Thank you, and congratulations once again.\n\nAleksandar Brezar was born and lives in Sarajevo. He has worked as a journalist at Radio 202 and a translator for several documentary films and other projects for PBS, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, AL Jazeera English, and the Sarajevo Film Festival. His translations have appeared in the Massacusetts Review, the Brooklyn Rail, Protest.ba, PešCanik, and Lupiga.\n\nEnis Ćišić is an illustrator and comic book artist, working as a 3D animator at an advertising agency in Sarajevo. He is the creator of a number of music videos and album artworks for notable bosnian musicians and bands. His work, including large-scale drawings of famous film scenes as well as other illustrations, was exhibited throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, while his short comic books were published in various magazines throughout the former Yugoslavia.\n\nJim Hicks is the Executive Editor at the Massachusetts Review\n\nBetween Realism and Fantasy\n\n(Read Part One here.)\n\nJH: The next obvious subject is to talk about process, and how this comic came about. From an idea to an object that exists in the world, there’s a hell of a lot of work. So tell us about that. One of the things people who don’t know much about it don’t know is just how much work it is to make comics.\n\nEČ: It took us what, six months?\n\nAB: No, more than six months. Between nine months and a year.\n\nEČ: A long, long process. I read that particular story before Aleksandar contacted me, and I was already thinking about how that story could be translated into a comic. At the time, I was reading a lot of foreign comic books to get ideas and stories, but I’d never taken anything from my own place, my town, or from the time when I was a kid. So I really pleased that Karim wrote “Tesla,” which for me was such an amazing story. I remembered the mood and how the city looked during that period, and I was imagining some of the movies from when I was thirteen or fourteen, some science-fiction, fantasy, or thriller movies, placed in Sarajevo. And when I read that story, I saw that had almost everything I wanted to do. So when Aleksandar contacted me I was really enthusiastic about doing it. But we knew it would be a long process.\n\nJH: So even though Aleksandar picked the story, you had already been hoping that it would be that one?\n\nEČ: I didn’t think about it in advance, but when he contacted me, and he mentioned that story, it really made sense. I’d read all the other stories, but that one, for me, it was right for drawing.\n\nJH: Tell me more, though, about your actual process. Many of the people who are interested in our magazine are writers and artists too, so questions about process are important.\n\nYou have the story. Then what do you do?\n\nAB: Well, I wasn’t trained in writing for graphic novels. Or in writing generally.\n\nJH: Did you have to learn from Enis about what he needed from you?\n\nAB: What I really did was find everything that was ever written about writing for graphic novels, and then I read all of that. Then I said, “Okay, this makes sense. . . or this is pertinent.” I mean, I did know a bit about film, and how to write for film. And that helped.\n\nJH: I don’t know if this is a good analogy, but I use it anyway. I think about storyboarding for movies and how scenes are constructed for films.\n\nEČ: It’s the same. It’s the same. In the process of doing it, I think that we both learned about our process from each other. You, Saša, were reading about graphic novels and writing and scripting. And I had some experience in making comics, so I’d suggest some ideas about how the scenes might look. As if we were doing a movie, as you said. Storyboarding the panels, and placing the camera in the scene, and putting characters in the scene, etc. For me it was really a pleasure, that early stage of pre-production. . .\n\nAB: As I said, by knowing a little bit about film, you understand the dynamics, and that time in film is linear. When you reading a comic, time is relative. So you have to understand the differences between cuts in film, and editing in film or TV, or what have you. Well, comics is a form of editing as well. It takes people about ninety seconds to read a page of a comic book. When you know that, you can play with the speed of events, and make things last longer, how characters appear briefly, or take a little bit more time. Time is key here.\n\nEČ: Yes, yes. That’s it: the difference between comic books and a movie is that you look at every panel, every shot, on the page. You can see it. When you open a page, you see every shot on the page. It’s important for the artists to guide the dynamic of the reading; you have to guide the audience to look at the right images. And there are rules how to do it. That’s the only difference, I think, from movies.\n\nIn our process, we tended to talk mainly about the dynamism of the story. Because with this story, I had to put some action, some more dynamic images. And we also talked about the mood, about how the city looked in that period, the architecture of the town, and other story elements. That’s something that Karim didn’t have written down.\n\nJH: There are a lot of wonderful things in this adaptation, but especially its sense of place. You have a series of establishing shots where reader responds, “A-ha! That’s where we are. And that’s what it’s like.”\n\nEČ: It’s filling in something that’s not written. Information for people who don’t know what Sarajevo looks like, or who weren’t in Sarajevo during that period. It was important to have that.\n\nJH: In this medium, it may be one thing that you can achieve more directly and more powerfully than elsewhere. In any narrative, the reader should have an active imagination; you have to create the story in your mind. But in this case, it’s there. You see it.\n\nAB: And there’s also the issue of words. Because comics aren’t just images. That was a particular challenge. There’s a limit to the number of words you can put on a page.\n\nEČ: Yes, I remember you had to cut. . .\n\nAB: We wanted to stick to Karim’s words, because it is his story. . .\n\nJH: So you had to cut it down to a skeleton form, one that would still work as a story.\n\nAB: I think it’s twenty-five words per panel. I think that’s about the maximum number of words you can have in a single panel. And then for the whole page, I think it’s maybe two hundred and fifty words. Which is really not a lot.\n\nWorking on that, and trying to maintain first his voice, as well as a sense of reality, well, that was difficult. Plus, we had to do it in translation.\n\nJH: To do it in translation and to do it in genre, right? Because another part of your success what is getting the tone of a detective novel, or a thriller. It has a certain language, a certain rhythm, a certain feel. This could be a Hitchcock movie or a Dashiell Hammett story, something like that.\n\nAB: Dashiell Hammett, definitely.\n\nEČ: That was our reference. Film noir, we thought, was the best way to get this across.\n\nJH: That reminds me. There’s another technique you use. A lot of fun, but it’s also very effective. You make allusions—probably some I didn’t catch, but some I did—to other movies, to other scenes. For example, in one scene there’s what looks like a shot from Dr. Strangelove.\n\nAB: Yes, that was what we wanted. I think it was in the script. I think I mentioned it.\n\nEČ: There’s also a shot from The Third Man.\n\nWe did use a lot of references of the sort you mention. We did a mapping of the film noir style and then just mixed them together.\n\nJH: So why do that? What does it accomplish? As an artist, do you always do this? Is it part of your technique, or is it something specific to this story?\n\nEČ: Actually, for this story, I was thinking about it. I don’t have any photos from the period during the war. But I did a lot of research to find different kinds of photographs, not just photographs from the famous photographers, or from newspapers. I have some friends who gave me their private photographs of the town during the siege.\n\nAnd it’s not something I use all the time in my process, but I like to look at movies, to use references, because of the photography and how the shadow and light works in some scenes. So that’s why for this project I thought certain scenes would be good to have. It’s also part of the pop culture and Hollywood we grew up around, watching those movies. So I almost had to have that kind of structure in my artwork.\n\nJH: But it’s also interesting. . . At some level, those are two really different ideas, right? One is photographic realism and the other is pop culture fantasy.\n\nAB: Well, Karim was also referencing a lot of stuff in his work, so a lot of it does point to him. Not just us. And also it really does help the readers get a better sense of what’s going on, whenever they can recognize a reference. “Huh? This is a panel from Dr. Strangelove. Oh, well then, I see where this is going.” It helps the reader.\n\nWith Karim, though, I don’t think his focus was on the war, not all that much.\n\nJH: Yes, that’s what you said at the beginning. On some level, telling the stories was a way to be outside the war.\n\nAB: So we use the war as a set-up. To set the story up for the reader, not to be explicit about what was happening. We also want the readers to do some of the work on that.\n\nJH: But on another level, that’s also a reality of the war. We’re talking about the siege in Sarajevo, where one of the activities of many of the people in the city in that time was to insist on creating culture and to continue the life of civilized people. Despite the barbarism, that history bestowed on them.\n\nEČ: That was another thing: when the characters are talking about Tesla, we didn’t want to have Karim just sitting, visually, typing. We wanted to show some of the things that people were doing in that period, like carrying water, chopping wood, running from snipers, etc. It’s not something that you have in that story, in the book, but we wanted to show. . .\n\nAB: The environment in which he lived, and how difficult it was then to do creative work.\n\nRead Part Three here.\n\nAleksandar Brezar was born and lives in Sarajevo. He has worked as a journalist at Radio 202 and a translator for several documentary films and other projects for PBS, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, AL Jazeera English, and the Sarajevo Film Festival.

The simplest way to describe his life and his work would be to say that he was a journalist and a writer from Sarajevo who, during the war and the siege, had a radio show where he read his stories on air—short stories that were a way of escaping the reality of the war, and that in some way provided at least a little bit of comfort for those who were listening. And that was basically his life’s work, until his life was cut short. At the very end of the war, at the very end of the siege, at the age of twenty-four. Everything else, I’m not sure we’re in a position to talk about it.\n\nJH: Yes.\n\nAB: We didn’t get a chance to know him. Both of us were too young.\n\nEnis Čišić: I lived in the same place at the same time, and, as Aleksandar said, recording those shows, reading the stories, that was his way of escaping that reality. I would just say that my escape, in that time, was reading comic books, and fantasizing about making comic books when I grew up. And I never met Karim, but I knew that he wrote some essays about comics, and he wrote some tutorials for a local magazine, about how to make comic books.\n\nJH: Yes, because he also drew comics, right?\n\nEČ: Well, he had an artist from Sarajevo who did the drawings, but he wrote the tutorial. So I read his tutorial, and I didn’t even know it was Karim. So later on, when I read his stories, and then Aleksandar contacted me to suggest that we could do one of his stories, it was important to me—because of that background, and some of my own experience in the period of the war, when I really wanted to write comic books.\n\nJH: So, even though you never met, he was one of your teachers?\n\nEČ: He was one part of my mind.\n\nKarim Zaimović\n\nAB: As for me, I only read Karim’s stories after the war, since I wasn’t here during the war. And they helped to get to the “why?” Since before you get to the why, you have to go through, past the how and the where and the when. And the who.\n\nI think that his stories—in addition to other authors, such as Dario Džamonja, who I always mention, Ozren Kebo, who wrote that great Sarajevo for Beginners, Miljenko Jergović, who wrote Sarajevo Marlboro—those were the authors who helped me get to “why.”\n\nJH: So the Zaimović collection of short stories, The Secret of Raspberry Jam, was published only after the war, I imagine.\n\nAB: Yes.\n\nJH: And all those stories started as radio stories?\n\nAB: Yes, although some of them were unfinished.\n\nEČ: Yes, as I remember, I think they had to edit some of the writing, because some of the stories weren’t finished.\n\nJH: Well, if it was to be read on the radio, some were perhaps more outlines or notes, so that he could improvise from a written structure as he was broadcasting.\n\nAB: The great shame is that they’ve lost the tapes. All of those shows were taped. Apparently all of the tapes have been lost. I’ve been talking with Lajla, his sister, about possibly trying to retrieve something. Just a couple of weeks ago, she told me that she might have found something . . . And for those of us who weren’t here then, I think it would be really interesting for us to hear him read them. To see how different they would be.\n\nJH: You’d think the CIA must have it on tape some place. . . Tell me a bit about the reception of these stories. Obviously they were popular after the war, and they’re still important here in Sarajevo today?\n\nAB: There’s an entire generation of people. . . Those who worked with Karim and those who knew Karim definitely consider them to be a cultural treasure. I think their meaning varies from generation to generation; for us, it must symbolize something different.\n\nJH: And this is part of a larger project, right? This story, done by Enis and you, but you’re also thinking of having other artists. . .\n\nAB: Yes, it is. There’s already another story called “The Invisible Man from Sarajevo,” drawn by Boris Stapić, that came out in Asymptote. Originally the plan was just to do this one. Well, there was no plan, actually. You talked me into it. You said, “Maybe you should try and do this. . .”\n\nJH: Yes, okay, we editors have lots of crazy ideas, and we pitch them all the time. But very few of them actually happen, because writers and artists have their own projects. And even when you solicit work, it’s not promised that you’re going to like what happens. So, from throwing out ideas to seeing something actually come into the world, there are a lot of steps in the way. And in fact it almost never works.\n\nAB: In this case, one thing led to another, and I ended up having three different publishers, from three different countries (that used to be one country). There's a great publisher in Zagreb, Croatia that has previously published Zaimović's short story collection, which is a nice coincidence. There’s a really good publisher in Belgrade too, and we also have a publisher in Sarajevo. And there’s a third artist as well. . . but don’t ask me how that’s going to play out.\n\nEČ: The thing is, it was important for us to continue Karim’s work, through comics, because he wrote about comics, and wrote for comics, but still there was no published story, no drawn story, from Karim Zaimović. Not that I know of. So it was important for us to contribute something, in that direction.\n\nAB: Actually, I think there is a comic that was written and drawn during the war by Dragan Rokvić. But I’ve never seen it.\n\nJH: Well, I like the idea of having multiple artists do the collection of short stories; it’s like Borges’s garden of forking paths. There’s the horror of having someone’s life cut off, when they had an entire future of creative work in front of them. You don’t know where it was going to go. You have no idea what his work would have been. So why not go in every direction at once? To show at least some of the possibilities.\n\nAB: What could have been.\n\nJH: What could have been, or at least. . . of course, the possibilities are infinite, but you can give some sense of the richness. There’s even a technical term in for this in narratology, the disnarrated. All the roads that weren’t taken. “If he had turned left that day, like everybody else, instead of turning right, then he would have ended up at the concentration camp too.” I once heard the professor who invented this term say that, for him, the amount of disnarrated in a story is roughly equal to its richness. So the more paths that it suggests. . .\n\nAB: You know, I was talking to Miljenko Jergović about this—he and Karim were friends—and last night he showed me this great photograph by Strašni [Milomir Kovačević]. The two of them were standing in the middle of a pile of junk during the war. Really an amazing photograph. And we were talking about what we were doing with the comic, and how people who were close to Karim might seen it, and he said, “Well, you have this great advantage of being able to do this without being distracted by knowing too much.”\n\nRead Part Two here.\n\nAleksandar Brezar was born and lives in Sarajevo.
