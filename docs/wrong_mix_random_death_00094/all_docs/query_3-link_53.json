        "text": "New Book review online\n\nSirens - Michael Bull. New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2020\n\nBook review by Paul Carter\n\nFree online course in sound and audio this summer offered by Barry Truax\n\nFollowing four very successful previous versions of this course, I am offering to mentor another group of participants in a 12 week online course in sound and audio, starting Wednesday May 8 and going to July 31. There is no fee for participating in this group.\n\nWe will be systematically going through the Tutorial associated with the Handbook for Acoustic Ecology located on the WSP Database, and covering two modules most weeks, one in acoustics, the other in electroacoustics. We’ll meet once a week on Zoom for 2-1/2 hours to discuss these topics, scheduled for 10:30 am – 1 pm PDT on Wednesdays.\n\nThis course will be useful as professional development to those wanting to teach sound and audio, as well as graduate students and others who would like to broaden their knowledge across multiple disciplines. If anyone wants to take the course for academic credit, they need to set this up at their own institution and I would supervise it.\n\nThe particular strengths (and challenges) of the Tutorial are the parallel modules in acoustics and electroacoustics that emphasize their often ignored links. I would expect participants to be more experienced in one or the other areas, but this course should allow for imbalances in knowledge to be addressed.\n\nThe Tutorial and Handbook files can be downloaded by each individual for ease of access, but participants can also use the online version. The preferred browsers are Safari and Firefox (Catalina OS and Chrome also seem to work). Additional software for experimentation will be made available.\n\nThose interested who have the time (I estimate you will need a minimum of 6 hours a week for the webinar and individual study if you want to take it all in), apart from whatever time would be spent with the personal listening and studio experiments), please contact me at truax@sfu.ca, if you have any questions or would like to view the Tutorial in advance, which I recommend.\n\nFor those in the Pacific region and its time zones, this year for the first time, I have arranged a parallel version of the course, hosted by Jesse Budel from Australia who will present the same topics with my recorded audio and the same Tutorial material. As a freelance individual, he will need to charge a fee for this service. Those interested should contact him directly at: budeljesse@gmail.com\n\nBarry Truax (truax@sfu.ca)\n\nProfessor Emeritus\n\nSimon Fraser University\n\nJournal of Sonic Studies: New issue online - Ethnographic rubbish\n\nJournal of Sonic Studies 25\n\nGuest Co-Editors: Jonathan Larcher and Heikki Wilenius\n\nAdditional contributors: Ernst Karel, Harsha Menon, Julie Métais, Sandro Simon, and Victor A. Stoichiță\n\nWhat can be considered as a discarded recording in an ethnographic inquiry? Do the instabilities and technical errors that may occur in recordings show that technology is an inextricable part of the encounter of ethnographic situations? Furthermore, is there a limit beyond which a sound is too degraded so it can no longer be restored, and instead can only be described in writing, the preferred medium of the human sciences in general and anthropology in particular? The contributions – six written essays, one video essay, and one conversation – offer a range of answers to these three questions, proving that sonic rubbish is worthy of scholarly attention. By approaching the issue of failed or deficient ethnographical recordings from different perspectives and different subdisciplines in anthropology, the ensuing contributions critically engage with discarded audio materials and in so doing challenge the long-standing emphasis on clarity and precision in field recordings.\n\nNew Book review online\n\nEarshot: Perspectives on Sound - Bruce Johnson.

The event will take place live in the Orangerie in the Amstelpark.\n\nAdmission free, registration required: Registration form\n\nPolyphonic Landscapes is an artistic research programme on sound and ecology in which 4 international artists explore the Amstelpark during a series of residencies in the Park Studio:\n\nBudhaditya Chattopadhyay (IN/NL)\n\nYolande Harris (UK/US)\n\nTeemu Lehmusruusu (FI)\n\nLia Mazzari (IT/UK)\n\nTheir research will result in an exhibition in and outside Het Glazen Huis in the fall of 2023. For more information and the broader context of Polyphonic Landscapes, please see: https://polyphoniclandscapes.artez.nl/\n\nCIRCULAR SEMINAR\n\nDuring this second seminar of Polyphonic Landscapes, the four participating artists will engage in a circular and participatory setting to share and discuss the key concepts of their research with the audience. The event encourages social dialogue, co-discussion, and co-thinking and will feature indoor sessions held in the Orangerie, interspersed with soundwalks and immersive listening exercises in the surroundings of Amstelpark.\n\nThe programme (see schedule below for more details) consists of four 'circles', each of which will be curated and led by one of the artists.\n\n[12.00 - 12.15] Word of introduction\n\n[12.15 – 13.15] In his research project The Pulse (at Amstelpark) (working title) Teemu Lehmusruusu aims to examine the surroundings of the Amstelpark by measuring environmental data and taking these measurements as a starting point for creating sonic sculptures act as ‘soil guards’, connecting to the dynamics of the soil-atmosphere-relation and collecting the environmental data on site in an exploratory mode. The intention of the data-gathering in this context is not to build scientific models, but to reach out to a bodily and experience-based way of knowing our interconnectedness with the natural world. In the seminar’s first circle, titled ‘The Soil Cycle’, Lehmusruusu invites you to engage with both an inner contemplation and a shared dialogue on the relationship with the Earth’s body of soil.\n\n[13.15 – 14.15] For Polyphonic Landscapes: Hydrophile, Lia Mazzari explores how live audio streaming engenders different modalities of being and listening with environments. At a time of digital saturation and accelerating planetary crisis, her project investigates the affordances and limitations of live audio streaming, making contributions to creative discourses on environmental sound and developing new creative/compositional strategies for engaging audiences in listening events. During Lia’s circle we will engage in a listening exercise with live audio streams followed by a discussion in the Amstelpark.\n\n-- Bring your own smartphone with data connectivity and a decent pair of headphones! --\n\n[14.15 – 14.45] Break\n\n[14.45 – 15.45] In Co-sounding: Towards a Sonorous Land Budhaditya Chattopadhyay delves into an sonically empowered intervention into the landscape, focussing on the site of the Amstelpark, which is a man-made nature, much like the canonical landscape paintings this project focuses on in order to unpack notions of mediation, rendering, and Anthropocenic appropriation of land into spectacle. The project intends to inculcate a dialogic context within which an intersubjective approach to the perception of land as an equitable habitat of human and non-human lifeforms is developed. This approach of reciprocity and intersubjectivity helps to counteract the nature-culture binary with ambient and environmental aesthesis. The complacent and stagnant landscape paintings of the colonial era are reread and deconstructed sonically, thus making them susceptible to questions of decoloniality, Anthropocene, politics of the senses, rights of nature and ownership of land.\n\n[15.45 – 16.45]\n\nIn the final circle Vertigo and the Sound Portal Yolande Harris invites us to explore states of sonic reorientation through the vertiginous experience of a sound portal. Harris writes: 'How do we experience an overlaying of the sound of two places at once? Presence over distance, one environment augmenting another through sound, the potential for increased connection and empathy. I have become fascinated by such an expanded perception and the idea of a ‘sound portal’. A sound portal - the transition from sensing one place to simultaneous places - encourages a heightened sensitivity and relational reorientation, facilitated by sound and listening.'\n\n[16.45 – 17.00] Wrap up.\n\nNew Book review online\n\nMedia of the Masses: Cassette Culture in Modern Egypt - Andrew Simon.

We welcome submissions from speakers at any career stage (including postgraduate MA or PhD candidates) and from a wide range of disciplines such as musicology, film and television studies, cultural studies, communications studies and so forth. The first Sound on Screen conference invited participants to take their cue from Chion (1994) and Mera et al. (2017) in drawing together ‘different practices and technologies under the same umbrella without attempting to obfuscate the differences that exist between them’. This resulted in a diverse range of topics and speakers, and allowed us to create interdisciplinary panels that brought different fields and viewpoints into fruitful dialogue with each other. We intend the second Sound on Screen conference to continue this rich discussion and so in addition to inviting any relevant paper proposals, we particularly welcome submissions that engage with the interplay between sound and music on screen, and also considerations of equality, diversity and inclusion in relation to music and sound on screen. This conference will be held in person at our Headington campus in Oxford, but hybrid options will be available to presenters and delegates.\n\nTopics might include, but are not limited to:\n\n• Music and sound in narrative film and/or television\n\n• Music and sound in documentary forms\n\n• Music and sound in videogames\n\n• The absence of music and sound in film and television\n\n• The relationships between music and sound\n\n• EDI and screen industries\n\n• Gendered music on screen\n\n• Music and sound in animated film and television\n\n• Audience engagement with music and sound on screen\n\n• Sound on screen as practice: composers and/or sound design\n\n• Sound effects and/or noise on screen\n\n• Pre-existing music and sound on screen\n\nThe programme committee may, at our discretion, extend the conference to three days if demand deems it appropriate. If your paper is accepted, we will provide the opportunity to select your preferred presentation day, including the potential third day.\n\nThe programme committee consists of Dr. Jan Butler (Senior Lecturer in Popular Music, Oxford Brookes University), Dr. James Cateridge (Senior Lecturer in Film, Oxford Brookes University), and Dr. Matt Lawson (Senior Lecturer in Music, Oxford Brookes University), and Dr. Lindsay Steenberg (Reader in Film Studies, Oxford Brookes University).\n\nThe Conference is organised with the support of the Centre of Research in the Arts (CoRA)\n\nFurther information can be requested by contacting soundonscreen@outlook.com\n\nDetails of the first Sound on Screen conference can be found at Sound on Screen 2021.\n\nPolyphonic landscape - Save the date\n\nArtEZ Professorship Theory in the Arts in collaboration with Zone2Source (platform for art, nature, and technology in the Amstelpark, Amsterdam) are pleased to invite you to the online opening seminar of Polyphonic Landscapes on Thursday 16 March 2023, 12:00 – 17:00.\n\n(Admission free, registration required: polyphoniclandscapes.artez.nl)\n\nPolyphonic Landscapes is an artistic research programme on sound and ecology in which 4 international artists explore the Amstelpark during a series of residencies in the Park Studio:\n\n• Budhaditya Chattopadhyay (IN/NL)\n\n• Yolande Harris (UK/US)\n\n• Teemu Lehmusruusu (FI)\n\n• Lia Mazzari (IT/UK)\n\nTheir research will result in an exhibition in and outside Het Glazen Huis in the fall of 2023.\n\nOnline opening seminar\n\nIn this first seminar, the participating artist-researchers will present their projects, after which they will\n\nengage in an interview with an assigned critical friend.

In this context the concept of landscape acquires a new urgency, as well as a new meaning: Where landscape historically has often been thought of as a picturesque vista or a passive backdrop for human protagonists, contemporary artists and theorists conceptualize landscape not so much as a noun but as a verb. The latter expresses a continuous flux of becoming in which both human and more-than-human agencies are entangled in a polyphony of 'world making', i.e., landscaping.\n\nListening as research\n\nIn the artistic research project Polyphonic Landscapes sound artists Budhaditya Chattopadhyay (IN, NL), Yolande Harris (UK, US), Teemu Lehmusruusu (FI) and Lia Mazzari (IT, UK) enquire into the question of how sound and the act of listening can contribute to a more active understanding of landscapes. In other words: How can our sense of hearing foster a more embodied, inclusive, relational, and reciprocal connectivity to our environment, the latter being ecologically understood as a process in which various life forms, materials, energy flows and temporalities are involved?\n\nThe underlying goal of the project is to gain more insight into how artistic research(-ers) produce new entrances to layers of knowledge that are not, or hardly, accessed by regular academic practices. The ways in which the artists give shape to their explorations and how they demonstrate the public aspects of research are an important point of focus.\n\nPolyphonic Landscapes operates at three levels:\n\n1. Sonic research into the urgent relation between nature and culture\n\n2. Research into the agency of both theory and practice in artistic research\n\n3. Research into the ecology of the senses and the multisensorial\n\nResearchers and location\n\nIn Polyphonic Landscapes these questions will be explored by four internationally acclaimed sound artists. Their one-year-long artistic research will result into the creation of new sound works that facilitate embodied and situated ways of knowing and experiencing landscapes. To foster a fruitful cross-pollination between artistic practice and critical theory, researchers of the ArtEZ Professorship Theory in the Arts (led by Peter Sonderen, project leader Joep Christenhusz) and Zone2Source director Alice Smits will act as a theoretical sounding board, alongside other experts.\n\nThe artists will focus their research on the specific landscape of the fifty-year-old Amstelpark where Zone2Source is located. The Amstelpark, designed for the Floriade in 1972, is a hybrid environment in which the urban and natural are closely intertwined. The proceedings of their investigations will be shared during three public research seminars. To conclude the project, the connected sound works will be exhibited by Zone2Source from mid-September through mid-November 2023.\n\nNational Research Agenda (NWA)\n\nPolyphonic Landscapes is part of the Art Route NWA-project Bit by bit, or not at all within the scheme ‘Small Projects’ which is financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO). In this project several cluster questions will be addresses that were posed by the National Research Agenda. For instance: ‘What is quality of life?’ and ‘What does art mean to people?’.\n\nPolyphonic Landscapes seeks to find new perspectives on these questions by means of artistic research that inquires after the relationship between nature and culture, and the position of the human and non-human in particular. It endorses the NWA Art Route’s view that, in the face of global climate breakdown, art can be an alternative way of knowledge production that sidesteps dichotomies between subject and object, knowing and experiencing, human and non-human, in the face of climate breakdown.\n\nJournal of Sonic Studies: New issue online - Voice and Listening as Techniques for Political Life\n\nhttps://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/558896/1937426\n\nGuest Co-Editors: Fadia Dakka, Kirsten Forkert, Ed McKeon, Jill Robinson and Ian Sergeant\n\nContributors:Ximena Alarcón-Díaz & Ed McKeon, Sarah Amsler, Kate Lacey, Sipho Ndlovu and Ryan Sinclair, Rajni Shah, Rodrigo Toro and Donovan Hernández, and Tom Western.\n\nWe are launching today this special issue of the Journal of Sonic Studies on ‘Voice and Listening as Techniques for Political Life’: a forum for contributions across cultural studies, performance studies, political geography, social science, deep listening, sound art, and performance poetry.\n\nWhen we staged our one-day symposium on this topic at Birmingham City University in March 2021, we were marking the anniversary of the UK’s first lockdown during the global pandemic. With tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths already recorded and unbearable strain on hospitals, doctors, and other public services, it felt urgently important to take time out with others to both gain a better understanding of the current situation as well as to discover strategies for action and renewal.\n\nPerhaps it was the enforced isolation and withdrawal from public space that prompted our attention towards matters of voice and listening. Congregating with others had been restricted by law. Social media began to function as a kind of proxy or ersatz political arena, yet this mediation of everyday political practice brought with it a host of distortions. . As we know only too well, algorithms amplify some opinions and diminish others, demanding our prolonged attention with distractions, rage, and outrage.\n\nWe are grateful to the editors of the Journal for giving us this opportunity to pause and reflect further, to invite a global array of contributions, and to share this with a broader public. This is an urgent discussion to be had and we invite you to take part. In addition to reading and listening to the different pieces, do join us for our live hybrid launch event on Friday 10 March, 4-5:30pm GMT (face-to-face at BCU and online on Zoom).

Climate change, pandemics, food shortage and wars are the result of brutal economic exploitation of the planet as well as struggles for the control of natural resources and the denial of the ongoing crisis of the planet.\n\nThe end of the world, of course, refers not just to nuclear or climate disasters, but also to the end of a worldview, models of knowledge or even cognitive, social or affective patterns. A new world emerges outlining its creative powers and its dystopias of control, automation and extraction of natural resources necessary for technological development.\n\nHow do sound and music cultures take part, articulate, face and/or politicize themselves in the face of late capitalism and the Anthropocene? What do certain sounds and certain songs teach us in the face of situations that don't seem to have any other alternative but to accelerate? Which sounds need to be heard, which are being ignored and which denounce the urgency of the end of the world? Last, but not least, what does it mean to listen to the end of the world? In this sense, the III International Conference on Sonorities Research (CIPS) - Sounds of the End of the World seeks to highlight the different sonorous aspects of our relationship with the world and with the transformations through which it has passed.\n\nThe III CIPS welcomes proposals for academic presentations and artistic performances. Some of the perspectives, but not the only ones, that interest this conference are:\n\n1. Sound ecologies: Anthropocene, creation and entropy\n\n2. Sound identities: Post-coloniality; Decoloniality; afro-futurisms; Amerindian Perspectivism\n\n3. Technologies and production models: the late capitalism's sound project\n\n4. Collective fear, emotions, media and music\n\n5. Modes of listening, signs and sound affects in times of capitalist realism\n\n6. Struggles, Resistances, Insurgencies: Sound, listening and survival in a world at risk\n\nSubmission of abstracts: until December 16, 2022\n\nThe 2nd call will soon be published with guidelines and e-mail for submissions.\n\nJournal of Sonic Studies 23 online\n\nThe editors of the Journal of Sonic Studies are proud to announce that its 23th issue is online. This special issue of the Journal of Sonic Studies, edited by guest editor Diana Grgurić, brings together scholars and artists in exploring the acoustic culture of the Balkans. From a variety of theoretical perspectives broadly set in the interdisciplinary field of sonic studies, the authors contribute with articles of analytical and artistic provenance, investigating the sonic practices, their perceptions and memories, as well as the socio-political organization of music and sound in this specific geographical region in Europe.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nSounds of the Balkan – Editoria - lDiana Grgurić\n\nSoundscapes of Stalinism: Acoustical Experiences in Bucharest in the 1940s and 1950s - Błażej Brzostek\n\nA Spectral Geology - D.A.

Teboul\n\nOnline course in sound and audio offered by Barry Truax\n\nFollowing two very successful previous versions of this course, Barry Truax is offering to mentor another group of participants in a 12 week online course in sound and audio, starting May 12 and going to July 28, 2022.\n\nThe course will be systematically going through the Tutorial associated with the Handbook for Acoustic Ecology located on the WSP Database, and covering two modules most weeks, one in acoustics, the other in electroacoustics. Meetings will be once a week on Zoom for 2-1/2 hours to discuss these topics, scheduled for 10:30 am – 1 pm PDT on Thursdays.\n\nThis course will be useful as professional development to those wanting to teach sound and audio, as well as graduate students and others who would like to broaden their knowledge across multiple disciplines. If anyone wants to take the course for academic credit, they need to set this up at their own institution.\n\nThe particular strengths (and challenges) of the Tutorial are the parallel modules in acoustics and electroacoustics that emphasize their often ignored links. Participants may be more experienced in one or the other areas, but this course should allow for imbalances in knowledge to be addressed.\n\nThe Tutorial and Handbook files will be downloaded by each individual for ease of access. The preferred browsers are Safari and Firefox (those with the Catalina OS and Chrome are likely to encounter problems). Additional software for experimentation will be made available.\n\nThe meeting time will be Thursday morning at 10:30 Pacific time, for North and South Americans, which will be the evening for those in Europe. Unfortunately, it’s doubtful that participants from other parts of the world would be able to participate as easily given the time differences; however, a Pacific Rim version with Susan Frykberg (who is based in Australia/NewZealand) may be available and will involve a modest fee (contact sfrykberg@gmail.com) if you are interested.\n\nThose interested who have the time (you will probably need a minimum of 8 hours a week for study, apart from whatever time would be spent with the personal listening and studio experiments), please contact Barry Truax at truax@sfu.ca, also if you have any questions or would like to view the Tutorial in advance, which is recommended.\n\nNew release by Joseph Nechvatal\n\nAfter having published the decades-spanning cassette retrospective Selected Sound Works (1981-2021) last year, on March 14, 2022, Pentiments is releasing here Joseph Nechvatal’s The Viral Tempest double vinyl LP and Bandcamp tracks.\n\nThe audio on the first disk – made in collaboration with Andrew Deutsch – is OrlandO et la tempete viral symphOny redux suite. It uses an anonymous reading of Virginia Woolf's Orlando as a type of sonic signature that Nechvatal’s virus-modeled artificial life audio material reanimates. The second piece, pour finir avec le jugement de dieu viral symphOny plague, serves as a brother suite to the first and instead uses Antonin Artaud's controversial recorded performance of his radio play To Have Done with the Judgement of God as the sonic figure.\n\nThe LP is in an edition 200 with a full color gatefold jacket, full color labels, an 11x11\" 12-page full color exhibition catalog documenting the paintings featured in Nechvatal’s 2020 Orlando et la tempête art exhibition at Galerie Richard (Paris) and an 8.5x11” insert featuring an interview with him by S.K.G.

Featuring the American trombone player, theoretician, and instrument builder Kevin Fairbairn, the Welsh composer and improviser Richard Barrett, and the Argentinian sound artist and composer Gabriel Paiuk, the event was comprised of 3 lecture-performances (and a brief introduction by Cobussen), exploring how Sonic Materialism can sound, how sound as sound can contribute to a more theoretical discourse on (New) Materialism.\n\nA registration of this event can be found here\n\nNew book review online\n\nPodcasting: The Audio Media Revolution - Martin Spinelli and Lance Dann. New York: Bloomsbury, 2019\n\nBook review by Jeremy Wade Morris\n\nFree E-book | Negotiating Noise: Across places, spaces and disciplines\n\nNegotiating Noise Across Places, Spaces and Disciplinesbrings together writing by 20 researchers from across Europe and South-East Asia on the slippery but fascinating topic of noise. What is noise, where can it be heard, and what should we do with it? These questions are answered in very different ways in this book from the perspectives of research in ar­chitecture, anthropology, cultural history and theory, ethno- and his­torical musicology, digital culture, linguistics, medicine, musical com­position, sociology, sound design, sound art, and urban planning. Drawing on transdisciplinary conversations at two workshops – one at Lund University and one at the University of Nottingham, Malaysia Campus – the book bridges professional as well as cultural divides. It sets out current research trajectories in the different disciplines involved in researching noise through a series of Position Papers. It also brings these perspectives together through a series of jointly authored Manifestos for the future.\n\nThe book can be downloaded via this link:\n\nhttps://books.lub.lu.se/catalog/view/115/132/1287-1\n\nSonic Aggregator project by Tuned City and Soundtrackcity\n\nSonic Aggregator is a collaborative project of Tuned City and Soundtrackcity about ‘sonic placemaking’ hosted by ABA Air Berlin Alexanderplatz at Haus der Statistik in Berlin. With Peter Cusack, Vanessà Heer, Michiel Huijsman, Udo Noll. Sonic Aggregator has been long in the making and postponed several times due to covid measures, but finally this project is about to happen! The official opening is on 17 September. In the week thereafter presentations, workshops, soundwalks and a salon are open to the public. Have a look at the programme make reservations!\n\nopening Sonic Aggregator: Friday 17. September 17:00\n\nAIR Berlin Alexanderplatz, Haus der Statistik\n\nOtto-Braun-Straße 70-72\n\nBerlin, 10178 Germany\n\nThe opening of Sonic Aggregator is part of ABA Air Berlin Alexanderplatz programme on Berlin Art Week 2021.\n\nSonic Aggregator is financially supported by Creative Industries Fund NL and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nWho has the right to decide how our urban environment should sound?\n\nThis question is at the heart of the Sonic Aggregator project, in which everyone is invited to research the sound environment of HAUS DER STATISTIK from 17 to 27 September and speculate on the sounds of the future city. How does it sound now? How should it sound? Who or what determines that?\n\nTo enable this research and speculation we will install the listening art object Sonic Aggregator on site. The object - a modular, sculptural installation - invites people to linger, listen and interact, transporting and conveying the idea of urban sound, like a kind of Trojan horse, directly in the urban environment. While sitting in the object's acoustically perfected semi-open sound space, visitors can virtually navigate through a defined part of the city via touchscreen and immerse themselves in the respective sound worlds.\n\nFree online course in sound and audio this fall offered by Barry Truax\n\nFollowing a very successful summer version of this course, I am offering to mentor another group of participants in a 12 week online course in sound and audio, starting around Sept. 9 and going to Nov. 25.\n\nWe will be systematically going through the Tutorial associated with the Handbook for Acoustic Ecology located on the WSP Database, and covering two modules most weeks, one in acoustics, the other in electroacoustics. We’ll meet once a week on Zoom for 2-1/2 hours to discuss these topics.\n\nThis course will be useful as professional development to those wanting to teach sound and audio, as well as graduate students and others who would like to broaden their knowledge across multiple disciplines. If anyone wants to take the course for academic credit, they need to set this up at their own institution.\n\nThe particular strengths (and challenges) of the Tutorial are the parallel modules in acoustics and electroacoustics that emphasize their often ignored links. I would expect participants to be more experienced in one or the other areas, but this course should allow for imbalances in knowledge to be addressed.\n\nThe Tutorial and Handbook files will be downloaded by each individual for ease of access. The preferred browsers are Safari and Firefox (those with the Catalina OS and Chrome are likely to encounter problems). Additional software for experimentation will be made available.\n\nA meeting time will be arranged to suit the participants, but it will likely be Thursday morning at 10:30 Pacific time, for North and South Americans, which will be the evening for those in Europe. Unfortunately, it’s doubtful that participants from other parts of the world would be able to participate as easily given the time differences; however, a Pacific Rim version with Susan Frykberg is also being planned.\n\nThose interested who have the time (I estimate you will need a minimum of 8 hours a week for study, apart from whatever time would be spent with the personal listening and studio experiments), please contact me at truax@sfu.ca, also if you have any questions or would like to view the Tutorial in advance.\n\nHere’s some of the feedback from the summer version of the course:\n\n[The course] was an invaluable experience for me, and I really am grateful for the opportunity\n\n… there's *a lot* to (re)learn and review from the Handbook and the Tutorials\n\nThe course completely changed my understanding of sound and my relation to it.\n\nIt was a great experience and it refreshed knowledge and brought new one, and I enjoyed the huge and important research you have put together.\n\nIt really allowed a lot of concepts that I vaguely understood to solidify and gain clarity, and it also revealed many ideas and phenomena that I was really clueless about. The information on the electroacoustic side of things really helped me understand things that I aurally understood, but never technically really grasped. It's given me a lot more confidence to tackle processing and effects.\n\nBarry Truax\n\nProfessor Emeritus\n\nSimon Fraser University\n\nHOME AND COVID-19: Dwelling and belonging in pandemic times - CALL FOR PAPERS AND CREATIVE RESPONSES\n\nA two-day symposium, 24 - 25 November 2021\n\nThe Museum of the Home, London, and online\n\nHow has home changed during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nHow have people experienced home in different and unequal ways?\n\nHow could home change for the better in a post-pandemic future?\n\nResearchers, artists, curators, community workers, faith leaders and others are invited to submit proposals for 20-minute papers on, and creative responses to, Home and COVID-19 for a two-day symposium at the Museum of the Home, London.\n\nWe welcome proposals that consider home in different places and contexts, and in a multiplicity of ways, including: domestic spaces and practices; home and belonging in relation to the neighbourhood, city, nation and/or diaspora; home, dwelling and (im)mobility; home as embodied, sensory, emotional and material; and home as a site of inclusion, exclusion and inequality.\n\nThe symposium is convened by the Stay Home Stories project (@stayhomestories), funded by the AHRC as part of the UKRI rapid response to COVID-19.

Hamburg: Adocs Verlag, 2023\n\nBook review by Marcel Cobussen\n\nInvitation from Barry Truax - Online octophonic course in Soundscape Composition\n\nI would like to invite individuals who have access to an 8-channel sound system, along with teaching studios with the same format, to participate in my upcoming Special Topics course in Soundscape Composition this coming term, from January to April 2024.\n\nThe course will start Wednesday Jan. 10 and go through to April 3, with a weekly two and a half hour Zoom meeting starting at 10:30 Pacific time, which translates to 8 hours later in the UK/Portugal and 9 hours later in Central Europe. There will be a two week break in February (Feb. 14 & 21), so 11 meetings in total in which I will survey the theory, history and emerging practice of soundscape composition.\n\nI regard the octophonic component as essential to understanding the potential of studio-based soundscape composition, and although the webinars will feature many stereo examples, I intend to play one or two 8-channel pieces each week. How that will work online is that each week, I will send out a download link for the files involved, and then they will be played at the appropriate time during the following webinar in each location simultaneously on your own system, with a real-time Spectrogram display from our studio on the Zoom monitor.\n\nSo, in summary, I am prepared to host and conduct a weekly webinar over 11 weeks, sometimes including guest composers. I will also prepare a package of supplementary readings related to soundscape composition that can also be easily downloaded in advance. In addition, the full resources of the WSP Database will be made available. There is no course fee.\n\nIn the case of participating studios, I will leave it entirely up to them as to who can take part in their studio, that is, whether they are treated as auditors or credit students and under what requirements. For individuals who have their own 8-channel access, they can join the Zoom meetings individually, and receive their own copies of the readings and soundfiles.\n\nThose individuals who do not have multi-channel access are probably best advised to wait for the next online Tutorial course starting in May that will depend only on stereo sound examples. However, those wanting to audit this course just in stereo will be welcomed. Those wanting academic credit for the course need to arrange this with your home institution.\n\nI have a provisional course outline with most of the specifics which I will send to anyone who is interested.\n\nLooking forward to your response\n\nBarry Truax (truax@sfu.ca), Professor Emeritus\n\nNew Book review online\n\nMusic and Digital Media: A Planetary Anthropology - Georgina Born (ed.). London: University College London, 2022\n\nBook review by Jean-Baptiste Masson\n\nNew book on film sound by Martine Huvenne\n\nThe Audiovisual Chord: Embodied Listening in Film – Martine Huvenne\n\nThis book is a phenomenological approach to film sound and film as a whole, bringing all sensory impressions together within the body as a sense of movement. This includes embodied listening, felt sound and the audiovisual chord as a dynamic knot of visual and auditory movements. From this perspective, auditory spaces in film can be used as a pivot between an inner and an external world.\n\nDr. Martine Huvenne retired after a career teaching and researching in the audiovisual field. She was a senior lecturer in Sound and Music for Film at the Kask & Conservatorium (Hogent-Howest), Belgium, where she developed a phenomenological approach to music and listening.\n\nCall for papers: How do you sound design? Articulating experiences and cultures via listening – DRS2024 BOSTON Conference\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that the DRS2024 BOSTON Conference is now welcoming submissions.\n\nWe invite you to consider submitting to the Theme Track #26:\n\n“How do you sound design? Articulating experiences and cultures via listening”\n\nThe theme track is organised by the Special Interest Group on Sound-Driven Design.\n\nThe call for papers can be found via the following link: https://www.drs2024.org/theme-tracks/#26\n\nDeadline for paper submission: October 13th, 2023\n\nNotification of acceptance: February 16th, 2024\n\n--------------\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe SIG on Sound-Driven Design invites researchers and practitioners to delve into the multifaceted nature of sound, unravelling its physical, perceptual, emotional, and socio-technological dimensions, and contribute to the discovery and development of design methods and tools. In the sound-driven perspective, listening emerges as element that adds depth and richness to the design space, adding to the role of the senses in the experience of the form quality of products, services, and systems. We propose to reflect on the holistic and inclusive character of “sound-driven” as it combines the diverse sonic, experiential, technical, and cultural manifestations of sound with the creative, integrative, mitigative, and purposeful essence of designing. We welcome contributions that offer insights and actionable knowledge on the process of sound-driven design by:\n\nExploring the sonic and creative aspects, with a focus on the sensory, emotional and aesthetic qualities of the audible embodiment to create unique and innovative sonic identity for projects\n\nExamining the experiential and integrative aspects, with a focus on how sound enhance and reinforce other sensory cues, such as vision and touch, and ultimately interacts with other design elements to create cohesive and coherent experiences\n\nTackling the technical and mitigative aspects, with a focus on the sources and systems that produce unwanted or harmful sound, in order to create more comfortable and healthy environments\n\nFraming the cultural and purposeful aspects, with a focus on crafting culturally relevant and meaningful sound for specific audience or community, conveying values and practices, bridging communities, and fostering connections among stakeholders\n\nElif Özcan Vieira\n\nStefano delle Monache (TU Delft, NL)\n\nNicolas Misdariss (IRCAM, FR)\n\nNew Book review online\n\nHalf Sound Half Philosophy: Aesthetics, Politics, and History of China's Sound Art - Jing Wang.

From smell’s “Proust effect” to music’s ability to improve memory and mood, the senses are processed in the brain in particular ways that highlight the strong link between remembering and sensing the world. Likewise, the senses work in tandem, through synesthesia, to evoke feelings and sensations of a past event. The body plays a central role in navigating the world, and the senses provide routes to past, at times forgotten, memories.\n\nAs sensory studies and memory studies continue to grow and shift as interdisciplinary fields, the overlap between the two demands further investigation. The aim of this edited volume is to dive deeper into the connections that exist between these two fields and to discuss underexplored topics within these areas of study, such as disability in narratives of sensory remembering and the sensory memories of plant and animal life. This volume is searching for creative, interdisciplinary works in the humanities that grapple with topics related to the senses and memory in new, understudied ways.\n\nQuestions of importance include: How do the senses evoke memory and convey details of an event? How is sensory memory different from other forms of memory? What is unique about one sense’s ability to evoke memory compared to the other senses? How do new technologies and art reframe the link between the senses and memory? How do mediums (films, texts, paintings, etc.) differ in their portrayal of sensory memory?\n\nPossible topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n• The senses in arts and media\n\n• New technologies\n\n• Disability studies\n\n• Synesthesia\n\n• Nostalgia\n\n• Environmental humanities\n\n• Animal and plant life\n\n• Conflict, violence, memory\n\n• Embodiment\n\n• Creative approaches to sensory memory\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this edited volume, please submit your proposal (500-700 words abstract) along with a short biography (100-150 words) in PDF format by August 1st, 2023 to the book editor, Chanelle Dupuis (chanelle_dupuis@brown.edu).\n\nProposal acceptance will be notified by September 1st, 2023. Full chapter submissions are to be delivered by February 1st, 2024.\n\nJournal of Sonic Studies - Call for papers\n\nThe last decade has witnessed what has been characterised as a material turn in the arts and humanities, which has shifted attention from the role played by language and discourse within culture to that of objects, technologies, materials, and non-human organisms and processes. New ways of thinking about materiality prompted by developments in realist philosophy, including new materialism and speculative realism, have raised important questions about the place of the material in arts and culture, nonhuman agency, the relationship between technology and culture, anthropocentrism, and the environment. However, consideration of the sonic has not always been at the forefront of these discussions – perhaps because sound has been understood to be immaterial or addressed in ontological ways that privilege its sources. In this way materialist approaches to the sonic raise the possibility of rethinking the nature of sound itself, and thereby what is at stake in it.\n\nIn this special issue of the Journal of Sonic Studies we will explore how new ways of thinking about materiality might contribute to our understanding of sound, and at the same time how sound might contribute to developing ideas on materiality.\n\nThis special issue continues and builds on the journal’s discussion of sonic materiality in its two ‘Materials of Sound’ special issues edited by Caleb Kelly (2018 and 2019) and focuses on two fundamental questions: what is sound’s materiality and what is sonic materialism?\n\nWe welcome proposals for both articles and sound artworks that specifically address the issue of sonic materiality. Proposals may engage with, but are not limited to, the following topics:\n\n• What is sound’s materiality, and what is at stake in a critical engagement with sonic materiality?\n\n• How can notions of materiality politicise and historicise thinking about sound?\n\n• What are sound’s material dimensions? Do these relate only to the objects, technologies, bodies and organic and inorganic forms of matter that create, preserve or respond to sound? Or are there ways in which sound (as event, energy or change) might be considered material?\n\n• What new perspectives on the cultures, technologies, politics and ethics of sound are opened up by a consideration of sound’s materiality?\n\n• How do notions of nonhuman agency relate to sound’s materiality? What is at stake in the idea of sonic agency?\n\n• In what ways might creative practice in sound represent a form of ‘material thinking’? How do technological and material processes challenge established forms of creative practice?\n\n• What is a sonic object?\n\n• If the notion of sonic ecology points to the ways in which sound is situated within environments, what does a consideration of materiality bring to this?\n\n• What are the ecological and biopolitical dimensions of sound’s materiality? How might ideas about materiality prompt a reconsideration of the relationship between the human and the nonhuman?\n\n• How might sonic materialism function as a form of nonideal theory, through direct engagement with material objects and practices rather than idealized models of sound?\n\n• How might a critical engagement with sound address the gap between the philosophical and theoretical approaches to materiality and the experienced materiality of sound and sound-related objects and processes?\n\n• How can we create a language of materialism that emerges directly from the materials of sound?\n\n• What might sound contribute to the material turn’s shift to objects, technologies, materials and nonhuman organisms and process? How might this relate to the anthropocentrism inherent in what has been termed the ‘sonic turn’, in which recent discussion of the politics of listening have focused on the human subject.\n\n• How might indigenous perspectives on matter and sound challenge and problematise the so-called “new materialism”?\n\nWe would particularly welcome proposals for articles that address these topics from Global South and/or Global Majority perspectives.\n\nPlease send your abstract (300 words) and short contributor biography (100 words) to Andy Birtwistle andy.birtwistle@canterbury.ac.uk and Lauren Redhead l.redhead@gold.ac.uk by 30 July 2023\n\nFree online course in sound and audio this summer offered by Barry Truax\n\nFollowing three very successful previous versions of this course, I am offering to mentor another group of participants in a 12 week online course in sound and audio, starting May 11 and going to July 27. There is no fee for participating.\n\nWe will be systematically going through the Tutorial associated with the Handbook for Acoustic Ecology located on the WSP Database, and covering two modules most weeks, one in acoustics, the other in electroacoustics. We’ll meet once a week on Zoom for 2-1/2 hours to discuss these topics, scheduled for 10:30 am – 1 pm PDT on Thursdays (which will be 9 hours later in Central Europe).\n\nThis course will be useful as professional development to those wanting to teach sound and audio, as well as graduate students and others who would like to broaden their knowledge across multiple disciplines. If anyone wants to take the course for academic credit, they need to set this up at their own institution and I would supervise it.\n\nThe particular strengths (and challenges) of the Tutorial are the parallel modules in acoustics and electroacoustics that emphasize their often ignored links. I would expect participants to be more experienced in one or the other areas, but this course should allow for imbalances in knowledge to be addressed.\n\nThe Tutorial and Handbook files can be downloaded by each individual for ease of access, but participants can also use the online version. The preferred browsers are Safari and Firefox (Catalina OS and Chrome also seem to work). Additional software for experimentation will be made available.\n\nThose interested who have the time (I estimate you will need a minimum of 8 hours a week for the webinar and study if you want to take it all in), apart from whatever time would be spent with the personal listening and studio experiments), please contact me at truax@sfu.ca, if you have any questions or would like to view the Tutorial in advance, which I recommend.\n\nBarry Truax (truax@sfu.ca)\n\nProfessor Emeritus\n\nSimon Fraser University\n\nNew book review online\n\nEngaging with Everyday Sounds - Marcel Cobussen.

Looking at communities and collectives from social movements to musical ensembles, from ethnic communities to artist collectives, isaScience 2023 seeks to investigate the entanglements of sound and power relations. What are the different forms and degrees of sonic participation and to what extent are they tied to local or globalized experiences?\n\nWe welcome proposals from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives including, but not limited to, Queer Theory, Musicology, Cultural Studies, Music Theory, Indigenous Studies, Music Sociology, Critical Race Studies, Ethnomusicology, Popular Music Studies, Dance and Performance Studies, Post-Colonial Studies, and Film and Media Studies.\n\nPossible topics may include:\n\nThe reproduction or subversion of hegemonic social structures in sonic communities and collectives\n\nThe relation of sound and music to political activism (from the labour movement to decolonisation struggles, from feminist protests to critical mass bike rides)\n\nExile, diaspora, and collective memory: how communities pass on their sonic legacy across history and ruptures of displacement and create forms of sonic belonging\n\nThe relation between musical communities and collectives and the tradition or innovation of musical and performance styles, idioms, and aesthetics (from historical to contemporary contexts)\n\nNegotiations of identity and social status in and through the participation in communities and collectives (e.g. racialization through sound, sonic dimensions of queerness)\n\nThe effects of sonic ties in various musical styles and genres: e.g. from ethnic reckoning in traditional music to (sub)cultural distinction in popular music to elite formation in classical art music\n\nThe impact of digitality on social structures through new (social) media or technologies\n\nCollective practices of listening and their impact on the social (from phonograph gatherings to punk concerts, from soundwalks to the social experience of fandom)\n\nSound and public space: how the right to the city is claimed or contested in sonic terms\n\nCommunality through sound in relation to rurality, vernacularity, and regional communities\n\nQuestions of methodology: from collective authorship to the reflection of approaches and research practices, particularly the academic categorization of and its influence on communities\n\nContributions can include paper presentations (20 minutes plus discussion), panels, lecture performances, workshops, or other, innovative formats. Online contributions are possible.\n\nAbstracts must clearly state your research question(s), theoretical framework, methodology, and presentation format. Please include max. 5 keywords.\n\nPlease submit your abstract in English (max. 300 words including references), a short biography (max. 100 words), and your institutional affiliation or location by 5 March 2023 in a single PDF file to isascience@mdw.ac.at\n\nDecisions on the acceptance of proposals will be announced in April 2023.\n\nisaScience is mdw’s international hybrid conference for interdisciplinary research on music and performing arts.

Walking redefines notions of composer, performer, public, and music itself, while opening new modes of perception and action. Going Out addresses these developments by exploring the relationship between walking, listening, and soundmaking in the arts—from the first soundwalks and itinerant performances in the 1960s to today's manifold ambulatory projects.\n\nThe book consists of an extensive essay by Elena Biserna followed by an anthology of historical and contemporary contributions in the form of documentation, essays, interviews, manifestos, scores, narratives, and reflections. Through the variety of these contributions, the book makes an argument that at the intersection of walking, listening, and soundmaking there is both a long legacy of interdisciplinary experimentations and a broad field that resounds with urgent issues in critical spatial thinking and practice.\n\nContributions from: Max Neuhaus, Willem de Ridder, William Levy, Collective Actions Group, David Helbich, Janet Cardiff, Jacek Smolicki, Carolyn Chen, Tao G.

Presented by the Orpheus Institute, Ghent (BE), and ACPA, University of Leiden (NL), Sound Arguments transcends the boundaries of art school or conservatory, art space or university to propose a new kind of creating-researching-learning community. It reaches into the broad and complex space of current art-sound practices. At Sound Arguments, artists will share, invent, learn and discuss.\n\nOur creative, imaginative relationship with sound has entered a fantastically rich period, facilitated and necessitated by cultural, social and technological evolution. Sound acts as a new parameter in a world evolved from the practices and theory of the visual arts or as a highly sophisticated art form in music composition and improvisation. It acts as a dimension of the plastic, installation and interactive arts. It provides a perspective on place, is a vital component of environmental art and a conveyor of information through sonification. It emerges as algorithmic surface, as the trace of virtuoso improvised performance or of informal social behaviour. And it provides an interface with technology.\n\nEach of these perspectives has its own discourse, practices, techniques, cultural infrastructure and institutions. Sound Arguments is a locus for this rich tapestry, a space that aims to bring together sound artists with diverse, and complementary, backgrounds. Through sustained cross-fertilisation, they will participate in the evolution of new common discourse and individual critical practice. At each of five monthly, two-day encounters you will meet and discuss with invited artists and experts, addressing issues from the abstract to the technical, from the social to the practical. Guest artists will act as catalysts for sharing and reflection between participants; you will acquire new techniques in workshops led by international experts, to stimulate and inform practice. All participants will be able to share their own projects in a wide-ranging, critical and supportive environment. As a community, we will expand horizons, vision and practice – and together hopefully evolve new discourse on contemporary sound-based practices.\n\nTopics include:\n\n# Hardware hacking & DIY electronics # Live coding & creative coding # Digital fabrication & 3D printing # The body in performance # Field recording # Alternative spaces and venues # Sound art theory and practice # The audio paper # Sound installation # Notation\n\nGuests for the series will include: Cecilia Arditto, Alexandra Cárdenas, Nicolas Collins, Julia Eckhardt, Sanne Krogh Groth, Cathy Lane, Marcela Lucatelli, Matteo Marangoni, Caeso and Guy van Belle.\n\nREGISTRATION --------------------\n\nSound Arguments will meet monthly from February – June 2023. Meetings will be held alternately in Ghent and Leiden, with the first meeting in Den Haag, February 27-28. Sessions will run on Mondays 14:00-18:00 and Tuesdays 09:00-15:00.\n\n2023 dates:\n\n# February 27-28 # March 27-28 # April 17-18 # May 15-16 # June 5-6\n\nThe nature of this series is such that numbers must be limited. Prospective participants are invited to apply by responding to this call at:\n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrxaL1PH2FP7cwjn\n\nThe form requests a brief description of the role of sound in your practice, which will allow us to balance the series appropriately. Application is open until 16 January. Applicants will be notified by January 25.\n\nSound Arguments is made available at no cost to participants, regardless of institutional affiliation. At Sound Arguments we aim to create a safe and inclusive environment for all those involved; we particularly encourage applications from historically under-represented groups in the field. As organisers, we commit to taking that into account during evaluation of the applications received.\n\nGeneral inquiries can be sent to soundarguments@orpheusintituut.be\n\nWe look forward to meeting you!\n\nMagno Caliman (Orpheus Instituut)\n\nMarcel Cobussen (Academy of Creative and Performance Arts - Leiden University)\n\nJonathan Impett (Orpheus Instituut)\n\nNew Book review online\n\nUnsound: Undead - Steve Goodman, Toby Heys, Eleni Ikoniadou (eds.)Falmouth (UK): Urbanomic Media Ltd, 2019\n\nBook review by Matt Lewis\n\nCFP | WFAE2023 ConferenceListening Pasts - Listening Futures\n\nAtlantic Center for the Arts is honored to partner with the World Forum for Acoustic Ecology for our 30th anniversary conference, Listening Pasts - Listening Futures.\n\nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to highlight the local and global work being done in the field of soundscape studies and acoustic ecology.\n\nSubmissions for papers, music, workshops, and installation proposals will accepted until October 15.\n\nFor details on the location, themes, registration, and CFP please visit\n\nhttps://www.wfae.net/conference2023.html\n\nNew book review online\n\nBook review by Mark Porter\n\nJournal of Sonic Studies 22 is Online\n\nJSS22 is the second special issue of the Journal of Sonic Studies on the topic Sound at Home. In the original call for papers, we asked scholars from a variety of disciplines to engage with home sounds – everyday sounds such as the hum of appliances, the babble of water piping, the chatter of media or the creaking of a wooden floor; sounds that seep in from other homes and from the world outside (traffic, music, shouting, etc.); disconcerting, unfamiliar sounds of places that have become a temporary home; or sounds that go unheard in their familiarity – using a wide range of approaches and methods. This second issue consists of contributions dealing with a number of closely related topics, namely, the home in its relation to the outside world, sonic communities within or in spite of isolation, and vocal expression as part of or in defiance of this isolation.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nEditorial - Sound At Home II: City, Home, Body - Sonic Relations and Voice - Mette Simonsen Abildgaard, Marie Koldkjær Højlund and Sandra Lori Petersen\n\nA Community Attuned to the Outside.

The event will occur November 19-20, at Le Nombre 110 (3935 de Rouen, #110, Montreal) and will be livestreamed on the FB page of the IICSI (https://www.facebook.com/improvcommunity/).\n\nHow can sound and music participate in protest without access to the streets and spaces of collective music creation? How does a collective sound when there is no actual gathering possible? Alternatively, when social movements take to the streets or occupy a territory despite public health regulations – as has happened on many occasions around the globe since the beginning of the pandemic (Black Lives Matter, Wet’suwet’en resistance, Belarus, Poland, Chile, Myanmar, The Netherlands, to mention only few) – what has changed on a sonic level? How can sound and music testify to the ways our current isolation has affected our capacity to collectively organize? And in this context, what can sound-based practices grounded in improvisation bring to the ongoing social and political struggles? (We conceive of music, protest and community very widely, and accordingly think of this event as a meeting point for artists, activists and researchers to reflect and share perspectives on these issues.)\n\nWe will have the pleasure to welcome Dont Rhine, co-founder of the international sound art and social intervention collective Ultra-red, as keynote speaker. Confirmed performers for the November 19 evening include Marilou Craft & Elyze Venne Deshaies, Joseph Bohigian and Geoff Mitchell & Kevin McNeilly, among others.\n\nPlease find attached the schedule for the event. For more infos: https://www.facebook.com/events/997286244181987\n\nWe acknowledge that this event will be held on an unceded territory which is used as a place of encounter and exchange between many First Nations, including the Kanien'kehá:ka, Huron/Wendat, Abenaki and Anishinabeeg.\n\nJournal of Sonic Studies - Call for Papers: Sound in the (Post-)Soviet Realm\n\nWhen an empire falls, does it make a sound? And who is there to hear it?\n\nThe sonic history of the USSR and the Post-Soviet realm that succeeded it, is rich and turbulent. The 2013 book Sound in Z by Andrey Smirnov introduced the world to the daring sound experiments of the Soviet avant-gardists of the 1920s. From the city-wide noise symphonies of Arseny Avraamov to the first electronic instruments of Leon Theremin to experiments with sounds drawn on paper or film, the futuristic optimism of the first decade following the revolution unleashed an explosion of sonic artistry. While the strict censorship and state control over the arts forced sound artists underground or into applied work, the Soviet sonic creativity persisted on the margins, or even wholly outside, of the state-controlled art world: in the kinetic sound sculptures of the Dvizhenie art group, the explorations of light and sound by the researchers of the Prometheus Institute, or the extravagant performances of the Pop-Mechanics movement, for example.\n\nHowever, the familiar history of the Soviet culture being shaped by the antagonism between official state-sanctioned art institutions and underground art communities conceals a different, colonial narrative. In the colonial structures of the contemporary world, the position of the Post-Soviet realm remains ambiguous: not quite part of the Global North, yet not fully in the Global South. Decolonial scholars investigating the Post-Soviet have called Russia/USSR a “subaltern empire” (Morozov 2015) or “poor North” (Tlostanova 2011), shedding light on the double oppression of its colonies: “the South of the poor North.” While sound art from the Russian capitals of Moscow and St. Petersburg/Leningrad is slowly being integrated into global sound histories, much less is known about the sound cultures and art of the Russian and Soviet colonies, both former – such as Kazakhstan or Georgia – and extant – the lands of Siberia and the Russian Far East.\n\nIn this issue of the Journal of Sonic Studies we will explore how these entanglements of coloniality, ideology, creativity, and resistance are reflected in the sound culture and art from the Soviet and Post-Soviet realm. We welcome article proposals related to, but not limited to, the following topics:\n\n●Sound art and sound poetry from the USSR and Post-Soviet territories\n\n●Soviet and Post-Soviet soundscapes, between megacities and tundras\n\n●Indigenous sound cultures of Siberia, (Post-)Soviet Asia and the Caucasus\n\n●Sound cultures of ethnic groups in USSR and contemporary Russia\n\n●Sound and music of the Soviet Underground in capitals, provinces, and national republics\n\n●Sound design in Soviet and Post-Soviet cinema\n\n●Soviet instrumental inventions: from the ANS synthesizer to the electronic bayan “Topaz”\n\n●Soundscapes of military aggression and resistance in the Post-Soviet realm: in Donbass, Abkhazia, and Nagorno-Karabakh, for example\n\n●Ideological implications of indoor and outdoor sonic practices\n\n●Sound in Soviet and Post-Soviet architecture and urban planning\n\n●Sacred and secular sounds in Soviet and Post-Soviet environments\n\n●Sound, music, and politics in the USSR and Post-Soviet countries\n\n●Sound in Soviet and Post-Soviet academic communities\n\nPlease send your abstract (300 words) and short contributor biography (100 words) to Vadim Keylin vadim.keylin@uni-hamburg.de and Ksenia Mayorova kmayorova@hse.ru by 15.01.2022\n\nRotting sounds symposium, September 23+24, 2021\n\nSince 2018, the project of artistic research Rotting sounds – Embracing the temporal deterioration of digital audio has been researching transformation processes pertaining to the diverse interrelations of digitally encoded information in the audio domain, its material properties and (human) interpretation within a sociocultural context.
