        "text": "Our summer in Maine libraries continues. Here’s the latest:\n\nJoin me, Dick Cass, and Barbara Ross on June 13th at 6:30 at the Scarborough, Maine library for an interactive “Making a Mystery” program where we will compose a mystery on the fly with the audience. These are hilarious, insightful, and a lot of fun. Hope to see you there.\n\nComing May 18th at the York Library:\n\nHave you ever wondered about how crime writers create their books?\n\nCome and hear this esteemed panel of well-established Maine Crime Writers as they share the secrets of their craft. What types of mysteries do they write, and why did they choose this genre? Do they approach writing as plotters (work from an outline), pantsers (don’t plan out anything or very little) or plansters (combination of the two)? Do they do extensive research or just make it up? And what about the development of their characters? Are they inspired by people they know? What is “Character Shopping”? Your questions will be answered, bring them all!\n\nThis program will be followed by a Q & A and a book signing.\n\nI’ll be presenting with Dick Cass and Jule Selbo\n\nhttps://yorkpl.librarycalendar.com/event/murder-our-minds-characters-plotting-and-research-9011\n\nhttps://www.exeterlitfest.com/event-details/crime-and-mystery-writers-brunch\n\nhttps://www.mainewriters.org/maine-crime-wave\n\nI’ll be receiving the Lea Wait Award at the Maine Crime Wave this June\n\nJanuary 9-13th, it’s free!!!\n\nArrived in December:\n\nIn case you missed them, here are some reviews of my new domestic thriller, Teach Her a Lesson:\n\n“Teach Her a Lesson” is a very scary psychological thriller by award-winning author Kate Flora, a masterful writer of mysteries and true crime. This story is disturbing, not only because Flora tells it so well, but because it plays out every day in American high schools: arrogant, demanding parents; cowardly, meek administrators; and aggressive, entitled students versus dedicated teachers who are outnumbered and unsupported. Flora makes a bold statement with this story.\n\nhttps://www.pressherald.com/2023/08/20/a-high-school-teacher-is-falsely-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-her-student/\n\n“Reading Kate Flora’s new thriller is like witnessing a massive car wreck you can’t tear your eyes from. You watch as protagonist Alexis Jordan, a devoted high school English teacher, struggles to comprehend her situation, becomes overwhelmed by it, and is driven to greater desperation with each successive shock wave. . . Flora unfolds the plot with deftness and offers penetrating insights into Alexis’ character. Teach Her a Lesson is a page turner.\n\nJoin me, John Clark, Matt Cost, and Maureen Milliken this coming Sunday, June 25th in Belgrade\n\nSUNDAY AT 9 AM – 2 PM\n\nBeach Reads Day\n\nBelgrade Lakes Village Green\n\nI got to be part of a fun collection of stories featuring authors’ series characters.

Joe is an older cop and is beginning to wonder if it is time for him to move on, while his partners value the experience he brings to each case. The investigation will soon encompass the exploitation of young girls coming to the United States seeking asylum and the criminals that feed off of their desperation. In my opinion, if you are looking for a well-rounded mystery detailing the gritty and daily time-consuming work of detectives pursuing and following the evidence, then the Joe Burgess series is a must read. Characters that don’t give up, sometimes hardened by what they see each day, but compassionate in remembering that they are to “serve and protect.”\n\nThis one was deep. All of the Burgess books are, but this one really shows you why the lives of police officers and their families are so difficult. To see the things they do, to continue to function in their duty, to live that life, and then go home and try to live with their families and friends in a normal existence has to be a level of stress like few of us will ever know. Kate takes us into their world with depth and realism that’s rarely seen. The settings, relationships the officers have and the unrelenting pressure that she builds around the characters is gripping,\n\nThis is another great Joe Burgess novel. The subject matter is tough…but, unfortunately, real and Kate has handled it well. I thoroughly enjoyed being back with Joe, his family and co-workers. And I have already Pre-ordered the next in this series. Thanks, Kate, for your true to life stories that keep us coming back for more.\n\nGreat review of A Child Shall Lead Them:\n\nA great interview of me for Sisters in Crime:\n\nhttps://sincne.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=2507&club_id=338034&item_id=2026&pst=8859&fbclid=IwAR39X-jLXjz1hYZaPb4lxonn2pujrwFL6bYAga3zNvbNSUYrWwrSFtlO710\n\nNOW AVAILABLE AT:\n\nAmazon Barnes & Noble Apple Books Google Kobo\n\nKate Flora and her writing companions Katy Munger, Taffy Cannon, Gary Phillips, and Lise McClendon have a valentine present for you.

Here’s the link: http://www.touristnewsmaine.com/images/issues/tnews_82318_issue.pdf\n\nThrilled to learn that Death Warmed Over is a finalist for the Maine Literary Award for Crime Fiction.\n\nComing soon – a collection of my crime stories:\n\nAfter a 2 1/2 year journey, Shots Fired has finally arrived!\n\nToday’s media is filled with discussions about officer-involved shootings. Too often missing from that discussion are the police officers’ voices and the reality of what happens in actual shooting incidents. Through interviews with involved officers, this book addresses common myths and misunderstandings about\n\nthese shootings.\n\nShots Fired: The Misunderstandings, Misconceptions, and Myths about Police Shootings is a journey “behind the shield” which highlights the experiences of the real human beings in the line of fire. It explores true events through the participants’ own eyes and takes readers inside the minds of officers during the actual event. The officers detail the roller coaster of emotions and severe trauma experienced during and after a shooting event.\n\nAlong with the intimate, in-depth explorations of the incidents themselves, the book touches the aftermath of police-involved shootings—the debriefings, internal and external investigations, and psychological evaluations. It challenges many commonly held assumptions created by the media such as the meaning of “unarmed” and why the police can’t just “shoot him in the leg,” creating an understanding that reaches beyond slogans such as “hands up, don’t shoot.”\n\nThe book, written by Joseph K. Loughlin and Kate Clark Flora, is valuable reading for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of police shootings—officers and police departments, reporters and politicians, and the public who rely on the police to keep them safe.\n\nBuy it now at Amazon:\n\nhttp://amzn.to/2i1FQWf\n\nBuy it now at Barnes & Noble:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2iJMVdy\n\nAsk for it at your library or local bookstore\n\nReviews\n\n“Shots Fired is a compelling book. If you want to learn and appreciate what being a cop means you must read this book now.”\n\n―Colonel (ret.) David Hunt, New York Times bestselling author, Fox News military and terrorism analyst“A thoughtful and timely book, Shots Fired goes beyond the headlines to educate the reader while at the same time delivering harrowing accounts of officers under the gun.”\n\n―SFPD Sgt. Adam Plantinga, author of 400 Things Cops Know“Shots Fired is a gripping account of what really happens when police officers find themselves in deadly-force encounters. The author points out that ‘from the Michael Brown incident on August 9, 2014 to the end of that year, forty-seven officers were killed by gunfire alone.’ Yet how many can cite their names? In an era when so many are demonizing law enforcement, this book reveals the humanity of those brave souls who walk the thin blue line.”\n\n―Thomas Jackson, author of Policing Ferguson, Policing America“A very important book that reveals, in stark detail, the grim realities beyond the inflammatory headlines of officer-involved shootings. Shocking, heartbreaking, and eye-opening, the up-close-and-personal accounts in Shots Fired will make you reconsider all you thought you knew about police work.”\n\n―Catherine Pelonero, New York Times bestselling author of Kitty Genovese“Shots Fired by Loughlin and Flora is a valuable addition to the literature of use of force, and a breath of fresh air and common sense in the current debate.”\n\n―Massad Ayoob, author of Deadly Force: Understanding Your Right to Self Defense“Shots Fired is must-reading for anyone with a sincere interest in the realities of deadly force incidents. It captures the nature of these events and the all-too-real human factors that are in play. It is educational, deeply moving, and a revelation of the searing personal experience that using deadly force inflicts upon our law enforcement officers. All concerned and interested citizens should read it, and if I had my way it would be mandatory reading for any reporter contemplating a story on a police shooting.”\n\n―Urey W. Patrick, author of In Defense of Self and Others“By focusing on the emotional stories that cops told the author about their experiences during and after officer-involved shootings, Shots Fired provides compelling information about the critical matter of the role that deadly force plays in modern American police work.”\n\n―David Klinger, professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, author of Into the Kill Zone“Pulling the trigger is not a casual event, especially for a police officer whose mission is to ‘preserve and protect.’ The more our citizenry understand about the pressures these officers must endure to do their jobs well, the better for our society. Our contribution to their efforts on our behalf is to be aware and informed.”\n\n―James Hawes, former Navy SEAL officer“This book offers us a peek behind the headlines at the human beings whose lives were changed forever by their actions. The candid interviews with police officers involved in a shooting incident are sobering and terrifying. By the time the whole truth is available the media has moved on. These accounts remind us there is always more than one side to the story.”\n\n―Lynne Finch, author of Female and Armed“The best thing a good book can do for you is to open your mind. It is not always a comfortable process, but it is always a rewarding one. Joseph K. Loughlin and Kate Clark Flora open your mind to the experience of police officers who are faced with the most consequential decision they must make―the decision to use deadly force. The authors invite you to step out of your preconceptions and into the cop’s unique life-or-death frame of reference. Accept the invitation, and one thing is certain: you will think hard before you pass judgment on the next news story that comes your way concerning an ‘officer-involved shooting.’”\n\n―Alan Axelrod, Cops, Crooks, and Criminologists and The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Forensics “Shots Fired reads like a fast-moving thriller at breathtaking pace. It is filled with vivid descriptions of street wars and real-life action heroes who expose themselves to the most dangerous and vile elements of our society without thanks so the rest of us can sleep. Be proud of them; I am.”\n\n―John Geddes, co-author of Be a Hero: The Essential Survival Guide to Active-Shooter Events“There’s a gulf between the law-abiding public’s perception of a police arrest and the stark reality. When they think about it, most citizens assume an arrest is a sterile, formal process with the subject generally ‘coming quietly.’ If only. Shots Fired takes us down the dark alleys behind the violent interface between officers and perpetrators. I found the shocked memories of individual officers raw, compelling and illuminating. Shots Fired is essential reading for all those genuinely interested in a functional society.”\n\n―Alun Rees, co-author of Be a Hero: The Essential Survival Guide to Active-Shooter Events\n\nKate is insanely excited that her story in The Obama Inheritance got a shout out from Maureen Corrigan on NPR:\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/10/09/556571413/collection-puts-a-playful-pulpy-twist-on-preposterous-stories-about-obama\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Obama-Inheritance-Fifteen-Stories-Conspiracy-ebook/dp/B06XYPF7WG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1507582056&sr=8-1&keywords=the+obama+inheritance\n\nThere’s a new Thea Kozak:\n\nBook Eight: Death Warmed Over\n\nArriving to view what will hopefully be her dream home, Thea Kozak finds her real estate agent, Ginger Stevens, tied to a chair, surrounded by fiery space heaters. Just before the woman dies, she utters the indistinct words: Bobby. So long. Safe. Sorry.\n\nThen a stranger, claiming to be Ginger’s boyfriend, corners Thea, demanding a package that Ginger gave to her, a package Thea never received.\n\nDetermined to get justice for Ginger, Thea begins her own investigation. Ginger’s colleagues know little about her, her apartment has been professionally sanitized, Ginger Stevens is the name of a child who died many years ago, and the Maine police have no idea who real-estate agent Ginger Stevens really is.\n\nBut Thea is sure the two men following her know Ginger’s true identity, and will stop at nothing to keep her from uncovering the truth behind the woman’s dying words.\n\nKobo – https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/death–warmed–over-the-thea-kozak-mystery-series-book-8 (this link is not yet active)\n\nThere’s a new Joe Burgess:\n\nResponding to a “shots fired” call at an abandoned warehouse, Detective Joe Burgess realizes his worst nightmare when he finds one rookie officer shot dead and two other officers–one his lieutenant–gravely wounded.\n\nWith two brother officers near death, Burgess must race the clock to find and arrest the one person angry enough to seek revenge against the Portland police, before the rookie officer’s funeral turns into a killing field.\n\nMaine Literary Award finalist!\n\nA great review from Bangor Daily News columnist George Smith: http://georgesmithmaine.com/articles/book-reviews/july/2017/another-suspenseful\n\nWhat people are saying about the book:\n\nBest police procedural I’ve read in a long time. Interesting plot, suspense from page one, and characters you’ll care about. This is the first Joe Burgess I’ve read. While I’ll go back and read the earlier books in the series, it wasn’t necessary in order to understand this story. The author gives you just enough but not too much of prior events. If you’re into cop stories, I highly recommend this one.\n\nOne of the best books I’ve read in a lifetime of reading! Truly did not want to put it down.\n\nWell written and a speedy read. Great story with some wonderful characters. And of course some not so wonderful. Couldn’t put this one down, a real page Turner.\n\nWords fail me! I have seldom read such a well written book. Good story line and some great characters.\n\nThe tension and suspense racks high with a smooth flow to the ending.\n\nReally outstanding in the genre. Kate Flora is now a favourite author!\n\nThis was my first Joe Burgess book. I found it drew me into an honorable policeman’s world and kept me glued to it. Here is a good clean book full of dedication to duty, love for family, loyalty to all those who gave their lives to protect and defend others. It’s a fast paced mystery.\n\nIt is so refreshing to read a book about the life of a policeman without the author painting in tons of character flaws in an effort to make their protagonist “human”.\n\nI normally read British detective book, but found this American police procedural engrossing. The characters were well drawn, especially Joe. I rarely leave feedback, but this a was such a pleasure, I wanted to encourage other fellow mystery readers to try it. I am off to buy the other books in this series.\n\nCheck out Kate and Roger here:\n\nIn case you are curious about why Kate’s name is on a Maine Game Warden’s memoir, here’s a couple small samples of what you might hear us say at a book talk:\n\nWLBZ2 – 207 Interview\n\nMPBN Interview\n\nA GOOD MAN WITH A DOG\n\nBy Roger Guay with Kate Clark Flora\n\nA game warden’s journey from the woods of Maine to the swamps of New Orleans.\n\nWhen Roger Guay’s father died in a tragic fishing accident, a kind game warden helped him through the loss. Inspired by this experience, as well as his love of the outdoors, Guay became a game warden and certified K9 handler, beginning a successful career that would span twenty-five years and see him establish canine units as a staple of the game warden service.\n\nGuay takes readers into the patient, watchful world of a warden catching poachers and protecting pristine wilderness, and the sometimes CSI-like reconstruction of deer- and moose-poaching scenes. Guay searches for lost hunters and hikers, estimating that over the years, he has pulled more than two hundred bodies out of Maine’s north woods. His frequent companion is a little brown lab named Reba, who can find discarded weapons, ejected shells, hidden fish, and missing people.\n\nA Good Man with a Dog explores Guay’s life as he and his canine partners are exposed to increasingly terrible events, from tracking down hostile poachers to searching for victims of violent crimes, including a year-long search for the hidden graves of two babies buried by a Massachusetts cult. He witnessed firsthand FEMA’s mismanagement of the post-Katrina cleanup efforts in New Orleans, an experience that left him scarred and disheartened. But he found hope with the support of family and friends, and eventually returned to the woods he knew and loved from the days of his youth.\n\nShortlisted for the Agatha and the Maine Literary Award\n\nPublic Safety Writers Association Finalist\n\nGIRLS’ NIGHT OUT\n\nGetting a six-foot dead man into his SUV wasn’t easy for a small woman in stilettos and a pencil skirt. He flopped like a dead fish and seemed to have more limbs than an octopus. I now understood the true meaning of the term dead weight. But hard or not, I was sending Jay Hanrahan home and without the good time he’d planned on when he’d had the bartender dump that powder into my drink. Even with Georgia and Callie there to help, it was a challenge. We couldn’t just roll him or drag him; we had to use kid gloves. We needed to get him back to his own place intact and unbruised, put him in his jammies, and get him into bed.\n\nAs we levered him into the front and fastened his seat belt, a truly ironic precaution under the circumstances, I thought about the crazy sequence of events that had brought us here. It wasn’t the sort of thing my book group usually did.\n\nDEATH DEALER\n\nWhen Miramichi, New Brunswick resident Maria Tanasichuk’s husband David reports her missing, the local police force is perplexed: they have had a close relationship with the Tanasichuks and know David as a loving and supportive husband, yet his account of Maria’s disappearance contains disturbing inconsistencies. Soon they discover that David has been using drugs heavily and Maria’s efforts to stop him have frayed the marriage. Witnesses report he has been selling Maria’s belongings to support his drug use, has been involved with another woman and has engaged in suspicious, nighttime comings-and-goings. Further disclosures suggest that he played a role not only in Maria’s disappearance, but also in several unsolved murders.\n\nThe fact that they cannot locate Maria’s body — combined with David’s clever, deceptive ways — make it impossible for the Miramichi police to prove their suspicions. As signs that David may in fact be a dangerous killer mount, the police officers tracking him fear, rightly, that at any moment he could unleash his vengeful violence on their families. Only when they look across the border into Maine and enlist the help of the Maine Warden Service and trained cadaver dogs and dedicated handlers are Miramichi’s police officers able to undertake the long and grueling search for the evidence they need: Maria’s body.\n\nJOE BURGESS MYSTERIES\n\nLED ASTRAY\n\nResponding to a “shots fired” call at an abandoned warehouse, Detective Joe Burgess realizes his worst nightmare when he finds one rookie officer shot dead and two other officers–one his lieutenant–gravely wounded.\n\nWith two brother officers near death, Burgess must race the clock to find and arrest the one person angry enough to seek revenge against the Portland police, before the rookie officer’s funeral turns into a killing field.\n\nAND GRANT YOU PEACE\n\nThis 4th book in the Joe Burgess mystery series finds the Maine detective pulled into a case rife with religious tensions after screams for help lead him to a woman and a baby locked in a closet inside a burning mosque. The baby dies. The very young mother survives, but suffers from traumatic muteness. She has no ID, and no one has reported her missing. When the autopsy shows the baby was gravely ill, and needed surgery to survive, Burgess suspects someone was trying to keep mother and baby away from hospitals that might have asked questions.\n\nThe mosque’s Somali Imam claims to have no knowledge of the girl, or of who was responsible for scrawling anti-Muslim graffiti on the mosque’s walls. Burgess learns that the “Iron Angels,” an outlaw motorcycle gang led by William “The Butcher” Flaherty has been harassing the mosque’s members. Then someone tries to steal the baby’s body. Burgess has been hoping to regain a semblance of “normal family life,” but there, too, things are complicated. First, by the threat that his son will be suspended from school. Then by the chilling knowledge that his family is being stalked.\n\nAs Burgess tries to sort out the tangle of a suspicious and uncooperative immigrant community, an outlaw gang, and a mysterious man who may be involved with both, clues lead to another body, a stash of stolen guns and ultimately, a tense confrontation in which the staggering extent of death and destruction that’s been sowed in the name of greed is revealed.\n\nREDEMPTION\n\nBurgess’s hopes for a calm Columbus Day picnic slam up against reality when two boys spot a dead body in the water.\n\nIt’s Reggie the Can Man—a damaged, alcoholic veteran who Burgess has tried to patch back together since they returned from Vietnam. Now, Reggie’s fight for redemption is over.\n\nThen the ME questions Reggie’s accidental drowning, giving Burgess one last chance.\n\nAs Burgess dives deep, he uncovers Reggie’s ex-wife, his scofflaw son, industrial toxins, corrupt businessmen, and that Reggie isn’t the only one in need of redemption.\n\nTHE ANGEL OF KNOWLTON PARK\n\nPortland, Maine, homicide detective Joe Burgess needs a vacation. But there’s a dead child in Knowlton Park.\n\nRolling up on the scene with a canoe on the roof and fishing poles flapping, Burgess finds little Timmy Watts, viciously stabbed, and carefully wrapped in a new blue blanket.\n\nTimmy’s parents are life-long crooks, his brothers deal drugs and his sister turns tricks. The only one who seems to care is Timmy’s hearing-impaired sister, Iris. But she’s keeping her secrets.\n\nThen Iris disappears, and Burgess is battling against time to keep more children from dying.\n\nPLAYING GOD\n\nOn an icy February night, the body of Steven Pleasant, a prominent Portland, Maine physician, grows cold in his parked Mercedes. All signs point to a john killed by a disgruntled hooker: his pants are unzipped, wallet is gone, and the good doctor has a reputation for entertaining girls in his car.\n\nBut the deeper Detective Sergeant Joe Burgess digs, the muddier the case becomes. While juggling hookers, wives, ex-wives, fathers, stepfathers, dealers and doctors, a nurse on Pleasant’s staff suggests another angle—disgruntled patients.\n\nNow, ensconced in the darkness of a sleeping hospital, Burgess comes face-to-face with ghosts from his past and must decide what being a detective really means.\n\n“Dazzling debut police procedural.” ~Publisher’s Weekly Starred Review\n\n“A triumph in the police procedural genre. Highly recommended.” ~Library Journal Starred Review\n\nFINDING AMY\n\nAttractive, intelligent, and responsible, twenty-five-year-old Amy St. Laurent always called to let her family know where she was. A loving daughter, dependable worker, and a generous soul, she won the heart of everyone she met. But one night—and one man devoid of a conscience—would change all that.\n\nOn an October evening in 2001, Amy set out to show a friend from Florida the nightlife of Portland. She played pool. She danced. Then she disappeared. What followed were an investigation and trial that would require the patient diligent of two police agencies, devastate a family, and keep and entire state on edge for months.\n\nThe Thea Kozak Series\n\nCHOSEN FOR DEATH\n\nThe first novel in the Thea Kozak series.\n\nHer little sister is dead, murdered in a picturesque Maine town. The police have no leads. Her heartbroken family wants to put it behind them, but Thea Kozak can’t let it drop. She’s always been a second mother to the child her parents adopted when she was eight. Now there is one last thing Thea can do for her sister: make sure her killer doesn’t go unpunished.\n\nDEATH IN A FUNHOUSE MIRROR\n\nThea Kozak is a young, dynamic businesswoman who is no stranger to success…or death. Having survived her husband’s death, Thea’s world crumbled again when her sister was murdered. Thea found her sister’s killer and is putting the pieces of her life back together. Her days as an amateur detective are over.\n\nOr are they?\n\nHelene Streeter seemed to have it all—she was the perfect wife, a mother, and the consummate professional. But when this paragon of virtue is brutally slaughtered outside her suburban home, friends and family are left with more questions than answers. Thea’s old college roommate begs her to find the killer. Thea agrees to help, if only to comfort her friend. But comfort turns to danger as Thea is drawn into a web of deceit and madness as she unravels the lies that surround the victim.\n\nJust who was Helene Streeter…and what monsters were hidden behind her oh-so-perfect façade?\n\nDEATH AT THE WHEEL\n\n“Thea Kozak is a terrific, in-your-face, stand-up gal…Stephanie Plum and Thea Kozak would have a lot to say to each other.” Janet Evanovich\n\nThea Kozak is smart and funny, a very modern kind of woman who is carving out a career for herself while juggling all the stresses of a working woman’s life. She works too hard. She’s trying to maintain a long-distance relationship with Andre, the devilishly handsome Maine state trooper she met while trying to solve her sister’s murder. She’s trying to win her critical mother’s approval. She’s trying to find time to get to the gym. And things are about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nHome for Easter dinner, Thea’s mother introduces her to Julie Bass, a sweet young widow whose husband died in a horrific accident at the local auto racetrack. Julie is the woman Thea’s mother wants her to be—one who married a suitable man and produced adorable children. Thea’s mother wants Thea to use her own experience of losing a husband to help Julie deal with widowhood. Thea is sympathetic, but she’s also very busy. And she’s reluctant to revive the pain that helping Julie will bring.\n\nAN EDUCATED DEATH\n\nWhen a young student drowns in a campus pond at a prestigious New England boarding school, tough businesswoman Thea Kozak faces what may be her most tragic mystery yet. The death rocks the private school world, and Thea is called in for crisis management and to reevaluate the school’s rather careless procedures for keeping track of students. But when Thea discovers that the young victim was pregnant, cooperation vanishes. Suddenly, no one will talk to her. Undaunted, Thea keeps digging, finding, beneath the school’s genteel veneer, a host of nasty secrets. Suddenly, too many people want her gone so their secrets can be kept, and under one of those rocks she’s overturned, there’s a killer who doesn’t want to be found.\n\n“If a sleep-losing page turner is your thing, keep an eye on Thea. She’s one of the good guys.” Richard Barre\n\n“Kate Flora does what all great writers do: she takes you inside unfamiliar territory and makes you feel right at home.” –Michael Connelly\n\n“Thea Kozak is a terrific, in-your-face, stand-up gal in the moving and compelling story of grown-ups who fail the students in their care. Stephanie Plum and Thea Kozak would have a lot to say to each other.” –Janet Evanovich\n\nDEATH IN PARADISE\n\nWhile on a holiday to attend an educational seminar in Hawaii, Thea Kozak is determined not only to make the conference a success but to take some time to relax from her demanding job and enjoy some sun and the beach. What she hasn’t bargained for is a dead body, none other than the conference chairwoman, dressed like an expensive call girl, and strangled.\n\nAs Thea struggles to keep the conference from descending into chaos, she discovers more motives for the woman’s death than positive aspects of her life—and more suspects than she can handle. Throw in some hostile local cops, the victim’s suspicious husband, and an old family friend who makes Thea’s difficult mother look like a saint, and a fellow snorkeler who definitely wants her dead, Thea’s hopes for rest and quiet are dashed. But with some help from her own team—an observant little girl named Laura, a too-observant pathologist, and her dear friend Jonetta, Thea may come out of this alive.\n\nLIBERTY OR DEATH\n\nThea Kozak believes it’s her job to be the strong one in a crisis. She’s survived her husband’s death and her sister’s brutal murder. She’s gone head to head with bad guys and lived to fight another day. She’s a survivor who has used her courage and strength to help others. But now Thea is looking forward to an oasis of happily ever after with Andre Lemieux, the Maine state trooper she met when her sister was killed.\n\nThe way to their wedding has not been smooth; she hopes the future will be. And then, dressed in her poufy white dress and ready to stand and the altar and commit to the man she loves, she gets some awful news: Andre has been taken hostage by a militant militia group, and they won’t release him unless one of their members is freed from jail. The State of Maine doesn’t want to release him. Even if they did, the man doesn’t want to be released.\n\nShe’s supposed to sit home like a good little bride and wait for law enforcement to bring Andre home, but Thea’s never been good at sitting on her hands. Especially not now, when the man she loves is in danger. Instead, she ties on an apron and goes undercover in the town where she suspects he’s hidden. And finds herself facing the most terrifying and ruthless adversaries of her life.\n\nSTALKING DEATH\n\nThe seventh Thea Kozak mystery finds the crisis counselor traveling to a New Hampshire private school, where a student claims she is being stalked. But Thea soon finds this is no ordinary case: the alleged victim, a basketball player, is physically imposing, with a sharp temper and all the appearance of being able to defend herself if need be; the alleged stalker seems to be a pillar of the community; and the school’s headmaster seems irrationally and suspiciously convinced that the student’s claim is bogus. When Thea uncovers some of the school’s most tightly guarded secrets, she begins to understand that solving this case has the potential to unleash more violent reactions. The Kozak novels are always smart and satisfying, and Thea is a bright, strong-willed, sharp-tongued protagonist who never fails to entertain. –David Pitt, Booklist\n\nDEAD OF WINTER\n\nDead of Winter brings together eight established crime authors in a collection of intriguing, surprise-filled short stories full of buried secrets, back-stabbing and revenge— all set against the chilling backdrop of winter, the cruelest season of all.\n\nAuthor Sarah Shaber brings back historian Simon Shaw in the intriguing Flesh Upon the Mountains, while Kate Flora’s Bone China offers up a deceptively innocent account of a loyal wife.

But are Rachel’s visions of her terrified child something real or the cruel trick of a mother’s heart consumed with love and fear?"
