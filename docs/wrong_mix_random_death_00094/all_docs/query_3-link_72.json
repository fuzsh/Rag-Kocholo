        "text": "Instructions for Authors\n\nNEW for 2024: Poster submissions can be up 2-pages long and must include: a 250-word short abstract, additional content about the work, and references.\n\nAuthors may find it useful to read the Instruction for Reviewers and the Review Form to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info.\n\nAbstracts\n\nAll poster submissions must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with the submission metadata, and it should be included in the PDF version of the submission at the appropriate location.\n\nSubmission Templates\n\nAll poster submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).\n\nHere is an annotated PDF submission example that is formatted using this template with optional line numbers. It also has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.\n\nPage Limits: Poster submissions are limited to a maximum of 2 pages of content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, supplemental material, and references).\n\nMS Word Authors: Please use the interim Word template provided by ACM.\n\nLaTeX Authors:\n\nOverleaf provides a suitable two-column sig conference proceedings template.\n\nOther LaTeX users may alternatively use the ACM Primary template, adding the “sigconf” format option in the documentclassto obtain the 2-column format.\n\nRequirements for Double Anonymous Review Process: At the time of submission all entries should include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, and email address), followed by an abstract, body content, and references. For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information should be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (i.e. one block per author, with four lines for name, institution, address, and email; not more than three columns of blocks). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers.\n\nOther requirements: Include space for authors’ e-mail addresses on separate lines. Even if multiple authors have the same affiliation, grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ‘e-mail alias’ is not acceptable, e.g., {anon1,anon2,anon3}@university.edu or firstname.lastname@college.org. NOTE: Poster submissions may omit the following sections from the standard ACM template: keywords, CCS Concepts. Update in Jan 2024: Because Poster submissions are 2-pages long this year, they should include BOTH the ACM Copyright Block and the ACM Reference Format.\n\nDesk rejects: Submissions that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.\n\nAccessibility: SIGCSE TS 2024 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.\n\nDouble Anonymized Review\n\nAuthors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the submission. The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the submission with an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the submission such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the submission. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the submission to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.\n\nSelf-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].\n\nSubmissions to the poster track are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process. The reviewers are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors.\n\nThe reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. This discussion information can be used by the track chairs in addition to the content of the review in making final acceptance decisions.\n\nThe SIGCSE TS 2024 review process does not have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.\n\nACM Policies\n\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.\n\nORCID ID\n\nACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors (https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID (https://orcid.org/register) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCID ID in advance of submitting your work.\n\nInstructions for Reviewers\n\nReviewing Phase Start Date End Date Reviewing Saturday, 14 October 2023 Sunday, 29 October 2023 Discussion & Recommendations Monday, 30 October 2023 Friday, 3 November 2023\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOverview\n\nSubmission and Review System\n\nDual-Anonymous Review Process\n\nGetting Started Reviewing\n\nPoster Review Guidelines\n\nPoster Review Process Steps\n\nDiscussion\n\nRecalcitrant Reviewers\n\nOverview\n\nPosters provide an opportunity for an informal presentation featuring “give and take” with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is also a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper. Posters should not be previously published (neither as a paper nor as a poster).\n\nPoster submissions will be reviewed using the dual-anonymous review process (see below).\n\nSubmission and Review System\n\nThe review process for SIGCSE TS 2024 will be done using the EasyChair submission system (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sigcsets2024). Reviewers will be invited to join/login into EasyChair, update their profile, and select 3-5 topics that they are most qualified to review. To do so, reviewers select SIGCSE TS 2024 > Conference > My topics from the menu and select at most 5 topics. More topics make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches. Reviewers also identify their Conflicts of Interest by selecting SIGCSE TS 2024 > Conference > My Conflicts.\n\nDual-Anonymous Review Process\n\nAuthors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the submission. The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the submission with an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the submission such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the submission. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the submission to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.\n\nSelf-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].\n\nSubmissions to the Posters track are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process. The reviewers are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors.\n\nThe reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. An Associate Program Chair (APC) will help move the discussion forward. This discussion information can be used by the Track Chairs in addition to the content of the review in making final decisions.\n\nThe SIGCSE TS 2024 review process does not have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.\n\nGetting Started Reviewing\n\nBefore starting your review, you may be asked by the Track Chairs to declare conflicts with any submitting authors. Please do so in a timely manner so we can avoid conflicts during assignment.\n\nAs a Reviewer, we ask that you carefully read each submission assigned to you and write a constructive review that concisely summarizes what you believe the submission to be about. When reviewing a submission, consider:\n\nthe strengths and weaknesses,\n\nthe contribution to an outstanding SIGCSE TS 2024 program and experience for attendees, and\n\nhow it brings new ideas or extends current ideas through replication to the field and to practitioners and researchers of computing education.\n\nPoster Review Guidelines\n\nKeep in mind that posters are meant to be a place to present and receive feedback on work that is in progress. Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.\n\nReviewers will be asked to summarize the work; provide their familiarity with the submission topic; evaluate the contribution, background and relation work, approach and uniqueness, and results and conclusions; provide written comments including strengths and weaknesses of the submissions; and provide an overall evaluation.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you prepare your review in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.\n\nWhile your review text should clearly support your scores and recommendation, please do not include your preference for acceptance or rejection of a submission in the feedback to the authors. Instead, use the provided radio buttons to make a recommendation (the authors will not see this) based on your summary review and provide any details that refer to your recommendation directly in the confidential comments to the APC or Track Chairs. Remember that as a reviewer, you will only see a small portion of the submissions, so one that you recommend for acceptance may be rejected when considering the other reviewer recommendations and the full set of submissions.\n\nPoster Review Process Steps\n\nStep 1: Authors submit Posters\n\nAs indicated in the Instructions for Authors, submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Track Chairs.\n\nStep 2: Reviewers and APCs Submit Topics and Conflicts\n\nReviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize posters for review assignment. Reviewers and APCs enter conflicts. Note that these steps MUST be completed for the Poster Track even if they were already completed for another track. The topics and conflicts do not propagate across tracks.\n\nStep 3: Track Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects\n\nThe Track Chairs will quickly review each poster submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, formatting requirements, or length restrictions. Authors of desk-rejected posters will be notified immediately. The Track Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Track Chairs at posters@sigcse2024.sigcse.org before you write a review. The Track Chairs, in consultation with the Program Chairs, will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Track Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected posters, leaving the decision to the other Track Chair.\n\nStep 4: Track Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs\n\nThe Track Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC for each poster submission. The Track Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Track Chair without a conflict of interest.\n\nStep 5a: Reviewers Review Posters\n\nAssigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Poster Reviewing Guidelines. We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out. Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text. (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)\n\nDue to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, APCs, and Track Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the posters for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.\n\nStep 5b: APCs and Track Chairs Monitor Review Progress\n\nAPCs and Track Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, Track Chairs send email reminders to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs and Track Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.\n\nStep 6: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs\n\nThe discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs are expected to take a leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.\n\nDuring the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Track Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:\n\nRead all the reviews of all posters assigned (and re-read your own reviews).\n\nEngage in a discussion about sources of disagreement.\n\nUse the Poster Reviewing Guidelines to guide your discussions.\n\nBe polite, friendly, and constructive at all times.\n\nBe responsive and react as soon as new information comes in.\n\nRemain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments.\n\nExplicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the poster\n\nStep 7: Track Chairs & Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors\n\nThe Track Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews to ensure clarity and as much consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. APCs are consulted if needed. Poster submissions do not receive meta-reviews in general, but in a small number of cases Track Chairs may write brief meta-reviews to share their interpretation of reviews. The Track Chairs make recommendations to the Program Chairs based on the reviews and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program. The Program Chairs then make final decisions and notify all authors of the decisions about their posters via the submission system.\n\nStep 8: Evaluation\n\nThe Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia. The Track Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe discussion and recommendation period provides the opportunity for the Track Chairs to discuss reviews and feedback so they can provide the best recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs and that the submission is given full consideration in the review process. We ask that Reviewers engage in discussion when prompted by other reviewers, the APC, or the Track Chairs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair. During this period you will be able to revise your review based on the discussion, but you are not required to do so.\n\nThe Track Chairs will make a final recommendation to the Program Chairs from your feedback.\n\nRecalcitrant Reviewers\n\nReviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years."
