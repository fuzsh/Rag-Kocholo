        "text": "The International scientific symposium \"Days of Justinian I\" is an annual interdisciplinary scholarly forum aimed at the presentation of the latest research followed by discussions on various aspects of Byzantine and Medieval Studies before 1500; this includes the treatment and interpretation of cultural, historical and spiritual heritage in contemporary modern Europe. The Symposium is dedicated to Emperor Justinian I with the aim to bring together scholars from around the world to address a broad range of issues related to Byzantium and the European Middle Ages, comprising the exploration of the cultural and historical legacy as an integrative component of the diversities and commonalities of Europe and wider. This year the special thematic strand Ideology will instigate scholarly debate about the different aspects of ideology in Byzantium and in the Medieval Western Europe. Ranging from the general belief of the people about their world, to the particular sets of ideas and notions, the ideology operated at different levels in the Middle Ages, articulating the power and impacting the societies. Various questions will be raised in exploring the ideology as a function of propaganda that legitimized a political order and justified influence. This will encompass ideological framework of imperial action, competition over status and identity, rival ideological claims to the Roman Empire, relationship with nationalism. The Symposium will embrace broader geographical areas and chronological scope, addressing wide range of conceptional issues in examining the ways of which ideology functioned in different political, social, economic, cultural, religious conditions in the Eastern Roman Empire and in Medieval Western Europe, generating specific sets of ideas, values and beliefs that changed with time. Important info: Please note that the Organizing Committee will be closely following the Covid-19 situation and will organize blended sessions with physical presence and online presentations for remote participation for those participants who will be prevented from traveling to Skopje due to the pandemic."
