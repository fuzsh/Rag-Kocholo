        "text": "WEEK 1: Realize Your Potential\n\nThe potential of an average person is like a huge ocean unsailed, a new continent unexplored, a world of possibilities waiting to be released.\n\nBrian Tracy\n\nStanford University claims that the average person only uses about two percent. It is clear that we perform far below what we are capable of. We concoct all kinds of reasons to rationalize and justify our poor performance and lack of success, ignoring the fact that we have the ability to develop far beyond anything we have achieved so far. Here, are three simple steps where you can coach yourself to realize your potentials:\n\n(1) Clarify Your Vision\n\nStart developing a long-term vision of yourself. Envision how you will become in next five years into when you to developed in every important area of your life. What kind of success and recognition would you be enjoying?\n\n(2) Set Goals\n\nOnce you have crafted your vision, start shaping it into specific, actionable goals. Write down at least ten goals you would like to achieve personally and professionally in the area of personal development. From that list, determine the one goal that would make the biggest impact on your life and start working out a schedule, with firm timelines and benchmarks for achieving it. Don’t delay. Start working on your plan immediately and ensure that you have tangible ways to measure your progress toward your goal of self-improvement. Perhaps the measurement is in terms of the number of books you read per month, or even the number of appointments or sales you’ve made because of your increasing skill set.\n\n(3) Develop Winning Habits\n\nWithout question, the habits that you have adopted in the past are largely responsible for your skill set, level of performance, and ultimately the success that you enjoy today. To be all that you can be, you must develop new winning habits.\n\nWEEK 2: Living Out Your Fullest Potential\n\nIf you are tired of living your routine life and hoping for a change, here are some simple tips to help you to live out your fullest potential.\n\n1. Evaluate Your PRIORITY\n\nAsk yourself these 3 simple yet powerful questions:\n\nWhat is most important to you?\n\nWhat makes you happy?\n\nWhat would you do for free?\n\n2. DECIDE to Let go of the things that don’t serve you.\n\nWe feel most energized and alive when we do the things we enjoy most. Take a close look at the things you are doing and for each activity asked yourself,\n\n” Does it energize me? ”\n\n” Does it help me move my priorities forward? ”\n\nThe above questions will help you to decide which activities need to be changed. Nothing will change if you do nothing about them. It may be a painful process for some of you, but this is necessary.\n\n3. Commit to three small action plans at a time\n\nJim Collins says that if you have more than three action plans, then you don’t have any at all. This is because too many of them will drain your attention and eventually paralysed you. So, start small in the with only 3 action plan at first.\n\nIf you want to live out your fullest, you need to plan your life accordingly. Life does not give us what we want; it only gives us what we deserve.\n\nWEEK 3: Get The Result You Want??\n\nInsanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.?\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nWe are in control of our action. And our action will determine the outcome. No action, no result. Limited action, limited results. Massive actions ( in the right way ), massive results.\n\nAsk yourself:?\n\n(1) Are your actions aligned with the results you want??\n\nOften, we wait until the end of the year to decide whether the results are not what we wanted. We have to be honest and ask ourselves, “ Will our actions today lead us to the results we desire tomorrow?”\n\n(2) Are you taking personal responsibility for your life?\n\nLife is a series of choices. Each day you must decide how to invest your precious time and energy. If you want to achieve a specific result, you must take decisive action. You make the decisions, not someone else!\n\nBe the CEO of your own life. Are you clear on the results you want to accomplish and are you taking the necessary actions to get there? If health and being in shape is a core value, does it make sense to order a high-calorie coffee drink at Starbucks every morning and only exercise when you feel motivated? It is one thing to say what you want, but another thing to do it.\n\nWEEK 4: Make It To The End??\n\nOne of my client said this his 2012 goals, “I like to set my goals high because it will get me close to where I need to be. If I tell myself, I am going to contact twenty clients a day, I know I will at least end up with twelve, thirteen—maybe fifteen—contacts a day.”\n\nAt first glance, this approach makes sense. However, there is one MAJOR flaw: the set-it-high-and-come-close approach teaches individuals that they do not need to accomplish what they set their minds to. This is particularly destructive especially when you encounter obstacles. You will be tempted to give up easily because you do not need to accomplish what you have planned to achieve. The set-it-high-and-come-close mentality only works when everything is going well.\n\nHence, it is critical to accomplish what we set out to do. When it comes to achieving both daily and annual goals, I strongly encourage my clients to identify and fully commit to the bare minimum of what is necessary for greatness. Make every effort to become the person who always accomplishes the goals. When you always do what you set out to do, you learn to be the one who always gets it done. This is one of the key success factor - build up the resiliency to endure the race especially when it get tougher, till you reach the finishing line.\n\nWEEK 5: Everything that happens to us starts with a choice.\n\nThe human mind is like the memory in a computer. It simply records whatever it hears, sees, touches, tastes, or smells. When we tell ourselves that we cannot do something, that gets recorded in our mind. Say it enough times and our mind will believe it is true.\n\nChoose the words and phrases you say to yourself carefully.\n\nProgram your mind with thoughts that will help you to be the best you can be, and achieve your full potential. Choose your responses.?We have a choice as to how we react to everything that happens to us. Our life’s journey will not always be smooth sailing. Everyone experiences rough spots from time to time. But we do have a choice as to how we respond to these events in our life. While we cannot control all the things that come our way, we can control the thoughts that shape our attitudes.\n\nWEEK 6: Put your goals into action!\n\n“Find a happy person, and you will find a project,” says Sonja Lyubomirsky, positive psychologist and author of The How of Happiness. We all need something to work toward. Therefore, set a goal that truly excites you and adds meaning to your life. The fun begins when you go after something that is important in your life. Ask yourself these 3 Coaching Questions:\n\n(1) START WITH YOUR IDEAL VISION: What would you love to achieve by the end of the year? Don’t let the obstacles push you off-course and compromise your goal before your journey starts.\n\n(2) LIVE IN YOUR STRETCH ZONE: Does your goal challenge you to develop yourself or make you feel uncomfortable? If not, then this is just another routine task.\n\n(3) TAKE SMALL STEPS: Small steps are the key to building confidence and helping you adjust to the process of change. The Japanese refers to this idea as kaizen, or continuous improvement. Small steps help to avoid all-or-nothing pitfalls and focus on sustainable progress. Even the process of writing a book starts with one word to one page to one chapter. Small steps lead to big results. What is one small step that you need to take today?\n\nWEEK 7: Letting Go\n\nYour existence has many doors, and each serves a purpose that ultimately helps define who you are. Sometimes it is hard to open these doors. Often you would think it just won’t work. It takes patience and perseverance, but you must believe that you already have every key for each door you encounter. Dodinsky\n\nRecently, we had moved to a new place. As usual I was busy throwing away things that were no longer needed. However, my mother-in-laws was busy “rescuing” those things which I had threw away. She felt that somehow we might need them in the far future and it was a waste of money to throw them away. I reasoned with her explaining that it was unnecessary to pack and move them to the new and having to unpack them knowing that we will not use them. We had been moving these unused items from house to house not using them at all. It is time to LET GO.\n\nThis may be painful for many people to simply let go of things that do not help them to move forward but this is a necessary in order for us to experience the new life that is waiting for us. We must learn how to close the doors and open new door of opportunity.\n\nWhat must you let go today?\n\nWhich doors must you closed?\n\nWhich new doors of opportunity is waiting for you to open?\n\nWEEK 8: 10,000 HOURS\n\nDid you know that Michael Jordan was not the best athlete in his family as a kid? It was not until he did not make the Varsity team his sophomore year in high school that he decided to become of the hardest working athletes of his generation. And, as a result, one of the best. People do not like to hear about this. We prefer to think of Michael Jordan as born genius rather than a hard-working guy who create his genius. It is much easier to say successful people are born lucky than to realize that we are more capable than we are.\n\n10,000 hours of deliberate and consistent practice is what the experts believe it takes to make an ordinary person into a professional. It is about 4 hours a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year for 10 years challenging ourselves to develop new skills in a given domain. For those who are committed to doing something great, are you prepared to invest 10,000hours.\n\nWEEK 9: LEARN OPTIMISM\n\nAn experiment was conducted on two dogs. They are both given shocks at random intervals. The difference is that one of them has a lever to stop the shocks while the other one does not has it. The first dog quickly discovers how to stop the shocks and is fine. The other dog eventually gives up and\n\ncurls into a helpless little ball in the corner as the shocks continue.\n\nThis ends the first part of the experiment. In the second part of the experiment, the same dogs are put into a new environment. This time, both dogs can easily avoid the shocks. The healthy dog quickly discovers the trick and is fine. The other dog, EVEN THOUGH IT NOW HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THINGS just gives up and curl into a ball as the shocks continue. This dog has learned helplessness.\n\nThe same can happen to us. After being shocked by life so many times, too often we “learn helplessness” and just give up. We forget that despites of the many unpleasant incidents happening to us, we ALWAYS have the ability to choose a more effective response to whatever challenges we are currently facing.\n\nKNOW THIS: Choosing to curl up in the corner as we helplessly let life shock us again and again is THE quickest way to get depressed.\n\nAsk Yourself: When you face with an unpleasant situation in life, how do you response to it? Is this the most resourceful ways? If not, what would be the best ways to response to the situation so that you will not put yourself in an unfavorable position?\n\nWEEK 1: Realize Your Potential\n\nThe potential of an average person is like a huge ocean unsailed, a new continent unexplored, a world of possibilities waiting to be released.\n\nBrian Tracy\n\nStanford University claims that the average person only uses about two percent.
