        "text": "Championship Air Jordans are part of the Sotheby’s private sale. The sale includes six pairs of Air Jordans, with the expectation the exhibition will collect millions. Overall, Michael Jordan wore them while he was playing for the Chicago Bulls. They were also an important part of his winning days. In them, Jordan participated in winning six crucial games at the end of the century.\n\nChampionship Air Jordans – the Sole-Defining Holy Grail\n\nThe sneakers are the part of the “Dynasty Collection”. The collection includes sneakers from the 1991 to 1998. The auction is private and will take place in Dubai. Overall, the auction starts today. Also, Nike designed all sneakers. According to Sotheby’s, this set represents “the most valuable and significant collection of Air Jordan sneakers ever brought to market”.\n\nHead of streetwear and modern collectables Brahm Wachter described them as “Mona Lisa of the sneaker collecting and sports memorabilia communities”, in a statement. Sneakers are not only an important part of his championship, but also of his style heritage. Jordan sneakers are also one of the largest and most famous sneaker collections that anyone can have.\n\nThe collection is “the sole-defining “holy grail”, according to Brahm Wachter. He is Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectibles. He also said they represent a very important part of NBA history. Also, he said Jordan and Air Jordans had an influence on all pop culture and basketball. Everything started when Nike released their first pair of Air Jodans in collaboration with Michael in 1884.\n\nFirst Sneakers Auction in the Middle East\n\nThis auction is not only the most important sneaker auction, but also the first held in the Middle East. It would be challenging to evaluate the set of Air Jordans’ potential selling price, experts said. But the fact that they are rare, as well as the fact that interest in Jordan’s legacy is high, sales could be high.\n\nThe probability that this will happen can also be found in previous auctions connected to Jordan. In September last, Sotheby’s sold his 1998 NBA Finals Game 1 jersey, from the “Last Dance” season, for $10.1 million. The auction of this jersey reached a record on the market. Also, the jersey is Jordan’s most valuable item ever sold on the market."
