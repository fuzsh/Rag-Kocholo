All back pain has a cause. Professor McGill dedicated 32 years to investigating how the spine works, the mechanisms of pain, and proven ways to eliminate pain and restore pain-free activity.\n\nThe key to pain-free activity is to assess the pain mechanism and employ a matched approach. Some pain sufferers can perform this themselves with guidance from the book Back Mechanic. Others are more challenging and benefit with clinical expertise from highly trained clinicians listed on the McGill Method Master Clinician page. Clinicians can also access Professor McGill’s latest books and videos that guide the assessment together with providing helpful information and rehabilitation approaches for pain-free activity and optimal back performance.\n\n“As a physician myself there is no question in my mind that the McGill method should be the standard of care for all back pained patients” ~ Ryan Clare, MD\n\nTestimonials\n\n“Professor McGill has produced a long history of good science. I use his advice when my athletes come with back pain that inhibits their performance.”\n\nAndreas Ohgren, Trainer and coach of over 60 NHL players and other Olympic champions.\n\n“I tried several traditional medicine approaches that did not help and then another golfer recommended Professor McGill and the Back Mechanic program. I am out of chronic back pain and back on Tour.”\n\nDaniel Berger, PGA Tour\n\nWhen I met with Dr. McGill after suffering a debilitating lower back injury (multiple herniated and bulge discs) I had gone from a two time national champ and silver medalist at IPF worlds to someone who could barely do anything without pain. I was worried that I’d have to retire from powerlifting entirely. Dr. McGill assured me that there was a path back to being pain free. He gave me an assessment and came up with an initial plan to build back my resilience. It was a very long road and there were numerous setbacks, but 7 years later I returned to IPF Worlds as a Masters lifter to win the overall gold medal, accomplishing a life long dream that I previously thought had escaped me.\n\nLayne Norton ~ Gold medalist International Powerlifting Federation, 2022\n\nAs a Master Athlete competing internationally in the Sport of Long Drive Golf, my spine had to be managed strategically over the years.\n\nI’ve invested a lifetime in research on Spine Performance, Longevity and Recovery. I’ve read every book, and been honored to not only teach these researched strategies, but LIVE them as an Internationally ranked athlete in my 60’s. Dr. McGill and the McGill Method is one of my greatest secrets! It simply works!\n\nGOLF WEEK Magazine named Lee “the Legend of sport of Women’s Long Drive”\n\nLee Brandon ~ 3 Time World Long Drive Champion\n\n‘It was a fight’: After battling life-threatening infection, Jeff Overton returns to Tour 5 years later Golf.com\n\nAfter being on the PGA Tour from 2005 to 2017, I had a spine injection intended to help a herniated disc but instead led to a life-threatening infection and emergency surgery. After one failed rehab attempt I reached out to Dr. Stuart McGill, a renowned professor of spine biomechanics, and developed a plan to “shut down golf training for a year” and stabilize the area of his back that caused excruciating pain while bending over. Then I worked with trainer Shane Rye on building golf flexibility and endurance to re-establish my golf game. Jeff played his first PGA Tour start this past week (July 2022)\n\nJeff Overton ~ PGA Golf Professional\n\nAfter 19 seasons in the NHL my body and back benefitted from Back Mechanic and Prof McGill’s approaches. I am back to enjoying life. Adam Oates, 1,079 career assists, over 19 seasons are the 8th most by a player in NHL history.\n\nAdam Oates – NHL Hockey Player\n\nI have been competing in the sport of Olympic Weightlifting for over twenty four years, I had three knee surgeries, multiple back injuries, and took a cocktail of pills for a decade starting in high school in order to compete. Almost ten years ago I learned of BackFitPro and changed the way I operated, eliminated all the pills, eliminated sit-ups and crunches and began rehabilitating myself with a focus on the core and glutes. These changes have resulted in winning championships, representing Team USA and currently having multiple American records in my mid 30s.\n\nDerrick Johnson – President and Founder of The Kings of Weightlifting, Weightlifting Champion, American Record Holder\n\nThe book Back Mechanic completely altered the course of my athletic career, and inherently my life. Mondays are Jiu Jitsu days. Usually, on Monday nights, I would experience crippling post Jiu Jitsu back pain, and often have an incredibly difficult time sleeping. This pain would persist through Wednesday, which is another Jiu Jitsu day, thus leading to Thursday being even more horribly unbearable than Tuesday was. If I needed to do yard work on Saturday, I’d have shooting nerve pain down my leg on Sunday… which is another Jiu Jitsu day, that I would never be healthy enough to attend. The pain is gone. I have reclaimed my training. I’m doing crazier stuff now in BJJ than I’ve ever done.\n\nTrav from Fightsmart.com\n\nWhen I saw Professor McGill, I was feeling frustrated, defeated and burned out after having dealt with numerous rib fractures and little to no guidance or support. Not only did he help me tremendously in understanding proper mechanics and where my weak spots were, but he helped me continue to row pain free and elongate my career. He’s truly a game changer!\n\nTaylor Ritzel, Olympic games Gold Medalist\n\nI am excited to tell you I rode a horse today near Moran, WY. I wish I could truly express my emotions but can’t. I am most grateful for your help, and your book, Back Mechanic. Thank you again for helping me restore my health to as best as can be.\n\nRachel Kemner, Rancher\n\nAfter many years of abusing my spine with aggressive weight lifting, my back pain started to become intolerable. All my attempts to successfully get out of pain were all short lived and futile in the end. As I was running out of options, I contacted Professor McGill. Stu was able to precisely figure out what was causing my pain, and helped me devise a long term strategic plan to stay out of pain and rebuild my training capacity. Truly resting my inner warrior to allow mother nature to do its healing was one of the most difficult things for me to hear, but it was true. Thank you Stu for all your wisdom and guidance.\n\nDavid Laid, Fitness Personality\n\nProfessor McGill is a brilliant clinician. After a disc herniation and a year of pain and sciatica, he identified my issue and explained it in straightforward language. As an opera singer, my back, lungs and core are the keys to my vocal power and stamina. Professor McGill helped me to practice better mechanics both in singing and in life while also creating a training program. He helped get me back onstage, singing and moving freely and painlessly. I’ve recommended ‘Back Mechanic’ to singers, instrumentalists and coaches, too. Grazie, Professor!\n\nLucia Cesaroni, Opera Singer\n\nThe McGill Method has changed my life. I suffered with back pain for so long that I feared it would be a life sentence. I had stopped doing almost all the things that I loved. But Backfitpro gave me the tools and education to build a better version of myself. I’m back to being healthy, happy and pain-free for the first time in 30 years. I share the lessons with all my students. I can’t recommend the McGill Method enough. To me, it has been a miracle.\n\nJohn David Emmett, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt\n\nThanks for your guidance in getting me back to the CrossFit games. The exercises and spine hygiene you provided really were a game changer. I was able to compete 95% pain free which I thought was impossible a few months ago. We finished 5th in the world and I am certain this would not have been possible without your help. Thank you so much for your time and guidance, you really are the “back mechanic”.\n\nChloe Gauvin-David, Cross fit athlete\n\nAfter seeing several back injury experts I was not making any progress for my back injury. Reading “Back Mechanic” by Professor Stuart McGill together with consulting with him I was able to get my pain free athleticism back.\n\nJillian Michaels, Fitness Celebrity\n\nDr. McGill was a beacon of light during a dark and difficult time of my career. I had just suffered my first serious injury and it was debilitating, taking away from my training and causing me constant pain. Dr McGill taught me techniques and principles to follow that I use every day and have improved my injury drastically. To the point now where it is almost non existent. I read his book “back mechanic“ and have since gifted it to several people, knowing how much it helped myself and my mother. I also use the lumbair in my car every time I drive. Stu is a special person with and a great brain and heart and I couldn’t be more grateful for his big help in healing and empowering me.\n\nMickey Gall, MMA athlete\n\nFor a long time I have been searching for an effective program on how to restore my back to a high level performance. I found the “Back Mechanic” and it immediately helped me to create a concrete program of what to do. Shortly after I sought out Professor McGill and he right away created for me a thorough plan of action. He is a top expert in the field and his work is now effectively guiding me to restore my full athleticism so that I once again can dance on a high level without limitations.\n\nDenys Drozdyuk, 3-Time World Ballroom 10-Dance Champion and winner “So you think you can dance – Canada”\n\nI reached out to Professor McGill when I had been injured over a year with daily pain, no answers, and many experiments done on my body at the local hospital that turned into more pain and more questions. I thought my life as an athlete was over forever. With Prof. McGill’s guidance I was helped immediately out of pain and I’ve recovered to the point where I’m now back to squatting and deadlifting well over 600lbs with no pain!\n\nJP Price, Powerlifter and World Record Setter\n\nAfter my back injury, I didn’t think I would ever be able to compete again. But because of Professor McGill and his guidance to rebuild training capacity, I am back. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! ~ C Meredith, Body builder\n\nCylina Meredith – Body builder\n\nAfter a year of dealing with intermittent lower back pain, instability & weakness I made the pilgrimage from Newcastle, UK to Canada to see Dr McGill. The simplicity of the Back Mechanic process and Stu’s no nonsense approach is precisely what I needed. I’m back training, lifting & enjoying life pain free. Forever indebted. Thank you Stu.\n\nChris Williamson – Modern Wisdom Podcast\n\nStuart McGill is one of the most influential people I’ve ever met when it comes to my training. I still use and teach his methods years after learning them. Thanks to his teachings I went from disabling back pain to max effort and still have had zero issues with my back. This is amazing considering the amount of force going through my spine every time I jump. I recommend anyone who has back issues or who’s interested in learning more about the body to check him out. Amazing stuff!\n\nJordan Kilganon – professional basketball dunker\n\nAs a professional alpine ski-racer, and my back took some big knocks. Then I began to suffer from lower back pain when studying to become a psychologist. Sitting for hours at a time my pain increased despite following guidance from highly regarded back specialists in London, England. I was afraid I may need surgery, as had been suggested to me as a possible intervention should things not improve. Thankfully, I was introduced to the “Back Mechanic” by Stuart McGill. Seriously, it’s one of the best things that has happened to me in my life. Game changer, simple as that. Thanks Stuart for back hygiene that works.\n\nJohn Moulder-Brown, Pro Ski racer\n\nBeing an athlete in 3 professional combat sports I have a long injury history but a back injury in 2016 was the worst. I saw many different physiotherapists and chiropractors. I did everything except rest. The minds a powerful tool and although I was in pain I managed to compete and continuously win even though I couldn’t walk upright properly. It wasn’t until my body finally had enough and for the first time I lost a professional fight. I sought out the best in the business Professor Stuart McGill feeling hopeful for the first time in years. Within 3 weeks the amount of pain subsided so much I couldn’t believe it – and I took another fight. I’m excited to make it back with dreams of making the UFC. I’m more than confident that with the help of Dr McGill I’ll make it! Update Dec 2022: Back in the Octogon, won 1st round TKO\n\nPatrick Pitlik, Professional fighter\n\nDr. McGill is single-handedly the reason I am operational today. Stu walked me step by step from a severely herniated T12/L1 and L5/S1 where I could barely walk to literally having zero issues and being able to do more than I could even before the injury. I am now back to being fully operational and living life completely pain free! The best part is this is not a unique story for those that get the chance to work with Dr McGill!\n\nUnited States Special Operator\n\nAbout 6 years ago, my lower back was giving me such severe problems to the point where I wondered if I could still keep working. Then somebody told me about Back Mechanic by Stuart McGill. I read it and incorporated the exercises in that book and it helped me get over my lower back pain.

For 10+ years I was injured and broken from a back injury. This set back my training and put my life on hold. I could not lift do any heavy activity. I thought I was done. After meeting Dr. McGill and applying his approaches I was able to re-build my back and get back to competitive PowerLifting which I was told was impossible. So much for that. I have competed for Team Canada 9 times, set a National Squat Record, A CommonWealth deadlift record and won 2 Worlds Medals (in squat and deadlift).

I was worried that I’d have to retire from powerlifting entirely. Dr. McGill assured me that there was a path back to being pain free. He gave me an assessment and came up with an initial plan to build back my resilience. It was a very long road and there were numerous setbacks, but 7 years later I returned to IPF Worlds as a Masters lifter to win the overall gold medal, accomplishing a life long dream that I previously thought had escaped me.\n\nLee Brandon ~ 3 Time World Long Drive Champion\n\nAs a Master Athlete competing internationally in the Sport of Long Drive Golf, my spine had to be managed strategically over the years.\n\nI’ve invested a lifetime in research on Spine Performance, Longevity and Recovery.

After one failed rehab attempt I reached out to Dr. Stuart McGill, a renowned professor of spine biomechanics, and developed a plan to “shut down golf training for a year” and stabilize the area of his back that caused excruciating pain while bending over. Then I worked with trainer Shane Rye on building golf flexibility and endurance to re-establish my golf game. Jeff played his first PGA Tour start this past week (July 2022)\n\nAdam Oates – NHL Hockey Player\n\nAfter 19 seasons in the NHL my body and back benefitted from Back Mechanic and Prof McGill’s approaches.

Almost ten years ago I learned of BackFitPro and changed the way I operated, eliminated all the pills, eliminated sit-ups and crunches and began rehabilitating myself with a focus on the core and glutes. These changes have resulted in winning championships, representing Team USA and currently having multiple American records in my mid 30s.\n\nTrav from Fightsmart.com\n\nThe book Back Mechanic completely altered the course of my athletic career, and inherently my life. Mondays are Jiu Jitsu days. Usually, on Monday nights, I would experience crippling post Jiu Jitsu back pain, and often have an incredibly difficult time sleeping. This pain would persist through Wednesday, which is another Jiu Jitsu day, thus leading to Thursday being even more horribly unbearable than Tuesday was. If I needed to do yard work on Saturday, I’d have shooting nerve pain down my leg on Sunday… which is another Jiu Jitsu day, that I would never be healthy enough to attend. The pain is gone. I have reclaimed my training. I’m doing crazier stuff now in BJJ than I’ve ever done.\n\nTaylor Ritzel, Olympic games Gold Medalist\n\nWhen I saw Professor McGill, I was feeling frustrated, defeated and burned out after having dealt with numerous rib fractures and little to no guidance or support. Not only did he help me tremendously in understanding proper mechanics and where my weak spots were, but he helped me continue to row pain free and elongate my career. He’s truly a game changer!\n\nRachel Kemner, Rancher\n\nI am excited to tell you I rode a horse today near Moran, WY. I wish I could truly express my emotions but can’t. I am most grateful for your help, and your book, Back Mechanic. Thank you again for helping me restore my health to as best as can be.\n\nDavid Laid, Fitness Personality\n\nAfter many years of abusing my spine with aggressive weight lifting, my back pain started to become intolerable. All my attempts to successfully get out of pain were all short lived and futile in the end. As I was running out of options, I contacted Professor McGill. Stu was able to precisely figure out what was causing my pain, and helped me devise a long term strategic plan to stay out of pain and rebuild my training capacity. Truly resting my inner warrior to allow mother nature to do its healing was one of the most difficult things for me to hear, but it was true. Thank you Stu for all your wisdom and guidance.\n\nLucia Cesaroni, Opera Singer\n\nProfessor McGill is a brilliant clinician. After a disc herniation and a year of pain and sciatica, he identified my issue and explained it in straightforward language. As an opera singer, my back, lungs and core are the keys to my vocal power and stamina. Professor McGill helped me to practice better mechanics both in singing and in life while also creating a training program. He helped get me back onstage, singing and moving freely and painlessly. I’ve recommended ‘Back Mechanic’ to singers, instrumentalists and coaches, too. Grazie, Professor!\n\nJohn David Emmett, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt\n\nThe McGill Method has changed my life. I suffered with back pain for so long that I feared it would be a life sentence. I had stopped doing almost all the things that I loved. But Backfitpro gave me the tools and education to build a better version of myself. I’m back to being healthy, happy and pain-free for the first time in 30 years. I share the lessons with all my students. I can’t recommend the McGill Method enough. To me, it has been a miracle.\n\nChloe Gauvin-David, Cross fit athlete\n\nThanks for your guidance in getting me back to the CrossFit games. The exercises and spine hygiene you provided really were a game changer. I was able to compete 95% pain free which I thought was impossible a few months ago. We finished 5th in the world and I am certain this would not have been possible without your help. Thank you so much for your time and guidance, you really are the “back mechanic”.\n\nJillian Michaels, Fitness Celebrity\n\nAfter seeing several back injury experts I was not making any progress for my back injury. Reading “Back Mechanic” by Professor Stuart McGill together with consulting with him I was able to get my pain free athleticism back.\n\nMickey Gall, MMA athlete\n\nDr. McGill was a beacon of light during a dark and difficult time of my career. I had just suffered my first serious injury and it was debilitating, taking away from my training and causing me constant pain. Dr McGill taught me techniques and principles to follow that I use every day and have improved my injury drastically. To the point now where it is almost non existent. I read his book “back mechanic“ and have since gifted it to several people, knowing how much it helped myself and my mother. I also use the lumbair in my car every time I drive. Stu is a special person with and a great brain and heart and I couldn’t be more grateful for his big help in healing and empowering me.\n\nDenys Drozdyuk, 3-Time World Ballroom 10-Dance Champion and winner “So you think you can dance – Canada”\n\nFor a long time I have been searching for an effective program on how to restore my back to a high level performance.

Shortly after I sought out Professor McGill and he right away created for me a thorough plan of action. He is a top expert in the field and his work is now effectively guiding me to restore my full athleticism so that I once again can dance on a high level without limitations.\n\nJP Price, Powerlifter and World Record Setter\n\nI reached out to Professor McGill when I had been injured over a year with daily pain, no answers, and many experiments done on my body at the local hospital that turned into more pain and more questions. I thought my life as an athlete was over forever. With Prof. McGill’s guidance I was helped immediately out of pain and I’ve recovered to the point where I’m now back to squatting and deadlifting well over 600lbs with no pain!\n\nCylina Meredith – Body builder\n\nAfter my back injury, I didn’t think I would ever be able to compete again.

The simplicity of the Back Mechanic process and Stu’s no nonsense approach is precisely what I needed. I’m back training, lifting & enjoying life pain free. Forever indebted. Thank you Stu.\n\nJordan Kilganon – professional basketball dunker\n\nStuart McGill is one of the most influential people I’ve ever met when it comes to my training. I still use and teach his methods years after learning them. Thanks to his teachings I went from disabling back pain to max effort and still have had zero issues with my back. This is amazing considering the amount of force going through my spine every time I jump. I recommend anyone who has back issues or who’s interested in learning more about the body to check him out. Amazing stuff!\n\nJohn Moulder-Brown, Pro Ski racer\n\nAs a professional alpine ski-racer, and my back took some big knocks. Then I began to suffer from lower back pain when studying to become a psychologist. Sitting for hours at a time my pain increased despite following guidance from highly regarded back specialists in London, England. I was afraid I may need surgery, as had been suggested to me as a possible intervention should things not improve. Thankfully, I was introduced to the “Back Mechanic” by Stuart McGill.
