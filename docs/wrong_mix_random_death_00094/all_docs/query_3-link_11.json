        "text": "About the Program\n\nThe Master of Arts in Holocaust and Genocide Studies (MAHG) at Stockton University, founded in 1998 as the first program of its kind in the country, offers a rigorous interdisciplinary and wide-ranging education on genocide and mass violence. Through face-to-face and online courses taught by internationally renowned faculty, the program prepares its graduates for employment in education, museums, and organizations that aim to stop and prevent mass atrocities. The M.A. in Holocaust & Genocide Studies program’s diverse and growing faculty ---with expertise in history, political science, communication studies, criminal justice, and education --- work to ensure the success of our students. We also host a distinguished senior visiting scholar every year.\n\nMessage from the Director\n\nThe challenges that MAHG faculty and anyone working in this field face are immense. Genocidal violence is currently unfolding in a number of places around the world. The government in Myanmar has been conducting a campaign of destruction against Rohingya Muslims since 2012, which has pushed more than 900,000 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh where they languish, unwanted, in refugee camps. More than 5.6 million people have fled the civil war and mass violence in Syria since 2011, with almost half a million people dead and destruction of unprecedented dimensions. Rohingya Muslim and Syrian refugees count among almost 80 million refugees today; around half of them are under the age of 18.\n\nThe M.A. in Holocaust & Genocide Studies program is designed to help students explore and understand central historical processes in the making of this reality—our world in which the post-Holocaust cry of “never again” has remained an empty slogan, certainly for these tens of millions of refugees. We strive to fill these words with meaning. To this end, we study the Holocaust as an integral part of modern genocide and mass violence—before, during, and after World War II. Students read and learn about European empire building, settler colonialism, and destruction of indigenous societies around the world; the trans-Atlantic slave trade and slavery in the US; the rise of exclusionary nationalism and the nation-state system in the twentieth century, including post-colonial states in the Global South; and the threat of nuclear weapons. And they discuss issues and questions that intersect with the dynamics of genocide, including human-induced environmental destruction, sexual violence, human security, and genocide prevention. Indeed, the program includes the first university-based Genocide Prevention Certificate Program in the world, a 15-credit online program founded by Dr. Elisa von Joeden-Forgey and taught by the best minds in the field. The Certificate can be taken on its own or as part of the MA program. The Certificate program has allowed us to offer the option of completing the entire MA program online.\n\nThe MAHG program emphasizes excellence in scholarship, teaching, and student learning. We are proud of our small classes, our seminars designed to meet student interests and needs, our generous fellowships and scholarships, our partnerships with university programs and organizations across the globe, and the diverse learning experiences we offer, which include internships with institutes throughout the United States and beyond, independent studies, lecture series and workshops at Stockton University, study tours, and research opportunities.\n\nI invite you to contact my office at 609-652-4542 or e-mail Raz.Segal@stockton.edu for further information and with any questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRaz Segal, Ph.D.\n\nDirector, Master of Arts in Holocaust and Genocide Studies (MAHG)\n\nAssociate Professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies\n\nEndowed Professor in the Study of Modern Genocide\n\nSchool of General Studies\n\nStockton University\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe MAHG degree requires the completion of 35 credits and the submission of a master's thesis or capstone project: one 3-credit core courses (Introduction to Holocaust and Genocide Studies), two 1-credit required courses (Introduction to Graduate Studies and Thesis/Capstone Proposal), one 3-credit methods course (Research Methods in Holocaust and Genocide Studies), one or two 3-credit thesis or capstone courses, and eight or seven 3-credit elective courses. All the online courses in the Genocide Prevention Certificate (GPC) program count as MAHG electives and are open to MAHG students. Please refer to the GPC website. The MAHG program accepts up to 9 credits of appropriate graduate study from other colleges and universities as MAHG electives, subject to approval by the MAHG Director.\n\nNote: Students need to maintain a GPA above 3.0 to remain in good standing. Also, only courses with grades of B- or above can be used toward the degree requirements. The MAHG faculty members may consider, in exceptional cases, to allow a course with a grade of C+ to count toward degree requirements. Please also note that the Stockton University course catalogue includes old MAHG courses that are no longer offered on a regular basis. Only the courses listed on this page are offered, as explained below.\n\nAdmissions Criteria\n\nApplication Deadline\n\nWhile graduate admissions selection committees review applications until the start of the semester, by applying prior to the Priority Deadline, you can ensure that your transition to Stockton is as smooth as possible: you will be invited to the New Student Orientation Event, and have access to priority registration which means you may have more options for monthly installments of a payment plan, as well as greater options for class selection.\n\nPriority Deadlines\n\nFall: July 1\n\nSpring: December 1\n\nTo be considered for admission to the Master of Arts in Holocaust & Genocide Studies Program, applicant must submit the following:\n\nClick here to start your application.\n\nIf you are a recent Stockton graduate, check to see if you qualify for the Direct Entry Option.\n\nApplication Fee: $50 (non-refundable), submitted with your online application\n\nGraduate application essay\n\nWriting sample (2,000 - 2,500 words)\n\nThe sample should be an academic or professional paper, preferably related to the study of genocide and mass atrocities. In exceptional cases --- and only upon approval by the MAHG director --- applicants would be permitted to submit an expanded statement of interests, which should include research and professional ideas and plans related to Holocaust and Genocide Studies, broadly defined.\n\nThree current letters of recommendation sent electronically via the Discover Stockton Application\n\nPlease note:\n\nReferences should send recommendation letters in addition to completing the online recommendation form.\n\nLetters of recommendation should include specific information about the academic and/or professional qualifications, experience, and achievements of the applicant in relation to the study of genocide and mass atrocities. At least one of the three letters of recommendation must be from a faculty member in a university or college, and we accept letters from professional supervisors, internships coordinators, etc. Letters from friends will not be accepted.\n\nIf an applicant cannot obtain at least one letter from a faculty member in a university or college, they should contact the MAHG director to discuss and request approval for the submission of another letter instead.\n\nResume\n\nOfficial transcripts from all colleges/universities attended (including Stockton) showing a minimum GPA of 3.0 or higher. Applicants who completed their undergraduate degrees outside the US will need, in addition, credential evaluation of their transcripts and degrees.
