        "text": "(Back to the listing.)\n\nRichard Alba\n\nRichard Alba is distinguished professor of sociology at The Graduate Center, CUNY. He was educated at Columbia University, where he received his doctorate in 1974. Alba’s teaching and research interests include race, ethnicity and immigration and increasingly have taken a comparative focus on North America and Western Europe. He has conducted research in France and Germany with support of the National Science Foundation, Fulbright grants and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the German Marshall Fund, and the Russell Sage Foundation. His research has also been advanced by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. His books include Ethnic Identity: The Transformation of White America (Yale University Press, 1990); Italian Americans: Into the Twilight of Ethnicity (Prentice Hall, 1985); the award-winning Remaking the American Mainstream: Assimilation and Contemporary Immigration (Harvard University Press, 2003), co-written with Victor Nee; The Children of Immigrants at School: A Comparative Look at Integration in the United States and Western Europe (NYU Press, 2013), co-edited with Jennifer Holdaway. His next book, co-authored with Nancy Foner, will be Strangers No More: Immigration and the Challenges of Integration in North America and Western Europe, to be published in 2015 by Princeton University Press. Alba has been elected vice president of the American Sociological Association and president of the Eastern Sociological Society. He has delivered the Nathan Huggins Lectures at Harvard University, which led to the book, Blurring the Color Line: The New Chance for a More Integrated America (Harvard University Press, 2009).\n\nLouis Chauvel\n\nLouis Chauvel is a French sociologist, professor at the University of Luxembourg and winner of the Chair PEARL “Programme Excellence for Award of Research in Luxembourg” on social welfare, income and wealth and social change in a comparative perspective. Honorary member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF) and former professor at Sciences Po Paris (2005-2012), he earned his Ph.D. in U Lille in 1997 and his habilitation at Science Po Paris in 2003. In 2000 he was an invited fellow at Berkeley and was an invited professor at Columbia University in 2011-2012. He is specialized in social inequalities and public policies, social change, social stratification and mobility, advanced methodology of social sciences and population studies, with a special focus on comparative birth cohort dynamics. He has been member of the executive committee of International Sociological Association (ISA) since 2006 (2006-10 & 2010-14), former general secretary of the European Sociological Association (ESA 2005-7), and former treasurer of the French Sociological Association (AFS) (2002-6). He is a member of the ISA research committee on social stratification (RC28) and on classes (RC47) and has been responsible chair of the research network on classes, inequalities, fragmentations of the AFS .\n\nAndrew Clark\n\nAndrew Clark holds a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics. He is currently a CNRS research professor at the Paris School of Economics (PSE), and previously held posts at Dartmouth, Essex, CEPREMAP, DELTA, the OECD and the University of Orléans. His work has largely focused on the interface between psychology, sociology and economics; in particular, using job and life satisfaction scores, and other psychological indices, as proxy measures of utility. One particular research question has been that of relative utility or comparisons (to others like you, to others in the same household, and to yourself in the past), finding evidence of such comparisons with respect to both income and unemployment. Recent work has looked at habituation to unemployment, poverty, marriage, divorce and children using long-run panel data. In addition to his Paris position, he holds research associate positions at the Flinders University, IZA (Bonn), Kingston University and the London School of Economics. He is on the editorial boards of ten journals, and has acted as referee for over 175 different journals across the social sciences.\n\nJordan Conwell\n\nJordan A. Conwell is an assistant professor in the Departments of Sociology and Educational Policy Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is a faculty affiliate of the Center for Demography and Ecology, the Institute for Research on Poverty, the Interdisciplinary Training Program in the Education Sciences, and the Robert M. La Follette School of Public Affairs. His research focuses on racial, social class, and gender inequalities in human development, particularly as these relate to education. One current project in this line of research investigates racial achievement gaps between Black and White children whose parents have similarly low, middle, or high incomes. It draws on multiple national datasets to track these gaps’ development across birth cohorts from the mid-twentieth century to the present as well as within a single cohort of children as they age. His work has been funded by the National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation and has appeared in journals including The Journal of Negro Education and Sociology of Education. He completed a Ph.D. in Sociology at Northwestern University in 2017.\n\nMiles Corak\n\nMiles Corak is Professor of Economics at The Graduate Center. His research focuses on social mobility, inequality, and child rights. His findings documenting that higher inequality is associated with lower economic opportunity have been widely cited, and used by policy-makers worldwide. Top print and electronic media, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Economist, The Guardian, The Washington Post, and the BBC have all used Professor Corak’s research on “The Great Gatsby Curve”, as has The White House. Prior to joining The Graduate Center, Corak was professor of economics at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa Canada, and for many years a member of the senior management at Statistics Canada, Canada’s national statistical agency. He has been a visiting researcher with the UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre in Florence, Italy; the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the University of London; the Office of Population Research at Princeton University; the Russell Sage Foundation; and was a visiting professor with the Department of Economics at Harvard University. During 2017, he served as the-economist-in-residence with the Canadian Federal government, advising on social policy reform and the country’s poverty reduction strategy.\n\nConchita D’Ambrosio\n\nConchita D’Ambrosio is professor of economics at the University of Luxembourg. She is an economist, with a Ph.D. from New York University (2000). Her research interests have revolved around the study of individual and social well-being and the proposal of various measures that are able to capture its different aspects. Two main points were stressed. Individual well-being depends on comparisons with a reference situation; individual well-being depends both on one’s own life course and on the histories of others. Towards this aim, she has proposed a number of different indices, which have been axiomatically characterized. She has applied these to the study of different societies and analyzed their empirical links with subjective well-being, via their correlations with self-reported levels of satisfaction with income and life overall. She has published in Economica, Economics Letters, International Economic Review, Review of Economics and Statistics, Social Choice and Welfare, the Review of Income and Wealth among other academic journals. She has been member of the editorial board of the Review of Income and Wealth since 2001 and managing editor of the same journal since 2007. She joined the editorial board of the Journal of Economic Inequality in 2013.\n\nMichael F. Förster\n\nMichael Förster is a senior policy analyst and economist at the OECD Jobs and Income Division, Paris. He has been working in different departments at the OECD Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs since more than 20 years and, particularly, has been involved in and leading successive OECD work on inequality, income distribution and poverty. He is co-author of Growing Unequal? Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries (OECD, 2008) and lead author of the follow-up studies, Divided we Stand: Why Inequality keeps rising (OECD, 2011) and In It Together – Why Less Inequality Benefits All (OECD, 2015). Those reports analysed the causes of inequality; the impact of the global crisis and subsequent consolidation policies on inequalities; the distributive effects of employment structure changes; and the impact of increasing inequality on growth. The 2018 OECD flagship report A Broken Social Elevator? How to Promote Social Mobility provided new evidence on social mobility in the context of increased inequalities of incomes and opportunities and discusses policy options. The most recent report, Under Pressure: The Squeezed Middle Class highlights the three key challenges for OECD middle-income households, those of unfairness; expensiveness of living costs; and uncertainty of economic prospects. Förster is currently directing several follow-up projects, including work on drivers of wealth concentration. In the past, he has been working with international research institutes, such as the Luxembourg Income Study (1994-1996) and the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research, Vienna (2000-2004). He studied economics at the Universities of Vienna and Saarbrücken and holds a Ph.D. from University of Liège. Förster is a member of the Council of the French Observatory of Poverty and Social Exclusion (ONPES). He is author of various journal articles, research papers and book contributions, recently to the Elsevier Handbook of Income Distribution.\n\nJanet Gornick\n\nJanet Gornick attended Harvard University, where she was awarded a B.A. (psychology and social relations 1980), an M.P.A. (Kennedy School 1987), and a Ph.D. (political economy and government 1994). She is currently professor of political science and sociology at The Graduate Center, CUNY. From September 2006 to August 2016, she served as director of LIS (formerly, the Luxembourg Income Study), a cross‐national data archive and research center located in Luxembourg, with a satellite office at The Graduate Center. As of September 1, 2016, she serves as director of the James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Center on Socio‐Economic Inequality, and as director of the US Office of LIS. Most of her research is comparative and concerns social welfare policies and their impact on gender disparities in the labor market and income inequality. She has published articles on gender inequality, employment, and social policy in several journals. She is co-author or co-editor of three books: Families That Work: Policies for Reconciling Parenthood and Employment (Russell Sage Foundation 2003), Gender Equality: Transforming Family Divisions of Labor (Verso Press 2009), and Income Inequality: Economic Disparities and the Middle Class in Affluent Countries (Stanford University Press 2013). Her research has been supported by many sponsors, including the Russell Sage Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management (APPAM), the Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Governors’ Association (NGA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank.\n\nDarrick Hamilton\n\nDarrick Hamilton is the executive director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at The Ohio State University. In addition, he holds a primary faculty appointment in the John Glenn College of Public Affairs, with courtesy appointments in the departments of economics and sociology in the College of Arts and Sciences. He is a pioneer and internationally recognized scholar in the field of stratification economics, which fuses social science methods to examine the causes, consequences and remedies of racial, gender, ethnic, tribal, nativity, etc. inequality in education, economic and health outcomes. This work involves crafting and implementing innovative routes and policies that break down social hierarchy, empower people, and move society towards greater equity, inclusion, and civic participation. He was born and raised in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, NY, and now resides in the Short North section of Columbus, OH. He is a graduate of Oberlin College and earned a Ph.D. in economics from the University of North Carolina. He is frequently cited in the media, consults with various public official and serves as an advisor to/fellow with several non-profit and think tank organizations.\n\nAlexander Hertel-Fernandez\n\nAlexander Hertel-Fernandez is an assistant professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, where he studies American political economy, with a focus on the politics of business, labor, wealthy donors, and policy. His most recent book, State Capture, examines how networks of conservative activists, donors, and businesses built organizations to successfully reshape public policy across the states and why progressives failed in similar efforts. His previous book, Politics at Work, examines how employers are increasingly recruiting their workers into politics to change elections and policy. His current research focuses on the politics of labor unions, with a focus on the public sector labor movement and worker preferences for new models of labor organization; interest groups, lobbying and legislative representation; the political activities of wealthy Americans; and American political economy. He received his Ph.D. in government and social policy from Harvard University and is currently a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.\n\nNancy Krieger\n\nNancy Krieger is professor of social epidemiology, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of the HSPH Interdisciplinary Concentration on Women, Gender, and Health. She has been a member of the School’s faculty since 1995. She is an internationally recognized social epidemiologist (Ph.D., epidemiology, UC Berkeley, 1989), with a background in biochemistry, philosophy of science, and history of public health, plus 30+ years of activism involving social justice, science, and health. In 2004, she became an ISI highly cited scientist, a group comprising “less than one-half of one percent of all publishing researchers, with her ranking reaffirmed in the 2015 update.” In 2013, she received the Wade Hampton Frost Award from the Epidemiology Section of the American Public Health Association, and in 2015, she was awarded the American Cancer Society Clinical Research Professorship.\n\nKrieger’s work addresses three topics: (1) conceptual frameworks to understand, analyze, and improve the people’s health, including the ecosocial theory of disease distribution she first proposed in 1994 and its focus on embodiment and equity; (2) etiologic research on societal determinants of population health and health inequities; and (3) methodologic research on improving monitoring of health inequities. In April 2011, her book, Epidemiology and the People’s Health: Theory and Context, was published by Oxford University Press. This book presents the argument for why epidemiologic theory matters. Tracing the history and contours of diverse epidemiologic theories of disease distribution from ancient societies on through the development of — and debates within — contemporary epidemiology worldwide, it considers their implications for improving population health and promoting health equity. She is also editor of Embodying Inequality: Epidemiologic Perspectives (Baywood Press, 2004) and co-editor, with Glen Margo, of AIDS: The Politics of Survival (Baywood Publishers, 1994), and, with Elizabeth Fee, of Women’s Health, Politics, and Power: Essays on Sex/Gender, Medicine, and Public Health (Baywood Publishers, 1994). In 1994 she co-founded, and still chairs, the Spirit of 1848 Caucus of the American Public Health Association, which is concerned with the links between social justice and public health.\n\nPaul Krugman\n\nPaul Krugman is a distinguished professor at The Graduate Center, CUNY, a core faculty member at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality, a LIS senior scholar, and an op-ed columnist for The New York Times.
