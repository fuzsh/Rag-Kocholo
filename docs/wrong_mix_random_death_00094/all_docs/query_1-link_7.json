        "text": "This Is Not About Sports. Let's go to the tape. üé• **** This stuff takes me back to my coaching days... What struck me when I took my first walkthrough of Arrowhead was just how many people had specialized responsibilities so that we could execute practices, training camps, home and road games. There's an entire game behind the game that a casual fan never sees. **** I don't watch much hockey, but I've seen enough to know that hockey sticks break. We're talking about thin sheets of wood that propel pucks of dense rubber at tooth-popping speed. The Vegas Golden Knights beat the Florida Panthers 7-2 in a frenetic second game of the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals. Brett Howden scores a goal to give the Golden Knights a 4-0 lead. That goal would have never happened if it wasn't for one man. Enter: JW Aiken, Assistant Equipment Manager, Vegas Golden Knights (I love this guy's name by the way ü§£) I want you to watch the bottom half of the video and pause it at the :02 mark. Do you see how quick J.W. goes for that backup stick? üßê I had to learn more about this guy, so I professionally stalked him on the interwebs. He was hired in 2017 and here's a snippet from the press release: \"Aiken, who officially joined the team on June 22 as the assistant equipment manager, joins the Golden Knights after serving as the head equipment manager for the American Hockey League's Syracuse Crunch for five years. Prior to working with the Crunch, he spent three seasons with the Norfolk Admirals and four seasons with the Providence Bruins. Aiken began his pro career with the Port Huron Beacons of the former United Hockey League.\" **** This guy is the male equivalent of Carmen Sandiego. He's been on planes, trains and automobiles chasing the dream. Here are three lessons from J.W. we can apply to our business: 1) Follow the Puck but See the Game As you can see, there's a swirl of human motion going on around J.W. during this game. But he's got his arms folded and his eyes on the ice. He's not worried about the drunk fan in row 5.üôà He's following the puck while seeing the game. Here's a question for you: What's the puck in your business? A lazy answer is revenue. Revenue is a byproduct of the puck arriving where, when, and how it should. What's your puck? 2) Keep the Most Essential Tools Close Wanna die a quick death? Try to get between J.W. and those sticks. He's not having it. üôÖüèø‚ôÇÔ∏è Identify the 10X tools and keep them close. 3) Circle Back for the Celebration Howden scores at the :20 second mark of this clip and I want you to zero in on the next 15 seconds. Other staffers, players, and even Howden circle back to J.W. and throw him a fist bump. Sometimes we focus so much on strategy that we never pause to celebrate when the damn strategy actually works! Celebrations aren't only for kids and clowns. Your people need to see you celebrate like it's 1999. Stay In The Deep End. #ThisIsNotAboutSports #LinkedInSports"
