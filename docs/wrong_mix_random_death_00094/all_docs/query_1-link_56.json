        "text": "1. Teaching Color Theory // Lauren Whearty // Eric Hibit\n\nLauren Whearty and Eric Hibit are artists, curators, and educators, who both think deeply about the importance of color as a subject in art, society, and in how they teach painting and design courses. Color is a vital component in foundational artistic studies, it also plays an important role in culture, technology, history, science, and more. In this episode Lauren & Eric will discuss the ways they use and think about color in their studios, Eric’s “Color Theory for Dummies” book, book recommendations, and how they each approach color in the classroom.\n\nLauren Whearty is an artist, educator, and curator living and working in Philadelphia, PA. She received her MFA from Ohio State University, and her BFA from Tyler School of Art, Temple University. She has been a Co-Director at Ortega y Gasset Projects, an artist-run curatorial collective and non-profit in Brooklyn, NY since 2017. Lauren has attended residencies such as Yale’s Summer School of Art through the Ellen BattelStoeckel Fellowship, The Vermont Studio Center, Soaring Gardens Artist Retreat, and the Golden Foundation Artist Residency. She has recently received grants from the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation, and Joseph Roberts Foundation. Lauren also received the President’s Creative Research and Innovation Grant from University of the Arts, to develop work for her first solo exhibit which was recently at Gross McCleaf Gallery in Philadelphia. Lauren currently teaches 2D Design, Color, Painting & Drawing courses at University of the Arts and Tyler School of Art & Architecture in Philadelphia.\n\nEric Hibit (born Rochester, NY) is a visual artist based in New York City.

Racism Untaught // Lisa Elzey Mercer // Terresa Moses // Cheryl Miller\n\nIn this episode of CAA Conversations, the authors of Racism Untaught: Revealing and Unlearning Racialized Design–and hosts of the book’s companion podcast—Lisa Elzey Mercer and Terresa Moses, speak with renowned designer Dr. Cheryl D. Miller.\n\nAntiracist design interventions can be difficult. Well-intentioned conversations can fuel tensions, activate racialized trauma, and lead to misunderstandings, especially in spaces not typically focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Even when progress is made, white supremacist culture can resurface. Antiracist guidelines and approaches that lay bare racialized systems of oppression and fundamentally disrupt their replication are critical. This episode of CAA Conversations makes space for a frank discussion around design equity.\n\nIn addition to being an advocate for Black graphic designers, Cheryl D. Miller is also a theologian and author. She is a Cooper Hewitt National Design Awardee and AIGA Medalist and has been inducted into the One Club Hall of Fame.\n\nLisa Elzey Mercer (she/her) is a designer, educator, and researcher, and Associate Professor of Graphic Design and Design for Responsible Innovation at the University of Illinois.\n\nTerresa Moses (she/her) is Assistant Professor of Graphic Design, and the Director of Design Justice at the University of Minnesota, and a PhD candidate in Social Justice Education at the University of Toronto.\n\n3. Professional Practices Pedagogy // Steve Rossi // Lauren Whearty // Emma Wilcox\n\nIn this conversation, Steve Rossi, Assistant Professor and Sculpture Program Head at St. Joseph's University, speaks with Lauren Whearty a co-director of Ortega y Gasset Projects and Emma Wilcox a co-director of Gallery Aferro. As non-profit gallery co-directors and artists with dedicated creative practices themselves, they each have a unique vantage point on the topic of studio art professional practices curriculum. In the first half of the conversation the history and founding of each art space is discussed, along with Emma and Lauren’s organizational roles, followed by a discussion of the nuts and bolts of general professional practices skill sets, a discussion of how failure can be framed as a creative act, as well as various employment opportunities explored along with advice offered to students preparing to enter the visual arts field.\n\nBorn into a family of makers, Steve Rossi developed an intense appreciation and respect for artistic craft and physical labor through growing up around family members making quilts, knitting blankets, repairing houses, and arranging flowers. He received his BFA from Pratt Institute and his MFA from the State University of New York at New Paltz. His work has been exhibited at the Maguire Museum, the John Michael Kohler Art Center, the Jules Collins Smith Museum of Fine Arts, the Wassaic Project, and the public art festival Art in Odd Places among many others. He has participated in artist residencies with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, Vermont Studio Center, and was awarded the Sustainable Arts Foundation fellowship at Gallery Aferro. He is currently an Assistant Professor and Sculpture Program Head at St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia.\n\nLauren Whearty is an artist, educator, and curator living and working in Philadelphia, PA.

Lauren currently teaches 2D Design, Color, Painting & Drawing courses at University of the Arts and Tyler School of Art & Architecture in Philadelphia.\n\nEmma Wilcox is an artist and writer. As a photographer working with view camera and helicopter, she is concerned with environmental justice, land usage, eminent domain, and the role of individual memory in the creation of local history. Emma Wilcox is interested in the various ways that land is marked, be it chemically, visually or textually. Taken primarily within a 5-mile radius of Newark, NJ, her haunting, enigmatic images suggest multiple narratives, hinting at crime, destruction, and violence. Artist and critic Tim Maul writes: “progress” has rendered these landscapes ancient, and Wilcox is both a cartographer and guerrilla, staging interventions embedded within photographs that like maps themselves, never succeed as precise conveyors of “truth”. The images bear no obvious time stamp; they serve as a subjective document and challenge the notion of evidence. Though often dark, both visually and conceptually, the work has an underlying note of resilience and perseverance. She is co-founder, with Evonne M. Davis, of alternative space Gallery Aferro. Over the past two decades, she has worked to develop hundreds of exhibitions, residencies, education programs, public art initiatives, as well as numerous publications. Many of these efforts have been highly collaborative in nature, involving other nonprofits and collectives. She has been interviewed or reviewed in Art in America, Women in Photography, the New Yorker, American Suburb X, Lolife and Black and White magazines, and has written for Bomb magazine and Roxanne Gay's Emerging Writers Essay series amongst other contexts. A current project is writing about the archives of Newark’s ark-builder Kea Tawana.\n\n4.

Learning from Pedagogical Art // Noni Brynjolson // Izabel Galliera // Jessica Santone\n\nIn this roundtable dialogue, three art historians discuss pedagogical approaches in socially engaged art practices as they apply to the teaching of art history, paying critical attention to the ways these strategies intervene on and challenge neoliberal educational norms. How have contemporary artists working in various social and political contexts transformed public and alternative spaces into discursive platforms through which knowledge can be generated, shared, or amplified collectively? And what can we learn about teaching art and art history in the North American system by studying these artists’ approaches? This conversation emerged from a panel at CAA 111th Annual Conference, “Generative Pedagogies in Art and Curatorial Practice.” The project will culminate with the publication of Pedagogical Art in Activist and Curatorial Practices, edited by Noni Brynjolson and Izabel Galliera, forthcoming from Routledge in early 2025.\n\nNoni Brynjolson is an Assistant Professor of Art History at the University of Indianapolis, where she has taught since 2020 after receiving her PhD in Art History from the University of California San Diego.

Peter Hyland // Tyson Lewis // Tamryn McDermott // Studious Drift\n\nIn this podcast episode, Tamryn McDermott engages in a conversation with Tyson Lewis and Peter Hyland, the authors of the book, Studious Drift: Movements and Protocols for a Postdigital Education, which was published earlier this year by the University of Minnesota Press. Lewis and Hyland engage readers in questions such as, “What kind of university is possible when digital tools are hacked for a more experimental future?”\n\nFrom the book jacket: “The global pandemic has underscored contemporary reliance on digital environments. This is particularly true among schools and universities which, in response, shifted much of their instruction online. The virtual classroom opens opportunities to move beyond familiar learning practices toward radical digital possibilities for education.\n\nStudious Drift revives the relationship between studying and the generative space of the studio in service of advancing educational experimentation for a world where digital tools have become a permanent part of education. Drawing on Alfred Jarry’s pataphysics, the “science of imaginary solutions,” this book reveals how the studio is a space-time machine capable of traveling beyond the limits of conventional online learning to redefine education as interdisciplinary, experimental, public study.”\n\nAdditionally, here are a few of the links that were mentioned within the episode.

Asset Framing: Engaging Students in the Art History Classroom\n\nIn this podcast, Christina (Chris) Penn-Goetsch and Celia Stahr discuss how Trabian Shorters’s “asset framing” could be used as a model in the college art history classroom, providing numerous examples throughout their conversation. Asset framing is a narrative model that defines people by their gifts and assets instead of the challenges they may face. Shorters’s model for pedagogy may prove useful for the art history classroom, a space where we create narratives on a regular basis that probably affect our students more than the facts and research that we share. Shorters’s observations, based on the work of psychologist Daniel Kahneman, argues that we internalize what we see as part of a narrative before we even employ the conscious mind. This suggests an even more imperative role for how we study the visual arts.\n\nCelia Stahr, who received a BA and MA from San Francisco State University and a PhD from the University of Iowa, has been teaching art history at the University of San Francisco for 18 years. As an adjunct who was named one of the top professors in Fifteen Noteworthy Art Professors in San Francisco, Celia specializes in modern, contemporary, African, and transnational or “traveling” artists with an emphasis upon issues of gender, race, ethnicity, and class.
