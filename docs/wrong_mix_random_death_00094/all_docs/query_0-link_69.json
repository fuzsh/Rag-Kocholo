        "text": "Whether it was the on-court aggression or the war of words that followed the game, there is one takeaway that we can be assured of and that’s the idea that the Chicago Sky do not like Caitlin Clark. Indeed, one of her former collegiate rivals made that abundantly clear.\n\nChicago Sky’s Angel Reese fined by WNBA\n\nIn our previous report, we covered some of the events of Saturday night’s showdown between the Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky, a game that ended in a narrow 71–70 Fever win. One of those was a heavy foul that was committed by the Sky’s Chennedy Carter. Though it was initially called an away-from-ball foul, it was later upgraded to a flagrant one following a WNBA review. What some may have missed, however, was that the Sky’s own rookie, Angel Reese, could be seen applauding her teammate’s actions, something that led to major backlash on social media.\n\nWhere Carter was concerned, she refused to answer any questions regarding Clark in the postgame press conference. Reese on the other hand, didn’t even attend the media session which according to reports has resulted in a $1,000 fine from the league for failing to complete her media session duties. Further to that, it’s understood that the league also fined the franchise itself an additional $5,000 for not making all players available to the media. On the whole, social media has been alight with debate surrounding the situation and what appears to be a growing trend of on-court abuse aimed at Clark. Even the Fever’s coach, Christie Sides gave her opinion calling the foul on Clark “unacceptable.”"
