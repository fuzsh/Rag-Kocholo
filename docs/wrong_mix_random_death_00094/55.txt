ABC sweep

CBS’ Dan Rather might have been in Belgrade last week, but ABC News and Peter Jennings swept all the major categories in the evening-news race.

ABC’s ”World News Tonight” finished first in total viewers (10.2 million) and the coveted adults 25-54 demographic (3.9 million viewers) – up 9 percent over last week.

”World News Tonight” also won in households (7.6 million), followed by the ”NBC Nightly News” (7.3 million) and the ”CBS Evening News” (6.4 million).

Eerie timing

The History Channel – scheduled to air ”Slaughter at Schools” on May 10 – has changed the date of the broadcast to this Friday at 7 p.m. in light of yesterday’s shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.

Hosted by Mike Wallace, the special looks at the sudden outbreak of school shootings – but won’t include anything about yesterday’s tragedy, according to a History Channel spokeswoman.

Tom foolery

Before he became the twice-divorced butt of late-night jokes – and legendary star of ”The Stupids” – wacky Tom Arnold hosted a public-access cable show.

On today’s ”Real TV” (1:30 p.m. on Ch.11), see Arnold like you’ve never seen him before, toiling away in late-’80s obscurity – while sporting a lei!

Only on ”Real TV”!
