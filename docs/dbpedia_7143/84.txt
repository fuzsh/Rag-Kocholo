Rio Tinto is a multinational mining company based in London, UK, with a history dating back to the 19th century. The company specialises in exploring, extracting, and processing various metals and minerals, such as copper, gold, iron ore, aluminium, diamonds, and industrial minerals.

The company’s operations are organised into four main product groups: aluminium, copper, minerals and iron ore. Each group manages various assets, including mines, processing plants, and supporting infrastructure.

Sustainability and transparency are cited as important aspects of Rio Tinto’s business operations. The company claims to minimise its environmental impact through responsible mining practices, efficient use of resources, and investment in new technologies to reduce emissions and improve waste management. However, the company has been the source of controversy on multiple occasions, from environmental damage to losing a radioactive capsule on a Western Australian highway.

Rio Tinto’s current share price depends on a number of factors, including changes in mineral markets and the global economy.

As of the most recent market close on April 26 2023, the Rio Tinto share price is $111.94. Since the release of the first quarter production results last week, RIO shares have dropped over 9%. The decline is attributed to the falling price of iron ore, which is one of Rio Tinto’s largest revenue sources. Iron ore prices have been experiencing a downturn since mid-March, affecting the profitability of Rio Tinto’s sales.

Investors interested in Rio Tinto shares should keep an eye on company announcements, financial results, and industry trends to stay current. Additionally, it is important to keep an eye on the market prices for commodities like iron ore and copper, as these factors can greatly influence the share price, as has been seen in the past week.

Market analyst at investment company, Conotoxia, Grzegorz Drozdz, adds that Rio Tinto’s share price depends on a number of factors, including changes in mineral markets and the global economy.

“The company has fluctuated around its current price since 2021. In doing so, a high correlation between the company’s shares and market iron prices could be observed,” Drozdz notes.

Yes, Rio Tinto pays dividends to its shareholders. The company has a trailing 12-month (TTM) dividend yield of 6.27% and paid dividends totalling $6.53 per share. The dividends are paid quarterly, providing a steady income stream for investors who hold Rio Tinto shares. In addition to the dividend yield, Rio Tinto has a five-year average price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.25 and a diluted, three-year average earnings per share (EPS) of 18.03%, which further strengthens its position as a good investment option.

It is important to note that Rio Tinto’s TTM dividend payout ratio is 91.30%, which indicates that the company is returning a significant portion of its earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. Investors should be wary of high payout ratios as they can indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough profits into its operations to continue expanding. This may mean the dividend is unsustainable.

However Drozdz adds: “The trend of dividend payments is usually linked to a company’s financial performance and strategy. However, given the cyclical nature of the industry, higher dividends can be expected from the company during periods of strong earnings and cash generation. The average annual dividend increase since 2008 has been 7.1%.”

Rio Tinto’s shares could be undervalued and a good buy to the right investor based on an analysis of Rio Tinto’s financial performance, dividend history, and share price trends. The company has demonstrated consistent revenue growth and solid profit margins. It claims it is committed to sustainability and transparency in its operations, which is an extremely important stance for mining companies to take to protect the environment from their operations.

According to Rio Tinto’s Q1 2023 Operations Review, the company showed improvements in several key areas. Pilbara operations produced 79.3 million tonnes, an 11% increase compared to Q1 2022, with shipments reaching a first-quarter record of 82.5 million tonnes. Aluminium production increased by 7% compared to the same period the previous year, benefiting from the ramp-up of the Kitimat smelter. Additionally, mined copper production remained in line with Q1 2022 results, while titanium dioxide slag production increased by 4%.

Pro Tip

It is worth-looking at the average cost of mining—comparing it to the market price of raw materials—and the cash flow statement to answer the question of whether the company is still able to generate money from its operations

In terms of financial performance, Rio Tinto’s revenue in 2022 stood at $US55.6 billion, with a net income of $US12.4 billion. The company’s share price performance over the past few years has steadily increased, followed by a sharp decline in May 2021. Since then, the stock price has been recovering but remains below its early 2021 levels. Furthermore, the TTM dividend yield of 6.27% and the current P/E ratio of 9.85 is below the 5-year average of 10.25, indicating that Rio Tinto is undervalued compared to the 5-year trend.

Drozdz adds that the company is particularly dependent on the state of the commodities market, which “currently appears to be unattractive in the medium-term during the global economic downturn.”

“Rio Tinto appears to be ideal for dividend and value investors hoping for rising dividends. Before investing, they should read the latest financial statements and the company’s financial position.”

Investing in Rio Tinto shares can be a seamless process by breaking it down into manageable steps. This guide focuses on using share trading platforms, as full-service brokers can handle most of these steps on your behalf.

Step One: Set Up or Access Your Account

After comparing trading platforms and selecting one that meets your investment needs, sign up or log in to your account.

To create a new account, you will likely need to provide:

Two forms of identification.

Details of the bank account you plan to link to your brokerage account.

Your tax file number (TFN).

Personal information (full name, date of birth, etc.)

Creating an account should be free, unless your brokerage charges a subscription fee. You may need to deposit a specific amount upon establishment.

Step Two: Examine Rio Tinto’s Performance

Before investing in any company, including Rio Tinto, assessing the company’s financial health is crucial. This includes its profitability, previous performance, outlook, and operational efficiency.

Start your research by reviewing Rio Tinto’s financial statements, analyst reports, and industry news. Investigate the company’s leadership, stability, and growth strategies. Analyse valuation metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which can help summarise the company’s performance. For companies in the mining industry, it is important to check their stance on environmental protection and operational transparency, as controversy and legal issues related to poorly managed operations can affect a company’s share price down the track.

Step Three: Determine the Right Time to Invest

Timing the market is challenging for all investors. Although Rio Tinto’s share price may show a positive trend, fluctuations can happen anytime. When you trade should depend on your goals, and speaking with a professional is often the best course of action.

Step Four: Decide on Your Investment Amount

After analysing Rio Tinto’s performance and considering market timing, base your investment amount on your goals, experience, and platform requirements.

The minimum investment amount for most trading platforms is around $500. Consider what you can afford to invest, what you can afford to lose, and how long you plan to hold your shares.

Step Five: Buy Your Rio Tinto Shares

Once you’ve determined your investment amount and have enough funds in your brokerage account, place your order for RIO shares. Review your order before purchasing and, once satisfied, complete the transaction.

Step Six: Monitor Your Investment

After acquiring Rio Tinto shares, monitor your investment regularly. Consider subscribing to alerts from relevant financial institutions, filing your holding statements for tax purposes, and reading company updates and annual reports. Track your dividends and maintain a spreadsheet of your investments and associated fees.

After adding Rio Tinto shares to your portfolio, consider diversifying your future investments to reduce risk across multiple asset classes and options within those classes.

Investing directly in Rio Tinto shares may not be suitable for every investor, particularly for those who prefer a more diversified approach to investing. An alternative way to gain exposure to Rio Tinto’s stock without directly purchasing individual shares is by investing in funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold Rio Tinto shares in their portfolios.

Funds and ETFs pool investors’ money to buy a diverse range of stocks, bonds, or other assets, providing a convenient and cost-effective way to achieve diversification in your investment portfolio. By investing in funds or ETFs that include Rio Tinto shares, you can benefit from the company’s performance while spreading your risk across other investments within the fund or ETF.

Several funds and ETFs have exposure to Rio Tinto, either by focusing on the mining industry or by tracking broader indices that include the company. Some examples include the VanEck Australian Resources ETF (MVR) and Vanguard Australian Shares High Yield ETF (VHY). These ETFs invest in a range of stocks, including Rio Tinto, offering investors the opportunity to gain exposure to the company’s performance alongside other companies.

Based on an analysis of Rio Tinto’s financial performance, dividend history, share price trends, and recent Q1 2023 operational highlights, Rio Tinto’s shares could be considered undervalued and could present an opportunity for some investors. The company has demonstrated strong growth in key areas, such as iron ore and aluminium production while maintaining a healthy dividend yield and solid financial performance.

The outlook for Rio Tinto appears positive, with the company continuing to invest in expanding its mining operations and focusing on sustainable practices. Rio Tinto’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and its ongoing sustainability initiatives positions the company well in the increasingly environmentally-conscious global market.

As Drozdz notes, the outlook for Rio Tinto is dependent on the state of the commodities market, which is currently considered unattractive in the medium term due to the global economic downturn.

However, he adds that the company is making steady progress and has achieved its highest ever first-quarter shipments in the Pilbara iron ore mine.

“Rio Tinto is also focused on disciplined growth in materials needed for the energy transition, and has made progress on several projects, such as the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine in Mongolia and the Rincon lithium project in Argentina. The company has a clear long-term pathway to profitable growth and attractive shareholder returns, and is considered ideal for dividend and value investors.”
