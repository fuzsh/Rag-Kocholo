Today, Robe River produces approximately 65 million tons per annum of iron ore, which is railed to the port of Cape Lambert where lump and fines product is shipped to steel producers, primarily throughout Asia.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility\n\nSince 2013 we have partnered with Scitech to support the delivery of a robotics education program within Pilbara primary schools. We also support various other organisations such as Cancer Council WA, West Australian Ballet and the Royal Flying Doctors Service."
