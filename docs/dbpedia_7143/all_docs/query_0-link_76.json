        "text": "About Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration Limited\n\nRio Tinto's objective is to maximise total shareholder return by sustainably finding, developing, mining and processing natural resources.\n\nIn 2001, a small team within Rio Tinto was tasked with project managing new exploratory work in South East Guinea (West Africa). The Simandou iron ore mining project is located in the Guinée Forrestière and Haute Guinée regions and has now become a multi-million dollar project that includes the building of highways, railroads and a deep water port – even before the full mining operation commences.\n\nSince the commencement of the initial feasibility study, Eclipse has worked closely with Rio Tinto, providing solutions to manage the procurement, financial and management accounting/reporting processes which are able to support the changing requirements of this rapidly expanding and developing exploration and mining venture.\n\nFor more information on the solutions and services Eclipse are able to provide to mining and exploration companies, please contact us on +44 (0)203 866 8800, or register your interest here and we will call you back."
