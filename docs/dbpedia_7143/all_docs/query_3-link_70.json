        "text": "The materials we produce are essential for the energy transition and a sustainable, greener future.\n\nAs pioneers in the field of mining, we produce materials that are essential for modern society. Aluminium for lightweight cars. Copper to help things work more efficiently – from renewables to the power in your home. Iron ore for the steel in our electricity infrastructure. Lithium for electric vehicles and battery storage. And many of the materials we provide are used to make the things in everyday life too: like borates that help crops grow and titanium for paint.\n\nWe work in 35 countries around the world – in mines, smelters and refineries, as well as in sales offices, data centres, research and development laboratories and with artificial intelligence. Our geologists explore the Earth’s wildest terrain. Our wildlife specialists work to protect and conserve grizzly bears in Canada and migratory shorebirds in Western Australia. Our marketing teams make sure our essential materials meet the specific needs of customers around the world. And we are home to one of the world’s largest robots and maybe one of the smallest – we call him Mark.\n\nThe transition to a low carbon world offers a unique opportunity for us to grow, and to play an important role in tackling this global challenge. We know we have a major carbon footprint, significant scope 1 and 2 emissions and material indirect scope 3 emissions. We must switch to renewables at scale, electrify everything we can electrify, work across our entire value chain and accelerate the development of new technology.\n\nWe were founded in 1873, on the banks of the Rio Tinto river in Andalusia, Spain. We are proud of everything we have achieved. At Rio Tinto, we know our future is even brighter than our past.\n\nThe values we champion – care, courage and curiosity – shape the way we do business and treat each other.\n\nCare: for people, for the communities in which we operate and for our environment\n\nWe act with care by prioritising the physical and emotional safety and wellbeing of those around us. We respect others, build trusting relationships and consider the impact of our actions. We look for ways to contribute to a better future for our people, communities and the planet.\n\nCourage: to try new things, speak up and do what is right\n\nWe act with courage by showing integrity, speaking up when something is not right and taking decisive action when needed. We are not afraid to try new things. We respond positively in difficult situations and demonstrate commitment to achieving shared goals.\n\nCuriosity: to collaborate, learn and innovate\n\nWe act with curiosity by inviting diverse ideas and collaborating to achieve more together than can be done alone. We are continuously learning, creatively looking for better and safer ways of doing things. We draw inspiration from others and the world around us.\n\nBusiness strategy\n\nOur portfolio includes iron ore, copper, aluminium, lithium and other materials needed for everyday life, and for the world to cut carbon emissions to net zero. We have been mining for 150 years, and we continue to build on a history and knowledge that span generations and continents.\n\nClimate change is at the heart of our business strategy. In 2021, we set new goals for our business strategy, which include three areas:\n\naccelerating decarbonisation, the transition to renewable energy sources, electrification of processing and use of electric rolling stock;\n\nprioritising capital for the growth and development of products that are essential to achieving net-zero emissions and striving to achieve further growth in the production of copper, battery materials and high-quality iron ore;\n\nincreasing investment in research and development to accelerate the development of products that will enable our customers to decarbonise faster.\n\nTo achieve this, we will work closely with governments, customers, communities, universities, and other partners.\n\nOur business in Serbia\n\nRio Sava Exploration d.o.o.\n\nIn 2001, the Rio Tinto Group established the company Rio Sava Exploration d.o.o., a subsidiary company founded and incorporated in Serbia to conduct geological exploration activities. As soon as December 2004, a new mineral, rich in lithium and boron, was found in the Jadar River Valley near Loznica, in Western Serbia, as a result of geological research. The discovery of this unique mineral is credited to a team of domestic and foreign geologists, which in 2006 led to the registration of a completely new mineral called jadarite, which was named after the valley of the river in which it was found. Currently, Serbia is the only place in the world where jadarite has been found, and since its discovery until now, Rio Sava Exploration d.o.o. has been a company in charge of the development of the Project in Serbia. For more information about the Jadar Project, please visit the About the Project page.\n\nRio Tinto Exploration Dunav d.o.o.\n\nIn April 2018, the Rio Tinto Group founded Rio Tinto Exploration Dunav d.o.o., the company established to conduct mineral exploration. The previously registered company Rio Sava Exploration deals exclusively with the development of the Jadar deposit.\n\nCurrently, Rio Tinto Exploration Dunav d.o.o. does not have permits for mineral exploration in Serbia, and accordingly we do not conduct activities in the field. However, we are considering all potential opportunities for copper exploration surveys both in Serbia and in the wider region.\n\nRio Tinto is also a non-operating partner with Zijin Mining in mineral exploration activities in certain areas in Eastern Serbia.\n\nIf you would like additional information about the activities of Rio Tinto Exploration Dunav d.o.o., please contact us by e-mail, or send us an inquiry by mail to the following address.\n\nAddress:\n\nRio Tinto Exploration Dunav d.o.o.\n\nBulevar Milutina Milankovića 1i, 5th floor\n\n11070 Novi Beograd\n\nE-mail: [email protected], [email protected]\n\nHuman rights\n\nOur commitment to human rights is core to our values. It is fundamentally about treating people with dignity and respect – our employees and contractors, workers in our value chain, communities where we live and work and others affected by our activities and business relationships. We believe respect for human rights starts with our everyday actions.\n\nRespecting human rights relies on good governance, knowing our potential impacts, empowering and enabling our people, and working with others to help avoid adverse human rights impacts from occurring in the first place.\n\nWe take our commitment to human rights seriously – from governance of our human rights approach, which is overseen by the Board Sustainability Committee, to processes like pre-screening suppliers and providing human rights training to key employees.\n\nOur approach to respecting human rights\n\nWe know we can affect human rights everywhere we work and beyond our operations. We also know that what we do in one location may affect people’s trust in how we will respect human rights elsewhere.\n\nWe are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights and implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n\nWe voluntarily uphold a range of other international standards including the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD Guidelines), the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), the International Finance Corporation’s Environmental and Social Performance Standards, the International Council on Mining and Metals Mining Principles and the UN Global Compact’s 10 Principles.\n\nConsistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we are committed to acknowledging and respecting Indigenous peoples’ connections to lands and waters and strengthening the application of the principles of Free, Prior and Informed Consent of affected Indigenous communities in line with the International Council on Mining and Metals Position Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining.\n\nAt a minimum, we comply with national laws, applying our own standards when they are more rigorous. When national laws conflict with our standards, we look for ways to encourage the adoption of international standards, including through multi-stakeholder dialogue. We may also reconsider whether we can operate in such locations.\n\nWe recognise the importance of acting on any involvement we might have in human rights harm through our business relationships, consistent with the UNGPs. We look for ways to work with our business partners to advance respect for human rights in line with international standards and our values. At our non-managed operations, this may include sharing best practice on complaints handling, discussing human rights issues at joint management meetings and making our experts available to support the capacity of operational employees."
