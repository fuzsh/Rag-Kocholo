        "text": "LONDON â€” The state-owned Chinese aluminum company Chinalco agreed to invest $19.5 billion in the mining giant Rio Tinto on Thursday, a deal that would help guarantee its access to raw materials but was also likely to set off opposition from politicians and other shareholders worried about China's growing influence over the global supply of resources.\n\nUnder the deal, the biggest foreign investment ever by a Chinese company, Aluminum Corp. of China - as Chinalco is formally known - will buy $7.2billion worth of bonds convertible into Rio stock and pay $12.3 billion in cash for stakes in Rio's aluminum, iron-ore and copper assets in the United States, Australia and Chile.\n\nChinalco would own 18 percent of Rio if the bonds were converted, and the transaction, which is subject to the approval of regulators in five countries, is likely to draw criticism.\n\nFor Rio, which has headquarters in Britain and executive offices in Melbourne, Australia, the deal provides a much-needed cash injection as it seeks to reduce $39 billion in debt amassed through its 2007 purchase of the Canadian aluminum maker Alcan. The company pledged to reduce debt by $10billion this year, but efforts were made more difficult by sagging profits and lower raw-material prices.\n\n\"This is all part of the recycling of financial reserves around the world,\" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, co-founder of Seven Investment Management in London.\n\nSome analysts have criticized Rio's willingness to allow Chinalco to raise its existing stake, saying it would limit Rio's flexibility in the future and upset some shareholders, whose investments suffered as Rio's stock plummeted 64 percent over the past 12 months. Rio's shares dropped 1.8 percent in London on Thursday morning.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
