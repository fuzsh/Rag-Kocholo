        "text": "Climate Policy Engagement Overview: Rio Tinto is strategically engaged on climate policy and displays a mix of positive and negative positions. The company communicates positive top-line positions on climate change and supports Australiaâs 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target, yet appears to display negative engagement with other specific climate-related regulations in Australia in 2022-23. Rio Tinto likewise adopts mixed support for the energy transition, supporting an increase in renewables while appearing to advocate a continued role for coal in the energy mix.\n\nTop-Line Messaging on Climate Policy: Rio Tinto expresses mostly positive top-line positions on climate change. In its 2022 Climate Change Report, published in February 2023, the company supported limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5Â°C and backed the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Rio Tinto also issued support for the goals of the Paris Agreement in its 2022 Industry Association Disclosure, published in February 2023.\n\nBetween 2019-2023 Rio Tinto has regularly disclosed its support for a market-based price on carbon. In its 2022 Climate Change Report, Rio Tinto supported the implementation of a market-based price on carbon in Australia to achieve emissions reductions âat least costâ, although its position appears to focus on measures to protect the competitiveness of emissions-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) industries.\n\nEngagement with Climate-Related Regulations: Rio Tinto appears to display both positive and negative positions on climate-related regulations in 2022-23, supporting greenhouse gas emissions targets while at the same time negatively engaging with other climate-related policies in Australia. As reported in a July 2022 Sydney Morning Herald article, Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm supported Australiaâs greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030. Additionally, as reported in an August 2022 Australian Financial Review article, Rio Tinto Australia CEO, Kellie Parker, likewise articulated support for the target, stating that it is âalignedâ with Rio Tintoâs strategy.\n\nIn contrast to this positive advocacy, Rio Tinto appears to have negatively engaged with Australiaâs Safeguard Mechanism Reforms in 2022-23. In September 2022 and February 2023 consultation submissions, Rio Tinto appeared to advocate for a number of provisions which risk weakening the climate ambition of the policy, including advocating for strategic metals and minerals industries to qualify for a slower baseline decline rate of 2% and appearing to not support the requirement for new facilities to adopt international best practice baseline decline rates.\n\nPositioning on Energy Transition: Rio Tinto demonstrates support for a continued role for coal and an increase in renewables in its communications on the energy transition. As reported in an August 2022 Australian Financial Review article, Rio Tinto Australia CEO Kellie Parker appeared to support the continued role of the Gladstone coal-fired power station in the Queensland energy transition beyond 2030, without referencing the need for the deployment of carbon capture and storage, stating that \"Our view is that Gladstone (coal-fired) Power Station can play a role in the energy transition in Queensland beyond 2030\". Additionally, as reported in a January 2023 AP News article, Stausholm appeared to emphasize the challenges associated with the energy transition to support a slower transition of the energy mix, stating that âItâs not that easy to get green energy at scale. We are fooling ourselves on the timeline â it is going to take timeâ.\n\nIn contrast to this advocacy, Rio Tinto also appears supportive of an increased rollout of renewables. As reported in a May 2022 Australian Financial Review article, Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm supported the steep ramp up of renewable energy in the Australian energy mix and the phase out of fossil fuels, stating that âAustralia is not building renewable energy fast enough to remove coal-fired powerâ. Stausholm likewise issued support for the decarbonization of the steel industry in a December 2022 Nikkei Asia article.\n\nIndustry Association Governance: Rio Tinto has published annual industry association reviews since 2018. In its 2023 review, Rio Tinto identified misalignment with the National Mining Association and highlighted partial alignment with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. InfluenceMapâs analysis indicates that these industry associations continue to be highly oppositional to climate policy. Although Rio Tinto terminated its membership with the Queensland Resources Council in April 2022, it retains memberships to other industry associations that continue to oppose ambitious policy action on climate change, including Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, Minerals Council South Africa, and the Business Council of Australia.\n\nInfluenceMap collects and assesses evidence of corporate climate policy engagement on a weekly basis, depending on the availability of information from each specific data source (for more information see our methodology). While this analysis flows through to the companyâs scores each week, the summary above is updated periodically. This summary was last updated in Q4 2023.\n\nA detailed assessment of the company's corporate review on climate policy engagement can be found on InfluenceMap's CA100+ Investor Hub here.\n\nHow to Read our Relationship Score Map\n\nIn this section, we depict graphically the relationships the corporation has with trade associations, federations, advocacy groups and other third parties who may be acting on their behalf to influence climate change policy. Each of the columns above represents one relationship the corporation appears to have with such a third party. In these columns, the top, dark section represents the strength of the relationship the corporation has with the influencer. For example if a corporation's senior executive also held a key role in the trade association, we would deem this to be a strong relationship and it would be on the far left of the chart above, with the weaker ones to the right. Click on these grey shaded upper sections for details of these relationships. The middle section contains a link to the organization score details of the influencer concerned, so you can see the details of its climate change policy influence. Click on the middle sections for for details of the trade associations. The lower section contains the organization score of that influencer, the lower the more negatively it is influencing climate policy."
