        "text": "In whose interest are the weakening of the UK listings rules announced this morning by the Financial Conduct Authority serving? In the Executive Summary there is some acknowledgement '...that not all parts of the market will agree with certain features of the final rules for commercial companies...' A mild understatement of the opposition from the part of the market serving the long-term interests of many millions of pension fund members. I note the well coordinated lobby for weakening rules and releasing checks on excessive executive pay have already bagged these changes and are this morning advocating for further weakening of hard won protections by other market regulatory bodies. The International Corporate Governance Network and Jen Sisson has been an important voice alongside Railpen and Caroline Escott advocating on behalf of many pension funds for a much more engaged dialogue with pension funds about how we can constructively address the concerns that are presented as the reasons for these weakened rule changes. If you are a UK Pension Fund/Asset Owner I would strongly suggest considering joining the UK Asset Owner Council Corporate Governance Group and speaking to Caroline Escott of Railpen. Caroline and Railpen have been principled and diligent advocates for well thought through reforms that do not seed the next market crisis. https://lnkd.in/dMvAFmjG\n\nHow many mines do we need to meet global demand for critical #energy #transition #minerals and how can we ensure at the very least that these #mines operate to the best global social and environmental performance standards? In turn what role does finance/investors, the value chain together with governments need to play to ensure that mineral rich developing and emerging economies have the investment and #infrastructure to genuinely and fairly gain from greater in-country value generation. I would venture that in these two questions is the opportunity for the United Nations Secretary General's Advisory Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals that just concluded two days of meeting in the UN offices in Copenhagen. At the conclusion the Panel were joined by UN Secretary General António Guterres and UN Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed and provided feedback on our progress. On behalf of the Principles for Responsible Investment and also as Chair of the Global #Investor Commission on Mining 2030 I suggested this opportunity to shape the nature of the mines we need be that for #copper, #lithium or other minerals would need investors and the wider finance sector to work closely with governments both to drive #standards through value chains, across the finance sector but also by creating the investment vehicles alongside companies for the necessary investment - be that blended or other - for infrastructure in mineral rich countries. The Secretary General was clear we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past with a systematic exploitation of developing countries reduced to the production of basic raw materials. That we had to be guided by protecting human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples as well as ensuring we protect the environment. Personally, if the Panel is to have real impact we need to see how it can shape the opportunity and benefit for mineral rich countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo or Zambia amongst others. There was considerable expertise around the table and I am confident of the task at hand. It is though essential we do not only consider what is in front of us, in terms of the mines that need to be expanded, or built to meet demand, but how we also level up existing mines to those global best practice social and environmental performance standards as well as address the major anchor on mining's social license and trust deficit - the legacy facilities that exist (some of which may have potential to be reprocessed to extract minerals given the development of technology since they were first mined). One area that we also need to acknowledge and I was able to advance was the relationship between minerals and #conflict and it was notable that at the same time that we met so was the UN Security Council considering this very issue. The Advisory Panel is also keen for feedback and running a consultation: https://lnkd.in/dg_MEY4x\n\nOn the day the UN Security Council received an expert report on the escalating conflict in eastern DRC and the involvement of Rwandan troops, the U.S. Department of State issued a strong statement of concern related to the flow of critical #minerals from eastern DRC into neighbouring countries and into global supply chains for #tech, #autos and various other #industries. It also warns of the financing of the conflict from these minerals. #DRC is the world's leading producer of Tantalum which the US and others define as a critical mineral. I had the opportunity to visit Goma in May, during which the mine producing 30% of the world's output just to the west of Goma was taken by the Rwandan backed M23 rebels. The US Department of State statement is critical of the 'flawed industry-led traceability initiatives in the region' and focusses on advising the private sector of the risks to supply chains. It is worth noting that this is carefully worded to note '...the United States government recognizes that some industrially-mined and artisanally-mined gold, tin, and tantalum from the region may meet standards applied by various due diligence frameworks.' As a result the US calls for 'More refiners, processors, smelters and end user companies could enhance their due diligence work and invest in upstream efforts to ensure U.S. and other midstream and downstream companies are not sourcing minerals that finance conflict or contribute to human and labor rights abuses, whether directly from the region, including neighboring countries, or from smelters or refineries in countries that continue to accept such conflict-affected minerals.' There is reference to the OECD - OCDE Guidance which: '...suggests that the private sector go beyond purely “desk-based” due diligence and supply chain mapping, avoid disengaging from the region, and instead undertake heightened due diligence and active roles with onsite investigations (including in trading and refining hubs), continuous vetting, review of grievance mechanisms, remediation, and reporting performance.' This is an important distinction and calls on us all to lean in. Ultimately, we need to see de-escalation between governments and their proxies as well efforts towards peace. I know there are brave members of the local Churches in Goma working together in support of that objective. https://lnkd.in/etG7iKqZ\n\nAs two days of meetings begin at the UN City buildings in Copenhagen of the United Nations Secretary General's Advisory Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals it is quite clear there is no global climate transition without minerals and mining. Whether its copper for electrification or minerals for batteries... But how these minerals are extracted and whether mineral rich countries and their people, especially those from developing and emerging economies, properly benefit is key to the just energy transition. And when we talk of mining it is both large scale mining and artisanal and small scale mining. Key will be if in decades to come will we be able look back and see this moment as the catalyst for a positive legacy having created a real tangible lasting sustainable economic benefit for communities of mineral rich countries or if it will be a legacy of negative social and environmental impacts. I am quite clear it can be the positive - but it will come in partnerships between governments, industry, investors and other key stakeholders. As the investor representative of the Principles for Responsible Investment on the Secretary General's Advisory Panel, I am keen to ensure that the role of investors and the wider finance sector is recognised and positioned to ensure we play our part. Fresh from two days of deliberations last week of the Global Investor Commission on Mining 2030 and the inputs of colleagues across PRI, especially, Rebecca Chapman Rémi Fernandez and Nathan Fabian as well as inputs from Rory Sullivan and Gemma James I am looking forward to where we will be able to land. The Panel has an ambitious timeline to report to the Secretary General by mid September. As part of the process I hope that following these two days we will be able, through the PRI and the Global Investor Commission, to engage with the wider investor community on the emerging direction of the Panel. #mining #criticalminerals #extraction #miningcompanies\n\nAt the beginning of two very full days of deliberations in London of the Global Investor Commission on Mining 2030. Absolutely brilliant for the mult-stakeholder Commissioners to be meeting in person for the first time. Very grateful to our host Commission member Ninety One George Cheveley as well as Chronos Sustainability for the work leading up to today. This has also been informed by our Commission Advisory Group and the outputs will be part of the Commissions engagement with the Commission Investor Supporter Group. This group now comprises investors with over $15 trillion in assets under management. As Chair of the Commission I set out the timeline for the outputs of our work: First conclusions will be presented to the Principles for Responsible Investment #PRIinPerson annual member conference in Toronto in October. The Commission will then be engaging on the emerging action plan at the Investing in African Mining Indaba in February 2025. Following this the Commission will be presenting its conclusions by the time of the 2025 OECD - OCDE Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains in May 2025. The final investor agenda will be presented to the PRI In Person member annual member conference in Brazil in 2025. In parallel to the work of the Commission we will also be facilitating together with PRI an investor input into the UN Secretary General’s Advisory Group on Critical Transition Minerals. #mining #criticalminerals #responsibleinvestors #investors #RI #sustainability #climatechange\n\nWhen developing our fund's approach to climate change (now led by Laura Hillis) a key issue was to have credible frameworks and investor focussed tools to inform our decision-making. Together with peer Asset Owners we proceeded to make three interventions: First, to establish Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) to have an independent tool to cut through the growing corporate disclosures and to bring academic rigor and insight to corporate engagement on what credible transition looks like. Together with Environment Agency Pension Fund (then led by Emma Howard Boyd CBE & Faith Ward as RI lead) and Rory Sullivan we set up TPI with supporting funds including USS, Swedish AP funds, Railpen & Wespath. Today $60 trillion AUM support TPI, increasing billions are being allocated to indices using TPI data, a dedicated TPI Climate Transition Centre at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change & the Environment has been established with an enduring partnership with LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) and a Board now chaired by David Russell. Second, to create a framework - the Net Zero Investment Framework (NZIF), that could enable a fund like ours to make credible and comparable net zero commitments. We approached the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) to establish the Paris Aligned Investors Initiative, which with brilliant minds of Daisy Streatfeild, produced the first NZIF. We co-Chaired the Board with Dutch fund APG on behalf of ABP (fellow co-chair was Claudia Kruse supported by Lucian Peppelenbos) but as ever with Faith Ward contributing alongside minds such as Michael Marshall, Peter Smith, David Adkins, Dewi Dylander, Akaash Sachdeva and Liz Gordon and the IIGCC team. Today, we have the launch of NZIF 2.0 which is the most widely used net zero guidance for investors with multiple trillions using it to inform their decision making. It is also now an initiative of the regional investor networks: Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC) Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) & Ceres, Inc. Third, to expand investor approaches to sovereign debt through the Assessing Sovereign Climate Opportunities and Risks (ASCOR) project. Together with Co-Chair's Victoria Barron Esther Law & Claudia Gollmeier and supported by the investor networks (Principles for Responsible Investment, Ceres, Inc. IIGCC, NZAOA) and leading minds from various supporting fund managers - ASCOR's methodology has been brought to life by the TPI Centre at LSE. The response to the first 25 country assessments (70 countries later this yr) has been superb and widely welcomed by investors, sovereign issuers and IMF. All three interventions serve a wider common need for credible asset owner driven tools and frameworks. The key ingredient has been Asset Owner leadership alongside the pooled wisdom of networks, funds and individuals that have contributed to navigating this evolving multi-decadal transition. https://lnkd.in/e9EKJSVG\n\nAs UK asset owners, we naturally want to see the UK continue to thrive as a global financial centre. However, we do not think the CP23/31 proposals under consideration by the Financial Conduct Authority will lead to the healthy capital markets we all want. Instead, we think they will make the UK less appealing as a destination for capital, exacerbating the current issues by making UK-listed companies less attractive to the kinds of high-quality, long-term investors that both our pre- and post-IPO companies tell us they are looking for. The Church of England Pensions Board strongly support and were happy to be co-signatories of the letter submitted today by Railpen and signed by other major UK Pension Funds which in turn supports the robust concerns raised by the International Corporate Governance Network. It is surprising to read suggestions that these proposals will be brought for a decision so shortly after the general election and before the intent is clear of whichever new government is in office. It would perhaps be prudent to take a pause and to reflect if these changes are the right ones to be made. Signatories to the letter include: Brunel Pension Partnership Limited London Pensions Fund Authority People's Partnership NILGOSC West Yorkshire Pension Fund\n\nExcellent article by the Financial Times Tom Wilson reflecting on the implications for the #mining sector of the attempted takeover of Anglo American. The article speaks for itself and notes that the deal would not have led to single more tonne of #copper. For me, and many of the asset owners I am speaking to, this has been a wake up call that we need long-term thinking as well as commitment to not only recognise the importance of the mining sector but to enable it to expand in the most socially and environmentally responsible way possible. If we dont engage then short-term pressures will prevail. We have to re-set the landscape incentivising and valuing companies so that they can make the investments in responsible expansion. Asset owners in particular, need to use this moment to recognise the responsibility we have through the mandates and expectations we provide our fund managers, if mining is to rise to meet the global demand. This is though far more than just valuing companies and giving Board's confidence to act, but also a need to recognise that the model of mining that should grow is one that can genuinely leave a positive legacy in mineral rich countries such as DRC. It is essential that the people of mineral rich countries genuinely benefit in economic development that doesn't leave a legacy of environmental and social harm. As the finance representative on behalf of the Principles for Responsible Investment on the United Nations Secretary Generals Advisory Panel on Critical Transition Minerals, this will be a key focus for my contribution. I will be drawing from the work of PRI and the insights of the Global Investor Commission on Mining 2030. To take stock of where we are and the particular role investors need to now play we will be convening asset owners to reflect on the lessons from these important recent events. If you are an asset owner with holdings in the mining sector or any sector that is dependent on minerals please do message me or the Global Investor Commission."
