        "text": "Sustainability strategy and accountability\n\nRio Tinto provides evidence of linking performance criteria in senior executivesâ remuneration policies to targets and objectives which cover nature and social issues, including the delivery of its climate goals and an increase of women in its workforce.\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nRio Tinto discloses an overview of the issues raised during its stakeholder engagement activities and how often and through which channels it engages with various stakeholder groups. It is one of the few companies to disclose how its stakeholder engagement activities impact its sustainability strategy. The companyâs stakeholder engagement covers nature, including biodiversity, and social issues.\n\nLobbyingÂ\n\nRio Tinto discloses a list of trade associations of which it is a member wherever it operates. In addition, the company discloses a framework for assessing alignment of its trade associations centred around the Paris Agreement as well as misalignments between the lobbying activities of its trade associations and climate policies.\n\nImpact and dependencies assessmentÂ\n\nThe company reported on the biodiversity sensitivity of its assets in 2020. It has completed a risk and impact assessment for 100% of its high-priority biodiversity sites and 86% of all its sites.\n\nKey areas and speciesÂ\n\nRio Tinto discloses the locations that are in or adjacent to areas important for biodiversity within its own operations. It has a management plan for locations within its own operations adjacent to areas important for biodiversity, and it discloses the percentage of land, fresh water and sea use in such locations. The company also discloses species populations existing in or adjacent to its own locations and their status according to national and international conservation lists.\n\nWaterÂ\n\nThe company discloses its processes for implementing preventive and corrective action plans for identified specific risks to the right to water and sanitation in its own operations.\n\nInvasive speciesÂ\n\nThe company ensures it does not introduce new invasive species and takes control measures against the species it has been made aware of, such as yellow crazy ants.\n\nImpact and dependencies assessmentÂ\n\nRio Tinto has an opportunity to perform a business model assessment to fully understand its impact on nature. While the company discloses biodiversity performance and areas by asset, it does not assess its impacts on nature, including biodiversity, in the upstream activities of its value chain. Although Rio Tinto used a database developed by the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre that combined global datasets of threatened species and conservation and protected areas, there is no further evidence that the company assesses the dependencies on nature of its upstream business relationships.\n\nKey areas and speciesÂ\n\nRio Tinto does not disclose the locations of its suppliers that are in or adjacent to areas important for biodiversity and species populations existing in or adjacent to the locations of its suppliers.\n\nEcosystem conversion and restorationÂ\n\nRio Tinto does not have a commitment to ensure zero conversion. While its land management and rehabilitation policy states that it strives to confine its activities to the strict minimum, no evidence was found in the public domain that the company works towards achieving conversion-free supply chains. The company does not have time-bound targets to achieve conversion-free supply chains.\n\nResource exploitation and circularityÂ\n\nRio Tinto does not disclose its inputs, including its material footprint. While it discloses the percentage of key products with life-cycle assessments, it does not quantitatively report its circularity performance. The company discloses activities to improve soil health, but it has an opportunity to disclose a related target.\n\nWaterÂ\n\nRio Tinto discloses an increase in water withdrawal between 2020 and 2021. While the company states that it will disclose permitted surface water allocation volumes, their annual allocation usage and the associated surface water allocation catchment rainfall runoff volume estimate by 2023 for all managed operations, it does not disclose a time-bound target to reduce water withdrawal across its own operations and reports progress against the target. The company reports how much water is withdrawn for its own operations in water-stressed areas. H, however, there is an opportunity for engagement with suppliers to reduce water withdrawal. Although the company reports a decrease in water pollution, it does not disclose its processes for managing and monitoring discharge water quality, nor does it regularly report on water pollution. Rio Tinto has a strong opportunity to disclose targets to reduce water pollution as well as a commitment to respect the right to water.\n\nSolid and air pollutionÂ\n\nRio Tinto is reducing the production of hazardous waste. However, it is not reducing plastic use and waste in its own operations, nor does it report on the amount of plastic waste generated. While the company reports regularly on air quality parameters of emissions of harmful air pollutants, it has an opportunity to disclose a time-bound target to reduce air pollutants across the most material parts of its value chain and report progress against the target.\n\nGHG emissionsÂ\n\nRio Tinto has a time-bound target to reduce its scope 1 and 2 emissions and reports progress against it. However, while the company discloses that its scope 1 and 2 emissions target is aligned with a 1.5-degree trajectory according to an external third-party audit, this is not an approved science-based target. Furthermore, while the company is reducing its scope 3 emissions and states that it is engaging with its iron ore and bauxite customers to cover over 50% of its scope 3 emissions, no evidence of a time-bound target to reduce its scope 3 emissions was found in the public domain. The company has a strong opportunity to set a scope 3 emissions reduction target aligned with a 1.5-degree trajectory.\n\nInvasive speciesÂ\n\nWhile Rio Tinto provides some examples, no evidence was found that the company systematically identifies the activities that could lead to the introduction of invasive alien species (IAS) in its value chain."
