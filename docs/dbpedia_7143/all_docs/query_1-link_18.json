The two companies are joined in a dual listed companies structure as a single economic entity, called the Rio Tinto Group.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all Rio Tinto staff and all the companies in the Rio Tinto Group (which may be described as « Rio Tinto », « Group businesses », « we » or « us » in this Privacy Policy also).\n\nStructure\n\nThis Privacy Policy is in two parts. It contains:\n\nRio Tinto’s Data Privacy Standard which includes 12 Data Privacy Principles that apply whenever and wherever Rio Tinto collects and processes personal data; and\n\nOnline privacy and cookies statement, which sets out additional information about your privacy if you use this website.\n\nA Glossary has been included at the end of the Standard which defines key terms (in red).\n\nQuestions and contact information\n\nIf you have any questions or complaints about your privacy or wish to exercise your rights as a data subject, please refer to Data Privacy Principle 8 in the Data Privacy Standard and:\n\ncontact the Data Privacy Lead for your region;\n\ncontact your local Rio Tinto office; or\n\nemail us at ap-technology.sales@riotinto.com. Your correspondence will be forwarded to the Rio Tinto Data Privacy Lead for the relevant region to consider.\n\nThis Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. This Privacy Policy was last updated in April 2018.\n\nData privacy standard\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat does this Standard do?\n\nThe Data Privacy Standard sets out the minimum rules (Data Privacy Principles) that apply whenever and wherever Rio Tinto collects and processes personal data. The Data Privacy Principles reflect the benchmark for processing personal data across the Rio Tinto Group.\n\nNote that:\n\npersonal data means all information relating to any identifiable individual.\n\nprocess and processing covers everything we might do with personal data.\n\nThe Glossary at the end of the Standard defines these and other terms used in this Standard (in red).\n\nWho does this Standard apply to?\n\nThis Standard applies to everyone who works for Rio Tinto, and to each Rio Tinto Group business.\n\nWhy is compliance with this Standard important?\n\nAt Rio Tinto, the lawful and correct handling of personal data is critical. At its simplest, people need to be able to trust us to respect their privacy and how we handle their personal datawhen working with us or doing business with us.\n\nIn addition, we need to comply with privacy and data protection laws around the world. Applying the Data Privacy Principles in this Data Privacy Standard helps us to do this. Failure to comply with these principles could lead to financial and reputational damage to Rio Tinto, as well as resulting in a loss of trust from the individuals we employ, engage or do business with.\n\nWhat do we need to comply with?\n\nWe must comply with the Data Privacy Principles and also with local laws that apply to the processing of personal data. If there is a conflict between the requirements under the Data Privacy Principles and local laws, you should comply with the most stringent requirement.\n\nAny variance from or exception to the Data Privacy Standard must be approved by the Head of Ethics & Integrity. This Standard will be reviewed at least once every three (3) years.\n\nData privacy principles\n\nThe following Data Privacy Principles reflect the minimum rules that apply to the processingof personal data at Rio Tinto.\n\nData Privacy Principle 1: Our processing of personal data is lawful, fair and transparent\n\nLawful basis for processing: We will only process personal data:\n\nfor the legitimate business purpose we collected it for, as explained in a privacy statement;\n\nfor other purposes that the data subject (the person that the data relates to) consents to;\n\nwhere necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject;\n\nif the processing is required in order to comply with our legal obligations; or\n\nif the processing is expressly permitted under local data privacy laws and the relevant personal data originates in that jurisdiction.\n\nNotification of processing: We will notify data subjects that we’re collecting their personal data, by providing a privacy statement at or before the time we collect personal datafrom them.\n\nData Privacy Principle 2: We limit our personal data processing\n\nPurpose limitation: Our personal data processing must be for specific and limited purposes, as notified to the data subject. If we process personal data for a different purpose than that notified, we need to inform the relevant data subject(s) of that new purpose (in accordance with Data Privacy Principle 1).\n\nData minimisation: We must process only that amount of personal data that we need for the relevant processing purpose. Our personal data processing must be adequate, relevant and not excessive.\n\nData Privacy Principle 3: We maintain data quality\n\nWhen we process personal data, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal datais accurate and where necessary, is kept up to date.\n\nData Privacy Principle 4: We are careful with sensitive information\n\nSensitive information is a type of personal data that is of a particularly private nature and includes (among other things) personal data about a person’s race, ethnic origins, trade union membership and health information. We must ensure that sensitive information is processed only when necessary and only if:\n\nthe data subject consents; or\n\nif processing is:\n\nrequired in order to comply with our legal obligations,\n\nis expressly permitted under local data privacy laws and the relevant personal dataoriginates in that jurisdiction; or\n\nnecessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life, health or safety of any person.\n\nData Privacy Principle 5: We protect our disclosures of personal data\n\nWe protect disclosures of personal data (including but not limited to when it is transferred across national borders) as follows:\n\nDisclosures outside the Rio Tinto Group: If we need to disclose personal data outside the Rio Tinto Group (for example, to an external service provider or to a third party who is authorised to receive the personal data), we must ensure that:\n\nthe disclosure is protected by contractual data privacy clauses approved by Ethics & Integrity or Rio Tinto Legal. This must include an assessment of whether any transfers across national borders comply with applicable data privacy laws;\n\nthe relevant data subjects have consented to the disclosure; or\n\nthe disclosure is otherwise required by law or is or is expressly permitted under local data privacy laws and the relevant personal data originates in that jurisdiction.\n\nDisclosures within the Rio Tinto Group: Disclosures within the Rio Tinto Group are protected by the Rio Tinto Data Transfer Deed if it is necessary to share personal data outside of the jurisdiction where the personal data was first collected. Company secretarial and each Group business will ensure that any new Group companies sign up to the Rio Tinto Data Transfer Deed.\n\nData Privacy Principle 6: We must secure personal data\n\nGeneral data security obligations: Personal data must be kept secure and protected against accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing, including against loss and unauthorised access, destruction, misuse, modification or disclosure. This means ensuring that Rio Tinto has appropriate technical and organisational measures in place. Data security obligations apply whether personal data is stored in hard copy form (eg paper) or in electronic form (eg in databases). The key rules are:\n\naccess to personal data about other people should be on a « need to know » basis only; and\n\neach Group business must implement the Rio Tinto Group Standard on Acceptable Use of Information and Electronic Resources and the Group Procedure on Information and Cyber Security (administered by Cyber Security in IS&T) to ensure that appropriate physical, technical and organisational security measures are in place at all stages of the personal data ‘life cycle’.\n\nInternal reporting of Data Privacy Incidents: Data Privacy Incidents are Group reportable incidents under the Investigations Procedure. Each Data Privacy Incident must be immediately reported to Ethics and Integrity.\n\nData Privacy Principle 7: We limit retention of personal data\n\nPersonal data must be kept only for as long as necessary for the lawful purpose for which it is processed (as notified to the relevant individuals), or for the time required or permitted under local laws (whichever is the shorter). After such time, records containing personal data must be securely destroyed (in the case of physical records) or permanently deleted (in the case of electronic records) in accordance with Rio Tinto’s Records Retention Procedure or applicable local laws (whichever imposes the strictest obligations).\n\nData Privacy Principle 8: We respect data subject rights\n\nData subjects have the right to:\n\nseek access to personal data that Rio Tinto holds about them;\n\nseek correction of inaccurate, incomplete or out of date personal data;\n\nseek erasure of their personal data;\n\nbe provided with information about how their personal data is processed;\n\nask for processing of their personal data to cease (particularly if the processing is likely to cause damage or distress, or if the processing is for direct marketing purposes);\n\nbe notified if the Group business has made a decision about the data subject that is based on automated data processing alone (so that the data subject can ask for a review of the decision, if necessary);\n\ncomplain about the processing of their personal data; or\n\nwithdraw previously given consent regarding Rio Tinto’s processing of their personal data\n\nThere are legal exceptions to the exercise of these rights, and Rio Tinto will review each request on a case by case basis, by reference to the laws of the country where the data subject is located. Requests from data subjects to access their rights should be referred to the Data Privacy Lead for the relevant region.\n\nData Privacy Principle 9: We apply Privacy by Design\n\nWe must:\n\nintegrate data privacy compliance measures into our personal data processing activities; and\n\nconsider individual privacy rights from the outset of each new personal data processing activity.\n\nWe will undertake a Privacy Impact Assessment when we introduce a new personal data processing technology, or whenever new personal data processing or changes to existing personal data processing is likely to result in a risk to the rights of data subjects.\n\nData Privacy Principle 10: We don’t spam\n\nWe must limit our use of personal data to send marketing communications. All marketing communications (however distributed) must:\n\nclearly identify the relevant Group business or Group company as the sender, and how it can be contacted;\n\nbe sent with the consent of the recipient/data subject (which may be able to be implied from an existing business relationship or shareholding); and\n\ncontain an unsubscribe or opt out facility. Opt outs must be acted upon and records amended accordingly.\n\nGlossary\n\nConsent of a data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes.\n\nData Privacy Incident means a known or suspected breach of:\n\nthe data security obligations in Data Privacy Principle 6; or\n\nany of the other Data Privacy Principles in this Data Privacy Standard.\n\nData Privacy Lead means a member of Ethics & Integrity who is the first point of contact for data privacy questions from a region, as listed on the data privacy page on Element (the Rio Tinto intranet).\n\nData Privacy Principles: the principles in the Data Privacy Standard that Rio Tinto Group companies and staff must apply when processing personal data.\n\nData subject: the individual to whom personal data relates.\n\nGroup business: includes all companies, product groups, business units, global functions and corporate offices in the Rio Tinto Group.\n\nLegitimate business purpose: a purpose that is directed at Rio Tinto achieving its business objectives and that complies with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\nMarketing communications: means communications and publications that have a purpose of marketing or promoting Rio Tinto or its products, but does not include communications from Rio Tinto to its employees that relate to the administration of the employment relationship.\n\nPersonal data: all information relating to any identifiable individual.\n\nPrivacy Impact Assessment means an assessment of the impact of proposed processing operations on the rights and freedoms of data subjects, and the protection of personal data.\n\nPrivacy Statement: a notice that needs to be provided to data subjects when we collect their personal data.\n\nProcessing: all actions taken in relation to personal data including collecting, using, disclosing, recording, organising, storing, transferring, amending, deleting, destroying, retrieving, accessing, hosting or otherwise handling .\n\nRio Tinto Data Transfer Deed: the deed executed between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc on 1 July 2009 (as amended from time to time) and to which Rio Tinto Group companies are bound under executed Deeds of Accession.\n\nRio Tinto Group: all the businesses which are wholly or majority owned or managed by Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited (whether directly or indirectly).\n\nSensitive information: personal data (including information or an opinion) about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions and memberships, religious or philosophical beliefs or associations, trade union membership, criminal record, health or the health services they have received or details of sexual life.\n\nAppendix 1\n\nOverview of personal data collections and processing\n\nRio Tinto collects and processes personal data for a range of business purposes, including:\n\nManaging human resources: Personal data about employees, prospective employees and contractors is collected for human resources (HR) purposes.
