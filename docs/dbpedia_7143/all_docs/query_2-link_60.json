        "text": "The date is set for Li Qiang to bring China’s biggest business delegation down under since 2017, and Australian businesses are expected to ‘press their commercial interests’.\n\nThe MoU between Rio Tinto and China Baowu will explore several initiatives including setting up green steel facilities in China and Western Australia.\n\nSandwiched between superpowers, Mongolia is in a precarious geopolitical position, and Prime Minister Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene says Russia and China ‘totally understand and highly appreciate’ this.\n\nSpecialist search equipment picked up radiation emitting from the widget, which went missing last month, apparently while being moved from a Rio Tinto iron ore mine.\n\nThe capsule emits the equivalent of 10 X-rays an hour and can cause skin damage, burns and radiation sickness. Long-term exposure could also cause cancer – but experts say the lost item cannot be weaponised.\n\nWith Australia’s reduced trade with China, exports to the US have increased, but the US$1billion a month of trade isn’t enough to offset the loss.\n\nWork is on hold at the China-backed Simandou mine, home to one of the biggest undeveloped reserves in the world.\n\nIn the 2021-25 raw material development plan, China says iron self-sufficiency will be ‘significantly’ increased and its rare earth quota mechanism streamlined to adjust production.\n\nIron ore prices have plummeted since May, reflecting recent efforts by Beijing to rein in demand for steel and turn back high raw material prices that have hit Chinese producers.\n\nSteel prices in China finished the quarter at decade highs as construction activity and demand in the first quarter exceeded both 2020 and 2019.\n\nAustralia’s iron ore exports are expected to earn more than A$100 billion (US$76 billion) per year for the next half decade as miners like BHP Group, Rio Tinto and Fortescue dig out more iron ore from Western Australia’s Pilbara region.\n\nChina Baowu Steel Group became the world’s largest steelmaker last week, highlighting Beijing’s goal of creating a ‘national team’ of globally competitive state-owned enterprises.\n\nWith Chinese demand for iron ore increasing amid the nation’s economic recovery, market punters had been looking to capitalise as prices were driven up in recent months by a number of underlying factors.\n\nChinese government-backed consultancy projects a slowdown in China’s steel production next year, but market analysts say aggressive speculation through iron ore derivative trading could keep prices inflated."
