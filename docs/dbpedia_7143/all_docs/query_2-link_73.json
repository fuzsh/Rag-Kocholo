        "text": "Rio Tinto and the AJIF\n\nInternational mining group Rio Tinto has deep connections to both Australia and Japan. Its world-class iron ore business in the Pilbara region of Western Australia was born on the back of Japanese investment and long-term offtake contracts with the Japanese steel mills, more than half a century ago. Today, Rio Tinto is the largest supplier of iron ore to Japan and a leading supplier of other metals and minerals to Japan from its diverse operations in Australia and elsewhere.\n\nFrom this deep connection and Rio Tinto’s desire to further support the broader bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan, the company has committed to support the promotion of academic and research links between the two countries by becoming the founding Funding Member of the Foundation for Australia-Japan Studies (now Australia Japan Innovation Fund) and sponsoring its inaugural program, the Rio Tinto Australia-Japan Collaboration Program.\n\nAbout Rio Tinto and Japan\n\nJapan is one of Rio Tinto’s most important and longstanding trading partners. Rio Tinto’s iron ore business was born on the back of Japanese investment and long-term offtake contracts with the Japanese steel mills in the 1960’s. Today Rio Tinto is the largest supplier of iron ore to Japan, shipping over 1.8 billion tonnes to date over the past more than 50 years.\n\nRio Tinto is also one of the largest exporters of metals and minerals to Japan, supplying aluminium, copper, molybdenum, diamonds, metallurgical coal, uranium and industrial minerals such as borates, titanium dioxide and salt as well as iron ore to more than 250 customers. Japanese companies are important partners in Rio Tinto’s operations around the world, its global supply chain as well as in innovation."
