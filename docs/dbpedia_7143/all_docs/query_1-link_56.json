        "text": "Hatchworks has conducted due diligence on Rio Tinto, a world leader in mining research, prospecting and operating. They produce iron ore for steel, aluminium for cars and smart phones, copper for wind turbines, diamonds and titanium for household products.\n\nHeadquartered in London, United Kingdom, Rio Tinto plc is listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges, whereas Rio Tinto Limited is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, all under the symbol ‘’RIO’’. The companies are joined together in a dual-listed company structure (DLC) as a single economic entity.\n\nFinancials — Rio Tinto\n\n(Source: Marketscreener.com, investing.com)\n\nRio Tinto’s current market cap is $90.1B and stock price is around $53.\n\nWith a predicted net-income loss of -14% for 2020E and 2021E, and a net income estimate for 2021E of in excess of $7.6B, this points to a P/E ratio of 11.6x.\n\nThe revenue/sales forecast is $40.6B for 2020E, indicating an EV/Sales ratio of 2.36x.\n\nIn terms of profitability, an operating margin of 35.4% is predicted for 2020E. This is higher than competitors such as Anglo American (AAL), for example, who has a lower operating margin of 24.2% for 2020E.\n\nRio Tinto is a yielding equity with a relatively high yield of 6.47% for 2020E.\n\nIt is worth noting that, after the previous recession, the share price made a significant plunge of 75%. Another important note is that Rio Tinto (RIO) net sales consists 60% of iron ore production and 29.7% of aluminum.\n\nCurrently, the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China has already taken a heavy toll. Many emerging market currencies have weakened. Oil prices have also declined sharply, reflecting a combination of weaker sentiment and concerns that the virus outbreak and its containment measures will lead to lower demand for oil and other raw materials by China. Around 44.6% of Rio Tinto (RIO) net sales comes from China.\n\nAccording to our analysis, Rio Tinto has a strong operating margin, low debt position, and an attractive yield. However, due to the uncertainties in China and other countries, and the predicted net loss mentioned above, Hatchworks will not be investing at this stage, but will keep Rio Tinto on its radar."
