        "text": "R-9 vs R-16\n\nMitrofan Nedelin played a key role in ushering in the space age by concluding that rockets were the ideal means to deliver a nuclear warhead to enemy instead of bombers and ordered Sergei Korolev to develop the massive R-7 ICBM.\n\nBut this rocket and its derivatives, was powerful enough to launch Sputnik and Vostok manned space vehicles into orbit enabling the USSR to beat the US to space. but it was never an effective ICBM!\n\nFor Military purposes however, a new launch vehicle was neccesary.\n\nOne that could be launched quickly after the go ahead, one that would be useful in retaliation against an American first strike.\n\nSo the Soviet Strategic Rocket Force wanted a better, usable ICBM launcher they could use from protective Silos.\n\nWith the success of first tactical missile using storable fuels, it became obvious the new generation ICBM have use them\n\nSo Milhail Yangel OKB-589 ordered the development of the R-16 using Toxic nitric acid and UDMH fuel.\n\nBut Korolev abhorred those fuels would be \"playing with devil\" and prefer cleaner Liquid oxygen and Kerosine.\n\nHe got permission to build a backup system in case the R-16 project failed: The R-9.\n\nActually Gluchko's OKB-456 was to build rocket engines for R-16 and R-9,\n\nBut Korolev hated him[1] and refused his offer, using his growing influence to instead have team up with Kuznetsov OKB-276 for engines.\n\nDespite pressure to perform all safety tests before October 7th (the day of the Bolshevik revolution)\n\nThe vehicle thuroughly tested even after the date, the last thing Nedeplin needed was a failed launch[2]\n\nLuckily all went well as the rocket soared into the sky. While the launch was not without it's faults (comming somewhat short of the intended range)\n\nThe success was more than any of the hundreds of engineers had hoped for.\n\nWhile the R-16 R&D went well, the R-9 experienced problems with it’s NK-9 engines.\n\nOKB-276 just start to build rocket engine and had not experience like it rival OKB-456, what let to violent explosion on test stand.\n\nOn April 9, 1961, the first R-9 made test launch. 54 second into flight a fire broke out in engine Nr. 4 leading to the destruction of the R-9\n\nThe second test launch in May ended in a disaster as engine Nr. 6 exploded 20 second after launch.\n\nOKB-1 started to check the delivery NK-9 engines and found faulty welds, metal shavings in turbo pump, fuel lines and Injector-plates.\n\nKuznetsov made his best to increase the production standards and to push for better quality control on rocket engines.\n\nAnd with success, on October 25, 1961. The third R-9 launch went good following which the R-9 started a series of launches for it qualification.\n\nBy this time it was too late for the R-9 project, In same time the R-16 start make impressive results,\n\nOn August 1961 R-16s were being deployed as operational ICBMs all along the Soviet Union\n\nThe R-16 would be used in mass for several years untill it's eventual retirement.[3]\n\nThe R-9 stay as reserve force in case, all R-16 had to be fired in case of War, were they came too close in October 1961\n\nFinal end of R-9 came on October 24 1963, with LC-70 silo disaster. A oxygen tank leak in the Silo fueling system, let to a blaze killing seven men of the launch crew.\n\nThe R-9 was pullt out of Service, Sergei Korolev accepted the failure of R-9, he was busy for moment with a important projects for Soviet Union.\n\nThe real winner of the entire R-9 ordeal was Kuznetsov's OKB-276, which with each error learned more and more how to build rockets engines and that would be quit handy for a future Korolev/Soviet Space project.[4]\n\nNOTES:\n\n[1] in 1938 Korolev was deliberately accused and send to gulag camp later he works as prisoner under Gluchko at OKB-16\n\nHere became the former friends mortal rivals and enemies.\n\n[2] The Nedelin Tragedy is famous in rocket history for being one of the worst launch failures ever. 120 people died, the program was delayed by a year, and was covered up untill 1989. here in Story the launch is successful because took more time for testing.\n\n[3]Without the Nedelin Tragedy, the R-16 becomes a commonly deployed ICBM. With the Soviet Union more reliant on ICBMs they never need to deploy IRBMs in Cuba and the Cuban Missile crisis never happens. The results of this will become clearer later in the story\n\n[4]Korolev was forced to work with Glushko who built the rocket engines for the R-9 rather than Kuznetsov, which lead to problems when the Kuznetsov completely inexperienced with rocket engines, was tasked with designing, building, testing and launching the NK-15 engines years later for the N-1 project.\n\nIn story with greater influence in the Soviet leadership, Korolev is able to get his way and isn't forced to cooperate with Glushko, whom Korolev hated.\n\n1961: The Year the World almost faced Nuclear War twice !\n\nFebruary 9, 1961. An IL-18 plane carrying Leonid Brezhnev on board.\n\nAt the time he was acting as the nominal head of state of the Soviet Union and on a state visit to the Guinea Republic.\n\nDo navigation error the plane enter French-Algerian airspace.\n\nBecause the Civil-War there, the French military suspected that IL-18 was a weapon transporter for FLN rebels,\n\nand send Vautour fighter jets to intercept the airplane.\n\nThe IL-18 Pilots believing there outside French airspace, first ignored the french Vautour.\n\nuntil one of french Pilot open fire, to force Aircraft to follow them, unfortunate damaging the Il-18.\n\nThe pilots try to reach Morocco airfield but crash in desert killing all onboard !\n\nThe dead of Leonid Brezhnev was shock for Soviet politburo, who consider this as act of barbarism,\n\nThe French Government apologise, but insisted that Brezhnev's plane strayed into French-Algerian airspace.\n\nBut Prime-minister Michel Debrè manage this so badly, that Khrushchev put a ultimatum to De Gaulle:\n\nExtradite those Responsible of this political assassination to Soviet or else the Soviet union will retaliate.\n\nand suddenly this became a World Crisis !\n\nThe situation was hopeless, France had Nuclear bomb prototypes, but no delivery system for them.\n\nKennedy declared DEFCON 2 and mobilised the NATO forces in case the Soviets really was preparing to attack,\n\nWhile the U.N try to defuse the situation.\n\nBut before the situation escalated to a full war, De Gaulle extradite Michel Debrè to Soviet embassy in Paris.\n\nHe was transported in Diplomatic Box to Moscow and trail in 1962 and sentenced to life in Prison.\n\n(and allot french were happy he was gone, Debrè was after all one of most unpopular politician in France )\n\nFrance ended up after this crisis deeper in NATO as De Gaulle wanted.\n\nWhile the British made demands: let UK join the European Economic Community in exchange for full support for France in NATO.\n\nApril 12, 1961 one biggest moments in History, Yuri Gagarin, became the first man in orbit and space.\n\nThe Next crisis came just days later on 17 April. The Bay of Pigs invasion happened in Cuba, the moment Fidel Castro announce that the invasion had failed, Nikita Khrushchev declared that Cuba is now under the nuclear protection of USSR,\n\nthreatening the use of ICBMs to defend the country for any aggressor.\n\nOn May 4th, 1961 Alan Shepard became the first American in space on his suborbital Mercury\n\nFollow on May 25th, with Kennedy \"we choose go to the moon\" speech starting the Moon race.\n\nThen the East Germans started the construction of the Berlin Wall on August 13. The other major crisis of that year.\n\nIt's zenith came on October 27, when US and Soviet tanks and infantry held a standoff at Checkpoint Charlie, Berlin.\n\nDuring the tensest hours, the World watched as they stood on the edge of Nuclear War again, which, luckily, did not happen.\n\nThankfully nothing even approaching the crisis period of this year would happen in the rest of the Cold War.\n\nBut it was a wakeup call in Washington D.C. and Moscow,\n\nWhen allot of politician were asking „Do we need to play the Nuclear Card in this Game ?“\n\nThe next 3 years the Kennedy Administration and Politburo started negotiation for treaties\n\nEven after murder of J.F. Kennedy, President Johnson completed it, resulting in:\n\n-Installation of “Red Phone“ line between Washington D.C. and Moscow (Telephone, Telex, later Videophone and computer links)\n\n-Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (only underground testing. No testing on surface, in air, ocean or space or other planets )\n\n-Voluntary Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (V-SALT) limiting the total number of ICBM Bombers SLBM.\n\nAftermath\n\nV-SALT brought allot financial savings: the USA retired the Atlas and Titan ICBM earlier in favour of Minutemen,\n\nWhile the USSR focused on the R-16 and UR-200 ICBM\n\nFrance started Nuclear armament in H-bomb, Missile, Bomber and Submarines.\n\nFor Next 20 years France and USSR relationship was ultra cold, until socialist François Mitterrand became French President.\n\nThe Swiss vote in plebiscite for nuclear Weapon program for self-defence in 1962.\n\nThe Ministry of General Machine-Building Industry of USSR\n\nThe launch of Sputnik in 1957 started the Space Race between USA and USSR.\n\nFour years later the Soviet launch first human into Space and back Alive and Yuri Gagarin became a new kind of Hero !\n\nThe American try to follow with Suborbital Mercury flights, but With Gherman Titov one day in space\n\nMaking the US flights ridiculously trivial, in 1962 the first Mercury went into Orbit with John Glenn.\n\nAfter Brezhnev Disaster and Fail Cuba Invasion and success of Soviet in space, J.F.Kennedy be under pressure to take action,\n\nSo on May 25, he held the famous \"We choose go to the Moon\" speech starting the Moon Race.\n\nAt first Nikita Khrushchev believed this was some kind of joke.\n\nBut his son and Sergei Korolev make very clear that Americans a serious and able to put a man on Moon!\n\nSo Khrushchev demanded a counter program to put a Soviet on Moon, but here the Problems startet.\n\nWhile USA had the military USAF and civilian NASA for such program\n\nWas the soviet space flight activity, let us say chaotic:\n\nNext Rivalry between the Soviet design bureaus, who get lucrative contracts at any cost.\n\nWas also rivalry between Air Force and Strategic Rocket Force over Manned space flights vs only ICBM.\n\nNikita Khrushchev was well informed by his son about this Mess.\n\nSo began the Politburo to centralise the soviet space flight activity under a new Ministry.\n\nThat coordinate the civilian and military spaceflight program, while Strategic Rocket Force keep control over their missiles.\n\nThe Ministry would become responsible for developing the new launch vehicles, ballistic missiles and payloads for the military and other applications.\n\nAlso Cooperate the new Ministry with the Fourth Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense, Agat, and NII Khimash, TsNIIMASH and NIITI.\n\nGeorgiy A. Tyulin was chosen as the head of the new Ministry called:\n\n\"Ministry of General Machine-Building Industry of USSR\" Министерство общего машиностроения СССР (MoM for short)\n\nThis name was chosen to fool foreign secret services.\n\nMoM started evaluation of current running programs planned and proposed concepts.\n\nThe Moon program L-1 and L-3 were put on priority,\n\nDevelopment of Space Probe for Moon, Mars, Venus and beyond\n\nStudy for manned orbital station as next steps\n\nStudy for moon base and manned interplanetary travel as such was considered a long-term with low priority for moment.\n\nBut not all were happy with new situation, like Gluchko who keep his OKB-456 independent under protection of Strategic Rocket Force.\n\nThe other was Chelomei OKB-52 who saw allot of his program getting cancelled by MoM\n\nLike UR-500 heavy ICBM, UR-200 ICBM, L-1 lunar flyby, Kosmoplan and others\n\nIt was own fault Chelomei aggressively promoted his proposals with defamation about his Rivals, also his Arrogant way was not helpful in this.\n\nAlso was Tyulin in Clinch with marshal Nedelin, how insisted that only Yangel OKB-586 build ICBM for Strategic Rocket Force,\n\nwith engines build by Gluchko.\n\nMercury-Gemini vs Vostok-Voskhod\n\nThe Soviet beat the USA with sending Yuri Gagarin into Space in 1961.\n\n24 days later, American Alan Shepard made Suborbital flight on Mercury-Redstone\n\nOriginal all Seven NASAAstronauts had to do a Suborbital flight, bevor Orbit flights.\n\nBut the one day in space of Gherman Titov, made those plans obsoleted.\n\nNASA needed 10 months to launch Mercury-Atlas, with John Glenn on board.\n\nWhile NASA try to catch up the Success of Titov flight by prolonging each Mercury flight.\n\nThe Soviet broke another Records with launch of Vostok 3 and 4 the first simultaneous mission in Space !\n\nBut the Mercury hardware was not reliable, the last flight with Gordon Cooper show that clearly.\n\nAfter 34 hours in space most of systems show problems and issue, that Cooper used manual override for return\n\nWhile Vostok 5 stay four days in space, follow by Vostok 6 with first Woman in space: Valentina Tereshkova.\n\nNASA abandon Mercury and went for Gemini program with 2 men Capsule for testing various technology for Apollo program.\n\nin USSR Nikita Khrushchev demanded form MoM to beat the USA by sending 3 cosmonauts in Vostok capsule !\n\nOriginal were 13 Vostok Mission planned, now canceled by Khrushchev with order of new program\n\nMinister Tyulin was not happy, either Korolev and Sergei Khrushchev because to manage the demand.\n\nThe Vostok spacecraft had the crew rescue system removed, in case launch failure the crew had not a chance !\n\nThe new Craft was called Voskhod to fool USA thinking the Soviet had their version of Gemini.\n\nOn 12 october 1964 Voskhod-1 was launch with V. Komarov, K. Feoktistov and B. Yegorov for one day mission.\n\nFinal the NASA could launch Gemini 3 into orbit but before Gemini 4 in June could do a Spacewalk\n\nThe Soviets made this with Voskhod-2 on 18 march 1965 were Alexei Leonov made the first Spacewalk\n\nBut the USA catch up with Gemini 5 seven days mission,\n\nor first rendezvous in Space between Gemini 6 and 7 that stay 14 days in space.\n\nKhrushchev demanded to counter that with other Voskhod missions\n\nVoskhod-3 was 10 day mission with two Women Valentina Ponomaryova and Irina Solovyova\n\nVoskhod-4 had to be a 20 day solo mission for Ivan Anikeyev in 1966.\n\nIt launch went wrong as on booster separation, one of them hit the core stage and destroy the rocket\n\nLucky for Anikeyev the Capsule was 50 km high and landed save 400 km from launch site.\n\nTyulin order the immediate end of the Voskhod and focus full on Soyuz program,\n\nin dispute with Nikita Khrushchev he answer angry:\n\nDo you want as first record also Dead Cosmonauts ?\n\nIn mean time NASA notice that Voskhod show same inflexibly like Vostok, no change of orbit, no rendezvous.\n\nwhile the Gemini were first completely spacecraft able to do those things.\n\nwe're the USA now ahead in Space Race ?\n\nKhrushchev's Thaw, Kosygin's Rise (1953-1971)\n\n...despite Alexander Kosygin losing his seat to the Politburo in mid 1952, because of stalinist reactionaries.\n\nBeing a staunch ally of Khrushchev, his political career soon turned around for the better.\n\nAlthough he was never one of Khrushchev's protégés, Kosygin quickly moved up the CPSU party ladder.\n\nBy the time of the Sputnik 1 and 2 satellite launches in late 1957 he had already become an official of the State Planning Commitee and was made a candidate member of the Politburo.\n\nBy 1960 Kosygin was promoted to the State Planning Commitee chairmanship and became Khrushchev's First Deputy Premier.\n\nThis changed his life significantly because as First Deputy Premier Kosygin traveled around the world, mostly on trade missions,\n\nto countries such as North Korea, India, Argentina and Italy.\n\nAs Gagarin and Titov where orbiting the world, Kosygin was rewarded with his old seat in the Politburo during the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nJust a year later he was already the Soviet spokesman for improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nThen Kosygin play important role in \"The Turmoil of 64\".\n\nBy 1964 Khrushchev was consider unfit to rule by Communist Hard-liners and Stalinist in the Politburo, do his reform actions\n\nThere effort was doomed from beginning to two decisive factors:\n\nBack on February 23rd 1961 the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Lenoid Brezhnev died after his diplomatic plane was shot down over Algeria. (what is commonly referred as the Brezhnev incident.)\n\nAfter that Khrushchev appointed Anastas Mikoyan to the position. Who now protected Khrushchev together with Kosygin and Nikolai Podgorny\n\nAlso the Powerful Minister of Defence Rodion Malinovsky, a personal Friend of Khrushchev, supported him with Red Army against the Hard-liners\n\nAnd the Hard-liners had no the right candidate due to old age.\n\nBut Khrushchev face also criticism from his Friends and allies like Nikolai Podgorny,\n\nMikoyan, Podgorny, Kosygin and Malinovsky was able to influence Khrushchev to rethink some of his crazy ideas and proposals.\n\nKosygin influence was responsible for a series of successful economic reform that led to the improvement of living standard for the Soviet people.\n\nUnlike some Stalinist Deviants claim, he was not acting as a revisionist, but simply applying Marxism-Leninism in a unique and creative way.\n\nHis democratic succession on Khrushchev as Premier and General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1971.\n\nand policies enacted strengthend socialism through Market forces, rather than reviving Capitalism as counter-revolutionary stalinist and bourgeois elements have claimed.\n\nThe thriving Socialist Market Economy of our motherland that exists to this day is a testament to Khrushchev and Kosygin's early work in this period...\n\nExcept from Chapter 2: Red Rise\n\n- Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin: A Short Biography, by The Institute of Marxism-Leninism, CPSU Central Committee © 2006\n\nNew Rockets In USSR\n\nThe US side of the Story...\n\nIn May 1962, the CIA noticed on reconnaissance satellite pictures, an increase of activity at OKB-1 factory, also with the begining of construction work on Baikonur and Pelsectsk\n\nAt Baikonur they erected a huge building in size 720 ft by 343 ft (220 by 125 meters)\n\nIt was connected by Railway to series of Launch Pads built North East of that new complex. Two pads were huge,\n\nThen in 1964 a US reconnaissance satellite picture, how out this gigantic hall roledl out a puny Rockets to launch pad\n\nThe CIA reconnaissance group got laughing fits about this, the rocket analyst of CIA din’t laugh. That was a completely New Soviet Rocket !\n\nConical in form, about 106 ft (33 meter) it was launch successful in August 1964 according NORAD.\n\nJuly 1965 the CIA reconnaissance group stop laughing, as a new bigger rocket was rolled out of that hall, double in length as „Puny Rocket“, That was more serious.\n\nIn 1966 to surprise of World Press, the Soviet presented a complete Vostock Rocket on Biggin Hill International Air Fair[1]\n\nLabeling it a discontinued model, now it was a sure thing the Soviet were replacing their Launch rockets with something new.\n\n1966 October after series of Test launches the two new rocket got official named by Soviet TASS[2]\n\nThe smaller was official label as „Soyuz Rocket“ as it launch the New Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nThe bigger was called „Proton“ after the astronomy satellites with same name, it had launch four times.\n\nFinally in 1967 the CIA reconnaissance group stared to gape on a Picture, this time the soviets pulled out a Huge Rocket… one in size of a Saturn V !\n\nThe Soviet side of the Story…\n\nIn 1961 Sergei Korolev had proposed a Modular rocket family simply called „Nositjel“ (Launch vehicle) were the upper stage function as launch rocket.\n\nthe Soviet Space Agency (MoM) studied the proposal together with Chelomei Universal Rocket and R-56 Booster by Yangel\n\nBut the two were refused to huge amount of Toxic fuel used on those rockets, leading to higher cost compare to Korolev „Launcher“, who could use the existing propellant facility at the launch sites.\n\nSo in 1962 became „Nositjel 1/2/3“ official the new launcher Family of USSR.\n\nIn 1963 Sergei Khrushchev finalized the engine specification for N1/2/3 rocket to be build by the OKB-276.\n\nUsing for N3, the NK-9 from R-9 with 392kN and for N2 and N1 the NK-15 with 2120 kN thrust,\n\nThis would reduce the risk of Pogo[3] on Launcher by minimised the first stage engine 6 to 16\n\nBy launching the smaller version of „Nositjel“ the N3 and N2, it would reduce the Test program allot instead of 12 test launches with the complete N1 proposed by Vasily Mishin.\n\nActually each model would do 4 test flights, eliminating possible delays true N1 construction.\n\nwith success in 1965 the N3 called „Soyuz“ and 1966 N2 called „Proton“ went into service.\n\nbut on 14 January 1966 the program undergo trouble as Sergai Paviovich Korolev died.\n\nIn March the Politburo designated Sergei Khrushchev as new Head of OKB-1 [4]\n\n[1] The soviet union boycott the Paris Air Show from 1961 to 1982 because of the Brezhnev Incident.\n\n[2] Telegraph Agency of soviet Union, Is for distribution of internal and international news for all Soviet media.\n\n[3] POGO is term for a dangerous self-excited combustion oscillation in liquid fuel rockets, causing in extrem situation the destruction of the vehicle during flight.\n\n[4] Vasily Mishin's cynical comment on this decision: „well we don’t need to replace the Initials...“\n\nSoyuz vs Apollo part 1\n\nIt's interesting to see that adversary opponent of Moon Race, came to same solution - Lunar orbital Rendezvous -\n\nbut this imply rendezvous and docking technology, what NASA master in the Gemini program.\n\nand Soviet had still to test this with Soyuz space craft\n\nThe failure of Voskhod-4 was a wakeup call for OKB-1,\n\nSergei Khrushchev made clear that manned Soyuz will only fly it all system were \"Fool proof and Incapable of errors“\n\nMuch to anger of his father who was eager for new space records.\n\nKosmos 133 was first flight of Soyuz 7K-OK, it had to dock automatically later with Kosmos 134\n\nHowever Kosmos 133's attitude control system malfunctioned, resulting in rapid consumption of orientation fuel, leaving it spinning at 2 rpm.\n\nAfter heroic efforts by ground control and five attempts at retrofire over two days, the craft was finally brought down for a landing on its 33rd revolution.\n\nDue to the inaccuracy of the reentry burn, the capsule would land in China.\n\nThe self destruct system was thought to have destroyed the ship on November 30, 1966.\n\nBut stories persisted over the years of the Chinese having a Soyuz capsule in their possession.\n\nKosmos 134 had different fate, it became soviet 'the day we launched the escape tower' of Mercury program.\n\nThe Soyuz rocket not ignited, a launcher shutdown was commanded. following inspections of Rocket.\n\n27 minutes after the original launch attempt, the Soyuz launch escape system ignite, pulling the Soyuz away from the booster, igniting The third stage fuel tanks, leading to an explosion that severely damaged the pad and killed at least one person and injured many others!\n\nKosmos 140 experienced attitude control problems due to a faulty star sensor resulting in excessive fuel consumption.\n\nThe spacecraft couldn't keep the required orientation towards the sun to keep the solar panels illuminated.\n\nDespite all of these problems the spacecraft remained controllable.\n\nAn attempted maneuver on the 22nd revolution still showed problems with the control system.\n\nIt malfunctioned yet again during retrofire, leading to a steeper than planned uncontrolled ballistic re-entry.\n\nThe re-entry capsule itself had depressurised on separation from the service module due to a fault in the base of the capsule.\n\nA 300 mm hole burned through in the heat shield during re-entry.\n\nSergei Khrushchev order that crew had to wear pressure suits on board what reduce crew from 3 to 2 cosmonauts.\n\nKosmos 156 was again a disaster, one solar panel failed to unfold, do bad weather the launch of Kosmos 157 was canceled.\n\nbut it became worst op on landing the main parachute did not unfold, the unmanned capsule crash into the ground.\n\nMoM state commission found 203 issue with Soyuz spacecraft in investigation of Kosmos flights.\n\nA manned L1 circumlunar flyby by the 50th Anniversary of the October Revolution was now completely out of the question\n\nand at best they might be able to have the earth orbit Soyuz 7K-OK ready for a dual manned rendezvous/docking.\n\nNikita Khrushchev was furious on this bad news.\n\nIn Mean time the first unmanned Soyuz 7K-L1 flights under Zond 4 & 5, they performed better.\n\nFinally Kosmos 186 and 187 was successful, two Soyuz 7K-OK flew and dock automatic and return save, despite issues\n\nSergei Khrushchev order the first manned flight would include a Rendezvous, even that failed there would two Soyuz to test in space.\n\nSoyuz 1 launched on November 27, 1967 crewed by Sergei Komarov, Vladimir Shatalov\n\nWhile Soyuz 2 launched on November 30, 1967 crewed by Yevgeny Khrunov, Aleksei Yeliseyev.\n\nThe Rendezvous was performed entirely automatically by the IGLA-system on board Soyuz 1.\n\nAfter the first attempt failed (a fly-by at a distance of 900 m), the second attempt succeeded\n\nHowever, this docking was not entirely successful either - the modules were mechanically docked, but not electrically.\n\nAlso, the maneuver had cost more fuel than anticipated.\n\nKhrunov and Komarov in spacesuits made spacewalk so they could transfer vehicles and land with Komarov,\n\nthe world's first crew-exchange in spaceflight history.\n\nAfter 3.5 hours of joint flight, the spacecraft parted on a command sent from the earth and continued to orbit separately.\n\nBoth made a soft landing in the Soviet Union.\n\nRed China's New Strong Man\n\nThe Relationship between USSR and China deteriorated in 1960 during Soviet state visit to China.\n\nThanks to Nikita Khrushchev's unlucky metaphor about how \"you need to change worn old shoes“,\n\nReferring to China's authoritarian form of communism similar to Stalinism, need to reformed.\n\nThis was translated into the Chinese metaphor of \"you need to get rid of the old whore“,\n\nMao Zedong considered this a major insult on his person.\n\nUntil 1966 the USSR and Chinese relations deteriorated to the worst they could be.\n\nNikita Khrushchev economic reforms which moved the USSR to less emphasis heavy Industry toward consumer goods by individual enterprises,\n\nin addition to the increasing amount of free political criticism and changing attitudes associated with the Khrushchev Thaw.\n\nWas interpreted by conservative Maoist as treason toward communism and was denounced as \"reactionary\" and \"revisionist\"\n\nBut Mao had other problems, the Chinese politburo wanted to remove him from power, because of a series of disastrous programs ordered by Mao\n\nAnd the current situation between USSR and China, with the USSR and US's relations improving despite the situation in Vietnam.\n\nIn 1966 Mao Zedong found a Solution to that: The Cultural Revolution\n\nOfficial a Movement by groups of fanatic young people (Red Guards) operate under Mao orders, against authorities at all levels in China.\n\nMao Zedong wanted to eliminate his political enemies, special the reformist, but the situation escalated into a civil war in China and went out control.\n\nAs in industrial City of Wuhan, Red Guards started to fights under each other!\n\nBeginning in 1967 it went so bad that that Mao Zedong had to fly personal to Wuhan to deal with situation.\n\nIt was a certain Irony that Mao Zendong was killed there in shoot out between rivals Red Guards fraction!\n\nThe News of Mao dead let to the \"30 Day Crisis“ a battle over control of People’s Republic of China.\n\nLike Mao Widow, Jiang Qing and three other High rang official operating as \"Gang of Four“ trying to take over the Chinese politburo but failed.\n\nThe winner of Crisis became the Chinese People’s Liberation Army under commando of Marshall Lin Biao, who restored law and order in China.\n\nLin Biao ruled with hard hand over China and cleaned up Mao Zedong's followers and Red Guards,\n\nMade necessary reforms, leading China out it’s political isolation.\n\nHis top priority in 1968 was the Vietnam war and reconciling with the USSR, with Success, Kosygin was very receptive to reconciliation with China.\n\nOn North Vietnam, Lin Biao supported them with weapons, material and Advisors, including massive buildup of Troops at North Vietnamese border.\n\nHe also started an arms race to build an ICBM that could hit the USA,\n\nAfter the death of Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh in the beginning of 1968, the resulting Power struggle under the north Vietnam leadership,\n\nThat was won by Pro China forces in the North Vietnamese Politburo!\n\nThe beginning of the Sino-North Vietnamese alliance\n\nNow the USA faced a similar scenario, they had during the Korean War,\n\nDanger of south Vietnam being over run by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. But this time they got Nuclear weapons !\n\nFor US Capitol Hill \"The Chinese Nightmare“ started.\n\nNotes:\n\nKhrushchev's remaining in office and his continuation of reforms, rapprochement to the West and the rise of a new class of market reformers in the USSR like Alexei Kosygin.\n\nLead to a greater backlash in China and the Cultural Revolution being even more violent than in our time\n\nMao Zedong is killed and Lin Biao comes to power as a result.\n\nHe attempted a coup against Mao in OTL which failed in 1971. The Gang of Four also attempted a coup which also failed in our time.\n\nThere is no Maoism movement, Left Radicals orientating now on Ho Chi Minh movement and there way of political combat!\n\nThe Moon Race Heats Up\n\nUSA and USSR were building the Biggest Rocket ever know it was time to Test them\n\nThe N1-L3 Rocket made its first launch on July 6, 1967.\n\nAfter lift off problems started as engine n°12 suffered problems, in response the autopilot KORD wrongly shutdown a working engine on the opposed side!\n\n54.5 seconds after launch the KORD reported engines 11, 12 and 13 were shutting down and a rise of temperature show there was a fire in first Stage.\n\nThen 68.87 second after launch the fire burned the wire harness of engine bay, KORD shot down all engines of first stage, crashing the rocket down range while the launch escape tower rescued the boilerplate crew capsule.\n\nThe failure analysis was difficult, one problem was KORD's faulty plotting, after Engine 12 went in trouble,\n\nanother mystery was what happened to engine 11, 12 and 13 and where had the fire started ?\n\nFlight data show that engine 12's turbo pump suddenly started violently vibrating at 51 second,\n\nfollowed by the turbo pumps of engine 11 snd 13.\n\nThe Soviet Academy of sciences independent investigation board had this theory:\n\nThat liquid oxygen line were too brittle because, they had use much with cooler propellant than originally designed.\n\nIt ruptured under the harsh conditions of launch and the pogo oscillations produce by the engines.\n\nThe liquid oxygen poured out onto the running engine starting the fire.\n\nMeanwhile the engine turbo pumps started running dry leading to violent vibrations, beginning the fatal chain reaction which lead to the destruction of N1-L3\n\nIt was a bad surprise for OKB-1, before the launch of the next N1 they had to replace the Stage's liquid oxygen lines, overwork KORD and install better Pogo dampers. the N1-L4 was pulled out production and was scraped.\n\nOn November 9th 1967 the Saturn V successfully performed it's first flight,\n\nBut the rest of Program was not running good, the Apollo modification delay manned Test flight Apollo 7 to autumn 1968,\n\nThe Lunar Module was also facing considerable delays, threatening the 1970 deadline !\n\nThe First LM prototype was Tested in space with Apollo 5, but was not Manned ready do issues with flight computers.\n\nApril 4th, 1968. the Second test of Saturn V ended in problems: massive Pogo, failure of J-2 engines and failed restart of the 3 stage !\n\nWhile NASA start debug the Saturn V The Soviets made another Launch attempt on July 1968 with the N1-L5.\n\nThe flight went good until the 104 second were engine 4 having trouble and a overzealous safety range officer activated, the N1 self-destruct mechanism. The failure analyst Repot showed clearly that despite the failure of engine 4,\n\nthe N1-L5 could have bring the payload in lower orbit had safety range officer not acted.\n\nOn November 1968 the N1-L6 was launched despite problems with KROD and premature stage separation, the payload reached Low Earth Orbit\n\n25 hours after it’s launch, the unmanned L3-Complex test model made the Trans Lunar Injection toward the Moon.\n\n101 hours later the L3-Complex reach the moon where... nothing happened.\n\nThe Block-D failed to re-ignite as the L3-Complex passed by the moon and returned back to Earth on it's circumlunar trajectory.\n\nIn mean time the Americans notice a large number of Proton rocket launches to moon\n\nThere were heavy payload in two category: lunar fly by with return to Earth, the other lunar landings\n\nIn June 1968 one of Heavy probes manage to land safely on the lunar surface.\n\nThat Probe transmitted signals on 130 and 190 kHz, much to surprise of CIA analysts, it was of TV Cameras.\n\nTheir new probe was a remotely controlled rover ! It was intriguing for CIA analysts and NASA engineers to secretly watch on their equipment, the attempts by controllers in USSR to drive the Rover in search of... something.\n\nAfter it reach a flat area it stop and turned its cameras off, switching to a 1000 kHz signal that repeated itself until it was interrupted by The lunar night.\n\nThe Soviet labeled this probe as Lunokhod 1, another Triumph of USSR.\n\nFirst Men around the Moon\n\nNASA was in dilemma, the Saturn V underwent modification, Apollo 7 finally ready for manned flight for October 1968,\n\nBut Lunar Module was not ready for manned test flight, electrical problems and issues with the flight computers.\n\nGrumman believed the LM could be ready for manned Testing in begin 1969 !\n\nWhat to do ?\n\nThere were several option: wait until 1969 for Apollo 8 and test LM, launch Apollo 8 with Spy Sat Camera to moon\n\nBut that would take too much time and money, needed for Lunar landing.\n\nFinally Frank Bormann proposed to NASA to launch Apollo 8 without LM to moon testing the Third Saturn V and Apollo CSM.\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center schedule that Saturn V will ready for December 1968 launch of Apollo 8.\n\nMeanwhile the CIA was keeping a close eye on the activities of the Soviets. there had series of failures\n\nThe first N1 test flight endet in Disaster, their new Soyuz spacecraft had seems serious issue, also their Zond probes.\n\nAlso two explosion on launch pad show the Soviets has serious problems !\n\nThe CIA assessment was that USSR would unlikely send a Human to Moon in 1968, with high probability during 1969.\n\nBut Soviets catch up with success of Soyuz 1 to 4 with two docking,\n\nNow they planned another docking with Soyuz 5&6 and Soyuz 7 the first cislunar flight !\n\nOfficial the unmanned Zond 9, the preparation wenn secretly, the KGB found creative ways to fool the CIA with false information.\n\nOn October 11 launched Soyuz 5 and 6 they made almost failed the rendezvous and docking by using too much propellants.\n\nThem on November 10, 1968 Zond 9 is launch with Aleksei Leonov and Oleg Makarov on a Proton rocket\n\nOnce the Trans Lunar Injection was successful the TASS announcement that Soyuz 7 is on way to Moon\n\nWhile world press went hysterical, the flight to Moon was quite uneventful for Crew\n\nTheir problem was to ware there spacesuit true there 7 days mission\n\nOn 14 November 1968, Soyuz 7 passt the Moon at a minimum distance of 2420 km\n\nAs capsule return behind the moon, Leonov quote to the world the now famous phrase by the Russian father of the Space Age\n\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky.\n\nMan will not always stay on Earth;

Paine became new Administrator of NASA.\n\nAnd continue the Countdown for Apollo 8 and prepared Apollo 9 to 11.\n\nAt last Apollo 7 flight went well for Hardware, but not for Astronauts who were in conflict with overeager Mission Control.\n\nWerner Von Braun got the bugs out Saturn V, While Rocketdyne worked hard to find the Issue with J-2 engines,\n\nGrumman completed LM-3 for Apollo 9 flight, but testing show new problems with electrical system.\n\nOn December 21, 1968 Apollo 8 was launch, the Saturn V worked as planned.\n\nit's enter as first manned spacecraft Lunar orbit, something the Soyuz 7 was unable to do !\n\nOn 24 December the crew made a broadcast, were commander Bormann read out \"Book of Genesis\" from the Bible.\n\nThis was later maliciously commented in the Pravda: \"The Americans begging their God to win the Moon Race\"\n\nOn 27 December the crew of Apollo 8 made safe landing in pacific.\n\nThe Crew was welcome with ticker-tape parade in USA,\n\nWhile the New York Times comment cynical \"Were is the ticker-tape parade for moon Cosmonauts ?!\"\n\nIn fact Leonov and Makarov were still hospitalised, confirmed by a teeth cursing Khrushchev.\n\nMoM had because of issue with Soyuz 7 canceled all Soyuz cislunar flights and focus launching Lunokhod to moon.\n\nThomas Paine had to face political problems by Capitol Hill and new US President Richard Nixon.\n\nThose politician demanded a acceleration of Moon landing with Apollo 10.\n\nBut LM-3 and LM-4 were test article and not able for moon landing, while LM-5 was under completion.\n\nPaine explains that Apollo 9 and 10 are needed test flight to qualified the LM-5 for Apollo 11.\n\nOn March 3, 1969 Apollo 9 was launched and Lunar Modul Spider was tested successful.\n\nAlso successful was the fourth Test launch if N1 February.\n\nN1-L7 manage to bring unmanned Soyuz LOK and it's LK-lander in moon orbit and tested them remote.\n\nThis qualified the N1 Rocket for Manned Flight and got new designation: Luna\n\nThen the CIA discovers that Soviet rollout TWO N1 rockets and installed them on launch pads !\n\nUSA counter with launch of Apollo 10 to Moon orbit and test LM Snoopy, on May 18, 1969.\n\nThat test became almost a Disaster, the descent went well until the LM reached 14 km over lunar surface.\n\nAs the descent stage is separated, the LM accent stage start to react violently and to rotate,\n\nStafford and Cernam fought hard to stabilize the LM.\n\nThe two uttered several expletives until gaining control over Snoopy, close to the moment before the rotation became unrecoverable,\n\nAfter docking with Charlie Brown, they return to Earth and splash down in Pacific on May 26.\n\nSince January 1969 run the Countdown for Apollo 11, in May the Saturn V was fully assembled, tested, and rollout to Launch pad.\n\nThe Rocket was check and undergoes flight readiness test and on June 26 the Countdown Demonstration Test\n\nNow Only wait until Moon is right position for launch and that is July 16, 1969;\n\nOnly question was how far are the soviets ready to launch ?\n\nA Man on the Moon\n\nThis post is dedicated to a man, who off all, had the right to be first on the Moon...\n\nDuring 1967 and 1969 the Soviet tested there L3-complex in low orbit.\n\nFirst unmanned as Kosmos satellites, then manned Rendezvous with Soyuz, follow by Rendezvous with Lunniy korabl\n\nall went good (with some problems) except Soyuz 7 cislunar\n\nSoyuz 11 was another thing is was analog to Apollo 10, to bring the Lunniy korabl to moon and land it automatic on moon.\n\nOn June, 1969 the First Manned N1-L8 was launched, on board was Vladislav Volkov and Viktor Gorbatko.\n\nnearly perfect flight except that Block-D use almost too much fuel for Lunar orbit injection.\n\nBut they were able to ready the LK and send it to way to the surface, guides by a 1000 kHz signal emit by Lunokhod 2.\n\nWhile the CIA and NASA believed that Soyuz 11 was Soviet version Apollo 10, follow end of year by manned landing\n\nand Apollo 11 Launch was scheduled launch on 16 July, 1969.\n\nBut Soviet ministry of Space was cautious, they wasn't confident in the LK lander's reliability\n\nand weren't about to risk the life of their heroic lunar cosmonaut without redundancy.\n\nSo Soyuz 11 mission was to bring the Backup Lunniy korabl to it destination for flight of Soyuz 12\n\nAt 27 June as the Americans did the Countdown Demonstration Test with Apollo 11\n\nThe Soyuz-12 blasted off with Pavel Popovich and Vladimir Komarov.\n\nAfter it entered into a 200 km low earth orbit it remained there for 25 hours, checking the systems and uploaded new information for TLI\n\n28 June Soyuz 12 made it Trans Lunar Injection burn. It will need over 5 days to reach the Moon\n\nuntil Soyuz 12 entered an elliptical lunar orbit (150x50 km) at afternoon of the 2 July.\n\nOn 3 July the Crew located the Lunokhod 3 and LK-backup landing site.\n\nLOK pilot Pavel Popovich and Flight Engineer Vladimir Komarov prepared the landing procedure,\n\nthe L-3 complex lowered its orbit to 100 km by 20 km\n\nVladimir Komarov enter his Kerchet Spacesuit and began to EVA to the LK craft,\n\nHe entered it and started up its systems then detached the LK with its Block-D from the Load-baring structure cover and LOK\n\nKomarov used the Block-D last propellants reserves to brake out of Lunar orbit descending toward the surface,\n\nGuided by 1000 kHz signal radio beacon from Lunokhod 2.\n\n4000 meter over lunar surface Komarov jettison the Empty block-D and ignite the LK engines.\n\nOn July 4 1969 Vladimir Milhaylovich Komarov landed as First human in history on the Moon.\n\nOnly 177 meter near Lunokod 2 and 360 meter near LK-backup\n\nWhile Komarov prepared his EVA, Lunokhod 2 was reactivated and rolled toward the LK\n\nFilm by it’s TV cameras, Komarov exit the LK, erecting the Flag of USSR and saluting it,\n\nTelevised world wide by TASS with background music, the Soviet national anthem.\n\nFor a moment Komarov looked up at the Earth and said:\n\n\"Планета есть колыбель разума, но нельзя вечно жить в колыбели\"\n\nTranslation: \"Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot stay in the cradle forever\"\n\nAfter that Komarov pulled the DALS out the LK and deployed this Scientific equipment package near by.\n\nThen he collected samples of Lunar soil and rocks\n\nHe made several photos of his LK, the Lunokhod 2 which followed him via remote control and the LK-Backup at lunar horizon.\n\nAfter 3 hours of exhausting EVA, he made a report over TV camera outside LK and return into in for the first meal on the Moon and resting.\n\nWhile he was eating something happened as he heard a loud BANG follow by hissing sound, lucky Komarov was inside his Spacesuit with faceplate up, which he close very fast.\n\nIt was not the Pressurized cosmonaut compartment, but the pressurized avionic container which depressurized !\n\nand that was even worse, the avionic was cooled by nitrogen gas which ventilated through containers, now that it was depressurized, The electronics started to overheat fast and was now failing.\n\nKomarov report what happen before the LK radios went dead.\n\nMission Control in Kaliningrad, react in turmoil and consternation at the news, now everything lies on the flight control crew of the Lunakhod 2 in getting Komarov to backup LK. But the question was whether his LK-backup had a similar problem?\n\nKomarov inspected his LK, took photos of the depressurized avionic container and took the Sample container to Lunokhod 2.\n\nand climbed on top of Rover, which was driven as fast as they could toward the LK-Backup.\n\nKomarov radioed home with the backup LK and without hesitation initiated the ascent order and took off a mere 4 hours after initially arriving on the Moon.\n\nNow it was the turn of LOK Pilot Pavel Popovich, because the LK had a passive rolle in Rendezvous and docking,\n\nit was the task of Popovich to manage to catch up the LK and dockt with it,\n\nKomarov made his final EVA with his samples and Photos back to the LOK.\n\nOn 5 July at 10:59 the LOK jettison it’s Utility module with it dockt LK and return to Earth.\n\nat 8 July around 10:00 the Descent Module entered the Earth's atmosphere for a skip maneuver and re-entered for landing on USSR.\n\nAftermath:\n\nVladimir Milhaylovich Komarov was awarded a second time with \"The Hero of The Soviet Union“ and \"order of Lenin“.\n\nThe flight control crew of Lunokhod 2 was awarded with \"The Hero of The Soviet Union“ and \"order of Lenin“ for rescue of Komarov.\n\nThe LK malfunction was do to a faulty seal on the pressurized avionic container, which caused the depressuring, reason was a faulty acceptance test at the point of manufacture.\n\nActing General Sectary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Alexei Kosygin announced the official Soviet program of manned Exploration of Solar system called: Galaktika (Russian for Galaxy)\n\nComprised of further Moon expeditions and a Soviet Space Station program beginning in the 1970s.\n\nIn USA the disappointment was great, on their National holiday,\n\nthe commies landed on Moon first and made spectacularly heroic events wordy of a Hollywood Movie.\n\nNixon's first reaction was to fire NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine and and lucking for New Administrator\n\nNow the responsibility lay on Nixon to react to the Soviet victory and challenge.\n\nOn 16 July Apollo 11 lifted off to the Moon.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThis was original written in July 2015\n\nFor All Mankind was broadcast November 1, 2019\n\nThe Political Fallout\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmTddEBVRrM\n\nNixon Reaction on what happened...\n\nHe not only fired NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, Nixon throw him to the wolves in Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd look for way to counter Soviet success in the Space Race, but for that he needed the right man to run NASA,\n\nA man he could trust and is a Republican:\n\nCongressman George H. W. Bush endorsed Nixon in the 1968 Republican Party presidential primaries,\n\nNixon considered selecting Bush as his running mate in the 1968 presidential election, but he chose Spiro Agnew instead.\n\nNow he offers Bush the post of NASA Administrator !\n\nNASA react baffled on the News, but they got a experience politician who was determent to his job.\n\nIn mean time Apollo 11 made it moon landing, Neil Armstrong became first American on Moon follow by Edwin Aldrin,\n\nThey return save to Earth and got a ticker-tape parade in Washington D.C. but like Aldrin say much later in Interview:\n\nTo be the second, is not like to be number one...\n\nIn September 1969, Vice president Spiro Agnew presented the Space Task Group result on Study what NASA had to do next.\n\nThere called it, The Intergraded Program Plan short IPP proposed in three different program options.\n\nThey all involved the same hardware set but with a different timetable and annual development/operating cost overtime.\n\nThe Option A as being too expensive, in total over $500 Billion spent over 30 years.\n\nit would have include six Space Station, a Moon base and Mars base in 1990s, with hundreds of Astronauts working in space.\n\nWhile the Option C like c for \"cheap\" with $25 billion, could not fulfilling the national needs to beat the Soviets in Space.\n\nIt would after Apollo program is ended, focus on a Reusable Space Shuttle and a low orbit Space station, that launch by the Shuttle.\n\nThe Option B as being the obvious choice that balances both cost and capability: $50 Billion\n\nReusable Space Shuttle with Space Tug, Two Space station, with option for Nuclear Shuttle if Approved.\n\na Lunar Orbit station with outpost on moon and as option 2 Mars Expedition end of 1980s if Approved.\n\nIn total would work 36 to 48 men in space in 1990s\n\nThe only person who believed that Option A would be taken was Spiro Agnew.\n\nNixon took Option B because gave the USA the option to counter the Soviets in Space,\n\nNASA Administrator Bush proposed that Apollo program should continue so long Soviets made Lunar landings.\n\nand demanded to restart the Saturn V and Apollo hardware production so fast as possibly for 1973 use.\n\nNixon authorised that together with Apollo Orbital Workshops.\n\nNASA was looking for Name for IPP option B and the naming rules were straightforward.\n\nCandidate names were to be simple and easily pronounced, not refer to living persons, neither duplicate nor closely resemble other NASA or non-NASA space program names, be translatable into the languages of the International Partners,\n\nand have neither ambiguous nor offensive meanings in the International Partner languages.\n\nIn addition, acronyms were to be avoided. So the name \"Odyssey\" was chosen.\n\nOdyssey through the US House of Representatives\n\nThe news of NASA's Odyssey program hit the US media like a bomb.\n\nSome journalist remembering Stanley Kubrick science fiction movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" compared the program to the similarly, named film while other point out the gigantic cost of $100 billion something similar to the ending Vietnam War !\n\nAnd labeled Odyssey as Megalomaniac madness, even speaking of a NASA Empire.\n\nIn the latest Gallup Poll 53% of US citizens were against the Apollo program !\n\nWhile Spiro Agnew was booed when he spoke of the Odyssey program in public.\n\nWith the media hype the House of Representatives started to react.\n\nThey cut down NASA 1970 budget 17.31% lower compare to year 1969.\n\nJoseph Karth (Dem) member of House committee on Science, Space and Technology\n\nStarted to criticizes NASA in public \"for miss-using Odyssey for getting to Mars only\".\n\nIn the spring of 1971 Krath tried several times to issue a bill to block the financing of the combination program,\n\nthe votings ended in a stalemate.\n\nWalter Mondale (Dem) tried in July, to past a more radical bill.\n\nHe proposed to shut down NASA manned Space Flight activity and close Marshall Space Flight Center and Johnson Space Center,\n\nWith the argument that USA had lose the Moon Race, and that it better to spend the money on social welfare programs.\n\nHis proposal was rejected with 32 to 28 Votes.\n\nCaspar Weinberger (Rep), newly responsible for the US federal budget, tried unsuccessful to cancel the Apollo and Odyssey program.\n\nAt NASA rang the alarm bells, Odyssey was in danger of getting canceled by US politicians !\n\nAdministrator Bush deal with new hostile situation.\n\nLuckily the planned NASA budget cuts by Representatives were stop by Nixon's vetos.\n\nNASA started to Lobby for the program, focusing on Space shuttle, Space Station and Manned lunar missions,\n\nendeavouring not mention future manned Mars missions.\n\nIn same time the USAF look into a joint venture in the Shuttle program which would reduce NASA's portion of the costs of Odyssey.\n\nBush made harsh cut in NASA programs like Apollo Application Program, scaling it down to just tow Skylab\n\nwhile canceling the Apollo-Soyuz program all together\n\nAt the same time the US Aerospace Industry acquired the best Lobbyists in Washington D.C.\n\nbecause even the scaled down version of proposed Odyssey program would bring them even more revenue than the Apollo program!\n\nThen came the news the Soviet would increase their manned space efforts under the Galaktika program.\n\nFinally Congress react, instead of immediately accepting Odyssey in the beginning, they pushed for more Apollo missions.\n\nNASA could restart the Saturn V and IB production.\n\nIn the Senate the battle restart, Walter Mondale claimed that Odyssey was a waste of money.\n\nCongress voted for Odyssey in march 1972, but with budget only for more Apollo Missions, the Space Station & Space Shuttle\n\nwith an eventual lunar base in the early 1980s (utilising the Shuttle's chemical \"Space Tug\" and a reusable orbit to orbit Nuclear Shuttle) In total $50 billion for next 10 years (with a peak annual budget of $5.5 billion).\n\nFor Von Braun and his colleagues this decision was a secret victory. With the nuclear shuttle, space tug, space shuttle, space station and Saturn booster, the option would be available to any future president who wished to send humans to Mars.\n\nThe only item not funded would be the Mars Excursion Module (MEM). If funding for the MEM were approved in FY 1976, the first landing would be in 1983. If the MEM were approved in 1978, the first landing would be in 1985 and so on.\n\nThis wasn't publically discussed as spending even more money on an MEM wasn't politically viable at the time.\n\nSome Representatives even Democrats began considering Walter Mondale as \"treacherous\",\n\nA simple majority shared opinion the USA had to counter the Soviet Space activity,\n\nafter nearly losing every space milestone to the Soviets from Sputnik to the Moon.\n\nDespite warning of his colleagues and allies, Mondale issued until 1973 several bills to stop the financing of Odyssey,\n\nThey were each rejected with a narrow majority.\n\nBecause US House of Representatives had other problems:\n\nFBI director John Edgar Hoover died, Mark Felt become his successor, Spiro Agnew resigned,\n\nPresident Nixon took Gerald Ford as Vice President,\n\nFor 1971 to 1976 the financing of Odyssey was save for moment, again thanks to Nixon's Vetos.\n\nIn 1975 the first Golden Fleece Award is awarded by William Proxmire (Dem) to NASA Odyssey program,\n\nbecause \"it launched billions of public dollars into Space\".\n\nA Program called Galaktika\n\nIn November 1967 there was a special meeting of MoM,\n\nwith the Soviet Academy of Science, OKB directors, high ranking officials of the Military and the Politburo ministers.\n\nTheir goal was to determine the future of Soviet Space program after the manned Lunar landing for coming five-years plans.\n\nThe Military wanted low orbit manned space station for reconnaissance, to counter the USAF MOL program.\n\nAlso the Academy of Science was interesting in manned space station for science in space.\n\nSo they came to common Agreement and it was authorised under name \"Salute Study\"\n\nCodename under civilian OS-7k and military OSP-7k\n\nFirst flights had to happen in the beginning of the Ninth five-Year Plan 1971-1975,\n\nwith extension of the program during the Tenth five-Year Plan 1976-1981 if successful.\n\nThe next point was the limitation of the LOK/LK system in landing one cosmonaut on Moon surface.\n\nThe Academy of Science was eager to send geologists to the Moon.\n\nSergei Khrushchev announced the 7K-SM concept, which could replace the current Soyuz LOK/LK design in 1970s\n\nas the L3M a Three man for moon and as Six man spacecraft 7K-SM for low orbit.\n\nWhile Vladimir Barmin proposed the construction of a manned lunar base.\n\nThose Lunar projects were authorized, combine under name \"Columbus Study“,\n\nFirst flight had to happen in the beginning of the Tenth five-Year Plan 1976-1981\n\nNext point was demand of the Academy of Science of manned Mars/Venus missions.\n\nIn case the Soviets lost the Moon race with the Americans,\n\nThey need something impressive to counter, Cosmonauts on Mars would be the thing they need.\n\nBesides, even if they beat the Americans to the Moon, it would make an interesting long term goal.\n\nThe 7K-SM concept as L3M needed an upgraded N1 rocket with Hydrogen Engines in the upper stages anyway.\n\nThis could be use to launch heavy interplanetary spaceship parts into low earth orbit.\n\nBut it needed High Power Rocket engines, either Nuclear thermal or Nuclear Electric.\n\nThis project study were authorised under name \"Alita Study\", the first step would specify the needed hardware during Ninth five-Year Plan 1971-1975\n\nIf selected as Program, Hardware R&D construction start in Ten five-Year Plan 1976-1981,\n\nThe First Aelita mission would then hopefully fly during the end of the Eleventh five-Year Plan 1981-1985.\n\nWhat had to be build for Mars and Venus exploration probes was also defined.\n\nThe first Probes would already fly during eighth five-Year Plan 1966-1970.\n\nA International participation and cooperation program called Interkosmos, provided Instruments for Soviet Space Probe.\n\nPossible option of bring astronauts from allies and other socialist nation to OS-7k space Station.\n\nThe entire Planning of Human exploration of the Earth Orbit, Moon, Venus and Mars was combined under name Galaktika (Galaxy).\n\nOne copy of the meeting's conclusions made an extraordinary journey in 1970.\n\na Dosier ripped in pieces, it landed into a waste paper basket in a MoM office,\n\nSalvaged partially by a cleaning lady [1] working for CIA, over Moscow US embassy to Unites states of America to CIA HQ in Langley.\n\nFootnotes\n\nOKB = Opytnoye Konstruktorskoye Byuro, meaning Experimental Design Bureau.\n\n[1] Allot of the best spies are cleaning ladies at the enemy offices, the German invented this practice in 19 century…\n\nApollo 12: Last spaceflight of the decade\n\nNovember 14th 1969\n\nBeing the last mission of the year, the engineers on Apollo 12 wanted to make sure this mission count.\n\nSince Soviet were not launching do issue with there Lunniy korabl.\n\nThis mission marked the second manned lunar landing of the Apollo program and rendezvous with Surveyor 3 probe,\n\nLaunching on schedule on November 14th 1969, the Saturn V was taking off during a rainstorm.\n\n36 seconds after lift-off, the vehicle triggered a lightning discharge through itself and down to the earth through the Saturn's ionized plume.\n\nProtective circuits on the fuel cells in the service module falsely detected overloads and took all three fuel cells offline,\n\nAlong with much of the CSM instrumentation. A second strike at 52 seconds after launch knocked out the \"8-ball\" attitude indicator.\n\nThe telemetry stream at Mission Control was garbled.\n\nHowever, the Saturn V continued to fly correctly as the strikes had not affected Saturn V's Instrument Unit.\n\nwith quick manual override to backup the mission continue and Conrad and Alan Bean manage close landing near Surveyor 3\n\nCharles Conrad first word on moon were:\n\n\"Yippee ! did you see that commies ?, we can do spot on landing too !\".\n\nThis was televised nationwide to millions of people and was followed by a fit of coughing by Walter Cronkite on NBC.\n\nDuring 31 hours on Moon they conducted 3 EVA were several sample were taken also from Surveyor 3.\n\nWith both the color television film and the fantastic selfie photo next to Surveyor (with the LM easily seen in the background)\n\nApollo 12 was featured prominently in Time Magazine as a year end consolation for losing the Moon race.\n\nThe 1960s was a time of great change in social, political, technological and economic worldwide, but especially in the United States.\n\nThe decade began with a series of crisis: the Brezhnev Crisis, the Cuban crisis the Berlin Crisis,\n\nThe assassination of the President of the United States John F. Kennedy, the race riots, civil unrest, the Vietnam war etc.\n\nThe Vietnam War was a particularly shocking blow to the United States.\n\nAs the crisis following the death of Mao Zedong in China lead to increased militarism at Vietnam border,\n\nThe United States was forced to choose pullback and defeat or risk of a Korea-like conflict sparking an all out nuclear conflict.\n\nThankfully, Johnson chose the pullback although, with the prise that Republicans swept into the White House at decades end.\n\nIn USA racial barriers were broken as Martin Luther King Jr lead the civil rights movement,\n\nUltimately leading to the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 (abolishing Jim Crow & Segregation)\n\nBut not only in US but in Europe and East block happened changes\n\nAlexander Dubcek played a big role in reforming Czechoslovakia to create \"Socialism with a human face\".\n\nWhile East Germany would undergo a drastic changes in coming years, as Walter Ulbrich public critiqued the german Communist !\n\nIn West Germany the government face radical leftist Terrorist inspire by Vietcong.\n\nFrance had almost civil War in May 1968 as student riots let nationwide uprise !\n\nWhile group of environmentalist voted for armed combat. they will become the Rainbow Warriors\n\nPeople were look onwards on 1970s in hope and fear what would bring that new Decade ?\n\nThe 1970 April Moon mission\n\nThe problems of Soyuz 12's landing made overwork of the LK necessary, along with getting ready to launch for April 1970\n\nTo honor Vladimir Lenin's 100th Birthday.\n\nIn the mean time Apollo 12 made their precision landing in November 1969.\n\nBeginning in January 1970 Lunokhod 4 landed on the lunar surface, driving untill it they found what it was looking for and switched on The radio beacon, after an unusually long search time.\n\nSoyuz 13\n\nBeginning in April was launch of an N1 Luna rocket with Soyuz-13 on board Georgi Grechko and Aleksey Guarev\n\nfor Orbital mission and landing of the unmanned LK Backup.\n\nAfter Lunar Surface Mapping they return to earth passing by Apollo 13 on way to the Moon.\n\nGuarev on this unique encounter:\n\nIt is strange there was another manned complex on way to Moon, we knew there were out there, but not could see them.\n\nWhile they fighting for Survival on board, we fall back to Earth unable to help them..\n\nApollo 13\n\nOn April 11, Apollo 13 was launched to moon with Lovell, Mattingly, Haise, under a lack of interest with the US public and media.\n\nThe Saturn V showed a malfunction suffering from pogo oscillations and on second stage one of J-2 engine shut down too early.\n\n56 hours into the mission, Mattingly actived the stirring fans in Oxygen tank number 2 which then exploded!\n\nMattingly: Houston, we have a master alert here!\n\nCAPCOM: This is Houston, Say again, please\n\nMattingly: Houston, We’ve got MASTER ALERT!\n\nLovell: We’ve hav a MAIN B BUS UNDERVOLT!!!\n\nThe CSM main power system died in minutes, The Crew activated the LM and used it as a Lifeboat\n\nFrom now on Apollo 13 mission became a struggle for the survival of three Astronauts,\n\nSuddenly the world media show interest in Apollo mission.\n\nIn a Heroic effort NASA manage to bring the Crew safe back to Earth, calling it \"A successful failure\"\n\nApollo 13 showed America that Space flight were not easy.\n\nThe cause of the explosion was pin point to damaged Teflon isolation tape on electrical wires of the stirring fan inside the oxygen tank.\n\nThe Oxygen tanks were redesigned and moved farther apart, also a third oxygen tank and a emergency battery were installed,\n\nAlso started a program to replace the lithium hydroxide canister from LM and CSM with molecular sieve beds for future mission.\n\nThis delayed Apollo 14 mission to January 1971.\n\nThe next Luna rocket brought Soyuz-14 into the Moon's orbit with Vesily Lazarev and Oleg Makarov on board.\n\non 22 April 1970, Makorov landed 55 km away from Apollo 12 & Surveyor 3 Landing site confirmed by there ALSEP seismograph.\n\nThe Target was near Luna 5 crash site, a probe that failed to land on may 9, 1965.\n\nOleg Mekarov's first word on Moon were\n\nTo Honor Vladimir Lenin 100th Birthday, We came back to the Moon, to unravel it’s secrets.\n\nAfter that hedeployed the Scientific equipment package near by.\n\nThen he collected samples of the Lunar soil and rocks. after that he went for a pause inside the LK\n\nThen on the second EVA, he used the help of the Lunokhod 4 to drive to the Luna 5 crash site,\n\nMakorov study the man made crater, took samples of the probe's remains and lunar material in crater, helped by Lunokhod 4.\n\nHe made an excellent job by photographing the site and position were he took the samples\n\nAfter 7 hours the LK worked perfect and start of the moon back into orbit to rendezvous with LOK\n\nOn command of Ground control activated Backup LK to test it’s systems, it work perfectly just like the previous one.\n\nThanks to excellent work of Oleg Mekarov, the scientists could analyze the contamination by Probe propellants on Lunar soil.\n\nThis gave valuable information how Lunar soil get saturated with organic materials by rocket engines exhaust or asteroid impact.\n\nAlso change in tactic on Soviet landing, from now on the each lunar Soyuz mission would land a cosmonaut.\n\nThe Soviet Government made diplomatic requests to NASA for research data of the Apollo 12 and Surveyor 3.\n\nWhat let to political turmoil in Washington D.C. who were pushing for more Apollo missions,\n\nAllot of Anti communist were upset that NASA would help the \"Evil Ones\". To end this, President Nixon gave word of Command !\n\nReasoning that NASA is US government agency with free access to there research data, if the Soviet academy of sciences, gives free access to there research data.\n\nThe Soviets, they not only sent their research data and some Lunar sample,\n\nVasily Lazarev and Oleg Makarov even came to USA to gave a briefing on there mission at NASA.\n\nThis was the begining of \"Lunar Diplomacy\" between USA and Soviet Union beginning a short thaw period of Cold War known\n\nas 1970s Détente.\n\nApollo 14 and Soyuz 15\n\nThe Apollo 13 accident had a profound impact on the Space Race.\n\nThe accident highlighted the feeling that the American space program was struggling to compete with the Soviet Union and paradoxically increased support for the Manned Space Program by grabbing the public's attention and putting focus back on the Moon.\n\nThe heroic rescue efforts of NASA and the daring of the astronauts returned a sense of romanticism, adventure and danger to Manned Spaceflight.\n\nLike the names Shepard, Glenn, White, Grissom, Caprpenter, Armstrong, Aldrin & Collins, the names Lovell, Mattingly & Haise would no doubt be remembered.\n\nAs the budget battles raged on in Congress, NASA worked hard to improve the safety of the Command Service Module (CSM)\n\nand return America to the Moon as quickly as possible.\n\nApollo 14 was also the return of Alan Shepard to Space flight, after he lost his flight status do to Méniére's Disease in 1964.\n\nThis would also be his last flight.\n\nAlan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell and Stuart Roosa launched on 31 January 1971 as the crew of Apollo 14.\n\nJust as the previous H-Class missions it faced allot of problems, beginning with docking difficultly of CSM Kitty Hawk with LM Antares, Rossa had to ram CSM nose into the docking system of LM on the sixth attempt.\n\nDuring Lunar Descent the LM computer switch into ABORT mode, Mitchell with help of MIT manage reprogram the LM computer to believe ABORT had happen!\n\nAt the same time a bug caused malfunction of LM Radar altimeter, after cycling the Radar system breaker,\n\nThey gained control over LM in 5500 meter altitude.\n\nBecause of this Shepard and Mitchell could not make a pinpoint landing at planned site on the Fra-Mauro Highlands.\n\nIn lunar orbit Roosa faced new problem, one of CM windows became opaque, the one with the camera for mapping the lunar surface.\n\nShepard first words on moon were:\n\n\"And it's been a long way, but we're here\"\n\nDuring they first EVA, after deploying the ALSEP package they went with a \"Moon wheelbarrow\" for a walk.\n\nAfter 4 hours and 47 minutes the crew returned to LM and sleep until the next day.\n\nAt the end of a second EVA Shepard tried to play Golf, with a six iron head fixed on his lunar excavation tool and two golfballs.\n\nShepard manage to kick one golf ball for around 300 yards. In total for 42.28 kilograms on Lunars samples were collected in two EVA.\n\nOn February 9 landed Apollo 14 safe in pacific and they were the last to be quarantined.\n\nApollo 14 return to business and Media attention were good for NASA public image, despite the problems the crew faced.\n\nMeanwhile at NASA the future was looking promising. The Agency had scraps next H-Class mission (Apollo 15) and introduced\n\n4 J-Class missions for Apollo 15 to 18 while 5 more J-Class missions (Apollo 19 to 23) mission were under review as Saturn V production was reactivated. The following year in 1972, the Odyssey Program extension was approved as the Space Shuttle, Space Station, Lunar Base, Reusable Nuclear Shuttle and Chemical Space Tug were approved for development Phase B\n\non Soviet site...\n\nIn 1971 the Soviet Space Agency (MoM) had several Problems.\n\nOKB-1 ran on it's full capacity, building per year, Two Luna, dozens Protons and Soyuz rockets for MoM and Military needs.\n\nNext to that they built Spacecrafts like LOK-LK, Spying Satellites and were working on the advanced Soyuz 7K-SM,\n\nTherefore the Space Station program suffered under a lack of personnel and material.\n\nMoM had to take measures, they order of OKB-52 to help to build the Station on OKB-1 plans, it had certain irony that OKB-52 had to build now the space station.\n\nIt's boss Vladimir Chelomei had proposed his Almaz, a military space station to MoM,\n\nWhat had refused the proposal, because Chelomei insisted on development of the UR-500 rocket and TKS spacecraft for it.\n\nAlthough as the Boss of OKB-52 could be happy to do something for the Space race,\n\ninstead he went to Military complaining about the status of Salut program and promoted Almaz.\n\nMilitary-industrial Commission Chairman Ustinov was not amused at all, about Chelomei arrogant behavior and\n\nhis talking shit about his colleagues.\n\nMoM had enough of Chelomei escapade and threatened him to follow orders or OKB-52 would become subdivision of OKB-1 !\n\nThe Alita Study had serious setback by provoking a major nuclear disaster!\n\nA test run of Experimental Thermal nuclear engine RD-0410\n\nended in meltdown and massive contaminations of Semipalatinsk test site and near by Irtysh River!\n\nResponsible for Disaster was a engineer named Anatoly Stepanovich Dyatlov,\n\nThe investigation report found him guilty for \"criminal mismanagement of potentially dangerous device“.\n\nHe was sentenced to ten years in prison.\n\nMoM changed the Alita Study mission architecture in favor of Nuclear Electric Engines.\n\nNext to that the Soviet authority notice that soviet citizens had lost interest in the Soyuz Missions.\n\nSoyuz 15 with Lev Dyomin and Gennadi Sarafanov were launch to the Moon on 10 March 1971\n\nThis time to the north edge of Oceanus Procellarum at Luna 13 landing site.\n\nThe Soviet academy of sciences wanted geological data from several site of Oceanus Procellarum.\n\non 18 march, 1971 the LK landed near Lunokhod 5 right on target.\n\nGennadi Sarafanov first comment on landing site:\n\n\"This is so flat, like the Russian Plains…“\n\nThe LK had a new Features installed: A external TV color camera and Core sample drill, for taking 4 meter deep samples.\n\nBut Sarafanov was not lucky he hit in 3 meter depth a hard layer of magma, the drill ran out of it's operational life time of 60 minutes.\n\nSecond EVA went with Lunokhod 5 to Luna 13 landing site collection parts of probe to study the longtime exposure of Soviet hardware on Lunar Environment\n\nOn the end of this EVA Sarafanov make report in front of TV color camera about mission and make a surprise\n\nHe pulled a red sphere out LK and put on ground and kicked it.\n\n\"We Soviets prefer Football over decadent Golf…“\n\nThen he returned into the LK and took off after a seven hours surface mission, the crew returned 3 days later safely to earth.\n\nIn comparison of Soyuz 12 & Soyuz 14 and Apollo 12, the Soyuz 15 samples show\n\nthat Oceanus Procellarum is homogeneous mixture of incompatible elements (called by Americans) KREEP and low calcium pyroxene.\n\nWhat increase the mystery how Oceanus Procellarum is formed, special after Soyuz 15 discovery, a finding that even NASA surprised.\n\nThe Lunar 13 parts exposed 5 years to Lunar Environment gave precious Data for Columbus Study on L3M and Lunar base hardware.\n\nSoyuz 16 and Apollo 15\n\nThe planned launch of Soyuz 16 with Yuri Artyukhin and Pavel Popovich was schedule for June 1971.\n\nThis time the mission went to Mare Crisium on right edge of Moon\n\nin May Lunokhod 6 touchdown on Mare Crisium and started to look for LK landing site.\n\nJune 22 the Lunar rocket was launch to Moon, Soyuz 16 arrived on 28 June.\n\nPopovic landed on 29 June near where Lunokhod 6 landed a month ago.\n\nOn first EVA he deployed Scientific equipment and prepare Core sample drill, then collect lunar samples.\n\nThen he returned into LK for rest and a snack.\n\nOn second EVA he use the Core sample drill and drilling 2 meter into soil getting 1.7 kg sample.\n\nThen Popovic return with LK to Moon orbit, were Artyukhin was busy cartographing the Lunar surface\n\n3 days later the crew landed safe in Soviet union.\n\nThe Mare Crisium drill samples had a surprise for Soviets\n\nThey discover It contain 0.1% water, something not expected, MoM send Samples to NASA who confirmed the findings.\n\nApollo 15\n\nAdministrator Bush had cancel the planned H-mission for Apollo15 and replaced it, with the J-Class mission.\n\nThe LM was modified for stay for 72 hours on lunar surface.\n\nIt carry a Lunar Rover and more scientific experiment, what allow for more EVA and bigger range as past H-mission.\n\nWhile the CSM got science bay what scann and mapping the Lunar Surface\n\nWith more Scientific results per mission, NASA hope to get a lead in Moon race\n\nApollo 15 was launch on July 26, 1971 with David Scott ,Alfred Worden and James Irwin on board.\n\nLM Falcon landed on July 30, over 66 hours Scott and Irwin made 4 EVA and drove 29 km with Lunar rover\n\nAnd collected 77 kilograms on Lunar samples, this made look the Soviet one man mission insignificant.\n\nsample 15415 is sensation one on oldest stone found 4 billion years labelling it as the Genesis Rock\n\nWhile the Sub-satellite the CSM eject in Lunar orbit crash later what let to discovery of the Lunar mass concentration\n\nSadly had Apollo 15 a bitter aftertaste, the Crew had made deal with German stamp dealer\n\nand smuggle unauthorised commemorative postal covers onboard of CSM\n\nThe crew made this to offer Trust fund for there children education.\n\nNext to that also unauthorized was bringing the “Fallen Astronaut\" statuette to Moon\n\nand Two watches by manufacture to test them in Microgravity.\n\nThe Investigation by US Senate and NASA show that only NASA regulation were violated.\n\nThe Crew of Apollo 15 were guilty misbehavior and were remove from Flight plan, also were rule exalted what astronaut can carry on personal items into Apollo spacecraft\n\nOn August 12, Caspar Weinberger responsible for US budget, try last effort at Nixon on the subject of NASA budget reduction.\n\nBut Nixon refused Weinberger proposition, sending his memo back with this note in red\n\nI will not stand by and watch how the commies conquer Space !\n\nWhile the Saturn V and IB production-line are unwrapped and make ready for a second production run.\n\nAt NASA they prepared the J-Class missions for Apollo 16 to 18 and Skylab is rush to completion.\n\nIn same time start final battle about NASA Odyssey program in Capitol Hill,\n\nWhile China start to increase there space activity since they launch their first satellite two years ago.\n\nwhat were they up to ?\n\n1972 the good part of year...\n\nIn USA the production starts on the new Saturn Rockets\n\nMcDonnell/Douglas complete the First S-IVC for Saturn IC and Saturn VB\n\nIt’s a S-IVB stage modified for new J-2S engine (S for Simplified) which led to a reduction of Stage mass,\n\nA higher ISP and options for restarting the Stage several time.\n\nScheduled to be launched first on the Saturn IB first stage left over from the first production run.\n\nThe second Saturn IC launch will feature a Centaur as third stage and Burner II as four stage,\n\nIt will bring German Helios A probe near the sun in December 1974\n\nThe Saturn VB, consisting of an standard S-IC and S-IIB (with five J-2S) and S-IVC is scheduled to be launch unmanned in spring 1974 follow by first manned flight with Apollo 20 in winter 1974.\n\nNow NASA was readying for the next four Apollo J-class and Skylab A three missions.\n\nApollo 16\n\nThe legendary John Young, Charles Duke and John Swigert blasted off on Saturn V on 16 April 1972.\n\nA bad surprise happened after day two as the guidance system needed a realigning after some errors.\n\nOn 21 April the LM Orion landed in Descartes Highlands, Young first words on surface:\n\n\"There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes Highland plains, Apollo 16 is gonna change your Image, I'm sure glad they got ol' Brer Rabbit, here, back in the Briar patch where he belongs\"\n\nThey deployed the Rover and installed the Far Ultraviolets Camera/Spectrograph. On a short test drive the rover show some problem.\n\nAfter installing the ALSEP, the heat flow experiment was damaged as Young's foot caught a cable snapping it off,\n\nFor the Geologist Mission was a disappointment.\n\nThe Descartes Highlands was not volcanic site, but instead formed by huge impact on lunar surface.\n\nYoung and Duke managed to get a core sample from 3 meter depth.\n\nOn end of their Mission, they took off with 95.71 kg of lunar samples back to lunar orbit.\n\nOn the way back to Earth the crew made EVAs to recover the Film canister from scientific equipment bay.\n\nAfter 265 hours and 37 minute mission, the capsule Casper landed near the USS Ticonderoga.\n\nThe second J-class mission was triumphal for Apollo program,\n\nRecord breaking: 72 hour stay, in EVA for 20 hours, longest distant travel on moon 26.7 km and 95.71 kg of Lunar samples\n\nIn contrast the Soviet L3-Mission looked really puny.\n\nBack in USSR\n\nOKB-1 started the year with an unmanned 60 days orbital Test of new version of Soyuz spacecraft adapted for Salyut program.\n\nThe 7K-7 version featured a Docking tunnel so three men crew could enter the Space station, without spacewalk in Spacesuits.\n\nstill practiced on Soyuz missions in Lunar orbit.\n\nDuring landing, on the 29 April ended in disaster, after the orbital section was separated from Return module,\n\na seal was ripp open, opening a valve let escaping Cabin air at an altitude of 168 km.\n\nThis was bad for already delay program, the Crew from Three was reduced to Two in pressure suits.\n\nAt OKB-52 there also problems with the construction of Salyut\n\nTheir engineers start to modified the construction to leave out unnecessary parts and systems like a second docking port,\n\nalso now installing four Soyuz solar panels for power supply.\n\nThe originally planned features would be installed in later version of Salut, during the second half of the ninth five-Year Plan (1971-1976)\n\nFor Lunar Mission they Soviets start to maximise the Mission architecture,\n\nThe Lunokhod rovers were modified to collect samples in preliminary part of Mission.\n\nAlso controls were installed so cosmonaut drive the rover themselves if needed.\n\nOrbital Module was modified to carry more scientific experiments and Cameras to scann the Moon.\n\nSoyuz 17\n\nOn May 13, 1972 launched the Luna rocket with Boris Volynov and Vitaly Zholobov.\n\nTheir target was Mare Fecunditatis where Lunokhod 7 was waiting for LK\n\nThis time the moon rover was busy in last two month, for the first time it collected samples during its travels providing data over longer distance over Mare Fecunditatis.\n\nOn May 19 the LK touched down on target.\n\nAfter landing Zholobov installed DALS, he collected samples containers from Lunokhod 8 and took the core samples drill and return to orbit.\n\nBut during Spacewalk from LK to LOK happen this:\n\nVolynov: WATCH OUT, VITALY !\n\nZholobov: OH, No, no, no !\n\nMission control: What’s going on ?\n\nZholobov: [EXPLETIVE DELETED], [EXPLETIVE DELETED] !\n\nMission control: What is going on ?!\n\nVolynov: eeeh\n\nZholobov: I lost the Sample container\n\nMission control: WHAT ?!\n\nZholobov: I lost [EXPLETIVE DELETED] Sample container\n\nVolynov: confirm that !\n\nMission Control: How'd that happen?!\n\nZholobov: I have no idea how this [EXPLETIVE DELETED] happened ! [EXPLETIVE DELETED] the Photos were also in there!\n\nMission Control: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]\n\nZholobov exhausted from his Lunar trip, had not properly secured the Sample container on his spacesuit.\n\nDo to movements towards LOK the container detached and moved into it's own lunar orbit.\n\nSo \"The Empty handed Mission“ returned 72 hours later on earth\n\n\"We had achieve so much and in end we failed\". A embarrassed Vitaly Zholobov\n\nFor MoM it was clear that L3 was a minimal program, that was not practical for Lunar exploration.\n\nWhile the Americans set record after record on the Moon, L3M was not ready to Launch until in 4 years…\n\nDespite this, \"The Empty handed Moon Mission“ provided a fit of laughter for the Soviets.\n\nRest of World\n\nThe 1972 Summer Olympic in Munich were overshadow by the Black September terroristic act.\n\nLucky the Bavarian special forces ambushed the terrorists as they tried to escape on Fürstenfeldbruck Air force base with Boeing 727.\n\nKilling seven terrorists, two were captured alive, wounding several of the nine hostage in process,\n\nThe Munich Miracle was possible by the groundwork the German police had with there terrorist in last 4 years.\n\n1972 the terrible part of year...\n\nIntrigue and Failure\n\nIt’s a public secret in the USSR, that their Spaceflight program was dominated by intrigues of Shakespearian proportions [1]\n\nLike how Valentin Gluchko and Vladimir Chelomei refused to co-operate on the Nositjel rocket Family and the L3-complex.\n\nThankfully Mikhall Yangel, was a stabilizing factor in the mess, He managed to get others OKBs in the collaborative effort into Lunar program.\n\nNot only did his OKB-586 build the successful R-16 ICBM, but also the LK moon lander\n\nThe Military had following saying:\n\n[sergei] Khrushchev works for TASS, Chelomei works on crap, Yangel work for us !\n\nSadly Mikhall Kuzmich Yangel died during his 60th Birthday on October 25 1971.\n\nSince his death the cracks in loyalty towards MoM[2] now showed clearly.\n\nOn one side was Sergei Khrushchev OKB-1 and Kuznetsov OKB-276 with Vladimir Barmin of KBOM and Georgy Babakin of OKB-301.\n\nOpposed was Valentin Gluchko of OKB-456 and Vladimir Chelomei of OKB-52.\n\nNext to them was Vladimir Fedorovich Utkin, successor of Yangel at OKB-586 and their allies in the Military under Chairman Ustinov.\n\nGluchko's fame was falling, he lost the lucrative OKB-1 engines contract, do to it's replacement by the Kuznetsov engines.\n\nHe built only main engines for OKB-586, RCS trusters and small engines for rockets and spacecrafts of OKB-1.\n\nNext to that he had high R&D costs on rocket engines working with storable fuel combinations,\n\nOne is the RD-270 a monster engine in the size of American F-1, MoM showed interest in this engine, if it worked on Kerosine/Oxygen.\n\nBut Gluchko stubbornly refused demanding that Luna Block A had to be change to UMDH/NTO propellant !\n\nAnd for Chelomei it was worst, his UR-500 rocket was canceled in favor of the N2 Proton in the beginning of the 1960s\n\nHis ICBM proposals were victim of the VSALT[3] agreement under Nikita Khrushchev and Johnson.\n\nSince then his OKB-52 made only hardware, satellite and guidance systems for other OKB’s, while his proposals were ignored !\n\nThat was not a surprise because of his arrogant ways, behavior with officials and talking shit about his colleagues.\n\nAlso his bold demands, instead of trying to cooperate with OKB-1 to launch his hardware,\n\nChelomei demand from MoM or Military the complete package: the spacecraft on a rocket built by him with the launch infrastructure.\n\nDo to the failure of Soyuz 17 and the delay in Salut program,\n\nMinister Sergey Afanasysev called for Meeting of OKB Directors for solutions.\n\nThe Meeting started bad, Chelomei declare that the Luna rocket was piece of shit, that was not able to bring more mass to Moon.\n\nChelomei claimed it was because Khrushchev had put his junior as Head of OKB-1 !\n\nHe had the solution: a new modular Rocket of his design: the UR-700, launching a LK-700 Lunar lander direct to Moon !\n\nAfanasysev ask Chelomei if he had become completely mad,\n\nTo scrap the working Nositjel rocket Family and waste billions of Rubles on this \"toxic bandwagon\" ?\n\nValentin Gluchko supported Chelomei's proposal, because it needed his RD-270 and other yet to be developed engines.\n\nHis explication about the unnecessary for Hydrogen oxygen rocket engine were criticise by Mishin\n\n\"What are the Americans using on their Saturn V! Vodka ?“\n\nKuznetsov presented Gluchko a bad surprise, OKB-276 had successful modified a NK-15 to burn Liquid Hydrogen.\n\nSergei Khrushchev's angrily noticed that the successor of L3 complex, the L3M will ready to fly in 1976,\n\nso there is no need to waste money to put Chelomei's LK-700 on N1 rocket.\n\nThis led to Vladimir Chelomei outbursting with obscene words about OKB-1's works and about Khrushchev family favoritism.\n\nKhrushchev replied:\n\n\"We have put soviet men first on the Moon, what have you achieved during that time? NOTHING !\"\n\nChelomei reaction was to grab a ashtray and try trow it toward Khrushchev, but was hinder by Yefermov and Gluchko.\n\nFor minister Afanasysev this was enough and in the Russian tradition to blame some unpopular one for the mess,\n\nChelomei was now the perfect victim.\n\nHe was dismissed as head of OKB-52 and sent to the Ukrainian Academy of Science as a teacher for rocket engineers.\n\nGerbert Aleksandrovich Yefermov became the new head of OKB-52 that become a branch of OKB-1.\n\nGluchko was lucky because the Military needed him for new generation of ICBMs that had to replace the Old R-16.\n\nHis expertise in engines with storable fuel was needed. also for another Military program called Spiral 50/50\n\nBut the Military did not want the RD-270 engine, so the R&D on that was terminated immediately,\n\nAnd MoM cut down funding drastic on OKB-456's very expensive R&D engines program.\n\nOKB-52 scheduled the first Salyut to be launch on April 1973.\n\n[1] See the International successfully 1990 Soviet TV soap opera \"Intrigues of Starcity“ about Soviet Space program and Moon Race\n\n[2] MoM = Ministry of General Machine Building aka Ministry of Space of the USSR\n\n[3] VSALT = Volunteer Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty between USA and USSR in 1963, do to the French and Berlin Crisis' of 1961.\n\nOKB = the Russian initials of \"Опытное конструкторское бюро\" -, meaning Experimental Design Bureau.\n\nSoyuz 18\n\nWas a repeat of the Soyuz 17 \"The Empty handed Mission“, the malicious-joy of the World Press.\n\nVladislav Volkov was the Pilot of LK lander, while Georgy Dobrovolsky operate LOK.\n\nOriginal planed to be launch in end July the mission go delay because Technical issue to August.\n\nin mean time Lunokhod 9 collect samples and got into position.\n\nOn 1 August 1972 the Luna Rocket blasted off to bring the crew to the Moon\n\nThen on 4 august happen the disaster, a Solar Flare erupted, 14.6 hours later the shockwave hit Soyuz 18 full\n\nmost of radiation was absorb by L3-complex hardware, but both cosmonauts got radiation sickness\n\nThe mission got cancelled, Soyuz 18 made lunar fly by 72 hours later the capsule landed in the Soviet Union.\n\nSadly the crew had not survive\n\nThe Soviet state media attempted to downplay the tragic end of the mission but failed,\n\nThey were also each posthumously awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal.\n\nDobrovolsky and Volkov were given a large state funeral and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow,\n\nThe pallbearer were Vladimir Komarov, Yuri Gagarin, Alexey Leonov, also US astronaut Tom Stafford.\n\nUnited States president Richard Nixon issued an official statement following the tragedy:\n\nThe American people join in expressing to you and the Soviet people our deepest sympathy on the tragic deaths of the two Soviet cosmonauts.\n\nThe whole world followed the exploits of these courageous explorers of the unknown and shares the anguish of their tragedy.\n\nBut the achievements of cosmonauts Dobrovolsky and Volkov remain. It will, I am sure, prove to have contributed greatly to the further achievements of the Soviet program for the exploration of space and thus to the widening of man's horizons.\n\nNASA and MoM came to agreement, were both exchange their data on Solar activity to predict better Solar Flares.\n\nThere was short Political dispute in USA about ending the Moos Race, but change abrupt as China launch a Chinese into Orbit !\n\nLunokhod 9 was never visit by Cosmonaut or Astronaut, it became a Memorial for Vladislav Volkov and Georgy Dobrovolsky\n\nRest of 1972\n\nChina\n\nOne of the biggest surprises was their first manned space flight, only 3 years after first Satellite Dong Fang Hong 1 (Red East One).\n\nBut looking in detail it was not so surprising at all, the spacecraft was merely a modified Warhead Reentry Vehicle,\n\nwith the nuclear warhead replaced by Man with Live support and a landing system !\n\nThat explained the short time that Directive 690 Hòng Xing (Red Star) needed until it's success.\n\nOn October 18 1972 a Dong Feng 5 ICBM brought Hóng Xing 1 with Dong Xiao Hai on board,\n\nThe first \"Hang tian yuan\" (space navigating personnel)\n\nAfter one orbit he landed safe in south China, becoming a national hero of the People Republic of China.\n\nUSA\n\nIn October, the Washington Post published an article by Bob Woodward and Carl Berstein,\n\nrevealing that Vice President Spiro Agnew was accepting bribes as Gouverneur of Maryland !\n\nOn October 10, Spiro Agnew resigned from office, despite his claims to be not guilty and that it was merely \"unreported Income“.\n\nDo to the 25th Amendment the House Minority Leader had the option to become new Vice President,\n\nPresident Nixon sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement,\n\nThe advice was unanimous: the House Minority Leader, the republican Gerald Ford.\n\nFord was confirmed as Vice President by Capitol hill ( Senate 92 vs 3 and Congress 387 vs 35 votes)\n\nGerald Ford took over the Legacy of Agnew, the Odyssey Program and keep it running,\n\nThis remained the only scandal in Nixon administration.\n\nDo the successful manned Chinese space flight push Capitol Hill to full support NASA Odyssey program.\n\nIn December Richard Nixon made his historic visit to China.\n\nA diplomatic success for Nixon, defusing the \"Chinese Nightmare“ situation between the two Nations.\n\nThe Chinese Forces redrew from position at North Vietnam border.\n\nWhich led to Pro Nationalist forces dealing with the Pro China Fraction in the North Vietnamese Communist party.\n\nIn 1973 the North Vietnamese power struggle was finally won by the Pro Nationalists,\n\n60 day later after the Peace Agreement ist signed in Paris. The last US advisor left South Vietnam\n\nHenry Kissinger estimated how long South Vietnam would survive his answer: Around two, three years, not more…\n\nCambodia\n\nThe biggest loser of this conflict was the Maoist Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.\n\nAfter they lost their allied China in 1967, then North Vietnam in 1968, there were attacks by those Pro Nationalist forces,\n\nThen by Vietnam Pro China Fractions, the South Vietnamese Army, Laos Military and United States Forces.\n\nAs their leader \"Brother number 1“ was killed during attacks in 1972, the remaining Khmer Rouge fled to Thailand,\n\nWe're the Organisation was no more than group of Bandits hunted down over the years by Thailand's military.\n\nSkylab\n\nIn October 1972 Kennedy Space Center gave a spectacular show: Two Saturn Vs rolled out VAB toward Launch Pad 39\n\nOne was Apollo 17, scheduled to launch on December 7th.\n\nThe Other was Skylab, America's (and the world's) first space station scheduled for Launch on November 23rd.\n\nSkylab began in 1965 as the Apollo Application Program in MSFC under George E. Mueller\n\nThe first goal was launch a 3 man Space Station build from S-IVB stage called \"The Orbital Workshop“ or OWS.\n\nIn 1968 with the termination of MOL program at the USAF, part of their Astronauts were transferred to NASA,\n\nSeveral were assigned to the Skylab program.\n\nAlso the name was changed from \"the Orbital Workshop“ into Skylab.\n\nIn 1970 McDonnell Douglas started to build in California, two space stations, Skylab A and B (B for backup).\n\nFinally, in 1972 Skylab A arrived in late August at KSC for preparation to Launch.\n\nWhile in Johnson Space center the second Mission Control Center was activated for Skylab,\n\nSo the Apollo 17 Mission could go synchronous.\n\nOn November 23 the Saturn V took off from Pad 39-B, but 63 seconds later the Micrometeoroid shield detach and was ripped off the station\n\nSkylab arrived in orbit and deployed the Apollo Telescope Mount and its Solar cells,\n\nbut the rise of temperature in Station released toxic fumes from material in the station.\n\nThis was a new Disaster for NASA, what to do ?\n\nGeorge E. Mueller was clear that the future of NASA was at stake, so he made a decision: the first Skylab crew must repair the station.\n\nThis delayed the launch for 10 days to prepare the Repair procedure.\n\nIn the mean time ground control had vented the Atmosphere of the station, purging it with pure Nitrogen four time, before restore the Nitrogen/Oxygen atmosphere.\n\nSkylab-2\n\nSo on December 2, Skylab-2 was launch from Pad 34 on Board: Charles \"Pete“ Conrad, Jr., Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz.\n\nAs they arrived 6 hours later at Skylab they saw the full scale of the problem,\n\nThe Micrometeoroid shield had also ripped off a solar cell of the station, the other was jammed by the debris of the shield.\n\nThe first EVA attempted to deblock the Solar Cells ending in failure as Skylab lost of most RCS fuel.\n\nAfter docking the crew enter the station in spacesuits despite the high temperatures and being underpowered, Skylab was fine.\n\nThey used the Science Airlock to deploye a parasol, working as sunshade, with temperatures successfully dropping to an acceptable level.\n\nOn December 7th, Apollo 17 was launched and for the first time there were 6 American astronauts were in space .\n\nwith the second EVA Conrad and Kerwin, on December 17th, managed to Open the solar wing on Skylab, providing electrical power for next two missions.\n\nOn December 24th, The Crew celebrated Christmas in Orbit, the first time since Apollo 8's historic mission that an Astronaut had spent Christmas in Space.\n\nThen on December 30th, the Crew left Skylab and returned safely to Earth after a mission of 28 days.\n\nMeanwhile Skylab was put into Hibernation for next Crew arriving in February.\n\nApollo 17\n\nOn December 7, a Saturn V manned with Eugene Cerman, Ronald Evans and Joe Engle, blasted off from pad 39-A.\n\n500,000 people watching the spectacle of a Saturn V night launch, from over 200 km you could see the light of the five F-1 engine gleaming in the Sky.\n\nDuring the transfer to moon the crew experienced light flashes in the spacecraft, cosmic radiation from Sun hitting the eyes of the astronauts.\n\nAlso reported by Cerman was a blinking object that follow the CSM/LM on large distance, later it was revealed to be radar, one of adapter panels was drifting parallel to CSM/LM\n\nThe LM Challenger touched down in Taurus-Littrow right on target on December 11.\n\nDuring the first EVA Cerman took panorama pictures of the landing side from the top of the LM hatch.\n\nAfter a good night of rest the Crew started the Second EVA , Cerman's first words on moon were:\n\nJoe [Engle] I'm out here oh my Golly! Unbelievable! Unbelievable; but is it bright in the Sun.\n\nThey offloading the rover and they deployed the ALSEP package and put US flags on the lunar surface.\n\nA problem Cerman and Engle had on all EVAs was the moon dust, it stuck on suit, on the rover,\n\nEven got inside there LM which Cerman and Engle described as the smell of spent gunpowder.\n\nBut they had their fun, during the EVA Engle and Cerman even start singing during this EVA.\n\nOn the third EVA Cerman and Engle collected 66 kilograms of Lunar samples.\n\nThe fourth EVA Engle made a big discovery near a bolder, a small unusual rock \"The Genesis rock““\n\nit came from lower crust of moon, being one of the oldest stones found on moon and showed traces of original lunar magnetic field !\n\nOn end of the EVA they parked the Lunar rover at a safe distance to film the accent of LM .\n\nWith the surface stay of 3 days and 3 hours it was a new record not to mention the EVA of seven hours 15 minute and the 110.4 kg of lunar samples.\n\nDuring the time in lunar orbit, the CSM America scanned the Surface with spectrographs for the geological Lunar Map.\n\nAfter dedocking the LM, the Crew released the PFS-2 subsatellite, this time the PFS-2 remain sta"
