THE SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE James McGrath In a recent article in this journal' Mr. Amos Wylie takes some well-aimed pot shots at the weaknesses inherent in scientific exchanges with the USSR. He points out that So- viet scientists who come to the United States are almost al- ways dedicated Communists following a carefully prearranged plan for collection of scientific intelligence of special interest to the USSR. He sees these scientific mercenaries, \"backed by the full coercive power of the Soviet state,\" making sub- stantial contributions to Soviet scientific intelligence, par- ticularly in fields related to development of new weapons. On the other side of the coin, he cannot see that U.S. exchange scientists get anything like an even break information-wise when they confront the language barrier, the closed areas, and the closed laboratory doors of the USSR. Let us grant at the outset that a very great deal of what Mr. Wylie says is true. The case. against having scientific exchanges with the USSR can be backed up by many other facts than those he cites, and the Interagency Committee on Exchanges acknowledges in its most recent annual report on intelligence evaluations of the exchange program that the Soviets could have realized a slight net gain in scientific ex- changes except in the field of atomic energy, where carefully negotiated exchanges were judged to have brought a net ad- vantage to the United States. What, then, is the use of al- lowing Soviet scientists to come to the United States? Or is there any use? The Larger Picture The answer lies in part in an over-all look at the U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange program, which includes provision for the scientific exchanges and indeed could not have been negoti- 1 Studies VI 4, p. 9 if., \"Unfair Exchange.\" Approved For Rel J se 200M04113 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000200010001-2 FIDENTIAL MORI/HRP PAGES 25-3Q25 MORI/HRP PAGES Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : CIA CONFIDENTIAL Scientific Exchange ated without them. The agreement for cultural exchanges with the Soviets, first signed in 1958, was renewed for the third time in March 1962. Under it, exchanges have taken place in industry, technology, agriculture, medicine, educa- tion, the performing arts, and sports, as well as science. In addition, we have exchanged motion pictures, magazines (Amerika and USSR), exhibits, and radio-television pro- grams as part of the cultural exchange. Finally, the agree- ment has encouraged the development of tourism by Soviet and U.S. citizens visiting each others' country. According to State Department sources, 7,000 U.S. and Soviet exchangees have participated in over 615 exchange projects during the four years, the USSR has opened its territory to more than 35,000 American tourists, and 1,200 Soviet tourists have vis- ited the United States. We have to consider this whole cultural exchange program as an entity, recognizing that each side will look for profit in some areas and accept losses in others. For example, on the U.S. credit side, the program has made the territory of the USSR accessible to U.S. citizens in a way that could not have been imagined during the Stalin era. This has been an intelligence advantage, as well as helping to normalize re- lationships between the peoples of the two nations. Although, as Mr. Wylie says, we still deal with a regime which maintains strict control over the activities of its citizens, the U.S. policy of promoting exchanges is based on the hope that it will lead eventually to a still more relaxed attitude in the USSR. We know that we risk losses in terms of technical and scientific know-how when we allow Soviet scientists to visit our laboratories and research institutes and talk with our leading scientists. But the losses can be and are minimized by, first, recognizing that this is a primary aim in the So- viet exchange strategy, and second, doing everything we can to reduce the risk. That the Soviet aim is recognized is evi- dent in official pronouncements. In March 1961, President Kennedy, defending the program, voiced his caution: We are of course concerned that [exchanges] will be reciprocal and national security will be protected... . Scientific Exchange CONFIDENTIAL The State Department similarly says in its April 1962 Review of Exchanges: As far as exchanges with the United States are concerned, Soviet primary goals appear to be twofold: To obtain scientific and technical information, and to paint a favorable picture of the Soviet Union and Soviet politics. . . . Because the United States is aware of this [first] goal it is able to take adequate steps against a one-way flow of information. In his commentary on the damaging effects of scientific exchanges with the Soviets, Mr. Wylie has not recognized the very considerable amount of checking, examining, and evaluating that is brought to bear on each and every such exchange. CIA, and in particular its Office of Scientific In- telligence and Office of Research and Reports, plays an impor- tant part in this process. The CIA opinions on a given ex- change, often along with opinions of other elements of the intelligence community and the Department of Commerce, are coordinated into one intelligence estimate for submittal to the State Department by the Interagency Committee on Exchanges. The State Department considers these inte:lli?- gence judgments in making its decision to accept or reject an exchange, scientific or otherwise. A Case History That vigilance in the matter of scientific exchanges is ex- ercised by all concerned is illustrated in a series of incidents which occurred in 1962. The curious train of circumstances began in January when heavy pressure was brought to bear on the Computing Center at New York University by Soviet scientist A. A. Dorodnitsyn, Director of the USSR Academy of Sciences Computing Center, to accommodate two Soviet scientists for a two-month exchange visit. This was followed in rapid succession by a request from a Soviet student to at- tend the Western Joint Computer Conference in Los An- geles, a letter to Professor James Robertson at Illinois Uni- versity asking about his willingness to receive one A. V. Petrosian, described as a \"Yerevan scientific worker,\" for ex- tended study at Illinois on computer technology, and a re- quest by a Soviet educational exchange delegation to add the IBM headquarters at Rochester, New York, to its U.S. itin.- 26 Approved For Releas?Q00ALCIA P78Tp3.194AOO0-200010001-2 Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : CIA- Scienfific Exchange erary. The last request was unique in that a Soviet Embassy official by-passed the State Department and went directly to IBM with it. The series reached a climax when the Soviets proposed that economic expert M. M. Golansky, coming to the United States as an exchange visitor sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies, be permitted to follow an extensive itinerary calculated to get him into areas where he could observe ap- plications of computer technology to economic planning. Mr. Golansky, moreover, a very competent man in his field, had a record of involvement with the Soviet intelligence services. Although the Department of State of necessity handled each of these proposals separately vis-a-vis the Soviets, inside the government they were treated as a concerted Soviet ef- fort to get needed information on all aspects of U.S. research in automation and computer technology. In view of the USSR negotiators' having refused to include an exchange of automation specialists as part of the 1962-63 exchange agree- ment, the Soviet play appeared to be an attempted end run on the exchange program. After checking intelligence opin- ions on the matter, the State Department took the following actions: Informed the Soviets that the proposed visit of two scien- tists to the NYU computer center must be held up pending a review of reciprocity requirements. To date, despite continued pressure from the Soviets, this visit has not been approved. Declined to allow the Soviet student to attend the West- ern Joint Computer Conference. Took no action on the \"Yerevan scientific worker's\" re- quest for admission to Illinois University pending an examination of reciprocity requirements. Reduced Dr. Golansky's itinerary to a brief swing through certain eastern university computer centers doing com- pletely unclassified research. Refused the Soviet Educational Exchange delegation's re- quest for a visit to IBM's Rochester plant and informed the Soviet Embassy that future requests of this kind were to be addressed to the State Department, not directly to a U.S. industry or research laboratory. Approved For Release : CIA- CONFIDENTIAL P78T03194A000200010001-2 Scientific Exchange CONFIDENTIAL, From this history one can see that the State Department, having assembled the necessary background information, acted promptly and vigorously to blunt the Soviet drive to exploit the exchange agreement to its own advantage. One instance, of course, does not prove that we are always success- ful in identifying such Soviet moves and taking prompt and effective action. But it does illustrate that a working sys- tem has been devised for assimilating information and acting on it in the best interests of the nation. Uncounted Blessings We know that the Soviets expose their closed society to the unpredictable impact of cultural exchanges with the United States and other Western nations (France, West Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom also have exchange treaties with them) in order to get a crack at the latest develop- ments in Western science and technology through scientific exchanges. In pursuit of that end they will continue to send to the United States mission-minded scientists and dedi- cated Communists like Dr. Yuri Popov, who, as Mr. Wylie says, \"was probably instructed to absorb as much information as possible\" in the maser-laser field. At least some of the in- formation they get will be balanced by the findings of U.S. scientists visiting the Soviet Union under the scientific sec- tion (II) of the exchange treaty. A similar balance is main- tained by delegations exchanged under Sections III through VI of the agreement, covering industry, transport, construc- tion and trade, agriculture, public health, and education. Sections VII through XII, however, covering the performing arts, cinematography, publications, exhibitions, radio and TV programs, governmental affairs, civil, social, and cultural groups, athletes, and tourism, which have as their objective a lowering of the barriers erected by the Soviet Union against the West, are not subject to this kind of exploitation; and it is apparent that even the USSR recognizes that the ad- vantage rests here with the United States. These sections, while they are not considered in the annual determination of net intelligence advantage, certainly loom large in a general appraisal of the program. 9%10001-2 P78T01'14 MUEN 25X1 Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : CIAO CONFIDENTIAL Scientific Exchange Not only the scientific exchanges but all those under Sec- tions II through VI of the agreement are submitted by the Department of State to all interested government agencies for comment. The intelligence community plays a major role in this appraisal, and its technical advice and suggestions are largely followed by the Department. As in any negotiation between adversaries, each must yield at some points and stand firm at others. The programs arranged under the scientific section, as under any other, represent in general the best bargain obtainable in the opinion of those parts of the U.S. government charged with implementing the policy on ex- changes. Almost any scientific or industrial field can be related to war and weaponry. Every effort is made to isolate our visitors from applied research and development and restrict their exploration to basic science. We believe this effort is largely successful. A still more restrictive posture would result in retaliation that would prove generally disadvantageous and might lead to the virtual elimination of U.S.-USSR exchanges. It is difficult to visualize a better procedure than that now used to ensure our getting the greatest possible benefit from the program. Our performance under this procedure, as in all other human endeavors, can almost certainly be improved. But so long as we are not providing important assistance to the Soviets in critical matters and are successful in keep- ing scientific exchanges somewhere nearly in balance, it is reasonable and prudent to consider the program on an over- all basis and not draw large conclusions from individual ex- amples.

POLICY BIAS Janet Hill Merkle The question of the extent to which the U.S. intelligence assessment of foreign situations is biased by already estab- lished government policy toward them is. a delicate one and in all its ramifications too complex to be broached by a junior trainee like the present writer. But any student with access to the materials can sample one aspect of it by separating off a particular fairly clear situation and examining the com- munity's finished reports on it for signs that their objectivity has been impaired by the policy makers' views. This is what I have done, taking as sample the National Estimates, articles in CIA's Current Intelligence Weekly, and State's INR pub- lications concerned with the situation in Portuguese Angola over a period of about two years. Here the established U.S. policy, first publicly declared by Ambassador Stevenson in the United Nations in March 1961, is one of support for Angolan self-determination and of opposi- tion to Portugal's resolve to keep the colony, which was le- gally declared a \"province\" in 1951. Evidence that the finished intelligence reports had been affected by this policy was found in their phrasing and emphasis, in their omission of facts re- ported from the field (by the U.S. and British attaches, the American consul in Luanda, and the clandestine services) which could be cited in favor of the opposing Portuguese pol- icy, and in their measurement of Portuguese performance against standards set up by the U.S. policy. In these respects the National Estimates showed the least anti-Portuguese bias, the INR publications the most. National Estimates Although the four estimates between 1959 and 1962 which treated the subject of Portugal's overseas territories seem to Approved For Release 2005/04/13: CIA-RWUftT/P4FMM0NJW1-2 SECRET 55 SECRET Approved For Release 2001ritd /yl36i&lA- be for the most part objective, they do contain a few manifes- tations of bias. In an NIE of 21 July 1959, it is said that Portuguese policy is a curious mixture of indifference to the lot of the native, half-hearted efforts to elevate him from savagery, repression of all dissident voices, and cheerful assertion that in fact no problems exist. Hyperbole and ridicule of this kind are clearly inconsistent with objectivity. It is possible, however, since the estimate antedates the public declaration of U.S. that this is an Policy, of personal rather than policy bias An NIE of 11 April 1961 estimates that Salazar may take some measures designed to give the impression of liberal- izing the colonial regime. This statement implies, first, that no measures of reform had theretofore been taken, and second, that any reforms in the future would be made only in order to influence world opinion. But reports from the field show that some reform measures had already been taken and that currently schools for Afri- cans are being built rapidly and public health facilities greatly expanded and improved. It seems clear that the Portuguese have concluded, whether reluctantly must be made if they are to stay in Angolan and they are e- termined to stay. Given their lack of resources and the con- servatism of the government at home and in Angola, it is not surprising that the reforms are neither sweeping nor rapid. But it is unrealistic to assume that what measures are being taken are designed only to impress international opinion. The Portuguese have never been terribly concerned by ad- verse public opinion before, and it is unlikely that they would now base their policy on it. Several passages in the estimates also leave an exaggerated impression of the \"rigid, harsh, and penurious\" conditions under which the average Angolan lives. gola are far from utopian for the African, but othet field reports supply evidence that they are not so bad as generally believed. This evidence is not presented in the NIE's. On the other hand, it was only in an NIE, of all the finished reports, that a reference was found to the \"unusual cruelty on both sides\" in the rebellion. Approved For Release 2005/04/13 SECRET 78T0V;441QQa?00010001-2 Many of the estimates' conclusions were the same as those which have been reached by U.S. policy makers-that the Portuguese are likely to have continuing troubles in Angola, for example, and that reform will have to be considerable if the situation is not to become explosive. One cannot say whether this is because policy influenced intelligence, because intelligence influenced policy, as it should, or because the evi-. dente led both independently to the same conclusions. Current Intelligence Weeklies Examining seventeen articles in the Weekly from May 1960 to April 1962 covering the Angolan situation, I found no evi- dence of a lack of objectivity prior to the U.S. declaration of policy, but beginning in April 1961 there was a prejudicial omis- sion of mitigating material contained in the field reports. In, these articles there are several references to \"brutal repres- sion\" on the part of the Portuguese armed services and civil- ians. According to reports from State and Army personnel on the scene, the attacks of the African terrorists have been equally brutal. For example, one State despatch said that Africans were \"killing white families, mulatto families and native Africans who had not joined their movement with equal and impartial brutality.\" Reports of African brutality have also appeared in the New York Times. This the Weeklies do not mention anywhere, leaving the impression that there was no provocation whatever for the Portuguese reprisals. There is also considerable discrepancy between the articles and field reports with regard to the extent of Portuguese bru- tality. In the panicky month following the uprising, accord- ing to the latter, there were indeed indiscriminate acts of cruelty and reprisal on the part of the Portuguese authorities and civilians in Angola, and some groups of innocent Africans were killed or driven from their homes in both official and vigilante-type actions. The reports go on to say, however, that since the Portuguese army moved into Angola in force there have been only isolated instances of such reprisals. The army officers in the north, feeling that the natives in that area had some reason for revolt, have instituted a policy of \"psychological rehabilitation.\" They are laying out new vil- RDP78T0314A0002800101 ~ protect the natives, assisting in the Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : CIA DP7 Policy Bias construction of homes and schools, and encouraging rebels and refugees to return to their homes with no punishment. The civilian Portuguese often regard all Africans as rebels or potential rebels, but the army discourages this view and is trying to avoid indiscriminate acts of violence. The Weekly articles do not mention this effort of the Portuguese army to deal with the situation; they make no distinction between military and civilian actions. They also do not mention the statements in field reports that Portuguese retaliation and cruelty have been greatly exaggerated. INR Publications Although the INR publications carry a caveat that they do not necessarily reflect Department of State policy, the two Research Memoranda and the one longer Intelligence Report covering the rebellion in Angola do seem to have been written in support of policy. One of the Research Memoranda begins by setting up the standard, The US had hoped these reforms would set the stage for (1) a marked improvement in the status of Africans, and (2) eventual self-determination in the provinces. and then proceeds to measure Portuguese performance against this U.S. \"hope,\" reporting for example that the Portuguese seem to have little understanding of, or in- clination toward, the positive programs needed to prepare either the African for full participation in modern political or economic life or the overseas provinces for ultimate self-determination. and concluding that The rigid attitude of the present government offers no hope that the principle of self-determination will be accepted in the near future. Thus Portuguese policy is judged in the light of what the U.S. policy maker thinks should be done in Angola. More- over, the publications openly show their anti-Portuguese bias throughout. They refer continually to \"brutal repression\" without mentioning the provocation of African terrorism and cite alleged traits of Portuguese national character: The recently reinforced police, in conjunction with the large military garrisons, can and have suppressed nascent subversive movements with characteristic Portuguese thoroughness and ruthlessness. 00010001-2 Policy Bias SECRET They speak of Portuguese reforms with tongue in cheek and uand n- point again and again to the disparity between principle fact in the ld Angolan is are tall wrong lreforms are really being repo less the fi p undertaken. It is interesting to see the great discrepancy between the reports of the consul in Luanda and the INR publications. The consul is not all-out pro-Portuguese; he is quite critical of many aspects of the policy in Angola. But he also brings out things that ? toward economic and educational lg example reform, the steps the good race relations which obtained in Angola until 1961. He stresses his conviction that statements about rPor Portuguese brutality and the extent of rebellion have been reports greatly the Bg- gerated, a conviction substantiated by appear points do not ish and American attaches.

Since the traveler sources would be scattered all over the United States, the domestic field offices would need central direction from a headquarters staff competent in the Lincoln program. And there was none too much time before the com- ing tourist season, April to October. Representatives from the interested scientific and economic analyst offices were appointed to maintain liaison with the directing staff, providing consumer support and guidance. Ten contact specialists-domestic field officers-and three headquarters officers were put through a crash training pro- gram with the help of the analyst offices and the clandestine collection staff concerned with the U.S.S.R. The ten became the Lincoln officers in the field who helped recommend the selection of travelers to be exploited and, when these were approved, briefed them on requirements and procedures and trained them in making observations; the three went into the Lincoln Staff at headquarters which directed the program, passed on field officer recommendations, arranged special briefings and training as required, and processed the result- ing reports for dissemination. During the 1959 season the program was intentionally ex- perimental and conservative. At its end 3,836 travelers had been screened, preliminary assessments made on 612 and de- terminate assessments on 159, and 64 been briefed. To keep the risks within reasonable limits these travelers were lim- ited to visual, photographic, or conversational observations. They did not see any long-range missile sites, but they helped map the deployment of antiaircraft missiles, and a number of their reports were given high evaluations. Lincoln had not been expected to provide answers to the major substan- tive questions confronting the intelligence community. It had been hoped, however, that its travelers could discover clues to the presence of missile activity and, secondly, pro- vide operational intelligence for clandestine operations against likely targets. It was beginning to fulfill especially the first of these hopes. The value of the 1959 experiment was twofold. First, the wrinkles which any new program is bound to have could be spotted and ironed out. Second, the positive results were promising. Some of the weak points were delays in reporting, Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : Cl SECRET insufficient detail in reports, and dependence in areas of prime interest upon people in exchange groups, who may have less freedom of action than eltoists.

In April 1961, however, with further strains in the international climate, the briefing of Lincoln travelers was prohibited. Second Phase, 1961-62 Meanwhile the community's technical intelligence had done so well with missile deployment that the main focus of un- fulfilled need shifted to pre-deployment missile activity, to re- search and development. In this field no observations a trav- eler could make would be likely to contribute much; the only likely source of information would be a Soviet citizen employed in the activity or a related one. It might be possible, how- ever, for a U.S. citizen with whom such a Soviet citizen had a common bond to draw him out in friendly,, conversation to the point of revealing something useful-the process known in clandestine tradecraft as elicitation. Elicitation has the advantage of being operationally safe; there is nothing illegal about it. It is most likely to be suc- cessful if carried out in a secure and relaxed setting, with- out a language barrier, using an approach which is indirect but has a sense of direction, and working inductively from peripheral manifestations toward the central question. If necessary a silent partner expert in the particular technical field can provide back-up. The elicitor can of course be de- liberately deceived; but the possibility of deception is not unique to elicitation. The important precondition of a com- mon bond is satisfied if the American has a reputation in the Soviet citizen's professional field or one related to it. With these considerations in mind Operation Lincoln was now radically reoriented, and approval was received for a pro- gram of briefing U.S. scientists in missile-related fields to elicit information from Soviet scientists. The intensive briefing includes a broad summary of the organization of research and development under the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a brief summary of what we know of the Soviet missile program, a detailed examination of the Soviet effort in the elicitor's own scientific field, detailed data on the personalities and institu- tions with whom he may be in contact, and information on Soviet counterintelligence and provocation practices and how to defend himself from them. Envisaged is the development Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : SECRET P78TOt9*A0r0 kO 10001-2 of a relatively small number of well-trained, long-range U.S. citizen sources whose information should be reliable because of their own stature and the position of their Soviet inform- ants. The program would concentrate on a directed search involving a limited number of specific targets. Experimental projects along these lines have brought prom- ising results. The reporting on the 12th International As- tronautical Federation held in Washington during October 1961 was evaluated outstanding as an example of what com- prehensive elicitation techniques can accomplish. It gave new as well as confirmatory information about the Soviet man-in-space effort and the fundamentals of Soviet space flight. There was consequently established for the 1962 Con- ference on Space Research an ad hoc task force to coordi- nate intelligence exploitation, and the results achieved com- pared favorably with those from the 1961 conference. Some important information was obtained in the field of bio-astro- nautics, and the elicitation from Gherman Titov was consid- ered quite good. It is too early to judge what the ultimate value of the elici- tation program will be; more time and experience are needed. But the principal beneficiaries of the reoriented Lincoln re- porting, the scientific analysts, are enthusiastic about the prospects of this special collection effort mounted on their behalf. They have drawn up a list of priority interests to guide it and have attempted to point out individuals or types of persons who may make good sources. And at the time of writing there is a recommendation before the USIB for the expansion of Lincoln into other fields of science than those related to guided missiles. It is judged that the program has already provided useful information and has a potential for even more useful information in the future. Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000200010001-2 History of an interrogation pro- gram developed to exploit the USSR's mass repatriation of Spanish refugees. PROJECT NIROS Lawrence E. Rogers At the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War, some 5400 Span- ish citizens were stranded in the Soviet Union, 5000 of them children nine to fifteen years old placed in \"safe refuge\" there by their Republican parents, 150 the adult nurses and teach- ers who accompanied them, and the rest student pilots sent by the Republican government for training. For the next twenty years the children and the pilots were treated not as foreigners in the USSR but pretty much as guest citizens. They were relatively free to travel about the country, and they were afforded unusual opportunities for education and then for employment. About 15 percent attended institutes of higher learning, and another 20 percent were given tech- nical or specialized training, half of these in scientific fields. On reaching adulthood they were offered full Soviet citizen- ship. Only about 35 percent accepted, but all were sovietized in education and in attitudes. Their only real ties to Spain were their families and the stories they had heard during their formative years. Nevertheless, when in 1956 these Spanish \"citizens\" were given the opportunity to be repatriated, some 2400 took advan- tage of it. They arrived back in Spain in seven expeditions be- tween August 1956 and May 1957, plus an eighth in May 1960. For the Spanish government the influx constituted a security hazard, for U.S. intelligence a multitudinous potential source of information on the Soviet Union. This common if somewhat divergent intelligence interest in the re atriates resulted in the establishment in March 1957 of interrogation cen- ter in Madrid, staffed by representatives of three U.S. government departments under a CIA a ministra- tive head. The unique interrogation program lasted four SECRET 75 Approved For Release 2005/04/13: CIA-RDP78T03194A000ApMFQPAGES 75-84 Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : C Project Ninos years, covering some 1800 repatriates and producing more than 2000 positive intelligence reports. From Prototype to Production Line For the first half year the Center had only one CIA and interrogators; in the fall of 1957 three U.S. Air Force and two U.S. Army interrogators were added. During the preliminary phase of the program, which lasted until Au- gust 1958, files were set up on all the repatriates showing their background of education and employment in the USSR (information obtained through interviews conducted by F officers in the provinces), workable arrange- ments were negotiated for sup- port and manpower, and the first interrogations were held. These were devoted to obtaining information of sufficient va- riety and detail to give Washington a basis for evaluating the potential of the sources and determining what amount of ef- fort should accordingly be put into the program. A major obstacle at first to Washington consumers' recog- nition of the significance of information the repatriates might have was the disappointing yield from exploitation of Span- ish Blue Division returnees a year or so earlier. These survi- vors of the Blue Division, which Franco had sent to aid Hitler's armies on the Russian front, had spent eleven years in Soviet concentration camps, and because of their isolation and re- sistance to the Soviets during their imprisonment their con- tribution to intelligence on the USSR was small. The tend- ency among consumers was to view the new repatriates in the same light, a view that took some time to change. The five interrogators added in the fall of 1957 were put to work on several of the most promising sources, repatriates whose background indicated knowledge of the Soviet missile and aircraft program. The reports produced from these in- terrogations gave Washington the first solid proof that the repatriates could provide information in priority fields of So- viet science and technology. At about the same time, scien- tific, economic, and geographic intelligence analysts were fur- nished lists summarizing the background of several hundred repatriates, and a study of these lists indicated that the sources had a potential value far greater than had been as- Approved For Release 2005MIZ : C Project Ninos sumed. The guided missile analysts were the first to take ad- vantage of this discovery: they made a selection of sources to be interrogated in the missile field and dispatched two Mis- sile specialists to Madrid to provide requirements and techni- cal guidance for the interrogations. then, the Center concen- From August to December 1958, trated its efforts on the guided missile sources and others recognized by the newly-arrived requirements specialists as of priority consumer interest. For this purpose the require- ments specialists were integrated into the Center's staff not as advisors but as full working members active in all phases of the operation-the selection of sources, the preparation and conduct of the interrogations, the reporting of the re- sulting information. Initially they converted headquarters' general requirements into questionnaires tailored for the par- ticular repatriates under interrogation. They also prepared a series of basic questionnaires on a number of subjects of special interest to consumers, shaping them to suit the back- ground and experience of the repatriates and the interroga- tion methods used. They kept in touch with each interroga- tion throughout its course, and they gave back-up and tech- nical assistance to the reports officers who put the intelli- gence yield into form for consumers. The function of the requirements section thus developed at this time as one of the cornerstones of the operation be- came standard for the remainder of the program. It reduced the need for constant requirements support from headquar- ters, relieved the chief of the Center of many operational du- ties, and gave the Center a focal point for all positive intel- ligence, whether in the form of source potential, the substance of interrogation, or reported product. In November 1958 it became obvious that if all the repatri- ates who seemed likely to have useful information were to be questioned in any reasonable length of time an expansion of the Center was necessary. During December additional per- sonnel were selected and assigned, and by early February 1959 the Center had doubled in size. The number of interroga- tions held per month grew from 25 in November 1958 to 60 in mid-1959 and 90 in mid-1960, and the number of reports issued per month increased correspondingly from about 30 P78T03414)k'0700200010001-2 SECRET Approved For Release 20051841141: P&SRL T03194A0092R9Q010001-2 in November 1958 to nearly 70 in the spring of 1959 and more than 100 by early 1960. 1 TL 1 7 ]TI ~J A.PPFGyed Far Release 2006904 912 SECRET 25X1 With respect to the security of the Center itself, secrecy as to its location and purpose could be maintained only until it became established and operational. As repatriates were called in for interrogation it became known to them and others, including the Soviet government; several hundred re- patriates, many of whom had been interrogated, returned to the Soviet Union. The security problem was then reduced, to two basic elements: first, to keep the repatriates ignorant of the extent of American involvement in the program, and second, to maintain a reasonable degree of obscurity among residents in the local vicinity about the existence and true nature of the Center. Otherwise the interrogation program 25X1-- - .. a mass program on any high level of secrecy. The Call-In A major management problem was regulation of the flow of repatriates into the Center for interrogation. When, those 78T031 08.M6d9bb1ir1 a particular week had been selected by Approved For Release 2005/04/13 Project Ninos the requirements section, primarily on the basis of the pri- ority of the information the seemed likely to have, they were sent a ummons giving them ten days a vance no ice of the date on which they were to ap- pear. But the number failing to respond to the summons ranged from a fifth of some weekly groups to as high as half of others, and each name included in the call-in lists. which turned out \"negative,\" whether from failure to arrive or from refusal to cooperate, would mean the waste of an average of three days each of interrogator and requirement officer time. Another primary objective of the flow management, in ad- dition to minimizing fluctuations, was to maintain a balance in the composition of each call-in list in terms of staff special- ties in requirements preparation and interrogation. It was not practical, for example, to call in at one time a large num- ber of aircraft workers, because there were only two or three interrogators with good qualifications for handling aircraft technology. But account had to be taken also of places of resi- dence and employment in Spain, of family and political rela- tions, and of economic conditions. It was wise to avoid call- ing a hard professional Communist along with potentially good sources because his presence in the Center might se- riously prejudice their cooperation. Sometimes it was impor- tant to call husband and wife together to promote their co- operation during, interrogation, while in another case it would be a serious mistake because they had opposing views on co- operation with the Center. Job demands, care of children, pregnancy, and illness ac- tual or feigned were frequent reasons for not responding to the call-in. In many cases it was difficult or impossible for the police to find the persons cited in time because of changes of residence, absence on vacation or on trips, or residence in villages difficult of access. Quite a few, mostly hard-core Com- munists, bluntly refused to come to Madrid. One measure tried in the effort to, offset call-in failures was to call a greater number than could be interrogated, in- sofar as this number could be forecast from week to week. But this would result at times in having to double up inter- rogators' assignments or in keeping sources waiting.

During the in- terrogation, discussions were held between the requirements officer and the interrogator usually at the mid-point and after the conclusion of each day's session. When the interrogator indicated that he had completed his interrogation, he and the requirements officer reviewed what had been accomplished, and if it was agreed that nothing of real significance could be gained by additional questioning, the source was released. On completion of the case, the U.S. interrogator would re- work his rough notes into finished report. ave their rough notes to i start winch urne em into a typed report and returned it to the interrogator for review. In general, in- terrogators spent half their time conducting interrogations and the other half working on reports, a proportion that worked out about right. The interrogation of an average source lasted from two to five days, and generally an inter- rogator was assigned a new source each week. If an interro- gation lasted only one or two days and produced nothing of value, the interrogator would be assigned a second source for that week. When the interrogator, had com- pleted his report, it was sent to e U.S. reports section for editorial processing and preparation in final form. After logging it, the reports section sent it first to the requirements section, where the requirements officer who who had handled the case would review it, make sure it included all significant points brought out in the interrogation, provide a prelimi- nary evaluation of the worth and priority of the information, and indicate any numbered headquarters requirements to which it was responsive. It was then returned to the reports section, and a translation priority assigned. Since the bulk of the interrogators' reports were in Spanish, U.S. citizens living in Spain had been hired under contract to help in the translations. Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : Cl SECRET P78T03,t9 A1o66'?80010001-2 The reports officer gave the report an evaluation based on advice in reports memoranda from headquarters, comparisons with past production on the same subject, and further dis- cussion with requirements officers when necessary. When the rough translation was completed he put it into finished form, and it was typed on mats for distribution to consum- ers, except that reports of marginal value were generally for- warded to headquarters either in rough translation or in the original Spanish.

But what were the positive fruits garnered by U.S. intelligence? On its num- ber-one priority target, guided missiles, Project Ninos developed a bulk of information of major significance. It obtained data on the successive stages of Soviet rocket engine development which created a basis for estimating rates of progress in mis- sile development and production. It gave valuable new in- formation on the location of static testing facilities for rocket engines, guided missile testing and development centers, rocket engine production plants, and several surface-to-air missile sites. It furnished detail about rocket engine fuels and, trans- port and identified many personalities in guided missile work. It gave the first identification of several guided missile develop- ment and production installations. It updated by eight years much of the previous intelligence on the Soviet missile pro- gram. The Project Ninos information had an immediate sig- nificant effect on intelligence estimates and also established substantial leads for further expansion of our knowledge in this field. With respect to strategic nuclear weapons, the number-two priority, the repatriates did not have much information of critical importance; but they did give supporting informa- tion about Soviet nuclear power systems, the first data on an atomic-associated plant, and leads to new information on uranium mining and nuclear storage sites.

On military aircraft, the number-three priority, Project Ninos turned out a large volume of information of consider- able value in the preparation of estimates. It reported on con- struction details and the production of Soviet fighter aircraft, furnished detailed layouts of several aircraft development and production facilities, gave the types and quantities of aircraft produced at these facilities, and shed light on the aircraft in- dustry's support to the Soviet missile program. Outside the top priority fields, the repatriates supplied val- uable reports about the Soviet civil defense and shelter pro- gram, military medicine, higher technical education, and conventional military installations and weapons production. They furnished geographic data such as town plans. They had considerable information on Soviet strategic industries- locations and layouts, the construction of new facilities, and the expansion of old ones. One group of returnees made an extremely valuable series of detailed reports on the So- viet electric power industry, including facilities for power dis- tribution and its pattern. The basic and priority intelligence yield of Project Ninos will be useful for many years. It constitutes a reservoir of information that probably could not have been achieved in any other way, even at many times the cost in money and manpower. The guided missile information alone, it is esti- mated, more than paid for the entire project.

He is likewise conscious of the rules and procedures incul- cated by his culture and experience, but also of conditioning circumstances which affect the application- of the rules, so that while he thinks in terms of rules he tends to be incon- sistent in applying them. He has a tolerance for ambiguity and for rationalization; he can \"stretch\" circumstances to justify an action. His behavior thus is governed more by reference points than by absolute dicta, and it is seldom predictable; one can know the factors bearing on his deci- sions but not the precise way in which he will rationalize or resolve them. In interpersonal relations he tends to suppress spontaneous feelings and intuition in favor of an examined and deliberated behavior. He tends to be suspicious and defensive, to \"second- guess\" what is going on, and so to respond in a controlled and calculated way. When he acts angry or charming, it may be only because he thinks that's the way he should act at the moment. Much of the time he is trying to be something that he is not and behaving in ways different from the way he feels. Beneath the superficial expression his attitude may be a negative one of social insulation or withdrawal. Acutely aware of the group, the family, the mass, and the heritage of which they are a part, many Libyans struggle to assert their individual identity. This defensive individualism, coupled with suspiciousness and negativism, makes them poor candidates for effective organization and group effort-the more so since their tendency to rationalize and examine al- ternatives makes it difficult for them to focus on a simple pro- gram or a collective course of action. They do, however, have a capacity for loyalty, particularly of the personal variety based on the satisfaction of recognition and acceptance by an admired leader. This loyalty is dependent on continuous justification and reinforcement, being particularly frangible in the face of rejection, humiliation, or \"unfairness.\" Much that the Libyan does is determined by the immediate situation-by the need to take care of whatever is going on at the moment. He can make a commitment for the future Approved For Release 2H4/13 The Libyan SECRET because that's what's required at the present; whether he fulfills will He will cron the conditions that prevail at oss that bridge when he gets to it. Y~at future time. The Worker The ordinary Libyan workers have a low general level of ef- fective intelligence. The overwhelming majority are oppor- tunity, and the average worker is a man who, given tunity, at best might struggle through the sixth grade. As a, trainee, moreover, he comes from a technically impoverished culture and lacks the general mechanical conditioning which is part of the growing-up experience of the Westerner. He has no basis for filling in the most elementary gaps in in- struction. He can not be expected to do things on the basis of \"common sense,\" since he has had no opportunity to ac- quire it in technical matters. Together with his capacity to find exceptions to the rules, this deficiency can lead to se- rious problems. He can fail to carry out a known action solely because something is the wrong color, or didn't because l me Thursday, or because he \"didn't see it\" or \"you this time.\" He also lacks any preconditioning in the employment rela- tionship of a sort to make him understand the simplest plesteobli- gations and expectations taken for granted by the on even his first job. He is likely to feel that his obligations are fulfilled merely by being hired or by being present. Partly out of self-assertion and partly through naivete, me-too-ism is a large factor in his expectations. If his co-worker is ill for three days, he feels entitled to three days some special sick leave, too; and if someone is granted a bonus for pecal effort, he feels he should have the same reward, on the grounds that he would have done just as well if asked. Sustained pro- duction is a particular area in which the Libyan worker does not share the American's sense of value. The fact that he is able to do so much work in so much time carries no assur- ance that he will. His failure is not necessarily perversity; it is partly due to distractability, partly to unawareness of what is expected, and partly to ineffective self-organization. Approved For Release TIMS113)IM The Avant Garde The elite rising middle class of educated and substantially more intelligent young Libyans differ from their poorer, lower- status countrymen largely in being confused at a higher level.2 They are greatly concerned about their futures, their diverse and manifold opportunities, and their uncertainties. They are thoroughly immersed in an uncertain effort to break away from the \"old\" and to embrace the \"new\" and thereby heavily involved in an intellectual and emotional conflict of serious proportions. They are militantly individualistic and anxious to carve out a unique and independent existence, one of the criteria of which is to \"make a million.\" This young elite reflects at its level the workers' hyper- awareness and distractability, omnivorous but undisciplined intellect, avoidance of simplicity in favor of rationalization and the perusal of alternatives, capacity for superficial, con- trolled expression and emotion, pursuit of independence and individuality at the expense of group identification and group effort, and unwillingness (if not inability) to be consistently productive in any one direction. With all their need to be individuals, they have an equal need for emotional support from outside, for someone to depend upon, to guide them, to accept and understand them. Americans are attractive to these people (albeit with sub- stantial ambivalence) if only because they personify so thor- oughly the New World to which they aspire in contrast to the Old Order from which they seek to escape. But their desire to change their ways and their recognition of the need to change is exceeded only by their awareness of the es- sential sinfulness of trying to change. This conflict brings an earnestness, an eagerness, a sense of illicit passion to their It is important to note the severe limitations of the sample on which these generalizations are based: the investigator met some 30 of these avant-garde Tripolitanians and had lengthy conversations with perhaps half a dozen. Undoubtedly these were all \"selected,\" in some way or other, by various factors-common friends or sources of intro- duction, a more or less common milieu which may or may not represent the \"true\" society of rising middle-class young adults, and other fortuitous circumstances which brought them into view. Nevertheless, as with the worker sample, the consistency of their psychological pattern was so marked as to encourage broad generalization.

They will approach new relation- ships with trepidation even as they adopt new ways with a vengeance; much that they learn will be superficial; much of their behavior will be a veneer; much of their enthusiasm will carry with it an underlayer of guilt or shame or at least uncertainty as to what they should be about. It is virtually impossible to deal with such people su- perficially. Befriending a Libyan is much like acquiring a mistress: once the cautious, tentative, defensive sparring is over, the relationship grows progressively deeper, broader, more involving, more consuming, more demanding. While the affair can be gratifying, it will rarely be tranquil; and there is always the risk that the wrong word, the wrong deed, the wrong interpretation will bring everything to an abrupt halt or a precipitous reversal. Operational Implications: Mass Action As we have seen, the Libyan is generally not an Organiza- tion Man. He is too individualistic, suspicious, diffuse with respect to goals, and vague about the mechanics of organiza- tion. A group of Libyans, endeavoring as peers to organize themselves for some purpose, could well start out with the notion of a common task, but they would soon be over- whelmed by alternative courses of action, competing organiza- tional proposals, and wrangling for leadership. A strong natural leader could impose organization and direction; but the group's effectiveness would depend almost entirely on his ability to perpetuate his control by commanding loyalty on the basis of individual, man-to-man relationships. A respected outsider gifted with organizational know-how and capitalizing on admiration for intellectual prowess and achievement could similarly infuse organization into a Libyan group if he could keep all of the administrative reins in his own hands. Such a master-minded group would ordinarily be vastly more effective than any which Libyans could create on their own, and Libyans on their own would have great dif- ficulty countering it. By way of corollary, it is reasonably safe, when any well organized and systematically effective Libyan group ostensibly chances to emerge, to infer that it has some outside direction. SECRET Approved For Release72005 13 Inability to organize effectively does not imply that Libyans will not organize at all. In view of their susceptibility to charismatic leadership-especially when the appeal is intel- lectual as well as sensory and emotional-it is not difficult to imagine a Libyan mob. But it is one thing to precipitate a mob, another to energize and direct it, and still another to contain and control it. A Libyan mob would be like a herd of c tt a le-a collection of individuals rather than a real social force; physically imposing and threatening, but individually\" rather docile, controlled, and even cowardly; capable of stam peding, but also able to be deflected; incapable of any really sustained collective action; and quite likely to scatter itself aimlessly and dissolve into its component parts as other, needs, interests, and attractions came to attention. Such a mob is at best a limited and unreliable tactical weapon, and no basis for any real social or political reorientation. In general, Libyans are particularly susceptible to demogogic leadership, the strong emotional appeal which plays upon generalized hostility, sensed oppression, etc. But under such stimulation they are more likely to be whipped into negative action than positive. They have a greater capacity to de- stroy what exists than to create something better. Use of Nets With respect to ordinary intelligence operations, whenever there is a choice between handling Libyans as individuals and using them in teams or groups the individual approach is vastly more desirable. Both the operational direction and the personnel handling are much more difficult in the group. It is possible to make use of natural groups, pre-existing cultural organizations like the family where control of the head implies a degree of established control over the mem- bers; but in general it is more realistic to think of Libyans as singletons than as nets, as surveillants than as surveil- lance teams, etc. Except for such natural groups, any attempt to use Libyans in pairs, nets, or teams for a group effort invites a host of difficulties. The principal basis for motivation and control is a direct personal relationship between the trusted case officer Approved For Release 2005/04/1 -RDP70/3*,VR000200010001-2 and the Libyan agent, and anything which makes this re- lationship less direct makes for more difficulty in handling. Employed together, Libyan agents will be suspicious of each other and jealous of their positions vis-a-vis the case officer. Each will be out for all he can get, and in the ensuing com- petition he will expend more energy quibbling over his proper due than in accomplishing his tasks. The case officer will, be continually harassed to render reassurance to each one in. turn and will find it virtually impossible to set rewards or as- sign tasks on the basis of merit and capability. A good analogy is that of a man with several wives, each demanding assur-- ante that she is Number One. When a relationship has been established with a Libyan, any effort to impose another in the chain of command, whether as a principal agent or as a cut-out, invites disaster. At the least it creates a threat to the original agent's sense of identification and personal security; if he doesn't lose all of his motivation, he will at least make efforts to re-establish personal contact, meanwhile nursing his jealousy, mistrust, humiliation, and feeling of inferiority. Handling the Singleton Working with the singleton Libyan does not eliminate the problems, but it makes it possible to handle them individually. The Libyan's relationship to the case officer will be a very personal one; the case officer may take an objective and business-like view of it, but the Libyan won't, even if he makes it look that way. The fact that the relationship exists means that the Libyan is bringing to it a large capacity for personal dependency in his need of guidance and support, and also his personal loyalty, eagerness, enthusiasm, and his ver- sion of conscientiousness-together with all the negative corollaries of jealousy, suspicion, sensed rejection, humilia- tion, and general sensitivity. At any particular moment the most important thing to the Libyan is to maintain the relationship at the most satisfy- ing level. Hence his enthusiasm and willingness to agree to anything that is asked of him; and hence also his propensity to conceal any failures and if necessary to lie in order to de- -RDP78T03194A000200010001-2 SECRET Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : Cl The Libyan liver what he thinks the case officer wants. In both cir- cumstances, he is responding to what is most important to him, now. While his capacity to reach agreement and understand- ing, now, is thus very high, his capacity to carry out what he has agreed to do is likely to be less; and it is conditioned not only by his real abilities but also by the \"now\" requirements and relationships when the time comes for action. When he is engaged in his operational tasks the pressure of the im- mediate situation is much stronger than that of the require- ments laid upon him earlier. He has a new set of personal relationships to maintain, and he may find that the circum- stances aren't \"exactly\" as expected and therefore the pre- scribed rules and guidance aren't \"exactly\" applicable. Then in reporting back to his case officer he is again disposed to make the review as pleasant as possible. At the very least he will be able to rationalize any failure to perform the task as intended; at worst he may fabricate the procedures, the conditions, and the results. It should not be construed that the Libyan agent is there- fore a pathological liar, or intentionally evasive, or wilfully negativistic or misleading. On the contrary, he is enthusiastic and conscientious in his way; but he is not objective, practical, or self-disciplined. Thus he can overcommit himself, partly out of eagerness and partly because he is ignorant of or de- fensive about his own limitations. In carrying out his tasks he is susceptible to distraction and deflection, and he is par- ticularly a creature of the circumstances in which he finds himself. Thus it is unfair to expect that he will do things wrong in any intentional sense, but it is appropriate to ex- pect that if something can go wrong it probably will. The case officer has accordingly a more than ordinary need to ap- praise his agent's skills and abilities and to evaluate the con- ditions under which any operational task is going to be per- formed. The reliability of the agent will depend in large measure on the case officer's ability to judge independently whether he can reasonably be expected to perform this task under these circumstances.

For example: His report of a political rally is likely to be accurate with respect to who was there and what was said. This may be inconsistent with his interpretation of the implications of the meeting; but this interpretation may, in turn, be an accurate report of something which was said there, or of something told him by way of explanation. His efforts to assess other. persons are particularly subject to error, especially when there is room for coloration through the influence of loyalty, suspicion, or other source of bias. The Libyan should have little difficulty, relative to his in- dividual mental level, learning the mechanics and procedures of clandestinity; but his ability to learn them does not imply rigor or discipline in applying them. There are few substi- tutes for out-and-out conditioning, in the purest Pavlovian sense, to insure that he will carry through a particular pro- cedure under a particular set of circumstances: his training should be practical, repetitious, and continuous in this re- gard. Conversely, it would be a mistake to assume that be- cause he has learned something in an academic sense he can then be left to his discretion to carry through as ap- propriate. His attention to security will be compounded of natural sus- piciousness, personal fears and anxieties, and status needs: the Libyan is both self-protective and self-assertive. Ordi- narily he will not do anything which he recognizes is a per- sonal risk; but he may underestimate the risk involved in bragging about his accomplishments and associations. How- ever subtle the approach, the best means of keeping him dis- creet would seem to be \"to scare hell out of him.\" Controls As already noted, the best control over the Libyan agent is the quality of his personal relationship with his case officer. To the extent that the case officer is the One Man who has understood him, respected him, been fair to him, trusted him, etc., etc. (a condition which must be developed over time and at the expenditure of much Christian Virtue, tongue-biting, cheek-turning, and pride-swallowing), the Libyan can be loyal, dedicated, earnest, and sincere. He will remain sensi- Approved For ReleSzECR 2005/ The Libyan SECRET Live and thin-skinned, however; and while it is permissible and appropriate for the case officer to be firm and legalistic, he must scrupulously avoid slights, insults, and humiliations. Reaching an agreement with the Libyan with respect to conditions of employment, as in the task briefing, is af- fected by his capacity to rationalize and be specific, legalistic, or interpretive as suits his interest, and by the fact that he is oriented toward the future while dominated by the present. His assertion of Word and Honor is earnest enough, but it does not connote the same specificity and quid-pro-quo as to the Westerner. While being honorable in fulfilling an obligation he retains a capacity for continually reinterpreting the mean- ing and expectations of the commitment. For example, he can insist on being paid \"as agreed\" even though his produc- tivity for a particular period is nil, or he can insist on the adequacy of an inadequate product by debating the criteria, the circumstances, etc. An agreement to pay a specified amount for general serv- ices to be rendered therefore invites an inadequate product and leaves the case officer no recourse against the agent's in- sistence that he did what was required. Similarly, a guaran- teed salary against tasks \"to be defined\" invites a continuing reduction of effort or insistence on increasing pay for al- legedly increasing requirements. Insofar as possible, the whole scope of tasks, duties, and expectations should be laid out in detail at the beginning. Otherwise the later elabora- tion of duties can be construed as new requirements over and above the initial agreement. Perhaps the best payment-for-value control exists in a graduated piece-work arrangement within which payment de- pends on the effectiveness with which various criteria are met. This will not eliminate haggling but at least confines it to specifics and provides the case officer a basis for educating his agent in what is expected of him. Escrow accounts have a carrot-and-stick value provided precautions are taken against any implications of automatic payment; and they should be embellished with bank books or other concrete devices to give the agent satisfaction in the \"now\" while encouraging him to continue producing. SECRET CIA-RDP78TO3194A000200010001-2 Approved For Release 2005/041, The Libyan Contracts are at least an ambivalent and at best a marginal form of control. In his system of values, a Libyan's Word is his Honor. Whatever the reservations in an Arab's use of these terms, his Word is therefore as binding as any formal agreement; and he may construe insistence on a contract as an affront to his integrity. On the other hand, some con- tracts play a part in his own legal structure (as witness the marriage contract), and to some Libyans this formalization of the agreement may have a reifying value. In this sense it is worth pursuing. If obtained, it remains a reference point (though not necessarily a binding one) in future haggling: it is at least a way of reminding him of what he agreed to \"once,\" notwithstanding all the changes which he will note have since taken place. Contracts are thus worth getting if it can be done easily, but there is not enough intrinsic con- trol value in them to risk damaging the relationship in going after them. The ability to conduct surveillance (technically, or with third-nationals, in view of the difficulty of managing a Libyan surveillance team) can be a real asset to the case officer. Since the immediate circumstances, rather than require- ments and agreements, have the greatest bearing on the Libyan's behavior when on target, it follows that he has little guilt, little. anxiety, little conscience about not following through precisely as expected. He sees nothing wrong in do- ing something wrong or in rationalizing or lying about it; the only thing wrong is to get caught at it. Surveillance brings him closer to being caught at it, and with a little conditioning of this kind he may develop a substitute conscience, a big- brother-is-watching-me concern which may make the case of- ficer's admonitions and requirements more binding in the ac- tion situation. Application of the polygraph as a control mechanism is par- ticularly complicated with Libyans. The mere introduction of the device constitutes a personal threat, an insult, a ques- tioning of his integrity; if this is true in general, it is more intensely so with Libyans because of the particular emotion- alism and defensiveness with which they regard such mat- ters as Word, Honor, and Trust. The situation is patently paradoxical: the Libyan cannot tolerate an objective test of Approved For ReleasV M/04/' The Libyan SECRET these qualities, knowing that they will be found in some ways lacking; the very strength of the polygraph is thus its great- est threat, constituting a risk to the relationship. The im- plication of mistrust and rejection can mean to the agent that the case officer is, after all, no better than all the other peo- ple in the world he's never been able to get along with. Aside from this very personal and very emotional reaction to the use of the polygraph, there will be room for considerable confusion in the interrogation in identifying what the Libyan is reacting to. Within his over-all emotional reaction his specific reactions can be very equivocal different f thethvalues va11 en which they are based can be quite inferred by his managers. It will require a great deal of cul- tural as well as personal insight to know what he feels guilty about; he is not likely to be defensive about many things he m defensive abcase officer out feels are the case officer tisaunawa ea o f oe r ere.- def e gards as insignificant.

Libyans guilt is associated with being caught and exposed; all will rail against an e:tposed culprit.

THE BEGINNINGS OF AIR TARGETING' W. W. Rostow In World War I a certain amount of experience with tactical bombing had been developed, and such conceptions as the es- tablishment of local air supremacy, the isolation of the battle- field, and direct attack on the enemy's troops and emplace- ments were familiar. Neither these operations, however, nor the German 1940-41 attacks on Great Britain and the Royal Air Force's night offensive developing in 1942 had begun to solve the problems of applying the power of a strategic air force. In strategic bombing the target is the vast structure of economic and civil life which supports the military effort. Until 1943 both the German and the British bomber forces had chosen to belabor that structure at many points simul- taneously, both by attacks upon cities and by unsystematic attacks on more precise targets, aiming to bring about some vaguely defined collapse, either economic or political, which would lead to military capitulation. The American precision bombing forces beginning to arrive in England knew that they would have to start operations on a small scale, limiting themselves at first to attacking a rela- tively small number of carefully chosen targets. The slow rate of build-up of the U.S. forces in the European theater thus had the virtue that it forced the Air Staff to forego dur- ing the first year and a half of operations any such dreams of causing a Wagnerian cataclysm; and by the time full strength and capabilities were reached at the end of February 1944, a well-disciplined air doctrine had crystallized and had been generally accepted. It was appreciated by the U.S. air officers in London charged with plans at that early period that a precision bomb- ing program would be extraordinarily dependent on detailed Approved For Release 2005/04/13 : CIA-RDP78T03194A00020A 10001-2 MORI/HRP PAGES Al-A24 Air Targeting Approved For Release 2005/04/13 Air Targeting intelligence concerning the location and importance of ele- ments in the enemy's. war production structure. They had in- vestigated the sources of British intelligence and the forms in which it was organized, and they had concluded that, while the raw materials for guiding a precision bombing pro- gram existed, an intensive search through these materials and critical examination and organization of them would be required if targets were to be well chosen. There was no staff within the air force that could carry out the kind of technical studies envisaged, and civilian aid was invoked. The Economic Objectives Unit The civilians in question were a group of scholar-analysts posted to London from the Research and Analysis Branch of the Office of Strategic Services,2 eventually augmented by three people from the Board of Economic Warfare. In September 1942 they formed the Economic Objectives Unit, which served the U.S. Strategic Air Force and other British and American headquarters in a semi-independent, advisory status through- out the war. Gradually developing its functions out of par- ticular requirements and situations, EOU ultimately per- formed four distinct types of services. First, chronologically, were detailed studies of the layouts of targets and the objec- tives within them whose destruction would cause the greatest loss of production. Second were analyses of enemy industries as target systems, furnishing the basis for calculating the probable returns from systematic attack on alternative target systems against the comparative costs. Third were occasional but important ventures in drafting operational plans. Fourth was the assignment of EOU analysts to particular branches of the air and ground staffs to help guide their execu- tion of the air offensive. These activities taken together con- stitute the full range of functions for an air force target sec- tion. .As a result of the unorthodoxy of its organizational status, however, EOU's contribution was more often informal than formal, more often anonymous than identified; and its voice 'For an account of an earlier pioneering study done by the R & A Branch, and by some of the same analysts, see \"The Eastern Front at the Turning Point\" in Intelligence Articles VI 4 p 15 i~ Approved torelease 2005/ was but one of many in the shaping of bombing policy. Even to the extent that bombing operations actually took the image for which it argued, it could claim no unique responsibility except perhaps for the tactical attack on the Seine-Loire bridges in connection with the Normandy landings. With this exception its position, until it finally won a place on the Combined Strategic Target Committee in November 1944, was that of serving those who carried the very great burden of persuading the executive authorities to the desired course of action. Within the informal framework of the whole planning group EOU's part had two distinguishing characteristics. First, it was an intelligence organization at the working level, and in fact the only organization in the theater devoted solely to the development of target intelligence and target thinking. It always remained close to the basic raw information; its papers, even at their most theoretical, stood against a back- ground of reading ground reports, analyzing targets building by building, measuring bridges, cleaning and recording mark- ings from a pile of German ball bearings. It had not only to organize existing information in relevant forms but to guide interrogations, photographic interpretation, and secret intel- ligence and to seek out new sources to produce the appropri- ate raw information. Second, it had thrashed out in its first six months a group of concepts which came close to constituting a general theory of strategic air bombardment. These were refined over the subsequent two years by fresh minds and enriched by experi- ence with actual air operations both strategic and tactical. Thus there grew up within the unit a set of criteria against which any proposed program was explicitly measured. The vitality of the concepts developed is attested by the entrance into the common air intelligence vocabulary of such unlovely but useful phrases as target system, interdiction, cushion, depth, pattern of consumption, pipeline. At the outbreak of war it was settled air staff policy in both the British and American services that operations and intelligence be sharply separated. In British practice Air Ministry Intelligence and Air Ministry Bomber O ti pera ons A4=7aT9 `, 4#AAW,0A1901Wi er had any serious influence A3 Air Targeting Approved For Release 2005/04/1 on target policy within RAF Bomber Command. But it was in the nature of precision bombing, as opposed to area bombing, that close liaison between operations and intelli- gence was required, and EOU's irregular status put it in posi- tion to help forge that link. It was an evident lesson of the European experience that classic staff channels and pro- cedures are demonstrably inadequate for the effective con- duct of precision air operations. Aiming Point Reports The EOU analysts soon discovered that although the British were getting and analyzing a vast amount of data, they were doing little work explicitly addressed to the needs of a pre- cision bombing program. The Ministry of Economic War- fare analyzed a large flow of assorted intelligence mainly to throw light on the over all G - erman economic position rather than its target vulnerability. The Air Ministry was rapidly improving its knowledge of the German air force and refining its analysis, but the target aspects of the Luftwaffe were, with certain exceptions, neglected. Arrangements were therefore made for EOU to get the raw data, as well as products of analysis, in order to organize it in forms required by the U.S. air force. The first assignment from the 8th Air Force was to analyze individual industrial targets, specifying the importance of the plant within the industry in question, the function of each of its buildings, the vulnerability of the processes it carried on, its probable rate of recovery after successful attack, and what sections of it should be destroyed to obtain the greatest and longest-lived effects on total output. No guidance was given to EOU at this time with respect to the factories or the in- dustries in which the Air Force was then operationally inter- ested, so that the full range of industry in German Europe was open to the first experimental analyses. Such an analysis required not only all the data available from ground reports, PW interrogations, and photographic interpretation on the plant in question, but also a visit to at least one British factory carrying out the same process. The layout and operations of such a lant w0 be thoroughly examined and the judgment of the ma a gerd obtained about Approved For Release 2005/04/ -RDP78T03194A000200010001-2 Air Targeting the vulnerability and importance of different sections. Some of the plants visited at this time and reported on in detail were ones producing synthetic oil, ignition equipment, propel- ler forgings, and motor cars. In November the first sample analyses of German plants, including for example one on the Siemens Cable Works, Berlin, were submitted to and ap- proved by the 8th Air Force, which now indicated the chief current air force target interests to be ball bearings, rubber and tires, and oil. The period of groping thus ended and work could begin purposefully on a relatively limited number of plants. During the succeeding 18 months 285 so-called Aim- ing Point reports were produced. These reports were used by the 8th and 15th Air Force bomber commands both as general intelligence summaries and in setting operational aiming points for attack. They also supplied a basis for damage assessment, and they served as a guide to interrogators in the collection of further intelli- gence. More broadly, they established a definite form for the organization of intelligence for precision bombing purposes and a mode of thinking about precise targets. In their detail. and specificity they were an innovation, and British intelli- gence regarded the EOU interest in particular buildings as an. evidence of undue optimism and even of faint morbidity. In a sense that scepticism was justified. For precision bombing as carried out by the American heavy bombers was, in fact, pattern bombing. Only a few targets, for example synthetic oil plants, had a plant area larger than the mini- mum bomb pattern, so that in most instances the physical center of the plant could serve as an adequate operational aiming point. Nevertheless these reports lent precision to thinking on target problems and added a new element in target intelligence work. Theory of Target Selection The Aiming Point reports involved collecting facts and or- ganizing them in reasonable form, but they did not call for elaborate thinking. They engaged the energy and inventive- ness of the EOU staff but not its bent to look for first prin- ciples and establish new concepts. It was evident, moreover, lA-RDP78 1 A 66 M 1W0lQ reach the heart of the target prob- Air Targeting Approved For Release 2005/04/13 I lem. For these reasons the unit began to interest itself in the theory of target choice.
