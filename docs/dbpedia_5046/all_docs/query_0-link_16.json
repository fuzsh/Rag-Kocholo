At a senior staff meeting four days later, August 7, Gilruth commented on the Titan II's promise for human spaceflight, particularly its potential ability to place larger payloads in orbit than could Atlas, which would make it \"a desirable booster for a two-man spacecraft.\" Martin had estimated the cost of procuring and launching nine Titan II boosters, with cost of ancillary equipment, at $47,889,000 spread over fiscal years 1962 through 1964.[6]\n\nTommy Douglas, the Premier of Saskatchewan, was elected as the first leader of Canada's newly formed New Democratic Party on the penultimate day of the party's organizational convention.

Staying up for 25 hours and 18 minutes, he became the first human to sleep while in outer space, and the first to be in space for more than a day.[26] He was also the first to experience the nausea of \"space sickness\".[27] At the age of 25, Titov set a record that still stands, as the youngest person ever to go into Earth orbit.[28] At the time that Titov became the second human into Earth orbit, the U.S. had yet to send an astronaut past the planet's gravitational pull.[29] The spacecraft weighed 13 pounds (5.9 kg) more than Vostok 1 (April 12, 1961), and the progress of Cosmonaut Titov's flight was reported continuously on Radio Moscow.[2]\n\nBritish driver Stirling Moss won the 1961 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.\n\nBorn: Ali Abbasi, Pakistani-Scottish television presenter (d. 2004); in Karachi\n\nDied: Jozef-Ernest van Roey, 87, Belgian cardinal and Archbishop of Mechelen since 1926\n\nThe famous Milgram Experiment began on the campus of Yale University, as psychologist Stanley Milgram tested the willingness of test subjects to administer torture to other people, rather than to disobey rules.[30] The study, which would continue until March 1962, used a machine that was labeled \"Shock Generator, Type ZLB\" and \"Output 15 Volts— 450 Volts\". Unaware that they were the study subjects, volunteers were given the role of \"teacher\" to assist the experimenter and given a mild shock to show what the \"shock generator\" was capable of, then pressured by the experimenter into giving increasing amounts of voltage to a \"learner\" on the other side of a window. In all cases, the \"learner\" was pretending to receive painful shocks from the Type ZLB machine. Milgram's experiment showed that, in almost two-thirds of the experiments, the volunteers would continue to follow orders from the authority figure to deliver shocks.[31]\n\nThe Cape Cod National Seashore was created, as President Kennedy signed legislation setting aside 68 square miles (180 km2) of land in his native Massachusetts for public use. It was the first U.S. National Park to be established from land not already owned by the federal government, and was acquired by eminent domain with the U.S. Department of the Interior paying the landowners for the land taken.[32]\n\nOn the day of Titov's return, the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate approved $1,671,735,000 in aid to the U.S. space program by voice vote. The quickly passed bill devoted $471,750,000 funding for a crewed mission to the Moon.[33]\n\nVostok 2 completed its mission, after cosmonaut Gherman Titov parachuted from the returning craft and landed at 10:18 near Krasny Kut, in Soviet Russia.[34]\n\nBorn:\n\nIleen Getz, American actress (d. 2005); in Bristol, Pennsylvania\n\nWalter Swinburn, English jockey (d. 2016); in Oxford\n\nBrian Conley, English entertainer; in Paddington\n\nDied: Frank N.

Stashinsky told the CIA that he had been trained to use a device that sprayed hydrogen cyanide gas, and that, when sprayed directly into the faces of his victims, the poison would cause immediate death similar to that of a heart attack.

In a letter read to a surprised Chamber of Deputies at 3:00 that afternoon, four hours after Quadros left Brasília, he wrote that \"Terrible forces rose against me and plotted against me or maligned me, even while pretending to collaborate.\" It was speculated that the popular Quadros had gambled that the National Congress would ask him to return and grant him stronger powers, rather than let his unpopular vice-president, João Goulart, take office.

Tests were initiated in an environment more severe than had been conducted in prelaunch activities and tests, but no premature firings occurred. As a backup, McDonnell was asked to design a mechanical-type hatch. The model weighed some 60 pounds (27 kg) more than the explosive type, so other methods had to be sought to prevent any recurrence of the incident. A procedure was initiated which stipulated that the firing plunger safety pin would be left in place until the helicopter hook was attached to the spacecraft and tension was applied to the recovery cable.[2]\n\nSchool segregation in Atlanta ended after more than a century, and without serious incident, as nine African-American students enrolled in four previously all-White schools Henry W.
