        "text": "Civilian honor awarded by the Soviet Union\n\nAward\n\nOrder of LeninTypeSingle-grade orderAwarded for\n\noutstanding services rendered to the State,\n\nexemplary service in the armed forces,\n\npromoting friendship and cooperation between people and in strengthening peace, and\n\nmeritorious services to the Soviet state and society\n\nCountrySoviet Union Presented bySoviet UnionEligibilityCitizens of the Soviet Union; foreigners; institutions, enterprises and collectivesStatusAwarded only by the CPRFEstablished6 April 1930First awarded23 May 1930Last awarded21 December 1991Total431,418PrecedenceNext (lower)Order of the October Revolution\n\nThe Order of Lenin (Russian: Орден Ленина, romanized: Orden Lenina, pronounced [ˈordʲɪn ˈlʲenʲɪnə]) was an award named after Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the October Revolution. It was established by the Central Executive Committee on 6 April 1930. The order was the highest civilian decoration bestowed by the Soviet Union. The order was awarded to:\n\nCivilians for outstanding services rendered to the State\n\nMembers of the armed forces for exemplary service\n\nThose who promoted friendship and cooperation between people and in strengthening peace\n\nThose with meritorious services to the Soviet state and society[1]\n\nFrom 1944 to 1957, before the institution of specific length of service medals, the Order of Lenin was also used to reward 25 years of conspicuous military service. Those who were awarded the titles \"Hero of the Soviet Union\" and \"Hero of Socialist Labour\" were also given the order as part of the award. It was also bestowed on cities, companies, factories, regions, military units, and ships. Various educational institutions and military units who received the said Order applied the full name of the order into their official titles.\n\nThe first design of the Order of Lenin was sculpted by Pyotr Tayozhny and Ivan Shadr based on sketches by Ivan Dubasov. It was made by Goznak of silver with some lightly gold-plated features. It was a round badge with a central disc featuring Vladimir Lenin's profile surrounded by smokestacks, a tractor and a building, possibly a power plant. A thin red-enamelled border and a circle of wheat panicles surrounded the disc. At the top was a gold-plated \"hammer and sickle\" emblem, and at the bottom were the Russian initials for \"USSR\" (Russian: СССР) in red enamel. Only about 800 of this design were minted. It was awarded between 1930 and 1932.[2]\n\nThe second design was awarded from 1934 until 1936. This was a solid gold badge, featuring a silver plated disc bearing Lenin's portrait. The disc is surrounded by two golden panicles of wheat, and a red flag with \"LENIN\" in Cyrillic script (Russian: ЛЕНИН). A red star is placed on the left and the \"hammer and sickle\" emblem at the bottom, both in red enamel.\n\nThe third design was awarded from 1936 until 1943. The design was the same as previous, but the central disc was gray enamelled and Lenin's portrait was a separate piece made of platinum fixed by rivets.\n\nThe fourth design was awarded from 1943 until 1991. Design was the same as previous, but was worn as a medal suspended from a ribbon (all previous were screwback).\n\nThe badge was originally worn by screwback on the left chest without a ribbon. Later it was worn as a medal suspended from a red ribbon with pairs of yellow stripes at the edges (see image above). The ribbon bar is of the same design. The portrait of Lenin was originally a riveted silver piece. For a time it was incorporated into a one-piece gold badge, but finally returned as a separate platinum piece until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.\n\nOrder of Lenin type 1 (1930–32)\n\nOrder of Lenin type 2 (1934–36)\n\nOrder of Lenin type 3 (1936–43)\n\nOrder of Lenin type 4 (1943–91)\n\nThe first Order of Lenin was awarded to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda on 23 May 1930. Also among the first ten recipients were five industrial companies, three pilots, and the Secretary to the Central Executive Committee Avel Enukidze. The first person to be awarded a second Order of Lenin was the pilot Valery Chkalov in 1936. Another pilot, Vladimir Kokkinaki, became the first to receive a third Order in 1939.\n\nThe first five foreign recipients – who were presented with the Order on 17 May 1932 – comprised a German and four US citizens, one of whom was Frank Bruno Honey.[3] They received the award for helping in the reconstruction of Soviet industry and agriculture, during 1931–1934.[4]\n\nIn total, 431,418 orders were awarded, with the last on 21 December 1991.\n\n11 times:\n\nNikolay Patolichev, longtime Minister for Foreign Trade of the USSR[5]\n\nDmitriy Ustinov, Defence Minister in 1976–1984\n\n10 times:\n\nEfim Slavsky, Head of Sredmash, the ministry responsible for nuclear industry, in 1957–1986\n\nAlexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev, aircraft designer\n\nSharaf Rashidov, soviet statesman, writer.\n\n9 times:\n\nPetr Dementiev [ru], Minister of Aviation Industry 1953–1977\n\nVasily Ryabikov, defence industry official, co-head (together with Sergey Korolev) of the first Sputnik project\n\nNikolay Semyonov, winner of 1956 Nobel Prize in chemistry\n\nAnatoly Petrovich Alexandrov; president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (1975–1986)\n\nVasily Chuikov, World War II commander\n\nJabbor Rasulov, First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan\n\nIvan Papanin, polar explorer\n\n8 times:\n\nLeonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Soviet Union\n\nKliment Voroshilov, Marshal of the Soviet Union\n\nAll fifteen republics of the Soviet Union\n\nKomsomol, the Young Communist League\n\nLOMO, Leningrad Optical-Mechanical Corporation\n\nZIL, automobile manufacturer (for their manufacturing of weapons and ammunition)\n\nKryvorizhstal, massively successful and profitable steel mill\n\nMoscow Region\n\nKomsomolskaya Pravda newspaper[6]\n\nPravda newspaper\n\nCities of Moscow, Donetsk, and Yekaterinburg\n\n62nd Army for extraordinary valor in the defence of Stalingrad\n\nSaint Petersburg Electrotechnical University \"LETI\"\n\nSoviet ship Stary Bolshevik, for the courage in Convoy PQ 16 (World War II).\n\nSergey Afanasyev (Soviet \"Space Minister\", awarded 7 times)\n\nAziz Aliyev (Azerbaijani and Dagestani politician and scientist, awarded 2 times)\n\nSona Akhundova-Bagirbekova (Azerbaijani ophthalmologist)\n\nGeorge Avakian American record producer who promoted international musical exchange between Russian and American musicians.\n\nKateryna Boloshkevich, (Ukrainian weaver and statesperson, awarded 2 times)\n\nValeriy Borzov (Soviet Ukrainian sprinter)\n\nGertrude Boyarski (Polish partisan during WWII)\n\nEmilian Bukov (Soviet writer for the Moldavian SSR, awarded 2 times)\n\nLyudmila Byakova (Russian seamstress)\n\nSukarno (President of Indonesia)\n\nFidel Castro (President of Cuba)\n\nKonstantin Chelpan (Chief designer of the T-34 tank engine)\n\nLuis Corvalán (secretary general of the Communist Party of Chile)\n\nÁlvaro Cunhal (Portuguese politician and writer; instrumental in the overthrow of the fascist dictatorial regime of Estado Novo)\n\nSripad Amrit Dange (Indian Communist leader who had strongly endorsed pro-Soviet views)[7]\n\nMario Del Monaco (Italian tenor)\n\nValentina Dimitrieva (farm worker)[8]\n\nChandra Rajeswara Rao (He was one of the leaders of the Telangana Rebellion (1946–1951).
