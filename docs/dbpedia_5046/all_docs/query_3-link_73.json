He exhibits exceptional perseverance when carrying out military assignments’ Signed by Commander of the 5th Battalion, 71st Automobile Regiment, Captain Obryvalin.\n\nLittle is known of Gurin’s further war service but if supporting the 1st Belarussian Front it is likely that he went on to assist with the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January 1945 and the final assault on Berlin in April-May 1945, although he was not entitled to the Medal for the Capture of Berlin according to his award sheet. After the war he continued to service in the Red Army being awarded the Medal for the 30th Anniversary of the Soviet Army and Navy on 22nd February 1948 and an unnumbered Medal for Combat Merit for 10 Years Service in the Red Army on 19th November 1951, before being awarded his second Order of the Red Star (3423489) for 15 Years Service in the Red Army on 30th December 1956.\n\nAt the time of this final award Gurin was serving as a Captain, Deputy Company Commander for technical matters in the 598th Independent Motor Transport Company, 31st Guards Airborne Division, and was living at 24 Lenin Street, city of Novograd-Volynsky, Zhitomir Oblast."
