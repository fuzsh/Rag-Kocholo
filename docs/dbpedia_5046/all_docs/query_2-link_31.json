        "text": "It is known that in our own timeline (OTL) that the Soviets would become the first country to launch a satellite into low-earth orbit on the 4th of October 1957, beating the Americans to their own commitment of launching a satellite as part of the International Geophysical Year, creating a whole scare in the United States, a red scare, that the Soviet Union, the evil communists, were catching up to the free and capitalist West + the United States.\n\nBut, what if something else had happened? The main point of divergence (POD) (there are many other PODs in this timeline) for this timeline is that the United States agrees to the U.S. Army's proposal of launching the Explorer satellite with a PGM-11 Redstone rocket instead of the U.S. Navy's Vanguard satellite on a Vanguard rocket, as such the USA launches the Explorer 1 satellite on the 2nd of October 1957, while the Soviet R-7 Semyorka rocket would suffer a rapid unscheduled disassembly due to the accidental ignition of the second stage while still on the launch pad, as shown in the picture, despite attempts by the Soviets to hide this failure, the Americans would reveal it and essentially embarrass the Soviets by calling it Flopnik and Kaputnik (something that in OTL was used as a nickname for America's own failed Vanguard launch).\n\nThis causes the Soviet Union to go on a space race attitude, establishing their own space agency Roscosmos, consolidating their space program, which prompts President Eisenhower to do the same soon after. They also begin creating very sensationalized propaganda of the soviet/socialist dream ushering in the space age and conquering space, freeing it (and Earth) from the corruption of the capitalist economic system and ideology, among many other things, basically, this is a weird timeline where the Soviets try to one-up the Americans and not vice-versa and it leads to the timeline below.\n\nThe Timeline of a Space Lover is a hard science fiction timeline, which utilizes scientific accuracy and logic alongside more fictional ideas that may be employed in this timeline due to its nature as being more inclided towards space exploration than in our own timeline.\n\nTimeline[]\n\nThe 1950s[]\n\n1952: The International Geophysical Year (IGY) would be announced and be set for July 1st 1957 until December 31st, 1958, it representing an international scientific project and would encompass 11 Earth sciences (aurora, airglow, cosmic rays, geomagnetism, gravity, ionospheric physics, precision mapping, meterology, oceanography, seismology and solar activity) and the period of 1957-1958 would also see solar cycle 19, it being the 19th one since 1755, meaning that the timing for it was particularly suited for studying some of these phenomena.\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower is elected President of the United States. Soviets would begin launching their own R-1 rocket, their own version of the V-2 rocket reverse-engineering it with the help of Nazi scientists they kidnapped, something the USA also did after World War II. The Eisenhower-Nixon ticket would make great use of political slogans, such as I Like Ike and his popularity as a World War II veteran who was responsible for the success of D-Day and also for his north african Operation Torch.\n\nThe United Kingdom successfully tests its first nuclear weapon, Hurricane, on the western coast of Australia, becoming the 3rd country after the United States and the Soviet Union to perform such a feat.\n\nWernher Von Braun, a Nazi scientist taken by the Americans as part of Operation Paperclip, publishes a series of articles known as \"Man Will Conquer Space Soon!\", which not only includes ideas for satellites and men in low-earth orbit, but also crewed missions to Mars and orbital space stations meant for long-term human habitation in space, using something known as the Ferry Rocket, it being a super-heavy rocket that has on its first stage 78 engines and would be by far the largest rocket, it looking oddly similar to the V-2 rocket, but way bigger.\n\n1953: Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin would die and after some internal power struggles would be succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who promised a more moderate approach, even secretly denouncing Stalin and announcing de-stalinization. Dwight D. Eisenhower is inaugurated as President of the United States. The Soviets and the Americans begin drawing their eyes towards\n\nlaunching the first satellite and the missile arms race, despite not yet publicly saying it, but they're building the R-7 (Soviet Space Program) and the SM-65 Atlas (U.S. Air Force) intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nPrincess and the Duchess of Edinburgh Elizabeth officially becomes Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and all of Britain's dominions (the British Empire). She would be the first female monarch since Queen Victoria who died in 1901 and her reign would begin a great change, through something known as decolonization, even if not directly influenced by her as the monarch's powers were mostly ceremonial.\n\n1954: The Americans successfully launch the Viking 11 rocket, a sounding rocket that would be sub-orbital, with the capability of reaching 82 km, near the 100 km Karman line set by the International Aeronautics Federation (FAI) and the Americans would initiate Project Orbiter, a joint U.S. Army and Navy project meant to use a Redstone rocket to send a satellite into orbit. The Soviets also launch their R-5 rocket, an intermediate range ballistic missile, it being a successful test of a sounding rocket as well.\n\nThe United States of America tests, at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, the most powerful hydrogen bomb so far, that being Castle Bravo, which would have a yield of 15 megatons, around x2 more than what was expected due to some not understood properties of lithium deuteride, a component of the fusion-stage of the bomb and because of this, large amounts of radiation would be emitted across the atoll, affecting the lives of many indigenous people there. In the same year, the weaker Castle Romeo test is also conducted.\n\n1955: President Eisenhower accepts the joint U.S. Army-Navy proposal of launching on a PGM-11 Redstone rocket as part of the International Geophysical Year (IGY), rejecting the our own timeline accepted proposal by the Navy to launch the Vanguard satellite on a Vanguard rocket, this meant that the USA could launch a satellite quicker than in our own timeline and even succeed, as the PGM-11 Redstone turned out to be a better design than the Vanguard. Also in this year, Eisenhower's press secretary, James C. Hagerty, would announce that the USA would launch small circling Earth satellites from July 1957 to December 1958 as part of America's contribution to the International Geophysical Year (IGY), the Soviets would also soon announce in the same year that they would be participating in the IGY from 1957-1958.\n\n1956: Dwight D. Eisenhower, from the Republican Party, would easily win re-election in a landslide against Democratic party candidate Adlai Stevenson. Japan launches its first ever sounding rocket, Kappa-1, but it doesn't yet have space flight capabilities and China begins testing missiles, to be used later for space exploration. The American Jupiter-C would make its first maiden flight and it would be an uncrewed sub-orbital flight meant to test re-entry nosecones and the Soviets would continue launching R-1 and R-5 rockets into space.\n\n1957: The International Geophysical Year (IGY) from 1957-1958 has commenced, it being a worldwide program of geophysical research meant to study the Earth and its planetary environment, it sort of brought back scientific interchange between the West and the East that was halted because of the beginning of the Cold War in 1949 (because of the Berlin Airlift) and had 67 countries participating as part of its scientific projects, including the United States (USA) and the Soviet Union (USSR), the world's main superpowers.\n\nIn this year, the United States would successfully launch on the 2nd of October, 1957, the satellite Explorer 1, launching on a PGM-11 Redstone rocket from LC-26A at the Cape Canaveral Missile Center, it being the first artificial satellite ever successfully put into orbit, this would be a very important mission, as the Explorer 1 would discover the Van Allen radiation belt and other important scientific discoveries considered monumental as part of the IGY.\n\nOn the 4th of October 1957, 2 days after the infamous American launch of the Explorer 1, they would attempt with their R-7 Semyorka rocket to launch the Sputnik 1 satellite, but would fail after barely getting off the launch pad (1 meter) before exploding, due to a rapid unscheduled disassembly caused by an accidental ignition of the second stage engine, it being referred to as Kaputnik and Flopnik after being revealed in the American press, despite Soviet attempts at hiding it. The following mission, Sputnik 2, would also fail for the exact same reason on the 3rd of November 1957, which showed just how rushed the Soviets were and that they were just trying to, with inferior technology to beat the Americans.\n\n1958:\n\nThe Soviet Union would finally launch from a R-7 Semyorka rocket its first satellite on the 15th of May, 1958, it being known as Sputnik 3 and was the original proposal of Sergei Korolev, carrying a large array of instruments for international geophysical research. By this point, the United States had launched the Vanguard TV-3 satellite in December 1957, the Explorer 2 satellite in January 1958, the Vanguard 1 satellite in March 1958 and the Explorer 3 satellite also in March of 1958, showing just how far the Soviets were behind in terms of satellites. This would prompt Nikita Khrushchev to declare the creation of the Soviet Space Agency, also known as Roscosmos as a response to the slew of American satellite launches on June 7th 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower would also respond to it by creating the National Aeronautics and Space Agency soon after on July 23rd, 1958, but it wouldn't be as hyped/funded as NASA was in our timeline and plus it was established a couple months later. The Soviets knew they had to get an achievement that surpassed the launching of the first satellite and they came up with the first man in space and they sought to do it as fast as possible and as such, pumped up funding for Roscosmos, which was led by Sergei Korolev. Eisenhower and Khrushchev would also sign National Defense Education Acts in their own respective countries in order to create a large pool of scientists, engineers etc., with stuff like new math becoming a trend of the 1960s as students were forced to learn as if they were about to become rocket scientists or were meant to work at NASA or Roscosmos.\n\n1959:\n\nAmerica would continue with its launching of satellites under NASA at Cape Canaveral, specifically Vanguard and Explorer satellites. Wernher Von Braun and his engineering team would begin work on the Mercury Redstone rocket, in order to get the first man into space, although because of NASA's limited funding this may not happen soon. What's even better was that it turned out that in 1959, after a surveillance mission into the USSR with a Lockheed U-2, which managed to return unharmed revealed news that the USA had more SM-65 Atlas ICBMs than the Soviets had R-7 Semyorka ICBMs.\n\nBut, the Soviets would with their R-7 Semyorka rocket, launch Luna 1, which would be the first spacecraft to make a flyby of the Moon and enter heliocentric orbit (even though its goal was to impact the Moon), Luna 2 would be the first to hit the surface of the Moon and Luna 3 would be the first to return with pictures of the Moon and its far-side all of this would happen in 1959 and the United States would not even know. The United States knew that it had just been surpassed in the Space Race, while yes it launched more satellites and had better technology, somehow their arch-nemesis the Soviet Union had just one-upped them. That was unacceptable, according to President Eisenhower and would order massive funding to be pumped into NASA and would promise that within at least a year, the United States would be the first country to send a human into space (above 100 km).\n\nThe 1960s[]\n\n1960:\n\nJohn F. Kennedy from the Democratic party narrowly wins the election of 1960 against Richard Nixon, from the Republican Party, Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice-president.\n\nThe Americans would launch the first test flight of the Mercury Redstone and also of the modified Atlas rocket, these rockets are to be used for sub-orbital and orbital flight capabilities, their tests would go remarkably well. The Soviet test, as part of Sputnik 4, of the Vostok capsule would also go well, the Soviets also taking the American challenge to heart and attempting to send their own man into space. The race was on to send the first man into space. Also during this time, the Soviets would announce the Vostok program and the Americans would announce the Mercury program.\n\nAlso during this year, the Americans would recover the Discoverer 13 satellite from orbit, a recovery the first of its kind and 1960 and with the Discoverer 14, part of Project Corona, would take the first photographs with the intent of spying on the Soviet Union. The Soviets send the first dogs into space and also orbit, Belka and Strelka as part of Sputnik 5 and return them to Earth.\n\nAlso in this year, the Soviets finally manage to with a surface-to-air missile shoot down the American reconnaissance plane, the Lockheed U-2 and would take pilot Francis Gary Powers hostage until a deal was successfully made to liberate him. This plane was used to surveil Soviet space and military activities, which worsened relations between the two powers and further sparked the flame that became the space race.\n\nIn the later parts of the year around November 1960, the Americans would successfully launch Alan Shepard on a Mercury Redstone rocket, carrying him on a sub-orbital trajectory and to a maximum altitude of 120 km before his space capsule would re-enter and splash down near Cape Canaveral. To NASA and the Americans, this was the best they had as the Atlas, the crew-rated rocket capable of orbit was not ready yet.\n\n1961:\n\nJohn F. Kennedy is sworn in office on January 20, 1961.\n\nIn February of 1961, the Soviets successfully launch the first man into orbit on an R-7 Semyorka, that being Yuri Gagarin, this achievement would be a blow to the Americans who thought that they'd be the ones to have the first man orbiting the Earth. His Vostok capsule would successfully re-enter and land in Kazakhstan, near the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where the R-7 would be launched from. The Americans would soon repeat this achievement by launching John Glenn into orbit using a SM-65 Atlas rocket\n\nJohn F. Kennedy would give his 1961 State of the Union speech and would stress the goal of making sure America is the first country to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to the Earth by the end of the decade, after news of this Soviet space achievement, essentially moving the goal post once again. NASA would come up with ways to get to the Moon, those being direct ascent, earth-orbit rendezvous and lunar-orbit rendezvous and they proposed a series of rockets, the Saturn family, to do the job and as part of the Apollo program and would also establish the Gemini program, launching astronauts and the Gemini capsule on a Titan II rocket and an Agena Target Vehicle and the Apollo program, choosing the Saturn V rocket carrying the Command & Service Module and the Lunar Excursion Module and will utilize earth-orbit rendezvous and lunar-orbit rendezvous and not direct-ascent, which would've required the use of the Saturn VIII (a rocket with 8 F-1 engines on its first stage, instead of 5).\n\nThe Soviets in response publicly announce the creation of the Voskhod program, a program that is pretty similar to Gemini in that it will test longer-duration astronaut stays in space and at further distances from the Earth and also docking and rendezvous capabilities of Soviet spacecraft, they will launch the Voskhod on a modified R-7 rocket that is known as Soyuz. They would launch the last 5 missions of the Vostok program from 1961-1962, the second mission carrying Gherman Titov who would stay in space for 26 days before returning and then begin the first uncrewed test flight of the Voskhod, beating the Americans as they were stil flying astronauts as part of the Mercury Program as part of suborbital or orbital flights.\n\nIn 1960 we would see the first TV satellites to be put into orbit, these being the American Telstar satellites, through the Telstar, we would the first telephone calls, telegraph images and TV pictures relayed through the means of space for the first time in human history, its other companion, Telstar 2 would be launched 3 years later, but both are still in orbit today.\n\n1962:The Soviet Union continues the Vostok program all the way until Vostok 6, this last mission carrying the first woman into space and orbit , Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet cosmonaut.\n\nThe Voskhod program, which began with uncrewed test missions in 1961, would have its first 2 astronaut crewed mission of the Voskhod spacecraft, launched on a modified R-7 rocket known as Soyuz. Voskhod 1 would be an unmanned test flight in late 1961 and Voskhod 2 would carry dogs Veterok and Ugolyok on a 22-day flight in space, successfully returning them to the Earth. Voskhod 3 would in the same year launch cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov, Boris Yegorov and Konstantin Feoktistov.\n\nThe United States begin its first crewed flight of the Gemini program, successfully demonstrating the first rendezvous of two spacecraft, that being the Gemini 1 and Gemini 2 capsules, each with 2 astronauts.\n\nThe Soviets follow this up with Voskhod 4, where Alexei Leonov and Pavel Belyayev, the crew of the Voskhod spacecraft, complete the first spacewalk, 3 years earlier than in our own timeline, showing just how much the Space Race had intensified. At this point, NASA funding would receive 10.4B$/year and Roscosmos would receive 8.9B$/year, with their funding being neck and neck.\n\nThe Soviet Luna program (also known as Lunik in Western media) would once again do lunar flybys as part of Luna 4 and 5 and impactor missions as part of Luna 6 and 7 in the year 1962. The Soviets were hoping to eventually land an unmanned lander and return actual lunar rock samples back to home and also create a lunar rover as part of the extension to Lunik, known as Lunokhod.\n\nThe Soviets beat the Americans in May of 1962 on a planetary flyby of Venus as part of the Venera 1 mission, with the Americans only doing their flyby with the Mariner 1 mission in December of that year, both are uncrewed missions, obviously.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis still happens in 1962 and a Soviet nuclear submarine almost launch a nuclear-tipped torpedo at an enemy ship, but luckily and soon after John F. Kennedy agrees to withdraw their nuclear missiles from Turkey and Nikita Khrushchev agrees to withdraw their missiles from Cuba, ending this crisis, in this timeline however Nikita Khrushchev isn't toppled in favor of Brezhnev thanks to stronger support by politicians like Alexei Kosygin and also the fact that he has guided the Soviet Union through these space race victories and the creation of Roscosmos.\n\n1963:\n\nSoviet rocket engineers/scientists like Sergei Korolev and politicians like Alexei Kosygin urge Khrushchev to go ahead through market socialist economic reforms that are meant to prevent an era of stagnation by prioritizing small business privatization like in the old New Economic Policy (NEP) of Vladimir Lenin and to also prioritize consumer goods over heavy industry and to also begin the OGAS program. At the same time, America would begin its ARPANET program under the Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA). Both of these were academic and military research programs meant to use the power of computing for aerospace and military purposes, however it is said that Soviets may have been planning to use OGAS in the long-term for economic planning, although this is not confirmed.\n\nThe Americans replicate the Soviet achievement as part of Gemini 4 when astronaut Ed White would step out of his Gemini spacecraft and perform a spacewalk, or in official terms, extravehicular activity (EVA).\n\nDuring this year, there would be 2 other Voskhod missions, reaching up to Voskhod 6 and 3 other Gemini messions reaching up to Gemini 7, all of these missions saw extensive periods of and Gemini 6 would see the first docking of two spacecraft, that being the Agena Target Vehicle, launched from a SM-65 Atlas and a Gemini spacecraft, launched from a Titan II, while Voskhod 5, the last of the Voskhod missions in 1963 would see the autonomous docking of two Voskhod spacecraft.\n\nIn other shocking news, the Soviets manage to soft land the first object on the Moon in late 1963 as part of Lunik 9, this would only be a lander however it would take the first pictures of the surface of the Moon and it would last for a few da before its batteries would run out, but this was enough to force the Americans to put its space program into overdrive, as its funding would reach an at the time record of 25B$/year, or around 4% of the federal budget and there would also be the construction of new launch sites LC-39A and LC-39B and of the Saturn V rocket, something the Soviets weren't aware of as the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) hid it from view.\n\nIn this year, President John F. Kennedy would also get assassinated and that made his vision of landing on the Moon before the end of the decade even more appealing and needed as it would essentially serve as accomplishing what he so desired and that would be further be prioritized by the incoming administration of Lyndon B. Johnson, he having positioned as the space guy and a fundamental piece in creating NASA in the first place and as such he couldn't just ditch it and as such continued it.\n\nIn this year, the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) would be signed between the United States and the Soviet Union and also a whole slew of other countries, banning all nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, the oceans and in space, limiting them to just underground tests, this also put to a halt projects like Orion, which were about nuclear-pulse propulsion in space using a whole slew of nuclear fusion/fission bombs to propel a spacecraft forward to its destination, whether i'd be the Moon or Mars.\n\n1964:\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), thanks to a massive amount of funding, begins to do 3 Gemini missions per year, by the end of 1964, we would have reached Gemini 11 and due to the increased familiarity of NASA with the Gemini spacecraft, decides to use a larger Gemini spacecraft, which will be known as the Advanced Gemini spacecraft for an eventual crewed lunar mission and a lunar lander that is designed to carry just carry 1 astronaut, while another would stay inside the Gemini spacecraft, this is to land on the Moon well before the end of the decade, said NASA.\n\nRoscosmos is slower overall, only being able to do 2 Voskhod missions per year, getting to only Voskhod 8. The Soviets also take up President Kennedy's Moon challenge, but are overall late as they only now 3 years after the Americans b,egin work on their own super-heavy rocket, that being the N1 and their modified Soyuz spacecraft with an LK lunar lander. The Proton-K (also known as the UR-500), made by Vladimir Chelomey, a (in this timeline) friend of Sergei Korolev, is also being rolled out and has recently been used to launch Lunik missions 10 (the first spacecraft, unmanned, to orbit the Moon) and Lunik 11 which was another soft landing on the surface.\n\nThe Americans in July of 1964 and August of 1964 launch the first geosynchronous and the first geostationary satellites, these being known as Syncom 2 and 3. They also begin the first flights of a new reconnaissance aircraft, the SR-71 Blackbird, it being able to fly 10 km higher than the U-2 and also had a top speed of Mach 3.3, which was faster than interceptor aircraft and surface-to-air missiles at the time, meaning that American air reconnaissance over the Soviets could continue shortly.\n\nThe Advanced Gemini Program would begin, it being a test flight of the Saturn V,to low-earth orbit, with the Soviets being surprised at how quickly the Americans manage to build and launch the rockets plus all of these components. The Advanced Gemini spacecraft and the Lunar Excursion Module would be successfully demonstrated, with there being docking and rendezvous but also there being extravehicular activity in cases of emergency. The Gemini spacecraft capsule would also successfully re-enter. The Saturn V would also feature a nose cone with a Q-ball equipped with a solid rocket motor as an abort system in case things went wrong during launch, which was a far safer abort method than the one they had with ejection seats.\n\nBecause of this timeline, by 1964, computers would be more advanced thanks to efforts of ARPANET and OGAS starting way earlier, which would mean that for example rocket guidance systems would be much more sophisticated in both the United States and the Soviet Union, this will be important later on. The Soviets launch Venera 2 in April of 1964, but it fails, instead the Americans successfully send Mariner 2 in the same month to a flyby around Mars (the first of its kind) and later Mariner 3 in June of 1964 once again in a flyby around Venus, offering new information regarding those two planets.\n\nIn this year, the People's Republic of China successfully tests its first atomic bomb, becoming the 5th country to test a nuclear weapon, after the United States (1945)- Trinity Test, Soviet Union (1949) - RDS-1, United Kingdom (1952) - Hurricane, France (1960) - Blue Gerbil and now China tested its Project 596 nuke. The country with the most nukes in 1964 was the United States, with 30,000 of them, followed up by the USSR with 7,000 of them.\n\n1965:\n\nThe Americans would launch a record 4 Gemini missions this year, reaching Gemini 14, Gemini 12 and 13 docked to each other, while Gemini 11 and 14 saw dockings with the Agena Target Vehicle. Both missions were hundreds of km above Earth and in orbit and there was also extravehicular activity, and there would also be an expansion of Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center to increase the size of the Vehicle Assembly Building and also build LC-39C and LC-39D. The Soviets also replicate this by expanding Baikonur Cosmodrome to have more space for their upcoming N1 rocket and other future space endeavours. In this year, NASA reaches peak funding of around 6% of the federal budget due to the even more intense space race with the Soviets and the building of the two launch complexes, this means that Johnson's Great Society programs are not in the same scope and in this timeline Johnson seeks a quick end to the Vietnam War.\n\nThe SR-71 Blackbird would also begin reconnaissance operations in the Soviet Union, Vietnam and other pro-Soviet countries during this time and would be highly successful and as such more and more of these aircraft continue to be built, however the Lockheed U-2 is still kept and Project CORONA with the Discoverer satellites (spy satellite program) is still ongoing. Americans use these vital assets to improve their efforts in the Vietnam War and thus not divert that much military expenditure into fighting it.\n\n[This year would also see the second Apollo mission, which would be just like the first, testing out the systems of this advanced gemini spacecraft and also of this new lunar lander. While this is unknown to the Soviets, besides the Advanced Gemini and the Lunar Excursion Module, which are meant for short-duration lunar orbit and lunar surface operations alongside mid-duration low-earth orbits, are also building the Command & Service Module and the Extended Lunar Module, the former carrying 3 astronauts (instead of 2) and the latter carrying 2 astronauts (instead of 1) and will land on the lunar surface, these are to offer extended lunar missions and even low-earth orbit missions as part of proposals by engineers like Wernher Von Braun of the Apollo Applications Program (AAP).\n\n1966:\n\nThe final missions of the Gemini program would occur, these being Gemini 15 and Gemini 16 and it would involve a docking of the two Gemini spacecraft in low-earth orbit and would see a world record (so far) stay in space for the Gemini program of around 8 days and even of extravehicular activity of 7 hours and 20 minutes. Apollo 3 would see the first testing of the Command & Service Module in low-earth orbit and Apollo 4 would perform with the Advanced Gemini spacecraft the first crewed flyby around the Moon before safely returning to Earth, both of these missions were launched using the Saturn V and the Apollo 4 lunar flyby would create the famous Earthrise photo, taken by pilot Donn Eisele and by commander Gus Grissom.\n\nIt was clear to the Soviet Union that the Americans have seized the lead when it came to the space race, as the images of the Earthrise would make its way to the Soviet Union as well. While missions Luna 13 and Luna 14 successfully landed on the Moon and were able to transmit pictures, they knew that their Lunik missions they called \"Luna\" were not going to get them the lead in the space race, said Roscosmos. They may have to jump quite a few corners to get their N1, which was set to be complete by early next year, with astronauts, to landing on the surface Moon before the Americans would.\n\nA Boeing B-52 Stratofortress collides with a KC-135 Stratotanker and three hydrogen bombs with yields each of 70 kilotons fall, two near the Spanish town of Palmeares and one in the sea, this yet again ignites fears of nuclear annihilation at least for a short while, this being 4 years after the infamous Cuban Missile Crisis, in which the Americans, led by John F. Kennedy and the Soviets led by Nikita Khrushchev manage to settle things through and nuclear war was averted by one heroic Soviet known as Vasily Arkhipov.\n\nA Soviet Proton-K rocket would manage to launch a modified Soyuz spacecraft, known as Zond and have it make an orbit around the Moon and successfully return carrying animals aboard, it carrying two tortoises, fruit eggs and plants and this was the best response the Soviets could muster in that year, although it wouldn't be as publicized.\n\nThe Americans by now would've finished their massive expansion of Cape Canaveral and the KSC, adding LC-39C and LC-39D and also expanding the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), it now being able to hold around 8 Saturn V rockets (x2 more than in real life, it being made with the option of being expanded like this). The Soviets also roll up a mock up of their N1 rocket onto the launch pad, which the Americans do initially interpret it as the Soviets having finished their rocket, although they were close to doing so. Their Baikonur Cosmodrome has also finished its expansion, meaning its VAB can carry 6 N1 rockets and there an additional 2 launch pads at the cosmodrome.\n\nAnother point of divergence (POD) that would happen in this year specifically is that Sergei Korolev, thanks to the better state of the Soviet economy and of the space program, would manage to survive his gastrointenstinal surgery and it is just a mundane surgery that is just not reported at all, but for the sake of this timeline we're going to mention it.\n\n1967:\n\nIn this year, the Americans would launch Apollo 5 with astronauts Pete Conrad (commander) and James Lovell (pilot) performing a dress rehearsal landing on the Moon using the Advanced Gemini spacecraft and the Lunar Excursion module (Conrad would enter the excursion module, while Gordon would stay in the Gemini), getting within 15 km of the lunar surface with the lander before ascending back to the Gemini spacecraft. Apollo 6, with astronauts Thomas Stafford (commander) and Neil Armstrong (pilot) would also perform a testing of docking and rendezvous of the Command and Service Module and the Extended Lunar Module (this being in low-earth orbit) for future Apollo missions and finally Apollo 7 at the end of the year would see the first man to walk on the surface of the Moon, that being astronaut Michael Collins, who was the commander, while pilot David Scott would stay in lunar orbit . The mission ould only for 2-3 days before returning to Earth and Collins only had 1-2 hours of EVA on the lunar surface, showing just how short-term the whole Gemini-LEM system was when it came to lunar exploration, which was why the CSM and the ELM were being built and tested for the future. Apollo 5 happened in March of 1967, Apollo 6 in August of 1967 and Apollo 7 would happen in November of 1967 and would all be launched on Saturn V launches, which showed just how far NASA had gone. Michael Collins, after stepping out of the LEM, would utter the words: \"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nIn the Soviet Union, in October of 1967, the Soviets attempted to test their own shortcut, after finishing the N1 rocket, which utilized OGAS-made guidance systems, but the fact that it had 30 NK-15 engines and a very complicated system of kerolox propellant meant that this first test, with crew inside would fail and a 6 kiloton explosion would destroy the launch pad and the crew while they managed to abort to safety using the launch escape system, had their capsule severely damaged and sustained some hefty injuries themselves, these being cosmonauts Alexei Leonov (commander, would have landed on the Moon) and Andriyan Nikolayev (pilot, who would stay in lunar orbit) and had to be quickly sent to the hospital after landing around 10-15 km away from Baikonur with their capsule and the Soviets just missed their opportunity, the modified Soyuz would carry the two astronauts and the lander was not directly docked to the Soyuz, meaning that Leonov would have to make a spacewalk to get in the LK and back to the Soyuz, unlike in the Advanced Gemini-LEM of the Americans, where there was a small tunnel between the two craft. Despite the Soviet attempt to keep this under wraps, it did eventually hit the newspapers after some time.\n\nThe Soviets on the same day as the first ever landing of a human on the Moon, that being the 20th of November, 1967 would successfully land, by using a Proton-K rocket, the Luna 15 lander, which would specifically carry the Lunokhod 1 rov er, around 200 km away from the Tranquility Sea landing site of Michael Collins and of the Americans, this would represent the first rover to ever land on the surface of the Moon.\n\nAfter convincing done by NASA administrator Thomas Paine and chief rocket engineer Wernher Von Braun, through the Apollo Applications Program (AAP), LBJ would decide to continue further Apollo lunar missions, not just the additional Gemini-based ones until Apollo 12 set in 1969, but also a series of additional missions until Apollo 20, despite the fact that NASA funding was reduced from its 1966 peak of around 5% of the federal budget down to just 3%.\n\nNikita Khrushchev would also be removed from the leadership after being far behind in the arms race with the United States of America, having an economy that was below that of the USA (which had 1T$ of GDP), while they only had 600B$ in GDP, losing the space race to the Moon and having the failure of the N1 rocket, among many other reasons. In his place would surprisingly come Evsei Liberman as who had a history as a Kharkiv economist but would enter the Soviet political sphere after his reforms would be put into place under Nikita Khrushchev, being chosen because he was the architect of the Soviet economic reforms in the 1960s, with Alexei Kosygin becoming Premier and Nikolai Podgorny becoming Presidium Chairman, creating a new troika (triumvirate). He was the first and only Soviet leader to ever be officially toppled through a vote of no confidence in the Supreme Soviet, this happened on December 18th, 1967 and he would die less than 4 years later.\n\nIsrael, like in our own timeline manages to very easily win the Six-Day War which lasted from 5-10 June of 1967, defeating the Arab powers of Egypt, Jordan and Syria and annexing the Golan Heights, Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with Israel now becoming larger than it has ever been, it also beginning to encourage settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for the first time ever, with this problem not being solved for quite some time.\n\nGreece suffers a military coup on April 21st 1967, and a dictatorship is established led by Georgios Papadopoulos, but it only lasts for 7 years.\n\n1968:\n\nLandings on the Moon would continue with missions Apollo 8 and 9 in the year 1968, Apollo 8 happening on February 9th, 1968 and Apollo 9 happening on May 16th, 1968, with Apollo 8 having astronauts Frank Borman (commander) landing on the Moon and Tom Stafford (pilot) remaining in lunar orbit and Apollo 9 having astronauts Ed White, him also being the first American astronaut to conduct a spacewalk, being the mission commander, landing on the surface of the Moon and Bill Anders (pilot) remaining in orbit around the Moon. Apollo 10 would also happen in this year on November 27th, 1968, it sending out astronauts John Young (commander), Eugene Cernan (CSM pilot) and David Scott (ELM pilot), (despite the fact that the ELM wasn't for this mission, it still was labelled as such to give all 3 people inside of the CSM) to a circumlunar trajectory, with the CSM, which was an extended version of the AGS and successfully returning to Earth.\n\nIn this timeline, Lyndon B. Johnson chooses to run as President for another term as the Vietnam War is going not as horribly as in our own timeline thanks to better use of welfare, space and military funds, also utilizing international troops, not just American ones to fight in the Vietnam War. He is also much more popular because he is the space guy, he helped create NASA and under his administration did we see Michael Collins land on the Moon in 1967 and he also talked to the astronaut through a phone call while he was on the surface of the Moon and got to go himself to see the launch of the Apollo 7 rocket and also the recovery of the Gemini capsule in the Pacific Ocean. He manages to narrowly defeat Richard Nixon in the electoral college vote and is elected for a second term, where he would serve until 1972 (this also means that he doesn't pick up smoking again, only dying 8 years later in 1981)\n\nAlexander Dubcek is allowed to remain in power in Czechoslovakia, pursuing his economic reforms, although they take a step back in the sense that democracy is not granted in Czechoslovakia with the fear that it may spill over into other member states and threaten the Soviet bloc, instead, the Prague Spring is just a sort of more amplified version of Hungary's Goulash Communism. This also prevents Soviet Army deserter Vitktor Ilykin from attempting to kill Soviet leader who in this timeline is Evsei Liberman.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey, a movie about human evolution, space exploration, computing & artificial intelligence and alien life and is also considered a symbol of humanity beginning to look to the planets and the stars, is released by Director Stanley Kubrick. While initially in our own timeline it had mixed reviews and it was not recognized for its greatness, in this timeline it would be as it would be an even greater source of optimistic, but also pessimistic take on the future of mankind as it enters the space age, it winning 4 Oscars and it would even become part of the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress.\n\n1969:\n\nBy this point, in the year 1969, the American ARPANET would be at the same level of computational power and advancement as it was in the early 1980s thanks to the earlier creation of the program, the Soviet OGAS would also have the capability of a mid-1970s computer, being slightly behind the ARPANET of the United States. The ARPANET would be headed by the Defense Advanced Research Project (DARPA).\n\nApollo 11 would successfully land astronauts Neil Armstrong (commander) and Buzz Aldrin (ELM pilot) on the surface of the Moon, specifically at the landing site known as the Descartes Highlands on May 20th, 1969, with astronaut Fred Haise serving as the CSM pilot, stayin in lunar orbit, this being the first of the lunar extended mission series, utilizing the new Apollo hardware of the Command & Service Module (CSM) and the Extended Lunar Module (ELM), besides just offering additional crew space, it also introduced the lunar rover and expanded the scope of scientific equipment that could be brought over to the Moon and it also allowed for more extravehicular activity (EVA), with Apollo 11 having a record 18 hours of EVAs (up from the previous Apollo 9, which only had 9 hours of EVA) and the mission taking 10 days instead of 5 days.\n\nOn August 11th, 1969, the Soviet Union would have a successful testing of its N1 rocket, after spending quite some time repairing the damaged Baikonur Cosmodrome, with the Soviets finally managing to land a cosmonaut of their own, that being Pavel Belyayev as part of the Soyuz 1 mission (him being the Soyuz 1a backup) and his first words on the Moon are: \"I take this step for my country, my people and for the Marxist-Leninist way olife knowing that today is but a small step, in a journey that will one day, take us to the stars.\" A Soyuz rocket would have also launched the Lunokhod 2, as part of Lunik 16, at the same landing site as the Soyuz 1 mission, landing at Clavius crater.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson, who in our own timeline had begun secret negotiations (which in OTL were delayed and interfered by Nixon for his own political gain, most likely in violation of Logan Act) in order to begin the American withdrawal of troops. In order to prevent history from judging him as a chicken who withdrew from Vietnam right when America was about to have a winning edge, he would intensify the war's operations from 1967-1968 in order to make this pacifist act seems less unmanly and just the last resort that had to be taken anyway. By 1970, the United States would withdraw from Vietnam, 3 years earlier than in our own timeline and instead a demilitarized zone (set at the 17th parallel) was established between North and South Vietnam, essentially resulting in nothing, no one won, no one lost, it was simply a second Korea and that was the best outcome anyway.\n\nThe Americans would also finally land their own rover, that being Surveyor, part of the Surveyor 1, it being launched on a Titan III-C, which was launched from Cape Canaveral at LC-40 and on the same day on November 7th, 1969, astronauts Alan Shepard (commander) and Pete Conrad (pilot) would land using the Extended Lunar Module on the surface of the Moon and would besides using their own lunar rover also do scientific studies with the Surveyor rover and also set up other scientific equipment on the Moon, landing at Ocean of Storms.\n\nThe Soviets successfully land Venera 5 on the surface of the Venus in May of 1969, becoming the first craft sent from Earth to successfully land on another planet in the Solar System and the American Mariner 7 makes its closest flyby of the planet Mars. In other events, the government of Canada confirms bilingualism, making French equal to English in the national government, Lyndon B. Johnson also visits the first communist state ever since the start of the Cold War as Liberman also seeks to create a thaw in or a detente in relations between the two countries and serious border clashes occur between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union as the relations between the PRC and the USSR continue to get worse ever since the Sino-Soviet Split as the Soviet and Chinese visions differ through the fact that Liberman is an authoritarian market socialist while Mao is a totalitarian state socialist, who believes that Liberman is further example that the USSR has become revisionist. Albania, under Enver Hoxha despite the fact that the USSR didn't intervene in the Prague Spring, still decides to leave the Warsaw Pact like in our own timeline and pursue relations with Maoist China.\n\nIn this year, the Woodstock Festival would be held in White Lake, New York, featuring the top rock musicians of the 1960s, attracting more than 400,000 attendees and it would become a symbol of the counterculture movement of the decade and it would have people like Jimi Hendrix and around 34 other rock artists perform at this festival/concert.\n\nThe 1970s[]\n\n1970:\n\nThe United States and the Soviet Union sign and ratify the SALT treaty, which saw Evsei Liberman and Lyndon B. Johnson agree to limit the number of anti-ballistic missile systems in order to reduce pressures when it comes to the arms race and building up nuclear detterence, this also came through a reduction in the number of nuclear warheads: The Soviets reduced theirs from 10,000 to 6,000 while the Americans reduced theirs from 27,000 down to 9,000, putting a limit of 10,000 warheads and also set in place transparency rules when it came to nuclear weapon activities and it would also limit the number of SLBMs and ICBMs the USA and the USSR possessed.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson would sign into law a bill that would create the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and set regulations to the emission of sulfur dioxide, which was a known causer of acid rain, through the Clean Air Act and would urge other countries to implement such regulations on the emission of this harmful substance. He would also sign a bill that would create a national passenger-rail company known as Amtrak, that would have control of all passenger rail services in the United States, meanwhile a national freight-rail company, known as Conrail, expanding it from the Northeast would be made, this is in order to greatly improve railway travel in the United States, according to LBJ.\n\nThe Apollo program, with the Command & Service Module and Extended Lunar Module would continue with Apollo 13 happening on January 31st, 1970 with Stuart Roosa as the commander, James Irwin as the ELM pilot and Alan Bean as the CSM pilot (him staying in lunar orbit) and would land at Fra Mauro crater. Stuart Roosa would also place seisometers on the surface of the Moon and would manage to detect the S-IVB upper stage (with 1 J-2 engine) crashing into the Moon. The Apollo 14 mission would happen on June 7th, 1970 and would have commander Eugene Cernan and ELM pilot Edgar Mitchell land on the Moon and Ronald Evans, the CSM pilot would stay in lunar orbit. This mission would see a landing at Tycho crater. Apollo 13 and 14 would have 30 hours and 34 hours of EVAs, keep in mind the configuration of the CSM and ELM allowed for a maximum of 100 hours of EVAs while the previous configuration of the AGS and LEM only allowed for 20 hours of EVAs. In both of these the Surveyor rover would also be present and be used for scientific purposes.\n\nThe Soviet Union would land cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman on the surface of the Moon (who also was the first woman in space) on an LK lunar lander on September 24th, 1970 at the same time as the Lunokhod 3 mission, which would be used to expand the mission's scientific scope. The N1 rocket would launch like usual a Soyuz LOK spacecraft and a LK lunar lander, with the Soyuz pilot being this time Gherman Titov, him staying in lunar orbit, which shows that the USSR had the money for a moon landing, even if these weren't extended missions and were more like the advanced Gemini-style Apollo missions.\n\nAlso in this year, Lyndon B. Johnson of the United States and Evsei Liberman of the Soviet Union alongside 54 other countries agree to sign and ratify the Nuclear Non-Profileration Treaty which has the goal of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon technology in the world. Further news when it came to improved West-East relations, the country of West Germany, led by Willy Brandt, signs the Ostpolitik with East Germany and the Soviet Union and saw a normalization in relations between the two countries. Despite these news, the Soviets and the Americans deep down still have tough relations as the Soviets want to one up the Americans once more in the space race and while there are some breakthroughs made in stopping nuclear proliferation, when it comes to the conventional arms race, things are still not looking good.\n\nSergei Korolev, chief rocket engineer of the Soviet Union (his real name is hidden as just almost dies from another surgery in 1970, but luckily survives once more, but it is clear that his 6 year period of hard labor and harsh conditions in Stalinist gulags and also the tense and long work he has to make to keep Roscosmos afloat and at an even level with NASA and this is while he was only 63 years old.\n\nThis year would also see the first Chinese satellite be launched into low-earth orbit (Dong Fang Hong 1) and also the first Japanese satellite (Ohsumi) be launched into low-earth orbit, showing that other countries are beginning to pick up on the things done by the United States and the Soviets in around the last 20 years.\n\nThe Americans also manage to launch Apollo 15 in this year in around November of 1970, with NASA and Wernher Von Braun commiting to launching 3 Apollo missions to the surface of the Moon per year, and these being Type J missions (utilizing the ELM and CSM) and not Type H missions (utilizing the LEM and AGS), as per NASA's classification. Apollo 15, with Alfred Worden serving as the commander, Vance Brand serving as the ELM pilot and Deke Slayton serving as the CSM pilot and it would land at Hadley-Appenine.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Roscosmos approves a proposal by rocket engineer, Vladimir Chelomey, who is a hesistant friend of Sergei Korolev in this timeline, to build the Energia rocket, which can carry payloads up to 100 tons in low-earth orbit. It was powered by 4 strap-on boosters each with 4 chambers each with a total of 16 RD-170 kerolox engine nozzles and its core stage was powered by 4 RD-0120 hydrolox engines. It was believed, according to Chelomey that this could much more easily get Soviets to the surface of the Moon alongside other payloads to the Moon as it could carry more stuff than the N1, despite the fact that it had 3 million less lbs of thrust than the N1 and it was proposed by Chelomey to carry with it a reusable space plane that could be used for a variety of things.\n\nNASA would also begin to ponder about what it should do after the Apollo missions, as such administrator Thomas Paine and chief rocket engineer Wernher Von Braun, among others, would propose the Apollo Applications Program (AAP) and while the main reasoning behind it was promoted to the public as expanding upon the work of the Apollo program and to bring in scientific and economic progress, in reality, the reasoning for it was to keep the 500,000 employees at NASA that poured their heart and soul into this and believe that completely switching their hardware would mean a lot of them would lose their jobs. The proposals outlined in this AAP would include a space station in low-earth orbit, a lunar base, a reusable space shuttle and a nuclear-powered space tug and a next-generation CSM/ELM meant for interplanetary expeditions, among other things, using Apollo-era hardware and improving upon it.\n\nAs of 1970, there have been 8 Apollo missions that have landed on the surface of the Moon and these are their landing sites and also the hours of EVA in each mission (Type G represents the first crewed lunar landing, Type H represents systematic lunar exploration missions and Type J represents extensive scientific investigation on the Moon and in lunar orbit):\n\nApollo 7 (Type G): Sea of Tranquility, 1 hour and 34 minutes of EVA\n\nApollo 8 (Type H): Sea of Procellarum, 4 hours and 11 minutes of EVA\n\nApollo 9 (Type H): Mons Bradley, 9 hours and 6 minutes of EVA\n\nApollo 11 (Type J): Descartes Highlands, 18 hours and 14 minutes of EVA\n\nApollo 12 (Type J): Ocean of Storms, 24 hours and 4 minutes of EVA\n\nApollo 13 (Type J): Fra Mauro, 30 hours and 47 minutes of EVA\n\nApollo 14 (Type J): Tycho, 34 hours and 32 minutes of EVA\n\nApollo 15 (Type J): Hadley-Appenine, 36 hours and 21 minutes of EVA\n\n1971:\n\nApollo 16, 17 and 18 missions successfully land on the surface of the Moon on March 7th, 1971, July 9th, 1971 and December 1st, 1971. Apollo 16 would have as its commander Thomas Mattingly, as its ELM Pilot Joe Engle and its CSM pilot it would have Owen Garriot. 2 of them would land on the Moon and 1 of them (the CSM pilot) would stay in lunar orbit (just like any other Apollo mission) and it would land at Mare Nectaris. Apollo 17 would have as its commander Harrison Schmitt, as its ESM pilot Gerald Carr and as its CSM pilot and it would land at Taurus-Littrow, a lunar valley and finally Apollo 18 would have as its commander James Irwin, as its ELM pilot Jack Lousma and as its CSM pilot it would have Don Lind and it would land at Censorinus, a lunar crater.\n\nThe Soviet Union attempts to launch another N1 rocket only to wound up failing during first stage separation at 65 km in altitude, forcing the activation of the Launch Escape System. The crew of the mission would die, these being commander George Dobrovolsky and pilot Viktor Patsayev, as due to the shockwave and explosion, their capsule and LES would be damaged, resulting in the parachute not deploying and them hitting the ground hard at around 150 m/s and it landed closer to Baikonur Cosmodrome instead of around 40 km away, causing the death of both of them, this being considered a repeat of Komarov's death in 1967 also due to a Soyuz capsule hard landing as part of Soyuz E-1, the actual first Soyuz mission and was meant to be a low-earth orbit of the Soyuz spacecraft for a Lunar mission.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson officially decides to stop converting dollars to a fixed value of gold, as such permanently ditching the Gold Standard and breaking the Bretton Woods, concluding his goals from a previous bill he signed in 1968 which eliminated the gold cover for Federal Reserve notes. This gives the government greater room for fiscal spending during times of crisis and overall just leads to the better execution of Keynesian economics and economic recovery, say defenders of this measure.\n\nThe American Mariner 9 mission would make the first successful orbit of the planet Mars in May of 1971, becoming the first spacecraft to ever do so. The Americans also begin construction of a slightly larger Saturn V that can carry the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), which is almost x2 bigger than the ELM and can allow for 200 hours instead of 100 hours of EVA, can carry 3 astronauts instead of 2 and it also includes the Block III Command and Service Module which can carry 4 astronauts to the Moon and begin eying towards launching the Skylab space station by as early as 1972 or as late as 1974, seeing the Soviet failure to launch Salyut. The Skylab B station isn't even proposed as the Apollo-Soyuz cooperation does not exist by now and neither is the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project proposed.\n\nWernher Von Braun and NASA officially go ahead with the construction of the proposed Space Transportation System (STS), also known as the Space Shuttle, which would contain the first stage of a Saturn IC with its 5 F-1 engines powered by kerolox, which has the capability of landing itself at a landing pad, set at Cape Canaveral, a second stage (external) powered by hydrolox and is also the fuel source for the Space Shuttle and its 3 RS-25 engines (it also having 2 OMS hypergolic engines with its own internal fuel system), the external tank is reused using parachutes and two helicopters that will catch it and the space shuttle will land like a glider, creating a fully reusable rocket. They hoped for a rocket that could better perform crewed missions in low-earth orbit, lunar orbit and on the surface of the Moon, with the reusable spaceplane offering just that opportunity in routinizing spaceflight and reducing the cost of launching a kg of payload into space, says the scientists and engineers. For a lunar mission it will require the launching of a Saturn V alongside it to low-earth orbit in order to refuel it, due to its reusable nature, to act sort of like a space fuel tanker.\n\nThe day of March 21st is officially declared by the United Nations as Earth Day, like in our own timeline. A terrorist incident done by a far-left organization, known as the Weather Underground is done in the men's room at the Capitol building of the United States. The movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, directed by Mel Stuart. Despite it not having a good showing, possibly because of Roald Dahl's heavy criticism of the movie's de-alignment from his book (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), it would eventually become part of the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\n\n1972:For the 1972 presidential election in the United States, the Democratic Party's presidential nominee would be current VP Hubert H. Humphrey and the vice-presidential nominee would be Maine Senator Edmund Muskie, while the Republican Party's presidential nominee would be former-VP candidate and U.N. ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and the vice-president would be the governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller. The election would be narrowly won by Cabot Lodge in an upset, with 306 vs 232 electoral votes, despite the fact that the economy was doing good, the administration was decently popular and the Vietnam War was over, which led to this surprise post-election. The main issues in this election were the space race, the equal rights amendment, abortion, civil rights and America's foreign policy going forward, among others. Also, Hubert H. Humphrey was considered a social liberal, a continuation of the LBJ administration while Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. was considered a Rockefeller republican, which had conservative economics and liberal social views.\n\nIn this year, the United States would launch an additional 3 Apollo missions, Apollo 19, 20 and 21. Apollo 19 would have as its commander Robert Grippen, as its ELM pilot Ronald Evans and as its CSM pilot would be William Pogue. It would have its landing site at Hyginus (a lunar caldera). Apollo 20 would have as its commander Frank Borman, as its ELM pilot it would have Gus Grissom , as its CSM pilot it would have Charles Bassett and it would land at Marius Hills meanwhile Apollo 21 would have as its commander Elliot See (jr.), as its ELM pilot it would have Clifton Williams and as its CSM pilot Gordon Cooper and it would land at Mare Frigoris. During this mission, the Command and Service Module's scientific equipment would manage to pick up the presence of water ice at the north and south poles of the Moon, when it was in a polar orbit to facilitate the landing it did, showing just how far Type J missions have gone.\n\n1973:\n\nHenry Cabot Lodge Jr. is officially inaugurated as the next President of the United States, him being part of the Republican Party (also known as the Grand Old Party - GOP) and the Rockefeller Republican faction, which is a fiscally conservative and socially liberal political group. He is known for being pro-space exploration, a political moderate and is also neutral on things like the equal rights amendment, but is in favor of progressive measures like abortions or even gay rights (privately), the War on Drugs also does not happen in this timeline.\n\nNASA officially begins construction of the Space Transportation System (STS). It also rejects the creation of a bigger Saturn V (known as the Saturn VI, due to its 6 F-1 engines on its first stage) and instead opts to put the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) inside the Space Shuttle (the spaceplane) in its payload bay that can carry 30 tons. The Shuttle is also slightly bigger than proposed in order to accomodate a single STS mission, no longer requiring the Saturn V refueling tanker. The Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) will be used to offer even greater scientific, extra-vehicular and geological capabilities for human crewed missions to the Moon and will also offer a wider range of landing, set to use a near-rectillinear halo orbit that allows crew to land anywhere on the Moon and to also keep communications with Mission Control 24/7 and may also pave way for a permanent lunar presence.\n\nThe World Trade Center is officially opened, it utilizing an innovative design known as the open floor plan, a concept made having a perimeter made out of tubular steel trusses with each column being 3 floors tall and the steel beams would reduce in thickness and a core made out of an innovative micro-reinforced ultra-high-perfomance concrete, which could withstand 14500 PSI of pressure and it also includes a micro-steel mesh and it is extremely resistant to chemicals, water and temperature (this is for this alternate timeline) - only beginning to weaken at 1275 degrees celsius. The core and the perimeter would be connected by steel trusses and steel seats and both buildings would also have a hat truss, which not only added further connections but created the foundation for an antenna. The buildings would also feature 20000 visco-elastic dampeners that are meant to absorb the \"punch\" of very strong winds - like those of a category 5 hurricane (+average winds) and a slurry wall (bathtub foundation), a concrete foundation going down 7 floors (including the Underground Mall, the PATH station and a car parking lot) and tieback cables. The fireproofing for the buildings (specifically the steel) would also be more than enough (75mm thick made instead of mineral wool) and the stairwells would be 160 cm wide instead of 110 cm and would feature trackling lights and photoreflectant tiles to ensure better evacuations. There would also be early suppression fast response (ESFR) sprinklers. This made the buildings however x4 more expensive, costing 1.8B$ instead of 400M$, adjusting for inflation this would cost 17.1B$ in 2023, 50 years after they were built. The towers would have a height of 417 meters (North Tower) and 415 meters (South Tower) respectively, but the North Tower's spire addition in 1979 would increase it to 530 meters.\n\nNASA officially launches into orbit the Skylab space station on a modified Saturn V (known as the Saturn INT-21) which replaces the fourth stage with the payload fairing for Skylab, this mission is successful, with the station also sending its first crew, these being astronauts Bruce McCandless, Brewster Shaw and Gus Grissom and will test a slew of scientific experiments like micro-gravity, astrophysics, living in space etc. A few days later, the Soviets would launch the Salyut 2 space station, which would just re-enter the atmosphere 2 weeks after.\n\nOn the day of Yom Kippur, an important Israeli religious day on the 6th of October 1973, several Arab countries, Egypt and Syria with expeditionary forces from countries ranging from Saudi Arabia and Jordan to even North Korea and Cuba. American support of Israel would result in the OPEC countries, most of them Arab ones, declaring an embargo on oil, resulting in a dramatic increase in oil prices from 1$ to 10$/barrel, also resulting in increased gas prices. Despite Israel's victory which saw them get Gaza, Sinai Peninsula, West Bank and the Golan Heights, this would still cause an economic crisis that ended the streak of high economic growth under the LBJ administration and into the first year of the HCL administration. Henry Cabot Lodge would begin implementing fuel efficiency standards, electrification of railway services (Amtrak and Conrail) and would begin using the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) heavily scaling up nuclear energy production to begin diversification and would even be known for founding the strategic petroleum reserve, meant to keep enough oil in case of other such crises in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Soviet Union, construction of their own Energia rocket is also beginning to unfold for the same reasons as the Space Transportation System in America. The USSR, after the failed Salyut 2 space station, would launch Salyut 3 on November 17th, 1973 and send as part of Zvezda 14 (the alternate name for Soyuz, as this name is used for lunar missions) cosmonauts Boris Volynov and Vitaly Zholobov would go to the station and it, the station would re-enter around 6 months later. Cosmonauts Pavel Popovich and Yuri Artyukhin would land on the Moon as part of the Soyuz 3 mission, launching from an N1 rocket carrying the LK lunar lander and the Soyuz 7K-LOK command ship, with Pavel Popovich landing on the Moon while Yuri Artyukhin would stay in lunar orbit.\n\nApollo 22, in March of 1973, would see testing of the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) in low-earth orbit, a type D-prime mission, it being launched on a Saturn V rocket. It would carry the current Block II Command & Service Module (CSM) and also the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), testing docking, rendezvous and even extravehicular ability + other things in order to become familiar with the LSAM. It would have as commander Karol Bobko, LSAM pilot Franklin Musgrave and CSM pilot Robert Overmyer. Apollo 23, in August of 1973, would be the first mission to use a near-rectillinear halo orbit to land on the Moon and it would land at Peary, having as commander Edgar Mitchell, as ELM pilot Jim McDivitt and as its CSM pilot Roger Chaffee, it sadly did not manage to return water ice back to Earth. This mission would have the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) as a secondary payload and it would be put in a polar orbit, meant to detect water on the surface of the Moon. The Soviets had already landed the first woman on the Moon, Valentina Tereshova in 1970, but now as part of Apollo 24, which happened in December of 1973, the Americans would send commander Walter Cunnigham, ELM pilot Marie Tharp (who was an infamous ocean geologist, would be trained for this mission) and CSM pilot Phillip Chapman. Tharp would be the first American woman to space and on the surface of the Moon and it (Apollo 24) would also be known for successfully returning samples of water ice after landing at Clavius (a lunar crater), at the lunar south pole.\n\nInflation in the United States would rise to a record 10%, while the economy would begin to slow down significantly. John Connally, the chairman of the Federal Reserve in this timeline would begin raising interest rates in order to tackle inflation and the administration of Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. would reject measures like price controls and instead would implement fiscally conservative measures and cancels the expensive Great Society, instead implementing the earned income tax credit (EITC), implementing welfare reform around . Alongside all of these he would go ahead with powering the White House with solar panels and begin a program to scale up solar power across the USA (alongside nuclear) and other renewable/clean energy sources and beginning a national energy efficiency campaign all in order to mitigate the worst of this crisis.\n\nThe United States would successfully send the Pioneer 10 probe, as part of a mission to explore the outer solar system and the heliosphere at around 110 AU away from the Sun, it was launched by an Atlas-Centaur rocket in the previous year and in this year it would finally reach the planet Jupiter, taking stunning pictures of it. It would also carry a \"message\" to extraterrestrials that may find this, including things like the hydrogen atom, a human male and female. Pioneer 11 would also be launched to explore the outer solar system and specifically the planet Saturn, it also being launched on a and carrying the same message as the Pioneer 10 probe. Today, both of these probes are beyond the heliopause and in interstellar space.\n\nIn other events, the United States government would still topple the Chilean democratically-elected socialist/marxist Salvador Allende in favor of Chilean military general Augusto Pinochet on September 11th, 1973, just like in our own timeline, showing that relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, while good in some areas, is still terrible. After a referendum in 1973 meant to determine the status of Northern Ireland (98% voted remain with the UK), the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) would still do a series of car bombings which would result in 200 casualties (injuries + fatalities). The Sears Tower is also built in this year, 1 month after the World Trade Center (more specifically the North and South Towers, also known as the Twin Towers or WTC 1 and 2) and becomes the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and the world standing at 442 meters, it being in the city of Chicago. Finally, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. would meet with Mao Zedong of China and Zhou Enlai, beginning a detente with the country of China and beginning an opening up of its economy and labor force.\n\n1974:\n\nThe FIFA World Cup of 1974 happens in West Germany, it also being the winner of the mentioned football world cup and this is also the first world cup to feature the infamous World Cup Trophy that will be in use ever since this year, making this more important than other such world cups.\n\nAlso in 1974, the United States would begin the first testing of the Space Shuttle, that being Space Shuttle Enterprise as part of the Space Transportation System, launching it from a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft. There is a plan to use 10 Space Shuttles: Atlantis, Columbia, Enterprise, Kon-Tiki, Victoria, Discovery, Celestia, Endeavour, Beagle and Pioneer. While NASA was seemingly being cut, it only getting 1.5% of federal funding (so around 4.4B$/year) as of the 1974 budget as part of the fiscally conservative Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. administration's policies. The fully reusable first stage, external tank and shuttle of the STS were also backed by the Department of Defense, especially the United States Air Force, which allowed it to continue to go through. The frequency of Apollo missions also dies down, with this year only seeing 1 Apollo mission, Apollo 25, with commander William Lenoir, ELM pilot Anna Fisher and CSM Pilot Russel Schweickart (with the CSM pilot staying in orbit) and they would land at Avogadro crater in the lunar north pole. The frequency of the Apollo missions has been reduced to 1 per year at most as per NASA funding. The USAF successfully convinces NASA to build a variation of the Space Shuttle meant specifically for Earth orbit classified intelligence & reconnaissance satellite missions, known as Space Shuttle Vanguard or just USAF/military Shuttle, that would be launched only from Vanderberg (California) or Cape Canaveral (Florida) Air Force Bases and as such has truly cemented USAF funding for the STS program. The differences between the military shuttle and other shuttles is that it is meant only for Earth orbit, that it has two reusable SRBs instead of the S-IC first stage and that it has a foam-made external tank that was expendable, instead of the aluminium-made external tank used on the NASA shuttle, the spaceplane would still be reusable in both shuttle versions though. The 1970s would see a sort of dying down of the space race at least temporarily due to the not-so-good economic situation of the USA and the USSR, although they're both working on big things.\n\nThe Soviet Union's economy would also begin to stagnate like the American one (although i'd be a short one just like the US one was and not a collapse-causing stagnation), meaning that Roscosmos also doesn't receive as much funding. An N1 rocket, this time with 30 NK-33 engines + OGAS computer guidance which guarantee far higher success would launch a Luna-like lander and a Lunokhod-like rover as part of Zond 6, not to the Moon, but instead it would be the first mission to see a landing on a near-earth asteroid and the first automatic sample return from it, this mission beginning on 29 May 1974. The Lunokhod rover would also offer great insights into the asteroid and around 5 kg of samples were returned from the asteroid. The first test flight of the Buran shuttle happens using an Antonov An-225 Mriya carrier aircraft, while the Energia rocket gets closer to completion, this shocks the United States. What's even worse is that Korolev and Chelomey have secretly agreed to use Soyuz, N1, Proton-K and Energia rockets for something grand: A crewed landing on the surface of Mars by the mid-1980s to the early 1990s,\n\nThe United States launches the Mariner 10 spacecraft and it successfully does a fly-by of Mercury, the first spacecraft to ever do so. NASA also begins working with the space agencies of Europe (ESA) and Japan (JAXA) and even launches an European astronaut to the Skylab space station on a Command and Service Module, doing a slew of science experiments on there and has been helping ESA and JAXA conduct rocket launches and ESA/JAXA have been partnering with NASA as well, this also comes from the reduced funding of NASA, from a peak of 6% (15B$/year) in 1965 down to just 1.5% today (5B$/year).\n\nNuclear power in the United States makes up 30% of energy production by this year instead of 20% and it is set to make up 60% by 1985 based on current policy-decisions done by the U.S. government and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Nuclear is also becoming much more popular, with it set to make up 50% of the world's energy grid by 1985 and 80% by 2000, with Japan, Soviet and France being other major users of nuclear besides the USA. Computer technology, especially through things like Arpanet, is in the level of the mid-to-late 1980s which is used by science academies, aerospace, military, stock markets and other important sectors/assets, having a computing power of around 1.5M operations/second and the first computers for commercial applications (personal computers) are being made by private startups, but these only have late 1960s to early 1970s level computing due to their lack of funding and technological capability, only having around 50,000 operations/second.\n\nThe United States would follow this Soviet achievement with their own mission, Surveyor 8, finally continuing these missions and it would see the American automatic landing and sample return from the same asteroid the Soviets landed on, 1974 TK7 (discovered 36 years earlier than in OTL), around 5 kg of samples were also returned from this asteroid. It was launched using a cargo-version of a Saturn V, but this would happen on November 5th, 1974, making the Soviets the definitive firsts to do such an act, which re-sparks the Space Race. Wernher Von Braun in this timeline is not fired and is still the chief rocket engineer at NASA. Thomas Paine is still the administrator as of now, just to know. Finally, space-wise, the Soviets would launch the Salyut 4 civilian space station and it would last 3 years before re-entering in 1977. It would be visited by Zvezda 17 and Zvezda 18 crews, specifically Zvezda 17 cosmonauts would be Aleksei Gubarev and Georgi Grechko and Zvezda 18 cosmonauts would be Pyotr Klimuk and Vitaly Sevastyanov. Skylab would also see astronaut missions Skylab 5 and 6, Skylab 5 carrying astronauts Neil Armstrong, William Thorton and Henry Hartsfield. Skylab 6 would carry astronauts Ulf Merbold (from West Germany), Daniel Brandenstein and Donald Williams.\n\nNorth Vietnam, led by Le Duan, would invade South Vietnam, taking over forested areas among the former Ho Chi Minh trail. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. decides to intervene and manages to push out North Vietnam out of the South, but falls short of actually invading North Vietnam in order to not ruffle any feathers with the Soviet Union, the ceasefire is ended and instead a full-on peace treaty is signed between the two sides, ending the war permanently. Turkey, who is a NATO member, invades Cyprus and occupies 37% of the island, dividing it into Cyprus and North Cyprus. This causes Greece to withdraw from NATO's command structure. Cabot Lodge had no choice but to play the middle man and as such a ceasefire was put into place and the USA would follow a policy of maintaining good relations with Greece and Turkey. Greece would in the same year come back to the command structure, albeit reluctantly.\n\n1975:\n\nThe U.S. government, specifically NASA, the Department of Energy and the Atomic Energy Commission are looking into nuclear fusion using deuterium and helium-3. President Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. has approved bills which increase nuclear fusion funding from the government to a record 1.75B$/year, or 0.7% of the federal budget, some say that this is a waste of money. NASA is looking for it because of potential space mining on the Moon (thanks to Apollo mission orbital observations using the CSM and LRO) and also for cleaner and better forms of propulsion, while the DoE and the AEC are looking for clean and non-radioactive sources of nuclear power, this also coming in the midst of the energy crisis caused by OPEC countries blocking oil exports to the USA. President Lodge and Prime Minister Wilson of the United Kingdom have also signed a partnership regarding space exploration, just like they did with West Germany 1 year prior.\n\nSpeaking of inflation, it remains high, hovering at 11-12%, despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to mitigate it, raising interest rates to around 9% as of 1975. This has caused an economic decline that coupled with this high level of inflation has been dubbed stagflation and has been a thorn in his administration, lowering his approval ratings down to just 40%. He has continued with his policies of fuel efficiency standards, strategic petroleum reserves, spending cuts and fiscal responsibility through creating workfare, making the Great Society less costly and more effective and also implementing EITC and food stamps to replace a chunk of the welfare system and also increasing the Social Security retirement age to 67 and removing the SST cap, among other things, which have led to a surplus of 180B$, up from a deficit of 50B$ during the LBJ administration.\n\nThe Soviet Venera 9 would successfully land on the surface of the Venus, staying around 2 minutes, (with the following mission, Venera 10, staying 14 minutes) and would also include pictures and other scientific observations of Venus, it happening on June 12th, 1975. With the followig mission in even deploying the first aerosat balloons in the atmosphere of Venus on September 16th, 1975. The Soviets would also send Zvezda 19 and Zvezda 20 to the Salyut space station, with the 19th mission having a stay of 22 days and the 20th mission having a 18 day stay.\n\nMeanwhile the Americans would land Viking 1 on the surface of Mars and take pictures and do scientific work, while Viking 2 would be used for orbital reconnaissance of Mars. Meanwhile, Skylab 7 which happened on the 22nd of May 1975, carrying 3 astronauts who would stay in the station for 123 days, Skylab 8 would see astronaut Helen Sharman (from the UK) and American astronauts David Walker and James van Hoften part of a 156 day stay, the longest so far in the station and it happened on the 1st of November of 1976.\n\nThe United States would send Apollo 26 to a flyby around the Moon using the Lunar Surface Access Module carrying 4 astronauts. This mission, besides successfully testing the LSAM in its full configuration of 4 astronauts as it was meant to be, would also offer a better Earthrise photo compared to the Apollo 8 mission. This mission will be essential in paving way for longer-duration lunar landing missions using the LSAM and in the future the Space Shuttle.\n\n1976:\n\nThe Equal Rights Amendment officially becomes the 24th amendment to the constitution of the United States of America, which would guarantee legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex and end distinctions between men and women in matters of divorce, property, employment etc. This came after the state of Illinois became the 39th state in the country to officially approve the ERA, 3 years before the deadline. This becomes an important political issue and represents a significant stepping stone when it comes to the rights of women in America, this would be celebrated by rockefeller republicans (including Lodge) and also liberal democrats.\n\nThe 1976 elections are also wild, as the Equal Rights Amendment, stagflation, the future of space travel, the energy crisis and even things like America's foreign policy were important issues. In the Republican primaries, incumbent president Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. would just narrowly manage to beat Ronald Reagan, a member of the party's right-wing conservative faction, 53% to 47% and winning only 40 delegates more than Reagan, which showed the party's ever-growing division. Meanwhile the Democratic Party would rally behind a 44-yr old Ted Kennedy, who was seen as a bright visionary and hopeful candidate in these desperate times, easily winning out with 57% of the vote against Jerry Brown, Henry Jackson, George Wallace and Jimmy Carter among others and also because Kennedy would be portrayed in a better light compared to today. George Wallace, discontent with the fact that both party candidates were liberals would run a third party Dixiecrat campaign. The presidential elections would result in the victory of Democrat Ted Kennedy with 310 electoral votes, the incumbent president would get 194 electoral votes while George Wallace and the Dixiecrat Party would get 34 electoral votes. Ted Kennedy's VP would be Birch Bayh, Henry Cabot Lodge's VP would be the current Nelson Rockefeller and George Wallace's VP would be Lester Maddox. He would be the first president to be a biological young brother of a previous president in American history.\n\nThe first shuttle mission (STS-1) is done, where the Space Shuttle Enterprise (the spaceplane), equipped with the first stage based on kerolox (RP-1/LOX) powered by 5 F-1 engines and with the second stage (also known as the external tank), powered by 3 RS-25 engines (strapped onto the spaceplane, not the tank, but the second stage fuel tank based on hydrolox - LH2/LOX is the fuel source) and the space shuttle would have its own OMS engines based on hypergolic propellant. The mission, uncrewed this time and not with astronauts, would send the shuttle into low-earth orbit and then have it land at a shuttle runway built near Cape Canaveral. The first stage (the RP-1/LOX stage) would also actually land itself at a Cape Canaveral landing pad using the RCS thrusters and 3 parachutes so that it wouldn't expend as much rocket fuel (only expending around 150,000 lbs of fuel instead of 500,000 lbs) and the second stage which deployed its 3 parachutes and would have used RCS thrusters to slow it down and then a helicopter would grab it and send it back to KSC.\n\nThe computer company, Apple, is founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, these people also being part of a growing movement seeking to privatize Arpanet and give this advanced government technology to the private sector where it could allow for all sorts of things. In the same year they create the Apple I computer, the company's first such computer. The American Bicentennial celebration also commences on the 4th of July of 1976, or 200 years after the declaration of independence of America from the British Empire.\n\nThe Soviet Union would send Zvezda 20 and 21 to the Salyut space station and would even land cosmonaut Yuri Glazkov to the surface of the Moon with the LK lunar lander, launched on an N1 rocket. They would also send the Venera 11 mission to the surface and orbit of the planet Venus. Meanwhile, a devastating death would happen, Sergei Korolev, chief rocket engineer of Roscosmos and the Soviet Union would die in 1976, at the age of 73. While he said he wanted to appoint Vasily Mikhin as his successor, he would serve for a short period before Vladimir Chelomey, the creator of the Proton-K and Energia rockets would become the next Roscosmos top dog, which may mean a completely new direction from that of Korolev.\n\nIn the United States, Skylab 9 and Skylab 10 would happen in the year 1976, these being missions to the Skylab space station, although these may soon be replaced by Space Shuttle missions, which may offer limitless potential due to its fully reusable properties, offering low-earth orbit (to Skylab), moon orbit and moon surface missions for astronauts. Meanwhile, Apollo 27 would see the return of humans to the Moon with the LSAM launched on a Saturn V, it only containing a 2-astronaut LSAM configuration. Astronauts Jack Lousma (commander) and Steven Nagel (pilot) for the first time since Apollo 25 in 1974.\n\n1977:\n\nTed Kennedy is officially sworn in as the 38th president of the United States and promises to fix the inflation crisis, to bring about great progress and to begin a new era of economic growth and American prosperity, tapping into the narrative of the cut-short wonder that his older brother John F. Kennedy would have brought when he was president, but was assassinated. In his first month of office, he appoints Paul Volcker, governor of the New York Federal Reserve as chairman of the Federal Reserve (across the entire USA) in order to deal with the crisis of inflation.\n\nThe deadliest accident in aviation history occurs as a Pan-American Airlines Boeing 747 collides into a KLM plane at Tenerife airport, killing 583 people, this would become known as the Tenerife disaster. South Vietnam's Nguyen Van Thieu decides to invade Cambodia, led by Pol Pot after a short-lasted cold war between the two, immediately toppling him alongside anti-Pol Pot resistance forces and the support of countries like Thailand and North Vietnam, soon enough, the Khmer Republic would be re-established with instead a president, Saukam Khoy, choosing not to bring back the unpopular dictatorship, although there would still be guerrila resistance for quite some time.\n\nIn this year, there are around 5 Shuttle missions, STS-2 on February 7th of 1977, STS-3 and STS-4 on August 20th, 1977, the first also being part of Skylab 11 and would send a new pair of astronauts, Richard Truly, Norman Thagard and Ellison Onizuka (the first Asian-American astronaut) to the Skylab space station. This would also see the testing of the fully-finished Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), first on the ground and then as part of a tethered spacewalk. STS-3 and STS-4 would be an unmanned mission and would launch the Voyager 1 and 2 probes, with the first set to make flybys of Jupiter and Saturn and the second set to make flybys of Uranus and Neptune before using them as gravity assists to go far out, beyond the solar system. The Voyager probes are also special not just that they're meant to study and offer great footage of the gas giants, but are also meant to be a message to the cosmos, just like the Pioneer 10 and 11 probes. STS-2 would be a Shuttle Enterprise mission and it would land at Edwards Air Force, STS-3 would be a Shuttle Columbia mission, STS-4 would be another Columbia mission.\n\nSTS-5 would launch astronauts Judith Resnik, James van Hoften (the first two who would land on the Moon using the LSAM), James Buchli and Steven Hawley (who would stay in the Space Shuttle) in lunar orbit as part of Apollo 28, landing on the Moon for the second time using the LSAM and also landing at Faustini crater. STS-6 would send another lunar reconnaissance orbiter made to be bigger and also a modified design of the Apollo Command & Service Module (CSM) and would also send cubesats to Moon orbit and low-earth orbit. STS-5 would be a Shuttle Enterprise mission and STS-6 would be a Shuttle Discovery mission. This year would also see two missions of the Space Shuttle Vanguard, owned by the USAF, one launched from Vanderberg Air Force Base and another from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base, but would both land at the Vanderberg runway, the first one carrying a military spy satellite and the other the first global positioning system (GPS) satellite, the Block I version. Launch costs have fallen significantly thanks to this Space Shuttle, instead of costing 10,000-15,000$/kg every launch, it costs just 1,000$/kg, a 90% reduction, while for the military shuttle (Vanguard) it is 2,500$/kg, due to its configuration not being fully reusable (only partial) and also the more expensive nature of miliary missions. t\n\nThe Soviet Union would for the first time launch the Buran spaceplane on the 5th of September 1977, mounting it on the Energia rocket and would send it to low-earth orbit, carrying two cosmonauts Igor Volk and Anatoly Levchenko as part of Zvezda 22 mission to the Salyut 6 space station, which was launched on a Proton-K rocket after the previous had re-entered just a few months prior, sadly making an Energia-boosting impossible. The Soviets would also successfully demonstrate the landing of their spaceplane, the Buran, autonomously.\n\nPaul Volcker, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, would begin raising interest rates to a record 15%, resulting in a reduction in inflation from 12% at the beginning of the year to just 5% by the end of it, although the economy would be at a slow down due to high interest rates, although the economic outlook would begin to improve as the inflation would begin to decline and thus the interest rates.\n\nIn this year, Ted Kennedy would manage to get a landmark universal healthcare bill, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which would implement for the first time actual healthcare in the USA, implementing mandatory private health insurance with a public government option, allowing 15% of the U.S. population, which previously did not have insurance, would now have access to it, fixing a fundamental problem within the healthcare system. He would also implement an amendment to the Clean air act that would expand the cap and trade system to other harmful substances like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) among other substances which are emitted and will also have more regulatory power given to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with narrow victories in Congress.\n\n1978:\n\nA civil war erupts in Afghanistan as local resistance in the form of the National Resistance Front (NRF), also known as the Mujahideen, rise up against the Soviet-backed communist government of Afghanistan, the Mujahideen being a group of islamist fighters willing to end Soviet, atheist control over their own country. Evsei Liberman, unlike Leonid Brezhnev of our own timeline, chooses not to invade the country, which leaves the Afghani civil war raging on for decades afterwards to the present day as there is no Soviet and American backing of any side, thus neither can break the stalemate.\n\nThere would be an additional 6 STS missions in 1978, the first one, STS-7, on February 12th, 1978 which had astronauts Bruce McCandless, Sally Ride, Ronald McNair and Robert Stewart would have Bruce McCandless conduct the first untethered spacewalk, going as far as 100 meters from the Space Shuttle Pioneer, using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU). STS-8 through 10 would also be low-earth orbit missions, while STS-11 would be a Type \"I\" mission meant for Shuttle lunar reconnaissance and extended orbital stays before returning to Earth, it also seeing the first spacewalk in lunar orbit by astronaut Robert Springer on the 8th of September 1978. STS-12 would see the first launch of Space Shuttle Victoria and it would be as part of a satellite repair mission on the 27th of September of 1978 and would carry astronauts Roberta Bondar (from Canada), Norman Thagard, Ronald Grabe and Loren Shriver to low-earth orbit.\n\nThe Soviet Union launches as part of Zvezda 23 cosmonauts Aleksei Gubarev and Vladimir Remek (from Czechoslovakia) as part of the first mission of the Interkosmos program of the Soviet Union, this program includes the USSR + the Warsaw pact countries but also other Soviet-aligned nations such as Mongolia, Vietnam, Cuba, Afghanistan, Syria and India. Zvezda 24 which would also happen this year, it carrying cosmonauts Pyotr Klimuk and Miroslaw Hermaszewksi (from Poland), the second mission of Interkosmos and all launched to the Salyut 6 space station on an Energia-Buran rocket. This also forces the United States to respond with its own multinational program known as Cosmos, which would include Canada, Japan, ESA-member states (West Germany, France, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and Switzerland) but also South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, this opening a new frontier space travel as it offered small countries the chance to explore space themselves, even if through the means of the Soviet and American space giants.\n\n1979:\n\nThe Soviet Ministry of Communication changes the name of OGAS to Sovnet, giving it the same naming style as America's Arpanet. This also comes after some computing power improvements to the system. Evsei Liberman also willingly signs into law the creation of the Soviet version of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the one that America has and the agency it, America, uses for its powerful internet system, which is used by government science foundations, the military etc. it being an interconnected link all under the government, while the people have a less advanced version of it from private companies, same thing in the Soviet Union, although their personal computers (from private companies) are worse due to the scarce number of them.\n\nIn this year, a group of businessman and scientists, mostly in the technology sector, such as Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and Paul Allen, Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, CERN scientist Tim Berners-Lee (and also the inventor of URL and HTTP, a decade or so earlier than in OTL), Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, Adobe CEO John Warnock, among others, have sent a letter to both United States President Ted Kennedy and Soviet President Evsei Liberman seeking the creation of a World Wide Web (WWW) that knows no borders and goes beyond their self-imposed Iron Curtain and also the privatization of Arpanet, giving it to the hands of private individuals and companies which they say will allow for a revolution in communication, technology, science and will even see a great political upheaval which shall be the new bearer of the next millenium, a better world for us all. However, their proposals (for now) are ignored. This letter officially saw the addition into the vernacular of the populace of \"internet rights activist.\"\n\nThere would be a record 14 shuttle (STS) missions this year, going from STS-12 to STS-26, 5 of them being Space Shuttle Victoria missions, 2 of them being Space Shuttle Kon-Tiki missions, 2 of them being Space Shuttle Enterprise missions, 2 of them being Space Shuttle Columbia missions, 1 of them being a Space Shuttle Discovery mission and another being a Space Shuttle Atlantis mission, the last two being the first of its kind and they would happen from a span of February-November 1979, including STS-18, which would see Shuttle Kon-Tiki refuel the Skylab space station, preventing its deorbiting and allowing for future missions on it. STS missions 14, 15, 20, 21 and 23 would all be missions to the Moon, with STS missions 20 and 21 actually landing astronauts on the surface as part of Apollo 29 and Apollo 30 both at Shackleton crater. STS mission 23 would carry the Viper rover to the Moon, it having the goal of collecting samples of helium-3 and water-ice from the lunar south pole. The other missions would be to the Skylab space station, reaching Skylab 22 to it.\n\nThe military (U.S. Air Force) would also have another slew of missions as part of STS-22B, STS-31C and STS-24D, the first two sending spy satellites to low-earth orbit and the other sending another GPS satellite and this would be done using the Space Shuttle Vanguard. STS-31C would be launched from Vanderberg, while the rest would be launched from Cape Canaveral.\n\nTed Kennedy successfully negotiates with the Shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to create a constitutional monarchy with a dominant-party system in politics, in the country while in return he would get more U.S. money for building up his country economically, for the secret police, for maintaining secularism and for the military and other things. The Iran Revolution would wound up being in fact just a small protest done by radical islamists and would paint them in an even worse picture as they commited violence to get their way. Aytollah Khomeini would be locked up for life instead of killed, as to prevent his martyrdom and riling up of other Iranian islamists, this preserves the Pahlavi Dynasty and also allows for more stability in the Middle East and in the world as the whole drama of the crisis does not happen. The Soviet Union, under Evsei Liberman, denounces this meddling and in response begins arming Iraq for a potential invasion of Iran.\n\nA nuclear meltdown is successfully averted at the Three Mile Island, as such in this timeline the anti-nuclear movement never gains popularity and nuclear is still viewed relatively positively. While yes the fact that Arpanet is more advanced in this timeline than in our own allowed for this, it still meant that the plant and other need service extensions and as such it was undertaken. In this timeline, as of 1979, nuclear makes up around 40% of energy production in the USA and clean energy sources overall have reached around 55%, surpassing fossil fuels for the first time. The previous years and this would begin to see significant reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gasses, like carbon dioxide, although there is a growing problem when it comes to CFCs and the ozone layer as environmental activists continue to raise the alarm about them. Ted Kennedy is working on an international agreement to phase out emissions of these CFCs, but it isn't coming to fruition yet.\n\n1979 would be a year of high economic growth, the U.S. economy growing by 5%, as the previous two saw slow increases after the end of the stagflation period and also . Prices across the board are beginning to decline as inflation is down to usual levels of 2-3% instead of high levels like 10% or 12%. The Iranian Revolution not happening also means that there isn't a second oil price shock. Japan would also become a country as its private companies are beginning to catch up to American ones, as they have companies like Toyota, LG, Sony etc. which is raising alarms. It became the 3rd country to hit the mark of 1T$, as the USA has 3T$ and the USSR has 2T$, it surpassing the countries of West Germany, the UK and France, who are all at 700-800B$. Some are beginning to say that the century beginning in 2001 will be known as the Japanese century.\n\nRoscosmos would have 3 Buran missions in 1979, one of them, Buran 3, would land cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalyonok and Alexei Leonov, and it would be the first landing of a spaceplane on the surface of another celestial body, also being intertwined with Soyuz 5. Meanwhile, Buran 2 and Buran 4 would be missions to the now Salyut 7 space station as part of Zvezda 25 and Zvezda 26 and Interkosmos 3 and 4. In this year, there would also be a Zvezda 27 mission but launched on a Soyuz rocket on the Soyuz crew capsule, it only carrying Romanian cosmonaut Dumitru Prunariu to Salyut 7 and . An Energia rocket would also launch a deep space mission, collecting an asteroid sample from near-earth asteroid 99942 Apophis and would later send this Vega probe as part of Vega 1 (Zond 7) on an impact course to asteroid 1855 Korolyov, named after the deceased Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev, who died in 1976. The Buran would carry not only the probe but also an upper stage for the probe meant to get it to the mentioned aster"
