        "text": "Neil A. Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on August 5, 1930. He began his NASA career in Ohio.\n\nArmstrong joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1955. Over the next 17 years, he was an engineer, test pilot, astronaut and administrator for NACA and its successor agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n\nHe was assigned as command pilot for the Gemini 8 mission. Gemini 8 was launched on March 16, 1966, and Armstrong performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space.\n\nArmstrong was decorated by 17 countries. He was the recipient of many special honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom; the Congressional Gold Medal; the Congressional Space Medal of Honor; the Explorers Club Medal; the Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy; the NASA Distinguished Service Medal etc.\n\nBorn on January 20, 1930 is an American former astronaut, engineer and fighter pilot. He made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission. He was the Lunar Module Eagle pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission and became the second person to walk on the Moon after mission commander Neil Armstrong.\n\nAfter earning a Doctor of Science degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA's Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis, Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, earned him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12, during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit.\n\nCharles \"Pete\" Conrad, Jr. (June 2, 1930 – July 8, 1999) was an American test pilot, aeronautical engineer and astronaut. During the Apollo 12 flight he became the third man to walk on the Moon. On August 21, 1965, Conrad flew into space as pilot of Gemini 5. This was the third trip by astronauts in NASA's Project Gemini. The trip lasted until August 29, 1965. Conrad made another spaceflight as command pilot (pilot in charge) of Gemini 11. This was the ninth trip by astronauts in Project Gemini. The trip lasted from September 12, 1966 to September 15, 1966.\n\nConrad made his third space flight as spacecraft commander (person in charge) of Apollo 12. This was the second trip to land astronauts on the moon. The trip lasted from November 14, 1969 to November 24, 1969. Conrad flew in space for the fourth time as commander of the Skylab 2 flight. This was the first flight to take astronauts to Skylab, the first space station sent into space by the United States. The trip lasted from May 25, 1973 to June 22, 1973.\n\nAlan Shepard (November 18, 1923 - July 21, 1998)was an American astronaut. He was the first American to travel into space. He was born in East Derry, New Hampshire. He received a Bachelor of Science at Naval Academy in 1944, graduated at Naval Testpilot School in 1951 and he earned a Master of Arts at the Naval War College in 1957.\n\nOn May 5, 1961, Shepard flew into space in the Mercury spacecraft. This was powered by a Redstone rocket.\n\nHe made another space flight as spacecraft commander (person in charge) of Apollo 14. This was the third trip to land astronauts on the moon. The trip lasted from January 31 - February 9, 1971.[2] At the age of 47, he was the oldest person to ever walk on the Moon.\n\nDavid Randolph \"Dave\" Scott (born June 6, 1932), (Col, USAF, Ret.), is an American former NASA astronaut, retired U.S. Air Force officer and former test pilot. He belonged to the third group of NASA astronauts, selected in October 1963. As an astronaut, Scott became the seventh person to walk on the Moon.\n\nAs an astronaut, Scott made his first flight into space as pilot of the Gemini 8 mission, along with Neil Armstrong, in March 1966, spending just under eleven hours in low Earth orbit. Scott then spent ten days in orbit as Command Module Pilot aboard Apollo 9, his second spaceflight, along with Commander James McDivitt and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart.\n\nDuring this mission, Scott became the last American to fly solo in Earth orbit (not counting subsequent untethered EVAs). Scott made his third and final flight into space as commander of the Apollo 15 mission, the fourth human lunar landing, becoming the seventh person to walk on the Moon and the first person to drive on the Moon.\n\nJames Benson \"Jim\" Irwin (March 17, 1930 – August 8, 1991) (Col, USAF) was an American astronaut and test pilot. He was the eighth person to walk on the Moon. Colonel Irwin was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He was crew commander of lunar module (LTA-8)—this vehicle finished the first series of thermal vacuum tests on June 1, 1968. He also served as a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 10 and as backup lunar module pilot for the Apollo 12 flight. Irwin served as lunar module pilot for Apollo, July 26 to August 7, 1971. His companions on the flight were David R. Scott, spacecraft commander and Alfred M. Worden, command module pilot. Apollo 15 was the fourth manned lunar landing mission and the first to visit and explore the moon’s Hadley Rille and Apennine Mountains which are located on the southeast edge of the Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains). The lunar module, “Falcon”, remained on the lunar surface for 66 hours, - more - National Aeronautics and Space Administration Biographical Data Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center Houston, Texas 77058 54 minutes—setting a new record for lunar surface stay time—and Scott and Irwin logged 18 hours and 35 minutes each in extravehicular activities conducted during three separate excursions onto the lunar surface.\n\nCaptain John Watts Young (September 24, 1930–January 5, 2018) was an American astronaut, naval officer and aviator, test pilot, and aeronautical engineer. He became the ninth person to walk on the Moon as Commander of the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. Young was on the first orbital Space Shuttle mission, STS-1, in April 1981. He was the only person to have piloted, and been commander of, four different classes of spacecraft: Gemini, the Apollo Command/Service Module, the Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle.\n\nIn September 1962, Young was selected as an astronaut. He is the first person to fly in space six times from earth, and seven times counting his lunar liftoff. Young was Command Module Pilot of Apollo 10. His fourth space flight, Apollo 16, April 16-27, 1972, was a lunar exploration mission, with Young as Spacecraft Commander, and Ken Mattingly and Charlie Duke. Young and Duke set up scientific equipment and explored the lunar highlands at Descartes. They collected 200 pounds of rocks and drove over 16 miles in the lunar rover on three separate geology traverses.\n\nCharles Moss \"Charlie\" Duke Jr. (born October 3, 1935), (Brig Gen, USAF, Ret.), is an American former astronaut, retired U.S. Air Force officer and test pilot. As Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 16 in 1972, he became the tenth and youngest person to walk on the Moon.\n\nHe is a former test pilot, Duke has logged 4,147 hours flying time, which includes 3,632 hours in jet aircraft; and 265 hours in space, plus 20 hours and 15 minutes of extravehicular activity.\n\nHe graduated from the Aerospace Research Pilot School in September 1965 and stayed on there as an instructor. He is a retired Air Force Reserve Brigadier General and was commissioned in 1957 upon graduation from the Naval Academy. Duke was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He served as member of the astronaut support crew for the Apollo 10 flight. He was CAPCOM for Apollo 11, the first landing on the Moon and he served as backup lunar module pilot on Apollo 13. Duke served as lunar module pilot of Apollo 16, April 16-27, 1972. He was accompanied on the fifth manned lunar landing mission by John W. Young (spacecraft commander) and Thomas K. Mattingly II (command module pilot). Apollo 16 was the first scientific expedition to inspect, survey, and sample materials and surface features in the Descartes region of the rugged lunar highlands\n\nEugene Andrew Cernan (March 14, 1934 – January 16, 2017) was an American astronaut, naval aviator, electrical engineer, aeronautical engineer, and fighter pilot. During the Apollo 17 mission, Cernan became the 11th human being to walk on the Moon. As he re-entered the Lunar Module after Harrison Schmitt on their third and final lunar excursion, he remains as of 2023, famously: \"The last human on the Moon\".\n\nBefore becoming an astronaut, Cernan graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University and joined the U.S. Navy through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC). After flight training, he received his naval aviator wings and served as a fighter pilot. In 1963, he received a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank of captain, he retired from the Navy in 1976.\n\nCernan travelled into space three times and to the Moon twice: as pilot of Gemini 9A in June 1966, as lunar module pilot of Apollo 10 in May 1969, and as commander of Apollo 17 in December 1972, the final Apollo lunar landing. Cernan was also a backup crew member of the Gemini 12, Apollo 7 and Apollo 14 space missions.\n\nHarrison Hagan Schmitt (born July 3, 1935) is an American geologist, retired NASA astronaut, university professor, former U.S. senator from New Mexico, and the most recent living person—and only person without a background in military aviation—to have walked on the Moon.\n\nIn December 1972, as one of the crew on board Apollo 17, Schmitt became the first member of NASA's first scientist-astronaut group to fly in space. As Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo missions, he also became the twelfth and second-youngest person to set foot on the Moon and the second-to-last person to step off of the Moon (he boarded the Lunar Module shortly before commander Eugene Cernan). Schmitt also remains the only professional scientist to have flown beyond low Earth orbit and to have visited the Moon. He was influential within the community of geologists supporting the Apollo program and, before starting his own preparations for an Apollo mission, had been one of the scientists training those Apollo astronauts chosen to visit the lunar surface.\n\nYuri Alekseyevich Gagarin (9 March 1934 – 27 March 1968) was a Soviet pilot and cosmonaut who, aboard the first successful crewed spaceflight, became the first human to journey into outer space. Travelling on Vostok 1, Gagarin completed one orbit of Earth on 12 April 1961. By achieving this major milestone for the Soviet Union amidst the Space Race, he became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including the nation's highest distinction: Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nHailing from the village of Klushino in the Russian SFSR, Gagarin was a foundryman at a steel plant in Lyubertsy in his youth. He later joined the Soviet Air Forces as a pilot and was stationed at the Luostari Air Base, near the Norway–Soviet Union border, before his selection for the Soviet space programme alongside five other cosmonauts. Following his spaceflight, Gagarin became the deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre, which was later named after him. He was also elected as a deputy of the Soviet of the Union in 1962 and then to the Soviet of Nationalities, respectively the lower and upper chambers of the Supreme Soviet.\n\nVostok 1 was Gagarin's only spaceflight, but he served as the backup crew to Soyuz 1, which ended in a fatal crash, killing his friend and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. Fearful that a high-level national hero might be killed, Soviet officials banned Gagarin from participating in further spaceflights. After completing training at the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy in February 1968, he was again allowed to fly regular aircraft. However, Gagarin died five weeks later, when the MiG-15 that he was piloting with flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin crashed near the town of Kirzhach.\n\nValentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova (born 6 March 1937) is a Russian engineer, member of the State Duma, and former Soviet cosmonaut, being the first woman ever to fly in space. She is known for being the first and youngest woman in space, having flown a solo mission on the Vostok 6 on 16 June 1963. She orbited the Earth 48 times, spent almost three days in space, and remains the only woman to have been on a solo space mission.\n\nBefore her selection for the Soviet space program, Tereshkova was a textile factory worker and an amateur skydiver. She joined the Air Force as part of the Cosmonaut Corps and was commissioned as an officer after completing her training. After the dissolution of the first group of female cosmonauts in 1969, Tereshkova remained in the space program as a cosmonaut instructor. She later graduated from the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy and re-qualified for spaceflight, but never went to space again. She retired from the Air Force in 1997 having attained the rank of major general.\n\nBorn March 3, 1946, in Warsaw, New York. Currently resides in Woodbine Maryland.\n\nAs test pilot, Adamson has flown research aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base, Princeton University, West Point, Patuxent Naval Air Station, and NASA Houston.

He has a Class 1 cosmonaut certification.\n\n9\n\nAleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov, born in Moscow, Russia on February 20, 1943 is a former Soviet cosmonaut and twice Hero of the Soviet Union. He graduated from Moscow Bauman-Highschool in 1969 with a doctorate degree, specialised on spacecraft steering systems.\n\nHe was selected as cosmonaut on December 1, 1978.[1] For his first spaceflight, he flew as Flight Engineer on Soyuz T-9, which lasted from June to November 1983. For his second spaceflight, he replaced one of the long-duration crew members of Mir EO-2. For the spaceflight, he was launched with the spacecraft Soyuz TM-3 in July 1987, and landed with the same spacecraft in December 1987. All together he spent 309 days, 18 hours, 2 minutes in space. He served as backup for Soyuz T-8, Soyuz T-13, and Soyuz T-15. He resigned from the cosmonaut team on October 26, 1993, when he became chief of NPOE Cosmonaut-group; since 1996 he is Chief flight test directorate of RKKE.\n\n10\n\nWILLIAM A. ANDERS, Born October 17, 1933, in Hong Kong.\n\nWhile at NASA, he became involved in dosimetry, radiation effects, and environmental controls.[9] In September 1966, he was the backup pilot for the Gemini 11 mission, with Neil Armstrong as the backup commander. This would have put him in line to fly a Gemini 13 mission, but no such mission was flown; Project Gemini ended with Gemini 12. Armstrong and Anders then became the first astronauts to fly the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle. The astronauts in his group without test pilot training—Anders, Roger Chaffee, Walter Cunningham, Rusty Schweickart, Gene Cernan and Buzz Aldrin—were assigned to Apollo crews as the lunar module pilot (LMP), the lowest-ranking crew member.\n\nOn 22 December 1966, Anders was assigned to the third Apollo mission, which was to be commanded by Frank Borman, with command module pilot (CMP) Michael Collins; Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin were assigned as their backup crew the following year. Collins was replaced by Lovell in July 1968, after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair. The mission, scheduled for December 1968, was intended to be a second test of the lunar module (LM) in medium Earth orbit,] but the delivery of the LM fell behind schedule, and when it arrived at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in June 1968, more than a hundred significant defects were discovered. There was no prospect of it being ready to fly in 1968. In August 1968, there were reports, including one from the CIA, that the Soviet Union was planning a crewed lunar orbit mission before the end of the year.\n\nIn December 1968, Anders flew on the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission where humans traveled beyond low Earth orbit, and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed an \"Earthrise\" for the first time in human history. NASA's Lunar Orbiter 1 had taken the first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on 23 August 1966.\n\n13\n\nBorn February 23, 1959, in Omaha, Nebraska. He considers Ashland, Nebraska, to be his hometown. Married to the former Susan Jane Harreld of Elkhart, Indiana.\n\nAnderson joined the JSC, NASA in 1983 in the Mission Planning and Analysis Division, performing rendezvous and proximity operations trajectory designs for early space shuttle and International Space Station missions. In 1988, he moved to the Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) as a Flight Design Manager, leading the trajectory design team for the Galileo planetary mission (STS-34) while serving as the backup for the Magellan planetary mission (STS-31). In 1989, Anderson was chosen to be supervisor of the MOD Ascent Flight Design Section and, following reorganization, the Flight Design Engineering Office of the Flight Design and Dynamics Division. In 1993, he was named the Chief of the Flight Design Branch. From 1996 until his selection, Anderson held the post of Manager, Emergency Operations Center, NASA Johnson Space Center.\n\nSelected as a Mission Specialist by NASA in June 1998, he reported for training in August of that year. Training included orientation briefings and tours, numerous scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in shuttle and International Space Station systems, physiological training, ground school to prepare for T-38 flight training as well as learning water and wilderness survival techniques.\n\nPrior to being assigned to a spaceflight, Anderson served as lead for the Enhanced Caution and Warning (ECW) System development effort within the space shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade (CAU) project. Previously, he was the Crew Support astronaut for International Space Station Expedition 4, providing ground support on technical issues in addition to supporting the crew families. Anderson also served as a space station Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) and as the Astronaut Office Crew Representative for the space station electrical power system. In November 2002, Anderson completed training in the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Skills program. He also served as backup Flight Engineer for International Space Station Expeditions 12, 13 and 14. A veteran of two space flights, Anderson has logged 167 days in space and 38 hours and 28 minutes of EVA in six spacewalks. He completed 5 months aboard the space station in 2007 and served aboard the STS-131 crew in 2010.\n\n15\n\nOleg Yur'yevich At'kov born on 9 May 1949 is a Russian cardiologist and former Soviet cosmonaut. With a doctorate from the Russian Academy of Medical Science, Atkov was chosen to be the health specialist on board Soyuz T-10 and Soyuz T-11.\n\nAtkov is notable for his lengthy time in orbit, with a total flight time of 236 days, 22 hours, and 49 minutes. As a cardiologist, it was his duty to monitor the health of the other cosmonauts on board and to research the long term effects of zero gravity on the human body.\n\nOn February 8, 1984 Atkov made a spaceward flight as a cosmonaut-researcher at the spaceship \"Soyuz T-10V\".\n\nWhile in flight, Dr. Atkov had the primary duty of researching the long term effects of space flight such as what happens to the body over the course of a year in zero gravity. Measurements were consecutively taken using echocardiographic and biochemical systems. In addition, studies were conducted on vestibular and sensory organs. In order to avoid muscle deterioration and keep the crew members active, the cosmonauts exercised for an hour twice a day three days in a row, with an \"active rest\" day in between where they were encouraged to take water-salt supplements.\n\nSergei Vasilyevich Avdeyev Avdeyev was born on Born on 1st January 1956 in Chapayevsk, Samara Oblast (formerly Kuybyshev Oblast), Russian SFSR.\n\nHe was selected as a cosmonaut as part of the Energia Engineer Group 9 on 26 March 1987. His basic cosmonaut training was from December 1987 through to July 1989. He retired as a cosmonaut on 14 February 2003.\n\nAvdeyev at one point held the record for cumulative time spent in space with 747.59 days in Earth orbit, accumulated through three tours of duty aboard the Mir Space Station. He has orbited the Earth 11,968 times traveling about 515,000,000 kilometers. In August 2005, this record was taken by another cosmonaut, Sergei K. Krikalev; it has since been surpassed by several other cosmonauts and the current record of 879 days was set by Gennady Padalka in 2015.\n\nTime dilation Record: For a long time, Avdeyev held the record for time dilation experienced by a human being. In his 747 days aboard Mir, cumulative across three missions, he went approximately 27,360 km/h and thus aged roughly 0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds) slower from an Earthbound person's perspective, which is considerably more than any other human being, except Sergei Krikalev. This is due to the special relativistic effect of time dilation and is not properly thought of as time travelling as described by mainstream culture. A common misconception is that the Apollo program astronauts hold the record—they did go faster than Avdeyev, but they were only in space for a few days.\n\n20\n\nBorn April 28, 1949, in Springfield, Massachusetts, but considers Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to be his hometown.\n\nIn 1980 Dr. Apt joined the Earth and Space Sciences Division of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), doing planetary research, studying Venus, Mars, and the outer solar system.

From 1982 through 1985, he was a flight controller responsible for Shuttle payload operations at NASA’s Johnson Space Center.\n\nHe was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in June 1985, and qualified as an astronaut in July 1986. His assignments to date have included Shuttle Orbiter modification support at Kennedy Space Center, developing techniques for servicing the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gamma Ray Observatory, development of EVA (space walk) construction and maintenance techniques for Space Station, as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for Shuttle flights, the voice link between the flight crew and the Mission Control Center (MCC), and the Astronaut Office EVA point of contact.\n\nApt flew as a member of the crew of the space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-37 mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 5, 1991. After completing 93 orbits of the Earth, the crew landed Atlantis at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 11, 1991.\n\nDr. Apt was Endeavour’s flight engineer on the crew of STS-47, Spacelab-J. This eight-day cooperative mission between the United States and Japan was launched on September 12, 1992, to perform life science and materials processing experiments in space. Dr. Apt was responsible for operating the Orbiter during one of the two shifts on this dual shift mission. After completing 126 orbits of the Earth, the crew landed Endeavour at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 20, 1992.\n\nHe flew again aboard Endeavour on STS-59, the first flight of the Space Radar Laboratory, from April 9-20, 1994. As the blue shift commander, he was responsible for operating Endeavour during one of the two shifts on an 11-day mission to observe the land surface and oceans of Earth with three imaging radar systems, and to map air pollution in the lower atmosphere. After completing 183 orbits of the Earth, the crew landed Endeavour at Edwards Air Force Base, California.\n\nHe served aboard Atlantis during mission STS-79, September 16-26, 1996. The crew docked Atlantis with the Russian Mir space station, having ferried supplies, personnel, and scientific equipment to this base 240 miles above the Earth This historic mission of international cooperation and scientific research ended at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, after 160 orbits of the Earth.\n\nWith the completion of his fourth flight, Dr. Apt has logged over 847 hours (35 days) in space, including 10 hours and 49 minutes on two space walks. He has flown around the Earth 562 times.\n\n22\n\nLEE J ARCHAMBAULT was Born on August 25, 1960 in Oak Park, Illinois, but considers Bellwood, Illinois to be his hometown.\n\nHe has logged over 5,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nSelected as a pilot by NASA in June 1998, Archambault reported for training in August 1998. Upon completion of astronaut candidate training in June 1999, Archambault was assigned to the Astronaut Office Shuttle Operations branch, where he worked on flight instrument upgrades that were incorporated into the shuttle in 2003. Archambault also served as an Astronaut Support Person at the Kennedy Space Center and performed duties as spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM).\n\nArchambault completed his first flight in space as the pilot on STS-117 (June 8-22, 2007) and then served as the spacecraft commander for STS-119 (March 15-28, 2009). He logged a total of 27 days in space. Following his two missions in space, he concluded his duties at NASA as the Astronaut Office Exploration Branch Chief.

He was the first commander of the cosmonaut corps and the cosmonaut who commanded the historic Voskhod 2 mission which saw the first man walk in space in 1965.\n\nDuring Belyayev's final studies at the Red banner Air Force Academy he had been interviewed and tested for possible inclusion in the space program. Belyayev reported for assignment at the newly formed TsPK (cosmonaut training centre) on 25 March 1960. At 34, he was the oldest candidate accepted into the program. As a major he was the highest ranking candidate and the only one to have seen active service in World War II. Because of his senior rank, Belyayev became the first commander of the cosmonaut corps.\n\nAfter the success of the first Voskhod mission in 1964, a second more technically demanding mission was planned for 1965. Its primary aim was to have a cosmonaut leave the capsule and \"space-walk\". Belyayev was confirmed as prime crew commander of Voskhod 2 just 3 days prior to launch.\n\nVoskhod 2 launched with Belyayev and Leonov on board on 18 March 1965. Belyayev's call sign was Diamond and his designation as mission commander was 1.\n\nAfter Leonov successfully performed the first space walk, Belyayev prepared to return to Earth. Belyayev had to perform a manual reentry when the automatic reentry system failed. After the success of the mission Belyayev and Leonov were awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal, given 15,000 rubles, a Volga car and 45 days leave.\n\n26\n\nGeorgy Timofeyevich Beregovoy was born on 15 April 1921 in Fedorivka, Poltava Oblast, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Ukraine). was a Soviet cosmonaut who commanded the space mission Soyuz 3 in 1968. From 1972 to 1987, he headed the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.\n\nAt the time of his space flight, Beregovoy was 47 years of age: he was the earliest-born human to go to orbit, being born three months and three days earlier than the second earliest-born man in orbit – John Glenn, but later than X-15 pilot Joe Walker who made 2 (or 3, according to USAF definition) suborbital space flights.\n\nIn 1965, Colonel Beregovoy was scheduled to fly the following year in Voskhod 3, but the mission was never launched.\n\nOn 25 October 1968 Beregovoy took the Soyuz 3 into outer space: he orbited the Earth for almost four days at an altitude of up to 252 km. As part of his mission, Beregovoy twice maneuvered his craft into rendezvous positions with the uncrewed Soyuz 2 satellite[4] but was unable to establish a direct physical link to the craft before returning on 30 October 1968.\n\nNonetheless, Beregovoy's flight was in some ways an encouraging success for the Soviet crewed space program, and the colonel was celebrated as a hero upon his return. Soyuz 3 was Beregovoy's only spaceflight and soon after it he retired from active duty, having been promoted to Major General.\n\n28\n\nEllen Louise Shulman Baker, M.D., M.P.H.

His first spaceflight was Soyuz TM-25, on which he was the flight engineer.\n\nLazutkin was aboard the Mir Space Station when a collision occurred with the uncrewed Progress M34, its supply craft which was piloted by Vasily Tsibliyev while on the Mir. The collision, which is considered the worst in the history of the space age, knocked out the Spektr's solar panels and took the Mir out of its alignment with the sun, also causing it to lose power. It also caused the cabin to decompress.\n\nQuick action by the three crewmen managed to stave off immediate disaster. Lazutkin and fellow crewman Michael Foale quickly severed the connecting cables with the module and sealed off the hatches to the module, saving the rest of the station. Lazutkin managed to successfully cut some of the wires connecting the Mir and the Spektr using a tiny dinner knife. A few days after the collision, Tsibliyev and Lazutkin were ordered to attempt to repair the Mir. Foale was ordered to the Soyuz-TM escape pod. The station was eventually secured safely.\n\nGregory Errol Chamitoff (born 6 August 1962) is a Canadian-born American engineer and former NASA astronaut.

Clifford performed a 6-hour spacewalk, the first while docked to an orbiting space station, to mount experiment packages on the Mir docking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. Following 145 orbits of the Earth, Atlantis landed with a crew of five at Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 31, 1996.\n\nMalenchenko served as a mission specialist for STS-106. Space Shuttle Atlantis lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on September 8, 2000. After circling the globe for 186 orbits, Atlantis landed on September 19, 2000, at Runway 15, KSC. The mission lasted 11 days, 19 hours and 12 minutes.\n\nMalenchenko conducted his first and second career spacewalks during the Mir-16 mission. He performed two spacewalks on September 9, 1994 (5h 06m) and September 14, 1994, in which the station's external insulation was repaired. The first and second spacewalks lasted 5 hours and 6 minutes, and 6 hours and 1 minute respectively.\n\nMalenchenko performed his third career spacewalk during the STS-106 mission to the ISS. On flight day three, Malenchenko and NASA astronaut Ed Lu conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk. The spacewalk started at 04:55 GMT on September 11 when the two spacewalkers exited the shuttle's airlock. This spacewalk marked the sixth spacewalk in support of the ISS assembly and the 50th spacewalk in space shuttle history.\n\nOn November 9, 2007, Malenchenko performed his fourth career spacewalk. On 20 August 2012, Malenchenko together with cosmonaut Gennady Padalka participated in his fifth career spacewalk.\n\nMalenchenko arrived at the ISS Soyuz TMA-19M to join the Expedition 46 crew. He performed a manual docking due to a malfunction in the automatic docking system. Progress MS-1 was then scheduled for launch to the ISS, atop a Soyuz 2.1a, on 21 December. Planned for a launch date of no earlier than 7 February 2016, the SpaceX CRS-8 mission provided the ISS with the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module. Two EVAs were performed during Expedition 46. He returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-19M, and landed on 18 June 2016 09:15 UTC, after spending additional 186 days in space.\n\nEILEEN MARIE COLLINS was born on November 19, 1956, in Elmira, New York. Selected by NASA in January 1990, Collins became an astronaut in July 1991.\n\nCollins served as pilot on STS-63 (February 3-11, 1995) and STS-84 (May 15-24, 1997), and was the commander on STS-93 (July 22-27, 1999) and STS-114 (July 26 to August 9, 2005). A veteran of four space flights, Collins has logged over 872 hours in space. Collins retired from NASA in May 2006.\n\nSTS-63 Discovery (February 3-11, 1995) was the first flight of the new joint Russian-American Space Program. Mission highlights included the rendezvous with the Russian Space Station Mir, operation of Spacehab, the deployment and retrieval of an astronomy satellite, and a space walk. Collins was the first woman pilot of a Space Shuttle.\n\nSTS-84 Atlantis (May 15-24, 1997) was NASA's sixth Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir.\n\nSTS-93 Columbia (July 23-27, 1999) was the first Shuttle mission to be commanded by a woman. STS-93 highlighted the deployment of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. On STS-93, Collins was the first woman Shuttle Commander.\n\nSTS-114 Discovery (July 26-August 9, 2005) was the Return to Flight mission during which the Shuttle docked with the International Space Station and the crew tested and evaluated new procedures for flight safety and Shuttle inspection and repair techniques. After a 2-week, 5.8 million mile journey in space, the orbiter and its crew of seven astronauts returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California.\n\nMICHAEL COLLINS was Born in Rome, Italy, on October 31, 1930.\n\nCollins was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA in October 1963. He served as backup pilot for the Gemini VII mission.\n\nAs pilot on the 3-day Gemini X mission, launched July 18, 1966, Collins shared with command pilot John Young in the accomplishments of that record-setting flight. These accomplishments included a successful rendezvous and docking with a separately launched Agena target vehicle and, using the power of the Agena, maneuvering the Gemini spacecraft into another orbit for a rendezvous with a second, passive Agena. Collins' skillful performance in completing two periods of extravehicular activity included the recovery of a micrometeorite detection experiment from the passive Agena. Gemini X attained an apogee of approximately 475 statute miles and traveled a distance of 1,275,091 statute miles--after which splashdown occurred in the West Atlantic, 529 miles east of Cape Kennedy. The spacecraft landed 2.6 miles from the USS GUADALCANAL and became the second spacecraft in the Gemini program to land within eye and camera range of the prime recovery ship.\n\nCollins served as command module pilot on Apollo 11, July 16-24, 1969--the first lunar landing mission. He remained aboard the command module , \"Columbia,\" on station in lunar orbit while Neil Armstrong , spacecraft commander, and Edwin Aldrin, lunar module pilot, descended to the lunar surface in their lunar module \"Eagle.\" Collins performed the final re-docking maneuvers following a successful lunar orbit rendezvous which was initiated by Armstrong and Aldrin from within the \"Eagle\" after their ascent from the lunar surface. Among the accomplishments of the Apollo 11 mission were collection of lunar surface samples for return to earth, deployment of lunar surface experiments, and an extensive evaluation of the life supporting extravehicular mobility unit worn by astronauts.\n\nCollins completed two space flights, logging 266 hours in space--of which 1 hour and 27 minutes was spent in EVA.\n\nTalgat Amangeldyuly Musabayev (Kazakh: born 7 January 1951) is a Kazakh test pilot and former cosmonaut who flew on three spaceflights. His first two spaceflights were long-duration stays aboard the Russian space station Mir. His third spaceflight was a short duration visiting mission to the International Space Station, which also carried the first paying space tourist Dennis Tito. He retired as a cosmonaut in November 2003. Since 2007 he has been head of Kazakhstan's National Space Agency, KazCosmos.\n\nMusabayev was selected to be a cosmonaut on 11 May 1990.\n\nHis first spaceflight was as a crew member of the long-duration mission Mir EO-16, which was launched and landed by the spacecraft Soyuz TM-19 which lasted from 1 July 1994 to 4 November 1994, for a total duration of 125 days 22 hours 53 minutes\n\nHis second spaceflight was as Commander of another long-duration expedition called Mir EO-25, which was launched by the spacecraft Soyuz TM-27. The mission lasted from 29 January 1998 to 25 August 25, 1998.\n\nHis third mission was as Commander of ISS EP-1, which was a visiting mission to the International Space Station. It was launched by Soyuz TM-32, and was landed by Soyuz TM-31 on 6 May 2001, for a total duration of 7 days 22 hours 4 minutes.[1] This visiting mission was notable for carrying the first ever paying space tourist Dennis Tito.\n\nAs of 2007, he was among the top 30 cosmonauts by time in space.\n\nLEROY GORDON COOPER, JR. NASA ASTRONAUT born in Shawnee, Oklahoma (March 6, 1927 - Oct. 4, 2004).\n\nColonel Cooper was selected as a Mercury astronaut in April 1959. On May 15-16, 1963, he piloted the “Faith 7” spacecraft on a 22-orbit mission which concluded the operational phase of Project Mercury. During the 34 hours and 20 minutes of flight, Faith 7 attained an apogee of 166 statue miles and a speed of 17,546 miles per hour and traveled 546,167 statute miles.\n\nCooper served as command pilot of the 8-day 120-revolution Gemini 5 mission which began on August 21, 1965. It was on this flight that he and pilot Charles Conrad established a new space endurance record by traveling a distance of 3,312,993 miles in an elapsed time of 190 hours and 56 minutes. Cooper also became the first man to make a second orbital flight and thus won for the United States the lead in man-hours in space by accumulating a total of 225 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nOleg Viktorovich Novitsky (Russian:; born October 12, 1971) is a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Russian Air Force who logged over 700 hours of flight time and was awarded for bravery.
