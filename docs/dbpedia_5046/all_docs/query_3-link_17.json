The Moscow State Order of Lenin and Order of the Labor Red Banner Transformer Factory i/n Kuibyshev (Cosudarstvenny Ordena LePina i Ordena Trudovogo Krasnogo Znameni Moskovski Trans rormatorny Zavod imeni Kuibysheva) Is located at /1 Elektrozavodskaya Ulitsa, Stalinski Raion, Moscow. 2, Communications include the Metro-Elektrozmoodskaya Station, Streetcars Nos. 14 and 43, and the Kazan Railway. Since the beginning of 1950 a new station called Elektrozavodskaya has been opened on the Kazan Railway. A branch line runs from the Kazan Railway to the factory. 3. The factory is at present under the Uiristry of:Electrical Industry and is directly controlled by the Chief Directorate of the Electrical Engineering Industry of the ministry (Glavn4ye Upravleniye Elektromashinnoi Promyshlen- nosti or Glavelektromash)0 The ministry and the chief-directorate have their headquarters at 7 Kitaiski Proyezd, Moscow,. flistoy 4. The factory can be said to date from 1977 when the enormous Elektrozavod (Electric Factory) was formed. This factory was instructed by Lenin's directives to provide all the necessary electrical material for the electri- fication of the country. The Elektrozavod was divided into several shops, such as the transformer shop, the electric lamp shop, motor and tractor electrical equipment shop, glass shop, and shop for the manufacture of machinery for electric lamp production. The initial production of the factory also included static condensers, radio tubes, and electrical domestic appliances. 5. With the development of the factory and increased output, defects in pro- duction became apparent. Elektrozavod was split up and shops converted into factories. The electric lamp shop, the transformer shop, and the motor and tractor electrical equipment shop were converted into factories and are located together at 21 and 73 Elektrozavodskaya Ulitsa. The glass shop became the Glass Factory i/n Ukhanov with premises at 29 Smirnovskaya Ulitsa, and the shop for the manufacture of machinery for electric lamp production became a factory with premises at 40 Bolshaya Semenovskaya Ulitsa, CL ASSIFICATIONFq.itVIWCZILVOL-U.S. OFFICIALS ONLY STATE K ,k, NAVY AIR N ; mom ipeti J _ _ . _ .

All these factories were brought boa) the Electro-Technical Combine under control of the ill.-Union Electrical Association OneSOYUZnove RlAleityPie,haidenvo Obedineniye at VE0) of the Chief Directorate for Power Industry (Glavenergo - prom). 7. The transformer factory was called Motes and produced electric furnaces in addition to transformers. B. As production increased, the factories became independent enterprises under the control of chief directorates and in some cases under the control of ministries. The transformer factory, for instance, comes under the Ministry of Electrical Industry and the electrie lamplractory under the lanistry of Telecommunications Industry. 9. The name Flektrozavod is still used both by the press erd in general conversa- tion when referring to the electric lamp factory, the transformer factory, and the motor and tractor electrical equipment factory. These three factories, as previeway steted, are located together, and they occupy a whole street block. 10. Before the war the transformer factory came under the People's Commissariat for Elecirical Industry, The factory built large transformer stations for DneproOM (Dnepr Electric Power Station) and for the Svirstrol (Svir Electric Power Station Construction). The factory was awarded the Order of Lenin for fulfilling successfully the program laid down in Stalin's first Five-Year Plan, 1I. The factory was partially evacuated during the war but at the beginning of lea,/ returned to Moscow to its old site and pr samed its former production under. the People's Commissariat for rlectrice Industry. The factory had ceased to produce electric furnaces before the war, As a wartime measure three engineering shops were employed on the production of ammunition under the People's Commissariat for Ammunition. I/. Since the end of the war the factory has continued to specialize in trans.- former production. In 1946 the factory started producing increased types of higher rated transformers; during the war no large high tension tapped transformers with switching arrangements were used owing to the lack of switches (pereklyuchatel pod nagruzkoi). Special switch pear for tanped transformers are now being produced in the factory, and a switch pear shop (tsekh pereklyuchatelei) has been set up in the factory. All articles produced by the factory are stamped rTZ (Moskovski Trnnsformatoray ZavoI - Moscow Transformer Factory). Present Production 13, The factory now produces over 100 typos of transformers which include: a. Three-phase oil-cooled double-coil (avukhobmotochny) power trans- formers, with nominal rating from 10 kva to 60,000 kva.
