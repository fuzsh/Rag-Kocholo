        "text": "At the heart of the Cold War conflict were the competing worldviews held by the two blocs—Soviet communism and American capitalism. In a cultural context, this tension played out as an ideological competition between socialist realism from the Soviet Union and abstract expressionism from the United States. Art functioned as a means to demonstrate political and intellectual achievement, and as such both blocs funded exhibitions, travel grants and scholarships for cultural practitioners in nonaligned states as a means of soft power. Aggressive attempts to sway emerging postcolonial states were at times suspected as the return of imperialism, thus the rhetoric for Cold War ideological battles was disguised under the affectionate term of ‘friendship’. International funding from Cold War blocs to develop the fields of education, culture, economy and infrastructure in Indonesia was promoted under the guise of ‘friendship aid’, as can be seen in the pages of state-funded diplomatic embassy magazines such as Negeri Sovyet (Soviet country) and Aneka Amerika (American miscellany). This essay will outline the strategies of US and Soviet cultural diplomacy in Indonesia during the Cold War years from 1950 to 1965. Rather than work within the strict framework of Cold War bipolarity, I will explore the reciprocity between nationalism and internationalism, and examine how Indonesian artists transcended ideological divides. This essay considers artistic and exhibition outcomes of cultural diplomacy in Indonesia under that government’s astute policy of ‘friendship’, which allowed both the government and artists to engage with—and also work outside—the bounds of cultural propaganda. I will then look at the traffic of cultural exchange between Indonesia and the world that operated outside of the influence of Cold War geopolitics."
