Alliluyeva).\n\nIn the morning Vladimir Ilyich received Gorbunov.[23] After 11.30 Kamenev; meeting at 6 o’clock.[24] There have been no orders. Lydia Alexandrovna [Fotieva] has a paper[25] for voting[1] which Vladimir Ilyich asked to be reminded of from 5-6 p.m. in order to have a talk with Stalin. But Lydia Alexandrovna kept it and said that the explanations he wished to receive from Stalin she would give him herself, so there was no need to remind him, but Lydia Alexandrovna would remind him. Kamenev 10.15-10.45.\n\nNovember 21, evening.\n\nHaskell—11.30 }\n\nStalin—12.30 } appointment for November 22[2]\n\nRe Haskell and Lers (interpreter), orders given to the commandant’s office.\n\nNovember 22, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nI. Morning no orders. Appointments kept.\n\n[For] the evening—Kivdilo and Brodovsky at 6 o’clock (workers of the porcelain works),[3] will be received in the following order: at 6 they will arrive at Gorbunov’s office and he will interview them and inform us, and then Vladimir Ilyich will drop in for a minute.\n\nAn order has to be given concerning the pass (through the Troitsky Gate).\n\nII. Vladimir Ilyich has given a letter, strictly confidential, concerning Haskell’s proposal, to be sent round to all the members of the Politbureau and Chicherin. Eight copies have been sent to Nazaretyan[26] to be circulated for voting.[4] Check with Burakova[27]—received.\n\nIII. Gorbunov’s papers addressed to the presiding committee of the Fifth All-Russia Congress of the Soviet Employees Trade Union[28] to be given to Vladimir Ilyich to sign (to be returned to Gorbunov after signing).\n\nNovember 23, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nAt 11 in the morning Vladimir Ilyich has a meeting of the Politbureau up to 2.30.[29] So far no orders have been given.\n\nIf Vladimir Ilyich asks about the letter to Hoover he is to be told that Chicherin is seeing to that himself. Haskell is leaving today at 7.20. The letter will be handed to him through Lander (as Vladimir Ilyich asked). No reception for the evening so far.\n\nNovember 23, evening (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).\n\nAt 5.40 Vladimir Ilyich was in his office. Asked for the packet from Sklyansky[30] and when the Politbureau minutes would be ready and how this was being handled technically. I got in touch with Sklyansky, who promised to deliver the packet in the morning of November 24.\n\n6.45 packet to Sokolnikov.[31]\n\n8.05 Vladimir Ilyich wanted to talk with Stalin, who proved to be engaged at a meeting of the Central Committee Secretariat. Vladimir Ilyich said: “either in the evening or the morning, there’s no need to bother him now.” At 8.30 he left.\n\nVladimir Ilyich looked through all the new books. I gave Vladimir Ilyich the packet from Zinoviev[32] and the material from Zax. Vladimir Ilyich asked for the agenda of the meeting of the Large Council of People’s Commissars and gave a letter to be translated from Russian into English. At 10.05 Vladimir Ilyich left.\n\nNovember 24, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich wanted to receive Meisner (of the Fishing Industry Board), he may possibly receive him today—so far it is unknown.\n\nPossibly this evening or tomorrow in the daytime Vladimir Ilyich will receive Sklyansky and Pantsendjansky on the question of the ship-repair programme.[5] [33]\n\nVladimir Ilyich asked that Earsman and Garden[34]—delegates of the Australian Party, should be kept on phone call this evening from 5 to 9, they will be waiting in the “Luxe” 294, can be called through the commandant’s office.\n\nBurakova phoned, asked that Chicherin’s proposal concerning Vorovsky’s wire about the Straits be given to Vladimir Ilyich for voting.[6] [35]\n\nNovember 24, evening (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).\n\nBefore the meeting Vladimir Ilyich received Kamenev. From 6 to 7.30 Vladimir Ilyich was at the meeting of the Council of Labour and Defence.[36] The question of the composition of the commission in connection with the statement by the C.C. of Georgia was handed to Vladimir Ilyich from the Politbureau for voting.[37] Vladimir Ilyich did not vote.\n\nPassed on the voting on the Straits to be forwarded to the Politbureau. 7.30-8.30 Sklyansky, and then Krzhizhanovsky—at the flat.\n\nNovember 25, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich is unwell,[38] he stayed only five minutes in his office, dictated three letters over the phone,[39] to which he wanted inquiries made later for answers.\n\nMaria Ilyinichna [Ulyanova] said that he should not be bothered in any way—if he asked about the answers himself, then inquiries should be made in the proper quarters. No reception, no orders so far. There are two packets from Stalin and Zinoviev[40]—but this to be kept under the hat until special instructions and permission are given.\n\nNovember 25, evening.\n\nCame at 6 o’clock. Spoke on the telephone for several minutes. A. D. Tsyurupa was with him from 6.30 to 7.30. Afterwards, left immediately, asking that all Kamenev ’s papers on his desk in two folders should be sent to Tsyurupa,[41] and the articles on the Urquhart concession to Chicherin.[42] This has been done. (But part of the materials is with Nikolai Petrovich [Gorbunov] or in the files.)\n\nChicherin asked Vladimir Ilyich to be told that he would like to receive personal instructions concerning the Urquhart concession. He (Chicherin) is leaving tomorrow evening. This has to be reported first thing in the morning on Sunday. (Not yet reported.)\n\n8.30 to 8.45 telephone conversation. Gorbunov asked for all the materials concerning the trusts, questions of financing and information from Kamenev’s secretariat to be passed on to him, as Vladimir Ilyich had asked him to show them to Tsyurupa. I have already sent Tsyurupa the opinions on the trusts and the information from Kamenev—Tsyurupa has received them and asked they should be left with him for a time to study. Apparently, Nikolai Petrovich has given him some other materials.\n\nI have not shown the packets. But they are all apparently very important. Lydia Alexandrovna ought to be consulted about this.\n\nNovember 26, Sunday, morning (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).\n\nVladimir Ilyich arrived at 12, spoke on the telephone, sorted out the books, took several with him. Left at 1.30, taking V. Milyutin’s report[43] and other papers.\n\nNovember 26, Sunday, evening (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).\n\nVladimir Ilyich came at 6.50, spoke on the telephone. At 7.30 Tsyurupa arrived. At 8.30 Tsyurupa left, and so did Vladimir Ilyich.\n\nNovember 27, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich was in his office round about 12, asked for no one and shortly went away. Through Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked for all the materials on foreign trade. All sent to his flat. No orders so far, no reception. No packets either.\n\nNovember 27, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nGorbunov asked, if possible, that the paper from Zinoviev in connection with Münzenberg[44] be given to Vladimir Ilyich to sign (if received) and the materials on foreign trade to be passed on to him (Gorbunov), since Vladimir Ilyich had asked him to show them to Tsyurupa. But today Vladimir Ilyich has not given them. They are at his flat. No orders from Vladimir Ilyich. A little after 6 I gave orders to the commandant’s office to admit Kramer[45] to the flat.\n\nQuite a few packets. Among them the mail from Berlin.\n\nNovember 28, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich did not come to his office, spoke twice on the phone with Lydia Alexandrovna.[7] Asked for Sorokin’s article in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn for November 26[46] concerning 159 directives[8] –then gave orders to Lydia Alexandrovna; no orders for the evening so far. I am not leaving the packets either.\n\nNovember 28, evening (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).\n\nAt 7.45 Vladimir Ilyich asked to get hold of Avanesov[47] and ask him whether he could phone him. Phoned a second time and gave his number. I told Vladimir Ilyich that Avanesov was at a board conference of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. “Then don’t trouble, I’ll ring you in the morning.” There was a paper for Vladimir Ilyich to sign from Gorbunov to the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, copies to Bogdanov[48] and Fomin[49] on the question of the All-Russia C.E.C. revising the decision to transfer the creosoting works from the Supreme Economic Council to the People’s Commissariat for Railways.[50] Vladimir Ilyich signed it (at his flat and passed it on to the Secretariat).\n\nNovember 29, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich was in his office at 12.20, sent for Stalin, who sat till 13.40. No orders for the evening. No packets either so far.\n\nNovember 29, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nNotice from the Politbureau (8812) that the question of the Union Republics will be discussed at the Politbureau tomorrow (sent not for information, but for consideration).[51]\n\nVladimir Ilyich phoned from 5.30 till 6. Asked whether the paper on the ship-repair programme had been received from Stalin. Talked for several minutes on the phone with Kamenev. Dictated over the phone his views on the ship-repair programme which he asked to be sent to Stalin and Kamenev (this has been done).[52]\n\nAsked whether a telegram had been sent to Haskell in London. The duty secretary in Chicherin’s office answered in the affirmative.[9] He will send confirmation in writing tomorrow morning. Vladimir Ilyich has been informed.\n\nAvanesov was from 7.50 to 8.55. They talked in Vladimir Ilyich’s office. Left at 9. During the talk with Avanesov inquired what date the plenum of the Central Committee was fixed for. Tomorrow this question is on the order of the day of the Politbureau (together with the agenda), and at the last plenum of the C.C. it was decided to time the plenum to the Congress of Soviets. This has been reported to Vladimir Ilyich.[53]\n\nNovember 30, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich came to his office at 1.10, phoned and asked for No. 763 of Posledniye Novosti [Latest News] for October 13. He was interested in Peshekhonov’s article there.[54] I found it and took it to his flat. Vladimir Ilyich was in his office exactly five minutes and went home at once. No orders. No packets either. Lydia Alexandrovna asked to make a note—just for information—that Haskell’s and Chicherin’s packets addressed to Vladimir Ilyich had been handed to Kamenev.\n\nNovember 30, evening (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).\n\nVladimir Ilyich came to his office at 6.45, asked what news there was and when the Politbureau meeting ended. I told Vladimir Ilyich that there were some new books. He asked to bring them to him. Returned the newspaper Posledniye Novosti for October 13.\n\nAt 7.55 Adoratsky[55] came to see Vladimir Ilyich, sat till 8.40. Vladimir Ilyich spoke on the telephone. Asked for the minutes of the Politbureau. I gave them to him. Vladimir Ilyich asked that the Politbureau minutes be put away. He asked that special care be taken of Engels’s book “Political Testament”.[56] Handed over the new books he had looked through. Vladimir Ilyich left at 9.\n\nDecember 1, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich phoned Lydia Alexandrovna at 11.20, asked to see Molotov at 12.[10]\n\nMolotov and Syrtsov[57] called, were together from 12 till 1.30. No orders for the evening so far. No packets either.\n\nDecember 1, evening (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).\n\nVladimir Ilyich arrived at 5.30, and at 5.45 Tsyurupa came.\n\nEarsman, Garden and interpreter Voitinsky came at 7 o’clock and left at 8.40. Vladimir Ilyich left at 8.45.\n\nDecember 2, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich arrived at 12.30, stayed only 10 minutes, sent for Lydia Alexandrovna. Asked her to collect the materials on the Fishing Board for his interview with Knipovich,[58] which he asked to arrange for 7 p.m. The materials are with Gorbunov, see to it that they should all be here by 6 o’clock. Orders have to be given at all posts for Knipovich to be let through, as he has no pass.\n\nThe doctor was with Vladimir Ilyich in the morning and told him that once or even twice in two months Vladimir Ilyich had to go away for several days for a rest. On Tuesday he did not permit him to preside, but would permit him on Thursday, but not for long—and after Thursday he was to go away positively for several days.\n\nGorbunov phoned and asked that Vladimir Ilyich be told at the first opportunity that Rykov had left Tiflis on December 1 by express train. Vladimir Ilyich has to be told this as he is very interested in it.\n\nVladimir Ilyich asked for Kamenev to see him at 8 p.m. (he phoned at 14.05).\n\nLydia Alexandrovna has to be reminded to find out from Vladimir Ilyich exactly what article of Kin’s[59] he spoke to Tsyurupa about, as the latter can’t find it.\n\nDecember 2, evening.\n\nFrom 6.30 in his office; from 7 to 8—Knipovich; from 8 to 9.15—Kamenev.\n\nGave English letter and asked to find out when Earsman was leaving. Inquiries made of “Luxe” commandant Kaizer, who said that Earsman would probably not be leaving today and that tomorrow he would report the exact day of his departure.[11] This, should then be reported to Vladimir Ilyich and the letter given to him.\n\nSigned the letter to Münzenberg[12] [60] with the reservation that he does not agree to the beginning of the letter which is incorrectly worded in German. Asked for a copy to be left with him (No. 8579) in the Secretariat.\n\nHe has a letter to Svidersky to be signed, we have a copy. If he signs it, it is to be forwarded to destination.[61]\n\nGorbunov has handed in press cuttings[13] ; one folder with fresh material, the other older. These are materials for Vladimir Ilyich’s speech at the Congress of Soviets, which he asked to be collected. I think Lydia Alexandrovna should be asked whether it can be handed to him on Sunday.\n\nVladimir Ilyich asked that inquiries should be made of Belenky[62] as to when (exactly) Rykov and Dzerzhinsky are arriving.[14] He is very interested in this. I have not made inquiries of Belenky.\n\nVladimir Ilyich has been told that Frumkin is preparing the material and will send it in on Monday morning or Sunday evening.[63]\n\nVladimir Ilyich asked Gorbunov several times for Mikhai lovsky’s memo on the financial question. Nadya IAlliluyeva] must have it. He asked that both memos, Mikhailovsky’s and Krasnoshchokov’s[64], should be returned to him when finished with. Left at 9.30.\n\nDecember 3, morning (entry by S. A. Flakserman).\n\nVladimir Ilyich came to his office at 2 p.m. Asked for the stenographer. Volodicheva was not at home, and Vladimir Ilyich said we shouldn’t trouble to look for her as he did not have much writing to do and would do it by hand. Reported to Vladimir Ilyich: Belenky’s information about the arrival of Rykov and Dzerzhinsky, also Kaizer’s report on when Earsman is leaving. Vladimir Ilyich asked to find out through Voitinsky of the Comintern, who knows English, when Earsman wants the memo.\n\nVladimir Ilyich stayed in his office 20 m. and left.\n\nDecember 3, Sunday evening (entry by S. A. Flakserman).\n\nVladimir Ilyich came to his office at 6 p.m.\n\nBelenky reported that according to the information received from the People’s Commissariat for Railways Rykov left Baku on December 3 and was expected at Rostov on December 5. A wire has been sent to Dzerzhinsky for checking. I did not tell Vladimir Ilyich.\n\n6.45. Vladimir Ilyich asked to tell Avanesov that he received his letter, read it and would like to talk with him first over the phone.[65] Pass message on tomorrow morning.\n\nAt 7 p.m. Vladimir Ilyich left his office.\n\nDecember 4, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich came to his office at 11 .05.

Fotieva).\n\nPhoned at 11, spoke with Fotieva about yesterday’s letter on foreign trade, asked not to give it to anybody, as he had an addition to make. Inquired whether Krzhizhanovsky was coming. Phoned again at 11.10.\n\nAt 1.10 asked to be put through to Yaroslavsky.[103] As Yaroslavsky could not be found, put off his talk or interview with him for the evening. At 2.25 sent for Fotieva, gave her a note for Avanesov to be sent to him together with the letter on foreign trade.[104] Gave orders for the letter, when returned, to be sent to Frumkin, whom he would probably receive in the evening. Was very pleased to hear of the Politbureau’s decision concerning Rozhkov, laughed and said that this was very good news.[105] Outwardly in good humour, jokes and laughs.\n\nDecember 14, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich phoned at a quarter to six. Asked about the Politbureau minutes. Said he intended to dictate. Asked to be put through to Yaroslavsky. (Yaroslavsky was with him). At 7 o’clock, the doctor. Frumkin came, but did not see Vladimir Ilyich. At a little past eight Vladimir Ilyich inquired whether he was there. Asked Lydia Alexandrovna to remind him about Frumkin tomorrow at 12, when Frumkin would be seeing Tsyurupa. Asked to find out whether all the materials concerning the foreign trade monopoly had been sent to Trotsky and handed over those he had been keeping. They have to be shown to Lydia Alexandrovna. Vladimir Ilyich’s letter concerning Bukharin’s letter has been sent to Stalin and Trotsky at Vladimir Ilyich’s request.[21] [106] The addition, as he said, he would write separately.\n\nBefore 8 told Lydia Alexandrovna that he would dictate: 1) a letter to Zinoviev concerning Rozhkov in Pskov; 2) to Kamenev concerning the Union of Socialist Republics; 3) an addition to the letter on foreign trade.\n\nRepeated round about 9 o’clock that he reserved the right to phone up to 10 o’clock. Round about 10 Maria Ilyinichna phoned and said that Vladimir Ilyich would not dictate today.\n\nDecember 15, morning (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nPhoned at 11.50. Asked for copies of yesterday’s letters. Sent for Fotieva and gave a letter he had written to Trotsky, telling Fotieva to type it herself and send it off, keeping a copy in a sealed envelope in the secret files.[107] He found it very difficult to write, asked that the original be destroyed but it is preserved in the secret file together with the copy.\n\nGave instructions about his books. Technical, medical and other books to be separated and sent back, books on agriculture to be turned over to Maria Ilyinichna, those on production propaganda, labour organisation and pedagogics to Nadezhda Konstantinovna, fiction to be kept until claimed, and publicist, political books, memoirs, etc., to be kept for him.\n\nHe also gave orders that all the minutes of the Finance Committee be turned over to him with a memo of the secretary, not too long, but neither too short, from which he could get a clear idea of the work of the Finance Committee. Not very cheerful, said he was feeling worse, had not slept that night.\n\nDecember 15, evening (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nPhoned at 8.30. Dictated (first over the telephone, then invited me over to his flat) letters to Stalin and Trotsky. To Stalin concerning his possible speech at the Congress of Soviets.[108] To Trotsky on a categorical protest against the question of foreign trade being removed from the agenda of the plenum, should that be contemplated.[109] He finished round about 9.\n\nDecember 16, morning (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nAt 11-11.45 doctors called (Kramer and Kozhevnikov[110]). Nadezhda Konstantinovna sent down the letter to the deputies which she had taken down, apparently, yesterday evening or today before the doctors came.[111] Pakaln[112] says that Vladimir Ilyich has no wish to go to Gorki, saying that the journey by aero-sleigh was tiring and you could not go down by car. Pakaln tells that every day at 9.30 a dog (Aidu) is brought to him with whom he plays and is very fond of. A telegram has arrived from Foerster[113] confirming that before addressing the congress he should have no less than 7 days complete rest. Vladimir Ilyich did not phone once and has given no orders.\n\nDecember 16, evening (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nNadezhda Konstantinovna phoned asking that Stalin be told in Vladimir Ilyich’s name that he would not address the Congress of Soviets. On being asked how Vladimir Ilyich was feeling, she said middling, he looked all right, but then it was difficult to say. She also asked, on his instructions, to phone Yarovslavsky secretly and ask him to make notes of the speeches of Bukharin and Pyatakov, and if possible others at the plenum, on the question of foreign trade.\n\nDecember 18, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).\n\nA meeting of the Central Committee plenum is on. Vladimir Ilyich is not attending, he is ill—no orders or instructions.\n\nDecember 18, evening.\n\nThe plenum is in session. Vladimir Ilyich is not attending. With the evening session the plenum is closed.[114]\n\nDecember 23 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nA little after 8 Vladimir Ilyich called me to his flat. In the course of 4 minutes he dictated. Felt bad. Doctors called.[115] Before starting to dictate, he said: “I want to dictate to you a letter to the congress. Take it down”.[116] Dictated quickly, but his sick condition was obvious. Towards the end he asked what the date was. Why was I so pale, why wasn’t I at the congress,[117] was sorry that he was taking up the time that I could have spent there. I received no more orders.\n\nDecember 24 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nNext day (December 24) between 6 and 8 Vladimir Ilyich called me in again. Warned me that what he had dictated yesterday (December 23) and today (December 24) was strictly confidential. He emphasised this again and again. Demanded that everything he was dictating should be kept in a special place under special responsibility and to be considered categorically secret. He then added another order.[118]\n\nSukhanov’s “Notes on the Revolution”, Volumes III and IV, were taken for Vladimir Ilyich.\n\nDecember 29.\n\nThrough Nadezhda Konstantinovna Vladimir Ilyich asked that lists of the new books be made up. The doctors have allowed him to read. Vladimir Ilyich is reading Sukhanov’s “Notes on the Revolution” (Volumes III and IV). Vladimir Ilyich is not interested in fiction. He asked that the lists be made up by sections.\n\nJanuary 5, 1923.\n\nVladimir Ilyich asked for lists of new books as from January 3 and Titlinov’s book “The New Church”.[119]\n\nJanuary 17 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich called me in for half an hour between 6 and 7. He read and made corrections to his notes on Sukhanov’s book on the revolution. In the course of 10-15 minutes dictated a continuation on the same subject[120]\n\nWas pleased with the new stand that made it easier for him to read books and his own manuscripts.\n\nWhen dictating the sentence “Our Sukhanovs...” he paused at the words “... never even dream ...” and while pondering the continuation, jokingly remarked: “What a memory! I have completely forgotten what I was going to say! Dash it! Extraordinary forgetfulness!” He asked me to type the notes at once and give them to him.\n\nWatching him during dictation for several days running I noticed that he did not like to be interrupted in the middle of a sentence, as he lost the thread of his thoughts.\n\nJanuary 18 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich did not send for me.\n\nJanuary 19 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for me round about 7 and a little after 8. Dictated his second variant about the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (“How We Should Reorganise the W.P.I.”[121]) for about 30 minutes. Said he wished to get it finished as quickly as possible.\n\nJanuary 20.\n\nVladimir Ilyich called me in today between 12 and 1 o’clock. Read his article “How We Should Reorganise the W.P.I.” Made amendments and additions to it.\n\nSaid that Nadezhda Konstantinovna would give him information relating to one part of his article, and asked Lydia Alexandrovna to find out the same thing: what and how many bodies there were dealing with the scientific organisation of labour, how many congresses had been held on the subject and what groups had been represented at them. Was there any material in Petrograd? (Khloplyankin[122] had sent the same material as Nadezhda Konstantinovna had, a little more detailed.)\n\nAsked for a full list of books.[123] I was with him for about 30 minutes.\n\nJanuary 21 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich did not send for me.\n\nJanuary 22 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich called me in for 25 minutes (from 12 to 12.25). Made corrections in the 2nd variant of the W.P.I. article. Finally chose this variant. As his time was limited he was in a great hurry. Asked me to put the article in order, retype it and give it to him by the evening. Nadezhda Konstantinovna, when letting me in, said he had stolen several minutes to look through the article. Nadezhda Konstantinovna told me that the nurse (on duty) had not wanted to let me in to him. After I had left, Nadezhda Konstantinovna came into the secretariat to tell me Vladimir Ilyich’s request “to leave a space in the places, if any, which I had not managed to take down”. She said that Vladimir Ilyich, being in a hurry, imagined that I had difficulty in following him. I asked him to be told that I had taken it all down, and if I had any doubts I would do as he had asked.\n\nJanuary 23 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for me between 12 and 1 o’clock. Once more glanced through the article mentioned above and made slight changes. Asked me to insert them in his copy and ours and give one to Maria Ilyinichna for Pravda. Article corrected and handed to Maria Ilyinichna before 3 o’clock. He asked whether Lydia Alexandrovna had come back and whether our holidays were over?\n\nJanuary 30 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nOn January 24 Vladimir Ilyich sent for Fotieva and gave instructions to ask Dzerzhinsky or Stalin for the materials of the commission on the Georgian question and to make a detailed study of them. This assignment was given to Fotieva, Glyasser and Gorbunov. Object—report to Vladimir Ilyich, who wanted this for the Party congress. Apparently, he did not know the question was up at the Politbureau.[124] He said: “Just before I got ill Dzerzhinsky told me about the work of the commission and about the ‘incident’, and this had a very painful effect upon me.”\n\nOn Thursday, January 25, he asked whether the materials had been received. I answered that Dzerzhinsky would not be arriving until Saturday. Therefore I had not yet been able to ask him.\n\nOn Saturday I asked Dzerzhinsky, he said Stalin had the materials. I sent Stalin a letter, but he was out of town. Yesterday, January 29, Stalin phoned saying he could not give the materials without the Politbureau. Asked whether I had not been telling Vladimir Ilyich things he was not to be told—how was it he was posted about current affairs? For instance, his article about the W.P. I. showed that certain circumstances were known to him. I answered that I had not been telling anything and had no reason to believe he was posted about affairs. Today Vladimir Ilyich sent for me to learn the answer and said that he would fight to get the materials.\n\nOn January 26 Vladimir Ilyich gave instructions for Tsyurupa, Svidersky and Avanesov to be told that if they agree with his article, they should arrange a number of conferences and discuss by way of preparation for the congress whether or not a plan should be drawn up, a synopsis of textbooks (apparently on the normalisation of labour). Do they know the books by Kerzhentsev and Yermansky?[125] There is a plan of scientific organisation of labour, there is a normalisation department at the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection.\n\nToday he asked what answer Tsyurupa had given, whether he, Svidersky, Avanesov, and Reske[126] agreed with the article. And other members of the Board? I said I did not know this. He asked, wasn’t Tsyurupa dilly-dallying, procrastinating, was he frank with me. I said I had not had a chance to speak to him yet, I had only given him the instructions, which he said would be duly carried out.\n\nOn January 24 Vladimir Ilyich said: “First of all, about this ‘secret’ job of ours—I know that you are deceiving me.” To my assurances to the contrary, he answered: “I have my own opinion about that.”\n\nToday, January 30, Vladimir Ilyich said that yesterday, on asking whether he could address the congress on March 30, the doctor had answered in the negative, but had promised that he would be up by that time and within a month would be allowed newspapers. Reverting to the question of the Georgian commission, he said, laughingly: “That is not newspapers, so I can read it now.” Apparently not in a bad humour. No compress on his head.\n\nFebruary 1 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nToday Vladimir Ilyich sent for me (at 6.30 p.m.). I told him the Politbureau had permitted the materials to be given out.[127] He gave instructions what to pay attention to and generally how to use them.[128] Vladimir Ilyich said: “If I were at large (at first he made a slip, then repeated, laughing: if I were at large) I would easily do all this myself.” It had been estimated that their study would take 4 weeks.\n\nHe asked what the attitude of Tsyurupa and the others was towards his article. I answered, according to the directions of Tsyurupa and Svidersky, that Svidersky was fully in agreement. Tsyurupa approved it in the part referring to the enlistment of Central Committee members, and doubted whether it was possible for the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection to discharge all its present functions with a staff reduced to 300-400 people. I do not know Avanesov’s point of view. Tomorrow there is to be a meeting of the whole Board.\n\nHe asked whether the question of the article had been up before the Central Committee. I answered that I did not know this. Vladimir Ilyich was satisfied with these reports.\n\nFebruary 2 (entry by M. A: Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for me at 11.45. Dictated article “Better Fewer, But Better”[129] Finished at 12.30.\n\nAsked Lydia Alexandrovna to come every other day. When asked, “At what time”, he said that he was now a free man. Casually mentioned that the only time that was ruled out was from 2 to 5; said 6 might do, or to arrange it with his sister.\n\nI had not seen him since January 23. Outwardly, a considerable change for the better: fresh, cheerful looking. Dictates, as always, excellently: without halts, seldom at a loss for words, speaks, gesticulating, rather than dictates.[130] No compress on his head.\n\nFebruary 8 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for me at 7 o’clock for a few minutes. Asked whether we had looked through the materials. I answered that only externally and that they were less than we had expected. Asked whether this question had been up before the Politbureau. I answered that I had no right to talk about it. Asked: “Have you been forbidden to speak precisely and particularly about this?” “No, I have no right generally to talk about current business.” “So this is current business?” I realised that I had made a slip. I repeated that I had no right to talk. He said: “I heard about this business from Dzerzhinsky before I got ill. Has the commission reported to the Politbureau?” “Yes, it has. The Politbureau has endorsed its decision as far as I remember.” He said: “Well, I think you will make your report in about three weeks, and then I’ll send them a letter.” I answered: “We may not manage it in three weeks.” The doctors came (Foerster, who had just arrived, Kozhevnikov and Kramer) and I went away. Looked cheerful and buoyant, perhaps somewhat excited at Foerster’s visit—Foerster had not seen him for some time.\n\nFebruary 4 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for me today round about 6 o’clock. Asked whether I did not mind him calling me on holidays. (“You must take a rest, too, sometimes, mustn’t you?”)\n\nDictated continuation of his article “Better Fewer, But Better” for over half an hour. Looked fresh, voice cheerful. No compress. Ended with the words: “Well, that’ll do for the time being. I’m a bit tired.” Asked me to type it’ out and phone him when I had finished, as he would probably continue the article that day; said it was an old habit of his to write with the manuscript in front of him, other wise he found it difficult to write.\n\nNadezhda Konstantinovna told me that the German doctor (Foerster) had seen him, had told him a lot of pleasant things, allowed him to do gymnastic exercises and allowed him extra time for dictating articles, and that Vladimir Ilyich was very pleased.\n\nAt 8 o’clock he sent for me again. He did not dictate, however, but looked through what he had written and made amendments. When he had finished he said that before sending the article to the press he wanted to show it to Tsyurupa and perhaps some other members of his board and intended to make certain additions to these thoughts of his. Dictated more slowly than usual. Compress on his head. Face went pale. Obviously tired.\n\nFebruary 5 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nToday Vladimir Ilyich called me in at 12 o’clock. I was with him three-quarters of an hour. Dictated slowly. In one place, finding difficulty to express himself, he said: “It doesn’t go smoothly with me today somehow, not briskly” (he stressed the word). Asked for his article “How We Should Reorganise the W.P.I.” Read it for 3 or 4 minutes in silence. Then he continued a little longer and decided to stop, saying he would call me in today at 4 or 5, maybe 6 o’clock.\n\nFebruary 5, evening (entry by M. I. Glyasser).\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for Lydia Alexandrovna at 7 o’clock (ten to 7), but as she was indisposed he sent for me.\n\nAsked whether we had started sorting out the materials of the Georgian commission and by what date we planned to finish this work. I answered that we had distributed the materials and begun to read them, and as for the date, we expected to keep the deadline he had given us, that is, three weeks. He asked how we intended to read the materials. I said we had come to the conclusion that it was necessary for each of us to read everything. “Is that your unanimous decision?” “Yes.” Vladimir Ilyich began to figure out how much time was left until the congress. When I said a month and 25 days, he said that this term was probably sufficient, but if extra information was required, it might prove too little, all the more considering that it would take still longer to go to the Caucasus. He asked how much each of us was working, and said that in case of need we could use Volodicheva and Shushanika Manucharyants. Then he asked whether the decision for all to read everything had been formally adopted. I answered that we had no record of this decision in writing and asked whether he had anything against it maybe. He said that he would like us all to read everything, of course, but the tasks of our commission were very indefinite. On the one hand, he would not like to give us too much trouble, but on the other, we have to reckon with the need for widening these tasks as the work progresses. It may be necessary to obtain additional material. He asked where the materials were being kept, how we use them, whether we would make a brief summary of all the materials and whether we would have it typed (“wouldn’t it be too much trouble?”). Finally, Vladimir Ilyich decided that in the course of the next week we would decide how much time we needed and in what form we would handle these materials, and in handling them we would be guided by the necessity of drawing up a general survey of all the data on the points which the commission had mapped out as well as on those questions which he would put to us in the course of the work.\n\nThen Vladimir Ilyich ordered inquiries to be made of Popov as to how things stood with the working up of the census materials of the Central Statistical Board in Petrograd, Moscow and Kharkov (if a census in the last-named city was carried out), and by what date he intends to have them worked up and whether they would be published.[131] Vladimir Ilyich would like to see them in print before the Party congress; he considers that in view of the special importance of this census the materials ought to be published even though those of previous censuses had not been published and Popov had only sent Vladimir Ilyich the tables. Popov, therefore, had to be got moving. An official inquiry should be sent to him about this, following a preliminary talk.\n\nI was with Vladimir Ilyich altogether 20 minutes. I was seeing him for the first time since his illness. I thought he looked well and cheerful, only slightly paler than before. Speaks slowly, gesticulating with his left hand and stirring the fingers of his right. No compress on his head.\n\nFebruary 6, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich called me in between 7 and 9. I was there for about an hour and a half. First he began to read his article “Better Fewer, But Better”. The corrections, made in red ink, put Vladimir Ilyich in a good humour (not the corrections themselves, but the way they were inserted!). The article at his request had not been retyped, and the first deciphered copy had had the corrections added to it which Vladimir Ilyich had made during his reading. The corrections having been made not in proof-reader style, but in the ordinary secretarial way, Vladimir Ilyich, on second reading, found this inconvenient. He asked that the next time the whole thing should be retyped anew. Running through the article, Vladimir Ilyich made passing remarks, spoke about his old habit of writing and not dictating; that he understood now why stenographers do not satisfy him (“did not satisfy him,” he said); that he was accustomed to seeing his manuscript in front of him, stopping, pausing to think over difficult passages, passages in which he had “got stuck”, walking up and down the room, even running away to take a walk somewhere; that even now he often felt like seizing a pencil and writing or introducing corrections himself.\n\nHe recollected how he tried to dictate an article of his to Trotsky’s stenographer back in 1918, and how, when he felt himself getting “stuck”, he “plunged” on in confusion with “incredible” speed, and how this led to his having had to burn the whole manuscript, after which he sat down to write himself and wrote “The Renegade Kautsky”,[132] with which he was pleased.\n\nVladimir Ilyich talked about all this very gaily, laughing his infectious laugh. I had never seen him in such a mood. He went on dictating part of this article. Dictation lasted 15-20 minutes. He stopped the dictation himself.\n\nFebruary 7 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for me. Spoke on 3 questions.\n\n1) On the results of the census (asked to be shown the proofs of the census book. I said there would have to be Stalin’s permission for this).\n\n2) On the Georgian commission. Asked how the work was getting on, when we would finish reading, when we would get together, and so on.\n\n3) On the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. Did the Board now intend to make any decision, “to take a step of state importance” or was it putting things off until the congress. Said he was writing an article, but was not getting on with it at all, nevertheless he was thinking of revising it and giving it to Tsyurupa to read before sending it to the press. Gave instructions to ask Tsyurupa whether he was to hurry up with this article or not.\n\nToday Kozhevnikov said that there was a tremendous improvement in Vladimir Ilyich’s health. He was now moving his arm and had begun to believe himself that he would regain the use of it.\n\nFebruary 7, morning (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nI was with Vladimir Ilyich at about 12.30. Said that he would dictate on any subjects and arrange the material at some future time. Dictated on the subject of 1) how Party and administrative bodies could be merged, and 2) whether it was convenient to combine educational activities with official activities.\n\nAt the words “And the more abrupt the revolution ...” he stopped, repeated them several times, obviously struggling with them; asked me to help him, re-read the preceding pas sages, laughed and said “Here I’ve got completely stuck, I’m afraid, make a note of that—stuck on this very spot!\"\n\nTo my remark that I was his unavoidable evil for a short space of time, as he would soon be able to write himself, he said: “Oh, that won’t be so soon!” His voice sounded weary, with a hint of pain in it.\n\nFebruary 7, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich called me between 7 and 9. Was with him for about an hour and a half. Completed the sentence at which he had stopped yesterday. Said: “I shall now try to develop the next subject.” There and then asked about the subjects he had already noted previously[133] when these were read out, he remarked that one of them he had forgotten (on the correlation between the Central Board for Vocational Education and the general educational work among the people). Dictated the general part of his article “Better Fewer, But Better”. Dictated fast and freely, without difficulty, gesticulating.\n\nOn finishing, said he would try later to fit this part in with his article as a whole. Tired. In the evening I learned from Nadezhda Konstantinovna that Vladimir Ilyich would not dictate tomorrow; he intended to read.\n\nFebruary 9 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nIn the morning Vladimir Ilyich sent for me. Confirmed that he would move the question of the Workers’ and Peasant’s Inspection at the congress. As for the census, he was worried whether the tables would be printed the way they should be. Agreed to my suggestion that instructions for having this checked should be put through Kamenev or Tsyurupa. The assignment to be given to Krzhizhanovsky or Svidersky. Mood and appearance excellent. Said that Foerster was inclined to allow him to receive visitors rather than newspapers. On my remarking that this really would seem to be. the best from the medical point of view, he said very gravely after a thoughtful pause that in his opinion it would be worse precisely from the medical point of view, because printed matter could be read and done with, whereas visits evoke an exchange.\n\nFebruary 9, morning (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich called me in a little after 12. Said the retyped stuff pleased him better. Read the part of the article he had dictated yesterday, made practically no corrections. On finishing, said: “I think I’ve made a good job of it.” I had the impression that he was very pleased with that part of his article. Asked me to take down the end: “That is how I link up ...\", etc. I stayed for about an hour.\n\nFebruary 9, evening.\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for Lydia Alexandrovna. Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked her to be given the general part of the article, as Vladimir Ilyich wanted her to read it.\n\nFebruary 10 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nCalled me in a little past 6. Asked that the article “Better Fewer, But Better” be given to Tsyurupa to read, if possible within 2 days.\n\nAsked for listed books.[134] Looks tired, speaks with great difficulty, losing the thread of his thoughts and confusing words. Compress on his head.\n\nFebruary 12 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich is worse. Bad headache. Called me in for several minutes. According to Maria Ilyinichna, the doctors had upset him so much that. his lips quivered. Foerster the day before had said that he was emphatically prohibited newspapers, visitors and political information. Asked what he meant by the latter, Foerster replied: “Well, this, for example. You are interested in the census of Soviet employees.” The fact that the doctors knew about this upset Vladimir Ilyich. Apparently, furthermore, Vladimir Ilyich had the impression that it was not the doctors who gave instructions to the Central Committee, but the Central Committee that gave instructions to the doctors.\n\nTalked with me about the same 3 subjects, pleaded a headache. I said jokingly that I would treat him by suggestion and in two days he would have no more headaches.\n\nFebruary 14 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich sent for me a little after 12. No headache. Said that he was quite well. That his was a nervous illness, that sometimes he felt quite well, i.e., his head quite clear, but sometimes he felt worse. Therefore we had to hurry with his requests, as he wanted to put some things through without fail in time for the congress and hoped that he would manage it. But if we dragged it out and thus ruined the business, he would be very very annoyed. The doctors came and we had to break off.\n\nFebruary 14, evening.\n\nCalled me in again. Impediment in speech, obviously tired. Spoke again on the three points of his instructions. In special detail on the subject that agitated him most of all, namely, the Georgian question. Asked to hurry things up. Gave certain instructions.[135]\n\nMarch 5 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nVladimir Ilyich did not send for me until round about 12. Asked me to take, down two letters: one to Trotsky,[136] the other to Stalin[137] the first letter to be telephoned personally to Trotsky and the answer given to him as soon as possible. As to the second latter, he asked it to be put off, saying that he was not very good at it that day. He wasn’t feeling too good.\n\nMarch 6 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).\n\nAsked about a reply to the first letter (reply over the telephone was taken down in shorthand). Read the second letter (to Stalin) and asked it to be handed to him personally and receive the answer from his own hands. Dictated a letter to the Mdivani group.[138] Felt bad. Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked that this letter to Stalin should not be sent, and it was held up throughout the 6th. On the 7th I said I had to carry out Vladimir Ilyich’s instructions. She spoke to Kamenev, and the letter was handed to Stalin and Kamenev, and afterwards to Zinoviev when he got back from Petrograd. Stalin’s answer was received immediately on receipt of Vladimir Ilyich’s letter (the letter was handed to Stalin personally by me and his answer to Vladimir Ilyich dictated to me). The letter has not yet been handed to Vladimir Ilyich, as he has fallen ill.[139]\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Notes in the “Execution” column:\n\n* Voted. Passed on to the Politbureau.

L.A. Fotieva, Assistant Secretary of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. M.A.Volodicheva, secretaries N. S. Alliluyeva, M. I. Glyasser, and S. A. Flakserman, and Lenin’s librarian S. M. Manucharyants.\n\nThe office book for registering outgoing mail was used for the Journal. Four columns were ruled off in it: date, who was on duty, orders and instructions, and notes on execution. The title page had the inscription: “Please write in this book all orders and instructions and all happenings during duty hours with a note regarding execution of orders. 21/XI—22.”\n\n[23] Gorbunov, N. P.—Business Manager of the Council of People’s Commissars.\n\n[24] This refers to the meeting of the C.P.C. at which Lenin presided.\n\n[25] On November 21 the members of the Politbureau voted on the proposal made by the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs G. V. Chicherin that the Envoy Plenipotentiary of the R.S.F.S.R. in Italy V. V. Vorovsky be included in the delegation to the Lausanne Conference.\n\n[140] Haskell—colonel, Chief of the A.R.A.\n\n[141] Zax, B. G.—Assistant Business Manager of the C.P.C.\n\n[26] Nazaretyan, A. M.—Assistant Secretary of the C.C., R.C.P.\n\n[27] Burakova, M. N.—technical secretary of the Politbureau.\n\n[28] See present edition, Vol. 33, p. 444.\n\n[29] Twenty-one questions were dealt with at this meeting of the Politbureau, among them: the Moscow conference of the R.S.F.S.R., Poland, Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania; reduction of armaments; the trusts; a joint society for the sale of platinum; agricultural loans; and questions relating to the People’s Commissariat for Education.\n\n[30] Sklyansky, E. M.—Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic.\n\n[31] Sokolnikov, G. Y.—Deputy People’s Commissar for Finance.\n\n[32] Lenin was sent a draft resolution for the Fourth Congress of the Comintern “A Rough Draft of an Agrarian Programme of Action” drawn up by E. Varga and a note from the Comintern Executive asking for his opinion on the draft. Lenin sent his remarks on the morning of November 25.\n\n[33] For Lenin’s correspondence with Stalin on the ship-repair programme see Collected Works, Vol. 45, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 311–13.\n\n[34] Earsman, and Garden, John S.—delegates to the Fourth Congress of the Comintern from the Communist Party of Australia.\n\n[35] The members of the Politbureau voted on Chicherin’s proposal that the Soviet Government send a note to the sponsors of the Lausanne Conference concerning the participation of the Soviet delegation in the conference proceedings and of Soviet representatives in the deliberations of the Commission on the Straits.\n\n[36] At the meeting of the Council of Labour and Defence chaired by Lenin thirteen questions were examined, among them: draft regulations on the Committee for Internal Trade; report of the C.L.D. Commission on the preparation of materials for the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets; importation of grain to Turkestan to support the cotton industry.\n\n[37] The voting was on the decision of the Secretariat of the C.C., R.C.P. dated November 24 appointing a commission composed of F. E. Dzerzhinsky (chairman), D. Z. Manuilsky and V. S. Mitskevich-Kapsukas to urgently examine the statement by members of the C.C. of the Communist Party of Georgia, who had handed in their resignations on October 22, and to propose measures for establishing a durable peace in the C.C. of the Georgian Communist Party. Lenin abstained from voting.\n\n[38] That day the doctors ordered Lenin a week of complete rest.\n\n[39] Lenin dictated a letter to Stalin on the ship-re p air programme (see Collected Works, Vol. 45, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 311- 42); a letter to Trotsky (copies to Zinoviev, Bukharin, Radek, Stalin and Kamenev) about a letter to the Italian delegates to the Fourth Congress of the Comintern and about Trotsky’s theses on N.E.P. (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 314); a letter to Trotsky, Zinoviev, Bukharin and Radek criticising the “Rough Draft of an Agrarian Programme of Action” (ibid., p. 313). The same day Lenin also ordered his signature to be put to a letter of greetings to the Fourth All-Russia Congress of the Educational Workers’ Union (see present edition, Vol. 33, p. 445).\n\n[40] This apparently refers to the Comintern Executive’s letter to Lenin asking him to receive a number of delegations to the Fourth Congress of the Comintern and Stalin’s letter concerning measures for combating the illicit trade in platinum. The same day Lenin instructed Gorbunov to circulate among all members of the Politbureau a draft decision on measures for combating the illicit trade in platinum. See also the interview with Lenin by Michael Farbman, correspondent of the Observer and Manchester Guardian (present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 388–89).\n\n[41] Lenin asked his C.P.C. and C.L.D. deputy Tsyurupa to take part in the work of the Politbureau commission appointed to draw up draft regulations on the trusts. On November 27 the Politbureau included Tsyurupa in the commission.\n\n[42] Apparently this refers to the articles published in Pravda on February 2, 1923, in connection with the Soviet Government’s refusal to conclude a concession agreement with Urquhart, the English industrialist.\n\n[43] The report of V. P. Milyutin, Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Economic Council, on questions of trade, finance and industry was sent to Lenin as material for his report to the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets.\n\n[44] Münzenberg, W.—Secretary General, Foreign Committee for the Organisation of International Workers’ Aid to the famine-stricken people of Soviet Russia.\n\n[45] Kramer V. V.—professor, neuropathologist attending Lenin.\n\n[142] The supplementary card said: “Supplementary to the materials on the question of foreign trade monopoly, asked for the minutes of the meeting presided over by Lezhava and others—list of automatic telephone numbers. All taken to his fiat. Gave Lydia Alexandrovna instructions for Frumkin, Lezhava and Tsyurupa in connection with the materials on foreign trade monopoly. Talked on the phone with Frumkin, Gorbunov and others. Looked through the C.L.D. agenda.” The same day Lenin was sent the minutes of the meeting of the C.L.D. Commission on Internal Trade held on October 13.\n\n[46] M. Sorokin, “Nash promyshlenny Komsostav” (“Our Industrial Captains”) (Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, November 26, 1922). The entry wrongly gives the date as November 27.\n\n[47] Apparently Lenin was interested in the proposals and conclusions of the C.P.C. Commission on the inspection of R.S.F.S.R. trade agencies abroad. V. A. Avanesov, vice chairman of this commission, sent Lenin these materials on December 3 (see entry for December 3, evening).\n\n[48] Bogdanov, P. A.—Chairman, Supreme Economic Council.\n\n[49] Fomin, V. V.—Deputy People’s Commissar for Railways.\n\n[50] See Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 314–15.\n\n[51] At its meeting on November 30 the Politbureau heard the report of the Commission of the C.C. plenum on the “Union of Republics” and adopted the basic principles of the U.S.S.R. Constitution.\n\n[52] See Collected Works. Vol. 45, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 312-13.\n\n[53] On November 30 the Politbureau endorsed the decision of the C.C.’s Orgbureau of November 20 to convene the plenum of the C.C. on December 15.\n\n[54] This refers to the article “A Talk with Peshekhonov”.\n\n[55] Adoratsky, V. V.—a scholar, prominent propagandist of Marxism. At Lenin’s request, prepared a volume of selected letters of K. Marx and F. Engels.\n\n[56] F. Engels, Political Testament (Unpublished Letters). Moscow, 1923. The Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism- Leninism has a copy of this book that belonged to Lenin with his note to the librarian: “Keep on the shelf. 30/XI. 1922. Lenin” (see Biblioteka Lenina v Kremle [Lenin’s Library in the Kremlin], Moscow, 1961, p. 56).\n\n[57] Syrtsov, S. I.—member of the staff of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)\n\n[58] Knipovich, N. M.—professor, head of the Azov Expedition, whose main object was to make a general survey of the Azov Black Sea Basin for fish industry revival.\n\n[59] Apparently Lenin is referring to the article by F. Kin (Frumkin) “Specialists (An Essay at Statistical Survey)” published September 3, 1922 in Pravda No. 197.\n\n[60] See present edition, Vol. 35, pp. 559–60.\n\n[61] The letter to A. I. Svidersky, Member of the Board of the People’s Commissariat of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, was signed by Lenin on December 5.\n\n[62] Belenky, A. Y. —member of the staff of the State Political Administration (G.P.U.).\n\n[63] On Lenin’s instructions M. I. Frumkin, Deputy People’s Commissar for Trade and Industry, drew up a report “Brief Materials on the State of Foreign Trade”, which he sent in on December 4.\n\n[64] This refers to A. G. Mikhailovsky’s memorandum on the country’s financial and economic position and the theses by A. M. Krasnoshchokov, Deputy People’s Commissar for Finance, on the financing of industry.\n\n[65] V. A. Avanesov had sent the findings of the C.P.C. Commission on the State Monopoly of Foreign Trade. Lenin read them carefully, made corrections, marginal notes and marks\n\n[66] On December 4 Gorbunov wrote in the book of orders: “Be posted on Kyshtym Works affair, prepare basic figures concerning the financing of the metallurgical industry, ditto the Donbas and Azneft, study the system of working up census data” (apparently the census of Soviet employees in Moscow and Petrograd, carried out in October-November 1922.—Ed.) (see Istoricheski Archiv, 1961, No. 5, p. 61).\n\nOn returning to his office Lenin dictated a letter to I. I. Khodorovsky asking for information concerning patronage by urban cells of the R.C.P. over village cells and vice versa (see Collected’ Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 315–16). Lenin intended to mention this in his report to the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets (see present edition, Vol. 36, p. 589). He dealt with this in his article “Pages From a Diary” (see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 465–66).\n\n[67] A. L. Kolegayev visited Lenin in connection with fulfilment of the decision of the C.P.C. of November 16, 1922, on the question of subsidies to state theatres.\n\n[68] Zhukov, I. P.—a power engineer.\n\n[69] See Vol. 33 of this edition, p. 446, and Vol. 54 of the Fifth Russian Edition, p. 316.\n\n[70] Holtzmann, A. Z.—Chief of Central Electricity Board of the Supreme Economic Council. Lavrentyev, P. F.—his deputy.\n\n[71] G. Reyes. Nuevas y viejas rutas. Buenos Aires, 1922 (New and Old Ways). The book was sent to Lenin from the Secretariat of the Comintern Executive, and returned on December 7 for translation (see Biblioteka Lenina v Kremle [Lenin’s Library in the Kremlin] Moscow, 1961, p. 665).\n\n[72] See present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 447–51.\n\n[73] The list contains the following members of the delegation: J. Hans, Chairman of the Trade Unions Association of Czechoslovakia, Hamosta, Chairman of the Municipal Workers Trade Union, Frank, member of the Building Workers Trade Union, Richter, member of the Transport Workers Trade Union, Chapera, representative of the Gas and Electrical Industry Workers Trade Union. The delegation conveyed to Lenin greetings from the Czechoslovak workers.\n\n[74] Popov, P. I.—Superintendent of the Central Statistical Board.\n\n[75] Antselovich, N. M.—an official of the All-Russian Central Council of Trade unions.\n\n[76] L. A. Fotieva sent letters to member of the Board of the People’s Commissariat for Education V. N. Yakovleva and to L. B. Kamenev on the question of providing the pupils and teachers of all the schools with bread, and the following letter to Lenin’s deputies: “To Kamenev and Tsyurupa. Vladimir Ilyich requests you by Monday (December 9.—Ed.) to look through all the materials on the ‘Vishnevsky-Popov’ question in order to arrange a conference on Monday with Vladimir Ilyich and Rykov to decide our policy in regard to the Central Statistical Board.”\n\n[77] Eiduk, A. V.—chairman of the Commission on Agricultural and Industrial Immigration. Dovgalevsky, V. S.—People’s Commissar for Post and Telegraph.\n\n[78] Lenin wanted to see Board Member N. L. Meshcheryakov of the People’s Commissariat for Education about a flat for Professor N. I. Averbach, the eye specialist.\n\n[79] See present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 452–53.\n\n[80] Eighteen questions were examined at the meeting of the Politbureau: the Note on the Straits, the proceedings of the Moscow conference on disarmament, the report of the State Supplies Commission, grain exports, agricultural loans, the wage fund for December 1922, the reports at the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, the question of N. A. Rozhkov, member of the C.C. of the Menshevik party, and other questions.\n\n[81] Fotieva sent the following note to A. M. Nazaretyan: “Vladimir Ilyich suggests that Unschlicht’s four proposals on the question of issuing credentials to deportees should be adopted.” I. S. Unschlicht, Deputy Chairman of the G.P.U., proposed that the People’s Commissariats should be prohibited from issuing credentials to persons subject to administrative deportation.\n\n[82] Lenin asked Yakovleva to keep him informed about the work of the commission appointed on his motion by the Politbureau in the morning of December 7 to prepare the calculations for fully providing the pupils and teachers of all the schools with bread (see p. 429 of this volume).\n\n[83] Before leaving for Gorki, Lenin also left written orders to Gorbunov and Fotieva on the manner in which he was to be informed of any documents coming in from the C.C. of the R.C.P.(B.) (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 318). Lenin instructed his secretaries to send Tsyurupa and Rykov his proposals of December 4 concerning distribution of functions among the deputy chairmen of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. (see pp. 428–29 of this volume).\n\n[84] The minutes of the Politbureau meeting on December 7 were sent to Lenin after his talk with Fotieva, who informed him of the decisions the Politbureau had adopted after his departure.\n\n[85] Lenin dictated to Volodicheva a letter to Stalin protesting against the decision of the Politbureau concerning Rozhkov and pro posing that this question be referred to the plenum of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.). The letter also dealt with the work of S. A. Lozovsky in the Profintern (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 320–21).\n\n[86] The telegram referred to asked permission for the Soviet delegation at the Lausanne Conference to declare that the Soviet Government agreed to a conference of Black Sea states on the question of ensuring safety of navigation in the Black Sea.\n\n[87] See present edition, Vol. 33, p. 454.\n\n[88] See pp. 429–30 of this volume.\n\n[89] The C.C., R.C.P.(B.) plenum, scheduled for December 15, was put off to December 17.\n\n[90] This evidently refers to Lenin’s proposals concerning the distribution of functions among the deputy chairmen of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. (see pp. 430–32 of this volume) and his letter concerning the routine work of the deputies and chairman of the C.P.C. (ibid., pp. 430–32).\n\n[91] This refers to Lenin’s letter to Lazzari (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 322–23). Boris Souvarine—delegate to the Fourth Congress of the Comintern; Lenin, in this instance, used his services as a translator.\n\n[92] See Vol. 33 of this edition, pp. 335–43.\n\n[93] The voting was on the Politbureau’s decision (on the telegram of December 7) concerning the sentence in the trial of the Socialist-Revolutionaries in Baku. Lenin voted “for”. The Politbureau decided on December 14 not to object.\n\n[94] Frumkin’s comments on the theses of the C.P.C. Commission concerning the inspection of R.S. F.S.R. trade agencies abroad were received on December 11 and reported to Lenin on December 13.\n\n[95] The mail registration book had down Lenin’s letter to Frumkin under No. 8605. Under No. 8606 were instructions to Gorbunov to prepare for Lenin by Tuesday (December 12) the proofs of the book Na Novikh Putyakh. Itogi novoi ekonomicheskoi politiki 1921-1922. Trudi pod redaktsiei komissii STO (On a New Path. Results of the New Economic Policy for 1921-1922. Papers edited by the C.L.D. Commission). Moscow, C.L.D. Publishing House, 1923 (Instalment II, Finances, Instalment III, Industry).\n\n[96] Dzerzhinsky informed Lenin of the results of the Politbureau Commission’s trip to Georgia to investigate the conflict between the Transcaucasian Committee and the Mdivani group. Lenin recalled this talk on January 24, 1923 (see p. 484 of this volume).\n\n[97] Stomonyakov, B. S.—Trade Representative of the R.S.F.S.R. in Germany.\n\n[98] See Note 492 in this volume.\n\n[99] In this letter Lenin once more protested against the Politbureau’s decision of December 7 by which the Menshevik Rozhkov was allowed to live in Moscow. ^^See also Note 584 in this volume.^^\n\n[100] Lenin stated in his letters that he was unable to attend the forthcoming plenum of the C.C. He expressed his views on how his stand on the question of the foreign trade monopoly should be defended at the plenum and emphasised that vacillation on this question was inadmissible.\n\n[101] ^^See pp. 432–33 of this volume.^^\n\n[102] ^^See present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 455–59.^^\n\n[103] Yaroslavsky, Y. M.—Chairman of the C.P.C. Commission on the inspection of all R.S.F.S.R. trade agencies abroad.\n\n[104] Lenin asked Avanesov to read his letter to the plenum of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on the question of the foreign trade monopoly and send his suggestions (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 325).\n\n[105] On December 14, the Politbureau revoked its decision of December 7 and resolved to banish Rozhkov to Pskov, warning him that at his first anti-Soviet act he would be sent out of the country.\n\n[106] This refers to Lenin’s letter to the plenum of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), concerning the monopoly of foreign trade (see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 455–59).\n\n[107] In this letter Lenin expressed the hope that the plenum would adopt a decision confirming the unalterable principle of the foreign trade monopoly, since some of those who had voted against the monopoly at the October plenum had adopted a correct stand (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 325–26).\n\n[108] See present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 460–61.\n\n[109] In his letter Lenin stressed the need for having the question of the foreign trade monopoly discussed at the plenum of the C.C. and having it raised at the next congress of the Party (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 325–26).\n\n[110] On the night of December 16 Lenin’s health took a sharp turn for the worse. Paralysis of the right arm and right leg set in. Then he began gradually to recover the use of his arm and leg.\n\nKozhevnikov, A. M.—Neuropathologist in attendance on Lenin.\n\n[111] In this letter Lenin expressed his views on the distribution of duties among the deputy chairmen of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D., and on the need for making brief notes during the reception of visitors; he also suggested that a meeting of deputies be held without him on the question of the Central Statistical Board (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 327).\n\n[112] Pakaln, P. P.—chief of Lenin’s bodyguard at Gorki.\n\n[113] Foerster 0. R.—German neuropathologist, Professor; consulted the physicians attending Lenin.\n\n[114] The plenum of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) held on December 18, support ed Lenin’s proposals and confirmed the unalterable principle of foreign trade monopoly. The plenum adopted a special decision for him to be informed, by arrangement with his doctors, of the plenum’s resolution and report.\n\n[115] On the night of December 23 paralysis of the right arm and right leg set in.\n\n[116] Lenin dictated his Letter to the Congress of the Party on December 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 1922 and January 4, 1923 (see present edition, Vol. 36, pp. 593-97, 603-04). The letter dictated on December 23 was forwarded to Stalin by the secretariat the same day.\n\n[117] At this time the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets was being held (from December 23 to 27, 1922).\n\n[118] “All the articles and documents,” Volodicheva wrote rater, in 1929, “which Lenin dictated between December 1922 (the 20th) and the beginning of March 1923 were typed at his request in five copies, one of which he asked to leave for him, three copies to be given to Nadezhda Konstantinovna, and one to his secretariat (strictly secret). The copy to be sent to Pravda retyped fair with all his final corrections and changes was looked through by Lenin, after which it was passed on to Maria Ilyinichna. The three copies that Nadezhda Konstantinovna had received were also corrected. The rough copies were burnt by me. He asked that the sealed envelopes in which the copies of the documents were kept should be marked to the effect that they could only be opened by V. I. Lenin, and after his death by Nadezhda Konstantinovna. I did not write the words ‘and after his death’ on the envelopes. Lenin’s copies were kept in a file and corded for more convenient use.”\n\n[119] B. V. Titlinov, Novaya Tserkov (The New Church), Petrograd, Moscow, 1923. After the corresponding entry in the “Books Issued Journal”, librarian Manucharyants wrote the following note: “In January Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked for literature for Vladimir Ilyich on the co-operatives. Khinchuk sent the following: 1) Meshcheryakov. Co-operation and Socialism. 2) Chayanov, Basic Ideas and Forms of Organisation of Peasant Co-operation. 3) Tugan-Baranovsky, The Social Foundations of Co-operation. 4) Prokopovich, The Co-operative Movement in Russia, Its Theory and Practice.” and some other books.\n\n[120] This refers to Lenin’s article “Our Revolution (Apropos of N. Sukhanov’s Notes)” (see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 476–79).\n\n[121] See present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 481–86. First variant—pp. 433–40 of this volume.\n\n[122] Khloplyankin M. I.—Board member of the People’s Commissariat for Labour.\n\n[123] The next day (January 21) Volodicheva asked for the following magazines to be sent to Lenin: Sotsialisticheski Vestnik No. 1, Sovremenniye Zapiski, v. XIII and Zarya Nos. 9-10.\n\n[124] The report of the Dzerzhinsky commission was discussed at a meeting of the Politbureau on January 25, 1923. The commission’s proposals were endorsed.\n\n[125] Lenin is referring to the books: P. M. Kerzhentsev. Printsipi Organizatsii (Principles of Organisation), Petrograd, 1922; 0. A. Yermansky. Nauchnaya Organizatsia Truda i Systema Taylora (The Scientific Organisation of Labour and the Taylor System), Moscow, 1922. These books are mentioned in Lenin’s article “Better Fewer, But Better” (see Vol. 33 of this edition, pp. 487–502). On Yermansky’s book see also Lenin’s. unfinished review “A Fly in the Ointment” (present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 368–69).\n\n[126] Reske, N. A.—Board member of the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection.\n\n[127] On February 1 the Politbureau allowed the materials of the Dzerzhinsky Commission on the Georgian question to be given out.\n\n[128] Fotieva wrote down the following instructions of Lenin: “1) Why was the old C.C. of the C.P. of Georgia accused of deviationism. 2) What breach of Party discipline were they blamed for. 3) Why the Transcaucasian Committee is accused of suppressing the C.C. of the C.P. of Georgia. 4) The physical means o suppression (‘biomechanics’). 5) The line of the C.C. (of the R.C.P.(B.)— Ed.) in Vladimir Ilyich’s absence and in his presence. 6) Attitude of the Commission. Did it examine only the accusations against the C.C. of the C.P. of Georgia or also against the Transcaucasian Committee? Did it examine the ’biomechanics’ incident? 7) The present situation (the election campaign, the Mensheviks, suppression, national discord)” (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U.).\n\n[129] See present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 487–502.\n\n[130] On February 2, through Krupskaya, Lenin asked for the following books to be obtained for him from M. P. Pavlovich: A. Y. Khodorov. Mirovoi imperializm i Kitai (Opit Polit.-ekonom. issledovaniya) (World Imperialism and China. An Essay at Politico-Economic Research). Shanghai, 1922, and M. P. Pavlovich. Sovietskaya Rossia i imperialisticheskaya Yaponia (Soviet Russia and Imperialist Japan). These books were delivered to Lenin in the evening together with A. M. Khinchuk’s book Tsentrosoyuz v usloviakh novoi ekonomicheskoi politiki (Centrosoyuz Under the New Economic Policy), Moscow, 1922.\n\n[131] This refers to the census of Soviet employees carried out in Moscow and Petrograd in October-November 1922.\n\n[132] This refers to Lenin’s “The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky”.\n\n[133] Apparently, on December 27 or 28 Lenin dictated his note on the subjects of his future work:\n\n“Memo:\n\n“The letter about increasing the number of Central Committee members omits mention of the ratio of the members of the enlarged Central Committee to the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection.\n\n“Subjects to be dealt with:\n\n“1. Centrosoyuz and its significance in the light of the NEP.\n\n“2. Correlation between Chief Board for Vocational Education and general educational work among the people.\n\n“3. The national question and internationalism (in the light of the recent conflict in the Georgian party).\n\n“4. The new book of public education statistics published in 1922.”\n\n[134] Lenin asked, among others, for the following books (in Russian—Ed.): V. S. Rozhitsin. Modern Science and Marxism. Kharkov, 1922; S. Y. Semkovsky. Marxism as a Teaching Subject. Report at the All-Ukraine Pedagogical Conference (July 1922). Kharkov, 1922; M. Alsky. Our Finances During the Civil War and NEP. Moscow, 1923; S. N. Faulkner. Turning-Point in the Crisis of World Industry. Moscow, 1922; G. Tsiperovich. By Ourselves! (Results of 5 Years of Economic Development). Petrograd, 1922; L. Axelrod (Orthodox). Against Idealism. A Criticism of Certain Idealistic Trends in Philosophical Thought. Collection of Articles. Moscow-Petrograd, 1922; Arthur Drews, Die Christusmythe. Moscow, 1923; P. G. Kurlov. The End of Russian Tsarism. Reminiscences of an ex-commander of the gendarmery. Moscow-Petrograd, 1920; S. I. Kanatchikov. Topics of the Day (Pages of Proletarian Ideology). Petrograd, 1923; I. A. Modzalevsky. Proletarian Mythmaking (On Ideological Deviations in Modern Proletarian Poetry). Semipalatinsk, 1922.\n\n[135] Fotieva wrote down the following: “Vladimir Ilyich’s instructions that a hint be given to Soltz (A. A. Soltz, member of the presidium of the Central Control Commission, R.C.P.(B.)—Ed.) that he (Lenin) was on the side of the injured party. Some one or other of the injured party was to be given to understand he was on their side.\n\n“3 moments: 1. One should not fight. 2. Concessions should be made. 3. One cannot compare a large state with a small one.\n\n“Did Stalin know? Why didn’t he react?\n\n“The name ‘deviationist’ for a deviation towards chauvinism and Menshevism proves the same deviation with the dominant-national chauvinists.\n\n“Collect printed matter for Vladimir Ilyich.\"\n\nBetween February 15 and March 4 no entries were made in the Journal.\n\n[136] Lenin asked Trotsky to uphold the “Georgian case” at the plenum of the C.C. Trotsky, pleading illness, said he could not take upon himself such an obligation (see Collected Works, Vol. 54. Fifth Russian Edition, p. 329).\n\n[137] This refers to Lenin’s letter to Stalin, copies of which were sent to Kamenev and Zinoviev (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 329–30).\n\n[138] Lenin stated in this letter that he was preparing a memorandum and speech on the Georgian question (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 330).\n\n[139] At this point the entries break off."
