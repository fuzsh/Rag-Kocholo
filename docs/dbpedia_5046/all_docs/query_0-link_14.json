        "text": "9\n\nSecond Climax: The Twenty-second Party Congress\n\nBehind these starts, stops and postponements lies a power struggle that comes to light from time to time in flashes of disclosures such as the Kremlin showdown in 1957 and the Albanian schism of 1961.\n\nIt is at such times that policy differences become embodied in names—Molotov, Malenkov, Zhukov, Khrushchev—and the pretense of complete unity is temporarily dropped. Even when the disclosures cast light on the nature of the men and policies involved in the struggle, there is always the nagging puzzle of what really happened and what the defeated men stood for, since in Soviet politics the victor writes the record without challenge or contradiction, and this record is often obscure.\n\nIn this continuing power struggle every clue is of value to the analyst and observer; and the Congress documents and Congress proceedings are among the most valuable of our clues.*\n\nOne might logically have expected the crisis in Berlin to fade away after Khrushchev’s private assurance to Kennedy that “the storm in Berlin is over.” Yet a full month after that message had been relayed to the President, Soviet and American tanks were being drawn up in hostile confrontation in the beleaguered city, ready for a military showdown. At the same time, the shattering roar of the most mammoth nuclear explosions yet unleashed on earth was providing sobering evidence of the power of the Soviet armed forces and of the willingness of the Soviet leadership to use that power in defiance of a nearly unanimous world public opinion.\n\nThese events formed the background of the Twenty-second Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and significantly influenced the context within which that event took place. Khrushchev’s original plans and hopes for the congress were clear: in his eyes, its major purpose was to adopt the new Party Program on which he and others had labored, a program designed to chart the course for the building of full-scale communism in the Soviet Union within a mere twenty years. The attainment of this goal—something of which Marx, Engels, and Lenin had dreamed, but which they had considered a task for the remote future—would entitle Khrushchev to recognition as their worthy successor, one of the principal architects of the new communist society.\n\nIn a manner which baffled and fascinated contemporary observers, the congress turned out quite differently. True, it did register its unanimous approval of Khrushchev’s new Party Program, but its prevailing tone was not one of enthusiasm for the bright gleam of the future but rather of rancor and indignation at the sordid past and the intractable present. The congress’s most notable speeches were not those hailing the vision of a communist society but those directed in anger against the dead Stalin and his still surviving adherents and against the stubbornly defiant Albanian communist leaders and their patrons in Peking.\n\nAs to the events in Berlin, despite the threat they carried of an immediate outbreak of all-out nuclear war, the congress simply ignored them; not a single speaker at the congress mentioned the military confrontation in Berlin, and the Soviet press preserved an uncanny silence on a subject which was making headlines elsewhere in the world. A few speakers, notably Khrushchev himself, did refer to the continuing series of Soviet nuclear tests, but only, it seemed, to serve notice that the series would continue to completion.\n\nWhat, if anything, was the connection which linked these events? Why did the congress turn its attention from its allotted task, the adoption of a new Party Program and new Party Statutes, and once again drag up the unedifying subject of the crimes of Stalin and his associates? Why did Khrushchev use the occasion to launch his first public attack on the Albanian leaders, thereby bringing out into the open his smoldering feud not only with them but with their powerful Chinese patrons? Why did the Berlin crisis reach a new climax at just this point, and why did the congress pretend that the crisis did not exist? For an answer to these questions we must study the record of the congress, taking into consideration not only what went on inside the walls of the new Palace of Congresses in the Kremlin, where the congress was held, but also those aspects of international relations which helped shape the general context within which it met. Before we consider the congress itself, however, it will be useful to take note of certain developments which occurred just as the delegates were assembling.\n\nOn the eve: Khrushchev in trouble\n\nWe have suggested (above, p. 273) that one reason why Khrushchev chose to absent himself from Moscow after Kozlov’s return from Pyongyang was the desire to avoid having to submit the Berlin problem to the Presidium at a time when he realized that he could not command a majority for his policies in that body. That Khrushchev had good reason to fear the power of his internal opponents is indicated by a series of setbacks which he encountered in the final days before the convening of the Twenty-second CPSU Congress on October 17.\n\nAs we have seen, a fundamental aim of Khrushchev’s economic policies was to bring about a reallocation of investment priorities away from heavy industry, ferrous metallurgy, and armaments, for the benefit of agriculture, the chemical industry, and consumer goods. It was therefore a sharp setback for him when a joint party-government decree on October 13 maintained that an “acute shortage of ferrous and nonferrous metals, pipes, various kinds of equipment and machinery, synthetic and other types of materials” existed in the Soviet economy, and called for measures to remedy the situation.1\n\nFurther evidence that Khrushchev was encountering difficulties appeared the following day, when an unscheduled one-day plenum of the Party Central Committee met to hear reports on the draft Party Program (by Khrushchev) and the draft Party Statutes (by Kozlov), and then adopted both, with certain changes and additions.2 The significance of this event has been analyzed by Sidney Ploss, who points out that in the entire history of the CPSU there was only one earlier instance (December 15, 1925) of a Central Committee plenum being held immediately before a party congress. The effect in 1961, Ploss points out, was to usurp the proper functions of the congress: “Originally, the Congress was supposed to examine and approve the Draft [Program]. The improvised procedure tended to subordinate the nominally supreme Congress to the Central Committee, whose formal mandate was about to expire.”3 As to the motivation behind the move, Ploss suggests that “… the neo-Stalinists Kozlov and Suslov desired to keep Khrushchev from bringing their disputes into the private meetings of delegation leaders which are sometimes held at party Congresses.”4\n\nPravda’s brief report on the plenum referred only to the discussion of the draft program and statutes, but it was revealed at the congress that the plenum had also considered questions of Soviet foreign policy. In the congress speeches of P. A. Satiukov, editor-in-chief of Pravda, and P. N. Pospelov, director of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, former Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov was reported to have sent a letter to the plenum in which the draft Party Program was stigmatized as “anti-revolutionary, pacifist, and revisionist,” and condemned for failing to “link the building of communism in the U.S.S.R. with the prospects for the revolutionary struggle of the working class in the capitalist countries and for socialist revolution on the international scale.”5\n\nConsidering the quasi-religious reverence attached to Lenin’s name in the Soviet Communist party, however, Molotov’s gravest charge was that “Lenin nowhere said anything about peaceful coexistence among states with different social regimes.”6 There was perhaps nothing surprising in the fact that Molotov, a leading member of the so-called “Antiparty Group” which had almost succeeded in its conspiratorial efforts to oust Khrushchev as first secretary in June 1957, still harbored a grudge against him and was sharply critical of his policies. What was startling was that four years after his defeat, Molotov’s views should be given a hearing in the party just on the eve of a congress which Khrushchev had expected to dominate and at which he had confidently looked forward to hearing his name extolled as that of a theorist worthy to rank with Marx, Engels, and Lenin.\n\nMichel Tatu, the well-informed and alert Moscow correspondent of Le Monde, reports that: “According to information obtained at the time, Molotov’s letter to the Central Committee meeting of October 1961 was distributed to all the delegates as a ‘congress document.’”7 This action (for which there is additional evidence) could only have been taken by someone very high up in the party hierarchy, someone who harbored deep-seated differences with Khrushchev in regard to foreign policy, someone whose views came close to those enunciated by Molotov and espoused by the Chinese communists; someone, in short, whose objective characteristics fitted only one man in the party leadership, Frol R. Kozlov.\n\nThe series of rebuffs administered to the First Secretary continued on October 16 when Pravda and Izvestiia published the approved list of slogans for the forty-fourth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution on November 7.8 Generally regarded as a reliable index to the views of the party’s ideological specialists, the anniversary slogans on this occasion manifested a sharp break with the known views of Khrushchev. The slogan for the Chinese People’s Republic (No. 15), invoked the “eternal, indestructible friendship” between the “great peoples of the U.S.S.R. and China.” Placed first in the list because of the paramount importance assigned to relations with China, it was followed by the list of Soviet allies and satellites in alphabetical order, leading off with the slogan for Albania (No. 16), which applied to that nation the ritualistic phrases certifying to the recipient’s good standing in the world communist movement: “Fraternal greetings to the working people of the People’s Republic of Albania, who are building socialism! Hail to the eternal, indestructible friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Albanian peoples!”9\n\nBy contrast, the slogan for Yugoslavia (No. 26) was dropped below Czechoslovakia (i.e., the end of the alphabetical listing of Soviet satellites and allies) and, more important, omitted the magic phrases “who are building socialism” and “eternal, indestructible friendship,” thus excluding the Yugoslav communists from the approved list of socialist nations and assigning them a place below that of their bitter rivals, the Albanians. Clearly, Khrushchev’s statement to Sulzberger on September 5—“Of course, we consider Yugoslavia a socialist nation”—had been rudely ignored by the party ideologues responsible for drawing up the anniversary slogans.\n\nAccompanying the series of pre-congress rebuffs to Khrushchev were a number of Soviet foreign policy actions characterized by a sharply intensified anti-Western coloration. To be noted here, first of all, is Zorin’s attack on Cordier’s policies in the U.N. Secretariat on October 13 (above, p. 263). Also relevant is the dusty Soviet reply of October 12 to the U.S. request for an opportunity to present its position on the Berlin crisis to Soviet readers (above, p. 239).\n\nOn the 14th Izvestiia reported that the Soviet government had sent a note to the United States charging it with harboring a “war criminal,” and requesting that the individual in question, a certain Karl Linnas, be handed over for trial. The timing of the note is revealing: Soviet authorities, according to Izvestiia, had known for over a year that Linnas was living in the United States. The decision to raise the issue at just this time can therefore be legitimately viewed as evidence of a desire to defame the United States—and obstruct any tendency towards Soviet–U.S. rapprochement—on the eve of the congress.\n\nWe would probably be justified in adding to this list of anti-Western actions the break in diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and The Netherlands which occurred on October 13 with the recall to Moscow of the Soviet ambassador to The Hague, an old-line Stalinist named Pantaleimon K. Ponomarenko. The immediate cause of Ponomarenko’s sudden withdrawal was an incident which occurred at Amsterdam airport on October 9 in which the Soviet ambassador had attempted to intervene forcibly to prevent the defection of a Soviet biochemist seeking asylum. While the precipitating incident was local and accidental in nature, however, the weighty decision to make it the occasion for an open diplomatic break points to action at the Presidium level.10\n\nKhrushchev’s strategy for the congress\n\nWhile Khrushchev’s opponents in the party leadership were flaunting their strength in the days before the congress, the First Secretary was mapping out a strategy designed to weaken their position. The problems Khrushchev faced in internal and foreign politics were extremely serious, and the strategy he devised to deal with them was correspondingly bold and risky, carrying with it as it did the danger of reopening old wounds in the party and inflicting new ones in the international communist movement.\n\nIn internal politics, Khrushchev was confronted with a challenger in the party leadership—Kozlov—who held a key position in the Secretariat, from which he could carry out damaging raids on Khrushchev’s political-territorial base (e.g., the purges in Armenia and Tadzhikistan). If Khrushchev had in reality wielded the dictatorial powers ascribed to him by many Western observers, there would of course have been no problem; at the first sign of insubordination from Kozlov his head would have rolled, figuratively if not literally. But Khrushchev could take action in a matter affecting membership in the party’s policymaking bodies only with the approval of the Presidium, and this he was unable to obtain in the face of the stubborn defense of collegiality adopted by the Presidium majority as a bar to the re-establishment of a personal dictatorship a la Stalin. As long as enough Presidium members resisted Khrushchev’s demand for stronger disciplinary powers, Kozlov’s position was secure.\n\nIt was because Kozlov enjoyed a virtually impregnable position that he was able to defy Khrushchev, not only in internal politics by his party purges but also in the field of foreign policy, where he had been taking actions directly at variance with Khrushchev’s line in order to force a showdown with the Western powers over Berlin. Unable to discipline or oust Kozlov, acutely aware of the danger of nuclear devastation which Kozlov’s actions in the field of foreign policy were incurring, Khrushchev was forced to make the best of a bad situation by mounting an attack on secondary targets, in the hope that the sheer impetus of his assault would somehow carry him through to a stronger and more solid position.\n\nTo deal with the internal problem, he would revive the anti-Stalin issue which had proved so potent a weapon in 1956 and later, joining to it a renewed attack on the Antiparty Group in order to win congress approval for more severe punitive measures directed against the group’s leaders, with the hope of creating conditions in which the disciplining of Kozlov and others of his ilk would become feasible.\n\nTo deal with the foreign policy problem, Khrushchev would attack the Albanian party leaders, who were known to hold views on international relations nearly indistinguishable from those of Kozlov. In taking this course of action, it is true, Khrushchev would be admitting publicly the existence of the estrangement between Moscow and Tirana which both sides had hitherto agreed on concealing in order to maintain the fiction of international communist unity. The risk was heightened by the strong probability that the Chinese communists would come to the support of their Albanian allies in the face of Khrushchev’s onslaught. But precipitating an open break in the international communist movement was less distasteful than the prospect of an all-out fight for power in the Communist party of the Soviet Union itself. Not since the late twenties had such an open struggle occurred, and by now the cumulative weight of a tradition which prized party unanimity, however artificial, as the highest of political goods was too strong to be defied. Nor could Khrushchev be absolutely certain of victory in a head-on clash with Kozlov. There were many in the party who shared or were at least sympathetic with Kozlov’s views, and the congress itself could not be counted on to support Khrushchev in view of Kozlov’s pre-congress factional purges. Better to accept the situation for the time being, Khrushchev must have reasoned, meanwhile seeking to improve his position by indirect means.\n\nFor his opening moves, therefore, Khrushchev would seek the Presidium’s approval for a renewal of the attack on Stalin and the Antiparty Group and for an open admission of the break with Albania. On these issues he could muster a larger show of support than on a direct confrontation with Kozlov.\n\nThat this was to be Khrushchev’s strategy at the congress could be deduced from a number of pre-congress events whose significance, it must be admitted, is easier to recognize with the advantages of hindsight than was possible for observers at the time. There were, for example, a number of signs pointing to a renewal of the attack on Stalin. Tatu notes that the Soviet television network made available its state-monopoly facilities just before the congress for a showing of a new and strongly anti-Stalinist film, “Clear Skies,” by a young Soviet director named G. N. Chukhrai.11 The anti-Stalin theme was also recognizable in an article published in the issue of the party theoretical journal, Kommunist, which was sent to the press on October 12.12 Using a historical survey of the party’s Twelfth Congress in 1923 as a convenient peg on which to hang some currently relevant comments, the article, as Ploss has pointed out, “… recalls that Lenin addressed to the 12th party Congress a letter which included criticism of Stalin’s ‘personal shortcomings’,”13 an allusion which Ploss characterizes as a “degrading” of the Stalin symbol on the eve of the party congress. Also relevant was the fact that the article emphasized the priority which a party congress enjoys over a plenum of the Central Committee, a theme which Ploss finds “all the more fascinating” in view of the directly contrary implications of the October 14 plenum of the party Central Committee.\n\nTo clinch the evidence for the immediate relevance of the Kommunist article, Grey Hodnett has pointed out that it\n\n… noted that the expansion of the Central Committee at the Twelfth Congress in 1923 had promoted “collegiality” and party “unity,” and linked Lenin’s sanction of disciplinary measures against Shliapnikov and the Workers’ Opposition faction with the steps taken more recently against the Antiparty Group. At the Twenty-second Congress a week later, the Central Committee was increased by almost one hundred full and candidate members, leaving little doubt as to the contemporary relevance of this “historical” article.14\n\nAlso dimly visible in the days before the congress were the outlines of Khrushchev’s battle plan in the field of foreign policy and international communist relations. By October 12 the Albanian communist leaders knew that they would not be invited to send a delegation to Moscow to attend the congress,15 so that the designation of their country as “building socialism” in the anniversary slogans issued four days later came too late to prevent them from drafting a sizzling letter to Moscow calling on the Central Committee which the congress would elect to “examine the situation” which had been created as the result of “the brutal anti-Marxist actions of N. Khrushchev and his group,” and “to take the necessary measures for its normalization.”16\n\nAs we shall see when we come to the congress itself, there is ample evidence that Khrushchev and his supporters in the party apparatus were able to maintain a tight grip on its operating arrangements. The exclusion of the Albanian Party of Labor from the list of visiting delegations thus serves as a reliable clue to Khrushchev’s intentions, for it indicates that his decision to launch a direct attack on them—something he would hardly have done if he had expected them to be present at the congress—had been taken by October 12 at the latest. (We have already seen that Khrushchev’s charges against the Albanians had figured in a Central Committee letter of August 24—above, p. 141).\n\nThe pre-congress deliberations of the Presidium\n\nThe crowded events of the week before the opening of the party congress, as well as the gravity of the issues facing the Soviet leadership, leave little doubt that the Presidium must have met, perhaps several times, to determine policy in a number of fields. It is also clear that top-level consultation was indispensable for the purpose of reviewing the text of the report which the First Secretary would deliver on behalf of the Central Committee on the opening day of the congress.\n\nWith the approach of the congress, party leaders from all over the Soviet Union—including, of course, the members of the Presidium—began flocking to Moscow. On October 8, for example, Moscow Radio reported a visit to the new congress building in the Kremlin by a group of Soviet leaders which included all the full members of the Presidium except Aristov (who was in Warsaw as ambassador to Poland, and who may already have been dropped from the Presidium), Podgorny (party chief in the Ukraine, who had evidently not yet left for Moscow), and Mikoyan (who was in East Germany heading a delegation to attend ceremonies marking the anniversary of the establishment of the GDR).17\n\nMikoyan returned to the Soviet capital on October 11,18 accompanied (as we noted earlier, above, p. 258) by Marshal Konev, commander-in-chief of Soviet troops in Germany, and M. G. Pervukhin, Soviet ambassador to the GDR. Since the Berlin crisis was the most important foreign policy issue confronting the party leadership, it seems probable that the arrival in Moscow of this group of high party, government, and military officials with special knowledge of conditions in Germany was related to a Presidium discussion of Soviet foreign policy in preparation for the report Khrushchev was to deliver to the congress.\n\nA meeting of the full Presidium may have taken place, therefore, as early as October 11; probably there were several sessions, which may well have continued through October 12. The convergence on that date of a number of lines (e.g., the Kommunist article degrading the Stalin image, the refusal of an invitation to the Albanians, the decision to recall Ponomarenko) points to the 12th as the date on which the Presidium wrapped up its deliberations with a series of decisions setting the main lines of Soviet policy for the opening phase of the congress.\n\nOn the whole, the balance at this stage was unfavorable to Khrushchev, and the opposition made good use of the difficulties in which he found himself to press its advantage. But Khrushchev was a past master at the game of party politics, and he managed to score a number of points in the battle with his opponents, points which he would later be able to parlay into more substantial gains.\n\nOur primary source for the decisions of the pre-congress meetings of the Presidium is Khrushchev’s Central Committee report itself, since the positions it contained, as we shall see, provide indications of being the result of an agreed compromise. On this basis we can identify a number of the basic decisions reached by the Presidium at the session or sessions which centered around October 12: (1) There would be renewed reference at the congress to Stalin’s crimes, but the image of him presented to the delegates would be balanced by reference to his positive services to the cause of communism. No decision was reached as to the punishment to be meted out to the leaders of the Antiparty Group, but it was agreed that they would be the object of renewed attack. (2) The hostile attitude of the Albanian party leaders vis-à-vis the CPSU would be openly admitted, but in a way which emphasized the desire on the Soviet side for eventual reconciliation (on Soviet terms, of course). To maintain a balance, the reproof to the Albanians for their “dogmatism” would be accompanied by criticism of the Yugoslavs for their “revisionism.” (3) The hard-liners’ demand for a military confrontation with the Western powers in Berlin was voted down, in the interests of prudence in the face of Western military power; in addition, the decision reached on September 6 to call off the campaign for the signing of a German peace treaty by the end of the year (a decision which had remained secret, thanks to the failure of the West to recognize the significance of Kozlov’s September 12 speech at Pyongyang) would now be publicly proclaimed. (4) Balancing this concession to proponents of the “soft” line on Germany (including Khrushchev), the series of Soviet nuclear tests would not only be continued throughout the duration of the congress but would culminate in the detonation of a number of superbombs in the 25- to 50-megaton range, thus partially erasing the concession Khrushchev had won on September 6 when it had been decided not to carry out the explosion of a 100-megaton superbomb but merely to test the detonating device for such a monstrosity.\n\nThe structure of the congress\n\nA great deal can be learned about the purposes the congress was intended to serve—and the way in which those purposes came to be modified as events unfolded—by studying the structure of the congress itself.\n\nThe first point to be noted is the exceptional size of the congress: nearly five thousand delegates were present, three and a half times as many as in the preceding three congresses (see Table 1). In part this expansion reflected growth in the size of the party, which was now approaching the ten million mark, having added nearly 1.5 million members since the Twenty-first Congress in 1959. The principal reason for the increase, however, was the change in ratio between the size of a given party organization and the number of delegates it was entitled to send to the congress. The effect was to make the Twenty-second Congress, far more than its predecessors, a mass phenomenon in which the struggle for power between the contending factions in the party leadership was fought out in terms of the fight for control of blocs of delegates. To a large extent, of course, the fight had already been waged in the months preceding the congress, in the form of factional purges aimed at capturing individual party organizations. In its most highly developed form this struggle was directed toward capture of the Union Republic party organizations. Despite the inroads which Kozlov had been able to make into Khrushchev’s areas of strength, however, neither of the principal opposing factions could be sure just how the balance in the party stood until the final vote for the Central Committee and other central party bodies was taken toward the end of the congress. This continuing uncertainty is the reason why the congress developed into a stubborn struggle for the support and votes of the delegates.\n\nFor just over two weeks (October 17–31) the congress delegates met in the newly built Palace of Congresses in the Kremlin. On its working days the congress held sessions in the mornings, starting usually at 10 A. M., and in the late afternoon and early evening, starting usually at 4 P. M. but on occasion as late as 5:30 P. M. The delegates put in a solid six-day week, taking a respite from the grueling and often boring round of speeches only on Sunday (October 22 and 29).\n\nThis schedule, it will be seen, provided ample opportunities for meetings of the top party leaders while the congress was in session. In addition to the two full-day Sunday intervals, meetings of the Presidium could be held, if desired, during the early morning hours or in the mid-day interval between the morning and evening sessions. It would have been possible, therefore, for the party leadership to schedule its policymaking meetings during the congress in such a way that their timing would not find reflection in the congress protocols. Interestingly enough, this was not done. The protocols provide evidence—negative, it is true, but unmistakable—of the times during which the party leadership could have met while the congress was in session. The clue is the presence or absence of Khrushchev from a given session.\n\nWe may take it as a basic principle that no meeting of the Presidium could be held without the presence of the First Secretary. When Khrushchev’s presence is indicated at a session of the congress, therefore, a meeting of the Presidium could not be taking place. Conversely, when Khrushchev’s presence at a given session is either not recorded in the protocols or—more strongly—when his absence is explicitly noted, a meeting of the Presidium could have been under way. Obviously not every indicated or inferred absence of Khrushchev must necessarily be equated with a Presidium meeting: he may have been indisposed at times, or bored, or forced to deal with other urgent business, leaving the congress to carry on its work without him. Nevertheless, the list of recorded and possible absences of Khrushchev will serve as a convenient index to the most probable times for meetings of the Presidium during the congress. Evidence from other areas must then be studied to identify specifically those times at which we can confidently postulate a meeting of the Presidium.\n\nIn what way do the protocols provide evidence of Khrushchev’s presence or absence? There is no difficulty, first of all, in identifying the sessions at which he was present. The most direct indication, of course, is provided by his appearance as speaker. Then there are the numerous occasions on which he made his presence known through interjections during the speech of another delegate (see Table 2). In addition the protocols provide still a third way of identifying Khrushchev’s presence or absence at a given session (or part of a session—on a number of occasions a session was divided by a thirty-minute break, and Khrushchev’s presence or absence was indicated separately for each half session). The clue is a recurrent regularity in the congress ritual.\n\nIn addition to the nearly five thousand delegates from the CPSU itself, the Twenty-second Congress was attended by a number of delegations representing foreign communist parties or (in a few cases) sympathetic foreign governmental or other political organizations. In all, sixty-six foreign visitors spoke at the congress, grouped into fifteen sessions.19 For each of these guest speakers there was a set, formalized ritual which was performed at the end of his speech. In the words of the protocols, this ritual usually took the following form: “[Stormy, prolonged applause. All rise.] Comrade Chou En-lai [or one of the other guest speakers] exchanges warm greetings with comrade Khrushchev and other members of the Presidium of the congress.”20\n\n(One must distinguish, incidentally, between the Presidium of the Central Committee—the party policymaking body—and the Presidium of the congress, a temporary body elected at the congress’s opening session, consisting of forty-one carefully chosen individuals representing the party, government, public bodies (such as the trade unions and the Academy of Sciences), and—for purposes of presenting a democratic image—a sprinkling of factory and collective farm workers. All the full members of the party Presidium were included in the congress Presidium, but their absence would not prevent the latter body from carrying out its largely formal functions.)21\n\nThe same ritualistic formula is repeated verbatim in the protocols for the first seven sessions at which foreign guests addressed the congress. Beginning with the eighth session, however, on the morning of October 24, the protocols introduce a significant variation by omitting any reference to Khrushchev, so that the formula reads: “[Stormy, prolonged applause. All rise.] Comrade Codovilla [or one of the other guest speakers] exchanges warm greetings with members of the Presidium of the congress.”22\n\nFor the evening session of October 24 the protocols revert to the full ritualistic formula, i.e., they indicate Khrushchev’s presence. The abbreviated formula is then employed for the sessions of the morning of October 25, both sessions on October 26, the second half of the morning session of October 28, and the evening session of the same day. (No foreign guests spoke on October 27.)\n\nMaking use of this indicator, we obtain the following table of possible times for meetings of the party Presidium, corresponding to Khrushchev’s absences, explicit or implied, from the congress:\n\nfirst half of morning session, October 24 (Tuesday)\n\nmorning session, October 25 (Wednesday)\n\nmorning and evening sessions, October 26 (Thursday)\n\nmorning session, October 27 (Friday)\n\nsecond half of morning session and evening session, October 28 (Saturday).\n\nIn addition, of course, the entire day of Sunday, October 29 (as well as the preceding Sunday) was available for Presidium consultations. This may look at first glance like a rather extensive list of possible meeting times, but there were some urgent and weighty problems to be discussed and, as we shall see, there is good reason to believe that the Presidium did in fact make use of a number of these possible meeting times.\n\nThe first two days of the congress—four sessions—were taken up by two marathon speeches by Khrushchev. On October 17 he presented the Report for the Central Committee and on the following day he introduced the new Party Program. This portion of the congress was followed by eleven sessions (morning October 19 through morning October 25) in which the top party regional officials—primarily the first secretaries of the Union Republics—mounted the rostrum (see Table 3).\n\nBeginning with the evening session of October 25 and continuing through the evening session of the 28th, seven governmental officials of ministerial rank addressed the congress, beginning with Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and concluding with Marshal F. I. Golikov, head of the Central Committee’s and Ministry of Defense’s Main Political Administration, the body charged with political indoctrination of the Soviet armed forces (see Table 4).\n\nClearly, a coherent organizational plan must have underlain these symmetrical arrangements, and we are entitled to attach special significance to any violations of the symmetry. There were two exceptions: first, Mme. Furtseva, Soviet minister of culture, spoke at one of the earlier sessions (morning, October 20). In addition to being a high government official, however, Mme. Furtseva was a member of the Presidium who was reputed to enjoy a specially cordial relationship with the First Secretary. Second, Soviet defense minister Marshal Malinovsky delivered a major address during the evening session of October 23, interrupting the sequence of speeches by party regional officials, none of whom spoke at this session. There was good reason, however, as we shall see, for moving Malinovsky’s speech up to this place in the congress.\n\nAt its twentieth session on the evening of October 27, the congress listened to some “Concluding Remarks” by Khrushchev, on the discussion of the two major reports he had presented earlier, and then elected a commission to prepare a draft resolution on the Report for the Central Committee and to review changes and additions to the draft Party Program.\n\nThe second major item of internal political business on the congress agenda, the Report on the draft Party Statutes, was delivered during the first half of the morning session of October 28 by Kozlov—the first time he had addressed the congress (he had, however, presided briefly at the opening session on the morning of October 17).\n\nWith the delivery of Kozlov’s report and the completion of the discussion of the draft statutes which followed it, the congress had finished its allotted tasks and would normally have proceeded to the election of the new Central Committee and the other top party bodies. Instead, following the day-long break of Sunday, October 28, there occurred a stormy, melodramatic session on the morning of October 29 which is clearly recognizable, on purely formal grounds, as an improvisation which was hurriedly inserted into the congress schedule. Three of the speakers on this occasion (Spiridonov, Demichev, and Podgorny) had already delivered major speeches to the congress, making this the only occasion during the entire congress in which anyone except Khrushchev addressed it twice.\n\nWith this interruption out of the way, the congress returned to its regular schedule, electing the new Central Committee and Central Auditing Commission on the evening of October 30. The two concluding sessions of the congress, on October 31, were devoted to the adoption of a series of resolutions, following which Khrushchev announced the membership of the new central bodies and then delivered a brief statement bringing the congress to a close.\n\nEach session was presided over by a temporary chairman, the list of chairmen forming a pattern which points to an underlying organizational plan (see Table 5). The pattern is defective, however, suggesting that a plan was sketched out, but then modified and finally abandoned completely.\n\nThe three top party leaders—Khrushchev, Kozlov, and Suslov—were assigned the chairmanship on the first two days, followed during the next four sessions by junior members of the Presidium. After the evening session of October 20, no full member of the Presidium chaired a session until near the close of the congress, when Shvernik presided over the first half of the morning session on October 30.\n\nThe top party leaders were thus relieved of the honorary but routine job of chairmanship early in the congress. On the other hand it is undoubtedly significant that four of the Presidium members who were not asked to preside—Aristov, Mme. Furtseva, Ignatov, and Mukhitdinov—were to lose their seats on the Presidium at the end of the congress. Evidently their impending fate was known in advance to those charged with drawing up the organizational plans for the congress. The other two full Presidium members who did not chair sessions of the Congress, Kuusinen and Mikoyan, were “senior statesmen” (Kuusinen was eighty, Mikoyan sixty-six), who might well claim exemption from this onerous task.\n\nThe assignments to Demichev and Spiridonov on October 21 represent the first break in the pattern, and may be viewed as a reward for their sterling performance as speakers on October 19. Beginning with the eleventh session on the morning of October 23 a new pattern was instituted, the assignment of presidial functions to first secretaries of Union Republics. (The first two party officials who served in this capacity, Mazurov and Mzhavanadze, were also candidate members of the Presidium.) This pattern was maintained for seven sessions and then abandoned, leaving six Union Republic first secretaries still unrepresented in the list of session chairmen (Kebin, Bodiul, Zarobian, Rasulov, Ovezov, and Usubaliev).\n\nToward the end of the congress there emerged the faint outlines of still another pattern, with three men, Voronov, Grishin and Shcherbitsky, who were slated to join the Presidium as full or candidate members, assigned as chairmen. Evidently it was intended in this way to introduce them to the party and give them a taste of ceremonial administrative responsibility.\n\n* * *\n\nIn a political organization as acutely conscious of rank and protocol as the CPSU, significant omissions from the list of speakers at a congress can be just as revealing as inclusions. Two striking omissions characterize the list of speakers at the Twenty-second Congress.\n\nRanking on a level with or slightly above the fourteen Union Republic first secretaries in the party hierarchy are the first secretaries of the two most important Soviet cities and their adjoining oblasts: the city and oblast of Moscow, the capital, and those of Leningrad, the Soviet Union’s second city in size and importance. If we add the second secretaries of each of these party organizations, we obtain a list of eight of the most influential and powerful officials in the party. Six of the officials on this list duly addressed the Twenty-second Congress, the first secretaries in each case being allocated choice time spots testifying to their importance (see Table 6).\n\nNeither the first nor second secretary of the Leningrad City party committee (Leningrad gorkom), however, spoke at the congress, notwithstanding the fact that both of them—G. I. Popov, first secretary, and A. P. Boikova, second secretary—were present at the congress as delegates. Why were these important party officials passed over as speakers, at a time when the congress was given the opportunity to hear from such an obscure individual as V. I. Gaganova, a worker from Kalinin, who addressed the morning session on October 23? The answer to that question may lie in the fact that the Leningrad city party organization had been Frol Kozlov’s chief political base since the time when he was sent there by the Central Committee as a party organizer at the Kirov factory in 1949. The pointed omission of the Leningrad city party chiefs could then be interpreted as evidence of an intention to deny the floor to Kozlov’s closest party associates.\n\nConfirmation that this hypothesis has validity is provided by a second glaring omission from the list of congress speakers. In a congress whose principal function was to adopt a blueprint for building communism in the Soviet Union within the next twenty years, it must have struck many delegates as odd that the rostrum was never given to the chief of the State Planning Commission, V. N. Novikov, on whose shoulders would fall much of the detailed work involved in translating the blueprint into reality, whereas his deputy, V. Ye. Dymshits, delivered a speech in which, among other things, he heaped praise on Khrushchev for services allegedly rendered in the large-scale construction industry. Like the Leningrad city party chiefs, Novikov was a delegate to the congress; like them, however, he was a long-time close associate of Kozlov and shared with him the view that heavy industry, ferrous metallurgy, and armaments (industries in which Leningrad was a leader, incidentally) should retain their position at the head of the list of investment priorities for the Soviet economy.23\n\nIn its choice of speakers, then, the Twenty-second Congress manifested a clear factional bias against Kozlov and his supporters. As we shall see, the congress speakers’ schedule was heavily weighted on the side of Khrushchev and those who followed his lead. The two biases were aspects of a single tendency.\n\nKhrushchev’s opening speeches (October 17 and 18)\n\nFor a man who had fueled his rise to power in large part by attacking the “cult of personality” under Stalin, N. S. Khrushchev showed a marked tendency to reproduce in his own actions the pattern established by the late unlamented tyrant. Few congresses in the Stalin era were so completely dominated by one man as the Twenty-second Congress appeared to be by Khrushchev. His determination to control the congress was manifested at the very outset by his appropriation of nearly the entire first two days for the delivery of two lengthy reports.\n\nThe Report for the Central Committee (October 17)\n\nIn a speech requiring six hours for delivery, a man of Khrushchev’s restless temperament and voracious mind can cover a lot of territory. It is obviously impossible to note here all the points touched on in Khrushchev’s opening speeches to the congress; we shall limit ourselves, therefore, to those matters directly or indirectly relating to U.S.–Soviet relations and the struggle for power in the CPSU. At the same time, it is essential to understand what Khrushchev said with regard to these matters in the overall framework of his speeches rather than as unrelated fragments taken out of context. To maintain general continuity, therefore, we shall cite the “chapter headings” of the major divisions and subdivisions of the speeches, getting down to particulars only when Khrushchev makes a statement relevant to our immediate concerns.24\n\nThe preamble to Khrushchev’s Report for the Central Committee stressed the unity of the CPSU, its close links with the Soviet people, and its sense of responsibility to the international communist movement. The first major section of the speech was devoted to “The Present World Situation and the International Position of the Soviet Union.” Here Khrushchev reaffirmed the validity of the innovations in Soviet foreign policy which he had introduced at the Twentieth Party Congress in 1956:\n\nEvents have shown that our party’s course worked out at the 20th Congress was correct and true: The congress noted that the chief feature of our epoch is the emergence of socialism beyond the framework of a single country and its conversion into a world system. A new and important advance has occurred since the congress: the world socialist system is becoming the decisive factor in the development of society.\n\nThe party drew the conclusion that the collapse of colonialism is inevitable. Under the powerful blows of the national-liberation movement the colonial system has in effect caved in.\n\nThe party propounded the important thesis that wars among states are not inevitable in the present epoch, that they can be prevented. The events of the past years have confirmed this conclusion also. They have shown that the mighty forces standing guard over peace possess great means in our times for preventing the imperialists from unleashing a world war. The superiority of the forces of peace and socialism over the forces of imperialism and war has become even more sharply delineated.25\n\nFor his first subsection, Khrushchev took up:\n\n1. Further Growth of the Might of the Socialist System. Its Conversion Into the Decisive Factor of World Development; Strengthening of the International Brotherhood of Socialist Countries.\n\nAfter describing the growth of the economies of the socialist nations and their increasing interdependence, Khrushchev turned to the “subversive activities” being carried out by “the ruling circles of some imperialist powers.” Even though their sphere of domination was steadily contracting, Khrushchev said, the “imperialists” still presented a threat: “As long as the imperialist aggressors exist, we must be on guard, keep our powder dry, improve the defense of the socialist countries, their armed forces and the state security agencies. If, in the face of common sense, the imperialists dare attack the socialist countries and plunge mankind into the abyss of a world war of annihilation, this mad act of theirs would be their last act, it would be the end of the whole system of capitalism.”26\n\nKhrushchev thus reasserted the controversial view that in a new world war only capitalism, not socialism, would perish. But he immediately shifted the emphasis to “peaceful competition”: “We believe that in the competition with capitalism socialism will win [prolonged applause]. We believe that this victory will be won in peaceful competition and not by way of unleashing a war. We have stood, we stand and we will stand by the positions of peaceful competition of states with different social systems; we will do everything to strengthen world peace [prolonged applause]”.27\n\nHaving dealt with the “socialist camp,” Khrushchev next turned his attention to its competitor:\n\n2. Sharpening of Contradictions in the Countries of Capitalism. Growth of Revolutionary Struggle and Upsurge of the National Liberation Movement.\n\nThe inexorable tendency in the capitalist world, Khrushchev asserted, was “further decay.” The economy of the United States of America, he said, was characterized by feverish upswings and debilitating depressions. Automation was throwing millions of workers out of their jobs. Noting that the United States alone had spent over $220 billion in armaments over the last five years, Khrushchev asserted that militarization of the American economy, while it enriched the “branches of industry connected with arms production,” had unbalanced the economy as a whole and added to the burden of chronic unemployment.\n\nIf the U.S. economy was in serious trouble, the situation was even worse in its relations with its capitalist allies, according to Khrushchev: “First, the United States of America has lost its absolute supremacy in world capitalist production and commerce.… The result is that the United States of America today occupies approximately the same position among the capitalist countries as it did before the war.”28\n\nBritain and France, meanwhile, had grown weaker: they were in the process of losing their colonies and had proved “unable to recover their prewar position in world industrial production.”29 The spectacular economic recovery of defeated Japan and West Germany, in Khrushchev’s view, was not a factor strengthening the capitalist world or a proof of its unimpaired vitality but rather one which threatened to undermine it by arousing “contradictions”—rivalries—among the capitalist nations. Alarmed by their darkening prospects, Khrushchev said, the capitalist powers were tempted to seek a way out in aggression: “Today the United States of America, which has become the center of world reaction, takes the role of the chief aggressive nucleus. The U.S. imperialists are acting in alliance with the West German militarists and revanchists and threatening the peace and security of peoples.”30 The temptation to seek a militaristic solution, however, was rendered risky not only by the defensive might of the socialist states but also by the rising tide of the movement of anticolonialism and national liberation. Once again Khrushchev pledged Soviet support for these movements: “… from the bottom of our heart we wish success to all who are now fighting for their freedom and happiness against imperialism. We believe that it is the inalienable right of people to put an end to foreign oppression, and we shall support their just fight.”31\n\nThe reactionary program of the imperialists, Khrushchev continued, was being sharply challenged by the workers in the capitalist countries. Support for their struggle, he asserted, was the duty of the international communist movement, and to carry out this task successfully it was essential that the unity of that movement be maintained. Here Khrushchev came to grips with the first of the thorny issues which encumbered his path, Yugoslav “revisionism”:\n\nTo Marxist-Leninists it is indisputable that the vital interests of the international communist movement demand consistent and undeviating unity of action, and the Communist and Workers’ Parties observe it faithfully. Only the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, who plainly suffer from national narrow-mindedness, have turned from the straight Marxist–Leninist road onto a winding path that has landed them in the bog of revisionism.…\n\nRevisionist ideas pervade not only the theory but also the practice of the leadership of the Yugoslav League of Communists. The line they have adopted—that of development in isolation, apart from the world socialist community—is harmful and dangerous. It plays into the hands of imperialist reaction, foments nationalist tendencies and may in the long run lead to the loss of socialist gains in the country, which has broken away from the friendly and united family of builders of a new world. Our party has criticized and will continue to criticize the Yugoslav leaders’ revisionist conceptions. As internationalists, we cannot but feel concern for the destiny of the fraternal peoples of Yugoslavia, who fought selflessly against fascism and after victory chose the path of socialist construction.32\n\nNothing here recalled Khrushchev’s words to Sulzberger on September 5 affirming Yugoslavia’s right to be regarded as a “socialist” nation. Like most of the rest of the October 17 speech, this passage has the ring of an agreed committee product, representing the consensus in the Presidium rather than the views of Khrushchev personally. It is entirely consistent with the November 7 slogan for Yugoslavia issued on the eve of the congress (above, p. 288), and with the fact that the Yugoslav party, like that of Albania, had been omitted from the list of invited guests to the congress.\n\nKnowing that later in the same speech Khrushchev was to make some sharp criticisms of the Albanians, one might consider that this would have been the logical place to introduce the Albanian issue, which could then have been represented as part of a balanced condemnation of both Albanian “dogmatism” and Yugoslav “revisionism.” Instead, as we shall see, Khrushchev linked the Albanian affair with Soviet internal politics and played down its connections with the international communist movement. This would indicate that Khrushchev had won approval in the Presidium for an attack on the Albanians, but only in connection with his proposal to reopen the assault on Stalin’s “cult of personality” and the Antiparty Group.\n\nIn the third subsection of Part I of his report Khrushchev offered a reasoned defense of the policy of peaceful coexistence between the socialist and capitalist states. At the very outset he claimed that a decisive shift in the world balance of power had occurred: “… the fact that the preponderance of strength is on the side of the socialist commonwealth of peoples is extremely fortunate for all mankind.”33 This shift, he went on to explain, resulted not only from the growing military power of the socialist states but also from the emergence of the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America which, despite their “neutralist” label, “as a rule … take their stand for peace and against war.”34 Khrushchev thus confidently included the new nations on the side of the socialist states in the “struggle of the countries of socialism and all peace-loving forces against the preparations for new aggression and war” which, he said, “constitutes the main substance of world politics today.”35\n\nBut the stubborn imperialists, despite a series of setbacks, were still bent on stirring up trouble, their most recent effort in this regard being “the dangerous situation in Central Europe” resulting from their refusal to accept the Soviet proposals on Germany and West Berlin. To counter this threat, Khrushchev said,\n\n… we were forced to take steps necessary to render our country secure against encroachments by aggressors and to save mankind from the danger of a new world war. The Soviet government was forced to suspend the reduction of its armed forces planned for 1961, to increase its defense expenditures, to postpone the transfer of servicemen into the reserves and to resume tests of more powerful new weapons. These are measures that we were forced to take; they were unanimously backed by our people and were correctly understood by the peoples of other countries, who know that the Soviet Union will never be the first to take the road of war.36\n\nNote how Khrushchev repeatedly stresses the forced nature of the measures taken by the Soviet government; note, also, his avoidance of a plain statement that the Soviet government had resumed nuclear weapons tests.\n\nObviously aware that there was a serious discrepancy between the measures he had just defended and the principles of peaceful coexistence, Khrushchev continued: “Some people in the West are now claiming that the measures taken by the Soviet government to strengthen our homeland’s defenses represent a renunciation of the policy of peaceful coexistence. This, of course, is plain nonsense. The policy of peaceful coexistence derives from the very nature of our system.”37 The reason for this happy circumstance, he explained, was that the basic principles of peaceful coexistence had been included in the foundation plans of the Soviet state by its architect, Lenin: “The principles of peaceful coexistence worked out by V. I. Lenin and developed in our party’s documents remain unalterably the general course of Soviet foreign policy. The entire foreign policy of the Soviet government attests convincingly to the fidelity of the Party and of all the Soviet people to this peaceful Leninist course.”38\n\nKhrushchev thus asserted in strong terms the Leninist origins of the policy of peaceful coexistence. He was aware, of course, that there were those in the party who denied this and who asserted that Lenin had in fact said nothing about peaceful coexistence; a spokesman for party members holding these opposite views had been found in Molotov, who had expounded them in his letter to the Central Committee on the eve of the congress (above, p. 287).\n\nExplaining why he believed that war could now be averted (a view for which he neither claimed nor could have found sanction in Lenin’s writings), Khrushchev envisioned a coordinated action in defense of peace by all the peoples of the world, including those of the capitalist states: “It must be realized that whether there is to be peace on earth or whether mankind is to be plunged into the catastrophe of a new world war depends above all on the peoples themselves, on their determination and vigorous action.”39\n\nIn the fourth subsection of Part I of his speech, Khrushchev turned from the general principles of Soviet foreign policy to specifics. At the head of his list of measures, following a precedent which he had done more than anyone else to establish, Khrushchev placed “the struggle for general and complete disarmament,” which he portrayed as an exclusively Soviet initiative, opposed by the Western powers on various flimsy pretexts. With the compulsive behavior of a man probing an open wound, however, Khrushchev came back again to the subject of the Soviet resumption of nuclear testing:\n\nAs a blind, the imperialists are now hypocritically making a great to-do over the fact that we have been forced to conduct experimental explosions of nuclear weapons. But this has not kept the peoples from realizing that we have done this only because the Western powers, having deadlocked solution of the disarmament problem and the nuclear-test talks, have pulled the throttle of their war machine all the way out in an effort to achieve a preponderance of strength over the socialist countries. We got the jump on them and thereby kept the advantage with the socialist camp, which is standing guard over the peace [stormy applause]. Our measures were forced on us. It was known that the United States had been preparing for a long time to resume tests, while France had been conducting them recently.40\n\nAgain, there is the emphasis on the forced character of the Soviet military measures; now, however, Khrushchev ventures to take a further step toward candor by identifying one of the measures as the resumption of nuclear tests. Noteworthy too is the implication that by resuming nuclear testing the Soviet Union was maintaining a lead over the United States which might otherwise have been endangered, whereas in actual fact the Soviet Union’s arsenal of nuclear weapons lagged behind that of the United States.\n\nAfter disarmament, the German problem and West Berlin. Khrushchev led off this section of his speech with a brief repetition of the stereotyped Soviet arguments in favor of the signature of a peace treaty with Germany, but then veered off in a way which must have made his more perceptive listeners realize that they were witnessing the unveiling of a major shift in Soviet policy:\n\nRecently, while attending the United Nations General Assembly, Comrade Gromyko, U.S.S.R. Minister of Foreign Affairs, had talks with the Secretary of State and the President of the United States. He also had talks with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister of England. These talks left us with the impression that the Western powers were showing a certain understanding of the German problem and that they were disposed to seek a settlement of the German problem and the question of West Berlin on a mutually acceptable basis.41\n\nWhat followed was Khrushchev’s contribution to an indirect dialogue between himself and Kennedy, his reply to the President’s statement of the Western position on Berlin during his talk with Gromyko: “The Western press has been presenting the question of a German peace treaty in unreasonable and unrealistic terms. The reproach is heard, for example, that someone is trying to give an apple in return for an orchard in settling the German question. This figure of speech may perhaps please its authors, but it fails to reflect the true picture in this case.”42 The crux of the matter, Khrushchev made clear, was the contest of strength and will power between the Soviets and the Western powers which was being waged over Berlin: “We believe that the forces of socialism, all the forces that stand for peace, are today more powerful than the aggressive imperialist forces. But even if one agreed with the President of the United States that our forces are equal—he said this quite recently—it would plainly be unwise to threaten war. The fact that equality is conceded should lead to the drawing of appropriate conclusions. Nowadays it is dangerous to pursue a ‘position of strength’ policy.”43 And he added flatly: “A German peace treaty must and will be signed, with or without the Western powers.”44 Soon, however, Khrushchev was off again on the new trail of reasonable compromise at which he had hinted earlier:\n\nSome Western spokesmen say that our proposals that a German peace treaty be concluded this year are an ultimatum. But this is an erroneous contention. After all, the Soviet Union’s proposals on concluding a peace treaty and on that basis settling the question of West Berlin, turning it into a free city, were put forward as early as 1958. A good deal of time has passed since then. We have not rushed settlement of the question, hoping for the achievement of mutual understanding with the Western countries. Where, may I ask, is the ultimatum? In proposing conclusion of a German peace treaty, the Soviet government has been presenting no ultimatum but has been moved by the necessity of finally settling this compelling question.45\n\nHere at last was the word for which Western statesmen had been straining their ears: an authoritative statement, from the highest Soviet source, that the 1961 deadline on Berlin which Khrushchev himself had laid down in June (despite his disclaimer) had been lifted. To make matters crystal clear (and, incidentally, providing instant refutation of the assertion he had just made that there had been no Soviet deadline), Khrushchev added: “The question of a time limit for the signing of a German peace treaty will not be so important if the Western powers show a readiness to settle the German problem; we shall not in that case absolutely insist on signing the peace treaty before December 31, 1961. The main thing is to settle the question, to do away with the vestiges of the second world war, to sign a German peace treaty. This is basic, that is the heart of the matter.”46\n\nWhat about the Soviet demand for a three-man secretaryship in the United Nations, a demand which had aroused the most serious concern in the West over the fate of the United Nations itself? Matching the soft line currently being pursued by Zorin in his confidential negotiations with Adlai Stevenson at U.N. headquarters, Khrushchev touched on this controversial issue only briefly and with no suggestion of urgency: “The time has come to establish genuine equality in all U.N. agencies for the three groups of states that have formed in the world—the socialist, the neutralist and the imperialist. It is time to put a stop to the attempts to use this organization in the interests of the military alignment of the Western powers.”47\n\nIn the same relaxed spirit Khrushchev called for the admission of communist China to the United Nations, but deflated the importance of this mildly voiced aspiration by following it immediately with a proposal for settlement of “the German people’s representation in the United Nations,” thus placing China on the same level as defeated Germany.\n\nThe problem of “finally eliminating colonial oppression in all its forms and manifestations” rated a brief paragraph, following which Khrushchev turned to various proposals for solving “pressing regional political problems.” A single brief sentence expressing Soviet support for “setting up atom-free zones in Europe and the Far East first of all” served to imply in veiled form the highly controversial proposal, a major offense to Peking, for keeping communist China from developing its own nuclear weapons.\n\nAfter a rapid tour d’horizon of Soviet relations with the newly liberated and developing nations, Khrushchev turned to Soviet–U.S. relations. “We attach great importance,” he said, “… to relations with the principal countries of the capitalist world, above all the United States of America.”48 In striking contrast to the earlier passage of his speech which had characterized the United States as “the center of world reaction [which] takes the role of the chief aggressive nucleus,” Khrushchev now portrayed the United States as susceptible to reasonable guidance in its foreign policy: “If realism wins out in U.S. policy, one of the serious obstacles to normalization of the entire international situation will have been removed. Not only the peoples of our countries but other peoples as well, and the cause of peace the world over, stand to gain from this kind of approach.”49\n\nSoviet relations with the other major capitalist nations and with the Soviet Union’s neighbors rated a brief mention, after which Khrushchev summarized Soviet economic and cultural ties with foreign nations. His own wide and extensive travels were deprecatingly mentioned: “I too have had occasion to do quite a bit of traveling the wide world over. It can’t be helped—my position requires it, it is called for in the interest of our cause.”50 But here, as elsewhere in his speech, Khrushchev strove to link his own policies and actions with those of Lenin: “As we know, V. I. Lenin, who was directly engaged in guiding the foreign policy of the Soviet state, for all his busy schedule used to meet with figures from the United States, Britain, Finland, Afghanistan, and other countries, conducted negotiations with them and was intending to participate in person in the Genoa Conference of 1922. The Central Committee has made a point of steadfastly observing this tradition established by Lenin.”51\n\nConcluding his exposition and defense of Soviet foreign policy, Khrushchev reiterated his conviction that communism could achieve world victory without war: “Present conditions have opened up the prospect of achieving peaceful coexistence over the entire period within which the social and political problems now dividing the world must be resolved. Matters are reaching a point where even before the total victory of socialism on earth, while capitalism holds on in part of the world, there will be a real chance of eliminating war from the life of society.”52\n\nThe second major portion of Khrushchev’s report dealt with internal developments under the general heading: The Soviet Union Enters the Period of Full-scale Construction of Communism. In the preamble to this section Khrushchev set the tone for the congress as a whole: “Our great goal is drawing nearer and nearer, and the bright peak on which the Soviet people in the near future will raise the banner of communism is already distinctly visible.”53 First to be taken up were the party’s goals for the next planning period. Figures for the basic sectors of production were cited, ranging from ferrous metallurgy to consumer goods (Khrushchev devoted approximately equal time to both). From his statistical presentation of economic data, however, Khrushchev (perhaps sensing a growing restlessness on the part of his audience) switched to a portrayal of Soviet military prowess, particularly in the field of rocket development. Recent Soviet tests, he said, had shown the high degree of accuracy characterizing Soviet long-range rockets. Apparently yielding to a sudden impulse, Khrushchev at this point departed from the prepared text of his report and gleefully cited U.S. confirmation of Soviet press reports: “It should be pointed out that there are also American ships in this [testing] area, and they too are tracing the Soviet rockets in flight. The Americans have been publishing their respective data on these flights, and we have been comparing their figures with our own. Naturally, we have confidence in the comrades aboard our ships. But what we’re getting in this case is something of a double check—ours and our adversary’s.”54\n\nOne might have thought “adversaries” (protivniki) a surprisingly mild term for Khrushchev to apply to the Americans (his restraint strikingly echoes that shown by Kennedy in his inaugural address), but Khrushchev proceeded to water down still further the lingering trace of hostility the term contained: “Our adversaries—true, we wish we did not have to call them our adversaries, but the nature of imperialism must be reckoned with—confirm the fact that the Soviet rockets have been hitting the mark accurately. That’s fine! We never doubted they would.”55\n\nAnd then, well launched on the detour from the high road of his prepared text, Khrushchev jolted his listeners with a startling revelation:\n\nSince I have already wandered from my written text, I want to say that our tests of new nuclear weapons are also coming along very well. We shall shortly complete these tests—presumably at the end of October. We shall probably wind them up by detonating a hydrogen bomb with a yield of 50,000,000 tons of TNT [applause]. We have said that we have a 100-megaton bomb. This is true. But we are not going to explode it, because even if we did so at the most remote site, we might knock out all our windows [stormy applause]. We are therefore going to hold off for the time being and not set the bomb off. However, in exploding the 50-megaton bomb we are testing the device for triggering a 100-megaton bomb.56\n\nKhrushchev’s tone in making this impromptu revelation was jaunty, almost jocular, but he quickly added the fervent hope that the 100-megaton superbomb would never be needed: “But may God grant, as they used to say, that we are never called upon to explode these bombs over anybody’s territory. This is the greatest wish of our lives! [stormy applause.]”57\n\nIn the West, where Khrushchev’s words caused a sensation, it was universally assumed that his purpose in revealing Soviet plans for testing a 50-megaton H-bomb was to intimidate the Western powers in order to force them to accept Soviet demands on Germany and Berlin. This explanation does not fit the facts, however: first of all, because Khrushchev himself had just lifted the deadline on signing a peace treaty with Germany, thereby taking the pressure off the West; and second, because the statement concerning the super-bomb was introduced almost apologetically, in a context strongly suggesting an affectionate comradeship between the Soviets and the Americans. Significant too is the fact that Khrushchev’s revelation occurred in a portion of his speech which he explicitly identified as a departure from the prepared text, i.e., one which had not been sanctioned in advance by the collective leadership. (This is not to say that the plan to detonate a 50-megaton bomb did not have Presidium sanction, but that the revelation of this plan had not been included in the agreed text of the Report of the Central Committee.) Note, finally, that Khrushchev linked the preparations to test a 50-megaton bomb with the compromise plan, of which he had informed Sulzberger on September 7, to substitute the testing of the detonating device for the 100-megaton superbomb for the testing of the bomb itself. No one, of course, could accept the contention that testing a 50-megaton superbomb was the equivalent of merely testing a detonating device.\n\nThe disclosure of Soviet plans to test a 50-megaton bomb, as we shall see presently, set off a powerful reaction in the West, which found its most concentrated expression in the adoption of a series of resolutions in the U.N. General Assembly calling on the Soviet Union to desist from its plan. The reaction also included the dispatch of personal letters to Khrushchev from a number of heads of state and prominent individuals.\n\nIn the light of these considerations it must be regarded as a strong probability that Khrushchev’s real motive in disclosing plans for the 50-megaton bomb test was precisely to evoke that worldwide revulsion which did, in fact, promptly follow, in order to force the Presidium to reconsider its decision to include the 50-megaton superbomb in the current test series. As we shall see, there is evidence indicating that this is exactly what happened, with Khrushchev pleading the case for cancellation of the superbomb test.\n\nNow well launched on a digression concerning Soviet military development, Khrushchev continued with an account of the Soviet submarine fleet, which he said had the task of defending the Soviet Union against missile attacks from submarines (i.e., the Polaris missiles of the United States). In a heavily stressed statement Khrushchev assured his listeners that “… the rearming of the Soviet Army with nuclear and rocket weapons has been fully completed. Our armed forces are now in possession of weapons powerful enough to enable us to crush any aggressor.”58 The implication was that extensive additional appropriations for the armed forces would not be needed.\n\nKhrushchev brought this militaristic intrusion into his speech to an adroit end by modulating abruptly back from war to peace: “The Soviet people have no need of war. Their thinking is directed toward the development of an economy of peace, the accomplishment of the great plans for communist construction, the creation of an abundance of material and spiritual benefits for all working people.”59\n\nBack to his prepared text, Khrushchev provided his listeners with a rapid survey of the development of the Soviet economy, which we can leave to specialists in that field, with the exception of a few details bearing on the internal struggle over investment allocation priorities. For example, in giving figures for Soviet steel production, Khrushchev revealed that there existed a difference of opinion on this subject within the leadership: “There are some who suggested that steel output be boosted to 100,000,000 tons a year. But we restrained them. We said that all branches of the economy had to be developed proportionately, that along with metal output we had to remember housing construction, children’s institutions, the manufacture of footwear and clothing, etc. In this matter we must rigorously abide by the directives which were adopted by the 21st Party Congress.”60\n\nAlso of interest for our purposes were Khrushchev’s claims that the Soviet economy was rapidly overtaking that of the United States: “You recall, comrades, that even during the first five-year plans we outdid the United States in the rate of growth of industrial output, but we were considerably overshadowed with respect to its absolute increase, to say nothing of the substantial disparity in levels of production. In recent years our country, while continuing to outstrip the United States substantially in rate of growth, has also begun to leave it behind in absolute increase in the output of many major products.”61 After citing production figures from a wide range of branches of industry, Khrushchev offered the triumphant conclusion: “Completion of the seven-year plan will bring our nation to a stage where it will take little time to outdistance the United States economically. By accomplishing its basic economic task, the Soviet Union will win a world-historic victory in the peaceful competition with the United States of America.”62\n\nPrimarily of limited internal interest was the following section of Khrushchev’s report, which dealt with the administration of the Soviet economy. The emphasis here was on the need to renovate the industrial plant, eliminate inefficiency, and maximize production. Khrushchev’s criticism of hide-bound reactionaries included a swipe at L. M. Kaganovich, commissar of transportation under Stalin and a member of the Antiparty Group which had tried to oust Khrushchev in 1957—the first intimation in the report that a renewed attack on this group was imminent.\n\nFollowing industry, Khrushchev took up the problems facing Soviet agriculture, offering a review of achievements since 1956 and a preview of the tasks which lay ahead. The achievements, as Khrushchev presented them, were so many milestones marking the course of his stewardship, including strengthening of the material base of the collective and state farms; reorganization of the machine-tractor stations; and assimilation of the Virgin Lands. On the latter subject, Khrushchev dwelt at length and with pardonable pride (the lean, dry years on the risky Virgin Lands program still lay in the future).\n\nBut with all its achievements, for which he took full credit, Khrushchev was forced to admit that agriculture was still the most backward sector of the Soviet economy: “Comrades! The successes in agriculture are indisputable and substantial. But the question arises: Why do we still not have enough of some products, particularly meat? Why, despite the general substantial achievements, do we still encounter considerable difficulty in supplying the public with livestock products?”63\n\nInescapably, the answer lay in the root problem of Soviet economic planning, the question of investment priorities: “This is explained, above all, by the fact that the rate of growth of agricultural output still lags behind the rate of growth of industry and the increasing requirements of the public.”64 Unobtrusively but firmly, Khrushchev stated the principle which he wished to see embodied in the party’s approach to agriculture—a principle which by no means enjoyed the unanimous support of the party leadership: “… we must always keep agricultural problems in the center of attention and ensure such a rate of agricultural growth that output of farm products is always ahead of demand.”65\n\nThe remainder of this section of the report was devoted to a characteristically Khrushchevian survey of the state of Soviet agriculture, with praise (e.g., to the Ukrainians) or blame (e.g., to errant officials in Voronezh oblast) being passed out with a lavish hand.\n\nTreatment of the problems of Soviet agriculture was continued in the following section of the report, in which Khrushchev-the-farm-expert (probably his own favorite among the many roles he assumed) took the floor. Inevitably the Khrushchevian idée fixe came in for its share of attention:\n\nIt must be understood, comrades, that without corn the collective and state farms will not achieve the required level of grain production. Corn has shown its possibilities in all parts of the Soviet Union. If in certain areas of the country corn is introduced for form’s sake only and the collective and state farms harvest small crops, it is not the climate that is to blame but the people in charge. Where corn does not thrive, there is an “ingredient” that is not conducive to its growth. This “ingredient” is to be sought in the leadership. On what level? First and foremost, on the collective and state farms, and also at the district, province, territory, and even the republic level. Officials who have themselves withered and are letting a crop like corn wither, giving it no chance to develop for all it’s worth, must be replaced.66\n\nAfter this scarcely veiled threat to purge party officials who stubbornly persisted in underrating the potential of corn, Khrushchev went on to call for increased cotton production and to extol the merits of a wide range of other crops. And he implied united support in the party leadership for his agricultural program: “We all proceed from the premise that progress in agriculture is one of the chief requirements for the steady improvement of the people’s well-being.”67\n\nCulture was the subject of the next section of Khrushchev’s report. Of interest here was a new form of Soviet–Western competition: “The Soviet Union leads the world in the volume and rate of housing construction. In the past few years our country has been building twice as many apartments per 1000 people as the United States and France and more than twice as many as Britain and Italy.”68 What Khrushchev neglected to point out, of course, was that the Soviet Union, having suffered from an acute housing shortage for decades, had to overcome the tremendous lag in housing construction which was one of the most harmful social legacies of the Stalin era.\n\nNoteworthy also was the slogan Khrushchev provided to characterize party policy: “Our party’s policy is pervaded with the great communist idea: Everything in the name of man, for the benefit of man!”69\n\nIn the field of education Khrushchev was able to draw still another contrast between the Soviet Union and the West: “The Soviet Union is training three times as many engineers as the United States, while the total number of persons engaged in mental work in our country is more than 20,000,000!”70 Chester Bowles, a prominent State Department official in the Kennedy administration, was cited for his observation that with the launching of the first sputnik America was faced with a serious challenge to its “industrial, military and scientific superiority.”71\n\nThis part of Khrushchev’s report was brought to a conclusion with a section devoted to the problem of developing new social relationships as the basis for building communism in the USSR. Once again, Khrushchev cited the canonic authority of Lenin as the precedent for his recommendations. And once again, the dominant theme was competition between the Soviet system and that of the capitalist West, with socialism’s eventual triumph a foreordained conclusion: “We have long proposed to the capitalist world that we compete not in an arms race but in improving the working people’s lives. We are confident that capitalism cannot stand up under that kind of competition! We are confident that in the end all peoples will make the correct choice, will give their preference to the truly free world of communism and turn their backs on the so-called ‘free world’ of capitalism.”72\n\nThus far, Khrushchev had managed to avoid any really controversial subjects in the fields of internal party politics or the international communist movement, although his passing slur on Kaganovich and his strictures on Yugoslav “revisionism” gave a foretaste of what was to come. In the third major subdivision of his report, however, delivered at the evening session of October 17, Khrushchev more than made up for the blandness of its first two sections, giving his audience their first good look at some of the tensions which were wracking both the party and the movement. The heading was noncommittal: III. The Leninist Party Is the Organizer of the Struggle for the Victory of Communism.\n\nIn his preamble to this section of his report Khrushchev again stressed the Leninist bases of party policy, seeking to associate the measures carried out on his initiative with the principles laid down by Lenin. He asserted that the party had already fulfilled its first two programs (those adopted at the Second Congress in 1903 and at the Eighth Congress in 1919) by carrying through the Bolshevik Revolution and achieving “the complete and final victory of socialism in the Land of Soviets.”73 It was for the present congress, then, to adopt a new, third, program which would chart the building of communism in the USSR.\n\nThe first subsection of this part of the report, however, was focused on the past, with the heading:\n\n1. Overcoming the Consequences of the Cult of the Individual. Developing Leninist Norms of Party Life and Principles of Leadership. Increasing the Party’s Combat Readiness.\n\nIn earlier sections of his report Khrushchev had affirmed the essential correctness of the line adopted by the Twentieth Party Congress in foreign policy and relations with the international communist movement. Now he turned to the most controversial of the innovations introduced by the Twentieth Congress, its condemnation of the Stalinist “cult of personality.” The situation which had confronted the party on the eve of the 1956 congress, he asserted, was a serious one:\n\nEither the party would openly and in a Leninist manner condemn the errors and distortions committed during the period of the cult of J. V. Stalin and reject those methods of party and state leadership that had become an impediment to progress, or the forces that had chained themselves to the old and were resisting everything new and creative would gain the upper hand in the party. This is exactly how serious the problem was. Was it necessary to make such sharp and frank criticism of the major errors and the serious consequences of the cult of the individual?74\n\nAnswering his own rhetorical question, Khrushchev categorically affirmed that it “was necessary,” because investigations carried out after the arrest of “the inveterate enemy and adventurer Beriya” had disclosed “… instances of the grossest violations of socialist legality, abuses of power, instances of arbitrary action and repression against many honest people, including outstanding figures in the party and the Soviet state.”75 The exposure of these “abuses of power during the period of the cult of the individual” became an “inner moral requirement and obligation of the party and its leadership.”76\n\nAs usual, Khrushchev called on Lenin for validation and support, and this time was able to produce a highly apposite quotation from the founder of the party affirming in ringing tones the overriding necessity for the party to face up frankly to its mistakes: “To admit a mistake openly, to ascertain its causes, to analyze the situation that gave rise to it and to discuss attentively the means for correcting it—this is the sign of a serious party, this is the fulfillment of its obligations, this is the rearing and training of the class, and later of the masses.”77\n\nOut of respect, perhaps, for the sensibilities of the party functionaries who made up the greater part of his audience, Khrushchev approached his target with circumspection. Stalin was even accorded some praise at the outset: “Of course, J. V. Stalin did make great contributions to the party and the communist movement, and we give him his due.”78 But the praise was limited to this single sentence, and was followed immediately by renewed criticism: “However, it was incorrect to associate all the victories of the party and the people with the name of one man. This was a gross distortion of the true state of affairs.”79\n\nCalling on Lenin for support once again, Khrushchev adroitly shifted the responsibility for launching the criticism of Stalin from his own shoulders to those of Lenin. Lenin, he said, had “perceived Stalin’s shortcomings, even vices,” and in support he quoted Lenin’s “Testament” in which he had warned the party of the danger it faced as the result of Stalin’s character and the power he had accumulated. For nearly half a century this document, which Lenin had dictated in the winter of 1922–23 as he lay paralyzed from a stroke, had been kept secret in the Soviet Union (although it was published and known in the West since 1926). Khrushchev had quoted from it in his secret speech to the Twentieth Congress in 1956, but it had never previously been read in an open session of a party congress, and it must have come as a shock to many of the delegates, members of a generation which had been reared in the spirit of unlimited devotion to Stalin.\n\nAt the Twentieth Congress the primary target of Khrushchev’s revelations had been Stalin himself. Now, however, his main object was to describe the conflict in the party leadership which had broken out after the 1956 congress over the question of whether or not to admit Stalin’s crimes and make a clean break with the past. A powerful group in the party leadership, Khrushchev said, had bitterly opposed the attack on Stalin, and he startled his listeners by adding a new name, that of Voroshilov, to the list of members of what he called the “antiparty group.” But Voroshilov, the respected veteran of wars and revolution, was not merely a delegate to the present congress but had been elected a member of the congress Presidium at its outset!\n\nClearly, Khrushchev had some vital political aim in view. To indicate that the addition of Voroshilov’s name had been no slip, Khrushchev proceeded to identify him as one of the first who had opposed “the party’s line on condemning the cult of the individual,” along with Molotov, Kaganovich, and Malenkov, all four being motivated by the fact that: “They bear personal responsibility for many mass repressions against party, Soviet, economic, military, and Komsomol cadres and for other similar manifestations that took place during the period of the cult of the individual.”80 At first only an “insignificant minority” in the Presidium, this group had picked up strength as the party undertook such innovating measures as “… developing the Virgin Lands, reorganizing the management of industry and construction, enlarging the rights of the Union Republics, improving the well-being of Soviet people, and restoring revolutionary legality.”81 With four additional recruits—“Bulganin, Pervukhin and Saburov, and Shepilov who joined them”—the group “succeeded in throwing together an arithmetical majority in the Presidium” and “went into open attack, … seeking to change the policy in the party and the country—the policy set forth by the Twentieth Party Congress.”82\n\nThe showdown came in June 1957: “Members of the Central Committee who were then in Moscow, learning of the factional actions of the antiparty group within the Presidium, demanded the immediate calling of a Central Committee plenum.… The Central Committee plenum, held in June 1957, resolutely exposed the antiparty group and routed it ideologically.”83\n\nFaced with “unanimous condemnation” by the plenum, the members of the Antiparty Group confessed that they had conspired and admitted “the harmfulness of their antiparty activity.” Voroshilov, Khrushchev disclosed (according him the honorary appelation, “comrade”), “… came forward at the plenum with an admission of his mistakes, saying that ‘the factionalists misled’ him and that he fully recognized his errors and firmly condemned them, together with the whole subversive work of the antiparty group.”84 Only Molotov had stubbornly held out, violating the sacred principle of unanimity by refusing to vote in favor of the resolution condemning the Antiparty Group; later, however, he too “declared that he considered the plenum’s decision correct and accepted it.”85\n\nFor an explanation as to how such an event could occur in a supposedly monolithic party, Khrushchev could only offer the lame and un-Marxist proposition that personal factors are often decisive in such matters:\n\nSuch phenomena happen for various reasons: One person’s powers deteriorate; another loses touch with life, becomes conceited, does not work; a third proves an unprincipled, spineless turncoat without stanchness in the struggle for the cause of the party.… What happens is something like the phenomenon that astronomers call light from extinct stars. Some very distant stars seem to continue to shine even though they have actually been extinct for a long time. The trouble with some people who have found themselves in the position of stars on the public horizon is that they think they are continuing to radiate light although they have long since turned into dying embers. This is what happened to some political figures who fell into the path of factional antiparty struggle.86\n\nTo wrap up this section of his report, Khrushchev added a brief account of the October 1957 Central Committee plenum at which Marshal Zhukov had been ousted from his position as candidate member of the Presidium.\n\nJust as the Antiparty Group had resisted exposure of the crimes of Stalin, Khrushchev continued, so too in the international communist movement there were those who wanted to defend the “cult of personality.” “Now the Albanian leaders do not conceal the fact that they do not like the course, taken by our party, of firmly overcoming the harmful consequences of the Stalin cult, of sharply condemning the abuse of power, of restoring Leninist norms of party and state life.”87 Khrushchev had a ready answer to the question as to why the Albanians had taken this course: “This stand of the Albanian leaders is explained by the fact that they themselves, to our regret and distress, are repeating the methods that occurred in our country in the period of the cult of the individual.”88\n\nThus Khrushchev moved from the relatively mild charge that the Albanian leaders disapproved of the way the CPSU was handling its own affairs to the far graver charge that in their own country they were currently carrying out policies identical with those which he had just condemned.\n\nKhrushchev expressed grave concern over the rift which had arisen in Soviet–Albanian relations—“We are deeply troubled by this situation …”—but ruled out any concessions on the Soviet side involving the sacrifice of principle:\n\nThe course drawn up by the Twentieth Congress of our party is a Leninist course, and we cannot concede on this fundamental question to either the Albanian leaders or anyone else. To depart from the Twentieth Congress line would mean not heeding the wise instructions of Lenin, who discerned the danger of the appearance of the Stalin cult even when it was in embryo. It would mean disregarding the costly lessons of history, forgetting the price that our party paid for not having heeded in time the instructions of its great leader.89\n\nBy portraying Lenin rather than himself as the real originator of the condemnation of Stalin’s cult of personality, Khrushchev was in effect charging the Albanians with an attack on Lenin—one of the gravest charges one communist can lodge against another.\n\nKhrushchev closed this section of his report with expressions of hope for reconciliation—of course, through concessions on the part of the Albanian leaders: “If the Albanian leaders hold dear the interests of their people and the cause of building socialism in Albania, if they really want friendship with the CPSU, with all the fraternal parties, they should renounce their mistaken views and return to the path of unity and close cooperation in the fraternal family of the socialist commonwealth, the path of unity with the whole international communist movement.”90\n\nShowing an awareness that he himself was sometimes accused of fostering his own cult of personality, Khrushchev devoted the next section of his report to extolling the principle of collective leadership. “There is not one major question of either domestic or foreign policy,” he assured his listeners, “… that is not discussed collectively in our party, and the decisions adopted are the expression of the party’s collective experience.”91 Not only at the top level but throughout the party, Khrushchev asserted, these Leninist principles were being observed: “It has become the practice to hold broad party-wide and nation-wide discussion of the questions that are introduced for consideration at Central Committee plenums and U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet sessions.”92 The regular convening of party congresses and Central Committee plenums, Khrushchev continued, a custom which had been “grossly violated” in the period of the cult of personality, now characterized party life from top to bottom. All of this placed high demands on the individual party member, a theme Khrushchev developed at some length.\n\nHaving unveiled two of the controversial themes which were to dominate the Twenty-second Congress—the renewed attack on Stalin and the Antiparty Group and the dispute with the Albanian party leadership—Khrushchev, in the remainder of his October 17 report, turned to less sensitive topics. The next section of the report dealt with internal party policy, under the heading:\n\n2. Organizational Work of the Party and the Rearing of Cadres. The Active Participation of the Masses in Public Activities is the Key to New Successes.\n\nAt the outset of this section Khrushchev called attention to a shift in the emphasis of party work which is highly characteristic of his conception of the party and its role: “Comrades! In recent years the party has abruptly shifted toward questions of the concrete guidance of the national economy. The Central Committee has turned the attention of party organizations and executive cadres to the careful study and extensive dissemination of progressive experience in industry and agriculture; it has taught through specific positive examples how to conduct our great communist construction correctly.”93\n\nWhile he stressed the high requirements set for each individual party functionary, however, the dominant note was again the collective nature of party decisions. “The strength of party leadership,” he said, “… lies in its collective character, which is what helps to knit the talents, knowledge and experience of many people into a single talent, as it were, capable of doing great things.”94\n\nFor the future, Khrushchev envisaged a gradual merging of the party with Soviet society in general. “We are moving toward communism,” he asserted, “… under which the people themselves will manage the affairs of society without special apparatus.”95 And he proceeded to spell out the implications of this development:\n\nIn our country the socialist system of government is in process of evolving into public self-government. As the vanguard of a people engaged in building a communist society, the party must also take the lead in organizing its own inner-party life; it must set an example, be a model in developing the very best forms of communist public self-government. In practice this may mean, for instance, that the apparatus of the party agencies will steadily shrink while the ranks of party activists will grow. The party agencies should have more and more commissions, departments, instructors and secretaries of raikoms and gorkoms who work on a public [unpaid] basis.96\n\nThe remainder of this section of the report dealt with shortcomings in party leadership, the choice of cadres, supervision of the execution of decisions, and the problems and responsibilities of the soviets, the trade unions, and the Komsomol.\n\nFor the final section of his speech Khrushchev took the high ground of theory and prophecy, under the heading:\n\n3. The Ideological Activity of the Party and the Strengthening of Ties with the Life of the People. The Building of Communism and the Development of Revolutionary Theory.\n\nAs was to be expected, the new Party Program was placed in the center of attention here, an"
