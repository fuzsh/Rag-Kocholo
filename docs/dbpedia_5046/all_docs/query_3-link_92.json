So at age nine, my grandmother was an orphan living with her aunt Mariska and her alcoholic uncle in a tiny house with dirt floors and small windows. In a short while she would be matched with my grandfather, Pista (now 14), and move to Marcali.\n\nIt's amazing that either one was alive to meet at all... It's amazing that either one was alive to meet at all... Itâs amazing that either one was alive to meet at all...\n\nVILMA dead at 29\n\nThe next two years were complicated. Europe was falling apart after the war; Russia experienced the most upheaval, where the Bolsheviks overthrew Tsar Nicholas II. In Hungary, socialists, and then the more radical communists, overthrew Hungaryâs nobility. But unlike Russia, Hungaryâs right-wing nobility was able to regain control, literally riding in on a white horse.\n\nFirst, though, Hungary had to survive the flu. As if the shell-shocked, traumatized, starving, TB-ridden post-WWI world couldn't take any more grief, the Spanish Flu raged from one country to the next, killing far more people than the Great War...\n\nThe flu's second wave, which came in October and November 1918, was so contagious and deadly that a person could come down with symptoms and die within hours.\n\nA children's rhyme from this period went:\n\nAt the end of the First World War in July 1918, exhausted men and women could only look at their lives as if through broken mirrors. Marcali lost 246 men. Those who survivedâlike my forever shell-shocked great-grandfather IstvaÌnâcame home to starving families and woebegone farms. IstvaÌn did not recover, and his younger teenage son, Pista (my grandfather), gradually took over the farm.\n\nAnd the problems didnât end: food shortages, labor shortages, inflation. An impulse for radical change bubbled up among vast segments of the population.\n\nWho started this devastating war? And what for? Who started this devastating war? And what for? WHO STARTED THIS DEVASTATING WAR? AND WHAT FOR?\n\nSomebody had to pay for the millions of lives lost. In central and eastern Europe, it was the great empires. The German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires did not survive the end of the war. Neither did the careers (and decadent lifestyles) of their four rulers:\n\nKaiser Wilhelm escaped to the neutral Netherlands and became Wilhelm Hohenzollern, private citizen, by November.

He had tried to claim the throne in Hungary twice, but there was little enthusiasm for a Habsburg king in Hungary anymore.

Bolshevik revolutionaries murdered Russia's Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Bolshevik revolutionaries murdered Russiaâs Tsar Nicholas II and his family.\n\nTHEmost radical social changes to come out of World War I took place in Russia, where revolution broke out on International Womenâs Day in March 1917. Around 90,000 women workers went on strike demanding âpeace and bread,â which led to a wave of further protests and riots. Four days later, the tsar was forced to abdicate and women were granted the right to vote!\n\nBut the revolution, which started out democratic, took an extreme turn a few months later. Vladimir Lenin and other radical Marxists argued that Russia needed to go furtherâthey needed a Proletarian Revolution.\n\n\"WE SHALL NOW\n\nPROCEED TO CONSTRUCT\n\nTHE SOCIALIST ORDER!\"\n\n- VLADIMIR LENIN\n\nLenin and his followers, called Bolsheviks, quickly set about implementing their social revolution. They confiscated large landholdings and redistributed them to peasants; they let workers take control of factories; they declared equal rights for women and religious minorities.\n\nThe Bolsheviks also ruthlessly targeted their class enemies, which led to a brutal civil war in Russia that went on for several years and caused most of the Russian aristocracy to flee (some finding their way to Hollywood).\n\n\"THE TOWNS MUST BE\n\nCLEANSED OF THIS BOURGEOIS\n\nPUTREFACTION...\n\nALL WHO ARE DANGEROUS\n\nTO THE CAUSE OF THE\n\nREVOLUTION MUST BE\n\nEXTERMINATED!\"\n\n- PRAVDA\n\n(Communist Party\n\nNewspaper)\n\nDuring the civil war, the Bolsheviks realized they needed grain to feed their army and the people living in the cities. They tried to forcibly take grain away from the peasants, but the peasants cried foul, and so the Bolsheviks used propaganda to smear the moderately wealthy peasants (people they called kulaks) as âtight fistedâ for not wanting to hand over their grain.\n\nKULAK: an independent wealthy farmer emerging from the peasantry who employed labor. Direct (derogatory) translation: \"tight-fisted.\"\n\n\"Tight-Fisted!\"\n\n\"KULAK!\"\n\n\"KULAK!\"\n\n\"KULAK!\"\n\n\"TIGHT-FISTED!\"\n\nLENINdevised a plan to get the kulaks to fall into line, the famous âHanging Orderâ that he sent out to officials all over the countryside via telegram:\n\nHANG\n\n(AND MAKE SURE THAT\n\nTHE HANGING TAKES PLACE\n\nIN FULL VIEW OF THE PEOPLE.)\n\nSTOP.\n\nDO IT IN SUCH A FASHION\n\nTHAT FOR HUNDREDS\n\nOF KILOMETERS AROUND\n\nPEOPLE MIGHT SEE,\n\nTREMBLE,\n\nKNOW,\n\nSHOUT:\n\nNO FEWER THAN\n\nONE HUNDRED KNOWN\n\nLANDLORDS, RICH MEN,\n\nBLOODSUCKERS.\n\nSTOP.\n\n'THEY ARE STRANGLING,\n\nAND WILL STRANGLE TO DEATH\n\nTHE BLOODSUCKING\n\nKULAKS!\n\nSTOP.\n\nIf you were a âkulakâ farmer, you lived in terror. If you were Lenin, you lived in increasing paranoia as more and more people became disillusioned by the new social order.\n\nFanni Kaplan, a political revolutionary since the age of 16, was disillusioned! Two weeks after the Hanging Order, 28-year-old Kaplan reportedly shot Lenin three times with a Browning pistol after he exited a factory building where he was giving a speech. He would survive, incredibly....\n\nFanni Kaplan: Lenin's Assassin Fanni Kaplan: Lenin's Assassin FANNI KAPLAN: LENINâS ASSASSIN\n\n\"MY NAME IS FANYA KAPLAN.\n\nTODAY I SHOT LENIN.\n\nI DID IT ON MY OWN.\n\nI WILL NOT SAY FROM WHOM\n\nI OBTAINED MY REVOLVER.\n\nI WILL GIVE NO DETAILS.\n\nI HAD RESOLVED TO KILL\n\nLENIN LONG AGO.\n\nI CONSIDER HIM A TRAITOR\n\nTO THE REVOLUTION.\"\n\n- FANNI KAPLAN\n\nKaplan was captured, interrogated, and killed a few days later; we will never know if she was the actual shooter.\n\nLeninâs paranoia got even worse after the assassination attempt, and the civil war turned even more brutal. Millions of Russians died during this period from combat, political terror, and famine.\n\nRussia, which the Bolsheviks renamed the Soviet Union in 1917, was a nightmare. Russia, which the Bolsheviks renamed the Soviet Union in 1917, was a nightmare. Russia, which the Bolsheviks renamed THE SOVIET UNION in 1917, was a nightmare.

Enough about Russia for now. Enough about Russia for now.\n\nTHROUGHOUTEurope and Hungary, the level of beleaguered discontent and complete social collapse was so high that emerging ideologuesâpromising to fix things and make life betterâfound welcome ears.\n\nObviously, the âgreat powersâ that brought on the mass destruction of World War I had lost legitimacy in Hungary too. Over the next year, Hungary's political pendulum swung wildly, first to the left, then to the far left, then to the far right.\n\nTHEleft-wing Aster Revolution broke out in Hungary in October 1918, calling for land reform, civil liberties, and universal suffrage, which would give religious minorities the vote. The revolutionaries wore aster flowers on their lapels (these flowers bloom in October). The passionate young politician, MihÃ¡ly KÃ¡rolyi, was the appointed figurehead.\n\nMihÃ¡ly KÃ¡rolyi MihÃ¡ly KÃ¡rolyi MIHÃLY KÃROLYI\n\nKÃ¡rolyi came from an extremely wealthy noble family, but, like Lajos Kossuth from 1848, he favored a more democratic redistribution of land and power. He also supported womenâs rights, and had a rare equal relationship (and incredible bond) with his wife, Katinka.\n\nKatinka AndrÃ¡ssy (left) and MihÃ¡ly KÃ¡rolyi Katinka AndrÃ¡ssy (left) and MihÃ¡ly KÃ¡rolyi KATINKA ANDRÃSSY (left) & MIHÃLY KÃROLYI\n\nKatinka AndrÃ¡ssy was the granddaughter of the famous nobleman Gyula AndrÃ¡ssy (remember him from 1867? He negotiated the 1867 Compromise and wore a corset). Despite her family legacy of wealth and power, Katinka AndrÃ¡ssy rejected the idle lifestyles of the ruling class and, with her husband, committed herself to social welfare, political activism, and pacifism. She was president of the Hungarian Red Cross during the war. She publicly challenged the practice of recruiting village girls to army brothels. She championed a government that served all people, not just the nobility.\n\nâTHE ROLE OF\n\nGOVERNMENT IS TO\n\nMAKE PEOPLE HAPPIER\n\nAND LIFE MORE\n\nWORTH LIVING.â\n\n-KATINKA ANDRÃSSY\n\nKatinka AndrÃ¡ssy Katinka AndrÃ¡ssy KATINKA ANDRÃSSY\n\nKatinka wrote that her marriage to MihÃ¡ly was \"something unusual in its completeness.\" Katinka wrote that her marriage to MihÃ¡ly was \"something unusual in its completeness.\" Katinka wrote that her marriage to MihÃ¡ly was âsomething unusual in its completeness.â So ahead of their time, they are two of my favorite Hungarians. So ahead of their time, they are two of my favorite Hungarians. So ahead of their time, they are two of my favorite Hungarians.\n\nPracticing the social democratic principles that he and Katinka preached, KaÌrolyi redistributed the land of one of his estates:\n\n\"LET US REDISTRIBUTE\n\nALL LARGE ESTATES\n\n(700 ACRES OR MORE)\n\nTO LANDLESS PEASANTRY!\n\nLET US GIVE ALL MEN\n\nAND WOMEN\n\nTHE RIGHT TO VOTE!\"\n\n- MIHÃLY KÃROLYI\n\nBut despite KÃ¡rolyiâs and AndrÃ¡ssyâs hopeful pacifism, their efforts provoked unrest throughout the Hungarian countryside. Impatient, disgruntled peasants burned down mansions, looted stores and granaries, and attacked land-owning priests.\n\nKÃROLYIhad an even bigger problem on his hands, though. Although it was widely assumed that he had many friends in western Europe that would ensure a just peace for Hungary, along came the news that the Allies sought to drastically shrink Hungaryâs borders. The old multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire was being replaced by nation states. This meant that the territories of Hungary where non-Hungarian speakers lived would be left outside the new borders. But even more disturbingly, so would about three million Magyars!\n\nWhat a shock! Hungary would lose all of Transylvania, the Uplands (FelvidÃ©k), the Lowlands (DÃ©lvidÃ©k), and smaller sections in Burgenland (now part of Austria) and Ruthenia (now part of Ukraine). What a shock! Hungary would lose all of Transylvania, the Uplands (FelvidÃ©k), the Lowlands (DÃ©lvidÃ©k), and smaller sections in Burgenland (now part of Austria) and Ruthenia (now part of Ukraine). What a shock! Hungary would lose all of Transylvania, the Uplands (FelvidÃ©k), the Lowlands (DÃ©lvidÃ©k), in Burgenland and Ruthenia and smaller sections (now part of Austria) (now part of Ukraine).\n\nHungarian anger was valid. Yes, they had fought in the war, but they certainly werenât the main aggressors. So why were they being treated so harshly? Did Hungaryâs state-building legacy in Central Europe count for nothing? How could they be a nation-state if three million Hungarians were cut off from their fatherland? How could the country support itself economically if it lost practically all of its natural resources?\n\nUnimaginably, Hungary went back to war! And the far left radical communist BÃ©la Kun was suddenly leading this war effort. BÃ©la Kun? Who? Unimaginably, Hungary went back to war! And the far left radical communist BÃ©la Kun was suddenly leading this war effort. BÃ©la Kun? Who? Unimaginably, HUNGARY WENT BACK TO WAR! And the far left radical communist BÃ©la Kun was suddenly leading this war effort. BÃLA KUN? WHO?\n\nHe was magnetic and keen on power... He was magnetic and keen on power... He was magnetic and keen on power...\n\nBÃLA KUN\n\nand a Lenin protÃ©gÃ©... and a Lenin protÃ©gÃ©... and a Lenin protÃ©gÃ©...\n\n\"LET THERE BE A\n\nLENIN-LIKE\n\nSOCIALIST ORDER!\"\n\n- BÃLA KUN\n\nBeÌla Kun had been a muckraking journalist before the War. As a soldier in World War I, he was captured by the Russians on the Eastern front, learned Russian fluently as a POW, and embraced communist ideology. Then he became a âFriend of Lenin,â fought for the Bolsheviks in Russiaâs Civil War, and came back to Hungary in November 1918, flush with Soviet financing, to form a Hungarian Soviet Republic.\n\nBÃ©la Kun (an atheist) was of Jewish ancestry, as were other prominent members of the regime. Anti-Semites used this fact to link all Jews to the idea of a Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy. This linkage would have terrible consequences, eventually, for Hungarian Jews.\n\nASRomania prepared to take over their share of Hungary (Hungaryâs beloved eastern region called Transylvania, a mixed territory with ethnic Romanians and Hungarians), Kun promised that his Soviet Bolshevik financiers would help Hungary protect its ancient borders. Needing cash, the coalition government let Kun gain control.\n\nLater, the Hungarian government regretted their hasty embrace of Kun. Swinging Hungary to the far left, Kunâs fledgling communist regime accomplished quite a lot in the next 133 days .... They:\n\nCOMMITTEDHungary to war against Romania and Czechoslovakia to protect Greater Hungaryâs borders, now in jeopardy of being lost.\n\nNATIONALIZEDbanks, factories, and apartment blocks.\n\nCONVERTEDlarge and medium-sized estates into state ownership without compensation, collectivizing land instead of redistributing it to peasants.\n\nPUTall trading, educational, and cultural institutions under state control.\n\nREPLACEDthe police with âRed Guards.â\n\nREPLACEDthe judicial system with ârevolutionaryâ courts manned by laymen.\n\nPASSEDsocial decrees in favor of women and children, giving hope, perhaps, to many of Hungary's unnamed women.\n\nCONFISCATEDbank accounts and expensive jewelry.\n\nCREATEDHungaryâs own version of Leninâs Red Terror, led by a gang of scary, leather-clad men who called themselves âLenin Boys.â\n\nWorld War I. The tuberculosis epidemic. The Spanish flu. The assault on Hungary's borders. And now this social upheaval... Hungary plunged into even more chaos. World War I. The tuberculosis epidemic. The Spanish flu. The assault on Hungary's borders. And now this social upheaval... Hungary plunged into even more chaos. World War I. The tuberculosis epidemic. The Spanish flu. The assault on Hungaryâs borders. And now this social upheaval... Hungary plunged into even more chaos.\n\nFor factory workers, disillusioned soldiers, and the poorest peasants, BeÌla Kun's radical socialist rhetoric may have made some sense. For the wealthy elite who were attacked and killed by the \"Lenin Boys\" and forced to nationalize their businesses, they were justifiably scared. For sure, the aspiring, land-owning FaÌbos family were no fans of BeÌla Kunâs schemes for Soviet-style collective farming!\n\nThe Kun government invaded Czechoslovakia to inspire a Bolshevik revolution there as well. Meanwhile, the Romanian army, with the blessing of the western allies, invaded Hungary and advanced as far as Budapest, pillaging, requisitioning, and dismantling factories to the last screw along the way. The Soviet Union, preoccupied with their own civil war, never did lend a hand to Hungary.\n\nRomanian forces entering Budapest Romanian forces entering Budapest ROMANIAN FORCES entering Budapest\n\nANDsoon Hungaryâs political pendulum swung wildly again! In southern Hungary, a far-right, counterrevolutionary militia had organized to take down BÃ©la Kun and his \"Lenin Boys.â After Romaniaâs invasion, they worked with the Allied powers to negotiate a Romanian retreat in mid-November 1919 and simultaneously take control of Hungary (Kun, in the meantime, had fled to Vienna). At the helm of this far-right militia was Admiral MiklÃ³s Horthy.\n\nHorthy had been an assistant to Emperor Franz Joseph, so he was an âold schoolâ conservative allied with the aristocracy and the now-dissolved Habsburg Empire. He had been a naval officer. He was a nationalist. He opposed womenâs rights. He was anti-communist and anti-Semitic (these two were now fused).\n\nHe stood for everything the short-lived KÃ¡rolyi and Kun governments did not.\n\nHorthy's group now attached themselves to the myth of heroic Magyar warriors and Hungary's claim to the entire Carpathian Basin. Many Hungarians remember Horthy today as âhonorably withstanding the Romaniansâ near Lake Balaton (not far from my familyâs farm) to claim the mantle of Hungarian nationalism.\n\nAdmiral MiklÃ³s Horthy Admiral MiklÃ³s Horthy ADMIRAL MIKLÃS HORTHY He had been a world-class tennis champion (and proudly listed his many sporty pursuits in his later autobiography). He had been a world-class tennis champion (and proudly listed his many sporty pursuits in his later autobiography).
