Sixteen years since it occurred, Tupac Shakurâ€™s death remains a mystery wrapped in an enigma. The rapper had dodged bullets for most of his career, but the fatal shot was fired on September 7, 1996 in Las Vegas. Shakur was leaving a boxing match when an unknown assassin fired a volley of shots at him. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and was heavily sedated until his death nearly a week later, on Friday the 13th. The murder remains unsolved.
