        "text": "Shakur was fatally shot in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas on the night of September 7, 1996. He was 25.\n\nNevada doesn't have a statute of limitations for homicide cases, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe \"All Eyez on Me\" rapper was stopped at a red light on the Las Vegas Strip when he was gunned down, and treated at a hospital for a week before he died from his injuries.\n\nNo arrests have been made in the case, and some witnesses have refused to cooperate in the past, the AP reported.\n\nRelated stories\n\nShakur is considered an all-time great in the genre, but his posthumous influence also extends beyond hip-hop as a global cultural icon. He released five albums that charted at number one, including \"Me Against the World,\" in 1995 and \"All Eyez on Me,\" in 1996, per the AP.\n\nHis success also stretched to three albums that were released after his premature death. Throughout his five year career as a solo artist, he topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart with \"How Do U Want It/California Love,\" featuring K-Ci and JoJo.\n\nShakur had also survived being shot five times at a Manhattan studio in 1994.\n\nThe incident amplified an East-West coast beef that permeated between Suge Knight's Death Row Records and Sean \"Puffy\" Combs' Bad Boy Records, as well as personally between Shakur and late rapper Biggie Smalls, according to the Guardian.\n\nIn the streaming era, Shakur's influence still reigns supreme, having racked up 10.1 billion audio and video streams, according to the AP.\n\nIn 2017, Shakur was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by close collaborator and confidant Snoop Dogg, and this year, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nJuly 18, 2023: This story has been updated with a statement from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirming the search to Insider."
