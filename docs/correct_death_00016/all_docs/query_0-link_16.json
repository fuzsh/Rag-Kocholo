        "text": "One of the last living witnesses to the fatal drive-by shooting of rapper Tupac Shakur was charged with murder with use of a deadly weapon on Friday in the 1996 killing, a long-awaited breakthrough in a case that has frustrated investigators and fascinated the public ever since the hip-hop icon was killed 27 years ago.\n\nA Nevada grand jury indicted Duane (Keefe D) Davis in the killing, prosecutors announced in court on Friday.\n\nChief Deputy District Attorney Marc DiGiacomo said a grand jury had been seated in the case for \"several months.\" DiGiacomo described Davis as the \"on-ground, on-site commander\" who \"ordered the death\" of Shakur.\n\nThe charges were revealed hours after Davis, 60, was arrested this morning while on a walk near his home in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, according to DiGiacomo.\n\nDavis has long been known to investigators and has himself admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir, Compton Street Legend, that he was in the Cadillac when Shakur was killed in a drive-by shooting near the Las Vegas Strip.\n\n'Justice has been delayed, but justice won't be denied'\n\nLas Vegas police searched a home tied to Davis's home in mid-July. Police were looking for items \"concerning the murder of Tupac Shakur,\" according to the search warrant. They collected multiple computers, a cellphone and hard drive, a Vibe magazine that featured Shakur, several .40-calibre bullets, two \"tubs containing photographs\" and a copy of Davis's memoir.\n\n\"It has often been said that justice delayed is justice denied,\" District Attorney Steve Wolfson said after the hearing in a brief comment to The Associated Press. \"In this case, justice has been delayed, but justice won't be denied.\"\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if Davis has a lawyer who can comment on his behalf. Davis hasn't responded to multiple phone and text messages from the AP seeking comment or an interview in the more than two months since the house raid.\n\nShakur was in a BMW driven by Death Row Records founder Marion (Suge) Knight in a convoy of about 10 cars. They were waiting at a red light near the Las Vegas Strip when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted. Shakur was shot multiple times and died a week later.\n\nThe rapper's death came as his fourth solo album, All Eyez on Me, remained on the charts, with some five million copies sold. Nominated six times for a Grammy Award, Shakur is still largely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time."
