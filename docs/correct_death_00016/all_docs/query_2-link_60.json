        "text": "Tupac Shakur was shot in a drive-by near the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane on the night of September 7, 1996 after leaving the Mike Tysonâ€“Bruce Seldon boxing match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas with his entourage. Paramedics took him to University Medical Center where he survived six days before dying on September 13th. Eight albums by Tupac have been released posthumously.\n\nJust like Biggie Smalls' death in Los Angeles the next year, the murder of Tupac Shakur remains unsolved."
