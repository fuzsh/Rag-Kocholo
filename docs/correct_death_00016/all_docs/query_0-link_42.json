        "text": "UPDATED, 12:14 PM: A Clark County grand jury handed down a murder indictment today against the man arrested earlier in connection with the killing of Tupac Shakur. Duane “Keefe D” Davis is accused of gunning down the storied rapper on the Las Vegas Strip in 1996. District Judge Jerry Wiese ordered Davis, 60, a reputed gang member, held without bail.\n\nIn court, Chief Deputy District Attorney Marc DiGiacomo announced the charge of murder with a deadly weapon with the intent to promote, further or assist a criminal gang. He referred to Davis as the “on-ground, on-sight commander” and “shot caller” in a revenge plot against Shakur, Death Row Records founder Suge Knight and the label.\n\nPREVIOUSLY, 10:17 AM: Police in Las Vegas have arrested a man in connection with the 1996 killing of fabled rapper Tupac Shakur, according to the Associated Press.\n\nCiting two officials with firsthand knowledge of the case, the news org said Duane “Keefe D” Davis, who long has been tied to the Shakur shooting, was taken into custody early today.\n\nThe arrest comes two months after Vegas police served a search warrant in nearby Henderson, Nevada, looking for items “concerning the murder of Tupac Shakur.”\n\nDavis has admitted in interviews and in his 2019 memoir Compton Street Legend that he was in the Cadillac where the gunfire erupted in the drive-by shooting. Shakur was 25 when he was gunned down near the Las Vegas Strip. The musician was struck by two rounds in the chest, one in the arm and one in the thigh while sitting in a vehicle on the night of the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon fight. He died at a hospital six days later.\n\nRELATED: ‘Dear Mama’ Duo On The Legacy Of Tupac & Afeni Shakur And Holding Out Hope For Justice – Contenders TV: The Nominees\n\nThe events of that evening and questions surrounding the unsolved case have been the subject of numerous film and TV explorations, including U.S.A.’s 2018 series Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and Biggie Smalls, the 2017 doc Who Shot Biggie and Tupac?, the 2017 biopic All Eyez on Me from Summit, Morgan Creek, Program Pictures and Codeblack Films, Nick Broomfield’s 2002 feature-length documentary Biggie & Tupac, FX’s Emmy-nominated series Dear Mama: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur, which premiered earlier this year, the Oscar-nominated film Tupac: Resurrection and many more.\n\nRELATED: Tupac Museum To Open In Los Angeles With Blessing Of Hip-Hop Icon’s Estate\n\nRecording as 2Pac, Shakur produced five No. 1 albums in a pioneering and influential career. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nTom Tapp contributed to this report"
