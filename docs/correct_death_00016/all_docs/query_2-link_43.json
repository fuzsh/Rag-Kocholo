        "text": "“27 years. 27 years. For 27 years, the family of Tupac Shakur has been waiting for justice. We are here today to announce the arrest of 60-year-old Duane Keith Davis, a.k.a., Keithy D. for the murder of Tupac Shakur. Davis was arrested this morning by my L.V.M.P.D. Criminal Apprehension team, and this investigation started on the night of September 7th, 1996. It is far from over.” “Prior to September 7th of 1996, as we all know, Tupac Shakur was an artist who was signed with death Row Records. And that death Row Records and its CEO, Marion Suge Knight, were closely affiliated with the Mob Piru criminal street gangs, and that they had an ongoing feud with the South side, Compton Crips. Duane Davis was the leader and shot caller of the South side, Compton Crips. And both of these gangs operated out of the Southern California area of Compton. On the night of September 7th of 1996, Tupac Shakur, along with Suge Knight and members of their entourage, which include members of Mob Piru, came to Vegas to attend the Mike Tyson fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Members of the South Side Compton crips, which included Duane Davis, along with his nephew, Orlando Anderson, were also in attendance at the same event as both were leaving the fight. Members of Death Row Records spotted Orlando Anderson near an elevator bank inside the MGM, and at that time they began to kick and punch him near that elevator bank. And on this incident, you will see Tupac Shakur, who is wearing a shiny satiny shirt along with Marion Suge knight, who is a large man in a Brown suit punching and kicking Orlando Anderson. Following this incident, you’ll see hotel security intervene. And then they will leave the area of the fight. Following this incident, Tupac and Suge Knight both left the MGM to make their way to a post fight party, which was to occur at a local nightclub. At the same time, word had spread amongst members of the Southside Compton Crips of what had occurred inside the MGM. And then that’s when Duane Davis began to devise a plan to obtain a firearm and retaliate against shug Knight and Mr Shakur for what occurred inside the hotel against Mr. Anderson. After Davis obtained a gun, he entered into a white Cadillac, along with Terrence brown, DeAndre Smith and Orlando Anderson. Based on our investigation, this is where we know they were seated. At some point in time, as they were in the White Cadillac. Mr Davis took the gun that he had obtained and provided it to the passengers in the rear seat of the vehicle as they were both, as they were driving West on Flamingo Road near cobalt. They located the Black BMW, which was driven by Suge Knight. And in the passenger seat was Tupac Shakur. And as they turned around, they pulled up near the passenger side of that vehicle and immediately began shooting at Mr. Knight and Mr. Shakur. Following that shooting, the White Cadillac fled the area southbound on cobalt. And as our after our officers arrived on scene, Tupac was later transported to the University Medical center, where he’s treated medically and died approximately six days later on September 13."
