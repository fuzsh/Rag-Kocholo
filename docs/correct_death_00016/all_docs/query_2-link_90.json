        "text": "Police in the US state of Nevada have searched a house near Las Vegas in connection with the killing of rapper Tupac Shakur nearly three decades ago.\n\nShakur, one of the most prolific figures in hip-hop, was killed on the night of September 7, 1996, in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas at the age of 25.\n\nOn Tuesday (local time), the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the search warrant was executed in the nearby city of Henderson a day earlier.\n\nNo additional information regarding who owned the house or what led police to conduct the search was given.\n\nDepartment spokesperson Aden Ocampo-Gomez said in a brief phonecall that he couldn't provide further details on the latest development in the case, citing the open investigation.\n\nNevada does not have a statute of limitations for prosecuting homicide cases.\n\nHow did Tupac die?\n\nShakur was gunned down while sitting inside a black BMW with Marion 'Suge' Knight, head of Death Row Records.\n\nPolice have said the two were waiting at a red light near the Las Vegas Strip when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.\n\nShot multiple times, Shakur was rushed to a hospital where he died six days later.\n\nNo arrests have ever been made.\n\nLas Vegas police have said in the past that the investigation quickly stalled in part because witnesses refused to cooperate.\n\nWhat was the East Coast-West Coast rivalry?\n\nShakur's death came amid his feud with rap rival the Notorious B.I.G., who was fatally shot six months later.\n\nAt the time, both rappers were in the middle of the infamous East Coast-West Coast rivalry, which primarily defined the hip-hop scene during the mid-1990s.\n\nThe feud was ignited after Shakur was seriously wounded in another shooting during a robbery in the lobby of a mid-town Manhattan hotel.\n\nShakur openly accused B.I.G. and Sean 'Diddy' Combs of having prior knowledge of the shooting. Both vehemently denied the claim.\n\nThe shooting sparked a serious divide within the hip-hop community and fans.\n\nThe New York-born Shakur represented the West Coast after he signed with Los Angeles-based Death Row Records, frequently trading barbs in the media and in lyrics.\n\nB.I.G. and Combs hailed from the East Coast, representing New York City-based Bad Boy Records.\n\nWho was Tupac?\n\nLargely considered one of rap's most influential and versatile performers, the six-time Grammy Award-nominated Shakur has five number-one albums.\n\nIn a professional music career spanning just five years, Shakur secured 21 Billboard Hot 100s, including top 10 hits Dear Mama and Old School, and his best-known track, How Do U Want It/California Love, featuring K-Ci and JoJo.\n\nAccording to entertainment data company Luminate, Shakur has sold 33 million albums, 41 million when including track sales and streaming equivalents.\n\nThe rapper's on-demand video and audio streams total 10.1 billion.\n\nIn 2017, Shakur was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Snoop Dogg.\n\nIn June of this year, the rapper received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
