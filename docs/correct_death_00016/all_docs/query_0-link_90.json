        "text": "Las Vegas police have arrested a man in the deadly 1996 drive-by shooting of Tupac Shakur, a long-awaited break in a case that has frustrated investigators and fascinated the public ever since the hip-hop icon was gunned down on the Las Vegas Strip 27 years ago.\n\nDuane \"Keffe D\" Davis was arrested early Friday morning, although the exact charge or charges were not immediately clear, according to two officials with first-hand knowledge of the arrest. They were not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an expected indictment later Friday.\n\nDavis has long been known to investigators and has himself admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir, \"Compton Street Legend,\" that he was in the Cadillac where the gunfire erupted during the September 1996 drive-by shooting. Shakur was 25 when he was gunned down.\n\nThe arrest comes two months after Las Vegas police raided his wife's home July 17 in neighboring Henderson. Documents said police were looking for items \"concerning the murder of Tupac Shakur.\"\n\nPolice reported collecting multiple computers, a cellphone and hard drive, a Vibe magazine that featured Shakur, several .40-caliber bullets, two \"tubs containing photographs\" and a copy of Davis' 2019 tell-all memoir, \"Compton Street Legend.\"\n\nIn the book, Davis said he broke his silence over Tupac's killing in 2010 during a closed-door meeting with federal and local authorities. At the time, he was 46 and facing life in prison on drug charges when he agreed to speak with the authorities.\n\n\"They promised they would shred the indictment and stop the grand jury if I helped them out,\" he wrote.\n\nHe has described himself as one of the last living witnesses to the shooting.\n\nShakur was 25 when he was gunned down in a drive-by shooting near the Las Vegas Strip on the night of Sept. 7, 1996. The rapper was in a BMW driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \"Suge\" Knight in a convoy of about 10 cars. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.\n\nShakur was shot multiple times and died a week later.\n\nIn 2018, after a cancer diagnosis, Davis admitted publicly in an interview for a BET show to being inside the Cadillac during the attack. He implicated his nephew, Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, saying he was one of two people in the back seat where the shots were fired.\n\nThe shooting happened shortly after a casino brawl earlier in the evening involving Anderson, Shakur and others.\n\nAnderson denied any involvement in the Shakur shooting. He died two years later in a shooting in Compton, California.\n\nShakur's death came as his fourth solo album, \"All Eyez on Me,\" remained on the charts, with some 5 million copies sold. Nominated six times for a Grammy Award, Shakur is largely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time.\n\nShakur was feuding at the time with rap rival Biggie Smalls, also known as the Notorious B.I.G., who was fatally shot in March 1997. At the time, both rappers were in the middle of an East Coast-West Coast rivalry that primarily defined the hip-hop scene during the mid-1990s.\n\nGreg Kading, a retired Los Angeles police detective who spent years investigating the Shakur killing and wrote a book about it, said he would not be surprised by Davis's indictment and arrest.\n\n\"It's so long overdue,\" Kading told The Associated Press during a recent interview. \"People have been yearning for him to be arrested for a long time. It's never been unsolved in our minds. It's been unprosecuted.\"\n\nKading said he interviewed Davis in 2008 and 2009, during Los Angeles police investigations of the killings of Shakur in Las Vegas and the slaying of Biggie Smalls.\n\nKading said also that he talked with a Las Vegas police detective about the case, including after the SWAT raid in July at the home in Henderson.\n\nThe former Los Angeles police detective said he believed the investigation gained new momentum in recent years following Davis's public descriptions of his role in the killing, including his 2019 tell-all memoir, \"Compton Street Legend.\"\n\n\"It's those events that have given Las Vegas the ammunition and the leverage to move forward,\" Kading said. \"Prior to Keefe D's public declarations, the cases were unprosecutable as they stood.\"\n\n\"He put himself squarely in the middle of the conspiracy,\" Kading said of Davis and the Shakur slaying. \"He had acquired the gun, he had given the gun to the shooter and he had been present in the vehicle when they hunted down and located both Tupac and Suge (Knight).\"\n\nKading noted that Davis is the last living person among the four people who were in the vehicle from which shots were fired at Shakur and rapper Marion \"Suge\" Knight. Others were Davis's nephew, Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, Terrence \"Bubble Up\" Brown and DeAndre \"Freaky\" Smith.\n\n\"It's a concerted effort of conspirators,\" Kading said, adding that he believed that because the killing was premeditated Davis could face a first-degree murder charge.\n\n\"All the other direct conspirators or participants are all dead,\" Kading said. \"Keefe D is the last man standing among the individuals that conspired to kill Tupac.\""
