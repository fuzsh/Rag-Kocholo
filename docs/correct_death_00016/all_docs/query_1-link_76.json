        "text": "A man who prosecutors say ordered the 1996 killing of rapper Tupac Shakur was arrested and charged with murder Friday in a long-awaited breakthrough in one of hip-hop's most enduring mysteries.\n\nDuane \"Keffe D\" Davis has long been known to investigators as one of four suspects identified early in the investigation. He isn't the accused gunman but was described as the group's ringleader by authorities Friday at a news conference and in court.\n\n\"Duane Davis was the shot caller for this group of individuals that committed this crime,\" said police homicide Lt. Jason Johansson, \"and he orchestrated the plan that was carried out.\"\n\nDavis himself has admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir, Compton Street Legend, that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting.\n\nAuthorities said Friday that Davis' own public comments revived the investigation.\n\nDavis, now 60, was arrested early Friday while on a walk near his home on the outskirts of Las Vegas, hours before prosecutors announced in court that a Nevada grand jury had indicted the self-described gangster on one count of murder with a deadly weapon. He is due in court next week.\n\nThe grand jury also voted to add a sentencing enhancement to the murder charge for gang activity that could add up to 20 additional years if he's convicted.\n\nThe first-ever arrest in the case came after Las Vegas police raided Davis' home in mid-July in the nearby city of Henderson for items they described at the time as \"concerning the murder of Tupac Shakur.\"\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if Davis has an attorney who can comment on his behalf. Prosecutors said they did not know if he had a lawyer and several local attorneys said they did not know who from Las Vegas would represent him. Phone and text messages to Davis and his wife on Friday and in the months since the July 17 search weren't returned.\n\n\"For 27 years, the family of Tupac Shakur has been waiting for justice,\" Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a news conference Friday. \"While I know there's been many people who did not believe that the murder of Tupac Shakur was important to this police department, I'm here to tell you that is simply not the case.\"\n\nProsecutors said they have been in contact with the rapper's family, who are \"pleased with this news.\"\n\nOn the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \"Suge\" Knight. They were waiting at a red light near the Las Vegas Strip when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.\n\nShakur was shot multiple times and died a week later at the age of 25.\n\nDavis, in his memoir, said he was in the front passenger seat of the Cadillac and had slipped a gun into the back seat, from where he said the shots were fired.\n\nHe implicated his nephew, Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, saying he was one of two people in the backseat. Anderson, a known rival of Shakur, had been involved in a casino brawl with the rapper shortly before the shooting.\n\nAnderson died two years later. He denied any involvement in Shakur's death.\n\nEmails seeking comment from two lawyers who have previously represented Knight were not immediately returned. Knight was grazed by a bullet fragment in the shooting but had only minor injuries. He is serving a 28-year prison sentence in California for an unrelated voluntary manslaughter charge."
