        "text": "Authorities have released previously unseen footage showing Tupac Shakur shortly before he was shot dead in Las Vegas in 1996 — as well as images of the bullet-riddled car in which he was killed in the drive-by.\n\nThe material was shown last week to a grand jury that indicted Duane “Keefe D” Davis on a charge of murder with a deadly weapon with gang enhancement in the death of the rap and cultural icon.\n\nProsecutors announced the indictment Friday after Las Vegas police arrested Davis near his home in Henderson, Nevada.\n\nKLAS obtained video of Shakur and Death Row Records co-founder Marion “Suge” Knight leaving the MGM Grand after a brawl with members of the South Side Compton Crips — who included Davis and his nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson.\n\nThe melee broke out due to Knight’s Blood-affiliated gang, Mob Piru, cops said.\n\nPhotos obtained by the outlet also show Knight’s bullet-ridden BMW that Tupac was a passenger in when it stopped at a red light at Flamingo Road and Koval Lane, a block from the Strip, and a white Cadillac pulled alongside it.\n\nThe shooter fired several rounds into the car in a matter of seconds before the Cadillac sped off, leaving Shakur mortally wounded with four bullets, including two to the chest.\n\nOne photo shows where the rapper was sitting at the time of the attack.\n\nOn Friday, Las Vegas police showed a diagram of the vehicle Davis was in, showing Anderson and a third man, Deandre Smith, in the rear, according to KLAS.\n\nA South Side Crips gang affiliate testified that Smith killed Shakur, according to the outlet. Both Anderson and Smith are deceased.\n\nThe grand jury also was shown four photos of Shakur’s autopsy, including a close-up of a bullet wound, the news station said, adding that a photo from the autopsy was first leaked to reporter Cathy Scott in 1997.\n\nIt was published in her book, “The Killing of Tupac Shakur.”\n\nOn Monday, Knight told TMZ in a jailhouse interview that he believes officials have charged the wrong man — saying he “1,000%” won’t testify against Davis.\n\nThe key witness said he was “surprised” at the arrest of the former gang member, who has repeatedly discussed his apparent knowledge of Shakur’s slaying in books and interviews.\n\nThe 58-year-old, who is serving a 28-year sentence for manslaughter involving a hit-and-run crash in 2015, also said he rejected the longstanding theory that Davis’ late nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson, was the shooter.\n\n“There was only two people in the car, and ‘Pac’s not gonna be able to tell the story, I ain’t gonna tell the story,” Knight said."
