        "text": "Tupac Shakur, a rapper and actor who built a career on controversy, died of wounds yesterday from a drive-by shooting last Saturday. He was 25 years old.\n\nMr. Shakur, who lived in Los Angeles, had been in critical condition at University Medical Center in Las Vegas since Saturday. That night as he was leaving the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon prizefight, a Cadillac pulled up alongside the BMW in which he was riding and he was shot four times. His right lung was removed on Sunday. No arrests have been made.\n\nMr. Shakur was a complex and sometimes contradictory figure, with a career featuring million-selling albums, gunshot wounds and run-ins with the police. He was an intelligent, vivid writer who had studied acting at the High School of Performing Arts in Baltimore; he was an accomplished rapper with a husky baritone and crisp enunciation. He was also a convicted sex offender, and the words ''Thug Life'' and ''Outlaw'' were tattooed on his body.\n\n''It's really unfortunate that the violent perception that the world has of that young man may be exacerbated by the way he died: art is being confused with real life,'' Mr. Shakur's lawyer, Shawn S. Chapman, said yesterday in Los Angeles. ''There was this wonderful, charming, bright, talented, funny person that no one is going to get to know; they are just going to know this other side. Hopefully, this will have some positive effect on people -- the gang members -- who are shooting each other.''\n\nIn some raps, Mr. Shakur glamorized the life of the ''player,'' a high-living, macho gangster flaunting ill-gotten gains. But in many others, sometimes on the same albums, he portrayed the gangster life as a desperate, self-destructive existence of fear and sudden death. He described gangsterism as a vicious cycle, a grimly inevitable response to racism, ghetto poverty and police brutality.\n\n''All we know is violence,'' he declared in ''Trapped.'' In an interview with Vibe magazine this year, he said children should be told that ''because I'm talking about it doesn't mean that it's O.K.'' But he also reveled in his notoriety, particularly after he was released from jail.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
