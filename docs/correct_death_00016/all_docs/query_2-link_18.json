        "text": "LAS VEGAS -- Police searched a home in the Las Vegas area on Monday night in the long-dormant murder case of hip-hop legend Tupac Shakur, a law enforcement source told ABC News.\n\n\"LVMPD can confirm a search warrant was served in Henderson, Nevada on July 17, 2023, as part of the ongoing Tupac Shakur homicide investigation. We will have no further comment at this time,\" Las Vegas Police said in a statement.\n\nVideo obtained by ABC News showed the moment police warned people to come out with their hands up as they executed a search warrant at a home.\n\nLas Vegas homicide detectives and prosecutors determined by Monday night they had enough information to proceed with a court-authorized search, an official briefed on the investigation told ABC News. The search was conducted at about 10 p.m. local time, with Las Vegas Metro PD SWAT on hand. The scene was described as loud, with police using bullhorns and lights. Among the items sought by investigators were computers, laptops and articles about Tupac and his death. The evidence in the case is now being presented to a Las Vegas grand jury.\n\nNo charges have been filed. The investigation is expected to continue for weeks to months. Investigators have long believed the gunman is likely already dead, the victim of a separate shooting two years after the Vegas drive-by. The current investigation could lead to a determination of who was in the car with the gunman when the rounds were fired that killed Tupac. That could lead to someone being charged as an accomplice. But the official cautions that charging decisions have not been made yet.\n\nShakur, one of the most prolific figures in hip-hop, was shot on Sept. 7, 1996, in Las Vegas and died in the hospital six days later from his injuries at the age of 25. No arrests have been made.\n\nHis professional music career only lasted five years, but he sold more than 75 million records worldwide, including the diamond-certified album \"All Eyez on Me,\" which was packed with hits including \"California Love (Remix)\", \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\" and \"How Do U Want It.\"\n\nOn March 9, 1997, the Notorious B.I.G., also known as Biggie Smalls, was shot and killed in Los Angeles. That shooting is widely believed to have been connected to the killing of Tupac, but like the Tupac case, no arrests have been made.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said Tuesday there is no update to share on the Biggie Smalls murder investigation in light of the news in Las Vegas."
