        "text": "On a chilly night in December 2019, I settled into the musty couch of my basement Airbnb apartment in Brooklyn and made a call to the man who was still telling everyone that he’d been part of the crew that murdered Tupac Shakur.\n\nI desperately wanted to score an interview with Duane Keith Davis, better known as Keffe D, for the final episode of the podcast season I was working on, Slow Burn: Biggie and Tupac. By the time I dialed him up, Davis had already given several on-camera interviews and even published his own memoir, which included intricate details about his role in the fatal Sept. 1996 shooting of Shakur. I thought I had at least a chance.\n\nBut Davis quickly dashed my hopes. He wanted no part of any show that had talked with the cop who’d pressured him into confessing. I had to admit to Davis that we had indeed spoken with retired Los Angeles Police Department detective Greg Kading—but that we still wanted to hear Davis’ side of the story.\n\n“Fuck that snake,” Davis said. He also told me that he’d recently been diagnosed with cancer and that he wasn’t doing any interviews without some form of payment. “I don’t do shit for free, homie,” he said.\n\nI ended the phone call cordially. The final episode aired a few weeks later, with Kading closing out the segment on the investigation by saying, “There will never be any judicial closure.”\n\nMaybe that would have been true. But even though he didn’t talk to me, Davis kept talking. He kept giving interviews to others (maybe they paid him?), including as recently as this spring, with YouTube hip-hop journalist DJ Vlad.\n\nWhat Davis would say never really changed. He’d recount his role that night: He was in the front passenger seat of the white Cadillac that pulled up alongside Shakur and Death Row Records CEO Marion “Suge” Knight at a red light near the Las Vegas Strip. Davis said he slipped a gun into the back seat, from which, he said, the shots were fired.\n\nBeing a blabbermouth finally caught up with Davis. Last week, in Nevada, he was arrested and indicted on a murder charge in connection to Shakur’s death. He’ll be arraigned in Las Vegas on Friday.\n\n“While I know there have been many people who did not believe that the murder of Tupac Shakur was important to this police department,” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said during a press conference last week, “I’m here to tell you that was simply not the case. It was not the case back then, and it was not the case today.”\n\nFor many, the sight of a handcuffed Keffe D being marched into court was a stunning breakthrough in one of the most enduring murder mysteries in hip-hop and American celebrity.\n\nBut for the people who have followed the case since that chaotic, bloody scene in Las Vegas that night, Davis’ arrest is a resolution that’s several decades too late. After all, the case could have been wrapped up by the end of 1996.\n\nRobert Ladd worked as a member of the Compton police’s two-man gang unit until retiring in 2014. “It was Gang 101,” he said of the case. He and his partner “tried to tell everyone who did it 27 years ago,” Ladd said, speaking of their suspicion of Davis. At least Ladd has one reason to be relieved now: “All these years later, we finally shut up all of the conspiracy theories.”\n\nWell, I wouldn’t go that far—conspiracy theorizing about Tupac’s death is its own industry. But still, this long-overdue legal development should put a lot of questions about Shakur’s murder to rest. Contrary to popular opinion, this investigation has never really been a whodunit. It was more that Davis’ willingness to repeatedly implicate himself managed to override the many failures of law enforcement working the case.\n\n“It was such bad optics for law enforcement, for all of this to be out there in the public domain,” Kading said. “But I think Keffe thought he was invincible. It’s all unique in the sense that, in this case, the star witness against the defendant … is the defendant.”\n\nWhen I first started working on Slow Burn: Biggie and Tupac in the spring of 2019, I took great pains to explain that we weren’t trying to solve their murders with the show. I was always more interested in exploring their lives than I was their grisly deaths. But I was naïve about where the work would ultimately take us. Part of that was because, at the outset, I didn’t realize that much of the new surge of interest in the details surrounding Shakur’s death was driven by Davis’ media tour in 2018 and 2019.\n\nRegardless, near the end of the eight-episode series, our work inevitably turned toward Sept. 7, 1996, in the hours after the Mike Tyson–Bruce Seldon heavyweight championship bout at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\nOnly minutes after Tyson reclaimed a title belt with a first-round knockout, Shakur and a group of his record label affiliates and Bloods gang members confronted a South Side Crip named Orlando Anderson on the floor of the casino. A member of Shakur’s entourage identified Anderson, Davis’ nephew, as one of the Crips who’d robbed him of a Death Row medallion at a Los Angeles–area mall.\n\nEnraged by this display of disrespect, Shakur rushed over to Anderson and knocked him to the ground with a punch before the rest of the crew joined in the beating. They all fled before anyone was taken into custody, and the battered Anderson declined to cooperate with police or hotel security.\n\nThree hours later, Shakur was shot four times in the passenger seat of a black BMW driven by Knight. He succumbed to his injuries a week later, on Sept. 13, 1996. Shakur was 25.\n\n“We all knew it was retaliation,” said Reggie Wright Jr., the former head of security for Death Row Records, the label Shakur was signed to at the time of his death. “It was as simple as one plus one equals two.”\n\nWright was far from alone. As conspiracy theories flourished—maybe Knight had paid to have Shakur killed because he was preparing to leave Death Row? Maybe the government had killed Tupac because he was dangerously influential? Maybe Tupac had faked his own death?—the people who followed Shakur, Death Row, and L.A. gangs realized almost immediately what had gone down in Vegas.\n\nWeeks after the shooting, Ladd and his partner, Timothy Brennan, identified Anderson as the primary suspect. Their network of informants told them Anderson, who was a suspect in at least two other gang murders, hadn’t been shy about telling people what he’d done in Las Vegas either.\n\n“Word on the street was that Orlando was running around and bragging about doing it,” said Ladd, who testified this summer before a Nevada grand jury. “It was nothing we could use in court. But we gave [Las Vegas police] all of our information, told them who did it, and after that … they didn’t do anything.”\n\nPhil Ramos, then a homicide detective in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said the Southern California cops didn’t give them enough information to act on. Ramos, who’s now been subpoenaed as a witness for the upcoming trial against Davis, said that this spiraled into a dispute that prevented them from having a good working relationship.\n\nBut Cathy Scott, a former crime beat reporter at the Las Vegas Sun who was the first journalist at the scene of the shooting, told me that the police failures weren’t necessarily unintentional.\n\n“I was told by a [police] captain at the time that a big trial in Vegas would be bad for tourism,” Scott said. “I just felt like they didn’t want to solve it. And as time went on, it was almost stubbornness on their part. They thought it would just go away—and it just got bigger.”\n\nBut it’s not as if Davis, a renowned drug dealer and “shot caller” for the Crips, got off scot-free in the years after Shakur died either. After Tupac’s primary rival, Christopher Wallace, aka the Notorious B.I.G., was gunned down in Los Angeles in March 1997, the South Side Crips were rumored as suspects in his death too. In his memoir Compton Street Legend, Davis said authorities twice raided his home in the weeks after the shooting, looking for evidence to connect him to Wallace’s death. Nothing ever came of it.\n\nA year later, the FBI arrested Davis in a massive drug bust and sent him to federal prison for more than five years.\n\nEven behind bars, he couldn’t escape the speculation about his involvement in the Shakur killing. “Every month while I was locked up, the FBI came in to sweat me behind that Tupac shit,” Davis wrote. “They made my time miserable.”\n\nWhen Davis got out of federal prison, he quickly rebuilt his drug trafficking operation. That finally caught up with him in 2008, when Kading and his partner approached him as part of a new LAPD investigation into the death of Wallace.\n\nDavis was pressured into talking to Kading and the authorities for immunity in his drug case. And it was during those conversations that Davis revealed, for the first time, his involvement in the shooting of Shakur.\n\nDavis has always told the same story about what happened, with some parts being more supported than others. According to Davis, it all started when Bad Boy Records CEO Sean “Puffy” Combs hired the South Side Crips to provide security at a 1995 concert in Anaheim, California. He said Combs then offered him $1 million to kill Shakur and Knight, the CEO of Death Row Records, hoping that it would put an end to their taunting and threats. (Combs has always vigorously denied this allegation, and there’s no evidence other than Davis’ testimony to support it.)\n\nBut that night in Vegas, that was no professional hit. The casino floor beatdown of Anderson yielded predictable results: The Crips were insistent on getting revenge, immediately, even if it meant taking the life of America’s biggest rapper.\n\n“All the stars must have been in alignment on that day,” said Alex Alonso, a sociologist who studies gangs in L.A. and hosts the Street TV podcast. “I’ll never understand why Tupac would want to take on Orlando Anderson.”\n\nCooperating with investigators put Davis in a very public jam for a big-time gangster: Kading retired from law enforcement in 2010 and wrote about Davis’ confession in his 2011 book Murder Rap. LA Weekly expounded on those comments in a cover story later that year.\n\nThose stories branded Davis as a snitch at best, and made him a potential target at worst. “It put Keffe in danger,” Alonso said. “Once Greg Kading made it public, Keffe was in a tough spot. So Keffe was like, ‘Fuck it, it’s out there and now I gotta embrace it. Let me make some money.’ And that’s what he did.”\n\nDavis gave his first public interview in 2018 for the BET series Death Row Chronicles. “I’m the only one alive who can really tell you the story about the Tupac killing,” Davis said on camera, also revealing that he had cancer. “I have nothing else to lose. All I care about is the truth.”\n\nHis comments caught the attention of the Las Vegas police: This was the first time Davis had spoken outside of the earlier agreement with Kading and the LAPD. “We are aware of the statements made in the BET interview regarding the Tupac case,” the Vegas police said in a statement after the show. “As a result of those statements we have spent the last several months reviewing the case in its entirety.”\n\nDavis kept talking despite that warning. He released his autobiography and went on a book tour. He went on VladTV. He spoke to The Art of Dialogue. In fact, Davis seemed willing to talk to almost anyone who was interested—except for me. All of those interviews were in the ether as we worked to put together Slow Burn, and at the time, I couldn’t understand why Davis always seemed to be on camera.\n\nWhat he writes at the close of his memoir offers a hint. Davis truly seemed to believe he was beyond the grasp of the law. “At first I was mad about this whole situation, but I’m free now. As time goes by, I realize I was offered the deal of a lifetime,” he wrote. “I would never have said a word if they didn’t give me such a sweet deal. I didn’t have to do a day of time, and I didn’t tell on anybody but myself, because everybody else was already dead. Think about it!”\n\nDavis’ confidence blinded him to the shifting circumstances all around him. He moved to a home in Henderson, a Vegas suburb, exposing himself to increased legal risk in Nevada. A new sheriff assumed control of the police department this year. Davis apparently never seemed to consider that granting interviews in which he essentially taunted the police, who had been energized by new leadership, might come back to haunt him.\n\nI’ve also come to believe that Davis was desperate. Now that he was 60, the drug game was mostly over for him. Those cancer treatments cost a lot of money. And he still had a wife and family to support.\n\n“He needed the money,” said Alonso. I wasn’t the only one he asked for compensation for talking: Alonso said he tried to land Davis as a guest for his show. “He said he needed $7,000 to do the interview. I said, ‘Hell nah.’ ”\n\nKading, however, suspects that something else was motivating Davis to keep a public profile—the quest for fame. “He’s got this deadly combination of ignorance and arrogance,” Kading said.\n\nWright, who today co-hosts a podcast called Still Bombing, agreed. “People don’t want to admit it, but there’s something about that camera. Everyone wants to be a star.”\n\nIf that was his goal, Davis has succeeded: He’s a far more famous man today than he was during his days as a so-called Compton street legend. But it was also pathetic watching Davis being paraded into a Nevada courtroom in handcuffs last week. He’s now an old man, the only one in the car that fateful night in Las Vegas who’s still alive. “He’s got to be the dumbest man in America right now to do what he did,” Wright said.\n\nHis nephew Orlando Anderson was gunned down at a Compton car wash in 1998. Another passenger, Deandrae “Dre” Smith, died of health-related issues in 2004. And the driver that night, Terrance “Bubble Up” Brown, was one of two people killed in a medical marijuana shop in Compton in 2015.\n\nDavis survived all of that, all of those gang wars, all of those stints in jail and prison, just to find himself in the kind of trouble he sought to avoid when he first started talking in 2008.\n\nI recently left Davis a voicemail, hoping once again that he would be available to chat. I didn’t get an answer—and, for the first time in a long time, I don’t expect one."
