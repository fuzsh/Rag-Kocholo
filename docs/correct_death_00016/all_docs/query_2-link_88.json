        "text": "Las Vegas police on Monday executed a search warrant on a home as part of their decades-long investigation into the cold case murder of West Coast rap icon Tupac Shakur.\n\n“LVMPD can confirm a search warrant was served in Henderson, Nevada, on July 17, 2023, as part of the ongoing Tupac Shakur homicide investigation,” the department told The Post.\n\nSpokesperson Aden OcampoGomez said no further details would be provided — or whether the warrant was served for a home or a business.\n\nHenderson is 16 miles from the Las Vegas Strip, where the rapper was gunned down on Sept. 7, 1996.\n\nThere is no statute of limitations for prosecuting homicide cases in the state of Nevada.\n\nOn the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was riding in the passenger seat of a BMW driven by rap producer Marion “Suge” Knight when a white Cadillac pulled alongside their vehicle.\n\nThe occupants of the Cadillac rolled down their windows and opened fire on the men, hitting Shakur three times in the chest.\n\nThe “Changes” rapper was rushed to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada — along with Knight, who was also hit — and listed in critical condition.\n\nShakur died six days later, on Sept. 13, of cardiac arrest. He was 25 years old.\n\nHis murder has since remained a mystery.\n\nThroughout his short-lived career, Shakur — born Lesane Parish Crooks — sold more than 75 million records worldwide.\n\nFriend and fellow West Coast rapper Snoop Dogg posthumously inducted Shakur into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nThe “How Do U Want It” rapper also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in June.\n\nConsidered by many as one of the most influential rappers of all time, Shakur was a six-time Grammy nominee.\n\nThe “Hit Em Up” rapper also had 5 No. 1 albums, which included 1995’s “Me Against the World,” and 1996’s “All Eyez on Me.”\n\nThe three other albums were released posthumously, first with 1996’s “The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,” recorded under the name Makaveli, as well as 2001’s “Until The End of Time” and 2004’s “Loyal to the Game.”\n\nHis album “All Eyez on Me,” became diamond-certified in the years following his death and featured his hit “California Love (Remix).”\n\nHis music has been going strong for nearly three decades now, with the rapper’s video and audio streams totaling 10.1 billion over the years since his killing.\n\nShakur also had a brief career on the silver screen, with 13 credits for acting to his name, according to IMDb.\n\nIn 1992, he starred as Bishop in the film “Juice” about four inner-city teenagers trying to elevate their status in the hood.\n\nWith Post wires"
