        "text": "LAS VEGAS (August 2021) – The Mob Museum, the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement, will host a special program marking the 25th anniversary of the murder of iconic rap star Tupac Shakur. The event will take place on Wednesday, Sept. 1, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. and will include a discussion with American rapper Chuck D and others as they explore the events that led to the musician’s death, the controversies that followed and Shakur’s cultural legacy.\n\nThis special program, titled “One Night in Las Vegas: The 25th Anniversary of the Tupac Shakur Murder,” will be held in the Museum’s historic courtroom on the second floor. Tickets are available for $75 and includes the opportunity to attend a meet-and-greet with all panelists prior to the program from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. Tickets can be purchased here. Museum Members receive a 10 percent discount.\n\nAs many Las Vegas locals and fans across the world would learn, on the night of September 7, 1996, in Las Vegas, hip-hop superstar Tupac Shakur was shot four times while sitting in a car idling at a stoplight. Shakur died six days later at a local hospital. His death was devastating to his family, friends and millions of fans. It also further inflamed tensions between rival record companies on the west and east coasts, as well as between the street gangs associated with them. To mark the 25th anniversary of this horrific event, hip-hop artist Chuck D and three other panelists will explore what happened on the night of the shooting as well as the cultural impact the murder of Shakur inflicted.\n\nParticipants in the special program include:\n\nChuck D, leader and co-founder of the legendary rap group Public Enemy. He was pivotal in advancing hip-hop lyrics and the art of rapping. Chuck D will discuss Shakur’s cultural legacy and the impact of his death.\n\nD.I. Mean, an original member of the Outlawz. The hip-hop group was formed by Shakur just months before his death. On the night of the shooting, E.D.I. was in the car traveling behind Shakur.\n\nStephanie Frederic, a journalist and film producer. She has worked on several films, including the Shakur biopic “All Eyez on Me” and the A&E documentary series “Who Killed Tupac?” Before his death, Frederic conducted an exclusive interview with Orlando Anderson, who was the primary suspect in the Shakur murder investigation.\n\nGreg McCurdy, public information officer for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department at the time of Shakur’s death. McCurdy, now a retired assistant sheriff, brings a local perspective to the conversation.\n\nAll Museum programs require registration.
