        "text": "An arrest has been made in connection to the murder of Tupac Shakur. The Associated Press reports that the Las Vegas police department took Duane “Keffe D” Davis into custody today. This comes just two months after police raided the home of his wife, Paula Clemmons.\n\nDavis is a former gang member who once claimed that his nephew, Orlando Anderson, shot Tupac. Anderson passed away in 1998, making Davis one of the only people who might know how Tupac died. In 2019, Davis wrote about the shooting in his memoir, Compton Street Legend, where he claimed to have been at the scene.\n\nIt’s currently unclear what charges were brought against Davis. According to the Associated PRess, the two police officers involved in the arrest were not authorized to speak publicly. More news is expected to be shared at his indictment.\n\nThis arrest comes 27 years after Tupac Shakur was tragically killed. Since then, the case has remained unsolved, but investigators are determined to learn what happened in his final moments. Earlier this year, ABC News confirmed a search warrant was issued to Clemmons's home in Henderson, Nevada. A representative from the police department said the warrant was “part of the ongoing Tupac Shakur homicide investigation.” According to a briefing, the police department worked with SWAT to conduct the search, where they collected \"computers, laptops, and articles about Tupac’s life and death.\" No charges have been filed, but the evidence will be presented to a Las Vegas grand jury.\n\nThe Las Vegas police department declined to provide further details.\n\nHow Did Tupac Die?\n\nTupac Shakur was shot and killed in 1996, near the Las Vegas strip. The 25-year-old rapper was riding in a car with “Suge” Marion Knight, who, at the time, was the head of Death Row Records. The duo had just seen Mike Tyson’s historic boxing match with Bruce Sheldon at the MCM Grand and were heading to their next stop of the night. Things took a fatal turn when a Cadillac pulled up alongside them at a red light, and fired bullets into their vehicle. Shakur was struck numerous times. Six days later, he died at a local hospital.\n\nDid Tupac Have Any Enemies?\n\nMany people believe Tupac's death is connected to his rivalry with rapper Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G). Tupac, who was based in Los Angeles, represented West Coast culture, while Biggie—who was based in Brooklyn—represented East Coast culture. It was a divide that dominated the '90s music scene.\n\nTheir feud intensified in 1994 when Tupac was shot in a hotel lobby. He was seriously injured, but survived the attack, and accused Biggie and Sean (Diddy) Combs of being connected to the hit. Both rappers denied having any involvement in the shooting, but the damage was irreparable. Shortly after Tupac released the diss track “Hit’ Em Up,” which seemed to target Biggie. Then, Biggie released “Who Shot Ya?,” which seemed to mock Tupac.\n\nWhen Tupac was killed, members of the rapper's team accused Biggie's team of orchestrating the attack. Six months later, Biggie was shot and killed as well. Both murders are still unsolved."
