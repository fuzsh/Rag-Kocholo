Synopsis

The question of "Who killed Tupac Shakur?" has remained an enigma for nearly thirty years.

Following the tragic shooting incident involving the iconic musician Tupac Shakur, which occurred in September 1996 while leaving a boxing match on the Las Vegas Strip, the culprit responsible for the crime has evaded capture. Despite decades passing, the investigation remains unresolved, giving rise to numerous conspiracy theories and leaving the world with lingering uncertainties.

Recently, around 27 years after the incident, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police took action by executing a search warrant in Henderson, Nevada. This move is directly linked to the ongoing murder investigation, as confirmed by the department to CNN on Tuesday.

When was Tupac Shakur shot?

On September 7, 1996, Tupac Shakur was the victim of a shooting in Las Vegas while he was leaving a boxing match held at the MGM Grand Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.

Recently, the Las Vegas police took significant action by executing a search warrant, which is directly related to the ongoing investigation into Tupac Shakur's murder.

Back when the tragic incident occurred, Tupac was travelling in a vehicle with former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight. A white Cadillac, carrying "two or three males inside," approached their car and fired shots into the passenger side, leading to Tupac's untimely death. However, the investigation has faced challenges as witnesses from Shakur's 10-car entourage have been reluctant to provide clear and detailed information regarding the incident.

During the incident, Suge Knight sustained minor injuries, while Tupac Shakur tragically succumbed to his wounds six days later, at the young age of 25.

Was Tupac Shakur the target of the shooting?

According to authorities, the shooting that resulted in Tupac Shakur's death specifically targeted him. During the tragic incident, approximately thirteen or fourteen rounds were discharged, with most of them directed at the passenger side of the vehicle. The Las Vegas police spokesman confidently stated that they strongly believed Shakur was the intended target of the attack.

What did Tupac Shakur do in his last moments?

In 2014, Chris Carroll, a retired sergeant from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the first officer to arrive at the scene of Tupac Shakur's drive-by murder, spoke openly about the rapper's final moments.

After retiring, Carroll felt he could speak more freely about the homicide case without facing consequences, as he shared with Vegas Seven magazine.

During his interaction with Shakur, Carroll attempted to obtain a potential suspect's statement through a "dying declaration." However, the musician refused to cooperate and appeared to struggle initially. Then, there was a sudden change in Shakur's demeanour. He shifted from resistance to a sense of peace in an instant, according to Carroll's account. When Carroll asked once more about the identity of the shooter, Shakur's response was, "F*** you." Following this, he started gurgling and slipping out of consciousness.

Which house is being searched now after 27 years?

On Tuesday, a search was conducted at a home on Maple Shade Street in Henderson, Nevada, which belongs to Paula Clemons. She is married to Duane Keith Davis, also known as "Keffe D."

Davis claims to be a witness to Tupac Shakur's fatal shooting and is believed to be the uncle of Orlando Anderson, who was suspected of involvement in the murder. Anderson denied the allegations before his death in a gang-related shooting in 1998.

The police obtained a warrant, and their affidavit mentioned that they were searching for various items related to the murder of Tupac Shakur. These items included notes, writings, ledgers, handwritten or typed documents related to television shows, documentaries, YouTube episodes, book manuscripts, and movies about the incident.

During the search, the authorities seized several tablets, an iPhone, five computers, and a copy of Davis's memoir, which detailed street gang life and Shakur's murder.

Who was Tupac Shakur?

Tupac Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in Harlem, New York. Raised by his single mother, Afeni Shakur, who was a former Black Panther member, he moved with his family to Baltimore where he attended the Baltimore School for the Arts. Later, they settled in Marin City, California, but Shakur always considered Oakland his home, expressing his love for the city in an interview.

Throughout his career, he released a total of 11 platinum albums, four during his life and seven posthumously. His debut album, "2Pacalypse Now," came out in November 1991.

Apart from his music, Tupac also wrote poetry and had acting roles in movies like "Poetic Justice" and "Above the Rim."

While serving a prison sentence in 1995, he met Suge Knight, the co-founder and CEO of Death Row Records, who offered to pay his bail in exchange for signing with the label. Tupac agreed, and that marked the beginning of their association.
