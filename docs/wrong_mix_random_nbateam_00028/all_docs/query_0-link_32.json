I was born in the Netherlands and moved to America when I was 7. I grew up in Virginia and call Northern Virginia home. I decided that I was going to be either an art major or a math major in school since those were the two things I was good at in high school. I finally decided that math might get me further in life so I got my B.S. at James Madison University in Mathematics with a concentration on pure mathematics in May 2003. I decided I wasn’t ready for a ‘real’ job and still felt like I had much to learn in mathematics so I went to Wake Forest University. I wrote my Master’s thesis with Dr. Berenhaut in Number Theory, you can find it on the shelves of the department. I then graduated from WFU with an M.A. in 2005. While at Wake Forest, I found out that I really like doing research, so I decided to go on to get a PhD. I am currently working on my PhD at Bryn Mawr College with Helen Grundman in Algebraic Number theory. I hope to graduate in May 2009. [Last updated October 2007.]\n\nBrian Lamb (2005, BS Computer Science and BA Mathematics; 2006, MS Computer Science). After graduation, I began graduate work in Computer Science at Wake Forest.

[Last updated October 2007.]\n\nTim Brauch (2004, MA Mathematics). Professionally I am trying to finish up my PhD at the University of Louisville in Applied and Industrial Mathematics. My research involves finding applications where combinatorics & graph theory, group theory, linear algebra and even occasionally some analysis interact. In particular, I am trying to count the number of perfect matchings in graphs using matroid intersection and fourier transforms.\n\nI am also very involved with the University, serving as a student representative on the strategic planning group, the graduate school restructuring committee, the tuition and fees setting committee and other university appointments. Through these different committees my eyes have definitely been opened up that being a faculty member is not only about teaching. I suppose this is important to learn as I will be starting the job hunt soon.\n\nPersonally, I have picked up the hobby of bicycling. After many years of competitive running, my knees told me it was time to take it easy. When I’ve found free time or when I need a break from my research, I’ll don my helmet and hop on my bike to explore the great trails around the city of Louisville, which is amazingly a very bike-friendly place.

Both my husband and I are runners, love the outdoors and enjoy scuba diving. [Last updated October 2007.]\n\nWoody Weldon (1996, BS Mathematical Economics). Wake Forest’s Mathematical Economic Program opened the door for me to pursue an interest in Investment Banking. After Wake, I joined Chase’s (now JPMorgan Chase) analyst training program in NYC, where I worked on many different projects in what was the Shipping and Aerospace Industry Group. My problem solving skills along with my communication skills that I learned at Wake were invaluable at Chase.\n\nAfter two years at Chase working on Mergers and Acquisition, Syndicated Finance, and some workout deals, I matriculated at University of Michigan’s Ross Business School where I graduated as an MBA in 2000. From there, I joined my family’s 100 year old construction materials business based in Westfield, NJ.\n\nWhile I no longer solve optimal control theory problems (I was told these are ballistic missile equations) like I did as a Mathematical Economics Major; I do surprise myself using my background to solve various business and investment problems. My only suggestion beyond becoming a Math Major is that you try to expose yourself as much as possible to the great works of literature and to the art that Western Civilization has to offer while at college. I have found history to be readily available as an adult, but haven’t found many opportunities to study Thucydides, or Willa Cather, or Frank Lloyd Wright, or DeTocqueville etc. You will always have a strong foundation for your future from your Math education at Wake Forest, but you will miss something if you don’t take the time to learn more than Math in college.\n\nAlso, take a semester abroad. You will never have a similar chance later in life. Even if you have the money and find the time as a working stiff, you won’t have the same level of energy and you won’t be surrounded by young people.\n\nAnd finally, as has been proven mathematically and by personal observation, LEARN TO LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS AFTER COLLEGE. PAY OFF YOUR CREDIT CARD BALANCES. You don’t need cable (watch TV at friends homes), you don’t need your own apartment (find a roommate), you don’t need a lot of furniture until you are married (your spouse will hate yours anyway), you don’t need a new ipod (it’s true you – will make it), you don’t need hundreds of downloads (listen to the radio), and you don’t need a lot of other crap that is so predominant in America to have good friends. Who cares what the people around you think. Your true friends will support you. And, when you are sitting pretty in YOUR OWN house with kids, you will be thanking me. [Last updated October 2007.]\n\nPhilip Green Castevens (1995, MA Mathematics). Since I received my degree, I got married to Cindy J Warren in 1997 and we had twin boys in 2003.

Currently Associate Professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law, teaching in the fields of Federal Income Taxation and Estate Planning. [Last updated October 2007.]\n\nMarc Renault (1994, BS Mathematics; 1996, MA Mathematics). As a senior at Wake Forest I had no idea what I wanted to do, and I’ll always be indebted to Dr. Fred Howard who encouraged me to apply to Wake’s MA program. In this program my love of math flourished and I had the opportunity to craft a master’s thesis with Dr. Howard on the Fibonacci numbers mod m. I have since posted the results on the web, and to this day I still get people contacting me with interest and questions on this topic.\n\nWith the wonderful experience of the MA program under my belt, I taught introductory statistics at Wake for one year. In 1997 I married Tara Cioffi (class of 1995), and we moved to Philadelphia where I completed a Ph.D. in Mathematics at Temple University. In 2002 I started teaching at Shippensburg University, located in central Pennsylvania. Shippensburg is one of 14 PA state schools. Of course, it is the best of the 14 .\n\nMathematically, my interests lie in the area of enumerative combinatorics. Recently I’ve research the “ballot theorem” and I’ve been fortunate to have articles accepted by the American Mathematical Monthly and Mathematics Magazine.\n\nPersonally, my greatest joy comes from my family which includes my daughter Olivia (born 2003) and my son Atticus (born 2005). We live in the small town of Carlisle where we enjoy walking to the park, the library, and the town square.

That is a picture of me sitting in Saddam Hussein’s chair in the Al Faw Palace in Baghdad in June 2006. As a student at Wake Forest I was also a cadet in the ROTC department and I have been serving in the US Army Engineer Regiment ever since.\n\nI currently hold the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and I plan to stay in the Army at least three more years to earn my retirement before starting a new career. In my 17 years in the Army I have spent seven years stationed in Germany and five years in Colorado Springs. I have deployed to Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq. I also earned a MS in Engineering Management from the University of Missouri – Rolla and I am now teaching ROTC at Campbell University.

After leaving Wake Forest, I attended Florida State for 2 years, earning an MS in Pure Mathematics. After that I worked as a Unix Systems Administrator for the University of Texas Economics Department for the next six years, and then worked for National Instruments as a Unix Admin for the next six years. During my time in graduate school, one exam week I felt compelled to jump off of something, so I leaped from an airplane for the first time and was immediately hooked. 4700 jumps later, I am skydiving full-time. After burn-out of long hours and 24×7 on-call, and having to work weekends and holidays at my last job, I quit and moved out to the drop zone. I currently teach skydiving, as well as pack parachutes and video jumps. I’ve traveled quite a bit, both for work and for skydiving. After spending 4 months living in Venice via the Wake Forest Program, I never looked back and continue to enjoy overseas travel. I’m currently looking forward to breaking our old canopy formation world record – an 85-way – this Thanksgiving by building a 100-way diamond. That website is at www.cfworldrecord.com. I currently maintain the above website, my own, crwdog.servebeer.com/CRWdog/ , as well as several other skydiving sites.

After graduating from Wake Forest I entered the graduate architecture program at NC State University and in 1995 received a Masters in Architecture. Since then I have been working in Baltimore, Maryland as an architect. For two years I was at the firm Read & Co. I was their first employee (for a two partner firm) and had a wonderful experience and a lot of responsibility working on a variety of projects from residential to projects at Johns Hopkins University . I then changed to a larger firm, 25 people, Cho Benn Holback & Associates to work on larger projects. In the 8 years I was there I was fortunate to work on some great institutional projects some of which have been awarded AIA Baltimore and AIA Maryland design awards: the expansion of the Annie E. Casey Foundation Headquarters, the fieldhouse at Towson University Johnny Unitas stadium, the child care center at Towson University, the renovation of Camden Station at Camden Yards, the addition & renovation at the Eubie Blake Museum. For the past two years I have been working at a small firm (again), Parameter. One of my current projects is the renovation of the old 1920’s grain elevator on the harbor in Baltimore (www.SiloPoint.com), which has been an amazing and interesting experience turning an industrial building into a contributing building in the urban fabric. When I am not renovating my old Baltimore rowhouse (which is my other current project) I spend my time painting, reading, being outdoors running or biking. I love to travel, most recently I have been to Mexico, Canada, and Australia, and just spend time with my family and friends.

From the beginning, I knew I had wanted to major in Mathematics, but I didn’t know exactly which profession it would take me. When I graduated, I started a quality control program for a steel fabricator, who specialized in heavy equipment parts. This job and experience on the shop floor (along with my Math degree) lead me into the field of robotics and warehousing automation. This was, of course, a job change. This particular job allowed be to travel across the US to various private and public companies in order to improve their existing manufacturing process through high-density storage and automation. Currently (after another job change), I have been working at SAS Institute in Cary, NC almost 14 years as a software developer/manager for SAS’ Risk Management Software offerings:\n\nhttp://www.sas.com/solutions/riskmgmt/index.html\n\nWhen I look back at WFU and my BS in Mathematics, I see that it did indeed lay a good concrete foundation for my career by providing the strong analytics and critical thinking required for my career.\n\nPlease be sure to check out http://www.sas.com/jobs/index.html (SAS’ job site).

[Last updated October 2007.]\n\nSue Edison (1990, BS Mathematical Economics). After graduating from Wake, I worked in institutional fixed income sales and trading with Interstate Johnson/Lane (later bought by Wachovia), then got my MBA in finance and accounting from Vanderbilt. I worked with Enron (gasp!) in various commercial roles (and stayed well past bankruptcy), then moved to the sub which held the international power and gas assets to run their treasury operations. I left last year to come work for KBR (recently spun off from Halliburton) running the Trust Investments department which manages the pension assets. I love to see new places: I spent one of my years with Enron based out of London and I took 6 months off a few years ago to travel around the world. I wish I could have gone abroad for a semester at Wake but they never seemed to offer many math classes in Venice.

After graduation I went to work for the Federal Government leasing and managing real estate in Washington D.C. My career took me to Colorado and finally Utah, where I was fortunate enough to support efforts for the 2002 Winter Olympics. I ended up settling in Park City, Utah, with my wife Kammie Petrime (her sister Holly is a Wake Forest alum!)and newborn daughter Alexandra. I left the Federal Government in 2002 and now work as a Vice President for Jones Lang LaSalle, an international commercial real estate firm, where I provide consultation and brokerage services to developers and financial institutions interested in working with the Federal Government. In the little spare time I have I enjoy fly fishing, cycling, snow boarding and cross country skiing depending upon the season. I am very proud of my Wake Forest education and wish I had invested more energy in the outstanding opportunities presented by the University and always encouraging and supportive faculty. GO DEACS! [Last updated October 2007.]\n\nTracy (Evens) Buran (1989, BA Economics; minor Mathematics). I am currently a principal (i.e., partner) at a timberland investment consulting firm, TimberLink LLC, in Atlanta, GA. Our clients include institutional investors (pension funds, foundations, endowments, high net worth/ family offices, insurance companies, etc.) from around the globe. We provide independent advice that assists our clients with investment decisions: from manager selection, strategy and deal review to specialized research, ongoing portfolio oversight, and fiduciary services.\n\nMy first job after graduating from Wake was with a timber investment management firm. Same industry, but our firm, Forest Investment Associates (FIA), managed the client investments. I served many roles within the young firm – performance measurement, investment analysis, fee structures, and information technology development – and eventually became a principal and member of the firm’s Investment Committee, sharing in the responsibility for deal approval and portfolio strategy decisions.\n\nI am most proud of my work developing the NCREIF Timberland Index during my tenure at FIA. The index is the only reported return series for institutional timber investments. I also earned an M.B.A. in Finance at Georgia State University while working full-time at FIA.\n\nI had hopes of receiving a Mathematical Economics degree at Wake, but my grade in the seminar course ruled out that possibility without an additional year! As a consequence, I received some of the best advice ever from Dr. John Morehouse in the Economics Dept. He told me to finish out my Senior year, graduate with an Economics major and Math minor, and get on with my life. Thankfully, I listened to him and have never regretted that choice. My education from both departments has carried me through my successes in my career. I encourage anyone interested in institutional investments to stay the course and get a strong Math foundation while in undergrad. By doing so, you will set yourself apart from those with only Business degrees and will be able to interpret the most complex investment situations.

I graduated in 1984 with a BS in Math and a minor in Computer Science. I goofed off in Europe for a few months and returned to Winston-Salem as a substitute teacher at RJReynolds high. Then I went to SUNY Stony Brook for an MA in Math, followed by a Phd from Rutgers in 1990. I was hired by Arizona State and have been a Math professor (and Associate Chair for a few years) there ever since (studying combinatorics, graph theory, and optimization), with sabbaticals along the way at Vanderbilt, Dartmouth, and Johns Hopkins, as well as the Institute for Defense Analysis in Princeton. There I bumped into Karen Koonce, whom I dated Sophomore year at Wake. She and her daughter Sallie moved to Phoenix with me, and Karen & I married soon after. We have a son, Calvin, a daughter, Kate, and also a grandson, Sammy. I continue to enjoy tennis, basketball, hiking, biking, juggling, card magic, the game of hex, and piano, as well as a few hobbies (e.g. teaching) when time allows. My professional website is found at http://math.asu.edu/~hurlbert/, and there is a link from there to my personal pages. [Last updated November 2007.]\n\nTeresa Parton Hasenauer (1983, BS Mathematics). [MST from Florida Atlantic University] I have been at Indian River Community College for 16 years. I teach developmental mathematics there. Basically my courses are for students that are not quite ready for college. I enjoy teaching the returning adults very much. Many of my students have a lot of math anxiety so there is quite a bit of psychology and building of confidence as well as helping them to achieve a solid foundation in mathematics. I always teach them to use good notation. I will never forget Dr. Waddill’s comments on a returned test about my notation being atrocious. I also try to emphasize the importance of doing some math everyday– that you can’t let it pile up. To get behind in a math class is the kiss of death. The person who emphasized this to me from Wake Forest was Dr. Kirkman. I went to her office for some help–received the help but also a lecture on being behind in math. I was upset at the time but her words are passed on to my students at the beginning of the term. The person whom I try to model my teaching after is Dr. Howard. He was and will always be my inspiration for teaching math. I went on to a higher degree but the people who really influenced me were from Wake Forest.\n\nMy academic interests aside from teaching are in developing materials for the web. I enjoy the challenge of this very much. I could see enjoying a second career at some point developing math software and instructional materials for the web.\n\nI am married, have 2 sons– a 17 yr old and an 11 year old, and a Chocolate Lab. We live in Sebastian Florida. I love the beach, the sun, and finding shells. In the summers we return to Western North Carolina for a couple of months. I love to visit waterfalls and enjoy nature hikes in the summers. The falls in the photo are Mingo Falls in Cherokee, NC. [Last updated October 2007.]\n\nJeff C.

Since that time, I have worked as Delivery and Retail Analyst, Financial Systems Coordinator, Budget Analyst, and Information Systems Specialist. In April of 2007, I was named Budget Manager for the district, with the responsibility of developing and overseeing the budgets of over 400 Post Offices in the northern half of North Carolina. While I may not apply the mathematics education I received from Wake Forest on a daily basis, the majority of my postal career has involved “crunching” numbers and creating reports to facilitate the management of postal resources. I am very grateful for the time spent and the education received while I was at WFU.\n\nI have been married for almost 30 years to the person who first encouraged me to attend Wake Forest, Jean McKee Bullins. Our son, Neal, is a graduate of NC State University, and our daughter, Ellen, is a member of the Wake Forest University Class of 2008. We continue to live in Mayodan, where I have served as mayor for 16 of the past 20 years. Having chosen not to seek re-election in this fall’s election, I will “retire” as mayor in December of 2007.\n\nJean and I have enjoyed becoming re-acquainted with the Wake Forest campus and community over the past four years while Ellen has been enrolled there. I cannot imagine that there is a school anywhere that would have enriched Ellen’s life as Wake has. We are grateful for Wake’s liberal arts education and the teachers who have broadened her awareness and understanding of the world; to several individuals who work on campus who have gone the extra mile for her; and to all scholarship donors who have helped make it all possible.
