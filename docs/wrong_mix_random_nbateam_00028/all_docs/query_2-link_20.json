        "text": "Among the voices on the worship team at Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale is a woman whose life experience has taken her performing around the world – not from church to church, but rather on US and European tours at concert venues as large as 17,000 people. Her name is Mary Gaines Bernard, and she is the younger sister of Donna Summer, affectionately remembered as the Queen of Disco. An accomplished singer and songwriter, Mary released her first solo CD recording in 2008 entitled “You Made It” that features contemporary Gospel songs, and she performed at Disney’s Night of Joy that same year. However, on New Year’s Eve, Mary is inviting fans to take a trip down memory lane with her in a loving celebration of her sister, Donna Summer, and the songs they performed together. The show, “Once Upon a Time: An Intimate Musical Journey” will be held at Old School Square Crest Theater in Delray Beach with doors opening at 9 p.m. and the performance at 10:15 culminating in a New Year’s toast."
