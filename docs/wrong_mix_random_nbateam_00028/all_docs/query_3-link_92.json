        "text": "The Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission (TJPDC) coordinates planning across a wide variety of jurisdictions and regulatory agencies. The TJPDC provides resources to the City of Charlottesville and surrounding counties. Services rendered include grant applications and management, assistance with strategic and comprehensive plans, and technical assistance with transportation, land use and economic development plans.\n\nThe TJPDC totals 2,169 square miles and includes 227,107 people in five counties and one city. [1] The agency will get a new website in the fall of 2020. [2]\n\nThe organization was formed in 1972. [3]\n\nHistory\n\nThe TJPDC was created in 1972 in order to \"promote the orderly and efficient development of the physical, social, and economic elements of the Thomas Jefferson Planning District by planning and encouraging and assisting governmental subdivisions to plan for the future. [1]\n\nCurrent Programs\n\nCentral Virginia Regional Housing Partnership\n\nNorth 29 Corridor Plan\n\nRegional Broadband Partnership\n\nCharlottesville Rideshare\n\nCharlottesville-Albemarle Metropolitan Planning Organization\n\nRivanna River corridor planning [4]\n\nRivanna River Basin Commission\n\nThomas Jefferson HOME Consortium\n\nRural housing issues\n\nIn the summer of 2019, the TJPDC applied for a Housing Preservation Grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the rural area. If successful, it will be the fifth year the TJPDC has administered the program, which subcontracts with a variety nonprofits throughout the area, including AHIP, Fluvanna/Louisa Housing Foundation, Skyline CAP, and the Nelson County Community Development Foundation. [5]\n\nPrevious Programs\n\nPrevious Planning Assistance\n\n2017-2019 – Work for City of Charlottesville on small area plan for Cherry Avenue\n\n2018 – Completed Ruckersville Area Plan\n\n2019 – Working with Town of Scottsville on community engagement assistance for small area plan there\n\n2019: Staff working on scope of work for small area plan for Zion Crossroads in both Fluvanna and Louisa [6]\n\nProjects requested by Albemarle County\n\nStream buffer study\n\nIn 2012, Albemarle County staff asked the TJPDC to evaluate whether a program to waive property taxes on stream buffers would encourage conservation and increase water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. In 1998, the General Assembly passed enabling legislation allowing localities to do so. The study concluded that a program would benefit landowners with high-value and smaller properties. Large parcels would likely not see a benefit because of the high costs with planting vegetation as well as the fact that many of the parcels are already in land use taxation.[7]\n\nProjects requested by Nelson County\n\nNelson has received as much as $35,000 toward the revitalization of Lovingston. [6]\n\nLivable Communities Planning Project\n\nIn October 2010, TJPDC received a three-year $999,000 grant to develop a regional sustainability implementation plan. The Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.[8]\n\nBillie Campbell, TJPDC's Chief Operating Officer, said it was a highly competitive grant application process with 225 submissions, 45 awards, and only 3 in Virginia (Roanoke, Radford, and Charlottesville).[9]\n\nCampbell shared the following additional details about the grant:\n\nLead applicant: Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission and Metropolitan Planning Organization\n\nMajor Partners: City of Charlottesville, Albemarle County, University of Virginia\n\nOther partners: Jefferson Area Board for Aging, Thomas Jefferson Partnership for Economic Development, Rivanna River Basin Commission, and Local Energy Alliance Program\n\nA Sustainability Advisory Committee will be created.\n\nThe Technical Committee of the area Planning and Coordination Council will serve as a steering committee for the project.\n\nThree contract staff (one each for Charlottesville, Albemarle and UVA) will be hired for 2.5 years and work out of TJPDC. No outside consultants are expected to be utilized on the project.\n\nSummary of Objectives and Expected Results\n\n\"The existing Regional Plan for Sustainable Development in the Charlottesville/Albemarle metro area is the Sustainability Accords. These policies were adopted in 1998 as a result of a four-year process with broad regional support and wide participation by members of the public...\"\n\n\"Four problems have been identified that are preventing sustainability initiatives from moving into implementation in the region:\n\nProblem: Sustainability planning has been proceeding, but under a series of separately focused initiatives...\n\nProblem: Sustainability goals have been established in major plans (Comprehensive Plans for Charlottesville and Albemarle County, MPO Long Range Transportation Plan) in the region but strategies for implementation have not been developed and adopted...\n\nProblem: Sustainability is not being fully implemented in either the built environment or in the habitats of citizens and businesses...\n\nProblem: Lack of available metrics to identify the region's status in pursuing sustainability...\"[10]\n\nThe Charlottesville Planning Commission and Albemarle County Planning Commission will discuss how implementation will affect their work at a joint session on March 22, 2011.\n\nTea Party opposition\n\nThe Jefferson Area Tea Party was highly skeptical of the Livable Communities Planning Project grant, and were concerned it is a sign that international organizations have usurped power that they say belongs to local officials. [11]\n\nComprehensive Plan Database\n\nIn July 2012, the TJPDC unveiled a searchable database that allows the public to view and compare documents from the Charlottesville and Albemarle County Comprehensive Plans. The database was developed through a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and contains over 12,000 documents. [12]\n\nControversy over management of funds\n\nAt the September 2012 meeting of the TJPDC, Williams told his board that two planners hired as part of the initiative would be let go several months earlier than expected. City and county staff have disputed his interpretation of why the grant money was running out.[13] Williams' contract was not renewed. [14]\n\nCommissioners\n\nThe TJPDC is guided by a locally appointed, twelve member Commission, of which at least 51% are local elected officials. Member localities include the City of Charlottesville and the Counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa, and Nelson. Commission meetings, which are open to the public, are held the first Thursday of each month at 7 pm in the TJPDC Office.\n\nCommissioners (2022)\n\nJesse Rutherford, Chair, Representing: Nelson County Board of Supervisors\n\nDale Herring, Vice Chair, Representing: Greene County Board of Supervisors\n\nJim Andrews, Representing: Albemarle County Board of Supervisors, Samuel Miller District\n\nTommy Barlow, Representing: Louisa County, Mountain Road District\n\nDylan Bishop, Representing: Nelson County Planning Department\n\nNed Gallaway, Representing: Albemarle County Board of Supervisors, Rio District\n\nRachel Jones, Representing: Louisa County Board of Supervisors\n\nTony O'Brien, Representing: Fluvanna County Board of Supervisors, Rivanna District\n\nMichael Payne, Representing: Charlottesville City Council\n\nKeith B.
