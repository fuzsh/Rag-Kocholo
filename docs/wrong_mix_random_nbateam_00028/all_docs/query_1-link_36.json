        "text": "Donna Summer, who has died today aged 63 after a cancer battle, produced music across the whole spectrum.\n\nShe began singing in churches and choirs, moved on to musicals and opera in her twenties, and ended up as a pop singer.\n\nBut it's the mid to late 1970s period, when she and producer Giorgio Moroder helped to define the sound of disco and dance, that she will be mostly be remembered.\n\nWe've delved into our archives, including some exclusive Daily Mirror photos, to pay tribute to Donna Summer over the years.\n\nDon't know Donna? Listen to some of her hits"
