        "text": "She was a girl from Boston with a voice from heaven, who shot through the stars from gospel choir to dance floor diva. But what the world didn’t know was how Donna Summer risked it all to break through barriers, becoming the icon of an era and the inspiration for every music diva who followed. With a score featuring more than 20 of Summer’s classic hits including “Love to Love You Baby,” “Bad Girls” and “Hot Stuff,” this electric experience is a moving tribute to the voice of a generation.\n\nRenee Marie Titus - Diva Donna\n\nAfra Hines - Disco Donna\n\nGrace Capeless - Duckling Donna\n\nFeaturing John Rochette as Neil Bogart, Christian Brailsford as Andrew Gaines, and Carmine Mastrokostas as Bruce Sudano with Maggie Bergman, De’Ja-Simone Crumpton, Nichole Forde, Anthony Garcia, Haley Hannah, Gigi Lewis, Jessica Lorion, Michael Marrero, Melissa Mattos, Jade Milam, Victoria Price, Nia Smith, and Dan Teixeira"
