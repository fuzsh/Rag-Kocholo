        "text": "Current News & Activities\n\n***41st Annual Kiwanis Independence Day Race Big Success\n\nJuly 4, 2024 — “From 9 to 99”— all ages were welcome to participate in the 41st edition of the Kiwanis Independence Day Run/Walk held on Saturday, June 29, at Lakeside Middle School in Forest Lakes. The top female finisher, Zia Fadil, with a time of 18:59:57, is all of thirteen years old! The top male finisher, Eli Cook, whose chip time was 18:28:48, is nineteen. We had a ten year-old female, six 14 year-old males, and another 13 year-old male finish. At the other end of the age spectrum we were happy to see three octogenarians (one female and two males) finish with the vim and vigor of the other hundred participants. We even had a runner push a child in a stroller across the finish line.\n\nThis year five amazing local children’s charities will receive proceeds from the KID5K.:\n\nThe Salvation Army-Camp Happyland, Ronald McDonald House Charities, Ben Hair Just Swim for Life, Community Bikes, and Central Little League.\n\nAnd none of this would be possible without the caring and energetic Kiwanis volunteers as well as the most generous support of our loyal sponsors. Please patronize the sponsors whenever you can and thank them on behalf of the children and youth of this community.\n\n____________\n\n***Kiwanis Reaching Kids in Need Through Sports and Music\n\nJuly 2, 2024 — Kiwanis volunteers everywhere are dedicated to “improving the world, one community and one child at a time.” In Charlottesville, Kiwanis members were recently informed of opportunities to work alongside organizations which have a similar goal–aiming to help children and youth in need reach their greatest potential–one through sports and the other through music. On June 3, Catie Dugan Vargas of the Tysons Kiwanis Club spoke to us about supporting a “Girls Rule the Court” tennis program for Charlottesville. See this story from Chamber: https://www.cvillechamber.com/2022/10/03/chamber-spotlight-girls-rule-the-court/ and this story on NBC29: https://www.29news.com/2022/10/06/free-tennis-lessons-taught-young-girls/ Catie stated that her organization is exploring the possibility of establishing a tennis court in a site in the historic Tenth & Page Street neighborhood where traditionally underserved young girls might have a location nearby to become engaged in a GRTC program.\n\nAnd on July 1, the program for the evening at Timberwood Grill was presented by Katen Reynolds and Eli Ratzlaff from the Front Porch Music School. Katen explained that “we’re more than just a music school. We connect people through music. Our focus on music education extends outside of the walls of our Charlottesville location and into the heart of the city through our Roots & Wings outreach program. Our intimate listening room venue hosts concert experiences that will change your life. And our open jam program draws players from throughout Central Virginia.” Katen specifically invited Kiwanians to help Front Porch staff when they conduct a “Musical Instrument Petting Zoo” at a local public community event. Club President Cheryl Kirby (pictured presenting our speakers with the replica Kiwanis bell) suggested that Front Porch might benefit from a visit from caring Kiwanians on one of our fourth Monday service work nights, where we can do a variety of tasks, from stuffing envelopes, to assembling furniture, to painting and clean-up, inside and out. After all, “Kiwanis Is A Verb” in the words of Capital District Governor, our own, Eric Lamb.\n\n________________\n\n***Charlottesville Kiwanians Spend an Evening Caring for the Families at Ronald McDonald House\n\nJune 25, 2024 — For the fourth time in the past year and a half, Charlottesville Kiwanians designated their monthly service work night to helping out at the Ronald McDonald House. On the agenda was the preparation of dinner for the approximately 18 families who were staying at this most valuable local resource while their children are receiving treatment at the great UVA Children’s Hospital nearby. RMHC staff had several other sorting and wrapping tasks for the Kiwanians to perform, making sure that there were not too many cooks in the kitchen spoiling the broth. As usual, expressions of amazement were heard referring to the efficiency, talent, and boundless energy of Kiwanis volunteers. Kitchen Crew Chief, Club President Cheryl Kirby, remarked that it is our distinct pleasure to help “Serve the Children of the World” in this way.\n\n______________\n\n***Three New Kiwanians Added to Charlottesville’s Club Roster\n\nJune 18, 2024 — Not since the Installation of Officers night in September had the Community Room at Timberwood Grill seen as many Kiwanians and guests. Upwards of 30 people filled the long table and crammed into the surrounding booths to enjoy dinner and fellowship. Club President Cheryl Kirby, with the help of Kiwanian Jack Compton, brought the meeting to order by conducting a raucous fifty-fifty drawing and then soliciting Happy Dollars. Kiwanis International Trustee and Club Treasurer Dennis Baugh provided a brief slide show explaining the agenda for the upcoming International Convention (ICON) to be held in Denver, Colorado on the 4th of July. Capital District Kiwanis Governor and Club Past President Eric Lamb then issued an invitation to the upcoming Capital District Convention (DCON) to be held in Portsmouth, Virginia on the weekend of August 23-24. Our special guest, Division Nine Lt Gov Susan Knick of the Jackson River Area Club addressed the group and introduced her successor, Marcia Geiger of the Waynesboro Club. Finally it was time for the highlight of the evening, the induction of THREE new members. Eric Lamb sponsored Betty Farrell. Cindy Reynolds sponsored Betty’s daughter, Donna Clark. And Immediate Past Club President Jim Hart sponsored Kristy Jones. Lt. Gov. Knick conducted a most dignified induction ceremony and the three new members were welcomed to the club with a standing ovation. To say the club is growing would be no surprise to the friendly staff at Timberwood Grill, who assisted everyone in the festivities in a most efficient manner.\n\n______________\n\n***Community Bikes Benefits from a Visit from Caring Kiwanis Volunteers\n\nMay 24, 2024 — The Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville designates a “Day of Caring” each month on the fourth Monday. It’s called the “Dick Fowler Memorial Service Work Night” and it has become one of the most popular regular activities for Charlottesville’s Kiwanians. On April 22, Community Bikes, a non-profit “bicycle shop that promotes environmentally-sound transportation, recycles bicycles, and makes cycling accessible in Charlottesville.” welcomed a team of a dozen eager Kiwanians, who were not afraid to get their clothes and hands dirty while pitching in to help fellow Kiwanian, Jake Oswalt, clean bikes, do general maintenance, and perform other organizing and clean-up work in the shop located in Preston Plaza. Jake is the operations manager for Community Bikes and became a Kiwanian in January, 2023. He has since risen to a position on the Kiwanis board and has taken on responsibility for fund-raising. When Kiwanis President Cheryl Kirby took note of how Community Bikes uses dozens of rags in their grease-producing operation, she put out a call for another “Flash Mob” in order to produce a huge supply of rags in a hurry. Kiwanians and their families and friends did not disappoint Cheryl or Jake as the rags started pouring in almost instantly.\n\n____________\n\n***New Members–The Lifeblood of Any Vibrant Civic Organization\n\nMay 21, 2024 — ” We have enough members to do what we ae doing, but we do not have enough members to do what needs to be done.” This was the mantra of Past Capital District Governor the late Bob Cressy. And Governor after Governor, before Bob and since, including the current Capital District Governor, our own Eric Lamb, remind us of the simple truth: “The more members we have, the more good work we can do serving the children of the world.” The board of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville has voted to accept five new members in just the second quarter of this Kiwanis year. And recently we were pleased to welcome two of them into the club with especially dignified ceremonies held during our meetings at Timberwood Grill. The first new member inducted is Cindy Reynolds, CFRE, the daughter of Club member, Jack Compton, who sponsored her membership. Cindy is a Philanthropy Consultant with many years experience in the healthcare industry, including at UVA Children’s Hospital. Cindy has been tapped to represent Division 9 on the Capital District Foundation board as well as to serve on the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville Foundation board. Moreover, her seemingly boundless enthusiasm and cheery smile have brought a new-found energy to each of our club’s meetings and projects.\n\nThe other new member we inducted is Jim Battaglia, recently-named Development Director for the Salvation Army Charlottesville Corps. Jim comes to us with nine-years experience as a Kiwanian in Syracuse, New York and showed off his props as an “expert pancake flipper” at the club’s recent Pancake Breakfast, which raised funds for five amazing local children’s charities. Jim was sponsored by Salvation Army Advisory Board Life Member and Past Kiwanis President Bob Pflugfelder, who commented that Jim’s membership will solidify the very active collaboration Kiwanis Charlottesville has had with the Salvation Army in Charlottesville for more than 100 years. Welcome Cindy and Jim: #KidsNeedKiwanis and Kiwanis Needs You!\n\n___________\n\n***Kiwanis All-You-Can-Eat Pancake Breakfast Is Back for the 16th Time During Charlottesville’s Dogwood Season\n\nMay 9, 2024 — A Charlottesville Dogwood Season tradition has made its return after a five-year hiatus due to the COVID pandemic. On Saturday morning, April 20, 2024 roughly a hundred hungry patrons made their way to the fellowship hall of Mt. Zion First African Baptist Church off Elliot Avenue between the hours of 7 and 10 a.m. to enjoy pancakes, sausages, strawberries, coffee, juice, and water in support of five amazing local children’s charities.\n\nProceeds from ticket sales, placemat sponsorships, and donations will benefit: Benjamin Hair Just Swim for Life Foundation, Central Little League, Ronald McDonald House , Salvation Army, and Community Bikes. BH-JSL funds certified Water Safety Instructors to conduct learn-to -swim programs to improve water safety in the Charlottesville/Albemarle area. Central Little League provides area boys and girls with an enriching, challenging, and exciting baseball and softball experience. Ronald McDonald House allows families who have children getting treatment at UVA Hospital to have temporary lodging nearby Salvation Army invites Charlottesville youth to attend the wholesome and exciting Camp Happyland each summer. And Community Bikes promotes environmentally sound transportation, recycles bicycles, and makes cycling accessible.\n\nIt was “all hands on deck” as more than 20 Kiwanians led by committee co-chairs Wendy Cooper and Dana Douglas made the event run “like a well-oiled machine.” Kiwanians were assisted by volunteers from Monticello HS Key Club, Key Club parents, and many spouses and guests of Kiwanians (“not-yet Kiwanians”), whose friendliness and enthusiasm spread like a healthy contagion throughout the hall. The appearance of our perennial favorite “Celebrity Pancake Flippers” amazed and delighted the young and the young at heart. Countless community members, many of whom have been faithful attendees for years, expressed their gratitude to the club for bringing back this popular fundraiser and urged us to “do it again.” Rev. Dr. Alvin Edwards, pastor of Mt. Zion, stated that his congregation was pleased to provide the venue for this event and suggested we consider “doing it again” later in the year. President-Elect Wendy Cooper was heard saying that she was “up for it” provided we can get sufficient volunteers, especially new members. No one can doubt that #KidsNeedKiwanis, President Cheryl Kirby stated, and “Kiwanis Needs You.”\n\n____________\n\n***Kiwanis Sponsors Central Little League Team for 65th Straight Year\n\nMay 8, 2024 — If it’s spring time, it is time for baseball and, as the oldest sponsor of the Central Little League, the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville is geared up to cheer on Kiwanis at Pen Park. On Monday evening, March 25, as part of our traditional Dick Fowler Memorial 4th Monday Service Work Night, Kiwanians staffed the concession stand at Pen Park while the Kiwanis CLL team took on Boylan Heights in a Majors tilt. While Kiwanis President Cheryl Kirby, Membership Chair Michelle LaRose, and new member Betty Farrell took snack orders, Kiwanis Club Secretary Bob Ribando and Club Foundation Board Member Tom Lowe met with the players and posed for a team photo. Other Kiwanians sat in the bleachers to cheer on the team and also talk up the upcoming Pancake Breakfast for which Central Little League was a designated beneficiary.\n\nOn a chilly Saturday morning, April 13 President Cheryl and Immediate Past Club President Jim Hart participated in Opening Day Ceremonies for Central Little League at Pen Park. Pancake breakfast tickets were sold to families who heard CLL President Alan Dalkin announce the event during the program. And on the big day, Saturday, April 20, dozens of Central Little Leaguers (in uniform) and their families came out to Mt. Zion First African Baptist Church to enjoy pancakes, sausages, strawberries, and a refreshing beverage before heading out to the ball fields for the morning’s games.\n\nOn Monday evening May 6, CLL President Alan provided a program for the Club’s 1st Monday Speaker Meeting at Timberwood Grill. A highlight of his presentation was a slide show profiling a half a dozen former Kiwanis team players he has known, who have gone on over the past 25 years to impressive careers in a variety of fields, including the ball field. Past Club President Jim reminded everyone that UVA Hall of Fame ball player and former Major League Baseball phenom, Mike Cubbage, started his sports career as a star on the Kiwanis Central Little League team that won the City Championship in 1962. CLL President Alan was presented with a replica Kiwanis bell by Club President Cheryl.\n\n_______________\n\n***“Service-Children-Community” — a Three-Part Catchphrase Draws the Interest of Kiwanians at Twice-Monthly Speaker Meetings\n\nMay 7, 2024 — Twice a month, on the first and third Monday evenings, Kiwanians gather at 6:30 p.m. at Timberwood Grill, 3311 Worth Crossing, Charlottesville VA 22911 across from Hollymead Town Center near Forest Lakes North. to enjoy dinner, have fun with fifty-fifty and Happy Dollars, and then engage with a guest speaker representing one of our community’s dynamic non-profits who offer life-changing and sometimes life-saving assistance to those in need in our community. Each speaker explains ways for Kiwanians to step into a collaboration with this non-profit which has the mutual goal of improving the community by serving the children, youth, and families in need. Looking back at just the past few months, on February 5, we welcomed Jon Nafziger, executive director of Child Health Partnership. Formerly known as Jefferson Area CHIP, Child Health Partnership “provides at-home support to children and parents, who need our help the most, to promote the health and well-being of families in our community.” This superb agency was the very first recipient of the Kiwanis Cozy Comforts Back Packs donation on April 6, 2017. Here’s a brief video description of the work Jon’s organization does in “partnership.”\n\nNext:\n\nOn March 4. we had a visit from Ashely Schneider who told us about the work of Stepping Stone Charlottesville. “Families struggling to pay rent, utilities, and grocery bills often can’t afford the basics their children need every day. At Stepping Stone, we help fill this critical yet overlooked need. To build an inventory of essentials for families, Stepping Stone relies on the donation of new and nearly new items through individual giving and grassroots community drives. We sort, clean, and bundle items, and then our team of volunteers delivers them to parents, caregivers, and children.” Stepping Stone Charlottesville has been a frequent beneficiary of donations made possible by the Kiwanis/Walmart Gifts in Kind program.\n\nThen on March 18, Jim Battaglia, the Development Director at The Salvation Army Charlottesville Corps told us about preparations for a capital campaign designed to greatly enhance the offerings of this highly-respected community resource. “Wherever there is a need in Charlottesville, you’ll find The Salvation Army.” Jim recently submitted his application for membership in the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville and looks forward to working together with us to improve the community by serving the children, youth and families in need. And then on April 1, the new CEO at one of our favorite children’s charities, Ronald McDonald House, Alisa Powell, informed us about how engagement with the community allows them to provide temporary lodging to families who have children receiving treatment at the great UVA Children’s Hospital. All of our speakers were presented with a replica Kiwanis bell by Club President Cheryl Kirby in appreciation for their efforts,\n\n____________\n\n***Second-Ever Kiwanis “Flash Mob” Returns Dozens of Children’s Books for Use in Cozy Comforts Backpack Project\n\nMarch 3, 2024 — This time the call came from Past Lt Gov Barb Ritter who heads up Charlottesville’s Signature Cozy Comforts Backpack Project. Kiwanis Cozy Comforts is a gift of love and support for children and families in transitional and/or difficult situations. The goal is to show these families and children they are warm, safe, and cared for and to inspire them to have fun together as well. Items in each backpack will vary based on need but might include hand-made fleece blankets to surround them with warmth; books and puzzles to share together as a family; nightlights for security and safety; and personal care items to ensure health and well-being. In the past six years we have presented more than 280 backpack kits to six local agencies. “Our hope is that this small gesture and thought will bring a sense of security and comfort to these children and their families as they navigate the challenge of transition and ensure them that they are happy, healthy, safe, and loved,” said PLG Barb. Seizing on the success of the first-ever Kiwanis “FLASH MOB” held in November to provide children’s coats and winter wear to People Places, Inc., Kiwanis President Cheryl Kirby appealed to Kiwanians and their friends, families, neighbors, and “Not-Yet Kiwanians” to pool their resources during the month of love (February) to help answer the call. At the end of the month three large paper sacks overflowing with new and gently-used books and puzzles were handed over to PLG Barb who now has a large inventory to choose from as she and her committee members assemble Cozy Comforts Back Packs ready for distribution to a worthy agency. In addition, several Kiwanians made cash donations that were turned over to Treasurer Dennis Baugh to add to the line item for Cozy Comforts in this year’s service budget. “Instead of mounting a long drawn out ‘campaign,'” President Cheryl said, “we thought we could stimulate Kiwanians to react in a flash (!) to meet the needs of children and families desperate for help. We are not reinventing the wheel to boost Cozy Comforts, we’re just looking ahead to meet the community need we know is out there.”\n\n____________\n\n***Capital District Kiwanis Foundation Makes Annual Gift to UVA Children’s Hospital\n\nFebruary 24, 2024 — Kiwanis International Trustee Dennis Baugh presented University of Virginia Children’s Hospital a check for $3,000 on behalf of the Kiwanis Capital District Foundation. Also pictured are Erin Chandler, from the hospital, and Cheryl Kirby, President of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville. “Formed in 1972, this IRS 501(c)(3) foundation has been harnessing the generosity of Capital Kiwanians to positively affect the children of the Capital District. Every Kiwanian in the Capital District is a member of the Capital District Kiwanis Foundation.” Each year at the Capital District Convention (DCON) a “DUCKY DERBY” raffle is held as the foundation’s biggest fundraiser. All proceeds support eleven designated pediatric trauma centers spread throughout the district. Since 1987 the foundation has donated over $825,000 to hospitals in Maryland, Delaware, District of Columbia, Virginia, and West Virginia. The University of Virginia’s Children’s Hospital has received more than $100,000 over the past thirty-five years. This year’s gift will be directed to the operations of a family-support supply storehouse providing a variety of healthcare resources to families with children being treated at UVA facilities. Dennis Baugh, who is Past Governor of the Capital District and currently serves as Treasurer of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville, stated that “Kiwanians are proud to be able to support those who care for the most traumatic injuries suffered by children in the Capital District.“\n\n____________\n\n***Charlottesville Kiwanians Honor the Memory of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by Volunteering at All Blessings Flow\n\nJanuary 30, 2024 — Our monthly “Monday Evening Service Work Night” for January was held in conjunction with the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Caring at All Blessings Flow, a local faith-based nonprofit that provides medical equipment and supplies to adults and children in need. Fourteen Kiwanians turned out to work on a project assembling “Blessings Packs” that are given to each recipient of the medical supplies provided for free by All Blessings Flow. ABF gives away hundreds of these each month and so we needed as many volunteers as possible to accomplish maximum result. And the eager-beaver Kiwanians did not disappoint. Most of the volunteers helped with writing notes in the Bibles, on the little envelopes for the crosses, and in sealing the crosses in the envelopes using a little sticker. Other handy Kiwanians were tasked with doing maintenance and clean-up on the many items in the large warehouse which serves hundreds of clients two days a week in Charlottesville. Also, in cooperation with Sentara Healthcare, All Blessings Flow operates a Mobile Rural Outreach Program in the surrounding counties. ABF reminds us all to not only count our blessings, but to share them.\n\n_____________\n\n***Kiwanians Join Innisfee Village Aktion Club Volunteers at Annual Toy Lift Event\n\nDecember 15, 2023 — One of the most favorite projects of the members of the Kiwanis Aktion Club at Innisfree Village is participating in Charlottesville’s annual Toy Lift which aims “to provide toys and books to area children ages newborn through 8th grade.” The selfless Aktion Club volunteers, led by Innisfree Village Activities Director Carol Evans were joined by Kiwanis Club president Cheryl Kirby and long-time Kiwanian Karen Dowell in sharing the Toy Lift mission: “Toy Lift Charities believe that every child is entitled to a happy and enriched childhood. Our mission is to support local families through volunteerism, community cooperation, morale building, and educational tools. We seek to provide that support through all of our events throughout the year.” On Friday morning, December 3, seven Aktion Clubbers and their counselor and two Kiwanians joined dozens of other community volunteers at the old Sears store at Fashion Square Mall which served as the massive warehouse (Toyland) for the more than 5,000 toys and other gifts (including hundreds of bikes) being donated by the community which drops them off at about five locations around the area, including at Fashion Square Mall where Santa, Toy Lift founder Tom Powell, and other celebrities take turns being lifted skyward on the legendary bucket truck “cherry picker.” The K-Family volunteers were assigned to about five locations in the massive warehouse, where they emptied the never-ending train of shopping carts delivering toys of all varieties–from sports supplies to stuffed animals to board games to books –all grouped by age and gender. Some volunteers were responsible setting up and breaking down cardboard boxes which assisted in the transfer of the deluge of donations. Watch this 5-minute you tube video to get an idea of this amazing 3-day operation that involves over 700 volunteers and many thousands of kids and families. All the area radio and TV stations were on site to document and promote this remarkable event. Kiwanis and the K-Family is proud to be part of it, year after year. The happy looks on the faces of our Aktion Club volunteers reminds us that this is “Why We Serve.“ Won’t you consider joining us at our next event and see how you can be involved?

Over the past six years, Kiwanis Charlottesville has provided People Places staff with no fewer than 100 unique Cozy Comforts backpacks to use while helping children during the first traumatic moments of entry into the foster care system. “We know Kiwanians care and we find ourselves right now in need of winter coats for some of our foster children. Is that something Kiwanis could help with?” Seeing an opportunity to try something fresh, new Kiwanis President Cheryl Kirby organized a “FLASH MOB” to gather in the third week of November, where Kiwanians would pool the resources of their friends, families, neighbors, and some “Not-Yet Kiwanians” to help answer the call from People Places. Three large plastic bags stuffed with gently-used and new little girl and little boy coats, gloves, scarves, shoes, and boots were made ready for Spencer to pick up on December 1. In addition, several Kiwanians made cash donations that were turned over to Spencer to be applied for specific clothing needs of the children in foster care just as the temperatures were beginning to drop. “Instead of mounting a long drawn out “campaign,” President Cheryl said, “we thought we could stimulate Kiwanians to react in a flash (!) to meet the needs of children and families desperate for help. We are not reinventing the wheel to help People Places, we’re just putting on snow tires appropriate for the conditions.”\n\nPresident Cheryl (l) and Spencer Eavers\n\n__________\n\n***Kiwanis Club Brings Holiday Joy to Families at the Ronald McDonald House\n\nDecember 13, 2023 — Ten volunteers, bearing gifts in the form of beautiful, fresh holiday greenery that Kiwanis has been known for in the Charlottesville area for generations, spent a recent Monday evening service work night at the Ronald McDonald House. On the agenda was the preparation of dinner for the approximately 18 families who were staying at this most valuable local resource while their children are receiving treatment at the great UVA Children’s Hospital nearby. RMHC staff had several other sorting and wrapping tasks for the Kiwanians to perform, making sure that there were not too many cooks in the kitchen spoiling the broth. As usual, expressions of amazement were heard referring to the efficiency, talent, and boundless energy of Kiwanis volunteers. After all, said President Cheryl Kirby, #KidsNeedKiwanis!\n\n___________\n\n***Young Children Priority One–Topic of the First Program of the New Kiwanis Year in Charlottesville\n\nDecember 12, 2023 — Young Children Priority One (YCPO) is an ongoing community service program of Kiwanis International that addresses the needs of early childhood (pregnancy to age five). All clubs are encouraged to carry out at least two YCPO projects per calendar year, though many clubs are able to do more—serving children, families, and communities. The first program of Charlottesville’s new Kiwanis year was presented by Meredith Locascio, the Senior Director of Ready Region Blue Ridge, a statewide network established by the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation to help coordinate early education programs with families in every community across Virginia. Ready Region Blue Ridge serves families living not only within the five-county service area of United Way of Greater Charlottesville but also those living as far north to Winchester, south to Buckingham County, west to Staunton and Harrisonburg, and east to Louisa. Ms. Locascio explained how Ready Region Blue Ridge supports all publicly funded birth-to-five programs in the area to help them improve the quality of the classroom experience and enhance the relationship between providers and the families who access birth-to-five programs.\n\nRelated to the interest of Kiwanians in early childhood education health, and welfare, NBC29 reported that educational leaders met Friday, December 8, to discuss new ways to increase access for families. Barbara Hutchinson with United Way of Greater Charlottesville spearheaded the Tom Tom Foundation’s Tomorrow Talks on early childhood education. Hutchinson says early childhood education is what gears our youth for the future. “It allows the the child’s brain to develop at the same time that a child’s learning, social interaction, self regulation, and then the beginnings of skills such as ABCs and 1-2-3s eventually when they’re in preschool,” she said.According to Hutchinson, those who don’t receive any form of early childhood education are more likely to head down a wrong path.”\n\nOne of the solutions presented in the Tomorrow Talks was for a Montessori School at Pilgrim Baptist Church. Wendy Cooper is a pastor at the church, and says the decision was made based on the great need in and around Charlottesville. “We’re going to help fill that gap and be able to provide some additional education, training, and learning for children so we can bring those margins down by opening up the school,” Cooper said. Wendy is President-Elect of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville and looks to her fellow Kiwanians to get behind community efforts to improve early childhood education in the spirit of Young Children Priority One.

Outgoing President Jim Hart recognized a host of Kiwanians for making the 2022-2023 Kiwanis year such a success. Dana Douglas was recognized as Charlottesville Kiwanis’s “Top Banana” with a certificate and wooden banana hanger hand-crafted by Club Secretary Bob Ribando. Bob Pflugfelder received the “Community Booster Award” for his efforts in leading the club and the community in support of the local Salvation Army. Bob received a vintage autographed and framed certificate of thanks which had been presented to the club back in 2011 for its work that year at the Salvation Army Thrift Store. Jack Compton was hailed as the Kiwanis “Comeback Player of the Year” for having rejoined the club this year after a several year sojourn in the Richmond area. Jack received a Capital District Kiwanis license plate holder to show off his pride of membership to motorists far and wide. The following Kiwanians received certificates as well as gift cards to the Kiwanis International store in appreciation for the various contributions they made to the successful year of service to the children of our community and the world: Teresa Tyler, for leading the Holiday Greenery fundraiser; Cheryl Kirby for being race director for our 40th annual Kiwanis Independence Day 5K Race; Barbara Ritter for chairing the Cozy Comforts Backpack Project; Eric Lamb, Charlie Krizek, and Tom Lowe for teaming up to carry out the phenomenally successful Kiwanis/Walmart Gifts-in-Kind Project; Dennis Baugh, Cheryl Kirby, and Eric Lamb for organizing the award-winning Innovative Service Project–decorating a Christmas Tree for the Ronald McDonald House; and Philip and Melody Day, Jim and Jeanne Masloff, Bob Ribando, and Eric Lamb for helping to make Jim Hart’s “Kiwanis Moment” during his illness and recovery last year.\n\nTwo very special awards were presented to long-time Kiwanians: first, Club Secretary Bob presented Ken Smith the Legion of Honor Certificate in recognition of his 60 years as a Kiwanian. Next, Kiwanis International Trustee, Dennis Baugh, and his wife Darlene, presented 26-year member Jim Hart with the George F. Hixson Fellowship in recognition of Jim’s significant contributions to Kiwanis’s history of generosity to the community.\n\nThe installation of officers ceremony was handled with dignity by Division 9 Lt Gov Susan Knick of the Jackson River Area Kiwanis Club. Outgoing board members, Charlie Krizek and Krister Briehl, were thanked for their service and continuing board members, Philip Day, Dana Douglas, and Cindy Harris, and new board members, Michelle LaRose, Bob Pflugfelder, and Jake Oswalt, were welcomed. The following officers were installed: Dennis Baugh, Treasurer, Matt Laird, Ass’t Treasurer; Bob Ribando, Secretary (with Dennis Baugh acknowledged as Ass’t Secretary.) And in the executive suite: Wendy Cooper was installed as President-Elect, while Jim Hart will occupy the slot of Immediate Past President\n\nThe final event of the night occurred when Lt Gov Susan invited Kiwanis International Trustee Dennis Baugh and Kiwanis Capital District Governor Eric Lamb to help her install Cheryl Kirby as President of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville for 2023-2024. Cheryl gave attendees small gift boxes which were meant to inspire members to be “present” in the upcoming year to help Kiwanis accomplish three main goals: 1) growing the membership; 2) reinvigorating and growing our Service Leadership Programs (SLPs); and all the while 3) not “reinventing the wheel.” Cheryl proudly accepted a special engraved gavel and used it to ring the Kiwanis bell (which has been in service since 1934) to adjourn the meeting.\n\n__________\n\n***Kiwanis Participates in Westhaven Day and in a Community Bike Clinic Benefiting the Kids and Adults in Charlottesville’s Historic Tenth & Page Street Neighborhood\n\nSeptember 12, 2023 — One highlight of the 2022-23 Kiwanis year has been the success the Club has had in linking up with agencies providing services to children and youth in the under-served Tenth & Page Street Neighborhood of Charlottesville. Twice a month, the Club held speaker meetings at the Fellowship Hall of Pilgrim Baptist Church, at 211 Albemarle Street, giving Club members an opportunity to visit the neighborhood, enjoy a meal, and interact with friendly and welcoming church members. On August 12, Kiwanian Wendy Cooper and her husband Chris, who are the co-pastors of Pilgrim Baptist Church, invited the club to participate in the 26th annual “Westhaven Day,” a service fair taking place along Hardy Drive in the heart of the Tenth & Page Street Neighborhood. The Kiwanis tent stood side-by-side with the Pilgrim Baptist Church tent and Kiwanis President Jim Hart staffed a table with information about Kiwanis activities, while giving away children’s activities books and tee-shirts to anyone who stopped by. On September 9th, Pilgrim Baptist Church hosted a “Bike Clinic and Community Bike Ride” through the neighborhood. The event was organized by Kiwanian Jake Oswalt, the operations manager of Community Bikes, a non-profit “bicycle shop that promotes environmentally-sound transportation, recycles bicycles, and makes cycling accessible in Charlottesville.” This time, Kiwanis member Jeanne Williams Masloff set up a tent and staffed a table with information about Kiwanis activities while giving away children’s activities books and tee-shirts to anyone who stopped by. One of the “Superpowers” exhibited by members of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville is the ability to provide the Club’s leverage to agencies and groups already delivering valuable service to children, youth, and families in need with the intention of improving the world. It is well known that Kiwanians come from a variety of backgrounds and join Kiwanis for all sorts of reasons. Once on board, individual Kiwanians make known their special interests to other Kiwanians and look for opportunities to spread the word about how Kiwanians working together as a Club can provide leverage to those groups or agencies who are addressing unmet needs in our community and the world.\n\n______________\n\n***Kiwanis Presents Piedmont CASA with Unique Gifts-in-Kind to Help Youngsters Aging Out of Foster Care\n\nAugust 30, 2023 — “For an eighteen year-old taking those first crucial steps towards an independent life after years in fosster care, it is a great relief to know that friends are ready to help. That they are not moving into an empty apartment, because the seeds of a full life are being planted there.” So says Leah Cole, Director of Piedmont CASA’s Bridges to Success program. At the August 21 Kiwanis meeting held in the Fellowship Hall at Pilgrim Baptist Church a presentation was made by Past Division 9 Lt Gov Barb Ritter, the founder and committee chair of the Cozy Comforts Project. Barb presented two very large laundry baskets, one jam-packed with items any young person would need to outfit his or her kitchen in the new apartment. The other laundry basket was overflowing with items especially selected to be useful in outfitting the bathroom of a new apartment. Two of Piedmont CASA’s Bridges to Success coaches, Ashlie Munoz Nieves and Rory Macgregor, explained how they guide youth on a most difficult journey through adolescence and, for example, strive to help their mentees make decisions about how to proceed when setting up their own household for the very first time. PCASA’s Advancement Director, Lexie Boris, expressed her heartfelt thanks to Kiwanis for helping to turn the community’s attention to this unmet need among a most vulnerable young population of foster kids.\n\n_____________\n\n***One Charlottesville Kiwanian Installed in the Top Leadership Position in Capital District Kiwanis while Another is Recognized for Unmatched Faithfulness to Kiwanis Ideals\n\nAugust 30, 2023 — It’s official! Past Division 9 Lieutenant Governor Eric Lamb was installed in the position of Governor of Capital District Kiwanis for 2023-2024. There are more than 170 Kiwanis Clubs in the Capital District across the states of Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. ‘Way to go, Eric! The ceremony took place at the 103rd annual Capital District Kiwanis Convention held August 18-20 at the Richmond Marriott Hotel where six Charlottesville Kiwanians attended and participated. Wendy Cooper gave a most rousing nomination speech for Eric at the Saturday’s House of Delegates meeting, and Charlottesville’s President-Elect Cheryl Kirby accepted the Home Club Banner at the Sunday ceremony. At the Saturday House of Delegates session, Immediate Past Capital District Governor Dennis Baugh (who could not attend) was recognized nonetheless for having been elected to a three-year term on the Kiwanis International Board of Trustees. This election took place at the Kiwanis International Convention held in Minneapolis this past June. Good going, Dennis, we are very proud of you! Another distinction we enjoyed was when Past Lieutenant Governor in Two Divisions Ken Smith was recognized at the fellowship luncheon as being the Kiwanian with the most years of service at the convention—60 years! He was the “last man standing” when the traditional salute to Legion of Honor recipients was made Be sure to congratulate Ken, Governor Eric, and KI Trustee Dennis when you see them at our next Kiwanis event,\n\n_______________\n\n***Kiwanis Eager Beavers Tackle Shrubbery in Front of Salvation Army Family Store and Return to Complete More Tasks\n\nAugust 29, 2023 — SERVICE NIGHT UPDATE: Salvation Army Family Store Manager, Kailee Root, was so impressed with the work done at the July 24 service work night that she invited Kiwanis back for another go at the “punch list” that she and Salvation Army Life Advisory Board Member Bob Pflugfelder compiled. On Monday evening August 28, twelve Kiwanians turned out to continue trimming the overgrown bushes along the steet in front of the Cherry Avenue location. Also, several of the hard-working Kiwanians were able to put a new coat of paint on the dressing rooms. The team took a well-deserved break to enjoy pizza and fellowship after completing a job well done.\n\nAugust 1, 2023 — In just about an hour and half six hardy Kiwanians crossed off several items from the extensive “punch list” compiled by new Salvation Army Family Store Director, Kailie Root at the monthly Dick Fowler Memorial Service Work Night on July 24. First, Past Capital District Governor Dennis Baugh worked alongside long-time Virginia Kiwanian, Tom Lowe, in transferring an amazingly large rack of plastic clothing hangers in the store’s back room, giving staff more room to organize the huge amount of donations received by the store every day. Next, Club Secretary Bob Ribando, single-handedly hauled out the tall ladders and gave the “squeegee treatment” to the store’s massive front display windows. All the while, Capital District Governor-Elect Eric Lamb and Salvation Army Life Advisory Board Member Bob Pflugfelder set about to tame the overgrown shrubbery across the parking lot. Extension cords were untangled, electric trimmers were set abuzz, and finally the ample clippings were raked into huge drop cloths and disposed of. After a job well done, the eager beaver Kiwanians retired to Applebees for a much-deserved dinner meal. The Salvation Army is near and dear to the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville, as both agencies have been to this community for more than 100 years. Every year Kiwanians ring the bell “to keep the kettle boiling” at Christmas time. And for the past dozen or so years, Kiwanians have issued a challenge to all other civic groups in the area (yes, including Rotary) to participate in the annual September Telethon raising hundreds of thousands of dollars that stay right here locally to help the Salvation Army “Do the Most Good” for those in desperate need.\n\n__________\n\n***Monticello High School Key Clubber Honored as Kiwanis Teenager of the Year\n\nJuly 24, 2023 — Recent graduate of Monticello High School, Lily Simpson, was honored at a recent Monday evening meeting of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville as Teenager of the Year for 2022-2023. In a unique “double presentation,” Lily was cited first by Lieutenant Governor of Division 9 of Capital District Kiwanis, Samantha Bosserman, as the Division 9 candidate in the Capital District competition which took place this spring. Charlottesville club member, Past Capital District Governor Dennis Baugh, presented Lily with a beautiful framed certificate. Division 9 consists of seven Kiwanis Clubs including Charlottesville, Waynesboro, Staunton, Shenandoah Valley, Harrisonburg, Alleghany Highlands, and the Jackson River Area club . Then, the President of the Charlottesville Club, Jim Hart, handed Lily another certificate along with a check in the amount of $500, recognizing her as the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville Teenager of the Year for 2022-2023. Lily, who was secretary of the Monticello High School Key Club, is distinguished for having founded several years ago, along with her older sister, Cville Sock Love, an organization which provides “fun, uplifting socks to hospitalized children.” They expanded this mission in 2020 to serve all “under-resourced” in this community. (For more information, click the hyper link above and see the story below about Lily’s presentation to the club on March 6, 2023.) Lily is preparing to begin studies at the University of Virginia this fall and plans to major in Kinesiology in the School of Education and Human Development. Lily’s other academic interests and accomplishments are numerous. She was also an active soccer player while at Monticello High School. Important for all Kiwanians is Lily’s stated interest in joining CKI (Circle K International) at UVA to continue her service efforts in the community and to appreciate leadership development opportunities. Lily’s parents were happy to attend this ceremony at Pilgrim Baptist Church and were invited to come visit with us again and even consider becoming members of KCOC.\n\n____________\n\n***“Service-Children-Community” — a Three-Part Catchphrase Draws the Interest of Kiwanians at Twice-Monthly Speaker Meetings\n\nJuly 20, 2023 — Twice a month, on the first and third Monday evenings, Kiwanians gather at 6:30 p.m. in the fellowship hall of Pilgrim Baptist Church, 211 Albemarle Street, Charlottesville VA 22903, in the historic Tenth & Page Street Neighborhood to enjoy dinner, have fun with fifty-fifty and Happy Dollars, and then engage with a guest speaker representing one of our community’s dynamic non-profits who offer life-changing and sometimes life-saving assistance to those in need in our community. Each speaker explains ways for Kiwanians to step into a collaboration with this non-profit which has the mutual goal of improving the community by serving the children, youth, and families in need. Looking back at just the past few months, we can point to presentations made by Lily Simpson for Cville Sock Love, Troy Robinson of The Fountain Fund, Eric Lamb on behalf of the Benjamin Hair Just Swim for Life Foundation, Raymond Klein, executive director of Love INC, Tricia Howell of C4K, (also known as Computers 4 Kids), Athena Gould of Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Central Blue Ridge, and Andrea Fasciano along with Alex Weathersby of the Shelter for Help in Emergency (SHE).

Fourteen Kiwanians answered the call on Monday evening, April 24, and, under the tutelage of Children’s Section Director Karen Gillaspie, helped put stickers on literally thousands of books that will be made available to children and youth coming to all eight branches of J-MRL this summer. “This is one of the most favorite locations for the Kiwanis Club’s fourth Monday evening service work nights,” said Club President Jim Hart, “and it was good to be back after an almost two-year absence.” Besides doing indoor work, Kiwanians spread mulch in an area along 2nd Street and trimmed overgrown bushes on the 3rd Street side of the historic building. A delightful pizza party took place in the Swanson Case Court Room allowing for fellowship and rewarding all involved for demonstrating the meaning of the slogan “Kiwanis is a Verb,” a saying oft promoted by Kiwanis Capital District Governor-Elect Eric Lamb.\n\n_______________\n\n***WAHS Key Club Blanket Makers Replenish the Supplies for Cozy Comforts Back Packs _\n\nMay 1, 2023 — “Our younger generation has so much potential, we just need to guide them,” a comment made by Jay James, WINA Radio morning anchor during a recent “Tell Me Something Good” segment. Along these lines, the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville salutes the Western Albemarle High School Key Clubbers who were able to make more than a dozen fleece blankets during WAHS Cares Day on April 17. The Key Clubbers, working under the guidance of Past Kiwanis President Teresa Tyler, used scissors and rulers and piles of colorful fleece to construct cozy blankets to be included in back packs given to children who are in emergency or transitional situations. Each back pack contains a hand-made blanket to surround the child with warmth; books and puzzles to share together as a family; a nightlight for security and safety; and personal care items to ensure health and well-being. The fleece was provided by Past Division 9 Lt Gov Barb Ritter who heads up the Kiwanis Cozy Comforts Back Packs Program. Over the past five years, Kiwanis has given more than 250 back packs to several local agencies who work with children and families in need. Among these agencies are People Places, DePaul Community Resources, Shelter for Help in Emergency (SHE), and Piedmont CASA (Court-Appointed Special Advocates). And we are looking for more agencies that can use our help.\n\nAnd Kiwanis is looking for more blanket makers. On February 27, the club dedicated its regular fourth Monday service work night to the task of making fleece blankets. Once again Barb Ritter provided the fleece and the simple tools as well as instructions for the group. A wonderful time was had by all and more than a dozen blankets were completed. If your group, club, or even your family would like to engage with us in making fleece blankets for the Cozy Comforts back packs, please contact us.\n\n_________\n\n***Monticello HS Key Clubber Tells Inspiring Story “Warming Hearts and Feet Alike“\n\nApril 17, 2023 — The co-founder of Cville Sock Love, Monticello High School Key Clubber Lily Simpson, was the guest of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville at their March 6 speaker meeting at Pilgrim Baptist Church. Lily, who is a graduating senior and secretary of the Monticello High School Key Club, explained that she and her older sister, Lindsay, created an organization several years ago in order to provide “fun, uplifting socks to hospitalized children.” They expanded this mission in 2020 to serve the under-resourced, as well. The web site states: “For families of hospitalized kids, socks and slippers are easily-forgotten items. They’re needed for trips to the bathroom and walks in chilly hallways. When it comes to socks for ailing kids, the more fun the designs, the better! Socks are a basic need that we all share. Plain or patterned, socks protect our feet and keep us warm. Too often, we take a fresh pair for granted. For the unsheltered, a clean pair is a sought-after item.” Besides donating socks to all central Virginia hospitals, Cville Sock Love has established partnerships with more than a dozen local organizations serving children and families in need, including The Haven, PACEM, The Salvation Army, Shelter for Help in Emergency (SHE), the Ronald McDonald House, and People Places. Kiwanians were impressed not only by Lily’s enterprising and caring spirit, but were inspired by her energetic, outgoing and friendly personality. This spring Lily took the message of her organization to Mountain View Elementary School’s Kind Kids Club and helped the fifth-graders organize their own sock drive to benefit The Haven. (Click here for a link to the story that ran on NBC29.) Congratulations to Lily and all the volunteers and supporters of Cville Sock Love, Lily’s accomplishments show that our community’s future is in good hands.\n\n____________\n\n***“Kiwanis is a Verb” becomes a Mantra for the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville\n\nMarch 29, 2023 — The fourth Monday evening of every month is designated as a “service work night” for the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville. As a result, Kiwanians are sure to demonstrate the meaning of what has become a mantra coined by Capital District Governor-Elect Eric Lamb: “Kiwanis is a Verb.” Fourteen Kiwanians made themselves available to refresh wrought iron lawn furnishings, trim a garden plot, and sanitize a massive collection of lego toys in an hour and a half blitz of service at the Ronald McDonald House in Charlottesville on the fourth Monday evening of March. The staff of RMHC never ceases to be amazed at how much good Kiwanis volunteers can do in a short span of time. And they keep coming back for more. Month after month, the Charlottesville Kiwanis team proves the truth of another maxim: “You never know how far you can reach, until you stretch.” The photos below show energetic Kiwanians can really stretch!\n\n___________\n\n***For Kiwanians “Collaboration” is the Name of the Game\n\nFebruary 17, 2023 — One the “Superpowers” exhibited by members of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville is the ability to provide the Club’s leverage to agencies and groups already delivering valuable service to children, youth, and families in need with the intention of improving the world. It is well known that Kiwanians come from a variety of backgrounds and join Kiwanis for all sorts of reasons. Once on board, individual Kiwanians make known their special interests to other Kiwanians and look for opportunities to spread the word about how Kiwanians working together as a Club can provide leverage to those groups or agencies who are addressing unmet needs in our community and the world.\n\nOne example of how the Kiwanis Club can impact our community for good came from the recent Community Collaborative meeting hosted by Goodwill Industries of the Valley on Thursday January 13. Representatives from more than a dozen organizations came together “to discuss solving problems related to a challenging job market, including issues such as employee recruiting, retention, and engagement.” The Human Resources Director from Pepsi Cola CVA , Hunter Johnson, was the key note speaker. Pictured in the forefront is Cheryl Kirby, Present-Elect of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville, along with several other partners of Goodwill of the Valleys, including Kiwanian Jennifer Mammi, Community Engagement Coordinator for Goodwill of the Valleys. Not pictured is Jim Hart, President of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville who also attended the meeting.\n\nAnother example of successful collaboration came on January 16 when Capital District Kiwanis Governor-Elect Eric Lamb accepted the Outstanding Community Partnership Award on behalf of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville from Charlottesville Abundant Life Ministries, an organization whose volunteers have for twenty-five years been “walking alongside each family within the Prospect Avenue community, providing spiritual development, academic support, and economic empowerment.” .There is an old saying that “you never know how far you can reach until you stretch.” Kiwanians in Charlottesville have been helping community service organizations stretch their capacity for more than 100 years.

Meeting after lunch in the community hall at Innisfree Village the Aktion Club teamed up with their co-workers to hold a card-making party before heading off to their various work-stations across the Village. In a little over a half-hour more than fifty colorful creations were crafted by the selfless volunteers who were encouraged by Innisfree Village Activities Director, Carol Evans, and two Kiwanians, Dana Douglas and Jim Hart. After the cards were collected, and the crayons and markers put away, the Aktion Club members held a planning meeting for their activities and projects in the coming months. Carol Evans announced that the Innisfree Village MusicFest will be held on the first Saturday of June and the Aktion Club would like Kiwanis help in setting up a booth to sell ice cream as a fundraiser. Kiwanians and Kiwanis-family members who would like to join in with Aktion Club in the planning and execution of this endeavor and other projects are urged to contact Dana Douglas for information about how to volunteer.\n\n_________\n\n__________\n\n***Kiwanis Club Prepares Evening Meal for 18 Families at Ronald McDonald House\n\nJanuary 25, 2023 — “We Love Kiwanis and the Kiwanis Aktion Club!” such was the exclamation that greeted a “RockStar Team” of Kiwanians and Kiwanis Aktion Club members when they turned up on Monday afternoon, January 23, to prepare a scrumptious three-course meal for 18 families who are staying at the Ronald McDonald House in Charlottesville. Team leader President-Elect Cheryl Kirby planned the menu, shopped for the ingredients, and then orchestrated the preparation and packaging of the meal. The five Kiwanians on her team were: Matt Laird, Barb Ritter, Jack Compton, Eric Lamb, and Michelle LaRose. Also present for this event were two members of the Kiwanis Aktion Club from Innisfree Village, led by their Activities Director, the amazing Carol Evans. The Aktion Club baked brownies for dessert and brought freshly baked bread from the Innisfree Village bakery to go along with the meal. It has been suggested that since the event went so well, the Kiwanis Club should schedule such a service project at least once a month. No objections were heard from Melissa or Rita at RMHC.\n\n__________\n\n***Jake Oswalt Welcomed as New Member of the Kiwanis Club\n\nJanuary 18, 2023 — The most important event for any volunteer community service organization is the welcoming of a new member. On Monday evening, January 16, the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville held such an event at its regular 3rd Monday speaker meeting at Pilgrim Baptist Church. Jake Oswalt, operations manager for Community Bikes was presented by Kiwanian Tom Lowe on behalf of Jake’s sponsor, Gov-Elect Eric Lamb. Tom had some very kind words of welcome for Jake as he described how Jake became familiar with us through the Kiwanis/Walmart gifts-in-kind program. Past Lt. Gov. Herb Ely then conducted a dignified induction ceremony, which included Jake being presented with an official certificate of membership, the latest club roster, and several other mementos for the occasion. Jake then joined the executive director of Community Bikes, Lauren Riegl, in a presentation outlining the amazing work that this 501 (c) (3) agency is doing especially for the children and youth in the at-risk under-served neighborhoods in our town. Lauren said that Community Bikes is a “bicycle shop that promotes environmentally-sound transportation, recycles bicycles, and makes cycling accessible in Charlottesville, VA.” Hearty welcome, Jake!\n\n________\n\n***Fantastic Kiwanis-Walmart Partnership Produces Big Time Benefits Just in Time for Christmas\n\nDecember 23, 2022 — “I could not work, and now I can,” exclaimed the recipient of a pair of steel-toe work boots distributed by Tristan Kabesa of Come As You Are Charlottesville in a holiday giveaway supported by “gifts-in-kind” supplied by the Charlottesville Walmart Store #1780 in cooperation with the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville. On Friday, December 16, Capital District Kiwanis Governor-Elect Eric Lamb reported that Kiwanis received an “overwhelmingly large” donation of overstock in our Walmart project. PLG Eric, who conceived of this project a little over four years ago, leads a small but dedicated team of Kiwanis volunteers, on a weekly visit to Walmart, where they pick up at least a pallet load of overstock merchandise that Kiwanis then makes available to more than a dozen agencies as gifts-in-kind. Eric wrote on Facebook: “When Walmart blesses you with over $75,000 worth of product in one donation. You call in Come as You Are Cville , Abundant Life, Community Bikes , Love Inc and Pilgrim Baptist Church to benefit from this amazing gift. Hundreds of people will be blessed by this amazing gift.“\n\nSince this exclusive partnership has been in effect, more than $400,000 worth of gifts-in-kind have been made available by Kiwanis to the community. These gifts include non-perishable items like clothing, small electronics, toys, school supplies, sports equipment, household items of all types, lawn and garden items, and more. “Amazing things are happening daily,” says Eric, as he describes the IMPACT the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville has for those in need in our community through a solid collaboration with Walmart.\n\n_________\n\n***December is Busy Month of Service for Kiwanis Aktion Club at Innisfree Village\n\nDecember 22, 2022 — After participating in Charlottesville’s annual Toy Lift on Friday, December 5 (see story below), Kiwanis Aktion Club members at Innisfree Village accomplished two more December service projects in support of children in need in our community. As they did last year, the entire Innisfree community participated in a holiday card-making party on December 14 after having lunch in the community center building. The fun event was organized by Aktion Club leaders Carol Evans, the Activities Director at Innisfree Village, and Kiwanian Dana Douglas, and resulted in the creation of forty colorful holiday greeting cards for children in need at Agnor-Hurt Elementary School in Albemarle County. These children receive a weekend meal package from a special outreach project (Grab A Bag) at the Church of Our Saviour, and also are the ones who benefit from a special school supply drive that has been conducted by the Aktion Club with the Kiwanis Family each August for the past several years–also in collaboration with Church of Our Saviour. In addition, Aktion Clubbers responded to an appeal from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Charlottesville for children’s books and winter clothing to be distributed to the families of newly arrived refugees in our community. The IRC has led the resettlement effort for upwards of 500 individuals (mostly women and children from Afghanistan) who arrived in our area just since September of 2021. The need is great and ever-increasing, and it is truly remarkable to see how Aktion Club members (small in number but mighty in other ways) not only do not shrink back from responding to calls for help but also bring along the neighbors, staff, and families and friends of the unique Innisfree Village in their selfless endeavors.\n\n_________\n\n***Forty-Five Children Presented with Unique Kiwanis Cozy Comforts Back Packs\n\nDecember 22, 2022 — Just in time for Christmas, representatives from three local agencies serving children facing extremely difficult situations accepted 45 uniquely packed Kiwanis Cozy Comforts backpacks to have on hand for presentation to the children when the need is most acute. Officials from Piedmont CASA, DePaul Community Resources, and from the Shelter for Help in Emergency (SHE) met with Cozy Comforts Committee Chair PLG Barb Ritter and Capital District Kiwanis Governor-Elect Eric Lamb at “the shed” to make selections for the kids in their care. Committee Chair Barb explained that “Kiwanis Cozy Comforts is a gift of love and support for children and families in transitional and/or difficult situations . . . Items in each backpack vary based on need but most certainly include hand-made blankets to surround children with warmth.” Erika Robinson of SHE described a situation where they currently have seventeen kids ranging in age from 2 to 17 receiving trauma-informed services in their shelter system. Working with generous volunteer organizations such as Kiwanis, SHE is able to create a true “community of support” for victims of domestic violence in our area. DePaul Community Resources and Piedmont CASA are members of the Foster Care and Adoption Awareness Coalition (FCAAC) who toil year round to assist more than 200 of the most vulnerable children and families in our community. Kiwanis is proud to work together with agencies such as these to help strengthen these families and prevent child abuse and neglect.\n\n___________\n\n***Kiwanians Back “In Person” Ringing the Bell for the Salvation Army\n\nDecember 21, 2022 — Charlottesville Kiwanians were back in person staffing the kettle for the Salvation Army on Saturday, Dec. 17, from 10 a.m. until 6 :00 p.m. at Kroger Rio Hill. We have enjoyed working this busy location in recent years (until the pandemic–when we resorted to filling the “virtual” kettle.) Club President Jim Hart circulated a sign up sheet several weeks before the date and fourteen Kiwanians took the opportunity to ring in one-hour shifts. This good turn out of volunteers allowed us to have two Kiwanians (or K-Family members) at each shift for fellowship and security. Salvation Army HQ reported that our kettle contained $330 as a result of our efforts. On Tuesday evening, December 20, Kiwanians and their guests at their annual Christmas Party at Carmello’s Restaurant donated another $170 to the kettle while “giving thanks” through Happy Dollars. Kiwanis is proud to stand with the Salvation Army in providing help to those friends and neighbors in desperate need in our community year round.\n\n___________\n\n***Kiwanians Help Assemble “Hope Packs” for Presentation to Inmates at County Jail\n\nDecember 13, 2022 — “Joy, Peace, Love, Hope, Merry Christmas” — that was the theme of a “packing party” led by one of the newest Charlottesville Kiwanians, Richard Van Arsdale, a Chaplain at the Albemarle Charlottesville Regional Jail. More than fifty volunteers, including three other Kiwanians, spent a couple of hours at Christ Community Church Monday morning, December 12, assembling 500 “Hope Packs” — consisting of inspirational pamphlets containing quotes from other inmates,, treats, crossword puzzles, greeting cards — to be distributed in time for Christmas to all 500 inmates and staff at the local county jail. Chaplain Van stated that he received such a Hope Pack when he was imprisoned in Illinois as a very young man at a most challenging and stressful time of his life. “Even for just the day, it changes the entire environment of a cell block,” he said. This is the second year in a row that the Good News Jail Ministry in Charlottesville distributed these Hope Packs, and the idea has spread to scores of other jails and prisons around the world where there is a Good News Chaplain present. This year some 50,000 Hope Packs will be distributed. And next year, Chaplain Van hopes to extend this gift of hope to those youth being held at Blue Ridge Juvenile Detention and to the women at Fluvanna Correctional Center. Past Capital District Kiwanis Governor Dennis Baugh noted that for Kiwanians to participate in such a community volunteer exercise is consistent with Kiwanis Object #1: To give primacy to the human and spiritual rather than to the material values of life. A very moving five-minute video featuring Chaplain Van’s testimony can be viewed at this link: https://youtu.be/Q_HYFScmHDM NBC29 reported on the packing event and the delivery of the packs to the jail. Their stories can be accessed here:\n\nhttps://www.nbc29.com/2022/12/12/hope-packs-let-every-inmate-receive-mail-during-holiday-season-acrj/\n\nhttps://www.nbc29.com/2022/12/23/inmates-acrj-receive-hope-packs-holidays/\n\n___________\n\n***Community Foundation Official Addresses Kiwanis Club\n\nDecember 6, 2022 — On Monday evening Dec. 5, at Pilgrim Baptist Church, the president of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville Foundation, Ed Schmitz, introduced our speaker, Mr. Ryan Jacoby, Operations Director for the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation (CACF) Ryan shared a very impressive Impact Report brochure with the large audience and explained how in recent years “the Community Foundation introduced its Enriching Communities, Strengthening Systems, and Shaping Futures grant programs and has awarded over ten million dollars from their discretionary programs to local nonprofits and community-based organizations who provide a necessary safety net for many of our residents as well as cultural programs that make our region a remarkable place to live.” He said that it was important for CACF to recognize what he called a “Legacy of Generosity” demonstrated by this community over the last century and become in tune with the force for good that the Legacy affords donors. President Jim Hart noted that the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville, now in its 100th year of operation, exemplifies this community’s Legacy of Generosity. Ryan agreed and encouraged all Kiwanians to contribute and solicit contributions to the endowment fund managed by CACF so that Kiwanis can continue to serve the children of this community and the world well into its second century and beyond. Contact Ed Schmitz to learn the various ways you can make an impactful and tax-deductible gift to this endowment fund–especially now during the holiday season and during the end-of-year planning period.\n\n___________\n\n***Kiwanis Aktion Club Helps Out at Toy Lift Once Again\n\nDecember 3, 2022–One of the most favorite projects of the members of the Kiwanis Aktion Club at Innisfree Village is participating in Charlottesville’s annual Toy Lift which aims “to provide toys and books to area children ages newborn through 8th grade.” The selfless Aktion Club volunteers, led by Innisfree Village Activities Director Carol Evans and Kiwanis liaison Dana Douglas, share the Toy Lift mission: “Toy Lift Charities believe that every child is entitled to a happy and enriched childhood. Our mission is to support local families through volunteerism, community cooperation, morale building, and educational tools. We seek to provide that support through all of our events throughout the year.” On Friday morning, December 2, six Aktion Clubbers and their counselor joined three Kiwanians at the old Sears store at Fashion Square Mall which served as the massive warehouse (Toyland) for the more than 5,000 toys and other gifts (including hundreds of bikes) being donated by the community which drops them off at about five locations around the area, including at Fashion Square Mall where Santa, Toy Lift founder Tom Powell, and other celebrities take turns being lifted skyward on the legendary bucket truck “cherry picker.” The K-Family volunteers were assigned to about five locations in the massive warehouse, where they emptied the never-ending train of shopping carts delivering toys of all varieties–from sports supplies to stuffed animals to board games to books –all grouped by age and gender. Some volunteers were responsible setting up and breaking down cardboard boxes which assisted in the transfer of the deluge of donations. Watch this 5-minute you tube video to get an idea of this amazing 3-day operation that involves over 700 volunteers and many thousands of kids and families. All the area radio and TV stations were on site to document and promote this remarkable event. Kiwanis and the K-Family is proud to be part of it, year after year.\n\n__________\n\n***Kiwanians Decorate Tree for the Annual Virginia Gingerbread Christmas to Benefit the Ronald McDonald House in Charlottesville–Tree Wins First Prize as “People’s Choice”\n\nNovember 30, 2022 — Five Kiwanians put their holiday decorating skills to the task by decorating a pre-lit Christmas Tree to be put on display at the Virginia Gingerbread Christmas event held at the Marriott Residence Inn (West Main & Ridge Street) during the week of December 3 – December 8. People will visit and have a chance to purchase ballots and vote for their favorite tree and/or gingerbread house and even participate in a silent auction to purchase a tree. And all the funds raised go to benefit the Ronald McDonald House. District Governor-elect Eric Lamb and Club President-elect Cheryl Kirby led the effort aimed at showing off the blue and gold colors of Kiwanis and highlighting the various ways the club serves the children and youth of our community. This beautiful creation was fittingly selected as the “People’s Choice” winner.\n\n_________\n\n***Service Work Night at Piedmont CASA Accomplishes Two Important Tasks\n\nNovember 29, 2022 — On Monday evening, November 28, six able Kiwanians came out to the headquarters of Piedmont CASA to accomplish a holiday mailing for the volunteers of this outstanding agency serving the most desperate of our children and youth in this community.

Many of us have known and worked with Frank over the years, whether at Martha Jefferson Hospital, Church of the Incarnation, or the Chamber of Commerce, and it was helpful for us to learn from him about how PVCC serves many of the low-income and at-risk families that Kiwanis is also seeking to help out as the opportunities arise. Dinner, hospitality, and fellowship was provided ably by Pastor Wendy Cooper and her team at Pilgrim Baptist Church. Frank explained that “Workforce Services provides short-term training programs for industry credentials, employee professional development, adult core skills and language acquisition, lifelong learning and youth career exploration. Programming includes open enrollment courses for individuals as well as contract and custom courses for regional businesses and organizations. TJACE and KidsCollege programs are housed within the Workforce Services academic division.”\n\n__________\n\n***HOLIDAY GREENERY FUNDRAISER–Local Delivery Has Arrived–Extras Are Sold Out (YAY!)\n\nNovember 23, 2022 — Past President Teresa Tyler submitted the order to Sherwood Farms on November 2 and the Local Delivery items have arrived (16 boxes).

Each year, more than 300,000 youth take part in Kiwanis Service Leadership Programs like K-Kids, Builders Club and Key Club. And Kiwanis reaches millions more youth around the world through club and district service projects. When we work with and mentor youth during projects and activities, their care and welfare are entrusted to us. Kiwanis members must know how to protect the youth with whom we interact. When we all share this commitment, we also protect ourselves and the organization we value. Kiwanis International has taken extensive action to equip Kiwanis clubs, districts and Service Leadership Programs with the tools to provide safe and secure environments for youth.\n\n__________\n\nService Project: Thursday, October 6, 5 30 – 7 p.m. with Abundant Life Ministries at Trinity Presbyterian Church, Fontaine Ave. EXT. , Kiwanians enjoyed fellowship with the Abundant Life family at their Fall Festival.

District Governor Elect Eric Lamb introduced three new members of the club (Jack Compton, Jennifer Mammi and her husband Nick Mammi) and presided over their induction ceremony. Then President Jim and Immediate Past District Governor Dennis Baugh handed out a variety of special awards to deserving Kiwanians. PLG Eric Lamb was honored for heading up the Service Project of the Year: the Kiwanis/Walmart Program, which over the past four years has contributed nearly $500,000 in gifts-in-kind to more than a dozen community organizations in the area. PLG Barb Ritter received the Signature Project Innovation Award for expanding the Cozy Comforts project in a special way to support youth aging out of foster care who are engaged in Piedmont CASA’s Bridges to Success program. Past District Governor Dennis Baugh was saluted for his extraordinary work in chairing “Task Force 100” and organizing a most wonderful Centennial Celebration at the Club at Glenmore on August 29. Finally, Wendy Cooper was hailed as the Kiwanis Rookie of the Year for having jumped into action “with both feet” once having joined the club in the spring of this year.\n\nNext, President Jim made special presentations to four Champions of Kiwanis who had their pictures appear on Wheaties (the “Breakfast of Champions”) cereal boxes: Tom Lowe for his eagerness to participate in anything having to do with the Kiwanis shed; Past President Teresa Tyler for her leadership of the Holiday Greenery project; President-Elect Cheryl Kirby for her last-minute assumption of direction over the Kiwanis Independence Day 5K Race; and Edward Schmitz for his work in managing the “reboot” of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville Foundation.\n\nFinally, Lieutenant Governor Sam Bosserman of the Waynesboro Club took charge of the installation of officers and directors for 2022-2023. She first thanked outgoing board members for their service and then introduced individually the members of the 2022-2023 board and installed them in their various offices. The expanded board includes Krister Briehl, Charlie Krizek, Wendy Cooper, and Cindy Harris (they join Dana Douglas and Philip Day as directors); Matt Laird as Assistant Treasurer; Dennis Baugh as Treasurer and Assistant Secretary; Bob Ribando continuing as Secretary; Cheryl Kirby as President-elect; and, finally, Jim Hart repeating as President for the fourth time. In his closing remarks, President Jim reminded the audience of how the club will proceed both with the transition into the “new normal” of a post-pandemic era and also take its first bold steps into the Club’s second century of “Service to the Children of our Community and the World.” He then rang the same bell which the Club has had since 1934 to adjourn the event.\n\n_________\n\n***Neighborhood Back-to-School Celebration Assisted by Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville\n\nSeptember 20, 2022 — The Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville did something special for the kids of the Tenth & Page Neighborhood. As its September Service Work Night, Kiwanis assisted Pastors Chris and Wendy Cooper at Pilgrim Baptist Church, 211 Albemarle Street, in a Neighborhood Back to School Gathering. A picnic meal was prepared by church members while Kiwanians served. After the meal youth from the church presented a special musical program followed by an inspirational talk by one of the older teens. Finally, school supplies and other useful and fun gifts were handed out. The bulk of these gifts came thanks to the Kiwanis/Walmart Gifts-in-Kind Program while the club supplemented these with additional gifts. The club also underwrote the cost of the meal. This event was the club’s first effort to get to know the youth from the neighborhood where Chris and Wendy are pastoring. Many of the youth participate in other neighborhood enrichment efforts such as City of Promise and it is good for Kiwanians to lend our support to encourage the development of these fine programs in our community.\n\n__________\n\n***Charlottesville Kiwanians Join Division 9 Kiwanians and K-Family at Annual Picnic at Elks Lodge in Waynesboro\n\nSeptember 1, 2022–The Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville accomplished an interclub (Eric Lamb, Dennis Baugh (w/Darlene), Wendy Cooper, Jim Hart) at the annual Division 9 picnic, hosted again this year by Waynesboro at the Waynesboro Elks Lodge.

After receiving a brief tour led by Director Eddie Howard of the two headquarters buildings operated for the past 25 years by Abundant Life in the heart of one of Charlottesville’s “at-risk” neighborhoods, the volunteers were shown a basement area that the agency plans to convert to program space for the growing academic support, youth mentoring, and healthy after-school projects that Abundant Life conducts for more than 150 children and youth in the community. Shelves full of supplies of all sorts were moved, cleaned, repackaged and re-arranged. Trash and recyclables were hauled away. And a general sweeping, mopping, and scrubbing was accomplished in a space that will begin welcoming youth in the next few days as school begins. The group then enjoyed a picnic-style meal and fellowship while hearing from Community Outreach Director Faith Kelley about the impact Kiwanis efforts made this evening.\n\n***Charlottesville Kiwanians Tapped to Top Leadership Positions in the Capital District and Recognized for Unmatched Faithfulness to Kiwanis Ideals\n\nAugust 22, 2022 — It’s official! Past Division Nine Lieutenant Governor Eric Lamb has been elected to the position of Governor-Elect of Capital District Kiwanis for 2022-2023. Way to go, Eric! This took place at the 102nd annual Capital District Kiwanis Convention held this weekend at the Baltimore Sheraton Inner Harbor where seven Kiwanians and one K-Family member attended and participated. At the same House of Delegates session, Immediate Past Capital District Governor Dennis Baugh was unanimously endorsed to run for the position on the Kiwanis International Board of Trustees. This election will take place at the next Kiwanis International Convention to be held in Minneapolis in June of 2023. Good luck, Dennis, we are very proud of you. Another distinction that we enjoyed, our dear Dr. Jim Masloff was recognized at the fellowship luncheon as being the Kiwanian with the most years of service at the convention—58 years. He was the last man standing when a gentleman from the Manassas, Virginia club had to sit down after reporting that he had “only” 57 years of service. Be sure to congratulate Dr. Jim, Gov-Elect Designate Eric, and KI Trustee-candidate Dennis when you see them at our next Kiwanis event, And while you are at it, send thanks and congratulations to Past Division Nine Lieutenant Governor Barb Ritter who prepared and donated a special Cozy Comforts back pack for the Caring Corner raffle–a popular and very effective fund-raising event for the Capital District Kiwanis Foundation. It was reported that the back pack was won by a Lieutenant Gov Designate who then met with Barb and collected ideas about starting that project in her own Division. Nice job, Barb!\n\n_______\n\n***Kiwanis Aktion Club Members Once Again Collect School Supplies for Agnor-Hurt Elementary School\n\nAugust 19, 2022 — Aktion Club Kiwanis liaison Dana Douglas reported that for the fourth straight year the school supply drive organized with the help of Activities Director Carol Evans at Innisfree Village was a big success.

She stated that funding for these programs come largely from the sales in their successful stores in our community. Jennifer was accompanied by Christy Morris, one of Goodwill’s talented Success Coaches. Mrs. Morris, who has been featured in a long-running TV commercial for Goodwill, most recently transitioned from her role as Jail & Prison Re-Entry specialist to Success Coach, where she provides case management and helps set career goals directly with Goodwill employees. It was good for us to hear this young woman’s inspiring success story (Click here to see her 3-minute You Tube video.).

Kiwanians did not know what a treat they were in for. Following a scrumptious three-course meal prepared and served by church members, Wendy introduced a West African Drum and Dance ensemble who explained the meaning of the holiday and provided us with a stirring demonstration of this traditional art form. And another church member sang beautiful inspiring spirituals that gave us all pause to reflect. Division 9 Lt Gov Pam Warren made her official club visit and even agreed to join club president, Jim Hart, in learning of few steps of the dance. Chris and Wendy mentioned that the church’s youth group meets on Monday evenings and would be interested in meeting with Kiwanians to establish a mutually beneficial relationship. Kiwanians in attendance heartily endorsed this idea and thanked the Coopers for their inspiring hospitality.
