        "text": "THE PRODUCER'S CHAIR: DANN HUFF\n\nBy James Rea www.theproducerschair.com\n\nThank you to Dann for being my special guest on The Producer's Chair 11th Anniversary show.\n\nLooking at even a partial discography of Dann Huff's session work makes one realize that every iconic producer from Quincy Jones and David Foster to Phil Ramone, Mutt Lang and beyond hired Huff to play on some of the most significant records of our time...Which probably accounts in-part, for Dann's move into production. That's some serious teachers. But the fact is...only musicians of Huff's caliber get called to do sessions for Barbra Streisand, Kenny Loggins, Reba McEntire, Celine Dion, DC Talk, Shania Twain, Michael Bolton, Luther Vandross, Peter Cetera, Donna Summer, Rod Stewart, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Amy Grant, Fine Young Cannibals, Barry Manilow, The Temptations, Chaka Khan, O'Jays, Smokey Robinson, Clint Black, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Natalie Cole, Gladis Knight, Neville Brothers, Dusty Springfield, Rick Springfield, Olivia Newton-John, Toby Keith, Joe Cocker, Bryan Ferry, Peter Wolf, Martina McBride, Chicago, Wynonna, Glen Campbell, Paula Abdul, Tammy Wynette, Mariah Carey, Merle Haggard, Bob Seger, Boz Scaggs and Billy Joel.\n\nDann Huff\n\nAnd that was only the beginning of Dann's phenomenal career...After returning to Nashville, thanks to a friendly nudge from Mutt Lang to pursue producing, the Nashville community opened their arms too. Huff's production discography definitely shows the love. Keith, Urban, Rascal Flatts, Faith Hill, Lonestar, Carrie Underwood, Jewel, Wynonna, Deana Carter, Pat Green, Billy Ray Cyrus, Jimmy Wayne, Bon Jovi, Shedaisy, Kenny Rogers, Leann Rimes, Martina McBride, Bryan White, Chely Wright, Rebecca St. James, Collin Raye, Trace Adkin, Julianne Hough, Steel Magnolia, Hunter Hayes, Brantley Gilbert, Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Swift, Sarah Darling, Mickey G, Johnny Gates and The Invite, Kenny Rogers, The Nashville TV Show, Reba's TV show, Big & Rich, Billy Currington, Maddie and Tae, Jennifer Nettles, Thompson Square, Seth Alley, Danielle Bradbery, and The Band Perry are only the beginning...and the artists just keep-on-comin'.\n\nSome of Huff's more recent clients include Steven Tyler, Thomas Rhett, in co-production with Jesse Frazier on Valory Music, Brett Young on Big Machine, Runaway June on Broken Bow, Kane Brown on Sony, Rachel Wamnack from Muscle Shoals, Tucker Befford and MIDLAND on Big Machine, in co-production with Shane MacAnally and Josh Osbourn.\n\nBut in a world where producers and engineers come & go quite frequently, one of the things that Dann cherishes the most is his 30 yr relationship with engineer Justin Niebank.\n\nA partial list of Dann's accolades includes...\n\nBillboard 'Producer of the Decade'\n\n2016 CMA 'Musician of the Year'\n\n2014 ACM Producer of the Year\n\n2010 ACM Producer of the Year\n\n2006 ACM Producer of the Year\n\n2006 MUSIC ROW AWARDS Producer of the Year\n\n2005 Grammy Recipient for Best Album\n\n2004 CMA Musician of the Year\n\n2001 CMA Musician of the Year\n\nAfter reluctantly reviewing some of his awards, I just about fell off my chair laughing when Dann asked, if he could expect a Rolex at some point? My guess would be yes...but it's far too early yet.\n\nOne thing is for sure...Dann Huff will always be the pride of his Father, his Family and Nashville...the place where he was born.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: Are songwriters and copyright owners doomed?\n\nDann Huff: No more than any of us. It's like anything in this country...take a number and stand in line. It depends on who you talk to...life ain't fair. Take a look at what happened in Charlottesville this week. That doesn't denigrate, all my friends who are songwriters and their need to be protected and compensated but, there's a lot of that stuff in different forms and some more dyer than others. Probably it's two-fold...this industry was able to support more than it probably should have been able to support so, it's done some culling of the herd. And I guess some of that is just evolution.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: Are they well-represented?\n\nDann Huff: There are a lot of smart songwriters that are involved in this. I know Shane MacAnally has been really active on that side and much more articulate than I would be. Everything they say, I back but, I also feel that way about musicians too. And here's where the discrepancy lies...This industry is so inner-dependent on itself. You hear statements like 'It's all about the song'...well...yes and no...chicken/egg...and that's really what it is. The song just sitting there doesn't do anything. I know how much everything that I do is related to that song, the songwriters, the vocal chords of an artist, the promotion staff of a label and everything else through management. There is just no way to extricate any one thing and say; this is why it happens.\n\nThe older I get the more I'm aware of what it takes to become successful. We're all just a part of that thing. But no-body can stand alone. Well...maybe someone like Ed Sheeran...he's an anomaly. But very seldom does that happen. We all need each other. I want them to get paid but I also want musicians to be paid.\n\nThere were so many times when we'd come in and we'd add stuff to a song that wasn't written in the song, like the hook/lick of a song. Back in other times, that song would sell millions upon millions of records and you were just paid, your small fee. In other countries, musicians who play on these hit songs are compensated. And they're starting to right that shift too. It's really nice to see there's a whole new 'special payments' for musicians. And I've noticed the way musicians come into sessions these days...they're totally invigorated to be present and create because the more hit songs they're on, the more money they make. It's a great incentive.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: Has the industry's search for new revenue streams, widened or narrowed the gap between the business and the creative?\n\nDann Huff: In my experience, I don't feel any change. I feel maybe there's, more of an awareness across the board that, this is not a gimmie. It has to be very intentional. When I was playing in Nashville, in the 90s, it would appear that, when the artist was relatively well-known and the project was moderately good, you could almost expect physical sales to be half-million on up and that added to almost a source of entitlement in the record industry, especially here in Nashville. Originally the record industry and the recording studios would be the gate-keepers but because of technology and the leveling of the playing field, anybody could make music on a laptop. I think that's what kind of changed the whole narrative. In the course of our lives watching this, the entitlement has been stripped away. The awareness of...you gotta be good is heightened.\n\nEverybody has made less and the pie shrunk drastically and I think it's made people more responsible. Overall, there seems to be more gratefulness when there's success. Personally, I feel more involved with the people who run these labels and their A&R staff. There seems to be more dialogue. I think overall, there's more awareness to the details and to the necessity of not missing, too many times.\n\nI feel badly for the artists, the young singers and entertainers. They're 'ready but 'ready-ish' and if they don't hit-it, the labels move on because there are so many in the on-deck circles. I think the industry is assimilating all of this now. It's just trying to figure out, how these corporations can make money.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: Has the redistribution of revenue streams been standardized to the point where, there's now a new model for how producers get paid?\n\nDann Huff: No...We make our deals with the artists and we take a % of the streaming royalties that they take and you get your up-front money. After that it's pretty much the 'Wild West'. If I was more into the artist development thing, I would participate 360 but, usually the artists who come to me have label deals. So usually what I'll do is, talk to management and work out some kind of incentive for chart success, which are bonuses for reaching peak levels on the charts.\n\nMost producers that I know and work with are writers. I write but it's not my pursuit. For them, their incentive is their songs and the production is a little extra change on the back-end, if you get a hit. If they want specifically what I do, I guess when they work with me they're buying into a track record of sorts. It's like picking a number that has a good chance of dingin' the bell.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: How involved are you in A&R and song-selection for your artists?\n\nDann Huff: The A&R avenues in these labels have really built up. Our A&R presence from the labels in this town is to me, at an all-time high now. Not that they weren't in the past but the producers of the generation before me were the power-brokers. They had the songs and most of them were publishers like James Stroud and Jimmy Bowen and that's how they ran their businesses. Nowadays it seems like there's less of that. These young A&R people are in the clubs, they're best friends with the writers and they're perfect in their jobs. To me it's now more like the west coast when I was playing. These people are empowered by their label-heads and they're doing the work. When I come into a situation, they always ask but I like making records. Their job is specifically...what vehicles can we get played on radio? I don't want to live in that reality because I want to be a musician. I'm living my dream job right now. They'll ask me what the single is but I don't have to meet with radio programmers.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: You won CMA '2016 Musician of the Year'. If that 'win' was based solely on session work that you've done, on records that you're producing...That's Incredible!\n\nDann Huff: I would think it would have to be. I have mixed emotions about it...of course you're always honored to win any kind of recognition so...I'm honored.\n\nMy wife Sherri always stands over my shoulder, when I get those ballots because she knows that, if it were up to me, I would vote for my friends. In the CMAs they don't give awards for producers like the ACMs. But I am a musician and I do play on almost everything. I just feel that the guys I hire that play for me, are more deserving.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: Has today's 'singles market' sealed the fate of the industry in some way or, is it simply another transitional stage, in the evolution of our industry?\n\nDann Huff: I think it's a transitional stage and part of the evolution. It's almost come full circle back to the way that pop music was being peddled in the 60s, as we all know...'singles'. I think it's led to us being much more intentional about what we put out. People are much pickier now. They don't have to buy anything...they can screen it. So we have to be more compelling, in our work.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: Are you producing anyone who is not country?\n\nDann Huff: Depending on whom you ask, all the critics say no-body I produce is country...hahahaha...except MIDLAND.\n\nThe Producer's Chair: What is the best advice you can give to great/new singers, hot/young musicians, gifted/fledgling songwriters and conscientious/potential executives?\n\nDann Huff: Best advice I can give...\n\nMake sure you can stay here for the long haul. You can never know when you're going to get that break-through moment.\n\nMake sure you have your business and personal finances in order.\n\nBe present...go to the clubs, meet people, network as much as possible. That moment will happen, when you least expect it.\n\nAnd above all...be prepared.\n\nRead other Producer's Chair interviews:\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Dann Huff\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Carl Jackson\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Dave Brainard\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Victoria Shaw\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Tom Hambridge\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Tony Brown\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Michael Knox\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Forest Glen Whitehead\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Mark Bright\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Scott Hendricks\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Trey Fanjoy\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Chad Carlson\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Jay DeMarcus\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Shane McAnally\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Doug Johnson\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Jeff and Jody Stevens\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Jamie O'Neal\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Fred Mollin\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Dann Huff\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Noah Gordon\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Carl Jackson\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Paul Worley\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Cactus Moser\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Dave Brainard\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Gretchen Peters\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Frank Liddell\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Victoria Shaw\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Jed Hilly\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Marshall Altman\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Julian King\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Brent Maher\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Tom Hambridge\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Jim Catano\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Michael Knox\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Keith Thomas\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Mark Bright\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Jimmie Lee Sloas\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Ron Haffkine\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Trey Bruce\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Doug Johnson\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Mickey Jack Cones\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Keith Stegall\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Ted Hewitt\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Carl Jackson\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Brett James\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Jeff Stevens\n\nThe Producer's Chair by James Rea - Dann Huff"
