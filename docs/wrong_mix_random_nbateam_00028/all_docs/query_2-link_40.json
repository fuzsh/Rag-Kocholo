        "text": "The Royal Examiner reported on recent charges brought against Ronald Llewellyn for alleged misappropriation of funds belonging to his mother-in-law. The article reported that a portion of the funds may have been transferred from the mother-in-law’s account to cover Mr. Llewellyn’s share of expenses for an investment company, Senary LLC.\n\nMr. Llewellyn is an individual investor in Senary, along with other individual investors. Each investor in Senary is and always has been required to pay such investor’s own personal pro-rata share of Senary’s ongoing expenses, which are mortgage payments and real estate taxes. No investor has knowledge of or access to any of the other investors’ personal finances. In 2019, as soon as Senary’s other investors learned of a civil suit in Frederick County concerning similar accusations against Mr. Llewellyn, in order to protect Senary’s and their own good names, and without knowing (and still not knowing) whether or not these accusations were true, these other investors from their own personal funds immediately reimbursed in full all of the funds alleged in the lawsuit as misused by Mr. Llewellyn to cover his share of Senary’s expenses. Senary was thereupon promptly released in 2019 from the lawsuit. The Senary’s other investors have no further knowledge of or involvement in any of these allegations.\n\nDouglas W.

Using genitals to assign human and civil rights is an unnatural use of genitals, but sexual activity is not.\n\nAs for gender identity, there are various biological explanations for gender incongruence, and given all of the chromosomal, biochemical, and neurological factors that need to align to even be a cis-gender person, therein lies the real miracle: the alignment of biological sex and gender identity. Calling something a “gender ideology” as though it was something that is taught and enforced is an admission that gender is a social construct, i.e., something we all accept as collective fiction, like corporations being people under the law. This irrationality is the rhetorical hill transphobes choose to die on.\n\nAs for drag shows, I’m less insulted by someone’s campy, burlesque portrayal of femininity than I am by people who use my choice of clothing to determine whether I was “asking” to be sexually harassed or assaulted. I choose to look at drag queens as imitation-being-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery, as I’ve never met a drag queen who didn’t like women as people. I can’t say the same for some chronically online straight men out there.\n\nAll homophobes and transphobes accomplish making the world less safe and accessible for vulnerable groups of people.\n\nLaura Standley\n\nFront Royal, VA\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in the letters published on this page are solely those of the respective authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Royal Examiner’s editorial team, its affiliates, or advertisers.

Thank you for being a part of our vibrant community of readers and contributors, and we look forward to receiving your diverse perspectives on matters of interest and importance.\n\nIn light of the upcoming Pride Front Royal event, we are writing to the Warren County community.\n\nA celebration based entirely on the unnatural use of one’s genitals is a bizarre affront to common decency and the natural law. The use of the term “pride” is telling since, as C.S. Lewis said, “Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.”\n\nDrag queen shows are denigrating and demeaning to real women. These events, in which males dress up as sexually exaggerated, stereotypical caricatures of females, are, in the words of West Texas A&M President Walter Wendler, “derisive, divisive and demoralizing misogyny, no matter the stated intent.”\n\nDrag queen shows are the moral equivalent of blackface. Attorney and journalist Kelly Kleiman states, “The same arguments that forged the cultural consensus against blackface should forge a consensus against drag.” In her essay Drag = Blackface, she further states, “The parallels between drag and blackface are so obvious that it seems bizarre that the intellectual consensus against blackface has not formed against drag.” And yet Pride Front Royal sees nothing wrong with the degrading drag queen show they are bringing to Front Royal.\n\nFurthermore, Pride Front Royal, in promoting the alphabet soup acronym, has aligned itself with the false ideology of the so-called “transgender” movement, the T in the acronym. This anti-science movement believes that males can become females and vice versa. This movement has captured the educational and medical establishments in this country and most major corporations. We see this in our local library being led by the nose by the American Library Association and buying with our tax dollars a plethora of books being pushed by the major publishers to indoctrinate our children.\n\nSupporters of this movement prey on impressionable children, grooming them into believing they are in the “wrong” body and encouraging them to “transition” to the other sex. They promote “gender-affirming care,” in which children are given powerful drugs and surgeries. Yet this “gender-affirming care” has a 100% failure rate. No male has been turned into a female, and vice versa. Instead, the boy remains a boy with male DNA but now with a mutilated body, and the girl remains a girl with female DNA, now with a mutilated body. This is child abuse. If you support Pride Front Royal, you are supporting child abuse. Likewise, if you support the ALA dictating our local library’s policies in purchasing books such as I Am Jazz, you are supporting child abuse.\n\nWe invite our fellow Christians in Warren County to pray for the conversion of these confused people as well as the children who have been abused and mutilated by these ideologues. Everyone is a child of God, but we are all sinners in need of the redemption of Jesus. “And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”\n\nLaura M.

In a recent email, John Massoud reminded us that, while many are trying to remove our freedoms, we remain the greatest nation ever born. We can still say our piece, and we can still (at least in Virginia) own guns and worship freely. Those of us in this neck of the woods can say we live in a place that could only have been created by the Living God (Shenandoah Valley, Virginia Highlands, Roanoke Valley).\n\nLooking at much of the culture surrounding us, the Founding Fathers would be amazed that we have not yet become a dictatorship. They would be horrified by what those who don’t respect our heritage are trying to do to this country. Yet, they would see in Donald Trump what they envisioned for this Republic – a citizen politician who gave up making money to save the Republic from those who would destroy it. All of our Founding Fathers distrusted the concept of a political hierarchy, and all of them supported the concept of the citizen politician or citizen legislator.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, under the pseudonym Silence Dogwood, wrote these words in the New England Courant on or about July 9, 1722:\n\n“Without Freedom of Thought, there can be no such Thing as Wisdom; and no such Thing as publick Liberty, without Freedom of Speech; which is the Right of every Man, as far as by it, he does not hurt or controul the Right of another: And this is the only Check it ought to suffer, and the only Bounds it ought to know.\n\nThis sacred Privilege is so essential to free Goverments, that the Security of Property, and the Freedom of Speech always go together; and in those wretched Countries where a Man cannot call his Tongue his own, he can scarce call any Thing else his own. Whoever would overthrow the Liberty of a Nation, must begin by subduing the Freeness of Speech; a Thing terrible to Publick Traytors”.\n\nWe often tend to think of our founders as ivory tower figures, but they were human beings just like we are. They worried about paying their bills, they had petty jealousies on the odd occasion. But when needed, they came together to lead this nation against the tyranny of King George III, and the tyranny of the Anglican Church, and the tyranny of big government… And did so at great cost to themselves. Most lost all that they owned. But they persevered, and they now belong to history and God.\n\nWhen we celebrate with fireworks this July 4, we are continuing a tradition brought over from Europe. John Adams – who always thought that the day we celebrated should be July 2 – wanted Independence Day to be celebrated “with pomp, parade…bonfires, and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other”.\n\nAs we celebrate this 4th, it would not be amiss if our celebration was accompanied with prayers for our nation’s safety and, most especially, a prayer that we can get this nation back to the Biblical values it was founded on, values that have been memorialized in our Declaration of Independence and US Constitution and the pursuit of which, has allowed God to bless this nation for over 400 years.\n\nAgain, a special thanks to John Massoud for his thoughts and observations… John is a true American patriot.\n\nDale Carpenter\n\nShenandoah Christian Alliance\n\nAn Open Letter to the WC School Board\n\nDear Warren County School Board Members,\n\nIt is my understanding that the Warren County School Board (WCSB), after dissolving its relationship with the Virginia School Board Association (VSBA), may contract with the School Board Member Association (SBMA), a recently created alliance whose stated mission is to support “traditional academics” and “educational freedom”. But as explored below, exactly what does that mean?\n\nThis letter has two asks: (1) that you reject SBMA and (2) that you rejoin VSBA.\n\nWhy rejoin VSBA?\n\nVSBA, in contrast to SBMA, has advocacy for pro-public schools as one of its main goals. As legislative chair for retired public teacher associations in nine counties, I closely follow education legislation enacted by the General Assembly and monitor groups that lobby for excellence in public schools.\n\nVSBA’s advocacy this year has resulted in $2.5 billion in new funding for K-12 education for FY-2024 through FY-2026. VSBA lobbied for the passage of 30 education bills that may directly and positively impact the lives of Warren County students. For example, beginning next school year, students in Grades 9-12 are to learn about the risks to health and safety posed by opioids. They will learn how to administer medication to reverse an overdose, and public school nurses must be trained in this procedure with the now-mandated school supply of naloxone.\n\nWhy reject SBMA?\n\nBy signing onto SBMA, WCSB members must pledge to align themselves with all aspects of SBMA’s mission statement. Here are two of them:\n\nSBMA wants “traditional academics” to be the primary focus in Virginia’s K-12 education system. That term may be misleading. It may be a cover-up for a pedagogy that was abandoned long ago: student rote learning versus the newer methodology of student/group hands-on activities; siloed subjects versus integrated, interdisciplinary subjects; a single unified curriculum for all students versus student choice of different kinds of classes. Moreover, traditional academics may offer no accommodations for special-needs students and no utilization of lesson plans based on student interests and learning styles.\n\nSBMA wants “educational freedom” for Virginia families. That term may be misleading. It may be a cover-up for promoting educational institutions other than those of public schools. I could not find “public school” in SBMA’s literature. However, VSBA, in contrast to SBMA, aims to advocate effectively for Virginia’s public schools and before all levels of government.\n\nIn light of the above, I urge Warren County School Board members to reject SBMA and rejoin VSBA.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJeanne Trabulsi\n\nFront Royal, VA\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in the letters published on this page are solely those of the respective authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Royal Examiner’s editorial team, its affiliates, or advertisers.

They intended to elect quality candidates that would focus on local issues and not party dogma (which includes our school boards) in building the quality of life in our individual communities. They felt that at this level, partisan politics would only repress the communities’ ability to make good community decisions.\n\nWith the increased activity and influence of party-endorsed candidates in our nonpartisan elections, are we better now in Front Royal than we were 2 years ago?\n\nOver the last several years, we have witnessed many decisions made by the Town Council that were made more for the self-interest of the Council than for our citizens. Most of the Town Council elected individuals were endorsed and financially supported by the local party in these nonpartisan elections. Every day, we become aware of more situations that confirm this type of activity, which shows the lack of action addressing many of the important issues facing our community of these candidates, past and present.\n\nI hope that the people in our community will choose the most qualified people to run for these nonpartisan positions. Again, some great non-endorsed individuals are running, like Tom Eshelman (Mayor), Glen Wood, and Walt Mabe (Council ), who will make the necessary changes moving forward.\n\nI have always been told I am a glass-half-full guy, but my expectations from our community change are very low.\n\nAgain, I hope I will be proved wrong.\n\nI want everybody to make a list and share with other citizens some of the questionable decisions made by this current Council over the last 2 years.\n\nIt’s quite enlightening but sad that we keep electing the same individuals and expect different outcomes.\n\nWe have so much potential in our community. Still, with the current group of elected officials having a very limited vision of what we could become, it will continue to be difficult.\n\nMichael Graham\n\nFront Royal, VA\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in the letters published on this page are solely those of the respective authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Royal Examiner’s editorial team, its affiliates, or advertisers.
