        "text": "Harold Deane Jr. peers through the glass moon roof of his\n\n'92 Acura Legend and appraises the thick clouds hovering\n\nabove Charlottesville, Va. \"I hope it rains,\" he says. \"My car\n\ncould use a wash.\"\n\nIn the 2 1/2 days since Deane bought the car with his summer\n\nearnings, his gleaming black ride has apparently acquired a\n\npatina of unbecoming grit, invisible to all but the most\n\ncritical eye. On another day this might call for a pit stop at a\n\nnearby car wash, but today Virginia's junior point guard will\n\nhave to depend on nature to keep his car looking sharp. He's\n\nalready late for a scrimmage at the gym, and the traffic around\n\ncampus is as dense as the clouds. Still, it's a good opportunity\n\nto test some of the car's hardware. The stereo bass, currently\n\nfeaturing the rap group Grand Puba, works well. Deane sees a\n\nfriend's car approach from the other direction. Beep-beep. The\n\nhorn works fine too. He sees another friend on the sidewalk.\n\nBeep-beep. Deane brakes, presses a button, and the window slides\n\ndown quietly. \"Hey!\" Deane calls out, his cheeks dimpling. \"Good\n\nto see you!\" He presses the button again and the window squeezes\n\nshut. The windows work flawlessly. He drives on.\n\nUp ahead, another friend. Beep-beep. In the last 10 minutes of\n\npatrolling the campus, Deane has failed to acknowledge only\n\nabout one out of every four people, which is perfectly logical\n\nwhen you consider that approximately 25% of the undergraduates\n\non campus are freshmen who haven't yet had the chance to get to\n\nknow him. Soon enough, they'll learn what every upperclassman\n\nalready has: One of the nation's toughest players on the\n\nbasketball court is one of its friendliest off it. Not to\n\nmention one of its most fastidious. You think Deane likes his\n\ncar looking showroom perfect? You should see the house he shares\n\nwith two roommates. Martha Stewart would weep. \"Everything is\n\nlined up perfectly in his closet,\" says sophomore Curtis\n\nStaples, Deane's backcourt mate. \"Harold is the most clean-cut,\n\nparticular, perfectionistic person I've ever met. But you need\n\npicky people on your team.\"\n\nEspecially if that perfectionism produces a player who can\n\nshoot, pass and penetrate on one end of the court and nag an\n\nopponent to distraction on the other. Playing both point and\n\nshooting guard as a sophomore last season, Deane averaged 16\n\npoints and 4.3 assists per game and shot 79.5% from the free\n\nthrow line. He was probably even more valuable to the Cavaliers\n\non the defensive end, though his stats don't reveal much. His 46\n\nsteals and 83 defensive rebounds don't give the slightest hint\n\nof his pestiferous presence in the Cavs' pressure defense. \"What\n\nHarold does is make people uncomfortable,\" says Staples. \"You\n\ncan throw at him your best combination of moves, and he'll still\n\nbe in your face. It's very frustrating.\"\n\n\"He is physically intimidating,\" says Pittsburgh coach Ralph\n\nWillard. \"He directs you and pushes you where he wants you to\n\ngo. You don't get by him. He moves you and gets away with it\n\nbecause of his strength.\"\n\nA chiseled 6'1\", 180 pounds, Deane is, pound for pound, the\n\nstrongest player on Virginia's team. Add to that a 39-inch\n\nvertical leap, lightning-quick hands and feet and an on-court\n\nattitude of menace, and you have a regular Cerberus at the\n\ngate. Oh, and one more thing. \"Guys don't realize how long my\n\narms are,\" says Deane. \"I'll keep them down when I'm in a\n\ncrouch, then I reach up and grab a pass out of the air.\"\n\n\"Harold is the best defensive player I've seen on any level,\"\n\nsays Virginia senior Jenny Boucek, the shooting guard and\n\ndefensive workhorse on the women's team, a perennial NCAA title\n\ncontender. \"I don't even watch the ball when Harold is playing,\n\nI watch him. Off the court he is laid-back and secure, but on\n\nthe court he always plays like he has something to prove.\"\n\nDeane will tell you he has a lot to prove. After all, nobody\n\nmade much of a fuss over him when he came out of Matoaca High in\n\nEttrick, Va., in 1992. His only scholarship offers his senior\n\nyear were from Virginia Military Institute, Boston University,\n\nRadford and Virginia State, where his father, Harold Sr., was\n\nhead coach. Virginia, the school he had long dreamed of\n\nattending, passed on him after Cav coach Jeff Jones saw him play\n\nas a sophomore. \"To be honest, I didn't like his game,\" says\n\nJones now. \"The thing that bothered me most was the way he was\n\nalways fooling with his uniform, making sure his shorts were\n\njust so and his wristbands were in the right place and all that.\n\nHe was more worried about how he looked than how he played. He\n\njust didn't seem all that tough.\"\n\nNot happy with his options after high school, Deane took a prep\n\nyear at Fork Union (Va.) Military Academy to improve his\n\nprospects. Before Deane even got there, though, Jones saw him\n\nplay in a summer AAU game and reconsidered his position. \"In\n\njust a matter of months, Harold had become a different player,\"\n\nsays Jones. \"The style stuff was gone. He was more athletic,\n\nmore reckless and more hard-nosed.\"\n\nAt Fork Union, Deane suffered dawn inspections, parade marches\n\nand starched uniforms while doing 200 push-ups a night and\n\nworking out in the weight room every day. \"From the first day to\n\nthe last, I thought about getting my body in shape for the next\n\nlevel,\" he says. Deane also thought a lot about his best friend,\n\nChris White, who had died of heart disease the year before at\n\nthe age of 17. \"I still think about him all the time,\" says\n\nDeane. \"Before every game I say a prayer for Chris, who was a\n\ngreat basketball player. When he first came to Matoaca, he\n\npushed me and gave me the aspiration to play in the NBA. All the\n\ndreams he had, I try to carry on for him.\"\n\nWhen he finally arrived in Charlottesville as a freshman in '93,\n\nDeane came to practice and made himself right at home--in junior\n\npoint guard Cory Alexander's face. \"Harold was a challenge for\n\nme,\" says Alexander, who was drafted by the San Antonio Spurs\n\nlast June. \"I had never had someone who could really guard me in\n\npractice. But I'll tell you, I got a lot better because of him.\"\n\nWhen Alexander broke his ankle 12 minutes into the first game of\n\nthe season, Jones turned to Deane, his only other point guard.\n\nAfter a rocky start Deane directed the Cavaliers to 18 wins and\n\na second-round appearance in the NCAAs, averaging 33.7 minutes\n\nand 12.3 points per game. He started at shooting guard last\n\nseason until taking over the point again when Alexander broke\n\nhis ankle for the second time, on Feb. 8 against N.C. State.\n\nDeane then led the Cavs to a berth in the Elite Eight after\n\nupsetting Kansas, the top seed in the Midwest Region.\n\n\"After his freshman year there were guys taken in the first\n\nround of the draft who weren't as good as Harold,\" says Jones.\n\n\"His future in the NBA will depend on his head.\"\n\nIf his NBA prospects ride on his work ethic, his future is\n\nassured. \"A big part of Harold's game is his determination--or\n\nstubbornness, if you want to call it that,\" says Jones. \"He\n\nremembers where he came from, that he wasn't highly recruited.\n\nIt keeps him hungry, but it can be his enemy. He's a coach's\n\nson, so he knows that what the coach says, goes. But he also has\n\na mind of his own.\"\n\nThat may be because Deane is also a referee's son. In addition\n\nto coaching Virginia State from 1969 to 1979 and again from 1987\n\nto '93, Harold Sr. spent several years officiating high\n\nschool games. Little Harold would often tag along and wait\n\npatiently, ball in hand, for timeouts, when he would run out\n\nonto the floor to shoot baskets. \"He would look forward to that\n\nso much,\" says Harold Sr. \"I'd always give him a goal, like, see\n\nif you can make 10 in a row.\"\n\n\"My dad taught me a lot of things,\" says Harold Jr. \"But\n\nprobably the most important thing was hustle. If you have a bad\n\nshooting night, hustling will always pull you through.\"\n\nAnother thing his dad might have taught him: If you're named\n\nHarold, you're sure to pick up a nickname or two. Deane's father\n\ncalls him Duke, after a childhood friend, and his teammates call\n\nhim Dean-o. Though Duke and Dean-o can be hard on the ears\n\nduring certain weeks of the ACC schedule, Deane prefers both to\n\na third he acquired for his relentless defense. \"Some of my\n\ncoaches call me Badger,\" he says, grimacing. \"But that's not me.\n\nIt's just not smooth.\"\n\nClearly, Deane's \"style stuff,\" as Jones calls it, has not\n\ncompletely disappeared. His preferred outfitters are Donna Karan\n\nand Tommy Hilfiger. When he takes off his shirt to play in a\n\npickup game, his baggy shorts--\"everything has to be baggy:\n\nshorts, shirts and jeans,\" he says--droop enough to reveal his\n\nunderwear brand of choice: RALPH LAUREN.\n\n\"I just know what looks good,\" says Deane, his voice as soft as\n\nSea Island cotton. \"Curtis and [junior swingman] Jamal Robinson\n\nhave similar taste, but then again, I could pick up an ugly\n\nshirt and they might consider actually buying it.\" Not Deane, of\n\ncourse, who, walking past an action photo of himself, sighs, \"I\n\ndon't particularly like that photo. I'm not wearing a tight\n\nhaircut. Look--my hair's all messed up.\"\n\nAs particular as his tastes are, Deane is, at heart, a\n\nblue-collar worker. This summer he arose at 5:30 every morning\n\nto get to his job as a beer distributor's assistant. Eight hours\n\na day, he loaded and unloaded cases of beer around Lynchburg.\n\n\"Man, that was hard work,\" says Deane as he fusses over the\n\nreward for his labor--this car. Laying a towel down on the\n\ndriver's seat in an attempt to protect the ocher leather\n\ninterior from his workout sweat, he adds, \"But working hard is\n\nsomething I have to do. There will always be doubters. And you\n\nnever know when you're going to run into that guy who has been\n\nworking just as hard as you.\"\n\nBut if you're Harold Deane, you do know when you're going to run\n\ninto another friend. Any minute now. Beep-beep.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: KATHERINE LAMBERT Deane, fierce on the court but finicky off it, makes sure that his car is as polished as his game.

KLUTHO Deane is a model of the ferocious player who makes pressure defense work. [Harold Deane Jr.]\n\nTENACIOUS TEN\n\nThe pressure defenses that dominate today's game have put a\n\npremium on particularly disruptive defenders like Harold Deane.\n\nHe isn't alone in throwing offenses into a tizzy. Here, listed\n\nalphabetically, are 10 more of the country's top defenders, with\n\ncomments from those they disturb most--opposing coaches and\n\nplayers.\n\nRay Allen, SG, UConn: Says Pitt coach Ralph Willard, \"He plays\n\ngreat in the lanes. He denies you. He controls you. He does\n\neverything.\"\n\nErick Dampier, C, Miss. State: Says Utah coach Rick Majerus,\n\n\"Playing him is like going against a Star Wars defense system.\"\n\nTim Duncan, C, Wake Forest: Says Davidson coach Bob McKillop,\n\n\"His timing and extension make anything inside very difficult.\"\n\nReggie Geary, SG, Arizona: Says Cal guard Anwar McQueen, \"He\n\nis really disruptive. He has good size, he's strong and he talks\n\nto you.\"\n\nAllen Iverson, PG, Georgetown: Says Syracuse coach Jim\n\nBoeheim, \"He's a Deion Sanders type--he takes the ball away from\n\npeople.\"\n\nKenyon Murray, SF, Iowa: Says Ohio State coach Randy Ayers,\n\n\"He picks his spots and does a good job anticipating the next\n\npass.\"\n\nJohnny Rhodes, SG, Maryland: Says Virginia coach Jeff Jones,\n\n\"His style fits with the Terps' aggressive, pressing style.\"\n\nFrank Seckar, PG, Vanderbilt: Says South Carolina coach Eddie\n\nFogler, \"He pressures the ball and takes the charge.\"\n\nErick Strickland, SG, Nebraska: Says Oklahoma coach Kelvin\n\nSampson, \"He dominates others with strength and quickness.\""
