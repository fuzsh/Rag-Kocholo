        "text": "Kanye West and Donna Summer's estate have agreed a settlement over his alleged copyright infringement.\n\nKanye, Ty Dolla $ign, Ye's record label, and more were being sued by the estate for using Donna's 1977 song I Feel Love, according to legal documents. The Gold Digger rapper released his first album in his Vultures 1 trio compilation earlier this year.\n\nDonna's estate claimed that the album's song Good (Don't Die) included vocals of the late disco diva after the estate \"explicitly denied\" them permission, according to the suit. Bruce Sudano is listed in the court documents the Executor of the Estate of Donna Summer. The document - filed in February 2024 - said he \"seeks to protect Summer's musical legacy that made her the undisputed 'Queen of Disco.'\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: All the stars who have called out Kanye West for copyright infringement\n\n\"Summer's estate, however, wanted no association with West's controversial history and specifically rejected West's proposed use of Summer's 'I Feel Love,'\" the suit read. The lawsuit also stated that Ye and Ty Dolla $ign, legal name Tyrone William Griffin Jr., \"arrogantly and unilaterally decided they would simply steal I Feel Love and use it without permission.”\n\nThe track was subsequently pulled from all streaming platforms. On June 20, lawyers on both sides announced that they have “entered into a settlement agreement that is a full and final settlement of all of the claims in the action” and that each side would be paying their own legal bills. Larry Stein, the lead legal counsel for Summer's estate told Billboard Kanye has not been given permission to use her music in the future.\n\nHe said: “We did not license the song. As part of the settlement, they have agreed not to distribute or otherwise use the song. So we got what we wanted.” The track will remain withdrawn from all official streaming platforms.\n\nThe original lawsuit from Summer's estate also stated: “This lawsuit is about more than defendants’ mere failure to pay the appropriate licensing fee for using another’s musical property. It is also about the rights of artists to decide how their works are used and presented to the public, and the need to prevent anyone from simply stealing creative works when they cannot secure the right to use them legally.”"
