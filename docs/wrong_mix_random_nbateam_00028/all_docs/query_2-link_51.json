        "text": "Charleston Business Magazine celebrates another year of honoring the region's most influential people. The selection of our 50 men and women is a result of staff research and community nominations.\n\nWe also are celebrating our third year of selecting entrants to our Hall of Fame. This year, we're adding eight new members who have continued to make a lasting difference in the Lowcountry.\n\nHALL OF FAME\n\nTommy Baker\n\nFounder\n\nBaker Motor Company\n\nTommy Baker was born in Charleston, South Carolina, close to the banks of the Wando and Cooper rivers and the historic Charleston peninsula. He attended Moultrie High School, and after distinguishing himself on the baseball fields and the dance floors of the Lowcountry, graduated in 1964.\n\nMotivated by a desire to serve his country and by the patriotism of many past generations of Charlestonians, Baker enlisted in the Marine Corps shortly after graduation. His service took him far from Charleston, to Okinawa in Japan and finally back home in 1968 where he enrolled at The Citadel, South Carolina’s preeminent military college.\n\nAfter spending 25 years as an automobile dealer across the South, Baker felt it was time to return to his first love, Charleston. Combining his extensive experience with acute business savvy and his one-of-a-kind amicable personality, he founded Baker Motor Company in 1988. After starting out on Morrison Drive in Downtown Charleston with a single dealership, he has since expanded Baker Motor Company to include various luxury brands, and a luxury Pre-Owned Center on its main campus on Savannah Highway.\n\nBaker has always prioritized giving back to the Charleston community. He has served as past chair of the MUSC Children’s Hospital, the College of Charleston School of Business, YEScarolina and the Free Enterprise Foundation, a research institution that works in harmony with The Citadel, The College of Charleston and the Medical University.\n\nBaker Motor Company received the Award for Outstanding Corporation from the Association of Fundraising Professionals South Carolina Lowcountry Chapter in honor of its community involvement, philanthropy, and financial support of charitable organizations.\n\nLaVanda Brown\n\nExecutive Director\n\nYWCA Greater Charleston\n\nLaVanda Brown joined YWCA Greater Charleston as executive director in February 2016. Her experience, leadership, and passion for serving others spans 30 years.\n\nDuring her decades of on-the-ground experience in social services focused on underserved populations, she has led and advised multiple nonprofit and for-profit organizations, including Family Promise of Greater Savannah, Union Mission, Greenbriar Children’s Center, Gang Alternatives of Miami, Clarke Community Services in New Orleans, and others in the behavioral health, employment, and community services arenas.\n\nA passionate advocate for causes including gender equality, diversity, and racial equity, and a strong ally of under-resourced teens and homeless populations, she envisions a world where differences are not just tolerated but celebrated. “The mission of YWCA is one that is very much in line with my personal mission of empowering women and celebrating differences,” she says.\n\nHer work has garnered awards including the 2021 Trident Literacy Founder’s Award, the 2018 recipient of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Picture Award for outstanding community service, presented by Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg and South Carolina Rep. Wendell Gilliard, and being named to Charleston Business magazine’s 2020 and 2021 Top 50 most Influential list.\n\nBrown serves on the board of Enough Pie, an organization dedicated to improving Charleston’s upper peninsula; as a founding board member of Family Promise Greater Charleston, which provided supportive services to end and prevent family homelessness; and she serves on the leadership council of the Social Justice Racial Equity Collaborative in Charleston.\n\nBrown holds a dual bachelor’s degree in psychology and sociology from Wesleyan College and a master’s degree in counseling from Georgia Southern University.\n\nDr. David Cole\n\nPresident\n\nMedical University of South Carolina\n\nMUSC President and surgeon Dr. David Cole brings integrity, intelligence, optimism, and humor to both roles, and strives to be a role model who elevates others and builds effective teams. He seeks to build on the solid foundation laid by his predecessors to enable MUSC to excel in one of the most transformative times in health care history.\n\nCole maintains connectivity with MUSC’s many academic, clinical and leadership teams as a physician-scientist and active surgical oncologist providing day-to-day patient care in addition to his administrative duties. He is known for encouraging and enabling MUSC team members to innovate and lead from where they are, and champions the successes and lessons learned from all corners of the institution.\n\nSince he began as president in 2014, he has led MUSC through a period of unprecedented transformation, both in scope and scale, positioning MUSC as the academic health care leader in South Carolina. This includes being ranked Best Hospital in South Carolina by U.S. News & World Report six years running as well as achieving national recognition by Forbes Magazine as a top employer and best employer for diversity.\n\nOther transformational highlights under his leadership include developing MUSC into a statewide health system through strategic partnerships, acquisition of regional hospitals and other ancillary facilities, and achieving national leadership in telehealth services and programs as recognized by MUSC’s designation as one of only two centers of excellence in the United States; obtaining record research funding that positions MUSC as the leading research university in South Carolina and among the top 20 percent in the country for National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding; and opening state-of-the-art MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children’s Hospital and Pearl Tourville Women’s Pavilion supported by a record-breaking $150 million-dollar fundraising effort.\n\nA native of New Mexico, Cole attended New Mexico State University, was a Rhodes scholarship finalist, and earned his medical degree from Cornell University in New York. He completed his surgical residency at Emory University affiliated hospitals in Atlanta, Ga., and his fellowship in the surgical oncology branch at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nJohn Darby\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nThe Beach Company\n\nJohn Darby is president and CEO of The Beach Company, a privately owned company founded in 1945 headquartered in Charleston, S.C.

Through the Meeting Street Scholarship Fund, the philanthropic commitment supports thousands of Charleston County students on their path to college.\n\nIn November, the Meeting Street Scholarship Fund, a nonprofit helping high-achieving students with financial need pay for college, announced expansion of the scholarship to Barnwell County thanks to the generosity of a group of anonymous donors. The expansion to Barnwell County was projected to impact more than 60 high school seniors in the next five years, awarding each recipient up to $40,000 in total college scholarships. The estimated scholarship awards will exceed $2.4 million, and there is no limit to the number of recipients who can earn the Meeting Street Scholarship.\n\nThe scholarship is available in 10 counties, including six with the highest poverty rates in South Carolina: Barnwell, Charleston, Clarendon, Darlington, Dillon, Florence, Lee, Marion, Marlboro, and Williamsburg. The fund provided over $3 million to 276 students in its first two years. With the addition of Barnwell County, the Meeting Street Scholarship Fund projects it will award more than 200 scholarships annually.\n\n“Students who have worked hard to earn acceptance to our state’s best colleges should not be held back by daunting college costs,” Navarro says. “Expanding opportunity is our mission, and we are excited to follow these incredible students as they achieve their dreams.”\n\nNow here are Charleston's 50 Most Influential:\n\nGrier Allen\n\nCEO and Co-founder\n\nBoomTown\n\nGrier Allen is the CEO and co-founder of BoomTown, a real estate software company designed to empower agents, teams, and brokers with the tools they need to succeed.\n\nAfter receiving a degree in computer science, Allen partnered with Copper Bane to start BoomTown in 2006.\n\nAfter 20 years of experience, he was named on the Swanepoel Power 200 List for eight consecutive years.
