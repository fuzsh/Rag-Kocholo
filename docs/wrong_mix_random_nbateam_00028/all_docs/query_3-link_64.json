        "text": "The six-member Board of Supervisors (\"the Supervisors\", \"the Board\", or the \"BoS\") is the highest decision-making body in Albemarle County.\n\nEach board member is elected from one of the county's six magisterial districts. Supervisors are elected for four-year terms, staggered at two-year intervals, so that only three Supervisors are up for re-election at any given time.\n\nThe next election is in November 2023.\n\nMembership\n\nCurrent membership\n\nThe current members of the Board of Supervisors, serving terms ending in 2025 or 2027 are:\n\nJim Andrews (Samuel Miller)\n\nBea LaPisto Kirtley (Rivanna)\n\nAnn Mallek (White Hall)\n\nDiantha McKeel (Jack Jouett)\n\nMike Pruitt (Scottsville)\n\nNed Gallaway (Rio)\n\nPrice became chair on January 5, 2022. [1] Ned Gallaway served as chair 2019 through 2021. [2] [3]\n\nThis comprises six Democrats on the Board of Supervisors.\n\nFormer Members\n\nMain article: List of Albemarle Supervisors\n\nAlso See articles related to former members of the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors\n\nCompensation\n\nThe current Board of Supervisors annual salary is $16,972. The chair receives a yearly stipend of $1,800. The vice chair receives $35 for every meeting he or she chairs. [4]\n\nThe practice of Supervisors receiving compensation dates back to August 19, 1936 when the Board passed a resolution allowing themselves to be paid for their service on the Board. Everyone except the Chair would receive $300 a year while the Chair would receive $500 a year. Earlier that summer, Supervisors had asked Judge Lemuel F. Smith for an opinion on whether they could vote to pay themselves. They had also asked Smith to set their salary, but he explained he had no authority under state law to do so. [5]\n\nChair\n\nThe Chair presides over meetings, calls special meetings, and serves as the ceremonial head of government. The Vice Chair substitutes whenever the Chair is unavailable. While the Chair has no more power than any other Supervisor, the position carries with it the ability to set the agenda and conduct the public meetings.\n\nSee also: List of former chairs of the Board of Supervisors.\n\nDuties\n\nDuties of the Board include:\n\nApproving the budget as prepared by staff.\n\nThis list of duties is a stub. You can help cvillepedia by expanding it.\n\nThe Board meets on the first and third Wednesdays of each month, with each regular meeting beginning at 1:00 p.m. with public hearings held at 6:00 p.m. The Board generally meets in Lane Auditorium but occasionally holds work sessions in Room 241. The beginning of regular meetings features a time when member of the public can make a comment to the supervisors. The board allows people to sign up for speaking slots online as well.\n\nAll meetings are virtual during the COVID-19 Emergency. Video-streams of meetings have been available since November 2015.\n\nTie breaker\n\nWith six members, there is frequently the possibility of a 3-3 stalemate. These have been dealt with in many ways.\n\nIn May 1921, the board was temporarily down to 6 members following the death of James W. Early. A vote over a $500 appropriation resulted in a 3-3 tie which was resolved a month later by a court-appointed temporary replacement.[6]\n\nIn January 2013, the board opted not to pursue adding a seventh member.[7]\n\nBoard of Supervisors official site\n\nAlbemarle County Board of Supervisors Minutes from 1921 to 2015\n\nAlbemarle Board of Supervisors Agendas and Minutes from 2015 to 2021"
