        "text": "Col. Robert Moreschi, chair of the economics and business department since 2013, has been chosen as deputy superintendent for academics and dean of the faculty.\n\nMany Lexington residents may pay their city taxes but not know exactly where that money is going. Two VMI cadets have taken on the challenge of translating the city’s ﬁnances into an easy-to-read format for residents.\n\nDr. Dekuwmini \"Dee\" Mornah is planning to lead a group of cadets in Ghana next summer—and he's passionate about teaching entrepreneurship on post.\n\nThomas Watjen, VMI Class of 1976, will present a lecture, “Leadership in a Dynamic and Changing World,” in Virginia Military Institute’s Gillis Theater at 11:15 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 20.\n\nCadets in Maj. Dekuwmini Mornah's entrepreneurship class found themselves having to think creatively after being asked to start and run a business for two hours on only $5."
