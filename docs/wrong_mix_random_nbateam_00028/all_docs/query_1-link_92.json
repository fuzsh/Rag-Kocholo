        "text": "Thank you for your substantial contribution to this thread. I've learned a lot.\n\nI dunno, there was a real downtown-uptown connection in NYC in those days between the Manhattan punk scene which was one exciting new music emerging there in the middle and late '70s and the hip hop scene in the Bronx but also Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens, and it also tied into the downtown high art scene and crossed over with graffiti writers (and in those years, it also wasn't unusual for people of all classes and races to wind up at some disco). Certainly the foundations of hip hop long predate \"Rapture,\" but the continuum between hip hop and punk and new wave and disco and R&B in NYC at the turn of the 1980s was organic, it wasn't just cultural appropriation and co-opting going on, there was a real cross fertilization taking place.\n\nAt the time I always assumed this was done to avoid the inevitable lawsuits. Instead of having a DJ beat juggle a break they had a band play it.\n\nIt's yours was released on Party Time, the hip-hop subsidiary of Streetwise. It did have the Def Jam Productions logo on it but it predates the label. My freshmen year of college was 1984 and as I recall I had a promo copy of It's Yours before I started school so some time in August. I don't recall seeing I Need a Beat (DJ0001) until January 85. But to me this still isn't late 70's/early 80's hip hop because its using a drum machine. If you're just looking for hip hop with scratching there are plenty of earlier releases, the Grand Mixer D ST 12\" singles on Celluloid which are even earlier, first one was 1982. Play that Beat also comes to mind which is summer 83 I think. Run DMC's Jam Master Jay was also 83. And I'm sure there are more I'm not remembering. But to me all of these records are early releases in the second wave of hip-hop where drum machines replaced DJ beat juggling (but not scratching). The third wave comes in late 86/early 87 when samples start replacing the drum machine (and that's where I largely abandoned hip-hop for other styles of electronic music).\n\nFor authentic hip-hop on vinyl the earliest (and really only) I can remember is the Wild Style soundtrack which was a full year earlier. A good chunk of the record is recorded in a club with various MC's rapping over the same beat juggle."
