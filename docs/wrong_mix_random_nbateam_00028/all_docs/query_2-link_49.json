        "text": "Posted by : Moneek\n\nSummer’s here! You may be dreaming of warm, sunny days, delicious barbecue get-togethers, beautiful green lawns and cloudless blue skies. Then you walk out your back door and see…a boring, lack-luster and maybe even junky backyard.\n\nDon’t fret about what needs to be done to your home’s outdoor area. Here are 10 awesome ways to transform your backyard this summer. One or more of them are sure to fit your lifestyle and budget.\n\nClear the Clutter\n\nShow your backyard some love by cleaning it up. Ditch everything that’s faded, broken, or beyond repair. Haul away trash, leaves, and old toys and games. Add some storage on your deck or patio to keep your garden tools, grilling accessories, and outdoor games.\n\nRelated Read: Clever Hacks that Give New Life to Household Junk\n\nPut in Comfortable Seating\n\nSummer’s all about relaxing and enjoying the sun. Either put a fresh coat of paint on current furniture or splurge and buy new stuff. Purchase some bright-colored pillows to make every chair a bit softer. Add some folding chairs that you can break out if you have more than a few people. A nice bench is also a great addition to outdoor seating.\n\nInstall A Water Feature\n\nWater is refreshing and relaxing, so why not add a water feature to your backyard? There are many types of fountains that you can purchase, or design one of your own as a DIY project. Another option is to add a bird bath and watch your feathered friends cool off. You could create a small pond or, if you have enough room, a small waterfall. A unique water feature will be a backyard addition you’ll enjoy all summer.\n\nProvide Shade\n\nIf you and family or friends are going to spend time outside, you’ll need to have some respite from the bright sun. Build a pergola and hang brightly colored fabric from it or hang a sail and trim it with lights to create a festive mood. Go an easier route and purchase some umbrellas. Plant a few trees and place some chairs under them for a nice conversation area. Everyone will thank you when the temperature climbs during the hot, summer months.\n\nGreen It Up!\n\nGrass alone can end up looking bland and boring. Visit your neighborhood nursery and choose some plants to place around your backyard. Go for a mix of green, leafy shrubs and flowering plants. Buy some colorful pots and add flowers on the edges of your patio and deck or create a vertical herb garden that will be handy to use in your summer recipes. Don’t forget a good quality water hose and a watering can to keep your new investments fed and moist through those sweltering summer temperatures.\n\nConsider Your Privacy\n\nIf you live close to other people, you may frown at the thought of prying eyes watching your every move. You can add privacy to your backyard in several ways. If your budget allows, invest in a privacy fence so you can go about your business in peace. Plant some ever-green, fast-growing trees for a more natural looking wall that separates you from your neighbors. Large pots of fast-growing bamboo can also create a feeling of intimacy and privacy, as can a lattice wall. If you have a covered porch, buy some colorful curtains and tie-backs so you can close them when you want extra privacy.\n\nAdd An Element of Fire\n\nEven during the summer, the nights can have a chill. Find a level spot in your yard for a fire pit. Your family and friends can spend many hours around it talking and laughing. To increase the drama in your backyard, add a fountain with a fire element. Or, for more year-round living, have a fireplace installed in your covered porch to create a cozy area to snuggle.\n\nInvest in Outdoor Lighting\n\nThe sun lasts longer during the summer, but night falls eventually. Keep the fun going and create a festive environment by hanging lights around your trees, porches, and fences. Simple LED outdoor lights are fun and don’t increase your electric bill by too much. You can also set lanterns around to add to your cozy atmosphere. For a green approach, add solar lights around your walkways and steps to light the path. If bugs are an issue, buy some tiki torches and use citronella oil so you get bug repellent and attractive lighting with one purchase.\n\nSet Up Some Lawn Games\n\nIt’s time to get competitive! Set up cornhole boards or horseshoes in a corner of your yard and start some friendly wagering. There are also life-size Jenga and ConnectFour games available that add fun to any gathering. If your yard is level, put out a croquet course or a mini putt-putt course. These games offer many hours of enjoyment for your friends and family this summer.\n\nRelated Read: Fun Summer Crafts to Keep Your Kids Engaged\n\nPlan for Outdoor Cooking\n\nDon’t overlook the fact that you’ll need to feed your crowd this summer. Avoid getting stuck in the kitchen by investing in a grill. Make sure you buy one that is big enough to cook for the size crowd that’s usually at your house. Buy some burgers, hotdogs, and chicken breasts in bulk to freeze so you’ll have them available if an impromptu party happens. Add to the summer atmosphere by buying tropical-themed plates and bowls to use when you grill out. Whip up some margaritas or a big pitcher of sangria and serve in boldly-colored glasses with fun straws.\n\nCreating an awesome backyard for summer fun is within your reach, no matter what your style and budget. Invest some time and money into transforming it into a space that’s comfortable and entertaining so you and your family can spend the summer having fun and making memories without even leaving your house."
