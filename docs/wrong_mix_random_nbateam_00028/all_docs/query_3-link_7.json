        "text": "This show is canceled. We apologize for the disappointment and inconvenience, and thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nJoin us as we celebrate Pride Month with a journey through the past 50 years of Pride Anthems. From Donna Summer and Queen to George Michael, Erasure, Madonna, Lady Gaga, and much more, these essential songs take us from disco to the present day. The story of the fight for LGBTQ+ equality is linked to this music, which evokes the struggles, heartache, and liberation of queer lives then and now.\n\nPride Anthems creates a vibrant musical experience that celebrates, inspires and commemorates the legacy and power of the Stonewall Riots, and takes you on a musical and cultural journey through the past 50 years to today. Featuring Kevin Smith Kirkwood (Kinky Boots) and NYC cabaret-artist Amy Jo Jackson with musical direction by Brian J. Nash, Pride Anthems is a show for all ages to come together in song and celebration of where the LGBTQ+ community has come from and how far it has come since Stonewall!\n\nPride Anthems is produced in partnership with Pride Live. A portion of the proceeds benefit Pride Live and the Stonewall National Monument Visitors Center (SNMVC), which will open in June 2024.
