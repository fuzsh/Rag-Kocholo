She provides individualized support to students as they navigate academic challenges commonly found in the gap between secondary education and collegiate learning. Donna delivers personalized improvement plans and content strategies that lead to increased learner autonomy and student engagement. On a case-by-case basis, she serves as a liaison between students and additional campus resources, both within the ARC (learning strategy workshops, content and writing tutors, quiet study spaces, and special learning accommodations) and across campus (Health & Wellness, Communication Resource Center, and faculty office hours).\n\nCommitted to lifelong learning, Donna has completed all required coursework toward a Ph.D. in education from Old Dominion University, focused on post-secondary learning and STEM education. Her research interests include person-centered communication practices and educational activities contributing to student motivation, empowerment, persistence, and retention.\n\nDonna and her husband, Glen Goertler, live in Williamstown, West Virginia. They enjoy traveling, gardening, cooking, and spending time with family and friends. They have raised five adult children and are proud grandparents to a growing brood of little ones."
