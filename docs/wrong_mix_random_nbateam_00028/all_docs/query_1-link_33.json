        "text": "The jukebox musical \"Summer: The Donna Summer Musical\" is a fun evening of hit songs, slick dancing and hot costumes in the tour's national press opening at Playhouse Square's Connor Palace. But this show's actual story about the Queen of Disco's rise to fame isn't nearly as strong as its other performance elements.\n\nThis bio-musical tries to be too many things at once, and it's the story that suffers. The musical, directed by Des McManuff, doesn't dig deeply into Summer's story in a way that makes the drama build like it does so well in the ultimate jukebox musical that McManuff directed, \"Jersey Boys.\"\n\nInstead, this musical runs nearly two hours with no intermission and moves too quickly through Summer's life for the story itself to make much impact. It moves quickly through the high points of her life from pre-teen age through the end of her career in a way that doesn't allow the story to breathe.\n\nIt doesn't help that this production has no intermission, making it feel tedious by about the last quarter of the show.\n\nIn this musical, three actresses play Donna at various stages of her life, including preteen/young teen Duckling Donna, Disco Donna and Diva Donna. While Olivia Elease Hardy is cute and sings brightly as the youngest Donna, it's Alex Hairston as Disco Donna who's the most compelling, portraying Summer's formation into a major star. Hairston is super sexy, has an ultra-bright pop voice and moves like a queen.\n\nIn one of the show's better moments of gravitas, her Disco Donna demonstrates to the critics how she can really sing in \"MacArthur Park.\"\n\nDan'yelle Williamson is also a strong singer as Diva Donna. But this actress is working on overdrive, playing the narrator, who feels like our hostess for the evening, plus portraying both the older Donna and Donna's mother, Mary Gaines.\n\nThe book for \"Summer\" touches just briefly on some of the most difficult, controversial moments in this music icon's life. That includes a scene depicting the making of the song that made Summer an international star â€” \"Love to Love You Baby.\" In this scene in Munich, where Disco Donna records her orgasmic moans and groans, she insists that this hypersexy Donna is not the same person she is. This introduces the idea of contradictions between different Summer identities but the concept isn't explored further in the show.\n\nOther serious life moments that the show glosses over include a suicide attempt and a surprising revelation from girlhood. In another scene, Diva Donna's attempt to explain her famous comment about God not creating \"Adam and Steve,\" which was a big controversy with the gay community, feels half-hearted and thrown into the story line. It's followed up with Diva Donna launching into the tune \"Friends Unknown\" as a tribute to all of the lives lost to AIDS.\n\nThe story doesn't delve into race heavily, either. But it has Hairston singing \"White Boys\" in a nod to her role in \"Hair\" in Germany and later has Diva Donna referring to herself as the \"black Marilyn Monroe.\"\n\nStory line aside, \"Summer\" is a very sexy-looking musical with both Hairston and Williamson at the helm with a fabulous all-female ensemble. The ensemble women, who portray both men and women, are utterly fierce executing Sergio Trujillo's choreography. They wear Akron native Paul Tazewell's sexy suiting and disco ensembles like there's no tomorrow, and move seamlessly between feminine and androgynous looks.\n\nMen play a very subsidiary role in this girl power story, with most moving in and out of Donna's life. In one of the strong storytelling moments, Disco Donna stands up to Casablanca record producer Neil Bogart to take control of her career and income in the awesome \"She Works Hard for the Money.\"\n\nThe man who makes the biggest impact in the show, though, is Donna's second husband, Bruce Sudano. He's played with sweet sexiness by Steven Grant Douglas, who creates a winsome chemistry with Hairston's Disco Donna.\n\nArts writer Kerry Clawson may be reached at 330-996-3527 or kclawson@thebeaconjournal.com.
