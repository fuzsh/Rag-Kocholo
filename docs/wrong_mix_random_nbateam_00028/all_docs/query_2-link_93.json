        "text": "Virginia lawmakers banned skill games years ago after rejecting the argument that slot machine lookalikes don’t count as gambling because they involve more skill than luck. An industry push to convince the General Assembly to repeal that ban failed earlier this year.\n\nDespite that failure, a new type of machine is showing up in Virginia convenience stores based on the legal theory that some skill game variations involve no skill at all.\n\nA chief proponent of that theory is former Virginia delegate Steve Heretick, a Hampton Roads-area lawyer who has issued written opinions used by skill game companies and convenience store owners to claim some of the machines can be operated in Virginia because, skill game branding aside, there’s zero skill involved.\n\nIn an interview, Heretick said his interpretation only applies to so-called “pre-reveal” games, which give players the option of looking ahead to see whether upcoming spins will produce a winning combo of symbols or not. Because players can study the machine to see what’s coming next and choose not to play, Heretick argues, there’s no element of chance that would make the games a form of gambling.\n\nWith no way for the player to change an outcome that’s already fixed and knowable, Heretick said, the machines are a form of visual entertainment that involve even less skill than a traditional arcade game like pinball. Therefore, he contends, they’re not subject to the skill game ban and should be considered legal unless a court rules otherwise.\n\n“If you know what’s going to happen and you do it anyway, I can’t say that I would be awfully entertained by that,” Heretick said. “But at the same time, there seem to be an awful lot of people who are.”\n\nIt’s not clear how many skill games or pre-reveal machines remain active, but the brazenness of the effort by some businesses to continue making money from slots-like machines shows the continued weakness of Virginia’s gambling enforcement efforts.\n\nHeretick, a Democrat who served in the House of Delegates from 2016 to 2021, acknowledged his theory hasn’t been fully tested. He said some of his clients have had criminal charges brought against them for operating pre-reveal games, but he’s trying to convince the courts those charges shouldn’t stick because the games aren’t illegal.\n\n“As an attorney, I cannot ever advise a client to commit a crime,” Heretick said. “I can’t and I won’t.”\n\nTad Berman, a Richmond horse racing enthusiast who closely follows gambling issues in Virginia, feels that’s exactly what Heretick is doing.\n\n“Mr. Heretick’s contempt for the law is disturbing enough, but through his actions it is also glaringly obvious that he is encouraging others to break the law,” Berman said in an email this month to the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares. “Mr. Heretick needs to explain himself and the businesses that have resumed operating under the pretense of his letter should be ordered to immediately stop operations or be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nThe attorney general’s office declined to comment when asked if Miyares has looked into the issue or offered guidance to local law enforcement authorities on whether pre-reveal games fall under the skill game ban. When the Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated the skill game ban last year, Miyares offered guidance to local prosecutors on how they should enforce a law that his office had successfully defended in court. The skill game industry had challenged the ban by arguing the machines technically aren’t a form of gambling, but the Supreme Court didn’t buy that claim.\n\nHeretick said his advice to clients would change if a court determines pre-reveal games are in fact banned in Virginia.\n\n‘No Skill’\n\nThe text of Virginia’s skill game ban seems to at least attempt to cover pre-reveal games. Skill games, the law states, “are no less gambling devices if they indicate beforehand the definite result of one or more operations but not all the operations.”\n\nHeretick zeroed in on that line in his legal memo, arguing that definition doesn’t apply to pre-reveal games because they do reveal “all the operations” of the machine.\n\nPolitical activist Josh Stanfield said he observed machines labeled “No Chance Game” up and running in the Yorktown area. A photo he took at a local store shows machines with signs saying “No Skill” and “View All Outcomes Before Playing.”\n\nDel. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who specializes in gambling policy in the General Assembly, said the new emphasis on pre-reveal games shows some companies are “contributing to lawlessness in the commonwealth.”\n\n“Everybody knows what gambling is,” he said. “You put money in and you have the chance of winning money. It doesn’t matter how it happens.”\n\nAt least one company that makes a brand of machines still seen in Virginia contributed money to a PAC that has in turn made donations to General Assembly leaders. North Carolina-based Banilla Games, one of the companies whose games Heretick declared legal, gave $10,000 to the Virginia Skill Game PAC. A representative for Banilla said the company has not retained Heretick, does not directly operate any machines in Virginia and does not make money from any Banilla machines that may be operated by third parties. The company does not agree with Heretick that its games can be operated legally in Virginia.\n\nThat PAC, also funded by a variety of convenience store interests, gave more than $126,000 to General Assembly members across 2023 and 2024. That amount includes $20,000 to House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, $8,000 to Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, and $5,000 to Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax.\n\nAnother company whose games have been cleared by Heretick, Royal Skill Games, contributed $50,000 to the Virginia Asian American Store Owner Association, which has made more than $200,000 in contributions to Virginia politicians.\n\nPace-O-Matic, the Georgia-based skill game company that’s one of the biggest players in efforts to legalize the machines in Virginia, hasn’t turned its machines and has not tried to argue pre-reveal games are legal. A spokeswoman for the company said the confusion is all the more reason for Virginia lawmakers to take action clarifying the issue.\n\n“Inconsistencies in the interpretation of the law is one of the major reasons why lawmakers should return to Richmond as soon as possible to pass legislation on skill games,” said Pace-O-Matic spokeswoman Rachel Albritton.\n\nHeretick agrees that the state should “get its act together and deal with these things once and for all.” But he insisted he and his clients are following the letter of the law.\n\n“If the General Assembly wants to outlaw all games, it certainly can,” he said. “But it didn’t.”\n\nThough Gov. Glenn Youngkin and state lawmakers have agreed to continue discussing skill games despite the governor’s decision to veto the skill game legalization bill in May, it’s unclear whether those talks will continue this year or be put off until 2025.\n\nThere appears to be at least some overlap between convenience stores continuing to operate skill games in defiance of the law and the lobbying coalition that has been trying to convince policymakers to change the law.\n\nA convenience store in western Henrico County had a sign in its window touting skill games on Wednesday afternoon, and the Virginia Mercury observed machines being played inside.\n\nProperty and business records for that store point back to a Chesterfield County address that was listed in lobbying disclosures for the Virginia Amusement Coalition, an advocacy group that hired lobbyists to push for skill game legalization at the General Assembly.\n\nThe Chesterfield location was also listed as the mailing address for the Virginia Skill Game PAC that gave money to General Assembly leaders.\n\nSunil Patel, the treasurer of the PAC, said in an interview that he owns the Henrico building where skill games were operational Wednesday, but had leased it to someone else who is in the process of closing the store, which also doubles as a smoke shop. He said the store’s imminent closure is an example of how small businesses have been hurt by the ban on skill games, but he acknowledged the machines should not have been on at his building.\n\n“Nobody should operate the skill games,” he said.\n\nThe anti-skill game group Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines, which is funded by casino interests, said the continued existence of skill games despite the ban shows those pushing the “shady machines” shouldn’t be trusted to act in good faith.\n\n“It’s laughable that they say they want to prevent illegal games when they’re the ones operating illegal games,” said Nick Larson, a spokesman for the group.\n\nEditor’s note: This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that Banilla Games has not retained Steve Heretick nor asked for his advice on the legality of its machines in Virginia. The company says it only manufactures the machines and is not responsible if a third party is operating them in Virginia.\n\nby Graham Moomaw, Virginia Mercury\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Glenn Youngkin, Virginia is developing policies and guidelines to restrict students’ use of cell phones during school hours. Some educators and advocates question the effort and believe that cell phone-free policies could be hard to enforce and may harm certain students.\n\nResearch shows that some students use cell phones to message people and browse the internet and social media apps during instructional time.\n\nYoungkin signs executive order to establish ‘cell phone-free education’ in Va. public schools\n\nOthers use them to record events in school and post them on various platforms. The resulting videos aren’t always positive: Earlier this month, a Pennsylvania school district acknowledged that several middle school students had made fake TikTok accounts impersonating their teachers, “and apparently made some posts using racist, homophobic and sexually explicit language” according to NPR.\n\n“I hate TikTok,” said Oveta Scott, a teacher in Northern Virginia, at a Thursday listening session hosted by the state’s education department about the proposed cell phone ban in schools. “If I hear another TikTok challenge where they are destroying the bathroom, making noises in class, chirping like birds, I go insane, and I can’t take it anymore.”\n\nBut she said she understands some circumstances in which a child needs a cell phone including for health reasons.\n\nLast Thursday’s listening session was the first of several seeking public input on the future cell phone-free policies and procedures, which school boards must adopt by Jan. 1, 2025, or before. Some of Virginia’s school boards have already begun banning or restricting cell phone use in schools.\n\nThe initiative is spearheaded by the Virginia Department of Education, the Departments of Health, and Health and Human Services as part of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order signed earlier this month that requires the departments to create guidelines to limit students’ time in front of “addictive” cell phones and eliminate “clear distractions” in the classroom.\n\nSenate Democrats also announced on July 10 the creation of a Senate Democratic workgroup on school mobile phone policy.\n\nMany said teacher input on the forthcoming policies is vital to eliminating distractions at a time when questions are circulating about the use of technology in schools and artificial intelligence’s impact on learning.\n\n“I certainly am not opposed to a ban. I just think it’s a bandaid for a much bigger issue that we have in public education that speaks to so many things about how we’re able to hire amazing teachers and retain them,” Del. Laura Cohen, D-Fairfax, a former preschool teacher and school board member.\n\nThe benefits: technology tools, expanded internet access\n\nWhile cell phones are often considered a distraction for students, researchers and professors say they also have their share of benefits and tools that can help with students’ studies, like language translators, rulers and calculators.\n\n“There’s reasons we should be concerned about cell phones as distractions to learning, but they’re also very powerful learning tools potentially, you know, their access to information,” said Jesse Senechal, executive director for the Institute for Collaborative Research and Evaluation in the School of Education at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nSenechal said that cell phones offer support in some cases when schools have a limited number of computers and internet access. He said policies could also create broader equity issues in how marginalized students are disciplined in contrast to socio-economic privileged students.\n\nLeon Rouson, a professor in the School of Education at Norfolk State University, said the phones also allow students to do research without a computer or laptop, which is helpful for high school students he assists in preparing for college during the summer.\n\n“If we say ‘no cell phones, ‘get rid of them,’ ‘throw them out,’ ‘they should not exist’ — I think we would also be creating some disconnection,” Rouson said.\n\nThe challenges: Enforcement questions, negative impacts on some learners\n\nTeachers have also questioned who will enforce cell phone restrictions. Some are worried that the restrictions will create additional responsibilities for teachers and contribute to further burnout.\n\nIn 2022, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission study found that increased workloads and behavioral and mental health issues among students were some of the factors leading teachers to leave the career field.\n\nResearchers also found that teachers were dissatisfied with the lack of respect from parents and the public.\n\nVirginia report shows more teachers leaving the workforce than entering it\n\n“If students are simply told not to have cell phones out during class, then teachers become the cell phone police,” said Nancy Bradley, a Salem City School Board member and associate director for the Office of Academic Programs at Virginia Tech. “As they are trying to teach, they are also trying to monitor which students are on their cell phone and asking that they put the cell phones away or taking the cell phones from these students. It is not a productive use of instructional time.”\n\nWhile studying teacher burnout and their well-being, Tim Pressley, associate professor in the Department of Psychology at Christopher Newport University, found that student behavior has “drastically changed” since returning to in-person learning due to the pandemic. Further research found that students relied heavily on their phones, scrolling through social media and talking through classroom lessons.\n\n“Technology is kind of just getting out of hand with students using it,” Pressley said.\n\nCritics are concerned that parents’ and students’ anxieties about special learners’ needs and gun violence in schools will increase if policies restrict cell phones in schools.\n\nCohen raised similar concerns after an unsuccessful cell phone bill was returned to the House Education Committee for review in March. She said the bill could have negatively impacted English Language Learners and students with disabilities.\n\nThe bill would have empowered local boards to prohibit cell phones and other “handheld communication devices” such as Chromebooks, which can be used to message other students during class.\n\n“We want to make sure … that we are not doing anything to stigmatize or not support our students with disabilities,” Cohen said.\n\nCohen said another common reason parents want their children to have their cell phones is in case of a school emergency, such as a school shooting.\n\nPublic alarm about gun violence in Virginia schools was heightened after a then-six-year-old student brought a firearm from home to his Newport News elementary school and shot his teacher.\n\n“Providing assurance to parents that even if their child doesn’t have their cell phone on them during the school day, that they will receive communication from the school regarding emergency situations, is an important component to get them to buy into the changes to cell phone policies,” Bradley said. “I do think that’s probably going to be one of the tougher hurdles to overcome.”\n\nby Nathaniel Cline, Virginia Mercury\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

While forthcoming polling can help shed more light on a matchup between Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris, the Emerson poll also noted where abortion law could give an edge to Harris’ campaign in Virginia.\n\nForty-four percent of polled Virginia voters “would like to see abortion laws be less strict.” Meanwhile, 35% support laws remaining as they are — legal for any reason up to about 26 weeks, with limited exceptions later — and 21% support more strict abortion laws, the poll showed.\n\nHarris has emerged as a national leader in discussing abortion rights — often noting the prominent role electing Democrats plays in retaining or re-establishing abortion rights around the country. Earlier this year, she visited an abortion clinic — an apparent first a president or vice presidential candidate in America.\n\nAbortion access has been a winning issue for Democrats around the country in state congressional races since the overturn of federal protections two summers ago. In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin led an effort to build consensus around a 15-week ban with limited exceptions after that point and most GOP candidates fell in line last year as the entire state legislature was up for election. Amid heated debates about that key issue, Democrats held their majority in the Senate and gained control of the House of Delegates.\n\nNationwide, a Pew Research Center survey found that two thirds of the country believes abortion should be legal in most or all cases.\n\n“At this critical point in our history, the leadership of women, both at the federal and state levels, has become even more important,” said Virginia state senator Ghazala Hash, D-Chesterfield, who is a voting delegate at next months Democratic National Convention where Harris can formally become the party’s nominee. “On this issue especially, the contrast between Kamala Harris and the dangerous misogyny of Donald Trump is a bright and clear line.”\n\nReproductive rights advocates began lending their support to Harris soon after Biden’s announcement. Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a recent statement that she believes Harris will “continue to fight like hell to rebuild a fundamental right that was stripped away.”\n\nWhile Trump’s campaign has said Virginia is “in play” among other states that could be key to control of Congress and the White House, Harris’ stance on abortion could be one of her strongest policy positions that could lock down Democratic voters and sway others for whom reproductive rights resonate strongly.\n\nEarly in their re-election campaign before Biden dropped out, he and Harris announced restoring federal abortion protections as a key pillar of their platform, and expressed the same sentiment in Virginia. Democratic leaders around the country have also stressed reproductive rights as a key focus of this year’s elections.\n\nAside from abortion, other areas of reproductive rights have emerged as campaign talking points this year as well. When Louisiana’s Supreme Court ruled that embryos are people, it called national access to in vitro fertilization into question. U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia brought Norfolk, Va.-born Elizabeth Carr as his State of the Union address guest this year — she was the first American born of IVF. Democratic members of Congress have pressed for a bill to support IVF access nationwide.\n\nThey’ve also tried to pass a similar measure to protect contraception, as have state lawmakers Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News. Though Hashmi and Price’s measure passed the state legislature, it was vetoed by Youngkin.\n\nPrice accused the governor at the time of “aligning with the most extreme parts of the Republican Party despite overwhelming support for right to contraception bills.”\n\nA largely Democratic yet not totally partisan issue, reproductive rights may continue to feature as prominently in Harris’ presidential campaign as they have nationwide.\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico brought the number of senators calling on Biden to drop out to four. A day earlier, Montana Sen. Jon Tester said Biden should drop his reelection campaign and that Democrats should hold an open nomination process at their Chicago convention next month.\n\nIn the U.S. House, 29 Democrats had called for Biden to withdraw from the race by the end of the day July 19.\n\nIn a post following the announcement to his social media site, Truth Social, Trump said Biden was “never” fit to serve as president.\n\n“Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve – And never was!” Trump wrote. “He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement. All those around him, including his Doctor and the Media, knew that he wasn’t capable of being President, and he wasn’t – And now, look what he’s done to our Country.”\n\nMore details of announcement\n\nIn the letter, Biden praised his administration’s accomplishments over three-and-a-half years, saying he’d worked to make “historic investments” in the country, lowered prescription drug costs, nominated the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court and “passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world.”\n\n“Together we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,” Biden wrote. “We’ve protected and preserved our Democracy. And we’ve revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world.”\n\nBiden said he would “speak to the Nation later this week” about the decision.\n\nHe praised Harris and other supporters.\n\n“For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected,” he wrote. “I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me.”\n\nIn follow-up posts, Biden said he was endorsing Harris and added a fundraising link.\n\n“My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,” he said. “And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”\n\nTrump gains in polls\n\nThe about face in what was to be a 2020 presidential election rematch leaves Democrats searching for a new candidate as Trump, who promises authoritarian-style leadership, has gained support in recent polls.\n\nWith just 107 days until Election Day, Biden’s move marks the latest date in modern presidential history that a candidate has withdrawn from the race.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson announced in March 1968 that he would not seek reelection that year, leaving Democratic delegates to decide on a replacement – ultimately Vice President Hubert Humphrey – at the party’s convention that summer in Chicago.\n\nHarris appears to be in a strong position to replace Biden as the party’s standard bearer, though questions remain about how the process will play out and who would become the vice presidential nominee.\n\nDemocrats praise decision\n\nReaction poured in shortly after the Sunday afternoon announcement, with Democrats largely praising Biden’s record and calling his decision courageous.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that he understood Biden’s decision to step out of the race was “not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.”\n\n“Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being,” the New York Democrat said.\n\nSeveral Republicans called for Biden to resign his office.\n\n“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,” House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X. “He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”\n\nA crescendoing chorus to step down\n\nBiden faced calls for him to abandon his reelection bid from congressional Democrats, even as he tried to stabilize the debate aftershock by holding a series of campaign rallies, sitting down for interviews and holding a press conference at the annual NATO conference.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers largely presented a public front of support for Biden in statements and passing interviews in the U.S. Capitol hallways with reporters.\n\nWhat began as a trickle of dissent from rank-and-file Democrats — beginning with Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas and a handful of doubtful senior House Democrats — steadily grew to a torrent by Friday.\n\n50-year career in Washington\n\nBiden’s exit marks the closure of a long, storied career in Washington, including 38 years in the U.S. Senate, featuring stints leading the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees, and eight years as vice president under President Barack Obama.\n\nBiden’s presidency was punctuated with major economic wins for Democrats, beginning with nearly $2 trillion to combat the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHis leadership with a Democratic majority in Congress resulted in substantial nationwide infrastructure investments, drove financial incentives to tackle climate change and revive the U.S. global role in semiconductor manufacturing, and strengthened flagging tax enforcement.\n\nHowever, low approval ratings followed Biden throughout his presidency as Americans aimed their frustrations over inflation at the White House and assigned blame for record numbers of border crossings as a divided Congress – after Democrats lost their House majority in the 2022 midterms – failed to pass immigration restrictions negotiated with the administration.\n\nBiden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war also hurt his support among young and progressive voters as Israel’s continued offensive against Hamas militants in the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip killed tens of thousands of civilians. Protesters against the U.S. supply of weapons to Israel interrupted dozens of Biden’s reelection campaign events through 2024.\n\nAriana Figueroa contributed to this report.\n\nby Jacob Fischler, Virginia Mercury\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

The issue is due to a single bug in a software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which provides antivirus software for Microsoft users.\n\nThe company pushed out an update to the software overnight, and at 1:30 a.m. EST, CrowdStrike said its “Falcon Sensor” software was causing Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, Reuters reported.\n\nCrowdStrike President and CEO George Kurtz released a statement early Friday morning on X, saying that the incident was not a security concern or a cyberattack. He added that the issue has been identified and that the company has been deploying a fix.\n\n“We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website,” Kurtz said.\n\nThe bug was causing major delays and cancellations at airports across the globe. Flight tracking data site FlightAware noted nearly 24,000 delays and 2,300 cancellations globally by 9:30 a.m. Friday. While some airlines have been able to resume operation of their digital systems, others are finding analogue solutions in the meantime.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation said it was monitoring the situation and suggested those experiencing travel delays and cancellations to use its FlightRights.gov website to help navigate their delays in travel.\n\nSome states’ 911 and non-emergency lines were experiencing issues, including Alaska, Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nThe major tech snafu reverberated throughout Virginia, where 30% of Friday’s flights at Richmond International Airport were cancelled or delayed. At Dulles Airport in Northern Virginia, multiple airlines reported system outages “that are impacting flight operations,” according to a tweet posted on the airport’s X account Friday. Metro’s website and some internal services were down Friday morning, as well as the MetroAccess call center. Various hospitals, businesses and emergency services across the commonwealth were also impacted.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin released a statement on Friday morning that said the state assessed how the tech outages were unfolding in Virginia and found that “government administrative functions are experiencing disruptions, and we are coordinating with local, regional and federal authorities and private sector critical infrastructure partners in order to reestablish normal operations.” The governor asked the public to be patient amid delays as officials work to resolve the problems.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy released a statement early Friday morning saying that the state had activated its State Emergency Operations Center in response to the disruptions and has provided guidance to other agencies about how to work through the situation.\n\n“We are also engaging county and local governments, 911 call centers, and utilities to assess the impact and offer our assistance.,” he said.\n\nMicrosoft released a trouble shooting guide on X early Friday morning.\n\nBy 10 a.m. Friday, some global companies were seeing relief in their outages. Downdetector, which tracks real-time outages, showed companies like Visa, Zoom, UPS and Southwest Airlines gaining more normal operations than they were experiencing in the early morning hours.\n\nSpeaking to the hosts of Today this morning, Kurtz said he was “deeply sorry for the impact we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected.” He said some customers have been able to reboot and are seeing progress getting online, and that trend will likely continue throughout the day.\n\nEffects from the global IT outage Friday continued to be felt throughout the day, especially by government systems and transportation hubs.\n\nCourts in Massachusetts and New York experienced disrupted service, as court transcription recording systems were not operational in some Massachusetts courthouses, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety, which runs its driver’s license offices, also closed their offices for the day, with “no current estimate” on when they will reopen.\n\nAround 4 p.m. EST, Kurtz released more statements on X, reiterating that the outage was not a security breach.\n\n“We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” he said. “We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”\n\nKurtz said the company is working on a “technical update and root cause analysis” that they will share with customers, and shared a letter that was sent to customers and partners.\n\n“We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this. I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you’re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives. Our blog and technical support will continue to be the official channels for the latest updates,” it said. “Nothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike. As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we’re taking to prevent anything like this from happening again,” it continued.\n\nVirginia Mercury Editor Samantha Willis contributed to this story.\n\nby Paige Gross, Virginia Mercury\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Glenn Youngkin Friday leaned into his All-of-the-Above energy plan that calls for continued use of natural gas, despite scientists stating human use of fossil fuels is causing climate change’s increasingly intense storms.\n\n“We need more gas. We need more solar and wind and we need nuclear and we are going to lead the nation here and that is going to be a wonderful thing to see,” Youngkin said. “I get frustrated by people who talk about ‘either-ors.’ Small minded people, in my mind, constantly drive us into the ‘either-or. We can either do this or do that.’ I firmly reject that.”\n\nYoungkin’s comments came during a speech at the third annual Virginia Energy Summit, sponsored largely by gas companies, in Virginia Beach.\n\nBefore the event, Youngkin’s speech was presented to the public as an update to his energy plan, released in October 2022. State law dictates a new plan needs to be released every four years, with updates coming by Oct. 1 in the third year of a governor’s term. No formal update was provided at Friday’s event, but one is expected in the coming weeks.\n\n“The Governor’s revision to the 2022 Energy Plan will reiterate the vision he outlined two years ago and chart a path forward for Virginia to meet the unprecedented needs of Virginia’s power economy,” said spokeswoman Macaulay Porter in a statement, while touting the state’s economic activity.\n\nThe speech came after Youngkin, previously discussed as a former vice presidential candidate, regained national attention this week by speaking at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It’s not clear if Youngkin is continuing to pursue any higher office, but in the same time period North Dakota governor, Greg Burgum, has been floated as a potential appointee to an energy position within the administration of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, if he were to win.\n\nYoungkin’s support for natural gas is a familiar message, recently shared in Louisiana with a suite of other Republican governors who attacked the energy policy of current Democratic President Joe Biden, who is also the presumed Democratic nominee for president. Biden has reiterated his commitment to the race, despite mounting calls for him to step aside.\n\nYoungkin unveiled his first energy plan in 2022, which calls for using natural gas, nuclear and a revaluation of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the 2020 landmark law that seeks to decarbonize the state’s electric grid by mid-century. His plan also called for restoring authority to the State Corporation Commission to adjust rates, such as reducing rate adjustment clauses, or the fees tacked on to bills so Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company can recover costs for generation sources.\n\nEnvironmental and ratepayer advocates criticized his plan, saying it’s unrealistic because it incorporated unproven technologies and inaccurately attributed electric bill increases to renewable energy sources that are needed to combat climate change.\n\nLegislatively, Youngkin’s negotiations were instrumental in providing ratepayer protections, and restoring authority to the SCC to set rates as it sees fit, in a bill that Dominion initially introduced to increase its profits.\n\nBut critics also point to his desire to leave the California clean car standards, which aims to transition drivers to electric vehicles, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market that requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for each short ton of carbon they emit. The proceeds from those allowances had led to almost $800 million in revenue being returned to the state for flood resiliency and energy efficiency programs.\n\n“I’m a conservationist,” said Youngkin, who told the Associated Press in 2022 he thinks climate change is a threat. “We have done more investing in our last two-and-a-half years in promoting the long-term interests of the Chesapeake Bay and rivers and streams and air quality in the commonwealth of Virginia than any other administration in the history of the state, in my view.”\n\nWalton Shepherd, Virginia policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said after the speech that Youngkin’s “refusal to bring even a single practical idea for tackling Virginia’s catastrophic climate change, and instead doing his best to ensure Virginia does nothing at all about it, is the epitome of narrow minded hyperpartisanship.”\n\nLee Francis, deputy director with the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, responded to Youngkin’s speech by saying “It’s bold to call people who are working to solve our largest environmental threat — climate change — ‘small minded.’”\n\n“‘Small minded’ is pretending this isn’t a problem,” Francis added. “I’m glad Youngkin thinks he’s a conservationist. Maybe he’ll start to act like one one of these days.”\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
