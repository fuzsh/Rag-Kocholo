Being a rebel, I fled and gravitated over to The Beatles and classic rock(Rush, Zep, Aerosmith, and of course ELO).I played in several club bands around Virginia before moving to California, where I landed with the indie recording group The Mineral Kings. Not getting “rich” or “famous” (I would’ve taken either one) I got a regular job as a music pastor. Pay was average but the benefits were “out of this world,” or so I was told. Next, I moved back to Virginia, where I have continued to be involved with music as a guitarist with several local bands, as well as Evil Woman–The American ELO. I’ve additionally done a couple of soundtracks for some indie films and recorded with many local artists. Future plans include becoming “rich” or “famous” (I’ll take either one).\n\nAs a 2020 member of the Evil Woman –The American ELO project, Michael seized the invitation to play alongside “the finest musicians and join the most magical show ever.”Michael has played all over the U.S. throughout his musical tenure as part of cover bands and performing original music, including playing several shows for Chuck Berry over a period of two years when he was 19.
