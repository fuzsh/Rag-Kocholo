        "text": "The Wanderer hands down is my favorite Donna Summer album, for many reasons. Summer exploring her faith in such relatable themes to the listener has always struck me as the album's biggest triumph. I've never gotten notions of fundamentalist hubris or condescension from songs like \"Looking Up\" or \"I Believe In Jesus\". Instead, Summer's accounts come across as an individual's spiritual understanding, intending to inspire her listeners to perhaps understand their own even if they may not be the same as hers. There's nothing at all judgemental or accusstional about this album. Not to mention how hard it rocks.\n\nThis 40th Anniversary edition adds new mixes, in extended plus edited versions, of the title track, \"Looking Up\", \"Nightlife\" & \"Grand Illusion\". Of the samples I've heard, the remix of \"The Wanderer\" kills the kinetic energy of the original. Instrumentally, along with Donna's jittery reading, the original quite explicitly conveys the nervous anxiety of remaining in one place when all you want to do move on. This new mix sounds lethargic & hampered by it's weight. \"Looking Up\" is robbed of it's urgency & the arena rock of \"Nightlife\" is reduced to pointless club hack. \"Grand Illusion\" simply sounds like a fan mix posted on YouTube.\n\nThis is the 3rd reissue of this album in the past 5 years. Overkill. I have to say that I'm a bit surprised & turned off by the amout of product that's been pandered to Summer's fanbase since her passing. She was the last artist whose estate I would have thought would have exploited her legacy to the degree it has been. What would have been essential for fans would have been definitive editions of her albums, assembled based on fan feedback. A rarities anthology & perhaps the appearance of unreleased albums would be welcomed punctuations. Instead, there have been multiple reissues of albums that have each come short of their potential. Of course, I understand there are legalities involved, last wishes of the artist, lost/damaged archives, and that not everyone will be pleased however meticulous the assembly of a tracklisting may be. However, by this point Summer's very loyal fanbase is just seeming to be taken advantage of. Now, having said all this...I am waiting for my copy to arrive. But I promise--I won't even fork over Monopoly money for a 4th reissue of this album!\n\nI feel the opposite, she's barely been exploited IMO. Yea, it's getting a 40th anniversary set, but so what? Since she died in 2012, we got ONE new song in 2013, they've basically been repackaging the same stuff and having new remixes. She worked on so many scrapped albums in the last 20 years of her life and yet nothing has been released. Compared to the endless Prince and Bowie stuff we've gotten since their deaths, it's been mostly chump change with Donna, and we know there's a lot out there.\n\nI actually like the idea of it getting a 40th because its an album that sadly seems to be overlooked in the canon of her catalogue, post-disco but while The Wanderer was a top 5 hit, it doesn't seem to have the popularity She Works Hard or This Time I Know It's For Real have for her 80s hits, and it's nice that for once the spotlight is being set on this album\n\nI just wish the would release the very underrated “Crayons” on vinyl... as Donna’s final album released in her lifetime, it should get more recognition...\n\nThe Wanderer produced no hits in the U.K. but it’s a real grower of an album. I didn’t buy it for years, but when I did it became my favourite 80s Donna Summer record\n\nI have no memory of it coming out in the U.K. Though it obviously did. I bought many years later curious to see what the follow up to Bad Girls was like. The answer was it was nothing like it at all. Great LP though. Nice and tight after the lengthy double albums Donna often put out in the 70s.\n\nI like the look of the packaging on the new issue, but other than that there doesn’t seem to be much reason to buy it.\n\nActually, Donna's tapes are probably one of the few that survived the Universal fire. Two sets of remasters came out after the event, one the japanese remasters for the big box set released after Donna's passing and then a second set (and better sounding than the japanese box) but only available digitally in 2013. -One of the guys involved posted here about it; they worked with original tapes in New York in late 2012. And then there was the Love To Love You Donna remix collection for which they went to the original multi-tracks (with the unofortunate exception of I Feel Love and another track from the Once Upon A Time album) The I Feel Love tapes seem to have been missing for decades; back when they re-released the track in 1995 they had Donna re-record her vocals for the new remixes because the multi-tracks couldn't be located."
