        "text": "Local Artist Check-in: Dylan Korelich\n\nThe sun’s warm milky rays filtered through the vines of the geodesic dome as the afternoon waned into an evening chill. An artist, who had been making giant bubbles only moments before, pokes in his head and points in to the IX building, telling me about a Jesus with red hair. I follow his direction […]\n\nLocal Artist Check-in: Rebekah Wostrel\n\nSleek porcelain vessels crouch on white pedestals and glass color-speckled vases on the opposite side of the dusty hallway. Music sashayed through open doors as I wandered down in the McGuffey basement to the end of the hall, stopping in front of Studio Six. Shallow clay bowls sit in rows on the center table, no […]\n\nLocal Artist Check-in: Lisa Jakub\n\nI first met Lisa at an annual book swap hosted by a mutual friend. Guests entered carrying bags of books and unpacked them on the dining room table into neat stacks that covered the whole surface, while a spread of delectable treats enticed us into the kitchen. I thought Lisa looked very much like the […]\n\nLocal Artist Check-In: Suz Somersall\n\nWhen you walk into Suz Somersall’s store, located in the Shops at Stonefield, you’ll first be greeted by a little dog named Creasie, a Yorkie mix that Suz adopted while living in Japan. Suz has traveled to many different places, and as you talk to her about the jewelry she crafts you get a sense […]\n\nLocal Artist Check-in: Jean Sampson\n\nPainter and poet Jean Sampson has a long history with the building that houses the McGuffey Art Center as she graduated there in 1960 from what was formerly McGuffey Elementary School. She now paints in her studio and teaches two classes: “Gutsy Abstract Oil Painting” on Monday nights and “Beginning Drawing for Chickens” on Tuesday […]\n\nLocal Artist Check-In: Rich Tarbell\n\nPhotographer Rich Tarbell has collaborated with Stephanie Helvin and Mallory Paige of Moonlight Circus to create silhouettes that convey the movement and strength in their aerial acts. Tarbell says, “It occurred to me the aerialist acts would make for a mysterious and attractive silhouette fully body portrait… We rented the warehouse of the IX Art […]\n\nLocal Artist Check-In: Charlene Cross\n\nAt the McGuffey Art Center downtown, housed in a building that has stood since 1916 and used to serve as a school, you will find jewelry-maker Charlene Cross’s studio, among 44 other artists renting space. Among those other artists is painter Jean Sampson who describes Cross as “a wonderful and extremely creative jewelry-maker.” The McGuffey […]\n\nInside the Big Blue Door Story Slam V\n\nSound check is at 7:15pm and I arrive at Bon a few minutes early. Jen and Joel Jones, the founders and producers of Big Blue Door, are setting up chairs and selling tickets, Lewis Reining is checking the sound (and probably practicing the story he will also tell), and the ballots are stacked on a […]\n\nChecking in with the Locals: Lauren Stonestreet\n\nCharlottesville is a city filled with local-loving people, and a spirit of community and collaboration unlike anywhere else. Every week, Cville Niche will celebrate that spirit by featuring a local’s top picks. Check out previous local check-ins! Lauren Stonestreet This local lady is a photographer and creative director, dancer, and musician. Her presence is invigorating, and […]\n\nLocal Artist Check-in: Emily Hancock\n\nBeyond the city, off 250 West just before Three Notched Road leads you into Crozet, a large sign in the shape of a hand points you to The Barn Swallow during open hours. It was here on a recent dark winter’s night that I turned in toward the barn that has stood since the 1800s, […]"
