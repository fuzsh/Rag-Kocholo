        "text": "Kanye West's copyright infringement drama continues as the rapper is now facing \"copyright infringement\" accusations from Donna Summer's Estate for allegedly using the late singer's song sample without permission.\n\nAs Ye holds listening parties for his newest album release Vultures, the 46-year-old rapper has been under fire from numerous parties for featuring throwback song samples without consent from the original artist. Saturday Donna Summer's Estate, who handles all of the copyright deals on behalf of the late singer, took to social media calling out Kanye for allegedly still using the singer's 1977 hit song I Feel Love after they denied his original request.\n\nIn an Instagram story post, the official Donna Summer's account shared a text image that read: \"Kanye West...asked permission to use Donna Summer's song I Feel Love, he was denied...he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it's I Feel Love...copyright infringement!!!\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Kanye West calls out Taylor Swift in new song after bitter feud that 'took her down'\n\nWhile many are outraged that Kanye is continuing to sample songs without permission, many believe that in this case the rapper could be in the clear as he moved forward with changing the lyrics and having a new voice sing Donna's song. Many fans also trolled the post online as the estate tagged Universal Music Group in the post after they publicly dropped the rapper back in 2022 following his string of controversial antisemitic comments.\n\nThe account then also went on to tag Sharon Osbourne who has been vocal about her outrage towards Kanye after the rapper was also involved in a copyright row with her husband Ozzy Osbourne. Earlier this week, the 75-year-old rocker to social media bashing the rapper for using a sample of his song Iron Man after he directly denied him permission for due to him believing Kanye is \"an antisemite.\"\n\nOn Instagram, Ozzy posted a white screen with black text that read in all capital letters: \"Kanye West asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of 'War Pig' from the US Festival without vocals & was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many. He went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!\""
