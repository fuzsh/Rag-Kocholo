        "text": "Kanye West and collaborator Ty Dolla $ign (Tyrone Griffin) have settled the lawsuit with the Donna Summer Estate over unauthorized use of the disco icon’s hit song.\n\nWest and Griffin included Summer’s track I Feel Love on their most recent album titled Vultures 1 track, Good (Don't Die), that dropped on January 12 of this year.\n\nBy February, the estate of late Summer sued the hip-hop duo for 'unauthorized interpolation' of her tune.\n\nKanye West faces another lawsuit as Donna Summers' estate files over Vultures\n\nBianca Censori’s face covered completely in hosiery has fans concerned\n\nAccording to official court documents filed on June 20, attorneys for both West and Summer’s estate released that the two have \"entered into a settlement agreement that is a full and final settlement of all of the claims in the action.”\n\nThe documents state that each side will handle their own financial responsibilities from the legal dispute.\n\nFollowing the settlement, Larry Stein, lead counsel for the Summer estate, revealed the finalized agreement does not include permission for the rapper, 47, to use the late singer’s material in any future work.\n\nThis includes the upcoming second part of his shared project with Griffin, Vultures 2, which was set to be released on May 3 but has not yet surfaced.\n\n“We did not license the song. As part of the settlement, they have agreed not to distribute or otherwise use the song. So we got what we wanted,” Stein added.\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nKanye West 'had 3-hour sex session with A-lister fuelled by Viagra' says lawsuit [REVEALED]\n\nKanye West denies lawsuit claiming he fired employee for refusing to cut dreads [LATEST]\n\nKanye 'followed ex-employee to restroom to ask for threesome,' lawsuit says [INSIGHT]\n\nThe lawsuit filed by the ‘Queen of Disco's’ husband, Bruce Sudano, stated that the musicians “arrogantly and unilaterally decided they would simply steal\" the 1977 soul track after previously being denied permission from the singer’s estate.\n\nPer the filing, the pair was “explicitly denied” permission as the late singer’s estate “wanted no association with West’s controversial history.”\n\n“Despite this denial, Defendants shamelessly used instantly recognizable portions of Summer’s hit song, ‘I FEEL LOVE,’ on their recently released collaborative album, ‘Vultures 1,’ and in recorded live concerts,” the court documents read.\n\nRepresentatives for West have yet to release a public statement regarding the settlement."
