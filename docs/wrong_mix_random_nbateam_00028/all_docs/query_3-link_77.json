        "text": "A reminder that Central Virginia Watercolor Guild is found online at www.CVWG.art.\n\nThe painting at the top of this post is one of 3 by member artist Linda Suomi Bethke about using alcohol to bring out some sharp but uncontrollable edges. You can view this painting, better, along with Linda’s two other paintings on our website.\n\nMea Culpa! Giving Marcy Springett Proper Attribution\n\nMy apologies to member artist Marcy Springett! In my last post, I failed to attribute the painting, above, to Marcy as its rightful artist. Marcy was extremely gracious in correcting me. I do not know how I made the error but, regardless, my apologies.\n\nCVWG’s Member Meeting in May at Our Exhibition at The Center\n\nCVWG’s member meeting on May 22 convened at The Center at Belvedere in Charlottesville to enjoy our 2023 exhibition, “In The Garden“.\n\nMember artists Carol Greene and Patty Richmond snapped and sent these photos and Carol sent the following review:\n\nI thought the exhibit was done very professionally and all the paintings were beautiful. Donna and her team of helpers did an excellent job. Our members that provided their art for this exhibit are to be congratulated and it was well attended. As always, our hospitality ladies provided a wonderful and tasty variety of refreshments which were also aesthetically pleasing in their arrangement. The meeting was short and sweet. I particularly liked the added touch of the spring themed hats that many of our members wore for this event.\n\nCarol Greene\n\nYou can still view CVWG’s exhibition at The Center at Belvedere through end of June. CVWG’s leader for this exhibition is Donna Koutrakos.\n\nLinda Suomi Bethke “Painting” with Alcohol\n\nMember Linda Suomi Bethke and I are collaborating on a different set of paintings for upcoming posts. In meantime, she sent these stunning wide-format paintings she has recently made using alcohol to help bring out sharp edges. Says Linda,\n\nThese paintings– going to my gallery soon– are on watercolor canvas. The fun part is that the rocks and rough foregrounds have been done with 90 proof alcohol. It’s a neat technique to make rocks and rugged landscapes. I’ve been in a Scottish Highlands frame of mind.\n\nI can share with some of the members about how to do that one of these days at a meeting, if interested.\n\nLet Linda or our programs directors know of your interests.\n\nCVWG Board and Member Meeting on June 26\n\nA note to all Board Members that President Karen Schwenzer has called a Board Meeting AND we have our next member meeting on June 26 returning to our “usual” venue and format. Our tentative agenda:\n\n11:00 AM Board of Director Meeting (all members welcome to attend!)\n\n12:30 PM Member Gathering & Social Time\n\n1:00 PM CVWG Business Meeting\n\n1:30 PM Program by artist Mary Shira. Read more about Mary here.\n\n3:00 PM Adjourn\n\nA reminder that this month’s Challenge! theme is Favorite Flowers. Bring along a new painting for the theme and share it with our Guild.\n\nWe meet at our usual venue in Fellowship Hall at The Church of Our Saviour on Rio Road in Charlottesville. You can read about our meetings here.\n\nFollow Up on April’s Program with Toni Bragg\n\nMember artist Linda Abbey sent two updates from artist Toni Bragg from our program Toni led in April 2023. Toni promised our members a list of her paints and a color wheel. Both are posted below in a format you can view, download, and print if you desire.\n\nMember News\n\nMember artist Janice Bunny Creasy sent us notice that the 2023 Juried Art Exhibition at the Virginia Mennonite Retirement Community in Harrisonburg is ongoing through June 27. On a quick scan I noticed several SVWG member artists have been accepted into this exhibition. Plan a day-trip to visit the exhibition and send us an email of your experience.\n\nWe’d Love to Hear From You!"
