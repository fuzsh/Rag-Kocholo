        "text": "Congrats, Ritu, and Welcome!\n\nSo delighted to have you here today, your book launch day for LION OF THE SKY!\n\nHappy to be here, Dionna. Thanks for inviting me!\n\nInquiring minds want to know. How did you find your way to becoming a kidlit author?\n\nI have always loved to write, just for the joy of creating with words. As a child, I kept a secret diary and wrote letters to pen-pals, but what I loved most was writing poems whenever I took public transport. One day, I won a poetry competition in high school with a poem that I’d scribbled from the top deck of a moving double-decker bus and won a cash prize! I entered every writing competition I could after that and, to date, my poems have won me money, tickets to Paris, tickets to the cinema, furniture vouchers, and even a Kindle! Though I always seemed to find myself in bookstores and even asked for a typewriter for my twelfth birthday, it didn’t occur to me that writing was written in my future. Then one day, many years after I had become a high school English and Drama teacher…my 8-year-old daughter asked me a homework question...\n\nYou’ve piqued my interest! What did she ask you, and how did her question lead to you writing LION OF THE SKY, your debut MG novel-in-verse?\n\nIt was a homework question she needed help answering. Why do people migrate? I decided it was time to share with her our family's history. No matter how tragic, I believed she needed to know it.\n\nShare the history, please!\n\nSure! It began in 1947 as India became independent from British rule, the subcontinent was divided into two countries—a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. The divide left millions of Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims living in the \"wrong\" country. Hostilities grew. Mass killings ensued. Millions had to flee to safety, including my grandparents and parents, who survived the largest mass migration in world history.\n\nTo help my daughter understand that dark, chaotic, and tumultuous time, I took her to the library. Though we found books about the Holocaust and the World Wars, we couldn’t find one children’s book about the Partition of India. My daughter accused me of making the whole thing up. It broke my heart. For days after our library visit, I thought about the fourteen million people who lost their homes and the one million who died. I decided to write the children’s book I couldn’t find for my daughter. I joined the Society for Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators, and in 2017 self-published a picture book about our family’s history, GOPE AND MEERA–A MIGRATION STORY.\n\nThat's an incredible story, a sad slice of history, one many living in the United States may know little about. It's understandable you wanted your daughter to know about it. What does she think of her family history now?\n\nNow all three of my children feel like they’re experts on the Partition! They are very proud of their elders for the determination and resilience they showed in adapting to new cultures and languages, whilst making sacrifices so their children could thrive. My kids also feel empowered with a new understanding that adversity of all kinds can be overcome with courage and the right mindset.\n\nTrue this!\n\n(C) Tara Anand, taraanandart.com\n\n\"D​rawing from family history, Hemnani delivers a wrenching historical verse debut...Compelling stakes ratchet up the tension in this illuminating and harrowing story about displacement, grief, and hope.\"\n\n​Publisher's Weekly Starred Reviewfor LION OF THE SKY\n\n​Though the setting of LION OF THE SKY is based on your family’s history, did you still have to do a lot of research?\n\nYes it did! It was years of research focusing particularly on what happened in Sindh. Unlike the provinces of Punjab and Bengal which were split in two, Sindh was given intact to the newly created nation of Pakistan, where both my maternal and paternal grandparents lived. Like my grandparents, many Sindhis were forced to leave their homeland and rebuild their lives in Hong Kong as immigrants. I dug deep into the research and unearthed many treasures. It was important for my family’s narrative to be historically accurate because it’s an inheritance worth sharing.\n\nVery interesting! Thanks for sharing. Why did you decide to use the novel-in-verse format for LION OF THE SKY?\n\nI fell in love with novels-in-verse after reading INSIDE OUT AND BACK AGAIN by Thanhha Lai. I marvel at how each poem captures a concept, scene, or feeling in a few crafted words using language that’s distilled and powerful. I also appreciate how the format uses blank space to give room for the reader’s discovery of meaning and interpretation. I knew that a novel-in-verse would be the perfect vehicle for telling the story of Raj, my main character, and as I explored this format, the seed of lION OF THE SKY was born.\n\nIt sounds like a tug-at-heart read. Despite its setting, does LION OF THE SKY include rays of hope?\n\nHope is at the heart of this book. It is my hope that this will be what my readers are left with.\n\nChanging the subject a little bit, what did you enjoy about working with your Balzer + Bray editor Alessandra Balzer?\n\nAlessandra was so enthusiastic about working with me that I couldn’t quite believe it! I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the editorial process! Alessandra is extremely organized and systematic, and each round of edits was specific, so whether I was working on big-picture edits or focusing on character, setting, or various themes, I never felt too overwhelmed. Alessandra skillfully asked exactly the right questions that helped me distill what I was trying to say. She was quick to respond with insightful comments and enthusiasm, motivating me to dig deeper and infuse nuance into my writing. Her understanding of the heart of my novel helped me enhance its emotional impact, and her ability to see the potential in every scene, pushed me to explore new creative avenues and take risks with my storytelling. Our collaborative effort has resulted in a middle-grade novel that has exceeded my wildest expectations! I learned so much from the process and am grateful for the invaluable lessons and growth it has brought to my writing journey. I am so incredibly grateful to have worked with such a brilliant and insightful editor and am truly honored to join the fantastic list of authors and titles at Harper Collins/Balzer & Bray!\n\nTo be sure! Well, thanks for sharing the story behind your story. It will no doubt inspire many young readers and shine the spotlight on a slice of history that should be learned from and not forgotten. Thanks so much for stopping in, and do keep in touch when your next novel for young readers is ready to roll off the press.\n\nThe pleasure has been all mine.\n\nPurchase your copy of LION OF THE SKY today\n\nRitu Hemnani is a journalist, teacher, voice actor, motivational speaker, and a storyteller who hopes every child will discover books where they can see themselves on the pages within, and will know that their stories matter.

It's truly satisfying to think back on the journey!\n\nAwesome! To get started, tell us how you found your way to becoming a kidlit author.\n\nWay back when I was a preschooler, my mother took me religiously to our public library to check out books and attend story time programs. She instilled in me a love of reading that has accompanied me throughout my life. As a social worker, I used books extensively with children to help them navigate divorces and deaths in their families, as well as fears and friendships.\n\nOnce I became a parent, one of my greatest joys was buying books for my own five children and introducing them to wonderful literature. Writing kidlit was just a natural extension of all of those experiences. For me personally, I had to wait until the timing was right and my youngest child was in school full-time before I could seriously try to get published. In the meantime, I took writing classes, read great award winning titles, and started to do the hard work of learning the craft.\n\nWow! A mom of five, and now a published author. That's an amazing accomplishment! Was THINGS THAT SHIMMER the first manuscript you had acquired by a traditional publisher?\n\nActually, no. I was offered my first book contract shortly after my youngest daughter started school. With raising a large family, however, there were times when I had to step away from writing for months at a time. But now my children are all grown and out in the world, I’m agented, and I just released my third picture book, and now have this exciting debut middle grade novel set to enter the world!\n\nThat's amazing. I'm sure your kids are proud! So What inspired you to write for middle-grade readers?\n\nThe summer I turned nine years old, my family was in a horrific car accident that sent reverberations throughout our family for the rest of my childhood. Back then, the understanding of trauma and its impact on individuals was still in its infancy as PTSD hadn’t even been given its name or been identified as an actual condition. As soldiers began to return from Viet Nam, there was this understanding, a recognition, that they were suffering psychological trauma due to their wartime experiences. Soon mental health professionals began to see the commonalities between war veterans and others who’d been through life threatening experiences. That was the starting point for THINGS THAT SHIMMER; two friends united by their deep understanding of what it’s like to grow up in a family dealing with trauma. But something has to pull them apart—right? That’s what makes a plot interesting!\n\n”A tale of friendship dynamics that doesn’t reach for easy resolutions or immediate forgiveness.”\n\n—The Horn Book Magazine\n\nI'm sorry to hear your family had to go through that. It must have been a real challenge for you as a child. Your characters' emotions will no doubt ring true, and your story sure to be a real heart tugger because of it.\n\nTHINGS THAT SHIMMER is the story of my heart, the idea I had on the very first night I walked into my very first class on writing for children. While it is definitely a work of fiction, emotionally it feels very true, and I hope it resonates for readers wading through the murky waters of friendships, popularity, family relationships, and identity.\n\nImportant themes to be sure. Did you have to revise much after THINGS THAT SHIMMER was acquired by Kar-Ben Publishing?\n\nActually, most of my revising work came before my manuscript was acquired. While querying agents, I got a full request from Susan Cohen, who at the time was an agent at Writers House. Susan liked what she read, but offered me an opportunity to revise and resubmit my manuscript. Both she and her assistant provided me with very specific feedback on how to improve the project, and I spent six months doing two rounds of revisions for them. Afterward, Susan offered me representation and started submitting it to editors! So by the time my editor, Amy Fitzgerald, read it, she didn’t have a lot of requests for big changes. Mostly we cleaned up sentences--an occasional word being replaced or eliminated.\n\nThat says a lot about having an editorial agent. I'm sure you're thrilled you got a chance to work with Susan before she retired. So now that your publication date is here, are you nervous about how kids will receive your book?\n\nI am nervous, but I hope they will enjoy the ride as Melanie Adler navigates the world of the 1970s, while desperately wanting to be accepted by the Shimmers, the popular kids in her class.\n\nI'm sure they will! Well, thanks for stopping by and for allowing us to share in your book launch day!\n\nThanks for the invite, Dionna!\n\nDeborah Lakritz is the author of A PLACE TO BELONG, a picture book biography of beloved Jewish singer/songwriter, Debbie Friedman.

Happy to be here.\n\nDo tell! How did you find your way to becoming a kidlit author?\n\nI have always known I wanted to be an author, but my love of kidlit really blossomed after my daughter was born. We spent countless hours reading and exploring our local libraries. I found myself suddenly bubbling over with picture book ideas of my own. I joined the Society for Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI) in 2017 and began attending conferences and critique groups in order to learn more about both craft and the business of publishing. In 2018, I won the Andrea J. Loney Mentorship that was hosted by my region of SCBWI. That same year, I connected with my agent through #DVpit, an annual pitching event for un-agented, self-identifying historically marginalized authors and illustrators. In early 2019, after a few short rounds of revision, my agent sent my debut picture book MARIANA AND HER FAMILIA out on submission. The book quickly sold at auction, and I officially became a kidlit author!\n\nYour first book sold at auction?! That is amazing!!! MARIANA AND HER FAMILIA went on to win some honors, yes?\n\nIt did! School Library Journal named it a Best Picture Book of 2022. Booklist gave it a starred review, and it received a Junior Library Guild Gold Star!\n\nWowsie!\n\n​So, what inspired you to write your debut middle-grade novel, SING IT LIKE CELIA?\n\nSING IT LIKE CELIA was inspired by both my younger sister’s experiences navigating the unexpected disappearance of her mother from her life and my own experiences growing up with parents who were divorced. In writing the book, I strived to empower children confronting similar challenges to speak up for themselves and set healthy boundaries with the people in their lives. It was also a delight to incorporate my own love of music (and, specifically, legendary salsa singer Celia Cruz) into the book. I grew up singing in choirs and playing the piano, and for a long time was an avid salsa dancer. Music was a way through for so much of my life that I felt it important to give young readers the inspiration to use their own gifts as a means of self-expression and inner strength.\n\nSounds like a project of the heart, to be sure! So, who acquired SING IT LIKE CELIA, and how did it get acquired?\n\nI had just sold another picture book, HOW TO SPEAK SPANGLISH, to Elizabeth Lee at Penguin Workshop, when my agent mentioned to her my interest in writing IP (essentially, work for hire). Elizabeth was new to the imprint and, in building her list, was extremely excited to work on contemporary MG fiction featuring marginalized voices. However, she felt it important that her authors retain copyright and receive a standard advance and royalties, so rather than IP, she offered to work with me on what she called “proactive publishing” terms. We set up a call to discuss ideas and I submitted sample pages and a detailed outline. Elizabeth and her team were so enthusiastic about the book that they offered me a two-book deal!\n\nA two-book deal?! This just keeps getting better and better! What was it like working with Elizabeth?\n\nWorking with Elizabeth has been absolute perfection. I could not be happier that this book was written under her direction and have thoroughly enjoyed working with her on book two!\n\nYour experience makes publishing sound like fun! Well, thanks again for stopping by on your Book Launch Day, and for sharing your kidlit journey up to this point. We're looking forward to learning more about book 2 soon!\n\nHappy to be here, and will do!\n\nMónica Mancillas, born in the small coastal town of Ensenada in Baja California, México, moved with her parents to the United States when she was two-years-old. As a child, she loved nothing more than to study and explore self-expression through writing and music.

Happy to be here!\n\nSuch an exciting day! May 5, 2024, the day your debut novel for kids ages 10-14 publishes with Levine Querido! Please share what your book is about.\n\nAbsolutely! It's about a young girl who wants two things: to get her period, and to thwart her mom's plan to take her to Guatemala, a place that has always been more of a mystery than an answer. One day, she discovers secret letters between her mom and a disappeared feminist-journalist aunt, giving Mani both a lesson in Guatemalan history, but also in how to stand up to some of the injustices going on around her. While at school, Mani and her best friends, Las Nerdas, take action and speak up, demanding the right to feel safe while the administration turns a blind eye to the way they are constantly being harassed, assaulted, groped, bullied, recorded, abused, and humiliated by other students. As the story unfolds, Mani finds her voice.\n\nWow. Some might say that's a tough topic for young readers. What do you say?\n\nIt's true, that the topic may me \"tough,\" but girls as young as 12 are up against tough circumstances, and they, like Mani, may be shy and need to find the courage to speak up.\n\nTrue this. What inspired you to write your book MANI SEMILLA FINDS HER QUETZAL VOICE?\n\nSo many things! It all started with a question. Someone asked me if I remember the first time I got my period. All of a sudden, it came back to me. I was eleven and visiting my mother's side of the family in Guatemala City. I was standing on top of a slide in Burger King. My second cousins were taunting me for my (at the time) thick accent in Spanish. The question and memory inspired me so much that when I got home I wrote a story about a Guatemalan-American girl obsessed with getting her period and eager to enter womanhood. Over a year, it morphed from a story about periods into a story about discovering secret letters from disappeared journalist aunts, mother-daughter relationships, coming into activism, and exploring the question about what it means to be a feminist at any age. As someone who has Guatemalan, Hawaiian, German and Filipino heritage, I was also inspired to write a character whose interest in her history and heritage is more of a journey with plenty of ups and downs.\n\nIt's been said that to make a book that's full of heart and authenticity, we should write what we know, and more importantly what we feel. You certainly did that! No wonder your book has gotten so many stellar reviews!\n\n“Anna Lapera expertly voices a young girl’s middle school trials, but with a voice so unique and heartfelt you will be cringing one moment and cheering the next. She weaves a distinctive story filled with humor, family heartache, and secrets while a young girl releases the fear of her voice and grasps its power.” --Newbery Medalist Donna Barba Higuera\n\nWhat did you enjoy about working with your editor as you revised MANI SEMILLA FINDS HER QUETZAL VOICE?\n\nI have been so lucky that the people who have helped bring MANI to life REALLY loved and understood her voice. My editor, Irene Vázquez at Levine Querido, helped MANI's voice to really shine. It was so clear to me that they understood Mani as a character. I NEVER had to clarify or explain something about why Mani would say this or that. They just got it. In fact, they showed me ways we could push Mani's voice and Mani-isms even further. Each round of edits got closer to the heart of the story and to Mani's voice. I had so much fun with the editing process!\n\nNo doubt the fun spilled out from the process and onto the page! As an ESL middle-school teacher, a mother of a 6-year-old and 1-year-old, and a wife, how do you juggle your responsibilities and still find time to write?\n\nThe answer to this question always changes! I am constantly trying to find how and when to write. It's day by day. Thankfully, my husband does most of the cooking, which gives me some writing time. That helps! I wrote the first draft of MANI SEMILLA FINDS HER QUETZAL VOICE from 4 to 6 a.m. every single day over the course of one year. Some people are impressed when I tell them how early I wake up to write, but I am impressed with people who are able to stay up late writing! I have not been able to be a night-writer. As a teacher and mom, that was literally the only time I had available to me. Now that I have another little one, there are days when I simply just don't get to write more than one sentence.\n\nWhat are you working on now, besides taking care of your little one, and promoting your new release?\n\nI am working on book number two, so I am slowly getting back to my morning writing sessions, because that is my time when no one else is awake. That doesn't mean that I feel super inspired every morning. I keep telling myself that what I am working on is just a first draft and that it doesn't have to be amazing right away. I am really into running and I've heard people in the sports and running world talk about how discipline is more important than motivation. I remind myself that sometimes when the writing doesn't sound pretty!\n\nPerspiration and pushing through accomplishes much! Well, Anna, congrats once again on your release, and for allowing me to have a small share in celebrating it's release today, and please do check back in when I can celebrate Book 2!\n\nThank you, Dionna! And will do!\n\nAnna Lapera is a writer, educator and sometimes runner based in the DC area. She comes from a Guatemalan mother and Hawaiian-Filipino-German father, and was raised all over the world.

What inspired you to write The Unbeatable Lily Hong?\n\nIt would have meant the world to me to read a book like The Unbeatable Lily Hong when I was a kid! Like my main character Lily, I was a Chinese-American kid who was good at school and into nerdy fandom stuff. Another similarity that I share with Lily is that I also went to Chinese school and did competitive Chinese dance. But those things made me an outsider when I was a kid, so I wanted to write a story about a Chinese-American girl whose differences and interests make her nuanced, irresistibly fun, and unbeatable.\n\nSounds like a story all kids could relate to, and that you had fun writing this book!\n\nThe Unbeatable Lily Hong was so much fun to write! Drawing on my own interests while creating Lily, her friends, and her family, I got to immerse myself in Chinese mythology, school competition, debates about the best dumplings (Lily’s mom makes the best dumplings, duh). Plus, there's a tween frenemy/maybe-more-than-friends dynamic, ​which I would have loved to have read as a kid.\n\n\"A delightfully adventerous romp with a lovably scrappy protagonist.\" Kirkus Reviews\n\nThirteen-year-old Diana in her competitive Chinese dance dress.\n\nHow did the revision process for The Unbeatable Lily Hong go? What was it like working with your editor?\n\n​\n\nMy revision process was surprisingly smooth! I say “surprisingly” because I usually agonize over revisions, but The Unbeatable Lily Hong was just so much fun to write that it didn’t feel like it took a lot of time or energy to revise. However, when I look at my drafts, I can see a lot actually did change.\n\nI was fortunate enough to work with two great editors! Angela Song was my first editor for the bulk of my editing process. Then Alessandra Preziosi took over when Angela left Clarion. I found Angela’s insights to be completely spot-on, and I was happy to say that it was the same with Alex. I also had so much fun bonding with Angela over similar childhood experiences as she edited my book!\n\nHaving an amazing editor step in when an amazing editor steps out sounds like a blessing to be sure! What skill sets did they have that impressed you?\n\nI was most impressed by how they gave feedback that made the story much stronger while still trusting me with the direction of the story. It’s not always easy to balance the author’s vision with needed developmental edits, but they both did it beautifully! I am so grateful to have worked with such brilliant and genuinely lovely editors.\n\nWe bet they were mutually pleased when working with you! I really love your cover, by the way. Were you pleased when you first saw it?\n\nOoh! I cannot gush enough about this amazing cover by Rebecca W. Chan. It’s so fun and vibrant. I cannot wait to see it on the shelf of my local indie, and more importantly, in the hands of young readers.\n\nThat will be the icing on the cake!

Your work fills me with the happiness of sunshine after a gloomy day!\n\nI’m so glad my work makes you smile!\n\nIt really does! Do tell. How did you find your way into becoming a kidlit illustrator?\n\nIt was a long journey! When I graduated college, I decided that as much as I loved illustration, the freelance life was not really for me. So, I chose to pursue a career as a designer and creative director. I did lots of illustrations in the context of my corporate design work, but it wasn’t until my kids left for college that I decided to finally focus on illustrating for children. I used evenings and weekends to take online courses to help build my portfolio and started going to SCBWI conferences and engaging with the kidlit community. It’s been a huge effort to pursue a second career, but it’s so rewarding!\n\n(C) Lisa Bronson Mezoff, lisamezoff.com\n\nSCBWI is a nurturing place for kidlit creatives! Now that you've arrived to the kidlit path, what do you love about illustrating children's books?\n\nIt’s actually a joy on multiple levels! First, I just really love to draw and paint—to imagine people and places and make them come to life. I’m also a truly passionate reader, so it’s a thrill to contribute to the world of books and use art to tell stories that are meaningful to kids. I have to say though, the biggest surprise has been how much I have enjoyed sharing my work on school visits. When Only My Dog Knows I Pick My Nose my debut picture book written by Lauren Tarshis came out, I did dozens of school visits with the author. We had conversations with kids not only about the story itself—its inspiration and meaning—but also about the creative process and our collaboration. The kids were so excited! They went on to draw their own pictures and tell their own stories. Often, teachers sent me the kids’ drawings and thank you notes later—that was amazing!\n\nI can imagine it would be! So nice you were able to join with the author, too!\n\n(C) Lisa Bronson Mezoff, lisamezoff.com\n\nWhy did you especially enjoy illustrating Only My Dog Knows I Pick My Nose that features a boy whose dog has nothing but unconditional love for his not-so-perfect human?\n\nMost of the time, in the children’s book industry, a publisher buys a manuscript and then chooses an illustrator—the author and illustrator rarely even meet. This book was a little different. The author and I are good friends and we collaborated on the project from the beginning. Lauren came to me with just the title (which I love!) and we worked together as the story took shape. We often went back and forth, deciding which elements of the story really needed words, and which ideas could instead be conveyed visually. I feel so lucky to have had that experience—it was so much fun to work together, and I think our partnership made the book much better than it would have been if we had we worked separately.\n\nYou're right. An author and illustrator creating the book before it's acquired is not how it usually happens, but so cool that Orchard Books, an imprint of Scholastic did acquire it as a complete project! I just love the hilarity of the text and illustrations--a perfect picture-book blend!\n\nGlad you enjoyed it! You can learn more about how I made the illustrations HERE in the blog post I wrote for Scholastic.\n\nI'll check it out! Well, thanks oodles, Lisa, for stopping by and for sharing a little about yourself and your process. May Only My Dog Knows I Pick My Nose become a classic in the years to come!\n\nThanks, Dionna!\n\nLisa Bronson Mezoff loves to paint people and scenes that are filled with energy and joy.

Peek inside and you will see George Minor Carr (1882-1933), shop owner and operator of George M. Carr & Company, just one of many businesses located in Vinegar Hill, a thriving African American residential and business district of Charlottesville, Virginia, that was razed in the 1960s.\n\nTrue, Mr. Carr's establishment at 269 West Main Street was a second-hand clothing store. But as you can tell from the fine feathered hats for women in the storefront window, and the men's suits hanging inside that it was no rinky-dink establishment. It was someplace African American men and women of the era could purchase clothing to look their finest when walking about town. And how distinguished they looked when posing for a photograph at the Holsinger Portrait Studio!\n\nWe know from the J.F. Bell Funereal Home records that George Carr's father, David Carr, had been born in Africa, and that his mother Elnora Garland Carr was born in Virginia. We also discover that George's wife's name was Virginia May Carr. Mr. Carr passed away In 1933. Virginia Carr obviously kept the doors of her husband's business open after his death, for she was listed in the 1934 city director as operating a second-hand clothing store at 265 West Main Street.\n\nAnthony and Eileen Buckner\n\nOn August 12, 1918, Anthony T. Buckner (1846-1923) commissioned the above portrait to be taken with his nine-year-old granddaughter Eileen Wood Buckner (1909-1985). When I learned Eileen's mother, Geneva Tonsler Buckner (1886-1919), would die from tuberculosis a year later on August 29, 1919, while being admitted to the Piedmont Sanitorium in Burkeville, Virginia, it made me wonder: Was Eileen's mother ill when this photo was taken? Was that the reason Mr. Buckner had the photograph made? Surely, an ailing mother would greatly appreciate having a copy of this lovely image.\n\n​Another thing I wondered was how, as a young man, Mr. Buckner endured physically, emotionally, and mentally while serving as an enslaved body servant to Mr. Fife, a Confederate soldier, during the Civil War. What I do know is he survived, and once Freedom came, after working just a few years at the University of Virginia, he had saved enough money to open up a successful general store and grocery at 904 West Main Street in Charlottesville--a fine establishment that remained open until his death in 1923.\n\nHow inspiring to see him standing there so tall, refined, and dignified, despite being a survivor of such enduring times!\n\n\"Buckner had made a host of friends for himself during his long sojourn in the community and was especially liked by the residents in the University section. Many had formed the custom of stopping in to converse with him as a token of their esteem and the high place he had won for himself.\" *\n\nMr. Buckner had five children with his wife, Louisa E. (1860-1909)--three girls and two boys. Unfortunately, all but two of them died when they were very young children. Only his son George Walker Buckner (1886-1928) lived well into adulthood.\n\nGeorge, Eileen's father, grew up in Charlottesville. He attended college, and obtained degrees from Hampton Institute and the Virginia Union University. He worked as a teacher, and economics and sociology instructor at the Tuskegee Institute. Later, he remarried and worked for the National League on Urban Conditions, and then served as the vice president and manager of the People's Finance Corporation in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nGeorge caused quite a local stir when he wrote an opinion piece entitled \"The New Negro\" in the February 12, 1921 edition of The Charlottesville Messenger, an African American newspaper. In it he demanded better pay for African-American teachers and the desegregation of streetcars in Charlottesville, among other things. He wrote: \"We are tax payers and law abiding citizens. We know our strength and will accept nothing short of justice.\"\n\nInge's Grocery\n\nIn 1890, George Pinkney Inge (1859-1948) purchased the building and lot located at 331-333 West Main Street for $3,000, and in 1891 he opened his grocery store when West Main Street was nothing but a dirt road.\n\nDespite being born into the institution of slavery, Mr. Inge graduated from Hampton Institute in 1879. For a few years, he taught at Jefferson School in Charlottesville.\n\nMr. Inge's grocery store was known throughout Charlottesville as a fine establishment. His patrons included the hospital of the University of Virginia, professors of the University, the Gleason Hotel, boarding houses, and fraternities. His store was the only supplier of fresh fish and oysters in the city, which were delivered by way of the C & O Railroad. Small game caught by local hunters; vegetables from the Inge's gardens, and eggs and poultry from their chickens were also sold there. Before the Model T came along, the Inges delivered their produce using a horse-and-buggy.\n\nChildren loved to purchase penny candy and five-cent ginger snaps from the glass jars sitting on the store's shelves. My main character's favorite thing to purchase at Mr. Inge's store is Mary Jane candies.\n\nInge's Grocery\n\nMr. Inge and his wife Kate Virginia (Ferguson) Inge (1864-1941) had nine children. They raised them in living quarters attached to the store and required them to pitch in and help run the business. Often, African American visitors to Charlottesville found lodging at the Inges' home. The children often spoke about their father's friend and former Hampton classmate, Booker T. Washington, who stayed with the family whenever the educator and speaker came through Charlottesville. He was one of the Inges' most famous guests.\n\nThe Inge children all had successful careers. Three of his daughters were teachers. His sons' occupations included: an educator and high school principal in Texas, a biology department head at Hampton Institute, a New Jersey State Senator, a realtor, and two physicians. Thomas Ferguson Inge, Sr. (1903-1993) ran the store until 1979 along with his son, Thomas Ferguson Inge, Jr. ​\n\nNannie Cox Jackson\n\nFor decades, Nannie Cox Jackson (1865-1953) was an inspiring domestic science (home economics) teacher at Jefferson School. She taught her students--boys and girls--how to cook, sew, crochet, and knit so they could live respectably and independently.\n\n​\n\nHow proud Mrs. Jackson's students must have been to be able to design and sew their own dresses like the eighth-grade graduation dress Viola Green Porter (1898-1985) is seen wearing in the photograph to the right.\n\nMrs. Jackson had a big and generous heart. She ensured that every child at Jefferson School had a hot meal for lunch. She even helped establish the first hot lunch program within the city's public schools. During segregation, Mrs. Jackson was a huge supporter of Jefferson School's football team. She helped them acquire uniforms and provided them with transportation to and from practice and away games using a truck owned by her family's business. After home games, she fed both teams, their coaches and doctors a hearty meal that began with soup. A favorite menu item on the dinner plate was Mrs. Jackson's homemade meatballs.\n\nWilliam E. \"Billpost\" Jackson, Jr.\n\n​​Besides being known as an educator, Mrs. Jackson was known throughout Charlottesville as a landlord who took care of her property, and who rented at rates African American families just starting out could afford. According to some, at her death, her estate was worth a million dollars! Of course, that was mainly due to the value of her properties.\n\nMrs. Jackson's son William E. Jackson, Jr. (1888-1972), otherwise known as \"Billpost\" Jackson, along with his son Edward R. Jackson ran a family business--Jackson Poster Advertising. It was a home-based operation installing billboards all over the area, and it provided the family with a decent living. It was skillful work, placing paste on the back of huge lithograph printouts then putting them together like a puzzle on a board. But they did it, and well, too!\n\nPhoto Credits\n\n1. \"George Carr.\"Photo: Rufus W. Holsinger, 1914.

He was a 1911 Howard University medical school graduate who practiced at his home office at 123 4th St. NW in Charlotteville for 30 years. He married Peachie Suporah Carr (1889-1977), an Albemarle native, in 1914.\n\n​According to a participant at Family Photo Day held at the University of Virginia on March 9, 2019, the man in the photo below is that of Dr. Johnson. However, when I showed the image to Charlottesville native and longtime Jefferson School educator, Mrs. Teresa Walker Jackson Price, whose mind is as sharp as ever at 97 years, she said with certainty that it was not Dr. Johnson.\n\nI also shared the photo with Peachie Carr's grandniece and her grandnephew's wife. Neither ladies recognized the man in the photo as Dr. Johnson. So I'm pretty sure the photo below has been misidentified, but wanted to include it here anyway. Above however, is the photo the Carr-Geer family shared with me, in which they identified Dr. Johnson as sitting next to his wife, Peachie.\n\nPhoto likely misidentified as George Franklin Johnson, M.D.\n\nPeachie Carr Johnson (later Jackson) was a teacher in Orange County for two years then at Jefferson School in Charlottesville for decades. She graduated from Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute (now Virginia State College) with a teaching degree in 1912. In 1933, she obtained a bachelors of science degree from the same university. Later, Peachie did graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Dr. George F. Johnson in company with Mrs. Mary Greer motored to Virginia State College at Petersburg, to witness the Commencement exercises. Mrs. Peachie C. Johnson was a member of the graduating class.\" *\n\nBesides being a teacher, Peachie Carr Johnson was a civic minded individual who was quite involved in various literary and social clubs as well as benevolent societies organized by Charlottesville's African American women. From 1954-58, she was the president of the Virginia Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. I'm sure you'll find the primary research that's been done by the Ivy Creek Foundation about Peachie's family, the Carr and Greer Families, quite fascinating. I certainly did! (Find it HERE.)\n\nAccording to Peachie's obituary, Dr. Johnson died suddenly in 1945. ​\n\nHoward University Dentistry Class, circa 1900\n\nSeen below is Dr. John Andrew Jackson (1888-1956). According to the 1934 Hill's Directory he was living at 125 4th Street NW, next door to Dr. Johnson, and practicing dentistry at 406 Commerce Street NW, right across from Jefferson School. Dr. Jackson received his D.D.S. degree from Howard University in 1913.\n\nDr. Jackson's wife's name was Otelia Love (1889-1966). Otelia was actively involved in civic organizations serving the African American community of Charlottesville. The Jacksons had seven children--five sons and two daughters. Two of their sons Ellard \"Punjab\" Jackson and George Franklin Jackson became dentists like their father. The entire Jackson family was quite involved in volunteering with the National Association of Colored Dentists, now the National Dental Association, a professional organization founded in the 1900s by Dr. David Arthur Ferguson of Richmond, Virginia.\n\nJohn Andrew Jackson, D.D.S.\n\nIn addition to their city property, the Jacksons owned 82 acres of farmland that was just outside the city. Dr. Jackson's father, Andrew W. Jackson, once had a working farm there. The land was located within a bustling, rural African American community called Hydraulic Mills-Union Ridge. During the summer months, Dr. Jackson, who was scoutmaster of Charlottesville's African American Troop No. 15, allowed his land in the country to be used by the local African American Boy Scouts who camped, gardened, competed, and swam there.\n\n​\"Week before last, our city was host to the Old Dominion Dental Society. What an asset this convention was, to our city. If nothing else were enumerated, the inspiration allotted to our young people is really worthy of note. Without any attempt at exaggeration I have heard about ten young men and women express their desire to become dentists. Dr. J. A. Jackson and Dr. B.. A. Coles deserve great credit for their unselfishness in planning the public meeting. . .\" **\n\nDr. Bernard A. Coles (1894-1971) a dentist, and Dr. Edgar A. Long, Jr., a physician, took care of the needs of their patients in an office located inside Vinegar Hill at 271½ West Main Street. Most likely, Dr. Long also visited infirm and ill patients in their homes. According to the 1934 Hill's Directory, Dr. Coles lived at 313 8th St. NW in Charlottesville with his wife Ruth, and Dr. Long, Jr. lived at 321 6th St. SW with his wife Marie. (The directory also lists another couple as living at the same home--Lloyd and Mary Tonsler.)\n\n​\n\nDr. Coles along with Dr. Jackson awarded graduating seniors of Jefferson School who had maintained the highest average in English with a five dollar gold piece, and awarded a five dollar prize for the best essay written by a student in any class!\n\n​Dr. Edward W. Stratton Jr. was listed in the directory as practicing at his home at 206 6th Street NW. His wife's name was Marguerite. As a volunteer in the 1930s, he served as the physician for Jefferson School's football team. On the left is an image of him cropped from a photo that was taken with the undefeated Jefferson School football team in 1935.\n\nJust who was Dr. Edward W. Stratton, Jr.? More research needs to be done. But I wonder if he was the Edward W. Stratton who was the son of a Samuel Stratton, an African American clerk who built his family's home in Columbia, South Carolina in 1887. I also wonder if he was the young man with the same name who was listed in Howard University's 1933 Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity roster.\n\nI was truly delighted to discover from Mrs. Teresa Walker Jackson Price that I was correct in assuming that Dr. Edward W. Stratton, Jr. of Vinegar Hill was the same Dr. Edward W. Stratton, Jr. who was a prominent obstetrician in Los Angeles during the 1950s and 60s. And when I showed her a picture I found of that Dr. Stratton (HERE), she quickly said, yes, it's him! And she should know. Dr. Stratton was her \"godfather\" who saw his patients in a basement office located in her family's basement, and who ate supper with her family every night!\n\nI really enjoyed finding out more about the physicians and dentists whose names were marked with a \"C\" in Hill's 1934 Directory (indicating their color). Learning even just a little about them, their wives, and families filled me with something akin to familial pride. And I felt it not just for them, but for all those back then who were professionals serving their communities--though they were born just a generation away from the Dark Days of Slavery.\n\nAs Charlottesville newspaper man T. J. Sellers, said: \"They deported themselves with a decorum, born of culture and dignity.\"\n\nIt was my privilege to shine a small light on them by naming the doctor in Mama's Chicken & Dumplings Dr. Stratton.\n\n​Photo Credits\n\n1.

It's of ​the faculty of Jefferson School in Charlottesville, Virginia, during the era of segregation, taken as best I could figure during the 1926-7 school year. To me, the image is absolutely beautiful for many reasons. For one, I love the dignity, confidence, and determination these women project on camera. And it's no illusion! They were dignified, confident, and determined on many levels, despite the harsh racial conditions of the times. I found it easy to imagine the African American men of the local area tipping their hats in courtesy as these ladies walked by. My imaginings made me want to write a scene in my middle-grade Mama's Chicken & Dumplings where a gentleman of Vinegar Hill tips his hat out of respect for Allie's best friend, Jewel, while she walks by pretending to be as sophisticated as the ladies in the above image, despite Jewel being only ten years old.\n\nIsabella Gibbons\n\nThe history of Jefferson School in Charlottesville stretches back to right after the Civil War ended and all those with African descent were freed from the institution of slavery. Anna Gardner, an educator with European decent from Nantucket, an island in Massachusetts, arrived in Charlottesville around 1867. She opened a New England Aid Society's Normal School, which prepared men and women for the task of teaching the newly freed citizens of the area. Later, the school became a Freedmen’s School under the direction of the Freedmen's Bureau. Anna named her group of students the Jefferson School.\n\nOne of the first teachers of color at Jefferson School was Isabella Gibbons who had once been enslaved at the University of Virginia. Despite the law of the times, Gibbons had learned to read and write beautifully, and had taught her daughter Bella to do the same. Isabella's husband William Gibbons could also read and write. He became a well-respected Baptist minister after Freedom came.\n\nJefferson School became a public school of the City of Charlottesville in 1871. Benjamin E. Tonsler was one of the school's earliest principals. He was a beloved member of the community. Many graduates from Jefferson School attended historically Black colleges and universities like Hampton University, and obtained degrees in all types of disciplines, including those in medicine, engineering, and science, even though they had to complete their high school studies outside of Charlottesville since Jefferson School graduated students after the eighth grade.\n\nRebecca Fuller McGinness\n\nThe name I chose for Allie's fifth grade teacher was Mrs. McGinness. I chose it out of respect for Rebecca Fuller McGinness, a tireless educator who spent decades teaching at Jefferson School. If you examine the oral histories of those who attended Jefferson School as students, the name Mrs. McGinness often comes up. They mention her as a teacher who inspired them to achieve their personal best. Mrs. McGinness was a graduate of Jefferson School before there was a high school. She finished her studies at Hampton Agricultural and Industrial School, now Hampton University, graduating from there with her teaching certification in 1915, and later a bachelor's degree. When she was 100, Hampton gave her an honorary doctorate degree. Mrs. McGinness lived to the ripe age of 107.\n\nWhile I named Allie's principal Mr. Duncan, the real Mr. Duncan--Owen Duncan-- was the principal of Jefferson High School in the 1940s. In 1935, the year Mama's Chicken & Dumplings takes place, Cora B. Duke was the principal of the \"Old\" Jefferson School--the one that housed grades one through five. Mrs. Duke was known as a woman who put the students' needs ahead of her own. When she retired, the school community threw her a grand celebration thanking her for her educational leadership and community involvement. Doesn't she look grand in her feathered hat in the photo taken in 1915 at the Holsinger Portrait Studio located in Charlottesville? Indeed!\n\nAfter the building to house Jefferson's junior and high school grades opened on the same campus as the older building in 1927, extracurricular activities for the African-American youth of Charlottesville began to thrive. There was a debate team, science club, marching band, literary clubs, a choir, a dramatic club, and more. For years, Jefferson School's after-school groups were well-known throughout the state as being top performing. They competed against other African American schools located throughout Virginia. Below is the undefeated \"Red Devils\" football team of 1935.\n\nI really enjoyed imagining Allie playing the flute in the Jefferson School band, vying for first chair.\n\nFrom left to right, (front row) Charles L. Jackson, Lloyd Quarterman, Billy \"Goat\" Lewis, John Locket, William \"Shortie\" Brown, Carter \"Red\" Wicks, Earl \"Cap\" Fortune, Alfred Bynum, Bernard Dabney; (second row) DuBois Johnson, Raleigh Kelly, William Cox Jackson, Charles \"Chink\" Lee, Grover Henderson, Carl Johnson, Phillip Sellers, Carol Allen; (third row) Nannie Henderson, Thomas Martin, Edward McCreavy, Beverly \"Pep\" Thomas; and (standing) Team Physician Edward W. Stratton and Coach James \"Wop\" Edgar.\n\nThe African American community of Charlottesville supported Jefferson School's extra curricular activities by hosting fundraisers, purchasing transportation, and by donating their time and resources. Nannie Cox Jackson was a huge supporter of the football team.\n\nThe education and edification of the young ones growing up in the neighborhood was obviously important to the adults living in the once thriving African American community of Charlottesville during the unfair days of Jim Crow. It was my privilege to share that spirit of togetherness while writing Mama's Chicken & Dumplings.\n\n​Photo Credits\n\n1. Jefferson School yearbook photo.

When this picture was taken, the members included: ​(left to right) Earl Sampson (tenor sax), George Jones (guitar), T. J. Sellers (drums), Theodore “Duke” Chisholm (piano), Kermit Jones (alto sax), George Bowles (trumpet), Percy Sampson (trombone), and Clarence Bryant (bass).\n\nPhoto courtesy the family of Elmer \"Sonny\" Sampson, found in Charlottesville: The African-American Community by Agnes Cross-White (Dover, NH: Arcadia Publishing, 1998).\n\nWhile on her West Main Street quest in Charlottesville to find her mama a husband who loves to sing, 10-year-old Allie, the main character in MAMA'S CHICKEN & DUMPLINGS my forthcoming novel for young readers that takes place in 1935 Vinegar Hill, asks Mr. Journey, a fictional character who owns a sewing machine shop. . .\n\n\"I’m wondering, Mr. Journey,” I say. “I mean, it’s obvious you know a thing or two about fixing things . . . but can you sing?”\n\nMr. Journey stops dusting and looks at Jewel and me like we’re a math equation he’s trying to figure. “Every now and again, I sing with Sampson’s Happy Pals.”\n\nIt was pretty cool to find mention of the band in The Reflector, \"Charlottesville's Only Negro Weekly,\" which was published by T. J. Sellers from 1933-1936. For example, there was this lighthearted inclusion in the \"Around Town\" society news column with C.S. Kelly in the number 3 issue that came out on August 26, 1933:\n\n\"Rumor has it that Jerry Bowles is practising with 'Sampson's Happy Pals'. What's that? Did I hear some one say that he likes suspense? Here's a bit. We are not telling you where Mr. Bowles bought the instrument, or what kind it is or how much it cost, but we will say that we expect him to make his debut soon. If you do not wish to miss this treat, you had better follow 'Sampson's Happy Pals' around the town.\"\n\nOrange County News, Volume 11, Number 47, 16 March 1933.\n\nA more sobering mention was found on the front page of the June 9, 1934, issue of The Reflector. It said:\n\n\"Readers of this issue of 'The Reflector' will notice an announcement concerning the John Stratton Benefit Dance, to be held next Thursday, June 14th.\n\nThis entertainment, to be staged at the Odd Fellows Hall, will represent an effort, on the part of Sampson's Happy Pals, to assist a former member of their orchestra in the securing of medical attention that has been advised for him.\n\nStratton, as Charlottesville knows, was the little man \"behind the drums\" in Sampson's Happy Pals. Several months ago, he became ill and has been confined to his bed ever since. In these economically topsy-turvy times, when even well men find the going tough, it is not difficult to understand why it is a worthwhile movement on the part of the orchestra to provide their former orchestra member with financial assistance.\n\nThe intentions of the band are commendable, but unless the public catches the spirit and supports this movement, these intentions will amount to very little in a material way. Negro citizens of Charlottesville should keep this fact in mind and make arrangements to help make his movement a successful one because such a splendid display of brotherhood on the part of these ten musicians should be encouraged.\"\n\nDespite his band mates' efforts to get him needed care, Mr. Stratton sadly passed away on August 27, 1934, at just 28 years of age.\n\nPhoto courtesy Chris Farina and Rosalia Films.

Sonny played for a short while with his older brother Percy in Sampson's Happy Pals. Sonny was an accomplished trombone player who played with well-known musicians like Lena Horne. Sonny was one of the first two African Americans invited to join Charlottesville's Municipal Band in 1968 after Jim Crow laws lifted.\n\n​\n\nI sure wish I could find a recording of Sampson's Happy Pals!\n\n​Bibliography:\n\nCross-White, Agnes.

Thanks for inviting me!\n\nMy pleasure! I'm wondering, did you love illustrating and making comics as a kid?\n\nI did! Though I was painfully shy, art was the one thing I always felt confident in. I’ve been drawing as long as I could remember, and I had a fondness for writing as well. I spent most of my day at school in the library, reading everything that I found interesting. The most memorable finds were intricately illustrated picture books by Robert Munsch, Jan Brett, Beatrix Potter and others. As a child, I would read and write little picture books for myself.\n\n​When I grew older, I sent out a printed book to my relatives as gifts that I assembled with my home scanner, a stapler, and PowerPoint. I wrote comics as well, sometimes in collaboration with my brother who would draw the panels. Comics were harder to come by, but to this day I read my hand-me-down Archie comics and manga as much as possible.\n\nI'm sure your family enjoyed those gifts more than store bought ones! What types of books for children would you like to create as an author/illustrator or comic book author?\n\nThough my art aligned with kidlit very well, I thought that children’s books could only be written by people with rosy childhoods. My children’s books professor in art school changed my perspective. More often than not, children are smart enough to know about the sad, scary, and unfair aspects of the world. I would love to create work that acknowledges these tough subjects with kindness and help kids understand them as my favourite childhood books have done for me.\n\nThose types of topics are needed in this sad, scary, and unfair world. Is there anything in particular that inspires your art?\n\nNot to be cliché, but nature is my greatest inspiration. At the onset of the Pandemic lockdown, I reevaluated my unhealthy relationship to art and took a long break. I would go on multiple walks a day with my dad who I moved back in with briefly. Being from Vancouver, British Columbia, there was no shortage of natural beauty to draw from. But aside from mountains and oceans, I found joy in the curious sights of everyday life, like the flowers that survived through an unusually warm winter, or an owl perching snugly on a stop sign.\n\nI forced myself only to create with the old paint and coloured pencils in my childhood home. I fell back in love with making art. Most of my work features nature, especially flowers. My family was in the flower business for years and I grew up surrounded by blooms, and I worked as a florist for them occasionally. It’s great to be able to draw so many different kinds of flowers from memory!\n\n(C) Illustration: Sarah Wang\n\nI love flowers, too! Please describe your process.\n\nMy process really depends on the project, but recently, I really like to get as much worked out in the early stages as possible. It’s a rather structured process, which I’ve developed from a hectic schedule during school days and working full time. I start with research of course, making a board of reference photos. The Notion app has been my recent obsession for keeping track of information and files.\n\nIn my first book, which I am currently working on, I kept a sketchbook full of all the research and sketches pertaining to the story. Then, I did a close read of the manuscript and sketched out scenes and pages. I made a template for thumbnails with the right ratio and rough text placement and filled this in using Photoshop since they get revised over and over. Working digitally saves time.\n\nI took each thumbnail, enlarged it to make a tighter sketch, and chose a colour palette for the page. (I stole this step from my partner who is a fantastic artist. He finishes an entire painting digitally first, and then paints it on canvas.) This type of precise groundwork gives the final artwork a clean, purposeful look instead of being overworked or having to restart many times. Next, I printed out the sketch, transferred it to watercolour paper for the final mixed media painting, which I like to do completely traditionally as I love the warm look and soothing process.\n\nWow! Sounds like a labor intensive process, but one that pays off in the end! Last question, how did Kelly discover you and why are you glad to be represented by her?\n\nKelly and I actually found each other after a good friend had joined The Tobias Literary Agency as a client. He kept telling me how his agent was great to work with, so I asked him for more info. Though my friend's agent wasn’t taking on any new clients, she referred me to Kelly, her colleague at TLA.\n\nKelly had a great list of artists and seemed very experienced, so I reached out, and she promptly responded. She led me through the agenting process and the contract step by step. I became intrigued by the idea of being in a community of other children’s book artists. Luckily, soon after we signed, our first project that went out on submission was acquired! It’s only been a little while since we’ve worked together, but I’m excited to see where Kelly and I will go.\n\nKelly is awesome, and I'm excited to see where your work will go too!

What a delight to have you here!\n\nThank you for inviting me.\n\nThe pleasure is all mine! Do tell. How did you find your way into the kidlit world, and why do you love it?\n\nOh, there are so many pathways that all led here! But, the simplest (shortest) one is that I encountered M.T. Anderson’s YA Novel FEED, and it opened my eyes to the opportunities there are in kidlit to be weird and genre-less and playful, even if darkly so. I love that it gives us (the authors) that freedom to write for readers that don’t have formed expectations of what literature should or shouldn’t look like yet. We get to show them how expansive that definition could be.\n\nFEED also helped me see that kidlit can focus on asking questions rather than giving answers. Because you are engaging with readers who are encountering concepts and themes, often for the first time, they are open to questioning the ideas behind them, and perhaps come up with their own thoughts and opinions in response. I like to think I’m creating those types of books—the kind that asks the reader questions, and asks the reader to ask questions—but even if not, I’m glad I get to try.\n\n​Very intriguing reply! It's so cool that you enjoy writing books for young readers that include dashes of science, plus technology, along with a helping of whimsy. Why is that combination a good fit for you as a writer?\n\nAh, well, thanks for thinking it’s cool! I have a science and tech background, and I’m a programmer for my day job, so tech stuff is rather constantly on my mind. But science and tech can get a bit serious (*cough*, AI), and I think when you get too serious in storytelling, you can lose people; they will check out before they understand. Perhaps that assumption is wrong, but to me, it seems as if when stories get too serious, the audience starts to become more restricted to the people who already agree or understand. I don’t know. Maybe I just like making things a little playfully weird!\n\nCan you give us an example, please, of something whimsical you're working on?\n\n​An example: I’m currently revising a YA novel about government-led psychiatric experimentation, which has some borderline silly and unrealistic locations and settings. And often my illustrations have cute animals doing silly things with industrial or technological props. Actually, I’ve been wondering lately whether “whimsical” is the right word for this kind of story; if instead I should be saying “absurdity.” But there’s overlap there, right? Both are breaks from logic or reality, a sense of being off kilter, though with slightly different overtones.\n\nIt sounds like your books will be wonderfully weird, absurdly abstract, and fantastical fictional yarns that young adults will love to read!\n\nHaha! Thanks, I think.\n\n(c) Amanda Vacharat, amandavacharat.com\n\nSo how would you say your characters speak to the younger you?\n\nOn the simplest level, I’m writing books which feature characters who have one Asian parent, and characters who are autistic, whether or not they are labeled as such. There weren’t characters like this in books or movies growing up, and we’ve come a long way with representation, but we aren’t there yet. Having books with these characters would have helped validate my own ways of thinking and existing, and I hope seeing characters like this will resonate with others still missing themselves in current media.\n\nOn a more complex level, many of my characters are a little hopelessly in love with the world. They also tend to want to restore relationships and find their place with friends or family. I’ve been told that desire is quintessentially middle grade (and not YA), but I disagree, partially because of my own experience as a teen, and even adult. And so I’ve stubbornly kept on with it.\n\nThose are themes that resonate with folks of all ages, I think. As an illustrator, what are your favorite subjects to draw, and why.\n\nOh dear, illustrating. Even though at the very start of this journey, I wanted to be an illustrator, I’ve gotten totally derailed by writing (see answer number 1.) I’m just now getting back into illustrating, and at the very beginning of defining what types of subjects I want to focus on. What’s remained consistent for me is I love drawing almost any types of animals. I’ve always loved animals. Almost all creatures. Except stink bugs.\n\nI'm with you on the stink bugs! Anything else you like to draw?\n\nI once had an art director question why so many of my illustrations feature children who are afraid. So, I guess I like drawing terrified kids? I’m not sure what this says about me.\n\nHaha! Not sure about that one. Last questions: What medium do you enjoy using in your art? And what's your process like?\n\nMy go-to medium used to be pencil with scanned wallpaper and photographs, which I would paint over digitally. That process was extremely time consuming, so lately I’ve been playing around with what I can manage digitally to recreate the same sort of look.\n\nWell, Amanda. This has proved to be a most interesting interview, and I foresee some very unique illustrated young-adult novels on the horizon--those inside a genre created by you!\n\nPerhaps so!\n\nThanks so much for stopping by. Pop in anytime!\n\nWill do!\n\nAmanda Vacharat holds an MFA in Writing for Children from the Vermont College of Fine Arts (VCFA).
