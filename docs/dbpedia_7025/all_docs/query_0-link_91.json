        "text": "September is Classic 70s Movie month. Today’s guest post comes from Ryan Gilmore.\n\nMovie Title: The Godfather: Part II\n\nYear: 1974\n\nWriter(s): Mario Puzo & Francis Ford Coppola (Screenplay)\n\nMain Actors: Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nIMDb Plot Summary: The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba.\n\nWhy I Think This Is A Classic 70’s Movie: The Godfather II, like it’s predecessor, is classic for all the same reasons; the stellar directing, the superb writing, spot-on performances and incredible art/set direction and editing. But what separates this sequel further into a classic is it was the first sequel ever to be nominated AND WIN the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nIn addition, what makes The Godfather II such a timeless classic is the way that it uses flashbacks as the prequel in telling the story of Vito Andolini Corleone and his struggles while on his rise to power, then flashing back to “real time” to show Michael Corleone’s own struggles with his current reign of power.\n\nThis style of filmmaking was pulled off brilliantly by Francis Ford Coppola and his Editing team of Barry Malkin, Richard Marks and Peter Zinner.\n\nLastly, the performances make this an all-time classic. This sequel was the introduction of Robert DeNiro into the Godfather franchise and along with the primary actors in this film, it is nearly impossible to think of any other actors that could have portrayed Mario Puzzo’s characters with such grace, depth, intensity and believability.\n\nMy Favorite Moment In The Movie: Similar to my experience with the first Godfather film, where I chose three favorite moments, I found picking just one favorite moment an absolute impossibility. At a 3 hour and 20 minute run time of flawless filmmaking and acting, how can I truly be expected to choose just one?!\n\nMy initial reaction is to choose when, after having shockingly realizing that Fredo was in some way responsible for the attempted assassination of Michael, Michael kisses Fredo with a frightening intensity saying; “I know it was you Fredo…you broke my heart”. Absolutely a classic scene by anyone’s account.\n\nBut, upon the viewings for this exercise, I found two specific scenes to be incredibly moving and poignant.\n\nThe first, is when Michael sits down with his Mother, still very much the Matriarch of the Corleone family, and by the glow of the fireplace burning nearby solicits her advice in a beautiful scene spoken completely in Italian. I see in this brief moment, that of what little remains of Michael’s innocence and longing for the days before he began his ascent to power.\n\nThe next very poignant scene for me was a very simple one, in which no dialogue was spoken. While at Mama Corleone’s funeral, after speaking with his sister Connie, Michael walks into a crowded living room, and hugs Fredo. Standing just steps away is Al Neri, the man responsible for most of the Corleone criminal dirty work; he and Michael share a silent moment, and with only a LOOK, he orders his only living brother, Fredo, to be executed by Al.\n\nFavorite Dialogue In The Film: My favorite moment of dialogue is the exchange between Michael and Connie, just moments before he walks into the room to hug Fredo. This is the last possible chance he will have to change his mind, with his only Sister pleading for him to speak with his last living brother. But even she, can’t get through to him. In fact, this is the moment that she finally succumbs to Michael’s power. (Also shown in the previous link.)\n\nCONNIE: Michael, Fredo’s in the house with Mama. He asked to see you and Tom said you wouldn’t see him.\n\nFLASHBACK to Michael speaking to Fredo.\n\nMICHAEL: You’re nothing to me now. You’re not a brother. You’re not a friend. I don’t want to know you or what you do. I don’t want to see you at the hotels. I don’t want you near my house. When you see our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won’t be there.\n\nBACK to Michael and Connie.\n\nMICHAEL (coldly): That’s right.\n\nCONNIE: You were just being strong for all of us. The way Papa was. And I forgive you. Can’t you forgive Fredo? He’s so sweet, and helpless without you.\n\nConnie realizes she’s not getting through to Michael.\n\nCONNIE: You need me Michael. I want to take care of you now.\n\nMichael reaches out and touches Connie gently.\n\nMICHAEL: Connie…\n\nConnie leans down and kisses Michael’s hand, in acknowledgement of his power as Don Corleone.\n\nKey Things to Look For When Watching: Again, like the first installment, the impeccable technical aspects. Directing, cinematography, editing, writing, and performances, etc.\n\nThe seamless way in which the film uses the flashbacks and back to real time to essentially tell two very important stories in the Corleone family saga, first, how it came to be and where it is and is headed.\n\nThanks, Ryan! To show our gratitude for your guest post, here’s a dash of creative juju for you. Whoosh!\n\nWe already have a set of 80s Movies and 90s Movies. This month, we’re working on 70s Movies."
