        "text": "\"It is even better than the first film, and has the greatest single final scene in Hollywood history, a real coup de cinéma.\"\n\n- Peter Bradshaw, THE GUARDIAN\n\n\"The daring of Part II is that it enlarges the scope and deepens the meaning of the first film. Visually, Part II is far more completely beautiful than the fist, just as it's thematically richer, more shadowed, fuller.\"\n\n- Pauline Kael, THE NEW YORKER\n\n\"This magnificent 1974 sequel, the centerpiece of Coppola and writer Mario Puzo's 20th Century gangster saga, is still one of the most ambitious and brilliantly executed American films, a landmark work from one of Hollywood's top cinema eras.\"\n\n- Michael Wilmington, CHICAGO TRIBUNE\n\n\"The Godfather PART II is the most ambitious American movie in terms of size and scope in recent memory. It goes much deeper than “The Godfather” in analyzing the twisted mentalities of these men who pervert the capitalist system for their own gain. The film is richer in texture and gives more evidence of social awareness.\"\n\n- Kathleen Carroll, NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"
