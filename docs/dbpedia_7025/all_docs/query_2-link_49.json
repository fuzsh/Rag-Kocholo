        "text": "Godfather Part 2 Explained\n\nGodfather 2 Plot Explained\n\nBefore we dive into The Godfather Part II ending, let’s quickly review the road leading up to it. Here’s the plot of Godfather 2 explained.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola’s epic tells the parallel story of Vito Corelone (Robert De Niro) and his son Michael (Al Pacino). The film alternates between the modern timeline of 1958/1959 – where Michael is the boss of the Corleone crime family — and the timeline of the past — where Vito is an up-and-comer in a New York neighborhood.\n\nImportant characters to know for The Godfather Part II ending:\n\nMichael Corleone\n\nNever hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.\n\n— Michael Corleone\n\nFormer college dropout who joined the armed forces after Pearl Harbor; honorably discharged at the behest of his father Vito. Michael was a ruthless crime boss who desperately wanted to make his business legitimate.\n\nMichael was never supposed to be involved in the family business, but in The Godfather, he was drawn into the underworld — and eventually inherited the title of Don (after the death of his older brother Sonny).\n\nVito Corleone\n\nI'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\n\n— Vito Corleone\n\nAn Italian immigrant who found social and financial success in America. Vito worked to procure a better life for himself and eventually became boss of the Corleone crime family.\n\nIn The Godfather, Vito struggles to find an heir apparent after the death of his eldest son, Santino (Sonny).\n\nSantino Corleone (Sonny)\n\nI Want Somebody Good - And I Mean Very Good - To Plant That Gun.\n\n— Santino Corleone\n\nSonny, known for his energy and impulsivity, was Vito’s underboss. Sonny was killed during the war of the five families.\n\nFrederico Corleone (Fredo)\n\nEvery time I put my line in the water I said a Hail Mary, and every time I said a Hail Mary I caught a fish.\n\n— Fredo Corleone\n\nFredo was the middle son of Vito Corleone, junior to Sonny, senior to Michael. Fredo was passed over for the role of boss because of his ineptitude, which led to a longstanding grudge with Michael.\n\nFredo betrayed Michael by revealing his location to an enemy at the beginning of The Godfather Part II. The scene where Michael reveals “he knows” Fredo betrayed him remains one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. Check it out below.\n\n“I Know It Was You, Fredo” Scene • The Godfather 2 ending explained\n\nBy giving Fredo the “kiss of death,” Michael all but seals Fredo’s fate as a marked man; which is especially tragic considering Fredo was once Michael’s biggest supporter.\n\nThe Godfather 2 Ending Explained\n\nThe Godfather, Part II ending script\n\nThere are a lot of differences between The Godfather Part II ending in the script and the movie ending. We imported The Godfather Part II script into StudioBinder’s screenwriting software to take a look at some of those differences, as well as some key story beats.\n\nClick the script image below to read the ending in its entirety.\n\nThe final pages • The Godfather 2 ending explained\n\nDifferences between The Godfather Part II script and movie:\n\nMichael meets with Vito to discuss enlisting in the armed forces.\n\nMichael tells Vito, “I won’t be a man like you.”\n\nMichael walks with his son Anthony around the estate discussing “things we cannot hear.”\n\nIf you’ve seen The Godfather Part II before, then you know Vito doesn’t appear in the flashback. That’s because Marlon Brando refused to show up to set on the day of shooting because of a contract dispute with Paramount.\n\nLosing Brando was a production nightmare – in fact, some filmmakers might have just scrapped the scene. But Coppola trudged on and somehow made a scene that worked better than anybody could have imagined.\n\nThe Godfather 2 Ending Explained\n\nThe Godfather 2 Ending Explained\n\nThe Godfather Part II ending begins with a flashback to Christmas dinner, presumably after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. The flashback is significant for a few reasons; it recontextualizes Michael’s relationship with Fredo, it comments on the theme of duty to family vs. duty to country, and it communicates Michael’s loneliness and despair.\n\nLet’s break down how The Godfather Part II ending accomplishes those three things.\n\nThe Godfather Part II ending recontextualizes Michael’s relationship with Fredo. When Michael announces he’s going to enlist in the armed forces, he’s met with ire and confrontation.\n\nThe last scene • The Godfather 2 ending explained\n\nOnly one person defends him: Fredo. This interaction demonstrates just how important Fredo was to Michael, which tragically juxtaposes his murder in the prior scene.\n\n1. The Godfather Part II ending comments on the theme of duty to family vs. duty to country. The theme of duty to family vs. duty to country pervades every part of The Godfather trilogy.\n\nPatriotic Michael • The Godfather 2 ending explained\n\nShould a man be loyal to his family? His fellow citizens? His heritage?Is it possible for a man to be loyal to all three?\n\nBy enlisting in the armed forces, Michael chooses his country over his family – and wages war on his heritage (Italy).\n\n2. The Godfather Part II ending communicates Michael’s loneliness and despair. The wide shot of Michael shows him all alone at the dinner table.\n\nMichael all alone in the ending of Godfather 2\n\nIt’s with this shot that we realize the depth of Michael’s despair. He’s been alone for a long time, longer than most realize. By framing the shot in this way, Coppola emphasizes Michael’s solitude.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the scene worked better than anybody could have imagined? That’s because Vito’s absence supports Michael’s loneliness. It may not have been intentional – but it ended up working perfectly.\n\nThe following shots push the negative emotive further by bringing us closer to Michael’s somberness.\n\nFirst through the flashback transition dissolve:\n\nPlot of Godfather 2 explained\n\nEnding of Godfather 2"
