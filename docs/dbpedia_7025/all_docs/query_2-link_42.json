        "text": "Let’s continue looking at the history of The Godfather with the 30 things you never noticed in its’ sequel, The Godfather Part II:\n\n30. Robert De Niro spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian language in order to play Vito Corleone. Nearly all of the dialogue that his character speaks in the film was in Sicilian.\n\n29. Though it claims to be based on the novel by Mario Puzo, only the scenes about the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) have any basis in the book. Only one chapter in the book is devoted to Vito’s youth and young adulthood. The story revolving around Michael (Al Pacino) and family in Las Vegas is entirely unique to the film.\n\n28. When little Vito arrives at Ellis Island, he is marked with a circled X. Ellis Island immigrants were marked with this if the inspector believed the person had a mental defect.\n\n27. The door to Vito Corleone’s olive-oil business was rigged so that it would not open if a nail was inserted into the lock. Coppola kept this a secret from Leopoldo Trieste, who played Signor Roberto, and his difficulty in opening the door was real. Coppola wanted to film Trieste, a known Italian comedian, improvising his way through the scene. When Genco Abbandando opens the door, Frank Sivero surreptitiously pulls the nail out.\n\n26. In the scene in which young Vito negotiates with Signor Roberto on the street, a passerby interrupts to say hello to Vito. Carmelo Russo was an extra who was supposed to just walk by, but he improvised speaking to Vito. Francis Ford Coppola did not like that Russo interrupted the scene. But Robert De Niro liked that it showed how much people in the neighborhood respected Vito and he convinced Coppola to keep Russo’s line.\n\n25. Hyman Roth’s character is loosely based on real-life mobster Meyer Lansky. Lansky, who at the time of the film’s release was living in Miami, reportedly phoned Lee Strasberg and said, “Now, why couldn’t you have made me more sympathetic? After all, I am a grandfather.”\n\n24. There was much debate over whether Robert De Niro should grow a mustache for the scenes where young Vito is a few years older, but De Niro couldn’t decide. In the end, De Niro tossed a coin. For the scenes where Vito returns to Sicily, he even gained weight and wore a smaller version of the dental appliance Marlon Brando wore in the first film.\n\n23. Danny Aiello’s line, “Michael Corleone says hello”, was completely ad-libbed. Francis Ford Coppola loved it and asked him to do it again in the retakes. Aiello later claimed (on Gilbert Gottfried’s podcast) that, due to being nervous about working with Coppola, he didn’t hear himself when he said the line and, to this day, has no idea why he said it.\n\n22. Lee Strasberg became ill during shooting, but instead of delaying production, Roth’s character was re-written to be an ailing old man.\n\n21. James Caan asked that he be paid the same amount of money to play Santino ‘Sonny’ Corleone at the end of the film in the flashback as he was paid to do The Godfather (1972). He got his wish.\n\n20. Originally, it was supposed to be Clemenza who agrees to testify against the Corleones. According to Francis Ford Coppola, Richard S. Castellano (who was the highest paid actor in The Godfather (1972)) wanted to write his own lines and wanted a large salary increase. Consequently, his character was replaced by Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), who received an Oscar nomination for the performance. But according to Ardell Sheridan, Castellano refused to regain the fifty pounds required to for the role due to health reasons, so Coppola decided to replace him rather than have a thinner Clemenza.\n\n19. Francis Ford Coppola considered bringing Marlon Brando back to play Vito Corleone as a young man, convinced that he could play at any age. As he worked on the script, though, he remembered Robert De Niro’s exceptional audition for The Godfather (1972) and cast him without offering the part to Brando.\n\n18. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay even though half of the script was adapted and half was original. The story of Michael Corleone is original, while the story of the young Vito Corleone came from The Godfather novel, but was not used in the first film. WAG rules decree that any screenplay for a sequel is a “screenplay adapted from another source”.\n\n17. Though never explicitly stated in the film, Anita Colombo (the old woman evicted from her apartment that a young Vito helps out) is the grandmother of Sandra Corleone, Sonny’s wife.\n\n16. In an interview, Gordon Willis admitted that he sometimes “went too far” in his use of dark photography. He particularly noted the scene in which Michael asks Mama for advice as an example. As a result, when the 2008 “Coppola Restoration” was being performed, the restoration experts had to turn to Willis to find out how he intended the scenes to be shown.\n\n15. Unlike with the first film, Francis Ford Coppola was given nearly complete control over production. In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film.\n\n14. In an early version of the script, an ongoing story line was Tom Hagen having an affair with Sonny Corleone’s widow. This was later discarded, but the line where Michael Corleone tells Hagen that he can take his “wife, children and mistress to Las Vegas” was kept.\n\n13. Robert De Niro is one of only seven actors (with Sophia Loren, Christoph Waltz, Roberto Benigni, Benicio Del Toro, Penelope Cruz, and Marion Cotillard) to win an Academy Award for a role primarily in a language other than English, since almost all of his dialogue in this film is in the Sicilian language.\n\n12. According to Francis Ford Coppola in the DVD commentary, Michael V. Gazzo gave such a great performance as Frankie Pentangeli in the rehearsal of his testimony scene that Coppola wanted to start filming it immediately, but everyone had to break for lunch. During the break, Gazzo got drunk and was unable to perform as well as he had in rehearsal.\n\n11. A test screening of the film garnered negative reactions from the audience. They found cutting back and forth between Michael and young Vito confusing and bothersome. Francis Ford Coppola and his editors decided to decrease the frequency of the transitions in order to make the parallel stories easier to follow.\n\n10. Talia Shire was only paid $1,500 for playing Connie in The Godfather (1972). For this movie, she received $30,000, with a $10,000 bonus when the box-office receipts hit $27.5 million.\n\n9. The film takes place in 1901, 1917, 1920, 1923, 1941, 1958, 1959 and 1960.\n\n8. One of Francis Ford Coppola’s conditions on returning to direct was that Robert Evans have no involvement whatsoever with the film, as they had frequently clashed while making the first film.\n\n7. Robert De Niro auditioned for and was almost cast in The Godfather (1972) in a minor role. When Francis Ford Coppola was casting this film, he saw Mean Streets (1973) and knew he wanted De Niro for a major role in this sequel.\n\n6. The ship shown transporting the young Vito Corleone to New York City was NOT the Moshulu. That ship is now a restaurant docked at Penn’s Landing in Philadelphia. The Moshulu is leaving New York bay while young Vito Corleone’s ship, name unknown, is arriving. One can tell the direction of each ship’s travel by its orientation to The Statue Of Liberty.\n\n5. Originally, the actors in the flashback scenes wore pants with zippers. One of the musicians pointed out that the zipper had not been invented at that time, so some scenes had to be re-shot with button-fly trousers.\n\n4. Marlon Brando was scheduled to return for a cameo in the flashback at the end of the film but, because of the way Paramount Pictures treated him during The Godfather (1972), he did not show up for shooting on the day the scene was filmed. Francis Ford Coppola re-wrote the scene without Vito, and it was filmed the next day.\n\n3. Francis Ford Coppola, having nearly been fired several times from the first film, was given a Mercedes-Benz limousine from Paramount Pictures as a reward for the record success of The Godfather (1972) and an incentive to direct a sequel. He agreed on several conditions, that the sequel be interconnected with the first film with the intention of later showing them together; that he be allowed to direct his own script of The Conversation (1974); that he be allowed to direct a production for the San Francisco Opera; and that he be allowed to write the screenplay for The Great Gatsby (1974), all prior to production of the sequel for a Christmas 1974 release.\n\n2. Francis Ford Coppola had a horrible time directing The Godfather (1972) and asked to pick a different director for the sequel, while taking the title of producer for himself. He chose Martin Scorsese, who the film executives rejected. Thus, Coppola agreed to direct the film, with a few conditions.\n\nand the #1 thing you never noticed about Godfather Part II is…\n\nProduction nearly ended before it began, when Al Pacino’s lawyers told Francis Ford Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script, and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night re-writing it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved and the production went forward."
