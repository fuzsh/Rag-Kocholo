        "text": "1974\n\nCity Locations\n\nNew York City, NY; Los Angeles, CA (USA); Sicily (Italy); Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic)\n\nLocation Types\n\nHouse, Mansion, Museum\n\nLocation Styles\n\nFederal Building, Luxury, Dated/50's-60's-70's, Building Dated/Retro\n\nAbout The Godfather Part II\n\nWelcome to the cinematic masterpiece that reshaped how sequels are seenâThe Godfather Part II. Released in 1974, this big production was skillfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, supported by a star-studded cast including Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Robert De Niro, and many more.\n\nThis iconic film functions as both a sequel and a prequel to The Godfather. As a sequel, it continues the narrative of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the successor and son of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who fights against all odds to protect the family business after his life comes under threat. The prequel dimension takes you back through time, recounting the life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) from his early years in Sicily through his journey to New York City, culminating in the creation of his widely feared family enterprise.\n\nThe Godfather Part II's excellence was recognized at numerous award ceremonies. The film was nominated for an astonishing eleven Academy Awards and walked away with six of the most prestigious, including Best Picture and Best Director for Francis Ford Coppola. Robert De Niro's compelling portrayal of young Vito Corleone didn't go unnoticed either, earning him the award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe film was also lauded for its exceptional screenplay, penned by Coppola and Mario Puzo, as well as for its distinctive art direction and set decoration, earning Dean Tavoularis, Angelo P. Graham, and George R. Nelson Academy Awards in these categories.\n\nThe success of The Godfather Part II gave birth to The Godfather Saga, a chronological integration of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II for television, demonstrating the enduring appeal of this mafia epic.\n\nThe Godfather Part II Locations\n\nThe Godfather Part II was primarily filmed across diverse landscapes stretching from New York, California, and Nevada to Florida, Italy, and the Dominican Republic. As you set foot on these film locations, you can feel the unmistakable essence of the Corleone family saga. In the heart of New York, visit the East Village, which was transformed into the 1917 Little Italy neighborhood for the movie. The bar scene, where the Rosato brothers try to garotte Pentangeli, was shot at the 7B Horseshoe Bar, an iconic location that has also been featured in other movies like Crocodile Dundee, Angel Heart, and Five Corners.\n\nVenture to the sunny state of Florida and explore North Miami, where the Florida home of Hyman Roth was located. In contrast, the scenes of 'Cuba' were shot in the island nation of the Dominican Republic, with the capital, Santo Domingo, serving as 1950s 'Havana.' The grandeur of Occidental El Embajador, featured in the film as Roth's hotel, adds to the city's historic charm.\n\nMoving onto European territories, Italy is not to be missed. The picturesque landscapes of Sicily and the northeastern island of Taormina bring to life Vito Andolini's village 'Corleone.' Additionally, the restored Ellis Island Museum is depicted as New York's 'Ellis Island' in the film, a point of arrival for European immigrants, where Vito Andolini becomes Vito Corleone.\n\nLastly, follow the Corleone family's history to California, where their lakeside mansion resides at Fleur du Lac, along the western shore of Lake Tahoe. Today, the former Corleone estate functions as a boathouse within a private enclave, enhancing the sense of seclusion and exclusivity linked with the Corleone lineage.\n\nA trip to these locations is not just a chance to relive the 1974 classic but an opportunity to explore the world through the lens of The Godfather Part II, where every location holds a story, a mystery, and a piece of cinematic history.\n\nThe heart-wrenching scene unfolds when Vito's mother (Maria Carta) pleads with Ciccio (Giuseppe Sillato) for her son's life. However, Ciccio remains unmoved, fearing that the young Vito (Oreste Baldini) will seek vengeance in adulthood. In an act of desperate courage, Vito's mother takes Ciccio hostage at knifepoint, enabling her son to escape, but sadly, she is killed by Ciccio's men.\n\nThis pivotal scene was filmed at 95024 Acireale, located in the metropolitan city of Catania, Italy. The locale sets the perfect backdrop, embodying the scene's raw emotion and high stakes. This area, steeped in history and culture, enhances the narrative's authenticity, creating a cinematic experience that stays with viewers long after the movie ends.\n\nThe villa where this scene was shot is now privately owned. However, part of it has been converted into a museum, offering fans and tourists a glimpse into the film's making. It holds a unique treasure: a room showcasing Francis Ford Coppola's cameras, a testament to the director's visionary filmmaking.\n\nTo visit this iconic film location, you can book a visit or wait by the gate for a chance to enter. Usually, a tourist bus arrives in the morning and afternoon. You can then inquire if it's possible to tour the property. From Catania, it will take approximately 45 minutes to reach your destination via SS 114 Orientale Sicula. Alternatively, you can opt for a bus or train ride from Catania.\n\nVito (Robert De Niro) arrives in New York City by ship. At Ellis Island, an immigration agent assigns him the surname \"Corleone\" based on his hometown, and thus, he is registered as \"Vito Corleone.\"\n\nThis poignant scene, capturing the immigrant experience, was filmed not in Italy but at New Yorkâs 'Ellis Island.' This location served as the entry point for European immigrants during the first half of the 20th century. Over time, the buildings fell into disrepair but have since been restored. Today, they house the Ellis Island Immigration Museum.\n\nThe museum is situated in the Main Building of the former immigration station complex. It chronicles the stories of the 12 million immigrants who embarked on a new chapter of their lives in America via Ellis Island.\n\nIf you're interested in visiting this significant historical site, it's accessible via ferry from Battery Park in New York City or Liberty State Park in Jersey City. Once there, you can explore the grounds, take a guided tour of the museum, and perhaps even trace the steps of Vito Corleone himself.\n\nThe adult Vito Corleone works in a grocery store on the Lower East Side alongside his friend Genco Abbandando (Frank Sivero). Fans of the film will undoubtedly recall the memorable scene where the young Don Corleone meanders through the bustling streets, an iconic image that encapsulates the essence of his character and the narrative.\n\nThis scene was filmed at 328 E 6th St, New York, in the vibrant Bowery area. While the exact location of the grocery store isn't specified, the street scenes are easily recognizable, capturing the hustle and bustle of early 20th-century New York City.\n\nNew York City, a sprawling metropolis comprising five boroughs where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean, is renowned for its iconic landmarks, including the towering Empire State Building and the expansive Central Park. The Broadway theater, housed in the neon-lit Times Square, adds charm to the city.\n\nIf you plan to visit, there's no shortage of adventures. From savoring delicious local cuisine to sightseeing in diverse neighborhoods and iconic sights, you're in for a treat. The NYC subway system is the preferred and swiftest mode of transportation for navigating the city. Its practicality is underscored by its round-the-clock operations, freeing you from concerns about traffic.\n\nMichael (Al Pacino) meets Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) in Miami. Roth reveals his suspicion that Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) was behind the assassination attempt and assures Michael that Pentangeli will face consequences.\n\nThe meeting takes place at Hyman Roth's Florida home, located at 2045 North Hibiscus Drive, off Biscayne Boulevard in the Keystone Islands of North Miami. It's a private residence not currently for sale, so it's not open for public visits. Over the years, the house has changed and no longer looks exactly as it did in the movie. However, the surrounding neighborhood retains much of its original charm.\n\nInitially recognized as \"Arch Creek,\" North Miami underwent several transformations. It first became the \"Town of Miami Shores\" in 1931, and it was renamed the \"Town of North Miami.\" It eventually gained city status in 1953. Today, it forms an integral part of the Miami metropolitan area in South Florida.\n\nTo visit the nearby areas that appear similar to the film's location, you can reach North Miami through various transportation modes available in South Florida. Once in Miami, you can drive via Biscayne Boulevard to reach the Keystone Islands. Although you may not be able to visit the exact house, being in the vicinity allows you to soak in the atmosphere and visualize the iconic scene from The Godfather Part II.\n\nAt the New Year's Eve party hosted by Batista, as the clock strikes midnight, marking the beginning of a new year, Michael Corleone confronts his brother Fredo (John Cazale) about his betrayal. In a moment filled with raw emotion, Michael firmly clasps Fredo's head and delivers a kiss, voicing the now-famous words: \"I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart.\"\n\nThe setting for this scene was the Grand National Palace of the Dominican Republic. This pivotal scene captures the tension and tragedy of familial betrayal set against the backdrop of a lavish celebration, accentuating the stark contrast between public joy and private sorrow.\n\nThe National Palace in Santo Domingo, a remarkable architectural feat crafted by Italian architect Guido D'Alessandro, serves as the official workplace for the Dominican Republic's president and vice president. It's a symbol of historical significance and majestic grandeur. The palace's Hall of the Caryatids, adorned with 44 statues of robed women, mirrors, and sparkling chandeliers, enhances the scene's opulence and overall cinematic appeal.\n\nVisitors should schedule a guided tour to explore this iconic film location, as the palace is not regularly accessible to the public. From the heart of Santo Domingo, transportation options include taxis or private vehicles via Expreso 27 de Febrero and Av. Pedro HenrÃ­quez UreÃ±a, or taking the C1C2 bus."
