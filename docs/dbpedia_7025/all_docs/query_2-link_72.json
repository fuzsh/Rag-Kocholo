        "text": "We’re gonna make you an offer you can’t refuse….\n\nAbove all else, we here at the Rio Theatre are movie lovers. And there’s nothing we love more than seeing some of the all-time classics of cinema on the big screen, just as nature intended. With that in mind, we felt there as no better way to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of one of our forever favourites, Francis Ford Coppola‘s THE GODFATHER, by double-billing it with its equally, if not arguably superior sequel, THE GODFATHER II.\n\nEven better? As part of the 50th Anniversary of THE GODFATHER, these titles have been stunningly restored and remastered in 4K. (Also: It goes without saying that among our many cherished regulars, aka, our “Rio Famiglia,” this particular franchise gets brought up. A lot.)\n\nReleased in 1974, THE GODFATHER Part II is one of the very few films to be considered superior to its predecessor, and was the first sequels to ever win a Best picture Oscar (in addition to winning trophies for Director for Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for Robert De Niro, and another Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo). This compelling sequel to the 1972 film contrasts the life of Corleone father and son, tracing the problems of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in 1958, and that of a young immigrant Vito Corleone (De Niro) in 1917’s Hell’s Kitchen. As the saga continues forward, we see Michael surviving many misfortunes, and learn how young Vito was introduced to a life of crime. Featuring fantastic performances from a stellar ensemble, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire and more.\n\nSunday, April 17 Encore Screening\n\nDoors 7:00 pm | Movie 7:30 pm *Start time subject to change.
