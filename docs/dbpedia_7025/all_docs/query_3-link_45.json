        "text": "Considered by some to be an even richer and more spellbinding work than its predecessor, Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather Part II contrasts the lives of the father and son of the Corleone family, tracing Michael Corleone’s (Al Pacino) rise to prominence as a mafia kingpin in 1950s and the young Vito Corleone’s (Robert De Niro) early life as an immigrant in 1917’s New York City.\n\nPartially based on Mario Puzo’s 1969 novel, The Godfather Part II is both a sequel and a prequel to The Godfather, presenting two epic crime dramas in parallel. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and the first sequel to win Best Picture, The Godfather Part II is a suspenseful story of betrayal, revenge, power and deception."
