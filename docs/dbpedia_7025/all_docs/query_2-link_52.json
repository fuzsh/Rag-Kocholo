        "text": "\"One of the greatest sequels ever.\"\n\n— Kate Muir, Times (UK)\n\n\"It’s an epic vision of the corruption of America.\"\n\n— Pauline Kael, New Yorker\n\n\"The storytelling is leisurely and masterful; Coppola at the very peak of his powers.\"\n\n— Wendy Ide, Times (UK)\n\n\"A grand historical epic studying the nature of power in the United States' heritage.\"\n\n— John H. Dorr, Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"A masterful sequel, replete with action, showmanship, humor and technical craftsmanship.\"\n\n— Phil Strassberg, Arizona Republic\n\n\"Director Francis Ford Coppola has fashioned a film of awesome power and overpowering performances.\"\n\n— Elston Brooks, Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com\n\n\"It delves deeper into the Corleone mythology, past the romanticism, to deliver an epic and intelligent tragedy.\"\n\n— Radheyan Simonpillai, AskMen.com\n\n\"One of the most ambitious and brilliantly executed American films, a landmark work from one of Hollywood's top cinema eras.\"\n\n— Michael Wilmington, Chicago Tribune\n\n\"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Part II is an even richer, more spellbinding work than its wholly successful predecessor.\"\n\n— Susan Stark, Detroit Free Press\n\n\"This is quite simply one of the saddest movies ever made, a tale of loss, grief and absolute loneliness, an unflinching stare into the darkest moral abyss.\"\n\n— Tom Huddleston, Time Out\n\n\"Director Francis Ford Coppola furnished a fully-fashioned gangster melodrama in the first film: in this one he stretches his talent to encompass a genuine American tragedy.\"\n\n— Alexander Walker, London Evening Standard\n\n\"Few movie sequels are as good as the films they follow and even fewer have about them the air of necessity. Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather Part II is among the rare exceptions.\"\n\n— Philip French, Times (UK)\n\n\"The new sequel to The Godfather, titled The Godfather, Part II, permits us a second look inside that room, inside that world. At times the vision is as beautiful, as harrowing, and as exciting as the original.\"\n\n— Gene Siskel, Chicago Tribune\n\n\"The Godfather Part II is quite fascinating in its study of a migrant community and especially of power within that community. A mixture of horror, piety and wit, it is compulsive viewing (even if you feel like closing your eyes in some scenes).\"\n\n— Helen Frizell, Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\"Somehow this beautifully made, intermittently exciting film never pulls us once and for all into its own world. But its ambition, vision and artistic courage make it more marvelous than anything we might have expected from that ill-fated form, the sequel.\"\n\n— Paul D. Zimmerman, Newsweek"
