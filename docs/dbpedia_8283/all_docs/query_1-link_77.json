In addition to its comprehensive line of quality tire brands, the team at Dobbs offers drivers complete automotive services, including routine, preventive, and complex diagnostic and engine repairs.\n\nThe family’s commitment to service excellence is the hallmark of the company culture, which is evident daily at the store level as associates assist customers with properly maintaining and repairing their vehicles, including cars, light trucks, vans, SUVs, hybrids, and EVs.\n\nBeyond their commitment to satisfying the needs of their customers, the Dobbs family of associates actively supports many institutions, organizations, and charities in the local communities in which they and their families reside.\n\nAs Dustin Dobbs, fourth generation company chief executive officer explains, “At Dobbs, each of our associates has a stake in the success of our company, and the welfare of the communities in which we live and work. Together, we do our best to make a positive difference for our customers by providing them with high quality tire brands and expert automotive services provided right, the first time, at the most competitive prices in town.
