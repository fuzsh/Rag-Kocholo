Braniff’s super pilot advance training was credited with the carrier’s first place status. The new system initially allowed pilots to descend as low as 300 feet ceiling minimum but later in the year Braniff was again first to be obtain authorization to descend down to 200 feet with ½ mile visibility. Braniff’s Director of Flight Operations Mr. R. V. Carleton was the guiding force behind Braniff’s early certification, which was acknowledged by the Civil Aviation Agency\n\nBraniff offers the first Tourist Liner flights aboard Douglas DC-4 four-engine airliners between the US Mainland and Latin America.
