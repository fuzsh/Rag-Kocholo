        "text": "The most important thing to do is to respond to the letter. There are several possible responses to the letter depending on your specific circumstance:\n\nA. Indicate the tax was paid or provide information on why it is not owed.\n\nIf tax was paid or there are circumstances that you believe result in no tax due, mark the appropriate box on the letter and include a letter of explanation; or\n\nB. Complete the return and remit payment.\n\nIf you did not pay tax on the aircraft at the time of purchase, complete a consumerâs use tax return (Form 5741) and remit the amount due. The due date was April 15th in the year following the calendar year in which the aircraft was purchased. Calculate the interest and penalty and include it with your payment; or\n\nC. Complete the return and ask for a payment plan.\n\nProvide information in the response regarding a suggested monthly payment. Most payment plans are established for 12 months or less but the Department may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis. The Department will process your return and contact you to finalize payment arrangements; or\n\nD. Complete the return and ask that penalty be waived.\n\nComplete the return, remit the tax and interest, but ask the Department to waive the penalty. Include a brief explanation of why you believe the penalty should be waived. In many cases, the Department will grant a waiver of penalty; or\n\nE. Complete the return and submit an offer-in-compromise.\n\nIf there is a basis for paying less than the amount due, complete the use tax return and submit an offer-in-compromise, Form MO-656, to request to pay less than the full tax, interest and penalty owed. The form requires that you specify whether you are requesting a compromise based on doubt as to collectability, doubt as to liability, or effective tax administration. The necessary forms and additional information are available here ; or\n\nF. Pay the amount due, including interest and penalty, under protest."
