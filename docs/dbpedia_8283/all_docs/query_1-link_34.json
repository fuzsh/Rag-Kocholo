        "text": "(1) The admission in defendant's original answer, \"that the plaintiff was employed by defendant as alleged in his petition,\" was sufficient to dispense with the necessity, otherwise, of offering any other proof of the contract. Drug Co. v. Bybee, 179 Mo. 366; Walser v. Wear, 141 Mo. 463; Cross v. Railroad, 141 Mo. 144; Spurlock v. Railroad, 125 Mo. 407; Schad v. Sharp, 95 Mo. 576; Price v. Clevenger, 99 Mo.App. 540; Mahan v. Brinnell, 94 Mo.App. 171; Bushnell v. Ins. Co., 91 Mo.App. 528. Defendant's amended answer in no wise lessened the effect of defendant's admission in its original answer, and amounted to nothing more or less than a general denial. Meyer v. Broadwell, 83 Mo. 574. (2) The original contract was verbal and a part only was reduced to writing. Parol evidence was, therefore, admissible to show any distinct collateral agreement, independent of, and not varying, the written agreement. Parol evidence is also admissible where the writing itself is subsequently varied by a parol agreement. Roe v. Bank, 167 Mo. 427; State v. Cunningham, 154 Mo. 172; Greening v. Steele, 122 Mo. 294; Lumber Co. v. Warner, 93 Mo. 384; Brown v. Bowen, 90 Mo. 189; Ellis v. Bray, 79 Mo. 238; O'Neil v. Crain, 67 Mo. 251; Life Assn. v. Cravens, 60 Mo. 390; Van Studdiford v. Hazlett, 56 Mo. 324; Letcher v. Letcher, 50 Mo. 138. (a) Plaintiff's petition does not charge that the contract of employment was in writing, and in view of defendant's insistence that unauthorized alterations by plaintiff in his duplicate of the written portion of the contract entirely vitiated such duplicate and in fact the whole of the written evidence of any portion of the contract, then on such theory of the case the entire agreement must be deemed to be thrown into parol. Boyd v. Camp, 31 Mo. 165. (b) Inasmuch as certain omissions in the written portion of the agreement were conceded to exist by defendant before plaintiff began his employment and the supplying of these omissions was demanded by plaintiff and acceded to by defendant before plaintiff began his employment, parol evidence of what the employment actually was in its entirety was admissible. Warren v. Mfg. Co., 161 Mo. 121; State v. Cunningham, 154 Mo. 172. (3) Defendant's unaltered duplicate of the written portion of the agreement was admissible in evidence, even though the referee was justified in excluding, upon defendant's objection, plaintiff's altered duplicate. Jones v. Hoard, 59 Ark. 46; Young v. Cohen, 42 S.C. 328. Defendant is bound, however, by its voluntary introduction of its unaltered duplicate in evidence in its cross-examination of plaintiff. Dice v. Hamilton, 178 Mo. 90. Defendant is also bound by the testimony elicited by it with reference to the alterations made in plaintiff's duplicate, whereby what are erroneously termed \"modifications\" of the written portion of the agreement were shown to be merely intended to supply conceded omissions therein. Sutter v. Raeder, 149 Mo. 309; Railroad v. Plate, 92 Mo. 635. (4) If, under the cases below cited, the petition in this case may be held to be a petition on quantum meruit, then all objections of defendant to the recovery herein are of no avail. Warder v. Seitz, 157 Mo. 149; Glover v. Henderson, 120 Mo. 376. (5) The judgment is for the right party, on whatever theory or from whatever viewpoint the case may be looked at, and it will not, therefore, be disturbed. Redman v. Adams, 165 Mo. 70."
