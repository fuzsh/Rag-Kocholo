        "text": "St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL), located in St. Louis, Missouri, is surrounded by a variety of facilities, attractions, and amenities. Here are some notable places and features near the airport:\n\nHotels: There are numerous hotels in close proximity to the airport, catering to travelers with early flights or layovers. These range from budget options to more upscale accommodations.\n\nMetroLink: The airport is served by the MetroLink light rail system, which provides convenient access to downtown St. Louis and other parts of the metropolitan area.

The area offers a mix of cultural, historical, and recreational activities suitable for travelers and residents alike.\n\nAs of my last update in 2023, St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL) is considered a medium-sized airport in terms of passenger traffic. It serves as a significant transportation hub for the St. Louis metropolitan area and the wider region. While it is not among the busiest airports in the United States, it handles a considerable amount of traffic, offering both domestic and limited international flights.\n\nThe airport has experienced fluctuations in passenger numbers over the years, influenced by factors such as airline hub relocations, the economic climate, and changes in air travel demand. For many years, it served as a primary hub for Trans World Airlines (TWA) and later for American Airlines, but its role as a hub decreased significantly after American Airlines downsized its operations in the mid-2000s.\n\nDespite these changes, STL has continued to serve a wide range of passengers and maintains a robust schedule of flights operated by various airlines. The airport has been working on improving and expanding its facilities and services to enhance passenger experience and accommodate future growth.\n\nFor the most current information on passenger traffic, flight operations, and ongoing developments at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, it would be best to consult the airport's official website or recent traffic reports from relevant aviation authorities."
