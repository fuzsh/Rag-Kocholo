        "text": "Former American manufacturer of rail passenger cars, streetcars and trolleybuses\n\nThe St. Louis Car Company was a major United States manufacturer of railroad passenger cars, streetcars, interurbans, trolleybuses and locomotives that existed from 1887 to 1974, based in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe St. Louis Car Company was formed in April 1887 to manufacture and sell streetcars and other kinds of rolling stock of street and steam railways supporting the traction industry. In succeeding years the company built automobiles, including the American Mors, the Skelton, and the Standard Six. The St. Louis Aircraft Corporation division of the company partnered with the Huttig Sash and Door company in 1917 to produce aircraft. During the two world wars, the company manufactured gliders, trainers, alligators, flying boats, and dirigible gondolas. Among their most successful products were the Birney Safety Car and the PCC streetcar, a design that was very popular at the time.[1]\n\nThe firm went on to build some of the vehicles used in the transit systems of New York City and Chicago, as well as the FM OP800 railcars manufactured exclusively for the Southern Railway in 1939.\n\nThe St. Louis Car Company was headed by Edwin B. Meissner Sr., who died at age 71 on Sept. 12, 1956. Meissner was president of the company, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of railroad and light rail cars, and the St. Louis Aircraft Corporation. He was active for many years on the Jewish Federation Board of Directors, and served for over 20 years as President of Congregation Shaare Emeth.\n\nThe St. Louis Car Co., later known as General Steel Industries, manufactured St. Louis streetcars and trolleys and cars for far-flung transit systems such as the Paris Metro in France. Meissner's son, Edwin B. Meissner Jr., succeeded his father as head of the company, and continues to be an active member of Congregation Shaare Emeth.[2]\n\nStreetcars held sway in St. Louis and its suburbs from the 1880s until the mid- and late 1940s. Andrew Young records that new state-of-the-art buses began to encroach on the streetcars domain. New streamlined streetcars were brought into service in 1946 to replace older cars, some dating back to 1903.\n\nIn 1960, St. Louis Car Company was acquired by General Steel Industries.[3] In 1964, St. Louis Car completed an order of 430 World's Fair picture-window cars (R36 WF) for the New York City Subway and was building 162 PA-1s (110 single units, 52 trailers)[4] for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for their use on the Port Authority Trans-Hudson line to New Jersey.[5] Also in the mid-1960s, the company completed building the passenger capsules, designed by Planet Corporation, to ferry visitors to the top of the Gateway Arch at the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in St. Louis, Missouri.[6]\n\nSt. Louis Car continued business until 1968 and ceased operations in 1974.[7] The final St. Louis Car products were R44 subway cars for the New York City Subway and Staten Island Rapid Transit, and the USDOT State of the Art Car rapid transit demonstrator set whose design was based on the R44.\n\nThe St. Louis Car assembly plant and general office at 8000 Hall Street, St. Louis is now the St. Louis Business Center, a mixed use industrial and commercial complex redeveloped starting in 2005.[8]\n\nSelected Products\n\n[edit]\n\nPCC streetcars (1935-1952)\n\nPeter Witt streetcars\n\nTrolley buses\n\nInterurban cars\n\nGas-electric railcars\n\nCRT/CTA 5003-5004 PCC elevated-subway cars (1947) - retired 1985\n\nCTA 6000-series PCC elevated-subway cars (1950–59) - retired 1992\n\nCTA 1-50 PCC elevated-subway cars (1959–60) - retired 1999\n\nChicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad Electroliner (1941)\n\nElectro-Motive Company (EMD) gas-electric railcars - car body shells (1920s)\n\nFairbanks-Morse experimental center cab diesel switchers and FM OP800 railcars (1939)\n\nGCRTA Red Line \"Bluebirds\" (1954–55, 1958)\n\nMBTA #3 East Boston Tunnel cars (1951)\n\nState of the Art Car heavy rail transit demonstrator set for USDOT (1972–74) - now at Seashore Trolley Museum\n\nIllinois Terminal Railroad Streamliners (1948–50)\n\nIRT World's Fair Steinway Motors (1938) - built for 1939 World's Fair\n\nMetra Illinois Central Electric District Highliner electric MU cars (1971–72)\n\nNJ Transit/NJDOT/Penn Central Arrow I (PRR MP85E6) electric MU cars - push-pull coach conversion (1968)\n\nNew York Central ACMU 4500 series (1950–51)\n\nNYCT R8A (1939)\n\nNYCT R17 (1954–55)\n\nNYCT R21 (1956–57)\n\nNYCT R22 (1957–58)\n\nNYCT R27 (1960–61)\n\nNYCT R29 (1962)\n\nNYCT R30 (1961–62)\n\nNYCT R33 (1962–63)\n\nNYCT R33S (1963)\n\nNYCT R36 (1963–64)\n\nNYCT R38 (1966–67)\n\nNYCT R40 (1967–68)\n\nNYCT R40A (1968–69)\n\nNYCT R42 (1969–70)\n\nNYCT R44 (1971–73)\n\nChicago and North Western Transportation Company Gallery 7600 series coaches #1-16 (1955)\n\nPacific Electric \"Hollywood\" cars (1920s)\n\nPhiladelphia and Western Railroad original wood cars and freight motors (1907)\n\nHudson & Manhattan Railroad/PATH \"K-car\"/MP51 (1958)\n\nPATH PA1 (1965) & PA2 (1967)\n\nSan Diego Class 1 Streetcars (1910-1912)\n\nSeaboard Air Line 2027-2028 Railcars (1936)\n\nSEPTA Silverliner III (PRR MP85) cars (1967)\n\nStaten Island Railway R44 (1973) (last St. Louis cars)\n\nU.S. Army (USAX) cars - various types including coaches, ambulance, cafeteria, sleepers\n\nUnion Pacific lightweight passenger cars, express and baggage cars (1960–65)\n\nVictorian Railways Petrol Electric railmotor (1928)\n\nA St. Louis Car-built trolley bus in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in 1967\n\nOne of the few surviving Lisbon's São Luís type cars (series 400–474): of the original batch of 75 units, imported in 1901 and retired up to 1973, most were scrapped, three remain operational in Lisbon (a museum car restored to original condition and two modified for tourist duty since 1965, fitted with luxury upholstering — No.2, former No.435, on the photo), and five saw heritage use in Detroit in 1978–2003.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nMiddleton, William Jr. The Interurban Era.
