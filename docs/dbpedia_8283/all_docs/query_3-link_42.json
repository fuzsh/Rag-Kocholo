        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the Spirit of St. Louis Air Show & STEM Expo™, presented by Boeing?\n\nThe Spirit of St. Louis Air Show and STEM Expo™, presented by Boeing is a two-day, inspirational family-focused event at the Spirit of St. Louis Airport, designed to support current regional efforts that promote Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as well as aviation education and career opportunities.\n\nThe Spirit of St. Louis Air Show & STEM Expo™ is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation governed by volunteers. It is necessary to charge admission in order to offset the costs associated with producing the event, including support services for all personnel and aircraft that participate in the event. Donations received by Spirit of St. Louis Air Show & STEM Expo™ are used to produce the event. It is also noteworthy that the production on Air Show days is implemented by approximately 1,000 volunteers who contribute their time and energy to ensure the success of the Air Show.\n\nTICKETS\n\nWhere can we purchase tickets?\n\nTickets are available ONLINE ONLY, at www.spirit-airshow.com Re-entry is permitted until 3pm. Keep your ticket stub if you print off a copy and get your hand stamped as you exit. Please check website for updates. Children 12 and under are free. Please consider ordering a “free” children’s ticket online to expedite entry into the Air Show grounds.\n\nMay I exchange my ticket for a different day or for a different kind of ticket?\n\nNO – Flight line and Club Bravo Tickets CANNOT be exchanged for a different day or different ticket.\n\nNO – A General Admission Ticket CANNOT be exchanged for a Flight Line or Club Bravo Ticket.\n\nAre there military discounts?\n\nYes. General admission is free to active duty military individuals with ID.\n\nThe Air Show strongly supports our veterans and donates tickets to local veteran organizations for use at their discretion.\n\nThe Air Show does not offer discounts to non-active military or active-duty family members. We encourage you to take advantage of initial discounts on tickets.\n\nThe event provides no-cost display space to area military recruiting commands so they may have a presence at the event and articulate the opportunities available in today’s armed forces.\n\nWhat happens if there is inclement weather?\n\nThe Air Show HAPPENS rain or shine. It takes more than a few raindrops to stop the Air Show. It is highly unlikely that it would be cancelled due to rain. Performers have high, low and flat routines to fit different weather conditions. Also, schedules will be shifted and/or delayed for periods to avoid heavy rainfall. In addition, display aircraft, exhibits and food locations typically remain open regardless of weather conditions. Follow us on social media for real-time updates during Air Show days.\n\nWe work very closely with the National Weather Service to monitor weather. In the event of inclement weather at any point during the event, the announcer will direct guests how to safely exit as there are no shelters in place on the Air Show grounds. Unless the weather is severe, we will fly as much of the show as is safe and possible. If both days of show are canceled, your ticket price may be considered a tax-deductible contribution to an IRS 501(c)(3) organization. Due to FAA permit restrictions and performer commitments, it is not possible to reschedule the airshow for another weekend. Please be aware that tickets are non-refundable or exchangeable and are not valid on another day. Customers should make their purchases with this in mind. Any change to that policy would be made at the discretion of the Spirit of St. Louis Air Show & STEM Expo™ Governance Committee.\n\nI don't have a printer. How can I show my tickets?\n\nYou can show your tickets on your mobile device. Each ticket can only be scanned once. You can also order your tickets online and forward the purchase confirmation email to anyone with a computer and working printer, and they will be able to print your tickets.\n\nI have Print-at-Home tickets that I bought in my name for someone else. Will this be a problem?\n\nThe name on a Print-at-Home ticket will not impact entry into an event. If the ticket is in someone else’s name, you will not have any issues at the door when redeeming it. Tickets will only scan one time for entry.\n\nI ordered tickets but did not receive a confirmation email. What do I do?\n\nConfirmation emails are sent immediately upon completion of the transaction. If you have spam blocking or require senders to seek approval, you may not receive it. Please check the spam or junk mail folders before contacting Attendstar. The confirmation email will be sent from tickets@attendstar.com. Attendstar can be reached at 636.534.1440.\n\nHow do I reprint my Print-at-Home ticket?\n\nYou will find a \"Print all your tickets \" link in the order confirmation email sent to you when you completed your transaction. Open that link, you can print ticket(s). Can't find the order confirmation email? Click Here to locate your order and resend your confirmation email.\n\nWhat kind of printer, paper and ink should I use to print my tickets?\n\nAny inkjet or laser printer using 8.5\" x 11\" paper will be fine. Tickets can be printed in color or black and white.\n\nWhy was on your site yesterday and was told there were no tickets available, yet today there are tickets available?\n\nThe Spirit of St. Louis Air Show & STEM Expo™ determines how many, if any, tickets will be held, sold or released for public sale, and when they are available. Presales or special offer sales may have limited availability prior to general sales availability. If a day or type of ticket is listed as \"Sold Out\" or \"Unavailable,\" you may want to check the site periodically to see if additional tickets have been released or other ticket holders have cancelled. Limited tickets are available at pre-sale prices. Tickets are continually released and changing until the event weekend.\n\nAs our parking is on mostly grass, we will adjust ticket availability based on ground conditions. This may cause a sudden increase or decrease in ticket availability.\n\nI purchased a ticket earlier, but now I see there are better tickets open. What happened to \"Best Available?\"\n\nWhen a customer begins the purchase process, their tickets are pulled out of the available inventory until they purchase them. If someone has held tickets before you began your transaction, but later decides not to buy them, they are released back for sale. This is a common occurrence, especially during the first on-sale days of a popular event. Other ticket holders may cancel which puts tickets back into available inventory.\n\nThe website says that tickets are \"Sold Out.\" What does that mean?\n\nWhen tickets are sold out in a specific category, there are no tickets remaining for the event in that category. If every category says “sold out” there are no tickets available.\n\nThe event just went on sale, why are there no tickets available?\n\nJust like you, thousands of other customers may be trying to purchase tickets. During a very popular on-sale, it is possible to receive a message that says tickets are currently unavailable. If a customer begins the purchase process and decides not to continue, their tickets are released back for sale. Limited tickets are available during pre-sales and tickets are continually released and changing in price as the event weekend approaches.\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nHow do we get to the show?\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nAbove is the 2022 traffic map for reference.
