        "text": "St. Louis Aircraft Corporation was an American aircraft manufacturer founded in September 1917.[1]\n\nIn 1915, the St. Louis Car Company had been approached by Thomas W. Benoist to build 1000 flying boats. A prototype was built, but the concept did not go into production.[2]\n\nIn 1917 The United States government needed to form a production interest for World War I aircraft production needs. The St. Louis Aircraft Corporation was founded by A.J. Seigel of the Huttig Sash and Door company, and Edwin B Meissner of the St. Louis Car Company.[3] Their two companies had skilled labor and facilities needed to construct wood-framed aircraft. The company became one of six across the country to produce the Curtiss JN-4D Jenny with first deliveries in 1918. The first order (720552) was for 200 aircraft,[4] the company delivered 30 aircraft a month, and 57 JN-4D's in October 1918.[5][6]\n\nThe company went dormant until 1928 when it started production of the Cardinal and later the Cardinal Senior.[7] The company ordered 100 100 hp Kinner K-T radial engines to power the light monoplane, but production ceased in 1931 in the peak of the depression.[8]\n\nThe company continued to build parts while aircraft production was not viable. It specialized in supplying components for the Engineering section at Wright Field.[9] In the buildup to World War II, the company developed its own biplane trainer the St. Louis PT-35, which lost to the Boeing Stearman. It also produced a low winged trainer to compete in an Army contract, the St. Louis PT-LM-4. It lost out to the Fairchild PT-19 model.\n\nThe company was put into service again for World War II production. The company subcontracted aircraft parts for the effort and built 44 Fairchild PT-19 and 306 PT-23 licensed aircraft designs.[10] It also was one of 8 companies that competed for a combat troop glider. Its XCG-5 did not go into production.[11]\n\nIn 1945, the St. Louis Aircraft Corporation was shut down after wartime contracts ended.[12]\n\nAircraft\n\n[edit]\n\nSummary of aircraft built by St. Louis Aircraft Model name First flight Number built Type Curtiss JN-4D (license built) 1918 Scout plane St. Louis Cardinal 1928 21 Sport monoplane St. Louis PT-35 1935 1 Biplane primary trainer St. Louis YPT-15 1940 14 Primary Trainer St. Louis PT-LM-4 1940 1 Primary Trainer St Louis CG-5 1941 1 Combat glider PT-19 (License built) 1941 44 Primary trainer PT-23 (License built) 1941 306 Primary trainer\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
