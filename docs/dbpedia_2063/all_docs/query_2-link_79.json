        "text": "22 Jan â€“ Taiwan-based director Midi Z has wrapped up filming his first mainstream film, \"The Unseen Sister\", starring Zanilia Zhao and Zhu Xinlei.\n\nAs reported on Variety, the upcoming movie, which is adapted from Zhang Yueran's novel \"Da Qiao Xiao Qiao\", stars Zanilia as Zu Yan. Zu Yan is a border town girl who works hard for many years to become a well-known actress who finds herself facing a blackmail from an unknown person while also dealing with her long-lost sister (Zhu), who suddenly arrives from Myanmar to see her.\n\nThe sister also brings with her incidents and revelations from the past as well as hints of a larger crisis linking the seemingly coincidental events of her return and the blackmail.\n\n\"This is both a film that is quite close to my own personal background and my most commercial picture to date,\" said Midi. \"It is quite suspenseful and is shot in Mandarin, but is not really targeted at Chinese audiences. Foreign audiences won't have a problem at all.\"\n\nHe stated that the project has been in his mind for many years, and was delayed previously due to his commitment to filming his other film, \"Nina Wu\"."
