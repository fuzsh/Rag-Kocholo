        "text": "Annelous Stiggelbout is a literary translator, working from Chinese to Dutch. When we heard she had been translating children’s books too, we were keen to learn more, and to ask about the reception of Chinese children’s books in The Netherlands. Thank you Annelous, for agreeing to this interview!\n\nPlease tell us about yourself. What would you like our readers to know about you?\n\nMy name is Annelous Stiggelbout and I am a translator of Chinese literature into Dutch. I’ve been active as a literary translator since 2006, full-time since 2013. I mainly translate for adults: novels and short stories, by authors such as Mian Mian 棉棉, Sheng Keyi 盛可以, Liu Zhenyun 刘震云 and others, and also a detective novel by Chan Ho-kei 陳浩基 and Sanmao’s 三毛 Stories of the Sahara. Last year I organised and edited the Dutch translation of Ten Loves, a short story collection by Zhang Yueran 张跃然. And of course, I translated two children’s books by Cao Wenxuan 曹文軒. I’m also involved in the promotion of Chinese literature in the Netherlands, assisting in various festivals and activities aimed at increasing interest in this region.\n\nYou’ve translated two books by Cao Wenxuan into Dutch – please could you introduce them to us?\n\nI translated two books from Cao Wenxuan’s 萌萌鸟 series – in Dutch, that’s Wawa de Wondervogel (‘Wawa the Miracle Bird’). Wawa is a strange bird that once upon a time landed in in Spreeuwenstad (‘Starling Town’) and likes to help his friends there and the other people of Spreeuwenstad. The series is published by the publishing house Leonon Kinderboeken. I have translated two books in the series: Waar is de baby?《偷走娃娃的人》 and De zwarte kat《黑猫》.Leonon Kinderboeken also published three earlier books in the series, translated by a different translator (from English). They are illustrated by LI Guangyu 李广宇.\n\nIn Waar is de baby? (‘Where is the baby’), Wawa sees a baby is kidnapped when the baby’s brother doesn’t pay attention for just a minute. Wawa goes after the kidnapper and shows the people of the town where the baby is, so they find him again.\n\nIn De zwarte kat (‘The black cat’), Wawa makes a new bird-friend, a little siskin. But the evil black cat catches and eats the siskin. Wawa takes revenge by making the cat’s life very difficult. In the end, he mourns his little friend.\n\nHow did you come to translate them? Did you recommend/pitch them to the publisher or how did it come about?\n\nIn most cases, a literary agent pitches books to a publishing house, and then the publishing house goes looking for a translator. And that’s also what happened in this case: the publisher, Lenard Wolters, had heard of me through the author of another book I had translated (by Yue Tao 岳韬), and asked if I was interested in translating these books. And I was, of course! I sometimes try to pitch books to publishers, but I find this very difficult. I can be very enthusiastic about a book, but whether the publisher buys it also depends on their budget, whether they have room for another book, whether they think the Dutch audience will like it, etc etc. I’ll continue to try pitching books to publishing houses occasionally, but I’ll mostly leave it to literary agents, who are much better at it.\n\nAre people in the Netherlands receptive to translated children’s literature? And to Chinese children’s literature?\n\nPeople in the Netherlands are very receptive to translated children’s literature (and to translated literature in general – something like 40% of all books sold in the Netherlands are translated). From picture books to YA, all kinds of books are translated. Most of these translated books are from English. I don’t know the exact percentages by heart I’m afraid. However, only very few Chinese children’s books are translated. I asked a children’s book expert, Richard Thiel, whether he knew how many and as far as we could find, some 35 titles have been translated in total (including 32 in the catalogue of the CBK) . Thiel then wrote a blog (in Dutch) about my question and the answer. [For details of the books scroll down to the end of this post]\n\nWhy so few, I’m not sure, though I can speculate. There are, of course, cultural differences, so it’s easier for a Dutch child (or parent) to understand and enjoy a book about children from Germany or even the US. And books from familiar places are probably easier to market for publishers. China is far away and the language is very different, which means Dutch and Chinese publishers don’t easily find each other (or didn’t in the past), and there are fewer translators. I hope the situation will gradually improve, because I’ve seen some really interesting, nice and good Chinese children’s books that I’d love to introduce to Dutch readers.\n\nHow is the visibility of Chinese children’s books in the Netherlands?\n\nVisibility of Chinese children’s literature is not very good in the Netherlands. I can speculate about the answers – I mentioned some factors earlier. In addition, of the books that have been translated, most are published by small publishing houses (Leonon Kinderboeken, Ming Ya) with limited promotional possibilities, or by a very large publishing house (Clavis) that doesn’t specifically focus on the Chinese titles, and as a result these titles are lost in the bigger ocean of their books. The recent Chinese library project, where the library in the town of Veldhoven, where visitors can borrow from a collection of 200 Chinese children’s books, is very cool. As I understand this project, it’s mainly aimed at Chinese-speaking expats and their children, giving them a place to meet and keep in touch with their home culture. Perhaps some Dutch parents will also get interested in the books they see there, even though they can’t read them!
