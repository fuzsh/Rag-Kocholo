In return for our translating and publishing this set of essays, Unitas Magazine published in their September 2012 issue an excerpt, via Francis Li Zhuoxiong's Chinese translation (which we commissioned), of Dominique Edd√©'s forthcoming novel Kite, that first appeared in our July 2012 issue.\n\nWe would like to thank Jiang Chenxin especially for her role in helping us rope in members of the And Other Stories Chinese Reading Group to participate in this project."
