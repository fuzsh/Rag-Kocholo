        "text": "Yan Dong\n\nI am Yan Dong, 16. I am passionate about tackling real-world challenges using synthetic biology. I not only love biology, genetics, and chemistry, but also love arts. As a member of my school's iGEM competition team, I served as the art director. I greatly enjoyed contributing my artistic talent and my subject strengths to the competition. I am grateful to be in the competition and to be a member of the team.\n\nWeizhao Feng\n\nHello everyone, my name is Weizhao Feng and I am a member of SHSBNU-China. I have a great passion for biology and am dedicated to using synthetic biology to transform our world. My dream is to use technology to bring benefits and progress to humanity, and in this process, I hope to play my role and showcase my abilities.\n\nYueran Li\n\nI'm YueRan Li, 16. The family environment of a medical family has given me a strong interest in biology since I was young. I have strong social and communication skills, and the iGEM competition makes me very excited. I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in it and contribute to genetic research with my team members.\n\nZhishuo Liu\n\nWhen I was in primary school, the father of my best friend often went on trips to Antarctica for biological research. When I first saw his photos with various polar animals, I became very interested in biology . Since then I have dreamed of becoming a genetic biologist. The IGEM competition gave me a platform to show myself. My team and I are going to challenge genetic engineering through IGEM.\n\nWeichong Sun\n\nHi, I'm Weichong Sun, a 16-year-old high school student, who loves biology and chemistry. I'm curious about the origin and the nature of living things, which makes me enjoy various kinds of experiments. During my spare time, I love playing piano and collecting my favorite music albums. I'm glad to take part in this iGEM competition.\n\nSixiao Wu\n\nMy name is Sixiao Wu, and I am the team leader for this year. I have always been influenced by people around me to aspire to become a doctor and have a strong interest in biology. The ordered and efficient survival methods of living organisms have greatly impressed me, and the new knowledge of synthetic biology has sparked my interest in further exploration. I am honored to participate in iGEM and serve as a team leader, and during the preparation for the competition, I have gained a lot in various aspects.\n\nJinran Yan\n\nI’m Jinran Yan, I am one of the leaders of this iGEM team. I decided to dedicate my life to biology at a very young age because I thought it would be cool to change the world by myself or as a team! Therefore, I am very glad to have the chance to lead the team and deepen my understanding of biology as well.\n\nPeining Zhang\n\nMy name is Peining Zhang, and I have maintained a strong passion for biology since the eighth grade. Synthetic biology, in particular, has become one of my favorite disciplines as it offers a means to address numerous challenges in our world today. I am thrilled to be a part of our team, SHSBNU-China, as it provides me with an incredible opportunity to enhance my knowledge and broaden my experiences.\n\nChongyue Zhao\n\nHi, I’m Chongyue Zhao. I had the privilege of leading the Human Practice group within the SHSBNU-China team. In this role, I demonstrated a deep love for Life Science and an immense passion for Human Practice. I connected directly and made interviews with textile experts,experienced heart surgeons, investors and entrepreneurs, professionals from various fields. I also organized our team's visits to Beijing's largest medical center, where we conducted in-person interviews with numerous patients. These interactions were invaluable in shaping our innovative ideas and experimental plans. I also played a pivotal role in Project Establishment, with a strong focus on conducting the entire wet-labs Experiments. And I have been instrumental in Hardware Design and Testing using Biomaterials Textile Technology with the help of textile professors. Through these experiences, I honed my communication skills and deepened my sense of teamwork, broadened my horizons and enriched my understanding of Bio-tech. My involvement in iGEM has been a fulfilling journey of personal growth, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn and contribute within this inspiring community. iGEM has made me addicted and I'm looking forward to immersing myself in Biology and going further. Good luck to our BIG SHSBNU-China!\n\nDingtang Zhao\n\nMy name is Dingtang Zhao from SHSBNU-China. My interest in synthesis biology is derived from an occasional opportunity to see the iGEM program, which uses advanced techniques to solve a realistic problem. Here I’d like to cite a few words from a football coach: “You love what you do. That is called passion.” I’m sure that I’ll be fully dedicated to combining my favorite subject with a concerning humanity issue and help the world become better.\n\nYuanzhong Zhou\n\nI'm Yuanzhong Zhou, 16, and I have been interested in biology since junior high school. For me, synthetic biology is not just a discipline, but a tool that helps us understand the world from the most microscopic level and a technique that solves natural problems from a genetic perspective, and I'm eager to pursue further studies in it. So, it's my pleasure to be a member of SHSBNU_China to exploring the leading edge of synthetic biology."
