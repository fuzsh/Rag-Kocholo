        "text": "The project of reconstruction-upgrade of the reservoir area of ​​the Sisak oil terminal includes reservoirs A-2513 and A-2512 with associated equipment and infrastructure and its connection with the existing system. The goal of this project was to increase the capacity of the storage space at the Sisak Terminal from the previous 500,000 m3 to 580,000 m3.\n\nIn a consortium with the companies Monting d.o.o. and Đuro Đaković d.d., the company ING-GRAD d.o.o. performs construction works that include earthworks and reinforced concrete works. It was necessary to improve the foundation soil with gravel steps, construct reinforced concrete foundation rings and the floor of the reservoir. The prepared bedding consists of a number of layers of different materials that prevent wetting and weakening of the soil, as well as percolation of media into the soil and pollution of groundwater. The diameter of the reservoir is 73 m, and the height is 20 m."
