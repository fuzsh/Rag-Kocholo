For now, Mol’s only alternative is oil transported by Croatia’s Jadranski Naftovod DD, known as Janaf.\n\nThe refiner earlier this month signed a deal with Janaf for transport and storage that expires March 31. It’s now looking for a long-term pipeline operation and development agreement, though pricing is still a point of contention and volumes may not be sufficient to make up for Russian imports, according to Hungary’s government.\n\n“The Druzhba pipeline serves Hungary, Slovakia and basically half of Czech Republic, something the Adriatic one can’t do, so that means someone either wouldn’t have sufficient crude oil or everyone would get less,” Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in an interview published Tuesday on Origo news website.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMol has seen its profit soar last year after Orban secured an exemption for the company from under the European Union’s oil sanctions, imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Those earnings are now financing Hungary’s energy subsidies after the government raised its windfall tax on Russian crude refining to 95% from 40% last month.\n\nThe EU has banned seaborne shipments of Russian crude since Dec. 5 and has imposed limits on shipments of Russian fuels from Feb. 5.\n\nWhile the restriction may have little effect on Mol’s fuel stations in Hungary, Serbia and Romania, it may hamper the company’s shipments to Austria from its refinery outside of Bratislava, Slovakia, Ratatics said. The market has generally prepared for the restrictions by building up stockpiles but unexpected refinery outages may still roil supplies, he noted.\n\nRatatics said he doesn’t expect the bloc to expand its oil embargo while the company upgrades its refineries to process crude grades other than Russian Urals. The works, which include an expansion of storage capacity, should take about two years and cost roughly $500 million once a decision is made on investments. Mol is also seeking EU funding for the switch.\n\n(Updates with foreign minister’s comment in sixth paragraph. An earlier version corrected the age of Mol’s vice president.)\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
