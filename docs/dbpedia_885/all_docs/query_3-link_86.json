It conjures up notions of niche, entrepreneurial opportunities for those managers prepared to take risks. It also implies a degree of dynamism in changing market opportunities for the brave. On a less positive note, emerging markets imply a significant number of impediments to doing business in the time-honoured way in developed, mature markets. A lack of transparency, an absence of predictable institutions, clientelism and underdeveloped consumer demand are the negative benchmarks for managers in these countries. Indeed, trying to be successful in these kinds of markets normally implies a mixture of frustration, optimism and patience. Linguistic barriers also play a significant role in slowing down business transactions. Local market knowledge, so intrinsically linked to cultural-linguistic barriers is arguably one of the most difficult and intangible barriers to overcome in emerging markets. Countless anecdotes of cultural miscomprehension abound in trying to sign a contract or develop relationships with key suppliers and customers. In many senses, this is precisely the aim of this book: to help managers get more business intelligence on emerging markets; to help prepare business people for the challenges they will face in future business endeavours. By taking such a broad range of countries in Eastern and Central Europe, this book provides an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the institutional, environmental and structural issues facing entrepreneurs and managers in the diverse and challenging Eastern and Central European (ECE) region. The remainder of this foreword is devoted to giving the reader a brief summary of the structure of the book and offering some personal reflections on doing business in ECE – one of the most exciting regions of the world economy. The concept of the ‘PEST’ analysis: evaluating Political, Economic, Social and Technological environments facing companies is a wellestablished and robust taxonomic approach. Indeed, a grasp of each of these factors enables managers to get an idea of ‘country political risk’ involved in doing business and especially foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions. The ratings agencies themselves have developed models for country risk, which help inform decision-makers on market entry x\n\nForeword xi\n\nstrategies. All of these factors are also intrinsically linked – it would not be possible to get an understanding of the current investment climate in a particular emerging market without an understanding of the political situation. Each of the chapters in this book does an excellent job of opening up an understanding of the current business environment with reference to the current political situation. In this context, it is important to realize that the majority of the countries surveyed in this book have made joining the European Union (EU) a central aim of foreign policy. Seen in this light, it is clear that we should expect an increasingly friendly approach towards foreign direct investment (FDI). This is because EU rules will require significant liberalization of the regulatory systems in place in these countries. Indeed, countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland have fully harmonized their domestic regulations on FDI with EU regulations making the legislative basis identical as that of the EU. The political situation in these countries is also intrinsically linked to the economic development of these nations – as incomes rise in these ECE emerging markets, political stability is bound to increase as a broad based middle class will be expected to favour more business-friendly legislation in the fields of fiscal policy. This is likely to further encourage more liberal and business-minded politics and may well undermine nationalistic forces in the parliaments of these countries. Notable among the countries covered by this volume is Belarus. The Belarus leadership under Lukashenko has decided that its economic future, rather than being based on inclusion within a wider EU, is to be based around a confusing mix of rapprochement with Russia and economic self-sufficiency. As the chapter notes, this creates specific problems for foreign business interests in this country. Turkey is also an ‘outlier’ in the countries covered. First, this is because despite the official position that it would eventually become a member of the EU, its cultural background being seen as a link between Asia and Europe makes it unique. Second, despite the existence of a dynamic entrepreneurial class, Turkey is suffering from severe macroeconomic problems. The continuing disagreement over the future of Cyprus is also likely to hinder Turkey’s entry into the EU. Social changes are also closely linked to technological forces in these societies. The growth in the use of the Internet in these emerging markets has opened a youth demographic to international influences, thus increased demand for ‘cosmopolitan’ products and services continues. This is buttressed by increasing incomes and leisure time for the younger generation of citizens in these rapidly evolving societies.\n\nxii Foreword\n\nEach of the chapters in this book has a section devoted to cultural issues. This is probably one of the most valuable aspects of this reference guidebook since despite the increased internationalization of these economies, cultural specificities remain important in all of the countries concerned. The difference between an Estonian and a Hungarian conducting contractual negotiations is huge and is largely a function of the indigenous cultural–linguistic map in each of the countries surveyed. Indeed, the experience of many observers in ECE emerging markets is that an understanding and appreciation for the negotiating styles of different ethnicities in the region can liberate managers from being lost in seemingly endless barriers to successful business. One of the most tangible aspects of ECE emerging markets is the rapid rate of change of attitudes to service provision. Whereas less than a decade ago, it would have been difficult to find late-opening convenience stores in many of these states, they are now commonplace and cater to both local and foreign citizens. Indeed, the growth of the service sector is probably the single biggest market opportunity for entrepreneurs in these societies. With increased cosmopolitanism comes increased crime. One of the negative consequences of the changes since 1989 has been the growth in theft, violent crime and illegal drug-related activities. This has spawned a growth in ‘protection’ companies linked to aspects of Mafia and organized crime. On the positive side, future EU membership is forcing governments to clamp down on state corruption. Increased transparency in the fields of public procurement has a considerable way to go but it has improved manifestly since the early years of post-1989 transition. Thus on balance, doing business in Eastern and Central Europe is likely to be easier, more exciting and hopefully more profitable for those managers and entrepreneurs who are seeking a challenge. Rising incomes, and increased access to the EU augur well for the future of these emerging markets. Indeed, there may come a time in which we no longer refer to these economies as ‘emerging’ markets. In the meantime, opportunities abound! Dr Yusaf Akbar teaches International Political Economy at IMC Graduate School of Management, Central European University, Budapest, Hungary.

The downfall of the symbol that stifled the hopes and dreams of several nations and their people was the predictable result of the half-hidden decrepitude of the Soviet empire and the centrifugal forces that cohabited within it. The fall of the wall marked the disappearance of what Winston Churchill called the ‘Iron Curtain’ and, more importantly, it signified the end of the Cold War. Despite all of Mikhail Gorbachev and of Boris Yeltsin’s efforts, the formal disintegration of the Soviet Union was only a matter of time. After two attempted coups within the space of a year, the USSR finally acknowledged the independence of its former republics in 1991, thus closing a chapter of almost half a century of communist domination and downtrodden liberties in Eastern and Central Europe. The economic, political, social, and cultural transformation that ensued and unfolded was an extraordinary historic event. Several ‘new’ states rose from the ashes of the Soviet empire and immediately engaged in the construction of viable market economies. From the perspective of the new leaderships in that region, the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 meant that the wealth and prosperity of Western countries was finally within reach. But the initial euphoria rapidly gave way to tough budget constraints and discipline, privatization, and the arduous establishment of the working institutions of representative democracy. A decade later, specialists of Eastern and Central Europe have reported important developmental disparities. A handful of countries, most noticeably those that were geographically closer to the West (e.g. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and to a lesser degree the Baltic States and Slovakia) have made significant progress towards free markets and democracy, and are even patiently queuing for a slice of the action within the European Union. However, a much longer list of other states, such as Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the former non-Baltic Soviet republics, have made little or no progress. Finally, certain middle-of-the-road countries such as Belarus, Croatia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, are still struggling between the two categories at the whim of their political leaders. xiii\n\nxiv Introduction\n\nSurprisingly, Eastern and Central Europe itself remains a relatively untapped market. Most investors prefer Russia, although not without risk, as evidenced by the events of 1998. Nevertheless, in most of these countries, the overall transition has been quite positive, and most observers forecast continued real growth in the coming years. Access to mid- to long-term capital, Western technology and management skills will be the key factors shaping the future development and success of the countries of that region. However, while opportunities abound, doing business there may prove to be quite convoluted. Building a business relationship in general depends in part upon obtaining reliable information not only about a partner, but also about the country’s business, legal, political, cultural, and regulatory environment. In an emerging market, information is not readily available; often it is out of date or unreliable. Our book, Doing Business in Emerging Europe, aims at filling this information gap. It provides the first user-friendly source of practical information for executives doing or planning on doing business in that region. For obvious reasons, we decided to focus on the subset of most promising countries, namely the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey. We also decided to include an overview of Belarus and Ukraine, as they have the potential of becoming major emerging markets. Since the objective of our book is to serve as a reference guide to business practitioners, we decided to avoid cumbersome footnotes and lengthy macroeconomic statistics that usually plague academic books. Using a common structure, each chapter provides detailed information on a broad range of important topics specific to each country. These include vital geographic and demographic data, a general overview of history and politics, various industry sectors, the investment climate, taxation, the types of business organizations, the banking system and services, the financial market, accounting and business practices, the legal and regulatory environment (including dispute-resolution options), as well as each country’s etiquette, and cultural and business behaviour. We limited each chapter to no more than 8,000 words and switched all additional useful references, including on-line websites, contact addresses and a bibliography to a separate section. Our book draws primarily from public sources, which are listed in “References and Contacts”. In writing this book, every effort has been made to collect the most up-to-date information and present it in a clear manner. Of course, the information in the text is intended merely as general guidelines. Businesspeople should consult professional advisers for more detailed\n\nIntroduction xv\n\ninformation on specific topics (for example, taxes, regulation, and legal issues) before making important decisions. Writing this book was a great learning experience. However, we could not have completed it without those who have provided valuable suggestions and insights along the way. We would like to thank in particular our Editor, Caitlin Cornish, for allowing us to pursue this undertaking. Most sincere thanks go to Tanja Maffei, who served as Zoubir’s research assistant in 1997 and 1998 at Thunderbird, The American Graduate School of International Management in Arizona, USA. In close collaboration with Zoubir, she developed a template, which all successive research assistants have used for every country under study. Zoubir would also like to thank Andrea Banes, his research assistant in 1999 at Thunderbird Europe in France, who did considerable research on Hungary and Poland. We would also like to thank our research assistants at Thunderbird Europe, namely, Shelby Kardas, Dipali Murti, Yvett Rebelo, Lucinda Gilbert, Brian Wozniak, and Yan Yanovskiy, for their assistance during the research process. We would also like to express our appreciation to Jill Monney for proofreading and checking over the manuscript. Last but by no means least, our gratitude go to our families for their support. This book was written during hours literally stolen from them. We hope that their patience will prove worthwhile.\n\n1 Belarus\n\n1.1 Basic facts The Republic of Belarus is a small territory (207,600 sq km) situated in the heart of Europe, at the crossroads of trade routes from West to East and from North to South. It shares a border with Russia (959 km) in the northeast, Ukraine (891 km) in the south, Poland (605 km) in the east and the Baltic States in the northwest, that is Lithuania (502 km) and Latvia (141 km). The name ‘Belarus’ means ‘white Rus’ and there is still no exact version of its origin. Some historians believe that ‘white’ in old Slavic languages meant ‘free’, pointing to the fact that Belarus was never invaded by the Tartars, unlike the other principalities in the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries. The Republic of Belarus is divided into six administrative provinces (Brest, Gomel, Grodno, Minsk, Mogilev and Vitebsk) that are subdivided into 120 administrative districts. The capital is Minsk (1.7 million inhabitants), an ancient city known as a major trade and craft centre. Other important cities are Gomel (0.5 million), Vitebsk (0.37 million), and Mogilev (0.37 million). The Belarusian population consists of 10 million people, composed of pure Belarusians (77.9%), Russians (13%), Poles (4.1%), Ukrainians (2.9%) and other ethnic groups. The official language is Belarusian, a Slavic language closely related to Ukrainian and Russian. The latter was also retained in the 1994 Constitution as the language of inter-ethnic communication. English and German are also widely used for business purposes. Most of the population (71%) is urban and has a high level of education. The dominant religion is Eastern Orthodox (80%) followed by Roman Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim. 1\n\n2 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nThe Belarusian climate is characterized by cold winters and cool, humid summers. It represents a transition between a continental and maritime climate. The average daily temperature in the capital city, Minsk, ranges from 6 °C in January to 18 °C in July. The annual rainfall is around 558.8 to 711.2 mm. The Belarusian terrain is generally flat and contains much marshland and agricultural land occupies almost half of the territory. Favourable natural conditions enable it to produce highly profitable commodities, such as milk, beef, pork, poultry meat, eggs, grain, potatoes, fibre flax, sugar beet, etc. The potential for cattle breeding represents the dominant commodity branch of agriculture. Rye, wheat, barley and oats are the main crops in the grain sector. The official currency is the Belarusian rouble (official symbol BYR), as distinct from the Russian rouble.\n\nMeans of communication Official statistics list 740 newspapers, 294 magazines, four information agencies and 145 television and radio stations in Belarus. Technically, these figures are correct. However, state-controlled newspapers dominate political information due to their wide circulation. In addition, there is only one domestic nationwide television channel, Belarusian Television (BT) and the leading television channels are Russian.\n\n1.2 Historical background It is hard to define precisely the origins of Belarus. Prior to the ninth century, its territory was occupied by several tribes that lived in small communities located in forests or near rivers and lakes. Then, some of these tribes – who had much in common in their language, customs and beliefs – decided to merge to create Kyivan Rus’, the first East Slavic state, and adopted Christianity. When its Prince Yaroslav the Wise died in 1054, the state split into several principalities, including Polatsk and Turau, the nucleus of the future Belarus. In 1240, the principalities of Belarus came under the control of Lithuania. In 1569, Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania united under the name of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Belarus remained part of this union until 1795, when Russia, Prussia and Austria dismantled the Polish territory. Belarus was transferred to the Russian Empire, with the exception of a few Western lands, which were given to Prussia. In 1839, Tsar Nicholas I adopted a policy of Russification, banned the Belarusian language and imposed Orthodox religion, heavy taxes, and\n\nBelarus 3\n\nmilitary service lasting 25 years. This resulted in several anti-Russian uprisings and large-scale migrations (1.5 million people in 50 years) to the United States and Siberia. During World War I, Belarus was the theatre of fierce battles between the German and Russian armies. In 1917, the Russian Revolution caused Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate and leave power to Lenin’s Bolsheviks. In December, the Belarusian Congress proclaimed a republican government in Belarus and separated the country from the Bolshevik Russian Empire. Nevertheless, the result of the 1919–21 war between Russia and Poland was again the partitioning of Belarus between the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR) and Poland. The short renaissance of Belarusian culture in 1920–28 was thus brought to a halt by Stalin’s mass deportations to Siberia and executions in the 1930s, as well as by Polish persecutions in western Belarus. Belarus was also heavily affected during World War II. When Germany attacked Poland in 1939, Soviet troops occupied the Western part of Belarus and deported anyone not strictly following communist ideology. In June 1941, when German troops invaded Belarus on their way to Moscow, they imposed a policy of Germanization on Belarus and started mass execution of the Jewish population. During the three years of Nazi occupation, more than two million people died and most cities were devastated. To make matters worse, when the Red Army liberated Belarus from the Nazis, Stalin deported those who had collaborated with the Nazis in any way, including German prisoners of war, since they were ‘ideologically contaminated’, and those who were suspected of ‘bourgeois nationalism’. Both Stalin and Khrushchev imposed a policy of heavy Russification, banned the Belarusian language and suppressed Belarusian national culture. In 1986, Belarus was severely affected by the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. It is estimated that Belarus absorbed around 70% of the radioactive contaminants spewed out by the accident. Several intellectuals also sent a petition to Gorbachev expressing their concerns about the future of the Belarus culture (the ‘cultural Chernobyl’). Several groups started to publicly demand reforms. Nevertheless, in the 1990 elections, the Communist Party of Byelorussia won 86% of the seats in the republic’s Supreme Soviet. It was only in 1991 that a wave of major strikes put an end to the country’s political apathy and ideological inertia. Following Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine, the Supreme Soviet in Minsk declared the independence of Belarus. After extensive negotiations, the Supreme Soviet adopted a new constitution that declared Belarus a democracy, granted freedom\n\n4 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nof religion, established Belarusian as the official language and proclaimed the Belarus’ goal to become a neutral non-nuclear state. Nevertheless, the winner of the 1994 presidential election was Aleksandr Lukashenko, who is known for his intention to bind Belarus to Russia politically, economically and militarily.\n\n1.3 Political environment Belarus is a presidential republic. The constitution that came into force in March 1994 created the office of president and a constitutional court, with a clear separation of powers. The bicameral National Assembly (Natsionalnoye Sobranie) is a representative and legislative body that was established by the November 1996 constitutional referendum. In theory, it consists of 260 members. It is divided into a Council of the Republic and a House of Representatives. The Council of the Republic has 64 members, who serve a four-year term; the president appoints eight members and local council deputies elect the other 56. The House of Representatives has 110 members, all of whom came from the defunct Supreme Soviet. In practice, since the November 1996 constitutional referendum, the Belarusian parliament has a merely ceremonial function. This explains why (a) 40 members of the Supreme Soviet refused to join the House of Representatives on the grounds that the referendum was unconstitutional; and (b) the opposition withdrew its delegates and created a shadow government, called the opposition Supreme Soviet as a successor to the dissolved Supreme Soviet. The president is the head of state as well as the head of the security police and the army. His powers have been significantly extended by the November 1996 constitutional referendum. Among these powers are the appointment of the prime minister, the nomination of candidates for six key ministries and the appointment of half of the members and the head of the Constitutional Court, as well as the head of the Supreme Court. Furthermore, the president may dissolve parliament in the event that it infringes upon the constitution. Therefore, in practice, president Lukashenko exercises complete control over most aspects of government. According to the Ministry of Justice, there are 18 political parties in Belarus. The major parties are the Belarusian Communist Party (KPB) and the Agrarian Party (APB). The former models itself on the USSR, opposes reforms and privatization and supports Lukashenko, while the latter was founded by agrarian specialists and has a left wing proEuropean orientation. In practice, many parliamentarians are registered as independents, and the opposition parties to president Lukashenko\n\nBelarus 5\n\nassemble in the Consultative Council of Parties. The latter comprises the Belarusian Popular Front (BNF), the United Civic Party (OGP), the Belarusian Social Democratic Party (BSDP), the Labour Party (BRP) and the Party of Communists of Belarus (PKB). Since the 1996 referendum, there have been numerous tensions between the Lukashenko government and the opposition. According to the latter, Lukashenko continues to curtail human rights, limit opposition demonstrations and arrest key dissidents. There are also numerous tensions within the government, due to severe criticism by Lukashenko of government officials for failing to reduce inflation. This has resulted in various cabinet reshuffles. Nevertheless, the parliamentary elections in October 2000 gave a majority to pro-Lukashenko candidates, which is not surprising given the boycott called by opposition forces. The presidential elections in September 2001 turned out to be non-democratic and meaningless. Officially, Lukashenko was re-elected for another four-year mandate with 75.6% of the votes on the first round in a poll condemned as rigged by Western governments, independent monitors and opposition parties. In their statement, EU officials even declared: ‘The European Union regrets that the Belarus authorities have not seized the opportunity afforded by these presidential elections to engage their country fully on the path of democracy’.\n\n1.4 Economic environment and infrastructure Despite an ideal location, an industrial base superior to that of most of its neighbouring states, a cheap, educated workforce and ready access to the Russian marketplace, the economic environment in Belarus lags behind all of its neighbours due to the lack of economic reforms and concerns about the country’s progress towards a market-oriented economy.\n\nMacroeconomic tendencies Despite the positive impact of Russia’s strong recovery, economic growth has slowed down in Belarus, as illustrated by the GDP growth that dropped from 11.4% in 1997 to an estimated 4.8% in 2001. In 2001 (a presidential election year), the government significantly increased all wages following its promise of an average monthly wage equivalent to US$ 100. Consequently, the budgetary wage bill jumped from 6% of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 9% in 2001, while the overall wage share rose from 34% of GDP to 39%. This has put considerable pressure on\n\n6 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nenterprises, squeezing their profits and limiting their ability to invest and, therefore, their future growth potential. Overall, this resulted in a weakening of economic activity, as suggested by the rising level of inventories, non-cash transactions (in particular export barter arrangements) and domestic arrears. Although CPI inflation declined from 294% in 1999 to an estimated 68% in 2001, monthly inflation picked up in the second half of 2001 due to wage increases, monetary easing and some price liberalization. The unemployment rate remained low at 2.3% in 2001. The current account deficit narrowed to US$ 162 million (1.3% of GDP) in 2000. This reflects an increase in agricultural exports and lower energy prices rather than any improvement in competitiveness. In reality, Belarus has been losing ground to its main external competitors, and most export increases were limited to sectors where Belarus has a quasi-monopolistic share in Russia. Nevertheless, some steps were taken to initiate structural reforms in 2001. The Belarusian authorities made major headway in foreign exchange liberalization in 2001 leading to further deepening of the foreign exchange market. In order to achieve a monetary union with Russia in 2005, the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) anchored the Belarusian rouble to the Russian rouble with a band of 2% points around central parity and gave advanced warning of monthly devaluations. This band was later enlarged to 5 percentage points. Several interventions of the NBB were necessary to reduce pressures on the exchange market when demand for dollars increased on account of higher wage incomes. These interventions were facilitated by a stabilization loan of US$ 54 million granted by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). During 2001, the Belarusian rouble depreciated against the US dollar by 2.5% per month on average, which was less than expected. In 2001, the government also started to tighten monetary policy, dismantled the extensive system of price controls, reduced budgetary and implicit subsidies and cross-subsidies and announced a new investment code in October 2001. The latter is a single, comprehensive document, which replaced existing multiple regulations on foreign investment. It should provide a better legal framework for domestic and foreign investments and make the business/investment climate in Belarus friendlier.\n\nIndustry During the Soviet era, Belarus’ industry was dedicated to defence-related industries and human capital-intensive goods, such as machinery and equipment. Consequently, in comparison with other newly independent\n\nBelarus 7\n\nstates, Belarus has maintained a relatively well-developed and diversified industrial profile, which represented around 34% of GDP in 2001. However, since 1991, Belarusian industrial companies have had to fight to find new markets as well as new suppliers of raw materials (e.g. steel, plastics, resins, etc.) and energy, on which Belarus continues to depend heavily. Moreover, in 2001, a sharp increase in real wages cut back labour productivity, weakened the financial situation of several enterprises and significantly increased barter and arrears. For instance, a large part of industrial production is used as payments in kind to Russia for gas and construction materials arrears. It should be noted that most industrial companies are still state-owned or state-controlled, and that the State also influences industrial companies that were privatized through output and price directives from the line ministries.\n\nEnergy Belarus is highly dependent on energy imports, with 88% of its total energy consumption coming from Russia. Russia’s Gazprom supplies gas to Belarus at a discount. The latter implicitly accounts for a transit fee on the transhipment of Russian gas to Europe through Belarusian pipelines. Despite this subsidy, Belarus has built up large debts to Gazprom, essentially because of difficult payment recovery from consumers. In April 2001, the corresponding debt to Gazprom was renegotiated and rescheduled over three years, with payments made by supplies of material resources. The sole natural gas distributor is Beltopgas and its major consumer (60%) is the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, which converts the gas into electricity and thermal energy is sold to enterprises, large industrial plants, households and the agricultural sector. Another major actor is Beltransgas, which operates the 3,780 miles of natural gas pipelines in Belarus and plans to build new pipelines and compressor stations. Although it lacks significant indigenous oil reserves, Belarus also has a small oil industry and a fairly large refining industry, but the lack of political and economic reform in the past decade has hindered any investment to increase production or improve oil-processing efficiency. Consequently, Belarus needs to import most of its oil consumption from Russia, and about 50% of Russia’s net oil exports transits through Belarusian pipelines. On the electricity side, Belarus has a power-generating capacity of 7.4 GW, almost entirely from oil- and natural gas-fired power plants. This capacity is steadily decreasing due to decaying infrastructure, a lack of investment in maintenance and upgrades, and a decline in domestic demand. Consequently, Belarus needs to import most of its electricity\n\n8 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nfrom Lithuania. Large debts have been settled by a tripartite agreement with the Russian company Energiya, which buys electricity generated at Lithuania’s Ignalina nuclear plant for subsequent delivery to Belarus. Energiya pays for the electricity with nuclear fuel for the Ignalina plant, while Belarus pays Russia by supplying commodities. This apparently does not contradict the ‘nuclear-free’ declaration of Belarus.\n\nAgriculture Agriculture occupies almost half of Belarus territory. It employs 17% of the active population, but only represents around 15% of GDP. Natural conditions favour the production of milk, beef, pork and poultry meat, eggs, rye, wheat, barley and oats, potatoes, sugar beets, fibre flax, vegetables and fruits. The agricultural sector remains largely unreformed, and most farms are of the collective or public type. In ‘kolkhozes’, production and all the assets are the property of all the members of these farms, while in ‘sovhozes’, production and all the assets are the property of the state, and the workers are state employees. There are also a few private farms, which have proven to be more productive than collective/ public farms. Nevertheless, the president has stressed that collective farms and state enterprises should remain the foundation of the agricultural sector. The imposition of fixed prices for certain basic agricultural products has created few incentives for private ownership. Furthermore, since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in neighbouring Ukraine, nearly onethird of Belarus agricultural land is unusable, since it was contaminated by fallout. It should be noted that Belarus also possesses large, high-quality wood resources, particularly pine, fir, birch and oak. The total area of wood stock constitutes about 43% of the territory of the country and supplies timber, berries, mushrooms, medicinal raw material and honey. Despite intensive logging, the forest area is expanding due to wellorganized reforestation.\n\nFinancial sector Belarus has a two-tier banking system that consists of the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) and several commercial banks. The NBB is responsible for issuing money, managing the monetary and credit policy, stimulating the development of credit and financial institutions and regulating banking activities. Commercial banks execute all types of operations, including universal credit lending and investments. Six commercial banks (Belarusbank, Agroprombank, Promstroibank, Priorbank, Vnesheconombank, and Belinvestbank) account for more than 90% of\n\nBelarus 9\n\nthe Belarusian banking sector activities. The state owns a majority stake in three of these banks and a significant minority stake in the three others. The financial situation of most banks is delicate, due to the recent increase in bad loans and the lack of financial reserves. Short-term defaults should be avoided due to significant direct and indirect government ownership and involvement in bank management, as well as the regular liquidity support of the NBB for troubled institutions. However, long-term vulnerabilities will remain until the sector is completely restructured. There are several stock exchanges in Belarus, including the Agro-Industrial Trade and Stock Exchange, the Belarusian Stock Exchange, the Belarusian Universal Stock Exchange and the Minsk Stock Exchange. There are also 61 insurance companies, including the state-owned Belarusian state insurance company, which controls about 40% of total insurance deposits.\n\nTelecommunications Belarus has begun to renovate and upgrade its telecommunication services with the installation of digital equipment and fibre-optic links. Since 1999, a GSM digital cellular network has been introduced in the major cities of the country. A satellite-based system (INTELSAT, EUTELSAT, and INTERSPUTNIK) covers the national requirements in satellite circuits for telephony, data communications and television. Internet and e-mail services are now widely used in the capital city of Minsk, and on the regular mail side, EMS-BELARUS and the national network of express postal service, EXPRESS, offer one-day mail delivery.\n\nTransportation Belarus, situated at an important crossroads in Eastern Europe, has a well-developed transportation infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in the development of its economy. Belarus has over 55,000 km of roads and highways, which are in relatively good condition by CIS standards. Among these are major international transport corridors for cargo and passenger traffic (Berlin–Warsaw–Minsk–Moscow and Helsinki–St Petersburg–Pskov–Vitebsk–Gomel), as well as a good network of international bus routes. The railway network covers more than 5,500 km, but its use has been decreasing and now only operates at about 50% of its full capacity. Finally, Belarus has several civil airports, of which five are international – the major airport being Minsk-2. Belarus has no access to the sea and relies upon the use of other countries’ ports, such as Klaipeda (Lithuania), Ventspils (Latvia), Kaliningrad (Russia), Kherson and Nikolayev (Ukraine).\n\n10 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\n1.5 Legal environment and regulations Crime and corruption Belarus has a moderate crime rate. However, foreigners tend to be easily targeted by common street crime and should, therefore, be cautious. Although Belarus is not a signatory of the OECD Convention on combating bribery, giving or accepting a bribe in Belarus is a criminal act. Nevertheless, corruption may be encountered, particularly at local level. So far, it has not been identified as a particularly significant obstacle to foreign direct investment.\n\nJudicial system, dispute settlement and bankruptcy procedures The Belarusian judicial system cannot provide a reliable and impartial mechanism for resolving disputes, since it is not independent of the executive power. In particular, tax authorities have the power to disregard adverse court decisions and seize any assets unilaterally. A bankruptcy law was passed in 1991 and significantly amended in 1998, but bankruptcy proceedings are not often contemplated. As an illustration, many state-controlled enterprises operate at a significant loss and are simply subsidized. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive system of laws regulating everyday business matters and there is often an arbitrary understanding of current legislation. Existing laws are often in contradiction with presidential decrees, which appear unexpectedly and require that investors change their policies overnight. It should be noted that Belarus is a member of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), also known as the Washington Convention. As an affiliate of the New York Convention on the recognition and enforcement of arbitration awards, the Government of Belarus is required to uphold arbitration awards in disputes between Belarusian and foreign parties.\n\nTaxation, accounting, and auditing rules An income and profit tax is levied on all commercial entities. Income tax is paid on dividends at a rate of 15%. Profit tax is paid on the balance-sheet profit at a rate of 30%. Reduced rates apply to specific sectors (agro-industrial, construction, repair, etc.) and very small companies. Profit tax concessions or exemptions may be granted legislatively to environmental programmes, scientific research and disaster recovery at Chernobyl, or enterprises employing a minimum percentage of disabled workers and retirement-age workers. For individuals, income tax is collected on a progressive rate scale. Taxable income includes cash income\n\nBelarus 11\n\nin domestic and foreign currencies and in-kind income earned in Belarus as well as abroad. As a general rule, the tax rates are high and are applied to income before deduction of legitimate business expenses. The tax system also includes a real estate tax (1% for legal entities), a land tax, and a tax on use of natural resources.\n\nLaws on establishing and conducting business In September 1998, president Lukashenko suspended the procedure for business registration on the ground that it was too liberal. His major concern was the profusion of ‘one-day’ firms that were created to make a fast sale or purchase of hard currencies and then disappear. The new procedure he established in March 1999 is much more stringent and likely to raise concerns among new investors. Among other things, (a) the registering authority has full discretion to refuse an application for a limited liability corporation or to close down an existing corporation without court approval; and (b) limited liability clauses may be waived and the owners of an insolvent business may be held personally liable if a court so decides. In addition, to establish an enterprise with foreign capital in Belarus, it is necessary to apply for state registration at the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.\n\nVarious forms of business organizations available to foreigners Foreign investment in Belarus may take several forms. The most widespread is the share participation in enterprises established jointly with Belarusian legal entities and individuals – joint ventures, which are regulated by the law ‘On Foreign Investments on the Territory of the Republic of Belarus’. They essentially take the form of joint-stock societies and limited liability companies. The minimum contribution for a foreign investor is US$ 20,000. The law guarantees foreign investors the right to transfer dividends abroad in free convertible currencies. If the foreign investors represent more than 30% of the capital, these joint ventures may also set up prices on their products, works and services and choose their suppliers. An alternative is to set up an enterprise completely owned by foreign investors, a branch enterprise (the founder is not liable for a branch enterprise), or a company’s representation (it is not a legal entity and does all its business on behalf of the represented company).\n\nRestrictions on foreign investments Generally, there is no particular discrimination or screening against foreign investors. However, by law, foreign investment in banking, insurance, and stock exchanges may not exceed 49% of the outstanding shares.\n\n12 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nInvestment incentives Foreign investors and foreign enterprises (businesses in which the foreign ownership is at least 30%) are entitled to substantial value added tax (VAT), customs and income tax privileges at the initial stage of their business activities in Belarus, while local investors are denied many of such benefits. The Belarusian government may also provide additional benefits on an ad hoc basis, particularly to major big-name investors. The Belarusian Foreign Investment Promotion Agency (BFIPA) is also a useful source of support in such areas as legislation of business and search for local partners.\n\nProtection of property rights As a former member of the Soviet system, Belarus did not recognize the intellectual property rights of individuals. In 1994, the Civil Code was amended to define the rights that could be protected, that are patents for inventions, trademarks, service marks, and computer programs. Moreover, Belarus is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and a signatory to many other conventions on intellectual property rights.\n\nEntry requirements Foreign citizens entering Belarus – even in transit – should have a passport valid for three months beyond the intended stay, necessary travel documents for return or onward travel, and a visa. The latter is absolutely necessary, and obtaining one normally requires an official invitation from an organization authorized to invite business visitors to Belarus. Belarus also requires all foreign visitors entering the country to purchase Belarusian medical insurance, regardless of any other insurance one might have. The cost is proportional to the expected length of stay.\n\n1.6 Business environment Privatization The Ministry for Managing State Property and Privatization manages and co-ordinates the privatization process in Belarus. Its major aim is to reorganize state-owned and leased enterprises by turning them into open joint-stock companies to increase productivity, while at the same time avoiding social dislocation. The major channels to privatization are the transformation of state-owned enterprises into open joint-stock companies and the sale of state property through auctions and tenders.\n\nBelarus 13\n\nForeign investors may participate in these auctions and tenders, while specific authorization is needed in the case of direct transactions. So far, privatization in Belarus has been quite slow and limited to small-scale enterprises. Although the government’s intention is officially to accelerate the privatization process, the five-year economic development programme presented in May 2000 explicitly mentions that the state should continue to play a dominant role in the economy. Furthermore, according to the existing legislation, sale of stakes over 50% in industrial companies is forbidden, and the difficulty in converting the Belarusian rouble to hard currency is seriously deterring Western investors.\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) Foreign direct investment peeked at US$ 443.2 million in 1999 due to large investments by Russia’s Gazprom in the building the Yamal– Western Europe pipeline through Belarus, but fell to US$ 90 million in 2000. This low level is not surprising given the sluggish privatization process, the regular state interventions in private sector operations, the numerous price and wage controls and foreign trade restrictions. Apart from the Yamal–Western Europe pipeline, most FDI takes the form of joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned businesses. The major investors to date are coming from Germany (12.4%), the Netherlands (10.9%), Cyprus (6.9%), the US (6.6%), the UK (4.2%) and Poland (4.1%). Among the largest Western foreign investors in Belarus are Coca-Cola (US), Fresiniuss (Germany), McDonald’s (US) and MAN (Germany).\n\nFree economic and trade areas To attract foreign investment and promote trade and economic relations, the Belarus government has created free economic zones (FEZ) in the border town of Brest (December 1996), the capital, Minsk (March 1998), Gomel-Raton (March 1998) and Vitebsk (August 1999). FEZ residents enjoy low land rents, as well as several tax privileges, for example fiveyear tax exemption on profit growth from production, reduced profit taxes from 30% to 15%, VAT exemption for goods imported into and exported from the zone, VAT reduction from 20% to 10% otherwise, etc. In addition, FEZ residents should have the support for their investment from the central and local authorities, and these investments cannot be nationalized, requisitioned or confiscated. Belarus has also free trade agreements with other CIS states providing for zero import tariffs, but the future of these is not clear if some of its members join the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\n14 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nMajor trading partners In year 2000, Belarus imported US$ 8.5 billions’ worth of goods and exported US$ 6.1 billion. The major export partners in 2000 were Russia (51%), Ukraine (7.6%), Latvia (6.3%), Lithuania (6.1%), Poland (3.8%) and Germany (3.1%). The major import partners were Russia (65.3%), Germany (6.9%), Ukraine (4%), Poland (2.5%) and Italy (2%). Although a switch in Russian demand towards higher quality imports remains a concern to Belarusian producers, it is likely that Belarus will still have access to a niche market for low- or middle-quality products as long as regional and income disparities in Russia persist. In the absence of progress in large-scale privatization, restructuring or private sector growth, Belarusian producers will find it much easier to switch from one Russian region to another than to break into more competitive, non-traditional markets.\n\nForeign trade agreements Belarus has close economic and commercial ties with Russia. The two countries have signed numerous bilateral agreements and their parliaments even ratified an economic-union treaty in December 1999. The original schedule included the harmonization of price regulations in 2001, a unified tax code in 2002, a harmonized foreign trade and customs regime by 2005, and a monetary union by 2005. Despite this ambitious programme, overall progress in economic and political integration has been limited. Belarus is also a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). According to the free-trade agreement signed in 1992, import duties are in principle not imposed on trade within the CIS. However, the large number of export and foreign exchange controls, combined with the accumulation of arrears and the reliance on barter transactions, has significantly limited the benefits of this free-trade agreement. It should be noted that Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan signed a treaty setting up the Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC) in October 2000. The EAEC is a first step towards NAFTAstyle international policy agreements and the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements of the WTO has recognized it. Belarus is also currently engaged in negotiations for its accession to the WTO.\n\nValue added tax (VAT) Since January 2000, all legal entities are subject to VAT, which is calculated on the total value of the goods, including customs duty and excise\n\nBelarus 15\n\ntax where applicable. There are several VAT rates in force, varying from 0% (exports and transit via the territory of Belarus of goods and related services) and going up to 20% (most goods). It should be noted that the VAT is collected when goods and services are imported from CIS countries while goods and services exported to CIS countries are not taxed. Exceptions are Russia, Turkmenistan and Georgia, for which Belarus maintains the country of origin principle.\n\nTariff system On the import side, Belarus has a widespread and escalating importtariff structure, with a maximum rate at 150% (for vodka). However, the average rate for imports is 7.43%, which implies a moderate level of protectionism. A few quantitative import restrictions remain, in accordance with Articles XX and XXI of GATT. There are also preferential rates for developing countries (half of the most-favoured-nation rate) and least-developed countries (0%). On the export side, Belarus has tariffs, quotas and licensing requirements for a number of raw materials and intermediate goods. These are required to ensure a sufficient supply of goods for the domestic market, given that domestic prices are regulated and below the world market level.\n\nForeign trade regulations Virtually any import contract must be registered within 10 days with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, which issues an import certificate. Failure to register a contract may result in heavy fines, customs problems, and a bank refusal to make the corresponding payment. Importers must also ensure that they receive goods that they have paid for within 60 days of the due date. It should be noted that the state has a monopoly on several types of imports (e.g. pharmaceuticals, etc.). Any export activity requires permission from the competent authorities. Exporters must ensure they receive payment for the products they have exported within 60 days of the shipment date. Furthermore, all exporters are required to sell 30% of their hard currency earnings.\n\n1.7 Etiquette and cultural issues Belarus has a strong publishing and musical tradition, which goes back to the bibles printed in Eastern Europe, as well as several Orthodox hymns and sermons. After several years of persecution under Soviet occupation, the Belarusian cultural scene is now undergoing a revival. On the literature side, popular authors are Jakub Kolas and Natalla\n\n16 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nArseneva. In the world of music, Belarusian folk music is well known and the Minsk opera and ballet companies enjoy international reputations. Belarusians tend to be formal in business circumstances and are rarely effusive in public. Greetings are usually limited to a handshake and the pronouncement of one’s name, including between men and women. Only close friends or relatives will give a kiss on the cheek in public. Dinner invitations normally take place in restaurants. An invitation at someone’s home is a great honour and should always be accepted. In such a case, one should arrive bearing gifts, and eat and drink plentifully. Politics and economics are normally perfectly acceptable topics of conversation. Toasts are common practice at dinner and foreigners are expected to make at least one toast.\n\n2 Croatia\n\nHaving recently won its independence, Croatia has largely completed its transition from socialism to a market economy. The new government that took office in early 2000 has strengthened democratic institutions and opened up Croatia to closer integration with Europe.\n\n2.1 Basic facts Situated at the crossroads between Central Europe and the Mediterranean, the territory of Croatia spreads its 56,538 sq km in an arc, with a long Adriatic coastline forming the Western leg and the land between the rivers Drava and Sava forming the northern leg. Croatia shares a border with Slovenia in the northwest (670 km), Hungary in the north (329 km), Bosnia-Herzegovina in the south (932 km), Serbia (241 km) and Montenegro (25 km) in the southeast and Italy in the west (coastal border). The Danube is the eastern border with Serbia, while the rivers Sava and Drava form the southern and northern borders with BosniaHerzegovina and Hungary respectively. The terrain of Croatia is diverse. The eastern region of Croatia is mostly flatland, which is a part of the Panonian Plain. The northwest is mostly hills and river valleys, while central Croatia is the highest part of the country with Mount Velebit (1757 m) and Mount Dinara (1830 m). The Adriatic coast and its islands, islets and reefs make up the largest region of Croatia. It runs the entire length of the Western border, from the 430 km Istrian peninsula in the north to Dubrovnik in the south. As could be expected, the climate is also quite diverse: northern Croatia has a continental climate, central Croatia has a semi-highland and highland climate, and the Croatian coast has a Mediterranean climate. 17\n\n18 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nThe total population is just above 4.3 million inhabitants. The major ethnic group is Croats (78.1%). National minorities include Serbs (12.2%), as well as Muslims, Slovenes, Hungarians, Montenegrins, Albanians, Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, and others. The official language is Croatian, which is a Slavic language based on the Latin alphabet. Over three-quarters of the population is Roman Catholic, but most of the Serb minority follow Orthodox Christianity. The administrative, cultural, academic and communication centre of Croatia is the capital, Zagreb (0.73 million inhabitants). Other major cities are Split (0.2 million) and Rijeka (0.17 million). The official currency is the kuna (local symbol kn, international symbol HRK), which consists of 100 lipa (lp).\n\nMeans of communication After a decade of repression by the late president Franjo Tudjman and his associates, one could expect that the new political situation would have dramatically changed the media landscape in Croatia. Reality is somehow different: the new government does not want to abandon the idea and practice of controlling the media. After several years of discussions, the telecommunications law is still in draft form, so that potential investors do not want to invest. Almost half of the private television stations and one-third of the private radio stations have expired licences and operate in legal uncertainty. The new government owns and heavily subsidizes one national daily paper as well as the state television (the main source of information for almost two-thirds of the population). It allows them to practice a dumping policy on advertising at the expense of other private media. In addition, since April 2001, the government has imposed a value added tax (VAT) on newspaper returns, which is a new and substantial financial burden on publishers.\n\n2.2 Historical background Although Greek colonies were established along the Dalmatian coast in the fourth century BC, Croatia’s history as a united independent nation started in the ninth century, when Duke Tomislav became ruler of Croatian Dalmatia and united it with Slavonia. After his death, a series of civil wars weakened central authority and the Croats became subjects of the king of Hungary. In 1526, threatened by the Ottoman expansion, the region was added to the Habsburg Empire, where it remained until the end of World War I.\n\nCroatia 19\n\nIn October 1918, following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Croatian National Council took power in Zagreb and called for union with the other South Slavic regions of Austria-Hungary. The Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created. It regrouped countries with different traditions, religions, nations, languages and alphabets, including those from opposing sides during World War I, namely the Austro-Hungarian side (Slovenia, Croatia, Vojvodina, BosniaHerzegovina), Serbia and Montenegro. Its official aim was to organize the new state on a confederal basis and to preserve each country’s national identity and sovereignty. However, despite the stout resistance of the Croatian parliament, Serbian nationalists rapidly centralized the new kingdom under their control in an attempt to create a Greater Serbia. The Serbian police initiated a long period of persecution and terror against Croatian peasants and intellectuals, as well as Muslims. As an illustration, Stjepan Radi1, the leader of the opposition Croatian Peasant Party, was assassinated in the Yugoslav parliament in 1928, and in 1929, Belgrade made use of the world economic crisis to destroy the Croatian banking system, which was the strongest in Yugoslavia. The terror continued until the outbreak of World War II. After the military defeat of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941, despite security agreements with Britain and France, parts of Croatia were occupied by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, which brought about the formation of an independent state of Croatia. With the aim of creating ethnically pure Croatian territories, mass executions of Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies were organized in the infamous Jasenovac concentration camp. Not all Croats agreed with this policy and many joined the communist partisans in proclaiming a new Yugoslavia at Jajce (Bosnia) in 1943. By the time the war ended, about one million people had died in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 1945, communist partisans re-established a new Yugoslav Federation, substantially restoring the old borders of Bosnia and Croatia, but splitting Macedonia from Serbia and setting up two autonomous regions within Serbia. Yugoslavia’s new president was Marshall Josep Tito, a Croat born near Zagreb. In 1948, he rejected the Soviet dictatorship of Stalin, but retained a rigid communist system and tolerated his own personality cult. During his lifetime, Tito focused on suppressing any sign of ethnic nationalism, with all power to the multi-ethnic (in theory, non-ethnic) Yugoslav Communist Party. Furthermore, to prevent the domination of the country by any one republic, Tito established a rotating presidency,\n\n20 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nto come into effect on his death. Each of the six republics in turn, plus the two autonomous regions of Serbia, would have its representative as federal president for one year. This system achieved its primary goal, but also seriously weakened the presidency and accelerated the disintegration of the system after Tito’s death in 1990. The impact was not obvious until the leadership of the Serbian Republic adopted an openly nationalist policy in the late 1980s and severely repressed the Albanian majority in Serbia’s Kosovo province. This sparked fears that Serbia was trying to impose its rule on the rest of the federation. Croatia, which made by far the greatest contribution to the federal treasury, was the first to react. It virtually eliminated controls on the media before the end of 1988 and consented to multi-party elections won by Tudjman’s Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in 1990. As communist governments fell throughout Eastern Europe, Croats began agitating for autonomy. In December 1990, a new Croatian constitution was drawn up. It changed the status of Serbs in Croatia to a ‘national minority’ rather than a ‘constituent nation’ and did not guarantee their rights. Many Serbs lost their government jobs. In May 1991, a referendum produced a 93% vote in favour of independence, despite a boycott by the Serb population. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence from the Yugoslav Federation. Simultaneously, the Serbian enclave of Krajina declared its independence from Croatia. Heavy fighting broke out throughout the country and the federal army, dominated by Serb communists, intervened in support of the Serbs. In a few months, Serb militias and the federal army bombed the presidential palace in Zagreb and seized about one quarter of Croatia, including overland routes to the Dalmatian coast tourist sites, most of Croatia’s petroleum resources, and a section cutting the primary access route from Zagreb to Slavonia. The intervention of United Nations’ forces in January 1992 halted most of the fighting, but froze an unacceptable situation in Croatian eyes. Nevertheless, the federal army withdrew from Croatia and in May 1992 Croatia was admitted to the UN, after amending its constitution to protect minority groups and respect human rights. In January 1993, Croatia launched an attack on Krajina, which was still controlled by Serb paramilitary groups. Krajina responded by declaring itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and reducing its Croat population by nearly 98%. In 1994, Krajina signed a ceasefire but in May 1995 violence recurred. However, Krajina lost the support of Belgrade and Croatian forces flooded the area. Some 150,000 Serbs fled, many from towns where their ancestors had lived for centuries. In 1995, the Dayton\n\nCroatia 21\n\nAgreement finally put an end to the Yugoslav–Croat war and brought a sense of stability to the country, with Yugoslavia formally recognizing the borders of Croatia and establishing diplomatic relations. Under UN supervision the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998.\n\n2.3 Political environment Although the Republic of Croatia was officially established in 1991 as a constitutional parliamentary democracy, it was only in January 2000, after president Tudjman’s death, that new elections resulted in the victory of a six-party coalition effectively committed to democracy. Under the new president, Stjepan (Stipe) Mesi1, the constitution was significantly amended to reduce the powers of the presidency in favour of the parliament. It now outlines a clear separation of power between executive, legislative and judicial branches. Executive power is in the hands of the president, who is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and can only hold office twice consecutively. He is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, promulgates laws validly enacted by parliament and can refer them to the Constitutional Court on grounds of constitutionality. He also has the authority to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, who in turn names a Council of Ministers. Legislative authority is invested in a unicameral parliament (Hrvatski Sabor), of which the representatives are elected by popular vote for a four-year term. It has the power to pass laws, amend the constitution, adopt the state budget, exercise certain supervisory powers over the work of government ministries and declare war. The initial parliament coalition enjoyed a two-thirds’ majority in parliament and regrouped the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Croatia Social Liberal Party (HSLS), the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Istrian Democratic Party (IDS), the Liberal Party (LS) and the Croatian People’s Party (HNS). However, several political tensions have severely threatened the stability and effectiveness of the coalition government led by prime minister Ivica Racan (SPD). In particular, the extradition to the Hague Tribunal of two Croatian generals charged with war crimes led to a split in the HSLS, to the IDS leaving the coalition and to discontent among the far right parties. The programme of wage and job cuts at a time of high unemployment also sparked discontent among public sector unions. So far, the government has succeeded in managing the resulting political challenges, but the opposition Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has managed to establish itself as the second largest party\n\n22 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nbehind the SPD. As one gets closer to the 2004 parliamentary election and 2005 presidential election, further threats are likely to occur. However, since no party would benefit from an early election, the government’s coalition is likely to hold.\n\n2.4 Economic environment and infrastructure Macroeconomic tendencies Since independence in 1991, Croatia has faced the typical difficulties of a country in transition, along with the problems associated with regional conflicts. When the new coalition government was elected in early 2000, Croatia’s economy was severely affected by the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, the economic slowdown in Germany (then Croatia’s most important trading partner) and the country’s situation on the sideline of European and international structures. Since then a deepening reform process has succeeded in stimulating economic growth. Notwithstanding delays in policy implementation and a less favourable market environment, GDP rose 3.7% in 2000 and 3.8% in 2001, and inflation fell to 6.2% in 2000 and 3.6% in 2001. The restrictive monetary policy of the central bank resulted in a relative stability of the Kuna within a narrow range against the Euro. Bank deposits in both domestic and foreign currencies are higher – the introduction of the Euro in the 12 Euro zone countries caused a huge inflow of foreign exchange in Croatian banks and forced the central bank to intervene three times to shore up the Kuna against the Euro. In 2001, international currency reserves reached their highest level in five years at Euro 5,400 million. Consequently, the economy is being remonetized, interest rates have declined, and bank lending is surging. However, there are still areas of major concern. First, privatization and serious restructuring of companies, together with rigidities in the labour market, have fuelled Croatia’s unemployment rate – officially at 23% in early 2002. The government is now under considerable pressure to increase employment, even though this is likely to further delay certain necessary structural reforms. Second, the government still has difficulty in curbing public expenditure. Largely following the advice of the IMF, it has undertaken to slash its budget deficit below 4.25% of GDP in 2002, essentially by reducing subsidies, freezing public sector wages and rationalizing social transfers (e.g. pension funds and health insurance funds). However, the financing of the budget deficit is still heavily dependent on the proceeds from privatization. Third, the overall\n\nCroatia 23\n\nforeign debt burden is high (US$ 11.05 billion or 54% of GDP), partly inherited from the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the economic mismanagement and excessive spending of the previous government. By means of rigid belt-tightening measures, the government has been able to meet public debt settlement commitments, but the country still relies quite heavily on borrowing to finance its current-account deficit and amortize its arrears. However, insolvency risk is somehow reduced by high foreign-currency reserves, which encourage a rather favourable credit rating. In January 2002, Moody’s changed its outlook on Croatia’s Baa3/Ba1 foreign currency ceilings for bonds/deposits to stable from negative. On the positive side, between 2000 and 2001, industrial production increased by 6% (including 2% growth in the manufacture of transport vehicles), the manufacture of food and beverages increased by 5.8%, and the annual growth in retail trade turnover reached 9.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis. The IMF professed itself satisfied with Croatia’s performance and provided a significant endorsement of the government’s economic programme by granting Croatia a SDR 200 million (US$ 260 million) stand-by facility. The country is also one of the World Bank’s darlings with US$ 780 million committed and US$ 550 million disbursed (mostly on transportation infrastructure, urban development, and finance-related projects).\n\nIndustry Croatian manufacturing industry employs about 350,000 people, essentially in the textile, clothing and food industries. Other important industries are fabricated metals, chemical products (in particular alkaline and derivatives), wood products, electrical appliances, and shipbuilding.\n\nEnergy Croatia used to be a substantial energy producer, but it has yet to reach its pre-war levels of energy production and is now an energy importer. Liquid fuels (48.5%) and natural gas (26.1%) dominate the country’s primary energy consumption. The state-owned Croatian Oil and Gas Company (Industrija Nafte, INA) controls all activities related to exploration, production and transportation of natural gas as well as oil exploration, production, refining and most of marketing activities. INA supplies around two-thirds of the country’s crude oil consumption (including from fields operated in Angola, Egypt and Russia) and one-third of its gas consumption, the balance being imported from Russia and Slovenia. Recently, Croatia also reinforced its role as a transit country for gas and oil. There are\n\n24 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nmajor pipelines through Croatia, including the Adria pipeline. The latter belongs to the state-owned Adriatic Pipeline Company ( Jadranski Naftovod, JANAF) and runs from the Adriatic port of Omisalji eastward to Sisak, with branches to Hungary and Serbia. Several additional pipelines and extensions are currently being considered, including a connection to Yukos’s Druzhba pipeline that feeds Russian oil into Central Europe. Croatia is also attempting to increase its domestic production by developing gas fields in the northern Adriatic, through a joint venture with ENI of Italy. Founded in July 1990 by consolidating 119 different power entities, the state-owned Croatian Electricity Company (Hrvatska Elektroprivreda, HEP) carries out the activities of generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in the entire territory of Croatia. It also operates the national power system, which is very hydro-dependent. HEP owns a major hydroelectric plant (Varazdin) in the area near the Slovenian– Hungarian border and three others (Senj, Obrova, and Zakucac) in the area along the Adriatic coastline. Since the beginning of 2000, it has stopped utilizing electric power from the Russian designed Krsko nuclear plant in neighbouring Slovenia, although it did provide around 8% of Croatia’s power requirements. In July 2001, the Croatian parliament passed a set of laws liberalizing the energy sector in preparation for privatization, and also in compliance with European Union regulations. Consequently, the three energy monopolies INA, JANAF and HEP are slated to be split up and subsequently privatized in 2003. The privatization process should enable the creation of markets and competition by gradually opening the process of demonopolization. A short-term consequence should be a rise in energy prices but in the long run the open market will increase energy efficiency and, thus, lower energy prices.\n\nAgriculture Agriculture accounts for about 10% of Croatia’s GDP and plays a significant role in the Croatian economy. Approximately 63% of the 3.18 million hectares of agricultural land is cultivated; the remainder is pastureland. Agriculture is varied, reflecting the country’s geographical diversity. The main food crops are maize, barley, wheat, sugar beets, soybeans and potatoes. The leading meat products are pork, chicken, beef, turkey and horsemeat. There is also fish and tobacco, as well as olives, citrus fruit and grapes on the Adriatic coast. Unlike in other formerly communist countries, Croatian farmers were always able to retain private ownership of land, so that today more than 80% of the agricultural land is privately owned. However, there have\n\nCroatia 25\n\nalso been noticeable delays in implementing the necessary structural reforms and financial support has been inadequate. The agricultural sector is, therefore, still undergoing the transition to a market economy. Most of the family-owned farms are inefficient and too small to be economically viable. Consequently, farmers tend to group together to exploit the land. Two-thirds of the farms are operated on a part time basis, and 51% of Croatian farmers are over 50 years of age. The Croatian government had traditionally set pre-harvest guaranteed prices for agricultural products above world prices, resulting in a lack of competition. However, Croatia’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in autumn 2000 resulted in significant changes. The Croatian agricultural authorities are now committed to reducing customs protection, making significant reductions in tariffs and stopping export subsidies. This is likely to facilitate exports, but also to increase foreign competition in the sector. Croatia also has two million hectares of forests and woodlands, of which 76% is state-owned. Forestry and timber account for about 3% of GDP, employ 40,000 workers and earn the country US$ 350 million annually.\n\nFinancial sector Croatia has a two-tier banking system, in which the Croatian National Bank (CNB) acts as the central bank. The CNB is an independent institution whose prime goal is to ensure price stability through sound monetary policy. So far, its actions have had the full backing of the international financial institutions. The commercial banking sector is just emerging from heavy restructuring. In 1998, several banks came under great pressure from monetary tightening, a weakening economy, a depletion of repatriated savings, and a high share of non-performing assets on their balance sheets. This resulted in a lack of confidence among depositors, foreign investors, and ultimately in a liquidity crisis for the whole economy. The restructuring process had to initiate bankruptcy procedures against 12 banks and four savings banks and implied numerous mergers and acquisitions as well as foreign participation (foreign investors now control over 70% of bank assets.). It is now almost completed. As a result, the Croatian banking sector now consists of 44 commercial banks, including eight foreign banks. Given the small size of the economy, this might seem a large enough number for a competitive banking industry, but banking is extremely concentrated and the two largest banks control more than 50% of the total assets.\n\n26 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nDominated by banks and brokerages, the Zagreb Stock Exchange is quite rudimentary, with six companies listed on the official market and 56 on the OTC market. Most companies prefer the OTC market as it has less stringent listing requirements. Settlement takes place on a trade date plus five business days, and that there is no central clearinghouse. The Zagreb Money Market (ZMM) was set up in 1990 as an independent joint-stock company. It acts as a broker for inter-bank transactions. It should be noted that the Croatian government has embarked on a reform of the pension system, which is broadly based on the World Bank/Chilean model and fairly similar to the system applied in Poland. This reform has a start-up cost of US$ 2 billion and should help to stimulate the Croatian capital market.\n\nTelecommunications Croatia has a well developed telecommunications system, both in terms of equipment and penetration (35 lines per 100 inhabitants). Hrvatski Telekom (HT, majority owned by Deutsche Telekom) is the owner and operator of the physical network, which is 80% equipped with stateof-the-art main digital switches. Two GSM networks are available. HT introduced its CRONET GSM network in August 1995, while VipNet (majority owned by Mobilkom of Austria), became operational in the summer of 1999. The government might sell a third GSM and two UMTS licences before the end of 2002. There are also a few Internet service providers in Croatia, but HT’s Internet service (HINET) has a 95% market share. VipNet has recently entered this market and is expected to become a challenging competitor. Finally, Croatian Post (HP), a wholly owned government enterprise, provides fast and reliable postal services.\n\nTransportation and communications The war that ended in 1995 and the subsequent limited national budget severely affected Croatia’s transport system. The government set as a priority policy area the establishment of an efficient transport system and infrastructure. It targeted a large part of the loans approved so far by the World Bank and the EBRD for the reconstruction of roads, railroads, electricity and water supply network, as well as air-traffic control. Consequently, the Croatian transportation infrastructure is now fairly well developed by Central and Eastern European standards. The 27,840 km of hard-surfaced road network is extensive, but unevenly distributed. The northern and northwestern regions of the country enjoy a relatively good road network, while the eastern and southern\n\nCroatia 27\n\nregions are less developed. Furthermore, there are only 330 km of expressways, but an additional 1,600 km should be completed over the next 10 years. Due to the fiscal situation, the government plans to finance these strategic works mainly through foreign loans and concessions. Road traffic safety and reduction of road vehicle emissions are areas of concern. The Croatian railway network is 2,296 km long (983 km electrified) and is operated by Croatian Railways. Train transportation is usually inexpensive, reliable and safe, but quite slow since track network is mostly single line. Civil aviation traffic in Croatia is essentially handled by eight airports (Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Pula, Osijek, Rijeka, and Brac) and a few seasonal and sports airports. Croatia Airlines, the national company, played a critical role in helping Croatia to establish its international identity. There are plans to expand Zagreb Airport in anticipation of increased passenger traffic with the revival of the tourism sector. Finally, waterways are becoming an increasingly important mode of transport. About 800 km are perennially navigable, although downed bridges, silt, and debris still block large sections of the Sava River. Major ports in Croatia are Rijeka, Pula, Sibenik, Split, Ploce, Dubrovnik and Vukovar (inland waterways port on the Danube). The government is planning to expand and upgrade the coastal port facilities.\n\nTourism Prior to 1990, the tourism industry was one of the most important sectors of the Croatian economy. It accounted for about 6% of GDP, was one of Croatia’s main hard currency generators and employed directly or indirectly close to 200,000 people. The war that followed the dissolution of Yugoslavia devastated Croatia’s tourism sector and scared away foreign tourists. Direct war damage combined with the general lack of modern management and marketing skills and the use of tourism infrastructure to house refugees has left these facilities in desperate need of repair. Croatia has started to be recognized again as a desirable tourist destination. Despite capacity constraints, about 7.6 million tourists visited Croatia in 2001, including 6.4 million foreigners (25.3% Germans, 13.3% Slovenes, 12.2% Italians and 9.4% Austrians). In addition to the traditional hotel overnight stays, there has also been a trend towards self-catering and camping accommodation (which are particularly popular with visitors from other transition economies) and a strong growth of the marina sector (which reflects the relatively low cost of berthing\n\n28 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\npleasure boats in Croat ports). Croatia expects US$ 4.5 billion from tourism in 2002 (against US$ 3.6 billion in 2001) and has started to privatize several hotels and tourism companies and upgrade its tourism infrastructure.\n\n2.5 Legal environment and regulations In recent years, there have been considerable changes in Croatia’s legal environment and regulations. However, most of them were already pointing in the right direction, that is, towards a Western market economy system.\n\nCrime and corruption Under Tudjman’s government, corruption was widespread in Croatia. It ranged from bribes at each and any stage of business transactions to money laundering and large-scale siphoning-off of assets by politically connected cronies. It resulted in higher costs and prices and declining competitiveness. The new coalition government has made serious efforts to eliminate corruption. The implementation of a new legal and institutional framework to deal with corruption, organized crime and money laundering should bring the country closer to European standards in these fields. As a consequence, the Berlin-based Transparency International (TI) has recently upgraded Croatia’s ranking on the list of corrupt nations from 74th to 51st. However, bribery and corruption are still frequent in the health system and the judiciary.\n\nJudicial system, dispute settlement, and bankruptcy procedures The judicial system is still largely inherited from the former Yugoslavia. It consists of three levels of courts: municipal, county and Supreme Court. These courts exercise original jurisdiction over administrative, civil and criminal cases. In parallel, there are also eight commercial tribunals that deal specifically with commercial matters, including bankruptcy and economic crimes. Several reports have described the overall judicial system as cumbersome and inefficient due to bureaucratic inefficiency and political influence. In addition, the effective protection of property is weak, particularly in the case of illegal occupancy. The 1997 Bankruptcy Law established deadlines that force companies to initiate bankruptcy proceedings within 21 days of insolvency or overburdening. It also authorizes the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by creditors and regulates the reorganization procedures. However, in practice, the judicial process for liquidating assets has proven to be\n\nCroatia 29\n\nextremely slow and commercial tribunals face a heavy backlog of about one million unsolved or pending cases. Measures to strengthen the commercial courts’ capacity to settle bankruptcy procedures are now being funded by a World Bank loan.\n\nTaxation, accounting, and auditing rules The corporate profit tax in Croatia is covered by the Corporate Profit Tax Law, which is currently being updated. The corporate profit-tax rate is 20% of the accounting profit and is applicable to any business entity with a registered office in, or managed from, Croatia. Tax losses may be carried forward for five years. A 15% withholding tax is applied to dividends or interest payments, and a tax-credit system is used to avoid double taxation on foreign-source income. Several double-taxation treaties initially signed by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have been ratified by Croatia. The personal-tax rate is covered by the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Law, which is also currently being updated. Croatia taxes its residents on their worldwide income and its non-residents on their Croatian-source income only. There are currently three tax brackets with rates of 15%, 25% and 35%. Croatia also applies a 5% tax on gifts, inheritances, and property transfer. There are also numerous small taxes on selected business activities (e.g. tourism, gambling, motor vehicles, boats, etc.). It should be noted that the Investment Promotion Law promulgated in 2000 and the amended CPT Law passed by the Croatian parliament provide several tax benefits related to foreign investment in Croatia, particularly in (a) free-trade zones, (b) special state care areas and (c) the city of Vukovar. Croatia’s accounting law requires that financial statements (which comprise a profit and loss account, balance sheet, cash flow statement and notes) be prepared for each calendar year in accordance with international accounting standards. Consolidated financial statements are required for groups. The reporting frequency and disclosure requirements depend on whether a company is classified as small, medium or large. All large and medium-sized companies must be audited once a year in accordance with international standards on auditing by an authorized auditing firm. Smaller companies must submit to an abridged audit every three years.\n\nLaws on establishing and conducting business Provided the condition of reciprocity is met, foreign investors receive national treatment and enjoy the same rights, obligations, and legal status\n\n30 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nas domestic investors. The constitution guarantees the unrestricted repatriation of both profits and capital for foreigners.\n\nVarious forms of business organizations available to foreigners According to the Croatian Law on Commercial Companies, foreign investors may use a number of different forms of organization to conduct business and business-related activities in Croatia, including general partnerships (j.t.d.), limited partnerships (k.d.), limited liability companies (d.o.o.), joint-stock companies (d.d.), branch offices, and representative offices. A partnership is an entity through which two or more persons conduct ongoing entrepreneurial activities. In the general partnership, the liability of each of the partners to the creditors of the partnership is unlimited. In the limited partnership, the liability of one or several partners to the creditors is limited, while the responsibility of the remaining partners (at least one in number) is unlimited. A limited liability company or a joint-stock company is an entity organized to conduct small ongoing business activities. The liability to its creditors is limited to the total value of its property, while the liability of the participants in the company is limited to the value of their ownership interests in the company. Such companies may be founded and owned by a single person. Their ownership interest is divided into shares of stock, which are freely transferred and pledged. The minimum capital requirement is the HRK equivalent of DM 5,000 for the limited liability company and the HRK equivalent of DM 30,000 for the jointstock company (except for bank and insurance companies). Joint stock companies require the election of a supervisory board. A branch office must be entered in the commercial register at the commercial tribunal. It may conduct business and should keep account books in accordance with Croatian legislation. However, it is not considered an independent legal entity, but a part of the company that established it. A representative office must be entered in the Register of Representative Offices at the Ministry of Economy. It may be set up merely to investigate the local market, for advertising and marketing, but not for carrying out commercial activities. It must remain non-profitable and is not permitted to generate income. It does not have a legal personality and has no contractual status in its own right.\n\nRestrictions on foreign investments There are currently very few restrictions to foreign investments in Croatia. They essentially concern the sectors of military equipment,\n\nCroatia 31\n\ntelevision and radio stations, as well as fully foreign-owned rail or air transport.\n\nInvestment incentives The amended Corporate Profit Tax (CPT) Law of January 2001 prescribes general and specific incentives for foreign investments, for example partial or total write-off of equipment and business and/or tax reductions or exemptions.\n\nProtection of property rights Croatia has been a Member of WIPO since 8 October 1991 and is a signatory of the Paris and Berne Conventions. In May 2000, Croatia has ratified the 1996 WIPO ‘Internet’ treaties, the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT). Industrial Property Registers in Croatia consist of patents, trademarks, models and designs, geographical indications and semiconductor topology. However, in practice, the major threat to intellectual property rights is the inefficiency of the court system.\n\nEntry requirements Depending on one’s country of origin, an entry visa may be necessary to enter Croatia. Entry visas are issued for tourist, transit and business purposes. Foreign nationals willing to work in Croatia must first obtain a residence permit, and then a work permit. The latter is usually granted for one year and only if no Croatian national meeting the requirements of the employer is registered as being unemployed at the Croatian Institute of Employment.\n\n2.6 Business environment Privatization When the privatization process started in Croatia in 1991, it was almost considered as a social programme, that is as the free allocation of shares to the social classes that had been most affected by war. During 1991–99, more than 2,500 companies from all sectors were privatized, going mostly into the hands of privileged buyers (including managers and employees) who were granted considerable discounts and credit facilities. However, corruption and lack of controls resulted in large-scale asset stripping and inefficient management, while foreign investors were put off by the constantly changing regulations and the lack of transparency of the privatization process.\n\n32 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\nIn 2000, the new government revised the privatization process completely and affirmed its objectives of attracting foreign investors and improving the effectiveness of operations. In 2001, a 16% stake in the fixed-line telekom operator, Hrvatski Telekom, was sold to Deutsche Telekom for HRK 3.6 billion (US$ 430 m). Despite this, the government failed to achieve its privatization revenue target of HRK 4.5 billion for the year. The target for 2002 is more modest at HRK 2 billion. It should be easily achieved by privatizing the remaining stakes in banks, the dominant insurance company, Hrvatski Osiguranje, as well as several hotels on Croatia’s famous Adriatic coast. The government also established a framework for the privatization of key energy related industries (INA, HEP, JANAF).\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) Croatia had a mixed record in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), essentially because of the political instability of the past decade, as well as the obstructionist policies of the previous regime. The new government enacted active measures to welcome foreign investors, which significantly improved the investment climate. FDI in 2001 exceeded US$ 1.4 billion, which brought the total cumulative FDI to US$ 6.4 billion since 1993. According to the central bank, most FDI from 1993 through 2001 focused on telecommunications, banking, and manufacturing of pharmaceutical preparations. Over that period, and accounting for privatization stakes, Austria was the leading foreign investor in Croatia (US$ 1.5 billion), followed by Germany (US$ 1.16 billion).\n\nFree economic and trade areas Croatia currently has seven free-trade zones, located in Zagreb, Rijeka, Ploce, Pula, Split, Zadar and Vukovar. Any goods imported into these zones are free of customs duty. Any export from these zones to Croatia is subject to import customs duty. As a rule, companies that establish operations in a free-trade zone benefit from a 50% deduction on the corporate profit tax. If their investments in infrastructure are in excess of HRK 1 million, they receive a five-year tax exemption.\n\nMajor booming sectors Croatia’s principal growth sectors are construction, energy, tourism, transportation and telecommunications. Potential investors can invest in these sectors through the purchase of company shares from the state, from the privatization investment funds (PIFs), banks or other equity holders, or through direct investments in physical facilities.\n\nCroatia 33\n\nMajor trade partners (imports and exports) The EU countries are Croatia’s main trading partners (54.7% of exports, 56% of imports), with Italy in the lead (22.3% exports, 17% imports), followed by Germany (14.2% exports and 16.4% imports), Slovenia (10.8% exports and 7.9% imports), Austria (6.6% exports and 6.7% imports) and Russia (1.3% exports and 8.5% imports).\n\nFree trade agreements Croatia is interested in liberalizing trade as much as possible, especially in the area of industrial products. It has free trade agreements with Poland (CEFTA-member), Norway (EFTA and EEA member) and BosniaHerzegovina. It is also currently negotiating a free trade agreement with Yugoslavia, as well as bilateral agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey. At the beginning of 2002, more than three-quarters of the EU’s industrial goods exports to Croatia were duty free.\n\nForeign trade regulations Special permits need to be obtained for the import or export of certain goods, such as precious metals, military vehicles and weapons, and antiques.\n\nTariff system Croatia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2000. The Customs Tariff Law prescribes the rates of customs duty applicable to imported products. They are essentially ad valorem (percentage of the value), except for some specific agricultural products where a per quantity rule is applied. These rates apply to all countries, with the exception of tariffs that may be agreed upon in bilateral agreements. Excise duties are also levied for oil and oil derivatives, alcoholic beverages, automobiles, tobacco and coffee.\n\nValue added tax (VAT) Since January 1998, Croatia has replaced its sales tax by a value added tax (VAT) system. The uniform (and comparatively high) VAT rate is 22% and is applicable to all deliveries of goods and services performed in Croatia, as well as to personal consumption, new buildings and the importation of goods. There are a few exempted goods and services, for example medical and banking services, bread, milk, educational literature and social welfare. Exports are zero-rated. Croatia also applies a\n\n34 Doing Business in Emerging Europe\n\n30% tax on luxury goods and services (based on the sales price of the good, exclusive of VAT).\n\n2.7 Etiquette and cultural issues Culture Croats tend to be quite formal about business protocols. It is customary to shake hands, to address people by their surname and to exchange business cards immediately after formal introductions. Attention should be paid to academic titles, and any political or war related topics should be carefully avoided, since these are particularly sensitive subjects among Croatians. Use of the term ‘Serbo-Croatian’ to describe the Croatian language should also be avoided. It could be considered as an attack on the identity of the Croatian language, and, by the same token, as an attack on the identity of the Croatian people.\n\n3 Czech Republic\n\n3.1 Basic facts With a population of more than 10 million, strategically located in Central Europe, the Czech Republic, with its capital, Prague, is bordered by Germany in the west (646 km), Poland in the north (658 km), Slovakia in the east (215 km) and Austria in the south (362 km). This relatively small, landlocked country, with a total of 78,866 sq km, contains some of the most significant land routes in Europe. The country’s Moravian Gate is a traditional military corridor between the North European Plains and the Danube in Central Europe. As of July 2000, the population growth rate was an estimated negative 0.08%. Approximately 70% of the population is between the ages of 15 and 64, and the ratio of male to female within that age group is one to one. Ethnic Czechs make up a large majority of the population (81.2%), while the remainder of ethnic groups consists of Moravians (13.2%), Slovaks, Poles, Germans, Silesians, Romanians,"
