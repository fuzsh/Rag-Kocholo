        "text": "“Vrata Splita”, translated to “Split doors”, is a photographic project showing Split through an especially unique way: through the various building doors throughout the city of Split.\n\nAn idea that came to fruition back in February of this year, father-daughter duo Gojko and Tei Radić felt inspired by the many Instagram profiles that existed and were similar to what is now “Vrata Splita”. Because walking the streets of Split is always a treasure trove of raw beauty, ancient history, and a new age, Tei and Gojko felt that Split was the perfect recipient to create a project like this of their own.\n\nGojko, Tei’s father, is in charge of taking the photos, while daughter Tei is in charge of publishing the photos onto their Instagram account. How to do they pick what they want to capture? Surely, it’s what catches the eye.\n\nImages by Vrata Splita\n\nThus far, this creative duo has captured everything from the gate of Diocletian’s palace, the “golden door”, the fish market, cinemas, and even various homes throughout the city.\n\nIn an effort to stop chasing through life as much and to stop, smell the roses, and capture the beauty all around you, Split really does have a lot to charm to offer – and through “Vrata Splita” you can see Split through a totally different light.\n\nYou can follow the official Instagram account here.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
