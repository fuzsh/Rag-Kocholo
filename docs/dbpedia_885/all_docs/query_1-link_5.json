Such symbols often bear strong political and other messages. Inclusion of those symbols here does not mean that the author supports or approves of the ideas they may stand for. This site is harvested for the NSK digital archives.\n\nCroatia - Other Flags\n\nAutocesta Rijeka-Zagreb d.d.

The selection of those flags is somewhat arbitrary and if you believe that some other flags should be here, please let me know. Some of the flags here are not specifically Croatian, i.e. they are internationally adopted, recognized or used.\n\nSee also:\n\nCroatia\n\nAutocesta Rijeka-Zagreb d.d.\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: about 1995 ?\n\nSources: author's observation\n\nwww.arz.hr 10.01.2005.\n\nThe flag of the company holding concession on the most frequent highway connecting the main Croatian port of Rijeka with the capital is yellow, vertically hoisted with the company logo in the middle and the name printed black beneath. The logo consists of stylized highway roads with a tunnel and a turnpike in green and blue lined white. (There is indeed large number of tunnels on that road.)\n\nThe flag is as a rule hoisted on each toll booth stations along the highway.\n\nCivil Defence\n\n1:2~\n\nAdopted: ca. 1990\n\nThe flag is orange with blue equilateral triangle in the middle pointing upwards. This complies with the international agreements and Geneva conventions on the Civil Defence symbols.\n\nCroatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR)\n\nHrvatska banka za obnovu i razvitak, HBOR\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: about 1995\n\nSource: HBOR www.hbor.hr 20.02.2005\n\nThe flag of HBOR is white with a grey pentagram field (similar to much enlarged red square) containing initials of the Bank and a red square rotated 45 degrees and in the base full name of the Bank. HBOR was established by law in 1992 as \"Hrvatska kreditna banka za obnovu\" (Croatian credit bank for reconstruction; new name since 1995.) fully owned of the state, to help with the reconstruction of the war destroyed regions and for the development of economy especially in those regions that are underdeveloped.\n\nCroatian Mountaineering Association (HPS)\n\nHrvatski planinarski savez\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: 1991\n\nSources: Hrvatski planinarski savez, www.hps.hr, 26.08.2014.\n\nStatut Hrvatskog planinarskog saveza, 26.05.2007.\n\nThe flag of the Croatian Mountaineering Association is light blue with the association emblem in the centre. The emblem shows stylized peak of the Klek mountain and an edelweiss flower within a red ribbon iscribed with the association's name tied in the base with a blue ribbon inscribed with initials HPD (Hrvatsko planinarsko drutvo, the original name) and the establishment year 1874. The association was renamed in 1948 to Planinarski savez Hrvatske and in 1991 to the current name. The original emblem was similar, in different artistic style and without the mountain shape, showing only the eddelweiss within the ribbon.\n\nThe flags in use are either vertical or horizotal, with varying shades of light blue. The colouring of the ribbon with inscription HPD seems to more often be white.\n\nCroatian Mountain Rescue Service (HGSS)\n\nHrvatska gorska sluba spaavanja\n\n1:2 | 2:3~\n\nAdopted: 1991\n\nSources: Hrvatska gorska sluba spaavanja, www.gss.hr, 26.08.2014.\n\nHrvatski planinarski savez, www.hps.hr, 26.08.2014.\n\nThe flag of the Croatian Mountain Resuce Service, a state funded volunteer organization for rescue in mountains, cave and like, is vertical blue with the service emblem in the centre. The emblem is golden outlined white disk with a red cross trhoughout enbsigned with a golden outlined white eddelweis flower, all bordered with a golden edged blue ring inscribed with the service name. The flag is used also in the horizontal version.\n\nThe Service also uses a special flag for use in the field i.e. in their operations that has better visibility - an orange flag with the Service emblem above the white inscirption in English \"RESCUE\".\n\nThe Service was established in 1950 within then Mountaineering Assiciation of Croatia. It used the same emblem in only slightly different artistic stylization with inscription \"Gorska sluba spaavanja - P.S.H.\" It is not confirmed that it used any flag prior to 1990's.\n\nCroatian Olympic Committee\n\nHrvatski olimpijski odbor\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: 10th September 1993\n\nSource: Pravilnik o zastavi i znaku Hrvatskog olimpijskog odbora, br. 1191, Zagreb 1993.; Hrvatski olimpijski odbor http://www.hoo.tel.hr/hoo 1999.\n\nThe flag of the Olympic Committee conforms to the regulations set by the International Olympic Committee for the national committees' flags, being a white flag with the national committee emblem in the middle. The emblem of the COC consist of the Olympic rings above six red squares reminding on the coat of arms of Croatia, all set on a red bordered white shield with the name of the Committee in blue in base. This is the official flag, but the de facto flag is used much more often.\n\nCroatian Olympic Committee, de facto flag\n\n1:2\n\nIn use: since 1991\n\nSource: author's observation in multiple occasions; flag hoisted dayly on HOO headquarters in Zagreb\n\nThe de facto flag uses only the central part of the emblem - rings and squares, omitting the rest. It was told that this is the first proposal of the emblem which was rejected by the IOC due to their regulations requiring the size of the rings to be less the 1/3 of the total area of the symbol (or something of the sort). After the rejection, the new emblem as shown above was adopted; however the originally proposed flag remained in practical use apparently without intention of replacing it.\n\nCroatian Red Cross\n\nHrvatski crveni kri\n\n~ | 1:1 | 2:3 | 1:2\n\nAdopted: 9th November 1991\n\nSources: Zakon o Crvenom kriu, 9. 11. 1991\n\nFrançois Bugnion: \"Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal\", International Committee of the Red Cross, May 2007, www.icrc.org\n\n\"Draft Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem (Protocol III)\", Geneva, 12 October 2000.\n\n\"The Emblems of Humanity\", International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, www.ifrc.org\n\n\"Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal Emblems - Design Guidelines\", June 2006, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, www.ifrc.org\n\nThe Croatian law on Red Cross defines and ensures protection to the flag of the Croatian red cross society that is member of the International Committee of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. It is, of course, the internationally recognized Red Cross flag.\n\nThe emblem and the flag of the Red Cross were defined with the Geneva Conventions of 1864 and further amendments, while the details of drawing - consrtuction of the cross were deliberately left undefined (so that a party in armed conflict could not misuse the determinations). The current regulations on the emblem and flag are \"Regulations on the use of the Emblem of the Red Cross or the Red Crescent by the National Societies\" adopted on the 20th Red Cross and Red Crescent International Conference in Vienna, 1965 and revised on the Delegates Council in Budapest 1991. Article 5 of the Regulations describe the emblem so on white background a red \"cross formed with two cross-pieces, one vertical and the other horizontal crossing in the middle\". The emblem of Red Crescent enjoys the same protection while its \"shape and direction of the crescent are not regulated. Neither the cross nor the crescent shall touch the edges of the flag or the shield. The shade of the red is not specified. The ground shall always be white.\" Also, the ratio of with to length of the flag is not regulated. In the international surroundings, due to tradition, it is usual that the emblem of the Red Cross is displayed of the same dimensions as the cross in the flag of Switzerland (in transposed colours, since that is also the origin of the emblem), however, that does not prevent or limit other designs conforimg with the above descriptions. The flag ratio in the international events is usually square shaped, following the Swiss model of square flags, but other ratios and also acceptable - so that the flags produced in rations euqal to the ratios of the local national flag are usual (so in Croatia it would be 1:2).\n\nThe national organizations, in accordance to Art. 7 of the same Regulations may prescribe dimensions and proportions of the emblem for \"indicative use\" (i.e. for logo consistency within the organization), but that does not mean that the general flag is not acceptable.\n\nIn Croatia, the Red Cross emblem is often shown so that it is composed of five squares, in a white flag in overall ratio 1:2.\n\nThe IFRC prefers the emblem fo the cross 66 units long and 20 units wide, in the flag of 100×150 units.\n\nExcept the Red Cross and the Red Crescent emblems, in accordance to the Geneva Conventionas, an equally valid emblem is the emblem of the Red Lion and Sun, that was in use in Iran until 1980, but is now made obsolete for the Red Crescent emblem. In some countries with mixed population a combined (\"double\") emblem of the corss and crescent is used, without consent of the international organization. In Israel, the Red Shield of David (Magen David Adom) is used, that was not approved by the International Committee as a new symbol in the sense of the Geneva conventions. The issue was finally resolved with the adoption fo the, so called, Protocol III, in December 2005, introducing a new emblem of \"Red Crystal\" (actually it is a red voided lozenge - rotated square), a equally valid to crescent and cross, to be used by those organizations who do not want ot one one of the two previous symbols. The Propocol III introduces a new flexibility of the Crystal emblem, since in its center one of the emblems the ICRC recognizes may be set (i.e. the cross, the crescent, the double emblem of cross and crescent and the shield of David).\n\nCroatian Red Cross, National Society\n\nNacionalno drutvo Hrvatski crveni kri\n\n~1:2\n\nIn use: since 1991\n\nSource: Statut Hrvatskog Crvenog kria, 22.03.2016, NN 56/2016, 17.06.2016.\n\nThe national society as organization has flag to indicate the individual society. It is white, rectangular or square, with the Red Cross emblem in the centre. The name of the national society is inscribed either along the bottom in the lower third of the flag, or, as it is almost exclusivly seen in practice, circularly around the central emblem within two concentric circles. The inscription may include names in other languages as well.\n\nCrosco, d.o.o.\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: about 1991 ?\n\nSources: author's observation\n\nwww.crosco.com 10.01.2005.\n\nThe company specialized for oil drilling and research in the INA group maintains platforms around the world. The flag is red with the company logo in the middle.\n\nCultural Monument\n\n2:3~\n\nIn use: since 1990\n\nA flag that was hoisted (usually vertically) on buildings and other objects of special cultural importance (protected by UNESCO and similar) to prevent devastation of these under conditions of war, typically, used on museums, churches and other buildings of cultural heritage, was white with blue UNESCO symbol of cultural monument (down-pointing pentagram per saltire blue and white) and in lower part inscription \"SPOMENIK KULTURE\" (Cultural monument).\n\nFINA  The Financial Agency\n\nFinancijska agencija\n\n(1) 1:2\n\n(2) 1:2\n\nAdopted: 2006\n\nSource: author's observation\n\nThe flag is very dark blue with the white logo of the Agency set along the very bottom of the flag. The flag is printed, so that the reverse includes the logo along the oposite edge rotated 180°, often visible through semitransparent flag sheet. The logo consists of inscripotion Fina using a sans-serifed font with 9 rectangles ot the left of the letter F, each gradually being thinner then the previous.\n\nFINA is the main company in the financial mediation, owned by the state dealing with the public finances. It has been established in 2002 by the reform of the state owned Institute for Payment Transactions (Zavod za platni promet, ZAP), and the older Social Accounting Service (Sluba drutvenog knjigovodstva, SDK). The SDK was the organization in the socialist period that enjoyed the exclusive right in the former state to perform payment transactions within the country. In 1993 it was transformed into ZAP and gradually the state removed the monopoly in the transactions. FINA has offices in all cities around the county (over 180 offices).\n\nHrvatska elektroprivreda d.d.\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: about 1991\n\nSources: author's observation\n\nwww.hep.hr 10.01.2005.\n\nThe company runs the power plants and electric transfer systems. The logo of the company consists of a square divided with a symbols white thunderbolt into red and blue parts. The flag is, however, consisting of this logo within a white border, but with the blue part enlarged so that it fill out the rest of the flag. In that blue part in the lower fly is the company \"cipher\", white outlined letters HEP.\n\nHrvatska pota d.d.\n\nHrvatska pota d.d.\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: about 1999 ?\n\nSources: author's observation\n\nwww.posta.hr 10.01.2005.\n\nThe postal service was recently divided from previous joint company with the telecom. It is using a flag over the post offices countrywide: yellow (yellow being traditional postal colour in this region of the world) with black logo in the middle and the company name beneath it. The logo is a (much) stylized postal horn.\n\nHrvatske ceste, d.o.o.\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: about 1991\n\nSource: Hrvatske ceste d.o.o. http://www.hc.tel.hr/ 30.10.2002\n\nThe state enterprise for managing, building and maintaining of the public roads uses a yellow flag with the company logo in green in the middle. It is mostly to be seen at the high-ways toll stations.\n\nHrvatske ume, d.o.o.\n\nHrvatske ume, d.o.o.\n\n1:2\n\nAdopted: about 1991\n\nSource: Hrvatske ume, d.o.o. http://www.hrsume.hr 30.10.2002\n\nThis company developed from the state owned enterprise for managing forest and forest lands in the Republic of Croatia. The logo consists of the Croatian shield that extends over the outlines of two trees representing broadleaved and coniferous tree species. Is it set in the Croatian tricolour of which the central white stripe is made considerably wider.
