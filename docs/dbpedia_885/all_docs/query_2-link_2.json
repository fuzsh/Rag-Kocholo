        "text": "What is art and who is it for?\n\nCroatian artist Ana Šerić created BITE ART, authentic artistic pepper cookies of refined taste, handcrafted and wrapped in an interactive package. The package, after the treat has been consumed, transforms into a picture frame containing 4 reproductions of renowned Croatian artists each.\n\nThe first collection of this socially engaged project saw the works of artists belonging to a younger generation – Ana Kolega, Hrvoje Majer, OKO and Marko Tadić, as well as masterpieces of the eminent older Croatian artists Ivan Rabuzin and Vlaho Bukovac. BITE ART is a follow-up to Ana Šerić’s artistic career focused on edible art, by which she brings forth the irony of today’s art consumption by asking the questions “What is art?” and “Who is it for?”\n\nBITE ART is a sophisticated product with the goal to promote Croatian art and bring it to a wider audience. As a product, BITE ART can serve as a perfect corporate or diplomatic gift or souvenir, while it can also be used as a decoration in smaller spaces. The branding and design of the BITE ART package is signed by Izvorka Jurić’s Design Bureau, and they gracefully convey the background and mood of the artist’s work, as well as Ana Šerić’s original concept. She, however, with its very title, celebrates and benevolently mocks art at the same time.\n\nAt the moment it is available on the project’s Facebook page, and also in the Take me home design shop (Tomićeva street, Zagreb).\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
