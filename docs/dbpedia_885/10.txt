Here is a selection of flags used in Croatia that could not be included in other sections, but are seen in Croatia (relatively) frequently. The selection of those flags is somewhat arbitrary and if you believe that some other flags should be here, please let me know. Some of the flags here are not specifically Croatian, i.e. they are internationally adopted, recognized or used.

The association was renamed in 1948 to Planinarski savez Hrvatske and in 1991 to the current name. The original emblem was similar, in different artistic style and without the mountain shape, showing only the eddelweiss within the ribbon.

The flags in use are either vertical or horizotal, with varying shades of light blue. The colouring of the ribbon with inscription HPD seems to more often be white.

The Service was established in 1950 within then Mountaineering Assiciation of Croatia. It used the same emblem in only slightly different artistic stylization with inscription "Gorska sluba spaavanja - P.S.H." It is not confirmed that it used any flag prior to 1990's.

Croatian Olympic Committee, de facto flag

In use: since 1991

Source: author's observation in multiple occasions; flag hoisted dayly on HOO headquarters in Zagreb

The de facto flag uses only the central part of the emblem - rings and squares, omitting the rest. It was told that this is the first proposal of the emblem which was rejected by the IOC due to their regulations requiring the size of the rings to be less the 1/3 of the total area of the symbol (or something of the sort). After the rejection, the new emblem as shown above was adopted; however the originally proposed flag remained in practical use apparently without intention of replacing it.

Croatian Red Cross

Hrvatski crveni kri

~ | 1:1 | 2:3 | 1:2

Adopted: 9th November 1991

Sources: Zakon o Crvenom kriu, 9. 11. 1991

François Bugnion: "Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal", International Committee of the Red Cross, May 2007, www.icrc.org

"Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal Emblems - Design Guidelines", June 2006, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, www.ifrc.org

The Croatian law on Red Cross defines and ensures protection to the flag of the Croatian red cross society that is member of the International Committee of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. It is, of course, the internationally recognized Red Cross flag.

The emblem and the flag of the Red Cross were defined with the Geneva Conventions of 1864 and further amendments, while the details of drawing - consrtuction of the cross were deliberately left undefined (so that a party in armed conflict could not misuse the determinations). The current regulations on the emblem and flag are "Regulations on the use of the Emblem of the Red Cross or the Red Crescent by the National Societies" adopted on the 20th Red Cross and Red Crescent International Conference in Vienna, 1965 and revised on the Delegates Council in Budapest 1991. Article 5 of the Regulations describe the emblem so on white background a red "cross formed with two cross-pieces, one vertical and the other horizontal crossing in the middle". The emblem of Red Crescent enjoys the same protection while its "shape and direction of the crescent are not regulated. Neither the cross nor the crescent shall touch the edges of the flag or the shield. The shade of the red is not specified. The ground shall always be white." Also, the ratio of with to length of the flag is not regulated. In the international surroundings, due to tradition, it is usual that the emblem of the Red Cross is displayed of the same dimensions as the cross in the flag of Switzerland (in transposed colours, since that is also the origin of the emblem), however, that does not prevent or limit other designs conforimg with the above descriptions. The flag ratio in the international events is usually square shaped, following the Swiss model of square flags, but other ratios and also acceptable - so that the flags produced in rations euqal to the ratios of the local national flag are usual (so in Croatia it would be 1:2).

The national organizations, in accordance to Art. 7 of the same Regulations may prescribe dimensions and proportions of the emblem for "indicative use" (i.e. for logo consistency within the organization), but that does not mean that the general flag is not acceptable.

In Croatia, the Red Cross emblem is often shown so that it is composed of five squares, in a white flag in overall ratio 1:2.

The IFRC prefers the emblem fo the cross 66 units long and 20 units wide, in the flag of 100×150 units.

Except the Red Cross and the Red Crescent emblems, in accordance to the Geneva Conventionas, an equally valid emblem is the emblem of the Red Lion and Sun, that was in use in Iran until 1980, but is now made obsolete for the Red Crescent emblem. In some countries with mixed population a combined ("double") emblem of the corss and crescent is used, without consent of the international organization. In Israel, the Red Shield of David (Magen David Adom) is used, that was not approved by the International Committee as a new symbol in the sense of the Geneva conventions. The issue was finally resolved with the adoption fo the, so called, Protocol III, in December 2005, introducing a new emblem of "Red Crystal" (actually it is a red voided lozenge - rotated square), a equally valid to crescent and cross, to be used by those organizations who do not want ot one one of the two previous symbols. The Propocol III introduces a new flexibility of the Crystal emblem, since in its center one of the emblems the ICRC recognizes may be set (i.e. the cross, the crescent, the double emblem of cross and crescent and the shield of David).
