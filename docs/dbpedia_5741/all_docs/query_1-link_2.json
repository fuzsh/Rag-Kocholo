Johnston responded to an ad looking for a storyboard artist at college, which turned out to be for George Lucas's Lucasfilm Ltd. company. Johnston began working at the company, eventually promoted to a head storyboard position that frequently teamed him with Lucas in the editing room. Johnston later referred to working for Lucas as the best film school he could ever have when he watched Lucas do the editing for the original trilogy. Eventually, Johnston became disillusioned with his job and decided to leave Lucasfilm with his earnings to travel the world. But Lucas had other ideas when Johnston came to leave his notice. Lucas advised Johnston that he move him to the front line of applicants of his alma mater University of Southern California's Film School with Lucas paying for his tuition and keeping him on at half salary. Johnston said he didn't think twice when accepting Lucas' proposal, which he did in 1984.\n\nDuring pre-production for Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, Johnston was responsible for the design of Boba Fett's distinctive armor and equipment. He worked alongside artist Ralph McQuarrie to develop the unique look for the bounty hunter, which was in fact derived from the early concepts of Darth Vader.\n\nJohnston played an Imperial gunner and a backpacked spacetrooper in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, and in that costume he was made into a Hasbro action figure in 2009.[1]\n\nIn July 2011, Johnston stated that he was \"trying to get George [Lucas] to make a feature based on Boba Fett.[source?]\n\nStar Wars works[]\n\nFilm and TV[]\n\nStar Wars: Episode IV A New Hope (1977) (uncredited role as an Imperial gunner, effects illustrator and designer: miniature and optical effects unit)\n\nStar Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back (1980) (uncredited role as Shawn Valdez, art director visual effects)\n\nStar Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi (1983) (art director visual effects)\n\nCaravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) (production designer)\n\nEwoks: The Battle for Endor (1985) (production designer)\n\nStar Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO — \"Coby and the Starhunters\" (1985) (co-writer)\n\nFrom Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga (1985) (interviewed)\n\nStar Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO — \"The Great Heep\" (1986) (design consultant)\n\nEmpire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy (2004) (interviewed)\n\nThe 100 Greatest Family Films (2005) (interviewed)\n\nPublications[]\n\nThe Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense (1984) (writer)\n\nThe Star Wars Sketchbook (writer & illustrator)\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back Sketchbook (writer & illustrator)\n\nReturn of the Jedi Sketchbook (writer & illustrator)\n\nOther Lucasfilm projects[]\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (art director: visual effects, ILM)\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) (art director: California)\n\nHoward the Duck (1986) (ultralight sequence design)\n\nWillow (1988) (associate producer)\n\nThe Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (1993) (director of \"Princeton, February 1916\" episode)\n\nSources[]\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]\n\nJoe Johnston Sketchbook\n\nJoe Johnston on Wikipedia"
