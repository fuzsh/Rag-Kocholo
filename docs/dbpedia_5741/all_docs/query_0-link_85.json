        "text": "Last Updated March 4, 2002\n\nPlease send new information and corrections\n\nto James Hague (email: james [at] dadgum.com)\n\nThis is a Who's Who of classic game programmers, where \"classic\" generally refers to \"8-bit\" (Apple II, Atari 2600, Atari 800, Commodore 64, etc). I originally stuck to \"one person, one vision\" games, as that is what is most interesting to me, but I eventually decided to include ports as well (though undoubtedly ports carry less weight). When a game was released for multiple, similar platforms, I only listed the version the programmer originally developed. Games for modern platforms are mentioned only when the programmer has written at least one classic title. There are a lot more gray areas as well, and I tried to deal with them as best I can.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to send comments, corrections, and new information.\n\nFormat:\n\nThe list is arranged alphabetically by last name. Games written are listed chronologically in the following format:\n\nTitle, co-authors (year of release, system, publisher)\n\nQuestion marks indicate things that I am not 100% sure of. I used them liberally, so as not to propagate incorrect information. Bracketed entries contain biographical notes.\n\nSystem codes:\n\nPublisher codes (to save space):\n\nAI - Adventure International (also AI UK) ACT - Activision APX - Atari Program Exchange (run by Atari, Inc.) BROD - Broderbund EA - Electronic Arts ASIM - Automated Simulations (precursor to Epyx)\n\nGames may be preceded by the following special codes:\n\n* Four-star game, using a rather conservative TV Guide style rating system (a judgement call, I realize; I may stop doing this). [P] Programmer only. Used for games ported from other formats or when a game was designed by someone else--implies a lack of creative control. [D] Designer only. [B] Game written in BASIC. Might be interesting, as there is usually a quality gap between BASIC games and those written in other languages. [G] Group effort; the person mentioned had some sort of involvement. [L] Leader of a group effort; implies more than management. [T] Type-in program from a magazine. [N] Non-game software. [U] Unreleased product.\n\nList Begins Here\n\nAaron, Robert [G] The Lion's Share (1983, AP2, Davka) The Philistine Ploy, with Alan Rosenbaum (1983, AP2, Davka) Abbott, Mike Teleport, with Jim Nitchals (1982, AP2, Cavalier Computer) Hard Hat Mack, with Matt Alexander (1983, AP2, EA) Abbott, Shaun D.
