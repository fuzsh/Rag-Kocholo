        "text": "It's been almost 30 years, but if you're a '90s kid, there are still few movies that take you back to your childhood like Jumanji. Directed by Joe Johnston and starring Robin Williams, the fantasy adventure was a hit upon its release back in 1995, and admiration for it has only grown in all the years since.\n\nBut where did this whole story start? Did the film about a board game that comes to life with each roll of the dice have its roots in something real? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWhat is Jumanji Based On?\n\nJumanji tells the story of Alan Parrish (Williams), a man who was sucked into the title board game as a boy after he found it buried at a construction site and attempted to play it. Years later, Alan returns when two kids (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce) find the game and try to play it themselves, unleashing a new jungle adventure on their town with each turn. It is, at its core, a very simple idea, and it's easy to imagine the creators of Jumanji basing the story on a board game they played themselves, albeit one without sudden stampedes and spider attacks.\n\nRELATED: Everything You Didn't Know About Jumanji\n\nThe film itself, as anyone who paid attention during the credits will know, is not based on a real board game. Instead it's based on a children's book of the same name, with the same concept, written by Chris Van Allsburg and released in 1981. Van Allsburg even has a story credit on the final film, beyond his contribution of the source material, because he helped come up with new story elements for the big-screen version of his tale. But what about the book? Is it based on a board game?\n\nUnless Van Allsburg is hiding some secret jungle board game somewhere in his past, the answer is no. Jumanji is a tale the author dreamed up by himself, without any direct correlation to a real board game. That said, the name of the game does have some interesting roots. According to Van Allsburg, it's a Zulu word that means \"many effects.\" The \"many effects\" are, of course, a reference to all the different things that could happen to you depending on how you roll the dice in Jumanji.\n\nThe Jumanji Legacy\n\nPhoto: Jumanji (8/8) Movie CLIP - Jumanji (1995) HD/Movieclips YouTube\n\nSo, Jumanji is not directly based on any one real board game (that we know of), but it did actually give birth to a real board game along the way. In 1995, a tie-in game was released for home play (actual jungle animals and big game hunters not included), which represented just one part of the film's impact.\n\nAfter it became one of the top-grossing films of the 1995, Jumanji's pop culture impact just kept expanding, giving rise to an animated series which ran from 1996-1999, the spinoff film Zathura (featuring the same concept, but in space), and of course, the reboot movies Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Jumanji: The Next Level. Throw in merchandise, theme park rides, and more, and you've got a franchise."
