        "text": "Ahead of the new Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, the team over at Screen Junkies is here with a blast from the past: The Honest Trailer for Joe Johnston’s original Jumanji movie takes us back to 1995, when Robin Williams was still alive and the movies (and the world) were better for it. The film stars Williams as Alan Parrish, a kid who became trapped in a magical board game for decades, only to be freed as an adult when two orphans find the box. Now back in the real world, he must finish the game and learn to let go of his childhood—making Jumanji basically “Hook, but in reverse.”\n\nAs the Honest Trailer points out, the whole thing’s a lot darker than we remembered, with plenty of legitimately frightening scares and way more PTSD than you’d expect from a family film. Still, Jumanji succeeds where so many others have failed and figures out the formula for how to make a good board-game movie: “Base it on a made-up game from a book, filled with characters you actually care about … and always cast Robin Williams.”"
