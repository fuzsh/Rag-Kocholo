I explore the many faces of the Weird War genre in films, television, novels, pulps, comic books, animation and games. The supernatural, science fiction, and fantasy themes are primarily concentrated within a framework of historical wars, with subjects that include the Trojan War, crusades, English civil War, American revolutionary War, napoleonic Wars, American civil War, World War I and II, Spanish civil War, Korean War, Vietnam War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The nature of the genre lends itself to works that might be oﬀensive to some. my task is not to control or censor the material published or released, but to document it. language and images we now consider racist were in common use in past wars. racial stereotyping was incorporated for propaganda purposes in an eﬀort to dehumanize the enemy. Their inclusion in this book is a historical record of the political and social environment of the time. my intention is to inform, first and also entertain the reader in the hope of stimulating further interest in the genre. The main body of this book incorporates an A–Z encyclopedia format. Entries are divided into sub-genres that define the Weird War subject according to content. Subjects that appear as entries themselves are featured in bold type. An appendix lists the individual entries under their respective subheadings. my choices for inclusion are based on my own research and criteria. I have divided subjects into the following categories.\n\nWeird War [WW] A war story that includes horror, supernatural or fantasy elements. Themes include: angels, apparitions, astral projection, demons, enchantment, faeries, ghosts, goblins, hexes and curses, magic, mediums, mummies, the occult, possession, shape-shifters, sirens, spirit guides, telekinesis, telepathy, vampires, visions, werewolves, witchcraft and zombies.\n\nAlternative History War [AHW] A “what if ” scenario that speculates an alternative history to various historical wars. This category is only included if the alternate history setting contains supernatural, science fiction or super-hero elements. Alternate history in itself is speculative fiction rather than weird.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nMythological Weird War [MWW] Stories where mythological gods intervene in historical wars. usually confined to ancient wars such as the Trojan War, gods also feature in tales of modern warfare.\n\nScience Fiction War [SFW] Stories involving war and the military may include extraterrestrial intervention in historical wars on Earth, time travel, future technology, medical experimentation and mutants. This category often merges with Alternative History War [AHW] where time travel and future technology introduced into the past can change the outcome of a war.\n\nSuper-Hero War [SHW] Stories, usually in the form of comic books, strips or graphic novels based around superheroes or villains in a historical war setting. These include heroes or villains with various powers including, flight, invulnerability, x-ray vision, heat vision, telescopic vision, flame-throwing, super-cold breath, super-speed, super-strength, super-lungs, invisibility, mind control, occult powers, stretchable limbs and shape-shifting.\n\nIntroduction The Weird War story has always been with us, beginning with the exploits of mythological gods and their interaction with mankind in the epic poems of the ancient world. Homer’s The Iliad (760–710 bc) takes place against the backdrop of the Trojan War. The gods Athena and Hera aid the Greeks (Achaeans), while Zeus, Poseidon and Apollo favor the Trojans. With the Trojans gaining the upper hand the reluctant Achilles joins the battle and slays Hector outside the walls of Troy. Achilles accepts a ransom to return Hector’s body to the Trojans where Hector receives a hero’s funeral. Homer’s influence ensured the Trojan War continued to be a popular subject for ancient poets and playwrights. The celebrated roman poet Virgil tells the story of Aeneas, a Trojan warrior blessed by the gods, who survives the fall of Troy. The Aeneid (29–19 bc) recalls the story of the Trojan wooden horse and the sack of Troy. Aeneas and fellow surviving Trojans journey to Italy, encountering numerous ordeals that include plagues and part female-part bird creatures known as Harpies. finally Aeneas descends into the underworld to visit his dead father, guided by Sibyl of cumae. Here Aeneas is shown the future glory of rome. but on his return from the underworld more trials await in the form of a new enemy named Turnus. Another war begins, but out of the carnage the ancestor of the romans will triumph. In Elizabethan England playwright William Shakespeare employed ghosts for dramatic eﬀect in Richard III, Hamlet, Macbeth and Julius Caesar. richard III is visited by the spirits of his victims in his tent before the battle of bosworth field, while the ghost of the murdered Julius caesar appears to brutus on the eve of the battle of Philippi. The supernatural lends itself to the subject of violent, premature death. Ghosts, whether real, imagined or the result of nightmares, are a natural outlet for the horrors of war. It is a time when horror and sadism comes to the surface and all manner of atrocities are allowed. Tales of ghostly apparitions are frequent in the Weird War genre. In war there is no place for appeasement of the enemy. When your life and those of your colleagues are in mortal danger you aim to strike first. Stories of great courage are tempered with accounts of cowardice in battle. This is where we enter the world of trapped souls and haunted battlefields. The American civil War, in particular, is a favorite of haunted battlefields. These battlefields often lead to unsolved murder mysteries and ghosts seeking a resolution to conflicts that stopped them from crossing over after death. Sometimes fiction proves more powerful than fact and the lines become blurred. Inspired by the retreat of british forces at mons, france in August 1914, Arthur machen’s story “The bowmen,” first published in The Evening News (london, September 29, 1914) was never meant to be read as a factual account. In his short story St. George and an army of medieval Agincourt bowmen cover the retreat of british armed forces on the battlefield at mons during World War I. The fictional story perpetuated the legend of the “Angels of mons” where soldiers claimed this was a real-life event. Such is the power of words that touch a patriotic nerve. In contrast World War II lends itself to subjects that include medical experimentations 3\n\nIntroduction\n\n4\n\nthat produce super-soldiers or mutants, super-weapons, nazis meddling in the occult, vampires or zombie armies, and military bases on the moon or mars. It is the point where the supernatural and science fiction cross paths and the genre broadens its horizon. In the years between the two World Wars the pulp magazines became a popular medium for fantastic adventures, ranging from detective fiction, to Westerns, to science fiction and the paranormal. Adolf Hitler’s advance through Europe oﬀered the American pulp magazine editors a new focus with the introduction of stories featuring nazis. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in december 1942 science fiction pulp magazines such as Amazing Stories extended their reach to Japanese forces with stories involving aliens, time travel, super-weapons, ancient curses and apparitions.\n\nCharles Dana Gibson’s cartoon commentary on World War I for Life (1916).\n\n5\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs the pulps reached their peak of popularity they morphed into the comic book. We all need heroes, whether earth bound or paranormal. Individuals willing to place others above themselves. And every hero needs a villain to conquer. during times of war, heroes and villains come to the forefront of public consciousness. The comic book industry wasted no time in exploiting their young reader’s desire for heroes with the creation of patriotic super-heroes such as Captain America. Editors for smaller publishers seized on the opportunity to expand their readership by creating an assortment of lesser known patriotic super-heroes that included, Captain Battle and Captain Fearless. Their time in the spotlight was often brief before they disappeared into oblivion when World War II ended. With the Axis powers defeated even war heroes such as Captain America found it hard to justify their existence and were forced into early retirement. Popular heroes such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman survived because their reason for existing wasn’t tied to the war. As a new generation who never experienced World War II began reading comics for the first time the war comic book made a comeback. most publications included standard World War II stories featuring a heroic figure leading his army, naval or air force unit into battle. but a few strips, such as Haunted Tank and The War That Time Forgot, ventured into the supernatural and science fiction genres. Then along came Stan lee, Jack Kirby and the “marvel Age” where they revived the Timely war heroes Captain America, Sub-Mariner and Human Torch (now in human form and no relation to his World War II counterpart). but as the 1960s came to an end and the war in Vietnam continued to cost young lives super-heroes such as Captain America were subject to self doubt. The world was a more complex place than the 1940s and war wasn’t always seen as heroic by an anti–Vietnam War youth culture. In this social context the Weird War tale resurfaced in late 1971 with dc comics’ Weird War Tales, exclusively dedicated to the supernatural and science fiction war story. The relaxation of guidelines by the comics code Authority once again allowed for supernatural subject matter and the use of the word “Weird” in comic book titles. Publisher James Warren had avoided the censorship of the ccA in the 1960s by publishing horror and fantasy comic books in a black-and-white magazine format. His titles, Creepy and Eerie featured the occasional Weird War strips. Stories aimed at the juvenile market haven’t been confined to comic books or graphic novels. Weird War literature, in the form of novels or illustrated story books, has mainly concentrated on ghost stories, where soldiers seek resolution for their untimely deaths, and time travel, where youngsters find themselves experiencing life during various wars in history. In Charlotte Sometimes by Penelope farmer (Harcourt, brace & World, 1969), charlotte makepeace is still adapting to her new boarding school when she finds herself thrown back in time to 1918 with a new identity. And in 1918 clare moby is thrust forward in time to exchange identities with charlotte. Each girl is living the life of the other displaced in time. In Rebel Spirits by lois ruby (Point, 2013), lori chase moves with her parents to coolspring Inn in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. She discovers its reputation for being haunted is deserved when she meets handsome but deceased civil War union soldier nathaniel Pierce in her bedroom. lori has three days to discover the truth behind his death and charges of treason before he disappears forever. meanwhile, old war movies turn up on television where viewers can meet the spirit of A Guy Named Joe (1944) and became witness to the strange afterlife of a lovesick bomber pilot played by david niven in A Matter of Life and Death (1946). These films originally acted as tranquilizers to comfort the nerves and point to a deeper meaning behind the deaths of loved ones during World War II. The television anthology shows One Step Beyond and rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone introduced audiences to many Weird War tales in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Producer Irwin Allen continued the trend in the mid–1960s with various episodes of\n\nIntroduction\n\n6\n\nhis action-packed TV series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and The Time Tunnel. The original Star Trek series also featured two Weird War episodes from the same period. In the post–9/11 world, terrorists groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS strike a raw nerve and are still being assimilated by the general public. fiction from this period is grim and based on actual events rather than the paranormal, although this area is gradually being explored. In the film Djinns (2010) french soldiers investigating a military plane crash in Algeria are attacked by local mujahideen fighters. They take cover in a village but cannot find shelter from the evil supernatural enemy that attacks their minds and souls. In Neither Heaven or Earth (2015) french soldiers, on a mission in Afghanistan, begin to disappear from their posts. captain Antares bonassieu investigates by talking to local villagers, but supernatural forces may be at work. Camel Spiders (2011) begins in Afghanistan where the Taliban are attacked by giant spiders known by locals as “devils of the Sand.” despite initial cynicism u.S. soldiers soon find themselves under attack. The spiders crawl inside the body bag of corporal Schwalb and on arrival in the u.S. make their exit into the desert of the Southwest where they attack and kill anyone who crosses their path. modern warfare is increasingly complex. The wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have created heated debate. The nature of warfare itself is evolving and expanding to domestic terrorism. It is understandable that so much Weird War fiction is concentrated within the two World Wars where the nazis and the Japanese were identifiable enemies and events such as Pearl Harbor and d-day have become ingrained in the public psyche. Winston churchill’s famous speech to the House of commons in 1940 where he tells the british people, “We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields, and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender…” exemplifies the unified spirit of a nation fighting the nazi enemy. nobody questions or doubts the evil nature of Adolf Hitler and the Gestapo. The fact the nazis lost the war in real life gives the reader more room to enjoy alternative history, science fiction and horror scenarios in Weird War fiction, games or films. Present day warfare doesn’t oﬀer the same comfort of victory or the distance of time to heal emotional wounds. Given the seriousness of war some may comment the Weird War genre is a triviality that reduces war to entertainment. That heroes are nothing more than a device to manipulate the readers or audiences into patriotic fervor. complex because simple. Shades of gray become black-and-white. The truth is the Weird War genre covers a broad spectrum. from the juvenile heroics found in war-time comic books or pulp fiction, to films, television, videogames and novels that either exploit war in simplistic terms or incorporate the supernatural or science fiction as a means to social commentary. In the acclaimed graphic novels Maus: A Survivor’s Tale and Maus II: And Here My Troubles Began by Art Spiegelman (random House, 1986, 1991), mice represent the Jews and cats represent the evil, sadistic nazis, in a moving tale of the horrors of the Holocaust. At the opposite end of the spectrum the novel Mr. Limpet by Theodore Pratt (Alfred A. Knopf, 1942) features a man who transforms into a talking fish to help the u.S. navy destroy u-boats in World War II. The story was later adapted into the film The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964) starring don Knotts. The target audience must always be taken into account when reading through the entries that form the main body of this encyclopedia.\n\nThe Encyclopedia Abe Lincoln at Last! (Magic Tree House #47) [ Juvenile book; WW]\n\nax as he wreaks his vengeance on the vampire menace. Joining him in his fight against the undead is author Edgar Allan Poe. Lincoln’s time in the White House is dominated by a bloody Civil War as soldier turns upon soldier and slaves turn on their vampire captors. In a letter to his bride, Union private Andrew Merrow describes the gruesome events at the First Battle of Bull Run. “The rebels smashed into our ranks and tore men apart in front of my eyes. I do not mean to suggest that they ran them through with bayonets, or fired on them with revolvers. I mean to say these rebels—these thirty unarmed men—tore one hundred men to pieces with nothing more than their bare hands.” Amidst the carnage of war Lincoln becomes increasingly paranoiac about being assassinated. His fears are justified as vampire John Wilkes Booth awaits. Speaking to Liane Hansen on NPR Weekend Edition (March 20, 2010), author Seth GrahameSmith commented on the link between slavery and vampirism in his novel. “I see them as sort of one and the same. Both creatures, basically slaveholders and vampires, steal lives—take the blood of others—to enrich themselves.”\n\nAuthor: Mary Pope Osborne; Illustrator: Sal Murocca; First publication: New York: Random House, 2000.\n\nIn Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, eight-year-old Jack and his seven- year-old sister Annie come across a magical tree house filled with books that can take them to any time and place in history. Those books belong to Morgan le Fay, magical librarian at King Arthur’s court in Camelot. Young enchanter Teddy has accidentally placed a spell turning Merlin’s beloved penguin into a statue. To reverse the spell Jack and Annie must collect four special items from diﬀerent places and times in history. In Washington, D.C., 1861 that special item is a feather. But President Abraham Lincoln has more important concerns on his mind, primarily the Civil War between the States. The young time travelers try to comfort President Lincoln with a special handwritten note. “Never lose hope. This land will live peacefully as one nation one day, with freedom for everyone. We give you our word.”—Jack and Annie. See: Civil War on Sunday\n\n2.

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian ( June 21, 2012) commented that the film is “Cheerfully subversive post-steam punk fantasy…. It’s a joke which some will find in sacrilegious bad taste.
