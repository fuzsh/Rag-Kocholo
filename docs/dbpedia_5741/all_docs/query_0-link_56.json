        "text": "Let’s get one thing straight:\n\nI like Captain America.\n\nI like his “patriotic weakling to walking symbol of hope and freedom” origin story.\n\nI like his old timey way, and how it juxtaposes so well with the often times annoying immature antics of today’s comic superheroes.\n\nI like his powers and abilities, as the range of his physical capabilities allows him to be “super,” while at the same time quite vulnerable.\n\nHell, as goofy as it can look at times, I even like his costume design.\n\nWhen I first heard that Chris Evans was going to be playing Cap in Captain America: The First Avenger movie, my initial reaction was to say:\n\n“Really? Chris Evans is in another comic book movie?”\n\nOff the top of my head, Chris Evans has been in 4 comic book movies, playing 3 different characters, with no less than 2 more roles down the road if you count the Captain America film in question, and his appearance in the upcoming Avengers film.\n\nMake no mistake, comic book movies as still very much “in” at the moment, and if anyone is making bank off of the trend, my guess is it would be Mr. Evans.\n\nNow, while that may have been my initial reaction to the Captain America casting news; my honest to God feelings on the matter were lodged somewhere in the valley between confusion and disbelief.\n\nTo date, I still can’t understand why he was chosen for the Captain America role.\n\nWith the exception of Street Kings, wherein he played a very vanilla and by the book cop; every role I’ve seen Evans in has had him cast as the “funny guy” or failing that, the “funny guy that can set himself on fire.”\n\nTruth be told, I’ve never been disappointed by any of his performances, not that that’s saying much; but the point is:\n\nUnless he’s hiding some well-concealed stoicism or acting range beneath his “funny guy” exterior, he just doesn’t seem like Cap to me.\n\nCaptain America is one of those characters that, to me; is more easily represented as a somewhat older man.\n\nWhile the First Avenger is most likely going to take place exclusively in the WWII era, when Steve Rogers was cutting his teeth on Nazis, for some reason I’ve always pictured Captain America as being one of those guys that’s been a manly man since the cradle.\n\nKind of like Charles Bronson, James Coburn, or Anthony Hopkins.\n\nI know It’s unfair of me to judge an actor, or a film for that matter; before it’s even had a trailer, but in my mind the actors that would have best played Captain America have already aged themselves out of the running.\n\nDespite a distinct lack of physicality, I always felt that Robert Redford could’ve made for a very effective Captain America.\n\nHis voice, face, hair color, acting ability and God given aura of gravitas would’ve gone a long way towards legitimizing the character and the film.\n\nNot only that, with movies like A River Runs Through It, and The Natural under his belt, he always had that all-American feel to him.\n\nSome people said the same of Kevin Costner.\n\nSaid people are of course, utterly retarded and full of shit, as Costner’s just about the most boring and vanilla pile of feces to ever walk the face of the Earth.\n\nSadly, “boring as shit” seems to describe far too many young actors these days.\n\nMaybe it’s just because they’re young, and seem to be cast more for their looks than their acting ability, but to me it seems like most of the big-budget blockbuster movie actors these days just seem to lack “character,” at least in a physical sense.\n\nWhen you look at the actors from back in the day, they had a look to them that lent a lot to their performances.\n\nNot only that, in the post-studio picture era, subtlety was an acting trait that was considered praise worthy among performers, a fact that has not changed since; but seemingly has eluded many of the young actors of today.\n\nI’m rambling.\n\nAnyway, at this point in time, The First Avenger seems like a pretty decent movie on paper.\n\nIt has a pretty strong cast, with Hugo Weaving sure to steal the show as The Red Skull, and a competent, if somewhat bipolar director at the helm in the form of Joe Johnston.\n\nIf Johnston gives us another Rocketeer or Jumanji, then Captain America’s gonna’ kick some serious ass.\n\nIf he gives us another Jurassic Park III though, then I just might have to sit this one out.\n\nIn either case, the man has shown considerable zeal for crafting old timey period films, not to mention he has a tremendous visual effects background, so if nothing else; the film will be pretty to look at…\n\nThat being said, on a final note, I’d just like to say that I sincerely disapprove of Marvel’s decision to rely on the Ultimate Universe for some of the visual stylings and character interpretations for their current and future films.\n\nI understand that the Ultimate Universe has not been confirmed to be used as direct source material for said films, but from what I’ve seen, that seems to the case.\n\nMaybe it’s because the Ultimate Universe was never targeted at my age group, as it’s intended audience is that of younger, less seasoned comic fans, but honestly I’ve never seen the appeal of it.\n\nI can understand Marvel’s desire to use the black Nick Fury, as Samuel L. Jackson is the bees knees in the eyes of dorky haole kids, but to be perfectly honest; it makes me sad that both the Captain America and Thor movie’s character designs have drawn influence from the Ultimate Universe.\n\nLong story short, Ultimate Thor is okay, but Ultimate Captain America is absolutely hideous in my eyes."
