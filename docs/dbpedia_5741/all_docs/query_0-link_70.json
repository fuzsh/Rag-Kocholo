        "text": "Description=365 Puzzle Club is a collection of three Japanese number puzzle games.<br><br>1. Sudoku is a logic puzzle game mostly played on a 9x9 grid of nine 3x3 boxes. The idea behind the game is to enter all numbers between 1 and 9 in every cell of a 3x3 box without any duplications. Each row and column needs to add up to 9. Some cells have predefined numbers that cannot be changed. The rest has to be filled in with the right number.<br><br>2. Kakuro is a logic puzzle game that is similar to crosswords but with numbers instead of letters. Each row and column has a clue numbers and the numbers that are filled in the cells have to add up to this number. <br><br>3. Tenpenki is a puzzle game which requires logic and elimination and once completed shows a picture. Each row and column has a clue number which is the same as the number of consecutive filled cells that have to appear there.<br><br>The game features a number of game modes. The quick play allows the player to play any of the three games and he can choose from 3 sizes and 4 difficulty levels. There's also the calendar tour mode where a new puzzle is unlocked every day. For each puzzle the player gets a score based on how accurately and quickly he has completed it. This is then totalled up every month and can be submitted and compared with other players. The third mode is the seasons mode where the player is presented a map of interconnected icons, each representing a puzzle. The player starts at one of the outer puzzles and by completing puzzles he will be able to move towards the centre where a final puzzle has to be completed. By completing it the player unlocks another season of which there are four in total. <br><br>The game also offers the player to create custom sudoku puzzles. Other features include statistics based on how the player has fared, a tutorial to help out new players, and accolades that are awarded to the player as he reaches different predefined goals.\n\nDescription=3D Lawn Darts takes the classic game of lawn darts and brings it to mobile devices. Lawn darts is a game played outside where you lob big metal darts at a circle on the ground. The game was banned in the United States and Canada because of all the injuries.<br><br>The unique thing with 3D Lawn Darts (besides having a full 3D game on a mobile device) is that it uses real motion for throwing the darts. The way this works is that the mobile device must have a camera that the game can use. Then during the game, it vibrates to let you know to toss the dart. Once the person feels the vibration, he/she then makes a throwing motion while a picture is taken. The game then analyzes the pictures blur to decide where the dart goes. Once the motion is made he/she can view the screen and follow the dart in the 3D world through the air till it hits the target.<br><br>Besides the motion other features of the game are choice of 3D world (4 choices), choice of player to throw the dart (4 choices again) and different types of darts to throw. Dart choices include flaming darts, nuclear darts, magnetic darts, and more.\n\nDescription=The 7th Guest is a puzzle-adventure game which takes place inside an abandoned mansion. Venture into the 22 rooms of the spooky mansion, solve over 20 mind-bending puzzles to unravel a tale of revenge and horror that took place in the 1930s.<br><br>The owner of the mansion was Henry Stauf, a famous maker of children's toys. Once a homeless drifter and thief, influenced by a vision in a dream, Henry invented a wondrous doll, so incredibly life-like that it sold like wildfire. Stauf's toys became popular overnight bringing fame and fortune and changing his rags to riches. But things took a tragic turn when owners of the doll became infected with a fierce and deadly virus. None of those children recovered.<br><br>After this turn of events Stauf secluded himself inside his estate, stopped making his toys and never came into contact with the outside world for a long time. Something very strange happened when six people receive an invitation to a party at the mansion. By solving the riddles inside Stauf's \"fun house\", you'll delve into the past to learn what happened to them, and the mysterious 7th guest, on that fateful night.<br><br>The game is played in first person perspective with a point-and-click interface featuring horror-themed animated cursors (skeletons, bulging-eye skulls etc.). It is one of the first games to be released on the then-new CD-Rom media. The graphics are fully rendered in SVGA, and real actors and actresses bring the story to life during numerous full-motion video cut scenes. The visuals are accompanied by an original, orchestrated musical score.<br><br>To finish the game, you must solve the puzzles in Stauf's manor; each solved puzzle will unlock new rooms or new movie sequences to watch. The puzzles are quite varied; there's the classic \"eight queens puzzle\", another puzzle where you need to compose a sentence by rearranging letters, and others. If you get stuck, you can visit the library; a book within will give you hints on the puzzle. If the hints aren't enough, the puzzle will solve itself automatically once you consult the book enough times. <br><br>Some later, limited releases of the game came with a separate video that included a \"behind the scenes\" look at the making of the game and interviews with the developers.\n\nDescription=ABM Command (formerly DEFCON 1) is a missile defense game. The game is split into three phases:<br>1. In the defense phase, ICBMs move from top to bottom of screen and player touches the screen to launch ABM interceptors. The player also rolls the screen side to side to scroll the battlefield.<br><br>2. In the attack phase, the player turns the device to landscape mode and drags from the top to the bottom of the screen. ICBMs are launched at enemy cities in the location and direction that the player drags.<br><br>3. Between rounds, the player can use money generated in the previous two phases to buy advanced special weapons. The weapons include standard missile command fare (MIRV, Smart Bomb, Bomber Wing) and special weapons unique to DEFCON 1 (Orbital Space Laser, Death Blossom, and offensive and defensive targeting systems).<br>Players can play as one of six fictional nations, each balanced in different categories (national population, technology base, economy, and regeneration rate). In the campaign game the player is attacked by each nation in turn (from easier to harder difficulty) until the player either defeats all enemies or is obliterated.\n\nDescription=It is the unimaginably distant year 2009. You are Nick Vrenna, falsely locked inside a high security prison. The genetic experiments conducted in the prison, combined with a full-scale riot that took place recently, caused all guards and inmates to be transformed into insane, aggressive mutants. Your job is to escape while stopping the genetic plague from transforming the whole world. <br><br>Abuse is a side-scrolling platformer with a lot of shooting. It's a nonlinear game, as the levels often have a few exits that lead to different areas. Your character is a cyborg equipped with various weapons; initially, you only have a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or lightsabers. You move through a building complex, fighting any enemies you might encounter on the way. The enemies are mostly the mutants, but also the defense systems (such as stationary missile launchers). <br><br>While you move with the keyboard, you can aim with your mouse, so you can shoot at any angle no matter what direction you are running. On your way, you'll find elevators, teleporters, cracked walls that can be destroyed and more. <br><br>Apart from ammo and health, you can also find upgrades which have a number of beneficial effect - increasing your running speed, for example.\n\nDescription=Airport Mania: First Flight is a time management game where players get the chance to become an air traffic controller with control of an airport. As typical in the genre, the player has a complete view of his airport and has to perform different tasks by pointing and clicking on the different objects on the screen. The players needs to complete the tasks quickly to keep his customers happy. In its most primitive form this involves clicking on a plane as it appears in the sky, clicking on a runway to make it land, on a gate to load or unload the plane, and then on a runway again to have it take off.<br><br>Planes and gates come in different colors. Players can get combo bonuses by matching planes and gates of the same color. For example unloading a green plane at a green gate. The runways can also be used to create combos by landing multiple planes on the same runway after each other. This can also be done for take-offs. Other tasks that can be done include parking planes that are waiting for a gate. This will make them happier. It's also sometimes necessary to services the planes, like repairing or refuelling them. <br><br>In total, the game contains eight different airports containing 84 levels. Some of these contains unique challengers that needs to be taken care of. The game also features an achievement-like awards system. There is 20 awards in total that the player can get for completing specific objectives. As an extra there is a paper plane mode that can be unlocked by completing the game.\n\nDescription=Alice in Wonderland: An Adventure Beyond the Mirror is a tie-in for the 2010 Tim Burton's movie Alice in Wonderland. It is loosely based on the movie's story, borrowing from it main characters such as Alice, the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare and the Mad Hatter.<br><br>It is a 2D platform puzzle game bearing some similarities to The Lost Vikings series. The main objective in each stage is take Alice from left to right until the end of the stage. The stages can be transposed either by taking Alice through Wonderland or through a mirror version of Wonderland, accessed by mirrors which will work like doorways. Some mirrors will be shattered, so Alice will need to collect the missing pieces to fix and then use them.<br><br>Alice can only run right and left or jump. In order to proceed in some locations, the player must swap Alice for the other characters, which she will find along the way. Each character has a special ability and can be called upon just to use them, not to move. The White Rabbit can stop time for some objects; the Cheshire Cat can make objects appear and disappear; the March Hare can use telekinesis to move an object from a point to another and the Mad Hatter can transform objects from one world to another. Some locations will demand the combination of two or more characters' abilities. When the player reaches the end of a stage, a map of Wonderland will be shown, displaying the next location available as well as the already completed ones. As new characters join Alice's party, the player can replay a stage to reach specific areas which weren't reachable before (without those character abilities). <br>Some low ceiling areas will require Alice to drink the \"drink me\" bottle to be transposed, only to eat the \"eat me\" candy to regain her normal size.<br><br>The obstacles faced are mostly water sections, bottomless pits, spikes and the like. There are Red Queen soldiers in some stages, which can't be killed, only bypassed. Some stages have passages similar to holes opened by torn portions of a book page. In those passages, Alice will find hidden objects, which can be collected and accessed in Alice's journal outside the game. The iPhone version also offers different ways of unlocking those objects, with the player's GPS, Camera and Photo Library. Some other objects can be unlocked by solving riddles or by logging in on specific dates, such as the date when Alice's original Disney movie was released.\n\nDescription=How well do you know the alphabet? Alphabetic tests your skills as you find each letter in alphabetical order in a jumble of letters. While it starts off slowly, things quickly get more difficult as the letters shift, rotate and scale, making what should be a simple task quite difficult!<br><br>For each letter that you find, 3 seconds are added to the clock. Your aim is to reach Z before time runs out. Depending on how quickly you find the next letter, you may receive a score bonus. If you string together consecutive quick finds, you'll receive a chain bonus on top of that.<br><br>Alphabetic has a series of different modes, each one designed to test your skill, including:<br><br>1. Quick Game: See how quickly you can make it from A to Z.<br>2. Reverse: start with Z and work your way back to A.<br>3. Endless: after Z, you start back at A. How long can you last?<br>4. Double: find each letter twice.<br>5. Numeric: search for numbers instead of letters.\n\nDescription=Alan Probe is a moronic, untidy pizza boy, whose big dream is to become a surgeon. One day, when making a delivery, he runs over a drunk tramp. His victim, however, turns out to be a washed-up medical doctor, called Ignacious Bleed. <br><br>Dr. Bleed is in urgent need of medical attention, and will help Alan, whom the player receives control over, to operate him. After successful treatment of the doctor, a whole other bunch of twisted individuals will pass on Alan's improvised operating tables. Between operations, Dr. Bleed's clouded history will unfold.<br><br>Every surgery starts with a close-up of the body part to be operated. The first step is then to cut open the patient, the last one is to close all open wounds. In between, everything is possible: removing glass shards or porcupine spines, transplanting organs, decontamination of a poisoned patient, ...<br><br>The player has a set of tools at hand to cure his patients, which are all controlled using the mouse:<br><br>1. Pizza Cutter - making incisions and cutting out objects buried under the skin.<br><br>2. Tongs - moving loose objects around, pulling objects from skin.<br><br>3. Pain Relief - healing closed wounds, burns, scars and other injuries.<br><br>4. Stapler - holding closed wounds that are open so they can be sealed.<br><br>5.

You will be shown several cells with items. The items will then be hidden and you must find the pairs that match. You will also encounter special cells. The wood blocks and locked cells cannot be matched but if you make a match next to them, they will be cleared and unlocked, respectively. There are also stone blocks. These are like wood blocks but must be matched more than once to clear them. You will also encounter mystery cells. These have a question mark in them. They can be matched to anything you wish but, when used, they do not disappear but change to one of the items on the board.\n\nDescription=Anrufen Online is a traditional Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) for mobile platforms.<br><br>In the game the player controls a single character (male or female) which can be either a knight or a wizard.The character will gain experience by killing monsters and fulfilling quests for NPCs. Enough experience allows the character to go level up which grants additional boosts in stats and abilities. Meanwhile the player will find and collect items that will improve his or her character's prowess in combat. Combat happens in real time with time based cool-downs on abilities.<br><br>It is also possible for players to fight against each other in Player vs. Player combat without any level restrictions.<br><br>On the iPhone the game is free to play, but a premium account allows players to access more maps, encounter more monsters and thus gain more experience and level more quickly.

At the start of the game, the player can choose between three types of units, differing in one of three aspects: speed, agility and propagation. Propagation is especially important since units can't be built but are instead automatically generated in all anthills occupied by the player. At the start of each of the 51 missions the player mostly has only one anthill with a few units already inside at his disposal. Scattered around the map are uninhabited anthills and of course anthills owned by the enemy.<br><br>Since new units are generated in anthills, the player has to capture other anthills in order to increase production. This is accomplished by selecting one or more anthills with at least 7 ants in them and sending them to the desired target. If the player's army is greater than the one currently in that anthill, he'll vanquish the foes and gain control over the hill. Once every enemy anthill has been claimed by the player this way, he wins.\n\nDescription=Armageddon Squadron is an arcade flight simulator which takes place in a fictional WWII scenario. The player controls 5 different famous airplanes from the era in short missions. There are 3 gameplay modes:<br><br>1. Campaign: there are 3 campaigns comprised of 4 missions each. In each mission the player controls different airplanes, from fighters to bombers. Each mission has different goals, such as bombing enemy weapon factories, destroying dams, protecting ally troops, etc. Finishing one mission unlocks the next one, finishing a campaign unlocks the following.<br>2. Time Attack: in this mode the player has to fly through rings within a time limit. Flying successfully through a ring lightens up the next one and adds some seconds to the counter. There are four courses; finishing one unlocks the next.<br>3. Arcade: in this mode, the player selects the airplane, map, terrain, number of enemies, respawn rate and time limit. In this mode only four airplanes are available: the Supermarine Spitfire, F6F Hellcat, Messerschmitt Bf 109, or the Messerschmitt Me 262; the bomber isn't available. Missions are completed when the player takes down all enemies before the time runs out and before a new squadron arrives.<br><br>The airplanes are equipped with different weapons, being machine guns, rockets, torpedoes or bombs. When switching the main weapon to bombs, the camera goes from behind the airplane to above it, making it easier to aim ground targets, but harder to spot aerial enemies. The screen displays a radar with info on enemies' position and two half-circle meters: a red one which measures the plane's health and a yellow one which measures the plane's speed. Onscreen red arrows will point where the objectives in a given mission are.<br><br>The main controls consist in steering the airplane (with the accelerometer where available), selecting weapons, shooting, accelerating and slowing down. There's also a camera with a target view. Finishing each mode grants the player a different medal, as well as scoring points in some modes. By accumulating points the player is granted ranks. The game offers a steering sensibility setting and the option to invert the Y-axis.\n\nDescription=Set in 1190, Altaïr's Chronicles is conceived as a prequel to the original console version of Assassin's Creed. This time, we learn how Altaïr becomes an assassin while looking for an artifact through different cities. It is said that this artifact, known as \"the chalice\", can give its owner the power to stop the Crusades.<br><br>The game is presented as a side-scroller with guided 3D paths. That is, the player has freedom to move in 3 dimensions, as the use of rooftops will be very extensive, but limited to a given path. As in the previous game, Altaïr shows the usual abilities of combat, stealth and parkour-like displacement, that will help him to find alternative routes or fight the enemies if there is not other way. Other abilities such as interrogation and pickpocketing is performed this time through mini-games, that make use of the touch screen of the DS. In addition, Altaïr can gain new abilities through gathering of blue orbs scattered through the maps (short of gaining \"experience\").\n\nDescription=Atlantis Sky Patrol is a marble shooter game with steampunk and Art Deco themes. A twisting track occupies most of the screen state, with lines of multi-colored spheres entering it from one end and rolling towards the exit. The objective is to clear the field by making matches of three or more balls of the same color. The player controls a ship that moves sideways at the bottom, aiming and shooting the matching spheres towards the moving strings. Each level has a series of static balls outside the tracks, that have to be matched and destroyed to stop new marble lines from entering the field. If three or more spheres enter the exit, the game is over and the level has to be restarted.<br><br>Matches of long chains cause explosions that shower down various power-ups and coins, where the ship must be moved quickly to pick up all the falling items before they disappear at the bottom. The power-ups are used automatically after being collected. The Power Ball acts as a wildcard, matching spheres of any color. The Rainbow Hammer throws several balls at the same time. The Rewind moves the lines back to the start. The Color Scanner removes all the spheres of one specific color. The Soul of Atlantis shoots a vertical beam, destroying several marbles in its path. The Orichalchum Bomb explodes the balls surrounding its landing spot.<br><br>The coins are used on separate shop screen between levels, to buy helpful upgrades. The accuracy upgrade adds an aiming laser to the ship. Speed upgrades make the ship shoot faster. The bonus magnet attracts all the falling items, making it easier to catch all of them. Rewinder upgrades increase the number of bonus items at the end of each level. The disrupter delays the release of new marble strings. Every upgrade has several levels, each gradually more expensive and stronger.<br><br>A mini-game appears between levels, where the goal is to shoot the large, floating spheres bouncing around to collect bonus items, avoiding hits to the mines that explode the marbles. Besides the main single player campaign, there are modes for two players on the same machine. Team Quest mode is similar to the main single-player Quest mode, but with both players cooperating to beat each level. Competition mode has the players fighting each other.\n\nDescription=In the game, you play as Klink, a robot vacuum cleaner that has a mission of cleaning the house of all of the dust bunnies that have taken over various rooms of the house. To eliminate the various types of dust bunnies, you must tap (or tap and drag your finger) each dust bunny on the screen - this targets the dust bunny and forces Klink to shoot a pine solvent missile at the enemy. If you tap the right or left side of the screen, you are able to move the camera a bit in that direction to reveal more of the area you are trying to clean (and more dust bunnies). When dust bunnies appear in the parts of the level that are off screen, an alarm sounds warning you that you should move the camera to reveal more dust bunnies. <br><br> Each level consists of a different room in a house. In order to complete a level and move on to the next, you must complete each levels objective. Objectives consist of various tasks such as killing a certain number of dust bunnies, defeating a boss dust bunny, and killing dust bunnies with a certain type of weapon. The game also has 2 different game modes - Campaign, where you progress level by level, and Survivor mode where you try to last in a single level as long as possible.\n\nDescription=Aurora Feint II: Arena Daemons is a persistent online multiplayer game featuring game play similar to Tetris Attack.<br><br>Players have a character that levels in a typical Role Playing Game style. Gaining experience is player by playing a Tetris Attack-like game. The game field is build up from runes and the player needs to line them up three (or more) of a kind to remove them and score points. Unlike Tetris Attack removed runes aren't immediately refilled from the top of the screen. Instead the screen slowly scrolls upward revealing more and more runes. The player can also tilt The screen to make the block fall to the left or right. The player can speed up by swiping the runes upwards.<br><br>Player vs Player battles can be performed in the arena but are asynchronous. Thus players don't fight against each other live. Instead a player challenges another player by fighting the AI and the other player has to beat that score.<br><br>Players can practice on their own in the single player areas of the game which is more or less the same as Aurora Feint: The Beginning. Players who already played the first part can import their character.<br><br>Players can chat with other online players in the tavern. Which can be accessed at any time by tapping the bottom of the screen.\n\nDescription=Avoid Hitting Piano is a very fast side-scrolling game where the player is Ludwig van Beethoven in Vienna, 1826. He is late to deliver the musical score for his latest string quartet, opus 131 in c sharp minor, and now has to get it to the destination quickly.<br><br>Players control different characters, one at a time, as they run through the scenery, tapping the screen anywhere to jump over objects or characters that pass by. When one of them accidentally hits one, the game is not over right away, but a second chance is given by synchronizing the word \"Beethoven\" over the word \"piano\" multiple times, in a very different environment.<br><br>The game also tries to confuse the player by quickly skipping to different segments at different speeds, often changing the protagonist as well as the colours in the environment.\n\nDescription=When you awaken in a mysterious prison you have no idea how you got there or why. Your great-uncle Titus will offer assistance from beyond in freeing you and himself from the puzzles of Azada. Find the pages of the book and you'll both be free.<br><br>Azada is a multi-puzzle adventure game where you must solve a bevy of different types of puzzles in order to collect painting fragments that will unlock the final puzzles to escape the room. The sorts of puzzles you will have to deal with range from many typical puzzle mini-games such as; a match game where you have to match different butterflies, a symbol-sudoku game, a sequence following game where you must remember the sequence of musical tones played, picture-puzzles where you'll have to use sliders, a game where you'll have to place arrows on the ground in order to lead a robot to the exit, a game played against the AI where you'll try and complete squares while taking turns laying down lines, a match-stick moving game where you'll have to reduce a number of boxes, mazes, math puzzles and even a tower of Hanoi game. <br><br>The most unique puzzles of the game however are the ones that play similarly to graphic-adventure point-and-click games. You'll be given a stationary picture of a room with three or four objects to find in it. When you find these objects you will use them to uncover the pages of the Azada book in order to move to the next puzzle. For example you will need a pipe segment which you'll need to attach to a pipe you uncover while opening a cupboard and then when the pipe drains a number combination will fall out which you'll enter into a lock-keypad and so on and so forth.<br><br>There are over forty different puzzles and puzzles make re-appearances as you play along the game and will get more challenging as you encounter them further along. For example the aforementioned Towers of Hanoi will gradually go from four discs to transfer over to seven discs. There are five master-level puzzle challenges to move through which are actually the pages of the Azada book where the forty+ puzzles are contained.\n\nDescription=Your archaeological team found what they thought was a common relic but it turned out to be powerful and cursed. Now you must make your way to the Temple of Time to return the relic and lift the curse.<br><br>Azkend is a match three puzzle game. To make a match, you place your mouse on a tile, hold down the button then drag the mouse to connect three or more of the same symbols. These will then disappear and the tiles below them will change to blue. If a tile has a steel plate, it must be matched twice to turn blue. Later, some tiles will be frozen, locked or tarred. These cannot be matched to other tiles and to release them, you must make a match next to them. Tar will, if left too long, spread to other tiles.<br><br>Every five levels that you complete will complete a talisman. These will then show up in the puzzle as symbols that can also be connected. Connect four or more talisman symbols to activate its power. These powers include exploding and destroying the tiles next to it, having a hammer destroy random areas of the board, having shooting stars destroy random areas of the board, etc. Every time you make a match that has non-blue tiles under it, you power up the Thunder Meter. After five matches, five lightning bolts will destroy five non-blue tiles, randomly. If you make a match with only blue tiles, you cancel the Thunder Meter and must start from the bottom. If you make a match string of seven or more symbols, you get a single lightning bolt strike, whether there were non-blue tiles or not.<br><br>After every level, the background picture colors in a bit. After it is fully colored, you play a bonus game where you need to find the area of the picture shown in the bottom left. There are seven areas to find and if you find all seven before time runs out, you will gain seven seconds added to the time for the next seven levels.\n\nDescription=Even though they already got paid, the bankers are still storming the White House in order to collect the rest of the available bailout money. The job of the player is to prevent that in this castle-defense-variant. To do so, the player can pick up the normal bankers, throw them around or shake them until their cloth fall off and they run away ashamed. Each type banker is vulnerable and immune to a specific attack. The second type of banker for example uses his briefcase to prevent the player from flinging him in the air and hoping he falls to his death.<br><br>To help the player with the increasing number of bankers, he can buy three types of defenses: a sniper, a tank and Uncle Sam. Each one has a solid automatic and a more powerful, manually triggered attack that thins the ranks of the bankers but requires more or less time to become available again. Uncle Sam for example activates a orbital laser which instantly kills any type of banker and seriously hurts the CEO. Each defense unit can be upgraded in several stages with the money dropped by killed bankers. Sometimes they even drop items like credit cards which need to be collected manually but significantly increase the money gained.<br><br>The game is divided into waves of increasing difficulty and ends once all of the bailout money has been stolen by the bankers.\n\nDescription=Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.<br><br>Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must clear.\n\nDescription=In futuristic Australia, there are giant cities owned solely by corporations, separated by a giant wasteland known as The Gap. When Robert Foster's Gap-dwelling tribe is killed by soldiers from Union City who capture him, everything changes for him. After a narrow escape from the helicopter bringing him there as it inexplicably crashes, Robert and his droid Joey must search the decaying city, attempting to befriend both the snobby rich and the frustrated poor as the two attempt to get out of the city, but in the middle of everything they uncover the dark truth about LINC, the bizarre computer which makes the city tick.<br><br>Using the then revolutionary Virtual Theatre engine, BASS' characters can move freely independent of the player, allowing the game world to be much more dynamic than anything seen before (other than Virtual Theatre's debut game, the less popular Lure of the Temptress). Otherwise, the engine provides tried and true point-and-click adventure gameplay.<br><br>The iPhone version introduces a touch-based interface, new animated movies by Dave Gibbons, a context-sensitive hint system and a remastered audio track.\n\nDescription=In Bird Strike the player indirectly controls a bird in order to get the highest score in the different levels. To do so, the player flings the bird up in the air via touch-screen at the beginning of a level and then has to move the device around in order to alter the flight-path of the little birdie. But the initial fling won't push the bird very far up so in order to get higher and higher, the bird has to hit rockets or enter an air-stream to get further up. Once the bird reaches the top of the level, an UFO infuses him with energy and he falls down the whole level, destroying everything in his path until he hits the ground and the level ends.<br><br>Several obstacles hinder the birds fly upwards including steam-beams, balloons and other birds. Most of these obstacles are normally indestructible on the players way up and have to be avoided at all costs or the bird will stop his ascent and fly down until he hits another rocket or is back on the ground. Power-ups scattered around the level including a helmet which allows the bird to destroy objects even on his way up and an umbrella which slows down his descent help the player to get the highest score possible. In order to score points, the bird on the other hand needs to collect seeds and destroy as many objects as possible. Bonus points are earned if the player hits the sewer entrance on his way down or performs a really high climb with just one rocket.\n\nDescription=Bit. Trip Beat is a unique combination of Pong and a rhythm game. The game is played by holding the Wii-remote sideways and tilting it away or towards the body. This in turn moves a paddle on the left side of the screen vertically up or down. The objective of the game is to hit the various \"balls\" with the paddle coming into the screen from the right. The balls are synchronized with the beat of the game's chiptune soundtrack, creating a logical connection between what players are seeing and what they are hearing.<br><br>The screen contains two bars. Hitting a ball will fill up the top bar until it is full. This increases the multiplier and makes the visual effects in the background more complex, thus increasing the difficulty. The lower bar is emptied if the player misses a ball. If the bottom bar is depleted, the game switches into a black and white mode, similar to the original Pong game, where only the Wii-remote's speaker is active. In this mode, the player has to fill the top bar again to return to normal play. If the bottom bar runs out again, the game is over.<br><br>Bit. Trip Beat has a variety of balls the player has to repel. They are colour-coded to indicate their movement type: orange balls bounce off the paddle multiple times, while yellow balls only travel in a straight line for example. Occasionally, bonus items can be picked up with the paddle, which for example change the paddle's size similar to the power-ups found in Breakout.<br><br>At the end of each level, a boss fight awaits the player. Defeating the boss grants access to the next level, of which there are a total of three. After playing through a level once, it can be selected at the main menu.\n\nDescription=Blades of Fury is a 3D fighting game with touch screen controls.<br><br>The game comes with 10 different characters to play with. Each character has its own weapons, attacks, combos and two different costumes to choose from. In one-on-one combat players fight it out against the CPU or friends via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth in 10 different arenas. The CPU player has various difficulties. Included are four game modes: Story, Arcade, Survival and Practice.<br><br>The game can be controlled using one of two control schemes. Both make use of the touch screen. The first mimics the buttons of a conventional fighting game on the sides of the screen. The other allows the player to use touch gestures to make attacks, dodge, jump, crouch, roll, etc.<br><br>Each character has two types of standard attacks and a magical attack. Magical attacks require mana which is gained when hitting the enemy or getting hit. The mana bar is divided into four blocks. Holding the attack longer consumes more blocks for a more powerful attack, but leave the character vulnerable for the duration. Players can block attacks but after a while their armor will break.\n\nDescription=In Bloons, the player assumes the role of a monkey sitting on a platform in the clouds attempting to pop as many balloons as possible. The player uses the touch screen of the iPhone or iPod Touch in order to aim the primate's throw and indicate its velocity; letting go of the touch screen throws the dart and physics takes its course. Each level has a minimum number of balloons that must be popped before progressing to the next level.<br><br>In addition to the standard balloons, various levels have special balloons, such as a balloon with extra darts, a tack-filled balloon which will pop all nearby balloons if it is burst, and balloons containing boomerangs (useful for tricky balloon-popping maneuvers). Different levels also have varying obstacles which must be overcome as part of the puzzle, such as blocks which might be destructible with a dart.\n\nDescription=Blue Attack is the sequel to Blue Defense by the same author. You control a starfighter launched from the blue carrier and must destroy the red ships before they reach and destroy your carrier. Your fighter may be accompanied by up to 8 wingmen that increase your firepower. The game is essentially a 2D shooter. The blue squadron can either be controlled with the accelerometer or using a touch interface. Red ships are complex geometrical shapes that must be destroyed step by step. Every ship contains a core that must be destroyed in order to blow up the whole ship.<br><br>The ultimate goal of the game is to destroy the red planet. In campaign mode you select your next attack target on a map screen. You cannot select the difficulty directly; instead, more difficult levels only become available if you have completed the previous level below a time limit. There is also an infinite mode where you simply try to survive wave after wave. In between levels you can buy upgrades for your fighters, buy single-use items like bombs or replace lost fighters. Completing levels faster earns you more resources to spend in the shop.\n\nDescription=Blue Defense! is a classic shooter game. You are the defender of the blue planet have to destroy the incoming red fleet. The planet fires a constant stream of bullets directly upwards. By tilting or even rotating the device you can aim at incoming enemies. The planet starts with roughly 6.7 billion inhabitants. Every impacting enemy kills part of the population and the game ends when the last inhabitant is killed.<br><br>The game is essentially endless, i.e. it is all about surviving as long as possible and getting a high score. The scoring is innovative; every enemy killed will increase a score multiplier and therefore increase the rate at which you get points in the future. Every hit your planet takes will halve the multiplier, however. There are a number of different levels but the order is random every time you play the game. The game also gets faster the further you progress. It is also possible to directly select and practice a particular level.\n\nDescription=Similar to games like Bridge Builder, the player has to build a bridge over a gap using limited resources with the goal of helping up to nine animals get across. The animals weigh differently with the parrot being the most light and the mammoth the most fat one so the player has to make sure his bridge is solid enough to take the weight - at least for a short amount of time. The bridges itself consist of planks of a certain maximum length which can only be connected to other planks or anchor points around the gaps.<br><br>To increase the stability without spending all the available wood, some levels feature a bungee-rope that can be connected to the anchor-points of the planks. Some levels on the other hand don't feature any anchor-points at all at the start. In these cases, the player has to look for destructible scenery in order to create anchor-points. And other levels even require the player to change the location of the sun to influence the water-level and reveal new anchor-points.<br><br>While the level is already completed once all the animals are safely across, to really master a level, the player has to do it using the least amount of planks and at the same collect all the golden eggs that are scattered around the level and may not be on the easiest path over the gap.\n\nDescription=Bubble Bash! is a modern take on the Bust-a-Move concept with a tropical setting. The playing field consists of several bubbles of different colours. Usually, the aim of the game is to remove all bubbles by linking three bubbles of the same colour to destroy them. You either only have a limited amount of time, or have to prevent the packs of bubbles from reaching the bottom of the screen. Bubbles are launched by the teamwork of three characters. Crab holds the bubble and the other two, Kale and Malia, place it on a pedestal and swing it into the field with a stick.<br><br>The game improves on the concept with the addition of balloons. Instead of a fixed rectangular playing field, there are different floating sections of bubbles held up by a balloon. Certain game types require you to hit the balloon or you can wait until two sections approach each other to launch a bubble in between and cause a chain reaction. Advanced strategies require you to launch bubbles against the bouncing sides of the field, or you can link bubbles near the top of the pack to drag along the ones underneath with the explosion. There are also birds flying by. These can be hit, but they also return all bubbles shot into the void to randomly insert them in the field. The direction of the bubbles you launch is shown by a small guiding line.<br><br>Next to the regular bubbles, there are (super) bomb bubbles (destroys everything it touches), mine bubbles (explodes when hit by another bubble), chameleon bubbles (takes the same colour as the bubbles it comes in contact with), colour bomb bubbles (when hit, it destroys all bubbles of a specific colour), ice bomb bubbles (freezes every bubble it hits), wave bubbles (destroys all bubbles on the same row), balloon inflate/deflate bubbles (lowers or rises the balloons), hidden bubbles (they only show their colour when hit), gift bubbles (releases a collectible item when destroyed), flower bubbles (creates a flower of bubbles of an identical colour), move bubbles, switch bubbles and solid or semi-solid bubbles that are hard to remove.<br><br>The main aim of the game is to help Kale and Malia discover treasure on Bubble Island. By completing sections of the island, you collect pieces of a map. Each section consists of three progressively unlocked tiers of games. After finishing the first two tiers with five games each, a boss level becomes available. The different variations require you to release balloons as fast as possible, burst all bubbles while the characters' platform rises near the top of the screen, clear a screen of bubbles hidden every few seconds, or shoot passing birds holding balloons. New levels and outfits for the characters are unlocked by completing games and gathering collectible items. There is a tutorial explaining the basics and the Crab Fever mode to keep playing a single game until you are bust. The game's theme song is a digitized version of Nena's 99 Luftballons.\n\nDescription=Bubble Shuffle is a word game with an undersea theme. Each level consists of a puzzle where a number of letters has been put in a bubble. It is up to the player to create as many words as possible using the available letters. When stuck, the bubbles can be shuffled to put them in a new order. Players can work their way up, starting with four letters, to more difficult levels with seven letters. To progress to a new level, a specific target number of words needs to be met, or one word using all letters.<br><br>There are four game modes, two timed and two without time restrictions. The game is hosted by the character Wordsworth Smartygills who guides the player through the game and provides clues. When discovering difficult words he also awards the player with seahorse pets.\n\nDescription=In this sequel to the popular 3D platformer, this time you play as the grasshopper Skip who has his backpack stolen by a Bully Bee. Together with Sam the Snail and Sally the Chipmunk, you perform mini-quests to get clues in order to retrieve your backpack. You have to collect items, release mice from mousetraps, catch fish and blow up anthills from the air. You maneuver balancing on a baseball through a firecracker field, race on top of radio controlled cars through a bedroom, and slide down gutters filled with leafs and pine cones. Befriending Buddy Bugs will also give you aid in how to defeat enemy bugs. <br><br>Skip can run, jump, fly and swim through various areas while collecting four-leaf clovers. You go through 10 different levels such as the front & back yards, the sewer, playroom, closet, gutter, garbage can, and park. With a leg-kick Skip can fend off foes such as bottle cap-throwing fleas, leather jacket-wearing flies, and oversized lawn gnomes. Catching butterflies will release power-ups such as health-giving strawberries, blueberries that fill up Skips flight meter, extra lives, protective shields, and killer bees that follow Skip around until he sets them on an enemy.\n\nDescription=BurgerTime Deluxe is a new version of the classic arcade game from 1982, developed for the casual market. As in the original, the player controls a cooking chef that must climb stairs to reach platforms and walk over food pieces, to make them fall and create a complete hamburgers on plates at the bottom of the screen. The cook must avoid touching the roaming enemies, anthropomorphic condiments and fried eggs that kill the main character. The foes can be destroyed with power-ups, or squashed by the falling burger pieces.<br><br>There are power-ups and bonus items scattered throughout the levels. The ketchup bottle kills all the enemies on the level, the salt shaker stops their movement for a few seconds, the ice cube makes the chef invulnerable for a few moments and freezes the adversaries, the burning cocktail also makes the cook invulnerable for a short time and burns the approaching foes, the bubble lifts the character directly to an upper level and the energy drink makes the chef temporally faster. Potato chips, ice-cream cones, cups of coffee and tea give bonus points, while French fries give extra lives. A Bonus mini-game appears between levels after collecting the letters that form the name of an ingredient, where the player has to find pairs of food items by uncovering several cooking pots, guide the chef through a maze and complete other similar challenges.<br><br>There are two modes in the computer version: in Story Mode, a plot is developed through cutscenes between levels, where two chefs called Peter Pepper and Sally Salt must help their uncle to save the family's burger diner from Vinny Vinegar, the owner of a competing hot dog franchise. Quick Mode is closer to the arcade original, where the levels are randomly generated and the game ends when all the lives are spent. The iPhone version has only the Story Mode, with 60 levels and a smaller view area.\n\nDescription=Become a wiring expert with Cablink! Rotate each cable section and connect it up to the power source. As you connect each cable section to the power source, it will light up. When you're done, all the cables will be lit and the puzzle will be complete. Each puzzle has an ideal number of moves it can be completed in - aim for this set number of moves as your goal.<br><br>Cablink's difficulty can be customized to your liking with a variety of settings:<br><br>1. Twistier - makes the puzzle have more bends and path splits.<br>2. Blackout - hides the wires until they are connected up.<br>3. Hex Board - creates a hexagonal version of the board for a tougher challenge.<br>4. wrapping - wraps the cables around the board, making for an even trickier puzzle.<br><br>Cablink also allows you to generate codes for the puzzles you're playing, and share them with friends to challenge them. Who can get the best score?\n\nDescription=After many years of prosperity, the people of Atlantis forgot and neglected their patron god, Poseidon. In anger, Poseidon removed the seven crystals of power that gave Atlantis its prosperity and sealed the Altar of Poseidon so they could not easily be replaced. He then scattered the seven crystals in seven lands: Rome, Greece, Troy, Phoenicia, Babylon, Egypt and Carthage. You must unseal the Altar of Poseidon and solve the puzzles of all seven lands to restore all the crystals of power and save Atlantis. Will you heed the Call of Atlantis?<br><br>Call of Atlantis is a match three and hidden object puzzle game and the sequel to The Rise of Atlantis. Using you mouse, you must first drag items to the altar seals, like a feather, plant, sunflower, etc., to break each seal. Next, travel to the first land, Rome, to solve its puzzles. On the match three puzzles, you must swap two cells to create a row of three or more of the same. There are pieces of an item that you must collect by making them get to the bottom of the puzzle. You can also collect bonuses, like the Bomb of the Titans, that destroys all the cells in a specified area, or the Lightning of Zeus, that destroys all of one type of selected cell everywhere on the puzzle. If you make enough groups of four or more items, you will charge a power up that, when activated, randomly destroys several cells in the puzzle. Do not delay in that the match three puzzles are timed.<br><br>In the hidden object puzzles, you will have four items that have been broken into pieces and the pieces scattered about a picture. You must locate and click each piece so as to collect the four items. Once all the items of a land have been collected, you must place them in their correct spots of a picture to retrieve the crystal but the crystal then shatters. Now you must return to the picture and locate and click each shard of the crystal to restore it and place it in the altar. Once you have returned the crystal to the altar, it is off to the next land.\n\nDescription=Call of Duty: World at War - Zombies is an iPhone and iPod Touch title that is based on a mini game from the console and PC release, Call of Duty: World at War made by Treyarch.<br><br>In the game you play a US soldier who finds himself in an abandoned building in the middle of wasteland. Nazi uniformed zombies start to move in from the mist surrounding the wrecked property and the player must try to stay alive as they batter their way in. Players get points from killing the hordes of undead, these can be spent on buying new weapons and opening new areas of the building.<br><br>The gameplay is a classic FPS experience with three different control types: a touch screen/free look; a dual stick (emulating the console experience); and an accelerometer input - a first for FPS's on the iPhone.<br><br>Call of Duty: World at War: Zombies has a co-op mode that allows up to four players to play over a wireless network or online (or 2 player with bluetooth). The game shipped with only one map but a downloadable content framework was announced which would allow new maps to be made available in the future.\n\nDescription=In Car Jack Streets, player take the role of Randal Meyers. Randal has a big problem: he owes the Italian mafia a million dollars. The mobs can't wait so Randal has to either pay them $50,000 each week or get killed. The player therefore has to do whatever he can to earn as much money as possible, whether it's through taxi driving, car theft, assassinations or pizza delivery. Failing to reach the weekly payments will lead to game over.<br><br>The game is similar to the original Grand Theft Auto (the development team actually consists of former DMA Design employees). As with that game, it's a mix of a action and a racing game viewed from a top-down perspective, where players get to explore the city either by foot or behind the wheel of numerous vehicles. Cash is earned by doing jobs for the different gangs in the city. For each day the player is offered four different criminal jobs and in addition to these, jobs like taxi driving and pizza delivery are always available. To help the player get to the right locations a GPS is available."
