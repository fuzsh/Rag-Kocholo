        "text": "There’s a lot happening with the Jurassic Park/Jurassic World franchise lately: sequels, prequels, video games, animated shows, and… remakes?\n\nJurassic World 4 Updates\n\nJurassic World 4 (2025) is now halfway through filming and fans can’t wait to sink their teeth into the new movie when it hits theaters next July. The film stars the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Scarlett Johansson, who’ll be leading a fresh cast into “a new Jurassic era”.\n\nAlongside Johansson, the new dino fodder includes Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer), Rupert Friend (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (Dead Boy Detectives), Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs Lopez), and Mahershala Ali (The Green Book).\n\nNo legacy actors are expected to return (so we hope you said your goodbyes to Jeff Goldblum, Chris Pratt, Sam Neill, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Laura Dern in 2022’s Jurassic World Dominion); but Jurassic World 4 does reunite several creatives from previous films.\n\nJurassic Park (1993) scribe David Koepp might have been killed by a T-Rex during his cameo in 1997’s The Lost World: Jurassic Park (which he also wrote the screenplay for), but he’s been regurgitated for Jurassic World 4 with several other Jurassic Park veterans.\n\nThere’s Jurassic World trilogy producers Patrick Crowley and Frank Marshall, executive producer Steven Spielberg (who directed the first two films and was EP on the last four), and, though not quite Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), real-life paleontologists Steve Brusatte and Jack Horner.\n\nRumored to be titled Jurassic World: Rebirth (going off a recent trademark filming made by Universal Pictures/Amblin Entertainment), the seventh film in the long-running franchise is being helmed by Gareth Edwards (Godzilla, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story).\n\nBut that’s all we currently know about Jurassic World 4. We don’t know anything about the plot or where the film even fits in with the wider franchise. The bare-bones logline per Variety suggests that it takes place after Dominion, but it hasn’t been confirmed either way.\n\nStill, regardless of what the film is about, they had us at “Jurassic”. In fact, there are three other Jurassic Park/Jurassic World installments also in development. But “hold onto your butts” — one of those upcoming entries is actually a remake of a failed 2001 sequel.\n\nRelated: ‘Jurassic World 4’ Everything We Know: Plot, Cast, Release Date, Trailer, and News\n\nJurassic Park III Rendered the Franchise Extinct\n\n23 years ago, Jurassic Park III (2001) hit theaters. It follows Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), who’s kidnapped by bumbling divorced couple Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H Macy and Téa Leoni) so that he can help them find their son Eric (Trevor Morgan) who went missing while parasailing with his stepfather near Isla Sorna, AKA Site B six weeks ago.\n\nBursting at the seams with all sorts of exciting new dinosaurs (namely Spinosaurus) and with non-stop action sequences from start to finish, the film provided plenty of summer blockbuster fun for audiences. But, sadly, it failed to impress fans of the first two films.\n\nDirected by Joe Johnston (Jumanji, Captain America), Jurassic Park III had a troubled production (which is well-documented), which includes several rewrites, absent executive producers, directors thinking about quitting, and, ultimately, filming without a completed script.\n\nSomehow, though, the 2001 sequel is surprisingly coherent, but the real problem in the finished product is the overall quality compared to the first two films.\n\nWhile the film grossed $368.8M against its $93 budget, it wasn’t enough to stop the series from going into extinction for 14 years, until Universal Pictures and director Colin Trevorrow brought it back to life in the form of Jurassic World (2015) with a complete rebranding of the IP.\n\nBut Jurassic Park III wasn’t the only sequel destined for release in 2001. Another was “Jurassic Park: Survival” — but that one never saw the light of day. Inspired by the 2001 film, the action-adventure video game faced an even more troubled production.\n\nDeveloped by Savage Entertainment and set to be published by Konami, the game was due to be released on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in November 2001. It would have followed David Vaughn, the member of a security team, as the lead, who must survive dinosaurs on Site B.\n\nThough originally based on Jurassic Park III, as the 2001 film was in production at the time the game was being developed, this made the tie-in elements difficult. So it was decided that it would only be inspired by the film and instead act as a sequel in its own right.\n\nThe game was heavily marketed, with screenshots and even a trailer preceding its eventual cancelation. But the project went extinct for a number of reasons, from Universal being dissatisfied with its progress and citing poor animations as one of their concerns, to Savage revealing conflicts with Vivendi-Universal due to lack of fundings to the developers.\n\nOver the following year, there was a lot of back and forth over whether or not the game would push forward with a new developer, but, as we know, it never happened, and the Jurassic title was lost to the sands of time like a dinosaur fossil that refuses to be discovered.\n\nBut, as the tagline for The Lost World: Jurassic Park reads, “something has survived”.\n\nRelated: ‘Jurassic Park’ Official Sequel: Everything We Know\n\nThe Upcoming Jurassic Park Installment\n\n“Jurassic Park: Survival” has been given new life. Perhaps not in its original form (just like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park or Jurassic World, which are genetically altered iterations of their ancestors), but a far more refined version is now heading for all major games consoles.\n\n“Jurassic Park: Survival” (TBA) is an upcoming first-person action-adventure video game from Saber Interactive (publisher and developer).\n\nWhile this is a completely different beast to the game of the same name from 2001 — it’s not in third-person, it doesn’t dovetail off the events of Jurassic Park III, and it takes place on Isla Nublar and not Sorna, for a start — it’s still, technically, a remake.\n\nAfter all, there must be a reason why the developers have chosen to keep the title “Jurassic Park: Survival”. Like the 2001 game, the new one follows a single character who must face InGen dinosaurs alone on an island using nothing but their wit and resources to survive.\n\nThe biggest difference, however, besides gameplay mechanics (and the fact that it, naturally, looks a million times better), is that it takes place “the day after the events of the beloved 1993 Jurassic Park film,” following “InGen scientist Dr. Maya Joshi, who was unable to evacuate Isla Nublar,” per the official website.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Jurassic Park: Survival” below, per Jurassic World YouTube:\n\nRelated: ‘Jurassic Park: Survival’ Trailer Breakdown\n\n“Jurassic Park: Survival” will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. There’s no release date for the game, but it’s expected to arrive sometime in 2025.\n\nJurassic World 4 will be released in theaters on July 2, 2025."
