        "text": "Joe Johnston, the director behind films such as The Rocketeer, October Sky, and Captain America: The First Avenger, is set to helm a $100 million sci-fi film in China called Starfall.\n\nDeadline simply describes the film as \"an actioner that takes place on a space station.\" It's a pretty vague plot description because we have no idea what events will take place on that space station. We know it will be a big spectacle film, though.\n\nLorenzo Di Bonaventura (Transformers) is producing the film, and the script is being written by David Coggeshall, who has worked on the MTV series Scream. The film will be shot at Wandaâ€™s Qingdao Studios, which is a new China studio that boasts a 56,000-square-foot green screen stage.\n\nI've always liked Johnston's films, and it's great to see him get the opportunity to make another big movie. I can't wait to learn more about it and see how this turns out!"
