        "text": "There’s something magical about the movies we loved as children. They drew us in, sparked our imaginations, and made us believe anything was possible. Sometimes when we grow up, that magic fades, and we can see the cracks and imperfections in our once-favorite films. But other times, the movies enchant us again, pulling us back to where we were when we first saw them. For us, Jumanji (1995) is one of those movies.\n\nLoosely based on the 1981 Caldecott-winning book by Chris Van Allsburg, Jumanji is a mid-90s special effects marvel, led by an excellent cast, and supported by an eerie and exciting score. It seamlessly blends magic and suspense in such a way, that the audience remains on the edges of their seats, unable to predict what terrors the game will unleash next. But among the strange and serious nature of the film, there’s a sense of humor that lightens the way. For example, Robin Williams plays a 40-something man-child that has been stranded in the jungle for two decades, leading a group of reluctant board game players to the end of the story, all while avoiding monkeys, mosquitoes, and a very annoyed police officer.\n\nSo, come and play with us and we will find a way to leave our world behind…in Jumanji!\n\nSummary\n\nIn 1969, Alan Parrish mysteriously disappeared. Ever since that day, the Parrish family home has been abandoned. Twenty-six years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the house with their Aunt Nora, trying to ignore the rumors that Allan was murdered and his body is located in the walls of the house.\n\nOne day, Peter discovers a board game called Jumanji while exploring the house. As he and Judy begin to play, they find that there’s something strange and sinister about the game. With each turn, Jumanji conjures up a real-life trial from gigantic mosquitoes to a hoard of trouble-making monkeys. With one roll of the dice, Peter even brings back Alan Parrish himself, who explains that the only way to get rid of the terrors wreaking havoc on their home is to finish the game.\n\nThe Book\n\nThe director, Joe Johnston, created the original design for Boba Fett!\n\nRobin Williams proved to be very popular with the residents of Keene New Hampshire, where Jumanji was shot. Locals in the city welcomed the star with open arms and after filming, Williams was actually presented with the keys to the city by the town’s mayor in 1994.\n\nThe city still remembers him very fondly and upon news of his passing, theaters around the city had screenings of Jumanji to honor him. Additionally, the Parrish Shoes sign still remains in its original location, and many fans left flowers and photos of Williams underneath it.\n\nAs a prank, Williams once told fans that the jungle of Jumanji was an island in the Caribbean saying they should “get their tickets early”.\n\nIn 2011, Robin Williams recorded an audiobook for the book's 30th edition to coincide with its release.\n\nConclusion\n\nJumanji is a non-stop thrill ride that might not *literally* suck you in, but it certainly will hold your attention. It’s simultaneously the coolest thing any child could imagine, and one of the most terrifying. Even after watching the grueling trials faced by Alan Parrish and the\n\nother players, many of us would still be tempted to play the game.\n\nJumanji is a perfect storm of incredible acting, a fascinating story, groundbreaking visual effects and an unbelievably charming score. The film never shies away from being strange and surreal, with its elements of humor and emotional depth. By the end of the game, audiences have fallen in love with the characters, and embrace the ever-so wonderful concept of being in control of our own fate. The moment Robin Williams calls out “Jumanji” is one of those incredible movie moments that stays with us forever.\n\nSo go spend some time in Jumanji. Be careful though, it’s a movie you should only start if you intend to finish."
