Krista is a, native Californian, who grew up travelling the country at the age of eight for competitive swimming. Finishing out her career as an All American Swimmer in the state of California. She is now a stunt performer and stunt coordinator, most recently working on Killers of the Flower moon and the series Reservation Dogs.Â\n\nSo here's my conversation with Krista.
