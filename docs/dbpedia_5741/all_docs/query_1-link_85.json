Hired to drive the beast from Colorado to San Francisco in less than 15 hours. Kowalski goes on a speed-filled existential trip with hippies, thieves, nudist bikers, snake handlers, and so many cop cars to wreck. Color, 99 minutes.\n\nSaturday, May 25, 2024 2pm\n\n“It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” (MGM, 1963)\n\nHop into a seat and join the crowd on this zany, cameo-crazy treasure hunt through Southern California! The race is on when a dying convict reveals the location of his hidden fortune to a group of madcap motorists who decide their impromptu expedition to find the loot is “every man for himself!” Director Stanley Kramer’s biggest box office hit is complete with overture, entr’acte, and exit music, plus a star-studded cast led by Spencer Tracy as (it must be mentioned) Captain T.

In this unsettling Dutch thriller, a young couple’s holiday in France comes to a tragic end when she disappears without a trace. Her boyfriend, Rex, embarks on a years-long search driven by an obsession worthy of a Hitchcock film. Uncover the truth about Saskia’s fate and the disturbing forces behind it. You will not soon forget the haunting conclusion. Director George Sluizer is best known for directing this film and, five years later, its equally chilling English-language remake starring Jeff Bridges, Kiefer Sutherland, and Sandra Bullock.
