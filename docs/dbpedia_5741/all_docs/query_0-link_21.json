        "text": "It’s funny, as the release date for The Avengers slowly draws nearer, I’m starting to realize more and more the fact that there’s very little chance of it being shitty.\n\nI have a great deal of love for Marvel comics, so just getting a chance to see the characters of that universe being brought to life in 200 million dollar budgeted films is enough to make me happy.\n\nIt doesn’t matter so much if the acting is great, or the plot deeply layered, as long I get to see the spirit and energy of the characters brought to life, there’s very little chance I’ll walk away from an Avengers movie wanting my money back.\n\nThen again, I would’ve said the same about Transformers, that is, until Michael Bay dumped ass all over my childhood and raped my wallet…\n\nTWICE.\n\nThat being said, while it’s a bit difficult to determine exactly what the plot of the movie is based on the trailer, (as should be the case, given that it’s only the first theatrical trailer) in many ways I applaud the marketing folks over at Marvel/Disney for cramming in screen time for virtually all of the heavy hitters that have been confirmed to be appearing in the film.\n\nTom Hiddleston’s Loki appears to be the central villain of the film, though based on the uncertain events at the conclusion of Captain America, in my mind it’s entirely possible that Red Skull could have a hand in things as well.\n\nMy bet is, he does.\n\nGiven the Hulk’s unstable nature, as well as the plot of the first Avengers comic, I’m guessing he’s going to end up being manipulated by Loki at some point; resulting in a heel/face turn at some point in the film.\n\nSpeaking of the Hulk, his reveal at the end of the trailer was well utilized, as he’s the one confirmed Avenger we really haven’t seen up to this point.\n\nDespite no shortage of explosions and FX shots though, I can’t help but feel that this first trailer was cut from footage of a yet unfinished product.\n\nAt least I hope that’s the case.\n\nThere are numerous shots that feel very “static,” lacking in energy and purpose to a degree that they feel almost amateurish.\n\nSeriously man, count how many shots there are of single characters, standing in boring and vacant locations.\n\nChances are you’ll run out of fingers and toes on that one.\n\nAt the same time, many of the FX shots, particularly some of the exploding cars, look to me as if they are meant to be templates for CGI compositing.\n\nIt’s rare to see explosions in Hollywood films these days where the detonation source and materials seem plainly visible, and as such; I wouldn’t be surprised if the aforementioned exploding car shots are awaiting some sort of energy beam effects to cover all that up.\n\nIt’s funny, as I write this nitpicky article, I can’t help but be reminded of the early trailers for Iron Man.\n\nI remember seeing the early TV spots for Iron Man, and being largely unimpressed.\n\nI don’t know if you recall, but the pacing of these commercials was very weak, and some of the effects shots were not quite finished, resulting in advertisements that didn’t at all reflect the awesomeness of the final product.\n\nCompare this early TV spot:\n\nTo the later released full trailer here:\n\nNot only is the composition better, the special effects, particularly in the “tank shot” sequence, are rendered with more detail and smoother animation.\n\nWhen you’re dealing with effects heavy films like this, it’s entirely possible that the computer effects crew will end up working on the project up until the release date.\n\nWhile I could be wrong, I’m really hoping this is the case with The Avengers, as while it looks totally acceptable at this point, it doesn’t look at all exceptional.\n\nWhat else can I say about this?:\n\nCaptain America’s costume looks a little bit too stretchy and “pajama-y” for me to give it a thumbs up.\n\nHank Pym should get a nod or a cameo, as I’d love to see The Vision or Ultron show up in a movie someday.\n\nKudos to the marketing department for excluding any and all shots of the Avengers working together or “assembling,” as that’s one of those oh-so-important fanboy moments that’s probably best left for the theaters.\n\nHere’s hoping Agent Coulson gets an action beat somewhere in there, ’cause he’s been consistently fun over the years.\n\nI’ve got my fingers crossed that the always solid Jeremy Renner won’t suck as Hawkeye… ‘Cause let’s face it: he’s Hawkeye.\n\nFor once I’m actually hoping Joss Whedon decides to “George Lucas” his movie with distracting lights and colors in every shot.\n\nSeriously man, this is the fuckin’ Avengers movie.\n\nIt’s only gonna’ premiere once, and you’ve been hyping it for like 4-5 years now.\n\nGo balls out, or don’t waste my motherfuckin’ time.\n\nNo Avengers film, or any film for that matter, should have boring-ass shots of The Black Widow standing ever so casually in front of pitiful exploding buses, or for that matter; Nick Fury firing rocket launchers while standing in front of my dad’s garage.\n\nAnyway, that’s about all I’ve got to say on this one, hopefully it turns out fun for everyone, ’cause at this point if any one film this coming year could hope make good on that promise, it’d have to be The Avengers.\n\nIf it does in fact start to suck when I’m in the theater though, I know exactly the phrase that’s going to come to mind:\n\nThough it hardly qualifies as “big news” in most circles, this past Sunday marked the television debut of the 30 second Captain America: The First Avenger teaser:\n\nOh yeah, and something called “The Superbowl” happened too.\n\nThe Packers won, the Steelers lost, and balance has been brought to The Force; at least until the next season.\n\nAnyway, given that the Captain America preview was a trim 30 seconds in length, and was intentionally edited so as to keep most of the major details of the film foggy at best; here are my thoughts on what I saw:\n\nThe CGI used to reduce Chris Evan’s heroic physique to that of the undersized pre-Project Rebirth Steve Rogers appears fairly convincing at this point.\n\nWhile most likely a minor element of the film, technical gimmicks like this have always fascinated me; particularly when they work, I.E. Lt. Dan’s amputated legs in Forrest Gump.\n\nWe’ll see how it turns out on the big screen.\n\nMoving on, I’m pleased to note that nothing looks cheap about the movie as of yet.\n\nSome of the costuming for Thor had an unfortunate, plastic-y look, but the period elements, and overall production design of Captain America seems pretty slick thus far.\n\nOf particular note was the set for the Project Rebirth sequence, not only because it’s the only set we really get a good look at in the teaser; but also because it genuinely looks pretty good.\n\nOne thing I was afraid of seeing in a Captain America film, was gaudy or needlessly extravagant production design.\n\nThankfully, and remember this is just me going by what we’ve seen thus far; this seems to be a non-issue in The First Avenger.\n\nMost everything in the teaser points to an almost Rocketeer-esque (also directed by Joe Johnston) marriage of the pulpy comic book aesthetic and appropriately utilitarian, or at least practical, design elements.\n\nTruth be told, I loved The Rocketeer back in the day, so if Captain America can capture that same gleeful energy, I think we’re in for a good show.\n\nAnother thing worth noting in the teaser, is the brief glimpse we get of the Red Skull, as played by Hugo Weaving.\n\nRed Skull is a character who has undergone a great deal of variations in his design.\n\nIn his early appearances, as well as the current Steve Epting version of the character; Red Skull had what I like to call a “toad face”.\n\nHis eyebrows were exagerrated and protruding, like a neanderthal; but the “toad face” part of his design came from his broad, perpetually frowning mouth.\n\nMy personal favorite design of the character, was the one featured prominently in the early 90’s (go figure) that featured a very straightforward skull-shaped, well, skull.\n\nIn the case of the movie, it would appear that the design was designed primarily to capitalize on Hugo Weaving’s unique facial structure, while retaining some of the classic “toad face” features:\n\nIn other words, expect a bug-eyed, big forehead-ed Red Skull that looks more like Agent Smith than, well, a skull.\n\nI already voiced my opinion on the design decisions for the Captain America suit, as posted here; however there’s one last little detail I’d like to add to that, in the form of a comment from a friend of mine.\n\n“Chris Evans in the Captain America suit looks like Shaq from Steel.”\n\nWhile I was (sadly) inclined to agree in some respects, I still remain hopeful that Captain America will turn out to be a better film than the almost ludicrously ass-tastic Steel.\n\nEven so, if ever there was a comic character that was easy to fuck up, it’d have to be the Cap’n…\n\nAt this point, Captain America (along with Green Lantern) is poised to be my big summer movie this year, so keep your fingers crossed people, The Azn Badger commands it!\n\nLet’s get one thing straight:\n\nI like Captain America.\n\nI like his “patriotic weakling to walking symbol of hope and freedom” origin story.\n\nI like his old timey way, and how it juxtaposes so well with the often times annoying immature antics of today’s comic superheroes.\n\nI like his powers and abilities, as the range of his physical capabilities allows him to be “super,” while at the same time quite vulnerable.\n\nHell, as goofy as it can look at times, I even like his costume design.\n\nWhen I first heard that Chris Evans was going to be playing Cap in Captain America: The First Avenger movie, my initial reaction was to say:\n\n“Really? Chris Evans is in another comic book movie?”\n\nOff the top of my head, Chris Evans has been in 4 comic book movies, playing 3 different characters, with no less than 2 more roles down the road if you count the Captain America film in question, and his appearance in the upcoming Avengers film.\n\nMake no mistake, comic book movies as still very much “in” at the moment, and if anyone is making bank off of the trend, my guess is it would be Mr. Evans.\n\nNow, while that may have been my initial reaction to the Captain America casting news; my honest to God feelings on the matter were lodged somewhere in the valley between confusion and disbelief.\n\nTo date, I still can’t understand why he was chosen for the Captain America role.\n\nWith the exception of Street Kings, wherein he played a very vanilla and by the book cop; every role I’ve seen Evans in has had him cast as the “funny guy” or failing that, the “funny guy that can set himself on fire.”\n\nTruth be told, I’ve never been disappointed by any of his performances, not that that’s saying much; but the point is:\n\nUnless he’s hiding some well-concealed stoicism or acting range beneath his “funny guy” exterior, he just doesn’t seem like Cap to me.\n\nCaptain America is one of those characters that, to me; is more easily represented as a somewhat older man.\n\nWhile the First Avenger is most likely going to take place exclusively in the WWII era, when Steve Rogers was cutting his teeth on Nazis, for some reason I’ve always pictured Captain America as being one of those guys that’s been a manly man since the cradle.\n\nKind of like Charles Bronson, James Coburn, or Anthony Hopkins.\n\nI know It’s unfair of me to judge an actor, or a film for that matter; before it’s even had a trailer, but in my mind the actors that would have best played Captain America have already aged themselves out of the running.\n\nDespite a distinct lack of physicality, I always felt that Robert Redford could’ve made for a very effective Captain America.\n\nHis voice, face, hair color, acting ability and God given aura of gravitas would’ve gone a long way towards legitimizing the character and the film.\n\nNot only that, with movies like A River Runs Through It, and The Natural under his belt, he always had that all-American feel to him.\n\nSome people said the same of Kevin Costner.\n\nSaid people are of course, utterly retarded and full of shit, as Costner’s just about the most boring and vanilla pile of feces to ever walk the face of the Earth.\n\nSadly, “boring as shit” seems to describe far too many young actors these days.\n\nMaybe it’s just because they’re young, and seem to be cast more for their looks than their acting ability, but to me it seems like most of the big-budget blockbuster movie actors these days just seem to lack “character,” at least in a physical sense.\n\nWhen you look at the actors from back in the day, they had a look to them that lent a lot to their performances.\n\nNot only that, in the post-studio picture era, subtlety was an acting trait that was considered praise worthy among performers, a fact that has not changed since; but seemingly has eluded many of the young actors of today.\n\nI’m rambling.\n\nAnyway, at this point in time, The First Avenger seems like a pretty decent movie on paper.\n\nIt has a pretty strong cast, with Hugo Weaving sure to steal the show as The Red Skull, and a competent, if somewhat bipolar director at the helm in the form of Joe Johnston.\n\nIf Johnston gives us another Rocketeer or Jumanji, then Captain America’s gonna’ kick some serious ass.\n\nIf he gives us another Jurassic Park III though, then I just might have to sit this one out.\n\nIn either case, the man has shown considerable zeal for crafting old timey period films, not to mention he has a tremendous visual effects background, so if nothing else; the film will be pretty to look at…\n\nThat being said, on a final note, I’d just like to say that I sincerely disapprove of Marvel’s decision to rely on the Ultimate Universe for some of the visual stylings and character interpretations for their current and future films.\n\nI understand that the Ultimate Universe has not been confirmed to be used as direct source material for said films, but from what I’ve seen, that seems to the case.\n\nMaybe it’s because the Ultimate Universe was never targeted at my age group, as it’s intended audience is that of younger, less seasoned comic fans, but honestly I’ve never seen the appeal of it.\n\nI can understand Marvel’s desire to use the black Nick Fury, as Samuel L. Jackson is the bees knees in the eyes of dorky haole kids, but to be perfectly honest; it makes me sad that both the Captain America and Thor movie’s character designs have drawn influence from the Ultimate Universe.\n\nLong story short, Ultimate Thor is okay, but Ultimate Captain America is absolutely hideous in my eyes."
