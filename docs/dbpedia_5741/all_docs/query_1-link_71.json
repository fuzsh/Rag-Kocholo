        "text": "A new Jurassic World movie is in the works, and now another lead may have been found. Deadline reports that the star of Netflix's The Lincoln Lawyer, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, is in talks to star in the new dinosaur movie alongside Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey.\n\nGareth Edwards, who directed the Star Wars movie Rogue One, is directing the new Jurassic World film. The movie is set for release on July 2, 2025, and Jurassic Park's David Koepp is penning the script.\n\nGarcia-Rulfo found breakout success with Netflix's The Lincoln Lawyer. The show is now coming back for a third season, but a release date hasn't been announced yet.\n\nJurassic Park, which was based on the 1990 Michael Crichton novel, premiered in 1993 with Steven Spielberg directing. Spielberg came back to direct 1997's The Lost World, with Joe Johnston stepping in to direct 2001's Jurassic Park III. Universal brought the series back in 2015 with Jurassic World, which was followed by Fallen Kingdom (2018) and Dominion (2022).\n\nChris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard starred in the Jurassic World movies, but they're not expected to come back for the next one. Also not lined up to appear are the original trilogy's stars, including Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Laura Dern.\n\nSteven Spielberg, the mastermind behind the original Jurassic Park, will serve as executive producer on the Jurassic World movie."
