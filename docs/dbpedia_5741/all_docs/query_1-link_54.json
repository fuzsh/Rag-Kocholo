        "text": "It has been confirmed that Disney is rebooting ‘Honey, I Shrunk The Kids’ with director Joe Johnston and actor Josh Gad in talks. This was first reported back in May, but now it looks as though things are official.\n\nGad originated this film which is described as a “legecyequel.” He will play Nick Szalinksi, the son of Rick Moranis’ character, Wayne Szalinski, in the original trilogy. Nick appeared in those films as well, portrayed by Robert Oliveri.\n\nThe original ‘Honey, I Shrunk the Kids’ was the first film Johnston ever directed, so he will be going back to his roots with this reboot. Since then, he directed ‘The Rocketeer’, ‘Jumanji’ (the original), ‘October Sky’, and ‘Captain America: The First Avenger’ among others. Most recently, for Disney, Johnston handled the extensive reshoots on last year’s ‘The Nutcracker and the Four Realms‘, which had previously been helmed by Lasse Hallström. Johnston’s contributions were so heavy that he was given a director credit.\n\nThis will be a theatrical film, not a project for Disney+. This could also kick off a new franchise. The original ‘Honey, I Shrunk the Kids’ was released in 1989 and became Disney’s highest-grossing live-action movie. That was followed by ‘Honey, I Blew Up the Kid’ in 1992, and ‘Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves’ (direct-to-video) in 1997. There was also a syndicated TV series, ‘Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show’ which aired for three seasons from 1997-2000. Johnston was not involved with the sequels or TV show.\n\nDavid Hoberman and Todd Lieberman are producing through their Mandeville Films and Television banner with Todd Rosenberg (‘All My Life’) penning the script. Hoberman and Lieberman acted as producers for the new Amazon film ‘The Aeronauts‘, which opens in theaters this weekend, before going to streaming later this month.\n\nGad’s voice can currently be heard in theaters in ‘Frozen 2’.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you excited about a new spin on ‘Honey, I Shrunk the Kids’?"
