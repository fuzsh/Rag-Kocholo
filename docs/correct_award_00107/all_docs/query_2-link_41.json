Despite the years spent as editor of the literary journal Host do Domu, in Brno, Skácel was a loner, impervious to the dictates of artistic trends. Surrounded by silence, his poems burrow under history to reach arcane territories inhabited by myth. His strategy of radical subtraction aims at creating a form of absolute transparency to let through being with the immediacy of a physical sighting. In the last year of his life, Skácel received the Petrarca Prize for Poetry and the Prize for Central European Literature. He died ten days before the Velvet Revolution. We are indebted to Promeny (27/1/1990) for the Czech text of the Lethean quatrain, the poet’s epitaph, and for the Teiresias poem.

Her literary career runs the span of years represented by the nine poets in her section. In 1934, her novella, První Písmena (First Letters), immediately admitted her into the Prague Linguistic Circle. Her experiments with the novelistic form anticipate the postmodernist assault on the narrative line. The poems presented here come from her last volume of verse, Sesity Josefiny Rykrové (The Notebooks of Josephine Rykrová, 1981). In a prose coda to another poem in the collection she writes (in English, next to her Czech poem): “Since I was a teenager I wanted to be a writer. I preferred prose and I never thought I could write poetry. I preferred prose because it spoke of people other than myself.” Yet she did write poetry, publishing five volumes during her years in Cambridge. The Notebooks, the most original of them, cast autobiography into a form that mixes poetry with prose comment, in a mutual exchange of attributes. The speaker, moving in and out of her chosen persona, notes the patina on lived-in things and places, searching for the elusive present through layers of memory.\n\nHEATHER SPEARS is a Canadian writer and artist living in Copenhagen. She has held lots of solo exhibitions and published 11 collections of poetry, 3 novels and several books of drawings.

His novels—Barefoot, The Gypsy Tribe, Crazy Forest, and The Gamble with Death—have been translated into many languages. His poetry, which he wrote all his literary life, gained its greatest acclaim in his later years, and is distinguished by the simple beauty of its diction and its focus on human mortality and aspirations. Stancu’s novels and poems, like those of Thomas Hardy, are complementary parts of an arresting literary vision.\n\nSAVIANA STANESCU was born in Bucharest in 1967. A unique dramatic voice, postmodern, feminist, humorous, and sly, she is a poet and playwright; she is also a drama critic, a cultural journalist with a TV talk show, and an editor at the Romanian Literature Museum, Bucharest.

Since 2001 he is also the poetry editor for Vehicule Press’s Signal Editions.\n\nSTATIUS (PUBLIUS PAPINIUS STATIUS) The Roman poet was born at Naples, but lived and wrote at Rome. He was roughly contemporary with the Emperor Domitian (51-96 CE), during whose reign (81-96 CE) he composed all his works. These include the Thebaid, an epic about the war between the sons of Oedipus for the throne of Thebes; the Silvae, a collection of occasional poems; and the unfinished Achilleid, an epic on the life of the hero Achilles. The Silvae celebrate the private lives and public careers of his friends and those in power, including the Emperor. Typically these are long poems and often contain marvelously detailed descriptions—one friend’s villa on a cliff overlooking the Bay of Naples, another’s villa straddling a river at Tivoli, a newly installed colossal equestrian statue of the Emperor, and so on. Statius pioneered this kind of descriptive poetry and was the first Roman poet to celebrate luxury rather than condemn it. These poems also sometimes include witty mythological vignettes in which the gods intervene in the lives of Statius’ friends, as when Venus plays matchmaker between a fellow-poet and his bride-to-be. “The Insomniac’s Prayer” (Silvae 5.4, usually titled “Sleep”) seeks divine intervention rather than telling about it, and is also unusual in being both brief and personal.\n\nPAUL STATT holds a BA in European Studies from Amherst College.

A committed Zionist, he earned his country’s highest literary honor.
