        "text": "Jaroslav Seifert (born Sept. 23, 1901, Prague, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now in Czech Republic]—died Jan. 10, 1986, Prague, Czech.) was a poet and journalist who in 1984 became the first Czech to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nSeifert made a living as a journalist until 1950, but his first book of poetry, Město v slzách (“Town in Tears”), was published in 1920. His early proletarian poetry reflects his youthful expectations for the future of communism in the Soviet Union. As he matured, however, Seifert became less enchanted with that system of government, and his poetic themes began to evolve. In Na vlnách T.S.F. (1925; “On the Waves of T.S.F.”) and Slavík zpívá špatně (1926; “The Nightingale Sings Badly”), more lyrical elements of so-called pure poetry were evident. In 1929 Seifert broke with the Communist Party.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form"
