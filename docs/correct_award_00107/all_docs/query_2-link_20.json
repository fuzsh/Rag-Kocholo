        "text": "Nobel Prize Winners of Czech or Slovak Ancestry Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. INTRODUCTION The Nobel Prize is an international monetary prize. The award was established by the 1895 will and estate of Swedish chemist and inventor Alfred Nobel (1833-1896). It was first awarded in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace in 1901. An associated prize, The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was instituted by Sweden's central bank in 1968 and first awarded in 1969. The Nobel Prizes in the specific disciplines (physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature) and the Prize in Economics, which is commonly identified with them, are widely regarded as the most prestigious award one can receive in those fields. 1 In 1888 Alfred Nobel's brother Ludvig (1831-1888) 2 died while visiting Cannes and a French newspaper erroneously published Alfred's obituary. It condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death. The obituary stated “Le marchand de la mort est mort“ (The merchant of death is dead) and went on to say, \"Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.\" On 27 November 1895, at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the Nobel Prizes, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. He died of a stroke on 10 December 1896 at Sanremo, Italy. After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel's will gave 31,225,000 Swedish kronor (equivalent to about 1.8 billion kronor or 250 million US dollars in 2008) to fund the prizes. Generally, it has been thought that only two Czechs have won this prestigious prize, namely Jaroslav Heyrovsky (1890-1967) in chemistry in 1959 and Jaroslav Seifert (1901- 1986) in literature in 1984. This paper will demonstrate that there have been other Czech natives, as well as one Slovak native who received this prize and even a larger number of Czech and Slovak descendants abroad.

The first two prizes were awarded in 1905. Two prizes were also awarded in 1947 and 1973 and three prizes in 2004.
