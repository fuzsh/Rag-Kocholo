She cared for her mother through a Parkinson’s diagnosis before majoring in journalism at the University of Western Ontario. She ultimately dropped out of school before she married in 1951 and had four children, one of whom died at birth. She and James Munro divorced in 1972 and she married geographer Gerald Fremlin four years later (they were married until his death in 2013). She spoke often of her life as a mother, as well as the struggles of balancing parenthood with her career. In 2009, she shared she'd had a heart bypass surgery and had been treated for cancer, according to the New York Times. She did not travel to Sweden to receive her Nobel in 2013, saying she was too frail for the journey.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nNytimesAlice Munro, Nobel Laureate and Master of the Short Story, Dies at 92Washington PostAlice Munro, Nobel Prize-winning short-story 'master,' dies at 92"
