Seifert was the “Grand Old Man” of modern Czech poetry. He may also be thought of as the embodiment of a literary type which has died out in most Western countries — the national poet. Poetry is much more widely read and appreciated by Czechs than by the English-speaking public. Although there are only about ten million Czechs, the number of copies published — and sold — of works by Czech poets is frequently several times larger than that of American poets in the United States, which has a population twenty times greater. Or, to put it another way, perhaps fifty times as many books of poetry per capita are bought by Czechs than by Americans. In the Czech Republic, poetry is regarded as a normal, everyday activity. The names of famous poets are household words. Their works are widely quoted and discussed. They are respected by the “people” as well as by the elite; their support has always been solicited and their hostility feared by rulers. When Seifert was seriously ill, crowds assembled outside his house and stood in silence, in a spontaneous show of concern and respect. Czech poets are expected to express the deep feelings of the nation about matters of everyday life — love, nature, and death — and also to speak out about major public issues. The nation awaited their poetic comments about such national events as the 11\n\ndeath of President Masaryk in 1937, the occupation of the country by the Germans in 1939, and successive landmarks of Czech history. Behind Seifert’s poetry lies the long history of Czech literature, which had several periods of special prominence: the Middle Ages, the seventeenth century, the Romantic period, and the late nineteenth century. In the first half of the twentieth century, lyrical poetry dominated the Czech literary scene. A whole pleiad of poets wrote outstanding works, which, if written in a world language such as English, French, or German, might be known internationally. There were some outstanding novels and plays during this period (those of Capek, Hasek, and Vancura), but it was into poetry that the main energy of Czech literature flowed. Modem Czech poetry is marked by freely associative imagery and intense emotionality. Because this poetry relies heavily on the sounds of the Czech language — the patterns of vowels and consonants, lengths of vowels, stress — it is difficult for transators to bring some of its genius into other languages. This, too, has kept Czech poetry from becoming better known abroad.\n\nII A brief survey of Seifert’s life and literary activities may be helpful towards a better understanding and appreciation of the translations of his works. Jaroslav Seifert was born on September 23, 1901 in a working-class neighborhood of Prague called 2izkov. Through¬ out his life, he liked to recall his childhood in a part of town marked by a strong proletarian flavor, with many tenements, railroad tracks, balconies, taverns, and even its own dialect or slang, comparable to the Cockney dialect of London. The tough, swaggering mannerisms of his Zizkov youth stayed with Seifert for a long time. The poet Frantisek Halas, later Seifert’s closest 12\n\nfriend, described their first encounter, in the Moravian capital of Brno: Seifert arrives. I cannot forget our meeting one noon in July. Across the street I see someone walking with a sailor’s stride. A warm scarf instead of a detachable collar, a pipe; he spits continually. In those days a poet inevitably looked like that. I walk towards him instinctively: “You are Seifert?” “You are from Zizkov?” I wasn’t from Zizkov, but he was Seifert.1\n\nSeifert’s mother was Catholic and his father an atheist and socialist. Seifert felt warmly towards both of them.2 Although his parents were poor, they were not destitute. Seifert was able to study in a gymnazium, an academic secondary school attended by only a minority of boys. He did not graduate, but left the gymnazium early and started working as a journalist and devoting himself to literature. Later he was to describe his beginnings as a poet with gentle self-mockery.3 With World War I not yet over and the future Czecho¬ slovakia still a province of Austria-Hungary, the teenaged Seifert wrote his first poems. His earliest poetry, often highly didactic, showed sympathy for the proletariat and for anarchism. When Czechoslovakia became independent in October 1918, Seifert associated with the left wing of the Social Democratic party, and became one of the first members of the Communist Party when it was organized in 1921. Seifert’s first volume of poetry, City in Tears, is usually considered the most proletarian work of all Czech poetry, but even there Seifert the poet prevailed over the man of politics. In his poetry, love held its own against fervor for revolutionary action. Revolutionaries whose priorities placed public commit¬ ment above private concerns disapproved of such passages in Seifert’s poetry as the following: Love is something huge You’ll find out If there were revolution in the whole wide world Still somewhere on green grass 13\n\nLovers would have time to hold hands and lean their heads towards one another. Seifert thought of revolution primarily as a source of future happiness for the poor, a people’s carnival, rather than organized political action and violence; love was stronger in him than hate.4 Some of his early poems were already outstanding in their utterly unpretentious simplicity and directness: I have a window a spring day floats in it like a boat with a pink flag on a river, I have a dog it has human eyes, I have a blue notebook and in it thirty-three beautiful names of girls. And so I won’t forget I have an empty box of shoe polish, a sad, dried-out flowerpot on the window sill, a flower in my buttonhole and tears in my heart. Some of Seifert’s modernist friends (Karel Teige, Stanislav Neumann) played a role in weaning him away from his earliest poetic style of proletarian poetry, and in bringing him into avantgarde artistic circles. In 1920 Seifert was one of the founders of a modernist group of artists and writers called Devetsil. The name is that of a medicinal herb or wildflower, and means etymo¬ logically “nine strengths,” or “nine forces.” In the 1920s, Seifert’s life and works were closely linked to this important group and to a related artistic movement called Poetism. The ambitious, boastful, highflown aspirations of Devetsil are suggested in a brief passage in its manifesto: Before all creative human work today stands the immense task of rebuilding the world anew. . . . Poets and thinkers stand shoulder to shoulder with revolutionary soldiers. Their task is 14\n\nthe same. . . . There is only one road towards tomorrow. . . . The art of yesterday, whether we call it Cubism, Futurism, Orphism, or Expressionism, considered that “the thing in itself’ was beautiful and that was enough.\n\nDevetsil urged going beyond “the thing in itself’ in a proletarian, communist direction. Poetism regarded life itself as an art form and aspired to include all the arts under its aegis. Its utopian aim was to fuse life with the arts, so that in the remote future art would become life and life art — in whatever sense one might interpret this lofty but vague goal. Its leading theoretician was Seifert’s friend Karel Teige. The 1920s were for Seifert and his friends a heady time of youthful, provocative, sometimes exhibitionist, always exuberant immersion in poetry, journalism, art, and political discussion. This close-knit group of young men and women were constantly meeting in cafes and bars to debate art and life, and producing remarkable works of art and literature. They felt (and they were) innovative, daring, and radical. Poetism sought a loosening of connections. Metaphors and ideas should play more freely; poetry was to be a game of the imagination with words. Continuities and clarity of references became blurred or disrupted altogether in the poems of Seifert’s Poetism period (as in the work of e. e. cummings): cigarette smoke climbs a tourist in the Alps sun and depth over a steep cliff the summit of Mont Blanc acrobatics of roses from the clouds rise to the stars the pillows of boredom drink them Poetry\n\n15\n\nThe movement was also saturated by the atmosphere of its physical setting: the lyrical, moody environment of the ancient city of Prague, with its river, bridges, parks, architectural monuents, and churches. Seifert’s poetry was always partic-ularly rich in descriptions of Prague. Seifert wrote for a variety of newspapers and reviews, several of them Communist ones. He also worked in a Communist bookshop and publishing house in Prague, and in the late 1920s edited a Communist illustrated magazine. Seifert's first book of poems, City in Tears, was published in 1921. Throughout the twenties, he continued to publish his own poetry, as well as translations of poetry by the Russian Symbolist poet Alexander Blok and by French poets such as Paul Verlaine and Guillaume Apollinaire. Seifert made a long journey, with his friend Teige, through Vienna to Northern Italy, Marseilles, and Paris, and revisited Paris twice more. He also traveled in the Soviet Union in 1925 and 1928. In the late 1920s, Seifert was beginning to sense that Devetsil had outlived its value for him and his friends. In 1929, together with eight other prominent Czech Communist writers, he signed a letter opposing the line which the new leadership of the Communist Party had adopted regarding culture. He was expelled from the Party (unlike some of his fellow signatories, he never rejoined) as well as from Devetsil. He then worked briefly as reporter and editor on various publications, such as the Socialist Democratic daily Pravo lidu. He wrote many volumes of poetry, and compiled and edited the works of Czech poets of the nineteenth century, of Vitezslav Halek and of Jan Neruda. In his books of poetry in 1929, 1933, and 1936, Seifert developed his characteristic use of euphony: his poems were often densely compressed, had a song-like quality, and empha¬ sized the resources of sound (intonation, rhyme, assonance, and alliteration). Poems which illustrate his delicate, evanescent, lyrical art include “The Wax Candle” (p. 43 below), “You have skin pale like a snowdrop ...” (p. 52), and “The Hands of Venus” (p. 49).\n\n16\n\nAround 1930, Seifert’s poetry reached a peak of song-like virtuosity. He used regular stanzaic forms, ingenious rhymes, and frequent refrains. The favorite subjects of his polished poems of this period were the beauty and tenderness of women and the fleetingness of love. In 1937, his volume entitled Eight Days expressed the sadness felt by most Czechs at the death of their first president, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, a philosopher and statesman who symbolized the democratic and independent spirit of the First Czechoslovak Republic. Put Out the Lights (1938), his next cycle of poems, was a poetic journal of the days first of excitement and then gloom when Hitler’s Germany menaced Czechoslovakia, when the Czechoslovak Army, mobilized and prepared for the defense of the country with the enthusiastic backing of the people, was ordered by President Benes, after the Munich Conference in September 1938, to abandon the national borders. In March 1939 the remainder of Czechoslovakia was occu¬ pied by the Nazi armies. Seifert published three volumes of poetry during the German occupation and World War II, in which he attempted to strengthen the nation’s resolve to survive with dignity. His poems expressed love for his homeland, for Prague, and for the Czech language, and they won the widest recognition yet from the Czech public. It was between 1939 and 1945 that he reached the status of unofficial national poet. His own perilous experiences during the last days of the German occupation in May 1945 are vividly described by him in his memoirs (pp. 232-238 below). With the liberation of the country in May 1945, Seifert again became very active in journalism. After a Communist govern¬ ment took over in February 1948, however, he found himself under attack as alien, bourgeois, and un-Communist, vilified in the press by adherents of socialist realism. He withdrew from public life. His publications were limited to editing the works of various Czech authors and to translating. His translation of the biblical Song of Songs was especially outstanding. After 1954, however, during a cultural thaw, selections from his past works began to be published, along with some new 17\n\npoetry. In 1956, during the period of liberalization in the Soviet Union, he spoke from the platform at the Second Congress of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers: “May we be truly the conscience of our people. Believe me, I am afraid we have not been that for quite a few years; we have not been the conscience of the masses, the conscience of millions; we have not even been the conscience of ourselves ... If anyone keeps silent about the truth, he is lying.” Seifert demanded that the transgressions of the Stalinist era be acknowledged and rectified, and the victims of injustice compensated. The poet who in the 1920s and 30s was known for his fragile love lyrics now became a spokesman for civic consciousness and public commitment. Seifert’s speech made a deep impression on the audience, as did the poet's physical appearance at the time. Seifert walked with difficulty, leaning on a cane. When he sat, however, he looked like a cliff: immovable, solid, firm. Also unforgettable were Seifert’s verses, Still evil rises Up the bone marrow of humanity Bespat with blood like the stairs from a dentist’s After the silence of a decade of serious illness, Seifert emerged with a surprising new poetic manner. In Concert on the Island (1965) and later works, he gave up much of his song-like intonations, rhyme, and metaphor, for the sake of simple, declarative, unadorned free verse. In 1967, during the Prague Spring days, he received a prize from the Czechoslovak Writers Publishing House, and in the same year was named National Artist of Czechoslovakia. In August 1968, armed intervention by the Soviets in Czechoslovakia spurred Seifert, who had been seriously ill, to rise from his sickbed, call for a taxi, and go to the building of the Union of Writers. The writers elected him acting chairman of the independent union. A year later, this union was dissolved. Isolated, sick, Seifert went on writing. His poems were typed and distributed in hundreds of samizdat copies. He lived in a Prague 18\n\nsuburb, helped anyone who called on him, and wrote remi¬ niscences of his long life as a poet. The reminiscences are a veritable encyclopaedia of Prague’s cultural life. Seifert mingles in them details of his private life with accounts of his sixty years of association with Czech writers, artists, and journalists. Ten passages from these reminiscences appear in this volume. Between 1968 and 1975, only selections from his old works were published inside Czechoslovakia, but a few of his new poems were published in Czech periodicals produced abroad. On August 16, 1976, in an open letter to the German novelist Heinrich Boll, Seifert asked for support for a Czech musical group that found itself under attack, and this letter was followed by the drafting and promulgation of Charter 77, of which Seifert was one of the original signers. With the passage of years, Seifert’s new works were again published inside Czechoslovakia. English translations by Ewald Osers, Lyn Coffin, and others appeared in the United Kingdom and in the United States. Anthologies of his poetry from various periods were published in Czech in Toronto and Prague. When his memoirs, All the Beauties of the World (1981) were published in Czech in Toronto (by Sixty-Eight Publishers) and, from SixtyEight’s plates, in Cologne, West Germany, a parallel edition, under the same title, but with minor deletions and alterations, was published in Prague. Seifert’s illness required him to be hospitalized repeatedly. His poetry dealt frequently with death: When I collapsed in pain death wet its finger with saliva to put out the little red flame of my blood, she who was closest to me came, knelt beside me and bent low to breathe sweet breaths into my lungs — long kisses as if for a drowned man. He who was already leaving reopened his eyes 19\n\nto clutch furiously with his hands her shoulders leaning over him, and her hair. Perhaps it is possible to live without love but to die without love is desperation. My life ran its course quickly. It was too short for all my long yearnings, they were endless. Before I knew it the end of my life had drawn near. Death will soon kick my door and come in. At that moment from terror and fright I will hold my breath and forget to breathe again. After Seifert won the Nobel Prize in October 1984, the eyes of the world turned his way at last. Television crews and newspaper reporters descended on him. He continued to write poetry, but again became ill with viral pneumonia. During this editor’s last visit with him in his hospital room, Seifert was alert, vivacious, and gracious as always. He took great interest in many subjects — in everything going on around him, near and far. He asked questions about life in the United States, friends, politics, Gorbachev. He related amusing incidents and mishaps that had occurred to him in Prague and in Paris, in his youth and in recent days. On January 10, 1986, Jaroslav Seifert died. The Czech nation lost the last member of the remarkable group of poets to whom it had given birth in the first third of the twentieth century.\n\n20\n\nIll All his life, Seifert was enraptured by the beauty of the physical world. Modestly and unpretentiously, he infects his readers with his love of life and his joyfulness. He was a poet of the world of the senses, not of transcendence, angst, fear or trembling. He was not a learned or an intellectual poet, but a concrete, popular one. Not theories and abstractions, but the sensuous and emotional values of life drew his attention and praise. As one Czech critic, Jan Vladislav, has put it, the baroque palaces of Prague spoke to Seifert of love and of the tangible softness of a woman’s skin. The courtyards, alleyways, gates, doorways, and gardens of Prague were also akin to the other desire recurring throughout his work: the wish of the human race for harmony and contentment. His kind-hearted, gentle acceptance of the enjoyment of life was a very un-Calvinist one, that of a person unburdened by guilt. Seifert’s sunny poetic personality is rare in the twentieth century. It has much in common with Mozart’s. His heliotropic inclination towards grateful enjoyment of life rested on two important bases: compassion for the suffering of others and a gentle irony. Seifert’s concern for those in pain is most marked in his preoccupation with the sufferings of the Jews during World War II. Seifert is one of the outstanding Gentile poets to have expressed a sense of horror and pathos at the Nazi extermination of Jews. Again and again he returns to this topic, sometimes in incidental references and sometimes as his major theme, for example in his poem “A Song at the End,” about little Hendele, a Czech Jewish girl killed in a Nazi camp, and in the chapter in his memoirs about Elsa, a lonely survivor of the concentration camps [pp. 238-241 below]. The fate of the Jews was never far from Seifert’s awareness. His references cover a wide chrono¬ logical range from the Old Testament, through the Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague, to our own times. He did not dwell only on Jewish suffering, but also on the capacity for joy and love embedded in Jewish traditions; he translated the Song of Songs, 21\n\nand he frequently referred to the beauty and the smiles of Jewish women. Irony, particularly in his self-deprecating thrusts, is another quality of Seifert’s poetry. It is characteristic of him that, as he related in his memoirs, when he was face to face with death, threatened with immediate execution by the Germans in May 1945, he did not think of religious or metaphysical subjects or the terrors of the universe, but wondered what the people living in the apartments nearby were cooking for lunch, and then suddenly remembered the indecent drawing of a woman on the wall of a public latrine which used to fascinate him when he was a boy. He was without false pride, without the need to pose as a hero. He tells us repeatedly how unheroic he is. Just as Seifert was never self-important or pompous, so his poetry shows a determination not to allow eulogies of joy and beauty to be based on self-deception. Irreverence and scepticism are always close at hand. Seifert was ever ready to puncture balloons, especially his own. His lighthearted “Rooster’s Sonnet,” for instance, illustrates this: Rooster, I was awakened by your song and, as if I had forgotten those who were sleeping, I sang out loud, and picked a bunch of grapes — we’d just been riding through a vineyard. How nicely one can live in this world of ours; you resemble me, it seems. We both sing, flapping our wings, and both remain down on the ground. Your metal image on the ridge of the roof turns with the wind as I do. Our dreams go on and on; our fleas keep jumping. No, I’m not weeping for love; crocodile tears are like chicken feed that I picked by the sea in an idle moment.\n\n22\n\nThe speaker does not forget the \"fleas” which are always present and “jumping.” Elsewhere Seifert enjoys quoting the jab of a friend who explained that Seifert’s many trips from a small village to a coffeehouse in a larger town were motivated not by his love of coffee, but by his nostalgia for the smell of the sewers of Prague (p. 223 below). Prague, Seifert’s beloved town of sculp¬ tures, churches, music, and beautiful women, was for him also associated with the unforgettable odor of sewage. When in his reminiscences Seifert recalled the prostitute whose naked breasts fascinated him when he was sixteen, and forever marked him with love for women’s beauty, he also emphasized that she lived in a brothel guarded by a sordid old woman, where a fat rat dragged something nasty across the threshold. Seifert insisted on acknowledging all sides of life. A readiness to undercut his own flights of emotion and aspiration came naturally to Seifert, but his basic orientation was not a debunking one. He might laugh at his adolescent romantic dreams and sentimentalities, but what he called his youthful “limping” and “stumbling” after women’s hair and breasts, and his boyish deification of poetry did remain the twin poles of his life. He gloried in them and pursued them, even after irony had done all its work. Seifert’s tone is usually that of a close friend. He spoke as if he and his reader were comrades sharing a common culture and set of attitudes towards life. Such parenthetical phrases as “of course” and “as we know” are frequent in Seifert’s poems and memoirs. And his poetry is full of references to Czech culture, ranging from the anniversaries of historic events to the sculptures and other architectural landmarks of Prague. He speaks as if one could assume everyone will know where Mozart lived when he was in Prague, and what he composed there, or who Macha was and even what his sweetheart’s name was. Because of this, foreign readers (and also Czech readers of a younger generation) may need to have various passages annotated and explained. It is for this reason that a Glossary identifying persons and place names is included in the back of this volume, as well as some additional explanatory endnotes. 23\n\nThe criteria for the selection of poems included in this anthology were\n\nthreefold:\n\nintrinsic\n\nquality,\n\nrepresentativeness,\n\nand\n\ntranslatability. We have made an effort to choose poems from various periods of Seifert’s work and to illustrate his various modes. We have also given preference to poems (and passages from the prose reminiscences) which deal with universal themes, and we have tended to avoid those which depend heavily on special Czech circumstances and interests. Because the poems of Seifert’s early and middle periods often depended so heavily on effects of sound, it is difficult to preserve many of their qualities in translation. For this reason, while some poems of these periods are included, the bulk of the volume consists of poems written since the 1950s, when sound became less important to Seifert’s work. The poetic traditions behind Seifert’s works derive mainly from two lines of literary ancestry: major Czech poets (the nineteenth-century Romantic poet Karel Macha and others widely read in Czechoslovakia, although little known abroad, such as Karel Erben, Jan Neruda, and Jaroslav Vrchlicky); and the French masters, some of whom Seifert translated (Paul Verlaine, Charles Baudelaire, Blaise Cendrars, Jules Supervieille, Guillaume Apollinaire, and others). Seifert’s poetry evolved from a rather brief initial proletarian phase, through the long modernist period, to the simple, transparent, conversational phase of his last two decades. Flowever, similar preoccupations were evident throughout his life. His major themes from beginning to end were love and the beauty of women, Prague and the fate of the Czech nation, and the sensuous pleasures and joys of life. Themes of only slightly less importance were death, sorrow, and pain; Paris and French culture; and Mozart. In the 1960s, when Seifert turned to an unrhymed poetry that was intimate, almost epistolary, eroticism continued to be an important theme; but suffering, pain, death, and melancholy assumed more prominent roles. The seeming ordinariness of his later poems is deceptive. Within their prose-like narratives there is a strange tension. 24\n\nSeifert suddenly leaps out with poignant words or lines, which are all the more powerful for the contrast with the light touch of the passages surrounding them. We settle into the expectancy of reading a plain, even banal text, and then the poem startles us with something original which, retroactively, transforms our perception of the preceding passages. We see them as inventive, skewed, and demanding.\n\nIV When I visited Seifert in February 1985, he proved to be lively, alert, mischievously witty, and eager to ask questions. Mindful of his past illnesses and hospitalizations, I started to take my leave several times, so that my presence would not exhaust him too much, but each time he insisted on continuing to talk and to pour white wine for his company and himself. Seifert’s apartment was in a house with a garden behind a fence with a small gate, in a quiet suburban street high on the ridge of a hill in Brevnov, one of Prague’s “small villa” residential sections. Present were his daughter Jana, an energetic, business¬ like person; his son, a quiet, self-effacing scientist; and two Czech visitors — a poet and translator, and a journalist. Seifert’s wife, who suffered from hearing difficulties, walked into the room several times for a few minutes, but did not participate in the conversation. Seifert and his daughter took the initiative in steering the conversation in various directions. Seifert himself sat at his desk, drank tea and white wine, and was every inch the cordial host. His study is full of objects connected with his poetry and his particular affections — statuary, including heads of angels and madonnas, works of Czech poets, Czech folk art, pictures of wildflowers, and a photograph of the legendary hill ftip, on which the progenitor of the Czech people stopped and decided to settle in what is now the Czech Republic. 25\n\nHe was a natural raconteur. The chronological scope of the stories he told reached from his childhood to the day before our conversation. With schoolboy glee, he recounted how, the previous afternoon, a scientist sent by the Swedish Academy had paid him a courtesy call in connection with his Nobel Prize. One of the things the Swedish scientist had asked him, Seifert said, was which kiss had been the best of his whole life. Seifert was obviously very pleased with the answer he had given. He told the visitor that two kisses tied for first place. One was when he first kissed the woman who later became his wife. The second took place after a friend telephoned him, a long time ago, to say that the chamber containing the jewels of the Czech kings was being unlocked, and that if Seifert hurried he could come and see them. Seifert rushed to the Cathedral, where he touched the crown of the Czech kings with his own hands and then leaned over and kissed it. That was the second of the two best kisses of his life. The Swedish dignitary liked his answer very much, Seifert said with a twinkle in his eye: “Swedes like that kind of thing.” Seifert took great interest in the translations of his poems being published abroad and asked many questions about them. He was particularly pleased that a volume of his poetry translated into Catalan had been published in Barcelona by a Czech woman living in Spain, Monika Zgustova. Seifert obviously felt a special sympathy, or fraternal collegiality with Catalans, a people who, like the Czechs, are comparatively few in number. He recalled with special warmth his friend Roman Jakobson, the late linguist and literary scholar, and pointed with pride to a photograph standing on his desk, which showed Jakobson gesticulating, with a hand raised typically high. Seifert said this was the last photograph taken before Jakobson’s death. With regard to his own poetry, Seifert stressed that although the lines of his recent poems may be unrhymed, there were many internal rhymes and other sound patterns within his verses, which should not be ignored. On another occasion, to another interviewer, Seifert elo¬ quently summarized his views on the connections between 26\n\npoetry,\n\nsensuality,\n\nand\n\nfreedom,\n\nwhich\n\ncan\n\nappropriately\n\nconclude our introduction to his works: My origins are proletarian, and I thought of myself for a long time as a proletarian poet. But as one grows older, one discovers different values and different worlds. For me, this meant that I discovered sensuality. . . . All language can be thought of as an effort to achieve freedom, to feel the joy and the sensuality of freedom. What we seek in language is the freedom to be able to express our most intimate thoughts. This is the basis of all freedom. In social life, it ultimately assumes the form of political freedom. . . . When I write, I make an effort not to lie: that’s all. If one cannot say the truth, one must not lie, but keep silent. . . . Poetry has the subtlety we need to be able to describe our experience of the world. The fact that we speak by means of our human voice causes poetry to touch us personally, directly, so that we feel our whole being is involved.5\n\nHC3|C9|C9(C3|C3(C9|e9f:9(e9iC\n\nI want to express my warmest gratitude to the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled me to have leisure and quiet to make the final revisions to this volume at its Study Center in the Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio on Lake Como; to the many excellent suggestions of the publisher at Catbird Press, Robert Wechsler; and to Professor Karen Brazell, for many excellent suggestions on how to improve the English texts. As for the series of personal meetings with Mr. Seifert in Prague in the course of the year 1985, they were a delight and an inspiration. It was a privilege to be a witness to his invariably gracious manner and to his poetic genius, which manifested itself strongly also in his casual conversations.

Reader, you open a plain and unpretentious book — and here my song takes flight. Although I look upon the glory of the city, my heart it cannot overpower; its majesty and greatness do not bewitch me; I shall return to the mysterious embrace of star, of wood and brook, of field and flower. But so long as one of my brothers is suffering, I cannot be happy and, bitterly revolting against all injustice, I shall long continue, amid the suffocating smoke, to lean against a factory wall and sing my song. Yet strange to me is the street, I’ve found. Swiftly it flies like an arrow to conquer the world. They’ll never tune in to my blood’s rhythm, the running belts and the wheels with which my hands and the hands of thousands are bound, so that, whatever a man’s heart feels he must not and cannot embrace his comrade. Yet were I to flee to the wood and the deer, to the flower and the brook, sorrow would so weigh my heart down that, without turning to look at all the beauty and quiet and passion, I should go back to the town, 28\n\nthe city that welcomes one in its ice-cold fashion, where the nightingale ceases to sing and the pine-wood loses its smell, where not only man is enslaved, but the flower, the bird, the horse and the humble dog as well. Gentle reader, as you read these lines, reflect for a moment and note this down; the angular picture you scan is the town. Why, man feels just like a flower: Don’t pluck him, don’t break him, don’t tread on him!\n\nSinful City The city of factory owners, boxers, millionaires, the city of inventors and of engineers, the city of generals, merchants, and patriotic poets with its black sins has exceeded the bounds of God’s wrath: and God was enraged. A hundred times He’d threatened vengeance on the town, a rain of sulphur, fire, thunderbolts raining down, and a hundred times he’d taken pity. For he always remembered what once he had promised: that even for two just men he’d not destroy his city, and a god’s promise should retain its power: just then two lovers walked across the park, breathing the scent of hawthorn shrubs in flower. 29\n\nA Song About Girls Through the city flows a mighty river, seven bridges bestride it; along the embankment walk a thousand pretty girls and no two are alike. From heart to heart you go to warm your hands in love’s great warming flame; along the embankment walk a thousand pretty girls and they’re all the same.\n\nRed-Hot Fruit To love poets the vanishing fauna of Yellowstone Park And yet we love poetry poetry the eternal waterfall Long-range guns were shelling Paris Poets in steel helmets But why count those who died of unhappy love? Goodbye Paris! We sailed round Africa and fish with diamond eyes died in the steamer’s props what hurts most is one’s memory\n\n30\n\nNegro lyres and the smell of hot air the red-hot fruit of chandeliers only ripens towards midnight and Monsieur Blaise Cendrars lost a hand in the war Sacred birds on slender legs like shadows rock the fate of worlds Carthage is dead And the wind plays in the sugar cane a thousand clarinets Meanwhile on brittle parallels of the globe History century-old ivy is twining I’m dying of thirst Mademoiselle Muguet and you won’t tell me how the wine must have tasted in Carthage A star was struck by lightning and it’s raining The water’s surfaces swirl like taut drum skins Revolution in Russia the fall of the Bastille and the poet Mayakovsky is dead But poetry a honeyed moon dripping sweet juices into flowers’ calixes\n\nHoneymoon If it were not for all those foolish kisses we’d not be taking honeymoon trips to the sea — but if it weren’t for honeymoon trips, what use then all those wagon-lits? Perpetual fear of railway station bells, ah, wagon-lits, honeymoon sleeping cars, all wedded happiness is brittle glass, a honeyed moon stands in a sky of stars. My love, look at the Alpine peaks outside, we’ll let the window down, we’ll smell the amaranth, the sugary white of snowdrops, lilies’ snow — behind the wagon-lit's the wagon-restaurant. Ah, wagons-restaurants, ah, cars for newlyweds, to stay in them forever and to sup with knife and fork on happiness in bed. HANDLE WITH CARE! GLASS—FRAGILE! THIS SIDE UP! And one more day and then another night, two marvellous nights, two marvellous days like these. Where is my rail guide, that poetic book, oh and the beauty of my wagons-litsl Oh wagons-restaurants and wagons-litsl Oh honeymoons!\n\n32\n\nPhilosophy Remember the wise philosophers: Life is but a moment. And yet whenever we waited for our girlfriends it was an eternity.\n\nThe Fan To hide a girl’s blushes, provocative eyes, deep sighs, finally wrinkles and a smile become wry. A butterfly alighting on her breasts, palette of loves gone by with the colours of faded memories.\n\nMoscow The minuet has long ceased to be danced, the harp has long lost its last audience. The display cases in the old palace are tombstones of the dead. There were battlefields here, the Kremlin’s bloodstained wall still bares its teeth. Bear witness for us, you who are dead, buried in silks. Cups without wine, flags dipped to the past, a sword that recalls from whose hand it dropped. Rotten rings, a mildewy diadem, a corsage that’s fragrant still, the disintegrating robes of dead tsarinas and eyeless masks, the look of death and damnation. The orb, symbol of power, lying on the ground, an apple worm-eaten and rotten. All’s over, all is over under the golden domes, death is guarding history’s graveyard. Suits of armour, empty like golden nutshells on carpets of unparalleled design, and Empire carriages drive back into the past without horses, without lights, without occupants.\n\n34\n\nApple Tree with Cobweb Strings Deep-red apples curve down the royal trunk like a harp, fitted by autumn with cobweb strings, ring and sing, my playerl We are not from a land where oranges grow, where round Ionian columns climb the vine that's sweeter than the lips of Roman women; ours but the apple tree, fiercely bowed down by age and fruit. Beneath it sits a man who’s seen all this — Parisian nights, Italian noon, above the Kremlin a cold moon — and has come home to reminisce. A tune that sings a calm and quiet song that could be played upon these cobweb strings sounds in my ear. And where is beauty found, mountains, cities, seas? Where do trains take you in search of peace, to heal still smarting wounds? Where? And women’s eyes, their breasts, whose rise and fall would rock your head in rich erotic dream, do they not tempt you? A voice that’s redolent of distance calls you: Your land is small!\n\nDo you stay mute when that seductive voice speaks to the vagrant in you? Midday is gone, I pick an apple from the ancient tree, inhale its fragrance. To be alone and far from women’s laughter and from women’s tears, to be at home, alone, with the familiar tree-song in your ears. Why, the pointless beauty of some foolish women isn’t worth an apple.\n\nPanorama The stag is retreating, the smoke of its antlers is rising through the fern’s foliage, listen to the star, but softly, only softly. Plates full of fruit, nights full of stars, I’d like to hand you this bronze bowl and be a barber. Oh coiffeurs, tired hands gliding down smooth hair, a comb is dropped, the sculptor lays down his chisel and in the mirror eyes have turned to ice. It’s night already. Are you asleep? Shatter the softness of your eiderdowns1. The midnight hour. Electric lamps. Dark, light, dark, half-light and behold: The comb of mountains combs the hair of the sky and stars are falling fast like golden lice. 36\n\nDance of the Girls' Chemises A dozen girls’ chemises drying on a line, floral lace at the breast like rose windows in a Gothic cathedral. Lord, shield Thou me from all evil. A dozen girls’ chemises, that’s love, innocent girls’ games on a sunlit lawn, the thirteenth, a man’s shirt, that’s marriage, ending in adultery and a pistol shot. The wind that’s streaming through the chemises, that’s love, our earth embraced by its sweet breezes: a dozen airy bodies. Those dozen girls made of light air are dancing on the green lawn, gently the wind is modelling their bodies, breasts, hips, a dimple on the belly there — open fast, oh my eyes. Not wishing to disturb their dance I softly slipped under the chemises’ knees, and when any of them fell I greedily inhaled it through my teeth and bit its breast.\n\n37\n\nLove, which we inhale and feed on, disenchanted, love that our dreams are keyed on, love, that dogs our rise and fall: nothing yet the sum of all. In our all-electric age nightclubs not christenings are the rage and love is pumped into our tyres. My sinful Magdalen, don’t cry: Romantic love has spent its fires. Faith, motorbikes, and hope.\n\nSong We wave a handkerchief on parting, every day something is ending, something beautiful’s ending. The carrier pigeon beats the air, returning; with hope or without hope we’re always returning. Go dry your tears and smile with eyes still smarting, every day something is starting, something beautiful’s starting.\n\n38\n\nPrague Above the elephantine blankets of flower-beds a Gothic cactus blooms with royal skulls and in the cavities of melancholy organs in the clusters of tin pipes, old melodies are rotting. Cannonballs like seeds of wars were scattered by the wind. Night towers over all and through the box-trees of evergreen cupolas the foolish emperor tiptoes away into the magic gardens of his alembics and through the halcyon air of rose-red evenings rings out the tinkle of the glass foliage as it is touched by the alchemists’ fingers as if by wind. The telescopes have gone blind from the horror of the universe and the fantastic eyes of spacemen have been sucked out by death. And while the moon was laying eggs in the clouds, new stars were hatching feverishly like birds migrating from blacker regions, singing the songs of human fate — but there is no one who can understand them. Listen to the fanfares of silence, on carpets threadbare like ancient shrouds we are moving towards an invisible future and His Majesty dust settles lightly on the abandoned throne. 39\n\nWet Picture Those beautiful days when the city resembles a die, a fan, a bird song or a scallop shell on the seashore — goodbye, goodbye, pretty girls, we met today and will not ever meet again. Those beautiful Sundays when the city resembles a football, a card, an ocarina or a swinging bell — in the sunny street the shadows of passersby were kissing and people walked away, total strangers. Those beautiful evenings when the city resembles a clock, a kiss, a star or a sunflower that turns — at the first chord the dancers flapped their wings of girls’ hands like moths or nightmares at the first light of dawn. Those beautiful nights when the city resembles a rose, a chessboard, a violin or a crying girl — we played dominoes, black-dotted dominoes with the thin girls in the bar, watching their knees, which were emaciated like two skulls with the silk crowns of their garters in the desperate kingdom of love.\n\n40\n\nNovember 1918 In memoriam Guillaume Apollinaire\n\nIt was autumn. Foreign troops had occupied the vineyard slopes, emplaced their guns among the vines, like nests, and aimed them at the Gioconda’s breasts. We saw a sad impoverished land, soldiers without legs or hands but not without a spark of hope, the fortress gates were swinging open. A scent-filled autumn sky: below it a city with an ailing poet, a window to the evening sun. Here is a helmet, sword and gun. This city, true, is not where I was born, its rivers flow along without concern, but once below a bridge there I had wept: a pipe, a pen, a ring are all I kept. The gargoyles up by the cathedral’s rafters vomit the city’s dirt into the gutters, their heads bent forward from the cornice toppings and fouled and spattered by the pigeons’ droppings. The bells ring out, the bronze notes fall, but this time without hope at all, a funeral cortege must pass down the boulevards of Montparnasse.\n\nThe ripples on the river told the birds, the birds flew up to tell the clouds and sang the news up in the skies: the stars that evening did not rise. And Paris, as it stood, City of Light, shrouded itself in deepest, blackest night.\n\nParting So foolish are the hearts of many women, of beautiful and ugly ones alike, their footprints are not easy to distinguish in the sands of your memory. But what you minded most at our final parting was that in my poor rags — but was it not the costume of a beggar? — you couldn’t see your tears as in a suit of armour Goodbye, you swarm of flies which buzzed into my dreams, goodbye, my quiet evenings and my cigarette case with the engraved rosette! Opening the door I heard the screams of angels hurtling down to hell.\n\nThe Wax Candle for A.M. Pisa\n\nBorn of the buzzing hives and of the smell of flowers, honey’s little sister, honey-bathed for hours till from that fragrant bath lifted by angels’ hands — and in the month of love bees wove its garment strands. When a dead man collapses at its feet like one at rest on a train of black shadows, then it will comb its crest and down its waxen body will run a red-hot tear: Come with me, dear departed, your bed is waiting here.\n\n43\n\nA Hundred Times Nothing Maybe once more I will be driven mad by your smile and on my pillow gently as a feather will settle girlfriend love and mother grief, always the two together. Maybe once more I will be driven mad by the bugle's tune and my hair will smell of gunpowder as I walk like one who’s dropped from the moon. Maybe once more I will be driven mad by a kiss: like a flame in a reluctant lantern I’ll begin to tremble as it touches my skin. But that will only be the wind on my lips and in vain will I try to catch its incorporeal dress as it flits by.\n\n44\n\nDialogue [She] Was it my forehead or my lips you kissed? I do not know — I heard only a delightful voice and dark mist veiled the wonder of my startled eyes.\n\n[He] Hastily I kissed you on your forehead, for I felt my senses go from the fragrance of your flowing breath but still I do not know: — I heard only a delightful voice and dark mist veiled the wonder of my startled eyes. Was it my forehead or my lips you kissed?\n\n45\n\nFuneral Under My Window I complain to the wind, our life’s but a minute, horses, turn back, if only horses could turn back: turn back our time, once more to begin it! If only the clock striking backwards could bring us the moments we wasted, frittering, if only the machine, running in reverse, could unravel the noose of the suicide, if only the moon which set yesterday returned once more to the sky today, if only we knew how to weep again over our trivial sorrows! I complain to the wind — hear its howl and its din if only the wind could turn back, turn back the mask of dead skin — the mask which at the point of death flew off the face with its last breath and which the wind now sweeps and batters — to let us kiss it once again before it’s borne away and shatters in the tops of trees, in the drops of rain.\n\nTr ansformations for F.X. Saida\n\nA lad changed to a shrub in spring, the shrub into a shepherd boy, a fine hair to a lyre string, snow into snow on hair piled high. And words turn into question signs, wisdom and fame to old-age lines, and strings revert to finest hair, the boy’s transformed into a poet, the poet is transformed once more, becomes the shrub by which he slept when he loved beauty till he wept. Whoever falls in love with beauty will love it to his dying day, stagger toward it aimlessly, beauty has feet of charm and grace in sandals delicate as lace. And in this metamorphosis a spell binds him to woman’s love, a single second is enough like steam in a retort to hiss, obedient to the alchemist and drops dead as a hunted dove. Without a stick old age is lame, the stick turns into anything in this ceaseless, fantastic game, perhaps into an angel’s wings now spreading wide for soaring flight bodyless, painless, feather light.\n\nThe Year 1934 The happiness of youth is pleasant to remember. Only the river doesn’t age. The windmill has collapsed, capricious winds are whistling, unconcerned. A touching wayside cross remains. A cornflower wreath like a nest without birds upon Christ’s shoulder, and a frog blaspheming in the sedge. Have mercy upon us! A bitter time has come to the banks of sweet rivers, two years the factories have stood empty and children learn the language of hunger at their mothers’ knees. And still their laughter rings under the willow sadly silent in its silver. May they give us a happier old age than the childhood we’re giving them!\n\nThe Hands of Venus The laggardly adventurer sits down on the shore and tells the wave his vain stories; they are only a handful of wind on the palm of a hand, the undoing of pearls in wine, the fear of not dying. But that is not his true calling. When the rooster crows, the dew freezes and plucks the rose blossoms, he says to himself: how cruel it is to tear the poor rose, its petals are rose like the nails of the toes. But that is not his true calling. To watch the birth of beauty, to lament its undoing, to wait by flowing waters for the blossoms of next spring, which again deafen the eternal hesitation, to put one’s head in the palms of the hands of Venus de Milo, Alas, that is his true calling. translated by George Gibian\n\nSpanish Vineyards Once more the earth is sending up its juices into the low vines of these stony lands. And the young plants, if they aren’t shot to pieces, are gladly holding out their leafy hands like beggars hoping for a sun-warmed coin. Oh charming villages which give renown and name to those sweet juices swelling out the grapes that bow the slender branches down. It’s April now and drops of crimson blood are spattered over simple smock and hand. Ah, Spanish grapes, who will be here to pick you the day there is no fighting in this land?\n\nSalute to the Madrid Barricades Covered in quicklime in his native soil Garcia Lorca, warrior and poet, lies crouching in the dugout of his grave without a rifle, lyre, ammunition. The rug of days on which the Moors now dance is woven now from pools of tears and blood, and across Alpine glaciers, Pyrenean heights, from the ancient stairway leading to the Castle a poet’s speaking to him, a poet still alive with his clenched fist sends to that distant grave a gentle kiss, the kind that poets save for one another. 50\n\nNot for murder but for days of peace sounds the sweet song and that soft play, the play of words and rhymes that we have sought under our lovers’ hearts and under trees in blossom, to shape a verse as sonorous and as beautiful as ringing bells and speech on plain folk’s lips. But when the pen turned into a rifle, who did not flee? A bayonet, too, can write on human skin, its letters burning like the crimson leaves through which I’m wading at this difficult hour. Yet one thing I do know, dead friend: along the boulevards of Madrid workers will march again and they will sing your songs, dear poet, when they’ve hung up the rifles they now lean on, when they have hung them up in gratitude as do the lame in Lourdes their now no longer needed crutches.\n\nYou have skin pale like a snowdrop . . . You have skin pale like a snowdrop, but a mouth fragrant like a rose. The words of love are monotonous, what shall I do with them now that I am waiting for your reply and in confusion hurrying for it. You have skin pale like a snowdrop, but a mouth fragrant like a rose. But don’t deceive me in the end, let the fear that screens your eyes vanish quickly, please look — like the snow that fell last year. You have skin pale like a snowdrop, but a mouth fragrant like a rose. translated by George Gibian\n\n52\n\nRobed in Light first canto As I was walking in the fading light Prague seemed more beautiful than Rome to me — I was afraid that from this dream I might never awake, that I might never see the stars that, when the daylight comes again, beneath their folded wings the gargoyles hide — the gargoyles standing, as on guard, beside the cornice of St Vitus’ ancient fane. One morning in the early hours, too late to go to bed — the dawn was drawing near — I stood before the still unopened gate of the great church, but would not knock for fear, as a poor pilgrim, on a winter morn, finding it shut, will stand beside a door; I wished to see the gargoyles just before they greet the stars returning home at dawn. But then I spied a tomb and went to view the statue on it — all alone was I; like a wrecked ship appeared the dead man’s shoe; its toe was pointing upwards to the sky. And as I looked, a flickering candle flung strange shadows on the tomb from head to heel; it was as though I heard a spinning-wheel and peasants’ songs amid the vineyards sung. The grapes are in the royal garment’s weave, in grey, as early morning human breath, four ladies sleeping in the Gothic nave are carrying the dead man on their breasts. Remember me to Karlstejn’s woods, their pines descending gently to the sunlit plains. 53\n\nRemember me to Karlstejn’s walls again and to the hillsides clad in verdant vines! From his tomb he raised above the pillars (sprouting, so it seemed, out of his palms) a blanched human skull; behold, a lover’s hands, created for caress and charms, touched it and the touch lent it endurance through a nation’s song whose lips had cracked, gave it strength, it was a secret pact, all that was left of its inheritance. Why, its lips from thirst were bound to numb — ceaselessly it slept upon its sword — through the ages rang the ancient hymn, ardent song of safety and accord. And the Saint, obscured now by the shapes of wings of angels and the shield of prayer, broke white bread among his country’s poor and with his own feet trod the firm white grapes. In confusion I regard this majesty, press into the beggars’ shade nearby, I’m not here to weep among the amethysts, I have long forgotten how to cry. The lace edge of the altarcloth was tom, the music stand had spilled a few sheets: through the long nave rang steps of heavy boots, clicking dully on the floor’s mosaic.\n\nSong of the Native Land Beautiful as on a jug a painted flower is the land that bore you, gave you life, beautiful as on a jug a painted flower, sweeter than a loaf from fresh-ground flour into which you’ve deeply sunk your knife. Countless times disheartened, disappointed, always newly you return to it, countless times disheartened, disappointed, to this land so rich and sun-anointed, poor like springtime in a gravel pit. Beautiful as on a jug a painted flower, heavy as our guilt that will not go away — never can its memory decay. At the end, at our final hour we shall slumber in its bitter clay.\n\n55\n\nTo Prague So much I loved you, though with words alone, my fairest city, when your cloak was thrown wide open to reveal your lilac charms; much more was said by those who carried arms. Yes, they were plentiful, our daily tears and, streaming down, they salted our bread. The voices of our dead rang in our ears, the just, reproachful voices of our dead. Upon the pavement of our streets they lay, and I shall always, even unto my grave, feel shame I was not with them on that day. You gallant city, bravest of the brave, eternally enshrined in mankind’s story: That day enhanced your beauty and your glory.\n\nAt the Tomb of the Czech Kings Shame in my heart, I stand among the agates — those jewels of our land! The faithful sword whose resting place is near was not to hand! Like dew besprinkled leaves and blossoms while dormant still in bud, the sword, the lance, the chain-mail gauntlet were always splashed with blood. To pray? But let the sword be drawn and flash the while we pray! Only the women may have empty hands now. And not even they! The clock moves on, though time is running slow atop our Renaissance spire. The hand of history’s inscribed on walls new signs of fire. But there’s dried blood on it, a spark is kindled: the chained will disobey. Only the women may have empty hands now. And not even they! To fold our hands in miserable prayer, wait for a better day? Only the children may have empty hands now. And not even they!\n\nWhen in the history books When in the history books one day you read our story, when neither fame nor sorrow seem what they once had been, when summer comes again and girls in all their glory reveal their many charms in veils of crepe-de-chine, and one of them, embarrassed, hands lying on her dress, trembles oh so slightly as you bend down with fire, inhale her fragrant breath sweet as wild berries and kiss her on her lips, then on her chin and lower, remember: to be carefree was also my desire, make love to girls, be happy, believe that life was sweet. Alas, my rose-red mantle was ripped by sharp barbed wire and our nights re-echoed the tread of marching feet. When in the history books one day you read our story: about a land that flourished, of hail and floods in spring, maybe you’ll catch the sound of drum-rolls funerary and from our epoch’s depth will cruel laughter ring.\n\nThe Dead of Lidice Homing swallow vainly seeks her loft, round and round with plaintive tweet she flies. Yet the trees, like giant sceptres cleft, tower silent into leaden skies. You down there, whose heels the clay bed deepen, where the path to depthless crater yields, striding through the darkness, arms flung open, as though scattering seeds into your fields — Lark alone on your deep grave attending; he is nearer you than is our ear, he hears all that passes understanding, and in his note you may sometimes hear song of clay, with stifling burden binding lips about to utter words of flame, song of stone, your upright head surrounding, and the silence which enshrouds your name — Song of anguish, as your children, weeping, to the dark grey waiting trucks they led, when you saw the pit of madness gaping and for madness time had long since fled — Song of terror that no terror matches, wild-eyed women gripping door and fence as a drowning man a straw haulm clutches as salvation’s one and only chance — Song of silence, startling, and still deeper when the last faint breath has died away; song of all the glory of this people on whose nameless graves we step today. 59\n\nNow the lark’s song, clear and tranquil, rises up from the plain like any other day — But the roses, melancholy roses trodden underfoot, still dot the clay.\n\nHow painful I would find it. . . How painful I would find it to leave these well-loved walls for ever! There were moments when I believed life was impossible without their shadows, which reach far beyond our short lives. The compass card no longer urges me towards unknown distant places and its rays perhaps have died for me. Yet the green trees with their long-striding roots are keeping pace with me here.\n\n60\n\nLovers, those evening pilgrims . Lovers, those evening pilgrims, walk from darkness into darkness to an empty bench and wake the birds. Only the rats, which nest with the swan on the pond’s bank under the willow branches, sometimes alarm them. Keyholes are glittering in the sky, and when a cloud covers them somebody’s hand is on the door-knob and the eye, which had hoped to see a mystery, gazes in vain. — I wouldn’t mind opening that door, except I don’t know which, and then I fear what I might find. By now that pair were falling down together in a close embrace, and in that state of weightlessness were reeling in spasms of wonderment. The mists are dancing, wearing wreaths of daisies, bird droppings, and rust their swirling cloaks still red from the extinguished evening sky. But those two, lips to lips, are still beyond this world, beyond the door of heaven. — When you start falling, hold to me tight and hang on to your scarf!\n\nSometimes we are tied down . . . Sometimes we are tied down by memories and there are no scissors that could cut through those tough threads. Or ropes! You see the bridge there by the House of Artists? A few steps before that bridge gendarmes shot a worker dead who was walking in front of me. I was only twenty at the time, but whenever I pass the spot the memory comes back to me. It takes me by the hand and together we walk to the little gate of the Jewish cemetery, through which I had been running from their rifles. The years moved on with unsure, tottering step and I with them. Years flying till time stood still.\n\n62\n\nIf one could tell one’s heart. . . If one could tell one's heart: don’t rush! If one could bid it: Burn! The flame is dying. Only a slipper now, only a hand, only a thimble now before the key turns, opening the door through which we pass with tears for that terrible beauty called Life. Don’t feel ashamed. Lord Jesus also wept. Last night the stars shone so brilliantly. But why should a single blade speak of itself when there is grass? I do apologize, I only want a few words. When I collapsed with pain and death already was licking its finger to snuff out the small red flame of blood, came the one woman who was closest to me, knelt down beside me and bent low to breathe, with her long kisses, her breath into my lungs, as to a drowned man. And he, already leaving opened his eyes again and desperately with his hands hung on to her shoulders and hair.\n\n63\n\nMaybe it’s possible to live without love but to die without it is sheer despair. Just one more little leaf, just one more grain, only a pinhead’s worth! So I can for just a little longer stagger in the balmy attraction of womanhood, which draws us close and leads us away, seeks and passes, urges and restrains, strikes down and raises up, binds and loosens, caresses and kills, wing and anchor fetter and ray, rose and claw to the end.\n\nReluctant whispers of kissed lips. Reluctant whispers of kissed lips that are smiling Yes — I’ve long since ceased to hear them. Nor do they belong to me. Yet I’d still love to find words kneaded from bread dough or the fragrance of lindens. But the bread’s become mouldy and the fragrance bitter. And all round me the words sneak on tiptoe and strangle me when I try to catch them. I cannot kill them but they’re killing me. And blows of curses crash against my door. If I forced them to dance for me they’d stay mute. And yet they hobble. But I know very well that a poet must always say more than is hidden in the roar of words. And that is poetry. Else he could not with his verses lever out a bud from honeyed veils or force a shiver to run down your spine as he strips down the truth.\n\nSong of the Sweepings What’s left of all those beautiful moments? Lustre of eyes, a drop of fragrance, some sighs on the lapel, breath on a window-pane, a pinch of tears, a shred of grief. And after that, believe me, hardly anything. A handful of cigarette smoke, some hurried smiles, a few words now swirling in the corner like sweepings stirred by the wind. And then — I’m glad I remembered — three snowflakes. And that is all.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNow, don’t smile! Heaven, hell, paradise — these aren’t mysteries but just a children’s game, nothing more terrible, with children hopscotching into the square where their pebble has landed. When rain was in the air the sewers stank.\n\n66\n\nI too played all these games but snow and rain then soaked my heaven. Why did they sprinkle our streets? The semicircle at the top was paradise, where hell was I can’t remember now. Yet hell was there. But in the raindrops the world would glisten and snow was even more beautiful than now. Once on that pavement I found a woman who’d been killed. It was Advent, it was early morning, when in the churches they would sing Rorate and from somewhere wafted the smell of pine needles. In her fingers she clutched an empty handbag and a little further on lay a powder compact with its mirror broken. Rorate coelil Whoever had torn off her clothes had ripped her blouse. Rorate coeli desuper! Cold rain was falling and the arc lamp rocked its wet shadow. Then they covered the corpse with a sheet.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWith thumping heart, oh, how often, I walked past dirty curtains in the windows, breathlessly waiting for some hand to draw them back.\n\nAs for a woman’s face, I never saw one then, stirring reality was fleeing from me. No, it was I who fled before it and my eyes shrank in shamed confusion. And all my yearnings were afraid. What I so hungrily had wished to see I suddenly caught sight of. I did not then suspect how passion can disrobe when it wants to be evil. The blood was still there the next day. And that was that hell.\n\n68\n\nA Song at the End Listen: about little Hendele. She came back to me yesterday and she was twenty-four already. And as graceful as Shulamite. She wore an ash-grey squirrel fur and a pert little cap and round her neck she’d tied a scarf the colour of pale smoke. Hendele, how well this suits you! I thought that you were dead and meanwhile you have grown more beautiful. I am glad you’ve come! How wrong you are, dear friend! I’ve been dead twenty years, and very well you know it. I’ve only come to meet you.\n\n69\n\nHalley's Comet I saw nothing at that moment, nothing but strangers’ backs, heads under their hats craning. The street was crowded. I’d have liked to scramble up that blank wall by my fingernails, the way addicts of ether try to do, but just then my hand was seized by a woman’s hand, I took a few steps and before me opened those depths we call the heavens. The spires of the Cathedral down on the horizon looked as if cut out from matte silver foil, but high above them the stars were drowning. There it is! See it now? Yes, I see it! In trails of sparks which would not die out the star was vanishing without return. It was a spring night, sweet and mild, after mid-May, the balmy air was laden with perfumes and I inhaled it together with the stardust. Once when in summer I had tried to smell — and only furtively — the scent of some tall lilies — they used to sell them in our market-place in kitchen jugs — people would laugh at me. For on my face was golden pollen. 70\n\nSt George's Basilica If in the white Basilica of St George fire broke out, God forbid, its walls after the flames would be rose-coloured. Perhaps even its twin towers: Adam and Eve. Eve is the slimmer one, as is usual with women, though this is only an insignificant glory of their sex. The fiery heat would make the limestone blush. Just as young girls do after their first kiss.\n\nThe Dome of the Observatory What else is left to people nowadays than quickly to put on some space-suit with a steel helmet, pull down the plexiglass visor and leap into some strange craft without masts, without sails, and steer headlong into the depth of the universe. Only thus can they touch again the surface of the stars. I know what you’re going to say, I know it well. But when we were children and someone’s arms were round our necks\n\nit was so good behind those open doors. Diapers were drying there and the sheep at the threshold, rams, ewes, and lambs crowded upon each other and stretched their necks. The water, so as to be quiet, disguised itself as light snow and settled on the roof. If there had been an empty cage on the wall that too would have sung. A warmth came from the breath of the beasts, love also warmed us and everything was fragrant — moss, hay, straw and something else: mother’s milk. Ah yes, that was the best thing in the world. And above the roof, within arm’s reach, was a star. And then the spinning wheel fell silent and the bobbin was lost, the barn stood empty and the star flew away to the far end of our galaxy. And only red-hot ashes fell from the skies. I know what you’re going to say, I know it well, but up there is a barren emptiness and silence to drive you mad. And desperate dense darkness. And terrible black cold.\n\nPrologue To be a poet is no easy task. He spots a warbler in the woods flying above its nest and he can’t stop himself from thinking — O wicked ecstasy! — of the warm tousled dimple in his girl’s armpit. Yet he walks on into the wood because he can hear voices and everything around is softly trembling. And what d’you know? Quite close he’ll see the downy crotches of young women, first one, another, receding into the dim distance, leaving behind them longing. Oh no, they’re just leaves and flowers, the pinkish trunks of tall spruces glistening after the rain. They are most beautiful during the day and then at night. But it’s not me. Once, in the past, the poet raised his voice and blood crowed loud. Men rushed to take up arms and women did not hesitate to cut their honey-hued and dark-red hair for bowstrings. They’re more elastic than our nylon strings.\n\n73\n\nToday girls wear their hair too short and that is why they now put gauze on human wounds and hasten to the injured to bear their blood-stained heads upon the stretchers of their breasts. Unless the tyrant falls — and that’s hereditary too — the poet is condemned to silence and the sharp-edged hand of prison bars will shut his mouth with iron claws. But he will scream his verses through the bars while the burners of books get down to work. But that’s not me! Sometimes he’ll desperately clash his words together to produce some certainty — but there’s no certainty in our world. And vainly does he fling his fiery words far, even beyond death, to dangle some mute mystery, to lighten the darkness that lies motionless on this mass grave and merely clings to miserable bones, spattered with verdigris from the lighter they overlooked in the executed man’s trouser pocket. But that’s not me! *\n\n*\n\n*\n\nI never told anyone about it but I was there. The night birds will testify to it, the barn owls and the nightjars, whose sight is penetrating even in the dark. 74\n\nChildren are not believed, it’s said they lie, but I was there, I was there1. Midnight had gone, the stars were shining as if crying and I was shivering with cold on those last rungs high up, right at the top of Jacob’s ladder. It rested firmly on the ground and leaned against a cloud. But halfway up, above a drift of stars, I froze in terror: a gilded harp was flying upside down, from nowhere into nowhere, circling the earth all round. Some of its strings were broken and it looked like a wing severed from an angel’s back. No doubt it happened in some cosmic storm when the fine stardust blows into the vast cornfields. The butterflies of spring start in alarm from the wet stones. What happened when I’d climbed the ladder right to the top I’ll tell you in a moment. The memory of it sets my heart aflame. Out of its pitch-black silk — it was that dark — a lovely star emerged and rose upon its silent trajectory, as large as the full moon seen from a window.\n\nIt shone like milk with just a little colour from the blossom that had fallen into it. Such beauty I’d seen once before. It had been my first secret. And yet it was no sin: she was unaware of it. As she undressed her head was turned away. She has long been dead. When I came down again to the larks’ nests and the cockerels crowed their warnings of daybreak I saw yet another thing! What was it? A ray from Alcyone. And down below, an ancient carriage creaked, its wheels crushing the windfalls, while on the horizon stood ftip Hill. *\n\n*\n\n*\n\nOnce I followed my father to an open-air meeting. They sang a different tune: There’ll be an end to emperors and kings and cast off your chains! I would have cast them off except I didn’t feel their weight yet, but I admired the Phrygian cap, the drum on its broad strap and the bullet-torn flags. And the next day I hurried to the Castle up the most beautiful stairway in the world and with a thrill gazed down upon the city.\n\n76\n\nTo have a lute, to have the skill to play it, I could have burst then into joyful song, those days when from the blue upon the sky and from the smiles that were not mine I wove my dreams. Yes, they were childish and quite ridiculous. Then I expunged it all and started out afresh in the same way. I don’t remember now which way I drifted but one brief moment stands before my mind.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThrough a half-open door I saw a hall with people dancing. The drapes inside the windows were all festive as though a canopy held over youth. Young girls in white, young girls in pink, young men in dark, elegant suits were whirling round delightful expectations. Enchantment sometimes makes you catch your breath. And then abruptly someone slammed the door.\n\nOnce only . . . Once only did I see the sun so blood-red. And never again. It sank ominously towards the horizon and it seemed as if someone had kicked apart the gates of hell. I asked at the observatory and now I know why. Hell we all know, it’s everywhere and walks upon two legs. But paradise? It may well be that paradise is only a smile we have long waited for, and lips whispering our name. And then that brief vertiginous moment when we’re allowed to forget that hell exists.\n\nIf you call poetry\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nIf you call poetry a song — and people often do — then I’ve sung all my life. And I marched with those who had nothing, who lived from hand to mouth. I was one of them. I sang of their sufferings, their faith, their hopes, and I lived with them through whatever they had to live through. Through their anguish, weakness and fear and courage and poverty’s grief. And their blood, whenever it flowed, spattered me. Always it flowed in plenty in this land of sweet rivers, grass and butterflies and passionate women. Of women, too, I sang. Blinded by love I staggered through my life, tripping over dropped blossoms or a cathedral step.\n\n79\n\nAt one of his readings . . . At one of his readings a long time ago Jin Mahen whipped out a copy of\n\nLidove noviny: he rolled it into a funnel and, as if through a loud-hailer, exclaimed: “Long live poetry! Long live youth!” Then, that youth was still our own. In those passion-flamed years our lives were burning up more quickly. Jiri Wolker was the first to die. We spoke at his coffin. It was January and a hard frost. 1 hurried away from the grave as if the sexton’s coffin-slings were snaking behind me in the snow. I ran to the railway station so that, as soon as possible, I might put my head on your body’s blossoms. I read my poetry to Josef Hora when his coffin stood before us where he lay in state. I read it over his grave humbly and quietly. From the fortress wall near the cemetery there is a splendid view of Prague, and to the north lies Rip Hill as if tipped out from a child’s hand. It belongs to every one of us but Josef Hora has a special claim.\n\n80\n\nMy love those days was for the maytime meadows near Libune and for those modest hills all round: Kozakov, Tabor, Bradlec, Kumburk and the gentle uplands. All day we’d wander aimlessly around and when no-one was about my lips would pounce on yours and hungrily seek your burning tongue. And tall before us, like a burnt-out lyre, towered the ruin of Trosky. When Halas was dying I wrote a few quiet lines for him about our youth. They weren’t particularly good but they were the last he read. He smiled as people smile when they know they’ll soon be dying. To this day his wistful smile follows my verses. I wrote wherever I could: at window tables in cafes, on ink-stained desks at the post office, with the telegraph ticking. But best I liked writing at home. You’d sit by the standard lamp and I could hear your needle piercing the stretched canvas. Sometimes you were jealous of my poems. They’d drift about with God knows whom and God knows where and you were so close, so very close, no more than two, three paces. Have you ever watched a guitarist? The way he softly places his palm across the strings\n\nand they all fall silent. I have crossed the threshold of that inexorable moment and in my mouth there is a bitter taste as if I’d bitten through a stalk of wormwood I could not break.\n\nThe Cry of the Spectres In vain do we reach for wind-blown cobwebs and for barbed wire. In vain do we dig in our heels so we shouldn’t be dragged quite so brutally into the darkness that is blacker than the blackest night and lacks its crown of stars. And each day we meet someone who gratuitously asks us without opening his mouth: When? How? And what comes after? Just one more moment to dance and prance and breathe the perfumed air, even with a noose round your neck! In the dentist’s waiting room I saw in a torn illustrated monthly a rose-red terra-cotta statuette. I’d seen one like it once in a case at the Louvre. They’d found it in the marble tomb Of a young girl who died long before Christ was born.\n\nThe baked-clay figurine knows all about death. It could tell a tale. It stays silent and smiles. When the girl died she must have heard the cry of the Empusa who used to haunt the ones about to die and guarded graves. She had one metal leg and one of donkey dung and screamed as the shades of the dead scream on the banks of the Acheron. Of course, the ancient spectres are now dead — but new ones are being born. Hello, operator, you didn’t catch that? Em — pu — sa. I will spell it for you: E — as in erotic M — as in mistress P — as in purity U — as in ugliness S — as in sparkle A — as in amaranth. Got it? Then continue writing, Please. As the soul escaped from the girl’s lips and dissolved in the blue, the girl’s mouth withered like a broken flower. The statuette still smiled, a favourite of the girl while alive, and then went smiling with her to the grave to watch how presently the angel of putrefaction stepped close to the girl’s body\n\nand swiftly tore her skin with purple nails. For years the spectres hung about the spot and with their voices terrified the living who were nearby. But all has long been silent there. But behind the holly bush pilgrims sometimes rest and to their lips they raise the reed-pipes they carry in their cloaks. Where did I hear that song of the girl’s flimsy tunic? She resisted so little she was easily overcome. Once it slid down the shoulder’s curve the palm was scarcely halted by the breast when it found itself cupped in it like a lamb that had strayed into a wolf-trap. All that was left were some handfuls of dust, no more. He rose in the dark and again sat down in the vast space of the tomb. And through a crack between the slabs like the barking of dogs now and then burst the fragrance of violets.\n\n84\n\nPlace of Pilgrimage After a long journey we awoke in the cathedral’s cloisters, where men slept on the bare floor. There were no buses in those days, only trams and the train, and on a pilgrimage one went on foot. We were awakened by bells. They boomed from square-set towers. Under their clangour trembled not only the church but the dew on the stalks as though somewhere quite close above our heads elephants were trampling on the clouds in a morning dance. A few yards from us the women were dressing. Thus did I catch a glimpse for only a second or two of the nakedness of female bodies as hands raised skirts above heads. But at that moment someone clamped his hand upon my mouth so that I could not even let out my breath. And I groped for the wall. A moment later all were kneeling before the golden reliquary hailing each other with their songs. I sang with them. But I was hailing something different, yes and a thousand times, gripped by first knowledge.\n\n85\n\nThe singing quickly bore my head away out of the church. In the Bible the Evangelist Luke writes in his gospel, Chapter One, Verse Twenty-six the following: And the winged messenger flew in by the window into the virgin’s chamber softly as the barn-owl flies by night, and hovered in the air before the maiden a foot above the ground, imperceptibly beating his wings. He spoke in Hebrew about David’s throne. She dropped her eyes in surprise and whispered: Amen and her nut-brown hair fell from her forehead onto her prie-dieu. Now I know how at that fateful moment women act to whom an angel has announced nothing. They first shriek with delight, then they sob and mercilessly dig their nails into man’s flesh. And as they close their womb and tense their muscles a heart in tumult hurls wild words up to their lips. I was beginning to get ready for life and headed wherever the world was most exciting. I well recall the rattle of rosaries at fairground stalls like rain on a tin roof,\n\nand the girls, as they strolled among the stalls, nervously clutching their scarves, liberally cast their sparkling eyes in all directions, and their lips launched on the empty air the flavour of kisses to come. Life is a hard and agonizing flight of migratory birds to regions where you are alone. And whence there’s no return. And all that you have left behind, the pain, the sorrows, all your disappointments seem easier to bear than is this loneliness, where there is no consolation to bring a little comfort to your tear-stained soul. What use to me are those sweet sultanas! Good thing that at the rifle booth I won a bright-red paper rose! I kept it a long time and still it smelled of carbide.\n\n87\n\nCanal Gardens Not till old age did I learn to love silence. Sometimes it is more exciting than music. In silence tremulous signals appear and at the crossroads of memory you hear names which time has tried to stifle. At nightfall in the trees I can often hear even the hearts of birds. And once in the churchyard I caught the sound, deep down in a grave, of a coffin splitting. On a forgotten stone block in the garden, hewn in a sea-shell’s shape, children used to play till dusk. I can remember it from childhood. They were still playing there, even then. It probably was the last surviving stone from an old garden. Nothing else was left. Only a fountain and a tree, only a violated fountain and a half-shrivelled tree whose trunk was perforated by a revolver bullet. Night, that merciless keeper of darkness, hurriedly pours the red dawn from the sky like the bloody water in which Monsieur Marat was murdered by a fair-haired beauty’s dagger, and now it begins to rip off people’s shadows\n\nas a tailor rips off tacked sleeves when fitting a jacket. Everything on earth has happened before, nothing is new, but woe to the lovers who fail to discover a fresh blossom in every future kiss. The light still lies on the flower beds and on the gentle path. Among the flowers, taking a walk, is Count Joseph Emanuel Canal de Malabaile and with the hem of his exalted cloak he bends the flower heads, which straighten up again at once. Jews not admitted! Well, really! Each of us walks toward his own abyss. There are two: the deep sky overhead and the grave. The grave is deeper. By the pool’s edge stands the statue of a goddess hewn from white stone. The damp sleek curves of her quivering body are like whipped cream. Where have the ancient skies gone, where would she tie her flaxen hair in a honey-hued knot? With slender arm she covers her breasts and bends gently forward as if about to step into the pond locked up by pale-pink water lilies just unfolding.\n\n89\n\nHer belly, mirrored in the surface, resembles Orpheus’s divine instrument which the Thracian women wrested from his hands and flung into the Hebrus. Upon the lintels of the doors they wrote the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty nine with hallowed chalk. In the stalls of the Stavovske Theatre stood a poet nervously waiting for one of the boxes to open and for a countess to enter. Deep inside him at that moment screamed enamoured folly. He lived in Michalska Street at The Red Cockerel, and since he had no furniture he wrote his poems lying on the floor, dipping his pen in an inkstand pinned to the floorboards. Be quiet, clumps of roses, don’t whisper her name to me. Reeds on the lake, be still and do not rustle, that I may not hear the silk of her skirts as she leaves for the waiting coach. . . Never, never will she stroke the thin beard on my chin, never shall I submerge my mouth in her body. I wish I had never seen her, then she would not have chopped off my head each time with the sword of her beauty.\n\n90\n\nThe following day he again stood patiently by the column in the theatre fixedly staring at the empty box. As she came in she sat down in a velvet armchair, she briefly shut her bewitching eyes with their long lashes as a carnivorous plant closes its sticky blooms from which there’s no escape. Oh shade your eyes, my love, or I’ll go mad. He was young, he went mad and died. Night, eternal ant-heap of the stars, and what else? In the green shade of the arbour lovers were kissing. Lips kissed a hundred times whispering ardent words to lips kissed a hundred times, lighting blood’s pounding path to passion’s farthest regions. A pair of daggers, tongues mutually stabbed desire-stirred mouths. The evening star that night was Venus. Let us return to the noble count. He was fond of music and instructed his musicians to play their wind instruments concealed in the garden’s shrubberies.\n\nThe musicians breathed into their instruments the heavy scent of flowers and under the touch of their fingers it changed into love songs for dancing. Here they are! If you feel like dancing dance! If the coral point of one of the two rounded hills of graceful obstinacy wrote on my coat, as we were dancing, a few letters from the Morse alphabet it did not necessarily mean a thing. This happens. It may even happen by chance. But I would usually see it as a call from another planet orbiting round my forehead. Someone perhaps will shrug: What of it? But I have given all my life to just this call. After the dance the weary lady sat down on the silky lawn, spreading the muslin of her ample skirts around herself like spreading circles on the water. I heard her carefree laughter but I came too late. When one grows old one always comes too late, and in the end one even envies the lawn\n\n92\n\ntwo dimples made by a girl’s knees. I was lucky. Hand in hand the exhilarated couples danced on the trampled grass around the trees. Only once in my life did I meet that girl. With a smile she invited me to her side, the way people invite each other when they sometimes feel that a word would be too bold. Presently she slowed her pace to let me catch up with her. Wherever you wish me to follow I’ll gladly go. Even to the rock where sulphur flowers bloom close to the crater’s rim. That far she didn’t want to go with me. A shiver ran over her as if death had touched her. At least give me your hand — goodbye. She hesitated briefly but, as goodbye, she dug her mouth into my mouth like tiger’s claws. I look at your forehead as a pilot at his cockpit panel when he has flown into a storm. I met you so late and so unexpectedly. I know you were hidden in a deep drift of hair.\n\nIt glowed in the dark but I sought you in vain. On my empty palm there was gold dust. Then you escaped through the fence of your lashes into your laughter. And June, in festive garb, filled our windows with jasmine. But in the end you vanished into the snow of your silence. How could I even catch a glimpse of you that far away? It was cold and dusk began to fall. You may tear up my poems and cast the shreds to the wind. Crumple my letters and burn them in the fire. But what will you do with my face cast in misted metal no bigger than a hand? You always had it before your eyes! Do with it what your disappointment leads you to do. But one more time, one last time, you will hold my head between your hands. The count is dead, the countess is dead, the poet is dead. The musicians are dead. All my loves are dead, and I myself am getting ready to go.\n\n94\n\nAt least that is how it sometimes seems to me when I gaze into your distant eyes and in the distance vainly seek the very last stone in the garden, which too is dead.\n\nThe Plague Column To the four corners of the earth they turn: the four demobilized knights of the heavenly host. And the four corners of the earth are barred behind four heavy locks. Down the sunny path the ancient shadow of the column staggers from the hour of Shackles to the hour of Dance. From the hour of the Rose to the hour of the Dragon’s Claw. From the hour of Smiles to the hour of Wrath. From the hour of Hope to the hour of Never, whence it is just a short step to the hour of Despair, to Death’s turnstile. Our lives run like fingers over sandpaper, days, weeks, years, centuries. And there were times when we spent long years in tears.\n\nI still walk round the column where so often I waited, listening to the water gurgling from apocalyptic mouths, always astonished at the water’s flirtatiousness as it splintered on the basin’s surface until the Column’s shadow fell across your face. That was the hour of the Rose. You there, young lad, do me a favour: climb up on the fountain and read out to me the words the four Evangelists are writing on their stone pages. The Evangelist Matthew is first. And which of us from pure joy can add to his life’s span one cubit? And what does Mark, the second, write? Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel and not to be set on a candlestick? And the Evangelist Luke? The light of the body is the eye. But where many bodies are thither will many eagles be gathered together. And lastly John, the favourite of the Lord, what does he write? He has his book shut on his lap. Then open it, boy. If needs be with your teeth.\n\nI was christened on the edge of Olsany in the plague chapel of Saint Roch. When bubonic plague was raging in Prague they laid the dead around the chapel. Body upon body, in layers. Their bones, over the years, grew into rough-stacked pyres which blazed in the quicklime whirlwind of clay. For a long time I would visit these mournful places, but I did not forsake the sweetness of life. I felt happy in the warmth of human breath and when I roamed among people I tried to catch the perfume of women’s hair. On the steps of the Olsany taverns I used to crouch at night to hear the coffin-bearers and grave-diggers singing their rowdy songs. But that was long ago, the taverns have fallen silent, the grave-diggers in the end buried each other. When spring came within reach, with feather and lute, I’d walk around the lawn with the Japanese cherries on the south side of the chapel and, bewitched by their spring splendour, think about girls silently undressing at night. I did not know their names but one of them,\n\nwhen sleep would not come, tapped softly on my window. And who was it that wrote those poems on my pillow? Sometimes I would stand by the wooden bell tower. The bell was tolled whenever they lifted up a corpse in the chapel. It too is silent now. I gazed on the neo-classical statuary in the Mala Strana cemetery. The statues were still grieving over their dead from whom they’d had to part. Leaving, they walked slowly with the smile of their ancient beauty. And there were among them not only women but also soldiers with helmets, and armed unless I’m mistaken. I haven’t been here for a long time. Don’t let them dupe you that the plague’s at an end: I’ve seen too many coffins hauled through this dark gateway, which is not the only one. The plague still rages and it seems that doctors are giving different names to the disease to avoid a panic. Yet it is still the same old death and nothing else, and it is so contagious no one alive can escape it.\n\n98\n\nWhenever I have looked out of my window, emaciated horses have been drawing that ill-boding cart with a gaunt coffin. Only, those bells aren’t tolled so often now, crosses no longer painted on front doors, juniper twigs no longer burnt for fumigation. In the Julian Fields we’d sometimes lie at nightfall, as Brno was sinking into darkness, and in the branches of the Svitava the frogs began their plaint. Once a young gipsy sat down beside us. Her blouse was half unbuttoned and she read our hands. To Halas she said: You won’t live to be fifty. To Artus Cernik: You’ll live until just after that. I didn’t want her to tell my fortune, I was afraid. She seized my hand and angrily exclaimed: You’ll live a long time! It sounded like a threat. The many rondels and the songs I wrote! There was a war all over the world and all over the world was grief. And yet I whispered into jewelled ears verses of love. It makes me feel ashamed. But no, not really.\n\n99\n\nA wreath of sonnets I laid upon the curves of your lap as you fell asleep. It was more beautiful than the laurel wreaths of speedway winners. But suddenly we met at the steps of the fountain, we each went somewhere else, at another time and by another path. For a long time I felt I kept seeing your legs, sometimes I even heard your laughter but it wasn’t you. And finally I even saw your eyes. But only once. My skin thrice dabbed with a swab soaked in iodine was golden brown, the colour of the skin of dancing girls in Indian temples. I stared fixedly at the ceiling to see them better and the flower-decked procession moved round the temple. One of them, the one in the middle with the blackest eyes, smiled at me. God, what foolishness is racing through my head as I he on the operating table with drugs in my blood. And now they’ve lit the lamp above me, the surgeon brings his scalpel down and firmly makes a long incision. Because I came round quickly 100\n\nI firmly closed my eyes again. Even so I caught a glimpse of female eyes above a sterile mask just long enough for me to smile. Hallo, beautiful eyes. By now they had ligatures round my blood vessels and hooks opening up my wounds to let the surgeon separate the paravertebral muscles and expose the spines and arches. I uttered a soft moan. I was lying on my side, my hands tied at the wrists but with my palms free: these a nurse was holding in her lap up by my head. I firmly gripped her thigh and fiercely pressed it to me as a diver clutches a slim amphora streaking up to the surface. Just then the pentot"
