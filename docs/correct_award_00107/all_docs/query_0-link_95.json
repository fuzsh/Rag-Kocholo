        "text": "Jaroslav Seifert (1901 - 1986) was a Czechoslovakian writer, poet and journalist. His first collection of poems was published in 1921. He was a member ofthe Communist Party, the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines - Rovnost, Srsatec, and Reflektor - and the employee of a communist publishing house. During the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovakian artistic avant-garde.\n\nIn March 1929, he and six other important communist writers were expelled from the Communist Party for signing a manifesto protesting against Bolshevik tendencies in the new leadership of Czechoslovakia's Communist Party."
