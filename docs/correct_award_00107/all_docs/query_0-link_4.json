        "text": "Jaroslav Seifert\n\nPoetry\n\nAutobiography\n\nSometimes\n\nwhen she would talk about herself\n\nmy mother would say:\n\nMy life was sad and quiet,\n\nI always walked on tip-toe.\n\nBut if I got a little angry\n\nand stamped my foot\n\nthe cups, which had been my mother’s,\n\nwould tinkle on the dresser\n\nand make me laugh.\n\nAt the moment of my birth, so I am told,\n\na butterfly flew in by the window\n\nand settled on my mother’s bed,\n\nbut that same moment a dog howled in the yard.\n\nMy mother thought\n\nit a bad omen.\n\nMy life of course has not been quite\n\nas peaceful as hers.\n\nBut even when I gaze upon our present days\n\nwith wistfulness\n\nas if at empty picture frames\n\nand all I see is a dusty wall,\n\nstill it has been so beautiful.\n\nThere are many moments\n\nI cannot forget,\n\nmoments like radiant flowers\n\nin all possible colours and hues,\n\nevenings filled with fragrance\n\nlike purple grapes\n\nhidden in the leaves of darkness.\n\nWith passion I read poetry\n\nand loved music\n\nand blundered, ever surprised,\n\nfrom beauty to beauty.\n\nBut when I first saw\n\nthe picture of a woman nude\n\nI began to believe in miracles.\n\nMy life unrolled swiftly.\n\nIt was too short\n\nfor my vast longings,\n\nwhich had no bounds.\n\nBefore I knew it\n\nmy life’s end was drawing near.\n\nDeath soon will kick open my door\n\nand enter.\n\nWith startled terror I’ll catch my breath\n\nand forget to breathe again.\n\nMay I not be denied the time\n\nonce more to kiss the hands\n\nof the one who patiently and in step with me\n\nwalked on and on and on\n\nand who loved most of all.\n\n“Autobiography” from The Poetry of Jaroslav Seifert\n\nTranslated from the Czech by Ewald Osers\n\nEdited by George

love\n\ntry falling in love again —\n\nsay, with the Queen of England.\n\nWhy not!\n\nHer features are on every postage stamp\n\nof that ancient kingdom.\n\nBut if you were to ask her\n\nfor a date in Hyde Park\n\nyou can bet that\n\nyou’d wait in vain.\n\nIf you’ve any sense at all\n\nyou’ll wisely tell yourself:\n\nWhy of course, I know:\n\nit’s raining in Hyde Park today.\n\nWhen he was in England\n\nmy son bought me in London’s Piccadilly\n\nan elegant umbrella.\n\nWhenever necessary\n\nI now have above my head\n\nmy own small sky\n\nwhich may be black\n\nbut in its tensioned wire spokes\n\nGod’s mercy may be flowing like\n\nan electric current.\n\nI open my umbrella even when it’s not raining,\n\nas a canopy\n\nover the volume of Shakespeare’s sonnets\n\nI carry with me in my pocket.\n\nBut there are moments when I am frightened\n\neven by the sparkling bouquet of the universe.\n\nOutstripping its beauty\n\nit threatens us with its infinity\n\nand that is all too similar\n\nto the sleep of death.\n\nIt also threatens us with the void and frostiness\n\nof its thousands of stars\n\nwhich at night delude us\n\nwith their gleam.\n\nThe one we have named Venus\n\nis downright terrifying.\n\nIts rocks are still on the boil\n\nand like gigantic waves\n\nmountains are rising up\n\nand burning sulphur falls.\n\nWe always ask where hell is.\n\nIt is there!\n\nBut what use is a fragile umbrella\n\nagainst the universe?\n\nBesides, I don’t even carry it.\n\nI have enough of a job\n\nto walk along\n\nclinging close to the ground\n\nas a nocturnal moth in daytime\n\nto the coarse bark of a tree.\n\nAll my life I have sought the paradise\n\nthat used to be here,\n\nwhose traces I have found\n\nonly on women’s lips\n\nand in the curves of their skin\n\nwhen it is warm with love.\n\nAll my life I have longed\n\nfor freedom.\n\nAt last I’ve discovered the door\n\nthat leads to it.\n\nIt is death.\n\nNow that I’m old\n\nsome charming woman’s face\n\nwill sometimes waft between my lashes\n\nand her smile will stir my blood.\n\nShyly I turn my head\n\nand remember the Queen of England,\n\nwhose features are on every postage stamp\n\nof that ancient kingdom.\n\nGod save the Queen!\n\nOh yes, I know quite well:\n\nit’s raining in Hyde Park today.\n\n“An Umbrella from Piccadilly” from The Poetry of Jaroslav Seifert\n\nTranslated from the

rain lashed the windows.\n\nI couldn’t go to sleep.\n\nSo I switched on the light\n\nand wrote a letter.\n\nIf love could fly,\n\nas of course it can’t,\n\nand didn’t so often stay close to the ground,\n\nit would be delightful to be enveloped\n\nin its breeze.\n\nBut like infuriated bees\n\njealous kisses swarm down upon\n\nthe sweetness of the female body\n\nand an impatient hand grasps\n\nwhatever it can reach,\n\nand desire does not flag.\n\nEven death might be without terror\n\nat the moment of exultation.\n\nBut who has ever calculated\n\nhow much love goes\n\ninto one pair of open arms!\n\nLetters to women\n\nI always sent by pigeon post.\n\nMy conscience is clear.\n\nI never entrusted them to sparrowhawks\n\nor goshawks.\n\nUnder my pen the verses dance no longer\n\nand like a tear in the corner of an eye\n\nthe word hangs back.\n\nAnd all my life, at its end,\n\nis now only a fast journey on a train:\n\nI’m standing by the window of the carriage\n\nand day after day\n\nspeeds back into yesterday\n\nto join the black mists of sorrow.\n\nAt times I helplessly catch hold\n\nof the emergency brake.\n\nPerhaps I shall once more catch sight\n\nof a woman’s smile,\n\ntrapped like a torn-off flower\n\non the lashes of her eyes.\n\nPerhaps I may still be allowed\n\nto send those eyes at least one kiss\n\nbefore they’re lost to me in the dark.\n\nPerhaps once more I shall even see\n\na slender ankle\n\nchiselled like a gem\n\nout of warm tenderness,\n\nso that I might once more\n\nhalf choke with longing.\n\nHow much is there that man must leave behind\n\nas the train inexorably approaches\n\nLethe Station\n\nwith its plantations of shimmering asphodels\n\namidst whose perfume everything is forgotten.\n\nIncluding human love.\n\nThat is the final stop:\n\nthe train goes no further.\n\n“Fragment of a Letter” from The Poetry of Jaroslav Seifert\n\nTranslated from the Czech by Ewald Osers\n\nEdited by George Gibian\n\nCopyright © 1998 by Ewald Osers and George Gibian\n\nUsed by permission of Catbird Press\n\nAll rights reserved\n\nTo Be a Poet\n\nLife taught me long ago\n\nthat music and poetry\n\nare the most beautiful things on earth\n\nthat life can give us.\n\nExcept for love, of course.\n\nIn an old textbook\n\npublished by the Imperial Printing House\n\nin the year of Vrchlický’s death\n\nI looked up the section on poetics\n\nand poetic ornament.\n\nThen I placed a rose in a tumbler,\n\nlit a candle\n\nand started to write my first verses.\n\nFlare up, flame of words,\n\nand soar,\n\neven if my fingers get burned!\n\nA startling metaphor is worth more\n\nthan a ring on one’s finger.\n\nBut not even Puchmajer’s Rhyming Dictionary\n\nwas any use to me.\n\nIn vain I snatched for ideas\n\nand fiercely closed my eyes\n\nin order to hear that first magic line.\n\nBut in the dark, instead of words,\n\nI saw a woman’s smile and\n\nwind-blown hair.\n\nThat has been my destiny.\n\nAnd I’ve been staggering towards it breathlessly\n\nall my life.\n\n“To Be a Poet” from The Poetry of Jaroslav Seifert\n\nTranslated from the Czech by Ewald Osers\n\nEdited by George
