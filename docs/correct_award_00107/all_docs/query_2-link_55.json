Wenceslas Square, the main Prague Boulevard with many shops, restaurants and open-air markets is close by and all the most important sights of the city can be reached easily. Seifert Hotel Prague was established in 2006 and offers 30 rooms comfortably equipped with modern furniture, bathroom (shower or bath, WC), complimentary toiletries, TV/SAT, direct dial phone, hair dryer, ceiling ventilator, in-room safe deposit and tea & coffee making facilities free of charge. The reception desk is available to guests 24 hours a day and offers drinks, money exchange services, sightseeing tours, excursions, ordering of taxi, laundry and other services.\n\nHotel Seifert bears the name of a Nobel prize winning Czech writer, poet and journalist, Jaroslav Seifert (1901 – 1986).\n\nSeifert was born in Žižkov and published his first collection of poems in 1921. He was a member of the Communist Party, editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines and the employee of a communist publishing house. During the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovak avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal Devetsil. In March 1929, he and six other important communist writers were expelled from the Communist Party for signing a manifesto protesting against Bolshevik tendencies in the new leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1949, Seifert left journalism and devoted himself exclusively to literature. His poetry was awarded important state prizes in 1936, 1955, and 1968, and in 1967 he was designated National Artist. He was the official Chairman of the Czechoslovak Writers’ Union for several years (1968-70). In 1977, he signed the Charter 77 in opposition to the repressive regime of the time.\n\nSeifert was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1984 - \"for his poetry which endowed with freshness, sensuality and rich inventiveness provides a liberating image of the indomitable spirit and versatility of man\".\n\nPhone Number: +420 724 720 742Address:\n\nKonevova 8 Prague Czech RepublicWeb Address: [Web Link]\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\n1.
