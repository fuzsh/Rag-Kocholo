        "text": "Jaroslav Seifert was born in 1901 in the former working class suburb of Zizkov, not far from today's Seifertova Street. Influenced by the poor urban environment, Seifert joined the Communist Party in 1921 only to be expelled from it eight years later for his criticism of its Bolshevik tendencies.\n\nJaroslav Seifert was a prolific writer and his career spanned 60 years and several styles: from proletarian poetry, to the playful avant-garde, to poems celebrating women and love to more serious verses dedicated to his homeland.\n\nPrevious attempts at publishing Seifert's collected works were tainted by censorship and finally failed when the publishing house went bankrupt in the 1990s. Now, publisher Jiri Tomas, in cooperation with literary historians, is hoping to be the one to bring the ambitious project to a successful end.\n\n\"This is the third attempt at publishing Seifert's collected works. We aim to publish not just collections of poems but also poems printed in magazines, his translations and lyrics for plays and films. We'd also like to include selected correspondence and essays. For the first time ever certain pieces are being published as Seifert wrote them, uncensored.\"\n\nJiri Tomas's publishing house has so far brought out 10 out of the intended 17 volumes. But the edition has now been put on hold.\n\n\"Sadly it is for financial reasons. The ten volumes in print include 29 collections, that's 3,200 print pages. It is now the largest edition of Seifert's work so far - and we are 700,000 crowns in the red. So we need some time to recuperate. Not only my wallet but also the readers - they, too, need a rest. And next year, we'd like to carry on with another two volumes.\"\n\nOpinions differ on the subject of Jaroslav Seifert's qualities as a poet. He is sometimes seen as a lightweight poet, not exactly the strongest voice of his generation. There are even some who say Seifert was awarded the Nobel Prize for political reasons rather than artistic merit. But he remains dear to generations of Czechs who above all treasure his love poetry.\n\nFor English-speaking readers several translations of Seifert's poetry are available, from his earlier works \"City in Tears\", \"Sheer Love\" and \"On the Waves of TSF\", to some of his latest collections, such as \"The Plague Column\" and \"An Umbrella from Piccadilly\"."
