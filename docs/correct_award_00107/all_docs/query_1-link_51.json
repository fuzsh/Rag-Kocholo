He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC), the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines – Rovnost, Sršatec, and Reflektor – and the employee of a communist publishing house.\n\nDuring the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovakian artistic avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal Devetsil. In March 1929, he and six other writers left the KSC after signing a manifesto protesting against Bolshevik tendencies in the new leadership of the party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn 1949 Seifert left journalism and began to devote himself exclusively to literature. His poetry was awarded important state prizes in 1936, 1955, and 1968, and in 1967 he was designated National Artist. He was the official Chairman of the Czechoslovak Writer's Union for several years (1968–70). In 1977 he was one of the signatories of Charter 77 in opposition to the government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.\n\nSource and more information: (visit link)\n\nThe monument is located in small urban park.\n\nField of Accomplishment: LiteratureYear of Award: 1984Primary Relevant Web Site: [Web Link]Secondary Relevant Web Site: [Web Link]\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nVISIT LOGS\n\n1.
