        "text": "The scientist who does not dream of receiving the Nobel Prize is unthinkable. The main reason for this research is that fact that just about 2,5% of Nobel Prize winners are Russians. This paper analyzed archive and literature documents about the activity of Alfred Nobel in Russia. In 1879 three Nobel Brothers (including Alfred) founded the &quot;Nobel Brothers Association&quot;, abbreviated as Branobel, in Russia. Success touched Alfred Nobel’s fut in Russian business and part of his profit was secured in Russian Central Bank as we know from Alfred Nobel’s will. As a result of current research author tried to evaluate contribution of A. Nobel’s Russian business in Nobel Foundation and Russian life. Consequently, it was revealed that A. Nobel’s executor Sohlman R. stated that in the assets of the Nobel Prize the originally share of funds received from Branobel activities was about 12%.\n\nAlfred B. Nobel was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm and died on 10 December 1896 in San Remo. On 27 September 1895 he wrote his Will: “I, the undersigned, Alfred Bernhard Nobel, do hereby, after mature deliberation, declare the following to be my last Will and Testament with respect to such property as may be left by me at the time of my death... The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: the capital, invested in safe securities by my executors, shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts [emphasis added, W.O.], which shall be apportioned as follows: These five fields are following: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and fraternity between the nations (promotion of peace).”\n\nThis paper examines the early years of decision making in the award of the Nobel Prize in physics and chemistry, and shows how the prize became a tool in the boundary work which upheld the social demarcations between scientists and inventors, as well as promoting a particular normative view of individual scientific achievement. The Nobel committees were charged with rewarding scientific achievements that benefited humankind: their interpretation of that criterion, however, turned in the first instance on their assessment of the groundbreaking nature of the ‘science’, with the applied or practical ‘benefits’ of that discovery being treated as very much secondary factors in the award. Through an interrogation of the reports sent by the committees to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, this paper shows how committee members depended on a notion of ‘post-dated utilitarianism’ in reconciling potential tension between rewarding basic and applied science, and explores the ways in which ..."
