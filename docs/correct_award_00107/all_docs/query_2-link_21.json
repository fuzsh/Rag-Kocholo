He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC), the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines – Rovnost, Sršatec, and Reflektor – and the employee of a communist publishing house.\n\nDuring the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovakian artistic avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal Devetsil. In March 1929, he and six other writers left the KSC after signing a manifesto protesting against Bolshevik tendencies in the new leadership of the party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn 1949 Seifert left journalism and began to devote himself exclusively to literature. His poetry was awarded important state prizes in 1936, 1955, and 1968, and in 1967 he was designated National Artist. He was the official Chairman of the Czechoslovak Writer's Union for several years (1968–70). In 1977 he was one of the signatories of Charter 77 in opposition to the government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.\n\nSource and more information: (visit link)\n\nPlaque Inscription:\n\nCZ: 3.zárí v 7 hodin 33 minut ráno roku 1901 se v tomto dome narodil básník Jaroslav Seifert\n\nEN: September 3 in 7 hours 33 minutes in the morning 1901, this house was born poet Jaroslav Seifert\n\nName of Famous Person: Jaroslav SeifertPhysical Address: Bořivojova 104, PragueWhat is this person famous for?:\n\na Nobel Prize–winning Czechoslovak writer, poet and journalistWebsite verifying legitimacy of site: [Web Link]Personal Experience:\n\nthis particular area of capital is known for its quirky atmosphere of a slum Other information about area: Additional Website verifying Site legitimacy: Not listed\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nNew logs must include information regarding the waymark.
