In his opening speech in the National Parliamentary Library in Tbilisi Ambassador Tomáš Pernický emphasized that the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Jaroslav Seifert in 1984 not only for his works but also for his integrity. Georgian translator, specialist in Czech studies Maia Nachkebia presented to Georgian audience the personality and works of Jaroslav Seifert, whose works have not yet been translated into the Georgian language and therefore the artist is, regrettably, very little known in Georgia.

The event includes a two-day exhibition „All the Beauties of the World“ consisting of 13 panels with pictures and texts depicting Jaroslav Seifert as citizen, artist as well as brave defender of human rights. The visitors can also see Seifert´s books displayed in showcases.
