The central concern of this article is the Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Jaroslav Seifert in 1984. The paper focuses on the Swedish Academyʼs motivation for the award, on the official award ceremony and banquet, as well as on other related events. It presents translations of Seifertʼs poetry and other texts into Swedish from the 1960s until the mid-1980s as well as the foremost mediators and translators of his work. The reception of Jaroslav Seifertʼs works published in Swedish is monitored through numerous reviews in the Swedish press. Attention is further given to the standpoint of the Czechoslovakian Embassy, which has been documented in a preserved secret report of Jan Kroupa.
