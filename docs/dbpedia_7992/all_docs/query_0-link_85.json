Thomas Kuhn was born in 1922 in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1962, he wrote his groundbreaking work \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" which introduced the concepts of scientific paradigms and challenged the view that science advances through a linear progression. The book transformed the philosophy of science by explaining how social and psychological factors shape science. Kuhn revised the book in 1970 to address criticism. When Kuhn died in 1996, he left a lasting legacy through his concepts of paradigm shifts and how scientific communities develop, which still guide discussions about science and society today.",
