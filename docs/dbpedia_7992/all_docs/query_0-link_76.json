Discusses elements of digital twins and their application in medicine and beyond. https://lnkd.in/d7QZ5f-u\n\nCOP28 UAE presidency is advocating for #actionism - it‚Äôs time to implement #netzero and #naturebasedsolutions with urgency and integrity, at unprecedented rates. No room for errors. We need to learn from the huge mistakes of the voluntary #carbonmarket and make sure we have the governance, accountability frameworks, transparency to implement #NbS with integrity: ecologically sound, socially just, economically viable, and net zero aligned, of course! #biodiversity #naturebasedsolutions #naturefinance #cop28uae #actionism #naturepositive #naturerecovery #netzero #climatechange #climateactionnow\n\nLearn more about the emerging field of complexity science and visualization through the lens of interdisciplinary creativity in this article from Liuhuaying Yang and Paul Kahn: https://ow.ly/z2AM50RB5rN\n\nIn light of the rapidly advancing scientific and technological progress worldwide, the anticipated scientific revolution occurred on March 12, 2024. From now on, nothing will remain the same. We are witnessing the closure of an old era and the dawn of a new one. Are you aware of this?
