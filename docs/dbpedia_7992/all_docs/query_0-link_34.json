        "text": "Intellectual Interlopers.—Philosophy is never systematically scientific, and science is never systematically philosophical. This is an annoyance and a frustration to the philosopher dipping into science, or for the scientist dipping into philosophy. What seems, prima facie, to be a hopeful start inevitably goes sideways as the idea is developed according to the discipline in which it appeared and thus veers away from the special interest of the intellectual interloper. Nevertheless, we need our intellectual interlopers to keep the dialogue between science and philosophy alive, and that means that we need thick-skinned philosophers willing to read science, and thick-skinned scientists willing to read philosophy, both of whom can tolerate the annoyance and overcome the frustration. The depth of the one is a divergence from the interest of the other, so that we only get a glimpse of the conceptual depth of science or philosophy when we can force ourselves to accept the discomfort of a way of thought foreign to our own.\n\nNapoleon was one of the most consequential men of Western history. As such, he has served as a symbol and as an historical ideal, in Huizinga’s sense. But Napoleon meant many things to many men, so his use as a symbol is always ambiguous, and the many meanings that have been associated with the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Empire have never converged on a single vision of history.\n\nTrichotomy of Awareness.—Of any action undertaken, there are aspects of that action of which the agent is self-aware, aspects of the action of which the agent is not aware, and aspects of the action that are an occasion of self-deception on the part of the agent (which latter self-deception we can understand as a kind of self-defeating awareness). If explicit awareness aligns with what is essential in the undertaking, while self-deception aligns with what is merely contingent in the undertaking, then the undertaking may succeed. If, however, explicit awareness aligns with what is merely contingent while self-deception aligns with what is essential, the undertaking will likely fail. Lack of awareness is the wildcard, the blindspot that attends both unlikely successes and unlikely failures, but the basic dichotomy of self-awareness and self-deception, and how they are distributed among the modalities of realization, can be a heuristic for demarcating sanity from madness.\n\nThe World to Come.—The world that follows us will be filled with the things that we made and left behind us, as well as much that we inherited and still remains. In this sense, the future will be familiar. In other ways, the future will be different in trivial but pervasive ways, so that the texture of ordinary life would not be recognizable to us. For example, after we die, there will be songs that become so popular that absolutely everyone knows them. They will be hummed, whistled, sung in the shower, played at weddings, and will work themselves into the ordinary business of life, becoming something that everyone knows, and we will not have heard any of them a single time. Perhaps such songs are already written, but have not yet found their way to recognition, like a book by some forgotten and impoverished soul that makes its author a posthumous success. Quotes from books like these will be as familiar as the popular tunes that we will never know.\n\nThe Permanent Possibility of Formalization.—Even if most reasoning is not fully formalized, knowing that reasoning can be formalized, and reasoning within the parameters of the possibility of formalization, exercises a formal regulatory function over reason. There is much that can go wrong, however, if we adopt this attitude too casually. We may imagine that, as we extrapolate our reasoning into unfamiliar theoretical territory that we are all the time reasoning within the parameters of the possibility of formalization even as we incrementally depart from these parameters. Thus it becomes necessary to regularly recur to full formalization under the changed and changing conditions of our reasoning. It is not enough to clarify the foundations of reasoning a single time, and then to move on to further constructions on this foundation. One must return to the foundations time and again to see how they are bearing up under the superstructure that is being erected upon them.\n\nPater’s book on the renaissance, first published in 1873 as Studies in the History of the Renaissance, and revised in 1877 as The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry, culminated in a passionate philosophy of life based on the ideals of the renaissance, as Pater understood them from his Victorian perspective: “To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.” But can this philosophy of life be translated into a philosophy of history?\n\nAbsolute Freedom and Absolute Responsibility.—There is no greater freedom than to experience the complete and utter indifference of others. As a result, one knows a kind of vertigo in the face of absolute freedom that is disorienting and liable to lead to giddiness and confusion. At the same time, there is no greater burden than absolute freedom, as absolute freedom means absolute responsibility. The burden of absolute freedom that has been exchanged for the good opinion of others is experienced as a profound alienation from all that had previously held meaning and value, and which meaning and value one must now supply out of oneself. To dredge from the depths of one’s being the substance of life necessary to go on another day is to daily risk the exhaustion of one’s resources. One must become, at the deepest level, ontologically productive, or be consumed by the effort.\n\nThe Fickle Masses.—There is a tension in historical explanation between regarding the populace as lazy and easily placated with bread and circuses, on the one hand, while, on the other hand, regarding the populace as easily provoked and liable to riot at any time. Of course, these two positions are not difficult to reconcile: the populace may be both easy to placate and easy to provoke, always balancing on a knife-edge of uncertainty and able to shift suddenly on an apparently insignificant pretext—a late shipment of bread or a commotion at the games might be sufficient to upset the delicate balance.\n\nPopper’s philosophy of history, expressed his The Open Society and Its Enemies in 1945 and The Poverty of Historicisim in 1957, can be understood as an application of his conception of knowledge, worked out in his philosophy of science, to history and the social sciences, which he equates as both being illicitly involved in a project of attempting to make historical predictions. Denying the possibility of prediction in history, Popper argued again historical determinism and inevitability.\n\nTwo Routes to Knowledge.—We can arrive at knowledge through discipline or through love. Discipline yields knowledge without sympathy, remaining blind to much that has inspired the knowledge in question. Love yields understanding without distance, and so tends to distort its object to conform to our desires. It is only when discipline gives way to love or love converges on discipline that knowledge is true to its object.\n\nKuhn wrote an extraordinarily influential book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, first published in 1962, which thereafter changed the way that history and philosophy of science were pursued. Strangely enough, this book appeared in a series of monographs, The International encyclopedia of Unified Science, which was a logical empiricist undertaking, which today seems as dated as Kuhn’s work seems timely. It is ironically appropriate that Kuhn’s work on paradigm shifts appeared within an organ intended to contribute to a paradigm that Kuhn would undermine.\n\nBenjamin is primarily known to philosophy of history through a short essay which was the last he wrote before he killed himself, “On the Concept of History,” though some of his earlier works also betray an interest in history. As a Marxist, Benjamin was explicit in his historical materialism, though he diverges from Marx on several important points. Even as he took over Bloch’s interest in messianism, his work prefigured much that was to come in literary theory."
