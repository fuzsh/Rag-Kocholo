Taylor Pyne Professor of Philosophy and History of Science in 1964.\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions was originally printed as an article in the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science in 1962.\n\nKuhn argued that science does not progress via a linear accumulation of new knowledge but undergoes periodic revolutions.\n\nHis work has been extensively used in social science, such as in the post-positivist/positivist debate within International Relations.\n\nKuhn was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 1954 and was awarded the George Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society in 1982.\n\nHe died in 1996 after being diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nStudying That Suits You\n\nUse AI to generate personalized quizzes and flashcards to suit your learning preferences.\n\nDescription\n\nTest your knowledge on the life and work of Thomas Kuhn, the American philosopher of science who introduced the term \"paradigm shift\" and revolutionized the way we view scientific progress. From his early education to his groundbreaking book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, this quiz will challenge you with interesting facts and concepts related to Kuhn's ideas and contributions to the field of philosophy and history of science.
