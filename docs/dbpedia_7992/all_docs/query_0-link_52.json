Kuhn). He was an American physicist, historian and philosopher of science whose controversial 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was influential in both academic and popular circles, introducing the term paradigm shift, which has since become an English-language idiom.[1]\n\nOn 25 Apr 1930 at the time of the 1930 US Census, head of household Samuel Kuhn (age 35, born in Ohio) was employed as an Executive working in Investments and living in a home he rented for $350 at 137 East 94th in Manhattan, New York with his wife, Minette S. Kuhn (age 32, born in NY); son Thomas S. Kuhn (age 7, born in OH); son Roger T. Kuhn (age 5, born in NY); servant Margaret B. Couser (age 22, born in Scotland); lodger and servant Charlotte A. Helm (age 28, born in Germany); servant Hannah Schweigert (age 28, born in Germany). Samuel was first married at age 26; Minette was first married at age 23. Both of Samuel's parents were born in Ohio; both of Minette's parents were born in New York.
