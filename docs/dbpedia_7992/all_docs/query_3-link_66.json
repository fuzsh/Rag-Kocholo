        "text": "Hi, I am Arkadiusz Synowczyk. I am a philosophy student at Newcastle University (UK). My areas of specialization are epistemology (the theory of knowledge) and philosophy of science. You can find me on Twitter.\n\nThomas Kuhn is one of the most influential philosophers of science of the twentieth century. His most famous book â€“ The Structure of Scientific Revolutions â€“ is the most cited social science book in history and one of the most cited academic books of all time.\n\nGiven such an influence of Kuhn, it is important to understand and know his ideas. But what are those? The central ideas of his philosophy of science, like incommensurability or world-change, are often difficult to understand. Moreover, some claim that he was a radical relativist who attacked science. Others â€“ including Kuhn himself â€“ deny the charge.\n\nThis salon aims to explain Kuhnâ€™s philosophy of science and answer the ambiguities about his ideas. But thatâ€™s not all. One of the most important reasons to care about ideas is their real-life consequences. Therefore, the second aim of this salon is to engage in a moderated discussion about 1) the concrete, practical consequences of accepting his ideas, and 2) whether his ideas are true or not (or even whether truth is a legitimate concept).\n\nIf you have any questions about the salon, contact me via arkadiuszsynowczyk@gmail.com.\n\nRecommended readings:\n\nPostscript to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn (publicly available through Google)\n\nReadings for advanced study:\n\nThomas Kuhn by Alexander Bird\n\nThomas Kuhn by Thomas Nickles\n\nInterpreting Kuhn: Critical Essays by K. Brad Way\n\n***\n\nðŸ—“ ii Calendar\n\nðŸ“‹ Code of Conduct"
