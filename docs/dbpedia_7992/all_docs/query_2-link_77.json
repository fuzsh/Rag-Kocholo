        "text": "Thomas Joel Kuhn, 70, formerly of Hays, KS, passed away peacefully at home December 21st, 2023, in Prairie Village, KS after a long bout with Lewy Body Dementia.\n\nHe was born November 28, 1953, as a twin in Beloit, KS to Frederick O. and Lola Catherine Pargett Kuhn.\n\nGraduating from Cawker City High School in 1971, Tom went on to Fort Hays State University, Hays, KS to earn a B.S. degree in English Journalism and a M.S. in Guidance and Counseling. He met the love of his life while at FHSU.\n\nOn June 19, 1976, Tom married Cathy Ann Nauert in Larned, KS. They settled in Hays where they raised a family of 2 amazing boys. He was employed with Kansas SRS and at Fort Hays State University as the Human Resource Director until retiring in 2012, meeting many wonderful people there. In 2020 Tom and Cathy moved to Prairie Village, KS to be closer to the children.\n\nTom grew up on the family farm near the Nebraska border north of Cawker City, KS alongside his two brothers. His love of the outdoors began on the farm which he lovingly referred to as “God’s Country”. His greatest enjoyment came from family, spending quality time with their two sons and bicycling across Kansas numerous times as well as the United States on three routes. He completed the Triple Bypass and Pedal the Peaks along with other bicycling events. Tom also had a passion for running, finishing several half and full marathons during his lifetime. Two of his most favorite things to do included having coffee with the boys and spending time in his bike shed which was built by his oldest son.\n\nSurvivors include his wife Cathy, of the home; two sons, Brian and wife Courtney Kuhn of Prairie Village, KS (granddaughters Reese and Marlow), Brandon and wife Ann Kuhn (granddaughter arriving in 2024) of Buffalo, N.Y.; his twin brother Tim and wife Faye of Pratt, KS, his sister-in-law Carol Kuhn of Beloit, KS. He had four other sisters-in law and two brothers-in law: Carol Mott of Wichita, KS, Connie Lett of Olathe, KS, Cherie (Terry) Berndt of Manhattan, KS, and Cristi (Richard) Mourn of Colorado Springs, CO; and nieces and nephews Kelli (Tim) Barker, Kristen (Jake) Windscheffel, Ryan (Haley) Mott, Melissa Mott, Ethan Lett, Hunter Berndt, Austin (Starla) Mourn, Cambria (John) Szabo, Jenna Mourn, and 5 great nieces and 7 great nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his grandparents, parents, a brother, Carle, and his only uncle, Roland Kuhn.\n\nA celebration of life will be at a later date. Cremation has taken place, and his ashes will be taken to the Kuhn Family Farm in a private ceremony.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please perform a random act of kindness in Tom’s memory or donate to your favorite charity/organization."
