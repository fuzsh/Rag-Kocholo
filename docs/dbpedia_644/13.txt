MENDE, Elke - It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Elke Mende, our most loved sister, sister in law, aunt and (great) aunt on July 30, 2016. Elke was born May 9, 1942 in Berlin, Germany. She emigrated to Canada in 1972 and worked as Executive Housekeeper for various hotels in Quebec, B.C and many years at the Banff Park Lodge where she was a highly respected leader and well known amongst all staff. Elke suffered several strokes during the past 14 years, yet always regained her amazing strength, determination, sense of humour and strong sense of purpose, proving top neurologists wrong on a regular basis. Her unwavering optimism was an inspiration to all who knew her. During her 35 years in Banff, she was an avid volunteer for Victim Services, Mineral Springs Hospital, and Seniors Community Services. Elke was also a foster parent to more than 12 children internationally. With her love and knowledge of music, especially classical opera, Elke made converts of us all! Elke leaves to mourn her brothers, Peter (Helga) of Wiesbaden Germany, and Volker (Bonnie) of Banff, nephews Markus (Maria-Jose), Erich (Meghan), Gregory (Shannon) and niece Jessica (Michael). Elke was a dearly loved great aunt to Melina, Otis, Elliot, Arthur and newborn Hugo. As was her wish, cremation has taken place, no service or celebration will take place and her ashes will be scattered in our mountains. Those who wish to pay tribute to this formidable woman can do so via Foster Plan Canada (info@plancanada.ca). Condolences may be left at BOW RIVER FUNERAL SERVICE assisting the family Telephone 403-678-4880 for further information
