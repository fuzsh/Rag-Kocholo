After graduating from college she found herself spending more and more time outdoors, meditating and trail running. Unhappy with her corporate job, she decided to volunteer for a crisis line and the National Suicide Hotline. This prompted her to think of the connection between mental wellness and the natural world.\n\nHaving only been camping twice before, Crystal decided to move to Utah to pursue a job in wilderness therapy as a backpacking guide and counselor. This work sparked her interest in diversifying the outdoors and engaging Latino communities in the outdoors.

Denise’s fascination for plants and nature led her to study Environmental Horticulture at UC Davis. It was there that Denise got to go on her first hike. This was a life changing experience for her and she now spends most of her spare time hiking around her home in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nAs a Latino Outdoors Programs & Operations Associate, Denise will help provide Latinx communities opportunities to explore the outdoors by ensuring that programs run smoothly.

Luis recalls that his initial passion for the great outdoors was inspired on the fateful day it snowed in Fresno in 1998, an extremely rare occurrence in Fresno. He was amazed seeing snow for the first time and discovered how fascinating nature can be and how it can change over time. Years later, Luis took a trip with his sister to Yosemite and it reignited that same passionate feeling and reverence for the beauty of the outdoors. Although it took him a little while to figure it out, that memory inspired him to pursue a Bachelors of Science degree in Recreation and Community Events at Fresno State University. On weekends, Luis and his friends enjoy exploring and hiking new trails.\n\nLuis has over eleven years of administrative support experience at Fresno State University and is excited to bring his experience to Latino Outdoors to assist in any way possible.

She and her family spent many weekends of her childhood traveling to Bay Area parks, lakes, and beaches on a quest to “find some sun” (one of her grandmama’s favorite mantras). Rica developed her love of baseball by enduring windy Giants games at Candlestick Park.\n\nRica lived brief stints in Long Beach, CA and in Tuscany, Italy working in a pastry kitchen and hiking the forest in her free time.\n\nRica loves traveling, taking road trips, and camping. She is on a lifelong search for warmth: be it a sunny day or a crackling campfire. She enjoys watching animals in the wild, the sounds of chirping birds and crashing waves, and the smell of fresh air and redwoods.\n\nShe hopes to visit as many national parks as possible particularly all nine of California’s. Her highlights to date include the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree, and Zion.\n\nAs a Latino Outdoors intern, Rica looks forward to using her Professional Writing and Rhetoric degree from San Francisco State University to help conduct research and interviews and to write profiles with the Yo Cuento team.\n\nDirector of Programs & Operations\n\nRuby Rodríguez (she/her/hers)\n\nRuby was born and raised in Fresno, California, where she was exposed to various forms of the outdoors. Countryside, she ventured into a eucalyptus-lined dirt ditch during the summer months of her childhood. The ditch offered a concrete bridge at one end and pond at the other—perfect for splashing around with tadpoles and water striders. The adjacent open field lent itself to Ruby’s introversion and fondness of plant life, ladybugs, and daydreaming.\n\nThough her conscious connection to nature fell dormant after a move to the city’s Tower District, remnants of it presented itself in her admiration of the front yards she passed during walks to school. In her early adult years, Ruby found her way to the orchards in nearby Sanger, which inspired a trip to Yosemite National Park. There, she became overwhelmed by the reawakening of her biophilia and has since advocated for outdoor recreation, in its varied forms, as an antithesis to oppression.\n\nRuby’s desire to learn more about where outdoor recreation and self-determination intersect led her to Humboldt State University, where she studied as an undergraduate. During this time in her life and as a Latino Outdoors community member, Ruby enjoyed adding her voice to the conversation about diversifying the outdoor identity. She eventually took the next step from a community member to volunteer and has since grown her role within the organization.\n\nAs the Director of Programs & Operations, Ruby is fiercely passionate about elevating and advocating for LO volunteers as leaders worthy of investing in. She provides vision and leadership to staff and a national network of over 200 volunteers, oversees the day to day operations, and continuously seeks out creative and meaningful ways to advance the LO mission, all while maintaining her appetite for learning and personal growth.\n\nDevelopment Manager\n\nVanessa Herrera (she/her)\n\nVanessa Herrera is originally from the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles. She grew up playing outside with her primos in her family’s backyard and neighborhood parks. In middle school, she was introduced to the wilderness through her school’s Outdoor Education Program. Outdoor Education gave her access to wild places and adventure sports that she never knew existed. From then on, camping, hiking, and multi-day rafting trips have been a large part of her life. Her passion for rivers led her to work as a river guide on the Kern River in California, the Arkansas River in Colorado, the Río Pescados in Mexico, as well as various rivers in Costa Rica. She is happiest when floating downstream and is always excited to introduce new people to the joy of rivers.\n\nVanessa received her bachelor’s degree from UC Santa Cruz in Latin American Studies and her MEd from UCLA. She has spent the last 20 years in education and the nonprofit sector. When she is not working, you can find her playing outside in and along the Kern River or swimming in the Pacific Ocean with her sons and her dog. She is excited to combine her love of the outdoors with her passion for social justice and inclusion in her role as development manager for Latino Outdoors.\n\nvanessaherrera@latinooutdoors.org\n\nSF Bay Area Regional Coordinator\n\nAurora Cortés (she/her/hers)\n\nAurora Cortes was born and raised in Santa Ana, CA.

He was introduced to camping and hiking as a child and his passion for the outdoors only grew as he got older. During college, he squeezed in courses on backpacking, kayaking, and scuba diving before he earned his B.A. in Film and Digital Production where he learned both narrative and documentary filmmaking. His travels around the world from Kenya to Nepal have always left an impact and have given him a sense of excitement and enthusiasm about cultures and learning about the shared experiences of people throughout the world. Being involved and giving back to the community through volunteering has always been a passion for Christian and it is through Latino Outdoors that he was able to combine his love of the outdoors and his desire to create an impact. In addition to being outside, he enjoys supporting social justice causes, being involved in the community and collecting experiences. His background in production led him to a career as a digital and social media specialist which allows him to craft stories, create images, connect to new people, and communicate with underrepresented voices through the digital medium. Christian will focus his teamwork and storytelling skills to further uplift and focus the narrative of the Latinx community in the outdoors, to raise awareness, to ensure representation, access & inclusion for all and to continue the important mission of breaking trail for the next generation of Latinx leaders and to work with volunteers and national team staff to make the great outdoors a little greater.\n\nExecutive Director\n\nLuis Villa (he, his, él)\n\n(he/him/él)\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, Luis is the oldest of five sons to parents from Mexico’s state of Jalisco. The outdoors has always called out to him, including its more subtle expressions, such as his childhood home’s backyard complete with a beautiful, bountiful Persea americana tree that, at approximately 75 years old, gifts several hundred avocados each season to family, friends, and neighbors. Growing up next to the Los Angeles River offered an odd connection to the outdoors. Its concrete riverbed somewhat absurdly serving as a bike path one summer for 10-year-old Luis to pedal from Lynwood all the way to the river’s mouth in Long Beach. In high school, he participated in urban hikes all over southern California, as a member of the marching band. The summer after graduating high school, Luis took up recreational running, first around the perimeter of a city park, and then around the Princeton and Stanford campuses, where he studied as an undergraduate. While at Stanford, Luis enjoyed one of his most memorable outdoor experiences, an exhilarating hike along a portion of the Skyline-to-the-Sea trail organized for incoming transfer students. Beginning inside the magical coast redwood forests of Big Basin Redwoods State Park, it climbed to a breathtaking vista point of the Santa Cruz Mountains and dropped onto Waddell Beach with the Pacific Ocean as an endless backdrop.\n\nAfter graduating with a BA in psychology, Luis began a career dedicated to the nonprofit work, first as a youth case manager in south central Los Angeles, then a program manager with Opportunity Fund, a San Jose, CA-based community development financial institution, and a project manager with Charities Housing, a Bay Area nonprofit affordable housing developer. During this time, Luis took his running and hiking to the trails of Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve, part of the complex of preserves under the stewardship of Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, and promptly experienced poison oak’s unpleasantness for the first time. Bitten by the travel bug, Luis ventured to Costa Rica to volunteer with Habitat for Humanity for several months and ultimately moved there. While in Central America, Luis worked with Nectandra Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation and restoration of tropical cloud forests. (Interestingly, Nectandra, a tree genus emblematic of cloud forests, belongs to the same family, Lauraceae, as the avocado tree from Luis’ childhood.) As Chief Operating Officer, he was responsible for Nectandra’s administrative operations while also managing the Institute’s Eco-Loan Fund, a conservation land acquisition financing program. Wearing rubber boots, Luis found himself running up and down sloping muddy pastures, evaluating eco-loan requests from Nectandra Institute’s community partners looking to acquire important watershed lands, restore the forest on these, and thus improve protection for the mountain springs they depend on for clean drinking water. After twelve years abroad, Luis returned to California with a keener appreciation for nature and the outdoors, whether walking around a city or trekking through a forest.\n\nAs Executive Director for Latino Outdoors, Luis continues to run, now alongside LO’s extraordinary staff and powerful network of volunteer leaders, working together to shape, share, and celebrate the experiences of comunidades latinas outdoors.\n\nAdvisory Board\n\nVolunteer & Advisory Board Member\n\nAndré Sanchez (he/him/él)\n\nAndré volunteers with Latino Outdoors as both a Program Coordinator and Advisory Board member.\n\nGrowing up in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley, André was raised in the agriculturally-fueled and Latine-dominated community of Madera, CA. A community where working the land was the norm and recreating in nature seemed foreign to most members. Fortunately, one of André’s immigrant uncles discovered the joys of getting outdoors and shared the discovery with the family. Through several impactful family trips to the Sierra Nevada mountains and iconic Yosemite National Park, André ultimately developed a passion for conservation and restoration work.\n\nThis passion led him to earn his B.S. in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology from UC Davis. Thereafter, André went on to work for several state and federal agencies, where he worked on habitat restoration and wildlife monitoring projects, including conducting amphibian surveys for Yosemite National Park and monitoring trout populations in southern California’s Santa Monica Mountains. After gaining perspective from his work experiences, André returned to school to pursue an M.S. in Natural Resources with a Watershed Management emphasis at Humboldt State University.\n\nNow residing again in the Madera/Fresno area, André serves as the San Joaquin Valley Organizer for CalWild, where he engages, informs and organizes the area’s communities to advocate for and protect public lands, including some of the outdoor places and ecosystems that inspired him. Outside of this, André coaches youth wrestling and loves to backpack, hike, rock climb, and simply observe nature’s raw beauty.\n\nAs the Latino Outdoors Volunteer for Fresno, André works towards inspiring others about the importance of protecting natural resources by sharing his knowledge of rivers, wildlife, and the different environmental services they provide for people, including clean water, clean air, and respite from everyday life. As a member of the Board, he hopes to further this effort and expand his support of LO’s mission.\n\nAdvisory Board Secretary\n\nAriana Cano (she/her)\n\nDr. Ariana Cano was born in Caracas, Venezuela—an upbringing constantly surrounded by adventures to El Avila and Morrocoy National Parks; the two “outdoor” environments that first introduced her to adventure, camping, and environmental protection.

Her love for the outdoors has grown from hiking to camping in the beautiful bay area. Ruth plans to share her passion for the outdoors by leading camping, hiking and kayaking adventures with the Latino Outdoor community.\n\nProgram Coordinator\n\nRuth Castillo (she/her)\n\nRuth was born in Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico, and later raised in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. In 2021 she moved from Boston to New Hampshire. As a child she spent time going to the ocean in the summers, and on-land outdoor recreation revolved around farm animals and farm work. It was through watching Rocket Power on Nickelodeon en Español that Ruth first learned and became interested in outdoor recreation in the mountains as a means of joy, and the first time she saw Hispanic characters engaging in deportes extremos. It wasn’t until she moved to Maine in 2010 on a university scholarship that she had more access available to experience the outdoors, and started to discover the delight that activities in nature such as rock climbing and hiking brought her. These activities became a means for self-reflection, grounding and growth as she navigated the complexities of new societal norms and culture.

As an adult, she was reintroduced to the outdoors when she took up running. Running eventually led to hiking and exploring many new places. Throughout her travels, she started noticing that there was a lack of representation for the Latinx community. This eventually is what drew her to becoming a volunteer with Latino Outdoors. Ruby is excited to combine her passion for volunteering and the love of the outdoors to build a space that is diverse and welcoming for all who wish to have a special relationship with nature.\n\nOutings Leader\n\nRuby Aguirre-Gutiérrez (ella/she/her)\n\nRuby and her family immigrated from Nayarit, Mexico to Merced, CA where she spent the rest of developing years navigating the public school system and adjusting to the experience of being first generation. One of Ruby’s foundational experience in settling into a new country was visiting Yosemite National Park regularly. Living so close to a national park was a privilege and while also facing social and environmental disparities in her community, this did not stop Ruby from accessing nature, because she does not believe it should be a privilege to have access to clean air and the natural environment.\n\nRuby moved to Northern California where she pursued her bachelor and master’s degree in social work, with a focus in rural and Indigenous communities from Humboldt State University. During Ruby’s time working with Indigenous tribes from the north and through her lived experiences, she witnessed the positive impact that land and culture play into one’s healing journey.
