        "text": "German Figures in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising\n\nFranz Konrad, Jurgen Stroop, Karl-Georg Brandt -\n\nPictured during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (USHMM Archives)\n\nDr. Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg\n\nVon Sammern was born in Greiskirchen in Upper Austria on March 17, 1897. During the First World War he served in the 1st Kaiserschutzen Regiment and the 9th Feldjager Battalion as a mountain infantry lieutenant. He was a prisoner of war from November 1918 to September 1919, in Italy. Von Sammern received a law degree from the University of Innsbruck. He joined the SS on December 1, 1932, where he received the SS membership number of 292792. On March 1, 1933, he joined the German Nazi Party, he had previously joined the Austrian Nazi Party on June 1, 1932.\n\nVon Sammern was promoted to the rank of SS-Untersturmfuhrer on April 20, 1935, and then to the rank of SS-Obersturmfuhrer on November 9, 1936, another promotion soon followed on April 20, 1937, when he became an SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer, and again in the same year on November 9, 1937, when he became an SS-Sturmbannfuhrer. He skipped the rank of SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer, and was promoted directly to the rank of SS-Standartenfuhrer on March 17, 1938.\n\nVon Sammern served as a commander of various SS districts in Germany before the outbreak of the Second World War. He was promoted to the rank of SS-Oberfuhrer on January 30, 1941. He assumed duties as the SS and Police Leader for Warsaw on July 22, 1942, which was the same day as the first mass Jewish resettlement actions from Warsaw to the Treblinka death camp commenced. He remained in this post and was in charge when the deportations resumed in January 1943, following Himmler's visit to Warsaw, in early January. This 'Aktion' was curtailed when the Jewish Underground rose up and disrupted the deportations. He was still performing this role of SSPF Warschau,when the Warsaw Ghetto uprising started on April 19, 1943. He was relieved of duties and replaced by Jurgen Stroop, the same day.\n\nLetter from Von Sammern to Himmler re transfer of Jews to Lublin (Von Sammern personal file)\n\nHowever, this move did not end Von Sammern's career, and his close friendship with Dr. Ernst Kaltenbrunner and Von Sammern then was appointed to become Heinrich Himmler's representative to the Senior Commander of German troops in Croatia. Himmler once described Von Sammern as 'from the cavalry,' very pleasant, but in no way suited to his functions'. On July 15, 1943, Von Sammern assumed duties as the SS and Police Leader 'Essegg.' Von Sammern received the award of an Iron Cross 2nd Class in 1943. He was again promoted to the rank of SS-Brigadefuhrer on April 20, 1944. He was killed in action during an artillery barrage near Banja Luka, on September 20, 1944, while visiting German and Cossack troops fighting Tito's partisans in Yugoslavia. He was posthumously awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.\n\nJurgen Stroop\n\nThe biography for Jurgen Stroop is featured in the main German Biographies section\n\nMax Jesuiter\n\nMax Jesuiter Police Decode - December 1941\n\nMax Jesuiter was born on August 25, 1897, in Stettin, Pomerania.

Max Jesuiter was married but the union did not produce any children.\n\nJesuiter was promoted to the rank of SS-Untersturmfuhrer on November 9, 1934, and further promotions followed in quick succession; SS-Obersturmfuhrer on September 15, 1935, then to SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer on September 13, 1936, and SS-Sturmbannfuhrer on November 9, 1938. He was awarded a War Service Cross 2nd Class during 1941, and a War Service Cross 1st Class in 1943, most likely for his role during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising he served as Chief-of-Staff to Stroop the SS and Police Leader Warsaw, who countersigned the daily reports that Stroop sent to Friedrich-Wilhelm Kruger, the Higher SS and Police Leader East for the Generalgouvernement.\n\nHis personnel file also indicates the award of a Clasp to the Iron Cross 2nd Class (given in lieu of an Iron Cross, which had been awarded to him during the First World War) and an Infantry Assault Badge. The clasp was for Max Jesuiter's role in crushing the Polish Warsaw Uprising which commenced in August 1944. He was promoted to the rank of SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer on April 20, 1944. Max Jesuiter survived the war and afterwards lived in Munich.\n\nKarl Kaleschke\n\nKarl Kaleschke standing next to a captured Jew in the Warsaw Ghetto (USHMM)\n\nKarl Kaleschke was born on February 19, 1895 in Dobrin, in the Czech Republic.
