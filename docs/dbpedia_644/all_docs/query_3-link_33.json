        "text": "January 21, 1945 – Hirschberg, Germany\n\nDecember 14, 2019 – Calgary, Alberta\n\nVolker Mende beloved husband of Bonnie Mende (nee Hewlett) passed away on December 14, 2019 at the age of 74 years.\n\nVolker was born in Hirschberg, Germany on January 21, 1945.\n\nHe met Bonnie in Montreal in 1972, after living in exotic locations around the globe, working with Hilton Hotels.\n\nVolker married Bonnie in 1975 in Montreal. Together with their three young children they moved to Banff in 1983, where they happily resided for thirty-three years on Squirrel Street. Volker was an avid armchair athlete, getting many hours of enjoyment from soccer, car racing and bicycle racing. He will be most remembered for his love of dogs, his no-nonsense personality, his passion and talent for cooking/baking and most importantly spending time with his family, especially his five grandchildren. Bonnie and Volker moved to Crescent Heights in Calgary in August of 2016 to be closer to their brood.\n\nBesides his loving wife Bonnie, Volker is survived by his sons, Erich (Chico) Mende (Meghan Cooper) and Greg Mende (Shannon Mende); daughter Jessica Mende (Mike Peters). He is also survived by his beloved grandchildren, Elliot, Otis, Arthur, Hugo and Julius; brother and sister-in-law, Peter and Helga Mende of Wiesbaden, Germany. Volker was predeceased by his dear sister Elke Mende."
