Ro?ssing in Apartheid Namibia\n\nAbstract\n\nTransnational capital developed Ro?ssing Uranium Limited in South Africa-controlled apartheid Namibia in the 1960s and 1970s. While official newspapers in Windhoek claimed that Ro?ssing was an outcome of renewed hopes of a nuclear energy renaissance after the 1973 oil shock, a closer look at the archives presents a different story. As international pressure increased on the South African government to relinquish its illegitimate control of Namibia—— evident in the International Court of Justice’s advisory opinion in June 1971, activism of Sean MacBride as the UN Commissioner for Namibia, and the UN Decree 1 of December 1974—— foreign mining companies increased their extractivism of Namibian natural resources, including uranium. Fearing that an independent and universal Namibia would evict them, these companies began overmining, exporting raw materials and continuing to dispossess Black labor. Ro?ssing was similar but different: it was a combination of the old and the new. Built through majority funding from the Anglo- Australian Rio Tinto Zinc along with contributions from Canadian Rio Algom, French Total Compagnie Minie?re et Nucle?aire, and South African Industrial Development Corporation, it functioned as a secretive and repressive proto-state, while also coopting the language of corporate social responsibility of the 1970s through its philanthropic Ro?ssing Foundation. It was a joint-stock company established with White capital that was closely aligned locally with the German Sudwester settler identity of Swakopmund while dispossessing Black Native laborers toiling in Arandis, Damaraland. Based on corporate and business archives (Ro?ssing, Total Energies, and National Association of Manufacturers), international archives (UNESCO, UNCN, and United Nations), and activists’ collections (Barbara Rogers papers and CANUC), this chapter presents Ro?ssing as a transimperial reactionary bloc throughout the 1970s and 1980s determined first, to prevent independence of Namibia and second, to survive unscathed should independence arrive anyway.\n\nWednesday 9 October 2024 12:30-14:00\n\nR1-09\n\nKOUDIJS Peter (University Rotterdam) : Collateral damage: The impact of finance on slavery\n\nWednesday 23 October 2024 12:30-14:00\n\nR1-09\n\nROY Sutanuka (Australian National University) : Impact of British Colonial Gender Reform on Early Female Marriages and Gender Gap in Education: Evidence from Child Marriage Abolition Act, 1929\n\nAbstract\n\nThe British colonial government set the minimum age at first marriage for females as 14 years in British India in 1929. It was not implemented until 1930, six months after its announcement. Using the princely states as a control group, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the causal impact of the abolition of female child marriage below the age of 14. Analyzing historical census data from 1911 to 1981, we find an anticipation effect: female child marriages increased in 1931 but declined sharply in the post-independence period. In the affected regions, underage female marriages declined and female educational attainment increased in the long term.\n\nWednesday 6 November 2024 12:30-14:00\n\nR1-09\n\nMITTER Sreemati (TSE) : *\n\nWednesday 20 November 2024 12:30-14:00\n\nR1-09\n\nSUSSMAN Nathan (Graduate Institute Geneva) : Migrating to opportunity - evidence from medieval Paris\n\nWednesday 27 November 2024 12:30-14:00\n\nR1-09\n\nBETRAN Concepcion (U. Valencia) : \"The 1930s crisis and the Second Spanish Republic: Challenge and response\"\n\nAbstract\n\nUnfettered by the gold standard, Spain’s economic performance in the 1930s should in principle have looked a lot more like those of the United States and the United Kingdom than those of France and Belgium. But the Second Republic’s (1931-1936) response to the economic crisis was divisive and ultimately incomplete. We attribute this outcome to political economy forces. Out study is based on detailed information on government expenditures, tariffs, and Most Favored Nations’ agreements. We match these various policy instruments with election results at the provincial level. Attuned to its support among industrial workers and landless peasants, the leftist first government (1931-1933) was interventionist and favored tariffs on manufacturing; aligned with large landowners and small farmers, the rightist second government (1933-1936) leaned toward austerity and advocated agricultural tariffs. Both governments adopted MFNs to mitigate the effect of tariffs. We conclude that the divergence in policy deepened the prevailing political and social divide between left and right.\n\nWednesday 4 December 2024 12:30-14:00\n\nR1-09\n\nROBERTSON Charlotte (Harvard Business School) : *\n\nWednesday 18 December 2024 12:30-14:00\n\nR1-09\n\nNOGUES-MARCO Pilar (Université de Genève) : Trade Imbalances or Silver Arbitrage? Anglo-Asian Bullion Flows in the Early Modern Period, 1664-1813\n\nAbstract\n\nSilver was the most significant commodity money that connected global exchanges in the early modern period. It was transferred from America toward Asia, with Europe being the major transhipment region. Western scholars of intercontinental trade companies have traditionally interpreted silver flows as the capital balancing item used to settle persistent European trade deficits with Asia caused by the European demand for Asian commodities. Conversely, the California School argues that silver was exchanged for profit as it was cheap in the Western producing regions and expensive in the East because of large China's demand for silver. This view reverses causality because the export of Asian commodities (and gold) to Europe is interpreted as the balancing items used to pay for silver imports to Asia. Data on silver prices are needed to discriminate between the two competing narratives. This research measures the profitability of Euro-Asian arbitrage for silver (and gold) based on original hand-collected data from the East India Company archive in order to define the role of silver in shaping global connections in early modern long-distance trade.\n\nArchives\n\nWednesday 3 July 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nROUANET Louis (University of Texas at El Paso in the Department of Economics and Finance.) : Long live the Republic: The political consequences of revolutionary land redistribution\n\nAbstract\n\nTo be politically viable, a Revolution needs the support of key interest groups that benefit from the survival of the new regime. The redistribution of clergy property during the French Revolution created a group –the new owners of clergy assets- whose wealth depended on the Revolution’s fate, thus increasing political support for the Revolution. This land redistribution policy had long-run consequences on political support for republicanism. Using data on elections during the beginning of the Third Republic, we show that the sale of clergy assets during the French Revolution substantially reduced support for anti-Republican candidates. Our results suggest that Republicans may not have prevailed in the 1870s without the liquidation of the Church's wealth 80 years earlier. The sale of Church assets reduced Catholic worship and increased Protestant worship. We use the presence of monasteries prior to the Reformation and the Commercial Revolution as instruments to suggest our findings are causal. Finally, we rule out a reduction in landed inequality as the main channel explaining the effect of this revolutionary land redistribution on politics and ideology.\n\nWednesday 26 June 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1-15\n\nCAGÉ Julia : Le début de la fin de la tripartition?

We test this claim in colonial Ireland, where a series of laws, known collectively as the Penal Laws, suppressed the Catholic Church and everyday religious practice for more than 150 years. Building on insights from demography on the importance of age heaping, we introduce a novel measure, “spousal heaping,” that records the coincidence of a husband and wife reporting a heaped age, and using the full 1901 population census show that Catholic spouses were far more likely to report heaped ages than non-Catholics. We argue that disparities in spousal heaping were driven by the active repression of Catholic priests who played a key role in administering two sacraments: baptism and confirmation, which dramatically reduced the prevalence of recorded ages for Catholics, but not Protestants, until the introduction of the Civil Registry in 1864.\n\nWednesday 12 June 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nMOSHRIF Rowaida (PSE) : Long-run Land inequality and Land Reform in Egypt (1896-2020)\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study focuses on the long-term evolution of land inequality in Egypt and assesses the redistributive role of the 1952 agrarian land reform. Using newly digitized data on landownership distribution since 1896, I provide the first long-term estimates of land inequality covering the late 19th century up to 2020. The findings indicate that land distribution was highly unequal in the first half of the 20th century, with the top 1% of landowners holding over 45% of total private agricultural land in Egypt. Of this, 25% of the land was owned by foreigners, while the rest belonged to Egyptian large landowners who were granted land by the Muhammed Ali dynasty in the 19th century. The 1952 agrarian land reform reduced land inequality by redistributing land from large landowners to small landowners. Specifically, the landownership share of the top 1% decreased from 43% to 28%, while the landownership of the bottom 90% rose from 27% to 42%. This redistribution was more substantial following the abolition of religious endowments, known as ”Waqf,” which were initially used by large landowners to preserve large properties from fragmentation through inheritance\n\nWednesday 5 June 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR2.01\n\nSALEH Mohamed (LSE) : The Glorious Revolution that Wasn't: Rural Elite Conflict and Demand for Democratization\n\nAllison Spencer Hartnett\n\nAbstract\n\nSocial conflict theory holds that democratization is most likely when an incumbent rural elite is challenged by a rising urban bourgeoisie. While this framework accounts for historical patterns of democratization in industrializing autocracies in the Global North, it is less well suited to explaining the emergence of democratic demands in agrarian autocracies in the Global South. In this paper, we examine demands for democratization in the Egyptian parliament before the British occupation in 1882. Using a new dataset of MPs and the universe of parliamentary minutes from 1868 to 1882, we use text analysis, differences-in-differences models, and machine learning to test whether rural intra-elite economic conflicts in MP home districts can lead to meaningful calls for democratization in parliament by rural middle class MPs. Our findings suggest that rural intra-elite competition over labor and land catalyzed demands for oversight (constraints) on the executive and issuance of a new constitution from rural middle-class MPs. Although these demands were suppressed by the British occupation in 1882, this study sheds light on how meaningful demands for democratization emerged in an authoritarian parliament in a non-industrialized agricultural economy that is comparable to other cases in the Global South during the first wave of democratization.\n\nWednesday 22 May 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nJUHASZ Reka (UBC) : Codification and Technology Absorption: Evidence from Trade Patterns\n\nRéka Juhász, Shogo Sakabe, David E. Weinstein,\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper studies technology absorption around the world in the late nineteenth century. We construct several novel datasets to test the idea that the codification of useful knowledge in the vernacular was necessary for countries to absorb the technologies of the Industrial Revolution. Using the rapid and unprecedented codification of useful knowledge in Meiji Japan as a natural experiment, we show that productivity growth in Japan was higher in industries that had a higher supply of Western useful knowledge, but only after the Japanese government undertook a large public good investment to provide this knowledge to its citizens. We find no similar patterns in other parts of the world which did not codify knowledge. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the frictions associated with technology diffusion, and offer a novel take on why Meiji Japan was unique among non-Western countries in successfully industrializing during the first wave of globalization. *\n\nWednesday 15 May 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nLAMOUROUX Christian (EHESS) : Histoire économique et données en miettes — comment écrire l'histoire économique de la Chine des Song (960-1279) ?\n\nAbstract\n\nComment écrire une histoire économique sans archives ? Comment évaluer des volumes de production ou de consommation à partir de chiffres parfois nombreux mais disparates, recensés dans des régions différentes et dans des conditions souvent imprécises, voire douteuses ? Comment comparer des prix quand les monnaies diffèrent d’une région à l’autre, en incluant des monnaies « privées », circulant sur les marchés et plus ou moins tolérées par les autorités locales ? Bref, qu’est-ce qu’une histoire économique sans quantification fiable ? C’est à ce défi qu’est confronté l’historien de la Chine impériale au tournant du premier et du second millénaires, alors que les textes et l’archéologie attestent que l’empire des Song connaissait un essor sans précédent de l’économie marchande, soutenue par un développement des instruments financiers dont le premier papier-monnaie émis à partir de 1024. Le présent exposé cherchera à montrer que l’interprétation des données disponibles, y compris chiffrées, permet cependant de mettre en évidence la cohérence des mécanismes qui permit aux différents échelons de l’État dynastique de diversifier leurs finances tout en faisant de la Chine un des grands carrefours des échanges asiatiques.\n\nWednesday 24 April 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nYAZDANI Kaveh (U. Connecticut) : The Biography of Capitalism(s) – 10th to 18th Centuries\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this presentation, I will first discuss the different approaches vis-à-vis the periodization of capitalism. Then, the transition period towards merchant capitalism in Song China and West Asia from the 10th century onwards will be examined. Next, I will briefly touch upon the emergence of merchant capitalism proper, especially in northern Italian coastal cities. Finally, some Asio-African and European commercial capitalist and entrepreneurial-mercantilist capitalist activities and developments between the 16th and 18th centuries will be scrutinized.\n\nWednesday 3 April 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nTANG John (Utrecht) : Superstition, fertility, and modernization: evidence from Japan\n\nAbstract\n\nThis project explores the relationship between modernization and cultural change by examining fertility patterns in twentieth century Japan. Japanese spirituality, which historically combined elements of animism, Shintoism, and Buddhism, informed fertility patterns by identifying auspicious and inauspicious years to give birth. During the Meiji Period (1868-1912), the central government implemented reforms to dramatically expand mass education alongside industrial and urban development. In the post-war period, advances in medical technology and family planning may have also contributed to the population's ability to avoid births in unlucky years. By using the spatial and temporal variation in education, urbanization, employment, and medical services, one can identify whether increased modernity coincided with less adherence to superstition in the timing of births.\n\nWednesday 27 March 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nGAUTHIER Stéphane (PSE) : Late height growth and adult maturity from historical quasi-exhaustive panel data\n\nAbstract\n\nCombining height data from two 19th-century French conscription sources yields a quasi-exhaustive individual-level longitudinal dataset for men from their 21st year, allowing for an assessment of late height growth and age of maturity. Among 2,923 men born in 1887 in Corr`eze, annual growth ranges from 0.29 cm to 0.39 cm. Most men mature around ages 21-22, but the shortest in the first quintile grow 1.6 cm, reaching 162.7 cm at ages 26-27.\n\nWednesday 20 March 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nHONG Sehyun : Income Inequality in South Korea, 1933-2022: Evidence from Distributional National Accounts\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study presents “Distributional National Accounts (DINA)\" for South Korea. We combine household survey micro data, tax data, and national accounts to construct annual pretax income inequality series which is coherent with macro aggregates. We show the distribution of pretax national income over the period from 1933 to 2020, with detailed breakdown by age, gender, and income composition in the years from 1996 to 2020. This series allows for a much richer analysis of the long-run income inequality trend in South Korea than previous work based on fiscal tabulation (N.-N. Kim, 2018), which only includes top income shares and misses an increasing component of tax-exempted capital income in recent years. Our new series suggests that after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, income inequality has worsened due to the rise of tax-exempted capital income concentration at the top. Additionally, South Korea is characterized with relatively higher gender inequality and lower old-age income shares compared to the United States and France. Compared to other East Asian countries, South Korea exhibits relatively lower levels of income inequality, mostly due to the fact that its national income growth was more equally distributed in the early stages of economic take-off in the 1980s, even though income inequality has worsened over the last three decades. Rather strikingly, despite similar economic backgrounds and development trajectories, there is a huge gap in pretax national income inequality between Taiwan and South Korea. This gap stems mostly from the fact that the distribution of capital income in Taiwan has been much more unequal than that in Korea.\n\nWednesday 13 March 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nKERSTING Felix (Humboldt University Berlin) : Industrialization, returns, inequality (Co-authors: Thilo Albers and Timo Stieglitz)\n\nThilo Albers and Timo Stieglitz\n\nAbstract\n\nHow does revolutionary technological change impact wealth inequality? We turn to the mother of all technological shocks–the Industrial Revolution–and analyze its role for wealth concentration both empirically and theoretically. Based on a novel dataset on wealth shares at the level of Prussian counties, we provide causal evidence on the positive effect of industrialization on the top percentile's wealth share and the inequality among top fortunes. We show that this relationship between industrialization, wealth concentration, and tail fattening is consistent with both cross-country data on national wealth distributions and with a new individual-level dataset of Prussian millionaires. We disentangle the mechanisms underlyi ng the observed wealth concentration and tail fattening by introducing a dynamic two-sector structure into an overlapping generations model with heterogeneous returns to capital. In particular, we study the role of sector-specific scale dependence, i.e., the positive correlation of rates of return and wealth in industry, and dynastic type dependence in returns, i.e., the gradual one-directional transition of wealth-holders from the low-return traditional to the high-return industrial sector. The simulations suggest that the combination of these two features explains about half of the total increase of the top-1% share, while the other half resulted from the general increase and higher dispersion of returns induced by the emerging industrial sector.\n\nWednesday 6 March 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nPAREDES CASTRO Héctor (PSE) : Land Without Masters: local political competition since the Peruvian Land Reform (1969-1980)\n\nAbstract\n\nCan the historical exposure to redistribution spur local political competition and electoral participation in later elections? This study analyzes the massive land expropriation process executed under military rule in Peru from 1969 to 1980 and its effects over local politics with the return to democracy. The implementation of the reform was based on the creation of Agrarian Reform Zones (ARZ) and the use of regional offices for local execution located in high-priority reform areas within each ARZ. These zones were conceived and delimited for entirely different purposes a decade prior to the reform. Using the distance from a district to an ARZ office as an instrument, I show changes towards a more politically competitive local environment in land reform affected districts. In line with strategic responses to political competition, post-reform elections boost the participation of candidates with specific attributes: more educated, older and with indigenous background. Furthermore, candidates report more partisan experience but are also less associated with traditional politics. Evidence on driving mechanisms such as a dampened capacity of local elites for political capture, the growth of peasant-based social organization, and changes in voters’ preferences towards redistribution go in line with this interpretation.\n\nWednesday 28 February 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nIANDOLO Alessandro (UCL) : Arrested Development: The Soviet Union in Ghana, Guinea, and Mali, 1955-1968.\n\nAbstract\n\nArrested Development examines the USSR's involvement in West Africa during the 1950s and 1960s as aid donor, trade partner, and political inspiration for the first post-independence governments in Ghana, Guinea, and Mali. Buoyed by solid economic performance in the 1950s, the USSR opened itself up to the world and launched a series of programs aimed at supporting the search for economic development in newly independent countries in Africa and Asia. These countries, emerging from decades of colonial domination, looked at the USSR as an example to strengthen political and economic independence. Based on extensive research in Russian and West African archives, Alessandro Iandolo explores the ideas that guided Soviet engagement in West Africa, investigates the projects that the USSR sponsored \"on the ground,\" and analyzes their implementation and legacy. The Soviet specialists who worked in Ghana, Guinea, and Mali collaborated with West African colleagues in drawing ambitious development plans, supervised the construction of new transport infrastructure, organized collective farms and fishing cooperatives, conducted geological surveys and mineral prospecting, set up banking systems, managed international trade, and staffed repairs workshops and ministerial bureaucracies alike. The exchanges and clashes born out of the encounter between Soviet and West African ideas, ambitions, and hopes about development reveal the USSR as a central actor in the history of economic development in the twentieth century.\n\nWednesday 7 February 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nPIKETTY Thomas (EHESS-PSE) : Une histoire du conflit politique.

Il se propose de rouvrir l’espace des possibles pour inventer et produire des médicaments sans monopole, en limitant et en maitrisant les profits, en instaurant une profitabilité sociale et en s’émancipant des exclusivités de marché. D’une certaine manière, l’histoire du médicament est une histoire des alternatives à la propriété exclusive et aux monopoles. Ces utopies pharmaceutiques, en termes de partage des technologies pour inventer des biens publics ou communs, sont aussi anciennes que l’invention des droits de propriété intellectuelle à la fin du 18ème siècle. C’est précisément l’objet de ce livre d’en faire l’histoire et d’en inventorier les types. Ces alternatives sont expérimentées dans un contexte où les droits intellectuels sont incomplets dans la période 1790-1950, puis dans un contexte de globalisation croissante des brevets, particulièrement depuis les années 1990.\n\nWednesday 24 January 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nALFANI Guido (Bocconi University ) : *\n\nWednesday 24 January 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nALFANI Guido (Bocconi University ) : The rich and the top wealth shares: a long-term perspective\n\nAbstract\n\nOver the last ten years or so, many efforts have been made at reconstructing measures of economic inequality (including top shares of wealth and/or income) for a growing range of preindustrial societies, especially but not exclusively in Europe. The seminar will offer an updated overview of this research, focusing on the rich – but it will go beyond a presentation of top wealth shares per se, seeking an answer to a broader range of questions. Who were the rich, in history, and how did they obtain their wealth? Did they play the same role in society, and were they perceived in the same manner, in the past as today? And are changes in the perception of the rich across history somewhat connected to the extent of their wealth, in absolute and/or in relative terms? The seminar will build upon a recently published book, As Gods Among Men. A History of the Rich in the West (Princeton 2023), which highlights —despite the different paths to wealth in different eras— fundamental continuities in the behavior of the rich and public attitudes towards wealth across Western history. It also offers a novel perspective on current debates about wealth and income disparity.\n\nWednesday 17 January 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nSGARD Jérôme (Sciences Po) : Imperial Politics, Open Markets and Private Ordering: The Global Grain Trade (1875-1914).\n\nWednesday 17 January 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nSGARD Jérôme (Sciences Po) : Imperial Politics, Open Markets and Private Ordering: The Global Grain Trade (1875-1914)\n\nAbstract\n\nFrom the 1870s onwards, global commodity markets were all governed by self-standing private bodies, typically controlled by elite merchants. The London Corn Trade Association thus standardized supply from across the world, turning grain into a fungible commodity; it arbitrated disputes; and it offered to traders a range of standard contracts that integrated the value chains, from the various export harbors till destination. Enforcement rested on market power and the threat of blacklisting: the Association had remarkably little relations with officials of any sort, in Britain or abroad: public administrators, judges, diplomats or army officers. This gave to thus private market a strong extra-territorial character: few merchant houses in the world could afford being expelled from the London market. Ultimately, however, this private trading platform worked under English law exclusively and it was upheld by both the London courts and the Bank of England. It was both global and local, and hence a full part of Britain’s imperial project. It policed a global network of private commercial routes while mediating the demands for market integration and the sheer diversity of the global political geography. Rule-based market power should thus be seen as a specific factor in Britain’s economic supremacy, together with relative geopolitical might, productivity levels or capital exports for instance.\n\nWednesday 10 January 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nMONTALBO Adrien (SUSSEX) : *\n\nWednesday 10 January 2024 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nMONTALBO Adrien (SUSSEX) : The Economic Origins of Vaccine Hesitancy: Evidence from Smallpox in Nineteenth-Century France\n\nAbstract\n\nIn spite of a vast medical literature investigating the impact of socio-economic factors on vaccine uptake and of a growing literature in economic history focusing mostly on the consequences of epidemics, little is known about vaccine hesitancy the drivers of vaccination in the long run. This paper aims at filling this gap in the literature by focusing on vaccination against smallpox in nineteenth-century France. Smallpox was one the deadliest disease up until the introduction of vaccination in the nineteenth century, as it is estimated to have killed between 50,000 and 80,000 persons per year in France during the eighteenth century. To study the determinants of vaccination, we collected precise data on the number of children vaccinated each year within French departments between 1806 and 1888. By using wheat prices instrumented by rainfall and the phylloxera crisis as an exogenous source of income variation, we find that negative income shocks were linked to an increase in vaccination in France during the nineteenth century. These outcomes indicate that families reacted to negative shocks by vaccinating their children more often. This counter-intuitive result can be explained by the fact that parents chose to vaccinate their children when their existence was threatened by negative income shocks. Our results also indicate that the positive effect of negative income shocks on vaccination was stronger in department where child labour was more common. In areas where families depended more strongly on the income of children, the death of a child represented a stronger shock on the total income of the household. Families were therefore more willing to protect their children when their life was put at risk by negative income shocks within these departments.\n\nWednesday 20 December 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nWOKER Madeline (IEA Zurich) : The tax haven that wasn’t: imperial statecraft, capital, and the politics of corporate taxation in the French colonial empire, 1920s-1950s.\n\nAbstract\n\nWhat is a tax haven? What does it take to make or break one? And what role have states played in this process? Historians have so far focused on the Anglo-American world or blatant cases like Switzerland. Instead, this story will take us to the French colonial empire where, by the end of the 1920s, a growing number of colonial firms were transferring their headquarters from the metropole to the colonies with the aim of evading taxation on investment capital income. These transfers threatened to transform French colonies into tax havens. Why was this averted and why didn’t the French empire generate tax havens when the British empire did? This article explores the links between empire, decolonisation, and the expansion of tax havens via an unusual route: that of the politics of tax planning in the French colonial empire and shows that French colonial tax havens could have materialised on a large scale at two critical junctures: first in the interwar period and then in the aftermath of the Second World War. It argues that they eventually did not come into being because successive administrations within the French Ministry of Finance did not let it happen. Broader structural determinants – the relative weakness of the French metropolitan fiscal state in the interwar period and the unwillingness to let international capital dictate French development strategies in the late colonial period - crucially influenced the positions taken by the Ministry of Finance. Post-war dreams of restored grandeur made French authorities much more reluctant to outsource development and let go of state prerogatives. By exploring an unrealised possibility, this article makes a broader intervention in the nascent historiography of tax havens and highlights the role of state power in their (un)making.\n\nWednesday 13 December 2023 09:30-17:00\n\nR2.01\n\nF.SIMIAND ATELIER (PSE et EHESS) : Les empires français dans leurs dimensions économiques (18e-20e siècle)”\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 6 December 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\n*\n\nWednesday 6 December 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nVALENCIA CAICEDO Felipe (Vancouver SE) : Bourbons reforms and State capacity in the Spanish empire\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study state modernization and its fiscal and political consequences in the Spanish empire in the Americas in the 18th century. We focus on the intendancy system, which introduced a new corps of provincial governors to address misgovernance by local colonial officers. Our empirical strategy leverages the staggered implementation of this reform across the empire, extending from present-day USA to Argentina. Using administrative data from the royal treasuries, we show that the intendancy system led to a sizable increase in Crown revenue, driven by a strengthening of state presence far from the traditional centers of power and the disruption of local elite capture. The reform also caused a reduction in the incidence of rebellions by indigenous peoples, who were harshly exploited under the status quo. However, the intendancy system also heightened tensions with the local creole elites, as reflected by naming patterns, and plausibly contributed to the nascent independence movement.\n\nWednesday 29 November 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nVIPOND Hilary (LSE) : Technological Unemployment in Victorian Britain\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is no quantitative record of jobs lost to, and generated by, creative destruction as industries mechanized in Great Britain over the 19th century. Such a record would enable a long run view of the impact of occupational decline, adding a dimension to debates on the future of work. I create a new, sub-industry, level of occupation for England between 1851-1911, using text recorded in individual level English census observations, as digitized by the Integrated Census Microdata project (ICeM). I focus on the impact of mechanization on the bootmaking industry, and assign 1.3 million English bootmakers to the sub-industry ”tasks” they performed. I show that technological unemployment obscured at an industry level analysis is revealed at the task level. In bootmaking, the occupational structure was transformed as the industry mechanized. Approximately 152 000 jobs disappeared as skills became obsolete, and another 144 000 jobs, demanding new skills, were generated. The new jobs went almost entirely to young bootmakers, and incumbents were not able to transition into the new employment opportunities.\n\nWednesday 22 November 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nDUCOING Cristian (LUND) : Assessing long run Sustainable Development: Evidence from Global Genuine Savings 1850 - 2020 (With Eoin McLaughlin and Les Oxley)\n\nAbstract\n\nLong-run economic development has focused on income, but it has overlooked the role of wealth in future well-being. We addressed this shortcoming using a novel database that links historical trends estimated by McLaughin et al. (2022) with more recent developments. In a provocative paper, Sullivan & Hickel (2023) take a critical position on economic growth and development in the last 400 years, basing their findings on a correlation between capitalism and poverty. We challenge these assumptions from a perspective based on the role of savings and investment in economic progress. Declining trends in savings, especially when we include the depreciation of our natural assets in our accounting, are a major concern for the future.\n\nWednesday 15 November 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nNOBLE Aurelius (LSE) : The Persistence of Aristocratic Wealth: Institutional Measures, Family Measures and Social Mobility, 1858-1907\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article examines persistence in the wealth of title-holders in England and Wales between 1858 and 1907. While the historical narrative is that this elite was unable to weather the shocks of globalisation, industrialisation, and democratisation, I find that this group was highly persistent. This paper makes a number of methodological contributions, by linking the population of individual wealth-holders with genealogical data on the population of title-holders. This allows me to distinguish between two measures of title-holder wealth, which I term the family measure and the institutional measure, and to measure title-holder specific social mobility. The family measure tracks the wealth of the families that constituted this elite at the beginning of the period, whereas the institutional measure also includes new entrants. This method shows that persistence was stronger when considering new entrants (institutional measure) than just the initial families (family measure). The apparent decline of British title-holders (Cannadine, 1990) was predominantly about changes to the composition, rather than a decline in wealth. Title-holding families were subject to a different, lower, social mobility regime, where they declined towards a higher level than the population mean. The results indicate a social, rather than economic, mechanism for persistence. The paper illuminates the long-run trajectory of a social elites, and their relation to social, economic and institutional forces. Estimating these different measures is made possible by the construction of a new individual level dataset, containing the population of English and Welsh wealth-holders (2.2m), combined with genealogical information on the population of title-holders (1.4k deaths, 4.5k living), and individual data on the population of deaths (26.1m).\n\nWednesday 8 November 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nSCHIFANO Sonia (Bocconi) : The distribution of land in Luxembourg (1766–1872): Family-level wealth persistence in the midst of institutional change\n\nSonia Schifano (Bocconi University) and Antoine Paccoud (LISER, LSE)\n\nAbstract\n\nThe paper analyses family-level wealth inequality and social mobility in Dudelange (Luxembourg) between 1766 and 1872. This period saw the end of feudal social relations with the integration of Luxembourg into the French revolutionary regime. The study utilizes archival data and five generations of descendants to connect the declarants of the Maria-Theresa land survey of 1766 with their descendants in the land registries of 1842 and 1872. Links between individuals are made from vertical parent-children-grandchildren relationships, however these relationships are not constant. To account for this variability, the number of ancestors available for each declarant and the generational descendant-ancestor distance that separates each declarant from his or her ancestors were considered in the social mobility analysis. The inequality analysis reveals a decline in the Gini coefficient for land ownership between 1766 and 1842, indicative of the dissolution of the feudal system. This reduction becomes less pronounced upon excluding property-less declarants from the 1766 dataset (note that in 1842 and 1872, these individuals are already excluded due to the nature of the data source). The disparity in the Gini coefficient between 1766 and 1842 lastly disappear when non-residents in Dudelange are removed from the analysis. Owing to data constraints, the social mobility analysis is also based on declarants that are residents of Dudelange and shows a high persistence of land among closer generations throughout the period. This persistence discloses that family-level transmission mechanisms limit social mobility and strongly advantage those with ancestors owning property wealth, even when there are significant changes in the organization of property relations.\n\nWednesday 25 October 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nBARBOT Michela (IDHE.S-ENS Paris Saclay) : L’estimation des biens, un dispositif d’enforcement contractuel ? Les cas français et italien en perspective comparée (XVIIe -début XIXe siècle)\n\nAbstract\n\nLa présente recherche porte sur le rôle de l’estimation en tant que moyen de réduction des incertitudes qui menacent la stabilité et l’exécution des contrats comportant la fixation d’un prix. Cette problématique est analysée à partir d’une comparaison entre la France et l’Italie (XVIIe-début du XIXe siècle), réalisée en mobilisant des règlements, des ouvrages juridiques, des manuels d’estimation, ainsi qu’une série d’expertises immobilières rédigées à Milan et à Paris. Cette comparaison révèle l’existence de deux différentes modalités institutionnelles de faire face aux incertitudes qui pèsent sur les prix et les contrats. Alors qu’en Italie la voie choisie consiste à faire de l’estimation une véritable procédure juridique et à encourager ouvertement le recours à un estimateur, en France le problème de la garantie des accords contractuels est davantage résolu par l’adoption d’une série de normes qui interviennent, en amont, sur le contrôle et la certification de la qualité des biens échangés. Cette divergence est confirmée également par l’analyse des expertises à Milan et à Paris, qui montre que les fonctions attribuées à l’estimation dépendent aussi de manière déterminante de la structure de la propriété, des modes de sa transmission et des formes de son imposition fiscale.\n\nWednesday 18 October 2023 12:00-13:00\n\nR1.09\n\nGOBBI Paula (Université Libre de Bruxelles) : Revolutionary Transition: Inheritance Change and Fertility Decline\n\nJoint with Victor Gay and Marc Goñi\n\nAbstract\n\nWe test Le Play’s (1884) hypothesis that the French Revolution contributedto France’s early fertility decline. In 1793, a series of inheritance reformsabolished local inheritance practices, imposing equal partition of assetsamong all children. We develop a theoretical framework that predictsa decline in fertility following these reforms because of indivisibility con-straints in parents’ assets. We test this hypothesis by combining a newlycreated map of pre-Revolution local inheritance practices together withdemographic data from the Henry database and from crowdsourced ge-neaologies in Geni.com. We provide difference-in-differences and regression-discontinuity estimates based on comparing cohorts of fertile age and co-horts too old to be fertile in 1793 between municipalities where the reformsaltered and did not alter existing inheritance practices. We find that the1793 inheritance reforms reduced completed fertility by half to one child,closed the pre-reform fertility gap between different inheritance regions, andsharply accelerated France’s early fertility transition\n\nWednesday 11 October 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nCASTILLO GARCÍA César (The New School for Social Research & PSE) : How Was Neoliberal Hegemony Constructed? Policy Networks and Free-Market Institutions in Peru (1930-1990)\n\nCésar Castillo-García (The New School for Social Research & PSE) with Luan Sánchez-Pérez (Universidad del Pacífico)\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper analyzes the existent bonds between Peruvian experts and the transnational neoliberal network of the Walter Lippmann Colloquium/Mont Pèlerin Society during 1930-1990. We rely upon qualitative sources (member directories, institutional affiliations, board memberships) to construct a non-exhaustive database of 388 actors belonging to 295 relevant institutions for the period under study. Then, we apply social network analysis techniques to explore and visualize the nexus between personalities and organizations that pushed the free-market agenda and reacted to profit cycles in Peru during different historical periods that we call waves of neoliberalization. Our results demonstrate an increase in the participation of domestic actors in the Peruvian neoliberal network. Hence, six Peruvian intellectuals played the role of brokers transmitting the neoliberal discourse among different institutional settings: Pedro Beltrán, Rómulo Ferrero, Jacobo Rey Elmore, Roberto Abusada, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Likewise, this paper shows the organizational structure transmitting free-market ideas in Peru was heterogeneous and included government agencies, business associations, high-ed institutions, the press, and the Catholic Church. These findings demonstrate that organized actions of intellectuals, technocrats, and politicians have made neoliberal legacies prevail in the Peruvian public sphere during the second half of 20th century.\n\nWednesday 4 October 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nCASTILLO-GARCIA César (The New School for Social Research & PSE) : Well-being and inequality in Spain during the seventeenth century: the bull of Crusade\n\nWednesday 4 October 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nALVAREZ-NOGAL Carlos (Carlos III) : Well-being and inequality in Spain during the seventeenth century: the bull of Crusade.\n\nAbstract\n\nSpain experienced economic decline from the 1570s to 1650, recovering gradually thereafter and only reaching its early 1570s per capita income in the 1820s. How did economic decline impact on people’s perception of well-being and inequality? An unexplored source, the bulls of the Crusade can offer some answers to that question. The bull was an alms that, after 1574, was annually collected by the Spanish Monarchy in its territories giving some material and spiritual benefits to the population. An inexpensive but fixed price alms was massively bought by those aged 12 and above. The number of bulls sold relative to the relevant population provides a measure of spiritual comfort and, hence, of subjective well-being. A subjective inequality measure, the ratio of the eight reales bulls sold, intended for wealthy and high social status people, to the two reales bulls sold, intended for the common people, is also estimated. After collecting data from 1574 to 1700, the results suggest that subjective well-being deteriorated during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century improving during its last third, while subjective inequality increased from 1600-1640 to fall in the third quarter of the century.\n\nWednesday 27 September 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nWARLOUZET Laurent (Sorbonne) : Europe contre Europe.

Between 1871 and 1879, the German Chancellery engaged an international network of banks and refiners to acquire gold-backed assets in return for selling its silver in Europe and in South and East Asia. This paper reconstructs the Chancellery’s network of financial agents and presents the most comprehensive picture yet of the transcontinental bullion flows that underpinned Germany’s monetary reforms. Based on a wealth of banking and government records, the paper yields a more nuanced understanding of the geographic outlets and strategy of Germany’s bullion trade and its impact on the global silver glut that set in from 1872. The ensuing macroeconomic disruption that accompanied Germany’s demonetization gave rise to both prolonged uncertainty in bullion markets and growing diplomatic tensions across Europe.\n\nWednesday 13 September 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1-09\n\nJABKO Nicolas : the waxing of technocratic neoliberalism\n\nAbstract\n\nThe United States in the 1980s saw the emergence of technocratic neoliberalism. Assertive central bankers adopted monetarist policies that were increasingly popular in the economics profession, while a new breed of politicians embraced neoliberal ideology. Based on an analysis of FOMC transcripts as well as secondary sources, this paper argues that the leadership of the US Federal Reserve was crucial in shaping not only a new monetary regime, but also the broader assemblage of technocratic neoliberalism. The Fed supported an agenda of disinflation, fiscal conservatism, and free markets that would outlive the Fed’s commitment to it.\n\nWednesday 6 September 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nBACH Maria (Lausanne) : Emancipatory National Accounting\n\nAbstract\n\nSeparated by thousands of kilometres of land and sea, two economists produced national income estimates in the late 1860s. An Indian economist, Dadabhai Naoroji, calculated India’s first ever national income estimate for years 1867-8 and 1870-71. A North American economist, Ezra Seaman, worked out one of the first estimates for national income and domestic product for 1866 and 1869. Although on different continents, with different circumstances, both Naoroji and Seaman argued that if they could measure the size of their economies, they could understand their progress. This statement seems evident today when economic measurements like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are printed in widespread media and publications daily. The practise of measuring our economy, however, had only just began in the 1800s. Others argue that it started much later in the 1930s-40s when the international standards for national accounting were established. While there is growing literature exploring the links between accounting and imperial processes, there is much less on how economists from what we call the Global South today have counted their own economies. Shifting the focus to economists from the Global South, rather than colonisers, offers room for new perspectives on what national accounting did for the Global South. Studies that examine the imperial practises of counting their foreign territories have uncovered how national accounting was yet another tool to govern, control and suppress the populations of the Global South. My study shows the contrary: natives of the Global South used national accounting as an emancipatory tool. Studying instances of national accounting in the Global South can give us further insight into how and why measuring happens, and how it reflects and shapes our reality. Examining the North American case alongside the Indian case could reveal new insights. India was only starting its nationalist movement in the early 1870s. North America had been independent for almost hundred years. The comparison could then identify differences of doing national accounting in a free versus a colonised country.\n\nWednesday 5 July 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nGIORCELLI Michela (UCLA) : “The Effects of Managerial Education on Manager’s Career Outcomes”\n\nWednesday 21 June 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1-09\n\nMITCHENER Kris ((Leavey School of Business)) : How do Financial Crises Redistribute Risk?\n\nKris J. Mitchener, Angela Vossmeyer\n\nAbstract\n\nWe examine how financial crises redistribute risk, employing novel empirical methods and micro data from the largest financial crisis of the 20th century – the Great Depression. Using balance-sheet and systemic risk measures at the bank level, we build an econometric model with incidental truncation that jointly considers bank survival, the type of bank closure (consolidations, absorption, and failures), and changes to bank risk. Despite roughly 9,000 bank closures, risk did not leave the financial system; instead, it increased. We show that risk was redistributed to banks that were healthier prior to the financial crisis. A key mechanism driving the redistribution of risk was bank acquisition. Each acquisition increases the balance-sheet and systemic risk of the acquiring bank by 25%. Our findings suggest that financial crises do not quickly purge risk from the system, and that merger policies commonly used to deal with troubled financial institutions during crises have important implications for systemic risk\n\nWednesday 14 June 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09\n\nGONZÁLEZ PALOMARES David (Université de Oviedo) : *\n\nWednesday 14 June 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.15, Campus Jourdan\n\nRODRIGUES Lisbeth (Université de Lisbonne) : A Holy Alliance: Distributional Effects of Debt Service in Portugal, 1560-18001\n\nLeonor Freire Costa, Paulo B. Brito\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper examines the distributional effects of public debt in Portugal from 1560 to 1800. The timeframe encompasses the transition of two distinct administrative structures from a fragmented to a centralized tax system. Whether fragmented or centralized, the tax administration established the parameters for the interaction between the monarch and bondholders in the execution of fiscal or debt contracts. The financial contract that supported this interaction placed the burden of annual interest collection on the bondholder, which was directly linked to the location of the fiscal district assigned for that payment. This paper raises the question of whether these two models yielded different distributional effects - potentially associated with the downward trend in interest rates - and whether they facilitated the coalition between the sovereign borrower and particular creditors\n\nWednesday 7 June 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nGINALSKI Stéphanie (Université de Lausanne) : «Kunstkapital » : la Société des beaux-arts de Zurich et ses réseaux financiers durant l’entre-deux-guerres.\n\nAbstract\n\nEn 2021, l’arrivée de la \"collection Bührle\" au Kunsthaus de Zurich fait l’objet de vives polémiques largement relayées dans les médias, aussi bien en Suisse qu’à l’étranger.

I offer a first causal test of this theory, drawing on millions of captain voyages between the Baltic and North Sea between 1500 and 1855. For identification, I rely on drastic year-to-year variation in sea ice, which exogenously re-routes captains to towns they or their peers had not visited previously. I find that once (quasi-randomly) exposed to a new port, captains and their townspeople are very likely to return to this town and that trade flows and even the export mix are lastingly altered. This finding highlights the importance of pioneers and policies, such as export promotion, that foster them.\n\nWednesday 17 May 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nSalleR1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nJURSA Michael (University of Vienna) : Growth, Prosperity and Inequality in a Pre-Modern Complex Agrarian Economy: the Case of Babylonia in the Age of Empires (6th Cent.

The latter insists on social inequalities within countries, which are then investigated in their historical and comparative perspective. For the first time, these two authors will be gathered in a round table; the aim is precisely to discuss the interplay between their perspectives, in both analytical and historical empirical terms. Did the great divergence modify social inequalities in the concerned, and other areas? And viceversa, how were social inequalities influenced by the great divergence? And, even more broadly, how do we investigate similar interplays over a longer span of time (in particular in the 20th century) and in other areas (for example Africa). Piketty’s latest book, A brief history of equality (2022) offers a first attempt to answer these (and other questions).

We use the industrial censuses from 19th-century France to examine the effect on wages and employment of one of the greatest waves of mechanisation in history: the diffusion of steam-power. We find that the rates of growth of employment and wages were considerably higher in steam-adopting industries than in non-steam-adopting ones, both in the shorter and longer run. This finding disputes the widespread belief that industrial modernisation entailed technical unemployment and falling labour-compensation. As old and new technologies often coexist even in the same production unit, our analysis also exploits the interface between the traditional (i.e. wind, water and animal) motive-powers and the new (steam-powered) ones. Our observed effect of steam-power on wages and employment varied extensively depending on how steam-technology conjoined the traditional motive-powers\n\nWednesday 12 April 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nDYKSTRA Maura (Caltech) : Enforcement, Agency, and Accounting Cycles: The Institutional Context of the Late Imperial Chinese Business\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper will review some of the accounting practices of Qing dynasty firms as they created particular conditions for long-distance trade.

We split the analysis into developed industrial counties (industrial clusters, high, medium, and low tech) and less industrialized counties (agricultural) and measure the impact of the investments using differences in differences analysis combined with propensity score matching. Our main result is that Federal investments were successful depending on the previous comparative advantage of the counties that obtained the public funds. Therefore, we find no significant effect on less industrialized counties but a significant one on the manufacturing and service sectors of industrial counties. We also show that returns of the war investments depended both on their nature and location (and their interaction) according to technology type. We observe a significantly larger effect of those investments where their relative technology intensity corresponds with the comparative advantage of their location. The higher returns corresponded to high-tech investments in counties already specialized in that type of manufacturing production. These results have some important implications for the design of regional and industrial policies\n\nWednesday 29 March 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nMAGGOR Noam (IEA Paris) : Freights and Rates: Railroad Regulation as American Industrial Policy\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper examines the controversy over railroad freight rate regulation in the late nineteenth century United States. Did state railroad commissions have the right to dictate shipping rates to the railroad industry - the biggest and most strategically important economic sector in this period - and, if yes, what would be the consequences? It shows that advocates of rate regulation, who mostly hailed from the American periphery, envisioned government control over prices as a form of developmental industrial policy. They sought to avoid American dependence on resource extraction and protect producers on the western frontier. They were remarkably successful, with important implications for the economic geography of the U.S., patterns of regional inequality, and nature of American institutions\n\nWednesday 22 March 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nBECK KNUDSEN Anne Sofie (University of Copenhagen) : Those Who Stayed: Selection and Cultural Change in the Age of Mass Migration\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper studies the cultural determinants and consequences of mass emigration from Scandinavia to North America in the 19th century. I test the hypothesis that people with collectivist traits tended to stay rather than emigrate because they faced higher costs of leaving familiar social networks behind. Exploiting near-complete data on 1.5 million emigrants and 10 million stayers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, I find that children who grew up in households that practiced stronger collectivist norms were less likely to emigrate later in life. I proceed to document that this type of selective emigration generated lasting change in migrant-sending locations. Locations that experienced larger outflows of particularly selected individuals are thus more collectivist today\n\nWednesday 15 March 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nAnnulé\n\nSCHNEIDER Sabine (Oxford University) : International Finance, Bilateral Cooperation and the World Silver Crisis, 1871-1879\n\nAbstract\n\nImperial Germany’s monetary union in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War (1870/71) necessitated the liquidation of vast quantities of German silver stocks on world markets. Between 1871 and 1879, the German Chancellery engaged an international network of banks and refiners to acquire gold-backed assets in return for selling its silver in Europe and in South and East Asia. This paper reconstructs the Chancellery’s network of financial agents and presents the most comprehensive picture yet of the transcontinental bullion flows that underpinned Germany’s monetary reforms. Based on a wealth of banking and government records, the paper yields a more nuanced understanding of the geographic outlets and strategy of Germany’s bullion trade and its impact on the global silver glut that set in from 1872. The ensuing macroeconomic disruption that accompanied Germany’s demonetization gave rise to both prolonged uncertainty in bullion markets and growing diplomatic tensions across Europe.\n\nWednesday 8 March 2023 13:30-16:30\n\nSalle R2.01,Campus Jourdan\n\nAtelier François Simiand: Autour du livre de Denis Cogneau Un empire bon marché: Histoire et économie politique de la colonisation française, XIXe-XXe siècle (Seuil, 2023)\n\nAbstract\n\nIntervenants : Frederick Cooper (historien New York University) Christelle Dumas (économiste, Université de Fribourg) Nadji Safir (sociologue, Université d'Alger) David Todd (historien, Sciences Po)\n\nWednesday 15 February 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nBEIGELMAN Marie (ETH Zurich) : Intergenerational Impact of Labor Coercion\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper studies the intergenerational impact of labour coercion in the French West Indies. I investigate how conditions in which slave ancestors were exploited affected descendants’ health, family structure, and criminal behaviour over more than five generations. To do so, I undertake a massive digitation effort of handwritten administrative records (census, civil records, convicts’ registries) on slaves and descendants, using surnames as a quasi-perfect identifier of an individual’s ancestor. Using information on slave mortality in the decades preceding abolition, I document sizable difference in labour coercion intensity depending on the crop produced: sugar or coffee. These differences are partly driven by a plausibly exogenous shock on sugarcane prices prior to the abolition of slavery. I build on this finding to construct a surname-level measure of labour coercion intensity with two levels of variation: at the county of enslavement level, depending on past sugarcane production intensity; at the ancestor level, whether she experienced slave trade. The second on-going part of this project investigates the intergenerational impact of labour coercion intensity on child mortality, family structure, and criminal behaviour at different points in time: in the aftermath of the abolition of slavery (1852-1856), thirty years afterwards, a century later.\n\nWednesday 8 February 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nARNOUX Mathieu (EHESS/CRH) : Un monde sans ressources. Albin Michel Editeur\n\nAbstract\n\nLe réchauffement climatique et la transition écologique ont placé la notion de « ressources » au centre de nos préoccupations. Or son histoire, plus ancienne qu’il n’y paraît, est une problématique majeure de la construction des sociétés. Dès le Moyen Âge, les Européens eurent le souci de nourrir les affamés, vêtir les indigents, loger les sans-abris, autant de besoins concrets auxquels tâchèrent de répondre l’Église et les pouvoirs politiques, en s’efforçant de construire un mode de vie durable. Explorant les liens tissés au cœur de la grande croissance médiévale entre besoin et développement, sobriété et consommation, Mathieu Arnoux souligne à la fois les réussites et les impasses d’un système économique construit presque exclusivement sur l’exploitation de ressources renouvelables, au risque de mettre en crise le régime féodal?; ce dont témoignent aussi bien une célèbre œuvre de fiction, le Roman de Renart, que les statuts de grandes communautés monastiques, comme l’ordre de Cîteaux. À l’heure où l’épuisement des ressources pose la question de la survie des modes contemporains de développement et d’existence, nous pouvons tirer profit des leçons, étonnamment modernes et ingénieuses, du Moyen Âge chrétien.\n\nWednesday 1 February 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nGIPOULOUX François (CNRS / EHESS) : Le capital introuvable - Dynamique et contraintes des réseaux marchands chinois, XVIe-XIXe siècle\n\nAbstract\n\nCette présentation réexamine la question de la divergence entre Europe et Chine en revenant sur le rôle joué les grands réseaux régionaux de marchands chinois. Du XVIe au XIXe siècle, trois groupes de marchands du Fujian, de Huizhou et du Shanxi, ont joué un rôle prépondérant dans l’essor de l’économie marchande en Chine. Cerner les ressorts de leur dynamisme, mais aussi les contraintes dans lesquelles ils sont enserrés, implique d’exploiter une documentation hétérogène et fragmentée concernant leurs pratiques commerciales, les modalités de leur association, leur comptabilité, leur stratégie d’investissement. Si la Chine des Ming et des Qing voit la multiplication de riches négociants, l’entrepreneur de type capitaliste, au sens que Weber lui donnait, semble absent du paysage économique et social. Trois grandes questions structureront l’exposé: 1. Une révolution commerciale se produit à deux reprises dans l’histoire longue de la Chine, sous les Song, au XIIe siècle, et à la fin des Ming au milieu du XVIe siècle. Pourquoi n’a-t-elle pu porter de fruits? Quels sont les facteurs qui ont inhibé sa transformation en une révolution industrielle, comme celle qu’a connue l’Europe, ou même une révolution industrieuse, qui a caractérisé le Japon de l’ère Tokugawa? 2. Comment s’est constitué cet écosystème particulier, fait de dispositions intangibles, qui a sous-tendu, du XVIe au XIXe siècle, l’extraordinaire essor de l’économie marchande en Chine? Mais explique-t-il aussi son échec et en particulier l’impossible transmutation de l’épargne en capital ? Pourquoi l’accumulation du capital est-elle apparue aussi problématique en Chine ? C’est là que se dévoile le rôle joué par des facteurs habituellement situés hors du champ de l’analyse économique stricto sensu : le poids économique du clan et des lignages, l’environnement juridique voire religieux des pratiques affaires, la prégnance des injonctions morales codifiées en orthodoxie. 3. Le marchand opère dans un univers complexe où se côtoient intermédiaires avides de commissions, contrebandiers, pirates, gentry locale et fonctionnaires corrompus. Il importe alors de décrypter le décalage entre le discours officiel et la pratique, à travers le parcours de trois personnages centraux dans la conduite des affaires en Chine — le bailleur de fonds, l’intermédiaire, et l’entrepreneur commercial — ainsi que les relations ambigües qu’ils entretiennent avec la bureaucratie impériale.\n\nWednesday 25 January 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nVIALLET - THEVENIN Scott : l'émergence d'un espace élitaire impérial et ses conséquences sur l'empire colonial français ; 1885 - 1939\n\nAbstract\n\nCette présentation prend pour objet l’espace impérial, défini par les circulations de groupes élitaires au sein de l’empire colonial français. Les parcours des élites impériales participent de la structuration de l’Empire. Cette recherche s'attache à décrire les processus qui participent de l’émergence de cet espace, le structurent et lui confèrent une certaine spécificité. Il s'appuie sur une analyse des carrières et origines sociales des principaux groupes dirigeants de l'empire colonial français (gouverneurs coloniaux, inspecteurs des colonies, généraux, hommes d’affaires et parlementaires), à partir d'une base de données historique ad hoc de 1300 individus. Nous montrons que l’espace impérial apparaît par déformation de l’espace élitaire métropolitain, et couplage progressif de groupes professionnels avec des espaces géographiques. Autrement dit, l’espace impérial élitaire émerge dans un double mouvement, synchronique, de dissociation des élites métropolitaines et d’interconnexions entre groupes élitaires impériaux ainsi que de mise en relation entre les groupes élitaires impériaux et les territoires colonisés. Leur professionnalisation et partant, l’émergence de l’espace impérial sont alimentés – en sus de logiques organisationnelles - par les opportunités de carrières que les individus trouvent dans les colonies et leur reconversion difficile dans l’espace métropolitain.\n\nWednesday 18 January 2023 12:00-13:30\n\nR1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nJUIF Dacil (Université Carlos III Madrid) : The impact of copper mining activities on education in Zambia from a long-term perspective (1920 to 2000)\n\nwith Laura Maravall-Buckwalter\n\nAbstract\n\nThe cross-country “resource curse” literature links dependence on minerals to worsening socio-economic outcomes, including education. We assess the local impact of large-scale mining activities on schooling in Zambia, a copper-dependent economy, since 1920. We use census data from IPUMS International and study how education differs across regions during the period 1920-2000. Our preliminary results show that proximity to mines raises the average years of schooling by up to around 30 percent in the 1940s. Contrary to what previous African economic history literature has claimed, early mission location has no effect on the comparative development of education within Zambia. The mechanisms explored include income and wealth, urbanization, comparatively skill-intensive job opportunities, and a better supply of schooling by state and mine companies.\n\nWednesday 11 January 2023 09:00-17:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nAtelier Simiand n°4\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 14 December 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nKOEHLER-DERRICK Gabriel : Land Redistribution, Inequality, and Crisis: Evidence from Colonial Ireland\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study the long-run consequences of land redistribution for political inequality and economic development. Between 1652-9, approximately a third of Ireland’s land was redistributed from Irish Catholic elites to English Protestants under the Cromwellian Settlement. While seminal accounts argue that Ireland’s subsequent economic problems, culminating in the Great Famine of 1845-9, can ultimately be traced back to this event, the connection has never been empirically tested. We combine an unusually rich set of granular data sources with several quasi-experimental research designs to show that local-level variation in land redistribution predicts the severity of the famine two centuries later. To make sense of this persistence, we (1) demonstrate that patterns of land ownership remained fixed following the Settlement; (2) show that political representation shifted away from localities where Catholics represented a greater share of the population; (3) establish that increased political and economic inequality reduced the provision of welfare to the Catholic poor, which ultimately worsened the impact of the Famine.\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 7 December 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan\n\nVONYO Tamas : War and Socialism: Economic Backwardness in Eastern Europe\n\nAbstract\n\nThe monograph project builds on the author’s extensive research on economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe under state socialism. Relative backwardness had long been understood as a potential source of growth from Marx, through mid-twentieth century structural economics, to neoclassical growth theory. To economic historians, the canonical references are Gerschenkron on late industrialization and Abramovitz on conditional convergence. In these theoretical frameworks, the postwar economic performance of Eastern Europe was interpreted as a growth failure. Socialism was successful in mobilizing resources for growth but used them inefficiently. Early growth accounts confirmed this view, which echoed institutionalist interpretations favored by comparative economists in Eastern Europe. New growth models, by contrast, highlight the role of endogenous innovation and skill-biased technical change. Human capital is broadly seen as the main source of long run growth. Our standard view on comparative development in Europe since WWII requires revision, both considering recently revised Eastern European growth accounts and new tenets in growth theory. The core argument of the book is that the disproportionately large negative impact of the world wars, with long exposure to warfare, unprecedented population shocks and political disintegration, permanently dislocated the economies of Eastern Europe. Colossal loss of human capital thwarted innovation, reduced returns on new investment, and delayed both postwar reconstruction and structural modernization. The main negative effect of the Cold War was neither trade diversion nor the burden defense spending but instead administrative barriers of access to western technology. Socialist economic progress was stalled in the 1980s not by systemic failure but by the oil shocks and sovereign debt crises in their aftermath. Growth came to a standstill not because of a productivity failure but because of the failure to sustain capital high levels of investment. Post-socialist development could not achieve convergence either despite liberal reforms or reintegration into western markets. Disintegration (often in violent form) and depopulation returned to Eastern Europe after 1990, limiting growth in much the same fashion as they had done half a century earlier.\n\nWednesday 30 November 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan\n\nPALMA Nuno (University of Manchester ) : American treasure and the decline of Spain\n\nAbstract\n\nSpain was one of the world’s richest countries and a first-rank European power around 1500. Two centuries later it was a backwater. In this paper, we study the long-run impact of the influx of silver from the New World since 1500 for the economic development of Spain. Compared with a synthetic counterfactual, the price level in Spain increased by up to 200% more by the mid-seventeenth century. Spain’s GDP per capita outperformed other European nations for around a century: by 1600, it was close to 40% higher than in its counterfactual. However, this effect was reversed in the following 150 years: by 1750, GDP per capita was 40% lower than it would have been if Spain had not been the first-wave receiver of the American treasure.\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 23 November 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan\n\nSCHWANK Hanna (University of Bonn) : Disruptive Effects of Natural Disasters: The 1906 San Francisco Fire\n\nAbstract\n\nNatural disasters are growing in frequency globally. Understanding how vulnerable populations respond to these disasters is essential for effective policy response. This paper explores the short- and long-run consequences of the 1906 San Francisco Fire, one of the largest urban fires in American history. Using linked Census records, I follow residents of San Francisco and their children from 1900 to 1940. Historical records suggest that exogenous factors such as wind and the availability of water determined where the fire stopped. I implement a spatial regression discontinuity design across the boundary of the razed area to identify the effect of the fire on those who lost their home to it. I find that in the short run, the fire displaced affected residents, forced them into lower paying occupations and out of entrepreneurship. Experiencing the disaster disrupted children’s school attendance and led to an average loss of six months of education. While most effects attenuated over time, the negative effect on business ownership persists even in 1940, 34 years after the fire. Therefore, my findings reject the hope for a “reversal of fortune” for the victims, in contrast to what is found for more recent natural disasters such as hurricane.\n\nWednesday 16 November 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nTRAVESIO Emiliano (Universidad Carlos III ) : Freedom in labour: ‘free wombs’ and slave emancipation in postcolonial Uruguay\n\nAbstract\n\nSlavery casts a long shadow on economic and social inequality in the Americas. To understand its legacy we must consider how it came to an end in the 19th century as well as the extent of slave labour itself in the colonial and early national periods. The ‘freedom of wombs’ enshrined in Uruguay’s independence program (1825) and first constitution (1830) was emblematic of the slavery policy of Latin American creole elites during the so-called ‘lost decades’ after colonial rule. Under these free-womb laws, slaves’ children were declared free at birth, but existing slaves remained enslaved and slavery still legitimate. Slave emancipation in this context has rarely been quantitatively studied because of the source lacunae caused by poor state capacity and decades of political unrest. I rely on a new dataset constructed from manuscript population listings from 1834-36 to describe and analyse how Black people (Africans and their immediate descendants) laboured for freedom in Uruguay. I find that the free-wombs legislation was not universally applied and had a small direct impact, reaching only 8% of free Black people, most of whom became free because they paid for their emancipation or because they were born to free parents. Moreover, numeracy rates were higher for free Afro-Uruguayans than for slaves, even if deep-rooted racial gaps in human capital remained large. Using a probit model to control for the effects of age, place of birth, gender, and other covariates, I argue that Black people living in the countryside and in areas of small-scale farming were more likely to be free. Only a minority of Afro-descended people achieved freedom for themselves and their families in early-independent Uruguay. They did so through their own labour—both in the sense of working and giving birth—in an institutional context which was at best indifferent to their destiny.\n\nWednesday 9 November 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan\n\nGIEROK Victoria (Oxford University) : Taxation, Credit and Public Expenditure in Urban Germany, 1400-1800\n\nAbstract\n\nHow did urban revenues and expenditure evolve in pre-industrial Germany? Trends in public wealth are crucial to understanding economic growth, public goods provision and inequality. This paper presents first trends in urban revenues and expenditure from 1350 to 1800. It is based on a novel city-level dataset comprising 22 cities. City selection is shown to be representative of the urban Empire at large. The data reveal the following trends: German cities financed themselves mostly through taxation and to a lesser extent through credit. While income from wealth taxes declined until 1550, income from consumption taxes and credit made up the shortfall. Together, this likely led to an increase in inequality. From 1550, this trend reversed and wealth taxes provided for a large share of income during and after the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648). Prior to the war, cities spent most of their revenues on construction and debt servicing. Construction was focused on administrative buildings. After the war, military expenses and debt servicing dominated city expenditure.\n\nWednesday 2 November 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan\n\nBOBERG-FAZLIC Nina (University of Southern Denmark.) : Taking it outside: Danish-American religious conflict and the integration of Danish migrants\n\nwith Jeanet Bentzen, Paul Sharp, Christian Skovsgaard, and Christian Vedel\n\nAbstract\n\nThe integration of immigrants into the society of the host country is a question of substantial importance for both research and policy. Religion is often seen as a barrier in this context. This paper contributes to the debate by studying Danish migrants emigrating to the U.S. during the age of mass migration, who are generally described as having integrated exceptionally rapidly. While Denmark is usually conceived as a very homogeneous country, during this time period a religious conflict pitted Grundtvigians against the evangelical ‘Inner Mission’ movement; a conflict which played out even more strongly within the Danish communities in the U.S. than in Denmark. We use this unique historical setting to investigate the role of religion, and especially of religious conflict, for the integration and economic success of migrants. Grundtvigian communities focused on preserving Danish culture and tradition, whereas Inner Mission communities argued for assimilation into American society. We investigate whether followers of one congregation integrated faster than those of the other and whether areas with rival churches experienced more or less integration. We are thereby able to draw conclusions on the role of religious institutions for integration and demonstrate that they need not be a barrier.\n\nWednesday 26 October 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan\n\nRYCKBOSCH Wouter (Université de Bruxelles) : Inequality in the streets. Using witness depositions to study social and economic change in 18th and 19th-century urban Belgium\n\nAbstract\n\nBetween 1750 and 1850 cities in Belgium went through a period of profound and comprehensive transition. Industrial mechanisation, urban growth, migration, and political revolution brought an end to the ‘ancien régime’: the society of orders was abolished and replaced by one of the most unequal class-based countries in 19th-century Europe. Although the emergence of a property- and class-based society is widely regarded as one of the most fundamental changes in history, its causes and effects in many cases remain up for debate and revision. By looking at subtle changes in social interactions in everyday life in the modernising city, this contribution aims to contribute to a better understanding of the reconfiguration of the inequality regime in 18th- and 19th-century Belgium. Historians have long argued that everyday life and social relations, such as time-use and labour activities, were impacted by the ascent of industrial mechanisation (Thompson; Glennie & Thrift; Voth). However, in recent years the opposite argument has also been formulated: that the rise of capitalism stimulated property- and class-based social distinctions in daily life prior to, and ultimately leading up to, the French Revolution (Roche; Sewell). The current paper aims to test such hypotheses by examining how everyday patterns of labour, leisure, urban space, and time converged or diverged for different social groups between 1700 and 1900. In order to do so I will use a new dataset of digitised witness depositions from criminal court cases from the town of Bruges to extract and trace patterns over the course of this period.\n\nWednesday 19 October 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nGONZALEZ FELIPE (Queen Mary University) : Policies in Turbulent Times: Historical Evidence from Salvador Allende's Milk Program\n\njoint work with Mounu Prem\n\nAbstract\n\nDemocracies weaken when policies are implemented poorly and fail to sustain or increase government support. We study the link between policy and politics in the context of a country-wide milk program aiming to improve children's health during Salvador Allende's government (1970-1973) in Chile. Using historical data, we show that milk distribution increased markedly during Allende's tenure and followed beneficiaries closely without being distorted by political considerations. Moreover, we show that this public health policy was successful in building political support for Allende's coalition at times when democracy was at risk. We conclude that well-implemented policies can strengthen governments even in turbulent times.\n\nWednesday 12 October 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.13, Campus Jourdan\n\nBENVENISTE Stéphane (INED-AMSE) : Political and Business Dynasties in France: a Social Gradient in Returns to Elite Education\n\nAbstract\n\nDynasties constitute a visible sign of intergenerational persistence and raise questions on the legitimacy of the ruling elite. Among graduates of prestigious higher education institutions, this paper quantifies occupational following in the French political and business elites. I link nominative data on 103,309 graduates from 12 French Grandes Écoles born between 1931 and 1975 to their professional careers between 1958 and 2019 as politicians with national-level mandates or as board members of French firms. Identifying familial lineage though shared surnames, I find that children of political and business leaders had higher chances than their graduate peers to embrace careers in the elite, emphasizing a social gradient in returns to elite education. Political dynasties were particularly sizeable, although progressively declining. These dynasties also affect the composition of the French elite. Indeed, dynastical board members are less frequently graduates from top institutions than first-generation directors, and members of the elite manage to propel their offspring much younger to top business and political positions.\n\nWednesday 5 October 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nMOHR Cathrin (University of Bonn ) : Who makes it in an Autocracy?

Using detailed CV data on potential politicians and information about the official state hierarchy, we track and quantify career trajectories within the regime over time. Becoming connected to leading politicians can harm high-profile careers, while it has a positive effect on low-profile careers. We exploit exogenous networks that were formed through joint imprisonment during the Nazi Era. An extensive analysis of potential mechanisms suggests that the negative effect of being linked to the party leadership on individuals' probability to be part of the ruling elite is the result of anti-factionalism.\n\nWednesday 28 September 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan\n\nROSENTHAL Jean-Laurent (California Institute of Technology) : Do Entrepreneurs Want Control? A Historical and Theoretical Exploration\n\nJoint with Naomi Lamoreaux (Yale and Michigan)\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are a number of accounts in US business history of entrepreneurs who secured financial backing for startups only to find that their investors were more intent on profiting from the initial discovery than in funding ongoing innovation. The entrepreneurs we tend to know about quit those ventures, often forfeiting their intellectual property as a consequence, and found backing to start additional ventures that were very successful. In the late nineteenth century US entrepreneurs could do little about this problem of conservative investors. The only way they could secure control over their startups was to own more than fifty percent of the equity. But in Great Britain or on the European continent, it was possible to separate income rights from control rights, and entrepreneurs could lock in control at the time the enterprise was formed. The purpose of this paper is to explore the circumstances under which they would want to take this step using a simple two-period model in which entrepreneurs get a benefit from innovating that is not captured by the firm or its investors. This additional benefit means that there are projects the entrepreneur would want to take on in the second period that would impose losses on the investor. Knowing this, the investor would require an additional payment upfront if the entrepreneur wanted to lock in control. The model suggests that entrepreneurs can only bear this cost in circumstances where the opportunity cost of capital is low and/or the externality is high. That is, having permissive legal rules is only sometimes useful.\n\nWednesday 21 September 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nMA Debin (University of Oxford) : Ideology and Economic Change: the Contrasting Paths to the Modern Economy in late 19th century China and Japan\n\nwith Jared Rubin\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper revisits the old thesis of the contrasting paths of modernization between Japan and China. It develops a new analytical framework regarding the role of ideology and ideological change—Meiji Japan’s decisive turn towards the West pitted against Qing China’s lethargic response to the Western imperialism—as the key driver behind these contrasting paths. Our model and historical narrative highlights the contrast between Tokugawa Japan’s feudal decentralized political regime and Qing China’s centralized bureaucratic system as key determinants behind the differential patterns of ideological realignment. Meanwhile, we argue that the 1894-95 Japanese naval victory over China could not be justified under the prevailing Imperial Chinese ideology and thus served as the catalyst for China’s subsequent ideological transformation, which occurred via borrowing Japan’s successful Meiji reforms of both institutions and ideology. Our new analytical framework developed closely from a comparative historical narrative sheds new insights on the role of ideology and ideological change – as distinguished from culture and institutions - to our understanding of political and economic change.\n\nWednesday 14 September 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nTERKI-MIGNOT Auriane (University of Cambridge) : Occupational structure and patterns of women's work in France, 1792-1901\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper will introduce a project aiming to establish patterns of women’s work over the period of French industrialisation.

This paper presents detailed evidence from the ship’s trading log that decomposes the goods in the bundle and, uniquely, identifies the European and African merchants who sold captives to the boat. We examine the cross-cultural trade documented by this dataset and show that total prices increased throughout the trade, since the ship faced time pressure as soon as the first captive was aboard, and that the captain increased the price of the bundle by adding more goods and especially by adding high-price goods. We also show that sellers participated both as one-shot traders and as repeat traders, selling the ship captives at multiple points in the trade, and that sellers with honorifics indicating status positions did not appear to earn greater prices as observed in the trading log. The market we observe was neither purely based on barter nor based on goods as substitutes for currency. Our results thus add a nuanced picture of how a trade that destroyed the lives of millions of people worked “on the ground.”\n\nWednesday 8 June 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nSIMSON Rebecca (University of Oxford) : Elite persistence in Sierra Leone: what can names tell us?\n\nwith Yannick Dupraz and Henry Musa Kpaka\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 1 June 2022 12:00-13:30\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nLEWIS Mary (Harvard University) : Restoration Commerce: France and Haiti during the Bourbon Restoration\n\nAbstract\n\nIn 1825, some twenty-one years after Haiti (hitherto Saint-Domingue) had defeated France in the Haitian Revolution, Charles X formally recognized the independence of Haiti in exchange for a punishing indemnity to former landowners, originally set at 150 million French francs. Obscured in the important story of punitive debt, however, is what French officials hoped to gain from the new relationship besides a sense of recompense for former colonists. It is true that the 1825 agreement was conceived, at least in part, as a way of finally putting the claims of former planters to rest by compensating them for their lost land, and in some indirect way, for their emancipated slaves. But it was also a commercial treaty predicated on a future of trade between France and its former colony that would be both voluminous and lucrative. Aimed at creating a “most-favored” trading status for France by reducing Haitian customs duties by half for the former metropole, the 1825 recognition of Haitian independence thus was not only about set"
