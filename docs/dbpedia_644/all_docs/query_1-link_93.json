        "text": "Gefallen: Seitengewehr Niere\n\nAnd his family probably received the euphemism: died painless, as hero, by one shot through the heart.\n\nI can imagine a bayonet through a kidney is a long and painful process\n\nSo sad, that poor generation.\n\nGreat work, thank you all for keeping up this small online altar as a reminder that war is not quite the solution for every conflict!\n\nI will place a few other cards in future, that I have not seen here already. Although I still have to do a few pages.\n\nMan, what a database...\n\nName: Siegfried Lohse\n\nDate of birth: 18.7.1913\n\nPlace of birth: Floha\n\nDeath/missing date: 1.9.1939\n\nDeath/missing place: bei Mokra III\n\nGefallen: brustschuß im panzerwagen (chest shot in the tank)\n\nAn Unteroffizier in Stabskompanie der I./Panzer Regiment 35\n\nName: Werner Kaden\n\nDate of birth: 24.12.1915\n\nPlace of birth: Floha\n\nDeath/missing date: 12.9.1939\n\nDeath/missing place: Lowicz\n\nA Gefreiter in 1./Infanterie Regiment 102\n\nName: Willy Geißler\n\nDate of birth: 6.9.1913\n\nPlace of birth: Floha\n\nDeath/missing date: 12.9.1939\n\nDeath/missing place: bei Matyldzin\n\nGefallen: infanterie geschuß lungenschuß (shot in the lung)\n\nAn Unteroffizier in 1./Infanterie Regiment 72\n\nName: Erwin Richter\n\nDate of birth: 27.8.1910\n\nPlace of birth: Oederau\n\nDeath/missing date: 17.9.1939\n\nDeath/missing place: Lublin\n\nGefallen: infanterie geschuß brust (shot in the chest)\n\nA Schütze in 2./Maschinengewehr Bataillon 7\n\nName: Rudi Scheithauer\n\nDate of birth: 24.10.1918\n\nPlace of birth: Floha\n\nDeath/missing date: 19.4.1941\n\nDeath/missing place: angriff auf London\n\nCause of death as noted by Blackcat in post #884\n\nAn Obergefreiter in 1.

KG z.b.V. 300 had a Ju 52 coded (KB+HO) reported to be lost near Iraklion. All four crew members were missing. This was Feldwebel Franz Mende, Unteroffizier Kurt Hempel, Unteroffizier Rolf Hofmann, and Flieger Kurt Augustin. The unit was flying supply missions to North Afrika from the airfields on Kreta. This plane was lost over the sea after taking off from Iraklion and flying towards Derna in Libya.\n\nThis is also a special one to me: Gefreiter (!) Berno Heilig, Beobachter in a Sturzkampfgeschwader. He washed up on the Dutch shore of Noordwijk and was buried first at Katwijk, where I live. After the war he was reburried at Ysselsteyn, section TBB3-31.\n\nA large card, glued to paper, and on the backside of the paper is a picture from Benno glued.\n\nThe family made a lot of work from the cards, this is not your average death notice.

I was not aware of this possibility, but I got rather excited when I browsed through this section!\n\nClick to enlarge the picture\n\nHi Martin.\n\nHere is the casualty card for Berno -\n\nName: Berno Heilig\n\nRank: Gefreiter\n\nBirth Date: 21 May 1921\n\nBirth Plac: Augsburg\n\nMilitary Unit: 6./Staffel Kampfgeschwader 6\n\nDeath Date: 19 October 1942\n\nDeath Place: Offküfte England, Feindflug Nordsee\n\nRelative: Otto Heilig\n\nHis cause of death is noted as Feindflug (Combat flight)\n\nMIA 19 October, 1942 with unnamed crew, cause unknown (Ju 88 Loss List).
