Scope and Limitations This report was prepared primarily for DDP internal use. It consists of a narrative describing the expellee group in Bavaria with special attention to the two most significant groups, the Sudeten Germans and the Silesians; and a directory in outline form of emigre organizations, which have headquarters or representatives in Bavaria. The study is based on research material available in Washington, both in the Agency and the Department of State. In accordance with the requester's wish, no attempt has been made to levy special requirements on the field. The information on emigres contained in Part III is limited by the fact that available material is in many cases out of date. These reports give a comprehensive picture of the emigre groups with which they deal. However, the fact that they are in some cases several years old means that the information cannot now be considered current or complete. The biographic data in Appendix B, with the exception of the report on Dr. Koch, was prepared by Biographic Information Divi- sion of the Department of State.

Introduction The presence in Bavaria of large numbers of foreign born resi- dents is an important factor in the political, economic, and social life of the Land. The non-native residents fall into several cate- gories: the expellees (Vertriebene), the refugees (Fluechtlinge) and the non-German speaking emigres. For the purpose of this paper, expellees are considered to be the inhabitants of the German provinces east of the Oder-Neisse line and the ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) whose homes were outside the boundaries of the German Reich as of December 31, 1937. Refugees are those former inhabitants of the Soviet zone and East Berlin who fled to West Germany for reasons of personal safety, political or economic con- siderations. Non-German speaking emigres are foreign nationals from the USSR, the satellites or Yugoslavia, who are opposed to the current political regimes in their homelands. Of the three groups, the expellees are most important in the Bavarian scene because of their large numbers, the problems involved in their integration into the Federal Republic, and their irreden- tism. Section II of this report deals with the expellees as a whole, describing their current economic and political situation and their organizations. The two most important expellee groups, the Sudeten Germans and the Silesians, are considered in detail. The refugees, coming into a culture very similar to that which they left and consisting to a greater degree than the expellees of young employable individuals, have assimilated rapidly into the Federal Republic. Although political and cultural associa- tions have been formed by the refugees, they have not attracted sufficient interest or support to be effective pressure groups. The desire of the refugees to \"disappear\" in West Germany to avoid pressure which might be exercised against them from the East Zone has also tended to discourage the formation of identifiable groups or the rise of refugee leaders. Refugees, therefore, while in- cluded in some of the material dealing with expellees, are not discussed separately as a group in the following report. Emigres, of minor interest in the political or economic develop- ment of Bavaria, have nevertheless an intelligence value as sources of information on the homeland, propagandists, or potential leaders in case of a change of government in their former homes. Section III on emigres identifies where possible their organiza- tions, leaders and publications.

General Characteristics The problem of assimilating the expellees was more severe in Bavaria than in other Laender of the Federal Republic. Although expellees possessed a language and a cultural background gener- ally similar to that prevailing in West Germany, each expellee group had its own history, traditions and habits and in many cases had adopted some elements of the native culture of its former home- land. Bavaria, with its strong local traditions and characteristic reserve or even hostility towards newcomers, experienced more fric- tion than did other less particularistic areas. In addition, other factors complicated the situation. The relatively backward state of communications and the long distances between rural communities in the Land made it difficult to move expellees who had been un- suitably placed in the first distribution. The agrarian structure of the country--small farm holdings and not much free land avail- able--made an additional problem in settling the agrarian expellees satisfactorily. The usual solution of employing them as farmhands suited neither the formerly independent expellees nor the highly individualistic Bavarian peasants. ji Of the approximate eight and one-half million expellees located in the Federal Republic, 1,850,200 are in Bavaria. They account for 20.2 per cent of the population, a percentage exceeded only by Schleswig-Holstein (28.1 per cent) and Lower Saxony (25.8 per cent). By far the largest group of expellees are the ethnic Germans who inhabited the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia before World War II. According to statistics compiled in 1950, of the 1,912,000 Sudetens living in West Germany, over one-half, (1,026,400), are settled in Bavaria. The next largest group were the Silesians, of which 461,000 or about one-fifth of the total number in West Germany were in Bavaria. Other substantial groups of expellees in Bavaria are the former residents of East Prussia, West Prussia, Memelland and Danzig (10)1,600),, ethnic Germans from Yugoslavia (67,500), from Hungary (49,200), from Poland (48,800, from Rumania (46,100), and from the former German province of Pomerania (34,800). German expellees from the USSR total 10,700 and from the former Baltic nations, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, 8,900. V In sex and age composition, the expellee group shows the same structure as the post-war resident population, i.e. a deficit of males, especially young adults, and a preponderance of middle aged individuals, especially women. However, the displaced popu- lation shows a more normal age-sex structure than the resident population, having a smaller proportionate surplus of females, fewer aged and a stronger representation of young adults, especi- ally young men. I/ The expellees are younger than the rest of the population, the median age for males being 28.5 years and for females 32.5 years, according to statistics dated September 1950. The dif- ference in age and sex structure between the expellee and the resident groups resulted from the higher birth rate of the Eastern European Germans, the selective processes of flight and expulsion, and the fewer war casualties suffered by the German minorities. 2.-V In terms of occupational skills, the expellees represent a strong industrial population. In contrast with the Bavarian labor force which in 1939 had 38.2 per cent of the total employed in agriculture, 34.3 per cent in industry and handicrafts, 14.5 per cent in trade and transportation, and 13 per cent in other 2 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET vocations, the expellees in their former occupations had 39.7 per cent engaged in industry and handicrafts, 35.1 per cent in agri- culture, 14.3 per cent in trade and transportation and 10.9 per cent in other vocations. East Zone refugees show an even higher proportion of workers in the industrial, handicrafts, trade and transportation groups. ..51 ' Although the difficulties involved in finding work in their new locations has meant occupational downgrading for many expellees who have taken jobs in which their previous skills are not used, it is estimated that the largest occupational group among the ex- pellees is employed in the manufacturing trades. Expellee employ- ment generally is increasing. In September 1950, unemployment among expellees was about twice as high as for the rest of the population; in April 1956, it was estimated that the expellees accounted for 24 per cent of the unemployed as opposed to 17 per cent of the total population. f/ The increasing integration of the expellees into the predomi- nantly agricultural Bavarian economy has tended to diversify and industrialize it. In 1951, although expellee and refugee indus- trial, handicraft and trade establishments amounted to less than 10 per cent of all such establishments in Bavaria, in textiles, glass and processing of artificial materials, the share was much higher. Expellee effort, mainly on the part of the Silesians and Sudetens who came from areas where the textile industry was highly developed, has made an important contribution to the embroidering and knitting mills in Oberfranken and South Schwaben. Large glass making centers have grown up in Kaufbeuren, Schwaben, Bayreuth and Oberfranken where Sudeten expellee groups are practicing their traditional skills. The costume jewelry industry in Neu Gablonz, an important dollar earner, was established and developed by Sudeten initiative. V The relatively high degree of economic integration which the expellees have reached in Bavaria is the result in part of action by the Land government in providing funds, both loans and grants, to help expellees establish themselves. Bavaria also set up a Committee for Refugees and Expellees, supported by Landtag funds, whose function was to aid expellee industry, recommend legislation to improve expellee conditions, answer inquiries, and provide legal aid. Resettlement and land reform programs were also under- taken ._/ Politically the expellees have not tended to unite in a single party. The closest thing to an expellee party is the All-German Bloc-League of Expellees and Disenfranchised (Gesamtdeutsche Block-Bund der Heimatvertriebenen und Entrechteten - GB-BHE), which, however, does not include all or even the most prominent expellees active in political life. Moreover, the BHE does not consist exclusively of expellees and refugees. Its local chairman in Bavaria, Willi Guthsmuths, has only a tenuous claim to the Sudetenland having served there as a government official from 1941 until 1945. The disappearance of the BHE as a national party in the September 1957 elections indicates a growing tendency among the expellees to work toward their aims through the major political parties rather than as members of a special interest group. In Bavaria the leaders of the BHE are attempting to divorce the party from its original concept as an expellee and refugee group. The statement announcing the party's withdrawal from the four-party Land coalition following the national elections was made in the name of the Gesamtdeptsche Block (GB), the initials BHE having been dropped entirely. There are indications �that some of the party leaders believe that its future lies in the 3 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET formation of a new right of center party which would include the BHE, FDP and other conservative elements. 21 Contrary to the early expectations voiced by Allied observers, expellees have not joined extreme rightist political parties in any considerable numbers. The extreme Left, as might be expected, attracts no support among expellees who resent the Communists as the authors of their exile. Expellee organizations have been formed for economic, social, cultural and professional reasons. The principal group, organized on the federal level is the League of Expelled Germans (Bund der vertriebenen Deutschen - BvD), which has principally represented expellee and refugee economic interests. The BvD provides its mem- bers with information on their financial claims, lobbies for social and economic benefits, and attempts to further the nomination of expellee candidates for public office. It has made special efforts to further such legislation as the Equalization of Burdens Law (Lastenausgleich Gesetz), and the Federal Law on the Legal Status of Expellees and Refugees (Bundesgesetz ueber die Angelegenheiten der Vertriebenen und Fluechtlin4e). The three chairmen of the BvD Land chapter in Bavaria are: Dr. Joachim Borngraeber, Josef Boehm and Herbert Rubusch. 12/ Probably more important in Bavaria are the homeland associations (Landsmannschaften) of expellees from the same country of origin which have concentrated on maintaining the cultural ties between the expellees and their former habitations and on seeking to ob- tain recognition of their homeland claims from the Federal govern- ment, the Western allies and the satellite exile groups. The Landsmannschaften are organized according to the regional location of the expellees in West Germany into Land chapters (Landesverbaende), which are subdivided into Bezirksverbaende, Kreisverbaende, and Ortsverbaende according to the size and location of the expellee groups. 22/ Within the Landsmannschaften there are also groups (Heimatgruppen) of expellees who claim the same locality of origin in the homeland. Nineteen expellee Landsmannschaften have joined together to form a Federal roof organization, the League of Homeland Associa- tions (Verband der Landsmannschaften - VdL). A loose association whose primary purpose is to coordinate policy, the VdL has been moderate in pres.sing its claims to the homeland and enjoys good relations with the Bonn government from which it receives some financial support. The chairman of the Bavarian Land chapter is Dr. Hans Menzel; Dr. Paul Tiling is the manager. A number of the member associations maintain headquarters or regional offices in Munich. The Sudetens and the Silesians are the most significant of these groups because of their large memberships and aggressive attitude toward their eventual return to the homeland. L21 Expellee youth has its own organization: The German Youth of the East (Deutsche Jugend des Ostens - DJO). Formed in 1951, it is composed of semi-autonomous youth groups sponsored by the individual Landsmannschaften. The national chairman is a Bavarian Sudeten youth leader, Ossi Boese. Although dedicated to keeping alive the memory of the homeland among its members, the DJO ap- pears to be generally inactive in political and Landsmannschaft affairs. The rapid assimilation of expellee youth into their new environment suggests that their indifference toward expellee matters is likely to increase. 1.21 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET Other expellee organizations* centered in Munich are scientific and cultural institutions, religious and welfare groups, and re- search institutions concerned with refugee questions. One of the most interesting of these is the Eastern European Institute (Ost- Europa Institut) at the University of Munich, directed by Dr. Hans Koch.** A center for Eastern European studies, principally in the fields of law, history and politics, the Institute sponsors publi- cations and lectures on Eastern European subjects. It is re- portedly financed by the Federal Republic and Land governments. Dr. Koch, a long time specialist on eastern affairs, is frequently consulted by the Federal Republic Foreign Ministry on eastern prob- lems. He accompanied Adenauer to Moscow in 1955 as an advisor. Lit B. The Sudeten German Expellees The Sudetens are the most nationalistic and best organized group among the expellees. The Sudeten German Landsmannschaft has about 350-360,000 members in Western Gemany of which an estimated 197,000 are in Bavaria. The Landsmannschaft spokesman, Dr. Rudolf Lodgman von Auen, a long time exponent of Sudeten interests, has been for many years the leader of the organization and of the Sudetens generally. Recently, however, his leadership has been challenged by groups both within and without the Landsmannschaft who feel that at 79 he is too old to exercise his authority com- petently and that his handling of Sudeten affairs is too much a one-man show. In addition to the VdL, Sudetens form a strong group in the BvD. Sudetens also play an important part in the expellee youth organization, the DJO. A Bavarian Sudeten, Ossi Boese, the DJO national chairman, is as well the chairman of the Sudeten German youth group, a member of the Executive Committee of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft and of the Sudeten German Council. In Munich the Adalbert Stifter Society is a Sudeten-sponsored cultural organization. 1.2/ Several factions with varying political complexions and aims exist within the Sudeten group. Of these the most influential, in that its aims correspond generally with the majority of Landsmannschaft members, is the Witiko Bund. Small in numbers-- it has an estimated 400 members--it nevertheless includes some of the most aggressive and energetic personalities in the Lands- mannschaft. Leader of the Bund is Frank Seiboth, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Landsmannschaft. Federal Minister of Transport Hans Cristoph Seebohm is also reputedly a member, as are Dr. Walter IBecher, *** Secretary General of the Sudeten German Council, and Dr. Herbert Tusch, personal aide of Seebohm and a functionary of the Deutsche Partei (DP) in Bavaria. ly Said to be a continuation of an earlier group of the same name which was organized in Bohemia in 1901 by a group of German- speaking intellectuals to defend German interests, the Witiko Bund was revived in Germany after the post-war expulsion. It is composed of right wing elements who describe themselves as national though not nationalistic, i.e. aggressive in defense of Sudeten * See Appendix A: \"List of Expellee Organizations and Institu- tions in Munich.\" * * * * * See Biographic Appendix. See Biographic Appendix. 5 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET interests but tolerant of the rights of other national or ethnic groups. Nominally non-political, the Bund aims to propagandize Sudeten objectives quietly and among small groups by placing its members in leading organizations and offices in German life. Among political parties it is closest to the BHE and the Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei - FDP), although some of its more raTITC-71 elements incline to the rightist fringe parties. 1././ According to a report dated 1 June 1954, a small section of extreme nationalists were cooperating at that time in certain Com- munist propaganda objectives. The Deutsche National Zeitun , a weekly newspaper published in Munich and reported to be subsidized by Communist sources in the Soviet Zone, had several members of the Witiko Bund associated with it and, in connection with the 1954 Sudetendeutsche Tag, published a special edition devoted entirely to the Sudetens. Sudetens were urged to repudiate the policy of Dr. Lodgman, which called for a federation of the Danubian basin areas, and to work for a neutral and unified Germany. Despite the large sale of the special edition (40,000 copies), it does not appear that the paper has much following or influence among the Sudetens generally or the Witiko Bund in particular. The majority of the Witiko Bund members follow a policy of identification with the West. They see the solution of the Sudeten problem in the incorporation of the Sudetenland into a unified Germany. .L_8/ The second faction within the Landsmannschaft is the Seliger Gemeinde, a group of Social Democrats who wish to work out expellee problems within the framework of Social Democratic domestic and foreign policies. Since approximately 30 per cent of the Sudetens are Social Democrats, they appear to have a solid base for influ- encing the party. The results of the recent national elections, however, suggest that the Gemeinde has not enjoyed much success in its efforts. The poor performance of the Social Democratic Party (Social-Demokratische Partei - SPD) in Bavaria, particularly in the border areas adjacent to the Iron Curtain, is thought to be due to the unpopularity of the SPD position on foreign and defense poli- cies. Wenzel Jaksch, Sudeten-German SPD Bundestag member from Hesse and a co-chairman of the Seli er Gemeinde, decried SPD \"bungling\" in a recent article on the elections in the SPD-Sudeten publication Die Bruecke. Leading figure in the Gemeinde in Bavaria is Sni-Bundestag deputy Richard Reitzner, one of three co-chairmen. 22/ The third grouping among the Sudetens is the Ackermann Gemeinde. Named after the Ackermann aus Boehmen (The Plowman from Bohemia, a 14th century discourse on life and death), it grew out of a nucleus of members of the pre-war Catholic students' and workers' associations in the Sudeten areas. Its membership, which includes Catholic clergymen and laymen active in religious affairs, amounts to about one per cent of the Sudeten group. However its close association with the Catholic Church, from which it receives financial support, and its good political connections give it a more consequential position than its numbers suggest. The Ackermann Gemeinde's basic goal is to teach its members to lead a life consonant with religious ideals and to maintain the cultural traditions of their homeland. 22/ Politically it is close to the CLU/CSU and supports Adenauerls policy of integration with the West. For east-central Europe it advocates a form of federalized structure in which the Sudeten areas would have an autonomous status. Its conservative and Catholic orientation attracted the monarchist element among the Sudetens and, according to a report dated 1 June 1954, it had close ties with Otto von Hapsburg who had recently moved near 6 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET Munich. The leaders of the Ackermann association were then stated to be Hans Schuetz, CSU Bundestag deputy, Pater Sladek, a Jesuit priest, and Emil Franzl, a Catholic convert and former Marxist theoretician. Eli The three factions among the Sudetens do not differ on long term Sudeten aims which are: recognition of the Sudetens' right to return to their homeland, their right to compensation for losses suffered during their forced expulsion from Czechoslovakia, and their right to equality of treatment with other peoples in the area of Czechoslovakia on the basis of self-determination. They disagree on immediate goals and on the methods by which both long and short term aims can be accomplished. Lodgman, although he i5 in accord with the general program for the Sudeten future, has had frequent differences of opinion with each of the three group- ings, particularly the Witiko Bund, whose tendency toward radical- ism he reportedly deplores. ly Several recent developments have diminished Lodgman's influ- ence and position within the expellee group. An internal reor- ganization, carried out in 1954, relieved him of the administra- tive work of the Landsmannschaft. Lodgman declined reelection as Landesobmann of the Bavarian branch of the Sudetendeutsche Lands- mannschaft in favor of his follower, Rudolf Gertler, in order to devote himself to policy-making. .2.3/ During the same year the local organizations of the Lands- mannschaft elected a legislative body, the Federal Assembly, and an executive organ, the 14-member Federal Council. Dr. Lodgman was unanimously elected Speaker (Sprecher). However his candi- date for chairman of the Council was defeated by Frank Seiboth, a rival for Sudeten leadership. Dr. Seebohm became President of the Assembly. The new alignment, while testifying to Lodgman's personal prestige, appeared to contain more members of the oppo- sition than Lodgman supporters and represented a successful revolt against his authority. .24/ In the field of foreign policy the Working Committee for the Protection of Sudeten German Interests (Arbeitsgemeinschaft zur Wahrung Sudetendeutscher Interessen) was reorganized. This group, formed in 1947, concerned itself with the �conduct of Sudeten affairs in international politics and in relation to other na- tional groups. It drew up memoranda for the United Nations, col- lected documentary material on the expulsion and negotiated the agreement with the right wing exile Czech group headed by Gen. Lev Prchala on the return of the Sudetens to their homeland.* In April 1955, it was reorganized as the Sudeten German Council (Sudetendeutscher Rat) with 28 members including a presidium of four chairmen. �THe four chairmen who officiate in rotation for a period of six months each are: Dr. Rudolf Lodgman, Richard Reitzner, Hans Schuetz, and Dr. Johannes Strosche,**a member of the BHE. Dr. Walter Becher, chairman of the BHE Landtag faction and former secretary of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft, is Secretary General of the Council. 2.2/ * The agreement between the Czechoslovak National Committee headed by Prchala and the Working Committee under the leadership of Lodgman was signed in August 1950. Its terms provided for the Sudeten right to return to Czechoslovakia without defining the future boundary of that country and granted restitution of damages suffered by both Czechs and Germans either as exiles or refugees. **See Biographic Appendix. 7 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET The establishment of the Council was due at least in part to a desire on the part of some of the Sudeten factions to widen the base of authority for conducting foreign relations rather than leaving it exclusively in the hands of Dr. Lodgman. Although Dr. Lodgman has retained a position of authority on the Council's presidium, he shares it with Reitzner and Schuetz, both of whom represent distinct factions within the expellee group and politi- cal parties with whose policies Lodgman is not always in sympathy. Furthermore, Lodgmants physical frailty--he has recently had to forego his turn as chairman--has decreased his activity and influ- ence. L61 One of the principal issues of controversy between Lodgman and other Sudeten leaders is the group of young men who surround Lodgman and staff his office. Some of these, it is felt, shelter behind the Sprecherls office and prestige while attempting to manip- ulate Sudeten policy in the direction they desire. The principal target for criticism is Lodgmants personal assistant, Dr. Rudolf Hilf. Dr. Hilf has been intimately involved in the Czech language broadcasts from Radio Madrid. These programs were initiated in December 1955 under the joint sponsorship of the Czech-Sudeten German Federal Committee* and the European Documentation and Infor- mation Center (EDIC), a monarchist organization controlled by Otto von Hapsburg. Although the Sudeten group had long agitated for broadcasts urging Czech-Sudeten understanding and a new approach to the problems of Central Europe, and had complained bitterly that their position was not properly represented by Radio Free Europe (RYE) and other Western radio stations, the Madrid programs have been a source of friction between various Sudeten expellee groups. ?I/ The Socialist and BHE-oriented segments accuse Lodgman of trying to bypass the Sudeten-German Council on a matter of foreign policy. They feel, in addition, that the scripts, which are reportedly written by Hilf and Locher, are of such low quality that they will not provide effective propaganda and will be easy for the Czech regime to ridicule and refute. Further aspects which arouse dis- trust among many Socialist Sudetens include the connection be- tween EDIC and the Abendlaendische Akademie, an extreme rightist organization active in Bavaria since 1951, and the employment for the broadcasts of Dr. Bohdan Chudoba, who had been accused of anti-semitic activities under the Nazis and of Communist collabora- tion in the early post-war period. Among the expellee adherents of the BHE, the feeling that the programs would confuse the issue of the fight against Communism was expressed. 213/ The most persistent critic of Dr. Hilf and other young men in the Kanzlei of the Sprecher, is Erich Maier, member of the Witiko Bund and publisher of a number of expellee publications including the newspaper, Der Sudetendeutsche, Der Vertriebenen Anzeiger, a weekly newspaper for expellees in general, and two weekly newsletters, Mitteilungs und Informations Dienst (MID), covering events of interest to expellees, and Mid-Ost, devoted to developments within the satellite countries. Maier has not attacked Lodgman directly but has criticized his staff on several issues including the Madrid broadcasts, the forged \"Spellman\" * This body, formed in about 1951 to foster Sudeten-Czech rela- tions, consists of Lodgman, Reitzner and Schuetz for the Sudetens and Prchala,Locher, and Kervicer of the London Czech group. 8 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 � Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET letters,* and the continuous disregard for the Sudetendeutsche Rat as a policy-making organization. Dr. Hilf has been defended in the columns of the Sudetendeutsche Zeitun ** with the result that the differences between the Sudeten factions have developed into a well-publicized and running controversy. 221 It seems probable that with Lodgman's increasing disability or death the struggle for leadership among the Sudetens will con- tinue and be intensified. Since none of the other Sudeten leaders command the respect or popular support that Lodgman does, the chances of unifying opinion among the various groups are small. Should the partisans of the Sudetendeutsche Rat win a greater degree of influence within the movement, it is possTETe that the Sudetens could develop relations with other more flexible and conciliatory Czech exile groups instead of limiting their contacts to the adher- ents of General Prchala. However, in view of the hostility which the Sudeten expellees have demonstrated toward RFE and the Czechs involved in its broadcasts to Czechoslovakia,*** one of the few subjects upon which Sudetens of all shades of political opinion seem to agree, such a development does not appear probable in the near future. Some observers have suggested that the Madrid broad- casts, by giving the Sudetens an opportunity to voice their own problems and opinions, may reduce the friction between them and RFE. Even if the Sudetens succeed in reaching a position of amity among themselves and in extending their relations beyond the extreme right wing of exile Czechs, they do not appear to have any consider- able potential as a political influence in Germany under present circumstances. The moderate tone of their recent public pronounce- ments, the tendency for expellees to align themselves with one of the established West German political parties rather than the special interest BHE party, and the increasing degree of economic integration achieved by the expellees in West Germany all indicate that, at least as long as the present stability of West German political and economic life is maintained, the Sudeten problem is progressively less significant. * A series of forged letters, allegedly written by Cardinal Spellman, expressing support of Lodgman. The letters were made public and hailed by Dr. Hilf as being of great political significance. ** Munich daily newspaper devoted to Sudeten interests. It was reported in 1955 to be under the joint ownership of the firm Eides Gmbh. (75 per cent control) and Dr. Lodgman (25 per cent control). Dr. Hilf is said to be influential in the formation of the paper's editorial policy. 12/ *** RFE frequently has been attacked by the Sudetens as anti- German. Wenzel Gaksch, CSU deputy to the Bavarian Landtag, presented a bill of complaints to the Landta in August 1955 in which he charged that the station's activities hindered German-Czech understanding by. tacitly approving the expropria- tion of German property and by slandering General Prchala. More recently RFE was sharply criticized by the Sudetendeutsche Zeitung for its role in the Hungarian crisis. A leading article published in February 1957 demanded that the Federal govern- ment make representations in Washington to influence a change in the RFE,s expellee policies. 321 9 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET C. The Silesian German Expellees Silesian Germans make up the largest expellee group in West Germany (2,053,300) of which approximately one-fifth (461,100) are located in Bavaria. They are organized on the Federal level in two Landsmannschaften--the Silesian with headquarters in Bonn, and the Upper Silesian with headquarters in Frankfurt. 121 The Silesian Landsmannschaft is represented in Bavaria by a local branch (Landesverband) with an estimated 50,000 members. Landes- verband officials (as of 1955) were: Herbert Hupka,* 1st Chairman; Franz Zdralek, 1st deputy Chairman; Karl Klammt, 2nd deputy Chair- man. Of these, Hupka, who is also deputy chairman of the Federal organization is reported to be sympathetic to the aims of the SPD and Zdralek is an SPD Landtag deputy from Nuremburg; Klammt is a member of the BHE. The election of these officials appears to indicate a growing influence on the part of SPD or SPD-oriented members in the Landsmannschaft and a further decline in the con- servative elements, never very strong at any time. The CSU/CDU has not attracted much support among the Silesians although it should be noted that Dr. Walter Rinke, honorary chairman of the Federal Landsmannschaft and probably the most influential person- ality in the organization, is a CDU/CSU Bundestag deputy. 12/ The Upper Silesian Landsmannschaft is a small organization of expellees who wish to preserve ale traditional distinction between Upper and Lower Silesia. It has several branches, possibly one in Bavaria. Other Silesian organizations include The Friends of the Eichendorf Guild (Freunde der Eichendorfgilde), a cultural association located in Munich.--The Silesians have cooperated with the Sudeten and other expellees in the VdL and the BvD and maintain a youth group which is a member of the expellee youth group, the DJO. The Silesian expellees have as their long time aim the return to the homeland. Cognizant however of the practical difficulties which the realization of this aim entails, they have been moderate in their demands for support and appear to enjoy good relations with the Federal government. They have on the whole supported Adenauerls foreign policy although some expellees, notably the Bavarian group, are unenthusiastic about German rearmament, believ- ing that it will further postpone reunification and the settle- ment of their claims. 3_51 The Silesian expellees have attempted to make contact with Polish exile groups in order to work out a solution for the central European problem for the future. These attempts, however, have foundered on the Oder-Neisse question, since neither group is willing to make concessions as to where the final Polish-German boundary should be. 161 Although Herbert Hupka, at the 1955 meeting of the Bavarian branch of the Silesian Landsmannschaft, cited statistics which he claimed indicated that the organization was growing and that the number of local branches in Bavaria was increasing, it seems improbable that there has been in fact a real increase in interest among the expellees. The membership of the Landsmann- schaft appears rather to be declining and the Silesians, as is the case with other expellee groups, are more inclined to look to the political parties for advancement of their aims. * See Biographic Appendix. 10 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET D. Conclusions The expellees constitute a substantial section of the Bavarian population. They are represented by able and vigorous leaders who take an active part in both Federal and Land politics. Expellee organizations maintain a unity of national and cultural traditions among the various groups and keep alive their claims to return to the homeland. However, in spite of these factors making for separatism, the expellees appear to be increasingly integrated into the political, economic and social life of the community and less significant as a separate group capable of influencing German policy into extremist courses. 11 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET III.

Varga, the president, from 1946 to 1947, was president of the National Assembly in Hungary and last Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament, and the council is therefore regarded by some as the de facto if not de jure government-in-eXTTe. Its leaders represent most of the trends of traditional Hungarian politics excluding Communists and Nazis and are experienced in Hungarian political, diplomatic, cultural or religious life. Protestant elements dominate the Council but Catholic and Jewish groups are also represented. Sup- ported by Free Europe Committee. As of 1953 the Council was divided into a Right and a Left Bloc, the Left headed by Ferenc Nagy, Zoltan Pfeiffer and Karoly Peyer and the Right by Tibor Eckhardt. The Left appeared to predominate. The Council avoided close contact with the rightist military elements of the emigration, with the exception of Tibor Eckhardt who was a member of the MHBK. Currently efforts are in process to unify the various emigre� factions, although without much hope of succes0. The Councills center of activity is in New York; little information concern- ing the activities or personnel of its Munich branch is available. Hennyey is a former career officer in the Hungarian Army. He was arrested by the Germans after the Szalasi coup. He has been very active in welfare work among Hungarian emigres. He has no known political affil- iation. 2.

Characteristics: MHBK is an outgrowth of World War II Hun- garian resistance and intelligence organi- zation (Kopjes Mozgalom) formed under German supervision. General Zako, then chief of G-2 of the Hungarian General Staff, was responsible for its creation. Leaders and members of the organization fled west before the advancing Soviet armies and surrendered to US forces in Germany and Austria. From 1945 until 1948 Generals Zako and Kisbarnaki-Farkas were interned by the US Army. During this period Zako contacted other military exiles and in 1949 the first manifesto of the MHBK was issued. * Individual has left the organization or there is o his current membership. ** Deceased. 29 SECRET about � (b)(1) (b)(3) (b)(1) (b)(3) Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET Activities of the MHBK include welfare, search for prisoners of war, disseminating information to emigres and collecting information pertaining to Hungary and the emigration (including material losses), cooperation with social and cultural organi- zations and unpolitical emigre movements. Zak() has called his organization unpolitical, however its leadership appears to have a pronounced rightist or fascistic orientation. In the fundamental cleavage in the Hungarian emigration between the \"moderate\" and \"rightist\" elements, the MHBK is ranged against the Hungarian National Council, the principal organization of the more demo- cratic elements. It is however more moder- ate than the extreme neo-Nazis among the emigration, who would prefer to have Gen. Farkas head of the organization. Internal tension and the need for external financial and political support have been a constant threat to Zako's position. In the maneuvering among exile groups he ap- peared to have allied himself with Arch- duke Otto and Admiral Horthy and to have maintained his leadership of the organiza- tion. During the Hungarian uprising, he was reported to have said that the MHBK was making preparations for infiltrating from Austria into Hungary to fight with the Nationalists. He claimed promises of arms supplies from Italy and Spain. Within the framework of the \"Working Com- munity of the German and Hungarian Sol- diers\" established between the MHBK and the German Veterans League, a number of former German generals were named as honorary members of the MHBK. They are: Gottfried Hansen, ex-Admiral, Presidium of the Deutscher Soldatenbund, Bavaria; Otto Stapf, ex-General (infantry), Presidium of the Deutscher Soldatenbund, Bavaria; Hans Friesner, ex-Colonel-General; Rudolf Konrad, ex-General (mountain infantry); Hans Kraner, ex-General (armor).

Affiliated with the ABN and reportedly has contacts with French military circles, especially those sympathetic with De Gaulle. Its link with ABN has made it unpopular with some Hungarian exiles who dislike ABN1s Slav leadership, its use of terroristic methods, and the fact that it appears to favor a dictatorship for the future. Gen. Farkas, about 67 years old, commanded the Sixth Hungarian Army Corps on the Eastern Front during World War II. Later he was in charge of evacuation operations in which capacity he reached Germany and was interned by the Allies.

When the Ukrainian National Republic was reactivated in 1948 in Western Germany it was recognized by practically all political exiles. In 1950 the Council was split by the decision of the organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and Revolutionaries - Bandera group (OUNR) to quit the Council. According to information dated 1955 the Council is made up of Left, Center and Right blocs. The Left bloc consists of four Socialist parties: the Ukrainian Social Democratic Worker's Party (Ukrainska Sotsial Demokratichna Robitnicnya Partia - USDRP); Ukrainian Party of Social Revolu- tionaries (Ukrainska Partia Sotsialistiv Revolyntsioneriv - UPSR); Ukrainian Socialist Radical Party (Ukrainska Sotsial- istichna - Radikalna - Parti - USRP); and the Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party (Ukrainska Revolyntsiino Demokratichan Partia - URDP). After World War II, the first three, which had existed since 1917, united to form the Committee of Ukrainian Socialists (Ukrainski Sotsialistichni Obednannya US0), a single party, also known as the Union of Ukrainian Socialists (SUS). The party follows Kautsky and Bebel rather than Marx. It holds six of the 36 seats in the UN Rada. The fourth party, the URDP, is an exile party founded in Neu Ulm in 1946. It represents the Eastern Ukrainian element of the emi- gration and attempts to preserve some aspects of the Soviet Union political, social, and economic structure and to reconcile them with the objectives of the established emigre parties. Suspicion has been reported that there was Communist influence in establishing the Party. The URDP split in 1947 into Right (Neu Ulm) group and the more socialist Left (\"Vpered\") or Regensburg group. The Center bloc is composed of two parties: the Ukrainian National State Association (Ukrainski Natsionalno Derzhovni Sovuz - INDS) and the United National Democratic Union (Ukrainska Natsionalno Demokratitschne Obedn4nnya - UNDO). Both parties are small, but, because both contain experienced polit- ical leaders, are influential among the emigration. Leader of the UNDS in 1955 3)4 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET was thought to be Mykolo Livitskiy, son of former UNR President Andrei Livitskiy and in 1954 Vice Chairman and Foreign Minister of the UN Rada. In 1950-52 the leaders of the UNDO were reported to be: Dr. Vasyl Mudry; Dr. Stepan Wytwytski, President of the UNR; Stanlo Kalba; Dr. Lubomyr Makarushka, member of the Presidium. The Right bloc consists of the faction of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) headed by Andrei Melnyk (OUNM). Melnykls group is further to the right than that of Bandera with whom he broke in 1940. Its followers stress private prop- erty, private agriculture, artisan manu- facture and trade. OUNM is opposed to Russian emigre parties but participates with other Ukrainian parties in the UN Rada where it holds six seats. In an internal struggle, OUNM at the close of the Third Congress of the Council in 1954 refused to participate in the Executive Committee. The question was finally solved by making Osyp Boydunyk, of the OUNM, chairman of the Presidium of the National Council, a largely honorary figure. In addition there are two peasant parties and a \"Group of Constructive Forces,\" led by Prokupchuk. As of reports dated 1954, their position was not clear but they apparently belonged with the Center group. The largest, the Ukrainian Peas- ant Party, led by Prof. Volodymyr Dolenko, consisting mainly of young emigres from the Eastern Ukraine, appeared to be one of the strongest emigre parties. Principal problem of the Rada is coopera- tion with Russian exile groups as pro- posed by the American Committee for Liberation from Bolshevism. This has been favored by some Council members (Livitskiy, Voskoviynyk, Dovgal) and op- posed by others (OUNM and URDP) who fear that Ukrainian interests would be by- passed in favor of Russian claims. As of 1954, the Rada indicated that it was will- ing to participate in radio propaganda and in the Institute for the Study of Culture and History of the USSR provided it would not be bound by the political proposals of the American Liberation Com- mittee.

Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and Revolutionaries - Bandera (OUNR or OUNB) 22/ Headquarters: Zeppelinstrasse 67, Munich 8 Executive Com- mittee:(1954) Characteristics: Stepan Bandera Jaroslaw Stetzko Stepan Lankawskyj Jaroslaw Bencal Group under the leadership of Stepan Bandera which split from the parent Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) in about 1940. However both groups (OUNR and OUNM, led by Melnyk)advocate permanent revolution against Communist or foreign occupation of the Ukraine. Both are totalitarian in ideology. The OUNR considers itself the sole legitimate party. It desires collabor- ation with other anti-Communist national elements rather than with the Western powers as advocated by OUNM. Bandera and Stetzko founded the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations (ABN) in an attempt to con- tact and influence all Soviet emigres. In 1949 OUNR became a member of the Na- tional Council, but withdrew the follow- ing year. Dissension within the OUNR developed as early as 1943. It involved not only members of OUNR but also members of the foreign representation of the Ukrainian Supreme Council of Liberation (ZP UHVR), a body established in about 1944 to unify and coordinate all Ukrainian liberation forces on a worldwide basis, who dis- approved of Bandera's assumption of absolute power (at the time UHVR was founded, OUNR was announced as its politi- cal arm). The controversy grew until in 1954 a definte schism between Bandera and the ZP UHVR (Rebet-Matla group) divided the emigration. OUNR, at least in Munich, appears to con- trol the Ukrainian Partisan Army (UPA), an organization of military exiles who engaged in partisan activity against the Germans and Russians during World War 36 SECRET Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 , Approved for Release: 2018/08/08 CO2007412 SECRET Publications: Dozbroi (To Arms).

Founded in an effort to construct an instrumentality through which the Ameri- can Committee for the Liberation for Bol- shevism could work with emigre groups, KTsAB split as the result of the dissension over the treatment and future status of the minority groups within the USSR, and in 1953 ACLB terminated its financial sup- port. In September 1954, the Coordinating Center changed its name to KTsONR (Coor- dinating Center for Liberation of the Peoples of Russia) emphasizing the pro- Russian character of the organization.
