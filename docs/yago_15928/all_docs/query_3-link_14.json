        "text": "Kris Jenner is giving an update on the status of her relationship with her ex, Caitlyn Jenner. In a new interview with Robin Roberts for ABC News' special, The Kardashians, Kris said that she and Caitlyn are friends now, though her transition was \"a big shock\" at first.\n\n\"We’re fine. We’re friends. I see her when she’s at a family thing. It’s settled down a lot,\" Kris told Roberts.\n\n\"I think it was a big shock. It’s a scary thing to go through, because you know nothing about it,\" she continued. \"It’s a subject that I never thought I would have to directly deal with, confront, be understanding about something that I didn’t understand.\"\n\nCaitlyn echoed a similar sentiment in a recent appearance on the Full Send podcast, where she called her relationship with her family \"fine.\"\n\n\"My relationship with the family is, you know, fine. I mean, we do things together, my kids, this and that. I just had my 20th grandchild a couple weeks ago and that's my son, Burt, the oldest son,\" she shared.\n\nWhile she admitted that she's closest to daughters Kendall and Kylie, she said that of the Kardashian kids, she has the best relationship with Kim Kardashian.\n\n\"Of course, when you have 10 kids, you have different relationships with all of your children. Obviously, Kendall and Kylie, my flesh and blood, I'm very close to them. On the Kardashian side, I see them here and there, but I'm not really close,\" Caitlyn admitted. \"Kim is probably the closest. My other side, my other kids, my sons, Brandon, Burt, the whole group, they're all there.\"\n\nCaitlyn and Kris split in 2014, but the 72-year-old former Olympian did not publicly announce her transition until 2015.\n\nThough it took time to for the Kar-Jenners to find their new normal, Caitlyn still appeared on Keeping Up With the Kardashians until 2021, and also starred in I Am Cait, which ran for two seasons and highlighted her gender transition.\n\nTheir evolving relationship was documented on TV, and in an April 2021 episode of KUWTK, Kris was seen giving Caitlyn advice on starting her own YouTube channel.\n\n\"I'm just proud of my mom for reaching this place of growth where she can be super cordial with Caitlyn,\" Kim says in the episode. \"Maybe if it's just baby steps, she doesn't have to put the whole thing aside, but she's able to communicate and start that little relationship-building.\"\n\nWhile relationships between Caitlyn, Kris and their kids, appear to be mended, Variety confirmed in their profile on the famous family, that she won't be on their upcoming Hulu reality show, The Kardashians.\n\nCaitlynn retweeted Variety's story shortly after the news broke, writing, \"I was there when this started from day one. I watched it grow. And doing the show for almost 20 seasons was one of the highlights of my life. To be able to work with my family for all those years, connect with the fans, it was incredible. Happy that it continues for my family.\"\n\nIn March 2021, Caitlyn opened up to ET's Nischelle Turner about the end of KUWTK.\n\n\"Over 10 years I did the show. I really enjoyed doing the show. It really brought my family close together,\" she shared. \"We've been through a lot together. I think I have some of the best conversations with my kids on camera. It was a great experience.\""
