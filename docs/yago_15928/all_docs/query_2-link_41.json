        "text": "Fans of the Kardashian clan tend to spend a lot of time obsessing over who Kim, Khloe, Kylie and Kendall are dating – but don’t forget Kris, who has her own exciting love life going on!\n\nJenner has been in a relationship with Corey Gamble since 2014, and the handsome business exec has made regular appearances on reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians (and, later, The Kardashians!)\n\nBut just who is Corey Gamble, and what does he actually do for a living? How did he meet Kris Jenner? Are they secretly married?\n\nLet’s unravel it all – here’s what we know about the celebrity couple who prove that a 25-year age gap is no barrier to falling in love!\n\nWho is Corey Gamble?\n\nCorey Gamble, 43, is the partner of Kris Jenner. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, he is an actor, producer, business executive and talent manager.\n\nHe’s appeared in Keeping Up With The Kardashians, of course, but also made a brief appearance in the 2020 film 2 Minutes of Fame and produced a 2022 short film called Glitter Ain’t Gold.\n\nAfter completing a degree in business management in the late 1990s, he moved to Los Angeles, first becoming a talent manager for Scooter Braun and serving as Justin Bieber’s tour manager in 2014, which is when he met Jenner.\n\n“He’s a really great guy,” a source told E! News in 2014 after the pair started dating. “He’s so nice and a very responsible man. He is very caring about other people and generally just an all-around good guy.”\n\nWith an estimated net fortune of around $20 million, he also loves the luxurious life. Gamble’s Instagram feed is full of pictures of him wearing designer threads, hanging out on yachts and partying with other rich and famous people.\n\nHe and Jenner love to travel, regularly holidaying in spots such as the French Riviera, St Tropez and California’s Napa Valley.\n\nHow did Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble meet?\n\nThe pair met at a birthday party for fashion designer Riccardo Tisci in Ibiza, Spain. At the time, Jenner was in the final throes of divorce from Caitlyn Jenner, to whom she had been married for 22 years.\n\nThe couple hit it off and began dating in August 2014. Gamble’s first appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians was in March 2015.\n\nWhat is the age difference between Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble?\n\nThere is a 25-year age gap between the two – Gamble is 43 (44 in November 2024) and Jenner is 68 (69 in November 2024!)\n\nIn a recent episode of The Kardashians, Jenner opened up about the age gap.\n\n“I used to say to Corey all the time when I first started dating him, like why do you want to date somebody who is older than you?” she revealed.\n\n“I didn’t get the age gap, and then he taught me that age is just a number. It’s a f****** big number, but it’s a number!”\n\nDo Kris Jenner’s daughters like Corey Gamble?\n\nInitially, Jenner’s daughters were bothered by the age gap, with Khloe Kardashian even describing it as “creepy”.\n\nJenner told WSJ Magazine in 2021 that her kids now “loved him”.\n\nGamble moved into Jenner’s mansion in 2022.\n\n“He’s been so amazing moving into the house because he really handles everything,” Jenner said. “There’s so much security. I love that side of him, because he’s always really protective.”\n\nIs Kris Jenner married to Corey Gamble?\n\nNo, Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble aren’t married. Fans love to speculate that the couple are secretly engaged, partially because Jenner was photographed wearing a giant diamond ring on Valentine’s Day in 2023.\n\nBut the couple have no plans to marry, a source told The Daily Mail.\n\n“Kris is not engaged to Corey and she has no plans to be,” the source said. “She really has no need to marry him because she already has exactly what she wants with him right now. Kris does not want to put anything on paper regarding their relationship because she knows that if their relationship does end, God forbid, it would not end well if they were married.”\n\nWhat has Kris Jenner said about Corey Gamble?\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE in 2023, Jenner said Gamble was “super” and “an amazing guy”.\n\n“He’s really supportive and he’s really dialled into a lot of different things,” she said.\n\n“He’s very knowledgeable about a lot of the things that I work on, and he really helps me in trying to think through some of the decisions I make. He’s such a great person to bounce things off of. I really love his point of view on things.”\n\nWhat has Corey Gamble said about Kris Jenner?\n\nGamble’s praise was effusive when he took to Instagram on November 5, 2023, to celebrate Jenner’s 68th birthday.\n\n“Happpppy Birthday my beautiful queen,” he wrote. “Love you through life twice … Keep being the powerful force of love & wisdom that guides the ship that you birthed and built. I’m always proud of you & thankful for u … love you forever birthday girl. Keep shining and being the BEST mother to your 6.”"
