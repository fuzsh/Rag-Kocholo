I'm like, 'That's a little early for me to be...'\"\n\n\"Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid,\" she continued, \"I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I'm 70!\"\n\nKris has applauded her boyfriend during a dialogue with WSJ. Magazine.\n\nShe admitted that Corey is the “greatest guy” for her.\n\n“And he's just an amazing support system for me, and he really gives me a lot of strength and insight.
