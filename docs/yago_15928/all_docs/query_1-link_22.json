        "text": "On a recent episode of The Kardashians, Kris Jenner had fans shocked with a surprising revelation.\n\nShe revealed to a friend that she could possibly marry her longtime boyfriend, Corey Gamble when she turns 70.\n\nDuring the episode, Kris and two friends, Faye Resnick and Kathy Hilton, went on a shopping trip and she dropped the bomb that she would be getting a hysterectomy.\n\nHowever, they assumed that she was going to tell them that she had got hitched.\n\n“I thought you were gonna tell me you’re getting married!” Hilton said. “I thought you were gonna say six in the morning [tomorrow]. I’m like, ‘That’s a little early for me to be…'”\n\nKris responded, “Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid,” Jenner continued. “I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I’m 70!”\n\nFans are speculating about whether wedding bells might actually be in Kris’s future.\n\nBut, the couple have been dating for over 10 years so maybe it is time for them to tie the knot."
