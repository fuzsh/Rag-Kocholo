        "text": "The end of Kris Jenner’s marriage to Caitlyn Jenner is just another element spotlighted by the gold medalist’s debut as a woman.\n\nThe so-called Kardashian momager, who moved to trademark that moniker last week, finalized her divorce from Caitlyn in December, after more than two decades of marriage and more than a year after they announced their separation and that they’d been living apart.\n\nWhen most of the Kardashian children took to social media to hail the arrival of Jenner’s new identity via Vanity Fair on Monday, Kris did not. But she is quoted extensively in Buzz Bissinger’s 22-page profile for the magazine.\n\nThere is much disagreement about what Kris did and didn’t know about Caitlyn’s gender identity during their marriage, and much of that plays out in a discordant back-and-forth in a few sections of the profile.\n\nCaitlyn “just decided, ‘I’m done,’ ” Kris told the magazine, saying that Caitlyn didn’t explain her gender dysphoria until after their divorce was finalized.\n\n“Why would you want to be married and have kids if this is what you wanted since you were a little boy? Why would you not explain this all to me?” she asked rhetorically, adding that the split felt like “the most passive-aggressive thing” she thinks she ever experienced.\n\nKris, still referring to her husband as Bruce and by the male pronoun, said that her then husband was “often angry and upset” with her toward the end of her marriage because of the massive workload that came with building the Kardashian empire.\n\n“He was married to me and he wasn’t who he wanted to be so he was miserable,” she said. Kris added that she never thought of their troubles as the result of a “gender issue.”\n\nKris is credited with rebooting Caitlyn’s career after they wed in 1991, but once her E! series took off in the late 2000s, the dynamics of their marriage and business relationship changed. Kris focused more on the empire she built with her Kardashian children and viewed Caitlyn as less of a “breadwinner,” Caitlyn said.\n\nTheir marriage dissolved because Kris became “less tolerant,” Caitlyn said. Their frequent quibbling played out repeatedly on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”\n\n“I’d get upset, and the whole relationship kind of fizzled,” Caitlyn said, estimating “20% was gender and 80% was the way I was treated” for why they split.\n\nALSO:\n\nVanity Fair cover a ‘masterfully’ handled moment\n\nCaitlyn Jenner’s Vanity Fair reveal rallies family support\n\nCaitlyn Jenner’s courage is bold, Annie Leibovitz’s portrait cliched\n\nFashion critic Booth Moore: For Caitlyn Jenner, an old-school vision of beauty"
