        "text": "Kris Jenner has spoken out about her thoughts on the gender transition of her ex-husband, Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nDespite Caitlyn saying that she had always felt more like a woman, even when she was living as a man called Bruce, little was previously known about how much Kris Jenner knew prior to her transition.\n\nIn the recent interview with Vanity Fair magazine, Kris said that the couple's 22-year relationship came to an end suddenly when her former husband \"just decided 'I'm done.'\"\n\nCaitlyn has expressed her thanks for the support she has received from her daughters and stepdaughters following her transition, but Kris told the magazine that things were harder for her.\n\nShe called the end of her relationship with Caitlyn \"the most passive-aggressive thing I think I've ever experienced.\"\n\nShe added that she wished that Caitlyn had told her about the issue before, saying: \"Why would you want to be married and have kids if this is what you wanted since you were a little boy? Why would you not explain all this to me?\"\n\nHowever, she said that she did know something of Caitlyn's true identity, but that the issue was largely swept under the rug during their marriage.\n\nShe said: \"When I met Bruce, he told me that he had done hormones back in the early 80s.\"\n\n\"This was a conversation that took place in the early 90s. So, what he was telling me happened a decade earlier, and he never really explained it.\"\n\nCaitlyn has previously said that Kris was aware of her hormone treatments and their side effects, but Kris told the magazine, \"there wasn't a gender issue. Nobody mentioned a gender issue.\"\n\nSpeaking on Twitter about the interview, Caitlyn Jenner said: \"Reading the VF article reminded me of the love and good times Kris and I shared for so many years. Wouldn't trade that time for anything!\""
