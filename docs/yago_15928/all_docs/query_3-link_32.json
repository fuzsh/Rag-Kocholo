And, for the record, I know that Dianne Sawyer refers to Jenner as \"him\" in the commercials.....I'm mostly just razzing the OP.

Will I watch? Probably not, but I understand why he feels he needs to do it.\n\nWhether any of us like it or not he and his family make news so if this interview with Diane Sawyer about what is obviously been a struggle for him most of his life will make a positive impact and give others hope that all will be okay, then I don't think it's a bad thing.\n\nDiane Sawyer was the perfect person to do this type of interview and I won't be surprised to hear that it was good.\n\nPost by jayfab on\n\n@iowa57girl said:\n\nI am not a fan of the Kardashian family AT ALL but have followed Bruce Jenner's career long before he married Kris, all the way back to when he was in college here in Iowa at Graceland College and would complete at the Drake Relays prior to his Olympic decathlon win, so I've know who he is since the 70's and I'm going to give him some kudos on what he is doing.

I was trying to write what I was thinking in the other thread and just couldn't put it into words, but you did. Thumbs up.\n\nPost by marimoose on\n\nI don't watch lots of tv so I have missed most of the commercials. I actually was looking up when the show is on tonight because I am interested in hearing his story. I do not watch The Kardashians but remember Bruce Jenner from my youth. I personally think it is a really brave thing for him to do, especially given his high profile identity. Any one, celebrity or not, who undergoes such a change is brave in my book. Until I have walked in their shoes I cannot fully grasp the desire/need to do this but good for those who have the means to follow through. Life is a one time shot and sometimes too short so if this is what will make him happy well yay him.\n\nmarianne - I do feel for you hearing too many commercials. We all have our triggers and that is one of the reasons that I keep the tv off more than on.\n\nPost by eebud on\n\nHaven't we ALL had a sneak peak at tonight's special? And, for the record, I know that Dianne Sawyer refers to Jenner as \"him\" in the commercials.....I'm mostly just razzing the OP. Although really don't think that he should have to announce anything for news outlets to be receptive to another pronoun.\n\nI guess I don't think anyone should be calling him by any other pronoun than the one he has been known as until HE says that he wants to be referred to as something different. As for us all having a sneak peak, I am probably one of the best at tuning out commercials so I really couldn't tell you what they have been covering when they show previews. I usually tune out commercials or change the channel. Lately, it has been a lot of channel changing. So much hockey on so many channels that I don't have time for the Kardashians. LOL\n\nPost by alittleintrepid on\n\neebud , my point is more that when people are trans, it's not their responsibility to announce it and announce their pronoun preferences to the world. That's on all of us. If you ever meet someone trans in real life, don't wait for an announcement....ask them.\n\nPost by eebud on\n\neebud , my point is more that when people are trans, it's not their responsibility to announce it and announce their pronoun preferences to the world. That's on all of us. If you ever meet someone trans in real life, don't wait for an announcement....ask them.\n\nYes, I do have a friend who transitioned. I knew him as a she for many years, since we were kids. He made a very public announcement of his new name and that he was now a He. Actually, he gave us a heads up that it was coming as soon as he legally changed his name in court. Once he legally changed his name, he also changed all of his online profiles, etc. We all knew his new name a few months ahead of time so we could all get used to it.\n\n***ETA Today, I suspect that anyone who meets him probably doesn't know that he spent his first 50 years as a female.\n\nPost by papersilly on\n\nWith all the tabloid stories and rampant speculation out there, I would like to hear what Bruce himself has to say. Gosh knows that family has overrun him all these years. I will be watching it, on DVR of course so I can FF, pause or delete if I want to.\n\nPost by marianne on\n\nI really have no issues at all with whatever gender Mr. Jenner chooses to be, I just wish, as cherrie said, that it wasn't being so exploited and sensationalized as it is. To me it's a very personal matter and not one to be broadcast all over the world in advance. I understand that that's how those folks roll, but still, so many of us really don't care. I wish the man well and hope all goes well in his life. I just don't need to be an unwilling participant, news-wise.\n\nAnd, I agree with what others have said, until he announces what his gender is, I'll continue to refer to him as a he since that's the only way he's presented himself to us.\n\nETA: and, no, I won't be watching or recording. I'll be watching Dateline and recording Blue Bloods.\n\nPost by JBeans on\n\nIs it sensationalized? Yep.\n\nI don't think this is a bad thing. If this announcement gives people, no matter what age, a glimmer of hope or comfort by someone that is doing this in the very public eye, then promote away.\n\nYou might not care, but there is probably someone other than you that feels this important because they identify with the struggle.\n\nSo, oh well.\n\nMaybe this interview will also serve to give some a little education on being transgender and usher in some understanding which I'd say is sorely needed.\n\nGood for Bruce. I hope this interview is the closure he needs to move on with his life.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIs it sensationalized? Yep.\n\nI don't think this is a bad thing.

I'm happy in that if anyone has been unhappy in their lives, and can figure out what the issues are to become more authentic, good for them! But there are other things going on in the world that affect many people and lives that should be talked about before this.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI'm actually interested in the story and I think it's generous of him to share such a private challenge. Im a very private person so I admire people that can just put it all out there with the hope of helping others. This is a very different kind of spotlight than the K girls and their day to day antics and fashion dilemmas.\n\nPost by melanell on\n\nI watch little TV, and I don't see any ads, and yet I have still heard about this interview umpteen times. So I hear where you're coming from, OP.\n\nI hope Bruce is happy, and like others said, if there is a name change or pronoun change needed, then I would find that info useful, but otherwise, I personally don't need or really want any additional info about him or most any other celebrity, really. But man alive, there must be lots of people very interested in daily updates, because I see him all over the internet, magazines, and I hear about him on the radio.\n\nJust to clarify, I'm in no way complaining that there is going to be an interview. I just think they may be over-advertising it.\n\nPost by flanz on\n\nIs it sensationalized? Yep.\n\nI don't think this is a bad thing.
