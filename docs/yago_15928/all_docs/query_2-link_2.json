        "text": "After her high-profile divorce, Kris Jenner found happiness with her boyfriend, Corey Gamble.\n\nJenner, 68, and Gamble, 43, first met at a party in 2014, when the Kardashian family matriarch was in the middle of her split from Caitlyn Jenner. But that didn't stop Gamble from approaching the reality star to introduce himself — and the rest is history.\n\nIt didn't take long for the couple to become inseparable. They were spotted on dinner dates and a trip to Mexico just months after meeting. However, Jenner and Gamble didn't make things Instagram official until 2015.\n\nFrom meeting in Ibiza to jet-setting around the world, here's the complete breakdown of Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble's relationship timeline.\n\nAugust 2014: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble meet for the first time\n\nJenner and Gamble first connected while they were both in Ibiza to attend the 40th birthday party of their mutual friend, fashion designer Riccardo Tisci. Jenner was separated from her then-husband Caitlyn Jenner, and the former couple was in the middle of divorce proceedings. At the time, Gamble was employed by Scooter Braun and was serving as Justin Bieber's tour manager.\n\nEarly October 2014: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble are spotted at dinner together\n\nIn early October, Jenner and Gamble were spotted out to dinner in Sherman Oaks, California, and a fan snapped several photos of them. When a blogger reached out to Gamble to ask about the outing, he said he was looking forward to the relationship taking \"its course on a deeper level.\"\n\nOctober 2014: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble attend Life Is Beautiful music festival together\n\nWhile it's not clear exactly when Jenner and Gamble made their relationship official, they were spotted together while attending the Life Is Beautiful music festival in Las Vegas a few months after meeting. In a photo shared by Kim Kardashian, Jenner and Gamble could be seen standing close together before boarding a private jet to the event. The pair cozied up while watching a set from Kanye West at the festival and later hung out at Kim's 34th birthday party at Tao Las Vegas.\n\nNovember 2014: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble celebrate her 59th birthday with a quick trip to Mexico\n\nAhead of her 59th birthday, Jenner jetted to Mexico with Gamble for a quick getaway. Upon their return to Los Angeles, the rumored couple was spotted showcasing plenty of PDA as they unloaded their suitcases at home. While they still hadn't confirmed their relationship status, Jenner did spend her big day on Nov. 5 with Gamble by her side, including dinner at Stack and a night out at 1 OAK in Las Vegas.\n\nMarch 22, 2015: Corey Gamble makes his debut on Keeping Up with the Kardashians\n\nIn March, Gamble made his debut on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in a big way. Not only did Jenner's daughters discuss their mom's new relationship, but they also shared a little bit of TMI about the couple. Kim, who was living with Jenner at the time, revealed she overheard the duo getting intimate, and complained about the \"banging\" and \"moaning\" sounds she heard when Gamble stayed over. The sisters also expressed concern about the couple's \"creepy\" age difference and that Jenner might be rushing into things.\n\n\"I'm worried about Mom a little bit. She doesn't listen to me when I'm like, 'You know, you should really take it slow' … I just hope that my mom really thinks things through because I don't want her to rush into anything,\" Kim said during the episode.\n\nMeanwhile, Jenner thought her daughter's concerns were without warrant, saying, \"I can't do anything without getting criticized. It's uncomfortable. It's like everybody wants answers, everybody wants to know what the title is. It's like you're a bunch of haters… I don't think I would ever get married again… We'll see. I don't have a crystal ball.\"\n\nApril 23, 2015: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble make things Instagram official with the help of Billy Ray Cyrus\n\nFriends and family got some clarity about Jenner and Gamble's relationship when they made things Instagram official in April with a photo from a double date with Billy Ray Cyrus and his then-wife Tish.\n\n\"Good time... Goood food... @billyraycyrus @tishcyrus@krisjenner,\" Gamble wrote on his Instagram.\n\nOct. 15, 2015: Kris Jenner gets a little too candid about her sex life with her daughter\n\nDuring the season 10 finale of KUWTK, Jenner reflected on a recent trip she had taken with Gamble — and basically called him her boyfriend. Later in the episode, she spoke about the couple's sex life, which visibly disgusted Khloé Kardashian. \"I literally probably have too much sex. I'm exhausted,\" Jenner said during the episode.\n\nMay 2, 2016: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble make their red carpet debut at the Met Gala\n\nIn May, the couple made their red carpet debut at one of the biggest events of the year: the Met Gala. Jenner and Gamble went for all-black attire for their big night out at the exclusive affair.\n\nOct. 23, 2017: Kim Kardashian sparks split rumors between Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble\n\nKim Kardashian briefly had fans thinking that Jenner and Gamble had split after sharing a photo of her mom and writing, \"Caption this.... mine is SWF,\" which stands for Single White Female. Shortly after, Kardashian seemed to have realized what her caption was stirring up, and removed \"SWF\" from her note.\n\nJanuary 2018: Khloé Kardashian expresses concern about Kris Jenner's relationship with Corey Gamble on KUWTK\n\nWhile all of the Kardashian sisters initially were skeptical about their mom's relationship with Gamble, Khloé still remained on the fence several years into the partnership. During an episode of KUWTK that aired in January 2018, Khloé asked Gamble why he was often standoffish with her, saying that she wanted to be \"comfortable\" with their relationship.\n\n\"I like all of y'all, but y'all are girls. I'm a dude and I know how that s--- can go,\" Gamble explained. \"I'm a young dude dating your mom. Y'all are not really my f---ing kids. We are technically peers,\" he said on the show.\n\nJuly 2018: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble take a romantic vacation\n\nDespite the tension between Gamble and Jenner's daughter, the couple moved forward with their relationship and headed on vacation to the South of France. The duo docked their yacht off the coast of Antibes on the French Riviera and were seen holding hands during outings in the town.\n\nAugust 2018: Kris Jenner begins wearing a diamond on her ring finger\n\nNot long after their French vacation, Jenner sparked engagement rumors when she was spotted wearing a large diamond on her ring finger. The reality star didn't do much to dispel the gossip when she was asked about it on The Late Late Show With James Corden. When the host mentioned the ring during a game of Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts, Jenner chose to eat a cricket instead of answering any questions.\n\nSoon after, Jenner revealed she had no plans to marry again in the future. During an appearance on celebrity lawyer Laura Wasser's podcast, Divorce Sucks with Laura Wasser, Jenner explained that she felt she had already done \"the big wedding\" and didn't see a need to do it again.\n\n\"You know, you never say never, but I often say it's just not what I think I need to do again based on my past,\" he said. \"I'm in a really great relationship right now, and I'm happy and I don't want to mess that up…I don't have the need to put on a long, white dress and walk down an aisle. I've done that. I've had the big wedding, I've had the babies and the kids…I think that I just feel really grateful and blessed for my past experiences and I'm looking forward to my future and I just don't think that I want to go there.\"\n\nNov. 5, 2018: Corey Gamble hosts a birthday party for Kris Jenner\n\nIn celebration of Jenner's 63rd birthday, Gamble organized a day full of surprises for his girlfriend, which started with a ride on pal Tommy Hilfiger's private jet. After having a slice of cake at 35,000 feet, the couple later spent the evening with friends and family.\n\n\"Thank you @coreygamble for all of the birthday love and surprises!!!! #amazingday #memories #happybirthday,\" Jenner wrote on Instagram.\n\nMay 26, 2019: Kanye West questions Corey Gamble's relationship with the Kardashians\n\nJenner and Gamble found themselves in the middle of some family drama when Kanye West confronted Gamble about his guarded nature during an episode of KUWTK. Recounting the events, Kim explained that West had bluntly asked Gamble why the Kardashian-Jenner clan had yet to meet his family.\n\nWhile Kim didn't approve of West's delivery, she did understand his sentiment, considering how private Gamble had been since he started dating Jenner. Khloé Kardashian agreed with West — and tensions hit an all-time high during a family trip to Palm Springs. During the episode, Jenner confronted Khloé about her attitude towards Gamble.\n\n\"Nobody really slows down enough to take a look at it from a bird's eye view of my life. I want you to recognize that when you do question my relationship with Corey, it isn't okay and it hurts feelings. I think what you guys don't realize is Corey is really taking care of me like no one ever has in my entire life,\" Jenner said.\n\nKhloé later apologized, telling her mom that she wanted her \"to be happy\" and didn't care who she dated as long as they were good to her.\n\nThat same month, Jenner and Gamble returned to the Met Gala, where they posed on the famous steps alongside Kim, West, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott, proving they had all moved on from the drama.\n\nJanuary 2020: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble Adopt a Puppy Together\n\nIn early 2020, Jenner and Gamble added to their family when they adopted a tiny puppy from The Wagmor Pet Hotel & Spa in Los Angeles. The couple named the caramel-colored pup Bridgette, who happened to come from the same litter as Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's puppy Petey. And while Jenner was very excited about the new puppy, Gamble later joked that he was the one who did all of the work.\n\n\"Kris is the one that wanted a dog, but I'm doing like, 99.7 percent of all dog duties. So what I think I've got to do now, is all the attention that I used to give Kris, I've got to just give it all to Bridgette. Maybe this could actually get her attention and she'll start giving me a little support and help on the parenting side,\" Corey later said on KUWTK.\n\nMay 23, 2020: Kris Jenner opens up about her sex life with Corey Gamble … again\n\nSeveral years after Jenner first dished on her sex life with Gamble, she shared that things were still hot and heavy while chatting with her best friend Faye Resnick. In the KUWTK bonus scene, Jenner joked that something must be wrong \"because I'm always in the mood... Corey is like a walking, talking Luther Vandross song. He is so sexy always and all I want to do is like, cue the music,\" Jenner admitted.\n\nMarch 23, 2021: Kris Jenner calls Corey Gamble her \"support system\"\n\nIn early 2021, Jenner was still going strong with Gamble, speaking about him in an interview with WSJ. Magazine. When asked about their relationship, Jenner said that Gamble was an incredible support system who was loved by the rest of her family.\n\n\"He's the greatest guy, and he's just an amazing support system for me, and he really gives me a lot of strength and insight. He's a great sounding board. And he loves my kids and my mom, and they love him,\" Jenner shared.\n\nFeb. 14, 2022: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble host Valentine's Day dinner for their friends\n\nOn Valentine's Day, Jenner and Gamble hosted a love-filled dinner with friends including Lori Loughlin, Tammy Hughes Gustavson, and Kym Douglas, who had recently lost her husband. In a now-deleted Instagram post, Douglas wrote that her friends didn't want her to be alone on the holiday so they decided to host the super sweet evening.\n\nJuly 15, 2022: Kris Jenner shares how Corey Gamble supports her career\n\nWhile speaking to PEOPLE recently about the launch of her new personal branding MasterClass, Jenner opened up about how her longtime boyfriend has helped her along her career journey.\n\n\"I think Corey is super. He's an amazing guy,\" she said. \"He's really supportive and he's really dialed into a lot of the different things.\"\n\n\"He's very knowledgeable about a lot of the things that I work on, and he really helps me in trying to think through some of the decisions I make,\" she explained. \"He's such a great person to bounce things off of. I really love his point of view on things.\"\n\nShe also noted that Gamble is \"a people person.\" \"Corey's really great with people and helping me navigate such a huge team and all the things that are happening,\" she said. \"Everybody needs somebody to sort of run something by and help make decisions about the littlest things. It could be a travel, or it could be what you're doing that evening, or it could be what's going on at the office today. But it's really great to have him.\"\n\nSeptember 8, 2022: Kris Jenner calls Corey Gamble \"husband material\"\n\nDuring an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Jenner voluntarily took a lie detector test.\n\nWhen Corden asked the reality star, \"Is Corey husband material?\" she answered: \"Yes, he is. He's the best.\" Jenner was telling the truth, according to the lie detector.\n\n\"Thank God,\" she added. \"I'm sweating.\"\n\nOctober 13, 2022: Corey Gamble supports Kris Jenner while reviewing MRI scans of her hip\n\nIn an episode of The Kardashians, Gamble supported Jenner as she visited an orthopedic surgeon to examine her right hip.\n\nAfter reviewing MRI scans from the doctor, with Gamble by her side, Jenner was told she'd need hip replacement surgery. \"Hearing the doctor say that I need a hip replacement is very scary for me,\" the reality star said. \"It reminds me of somebody older than I feel on the inside and somebody who is going to have challenges for the rest of her life. This is serious.\"\n\nNovember 18, 2022: Kris Jenner reveals her first holiday card with Corey Gamble\n\nJenner showed off her 2022 holiday card on Instagram, which featured a portrait of her and Gamble standing side by side. \"Happy holidays,\" and \"xoxo, Kris and Corey\" were written in delicate gold lettering.\n\n\"You guys know I LIVE for the holidays!
