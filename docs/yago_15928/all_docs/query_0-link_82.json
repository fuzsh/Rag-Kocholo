        "text": "Kris and Bruce Jenner announce their separation\n\nGossip sites have been abuzz with rumors about the state of Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom's marriage, but it seems that another relationship was going under at the same time.\n\nKardashian matriarch Kris Jenner and husband Bruce Jenner announced their separation this afternoon.\n\n\"We are living separately and we are much happier this way,\" the couple tells E!, home to their family's many reality shows. \"But we will always have much love and respect for each other. Even though we are separated, we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our number one priority.\"\n\nKris also spoke to Us Weekly, revealing that they kept the separation under wraps for a year and reiterating that there's no bitterness between the two.\n\n\"There is no animosity. We are united and committed to our family. ... We ended a marriage, but that's not the end of our friendship. I will always love him, but we are no longer a couple in that way.\"\n\nThe couple celebrated their 22nd wedding anniversary this spring and have laughed off reports of marital strife in the past.\n\nThe Jenners have two teen daughters together -- Kylie and Kendall -- and Kris is also mother to reality stars Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian."
