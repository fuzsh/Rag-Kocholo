        "text": "It's been seven years since Kris and Caitlyn Jenner were officially divorced - and a lot has happened since then.\n\nThe former couple were together for 23 years, but after announcing they were separating in October 2013 and ended their marital union in March 2015.\n\nIn a joint statement, they confirmed they were separated but insisted they would \"always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our number one priority.\"\n\nAs well as sharing two daughters together, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Caitlyn has also been close to Kris' kids from her marriage to Robert Kardashian - Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Rob.\n\nCaitlyn, who has kids Burt, Casey, Brandon and Brody from her previous marriages, then announced to the world that she was transgender in a powerful interview with Diane Sawyer in April 2015.\n\nAt first there was nothing but positivity from Kris and the Kardashian clan, but this came to an abrupt end after Caitlyn made some shocking claims in a series of explosive interviews.\n\nGet the news you want straight to your inbox. Sign up for a Mirror newsletter here .\n\nCait showed off her stunning new look on the front cover of Vanity Fair in June 2015, but it was the accompanying comments about ex Kris that did not go down well with the Kardashian clan.\n\n\"I think in a lot of ways she became less tolerant of me. Then I'd get upset, and the whole relationship kind of fizzled,\" explained Caitlyn.\n\nShe accused Kris of making her feel \"weak and inferior\" and claimed she knew all about her desire to be a woman - something Kris vehemently denies.\n\nAccording to Kris, \"there wasn't a gender issues, nobody mentioned a gender issues.\"\n\nBut Caitlyn claimed she was a \"solid B cup\" when they met after a previous, aborted transition and said she even dressed up in front of her wife.\n\nFurious Kris was seen clearly upset during an October 2015 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians as she reacted to Caitlyn's claims.\n\n\"He can go f*** himself. I honestly wish I never met this man. I mean, just f*** you, Bruce,\" she yelled down the phone to Kim.\n\nKim and Khloe had very public spats with Caitlyn, but Kim eventually thawed at the apparent behest of her husband Kayne West.\n\nShe tried to remain \"neutral\" by helping Caitlyn get ready for the ESPY Awards in July 2016, but when Kris found out she was devastated.\n\n\"I want loyalty. I don't want f***ing neutral. I'm trying to be as gracious as I can, I'm trying to be as understanding as I can. I'm betrayed. I've been f***ed over on so many levels that your head would spin,\" the matriarch fumed.\n\nAnd just when it looked as though the familial animosity was at an all-time high, Caitlyn released her tell all book, The Secrets Of My Life.\n\nShe once again went in on Kris and shared intimate details of their \"uncomfortable\" sex life.\n\n\"I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her. This will always be a subject of dispute between us,” Caitlyn wrote, claiming she kept her female clothes in a locked closet with Kris' permission.\n\nA prolonged estrangement followed with Kim, Kourtney and Khloe refusing to speak to Caitlyn.\n\nKris said: \"I really tried hard to improve the relationship and spend a little bit of time, thinking maybe there's something here that I'm not seeing.\n\n\"I’ve done nothing but open up my home, and my heart, to a person who doesn't give a s***. So, I'm done.\"\n\nBut their seems to have been a rebuilding of the relationship in recent years, with Kris Claiming they were back on track during an interview last April.\n\nOpening up about what their relationship is like at this moment in time, Kris told WSJ Magazine : \"I think it's very respectful,\" Kris said of their current relationship. \"She's the father of two of my kids, and so that speaks volumes.\"\n\nSpeaking about Caitlyn's transition, Kris admitted it was a \"shock\" when the family found out that her ex was set to go through with it.\n\n\"I think one of the most interesting things that we all learned was that none of us had been through anything like that before in a million years,\" Kris said.\n\n\"And we didn't know how to process that — and it was a process, it was a shock, and then it was a reality, and it was something that we had to absorb and try to wrap our heads around and learn about.\"\n\nWhile Kris described her connection with Caitlyn as \"very respectful\" she says that she perhaps didn't handle her ex's transition correctly at the time.\n\nShe added: \"I'm the kids' mom, so trying to navigate that was hard because I wanted to be the best parent I could be and do the right thing and I didn't always know what that meant in that situation.\"\n\nHowever, the mood made have soured after Caitlyn starting dishing the dirt on Big Brother VIP in Australia.\n\nDuring her time Down Under at the end of last year, Caitlyn dropped the bombshell claim that Kris forced her to get married in 1991 after just five-and-a-half months of dating.\n\nSpeaking to the rest of the housemate, Caitlyn explained that it was tricky blending together their children so was hesitant to make Kris into Mrs Jenner.\n\n\"We blended eight kids together and that wasn’t easy. We were together for 23 years,\" Caitlyn shared.\n\n\"Kris and I from meeting to getting married was only 5.5 months. She decided we should get married but I didn’t want to because there were too many kids involved, especially on her side and they were all very young at that time.\n\n\"I respected their father, and if we are doing this, I’m not staying at your house, I’m not standing there, I’m not doing any of that. A few months later we got married and that was the beginning of it right there.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share? Emailwebfeatures@trinitymirror.com"
