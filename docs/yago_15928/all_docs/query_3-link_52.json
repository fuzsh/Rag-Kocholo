        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner, earlier known as Bruce Jenner, is an Olympic gold medalist in decathlon. The 72-year-old has a persona that many fail to adapt. Nevertheless, Jenner had her own share of struggles and obstacles that stopped her from presenting her authentic self to the world.\n\nFinally, after her divorce from Kris, the athlete revealed her original gender identity in April 2015. The name Caitlyn Jenner came into existence soon after she came out as a transgender. But is it possible that Kris was aware of Caitlyn’s reality?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIn 2017, Caitlyn released her memoir which revealed many of her secrets. Notably, she also included that her ex-wife, Kris, knew about her gender issues for a long time.\n\nDid Kris know about Jenner’s reality?\n\nCaitlyn Jenner is not just a former excellent athlete, but also an activist. Apart from the Olympics, the decathlete has shown her interest in films, television, and magazines. To no surprise, Jenner is a storehouse of secrets she pinned down in her memoir five years ago. She named it ‘The Secrets of My Life.’ It’s a 320-page chronicle that involves some of the biggest secrets of her life.\n\nAlthough the star couple shared a peaceful relationship, there were inevitable problems that forced them to split up. After 24 years of marriage, Kris and Caitlyn signed the divorce paper, and it was not related to the athlete’s gender.\n\nWhat’s surprising is the statement she wrote about her ex-wife in the memoir. According to Caitlyn, Kris was aware of her gender issues for a long time. “I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her,” wrote the Olympic champion. “This will always be a subject of dispute between Kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues.”\n\nREAD MORE: “Media Focuses on the Ruins of the World”: Caitlyn Jenner Slammed ‘Disrespectful’ Olympian Who Snubbed the American National Anthem in 2021\n\nKris and Jenner have different opinions on this controversy, and hence, what’s true and what’s false is hard to discover in this case.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner and Kris Jenner’s disagreement\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nCaitlyn is certain that Kris knew the reality, while on the other hand, Kris didn’t even take a second to deny that. At that time, the athlete was struggling with several issues related to her gender.\n\n“She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn,” Caitlyn mentioned. “I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did because I did it several times in front of her after we were married.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch This Story: Caitlyn Jenner roasts daughter Kendall’s partner Devin Booker after he “blew it” vs Luka Doncic’s: “too bad the suns lost”\n\nJenner’s memoir created a huge conflict between the two soon after it was launched.
