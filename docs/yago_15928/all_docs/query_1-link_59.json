        "text": "Kris Jenner is opening up about her health.\n\nThe reality star shared plans to have her ovaries surgically removed after she was diagnosed with a tumor on one of the organs.\n\n“I went to the doctor and I had my scan,\" she tearfully told daughters Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kendall Jenner on the July 4 episode of The Kardashians. \"They found a cyst.”\n\nKris continued, \"They said I gotta have my ovaries taken out.\"\n\nWhile the 68-year-old—who is also mom to kids Kourtney Kardashian, Rob Kardashian and Kylie Jenner—wasn't nervous about the procedure, she did feel very emotional over having to part with her ovaries because, as she put it, \"that’s where all my kids were conceived.\"\n\n\"It’s also a thing about getting older,\" Kris noted. \"It’s a sign of 'we’re done with this part of your life.' It’s a whole chapter that’s just closed.”"
