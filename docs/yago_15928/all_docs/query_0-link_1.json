        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner has revealed the broken state of her relationship with ex-wife Kris Jenner.\n\nDuring an interview on UK daytime show, “This Morning on Wednesday,” Caitlyn said the state of their relationship is “really sad.”\n\n“Kris, I really never talk to anymore,” she said. “If there’s any communication, my manager kind of talks to her.”\n\nCaitlyn, 73, was married to Kris, 67, for 22 years from 1991 to 2015 (back when Caitlyn was former Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner, before Caitlyn came out as trans in 2015). They had two kids together: Kylie, 26, and Kendall, 27, before they divorced.\n\nThey’ve been separated since 2013. At the time, they released a joint statement. “We are living separately and we are much happier this way, but we will always have much love and respect for each other,” their statement read at the time. “Even though we are separated, we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our number one priority.”\n\nIn her “This Morning” interview, Caitlyn reflected on her first meeting with Kris, before she transitioned.\n\n“I had been single for six years, and really kind of struggling with myself and who I was and how I fit into the world,” she admitted.\n\n“I was just turning 40 and met Kris on a blind date, we hit it off from day one. Was it love at first sight? Pretty close to that, yes. I was totally impressed with her and how she lived her life — she had four kids, I had four kids… and we got married five and a half months later. It was very quick.”\n\nThese days, Caitlyn said that she is closer to Kendall and Kylie than she is to the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner family, which includes her step-children, Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Rob.\n\n“When you have as many kids as I have, you’re closer to some than you are to others… I certainly see them and we do this and that,” said Caitlyn.\n\n“I’m much closer to the Jenner side, but Kris, I don’t really have any more contact with her. It’s kind of sad because we went through a lot.”\n\nCaitlyn and the Kardashian family have been feuding for many years, ever since Caitlyn told Diane Sawyer on “20/20” that she identified as a woman. This was reportedly the first time that Kris and the family heard Caitlyn say she was transgender.\n\nWhen Caitlyn introduced herself as a woman on the cover of Vanity Fair that same year, the family also reportedly didn’t know about that ahead of time. In the story, Caitlyn said about Kris, “A lot of times she wasn’t very nice. People would see how I got mistreated. She controlled the money … all that kind of stuff.”\n\nIn 2016, Khloe talked about it on Howard Stern, and said she was upset about being kept in the dark.\n\nIn the Season 12 premiere of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” an upset Caitlyn called Kris to complain about Khloe “talking s–t” in her Stern interview.\n\nCaitlyn appeared on “This Morning” to promote the release of her three-part tell-all series “House Of Kardashian,” which premieres Sunday, Oct. 8 on the U.K.’s Sky documentaries and streaming service NOW.\n\nUnlike “Keeping Up the the Kardashians,” or Hulu’s ongoing “The Kardashians,” the family doesn’t have editorial control over this docuseries.\n\nIn a trailer for “House of Kardashian,” Caitlyn says, “Kimberly calculated from the beginning, ‘How do I become famous?'”\n\n“I was happy to participate in the interview process to share my side which points to the strength, influence, and prowess my family has in captivating the world’s attention and keeping it over the years,” Caitlyn said in a statement about the series."
