        "text": "Who is Corey Gamble? Kris Jenner's boyfriend and member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan has been making headlines and taking centre stage for a while now, in Keeping Up With The Kardashians and The Kardashians. Here's what you need to know about him.\n\nKeeping Up With The Kardashians sadly came to an end in 2021 after hundreds of seasons (well, not quite) and a lot of drama. But that doesn't mean we're not still fully invested in each and every member of the Kardashian-Jenner family. With Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian's baby boy aside, one of the newer (new within the context of Scott Disick and the like) members of America's first family is of course Kris Jenner's boyfriend, Corey Gamble.\n\nSo, if you want to get clued up on Corey, here's everything you need to know...\n\nWho is Corey Gamble?\n\nCorey Gamble is a business executive and talent manager - and he's probably best known for being Kris Jenner's boyfriend of roughly nine years, after they met and got together in 2014. He has regularly appeared on episodes of KUWTK and on red carpets with Kris, as well as more recently on episodes of The Kardashians, which airs on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCorey is originally from Atlanta, Georgia, where he studied business marketing at Morehouse College in Atlanta, but he now lives in LA with Kris.\n\nHe's 43 years old and was born on 10th November 1980 - making him exactly the same age as Kris' second eldest daughter, Kim Kardashian.\n\nIt also means there's a 25-year age gap between Corey and Kris, but their birthdays are only five days apart making them both Scorpios (which is important, obviously). Kris is 68, and her birthday is 5th November 1955.\n\nWhen did Corey and Kris start dating?\n\nCorey and Kris met all the way back in August 2014 at a birthday party for fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th thrown by Kim's ex Kanye West in Ibiza. It wasn't long before Corey started cropping up in Kris's snaps after the event and these two have been pretty much inseparable ever since.\n\nCorey is reported to have previously dated Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan for three years. Meanwhile, Kris was in the midst of divorce proceedings following her split from Caitlyn Jenner at the time the couple met.\n\nIt's unclear when Corey and Kris actually made things official after meeting, but by October 2014 Corey had joined the family on a trip to Las Vegas for Kim Kardashian's birthday - so it's thought that the pair were dating by this point.\n\nFast-forward to April 2015 and the couple became Instagram-official while on a double date with Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus. Slightly random but, hey, we love a famous friendship.\n\nDespite some minor breakup rumours starting in 2017, it was later rumoured that the couple were engaged when Kris appeared on The Late Late Show in August 2018 sporting a massive ring. However, Kris opted to eat a cricket instead of confirming or denying an engagement to Corey.\n\nWhether they were *actually* engaged, are engaged, called the engagement off, we're not entirely sure. Since then, they've been seeming pretty loved up, appearing on the Met Gala red carpet together, and exchanging adorable birthday wishes to one another on their respective Instagrams. Cute!\n\nTo celebrate Kris's birthday in November 2023, Corey took to Instagram with a caption which read, \"Happpppy Birthday my beautiful queen. Love you through life twice …..Keep being the powerful force of love & wisdom that guides the ship that you birthed and built… I’m always proud of you & thankful for u…. love you forever birthday girl. Keep shining and being the BEST mother to your 6.\"\n\nDid Corey work with Justin Bieber?\n\nCorey is reportedly currently working as a talent manager for SB Projects, the entertainment company owned by media exec Scooter Braun, which represents Justin Bieber (and Kanye too, FYI).\n\nCorey is thought to have been working as Justin Bieber's tour manager when he first met Kris, according to PEOPLE, and the pair seem to be close pals, with Corey even referring to Justin as his \"nephew\".\n\nHas there been drama between Corey and the Kardashians-Jenners?\n\nThe Kardashians are no strangers to drama, and Corey has been involved in a number of arguments aired on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nFirstly, in May 2019 it was revealed during an episode that Kanye had texted Corey asking why none of the Kardashian-Jenners had met his family, with Khloe adding, \"we tried to get to know him, but he has not been receptive in this whole thing,\" before later apologising.\n\nLast year, following a fight between Kendall and Kylie, Kendall accused Corey of siding with Kylie and telling her to \"f**k off\". Later, after Kendall confronted Corey, he replied telling her, \"You've been a rude person for years. You're an a**hole when you feel like it, you get riled up for no reason. I'm about to tell you the truth about how you are. You don't apologise for nothing,\" - but it's unclear if Corey and Kendall have patched things up.\n\nOne Jenner Corey is definitely besties with? Kylie (see below).\n\nCorey also had a fall out with Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick over how to discipline their daughter Penelope, which also aired on KUWTK. When Penelope scratched a nanny, Corey reacted by saying, \"If P scratch me, I’m whipping her ass,\" later adding, \"Give her a spanking for sure.\"\n\nOf course, Kourtney and Scott weren't happy with the comments and the situation turned into a huge argument, with Kourtney saying, \"He [Corey] will never be with my kids alone and if he does that in front of any of us there will be a f*cking issue!\"\n\nHowever, despite whatever has been said between Corey and members of the Kardashian-Jenner family in the past, they certainly seem to have been getting on in recent months.\n\nCorey accompanied the family to a private island in Tahiti for Kim Kardashian's 40th birthday party, where he took part in a dance-off with Tristan Thompson, which ended with Corey doing the SPLITS. Yep, we were amazed - and Corey definitely seems to be the life of the party.\n\nMore recently, in an October 2023 episode of The Kardashians, Kris commented on how Corey and Kendall had been hanging out on holiday, which was a welcome surprise following their earlier feud. Kris says to Kim, “I think hell froze over because Corey and Kendall are chatting.”\n\nIn confessional, Kendall commented, \"Corey and I, we were close for a while and then Kylie and I had a big sister fight and he tried to intervene and that caused a little problem between us. We apologised and we got over it but it never really…it just kind of stayed here.\n\n\"I think sometimes that’s what makes these family trips really important. It gives Corey and I the opportunity to slow down and actually spend some together.\"\n\nWhat have the Kardashian-Jenners said about Corey?\n\nDuring her Saturday Night Live opening monologue in October 2021, Kim took the opportunity to shade Corey with a sliiightly cheeky joke. \"Basically, I'm just so much more than that reference photo my sisters showed their plastic surgeon,\" she quipped.\n\n\"But the one thing I'm really proud of is that no one could ever call me a gold digger. Honestly I'm not even sure how you become one. So I asked my mum's boyfriend Corey.\"\n\nOuch.\n\nWhat has Kris Jenner said about Corey?\n\nWishing Corey a happy birthday in November 2021, Kris shared a series of photos of the pair together along with the caption, \"Happy birthday to my love @coreygamble !! You are the most amazing partner, best friend, confidant, travel aficionado, therapist, problem solver, golf buddy, protector, advisor, and the best, most wonderful man to my kids and my grandkids!!!\n\n\"You are such a special part of my heart and soul and I love you so very much babe… thank you for all you are in my life!! I am truly blessed …. ❤️🙏😍🥰\"\n\nAre Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble secretly married?\n\nOne rumour that won't seem to let up, is the one about Corey and Kris being secretly married. The speculation goes right back to 2018, in the aforementioned chat show appearance with James Corden, where Kris wouldn't confirm or deny the rumour. However, things really died down after that and we didn't hear much about the rumour until 2022.\n\nWell, when this rumour came back it really came back. In April 2022 several clips of Kris form The Kardashians showed her wearing a huge yellow stone on her left ring finger, prompting speculation from fans that the couple were either engaged or even secretly married.\n\nThe rumour only gained traction when, in an episode of the new show Khloé confronted her mum about the whole thing, saying she had heard from \"four different people\" that they had got married in secret.\n\n\"You think I’m gonna get married and not have a big ass party?\" Kris tells her daughter, but Khloé (like us, tbh) is not convinced."
