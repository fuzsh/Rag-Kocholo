        "text": "Kris Jenner is sharing some scary news with several of her kids on next week's episode of The Kardashians. In a preview clip for the upcoming week, Kris gathers her daughters — Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kendall Jenner — and her boyfriend, Corey Gamble, at a table while they are on their trip in Aspen, Colorado.\n\nThe 68-year-old Kardashian-Jenner family matriarch looks emotional as she tells her kids, \"I wanted to tell you guys something. I had my scan and this just makes me really emotional, but they found something.\"\n\nEagle-eyed fans will notice that a different part of this clip aired in the season 5 original trailer, sharing Kris' news.\n\n\"I had my scan. They found a cyst and, like, a little tumor,\" the momager says, wiping away tears as her kids look concerned.\n\nThe family took the trip to Aspen this past January. Kylie Jenner backed out at the last minute, and Kourtney Kardashian was home with her newborn son, Rocky, at the time. Kris has not publicly spoken about a diagnosis, but the aftermath will likely play out on the remainder of the season.\n\nIf Kris does have cancer, she will not be the first member of the family to experience it. Her own mother, Mary Jo Campbell, MJ, is a breast cancer survivor. And in 2022, Khloé went public with her skin cancer diagnosis, showing where the cancer had to surgically be removed from her face.\n\nDespite her medical struggles, Kris has no plans to hang up her momager purse anytime soon. In May, she told British host and friend James Corden that she has no plans to retire.\n\n\"My mom retired when she was 82 and she talks about her job every single day when we're together and she will say to me, 'Oh, my job kept me young and with purpose and with joy,'\" she said on SiriusXM's This Life of Mine With James Corden.\n\nNew episodes of The Kardashians stream Thursdays on Hulu."
