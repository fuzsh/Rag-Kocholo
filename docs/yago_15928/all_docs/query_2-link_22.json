        "text": "Is there a new Kris Jenner marriage on the horizon?\n\nDecades ago, the way that things ended for Kris and Robert Kardashian could have been better. Her marriage to Caitlyn Jenner ended nearly a decade ago.\n\nKris has not remarried. Meanwhile, her daughter, Kim, who is newly divorced, remains unmarried. And Kendall, the lone childfree adult of the family, has never married.\n\nIs any of that going to change in the near future?\n\nIs Kris Jenner planning a new marriage?\n\nKris Jenner attended the Foundation for AIDS Research Palm Beach fundraiser on Saturday, March 2.\n\nHer longtime boyfriend, Corey Gamble, was there by her side.\n\nEven so, Kris Jenner spoke to People to clarify that she — and daughters Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian — currently “have no marriage plans — yet.”\n\nAccording to the famous momager, she and this particular pair of single daughters aren’t eager to shake things up.\n\nNot when the current situation is working.\n\n“All of us are having fun,” Kris characterized.\n\nIn 2018, Kris Jenner spoke to Laura Wasser on the celebrity divorce attorney’s then-new Divorce Sucks! podcast.\n\n“You know you never say never, but I often say it’s just not what I think I need to do again based on my past,” she remarked at the time.\n\nKris married Robert Sr. in 1978, only divorcing in 1991 after welcoming four children. Kris married Caitlyn Jenner in 1991, decades before the latter’s transition, before the two formally divorced in 2015.\n\nKendall is currently 28. For an American Millennial, this is a very normal age at which to have never married and to remain childfree.\n\nReportedly, she is currently dating athlete Devin Booker. Previously, the two dated from 2020 until 2022.\n\nIn 2023, Kendall was dating Bad Bunny, but the two sent their separate ways in December of that year.\n\nWho is Kim Kardashian dating?\n\nThese days, rumors have connected Kim Kardashian to a number of famous men.\n\nThe most recent is Odell Bekham Jr. Reports had them spending time together as far back as September 2023.\n\nMore recently, in February 2024, the two attended a pre-Super Bowl party. That’s not quite confirmation that there’s an entanglement, but Kim’s fans are eager to connect those dots.\n\nHowever, in the wake of Kim’s painful divorce from notorious antisemite Kanye West, fans can understand why she’s not in any rush to remarry.\n\nKim needs someone who understands her, who understands her lifestyle, and who won’t run unhinged vanity political campaigns that involve unmedicated on-stage meltdowns or outspoken bigotry.\n\nAlso, as Kris Jenner says, the girls are having plenty of fun without marriage in the picture. Why change it now?"
