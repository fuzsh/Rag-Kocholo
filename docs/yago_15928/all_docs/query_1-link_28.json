        "text": "Kris Jenner has hinted at the possibility of getting married to her longtime partner Corey Gamble, 43, when she turns 70 next year.\n\nThe Kardashian matriarch has stated she's not in a hurry to wed Gamble after two previous marriages to late Robert Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner, 74.\n\nWhile discussing her upcoming hysterectomy with friends Kathy Hilton and Faye Resnick, she suggested she might consider tying the knot again.\n\nWhen she shared the health update on Thursday's The Kardashians, Hilton quipped: “I thought you were gonna tell me you're getting married!”\n\nTo which Jenner laughed: “I mean, not right this very second!”\n\nResponding RHOBH star Hilton admitted: “I thought you were gonna say six in the morning [tomorrow]. I'm like, ‘That's a little early for me to be...’”\n\nThe 68-year-old, who has been with Corey since 2014, added that if she ever does get married again, her friends would be her bridesmaids.\n\nShe revealed: “Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid. I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I'm 70!”\n\nThe momager turns 70 on November 5, 2025.\n\nOn a recent episode of the Disney+ show, Jenner confessed that she initially questioned the 25-year age gap between herself and Gamble.\n\nShe wondered why he would want to date an older woman but eventually realised that you can't explain why people fall in love.\n\nIn a confessional, she shared: “I used to ask Corey all the time when we first started dating, 'Why do you want to date someone older?'\n\n“I didn't understand the age gap, but he showed me that age is just a number. It's a big number, but still just a number!”\n\nPreviously Jenner explained that having done “the big wedding” in the past, she didn't feel the need to walk down the aisle another time.\n\n“You know, you never say never, but I often say it's just not what I think I need to do again based on my past,” she shared during an appearance on Divorce Sucks with Laura Wasser podcast.\n\n“I'm in a really great relationship right now, and I'm happy and I don't want to mess that up. I don't have the need to put on a long, white dress and walk down an aisle. I've done that.\n\n“I've had the big wedding; I've had the babies and the kids… I think that I just feel really grateful and blessed for my past experiences and I'm looking forward to my future and I just don't think that I want to go there.”"
