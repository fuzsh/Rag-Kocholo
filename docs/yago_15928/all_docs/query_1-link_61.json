        "text": "The momager is back.\n\nKris Jenner made her seventh appearance at the Met Gala on Monday, stepping out on the 2024 red carpet wearing a monochromatic white satin gown and overcoat designed by Oscar de la Renta.\n\nThe “Kardashians” star, 68, honored this year’s “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” theme with embroidered flowers at the top of her dress that ran down her back.\n\nShe accessorized her all-white look with eye-catching emerald rings and earrings from Lorraine Schwartz and Manolo Blahnik shoes.\n\nJenner, 68, dazzled on the carpet while walking arm in arm with her boyfriend Corey Gamble, 43, as her date.\n\nFor his part, he sported an all-white suit, a cross necklace, several rings and sunglasses.\n\nThe reality star was the first from the Kardashian-Jenner clan to arrive as her daughters Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner were nowhere to be seen.\n\nWhile the Safely founder skipped 2023’s Karl Lagerfeld-themed event — surprising, as she was very close with the late fashion designer — Kris is no stranger to the annual A-list fashion event hosted by Anna Wintour.\n\nAt the 2022 gala, where all the Kardashian-Jenner women were in attendance, she complemented Kim’s viral Marilyn Monroe gown — which she helped procure from Ripley’s! Believe It Or Not — with a Jackie Kennedy-inspired look by Oscar de la Renta.\n\nDespite their coordinated moment, Kim — who has become one of the most-anticipated Met Gala arrivals over the years — hasn’t always approved of her mom’s looks.\n\nShe and sister Khloé brutally blasted Kris’ campy Tommy Hilfiger ensemble from 2019, which included a blond bob and over-the-top ruffled cape.\n\nKarma came for Kim, however, when her daughter North West criticized the “fake”-looking pearls on her Schiaparelli look for the 2023 gala.\n\nTime will tell what the Skims founder’s eldest daughter thinks of this year’s outfit."
