        "text": "Kris and Caitlyn Jenner finalised their divorce in December 2014 after 23 years of marriage - something which the former Olympian says had nothing to do with her identity.\n\nIn a new candid interview, 70-year-old Caitlyn opened up about her transition and divorce from Kris, touching on how there were \"bigger issues\" at play that brought on the split.\n\n\"After twenty-three years, Kris and I went our separate directions,\" she explained on the Literally! With Rob Lowe podcast (via Mirror). \"My identity… it was not a big part of us separating. There was so many other bigger issues out there.\"\n\nCaitlyn announced her transition with an iconic Vanity Fair cover in June 2015. She said at the time, \"I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.\"\n\nOn their split, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star continued that there was a \"frustration with myself\" during that time, which led her to be \"a little bit shorter with [Kris] near the end.\"\n\nBut, she added, once they had split, a weight was lifted from their relationship. \"Then all of a sudden, we didn't have any issues. You know, we just, you know, it was calm.\n\n\"She even found [my new] place, she decorated the place, she did everything in Malibu. And she said, 'I want you to feel comfortable.' And that was it, you know?\"\n\nIn June, Kylie and Kendall Jenner celebrated the five year anniversary of Caitlyn's transition. \"When my dad came out as transgender, our relationship grew,\" Kendall told People magazine at the time. \"She could finally be honest with me. Because of my dad’s bravery, I’ve learned to love what I love and not be ashamed of it.\n\n\"She’s been my role model since before I can even remember, from sports growing up to now with her wisdom. She’s so brave and I aspire to be as brave as her one day.\"\n\nLike this article? Sign up to our newsletter to get more articles like this delivered straight to your inbox."
