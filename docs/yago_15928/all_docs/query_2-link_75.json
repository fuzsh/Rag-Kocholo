        "text": "(MENAFN- AsiaNet News) Momager Kris Jenner appears to have broken her silence on the potential of taking her more than a decade-long relationship with lover Corey Gamble to the next level. The 68-year-old American TV star even had her closest friends clamouring for her to reveal her wedding plans. However, she surprised everyone by announcing that she was prepping for an imminent operation.\n\nIs Kris Jenner getting married soon?\n\nOn the July 10 episode of The Kardashians, the matriarch revealed that she will shortly have hysterectomy surgery, revealing that her cancer was \"growing\" as she \"mourns\" the loss of her ovaries. As predicted, the surprising revelation left her longtime pals Kathy Hilton and Faye Resnick speechless. \"I thought you were gonna tell me you're getting married,\" Kathy said.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nAnant Ambani wears 50-carat diamond custom lion brooch for pre-wedding\n\nThe momager immediately turned the tone of the conversation and began discussing her wedding plans. Kris was formerly married to Robert Kardashian and then to Caitlyn Jenner. In chat with her friends, she did not rule out the possibility of getting married for the third time.\n\nIn 2018, she said that she believed in the \"never say never\" approach. However, her appearance on the \"Divorce Sucks!\" podcast revealed that her past marriages had certainly influenced her decision-making process when it came to weddings. \"But I often say it's just not what I think I need to do again based on my past,\" Kris explained at the time.\n\nLikewise, Kris still doesn't want to rush into it. Jenner hinted at her wedding ceremony with Corey, claiming she'd follow through with her marital plans soon. \"Maybe when I'm 70,\" she told her BFFs.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nAnant Ambani, Radhika Wedding: Shah Rukh Khan attends with family\n\nHer new attitude to marriage contrasts sharply with her previous statements, as she also implied in 2017 that she had no intention of walking down the aisle again. Kris' responses were clouded by ambiguity back then. \"You know, I've done that twice and it didn't work out so well,\" she told Ellen DeGeneres in February 2017. \"So I don't know - you never know.\"\n\nNonetheless, Kris' friends weren't alone in conjecturing about her wedding plans. Engagement rumours took flight in 2023 on Valentine's Day (and even in 2018) when the Kardashian family manager was spotted sporting a $1.2 million diamond ring.\n\nNonetheless, Kris' friends were not alone in their speculation regarding her wedding intentions. On Valentine's Day 2023 (and even in 2018), the Kardashian family manager was seen wearing a $1.2 million diamond ring, sparking engagement speculations.\n\nJenner and Gamble's names have been romantically linked since 2014. They supposedly met when fashion designer Riccardo Tisci introduced them in Ibiza, Spain. The momager has a 25-year age difference with her boyfriend, who has regularly appeared on the Hulu reality TV programme and is a business executive and talent manager who thrives in the music industry.\n\nSimultaneously, she encouraged her female friends to dress up as her bridesmaids. \"Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid,\" she replied to Kathy's initial assumptions. \"I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married.\"\n\nMENAFN13072024007385015968ID1108433195"
