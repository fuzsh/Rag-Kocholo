        "text": "&#151; -- When Bruce Jenner told ABC News' Diane Sawyer last month that he’s transgender, he said that his family had been supportive.\n\nHowever, it was tough for his ex-wife, Kris, to digest the information at first.\n\nIn a trailer for a special two-part episode of E!'s \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" to air later this month, she is seen crying to her daughter, Kim Kardashian.\n\n\"I have these memories of this life and I feel sometimes like it didn’t exist,” she said through tears.\n\nThe former Olympian and Kris were married in 1991 and announced their split in 2013. Together they have two daughters, Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17.\n\nKardashian, 34, tried to make her mother see things from Jenner’s point of view.\n\n“He has to deal with this for his entire life of waking up and feeling like, 'Woah! This isn’t my body. This doesn’t feel comfortable,’” she told her mother. “That’s the only way I can kind of imagine it. And you really have to, like, let go.\""
