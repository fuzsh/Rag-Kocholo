        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner released a two-word response to the news of O.J. Simpson's death, saying \"good riddance\" just moments after Simpson's family announced he had died after a battle with cancer.\n\n\"On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer. He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren,\" the Simpson family said in a Thursday statement. \"During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace.\"\n\nSimpson was a former football star who was acquitted in 1995 of charges that he murdered his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman the year before. He was represented by attorney Robert Kardashian, who was previously married to Kris Jenner. A month after her divorce from Kardashian, Kris Jenner married Bruce Jenner, who has since taken the name Caitlyn after coming out as a transgender person.\n\nThe Jenners were married for 24 years before their divorce was finalized in 2015. Kris Jenner was also the best friend of Simpson's slain wife.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Jenner via email for comment.\n\nAlthough Kris Jenner and the Kardashian children have largely avoided talking about Simpson or their father's role in the trial, Caitlyn has been outspoken about Simpson's acquittal.\n\nIn her 2017 memoir, she wrote that it was \"obvious\" that the senior Kardashian thought his friend and client was guilty, recalling that the lawyer told her, \"I would've been OK with it if they had gotten him in the first trial.\"\n\nJenner went on to call Simpson \"the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest a**hole in the world of sports I had ever seen\" and accused him of getting away with \"two savage murders.\"\n\nYears later, Jenner said Simpson had warned his wife he would kill her while Jenner appeared in an episode of Australia's Big Brother VIP, a reality TV series.\n\n\"Obviously, he did it and he got away with it, and at one point he even told Nicole, 'I'll kill you and get away with it because I'm O.J. Simpson,'\" Jenner told other contestants on the show. \"It was an extraordinarily difficult time. Nicole was Kris' best friend, had been for a long time. I was at Nicole's house two days before the murder.\"\n\nKardashian met Simpson in college, and their families became close over the years, with his children even calling Simpson \"Uncle O.J.\" But those dynamics changed dramatically after the murder charges against Simpson. Kardashian defended Simpson in court, while Kris Jenner struggled with the death of her best friend.\n\nSimpson recently made comments in interviews and on social media attempting to clarify his relationship with Kardashian's ex-wife, denying rumors of an affair or any paternity claims related to Khlo√© Kardashian, the daughter of Kris Jenner and Robert Kardashian.\n\nUpdate 4/11/24, 12:31 p.m. and 12:45 p.m. ET: This story was updated with additional information and background."
