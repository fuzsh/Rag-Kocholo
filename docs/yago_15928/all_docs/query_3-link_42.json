        "text": "Kris Jenner reportedly learnt about Caitlyn Jenner's gender transition from E! network bosses, as Caitlyn didn't inform her ex wife of her status as transgender personally.\n\nCaitlyn, who formerly identified as Bruce Jenner, was married to Kris Jenner for 23 years. The couple had daughters Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner together. Through marriage, Bruce became stepfather to Kris' children from her first marriage which are Khloe Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian and Rob Kardashian.\n\nYet despite their long ties with each other, Caitlyn didn't communicate her plans for gender transition to her ex wife. Instead Kris first heard about it via network bosses as it would be included in filming for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians reality show. This has all come to light and been revealed in the upcoming documentary House Of Kardashian, which will premiere on Sky Documentaries and streaming service NOW from Sunday (8 October).\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE:'Sad' Caitlyn Jenner admits she no longer speaks to ex-wife Kris Jenner\n\nA source told Page Six: \"Kris first found out about Bruce transitioning from E! execs, although Bruce eventually spoke to Kris.\"\n\nThe source continued: \"Caitlyn will always have love for Kris, and even after the divorce — which had nothing to do at all with transitioning — really has come to regret not talking with Kris personally first. It hurt [Caitlyn] to learn that Kris found out from network execs.\"\n\nThe news comes as Caitlyn has revealed her sadness at no longer speaking to her ex-wife despite over two decades of marriage. Since their split in 2013, two years before Caitlyn came out as trans on the now infamous Vanity Fair cover, Caitlyn shared that communication between them has now dwindled, despite Kris being supportive of her life choices.\n\nSpeaking to ITV's This Morning ahead of a new three-part documentary House of Kardashian being broadcast on Sky at the weekend, 73-year-old Caitlyn dropped the bombshell: \"Well Kris, I never really talk to anymore,\" when asked by host Josie Gibson what her relationship was like with the Kardashian-Jenner clan these days. Calling it \"sad\", Caitlyn said the only way she and Kris communicate now is via her manager.\n\nCaitlyn also revealed she was closer with some of her kids than others as there are so many of them. She said: \"When you have as many kids as I have, you’re closer to some than you are to others… I certainly see them and we do this and that. I’m much closer to the Jenner side with Brandon and Brody, Burt and my daughter Casey (from his first marriage before Kris). But Kris, I don’t really have any more contact with her. It's kind of sad because we went through a lot.\""
