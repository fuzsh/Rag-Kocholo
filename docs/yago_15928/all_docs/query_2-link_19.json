        "text": "There’s been a lot of speculation over the years that Kris Jenner and her longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble are secretly engaged, but according to the Daily Mail, they have zero plans to marry due to Kris thinking things “would not end well” if they divorced.\n\nAnd as for recent engagement speculation thanks to a giant diamond ring Kris was wearing on Valentine’s Day, a source tells the outlet that Kris “has had that ring for three years and has worn it out countless times.”\n\n“Kris is not engaged to Corey, and she has no plans to be,” the source explained. “She really has no need to marry him because she has exactly what she wants with him right now. Kris does not want to put anything on paper regarding their relationship because she knows that if their relationship does end, god forbid, it would not end well if they were married.”\n\nKris and Corey have been together since 2015, and the Daily Mail notes that back in 2018, Kris told divorce attorney Laura Wasser, “You know, you never say never, but I often say it’s just not what I think I need to do again based on my past. I’m in a really great relationship right now, and I’m happy and I don’t want to mess that up.”\n\nFair enough!"
