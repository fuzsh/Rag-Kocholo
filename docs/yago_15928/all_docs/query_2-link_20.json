        "text": "Kris, who turns 69 in November, has been dating Corey since 2014\n\nKris Jenner might not be rushing to the altar with Corey Gamble, but she also isn't ruling out marriage entirely!\n\nDuring the July 11 episode of The Kardashians, Kris met up with her friends Faye Resnick and Kathy Hilton for a shopping trip in Beverly Hills, where she filled them in on her upcoming hysterectomy surgery.\n\nAfter Kris, 68, explained the situation and grew emotional about losing her ovaries, Kathy admitted that she was not expecting to hear this particular news from her friend. \"I thought you were gonna tell me you're getting married!\" she told Kris, who has been dating Corey since 2014.\n\nKris let out a laugh and clarified, \"I mean, not right this very second!\"\n\nRelated: Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble's Relationship Timeline\n\nKathy then joked, \"I thought you were gonna say six in the morning [tomorrow]. I'm like, 'That's a little early for me to be...'\"\n\n\"Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid,\" Kris finished her sentence. \"I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I'm 70!\"\n\nKris and Corey, 43, first connected in August 2014 while they were both in Ibiza to attend mutual friend and fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday party. They began dating shortly after, and have been together ever since.\n\nThe two tend to keep their romance private, though they often attend red carpet events together, occasionally rave about each other on social media and even put out a holiday card together in 2022. Corey also appeared on episodes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians and now on The Kardashians.\n\nRelated: Kris Jenner 'Can't Explain' Her 'Chemistry' with Corey Gamble but Admits She Was Skeptical About Their 25-Year Age Gap\n\nIn early 2021, Kris spoke about Corey in an interview with WSJ. Magazine, telling the outlet that he was an incredible \"support system\" who was adored by her family. \"He's the greatest guy, and he's just an amazing support system for me, and he really gives me a lot of strength and insight. He's a great sounding board. And he loves my kids and my mom, and they love him,\" she said.\n\nShe shared similar sentiments in July 2022, telling PEOPLE while celebrating the launch of her new personal branding MasterClass that Corey has helped her majorly in her career journey.\n\n\"I think Corey is super. He's an amazing guy,\" she said. \"He's really supportive and he's really dialed into a lot of the different things. He's very knowledgeable about a lot of the things that I work on, and he really helps me in trying to think through some of the decisions I make. He's such a great person to bounce things off of. I really love his point of view on things.\"\n\nRelated: Kris Jenner Rocks a Massive Diamond Ring on 'That' Finger: Could She Be Engaged to Corey Gamble?\n\nShe also noted that Corey is \"a people person\" who thrives \"helping me navigate such a huge team and all the things that are happening.\"\n\n\"Everybody needs somebody to sort of run something by and help make decisions about the littlest things. It could be a travel, or it could be what you're doing that evening, or it could be what's going on at the office today. But it's really great to have him,\" she added.\n\nRelated: Kris Jenner Admits Corey Gamble's 'Yellowstone' Casting Sparked Her Jealousy, So She Forced Him to Reject Role\n\nCorey has also been by Kris' side this season as she prepares for her hysterectomy surgery in next week's episode. To help ease her nerves and take her mind off the procedure, he put a smile on her face by buying her a new fur coat in last week's episode.\n\n\"I don't want you to be sad,\" he told Kris. \"Babe, you're gonna cry at least 15 more times so I just want you to have a gift.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nNew episodes of The Kardashians drop Thursdays at 12 a.m. ET on Hulu.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
