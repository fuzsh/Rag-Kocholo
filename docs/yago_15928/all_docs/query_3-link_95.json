        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner is set to star on Big Brother VIP this year, and she’s one of the biggest contestants billed for the highly anticipated show.\n\nHer life has been the subject of microscopic proportions thanks to her time on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nCaitlyn may be best known for being the stepparent of Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian, but overall, she’s a proud parent to six children, including Kendall and Kylie Jenner.\n\nAs if her brood wasn’t big enough, it’s been recently announced that she’s about to become a grandparent for the 19th time after it was reported Kylie is pregnant with her second child.\n\nThe former Olympian has had quite a rollercoaster of marriages that have led to her huge family but before her turn on Aussie reality TV, take a look back at Caitlyn’s relationship timeline.\n\nChrystie Scott\n\nAccording to Sports Illustrated, Caitlyn met her first wife, Chrystie, at Graceland University, and the pair married in 1972 when she was 23-years-old.\n\nHer wife was photographed through their marriage supporting Caitlyn through her sporting ambitions during the Montreal Summer Olympics in 1976.\n\nThey share two children, a son called Burt Jenner, born in 1978, and when Chrystie was pregnant with their second child, a daughter called Cassandra, their marriage ended. They finalised their divorce in January 1981.\n\nDuring a 2015 interview with Good Morning America, Chrystie opened up about how intense changes in their lives caused friction and ultimately ended their relationship.\n\n“It was an underlying unrest and an underlying dissatisfaction of being married that led to our divorce,” she said. “[Jenner’s] career as a decathlete was over. There were a lot of changes in [Jenner’s] life … so that could have been a big factor. I don’t know. It wasn’t a thing that we explored because it didn’t seem like, it didn’t rear its ugly head.”\n\nLinda Thompson\n\nThe former model, singer-songwriter and brief girlfriend of Elvis Presley married Caitlyn in 1981, which was the same week she finalised her divorce from Chrystie.\n\nThey met at the Playboy Mansion during a tennis tournament when Caitlyn was living there after the demise of her marriage, as per History By Day.\n\nThe former spouses share two children, Brandon and Brody, best known for his appearance on MTV’s famous reality show The Hills.\n\nDuring an exclusive chat with ET Online, Linda revealed their relationship remained positive after their divorce in 1986 and that she was supportive of her marriage to Kris Jenner.\n\n“Honestly, I was so happy for Bruce because I loved Bruce … and Bruce felt like my brother,” she said.\n\n“You know, I wanted him to be OK, and I was just thrilled he’d found someone who had four children, and someone who understood what it was like to be a parent — you know, just to have that great family life again. … I thought he had found his forever and he pretty much had.”\n\nKris Jenner\n\nCaitlyn’s most well-known relationship is her 23-year marriage to the Kardashian matriarch, Kris Jenner.\n\nFive years after the end of her relationship with Linda, Caitlyn met Kris on a blind date in 1990, and just five months after they were married. The wedding took place a month after Kris finalised her divorce from Robert Kardashian.\n\nCaitlyn took on the role of a stepparent to Kris’ four kids, and they welcomed two daughters together, Kendall and Kylie, which meant they had 10 children between them.\n\nDespite a successful two decades, they separated in June 2013, and Kris eventually filed for divorce in 2014 due to irreconcilable differences.\n\nIn a statement published by E! News, the exes wrote a joint statement about their situation and why they remain on good terms.\n\n“We are living separately and we are much happier this way, but we will always have much love and respect for each other.\n\n“Even though we are separated, we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our number one priority,” they wrote.\n\nRonda Kamihira\n\nAfter Caitlyn’s transition, she was linked to Kris Jenner’s friend of 20 years and former assistant, Ronda Kamihira.\n\nVarious publications, including the Daily Mail reported the rumours, and a source told the tabloid that Kris was “devastated”.\n\nSophia Hutchins\n\nFor several years romance rumours have swirled around Caitlyn and her manager/good friend Sophia, 25.\n\nOn Heather McDonald’s podcast Juicy Schoop, Sophie revealed their hairdressers brought them together.\n\n“He was doing my hair one day and was like, ‘I’m going to a photoshoot after this, something with Caitlyn and MAC. And Caitlyn would like to meet you,” explained Sophie.\n\nThe rest is history, and the two became so close that Sophie moved in with Caitlyn after she graduated from Pepperdine University.\n\nIn a statement published in People Magazine, the manager spoke out against the public for concerning themselves with her relationship with Caitlyn, which she denied is romantic.\n\n“I don’t want controversy. I am just trying to live my life. Caitlyn is a parent to me. I have said that a million times. It is a parental, familial relationship. I feel so blessed and humbled to be a part of such an amazing family and that she treats me like a daughter.\n\n“I feel blessed that we are able to work together. There’s no hanky panky. I feel like I’ve been saying that for the past five years,” she said.\n\nWhat has Caitlyn said about her dating life?\n\nIn Caitlyn’s infamous memoir The Secrets of My Life, the reality star shed light on her dating preferences and how they may change.\n\n“A future female companion? I think about that. A future female sexual companion? Not happening, at least for now, and perhaps not ever,” she wrote.\n\n“A future male sexual companion? I have never had the inclination. But maybe that attitude might possibly change if I have the Final Surgery (gender confirmation surgery).”\n\nShe also discussed why the public’s obsession with her sexuality is influenced by transphobia.\n\n“I don’t have the appetite for [sex], which is why the public’s obsession over whether I would [get gender confirmation surgery] is annoying to me,” she said. “It hearkens back to this misperception that people transition because of their sexual desires.”\n\nWant more Big Brother VIP content?
