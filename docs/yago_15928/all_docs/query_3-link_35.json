        "text": "Image: Getty\n\nKris Jenner has publicly slammed Caitlyn Jenner’s portrayal of her in her new memoir The Secrets Of My Life as “all made up”.\n\nIn a preview of an upcoming episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris blasts what her former husband of 24 years, who’s since transitioned from a man to a woman, wrote about her during a conversation with daughters Kim and Khloe.\n\n“I read it and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time,” Kris says in the clip.\n\nThe Kardashian ‘momajer’ takes issue with Caitlyn’s claim that Kris knew of her desire to transition from when they first met, something Kris disputes.\n\n“None of it makes sense. Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a b*tch and an a*shole?\n\n“All through the book [it says] ‘Kris knew. Kris knew before I even made love to her’. I’m like, “What!?”‘\n\nKris and Caitlyn have maintained a sense of civility, at least in public, since Bruce became Caitlyn in 2015. But the goodwill seems to have evaporated with the release of the memoir.\n\nImage: Getty\n\n“I’ve done nothing but open up my home and my heart to a person who doesn’t give a sh*t,” Kris says. “So, I’m done. I’ve never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life.”"
