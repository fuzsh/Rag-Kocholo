        "text": "Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble recently made headlines after revealing that the former made the talent manager turn down an offer to star in Yellowstone as she didn’t want him to have a “romantic relationship” on the show.\n\nThe possessiveness sparked from their long-standing love for each other, which began blossoming after the twosome hit it off during a party thrown by Kim Kardashian’s then-husband, Kanye West, nearly a decade ago.\n\nSo, how did Kris and Corey meet? And how long they have been together? Take a brief look at the pair’s relationship timeline.\n\n2014:\n\nAfter meeting at the Donda rapper’s party, the couple sparked romance rumors after they were spotted having an intimate dinner in October.\n\nKris and Corey didn’t shy away from claiming each other in public as they celebrated the former’s 59th birthday at a Las Vegas nightclub in November.\n\n2015:\n\nThe talent manager confirmed their relationship with an Instagram tribute to Kris ahead of her ex-husband Caitlyn Jenner’s tell-all interview with Diane Sawyer in April.\n\n2016:\n\nKris and Corey made their Met Gala debut as a couple.\n\n2017:\n\nDespite being together for over three years, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians alum revealed she had no plans to walk down the aisle with him.\n\n2021:\n\nFollowing eight blissful years of being together, Kris described her partner as the “greatest guy” and an “amazing support system” for me.\n\n2022:\n\nThe duo sparked rumors of trouble after the manager was noticeably missing from Kourtney Kardashian’s marriage to Travis Barker in May.\n\nHowever, the speculations were put to rest after the momager was seen gushing about her love life in an episode of The Kardashians a month later.\n\nAre Kris and Corey Married?\n\nKhloe Kardashian voiced circulating rumors about her mother and Corey’s secret marriage in an episode of their reality TV show last year.\n\n”You think I would get married and not have a big ass party?” the businesswoman quipped in response."
