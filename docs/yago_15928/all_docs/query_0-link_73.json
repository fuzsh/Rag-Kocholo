        "text": "Which \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" couple might be on the rocks always makes for good tabloid fodder but one couple is ready to say they're over -- and have been for a while.\n\nKris and Bruce Jenner have confirmed they separated a year ago, after 22 years together.\n\nIn an interview with US magazine hitting newsstands Friday, Kris Jenner says their scenes together on the show have been genuine and there's no animosity between them. She says they're committed to their family.\n\nHer former Olympic champion husband says they'll always love and respect each other.\n\nNews of the split was first reported by E! News.\n\nThey say no divorce papers have been filed and that Bruce will continue to appear on the family's reality show.\n\nThe admission explains why on recent episodes, Bruce Jenner moved out to his own beach house, saying he needed more space.\n\nThe couple's teenage daughters, Kendall and Kylie, were also filmed joining him for the summer, because their house with mom Kris was too crowded after half-sister Kim Kardashian moved in with Kanye West and their new daughter.\n\nSince Bruce Jenner moved out, he's still featured on the series often. Kris Jenner has taped scenes at his new home, as have the other Kardashian kids.\n\nFifty-seven-year-old Kris Jenner and 63-year-old Bruce Jenner married in April 1991, less than a year after getting fixed up on a blind date.\n\nAt the time, Bruce had already been married twice before and had four kids.\n\nKris Jenner was newly divorced from Robert Kardashian, a prominent attorney who represented O.J. Simpson in the murder trial of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman. She already had four kids, Kim, Khloe --wife of NBA star Lamar Odom-- Kourtney Kardashian and Rob Kardashian.\n\nBruce Jenner has served as a father figure to Kris Jenner's children, especially since the death of Robert Kardashian in 2003 of cancer.\n\n\"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" is in its eighth season on the E! network."
