        "text": "Kris Jenner has been dishing the details on her potential third trip down the aisle, revealing she's even picked out her bridesmaids.\n\nThe head of the Kardashian clan has been with partner Corey Gamble for nearly a decade since they first crossed paths in 2014. Now Kris, 68, is sharing hints about tying the knot with the 43-year-old music executive, reports the Mirror.\n\nDespite having been previously hitched to Robert Kardashian and then Caitlyn Jenner, Kris isn't racing to the altar. During a retail therapy session with pals Kathy Hilton and Faye Resnick, she dropped some significant news regarding an upcoming hysterectomy.\n\nKathy, mistaking the update for wedding bells, exclaimed: \"I thought you were going to tell me you're getting married.\" Kris quipped: \"I mean, not right this very second!\" Kathy humorously responded: \"I thought you were gonna say six in the morning. I'm like, 'That's a little early for me to be...'\"\n\nCatching her friends off-guard, Kris chimed in to finish Kathy's thought: \"Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid. I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I'm 70!\"\n\nThe reality TV star let slip her nuptial news during the most recent episode of The Kardashians while out shopping. Elsewhere, Kris has also been voicing her worries about her relationship with her younger partner Corey.\n\nThe duo, who struck up a romance in August 2014, have been frequently sighted out together across California and Las Vegas. Yet, the significant age difference has drawn concerns from Kris' daughters, with Khloe Kardashian notoriously calling it \"creepy\".\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nKris Jenner, now 68, has confessed she too was initially doubtful about the 25-year gap with Corey Gamble, 43. On a recent episode of The Kardashians, she confided to the cameras: \"I used to say to Corey all the time when I first started dating him, like, 'Why do you want to date somebody older than you?' I didn't get the age gap.\"\n\nCorey's reassurance seemed to have put any unease to rest, as Kris admitted in a candid moment: \"He taught me that age is just a number. F****** big number, but it's a number.\"\n\nShe elaborated further: \"Listen, I can't explain someone's chemistry or why people fall in love, but it's been an amazing almost 10 years and we have a great time.\" The power couple celebrated their union in Paris amid fashion week, when supporting Kendall Jenner on the runway.\n\nCorey turned on the charm with a romantically planned rooftop bar cocktail experience, set against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Kris reminisced during an intimate moment: \"I love being in Paris with Corey because Corey and I started dating in Paris.\""
