        "text": "Rodney Drunasky, age 69, died Wednesday, May 17, 2006 at his home in Horicon.\n\nFriends and family may call on Sunday, May 21, 2006 from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at St. Stephen Ev. Lutheran Church in Horicon. Funeral services will follow on Sunday at church, beginning at 3:00 PM. Rev. Daniel Seehafer will officiate. Burial will be at Trinity Cemetery, Reeseville. Military Graveside Services will be conducted by the Horicon American Legion Post # 157.\n\nRod was born on June 14, 1936 in Madison, Wisconsin to the late Louis and Charlotte (Dolan) Drunasky. Following the death of his parents, he was raised by his sister Bea and Clem Wolfe with their two children, Bruce and Jackie. Rod graduated from Waterloo High School in 1955. He also built and raced stock cars in Columbus, Jefferson, and Oregon. He went into the US Navy for four years where he received his boiler training. During that time, he was stationed in Japan for 2 years. He tended boilers at Wisconsin School for Boys in Wales. Rod obtained his state license for boiler inspector in 1966. In 1972, he worked for his nuclear inspector license and worked for various companies. A colleague is quoted as saying that Rod was one of a kind and there won”t be one like him again. On December 11, 1965, Rod was united in marriage with Beverly Kohls at Trinity Lutheran Church, Reeseville. They made their first home in Jefferson and from there, moved to Rockford, Illinois. While in Rockford, they welcomed the birth of two children, Brendan “Dan” and Kimberly. In 1972, the family moved to Dousman where Rod continued to inspect boilers in the Milwaukee area. In the fall of 1973, they moved to Horicon where he continued to inspect boiler machinery and paper mills in central Wisconsin until he retired. Rod was a member and an usher at St. Stephen Ev. Lutheran Church in Horicon for a number of years. He was active in the Horicon American Legion Post # 157 and had been a member of the Horicon Kiwanis Club. He enjoyed socializing, antique tractor pulls, playing cards, and watching sports and WW II movies. His favorite activity, however, was playing with his granddaughters.\n\nRod is survived by his wife of 40 years, Beverly Drunasky of Horicon; his son, Brendan “Dan” Drunasky of Horicon; his daughter, Kimberly (Thomas) Allen of DePere; two granddaughters, Anna Renae and Kate Marie Allen, both of DePere; three sisters, Beatrice Wolfe Barth of Sun Prairie, Bernadine Knudson of Sun Prairie and Ruth Hulsebus of Freeport, Illinois; his brother, Robert (Rita) Drunasky of Sun Prairie; two brothers-in-law, Richard (Linda) Kohls of Mayville and John Kohls of Horicon, nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends.\n\nRod was preceded in death by his parents, a daughter, Vicki Lynne in 1966, and a sister, Mary Ellen Schwebs.\n\nThe family suggests that memorials be made in Rodney Drunasky”s name to St. Stephen Ev. Lutheran Church in Horicon or the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe Murray Funeral Home in Horicon is serving the family.\n\nService Details\n\nSunday, May 21st, 2006, 3:00pm\n\nInterment Details\n\nTrinity Lutheran Cemetery-Reeseville"
