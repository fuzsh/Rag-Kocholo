        "text": "Tony Natsis (Allen Matkins), John Sullivan (DLA Piper) and Diane Haller (Quarles)\n\nWe’re thrilled to introduce the newest guide in our collection: The 2024 Lawdragon 500 Leading Global Real Estate Lawyers.\n\nThese amazing lawyers know their leases from their land use, their REITs from their restructuring, their condos from their construction. Real estate, broadly defined, is an asset class that ranges from the vision, finance, construction and leasing of New York’s glorious new Hudson Yards district to applying those same skills to an affordable housing development outside San Diego.\n\nAs we researched this guide, we were also impressed with the pockets of nuance within various geographic markets. From London to Los Angeles and Austin to Atlanta, each is differently composed in the profile of its existing real estate and the footprint it offers for development.\n\nGetting to know these lawyers and other candidates brought enormous respect for the depth of knowledge in the law and local business and politics required for any great real estate lawyer. Too, it opened our eyes to the heft of several of the world’s leading law firms and their strength in this particular category. Kirkland & Ellis and Latham are represented in abundance here, as they are on many guides, because of the unprecedented dimension private equity has added to their practice. Greenberg Traurig, meanwhile, tops this guide due to an unbelievable strength born in Miami and grown worldwide.\n\nThis guide covers a lot of, well, ground. And one of the things we like most about our Lawdragon guides is the ability to search within practice areas, winnowing down the land use lawyers from the czars of REIT. Try it and please send any feedback!\n\nWe selected this guide with our proprietary process, which includes a growing number of fabulous nominations. Thank you so much for taking the time to send us so many interesting candidates to research – you are our critical difference! As always, our independent journalistic research is our bedrock, with an assist from our longtime advisors who help us sort through recommended lawyers.\n\nThis guide is 20 percent female and 15 percent inclusive."
