        "text": "Biking in Lewes is like biking in most places around the country. But we do have some special rules for downtown Lewes. Otherwise, we follow Delaware state law.\n\n✅ Stay visible.\n\n✅ Move predictably.\n\n✅ Obey signs and signals.\n\n✅ Wear a helmet! (It’s the law if you’re under 18.)\n\n✅ Travel on the right, pass on the left. (Shout a friendly “on your left!” when passing.)\n\n✅ When you ride at dusk or night, use a white headlight and red rear tail light or reflector.\n\n✅ Walk your bikes on sidewalks downtown (unless you’re 12 or under).\n\n✅ When you walk your bike, follow the rules for walking.\n\n✅ Park your bike at a bike rack. There are several downtown, including the Bike Corral across from Dogfish Inn.\n\n❗If you have to bike on the road, move with traffic; don’t get squeezed between moving vehicles and parked cars.\n\n❌ Don’t hold up traffic.\n\n❌ Don’t bike on sidewalks downtown.\n\n❌ Don’t cover your ears with headphones. (It’s the law.)\n\n❌Don’t lock your bike on parking meters or lamp posts\n\n❌ Don’t lean your bike against storefronts or homes.\n\n❌ Don’t carry more passengers on your bike than it’s built for.\n\n⚠️ Be careful when biking across crosswalks. Bikes do not have the right of way on crosswalks.\n\nWalking and cycling share many of the same paths in Lewes. Whether you’re getting from point A to point B, taking a stroll or going out for a jog or run, there are simple steps you can take to stay safe and share the paths and roads.\n\n✅ Move to the right, pass on the left.\n\n✅ Cross roads and streets at crosswalks.\n\n✅ At dusk and night, wear light colored and reflective clothing and carry a light.\n\n✅ Use sidewalks wherever they’re available.\n\n❗When there’s no sidewalk, walk on the left so you can see oncoming traffic.\n\n❌ Never walk on highways.\n\n❌Don’t suddenly step down from curbs or cross the road into traffic.\n\nMotorists, cyclists, and pedestrians all share responsibility for safe behavior on the road, but motorists should take special care to avoid potential collisions given the speed and weight of vehicles compared to people and bikes.\n\n✅ Stop for pedestrians in crosswalks.\n\n✅Generally treat bicyclists as you would other drivers sharing the same road. (See DMV recommendations)\n\n✅ Only pass cyclists when you have ample room to do so.\n\n✅ Check your side mirrors for cyclists and pedestrians before exiting your vehicle.\n\n✅ Obey parking signs and don’t obstruct driveways or sidewalks.\n\n❗Exercise caution near downtown Lewes, residential areas, schools, senior housing, and Beebe Hospital.\n\n❗Pay special attention to residents with mobility issues and children.\n\n❌ Don’t pass other vehicles that may be stopped for pedestrians or cyclists that are not visible to you.\n\n[future content: video of the “Dutch grab” for exiting a car while looking behind you]"
