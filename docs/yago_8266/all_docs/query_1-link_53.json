        "text": "Rodney Busk\n\nRichfield, Utah\n\nRodney Jewell Busk, 78, passed away peacefully in his home in Richfield surrounded by his family on December 1, 2023. He was born September 12, 1945 in Salt Lake City to Jewell Albert and Carol Lydia Vail Busk.\n\nRodney married his high school sweetheart, Janet Littlewood on April 2, 1966. Their marriage was solemnized in the Manti Temple on May 20, 1967. They have raised four very wonderful children whom they are very proud of and grateful to: David (Pam) Busk, Cedar City; Renee (Michael) Sorensen, Mendon; Duane (Stacey) Busk and Daniel (Cheryl) Busk, both of Richfield. Together their posterity includes 15 grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren and one more on the way.\n\nRodney is survived by his wife, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren as well as his siblings: Judy Van Duren, Salt Lake City; Morgan (Marsha) Busk, Melony (Carlos) Guerrero, Kendall (Jan) Busk, Richard (Lani) Busk, Honas (Renae) Busk, all Richfield; sister-in-law, Karen Busk, Central Valley.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents; brother, Kim Busk; brother-in-law, Michael Van Duren; sister-in-law, Ruth Busk; and grandson James Sorensen.\n\nRodney grew up in Elsinore and Richfield. He graduated from Richfield High School and attended the College of Southern Utah. He worked as a surveyor for the BLM survey crew where he helped survey the Canyonlands National Park boundary just prior to it becoming a national park. He later attended Utah Technical College and became a certified draftsman. He then worked for Utah Sand & Gravel in Salt Lake City in their engineering department in the pre-stressed concrete division. He later worked for an engineering firm in Twin Falls, Idaho, designing roads, bridges, developments and a variety of civil engineering projects which expanded his building experience. He later returned to Richfield and joined his father in the construction business. They started out as Busk Construction and later when his younger brothers were involved in the business the name was changed to Busk Incorporated. He has built many homes and commercial buildings throughout Southern Utah.\n\nRodney proudly served in the Richfield Fire Department for 30 years from 1975 to 2005. He enjoyed his association with many generations of fire fighters. One of the last buildings he helped build was the new Richfield Fire Station.\n\nRodney was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served in many callings including Young Men leader, Stake High Councilman, bishop, temple worker, and full-time missionary in his home town Richfield. He loved the gospel and the association he had with so many wonderful people, but mostly he loved the Lord. He will be dearly missed by his family and friends.\n\nFuneral services will be held Monday, December 11, 2023 at 12:00 Noon at the Richfield 11th Ward Chapel, 1040 S 400 W, Richfield. Friends may call on Sunday from 6:00-7:00 p.m. at Magleby Mortuary and Monday, prior to services at the church from 10:30-11:30 a.m. Interment will be in the Richfield City Cemetery.
