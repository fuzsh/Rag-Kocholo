        "text": "“The cannonade then commenced and continued ’til 10,” Daniel Rodney, prominent Lewes merchant and politician, jotted in his diary on April 6, 1813. “The firing lasted until 10 p.m. when it stopped until the sun came up.”\n\nThe next day, Rodney noted, “When it again began and continued&mldr; 12,18, and 32 (pound) shot and Rockets (were fired) ’till 1 o’clock in which time 537 shot were sent against the town (including) six or 8 bombs and two or three Cong(reve) Rockets.”\n\nIn the second year of the War of 1812, a powerful British flotilla anchored within sight of Lewes near Cape Henlopen.\n\nThe enemy warships were short of provisions, and Commodore James Beresford, commander of the 74-gun warship, Poiciters, sent an ultimatum to the defenders of Lewes:\n\n“As soon as you receive this, I must request you will send twenty live bullocks, with a proportionate quantity of vegetables and hay, to the Poitiers, for the use of his Britannic Majesty’s Squadron &mldr; If you refuse to comply with this request, I shall be under the necessity of destroying your town.”\n\nWhen the people of southern Delaware learned of the British threat to destroy Lewes, more than 1,000 volunteers assembled to defend the town. The troops reinforced an old fortification on Pilottown Road, and near the center of town, they built a second defensive work. Their preparations completed, the defenders of Lewes awaited the British attack.\n\nMore: Free Black people built an Eastern Shore village. Why descendants want you to know it's here\n\nMore: American food began with Africa, the sandwich is Jewish: Michael Twitty on lost roots\n\nAfter waiting three weeks, Beresford ordered the bombardment to begin. On April 6, 1813, the British flotilla fired two shots over Lewes as a signal for the town to evacuate its women and children, and a short time later, the British warships opened fire.\n\nFiring cannonballs that weighed up to 32 pounds apiece and lobbing exploding mortar “bombs” that could smash through the walls of the strongest building in Lewes, the British were confident that the Delaware town would soon surrender.\n\nThe fearful sounds of the British cannon echoed across the Delaware countryside, but the damage to Lewes was minor. Most cannonballs and mortar bombs passed over the buildings and landed harmlessly in the fields beyond the town.\n\nThe British solid shot hit a number of chimneys, knocked corner-posts off several houses and a small shot lodged in the foundation of a building on Front Street, earning the building the nickname “Cannonball House.”\n\nMost of the buildings in Lewes emerged from the bombardment unscathed, but the only exception was Peter Hall’s tavern, which was hit several times and suffered significant damage.\n\nDuring the two-day bombardment, a number of the Lewes residents took shelter in a building near Block House Pond, including a pregnant woman who gave birth during the attack. The infant girl was cradled in a bed of corn stalks and lullabied by the boom of cannon.\n\nIn spite of the British admonition to evacuate the women and children from the town, most remained in Lewes throughout the attack. During the bombardment, one of the women heard a whistling sound over her head. She turned to her husband and asked, “What’s that noise?” He answered, “Bullets, my dear.”\n\nAfter the frustrated British squadron sailed away, a Baltimore newspaper reported, “The people of Lewistown &mldr; enumerate their killed and wounded as follows: one chicken killed, one pig wounded — leg broken.”\n\nPrincipal sources:\n\nTurner, C.
