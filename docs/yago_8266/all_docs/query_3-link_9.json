        "text": "Founded in 1631, Lewes, Delaware is known as the First Town In The First State. The Dutch originally settled Lewes as a whaling port because of its prime location of where bay meets ocean; Cape Henlopen is the breaking point for where the Delaware Bay & The Atlantic Ocean come together. Interestingly, almost 300 years later, the same thing that drew settlers to Lewes, is what still draws tens of thousands of visitors each year to its sandy beaches and fish-filled waters.\n\nThough far removed from being a whaling town, Lewes is still in touch with its maritime roots and rich history, which are both integral parts of everyday life here. From its still vibrant fishing trade to its popularity for history buffs, people still flock to Lewes to take part in outdoor living at its best. Speaking of flocking, Lewes is popular for birdwatching, great hiking trails, campgrounds and walking tours throughout the city.\n\nIt's also a destination dining spot, featuring great themed local eateries, bakeries, coffee shops and of course, fantastic fresh seafood restaurants.\n\nIf you're a history buff, the Zwaanendael Museum should be on your list as a place to visit and learn more about the early, settlement days of Lewes. It showcases the first Europeans to settle \"Swanendael\", as it was first called, along with the city's maritime, military and social history. These self-guided tours are a great primer for exploring other historical areas throughout Lewes.\n\nSecond Street is home to many specialty shops, boutiques and great restaurants. Because Lewes is a fantastic walking town, it's easy to explore a lot of what the city has to offer right from Second Street. Close to beautiful old churches, old ship's captain's homes as well as local fishing and watersports, it's easy to incorporate Downtown Lewes into your trip.\n\nThe canal is vital to Lewes culture, both historically and today. Built in 1935, it represents another major milestone in Lewes' development and is home to us here at The Fisherman's Wharf. From fishing to paddle boarding and boating, it's all right here. The canal also is a midway point of sorts for the city as it splits downtown from Lewes Beach and the Roosevelt Inlet, two more destination locations to visit when you're in town."
