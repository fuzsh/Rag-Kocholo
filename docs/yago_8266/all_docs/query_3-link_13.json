        "text": "Lewes, city, Sussex county, southeastern Delaware, U.S. It lies at the mouth of Delaware Bay just west of Cape Henlopen (state park), where it is protected by Delaware Breakwater (built 1828–35). Founded in 1631 by Dutch colonists, it was the first white settlement along the Delaware River. Originally called Zwaanendael, the town was renamed (c. 1685) for Lewes, Sussex, England, after William Penn was granted the rights to the area. A port town, Lewes has a seafaring tradition dating back more than 300 years. It was bombarded by the British during the War of 1812 and has been the site of many shipwrecks. Lewes is now a resort community known for saltwater fishing. Zwaanendael Museum (1931), a replica of the town hall in Hoorn, Netherlands, is maintained as a memorial to the early settlers. Restored buildings in the Lewes Historical Complex, maintained by the Lewes Historical Society, depict the city’s past. Lewes is the headquarters of the Delaware Bay pilots who guide ships through the bay and river; the College of Marine Studies of the University of Delaware also is located there. Regular ferry service links Lewes to Cape May, New Jersey. Inc. town, 1857; city, 1969. Pop. (2000) 2,932; (2010) 2,747."
