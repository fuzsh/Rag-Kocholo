        "text": "Lewes Beach is a part of the ancestral homeland of the Big Siconese people of Sickoneysincks Kill. The Big Siconese people were an Algonquin speaking people of the area. They were known as the “ancient ones” by many other tribes and were often called on to settle disputes between tribes. They first came into contact with white European settlers in 1609 when Englishman, Captain Henry Hudson sailed the Delaware Bay in the employ of the Dutch, in the ship Half Moon.\n\nThe end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century brought backlash from Reconstruction and the institution of Jim Crow, segregation laws in Delaware. These segregation laws extended to where people congregated at Lewes Beach. The section of the beach now designated as Beach 2 was known to some as the “colored beach” while the northern area of the beach now designated as Beach 1 was known as the “white beach.” Beach 2 was between the Dairy Queen and the location of the ferry on the beach."
