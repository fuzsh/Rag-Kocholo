        "text": "DANIEL RODNEY BORN SEPTEMBER 10, 1764 DIED SEPTEMBER 2, 1846 ENDOWED WITH A STRONG MIND IMPROVED BY SELF CULTURE, HE WAS EARLY CALLED TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF HIS NATIVE STATE. HE HELD FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE OFFICE OF JUDGE AND WAS AFTERWARDS ELECTED GOVERNOR OF THE STATE AND MEMBER OF CONGRESS. IN THESE EXALTED STATIONS HE SHOWED A HIGH DEGREE OF PRACTICAL WISDOM AND SOUND JUDGEMENT WHILE HIS INFLEXIBLE INTEGRITY SECURED THE CONFIDENCE AND ESTEEM OF HIS FELLOW MEN. BUT IT WAS IN DOMESTIC LIFE THAT HE EXHIBITED THE MOST ENGAGING QUALITIES AND IN THE PURITY OF HIS MANNERS. THE GENTLENESS OF HIS DISPOSITION AND TRULY CHRISTIAN EXAMPLE HAS LEFT HIS CHILDREN A LEGACY MORE TO BE PRIZED THAN OFFCE OR RENOWN."
