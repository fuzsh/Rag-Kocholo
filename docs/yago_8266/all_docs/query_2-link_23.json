        "text": "Daniel Rodney Trujillo, 63, of Fort Myers, Florida, passed away Dec. 3. He was born March 7, 1954, in Brighton, to John and Josephine Trujillo.\n\nDan spent half of his life in Colorado and the other half in southwest Florida. He retired in 2017 after spending 25 years as a sales representative for NAPA Auto Parts. A hard worker, Dan’s real love was life. He loved coaching Jake and Janna’s baseball and softball teams and was the proud owner of a 1967 El Camino.\n\nDan was a die-hard Denver Broncos and Colorado Rockies fan and made sure he raised his children to follow suit. He was passionate about caring for his many plants, riding his bicycle, playing a round of golf and enjoying a good beach sunset. It wasn’t uncommon to find him relaxing at the cottage on Fort Myers beach.\n\nSurvivors are his daughter, Janna Jameson Trujillo; a son, Jacob Kerry Trujillo and his wife, Rachel (Boyer) Trujillo; a grandson, Jude Aaron Trujillo; his mother, Jodi (Chavez) Trujillo; his former wife of 20 years, Lisa Trujillo; and a host of siblings, nieces, nephews, friends and extended family.\n\nHis brother, Kerry Trujillo; his father, John Trujillo; his stepfather, Bob Rojo; and good friends Danny Mattingly and Doug Winfield, prededed him in death.\n\nThe memorial service was Jan. 14 in Fort Myers. A graveside service will be at 1 p.m. Friday, June 1, at Fairview Cemetery, 102 Telluride St., Brighton."
