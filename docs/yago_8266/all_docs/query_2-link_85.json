The Leeds, Alabama, native served as tight ends coach for the Volunteers in 1996 and added the task of offensive tackles in 1997. During his two years, UT produced a combined 21-4 overall record, a 14-2 mark in SEC regular season play, appearances in the Citrus and Orange Bowls and a coveted 1997 SEC Championship.\n\nGarner has spent his entire career in the SEC and enjoyed success at every stop, a journey that includes six conference championships, 35 bowl game appearances, seven NFL Draft first-round picks coached and 10 All-Americans developed.\n\nGarner’s successful track record has been evident in three seasons on the job in Knoxville with multiple NFL Draft picks and back-to-back years with a first-team All-SEC recipient. The Volunteers have produced a physical and disciplined defensive line that forged a team that has won 27 games over the past three seasons, including the program’s first 11-win campaign in two decades in 2022.\n\nIn Garner’s first season in 2021, the defense finished eighth nationally and second in the SEC in tackles for loss with 108, doubling its total from a season prior. Fifth-year senior defensive tackle Matthew Butler produced the best season of his career, notching 47 tackles, 8.5 tackles for loss, five sacks and seven quarterback hurries. Pro Football Focus rated him among the SEC’s top 10 defensive linemen in rush defense, and he was invited to the East-West Shrine Bowl and NFL Combine. An Academic All-American and NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship recipient, Butler put the finishing touches on his career when he was selected by the Las Vegas Raiders in the fifth round (pick No. 175) of the 2022 NFL Draft.\n\nThe 2022 campaign saw the Vols lead the SEC in tackles for loss per game with 7.2, a mark that also ranked 10th nationally. Garner’s unit was among the nation’s best at putting pressure on the quarterback with 80 quarterback hurries, and it set the tone for a rushing defense that was second in the SEC and 20th in the FBS, allowing only 115.8 rushing yards per game.\n\nGarner’s latest path-to-the-draft protégé was 2022 first-team All-SEC recipient Byron Young. After arriving at Tennessee from the junior college ranks, Young registered 23.5 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks in two seasons while working with Garner. He ranked sixth in the SEC in sacks (7), eighth in tackles for loss (12) and was top-five in the league with 42 quarterback pressures according to PFF.\n\nYoung’s development under Garner guided the edge rusher to a Senior Bowl and NFL Combine invite. In April, Young was chosen with the No. 77 overall pick in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams. Young was spectacular in his rookie season with the Rams, ranking among the league’s best in sacks.\n\nThe 2023 Tennessee defensive line continued its rise and served as the catalyst for the Vols’ nine-win season and Citrus Bowl victory. UT finished 19th in the nation in run defense, allowing only 113.7 yards per game. The Vols held opponents to under 100 yards rushing seven times—the program’s most since 2005—while ranking sixth in the FBS in tackles for loss (101) and ninth in sacks (41).\n\nGarner prepared true sophomore edge rusher James Pearce Jr., who received first-team All-SEC honors after leading the SEC in both tackles for loss (14.5) and sacks (10) in 2023. He ranked among the top 50 players in college football according to PFF and posted a 92.4 pass-rush grade, which ranked second among all Power Five edge defenders. Just two years prior, Garner had recruited Pearce as a five-star defensive lineman out of Charlotte.\n\nGarner joined Heupel’s staff after serving as the associate head coach and defensive line coach at his alma mater of Auburn for eight seasons. From 2013-20, the Tigers won 68 games, two SEC West titles and reached eight bowl games, while eight of Garner’s defensive linemen were selected in the NFL Draft.\n\nIn 2019, Auburn’s defense ranked eighth nationally in both red-zone and third-down defense, allowing only 19.5 points per game against a schedule that featured six 11-win opponents. Garner coached consensus All-America defensive tackle Derrick Brown, who won the Lott IMPACT Trophy and was the No. 7 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers. Meanwhile, second-team All-American Marlon Davidson was taken in the second round by the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe 2018 Auburn defense ranked 14th nationally in scoring defense (19.2) and allowed only nine rushing touchdowns. The Tigers ranked in the top 20 nationally in sacks (38) and tackles for loss (96). Defensive tackle Dontavius Russell was drafted by Jacksonville. In 2017, SEC West champion Auburn ranked 14th in total defense and 12th in scoring defense, allowing just 4.67 yards per play, eighth nationally. All-American Jeff Holland, a first-team All-SEC selection, had 10 sacks, 13 tackles for loss and 22 quarterback hurries.\n\nThe 2016 season saw the Tigers rank seventh nationally in scoring defense (17.1), 11th in red zone defense (74.42) and 28th in total defense (361.9), holding eight consecutive opponents without a rushing touchdown, the longest streak at Auburn since 1957. Garner developed outstanding defensive linemen in Montravius Adams (Green Bay) and Carl Lawson (Cincinnati), who were 2017 NFL Draft selections.\n\nGarner’s first season at Auburn in 2013 proved to be one the best in school history. The Tigers had the second biggest turnaround in college football annals (+8.0 games) and won the SEC Championship en route to earning a berth in the BCS National Championship Game. Garner coached All-SEC defensive end Dee Ford, a first round draft pick of Kansas City (No. 23 overall). Two more defensive linemen— Angelo Blackson (fourth round, Tennessee) and Gabe Wright (fourth round, Detroit)—were 2015 NFL Draft picks, and DaVonte Lambert joined Tampa Bay in 2016.\n\nGarner joined Auburn after an impressive 15-year run at Georgia as defensive line coach. During his tenure, the Bulldogs posted 117 victories, two SEC Championships, five SEC Eastern Division titles, seven bowl wins and six top-10 finishes, including No. 2 in 2007 and No. 3 in 2002. He was promoted to the title of assistant head coach in 2005 after serving as defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator since January 1998.\n\nUnder his watch, the 2005 Georgia team finished eighth nationally in scoring defense (16.4). In 2003, Georgia was second nationally in scoring defense (14.5), fourth in total defense (276.86) and sixth in pass defense (174.5, 1st in the SEC). The 2002 Bulldog defense finished first in the SEC and fourth nationally in scoring defense (15.1), first in the SEC in red zone defense (58.8) and second in the league in rush defense (114.0). That squad finished 13-1, won both the SEC title and Sugar Bowl and ranked third in the final national polls.\n\nAt Georgia, Garner coached five NFL Draft first-round picks -- Richard Seymour (Patriots) and Marcus Stroud (Jaguars), both Pro Bowl starters; David Pollack (Bengals); Charles Grant (Saints); and Johnathan Sullivan (Saints). He also coached draft picks DeAngelo Tyson (7th, Ravens, ‘12), Geno Atkins (4th, Bengals, ’10), Corvey Irvin (3rd, Panthers, ‘09), Jarius Wynn (6th, Packers, ’09), Kedric Golston (6th, Redskins, ‘06), Robert Geathers (4th, Bengals, ’04), Emarlos Leroy (6th, Jaguars, ‘99), and free agents Ken Veal (Chargers, ‘04), Paul Snellings (Colts, ‘00), Brandon Miller (Colts, ’00), Charles Johnson (Panthers, ’07), Tyrone Robertson (Bills, ‘00) and Demetric Evans (Cowboys, ‘01).\n\nSeymour went on to play 12 NFL seasons and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022.\n\nGarner participated in the inaugural Minority Coaches Forum in 2006 and was one of 10 coaches in the 2004 NCAA Expert Coaching Academy. He was among 20 chosen for the NCAA’s 2004 Advanced Coaching Academy.\n\nGarner was a four-year letterwinner at noseguard at Auburn from 1985-88. He was a member of back-to-back SEC Championship teams from 1987-88 and a member of five bowl game squads. An All-SEC performer and honorable mention All-American as a senior at Auburn in 1988, he served as team captain of that SEC Championship team.\n\nGarner earned his bachelor’s degree in criminology from Auburn in 1990. After college, he had a free agent tryout with the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers and played with the Pittsburgh Gladiators arena team in 1989. Garner worked at Auburn from 1990-95 as recruiting coordinator, tight ends coach and assistant strength and conditioning coach.\n\nA standout from Leeds High School, Garner, whose cousin is Charles Barkley, is married to Kimberly Lawson Garner, a 1988 Auburn public relations graduate. They have six children: Bridgett, Brielle, Jaiden, Kai, Sydney and Milan."
