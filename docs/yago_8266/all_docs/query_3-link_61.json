        "text": "7 Things You Didn’t Know About Lewes, Delaware\n\nWhether you’ve visited us before here in Lewes, Delaware, before or are planning your first vacation with us, there are some exciting and enticing things about our little slice of Southern Delaware that you may not know.\n\nAt The Beacon Inn, we’re always welcoming guests and helping them to make the most of their time in the area. Take a look at seven fascinating and fun facts about Lewes below — and don’t forget to reserve your room so that you can come and experience the beauty and history of Lewes for yourself.\n\n1. Lewes was the site of the first European settlement in Delaware\n\nDue to our geographical location, Lewes was the site of the first European settlement in the state of Delaware. Dutch traders used the area as an outpost in 1631, and while that didn’t last, this spot is still known as the first site and therefore gives us a rich history and heritage to dig into.\n\n2. Lewes’ climate is subtropical\n\nOne reason people love to come back and visit us time and again is due to the subtropical climate we enjoy. We do experience a mild winter, giving us the usual off-season period, but we also enjoy weather patterns that bring hot and humid summers. This makes our parks and nature spots thrive, while the beaches are a haven for the whole family.\n\n3. According to the 2020 census, Lewes is home to over 3,000 people\n\nThe plans for the next US census are likely already underway, but during the latest census – taken in 2020 – the population of Lewes stood at 3,303. This is actually more on par with the 1960 census, which showed 3,025 residents, after which the number fell until beginning to rise again in 1990.\n\n4. Lewes is home to several iconic lighthouses\n\nThe eagle-eyed reader will have noticed that our logo and name – The Beacon Inn – calls upon Lewes’ history with lighthouses. The area has had several iconic lighthouses owing to our strategic position by the sea. For centuries these lighthouses have helped vessels navigate the waves safely, and while what’s left of them is largely about preservation, they mark a significant symbol in our maritime heritage.\n\n5. Lewes has homes dating as far back as the late 1600s\n\nRemember our first fact? Well, because settlements have existed in Lewes since the 1600s, there are also plenty of opportunities to spot architecture from the period. In fact, on almost every corner in our historic district, you’ll be able to find well-preserved pieces of history, from the Colonial to the Victorian.\n\n6. Lewes was once a haven for pirates!\n\nKnown as a peaceful place to enjoy these days, you might be surprised to learn that Lewes has a swashbuckling past. Once a haven for pirates, there was a concerted effort to drive them away due to the damage they would cause. It is even rumored that famous pirate Captain Kidd claimed to have buried treasure somewhere in the vicinity of what is now Cape Henlopen State Park.\n\n7. Lewes has a thriving art scene\n\nOne of our more modern passions for treasure in Lewes is a love of art. Each year artists flock to the area for annual craft and art exhibitions, ranging from glass sea art to fine art from artists both locally and from around the world. You’ll find several galleries in the area, including the Peninsula Gallery right next door to us at The Beacon Inn on East Savannah Road.\n\nWhy not visit us for a weekend or longer to discover all of this wonderful history, the beautiful open spaces, and the local culture of Lewes? Whether you’re taking a break and need to relax or you want an exciting destination to entertain the kids with, we have something for everyone. When you reserve your room here at The Beacon Inn, we’ll make sure you have a great stay thanks to our comfortable rooms, private balconies, sun deck, swimming pool, and proximity to all the best sights."
