        "text": "(SOUNDBITE OF ELIOT DANIEL'S \"I LOVE LUCY\")\n\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST:\n\nThe star of \"I Love Lucy\" was born on this day in 1911.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"I LOVE LUCY\")\n\nLUCILLE BALL: (As Lucy) Good morning.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Good morning.\n\nMARTÍNEZ: For more than 30 years, Lucille Ball's hometown of Jamestown, N.Y., has celebrated with a comedy festival with slapstick, stand-up, all kinds of funny. So say good morning to NPR's Elizabeth Blair.\n\nELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: Jamestown's population is about 28,000, but during the Lucille Ball Comedy Festival, it adds about 14,000 people. Events include a stage show, where impersonators recreate an episode of \"I Love Lucy.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED IMPERSONATOR #1: (As Lucy) Hello, Ethel. It's me, Lucy. What are you doing this weekend?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED IMPERSONATOR #2: (As Ethel) Well, I'm not wrapping chocolates or bottling salad dressing. Why?\n\nBLAIR: There's a Lucytown bus tour.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED TOUR GUIDE: We're on our way to Jamestown High School, where Lucy and Desi flew in back in 1956 for the premiere of \"Forever, Darling.\"\n\nBLAIR: Some fans, like Alex Cash from Michigan, come to the festival dressed like Lucy, in her polka-dot dress and headscarf. Cash says it was her grandmother who first got her hooked on \"I Love Lucy,\" when she was little.\n\nALEX CASH: From that time, I just absolutely adored her. I love her as a strong female figure, and just - her comedy never gets old.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"I LOVE LUCY\")\n\nBALL: (As Lucy) Uncle Oscar?\n\nVIVIAN VANCE: (As Ethel) My uncle Oscar is a butcher, and he's got a big cold chest.\n\nBALL: (As Lucy) Why don't you knit him a sweater?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBLAIR: Lucille Ball remained loyal to Jamestown long after she became famous and moved to California. Before she died in 1989, city officials told her they'd like to build a museum about her, says Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center.\n\nJOURNEY GUNDERSON: And she said, don't just celebrate me. Don't just put my stuff in glass cases. Make my hometown a destination for the celebration of all comedy and its artists.\n\nBLAIR: First came the festival, then the Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum, but what turned Jamestown into a destination for comedy was the opening of the National Comedy Center - a sprawling museum that honors people like Johnny Carson, Joan Rivers and George Carlin. Comedian Nicole Byer, one of the headliners at this year's festival, is a huge Rodney Dangerfield fan.\n\nNICOLE BYER: \"Back To School\" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BACK TO SCHOOL\")\n\nRODNEY DANGERFIELD: (As Thornton Melon) Good teacher. He really seems to care. About what, I have no idea.\n\nBLAIR: The Dangerfield exhibit includes handwritten notes for his sets.\n\nBYER: So I was excited to see the way he, like, writes out jokes. It's, like, stuff that you think is, like, off the cuff is not. It's scripted, and he just makes it look like it's off the cuff, which is, you know, the mark of any great stand-up. And I got to see one of his suits, and I was like, didn't know he was so trim.\n\nBLAIR: Dozens of the exhibits are interactive. There's a small club where people can try stand-up and made-you-laugh battles. When you start the tour, you make your profile at digital kiosks. You select your favorite TV shows, movies and comedians.\n\nDONNA BOGERT: Tina Fey for sure. Jay Leno.\n\nJAMIE: Ali Wong, Ali Wong.\n\nBOGERT: Ali Wong.\n\nBLAIR: Donna Bogert, from New Jersey, and her daughter Jamie, from Philadelphia, are huge Lucille Ball fans. They say the Comedy Center and all of the stand-up performances at the festival show just how influential she was.\n\nJAMIE: It was so great to see comedians last night, and, like, maybe it's their start, and they're trying to, like, get their name out and whatever else, and we wouldn't know about them.\n\nBOGERT: Maybe five years from now, we could say, hey, guess what? Remember we saw them at the festival?\n\nBLAIR: The National Comedy Center's Journey Gunderson believes that's exactly the kind of reaction Lucille Ball would have wanted.\n\nElizabeth Blair, NPR News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2024 NPR.
