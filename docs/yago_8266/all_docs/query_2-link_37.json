        "text": "Yakima, Washington\n\nAugust 27, 1951 – August 12, 2016\n\nDaniel Rodney Trotter, 64, of Yakima Washington, died Aug. 12, 2016, of natural causes while vacationing on Maui Hawaii, with his wife of 25 years, Debbie, by his side.\n\nDan was born to William “Bill” and Elaine Trotter on Aug. 27, 1951 in Hot Springs, South Dakota. He married Kay Michaels in Edgemont, South Dakota in 1970 and they had two children: Sheri and Scott. Dan received his degree in business administration from Black Hills State in 1974. He married Debra “Debbie” Woodall in 1991 in Yakima, Washington. Dan's early career included Store Manager at K-Mart, Target and Mervyn's department stores in Colorado, Texas and Washington; he then finished the second half of his career at Boeing as a Supplier Management Contracts Agent. Dan retired in 2012, when he and Debbie moved to Texas. They returned to live in Yakima in 2015. Dan loved to spend time with his and Debbie's children, their thirteen grandchildren and extended family. He and Debbie enjoyed travelling and especially vacationing on Maui and at Disney World.\n\nDan is survived by his wife, Debbie; his daughter, Sheri Lichty and her husband, Jeff and grandchildren, Jacob, Camryn, Bailey and Isaac; his son, Scott Trotter and Scott's wife, Jennifer and grandchildren, Amirah, Kaleah, Aylah and Case; Debbie's daughter, Jennifer Woodall and her fiancé, Aaron and grandchildren, Avery, Izabella and Haddie; Debbie's son, Justin Woodall and his wife, Shana and grandchildren, Oliver and Finnegan; Dan's mother, Elaine; and his brothers, Ron (Joyce), Dale (Claire), Joe (Pauline), Ralph (Virginia), Jim (Kathy), and Steve (Tricia); and many nieces and nephews.\n\nDan's father Bill passed away in 2005.\n\nA funeral Mass will be held at St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Casper, Wyoming on Sept. 24, 2016 at 2PM. His ashes will be interred at a later date.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations to Dan's favorite charities, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Catholic Relief Services or your favorite charity."
