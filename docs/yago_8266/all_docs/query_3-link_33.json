        "text": "Lewes truly is a town with something for everyone. Explore the charming local shops, restaurants, and historic buildings of Downtown Lewes. Step back through time and discover the vibrant history of Delaware at one of Lewes’s museums, like the Zwaanendael Museum. Discover the restaurants and shops of Fisherman’s Wharf along the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal. Seek out iconic lighthouses, like Overfalls Lighthouse, the Delaware Breakwater East End Light or the Harbor of Refuge Light.\n\nAnd don’t miss out on any of Lewes’s exciting annual events, activities, and festivals, many of which are long-held local traditions. Residents and visitors alike enjoy the Doo-dah Parade, Boast the Coast, an Old Fashioned Fourth of July Celebration and Boat Parade, Coast Day, Seafaring Days, First Thursdays, summer concerts, fishing tournaments, the Christmas Parade, and a popular Antiques Show—to name but a few. The Historic Lewes Farmers Market, a community-based, producer-only market open May through October, has become an extraordinarily popular destination for shoppers since its opening in 2006.\n\nBay beaches, ocean beaches, fishing, boating, kayaking, canoeing, swimming, surfing… Lewes really does have it all. Stroll the white-sand beaches along the Bay in Lewes, or trek the trails of Cape Henlopen State Park to discover Atlantic beaches ringed in rolling sand dunes. Launch a boat and even moor it at the City Dock and Marina along the Lewes & Rehoboth Canal in the heart of town. Or paddle the numerous winding inlets, waterways, canals, marshes, and streams present throughout the area.\n\nLewes is starting to draw the interest of new residents—particularly retirees—for its wide selection of lovely homes and neighborhoods. Throughout town, you’ll find a diverse sampling of beautiful architecture, from the historic Queen Anne, Second Empire, Early Republic, Mid 19th Century Revival, and Colonial architecture of Downtown Lewes to the charming classic beach cottages of Lewes Beach neighborhoods to gorgeous modern homes along the bay.\n\nAnd popping up throughout the community and its surrounding areas are lovely new Active Adult communities‚ fully equipped with new low-maintenance homes and amazing neighborhood amenities. If you’re looking for a relaxing, fun, and active beachside retirement, then it’s time to come and explore life in Lewes!"
