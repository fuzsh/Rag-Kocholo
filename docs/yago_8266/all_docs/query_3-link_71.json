In the Cold War, it was home to a top-secret Navy listening post.\n\nFort Miles has earned its place in U.S. history, and Fort Miles Museum is dedicated to telling its stories.\n\nOur supporting partners, Fort Miles Historical Association and Delaware State Parks, have transformed a 15,000 square foot bunker into a museum portraying the amazing history of this unique Delaware landmark. The Fort Miles Development Plan will build upon this accomplishment."
