The location of our historic town along the picturesque shoreline, coupled with the tax benefits of moving to Delaware, cannot be overstated.\n\nWhen you visit Lewes, Delaware for a seaside retreat, you are likely too distracted by the scenery to think about something as dull as taxes; however, once you learn that Delaware is one of the most tax friendly states in the country, you may begin to wonder what it would be like to relocate to the shore and save money on taxes.\n\nProperty taxes are [on average] approximately ⅕ of New Jersey’s real estate taxes, ⅓ of Pennsylvania’s property taxes for an equivalent property, and ½ of Maryland’s real estate tax.\n\nOther tax benefits include:\n\nNo sales tax\n\nNo state tax on social security income\n\nNo inheritance tax\n\nSchool tax credits for seniors\n\nUp to $12,500 of retirement income is exempt for persons over age 60\n\nOnce you move to the Delaware beaches, you may find you need something to do with all of that money you’re saving in taxes. You’re in luck as there are many options. You can dine at world class restaurants or shop all afternoon. From the boutiques in the quaint town of Lewes to the outlets just down the road in Rehoboth Beach, you won’t be left longing for things to do. If you like to spend time outdoors, there are plenty of choices there as well such as nature trails, bird sanctuaries, touring the local winery, and of course, the beach.\n\nThe perks are seemingly endless – not only can Sussex County residents quickly and easily go on a sunset stroll along the shimmering waters of the Delaware Bay, but they also have more disposable income due to the money they’re saving on taxes. Your income simply goes further in Delaware. You should consider moving to Lewes, Delaware today!"
