        "text": "What Is Lewes, Delaware Known For?\n\nWe’ll admit it. We’re a little biased towards our small town of Lewes here in Delaware. Anyone who lives in the region knows what a special area it is, not only because of the friendly people, independent businesses, and beautiful scenery, but also because of the rich history.\n\nThere is plenty to see and do in Lewes that will bring the culture and stories of the past to life, but if you’ve never visited us, you may not know this history. Allow us, then, to introduce you to our quick guide on the things Lewes, DE, is known for, its place in history, its famous residents, and some of the locations you can go to make your stay even more enriching.\n\nAnd remember, if you want to immerse yourself in history and the beauty of Lewes, you can reserve a room here at The Beacon Inn today – we’re ideally placed to explore this historic town.\n\nThe History Of Lewes, Delaware\n\nWe have to go all the way back to 1631 for the first Dutch settlers who made the area a trading post. Named Zwaanendael – meaning Swan Valley – it changed hands regularly after this, mainly between the Dutch and the English. People often refer to Lewes as ‘the first town in the first state’ thanks to the area being one of the first places settlers landed and thanks to Delaware being the first state to ratify the constitution.\n\nThe town got its current name back in 1682 when William Penn was given the area by King Charles II. Penn named the region Lewes due to connections with locations back in England.\n\nLewes became an important location for so many reasons; from “safe houses” for those fleeing slavery via the border state of Delaware, using the Underground Railroad, to nautical and naval importance, including during the American Revolutionary War to World War II. Although the area saw no real action in the latter war, you can still find remnants of this past dotted around, including Fort Miles over in Cape Henlopen State Park.\n\nPlaces to visit\n\nLewes is perhaps known best for its nautical past, with stories scattered across centuries, and you can find out a lot more and get closer to this vibrant, seafaring region’s past by visiting a variety of museums and other historically significant attractions. Here are just a few to add to your list for your next visit to Lewes:\n\nFort Miles Historic Area & Museum\n\nThe Lewes Maritime Museum at Cannonball House\n\nZwaanendael Museum\n\nRyves Holt House\n\nThe Lewes Historical Society Campus\n\nYou can find some of these attractions in the Lewes Historic District, which forms a mini village, allowing you a glimpse into a bygone era. Don’t forget to visit the Delaware Breakwater East End Lighthouse, too, along with Cape Henlopen State Park and Lewes Beach if you want a relaxing way to enjoy Lewes in the outdoors.\n\nFamous people from Lewes, DE\n\nA short drive away, Rehoboth Beach plays home to President Biden, but Lewes has had its share of notable residents over the years, too. Here are just a few people who you may (or may not!) have heard of:\n\nOtto Wolgast – an early Dutch settler who later served as justice of the peace\n\nSarah Fisher Ames – an American sculptor in the 19th century\n\nMary Beth Ellis – long-distance triathlete active from 2006-2016\n\nTheodore Freeman – a NASA astronaut who died tragically in 1964 in a T-38 jet\n\nTom Mandel – a famous poet now residing in Lewes\n\nJohn Morris – a pitcher for Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants in MLB from 1966 until 1974\n\nHolly Shimizu – a writer and horticulturalist who featured on PBS show The Victory Garden\n\nEvents & Festivals\n\nYou can find all sorts of events and festivals throughout the year, celebrating everything that is great about Lewes, both past and present.\n\nFrom walking tours with the Lewes Historical Society to boat trips out to the East End Lighthouse, there are so many ways to celebrate the region and learn more. If you need inspiration or information for events and festivals when you arrive, why not have a chat with our friendly team at the front desk? We’re always happy to give you recommendations on the best way to spend your time here for an unforgettable and intriguing vacation!"
