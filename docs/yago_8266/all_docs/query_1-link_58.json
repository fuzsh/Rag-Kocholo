        "text": "Rodney Daryl Ball passed away peacefully on July 26, 2024, in Bradley, Oklahoma. Born on September 2, 1947, in Marlow, Oklahoma, to William and Geraldine Ball, Rodney's life was one marked by creativity, a passion for mechanics, and a deep love for his family. A memorial service will be held at 1:00 PM on Friday, August 2, 2024 , at the Main Street Church Of Christ in Alex, Oklahoma.\n\nRodney's early life in Rush Springs set the stage for a lifetime of learning and hands-on work. After graduating from Rush Springs and attending the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma (USAO), Rodney embarked on a career that would see him become a respected security guard for USAO. His work ethic and dedication to his role were evident to all who knew him, and he took great pride in contributing to the safety and well-being of the university community. Rodney had also served his country proudly in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Vietnam War.\n\nThroughout his life, Rodney's interests were as varied as they were intense. He had a profound love for reading about guns and working on them, showcasing his creativity and technical skill. This same passion extended to his hobbies of messing with cars and riding motorcycles, activities that brought him immense joy and a sense of freedom. Rodney was also known for his enjoyment of playing games on his phone and watching TV, simple pleasures that he cherished in his downtime.\n\nBut above all, Rodney was a family man. His happiest moments were spent in the company of his loved ones. He is survived by his wife, Kathy, of the home, three devoted sons, Phillip Ball and his wife Bellinda of Rush Springs, Daniel Ball and his wife Lindsey of Rush Springs, and Joseph Slawson and his wife Catrina of Rush Springs; and his cherished daughter, Amanda Scott and her husband Chantry of Bradley. Rodney's legacy continues through his thirteen grandchildren, Christopher, Brittany, Lilyan, Harper, Trey, Erin, Holden, Kaleb, Luke, Gabe, Gracie, Destiny, and Dakota; and his three great-grandchildren, Hudson, Lane, and Ryann.\n\nRodney's siblings, Sam Ball, Loyd Ball and his wife Dottie, and Carolyn Zumwalt and her husband Gale, will remember their brother with fondness and admiration for the life he led. He was preceded in death by his son, Jonathan Ball, who was surely there to welcome him with open arms.\n\nRodney's life story is also one of brotherhood and kinship, as evidenced by his close relationships with his brothers and sister. Together, they shared in the joys and sorrows of life, supporting each other through thick and thin. His memory will be a beacon of love and togetherness for them as they navigate the world without him.\n\nThose who knew Rodney will remember him as a creative soul, a man who could find a solution to any problem and who approached life with a can-do attitude. His ability to fix, create, and innovate was not just a skill but a reflection of his character-resourceful, resilient, and always willing to lend a hand.\n\nRodney's passing leaves a void in the hearts of those who loved him, but his spirit remains vibrant in the stories they share and the memories they cherish. His was a life well-lived, full of purpose, joy, and the warmth of family. Rodney Daryl Ball will be missed dearly, but his legacy will continue to inspire and comfort his family and friends for generations to come."
