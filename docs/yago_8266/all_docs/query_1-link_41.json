        "text": "Share\n\nDaniel Rodney Trujillo, 63, of Fort Myers, passed away Sunday, December 3, 2017. He was born March 7, 1954 in Brighton, CO to John and Josephine Trujillo.\n\nDan spent half of his life in Colorado and the other half in SWFL. He retired last year after spending 25 years as a Sales Representative at NAPA Auto Parts. A hard-worker, Dan’s real love was life. He loved coaching Jake and Janna’s baseball and softball teams, and was the proud owner of a 1967 El Camino. Dan was a diehard Denver Broncos and Colorado Rockies fan, and made sure he raised his children to follow suit. He was passionate about caring for his many plants, riding his bicycle, playing a round of golf, and enjoying a good beach sunset. It wasn’t uncommon to find him relaxing at the Cottage on Fort Myers Beach.\n\nDan is survived by daughter, Janna Jameson Trujillo ; son, Jacob Kerry Trujillo and wife Rachel (Boyer) Trujillo; grandson, Jude Aaron Trujillo; mother, Jodi (Chavez) Trujillo; former wife of twenty years, Lisa Trujillo; as well as a host of siblings, nieces and nephews, many friends, and extended family.\n\nHe is preceded in death by brother, Kerry Trujillo; father, John Trujillo; stepfather, Bob Rojo; as well as good friends, Danny Mattingly and Doug Winfield.\n\nA Memorial Service to celebrate his life will be held 1:00 pm Sunday, January 14 , 2018 at Bowditch Point Park; 50 Estero Blvd, Fort Myers Beach, Florida.\n\nAffordable Cremations by Baldwin Brothers, Fort Myers, is entrusted with final care"
