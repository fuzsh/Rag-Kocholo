        "text": "I am sad to announce the passing of Rodney Donald Cameron of Lincoln, NE. He started his voyage to the other side at the young age of 56 on September 18, 2022. Rodney had many friends and joys in life. He enjoyed playing tennis, archery, Egyptology, promoting animal welfare, video games, attending live concert as well as car shows, and of course Vespa scooters. He owned and rode his first purchased Vespa for over 20 years.\n\nHis two favorite holidays were Halloween and Christmas. He had fun dressing up to attend parties and spent 15 years playing Santa at Petco to benefit The Cat House in Lincoln, NE. Rodney was an animal lover. He spent his teen years with his bird, Perry. Perry was a parakeet that was well loved. He’d fly to and from Rodney, sleep on him, and even take food from his hand. Upon starting a relationship with Traci his love for critters expanded to cats, dogs, hamsters, and even rats.\n\nRodney was born in Ruislip, England by the Queen Mother’s doctor. Rodney was a military brat for some of his youth spending time in England, Puerto Rico, New Hampshire, California, and Nebraska. Though he spent a majority of his years in Nebraska he considered California home. He often talked about moving back there and being able to be in the sunshine and near the ocean. Rodney was also interested in his Scottish heritage. He talked a lot about wanting to someday take a trip to Scotland to see where he originated from.\n\nRodney was a self made man. He attended some college, but a majority of his education was self-taught. He began his career doing digital display signs in Grand Island, NE followed by working at Ag Express on agricultural electronics. A lucky break came when one of Traci’s college instructors told her about a job Rodney (who had the same instructor when he was in school) might be interested in. The job was in Omaha, NE and involved streaming movies well before that concept became popular.\n\nUnfortunately one of the company’s investors pulled their support so Rodney moved on to working with First National Bank for several years. In the position of software install and support he traveled frequently which allowed him to meet new people and visit new areas. When eventually becoming frustrated with the constant travel Rodney secured employment with Computer Services Inc in Lincoln, NE where he remained until his death.\n\nHe is survived by his sisters Linda and Laura, nephews Collin and Charlie, nieces Megan and Vanessa, cousins Trisha and Heidi (and others), many aunts and uncles, as well as lots of friends. He was preceded by his father Donald Cameron and mother Jill in addition to aunts and uncles."
