In spite of repeated Indian attacks, the resilient colony eventually became quite a bustling fishing port (its harbor continues to attract people with its waterfront dining and nightlife), only to come under siege by the British in the War of 1812. A bit more than a hundred years later, Lewes assisted in the defense of American shoreline during World War II with its infamous beach lookout towers. Lewes was listed as a Distinctive Destination by The National Trust for Historic Preservation, and has several wonderful museums that history enthusiasts are sure to enjoy, most notably, The Zwaanendael and the Canonball House Marine Museum. Be sure, also, to check dates for the Boast the Coast Maritime Festival, as well as the Lewes Seafaring Days and Archeology Festival, as these are much-anticipated annual crowd-pleasers.\n\nStroll the streets of this quaint New England looking town and enjoy outdoor cafes, art galleries, antiques and other unique shops. At the end of Second Street, the main street through town, is the historical complex; this includes buildings from the 1600s to 1800s.\n\nFishing is a big part of a vacation experience for some. You don’t have to bring your own gear. Fishing charters leave from the canal in Lewes every day for a half day or full day of fishing. Everything is provided. Also at the Lewes State park there is a fishing pier for those who like to stay on land; here you can meet other anglers and try your own luck.\n\nDolphin watching tours and moonlight evening cruises are available at the same location in the canal. And don’t forget for the kids, there is the pirate boat, which goes for a short jaunt out to Roosevelt Inlet, where a pirate will try to board the boat and kids can douse him with water.\n\nBeing right on the water, Lewes is also the embarkation and debarkation place for the Lewes Ferry, which provides a ride over to Cape May, New Jersey and back. The Ferry leaves every day and you may take your car or walk on for the 70 minute ride.\n\nAnd for nature lovers, the state park in Lewes has the Nature Center. Kids especially love learning about all the local birds, fauna and wild life in the area. The state park has informational signs located at all the beach access explaining the path of the migratory birds found in the area. The Piping Plover and the Horseshoe Crabs are unique to this area.\n\nThere are concerts on the grass at the local library in season for those who like a restful musical evening. This small town is packed with things to do and see, come rain or shine.\n\nFind out more about Lewes homes for sale today!
