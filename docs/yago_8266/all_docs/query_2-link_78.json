        "text": "Rodney L. “Rod” Christie, 62, of Bettendorf, passed away Saturday, April 11, 2020 at his sister’s home in Muscatine. Per his wish the rite of cremation will be accorded and due to the current worldwide health concerns, a celebration of his life will be held at a later date.\n\nRod was born September 12, 1957 in Aledo, IL, the son of Cecil and Conne (Reason) Christie and graduated from Westmer High School, Joy, IL. He was united in marriage to Toni Walper in Longboat Key, FL although they later divorced.\n\nRod worked in mortgage lending over 35 years and ended his career with Ruhl & Ruhl Real Estate.\n\nHe enjoyed socializing with friends and golfing, having made holes in one at Duck Creek and Oakwood Golf Courses.\n\nThose left to honor his memory include his parents, Cecil and Conne Christie, Keithsburg, IL; sister Deb (Bill) Baker, Muscatine; and nephews Daniel Clark, Evergreen, CO and Devin Clark, Warsaw, IN.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his best friend Brian Sloan.\n\nThe family would like to give a special thank you to Ray Brandt and Cathy and Larry Dennison, for always being there for Rod."
