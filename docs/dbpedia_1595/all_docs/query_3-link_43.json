Supplementation of three cytokines, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), or FLI, has increased oocyte maturation and embryo development in multiple species, but studies have not explored the oocyte differences caused by FLI IVM supplementation. This study aimed to assess important nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation events in high-quality oocytes. FLI-supplemented oocytes had a decreased GV (3.0% vs. 13.7%, p < 0.01) and increased telophase I incidence (34.6% vs. 17.6%, p < 0.05) after IVM, increased normal meiotic spindles (68.8% vs. 50.0%, p < 0.001), and an increased nuclear maturation rate (75.1% vs. 66.8%, p < 0.001). Moreover, in metaphase II oocytes, the percentage of FLI-treated oocytes with a diffuse mitochondrial distribution was higher (87.7% vs. 77.5%, p < 0.05) and with a cortical mitochondrial distribution was lower (11.6% vs. 17.4%, p < 0.05). Additionally, FLI-supplemented oocytes had more pattern I cortical granules (21.3% vs. 14.4%, p < 0.05). These data suggest that FLI supplementation in bovine in vitro maturation medium coordinates nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation to produce higher-quality oocytes.

This review also presents in detail the etiopathogenesis of lameness in dairy cattle and examples of its treatment and prevention. This work is based on a review of available publications. In selecting articles for the manuscript, the authors focused on issues observed in cattle herds during their clinical work. Lameness in dairy cattle is a serious health and economic problem around the world. Production losses result from reduced milk yield, reduced feed intake, reproductive disorders, treatment costs, and costs associated with early culling. A significant difficulty in the control and treatment of lameness is the multifactorial nature of the disease; causes may be individual or species-specific and may be associated with the environment, nutrition, or the presence of concomitant diseases. An important role is ascribed to infectious agents of both systemic and local infections, which can cause problems with movement in animals. It is also worth noting the long treatment process, which can last up to several months, thus significantly affecting yield and production. Given the high economic losses resulting from lameness in dairy cows, reaching even >40% (depending on the scale of production), there seems to be a need to implement extensive preventive measures to reduce the occurrence of limb infections in animals. The most important effective preventive measures to reduce the occurrence of limb diseases with symptoms of lameness are periodic hoof examinations and correction, nutritional control, and bathing with disinfectants. A clean and dry environment for cows should also be a priority.

However, a lack of general life history knowledge for threatened species can impede the effectiveness of conservation actions. Galápagos pink land iguanas (Conolophus marthae) are endemic to Wolf Volcano, Galápagos, Ecuador. These iguanas are threatened by invasive alien species, particularly feral cats, that may affect their small population size. To guarantee the long-term survival of C. marthae, the Galápagos National Park Directorate is considering, along with an ongoing campaign of feral cat control, the implementation of a head-start program. However, the success of this management strategy necessarily relies on the identification of pink iguana nesting grounds, which were still unknown at the onset of this study. We modeled the movement patterns of male and female iguanas during the reproductive season, using location data collected from custom-made remote tracking devices installed on adult pink iguanas in April 2021. We first calculated for each individual the vector of distances from its starting location, which was defined as net displacement. We then used net displacement as the response variable in a generalized additive mixed model with day of the year as the predictor. Based on the hypothesis that males and females may behaviorally differ after mating, we looked for female-specific migratory behavior suggesting females were moving toward nesting areas. The results obtained confirmed our hypothesis, as females exhibited a distinct migratory behavior, reaching a small plateau area inside of Wolf Volcano’s caldera and ca. 400 m below the volcano’s northern rim. Moreover, once inside the caldera, females displayed a more aggregated distribution pattern. The movement data obtained allowed Galápagos National Park rangers to locate individual pink iguana nests and subsequently to sight and collect the first observed hatchlings of the species. This work constitutes a necessary baseline to perform dedicated studies of pink iguana nests and emerging hatchling iguanas, which is an essential step toward the development of an effective head-start program.

This study used the AfiTag-II biosensor to monitor activity, rest time, rest per bout, and restlessness ratio in 298 prepartum and 347 postpartum Holstein Friesian cows across three lactation groups (1, 2, and ≥3). The data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models in SPSS, and five machine learning models, including random forest, decision tree, gradient boosting, Naïve Bayes, and neural networks, were used to predict the calving day, with their performance evaluated via ROC curves and AUC metrics. For all lactations, activity levels peak on the calving day, followed by a gradual return to prepartum levels within two weeks. First-lactation cows displayed the shortest rest duration, with a prepartum rest time of 568.8 ± 5.4 (mean ± SE), which is significantly lower than higher-lactation animals. The random forest and gradient boosting displayed an effective performance, achieving AUCs of 85% and 83%, respectively. These results indicate that temporal changes in activity behavior have the potential to be a useful indicator for calving day prediction, particularly in tropical climates where seasonal variations can obscure traditional prepartum indicators.

There is a global interest in the development of protective vaccines since the current anthelmintic therapy is no longer sustainable. A better knowledge of the host–parasite interaction is needed to design effective vaccines. To date, few studies have evaluated host–parasite interaction by comparing infected and reinfected animals. The present study evaluates the microscopical hepatic lesions in sheep infected and reinfected with Fasciola hepatica during the acute and chronic stages of infection. The histopathological study revealed the presence of necrotizing foci (NF1) associated with larvae migration during the early stages of infection in the primoinfected (PI) and reinfected (RI) groups. In the late stages of infection of the PI group and at the early and late stages of infection in the RI groups, extensive necrotizing/hemorrhagic foci (NF2) were found in the vicinity of enlarged bile ducts, some containing adult flukes, suggesting parasites may have caused NF2 while feeding. The immunohistochemical study revealed an increase in Foxp3+ T cells in both PI and RI groups with respect to the UC group and in the infiltrates adjacent to NF1 in the RI groups with respect to the PI group, suggesting the F. hepatica induce Foxp3 T cell expansion to facilitate parasite survival. In addition, in both the PI and RI groups, and during acute and chronic stages of the infection, a poor expression of iNOS was found accompanied by a strong expression of CD163, suggesting a marked M2 activation of macrophages in the hepatic lesions, which may be related with healing processes, and it also may facilitate parasite survival. The main differences between PI and RI animals were the more severe infiltration of eosinophils and Foxp3+ T cells, whereas RI did not modify M2 activation of macrophages which occurs since the early stages of primoinfection.

This study presents a bibliometric analysis focused on these technologies involving dairy farming to explore and map the extent of research in the scientific literature. Through this review, it was possible to investigate academic production related to digital and precision livestock farming and identify emerging patterns, main research themes, and author collaborations. To carry out this investigation in the literature, the entire timeline was considered, finding works from 2008 to November 2023 in the scientific databases Scopus and Web of Science. Next, the Bibliometrix (version 4.1.3) package in R (version 4.3.1) and its Biblioshiny software extension (version 4.1.3) were used as a graphical interface, in addition to the VOSviewer (version 1.6.19) software, focusing on filtering and creating graphs and thematic maps to analyze the temporal evolution of 198 works identified and classified for this research. The results indicate that the main journals of interest for publications with identified affiliations are “Computers and Electronics in Agriculture” and “Journal of Dairy Science”. It has been observed that the authors focus on emerging technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision for behavioral monitoring, dairy cattle identification, and management of thermal stress in these animals. These technologies are crucial for making decisions that enhance health and efficiency in milk production, contributing to more sustainable practices. This work highlights the evolution of precision livestock farming and introduces the concept of digital livestock farming, demonstrating how the adoption of advanced digital tools can transform dairy herd management. Digital livestock farming not only boosts productivity but also redefines cattle management through technological innovations, emphasizing the significant impact of these trends on the sustainability and efficiency of dairy production.

The aim of the current study was to collate behavioural data using the RHpE from horses at competitions assumed by their owners and/or riders to be fit for competition. The objectives were to quantify the frequency of occurrence of behaviours in pain-free horses and those with lameness or abnormalities of canter and to determine any differences between disciplines and levels of competition. The RHpE was applied to 1358 horses competing in Grand Prix (GP) dressage (n = 211), 5* three-day events (TDE) (n = 137), or low-level one-day events (ODE) (n = 1010). The median RHpE score for all horses was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 2, 5; range 0, 12) and the median lameness grade was 0 (IQR 0, 1; range 0, 4). The Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s test for pairwise comparisons, found a difference in median RHpE scores between low-level ODE and GP dressage (p = 0.001), but not between 5* TDE and low-level ODE (p = 0.09) or between GP dressage and 5* TDE (p = 1.00). The median RHpE score was highest for low-level ODE. The Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test identified a significant difference in prevalence of most of the 24 behaviours of the RHpE in non-lame compared with lame horses. Recognition of the behaviours of non-lame horses may improve equine welfare and performance, and rider comfort, confidence, and safety.

Here, we examine the morphological association between C6 and C7 for dependency in ECVM cases, where the partially absent ventral process of C6 transposes on the ventral surface of C7. A C6 ventral process presents two tubercles, one cranial (CrVT) and one caudal (CVT). In this study, the C6 osseous specimens (n = 85) demonstrated a partial or completely absent CVT (aCVT) graded 1–4 that often extended cranially creating a partially absent cranial ventral tubercle (aCrVT) graded 1–3. In the 85 C6 osseous specimens examined, the corresponding C7s demonstrated either a complete or incomplete transposition of the ventral process from C6 in 44/85, with 30/44 replicating a transverse foramen. A strong statistical dependency existed between C6 grade 4 aCVTs and grades 1–3 aCrVTs and C7 transpositions with replicated transverse foramen. Sidedness was also demonstrated, where a left sided absent C6 associated with transposition on the left ventral surface of C7. This likewise applied to right sidedness and most bilateral cases. These findings might benefit practitioners when radiographing the extent of the ECVM configuration in patients presenting caudal cervical pain.

Our second objective was to study the association between peak lactation milk yield and the occurrence of DME. This longitudinal field study was conducted at a 4300-cow dairy farm with a thrice-daily milking schedule over a 1-week period. We analyzed data from 61,677 cow milking observations from 2937 cows. Delayed milk ejection was defined as present if the 30–60 s milk flow rate was ≤3.1 kg/min. The mean average milk flow rate (MAMF, kg/min), mean milking unit-on time (MMUT, s), and mean duration of a low milk flow rate (MLMF, s) were calculated as the mean values from the 21 milking observations. General linear multivariable models revealed associations of DME with MAMF, MMUT, and MLMF. A multivariable ordinal logistic regression model revealed an association between peak lactation milk yield and DME. Cows with lower peak lactation milk yield had greater odds of exhibiting a higher frequency level of DME. The observed associations between DME and milking performance indices suggest that DME can negatively affect milking and parlor efficiency. Peak lactation milk yield may serve as a proxy to estimate cows’ risk of recurrent DME. Future research is warranted to test if alleviating DME through, for example, a modified milking routine influences the milking performance indices described herein.

We aimed to investigate the effects of incandescent lighting (IL) and LED lighting on Cobb 500 broiler chickens for six weeks. Production parameters (body weight, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio), calculated slaughter values (yield%, relative breast%, thigh%) and breast meat quality parameters (pH at 45 min and 24 h postmortem, color, drip loss, kitchen equipment losses, shear force, meat composition) were recorded. Non-stop recordings were used to analyze the behavior of the birds during several periods of rearing. The LED group was significantly better in the body weight parameter between week 1 and 5 and the feed conversion ratio between week 2 and 3. The most significant difference in behavior was observed in the middle of the rearing period. The chickens in the LED group spent more time eating, drinking and interacting, and rested less. There was no difference in the meat quality parameters; only shear force was significantly lower in the LED group (1781.9 g/s vs. 2098.8 g/s). According to our results, LED lighting can bring about positive changes in animal production efficiency, behavior and other important characteristics for meat consumers.

A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on 40 cases that underwent laparoscopic surgery to close the VRs using barbed sutures alone or combined with other techniques. Signalment, clinical presentation, surgery, and follow-up data were obtained. In total, fifty-nine VRs were closed using barbed sutures (alone or in combination with other methods), with six cases performed prophylactically and forty-four due to acquired IH. Of the forty-four cases with IH, four were non-strangulated hernias, while thirty presented with strangulated small intestines (twenty-eight acquired and two congenital). The results obtained in this study suggest that laparoscopic hernioplasty with barbed sutures is an effective and safe surgical procedure that could be recommended as a standard practice for managing inguinal hernias in horses, particularly when sparing testicles or preserving reproductive capabilities is a priority.

Giardia infection (GIA) is one of the first differential diagnoses and may be present in CIE-affected dogs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the faecal characteristics and faecal fatty acid profile (short, medium, long, and branched-chain fatty acids) in dogs with food-responsive enteropathy (FRE), immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy (IRE), and dogs infected with Giardia compared to healthy control (HC) animals as a potential non-invasive indicator of intestinal health that helps in the differentiation of CIEs. The C16:1n-7 percentage (p = 0.0001) and C16:1n-7/C16:0 ratio (p = 0.0001) served to differentiate between HC, FRE, and IRE. IRE dogs presented lower levels of short-chain fatty acids (∑SCFAs) (p = 0.0008) and acetic acid (C2) (p = 0.0007) compared to the other three groups and lower propionic acid (C3) (p = 0.0022) compared to HCs. IRE and GIA presented higher faecal fat content (p = 0.0080) and ratio of iso/anteiso branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) compared to HC and FRE. Correlations between some fatty acids and desaturation indices with the canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index and faecal characteristics were observed, suggesting that these compounds could play an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

Thirty-six crossbred growing barrows (65.20 ± 0.38 kg) were blocked into two treatment groups, fed high-wheat diets with either a high SID Lys:NE ratio (HR) or a low SID Lys:NE ratio (LR). Each treatment group consisted of three replicates, with six pigs per pen in each replicate. The diminishing dietary SID Lys:NE ratio exhibited no adverse impacts on the carcass trait (p > 0.05) but increased the marbling score of the longissimus dorsi muscle (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, LR diets tended to increase the serum triglyceride concentration (p < 0.1). LR diets upregulated fatty acid transport protein 4 and acetyl-coA carboxylase α expression levels and downregulated the expression level of adipose triglyceride lipase (p < 0.05). LR diets improved energy metabolism via decreasing the expression levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α1, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) (p < 0.05). Additionally, LR diets stimulated hepatic bile acid synthesis via upregulating the expression levels of cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 and cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1, and downregulating farnesol X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) expression levels (p < 0.05). A lowered SID Lys:NE ratio affected the colonic microbial composition, characterized by increased relative abundances of YRC22, Parabacteroides, Sphaerochaeta, and Bacteroides, alongside a decreased in the proportion of Roseburia, f_Lachnospiraceae_g_Clostridium, Enterococcus, Shuttleworthia, Exiguobacterium, Corynebacterium, Subdoligranulum, Sulfurospirillum, and Marinobacter (p < 0.05). The alterations in microbial composition were accompanied by a decrease in colonic butyrate concentration (p < 0.1). The metabolomic analysis revealed that LR diets affected primary bile acid synthesis and AMPK signaling pathway (p < 0.05). And the mantel analysis indicated that Parabacteroides, Sphaerochaeta, f_Lachnospiraceae_g_Clostridium, Shuttleworthia, and Marinobacter contributed to the alterations in body metabolism. A reduced dietary SID Lys:NE ratio improves energy metabolism, stimulates lipogenesis, and inhibits lipolysis in finishing pigs by regulating the AMPKα/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway and the FXR/SHP pathway. Parabacteroides and Sphaerochaeta benefited bile acids synthesis, whereas f_Lachnospiraceae_g_Clostridium, Shuttleworthia, and Marinobacter may contribute to the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. Overall, body metabolism and colonic microbiota collectively controlled the lipid metabolism in finishing pigs.

Initially co-ordinated by National Taiwan University from 1994, the program transitioned to the Taiwan Cetacean Society in 1999, and local governments took on a more prominent role after 2009. A comprehensive stranding database (1994–2018) has been maintained, which documented 1320 stranding events involving 1698 animals from at least 27 species. The most commonly stranded species include finless porpoises, bottlenose dolphins, Kogia spp., and Risso’s dolphins. The stranding rates varied annually and seasonally, with increases noted from an average of 16 events per year for the first 3 years to 44–58 events per year between 1997 and 2015, and a sharp rise to over 90 events per year for the period of the last three years. Seasonal variations were also significant, with higher stranding rates during the northeastern monsoon (NEM, October to next April) than that during southwestern monsoon (SWM, May to September). From the aspect of distribution, more frequent and even strandings occurred along the coast of northern Taiwan, while mass strandings were concentrated in the southwestern counties during NEM. Among all strandings, 390 events (29.5%) and 660 animals (38.9%) were live ones. Under great effort in rescuing and rehabilitating 52 cases, 15 cetacean individuals have been released since 2000. Additionally, there have been 56 mass strandings involving at least 11 species since 1994, predominated by pygmy killer whales, particularly during the NEM season along the southwest coast. This study not only contributes to our understanding of the stranding patterns and diversity of the cetaceans in Taiwan, but also provides valuable insights for future conservation strategies on cetaceans in the western Pacific.

Elevated levels of Pb can hinder insect growth and development, leading to apoptosis via mechanisms like oxidative damage. The midgut of silkworms is the main organ exposed to heavy metals. As an economically important lepidopteran model insect in China, heavy metal-induced stress on silkworms causes considerable losses in sericulture, thereby causing substantial economic damage. This study aimed to investigate Pb-induced detoxification-related genes in the midgut of silkworms using high-throughput sequencing methods to achieve a deeper comprehension of the genes’ reactions to lead exposure. This study identified 11,567 unigenes and 14,978 transcripts. A total of 1265 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened, comprising 907 upregulated and 358 downregulated genes. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) classification analysis revealed that the 1265 DEGs were distributed across biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. This suggests that the silkworm midgut may affect various organelle functions and biological processes, providing crucial clues for further exploration of DEG function. Additionally, the expression levels of 12 selected detoxification-related DEGs were validated using qRT-PCR, which confirmed the reliability of the RNA-seq results. This study not only provides new insights into the detoxification defense mechanisms of silkworms after Pb exposure, but also establishes a valuable foundation for further investigation into the molecular detoxification mechanisms in silkworms.

Differentiating between these murmurs can be challenging for practicing veterinarians, but this differentiation is essential to ensure the best prognosis for puppies having a congenital heart disease. Our study aimed to reveal how veterinarians manage puppies with a heart murmur. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was sent to Dutch and Belgian veterinary practices. Results: Data from 452 respondents were analyzed. Though 88% of the respondents find detecting a heart murmur easy, only 9% find differentiating innocent murmurs from pathologic murmurs in puppies easy. Of the respondents, only 80% recommend immediate additional examination when detecting a loud heart murmur during the first veterinary health check at 6 weeks of age. Most of the respondents are aware that normal growth and the absence of clinical signs do not exclude severe congenital heart disease. Of the respondents, 31% were uncertain whether early surgical intervention could lead to improved outcomes. Conclusions: Veterinarians are aware of the importance of echocardiography for puppies with a loud heart murmur, and recognize their limitations when differentiating an innocent from a pathological heart murmur in a puppy.

Thirty cows were assigned to three dietary groups: control (CON), treatment 1 (TRT 1; rumen-protected L-tryptophan, 20 g/cow/d), and treatment 2 (TRT 2; rumen-protected L-ascorbic acid, 20 g/cow/d). As the high-temperature period progressed, the decrease in milk yield and dry matter intake (DMI) in the TRT 1 and TRT 2 groups was lower than that in the CON group. The total protein level in the plasma of the TRT 1 group was higher than that in the CON group (p < 0.05). Milk melatonin concentration was higher in the TRT 1 group than in the CON and TRT 2 groups (p < 0.05). Thus, the present results indicate that rumen-protected L-tryptophan or L-ascorbic acid has positive effects in preventing declines in DMI and milk yield by reducing heat stress in Holstein cows. In particular, rumen-protected L-tryptophan is considered effective in increasing the melatonin concentration in milk.

Hundreds of deadly attacks take place annually, and mortality rates may range from 50% to 100%. Attitudes and perceptions towards crocodiles were studied using structured questionnaires among fisherfolk along the River Nile and the Sudd wetlands in South Sudan. Local communities used crocodiles for their meat and skin/leather trades. The meat is regarded to enhance longevity, sexual potency, and protection against witchcraft. Crocodiles are perceived as a main threat to lives and livelihoods as they restrict people’s freedom of movement along water bodies, attack livestock and humans, and devastate fishing equipment. To assess whether responses were influenced by the intensity of crocodile threats, published data on fatal crocodile attacks on humans and livestock were analysed using Generalised Linear Models (GLMs). This analysis indicated a direct link between the number of crocodile attacks and human attitudes. Crocodiles were generally feared and hated, and there was the agreement of the need to destroy breeding habitats. However, some attitudes were complex and nuanced as highlighted by the agreement of local communities on the need to destroy Nile Crocodile breeding habitats on the one hand and the need to establish crocodile sanctuaries as the the preferred strategy to mitigate risks and conflict on the other hand. There is a need for the creation of a crocodile sanctuary in the Sudd wetlands to minimise the risks of illegal hunting and to buffer the increasing pressure on crocodiles due to human population growth and economic upturn after the civil war.

Thirty-one handlers of search and rescue dogs voluntarily participated in this study. Nine dogs were selected to wear the Holter, and twenty-three were submitted to electrocardiographic recordings (one dog, excluded by Holter examination, was then included in the ECG group). Our results showed few cardiac rhythm alterations, such as escape beats, premature ventricular beat, and depression and elevation of the ST segment, particularly during the working phase in the Holter group and during recovery time immediately after activity in the electrocardiographic group. Detected alterations in real working conditions may provide more information than routine checks, and Holter monitoring can be more functional. However, not all dogs tolerate wearing the Holter harness, and more time is thus needed to apply the equipment. In addition, the results are not immediate, and the absence of water is essential because it would damage the equipment.

This was achieved through a controlled WSSV challenge assay and the analysis of phenotypic values of five traits: body weight (BW), overall length (OL), body length (BL), tail length (TL), and survival hour post-infection (HPI). The analysis included test data from a total of 1017 individuals belonging to 20 families, of which 293 individuals underwent whole-genome resequencing, resulting in 18,137,179 high-quality SNP loci being obtained. Three methods, including pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (pBLUP), genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), and single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) were utilized. Compared to the pBLUP model, the heritability of growth-related traits obtained from GBLUP and ssGBLUP was lower, whereas the heritability of WSSV resistance was higher. Both the GBLUP and ssGBLUP models significantly enhanced prediction accuracy. Specifically, the GBLUP model improved the prediction accuracy of BW, OL, BL, TL, and HPI by 4.77%, 21.93%, 19.73%, 19.34%, and 63.44%, respectively. Similarly, the ssGBLUP model improved prediction accuracy by 10.07%, 25.44%, 25.72%, 19.34%, and 122.58%, respectively. The WSSV resistance trait demonstrated the most substantial enhancement using both genomic prediction models, followed by body size traits (e.g., OL, BL, and TL), with BW showing the least improvement. Furthermore, the choice of models minimally impacted the assessment of genetic and phenotypic correlations. Genetic correlations among growth traits ranged from 0.767 to 0.999 across models, indicating high levels of positive correlations. Genetic correlations between growth and WSSV resistance traits ranged from (−0.198) to (−0.019), indicating low levels of negative correlations. This study assured significant advantages of the GBLUP and ssGBLUP models over the pBLUP model in the genetic parameter estimation of growth and WSSV resistance in L. vannamei, providing a foundation for further breeding programs.

As an archipelago, the Philippines has a geographic advantage when it comes to the risk of ASF transmission. However, since its introduction to the Philippines in 2019, it has proliferated not only in backyard and commercial farms but also in wild pig populations. While certain parts of the country were more affected than others, the epidemiologic features of ASF necessitate that all affected areas must be closely monitored and that confirmed cases be treated with the utmost care. With the very limited data on ASF epidemiology and surveillance in the Philippines, future efforts to combat ASF must place even greater emphasis on improved prevention and control strategies. It is worth mentioning that the government’s efforts toward comprehensive ASF surveillance and epidemiological investigation into the possible ASFV sources or transmission pathways are the most important measures in the prevention and control of ASF outbreaks. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the current swine industry and ASF situation in the Philippines, which includes its epidemiology, surveillance, prevention, and control strategies.

Lesions make the skin vulnerable to potential infection by pathogens present in the aquatic environment. In this way, wound repair has barely been studied in gilthead sea bream. Thus, this study investigated the modulation of peripheral neuro-endocrine and tissue repair markers at the transcriptional level in the skin of teleost fish subjected to mechanical damage above or below the lateral line (dorsal and ventral lesions, respectively). Samples were evaluated using RT-qPCR at 2-, 4-, and 20-days post-injury. Fish with a ventral lesion presented a trend of progressive increase in the expressions of corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh), pro-opiomelanocortin-A (pomca), proenkephalin-B (penkb), cholecystokinin (cck), oxytocin (oxt), angiotensinogen (agt), and (less pronounced) somatostatin-1B (sst1b). By contrast, fish with a dorsal lesion registered no significant increase or biological trend for the genes evaluated at the different sampling times. Collectively, the results show a rapid and more robust response of neuro-endocrine and tissue repair markers in the injuries below than above the lateral line, which could be attributable to their proximity to vital organs.

Among the latter, how this herbivore interacts with forage resources is important. The objective of the study was to describe the main attributes of the diet of this deer in rangelands adjacent to agricultural areas of the foothills of the Tarapacá Region, Chile. The botanical composition of the diet (BCD) was determined by microhistology of feces and fecal nitrogen (NF, %) was measured in two contrasting seasons (rainy summer and dry winter). From the BCD and FN, their relative diversity (J) and crude protein percentage were estimated. In the BCD, Medicago sativa dominated (27.6 ± 8.2% vs. 53.9 ± 9.2%, in rainy summer and dry end winter, respectively), followed by herbaceous dicots (46.2 ± 9.4% vs. 19.4 ± 8.7%) and shrubby species (21.5 ± 7.8% vs. 23.4 ± 7.0%), from rangelands. The contribution of grasses and graminoid species was low, not exceeding 3% and 0.4% of the diet, respectively, with no differences between seasons of the year. Intake of horticultural crop species was marginal (1.3 ± 1.3%), being detected only in the wet season. Diet relative diversity was higher during the wet period (0.75 ± 0.07) compared to the dry period (0.58 ± 0.06), since in the first period it was possible to find a greater number of palatable species. There were no significant differences in the FN attributed to the time of the year (average of 1.8 ± 0.19%), which indicates that the diet of this deer would be stable in terms of its protein quality. These FN levels estimate sufficient dietary protein content to satisfy maintenance and early pregnancy, but these could be limiting during late gestation and lactation.

Hemogram-derived inflammatory markers are known to serve as markers of pathological conditions; however, their diagnostic value in feline CKD is still unknown. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate selected hemogram-derived inflammatory markers (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and the systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII)) in cats at different clinical stages of CKD. Eighty-eight client-owned cats with CKD and thirty-two healthy control cats were included. Cats with CKD were divided into two groups: early CKD (IRIS stage 1 and 2; 62 cats) and progressed CKD (IRIS stage 3 and 4; 26 cats). The values of inflammatory markers were compared between the two CKD groups and the control group. All investigated hemogram-derived inflammatory markers were significantly (p < 0.05) greater in cats with advanced CKD than in those in the other two groups. Additionally, we demonstrated a statistically significant weak to moderate correlation between serum urea, creatinine, selected hematologic and urinary parameters, and the investigated inflammatory markers in cats with CKD. Chronic inflammation can be easily and inexpensively assessed with hemogram-derived markers.

Despite extensive research, detailed disease pathophysiology and the differences between MEA and SEA are still not completely understood. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology, broadly used in clinical practice and in equine asthma research, has limited means to represent the inflammatory status in the lower airways. Lipidomics is a field of science that can be utilized in investigating cellular mechanisms and cell-to-cell interactions. Studies in lipidomics have a broad variety of foci, of which fatty acid and lipid mediator profile analyses and global lipidomics have been implemented in veterinary medicine. As many crucial proinflammatory and proresolving mediators are lipids, lipidomic studies offer an interesting yet largely unexplored means to investigate inflammatory reactions in equine airways. The aim of this review article is to collect and summarize the findings of recent lipidomic studies on equine airway inflammation.

All pedigrees included 463,282 animals dating back to 1914. The inbreeding coefficients for each animal in the pedigree were computed using the software CFC 1.0. Length of productive life (LPL) was defined as the time (days) from the first calving to culling, death, or censoring. The influence of inbreeding on the length of productive life was calculated and tested using the Weibull proportional hazards model. The average inbreeding coefficient, the average number of discrete generation equivalents, and the average longest ancestral path for inbred animals were 0.01, 6.59, and 13.08, respectively. While the largest decrease in the mean coefficient of inbreeding was observed from the year of birth 1995 (F = 1.50%) to 2001 (F = 0.59%), an increasing trend of inbreeding in the population was found from 2003 onwards. A weak but significant effect of inbreeding on the length of productive life of Simmental cows was confirmed using survival analysis.

To our knowledge, renal ASL-MRI has not previously been performed in dogs. The aim of this pilot study was to determine parameters essential for ALS-MRI-based quantification of RBF in dogs: T1, blood (longitudinal relaxation time), λ (blood tissue partition coefficient) and TI (inversion time). A Beagle was scanned at 3T with a multi-TI ASL sequence, with TIs ranging from 250 to 2500 ms, to determine the optimal TI value. The T1 of blood for dogs was determined by scanning a blood sample with a 2D IR TSE sequence. The water content of the dog’s kidney was determined by analyzing kidney samples from four dogs with a moisture analyzer and was subsequently used to calculate λ. The optimal TI and the measured values for T1,blood, and λ were 2000 ms, 1463 ms and 0.91 mL/g, respectively. These optimized parameters for dogs resulted in lower RBF values than those obtained from inline generated RBF maps. In conclusion, this study determined preliminary parameters essential for ALS-MRI-based RBF quantification in dogs. Further research is needed to confirm these values, but it may help guide future research.

The diagnosis is made through the observation of clinical manifestations, and despite its association with Chelonid Alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) as the etiological agent, the expression of the disease may also be related to immunological and environmental factors caused by anthropic degradation of the environment. Thus, this review aims to elucidate what is known about this disease globally, and especially in various regions of Brazil, promoting a better understanding of its evolution, spatiotemporal prevalence, and relationship with human activities. Furthermore, the review explores the molecular biology of ChHV5, including its genomic structure, replication cycle, and mechanisms of pathogenesis. The role of environmental factors, such as temperature and pollution, in modulating ChHV5 infection and FP development is also discussed. Additionally, the review summarizes current diagnostic methods for detecting ChHV5 infection in sea turtles, highlighting the importance of early detection and monitoring for effective disease management and conservation efforts. Finally, the review outlines future research directions aimed at improving our understanding of ChHV5 and developing strategies for FP control and prevention in sea turtle populations.
