        "text": "In 1989 Beijing's Tiananmen Square became the focus for large-scale protests, which were crushed by China's Communist rulers.\n\nThe events produced one of the most iconic photos of the 20th Century - a lone protester standing in front of a line of army tanks.\n\nThe events remain a highly sensitive topic in China and one of the few remaining public memorials in Hong Kong has now been removed.\n\nWhat led up to the events?\n\nIn the 1980s, China was going through huge changes.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party began to allow some private companies and foreign investment.\n\nLeader Deng Xiaoping hoped to boost the economy and raise living standards.\n\nHowever, the move brought with it corruption, while at the same time raising hopes for greater political openness.\n\nThe Communist Party was divided between those urging more rapid change and hardliners wanting to maintain strict state control.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, student-led protests started.\n\nThose taking part included people who had lived abroad and been exposed to new ideas and higher standards of living.\n\nHow did the protests grow?\n\nIn spring 1989, the protests grew, with demands for greater political freedom.\n\nProtesters were spurred on by the death of a leading politician, Hu Yaobang, who had overseen some of the economic and political changes.\n\nHe had been pushed out of a top position in the party by political opponents two years earlier.\n\nTens of thousands gathered on the day of Hu's funeral, in April, calling for greater freedom of speech and less censorship.\n\nIn the following weeks, protesters gathered in Tiananmen Square, with numbers estimated to be up to one million at their largest.\n\nThe square is one of Beijing's most famous landmarks.\n\nWhat was the government's response?\n\nAt first, the government took no direct action against the protesters.\n\nParty officials disagreed on how to respond, some backing concessions, others wanting to take a harder line.\n\nThe hardliners won the debate, and in the last two weeks of May, martial law was declared in Beijing.\n\nOn 3 to 4 June, troops began to move towards Tiananmen Square, opening fire, crushing and arresting protesters to regain control of the area.\n\nWho was Tank Man?\n\nOn 5 June, a man faced down a line of tanks heading away from the square.\n\nHe was carrying two shopping bags and was filmed walking to block the tanks from moving past.\n\nHe was pulled away by two men.\n\nIt's not known what happened to him but he's become the defining image of the protests.\n\nHow many people died in the protests?\n\nNo-one knows for sure how many people were killed.\n\nAt the end of June 1989, the Chinese government said 200 civilians and several dozen security personnel had died."
