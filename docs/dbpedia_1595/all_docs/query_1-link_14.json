        "meta_description": "1924 – 1969 Surrealists painted unnerving, illogical scenes. Their works are distinguished by the use of allusions and paradoxical combinations of forms. The aim of Surrealism was to “resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality”. Surreality is the combination of a dream and reality. Therefore, the main principle of Surrealism was the transfer of the reality dominating in people’s subconscious through free associations. The representatives of this art movement absurdly combined naturalistic images through collage and “ready-made” technology. Surrealism has developed under the great influence of the theory of psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud. The founder of Surrealism was André Breton, a French writer. Key artists: Salvador Dalí Max Ernst Key ideas – The Surrealists considered art to be the main instrument of liberation. – The primary goals of the Surrealists were spiritual elevation and separation of the spirit from the material. – One of the most important values was freedom, as well as irrationality. – Often, the surrealists performed their work under the influence of hypnosis, alcohol or hunger, in order to reach the depths of their subconscious.",

        "text": "A Swiss sculptor and lithographer, artist and graphic artist, collector of archaic and ancient works of art, a prominent representative of the avant-garde in his country and Europe. The artist spent more than a decade in Paris, became a member of a Surrealist group organized and headed by Andre Breton. The latter included one of Serge Brignoni's lithographs in the famous illustrated book “Surrealism in 1947”.The artist as a representative of the Paris School was a participant in the Venice Biennale and prestigious international exhibitions of surreal art in England and America. His contribution to the development of avant-garde art in Switzerland is considerable.Close to Surrealism at the artistic and intellectual level, Serge Brignoni used complex metamorphoses of the image of the world. Veins and branches, eyes and viscera, sea creatures and endless cosmic landscapes, spaces and figures, animated by floral fragments, show his attention to nature. A wide range of methods he used to create works of art - sculpture, collage, engraving, painting and drawing - gives S. Brignoni’s works the status of “analog biology”.In 1985, the Swiss artist donated his most valuable and vast collection of art from Oceania and Indonesia to Lugano - in this city, the Museum of Non-European Cultures “Villa Heleneum” was opened four years later.\n\nAn American sculptor and designer of Japanese descent. Isamu Noguchi was one of the most prominent and famous sculptors of the twentieth century in the United States. Throughout his life, he was engaged in art experiments, created original sculptures, design of furniture and ceramics, architectural and landscape projects. His extraordinary and bold style combined traditional and avant-garde elements, setting a new standard for contemporary art.Noguchi did not lose touch with his historical homeland and spent a lot of time in Japan, opened a studio there. The artist regularly traveled around the world. The harmony of Japanese gardens and ceramics, the subtlety and grace of Chinese calligraphy, the gracefulness of Italian marble sculptures, the monumentality and brilliant simplicity of the art of the Indians of ancient America were reflected in his work.The sculptor's work was widely appreciated in the United States in 1938 after he created a large sculpture symbolizing freedom of the press for the Associated Press building in New York. This work was the first of many public facilities installed in various cities around the world. The works of Isamu Noguchi, from children's playgrounds, city squares and squares to complete garden complexes, reflects his faith in the social significance of sculpture, which makes art accessible to everyone.\n\nAn American artist, designer and avant-garde filmmaker. Joseph Cornell worked primarily in installation and assembly techniques, using everyday things in unexpected combinations. He had no art education, worked as a seller of fabrics and showed his artistic talents only by the age of thirty, creating a new and interesting style in contemporary art, which had many followers.The impact of Cornell's works on the subconscious and mysteriousness makes him related to Surrealists and Dadaists. However, the self-taught artist never referred himself to any of the modernist or avant-garde movements. He led a very secluded life on the outskirts of the city with his sick brother and mother; rarely spoke in public, but maintained friendly relations with most modern American artists. Cornell was a deeply religious man and an ardent supporter of \"Christian science\", which left a significant imprint on his entire work.Joseph Cornell is best known for his original installations, where in a small often closed on all sides space everything acquires an entirely different meaning and causes a wide variety of associations. The artist’s most famous works are glass boxes in which he placed various objects: old photographs, newspaper scraps, and other small items. These “shadow boxes,” as the author himself called them, had a great influence on the development of installation, assemblage, and other types of contemporary art.\n\nA Swiss sculptor, painter and graphic artist, one of the largest sculptors of the 20th century, a vivid representative of the avant-garde.Giacometti, who studied the art of painting and sculpture in Geneva and Paris, experimented with cubism and futurism, was interested in primitive sculpture technique. For some time, he worked with a surreal French group and created strange objects testifying to cruelty, interest in eroticism and at the same time the author’s dreaminess and humanism.After he suddenly departed from Surrealism, Giacometti again created more figurative and vital works. The mature master created his most famous works - a series of elongated and fragile figures, similar to skeletons and made not by carving but by modelling in clay or plaster without thorough study and smoothing of the surface of sculptures and figurines. These works are extremely highly valued in the art market, and viewers are always incredibly interested in them.Giacometti wrote articles for catalogues of many exhibitions and periodicals, outlining extraordinary thoughts, and also kept diaries where he introduced memoirs, observations and explanations to his works. They are an important document of the avant-garde era in art and culture.The most highly regarded (literally and figuratively) outstanding classic of world sculpture was so extraordinary that he did not have direct followers, but influenced the entire world of fine art. He was the idol of Salvador Dali, Henry Moore and other famous artists.\n\nA famous English sculptor, one of the most prominent people in the art of Great Britain of the 20th century. Barbara Hepworth worked in those times when female artists, especially sculptors, were rare. Along with her contemporaries Ben Nicholson and Henry Moore, she considerably influenced the development of British art in general and abstract sculpture.Hepworth’s favourite materials were wood and stone, from which she created biomorphic abstract compositions using the cutting technique. The artist developed the principle of \"hollow form\" and for the first time created a through sculpture, which is widely used by many sculptors of our time. Hepworth coordinated her extraordinary and mysterious images with the surrounding space and gave them a resemblance to natural forms and lines. The sculptor’s work is characterized by a special rhythm characteristic of the laws of nature itself.Together with her husband Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth was the leader of the St. Ives Artists' Colony, where she lived from the beginning of World War II until her death. She was also one of the founders of the Unit One art movement, whose participants were avant-garde artists and sculptors, and which managed to combine Surrealism and Abstractionism in British art.\n\nA famous American artist and sculptor, whose works adorn squares of the cities of the USA, Europe and Latin America. A son and grandson of sculptors, Alexander Calder, was educated as an engineer and applied his knowledge in the field of sculpture, which allowed him to create a completely original, innovative approach to this kind of art.Calder became known worldwide as the inventor of \"wire sculpture\". Having abandoned the traditional heavy materials - clay, gypsum and bronze, he created airy designs in which the shape of the object is depicted very simplistically and schematically. His wire figurines resemble a pencil drawing in space and amaze you with their laconicism and elegance of execution.Another invention of the sculptor is the so-called \"mobiles\" – those are dynamic constructions that are driven by the force of the wind, the laws of gravity and in some cases by an electric motor. These works are completely abstract and small in size, in contrast to the more stable and monumental \"stables\" of the sculptor, which perfectly complement the urban landscape. One of the most famous and large-scale creations of Alexander Calder is his work \"Man\", located in the center of Montreal.\n\nThe most famous and significant English sculptor of the post-war period, one of the founders of modernist British sculpture. Moore significantly influenced the gradual transformation of British sculpture from provincial to avant-garde, which not only corresponded to European concepts of modern art, but also introduced its themes and means of plastic expression.Moore became world-famous thanks to his sculptures designed for open space, which are installed in many large cities around the world. These works, depicting mainly semi-abstract human figures, impress you with the harmony of their forms and musicality of smooth, winding lines. They reveal the eternal themes of the beauty of nature and the attractiveness of the female body, the spiritual closeness of a man and a woman, the selfless love of a mother for her child - all that makes our world more beautiful.The sculptor preferred to cut his works from a whole piece of wood or stone, and began to use plaster and bronze casting only in the late period of his career. In addition to sculpture, Moore is known as a wonderful draftsman. His most significant works were impressive images of London citizens hiding in subway stations during Nazi bombings.\n\nAn American artist who was born and worked in France, one of the most famous representatives of Surrealism. Yves Tanguy never studied painting professionally. However, when he once saw the work of Italian Surrealist Giorgio de Chirico, he left the service in the merchant fleet and devoted himself to painting forever. Brave, bright and eccentric, the artist intrigued and shocked the audience, both with his extraordinary work and unpredictable behavior.Tanguy was one of the first to use the technique of “automatic painting” in his work, a method in which the artist paints associative images not thinking about what he is depicting and allowing the subconscious to penetrate the canvas freely. The result of these experiments was the appearance of surreal objects and non-existent animals, which the artist placed on the background of an incredibly endless landscape.During the Second World War, the artist left dangerous Europe. He permanently moved to the United States - the homeland of his wife Kay Sage, who was also a Surrealist artist. In America, Tanguy often arranged exhibitions of his paintings together with other artists of this art movement and had a significant influence on the formation and development of modern painting, especially Abstract Expressionism. His extraordinary fantastic works made him an internationally famous and financially successful artist.\n\nA Belgian artist-innovator, a bright representative of Surrealism. Pictures of Paul Delvaux are inspired by secret desires, subconscious fears and vivid impressions from childhood. The painter’s art is famous, first of all, for its naked women, silent and motionless, like statues, in an atmosphere of mystery and emptiness.Most of Paul Delvaux’s creative career developed during World War II and the occupation of his home country. This was one of the reasons why an anxious mood and restless motives appeared in his paintings; although this was expressed not in a direct way but through an appeal to the psyche of a man and his subconscious.Even though Delvaux never officially belonged to surrealist groups and did not even associate himself with this movement, he was close to many of the surrealists. The artist closely communicated with Rene Magritte, who had a noticeable influence on him, and Andre Breton, the founder of Surrealism.In his work, the artist did not use abstract objects, as his colleagues did. On the contrary, the master’s paintings are striking in their realism and correctness of forms. Paul Delvaux created the stunning atmosphere of mystery in his works using his methods, combining extraordinary images with the symbolism and incomprehensibility of the plot.\n\nA Spanish (Catalan) painter and sculptor, whose work had a huge impact on the entire generation of modern artists. Joan Miro's paintings are the earliest surrealistic works. They served as the basis for the further formation and development of the style that is extremely popular to this day.Joan Miro tried his hand in various modernist and avant-garde styles of European painting, but never stopped on one of them completely, constantly improving and enriching his artistic method, experimenting with different painting techniques and methods. The result of these experiments was his painting style based on surrealism. This is what allowed the artist to rethink the basic principles of fine art in accordance with his original vision of the surrounding reality.The unique world of Joan Miró is full of unique images and symbols. They are presented in the form of pure plastic signs located in an empty space; they are not completely abstract but rather resemble naive art or drawings of children. Miro’s paintings consist of geometric, right or wrong figures, a dance of twisting lines and small details that have mystical meaning and create an indescribable atmosphere of each work.\n\nAn English avant-garde artist, an active participant in the non-durable but radical movement “Vorticism” that appeared in London just before the First World War.Edward Wadsworth not only signed the Manifesto of the new association, but also created graphic compositions for Blast magazine, working closely with its chief editor, Wyndham Lewis. Having placed the magazine “Explosion” in Wadsworth’s hand in his canvas “Vorticists in the restaurant de la Tour Eiffel: Spring, 1915”, his colleague W. Roberts emphasized his significant role in the group. This was fundamentally important in the 1960s, when interest in the movement became more intense.The artist traveled a lot and contributed to the further development of the British avant-garde, introducing ideas of Surrealism into it. He was a member of such significant creative associations as the Paris group Abstraction-Création.\n\nAn Italian artist, an outstanding representative of the second wave of Futurism in painting, one of the first Surrealists in his country. Enrico Prampolini was an unusually gifted man who showed his talent in many branches of art. His contemporaries knew him as a theater set designer and designer, as well as an architect who created several fundamental works. Together with Gerardo Dottori, the artist worked in the style of aerial painting, creating works based on the feeling of flight, the features of the air perspective and speed.Prampolini was one of the authors of the Manifesto of Mechanical Art, which proclaimed the dominance of machines in the world of the future and the close connection of new technologies with painting. The artist believed that contemporary art should be based on the use of mechanical elements from the world of industry. In his works, he praised the coherence and rhythm inherent in the work of mechanisms.The painter’s art developed in close contact with the avant-garde movements of Europe. Prampolini knew Paris Cubists, and also took an active part in the work of the German Bauhaus movement. Being a supporter of the abstract geometric construction of the composition, which is characteristic of Italian Futurism, Prampolini gradually moved to a complete abstraction, including elements of surrealism.\n\nAn Italian painter, a forerunner of Surrealism. Together with Futurist Carlo Carra, Giorgio de Chirico was the creator of metaphysical painting - the most original and important style in Italian art of the early twentieth century. Despite the fact that this style did not last long, it became the main one for the artist and brought him worldwide fame. De Chirico's metaphysical paintings had a great influence on Surrealists, who saw in them the expression of the unconscious and illogical that they aspired to.The work of Giorgio de Chirico originates in German philosophy, in particular in the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, as well as in the work of Symbolist Arnold Böcklin. From them, he drew interest in the symbolism of objects and the interaction of the form and environment. Like his teachers, the artist paid much attention to the process of self-improvement and observation, trying to comprehend the inner harmony of the universe.Closely connected with the Paris avant-garde movement, de Chirico created original art, which inexplicably combined his love for classics and the feelings of emptiness and loss that are characteristic of contemporary art. In the artist’s paintings, deserted streets and towers coexist with symbolic objects and mannequins, which are not connected logically. All this, created in bright colours, creates a sense of artificiality of reality and its conventionality.\n\nA Belarusian painter, graphic artist, illustrator and stage designer of Jewish origin, a master of applied and monumental art of the 20th century. Marc Chagall became one of the most internationally recognized creators. When many of his fellow peers conducted ambitious experiments, often leading to abstraction, he sacredly believed in the power of figurative art, which he supported with his work.Despite the avant-garde ideas he perceived, he remained a romantic. Born in Belarus, Chagall worked in Russia and France, where he immediately became a prominent figure at the École de Paris, and later in the United States and the Middle East. Travels confirmed his image of the archetypal \"wandering Jew\", who believed that art destroys borders and estates.The influence of Marc Chagall is as vast as the number of styles that he assimilated in his art. Never completely agreeing with any movement, he mixed many of the visual elements of cubism, fauvism, symbolism and surrealism into his lyrically emotional aesthetics with the invariable presence of Jewish and Slavic folklore.Chagall, like Picasso, is a vivid example of a modern artist who created many works - paintings (oil, gouache, watercolour), frescoes, etching, stained glass, ceramic products, theater decorations and costumes.\n\nThe most famous Chilean artist, sculptor and architect, the leader of Latin American modernist art. Roberto Matta worked in the style of surrealism and was a close friend and associate of Salvador Dali, with whom they were united by the idea of ​​unconscious painting and a free flow of creativity without the intervention of intelligence or any system.The artist’s art is truly international. Born in Chile and living in almost all the capitals of Europe, as well as in the USA, Matta combined a wide variety of art styles in his work. He was never limited to one style, manner and materials, being an innovative artist, not tired of doing experiments. His unique style had a significant impact on the development of such a popular art movement as Abstract Expressionism.The most famous among the artist’s paintings are his surrealistic canvases from the Psychological Morphology series, which demonstrate an artificial reality filled with metaphors and symbolic figures. In the 1940s, Matta was distracted from studying subconscious and turning to social topics. In a series of works entitled Social Morphologies, he depicted complex mechanical objects and distorted human forms, symbolizing the injustices and horrors of the war.\n\nA Belgian painter and draftsman, lithographer and illustrator.Frits van den Berghe was one of the most interesting Expressionist artists of the first half of the twentieth century and a prominent Surrealist. Starting his career under the influence of Symbolist artists and Lumists grouped in Laethem-Saint-Martin, he wrote a manifesto together with his friend, artist Gustave De Smet, who opposed Impressionism. As a member of the second wave of Laethem-Saint-Martin school, Berghe followed the latest trends in the visual arts of his country.The time of the First World War, a period of existential doubts when the artist lived in the Netherlands, was marked by his fascination with Cubist painting by French artist Henri Le Focognier, as well as an interest in Futurism and German Expressionism.At the end of the 1920s, having visited an exhibition, where, in particular, paintings of Ernst and Miro were exhibited, the artist moved away from other styles and devoted his art to attempts to overcome the barriers between real and irrational phenomena, life and death. Berge revealed his new surrealistic concept, in particular, in a theme that was original for this style - floral still lifes.Although Berghe's paintings often resemble works of Ernst and Ensor; his creations are the original Flemish version of Surrealism, with its great picturesqueness and expression. Berghe's works (the list of works, compiled in 1966, consists of 430 items) are presented in most Belgian museums and galleries in Europe.\n\nA Romanian painter and sculptor of Jewish origin, the main representative of the vanguard of this country in the first half of the 20th century and during the post-war period. The artist made a significant part of his creative career in France. Although Victor Brauner, after his early post-impressionist and expressionist experiences, contributed to every avant-garde movement, much of his work fits into the concept of Surrealism.Active in the cultural life of his country, the artist tried to develop avant-garde movements - he founded the magazine “75 HP” in Bucharest, wrote the “Manifesto of Picto-Poetry,” and organized exhibitions of Dadaists and Surrealists. However, the threat of falling into the dungeons of the Nazis forced the artist to settle in France.Brauner was an active and influential member of the Surrealist association headed by Andre Breton; however, according to art expert, his art stood apart due to the artist’s unbridled imagination and, most importantly, his serious passion for esoteric ideas and the authentic art of different nationalities. This style made the artist original, especially after he lost his eye – the same one, which he depicted as knocked out in his self-portrait seven years before it happened in real.Victor Brauner was a participant in major surrealist exhibitions; in 1966 (in the year of his death), he was chosen to represent France at the Venice Biennale. He willed to make the inscription, \"Painting is life, real life, my life\" on the grave plate of the Montmartre cemetery.\n\nArshile Gorky (his real name was Vostanik Manoug Adoian) was an American artist of Armenian descent, an outstanding artist of the USA of the twentieth century. He was a vivid representative of Surrealism and one of the founders of Abstract Expressionism, a movement that affirmed the independence and uniqueness of American fine art in the world.Vostanik Manoug Adoian decided to change his name after immigrating to the United States, where he began a completely new life, leaving behind extreme poverty and deprivation. The greatest shock for the artist was the demise of his mother, who died of hunger in his arms in 1919. The influence of this event is noticeable in many works of the artist, especially in the portraits of his mother, the variations of which he created throughout his career.The life of Arshile Gorky, which ended in suicide, was full of tragedy, and his personality is surrounded by a halo of mystery and secrets. The artist himself preferred to distort the facts of his biography, creating various myths about his origin, childhood and student years. These incredible inventions, however, could not overshadow his outstanding achievements in painting. The work of Arshile Gorky is a unique phenomenon that is difficult to characterize as a manifestation of one of the existing styles. It is a transitional stage between classical painting and avant-garde and had a significant impact on the development of modern painting in the United States.\n\nAn innovative Czech artist, photographer, graphic artist and theater decorator, poet and art theorist, the brightest figure of European Surrealism of the 20th century. Jindrich Styrsky is also considered a representative of the Paris school of painting, since he lived and worked in France for a considerable time.The student of the Prague Academy of Arts was a part of Czech artistic bohemia and national avant-garde associations during its development between the two world wars - first in the Devestil group, then in the Manes group, and later in the surrealist community, one of the founders of which J. Styrsky became in 1934. In addition, the artist stood at the origins of the emergence of avant-garde photographic art and new scenography in Prague - he ran the Free Theater of the Czech capital.In the 1930s, Styrsky was the editor of the private magazine “The Erotic Revue” with illustrations from many famous Czech artists. The artist supplemented each issue with his collages. Among the most important surrealistic works is “Emily Comes to Me in a Dream”, which was published accompanied by erotic photomontages by the author and psychoanalytic interpretation of B. Brook. It greatly accelerated the overcoming of taboos and censorship of the bourgeois culture of that time.Jindrich Styrsky is a very peculiar, and, therefore, is not just a readable artist of Czech interwar art. His works are approved by modern European avant-garde classics and are presented in the most visited museums and galleries of the Czech Republic.\n\nA Spanish artist, sculptor and poet, an outstanding figure of Spanish Surrealism, along with Salvador Dali and Joan Miro. Oscar Dominguez was an ambiguous and controversial artist whose life ended tragically. As a child, he had acromegaly, which resulted in deformation of the bones of his face and limbs. Oscar’s non-standard appearance caused profound spiritual experiences, which were reflected in many of his works, especially self-portraits.Paintings of the Spanish artist reflect the events of his life and are often provocatively shocking. They show everything that usually hides deep in the subconscious and is considered dirty and obscene. Dominguez often used the method of distorting objects and compared incompatible things, creating a strange and eerie atmosphere in his paintings.The artist is also known as the author of the popular decalcomania method that was popular among Surrealists. The essence of this technique is in the chaotic application of a thick layer of paint on the surface, followed by the imposition of a second sheet on it, resulting in a fancy imprint. With its unpredictable effects, decalcomania presented new ideas to artists and awakened their imagination. Andre Breton included this method in his famous \"Surrealism Handbook\", thus recognising the significant contribution of Dominguez in the common matter of the approval of this art movement.\n\nA Russian artist and graphic artist, discoverer of new paths in the visual arts of the 20th century. He is considered the founder of mystical surrealism nine years earlier than paintings by Salvador Dali became known and the inventor of new anatomical (X-ray) painting, \"new rayonism\".Art critics note that Tchelitchew, who was a student of A. Exter in Kyiv and went to France early, influenced Picasso, including his «blue» and «pink» periods. Clowns, artists, and sometimes famous personalities look at the viewer from the canvases of that time. However, the artist did not create Cubist paintings after his earliest period. The Paris period includes his painting «Concert» that was sold at Christie’s auction in 2016 for almost $ 2 million and the price of which was much higher than the price of Dali's paintings exhibited there at the same time.By the 1950s, Tchelitchew's surrealism was somewhat overcome by Abstract Expressionism that entered the avant-garde art market. Nevertheless, even the artist’s last series of geometric abstractions have a mystical intensity that anticipates the psychedelic idealism of the 1960s. The “internal landscapes” of the master are recalled in the aesthetics of op-art.The talented and unique painter was appreciated by his famous contemporaries in Europe and the USA; it is hard to underestimate his influence on the development of art. At the same time, the artist's name was almost unknown in his motherland by the beginning of the 21st century. The Moscow gallery «Our Artists» organized his first solo exhibition in 2006; five years later, it presented more than 70 of his paintings and repeated his vernissage called «Tchelitchew. Encore Exhibition\" in 2013.\n\nA Swiss avant-garde artist, graphic designer and lithographer, master of book illustration and monumental painting, as well as a writer.Otto Tschumi organically perceived the canons of surrealistic manifestos requiring mental independence, as this was very consonant with his creative independence.The artist participated in numerous group exhibitions of this movement, including in America, but did not join any of the surrealist associations. Having developed his style, he perfected and modified it until the end of his long creative career of more than 60 years.His most significant work in book illustration was the drawings for Herman Melville's novel “Moby Dick” (the edition of 1942, Paris). As a sought-after monumentalist, Otto Tschumi painted several public buildings in Bern and other cities in Switzerland in the post-war period. The largest was the fresco for the office of Berne Customs (1955). As a writer, he received a state prize for the promotion of Berne literature in 1970.A museum was opened in the house of Otto and Beatrice Tschumi, where, in particular, the correspondence with Hans and Sophie Arp, Hermann Hesse, Max Bill, Meret Oppenheim, valuable for the history of European avant-garde art, is stored. The artist’s paintings are presented at all museums and art galleries in his country.The Surrealist artist, along with Alberto Giacometti, Serge Brignoni and Max Seligman, is considered one of the most important Surrealists of Europe that considerably influenced the fine art of their country in XX century.\n\nA Greek artist, stage designer, illustrator and famous poet, whose works are translated into all European languages ​​and continuously reprinted. One of the leading and most consistent representatives of the Greek generation of the 30s, as well as a leading master of the surreal movement of his country.Growing up on the Plaka near the Acropolis, the artist lived in Constantinople and in Paris, where he became acquainted with works of art and literary traditions. He received education at the Athens Higher School of Fine Arts and later devoted a lot of effort working as a teacher at the famous Polytechnic Institute of Athens and restoration activities in the post-war period. Nicos Engonopoulos was rightly called the Master of Colors and Poems; in 1966, he was awarded the prestigious Order of George I for his achievements in the field of fine arts; in 1971, he was awarded the Order of the Phoenix for his literary works. He was twice awarded the First State Prize of Greece in the field of culture.Paintings of Engonopoulos, a prominent representative of early Surrealism, were shown at his numerous solo exhibitions; he participated in all significant Pan-Greek exhibitions, including architectural and theatrical ones. His works were demonstrated in New York and Rome, Venice and Vancouver, in Ottawa and other cities of the world.Special occupations of Nicos Engonopoulos during his whole creative career were designing books, painting churches, designing clothes and creating projects of decorations for theater productions of various cultural centers of the country.\n\nAn outstanding Latvian artist - painter and graphic artist, master of book illustration.After graduating from the graphic and painting department of the Latvian Academy of Arts, Maya Tabaka as an aspiring Soviet artist had a rare opportunity to have a two-year internship in West Germany. The time she spent among the artists of the Berlin New Fine Arts association allowed Tabaka's extraordinary talent to feel the \"wind under the wings\". German art experts continue to call the artist \"a bird of paradise\" till this day – the impression she made with spectacular plots and brilliant painting was great. German galleries hold portraits of Maija Tabaka by Dieter Masuhr and Wolf Vostell. The latter is often reproduced - this is a close-up of a face with spots of paint on it and a camera instead of a nose.The artist was also famous in her motherland – she became a member of the Union of Artists and People's Artist of the USSR, was awarded prizes and awards (medal \"Three Stars\", etc.), as well as the title of Honorary Citizen of Jurmala. Documentary films about the famous artist were also made. Paintings of Maija Tabaka are not only at the major museums, galleries and private collections of Latvia, but also at the State Tretyakov Gallery and in several collections of Germany. The artist keeps on participating in collective exhibitions. Her personal and retrospective exhibitions took place in many cities throughout Europe and in dozens of cities in America, enjoying success over more than half a century of her creative career.\n\nA Czech artist, a painter, lithographer, graphic artist, book illustration master. Maria Cherminova, the brightest and most significant representative of poeticism and surrealism in the Czech Republic, took the pseudonym Toyen at an early age. Its origins can be interpreted as from the French “Citoyen” - a citizen, and from the Czech phrase, meaning, “this is he”. In both cases, the new name did not give her gender identity. Maria, who tried to break down stereotypes, became a cult figure both in the Czech Republic and in Paris, where she was supported, in particular, by Andre Breton, a leading figure of Surrealism.Toyen was an original and self-sufficient creator. She perceived Surrealism as a driving force of imagination, as well as of the social and political progress. The artist became one of the organisers of the Surrealistic community in Prague. Many of her paintings from the second half of the 1930s also had strong political and anti-war meaning.Hostile to bourgeois conformism, Toyen challenged values ​​based on totalitarianism. The artist left Prague after the Nazi occupation considering the communist regime imposed on the country unacceptable for the creator.In Paris, she participated in the activities of the surrealist group of A. Breton. Although the life and work of Toyen made a great contribution to the development of feminist art, she herself never entered into discussions, did not speak openly about feminism or about her sexual orientation. Nevertheless, experts consider her a pioneer of free female art.\n\nAn English artist and Surrealist writer with an interesting and difficult destiny, who lived in Mexico for around 70 years. The daughter of rich English noblemen, Leonora Carrington had obstinate character and desire for independence. She was excluded from several schools, until she started learning painting at a fine art school in Chelsea; at the age of 12, she met famous artist Max Ernst and ran away with him to Paris.During the war, the artist had to hide from Nazi authorities. She experienced imprisonment in a nuthouse and fantastic escape from it with the help of a nurse, who came by a submarine. Leonora Carrington got real happiness and confidence in the future only in Mexico, where she emigrated after marrying someone fictitiously.The artist was one of the brightest representatives of Surrealism. Her painting differs in a very personal, individual art language. It is filled with fantastic plots and symbolic figures, which derived from the Celtic and Central American Mythology, dreams and human subsonsciousness. Carrington’s mysterious world, perfectly combining with the special grotesque humor and courage of self-expression, reveals the unusual in simple things and is a true expression of the philosophy of Surrealism.\n\nAn eminent English artist and sculptor, a connoisseur and collector of works of art, a teacher and publicist. Roland Penrose was one of the key figures of British Surrealism, and also a founder of the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, which was the center of the country's avant-garde culture. For a long time, the artist was a curator at the famous Tate Gallery and did a lot to acquaint compatriots with advanced art movements of Europe.The work of the British artist is mostly collages or paintings made in the collage style. In his works, the artist often used tourist postcards depicting famous places or architectural monuments, connecting them in various combinations, and creating his own original vision of world famous objects. The unexpected combination of incompatible things is the main idea of Penrose's art, which is reflected both in his canvases and in sculpture.The name of Roland Penrose is often mentioned in connection with his book \"Picasso: Life and Work\", which is one of the most reliable sources of information about the great artist, with whom the author had been friends for many years. Apart from this work, Penrose also issued monographs about his contemporaries, including Joan Miro, Antoni Tapies and Man Ray.\n\nAn American artist and a surrealist poet who lived and worked for a long time in Europe - Italy and France. Her creative career as an artist lasted about 30 years, starting from her first exhibition in 1936. As a representative of the \"golden era of Surrealism\" - its active post-war period - she was known and widely recognized for her original artworks, usually containing architectural themes.When Katherine Linn Sage was married the first time, she was a rich Italian princess and generously helped other artists. Throughout her career, she mostly worked under the shadow of her second husband, Surrealist Yves Tanguy, who today remains more famous in the art world than Sage. However, Katherine's creations were also popular, especially after the artist's full biography was published in 1997.In modern art criticism, Sage and Tanguy are considered to be a closed system - a chain of influence of two creators on each other, which was confirmed by the exhibition “Double Solitaire: Surrealistic Worlds of Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy”, held at the Davis Museum, Wellesley College in 2012.Kay Sage is known mainly as a visual artist, but she also wrote five volumes of poetry, mainly in French, and four plays. The autobiography \"Chinese Eggs\" was not published during her life.The style of Sage is similar to Veristic Surrealism, in which illusory images of incredible places inspired by a dream and imagination are presented; her art is mentioned among works of such authors as Giorgio de Chirico, Salvador Dali, Rene Magritte, Paul Devo and Yves Tanguy.\n\nA Ukrainian painter, innovator, as well as a master of ceramics and People's Artist of Ukraine, a winner of the main creative award of the country - the National Shevchenko Prize. He was included in the rating of the British newspaper «The Daily Telegraph» as one of 100 geniuses of modernity, one of the members of the Golden Guild, where the Roman International Academy of Modern Art included only 51 artists of the world, an honorary member of the scientific council of this academy. The master is an honorary citizen of the cities of Ternopil (the artist’s birthplace) and Kiev, where he currently lives and works.He first used his innovative technique \"Pliontanism\" (from the Ukrainian dialect word \"weave\") in the landscape genre in 1972. Subsequently, the technique acquired the status of the author’s creative method and, in combination with the original system of the artist’s worldview, made an inimitable, immediately distinguishable style of the artist, who is called a living genius throughout the world.The themes of the most titled of Ukrainian artists living in the beginning of the 21st century are very diverse, ranging from folklore and biblical myths to the most modern ideas. No less striking is the range of stylistics and genres - from hyperrealism of portraits and landscapes to completely abstract canvases.Ivan Marchuk has already created more than 5,000 paintings, now divided into 11 main cycles. The artist who lived one year in Australia and Canada and 11 years in America held more than 120 personal exhibitions all over the world and participated in numerous collective exhibitions. About two thousand works of Marchuk are in the collections of museums and private galleries of five continents of the world.\n\nAn English and American artist, theorist, author of several art history books. Born into the family of famous artists, Gordon Onslow Ford soon showed his talent in art; despite the fact that his parents chose for him the profession of a naval officer, he managed to become one of the main representatives of Surrealism in Europe and the USA.The artist created unique canvases based on his extraordinary vision of the world, which he himself called “inner realism”. The main aim of Ford’s life and art was the reinterpretation of reality and the ability to “see the world again” in accordance with his consciousness, and not with generally accepted norms. The artist's paintings, which are an interweaving of sinuous lines and a cluster of complex organic forms, separated by luminous spaces, create the impression of amazing and colorful visions. Their multi-layered patterns attract with their decorative, optimistic and spiritual depth, originating in the psychological teachings of Carl Jung, Zen Buddhism and his own metaphysical and aesthetic theories.The artist is famous for not only his paintings, but also for his scientific works that had a great influence on the development of contemporary US art. To support artists who appeal to the subconscious in their work, Onslow Ford founded the non-profit organization Lucid Art Foundation, which still exists.\n\nAn Austrian artist and draughtsman of Jewish descent, engraver and sculptor, architect and stage designer, master of monumental painting and book illustration, as well as a composer and poet. Ernst Fuchs was one of the founders of the famous Vienna School of Fantastic Realism, the creator and active implementer of the Vienna Art Club and the organization “Hundsgruppe”.The artist became world famous working in France, Germany, the USA, Israel and Spain. In 1993, Ernst Fuchs was one of the first Western artists to be honored to hold a large retrospective exhibition at The State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg; later his exhibition was held at The State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. The master who opened his exhibitions noticed, “One of the highest manifestations of art is Old Russian painting.”The artist, whose paintings impressed his friend Salvador Dali, purchased and restored the Villa of Otto Wagner in Hutteldorf, where he organized The Museum of Ernst Fuchs in 1988. It is currently one of the largest cultural centers of Austria and represents the largest collection of the paintings of the master whose nickname was Fire-Fox.The painting of Ernst Fuchs is hoax and dissonance, challenge to society (especially in the nude genre), but at the same time a continuous and creative dialogue with old masters. Incredibly famous and productive Austrian master created works in absolutely different art genres – from incredibly skillful paintings and architecture to literature and music.\n\nA Czech painter, graphic artist, illustrator, who became one of the most striking, original and significant representatives of early European Surrealism, and later, in the period after the Second World War, was a master of abstract landscape painting.Josef Sima is equally referred to the Paris School of Surrealism, since he worked in France long time (around 50 years). At the same time, the artist always kept in touch with the Czech artistic community and was a member of art groups in his homeland.After receiving a special and versatile education at the Prague High Technical School and the Academy of Fine Arts of the Czech capital, J.Sima became one of the founders of the Czech art group «Devestil»; after moving to Paris he participated in the activity of the Surrealist group «Grand Jeu» and became a co-founder and designer of a magazine with the same name.The artist entered the history of the fine art as a talented illustrator of frequently reprinted collections of Czech and French poets, whom he kept in touch with.Josef Sima became an important figure in modern European art, was awarded the title of the Officer of the Legion of Honor. The largest collection of his paintings is at the Paris Georges Pompidou Center and at the gallery of the Szech city of Brno. The artist's works are highly valued at art auctions in Europe.\n\nA Spanish artist and theater designer, a bright representative of Surrealism. Esteban Frances spent his youth in Barcelona; with the outbreak of World War II, he moved to Argentina and became one of the first Surrealists in South America. In the United States, the artist joined a group of European surrealists headed by Andre Breton. The Spanish painter closely communicated with Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy and Salvador Dali, but was in a special relationship with the Catalan artist Remedios Varo, who was his lover and faithful friend.In his surrealistic works, the artist used automatism, which allowed him to reproduce spontaneous thoughts, memories and fantasies on the canvas without the influence of reason and logic. Frances often used the technique of scratchboard, scratching a drawing on a pre-coated surface, which created unusual and unpredictable effects. The paintings of the Spanish artist are distinguished by brightness, texture and originality of images that seem to arise from strange dreams and intricate memories.The contemporaries of Esteban Frances knew him as an author of the scenography for the productions of American ballet. The artist’s collaboration with Russian choreographer George Balanchin lasted twenty years, during which Estaban not only created thousands of bright theatrical images but also developed a completely new approach to the traditional art of ballet design.\n\nThe French artist of Polish and Jewish origin was one of the most mysterious and mystical artists of the twentieth century, whose paintings are extremely ambiguous and are popular in the international art community. Balthus was one of those painters who cannot be clearly catalogued. He deliberately isolated himself from all the artistic trends that had succeeded in his time, in order, as he admitted, to achieve timeless realism.Baltus (Count Baltazar Klossowski) is known for his erotically charged images of teenage girls living in the world of their imagination and images. Therefore, his paintings are more reminiscent of magical realism with its fantastic world than surrealism. It is hard to say that the master’s painting was influenced by the prevailing fashion to return to realism - he initially used the techniques of the art of the Old Masters in order to create his own universe. His not always harmless and characteristic bourgeois interiors are just the conditions for depicting an ambiguous world populated by young people at the height of puberty, in which adults are not allowed, but can pervertedly intrude, as described in the scandalous work “Guitar Lesson”, which the New York MOMA first purchased, and soon got rid of. The artist actively resisted any attempts to create his biographical profile - in a telegram sent to the Tate Gallery, where a retrospective of his works was being prepared, he wrote in response to a request: “Balthus is an artist about whom nothing is known. Now let's see his work”.\n\nA Danish painter, sculptor, director, who is considered a pioneer of Surrealism not only in his own country, but in the Scandinavian art as a whole. This was so despite the fact that the artist was almost an amateur. Wilhelm Freddie initially worked as an abstract artist, but later moved away from non-figurative painting and turned to Surrealism, a more realistic style. Nazi and Fascism were criticized in a number of paintings by the artist (primarily in his “Meditation” created in 1936); as a result he was officially prevented from visiting Germany, and later was forced to seek refuge in Sweden, where he lived until the early 1950s.Some paintings by Freddie were rather bold in plots and contradictory in meaning, therefore they were considered pornographic in the pre-war years and in the first two decades after the war. This led to the closure of exhibitions, the arrest of the author and repeated confiscation of works. Their artistic merits were subsequently recognized; the state galleries and museums of Denmark and other countries began to acquire the works of the master for their collections.Art historians rightly believe that Dane Wilhelm Freddie awarded the highest award of the Academy of Arts, the Torvaldzen Medal, in 1970, should be named first among Scandinavian Surrealists. He was one of the few Surrealists, whose works were filled not only with fantasy, but also with deep ideological and moral content.\n\nA Spanish surrealist artist and sculptor, whom art experts refer to very significant and undeservedly little-known painters of the 20th century. A fellow student of Salvador Dali, a member of the art group Logicophobiste (Barcelona) had a unique style - certainly her own view on the moral aspects and mechanics of life. Her works are full of subtle wit and mystery; the theme of her paintings is motivated by the studies of antiquity and literary sources, as well as by physics and mathematics, engineering and biology in combination with psychoanalysis.Fleeing from the Franco regime, feminist and anarchist Varo, who had republican contacts, moved to Paris, but during the times of the Second World War immigrated to Mexico. The artist’s unique style combines fragments of the subconscious, mystical principle and a deep understanding of the human soul. It takes its roots in the atmosphere of the Middle Ages, the art of Jheronimus Bosch, scientific theories and esoteric literature. Varo created her main works in the second half of her life, and gained worldwide fame after her death.The artist’s paintings are allegorical and filled with deep meaning. They make the viewer think about the nature of the Universe and the secrets of existence hidden in simple things. The incredible world of Remedios Varo attracts you with its lyricism, emphasized femininity, and paradoxes of reality, which the artist tirelessly created in each of her paintings.The magic and mysticism of the works of Remedios Varo have much in common with the works of her close friend, Leonora Carrington, who, like Varo, emigrated from Europe that suffered from wars to relatively calm Mexico. Together, the women organized a circle of Surrealists, whose work also contained the influence of local culture, in particular the “muralism”, which was a mixture of avant-garde movements with the art of South American Indians.\n\nAn Austrian Surrealist painter, art theorist, sculptor and poet, author of several philosophical works, who worked in Mexico and the USA.Wolfgang Paalen came from a wealthy German-Austrian family; his childhood passed in an old castle, purchased and restored by his father. The atmosphere of the Middle Ages reigned there; ancient legends and legends of local people significantly impacted the formation of the personality of the future artist.Paalen was a member of the group of abstract artists \"Abstraction-Creation\", and later became one of the prominent figures of the surrealist movement, acting as an organizer and designer of their exhibitions, both in Europe and in the USA. At the invitation of Frida Kahlo, he moved to Mexico, where he founded his surreal art magazine DYN, which had a great influence on the avant-garde art of the country.In his work, Wolfgang Paalen sought to combine abstract art with an appeal to the subconscious and symbolic elements. He developed his model of surrealistic expression, presented in the form of a mysterious, otherworldly landscape permeated with mysticism and saturated with mysterious images of cosmic origin.Abstract paintings of the artist and his theoretical articles had a great influence on the development of Abstract Expressionism, which became the major art movement in the USA in the second half of the XXth century.\n\nZdzisław Beksiński was a Polish artist, master of art photography and computer graphics. Z. Bekshinsky was a vivid representative of late Surrealism, who initially created sculptures and wire installations. Having concentrated on painting, the artist first worked in the style of abstraction, but then quickly turned to fantastic Surrealism. This style includes his most famous works, the subjects of which are scenes of death, decay and post-apocalyptic horror.From the 1970s, the artist developed a specific manner of transmitting surrealistic horror paintings with a repeated addiction to the image of distorted bodies without faces or limbs, many-legged and many-armed monsters, often wrapped in rotten rags. If the artist painted architecture or interior, those were ruins shrouded in gloomy fog, houses covered with cobwebs, tourniquets and gravestones. Thus, most of Bekshinsky’s works are difficult to confuse with the work of other Surrealists. The artist never gave names to his impressive nightmares, giving the viewers an opportunity to reach the essence of the work themselves.After the Warsaw exhibition of 1964, when all canvases of the painter were sold out, almost all the opening days of Zdzislaw were a huge success in his homeland. In the early 1980s, the works of the Polish original master became known in France, and then he became incredibly popular in Western Europe, Japan and the USA.Bekshinsky bequeathed his paintings to the Historical Museum of the city of Sanok, where he was born. This museum now has the largest collection of works by the artist - several thousand paintings, sculptures, reliefs, drawings, graphics, and photographs.\n\nAn American Swedish-born artist who worked with her spouse M. Ernst in France for thirty years. Dorothea Tanning, a prominent representative of surrealism, is famous in Europe and the USA as not only an artist, but also as a sculptor and graphic artist, a book designer and set designer, as well as an author of significant literary works. All the works of D. Tanning – from painting and sculpture to poetry – deeply influenced the next generations of artists. The investigations and examples of so called «female form of art» were frequently used by the members of the feminist movement. Along with other surrealist women, Tanning provided the necessary active model for women who also tried to get free from limited opinion and become independent artists. It is noteworthy that her experiments in sculpture influenced the creative career of Louise Bourgeois, and Sara Lucas, who showed the same intense interest in the basic psychedelic ideas of Surrealism. The 100th anniversary of the artist was celebrated with numerous exhibitions around the world, in particular, early projects for the stage in the Drawing Center in New York, paintings in the Galerie Bel'Art, Stockholm, Sweden, and the exposition «Happy Birthday Dorothea Tanning» in the Max Ernst Museum in Seillans, France. Paintings and sculptures of Dorothea Tanning are presented in leading museums and galleries in Europe and the USA and are highly valued at art auctions.\n\nAn American artist and sculptor of Italian origin. Enrico Donati is considered the last of Surrealists, who lived a long and fruitful life, full of creative experiments and achievements.The artist began his career in the field of fine art rather late. He tried his hand in music, writing avant-garde compositions in Montparnasse, showed interest in anthropology and participated in an expedition to study the culture of ancient Indians, was engaged in commercial activities, and only at the age of 30 started painting seriously. Deciding to devote his life to painting, Donati joined the circle of Surrealists, a movement that was at the peak of its popularity in Paris.After the Second World War began, the artist, like many of his colleagues, moved to the United States. Here he, in his own words, “found himself anew”, starting to experiment with various materials and inventing completely new painting technologies. In order to create the necessary texture in his works, Donati used such materials as sand, dust, coffee beans and a wide variety of objects. In some of his works, he even used the contents of his vacuum cleaner, arguing that almost any thing could become a true art. Later, when surrealism lost relevance, he clearly showed his talent in such art movements as Constructivism and Abstract Expressionism.\n\nA French artist, a painter and graphic artist, master of book illustration, theater and cinema set designer. The art of Leonor Fini left a significant mark in the culture of France. She participated in all major exhibitions of representatives of the avant-garde art movements, along with Ernst, Dali, Picasso, Brauner and others, painted portraits of her famous contemporaries. L. Fini is often called Dali’s feminine side; the Spanish genius of Surrealism himself highly appreciated the artist’s paintings. Not joining any groups, Leonor adhered to feminist principles, was an example of what an independent woman can achieve. Nine documentaries were filmed about her and her paintings; one of them, “The Cruel Legend”, was created in 1951. Fashion designers, such as Coco Chanel, specially designed clothes for her. Many poets and writers devoted their paintings to the works of Leonor and to Leonor herself; among them, there were Paul Eluard, Jean Cocteau, Alberto Moravia, Pablo Neruda. The artist illustrated over 50 books - Shakespeare, Baudelaire, Nerval, and others. The most famous are her works on the erotic novel by Dominic Ory (Pauline Reazh) “History O”. She also created costumes and entourage for the films of Fellini and Castellani, and became the author of the bottle of the popular perfume “Shocking”. Fini’s friend and painter Max Ernst characterized the creative manner and personality of Leonor Fini most succinctly and precisely, though very briefly, “Italian aggressiveness and scandalous elegance, fantasy and passion”. This characteristic is complemented by a phrase from the monograph by Jean Cocteau, “In her unrealistic realism, Fini summarizes her entire last period, more real than the reality itself, which is its sign.” The artist occasionally rejected the title of surrealist that stuck to her, however everyone kept on thinking her so till her death. Perhaps, that is why Fini often changed her style, worked in various techniques, and appeared in the media, disowning the name “surrealism” regarding her art. At the same time, the fame of the artist became wider; her works were exhibited at major galleries and museums around the world.\n\nA Swedish artist and writer, one of the first modernists in his country. Gösta Adrian-Nilsson, who signed his paintings with the acronym GAN, was a comprehensively gifted person. He painted in various avant-garde styles, was an active member of the German progressive group Der Sturm (Storm, Berlin), created talented illustrations for the works of his contemporaries, and also wrote his own poems and fairy tales for children. A great admirer of Oscar Wilde in his youth, Adrian-Nilsson adored the decadent movement of the late 19th century, but at the beginning of the next century joined German Expressionists, Italian Futurists, and later French Cubists, making a considerable contribution to the spread of these art movements in his homeland.\n\nA French surrealist – painter, graphic artist, a master of art illustration and theatre design, a director and author of scripts and other literary works. Felix Labisse, who was born in France, worked with James Ensor in Belgium at the beginning.After moving to Paris in 1927, the 22-year-old artist immediately became close to the elite of French culture, including representatives of the theater and literature. His friends Paul Eluard, Philippe Soupault, Robert Desnos, Jacques Prévert and Jean-Louis Barrault wrote poems, articles, essays and monographs about the artist.From the beginning of 1940s, the artist became one of the largest figures of the new French art and devoted much creative power to not only painting, but also illustrations (his largest projects are 30 paintings to the “Natural History” and design for the book of Baudelaire’s poems) and set design. The master created costumes and scenery for 60 plays; in particular, he was the one who created decorations for the “Process” by Kafka, which was staged by great French director Jean-Louis Barrot.The works of Felix Labisse are exhibited not only at the main museums of France, but also at galleries of Belgium and at the P. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the USA. However, most of the works are in private collections and are popular at international art auctions.\n\nAn English artist, a bright and distinctive representative of Surrealism, who worked extensively in collage techniques. Conroy Maddox was also a talented writer and teacher.In 1935, together with writer and artist John Melville, he founded the group of Birmingham Surrealist artists separate from the London association. They were unsatisfied with the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition and did not take part in it. The Birmingham surrealist movement of C. Maddox continued to work independently from other representatives of this movement, in particular, from the capital's significant movement “Unit One”, until the mid-1950s, having a significant impact on a whole pleiad of young British avant-garde artists.Maddox worked more than sixty years, remaining a loyal supporter of Surrealism, while many other artists used the style of this movement only a few years to join other art movements later.The artist wrote, “Surrealism is a difficult glance at reality, but it offers a way out of the type of society in which we live. Society will change one day, and we will run away from our incessant monotony, from a life where we cannot connect our dreams with reality.” In general, the definition given by Rene Magritte perfectly fits the work of Conroy Maddox: \"Surrealism is a reality freed from banal meanings\".\n\nAn outstanding Latvian avant-garde artist, one of the most popular and original painters of the second half of the 20th century, often called the patriarch of Latvian modern art. Having chosen an absolutely individual way and style in the visual arts, Auseklis Baušķenieks said, «I am looking for suggestions for my paintings from the environment, from everyday life, I am realistic in the form of work.\" At the same time, he skillfully used the technique of pointillism and continued French post-impressionist traditions. Always benevolent and witty in life, Baus (this is how he signed his paintings) created abstruse multifaceted works, sometimes dramatically detailed. Household plots of his works became surrealistic, filled with grotesque collisions based on life observations. The artist’s legacy allows you to see other aspects of his art - for example, he contributed to business graphics, creating posters and labels for goods and products. Despite accusations of retreating from the canons of social realism, the artist became a member of the Union of Artists of the USSR, and his works were exhibited during his lifetime in Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Russia, the USA, France and Australia. The works of A. Baušķenieks are in museums and private collections in Latvia and abroad; they are in demand at art auctions.\n\nA French painter and sculptor, a bright representative of avant-garde movements in his country and the United States. Andre Masson, a close friend of A. Breton, J. Miro, M. Ernst, was one of the largest early French Surrealist artists. Then, abandoning the main ideas of this style, he focused on the expressive image of impulses of love and hate, acutely reacting to the tragic events in Europe. Forcefully living in America for several years, the artist was interested in ancient, African-American and Native American mythology, putting modern sound into the plots. His style influenced many young American artists who developed Abstract Expressionism. A. Masson wrote, “painful contradictions are the source of the greatest artistic inspiration”; his identification as a Surrealist is ambiguous, although it was he who was the most ardent supporter of the release of the subconscious. Throughout his life, Masson had a huge number of exhibitions throughout Europe and in the United States; his works, including those created in a unique style with the use of sand, are at the most significant contemporary art galleries and museums of the world.\n\nA Spanish painter, graphic artist, master of book illustration. Angeles Santos was a contemporary of the second generation of avant-gardists, a member of the Spanish \"Society of Iberian Artists\", which in different years included Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. Her art combined the features of Surrealism, Cubism, magical Realism and Expressionism.The artist was often called Spanish Rimbaud, because the painting “The World” by the eighteen-year-old artist became a sensation of the 9th Autumn Salon in Madrid; at the age of 19, she created her best painting. However, unlike Rimbaud, Andeles Santos resumed her career after the considerable break in her work, starting to create paintings in other styles.Famous intellectuals and creators (including poet Garcia Lorca) visited the house of the young artist in the Spanish city of Valladolid. Numerous solo exhibitions of the artist, whose creative career amounted to more than 80 years, were held in almost all the capitals of Europe, as well as in the cities of America. In 2005, the artist received the Cross Prize - Creu de Sant Jordi award from the Catalan government. Her works are included in the collections of the largest museums in Spain. The recognition of the importance and significance of the artist's art was the inclusion of her works “Un mundo” and “La tertulia” in the book “One Hundred Best Paintings of the Twentieth Century”.\n\nA Spanish (Catalan) artist, master of lithography and engraving, a representative of the large Emporda school of Surrealism. When he was a teenager, he was a friend of Salvador Dali, who greatly influenced him. A little later, Angel Planells made friends with Rene Magritte and other Surrealist artists in Cadaqués. The artist participated in exhibitions held in the cities of Spain and Paris. Three of his works were included in the First London Surrealist Exhibition. One of them was bought by an influential avant-garde collector and expert, the organizer of the vernissage, Roland Penrose; that was a real success and recognition of Planells' originality. The civil war in the artist’s homeland led to a significant break in his creative career that had begun successfully: at the times of Franco, the master could not work in the style of surrealism openly, created landscapes and still lifes. The artist returned to this style more thoroughly in the 1960s. Being a shy person and introvert, Angel did not talk about his paintings; he almost never left his native places and always remained in the shadow of his great compatriot Salvador Dali. However, as noted in the preface to the vernissage of 70 paintings, “Surrealism in Catalonia. Artists of Emporda and S. Dali ”, which took place at the State Hermitage Museum (Russia, St. Petersburg) in 2016, Angel Planells was on the list of significant Surrealists after Dali.\n\nAn English Expressionist artist, portraitist, one of the most popular and expensive artists of the mid-twentieth century.He belonged to an ancient but ruined family, and the artist was named after his famous ancestor, English philosopher and scholar Francis Bacon. Due to poor health and the First World War, the boy did not receive systematic education and did not study painting professionally. The artist's father was a strict and despotic person, as a result, at the age of 17, Francis left his parents' home because of disagreements with him.Francis Bacon was a controversial and mysterious painter, whose work received sincere admiration of some people, while a clear rejection and even disgust of others. The artist's paintings depicting distorted human bodies, shapeless faces and the parts of various animals, not only convey the author's personal inner world, but also reflect the features of that time and the lifestyle of the society in which he lived. The bold and shocking works of Bacon are very popular, received many prestigious awards and are exhibited in the most famous galleries of England, the USA, Germany and Russia. Unconventional work of the artist has a large number of followers around the world.\n\nA Mexican artist and monumentalist, graphic artist and sculptor, a vivid representative of the avant-garde, who worked in several new styles and promoted national traditions and culture by his work.Rufino was a Zapotec Indian by blood, although he did not look like a purebred Indian. After the death of his mother, the boy was brought up by his aunt, in whose shop in Mexico City he helped to trade. In the future, the young artist had a predilection for \"fruit\" still lifes.The master received many prestigious awards, his personal vernissages were held, except for Mexico, in the US and Europe. The museum of Rufino Tamayo was opened in the artist's native city Oaxaca in the south of Mexico. In the capital of Mexico, there is the Museum-Gallery of R. Tamayo, to which the artist donated a large and very valuable collection of paintings by contemporary artists (Picasso, Braque, Leger, Bacon, etc.).\n\nA Ukrainian artist of Jewish origin, a painter, draftsman and sculptor, as well as an inventor who lived and worked in Paris for many years. Born under the name Shulim Wolf Leib Baranov.Baranoff-Rossine was a vivid representative of the Ukrainian and Russian avant-garde. He was recognized throughout Europe and the United States. He invented the color-visual clavier and presented \"bell-ring\" concerts at the theaters of Russia, France, the Netherlands and the USA. In the Paris Center of G. Pompidou, there is the device itself and the Gallery of visual effects of the opophonic piano.Constantly experimenting with color and light effects, Wladimir Davydovich applied them in the military art, having developed the technique of camouflage in 1939. Baranoff was officially registered as the inventor of the \"photochromometer\", which allowed to determine the quality of precious stones, as well as the machine \"Multiperko\", which produced, sterilized, poured carbonated drinks. His inventions received several technical awards, which, unfortunately, did not save the Jewish artist from the Auschwitz gas chamber in 1944.In 1972, the artist's family gave 38 works to the Museum of Modern Art in Paris; his son Dmitry restored the color music piano, which was exhibited in the hall of the Pompidou Center. The artist was presented in 1972 at the exhibition \"Significant paintings of Russian artists in French collections\", works have been exhibited around the world, in particular, retrospectives at the Tretyakov Gallery in 2002, at the Russian Museum and the Pushkin Museum in 2007.\n\nAn English artist of German-Jewish origin. One of the most extraordinary and popular painters of the twentieth century. A grandson of famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.He was born into a Jewish-German family. Before the Second World War, the family moved to London, where Lucien studied at the Central School of Art, the School of Painting and Drawing in East Anglia and Goldsmiths College. Since his childhood, he had demonstrated great abilities for the fine arts. One of his drawings was chosen for an exhibition of children's art at the London gallery Peggy Guggenheim. Because of bad behavior, he did not finish his studies and went to work for the merchant navy.Lucien Freud mostly painted portraits and nude models in the interior. He was notable for his unusual approach to the depicted objects and rejected all canons in painting. The artist is known for images of celebrities, among which there are popular actors, musicians and even Elizabeth II, the Queen of Britain. The original manner in which the artist worked was often criticized, although it provided him tremendous success. One of his paintings, \"The Sleeping Social Worker\" - was sold at Christie's auction for record 17.2 million pounds sterling.

Famous as one of the great sculptors of the 20th century, Louise Bourgeois lived an incredibly long creative life. Her career spans almost a century, and her work reflects almost all the major art movements of this period: Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism, Constructivism and Abstract art.Despite the influence of various artistic movements and styles, sculptures by Bourgeois were always unique creations of modern sculpture. Based on early, predominantly sad childhood memories, they affect the deepest human feelings, always hitting the target directly. Huge steel spiders, strange objects in the cages and close attention to the relationship between the sexes cause strong emotions and genuine public interest in the extraordinary work of the artist.Louise Bourgeois was one of the first to use Environmental art in her art; it involves the presence of sculptural compositions in the everyday environment of a human being.

While his fellow Surrealists flaunted their lives, shocking the audience and attracting their attention, Magritte lived in solitude, earning his living by creating advertisements and illustrations for newspapers and magazines. This work was reflected in his art, in which the influence of advertising and poster art is noticeable.In each picture of the painter, which at first glance seems like a meaningless set of objects, there is a hidden deep meaning and secret subtext addressed to the human subconscious.

For Frida Kahlo painting became a way to study issues of self-identity and existence when the 19-year-old girl was recovering from a severe accident. As a result, Kahlo, who did not have a systematic art education but possessed natural talent and the courage of self-expression, became one of the first Mexican avant-garde artists and a vivid representative of European Surrealism.Kahlo not only entered the already existing stream of the latest trends in the visual arts but also expanded its boundaries for female artists. In her art, new and well-formulated means for discussing the most complex aspects of female identity are just as significant as the motives for self-identification through Mexican national culture, primarily through the work of the peoples of pre-Columbian America. The artist used the visual symbolism of physical pain in an attempt to understand emotional suffering. Before the emergence of the art of Kahlo, the language of loss, suffering and death was relatively well studied by some male artists (A. Dürer, F. Goya, E. Munch), but a woman created such art at the world level for the first time.Kahlo became the first Mexican artist whose work was acquired by the Paris Louvre.
