It could be all types of genres, and not specific to any genre. This will help people explore different genres of music from all across the globe and bring us all together and close as a community. I will start with mine and you could post yours in the comments. I will be stoked to check them out and will definitely follow. After all we never say no to good music\n\nCheers!\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/66vYApskvdUUZMNYbOip77?si=DKNrkqleTQe4rZiNdx1_yA\n\n30 years. That is crazy. I admire your interest in music. I myself find so much peace in it. Looking at your playlist, I'm sure it's gonna help me get through tough times. Thanks for sharing. Appreciate it."
