Prior to this I lived with Wolfgang Schmidt from Germany in San Miguel de Allende in a holiday flat during the off-season (I think we paid around 50 USD/month) before taking an ill-fated trip with Wolfgang and new friends Peter and Paul to Morocco where we drove off a cliff en route on the windy roads outside Motril, Spain. Surviving the accident with cuts and bruises, we continued our trip via bus. Peter Paul and I were turned away at the Moroccan border multiple times due to our long hair. Wolfgang eventually made it through, Peter Paul & I returned to Ibiza We became very friendly with the owners of \"La Tarántula\", brothers Luis and Antonio. When they found out we were sleeping in caves in the old town, they offered us a place to sleep in the bar in exchange for cleaning up for the next day's opening. Eventually we moved back to San Miquel where we lived in a rustic farm house. We would walk all night to get home after the bars closed in Ibiza town. If this rings a bell with anyone, I would love to hear from you. My days spent in Ibiza were some of the happiest days of my life.\n\nSaturday 06-February-2016\n\nChristal (Tunbridge Wells (UK) and Jávea (Alicante) UK and Spain)\n\nWhere are all the well known painters of the 1960s mentioned.

Sandy's Bar in Santa Eulalia (officially the Black Horse) - not mentioned? And so much more... I arrived at the age of 9, i 1959. My mother built a house just outside Santa Eulalia. The only house on what is now an urbanization. There was an English speaking school there, organised by Felicity, and later on another one started up by John Walker. Who runs this site? Who are you?

Primarily in Santa Eulalia and further out on the campos. Didn't spend much time in Ibiza, to 'crowded'. Art's Bar, Sandy's, The Black Cat. Rise at noon for breakfast on the Ramlas with Fundador and Hierbas. Many wonderfui, sometimes hazy, memories. Sitting in the tower of Terry Thomas' finca hand painting tiles for his bathroom, listening to Radio Morocco, head full of hash and eyes swimming in the ocean. Up for 24 hours with Art roasting a pig for one of Nina's bacchanals, as always very well 'fortified', including Owsley I think, but I forget. Timeless days in Graham Coughtry's finca where the opium in in the communal bowl seemed as endless as the time. Working with Felicity at her school for expatriate young'uns. No interest in returning to see what destruction man has wrought - again.

Any information would be greatly appreciated!\n\nWednesday 11-August-2010\n\nFrederick Willman (Madison, WI. USA)\n\nI lived in Palma in the late 50s and befriended the writer Steve Seley who lived in Ibiza and who visited Mallorca often. Your recent post was not admiring of his novel, \"The End of Mercy,\" but let me say a few words about it and Steve who I suspect is no longer with us. He was a handsome man, maybe 5';10', who had long been an expat. He'd lived in Paris and had a long on-again-off-again affair with a lovely Parisien, Claire Lichtenstein. He had a helluva temper, talked too much, but was kind and ebullient and, as I think of him now, a character out of the 20s and 30s. Claire, married, wanted and didn't want to live with him. She had the security and boredom of a French husband; she and Steve were a floating drama of longing and lost opportunity. He was not easy to take for more than an hour. I was in my mid-20s and he was close to fifty but we had in common fathers who were attorneys in Newark, NJ. His father was much admired by colleagues, I learned, when I returned in '59, and retained hope his son could establish himself as a novelist. Steve was typical of the literary types of his time--he was nuts about Joyce.The influence was clear in \"Mercy\" which he sent to me in NYC in '69 where I had acquired a wife and a baby girl. I read it, enjoyed it, and believe I gave it away in the mid-90s. I regret I never sent him a note thanking him for the book and telling him truthfully that I liked it very much. Another artist from Ibiza whom I met casually in Mallorca and knew better in NYC was the painter Carlos Sansegundo whose work I found interesting. He subsequently married the former mistress of Jackson Pollack, not a pleasant woman, and sometime after the 70s left NY; I believe he is back in Ibiza. And the third resident of Ibiza who made an impression on me was the hero of my youth, Erroll Flynn. I met him in the summer of '58 on his yacht anchored off Palma and he was a shadow of his former robust, electric self. A year later, he was dead at 49 at party in Oregon or Washington. A very talented man, too gifted for the Hollywood junk peddlers, he left a good book, \"My Wicked Wicked Ways.\" FW\n\nWednesday 14-July-2010\n\nIris (Sta.

This killer infests and darkens the leaves making them suffer a reddish to deadly black dead looking color a no good color. Eiviss Gardens on the right as we drive into Ibiza Town from the Santa Eulalia road told me it's a virus. And there is nothing one can do for the plants effected it is deadly and kills. Professional plant people on the Eivissa Conseile level ought to take a closer look at this problem and offer an island wide solution to remedie the problem. I have eight big plants like this effected on my property. Anyone else have any such problems to report? All the best and in hope for an island wide cure, Timotheus Freytag\n\nFriday 18-December-2009\n\nHOLGER E. DUNCKEL (Sant Joan de Labritja Ibiza)\n\nUEBERblick (PANORÁMICA) … una exposición en Alemania. Montaje de fotografías de José F. Tauste y Holger E. Dunckel Del 6 de diciembre del 2009 hasta Semana Santa del 2010 En el mirador de la Torre de Televisión de Schwerin (Capital de la comunidad autónoma de Mecklenburgo) Desde el gran éxito de la “foto-instalación” PANORAMA-GIRLS durante este verano, el director del Centre Cultural en Sant Joan de Labritja – Holger E. Dunckel –se encarga también del programa cultural en la torre de televisión de Schwerin. Esta previsto convertir este sitio en un centro para la fotografía contemporánea. Para el pasado mes de octubre estaba previsto inaugurar la actual exposición, con la participación de Pepe Tauste, y como celebración del segundo aniversario del ELASTICISMO. Pero se recuerdan, José F. Tauste falleció en el mes de agosto, y entonces hemos cambiado las fechas. El montaje fotográfico muestra una serie de 12 colages digitales de Tauste. WOODY ALLEN y MIA FARROW contemplando el panorama del Central Park en Nueva York, desde uno de los típicos bancos de parque. Pero en el fondo aparecen imágenes de otras películas como King-Kong, Mr. Marshall, Odisea en el Espacio y otras. Los protagonistas se encuentran de espaldas a los espectadores, y a las vistas panorámicas, que ofrece el mirador de la torre. Estas imágenes están contrastadas con 14 fotografías de H.E.Dunckel, que representan impresiones de los alrededores del lugar de la exposición, en su mayoría indicando la dirección donde se encuentra el escenario en realidad. Se puede contemplar paisajes y rincones del norte de Alemania, y por su puesto en fragmentos algo surrealistas. En total se ofrece 4 conjuntos de diferentes dimensiones. Comentario de Holger E. Dunckel: Contrario a muchos artistas, buscando un prestigio evidentemente dudoso en las salas “mainstream”, me gusta exponer en espacios públicos, aunque a veces a los administradores de estos lugares les falta algo de sensibilidad para el arte. No obstante, la obra es accesible a un gran numero de espectadores, y casi siempre de sorpresa. Las PANORAMA-GIRLS han tenido cerca de 100.000 visitas durante el verano. La realidad cultural en Ibiza muestra un panorama bastante más triste. Hace por lo menos tres décadas, que las muestras de arte han salido de sus círculos cerrados, abriéndose a un público más amplio. Hoy deciden tres componentes sobre el éxito del artista y su obra: el contexto (siempre internacional), la resonancia (de los espectadores contemporáneos) y la inversión (en las correspondientes presentaciones). De este modo, hasta los museos en todo el mundo se han convertido cada vez más en espacios públicos, donde no sólo un “meollo de enterados” se hace pasar por conocedores de arte. La ampliación de los conceptos del arte, también ha creado otros conceptos de recepción, y de muy buena influencia. Estamos hablando de la creatividad de los seres en general.

I am Steve Seley's daughter. I did not meet my father until I was 22. I am now 54. I wish we could have met back then. I believe I met your Father and Mother on Christmas day 1977. It was my 2nd day in Ibiza. My father, Steve was very drunk, as he was the whole time I was there, and not very nice to me. I met wonderful people while I was there, Clive being one of them. I hung out with Clive's daughter Kerstin, which made my time there more bearable. I wished that my time with Steve would have been aas I hoped it would be. I had the thought of going to Ibiza and meeting my father and staying to live. It is all a very long story from so long ago. Peter Kinsley anf I have been keeping intouch from time to time. Steve died shortly after my son Blake was born in 1982. I think he had a painting , it was a portrait of a man in oil. My father said I could have it after he died. I dod not know what happened to it. I heard a story that a women Deena, who I met while I was there, took many things out of his apt. after he died. I do not know. I have always wanted to go back to Ibiza, never had the financial ability. I am a painter as well. You can view my work on the Ibza web site. Search box Bridget Galway. I have my stepfather,s name, Bridget Galway. You can view some of my work on www.learn.columbia.edu/buzzer30/gallery/Bridget/bridget I hope you get this.

I went back one more time to put a headstone on his grave, with the help of my dear friend, Clive, and found some of his paintings. I'd love to hear from anyone who has any of his paintings, or stories about him. He lived on Ibiza from the early sixties until his death in '80. I'll try to dig up some photos and send them along to the blog. Cheers to whoever is still alive from those days!\n\nMonday 10-November-2008\n\nTheresa ( )\n\nHey,i'm looking for anyone from ibiza who might know me.

Her mental state is such that she dives into her guilt, almost relishing her anguish, as she calls to mind the symbol of the bond between Andres and her, the flamenco, their dance of passion and love. She will bear forever the burden of her self blame for Andres’ death. If only she had insisted that they not take the train for the last leg of their journey to the Spanish border, if only she had followed her instincts and convinced Andres not to trust the well meaning judgment of the French couple who had befriended them and assured them that there were no more Nazi soldiers in the area, Andres and the rest of their Gypsy clan would still be alive. The poems are an extension of the novel, “Tambourine”, and it is recommended that the story be read in conjunction with them. They are Anna’s expression of hopelessness through Gypsy lament as she suffers in her agony.\n\nSaturday 27-September-2008\n\nNily Naiman (Kiamesha Lake USA)\n\n\"Tambourine\" the surviving comfort women or their families. This book is only one of many calls to the Japanese government to do so. Tambourine By Nily Naiman Publisher- Chipmunkapublishers Tambourine By Nily Naiman \"Tambourine\" is dedicated to the good, brave people of Spain who provided refuge to Gypsies and Jews fleeing the Vichy French. This is a story of courage and hope in the face of unrelenting danger. It is a story of ingenuity and strength, and the human capacity for survival. Anna and her Gypsy family are in constant risk of their lives as they attempt to reach Spain and find refuge there from the Nazis and Vichy French. The hatred of Gypsies and Jews that is perpetrated by the Vichy allies of Hitler is shared by many Frenchman who are ready to turn them over to the authorities. “Tambourine” is as much a psychological adventure as it is a war story. Through fear, courage, violence, guilt, incredible passion, and unceasing emotional pressures the characters must struggle with how to interact with each other while at the same time struggling to survive. Yet through all their travails the family finds help from unexpected sources – partisan fighters who protect them and welcome them as fellow fighters, Catholic priests who are willing to risk their lives to give them shelter, and simple French families ready to give what help they can. In this “Tambourine” is an affirmation of the basic decency that is at the core of our humanity and a rejection of ethnic hatred. Book Extract “Once upon a time, there was a pretty little Gypsy girl,” Mama would start my favorite bedtime story, “far, far away in a land called Spain. The little girl was an incredible dancer. When she danced, she looked like she was floating on air. People passing by would stop and stare at the little girl, shaking their heads and wondering how anybody could dance like that. “The little girl had beautiful wavy hair and shiny green eyes like emeralds. Everybody was struck by her beauty. More than anything in the world, the little girl wanted a tambourine, but her parents did not have the money to buy her one.” “Why, Mama?” I asked. “They were poor,” she said. “What’s ‘poor’?” “‘Poor’ is when you have no money to buy food or clothes,” Mama explained. I was silent. I was trying to understand how somebody could be poor. There was always plenty of food in my house, and my closet was full of clothes. Mama would have to force me to eat all the time because I never felt hungry. My aunts and my grandmas were always sewing fancy dresses for me even though I preferred to run around in pants and kick the ball with the boys. Mama would style my hair with all kinds of funny hairdos, using hairpins that hurt me. I hated that. Looking at my closet, I decided I would give the little Gypsy girl all my stupid dresses and all the food from the kitchen. Mama smiled. “It’s getting late Anna; you have to get up early for school.” “Mama, just a little bit more,” I pleaded. Mama petted my hair “Just a little bit more. One day, a good-looking prince passed through town. He was sitting in his coach, tall and handsome. All the girls were in love with him. The king was worried about his son. He brought him all the most beautiful girls in the kingdom to choose from. However, the prince was not interested in any of them. ‘When I meet my true love,’ he said to the king, ‘only then will I get married.’ “The prince was the king’s only son, and he would be the king one day. The wife he chose would be the queen. She had to be a fine, bright and beautiful girl from a noble background.” “What’s ‘noble’?” I asked curiously. “Rich! Rich and fancy, Nobles have blue blood, which means that they all come from the aristocracy.” “Madame Norine said all blood is red; there’s no such thing as blue blood!” “It is just an expression, Anna!” Mama was starting to lose her patience; I could feel it in my bones. She closed the book. “Tomorrow we will continue. You have to go to sleep now.” She kissed me on my forehead and left the room.\n\nSaturday 27-September-2008\n\nNily Naiman (Kiamesha Lake USA)\n\nMust read!

Necesito vuestra ayuda. Desde ya hace cinco años se viene celebrando el Curso de Música Antigua de la Asociación Orpheon en Ibiza, bajo el apoyo del Consell de Ibiza. El Consell ofrecía becas a todo Ibizenco para permitirles asistir este curso que reune profesores y alumnos de países de toda Europa y Estados Unidos. Por razones por nosotros desconocidas e incomprensibles, y por lo visto puramente de índole político, el nuevo Consell ha decidido de no apoyar el curso este año. Gracias a esfuerzos incesantes de varias personas responsables en Ibiza, a destacar Ramón Taboada (previamente en el Consell) y Toni Riera, profesor de flauta, el curso se realizará de nuevo con un apoyo de la Ciudad de Santa Eulalia y de otros órganos públicos. Nos ha costado mucho el montar este curso y nuestra publicidad no ha podido ser enviada hasta muy tarde, por lo que les rogamos que nos ayuden a presentar este curso dignamente al público de Ibiza, que, sin la cooperación del Consell como en los previos cinco años, simplemente no se enterará de que el curso se realiza. También las comunidades alemana e inglesa de Ibiza debería recibir noticias de este curso, ya que cuentan con muchos individuos que les encantaría participar en este tipo de actividad musical, si solo lo supieran. Les envío a través de unos enlaces la información que tenemos sobre el curso. Los interesados se pueden dirigir a la página web: www.orpheon.org o enviar un email a: orpheon@gmx.at A vuestra disposición para cualquier otra información que necesiten: email, skype (orpheonorg) o teléfono: +43-650-4003731 Tenemos todo tipo de fotografías que se podrían utilizar para anunciar el curso. Agradeciendo vuestra ayuda, Cordialmente, Prof. José Vázquez Universidad de Música de Viena, Austria Orpheon Foundation _________________________________________________ IBIZA: http://web.mac.com/vazquezjose/iWeb/Orpheon/Ibiza.html http://orpheon.org/OldSite/Seiten/Courses/Ibiza08.htm Fotos: www.orpheon.org/OldSite/Fotos/Fotos-Instr/vda-LeidolffJC-hd34bg.jpg http://www.orpheon.org/OldSite/Fotos/Fotos-Instr/Vdgd_TurnerBlattGr.jpg www.orpheon.org/OldSite/Fotos/Fotos-Instr/vdgd_turner3-rose4.jpg www.orpheon.org/OldSite/Fotos/Fotos-jv/JVlecture2bg.jpg\n\nSaturday 19-July-2008\n\nSiân Cwper (Llanfrothen Wales)\n\nVery good, as far as it goes.

It was mostly a magical place with pink light in summer, and dank dark overcast in winter months when the internationals partied hard in Santa Eulalia and Ibiza town. I miss the old days on Ibiza and was back twice one in the late eighties and another time in the ninties when i stayed for awhile in winter and then went to barcelona where i stayed for almost a year but returned to honolulu which is a wonderful place but nothing no energy on earth beats the ibiza magic.
