        "text": "Welcome to this project's final report! This report shares the outcomes, impact and learnings from the Individual Engagement Grantee's 6-month project.\n\nIn a few short sentences, give the main highlights of what happened with your project. Please include a few key findings or learnings from your project in bullet points, for readers who may not make it all the way through your report.\n\nDocumentation pages were improved and updated; some case studies were documented.\n\nNew resources for participants were created: an assignments creation page and an Upload Wizard Campaign adaptation.\n\nA three-way model for supervising and guiding students in the production of scientific and educational images was validated and documented.\n\nSeveral assignments were finished and published.\n\nThe number of schools and wikiArS \"nodes\" was increased: 7 art schools and 1 high school are participating in Catalonia, and others are interested or plan to participate; the University of Cádiz is participating; and the initiative is starting in Madrid.\n\nThe number of Wikimedian tutors (6) and subject-specific advisers (8) has increased.\n\nAn exhibition of the results from the 2012-2013 academic year in Catalonia was produced and is ready to be shown in several places.\n\nWe are involved in new activities such as Commons workshops, Wikidignosis and Edit-a-thons.\n\nIn your midpoint report, you told us about the setup and background for your project. Do you have anything else to add to your methodology from the second half of your project? If so, please add it here.\n\nThe text below will be translated into English\n\nThe IEG period overlaps the end of the 2012-2013 academic year and the first quarter of the 2013-2014 academic year. The initiative is based on a pilot project conducted during the 2011-2012 academic year and collaboration arrangements established during the 2012-2013 academic year.\n\nDuring this period, we increased the number of collaboration arrangements and received feedback from various sources. This allowed us to validate, consolidate and improve our work methodologies. One of the most important methodological aspects was the validation of our three-way model for supervising and guiding students in the production of scientific and educational images. The model is summarized in the diagram below.\n\nWe made it a priority to recruit subject-specific advisers who guide students in the creation of educational and science graphics. The various assignments were defined in collaboration with these advisers and Wikipedians. The model allows anyone to become a subject-specific adviser—whether they belong to a scientific or cultural institution or not—provided that they have extensive knowledge of the topic in question and are capable of supervising students' work. The model also allows the involvement of a fourth or even fifth person, which has been necessary and possible in some cases.\n\nDrawing on the conclusions of the pilot project (2011-2012), we kept the assignment in which students draw portraits of 20th-century figures of whom no freely usable image is available. However, the number of such assignments was limited and we stressed to students that they must not create works that are derivative.\n\nAnother important methodological aspect was assignment definition, which we implemented using an on-wiki system (wikiArS assignments). This system allowed users to generate assignments by clicking on a button that leads to a preload page with fields to fill in. Assignments are usually defined by the Wikimedian and the expert adviser, taking into account Wikipedia's needs and the adviser's topics of expertise. However, lecturers are allowed to adapt assignments to ensure that they are appropriate to the students' workload, technical skills and academic background.\n\nWe had an interesting experience with linking our assignments to WikiProjects already underway, which entailed getting Wikipedians from the existing projects involved as tutors or advisers. We did this with the Mammals (Viquiprojecte:Mamífers) and Ancient Egypt (Viquiprojecte:Antic Egipte) WikiProjects. By collaborating with these projects, we were able to detect the editors' needs more accurately and to link our image-production program to the development of encyclopedia articles.\n\nThrough our various guidance experiences, we detected obstacles and developed various proposals regarding how to improve our supervision. These proposals need to be tested and validated.\n\nDuring the 2012-2013 academic year, we taught students individually or in small groups about the general purpose of the project, about the conditions and philosophy of the licenses, and about how to describe, categorize and post images on Commons. These tasks took up a considerable amount of time. In the new academic year, we have been looking for ways to optimize our efforts and make these tasks easier. One step we took was to adapt the Upload Wizard. This has really helped the students to fill in everything they need to fill in, while ignoring everything else. At schools where we felt it was necessary, at the start of the academic year we held talks and workshops about the wikiArS initiative, about free licenses, and about registering and posting images on Commons. These talks were open not only to the participating students but also to their classmates. This allowed us to raise awareness about Commons and free licenses throughout the entire group. These activities are closely aligned with the objectives of the Vocational Training and Orientation subjects and with the art students' interest in copyright-related issues.\n\nBeyond the production of graphics, we made our first attempt to involve one of the participating schools (Llotja) in the production of written content by co-organizing a scientific illustration edit-a-thon. The relevant methodological aspect of this event was that, one month beforehand, we worked with lecturers and professionals to determine what Wikipedia needed in relation to the topic in a \"Wikidiagnosis\" session.\n\nWhat did you do over the course of your project?\n\nPlease list all activities you’ve undertaken as part of your project, and provide a description for each activity.\n\nMy activities as an IEGrantee encompassed the various social, technical and coordination-related aspects described below.\n\nAdapting Upload Wizard for wikiArS using Campaign: Campaign:wikiArS (working page).\n\nDeveloping mechanisms (button, preload page, templates) to create wikiArS assignments online: outreach:WikiArS/assignments (working page).\n\nImproving header for Commons partnership pages: commons:Template:WikiArS partnership/tab header (better for translation, \"look and feel\").\n\nCustomized Upload Wizard tutorial for wikiArS\n\nCustomized Upload Wizard, second step\n\nContacting Wikimedian communities to detect image gaps on Wikipedia or sister wikis. Posting messages on the Village Pump pages of the various projects in different languages. Contacting users participating in WikiProjects to find out what images they need; recruiting them as wikiArS collaborators. Contacting Wikipedians who might be willing to collaborate as tutors.\n\nContacting and meeting with potential advisers as well as scientific and cultural institutions that might be interested in collaborating in an advisory capacity.\n\nWorking with subject-specific advisers to define assignments that can be used by Wikipedia or sister wikis and which are also useful learning activities for art students.\n\nOther Wikimedians also participated in this task: Galazan, Leptictidium, Luna92 and Lluis_tgn collaborated on the definition of assignments.\n\nHolding meetings and maintaining email and telephone contact with directors, heads of internships and lecturers at the art and design schools in order to present the initiative and define collaboration mechanisms, types of assignments, and timeframe.\n\nDealing with the necessary documents and procedures to establish internship and collaboration agreements.\n\nWorking with lecturers to adapt assignments to the educational context and to the specific students.\n\nMonitoring the students' work and the experts' guidance and, in some cases, helping to identify possible graphic solutions to make the images more comprehensible and appropriate for Wikipedia.\n\nProviding information, guidance and solutions to students' doubts regarding the publication of images on Commons, appropriate formats for publication, free licenses, the description and categorization of images, the insertion of images into articles, and the nomination of images for community distinctions.\n\nWith Llotja students and lecturer\n\nLaia Sabán, edRa student\n\nCarolina Gutiérrez, edRa student\n\nJaume Ferrer, edRa lecturer\n\nLorena Gutiérrez, lecturer, with UCA students on the Jerez Campus\n\nMeritxell Campos, Escola d'Art de Manresa student\n\nMíriam Cifre, Escola d'Art de Manresa student\n\nMarc Serra, Escola d'Art del Treball student on internship at Amical Wikimedia\n\nCarlota Rodríguez, Escola d'Art del Treball student on internship at Amical Wikimedia\n\nAdrià Turina, Escola d'Art del Treball student on internship at Amical Wikimedia\n\nJoan Lalucat, Escola d'Art del Treball student on internship at Amical Wikimedia\n\nOctober 25th.

Various adjustments and corrections have been made.\n\nOnline documentation and resources have been improved; it will now be easier to replicate the experience elsewhere.\n\nMore schools and people—including lecturers, students, advisers and Wikimedians—are now involved.\n\nThe IEG has been an opportunity for me to dedicate extra time to consolidating the project and gaining a more comprehensive perspective on wikiArS. Methodology and documentation\n\nTo document successful strategy model(s) to involve schools and produce valued images\n\nTo document between 3 and 6 types of assignments or ways to get involved\n\nTo update and improve the wikiArS wiki pages\n\nThe basic information is available at Get started and Get involved.\n\nThe three-way supervision model has been described and we have created a diagram of the model that can be translated into multiple languages.\n\nThere is an Assignment models section on the \"Tips and Resources\" page, with links to finished assignments and PDFs of 4 assignments on various topics.\n\nWe have created a Case studies page featuring 7 cases that may serve as sources of inspiration.\n\nWe have updated the wikiArS main pages on the Outreach wiki and Commons.\n\nWe have achieved our goals related to documenting our methodology. New experiences can be added to the spaces that we have created for this purpose. To get schools involved:\n\nBetween 5 and 10 schools from Catalonia from different art/design specializations (illustration, publishing, etc.)\n\nBetween 15 and 30 students\n\n12 art schools and educational institutions are involved, of which 8 are already participating:\n\n7 art schools: Escola Llotja (Barcelona), Escola d'Art del Treball (Barcelona), EASD Serra i Abella (L'Hospitalet), edRa (Rubí), Escola d'Art de Manresa, Escola d'Art de Tarragona and Escola Pau Gargallo (Badalona).\n\nSpecializations: Illustration (in 6 schools), final art design (in 1 school).\n\n1 high school: Tres Turons (Arenys de Mar).\n\nWe have been in contact with 3 other schools that have expressed interest but have not yet started: BAU (Barcelona), Vic and Sabadell.\n\n1 university (UOC) plans to start during the second semester of the 2013-2014 academic year.\n\n48 students have participated to date:\n\n16 students in 2012-2013.\n\n32 students in 2013-2014 (so far).\n\nAt Llotja, the school where we piloted this experience in 2011-2012, the number of participating lecturers and students has increased. A further 6 schools have also joined the initiative. We have been in contact with other schools that have expressed interest, but we have not yet found a way for them to participate. As a result of our efforts to publicize the initiative, we made contact with a high school that ended up contributing 3D graphic representations of historic buildings that they had produced with free licenses in recent years. The UOC has decided to offer the opportunity to participate in the initiative as part of the final project for students in the Multimedia Degree next semester. Most of the students who have participated so far are specializing in illustration. We are working to get more design students involved, both at the participating schools and at the other schools we have been in contact with.\n\nTo contribute between 25 and 50 new valued images\n\nMore than 130 files from wikiArS schools have been uploaded to Commons.\n\n21 assignments have been defined, assigned and successfully completed during the 2012-2013 academic year. Of these, 14 were at Catalan art schools and 7 at UCA-Jerez. These assignments produced a total of 71 images and 7 videos.\n\n15 of these assignments were on scientific or educational subjects, and were supervised and validated by expert advisers.\n\n10 images were recreations of historical buildings uploaded by Tres Turons high school.\n\n4 images were promoted as Quality Images and 2 as Valued Images; 8 were promoted in two Valued Image Sets; 16 were promoted in a Featured Picture Set; and 1 animation was promoted as Media of the Day.\n\n21 assignments were defined and assigned for the 2013-2014 academic year, and 8 are now in progress.\n\nWe have uploaded more images than we expected. However, we are primarily interested in the number of assignments completed, because each assignment covers a Wikipedia need, whether for a single image or for a set of images. The IEG period overlapped two different academic years, and we do not yet have final results for the current year. However, various assignments are already underway. The images are valuable for at least three reasons: 1) they fill an identified gap, 2) they are made by students at a quasi-professional level, and 3) they are produced under the supervision of good advisers. We try to confirm the quality of the images with the community in two ways: by announcing new images on the Village Pump pages (where they receive feedback and, in some cases, corrections), and by nominating images for distinctions on Commons and on the various Wikipedias. The criteria for Quality Image and Featured Picture on Commons are very much oriented towards the assessment of photographs. Nominating illustrations for these distinctions is a way to open the door for other types of graphics. When an image is not promoted, the comments associated with votes against it help us to improve the assignments and the guidance we provide to students. To create between 2 and 5 types of promotional materials\n\nThe pages about wikiArS on the Outreach wiki are the primary means of online promotion.\n\nThe diagram of the three-way supervision model helps to explain our methodology.\n\nWe have produced posters and other graphic materials that, together with screenshots, drafts and photographs of the students at work, are posted at Category:WikiArS documentation images on Commons.\n\nWe have written various texts to promote the initiative in general as well as specific projects and activities (see Writings).\n\nWe have designed specific guides and support materials for tutors, advisers and lecturers; like sheets with sample images (60 copies) and information brochures (425 copies).\n\nWe have met our objectives, although some of these materials still need to be translated to other languages. We can continue to work on this as needs dictate.\n\nTo produce an exhibition\n\nTo present the exhibition in at least one place\n\nTo create a program/calendar of exhibition locations and get feedback from the libraries, centers and sites where the exhibition is displayed\n\nThe exhibition has been produced. Eight easel-type cardboard exhibition displays have been made. They are foldable and equipped with folders for easy transport. The exhibition includes 8 photo-quality color posters (100 x 65 cm). The posters show the results of wikiArS during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 academic years.\n\nAmical Wikimedia will take custody of the exhibition and display it throughout the Catalan-speaking world.\n\nThe exhibition has not yet been presented but we have made progress in this direction (see explanation).\n\nWe have not yet developed a program of exhibition sites, although we have made various contacts.\n\nThe production of the exhibition was delayed; therefore, it has been produced but not presented. This happened for various reasons: After the exhibition displays were designed and a prototype was made by hand, I was unable to find a supplier to cut the cardboard at a reasonable price (see budgets) until one of the cardboard suppliers I had been in contact with told me that they had purchased a cutting machine. Also, I had planned to design the posters in July using images produced during the 2012-2013 academic year, but some of the students had not yet finished their assignments. Then, in September and October of this year, I was very busy organizing the Edit-a-thon at Llotja and had little time to work on the design. Nevertheless, initial versions of 2 posters were displayed as part of Science Week at ICTJA and at the Faculty of Geology of the University of Barcelona (these posters are now on display at edRa). Additionally, 4 wikiArS illustrations were included in the exhibition \"Sabaté Pi and Scientific Illustration\" at Llotja. Finally, posters highlighting the wikiArS results were displayed at the Edit-a-thons at the Catalan History Museum and at Llotja. We have been in contact with the Catalan Government's Library Service about presenting the exhibition throughout their network of libraries. Advisors and tutors\n\nTo increase the number of scientific and subject-specific advisers\n\nTo increase the number of subject areas that the involved advisers can cover\n\nTo increase the number of Wikimedian tutors involved\n\nEight advisers (Daniel Garcia-Castellanos, Alistair Ian Searing, Àngels Canals, David Amblàs, Francesc Xavier Hernández, Ramon Serra and Josep Cuello) are participating, or have participated, in the supervision of the students. There are a further five advisers from the MNAT team (Francesc Tarrats Bou, Pilar Sada, Montserrat Perramon, Josep Anton Remolà and Joaquin Ruiz de Arbulo Bayona) and five more in Jerez (Marina Bolado, Pablo Geara, Abraham Gil, José Carlos Sánchez and Miguel Ángel Sánchez).\n\nWe started in the fields of geoscience and zoology. In Catalonia, we have since added history, archaeology and mycology. In Jerez, we have a also added oceanography, medicine, physical therapy, engineering and architecture.\n\nSix Wikimedians are acting, or have acted, as tutors: four in Catalonia (Dvdgmz, Galazan, Lluis_tgn and Luna92); one in Jerez (El Pantera); and one in Madrid (Rodelar).\n\nDuring the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 academic years, we have gradually added new people as advisers in different areas of knowledge. I have also been in contact with a few more people, as well as institutions that may be interested in collaborating. In some cases, these people and institutions have not yet made a decision; in other cases, we are now in the process of preparing possible assignments.\n\nDaniel García-Castellanos's efforts to promote the wikiArS initiative at his research Institute, in the Faculty of Biology and on his blog have helped us to find new advisers and to spread the word about our experiences in the geoscience field. The involvement of the director and curators of the National Archeological Museum of Tarragona (MNAT)—with Pilar Sada as the main contact person—is a very good example of how a GLAM institution can get involved. Wikipedians involved in specific WikiProjects have also made a considerable contribution in advisory roles: Alistair Spearing as a subject-specific adviser and Galazan and Luna92 as tutors.\n\nNew wikiArS nodes: To contact between 2 and 5 people or groups outside of Catalonia about starting wikiArS initiatives\n\nCádiz-Jerez: The Faculty of Social Science and Communication, located on the Jerez de la Frontera campus of the University of Cádiz (UCA), participated in the initiative.\n\n7 students in the Multimedia and Animation Tools subject of the Bachelor's Degree in Advertising and Public Relations created 3D and 2D animation videos during the 2012-2013 academic year. This experience took place within the framework of an educational innovation project.\n\nThe experience will be repeated during the 2013-2014 academic year, starting in February (the subject is one semester long).\n\nOrganizer: Manuel Palomo (El Pantera, member of Wikimedia España). Lecturer: Lorena Gutiérrez (Lorgut)\n\nMadrid: We collaborated with Medialab-Prado and have made initial contacts with two art schools that are interested in participating.\n\nFirst activity: panel discussion on December 5th, 2013.\n\nOrganizer: Rubén Ojeda (Rodelar, member of Wikimedia España).\n\nWe have approached Wikimedians in other countries about launching the initiative locally, but so far no international activities have begun.\n\nThe participation of UCA was our first experience outside of Catalonia. It took place in a different academic context (university-level subject) and involved a different type of graphic (animation). The Madrid node is off to a good start. The IEG has helped us to consolidate and document the initiative, thereby making it much easier to replicate elsewhere. I discussed replication of the project in my talk at Wikimania. I have also personally discussed this with various individuals in different countries, and they have shown interest. In the case of a few other contacts, it remains to be seen whether they are interested in moving forward. The initiative is internationalizable, but it needs to grow sustainably, starting with a person or group of people who wish to launch it in their area. Qualitative feedback and coverage\n\nTo obtain feedback from students, teachers, directors of internships, advisers and tutors\n\nTo obtain feedback from Wikipedians about our reports and posts\n\nTo obtain media coverage\n\nFormal surveys have not yet been conducted.\n\nThe informal feedback we have received has been positive.\n\nWe have not been able to get wikiArS covered in the general media, despite having sent out a few press releases. Instead, we have focused on promoting the initiative within the community, on social networks and via online channels.\n\nThe lecturers have described the initiative as very positive and the participating schools will be staying on next year. None of the students who have participated in previous years have continued to contribute. This may be because they were in the last year of their studies and have been focused on finding a job since graduating. We remain in contact with them and hope they will participate again a few years from now. In any event, the students tend to respond very well when the community requests particular improvements or adjustments to their contributions. Some of the UCA students have agreed to help their classmates who will be participating next semester. We have received feedback after posting our results on the pages of the Wikimedia project communities. Members of these communities have provided opinions and suggestions—which we have tried to take into account—and have also congratulated us, in some cases. The initiative has had a considerable impact on social media. The Edit-a-thon, in particular, led to many recommendations and retweets, as well as the attention of blogs and newsletters. The participation of edRa was covered by the local media.\n\nPlease reflect on Wikimedia’s strategic priorities. We've provided 3 options below for the strategic priorities that IEG projects are mostly likely to impact. Select one or more strategic priorities that you feel your project has had impact on. Answer the question related to the priority you've selected by sharing any measures of success you have that point to this impact.\n\nOption A: How did you increase participation in one or more Wikimedia projects?\n\nOption B: How did you improve quality on one or more Wikimedia projects?\n\nOption C: How did you increase the reach (readership) of one or more Wikimedia projects?\n\nHow did you increase participation in one or more Wikimedia projects?\n\nThe wikiArS initiative is adapted to a specific type of educational institution: art and design schools (or other schools and courses that provide art training). We provide examples and methodological proposals to facilitate the schools' involvement, as well as identification and shared spaces in order to increase visibility.\n\nThe experiences of our educational program aimed to make writing about particular topics on Wikipedia educationally useful to students from other disciplines, and we have done this with the art and design schools as well. However, we have also gotten art students to participate through one of their primary activities: the production of graphics.\n\nWikiArS has also offered subject-specific experts the chance to spread their knowledge in a way other than by writing articles: by acting as advisers to the students producing the images.\n\nThe images produced by the wikiArS initiative are valid for any language and can therefore enrich all Wikipedias. We have also contributed images for Wikijunior (Wikibooks) and Wikispecies.\n\nHow did you improve quality on one or more Wikimedia projects?\n\nThe illustration of articles helps Wikipedia to improve as an encyclopedia. Images facilitate comprehension of the content, and they sometimes convey information that a photograph cannot. This is the area in which art and design schools can make a valuable contributions.\n\nBecause the assignments are defined taking into account the existing image gaps on Wikipedia (and sister wikis), we are contributing needed images.\n\nThe three-way supervision model (Wikimedians, art lecturers and subject-specific experts) has allowed us to guide students in the production of high-quality graphics and to minimize errors. The assessments of the pilot experience and the Wikipedians’ feedback has also been useful to us.\n\nActivities such as the Scientific Illustration Edit-a-thon have also helped to improve written content.\n\nHow did you increase the reach (readership) of one or more Wikimedia projects?\n\nThrough wikiArS, we raise awareness about Wikimedia Commons among students at art and design schools. We explain what it is, how publishing works, how to create a personal page, how to describe or categorize images, and how free licenses work. They learn this through the contribution of images (therefore, as authors of images). In our workshops, we explained that they can use public-domain images or create derivative works based on freely usable images provided that they respect the terms of the license. (As a result, they also become familiar with Commons as a repository where they can search for images.)\n\nDid your project have any other kinds of impact you had not anticipated when you planned your goals and targets?\n\nThe best thing about trying something new is that you learn from it. We want to follow in your footsteps and learn along with you, and we want to know that you took enough risks in your project to have learned something really interesting! Think about what recommendations you have for others who may follow in your footsteps, and use the below sections to describe what worked and what didn’t.\n\nWhat was successful? What would you recommend doing again? Please list these as short bullet points.\n\nThe three-way supervision model successfully produced good, error-free graphics. If you wish to launch a wikiArS experience, take this into account. If possible, it is a good idea to get input from even more people, as we did in the case of the stories about the Naica Mine. In addition to a geologist, we also got input from an educator and a group of schoolchildren. It may be the case that the Wikimedia tutor is also the subject-specific advisor or the art lecturer. In other words, multiple roles can be played by a single person if he or she has the necessary skills.\n\nIn the definition of the assignments, we found it very useful to ask what the (active) WikiProjects need. You can ask about this at the Village Pump or look around for yourself, but the people working on specific a WikiProject tend to have a clearer idea of the existing image gaps. It is also possible to approach WikiProject participants about becoming tutors or advisers. In general, it is good to seek out existing projects or activities for which wikiArS can provide support.\n\nIt is a good idea to negotiate the assignments with the various stakeholders, in particular the subject-specific advisers. Ask the advisers what they can and would like to provide advice about. Ask them to look at the image gaps you have detected. Ask about the general condition of Wikipedia articles on \"their\" subject. Once the assignment has been defined, you should be open to renegotiating it with the lecturer, who is familiar with the students' workload and abilities. Adjusting assignments by mutual agreement with advisers and lecturers can help to guarantee successful work.\n\nAdvising conditions. To the extent possible, it is a good idea to let each adviser decide where the advising should take place: Will they go to the art school, or should the students go to their office? Advisers should also decide how advising will work (entirely in-person, partially online or entirely online?), what channels should be used (e-mail, on-wiki, etc.?), and how many students they can take on. Adapting collaboration arrangements to the adviser's availability and work habits can help make things run smoothly.\n\nExpertise + community = quality improvement. Announce the publication of images to the Wikimedian community through the Village Pump pages and other means. Someone might identify aspects of an image that need to be corrected; if so, ask the student to take care of it. Although the images are produced under expert supervision, public scrutiny can detect things that have been overlooked.\n\nAn assignment can be for a single student or for a team, and a group of assignments can be related to each other. A complex assignment can be divided into parts or done by a team. At some schools, students are used to working in pairs on a single assignment; ask the lecturers if this is the case. Even if you use individual assignments, the fact that the students are working on the same topic may encourage them to work together during the documentation stage.\n\nReference images. When you hold meetings at schools with students and advisers, it is useful to bring reference images (either on paper, on a computer screen or on a mobile device) so that you can discuss them. These images could be on the same topic or different topics. In any case, they should be good examples of graphic solutions and representation models. Some images on Commons may be appropriate for this purpose, but you can also use images from visual encyclopedias, textbooks and other scientific dissemination materials.\n\nPublic activities. Organizing public activities (panel discussions, exhibitions, edit-a-thons) can strengthen collaboration with the schools, make the initiative more widely known in society, and lead to contacts with design and illustration professionals and cultural institutions. This was the case with the Edit-a-thon held at Llotja.\n\nProject with a GLAM. This is not always easy to do, but if cultural institutions wish to get involved it is possible to organize projects of interest to them. This was the case with the National Archeological Museum of Tarragona (MNAT) and the Escola d'Art de Tarragona. Quite a few curators from the museum participated as advisers. We defined assignments related to the figure of Augustus (to mark the 2,000th anniversary of his death) in the framework of the museum’s research and dissemination projects. In addition to receiving information and documentation, the students visited the museum and several archaeological sites in the city that were related to the assignment.\n\nWhat would you not do again or recommend that others do differently in the future? Please list these as short bullet points.\n\nNot every door you knock on will open. Some schools may seem interested, but then participation arrangements are never made. The schools sometimes need to take their time. Institutions such as museums are also sometimes slow at deciding to collaborate or specifying how they want to be involved. Be patient and knock on other doors in the meantime.\n\nDon't expect that everyone will do their job independently without follow-up. Monitor the process. If you run into an obstacle or someone stops responding, mediate between the various parties. Help find additional information if necessary. Send out reminders to make sure that the agreed timeframe is followed.\n\nDon't expect that the community will respond to all of your messages or that they will do so promptly. Sometimes the Wikimedian community surprises you by quickly coming to your assistance. And sometimes they do the opposite: you don't get any reply to your requests (to identify images that are lacking, to translate texts, to participate as an adviser, to create a template, to provide other technical assistance, etc.). Expect either reaction and seek out alternatives. Be ready to reformulate or set aside your idea and explore more promising channels.\n\nIf you have additional recommendations or reflections that don’t fit into the above sections, please list them here.\n\nWin-win-win. By creating images for wikiArS, students perform an activity that allows them to learn and meet people while collaborating on a project—Wikipedia—that benefits all of society. Advisers can also benefit from the creation of images: as long as they respect the terms of the license, they can use the images in their publications, talks or institutions.\n\nInvolving WiRs and insiders. Wikipedians-in-residence (WiRs) at GLAM institutions can use wikiArS to support their work by creating images that are useful both to the institution and to Wikipedia. WiRs can also act as liaisons by approaching institution staff members about participating as advisers or about organizing events that publicize the images created. WiRs working in disciplines related to those of the project can also act as wikiArS tutors (as in the case of Galazan, a WiR at the Catalan History Museum; read). In general, try to get insiders involved. Seek out receptive individuals at institutions or in professional groups who may wish to participate and/or tell their colleagues about the initiative. In our case, the involvement of Daniel García-Castellanos in his double role as a Wikimedian and a geoscience researcher was essential to getting other researchers and lecturers involved.\n\nBe careful with portrait assignments. Many portraits are needed to accompany biographies on Wikipedia, especially for 20th-century figures of whom no freely usable photograph is available. But there are a few points that you should keep in mind: 1) the student must be skilled enough in portraiture to make an image that resembles the person; 2) the student will not be able to see the subject in person and must instead rely on photos and video recordings; 3) the portrait must not be considered a derivative work based on existing protected images; and 4) the portrait must be done in an informative style that is appropriate for an encyclopedia, not as a caricature or an interpretive portrait. This entails a huge challenge for the students, because these conditions are somewhat contradictory. The lecturer must understand this very clearly and work with you to get this point across to the students. Because of these concerns, some portraits have been criticized and even removed from Commons. Students who were well advised and had the necessary skills were able to make good portraits (See).\n\nNomination of images. Nominating images for community distinctions on Commons (VI, QI, FP) or with Wikipedian communities is a way to reward the students' efforts and get feedback about the results. If images are criticized, make sure the necessary corrections are made and take it into account for future assignments. Bear in mind, however, that most nominated images are photographs and that the technical and formal criteria are highly oriented towards this format. Nominating and assessing non-photographic images—particularly images created expressly for this purpose (as opposed to old images in the public domain)—can help to create and expand a community as well as shared criteria for illustrations and design work.\n\nWikiArS assignments. There is a page where assignments can be defined on-wiki. The page includes guidelines for creating assignments. Make sure you use this page.\n\nWikiArS Upload Wizard. There is an adapted version of the Upload Wizard for wikiArS. Ask the students to use it. The adapted Upload Wizard explains what they need to do and provides a form with fields that they must fill in.\n\nTranslation. Collaborate by translating documentation and templates into your language. I've tried to make this easy by using the Translate Extension whenever possible and by including buttons for the translation of text in the templates.\n\nAre there opportunities for future growth of this project, or new areas you have uncovered in the course of this grant that could be fruitful for more exploration (either by yourself, or others)? What ideas or suggestions do you have for future projects based on the work you’ve completed? Please list these as short bullet points.\n\nContinuing in Catalonia: Students from various schools are currently working on assignments and others are about to begin. We have been in contact with other schools that may get involved. The initiative will continue.\n\nContinuing in other parts of Spain: The University of Cádiz will repeat its experience this year (second semester) in the same subject. A few interested schools in Madrid are about to begin their participation. We will also be collaborating with Medialab-Prado, also in Madrid. We have contacts in other parts of Spain where there may be people willing to promote the initiative.\n\nInternationalization: WikiArS is ready to be replicated or adapted in other parts of the world. For this to be possible, there must be someone who is willing to lead the initiative by contacting schools and advisers. We have made a few contacts but nothing has been confirmed. Local chapters, thematic organizations and Wikipedia user groups could collaborate in these efforts, as could any Wikimedian or art lecturer who wished to be involved.\n\nExhibition. The exhibition is ready. We are now making contacts with the aim of presenting it in various Catalan-speaking areas. The exhibition will publicize the results of the wikiArS initiative as well as graphic collaboration with Wikipedia in general. It will also strengthen the various activities and collaboration efforts that we are pursuing with different institutions.\n\nOther assignments\n\nAlthough we have mostly worked with illustrators, we are now starting to work with designers and should redouble our efforts to do so. We will also continue to explore the creation of assignments for Wikibooks and other sister projects.\n\nMedigraphics is another area for exploration. We must be careful to obtain good advice, but there is great potential because there is a very active WikiProject behind this.\n\nStudents could contribute not only by making images to accompany content but also by creating interface graphics. At Wikimania, I had the chance to talk to people from the WMF design team, but we have not had time to develop our ideas. This would mean taking the project in a new direction, but there are art and design schools capable of handling it. Assignments of this sort are often given as in-class teamwork.\n\nTechnical issues:\n\nI have not had time to create a button based on a preload page that would generate standardized Commons partnership pages for the schools. However, I am committed to doing this because it will make the work of wikiArS tutors and organizers easier.\n\nIn the adapted version of the Upload Wizard that I made using the Campaign extension, I would have preferred to have some data from the form fields be used to fill in specific parameters of the information template (not just \"description\"). In general, I have also found that the Commons uploading system is not well adapted to co-authorship (for example, when a graphic or animation is created by a group of students). In order to include multiple authors, the page must be edited post-upload. I also think it should be possible to identify images as derivative of other freely usable images—whether or not they are available on Commons—in the copyright release portion of the form. I don't understand why the initial tutorial must involve an image; I think it should be possible to use a template, which is easier to translate. I have resolved this by using a template but, after the translation is finished, I have to upload a screenshot it in order to use it. Perhaps future development projects could take into account these and other observations based on the art schools' contribution experiences.\n\nI have noticed that the tabs on the wikiArS Outreach pages are hard to see on mobile devices. Perhaps someone could find a way to improve this or to reorganize the page navigation in order to make the tabs more visible.\n\nTranslation and internalization issues\n\nThe Translate extension has proven very useful for translating documentation into various languages. However, the extension only allows an English version to be used as the source text. If a text was originally written in a language other than English, it remains nearly invisible until it is translated into English; however, because the text is not very visible, there is less chance of it being translated. Wikimedia's language support technology relies on English as the language of transit between other languages and as the primary language in which texts are written, despite the fact that it would be technically possible to start with an original version in another language if no English version is available. It would be great if the developers could consider this issue.\n\nFor the schools' Commons partnerships pages, I have used the Translate extension for the page content and translatable templates for the headers. However, when the template is translated into the language of the browser but the pages are not, the links do not work. A better strategy is needed to prevent this from happening. Perhaps conditional expressions with #ifexist could be used, or perhaps this needs to be redesigned completely. Further work is needed on this point.\n\nGuided tour. At Wikimania, I learned about the Guided Tour extension. I think it could be interesting to use this extension as a way to introduce students, lecturers and advisers to Commons and Wikipedia. It could also be used to guide Wikimedians who wish to promote wikiArS through the necessary Commons and Outreach pages. I have not had time to do this. Perhaps someone could take over responsibility for this. It needs to be possible to translate the guides into multiple languages, so it will be necessary to find a way of allowing this with Guided Tour.\n\nPlease provide links to all public, online documents and other artifacts that you created during the course of this project.
