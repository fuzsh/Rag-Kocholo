        "meta_description": "Abstract. The agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia has witnessed rapid growth in both production and area under cultivation over the last few decades. This has prompted some concern over the state and\nfuture availability of fossil groundwater resources, which have been used to drive this\nexpansion. Large-scale studies using satellite gravimetric data show a declining trend over this\nregion. However, water management agencies require much more detailed information on both the\nspatial distribution of agricultural fields and their varying levels of water exploitation through time than coarse gravimetric data can provide. Relying on self-reporting from farm\noperators or sporadic data collection campaigns to obtain needed information are not feasible\noptions, nor do they allow for retrospective assessments. In this work, a water accounting\nframework that combines satellite data, meteorological output from weather prediction models, and\na modified land surface hydrology model was developed to provide information on both irrigated crop water use and groundwater abstraction rates. Results from the local scale, comprising several thousand individual center-pivot fields, were then used to quantify the regional-scale response. To do this, a semi-automated approach for the delineation of center-pivot fields using a\nmulti-temporal statistical analysis of Landsat 8 data was developed. Next, actual crop evaporation\nrates were estimated using a two-source energy balance (TSEB) model driven by leaf area index,\nland surface temperature, and albedo, all of which were derived from Landsat 8. The\nCommunity Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model was then adapted to use satellite-based\nvegetation and related surface variables and forced with a 3âkm reanalysis dataset from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Groundwater abstraction rates were then inferred\nby estimating the irrigation supplied to each individual center pivot, which was determined via an optimization approach that considered CABLE-based estimates of evaporation and TSEB-based satellite estimates. The framework was applied over two study regions in Saudi Arabia: a\nsmall-scale experimental facility of around 40 center pivots in Al Kharj that was used for an initial evaluation and a much larger agricultural region in Al Jawf province comprising more than 5000 individual fields across an area exceeding 2500âkm2. Total groundwater abstraction\nfor the year 2015 in Al Jawf was estimated at approximately 5.5 billion cubic meters, far exceeding any recharge to the groundwater system and further highlighting the need for a\ncomprehensive water management strategy. Overall, this novel dataâmodel fusion approach facilitates the compilation of national-scale groundwater abstractions while also detailing field-scale information that allows both farmers and water management agencies to make informed\nwater accounting decisions across multiple spatial and temporal scales.",

The products were spatially matched using spherical harmonics analysis. The results highlighted the difficulty in obtaining agreement between independent satellite products, even over regions with simple water budgets. However, imposing a time lag on water storage data improved results considerably.\n\nThe physical and biogeochemical parameters along the coastal waters of Saudi Arabia during field surveys in summer, 2021\n\nYasser O.

It is the first multidisciplinary survey within the Saudi Arabian coastal zone, extending from near the Saudi–Jordanian border in the north of the Red Sea to the south close to the Saudi--Yemen border and in the Arabian Gulf. The objective was to record the pollution status along the coastal zone of the kingdom related to specific pressures.\n\nMarine Heatwaves in the Red Sea and their Relationship to Different Climate Modes: A Case Study of the 2010 Events in the Northern Red Sea\n\nManal Hamdeno, Aida Alvera-AzcÃ¡rate, George Krokos, and Ibrahim Hoteit\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-355,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-355, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study focuses on the characteristics of MHWs in the Red Sea during the last four decades. Using satellite-derived sea surface temperatures (SSTs), we found a clear warming trend in the Red Sea since 1994, which has intensified significantly since 2016. This SST rise was associated with an increase in the frequency and days of MHWs. In addition, a correlation was found between the frequency of MHWs and some climate modes, which was more pronounced in some years of the study period.\n\nGRASS COVER, TREE DENSITY, AND LEAF DEVELOPMENT OF MEDITERRANEAN ORCHARDS FROM HIGH RESOLUTION DATA\n\nP.

We then performed a case study using the newly implemented model to study Tropical Cyclone Mekunu, which occurred in the Arabian Sea. We found that the coupled model better simulates the cyclone than the uncoupled model, but the impact of waves on the cyclone is not significant. However, the waves change the sea surface temperature and mixed layer, especially in the cold waves produced due to the cyclone.\n\nINTRA-FIELD CROP YIELD VARIABILITY BY ASSIMILATING CUBESAT LAI IN THE APSIM CROP MODEL\n\nM.

The oceanic component is the MITgcm and the atmospheric component is the WRF model. The coupler is implemented using ESMF according to NUOPC protocols. SKRIPS is demonstrated by simulating a series of extreme heat events occurring in the Red Sea region. We show that SKRIPS is capable of performing coupled oceanâatmosphere simulations. In addition, the scalability test shows SKRIPS is computationally efficient.\n\nPREDICTING BIOMASS AND YIELD AT HARVEST OF SALT-STRESSED TOMATO PLANTS USING UAV IMAGERY\n\nK. Johansen, M. J. L.

This study aimed at better understanding the relationship between characteristics of geological faults (e.g., hypocenter location, rupture size/location, etc.) and resulting ground motion, via statistical analysis of a rupture simulation model. This study provides important insight on ground-motion responses to geological faults.\n\nInferring soil salinity in a drip irrigation system from multi-configuration EMI measurements using adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo\n\nKhan Zaib Jadoon, Muhammad Umer Altaf, Matthew Francis McCabe, Ibrahim Hoteit, Nisar Muhammad, Davood Moghadas, and Lutz WeihermÃ¼ller\n\nHydrol.

Electromagnetic model parameters and uncertainty were estimated using adaptive Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Application of the MCMC-based inversion to the synthetic and field measurements demonstrates that the parameters of the model can be well estimated for the saline soil as compared to the non-saline soil.\n\nPUSHBROOM HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING FROM AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM (UAS) â GEOMETRIC PROCESSINGWORKFLOW AND ACCURACY ASSESSMENT\n\nD.

From advanced space-based sensors to unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based distributed networks, these emergent systems are set to revolutionize our understanding and interpretation of hydrological and related processes.\n\nResponse of water vapour D-excess to land–atmosphere interactions in a semi-arid environment\n\nStephen D. Parkes, Matthew F. McCabe, Alan D. Griffiths, Lixin Wang, Scott Chambers, Ali Ershadi, Alastair G. Williams, Josiah Strauss, and Adrian Element\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 533–548, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-533-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-533-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetermining atmospheric moisture sources is required for understanding the water cycle. The role of land surface fluxes is a particular source of uncertainty for moisture budgets. Water vapour isotopes have the potential to improve constraints on moisture sources. In this work relationships between water vapour isotopes and land–atmosphere exchange are studied. Results show that land surface evaporative fluxes play a minor role in the daytime water and isotope budgets in semi-arid environments.\n\nLand surface albedo and vegetation feedbacks enhanced the millennium drought in south-east Australia\n\nJason P. Evans, Xianhong Meng, and Matthew F. McCabe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 409–422, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-409-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-409-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work demonstrates that changes in surface albedo and vegetation, caused by the millennium drought in south-east Australia, affected the atmosphere in a way that decreased precipitation further. This land–surface feedback increased the severity of the drought by 10 %. This suggests that climate models need to simulate changes in surface characteristics (other than soil moisture) in response to a developing drought if they are to capture this kind of multi-year drought.\n\nEvaluating the hydrological consistency of evaporation products using satellite-based gravity and rainfall data\n\nOliver LÃ³pez, Rasmus Houborg, and Matthew Francis McCabe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 323–343, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-323-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-323-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study evaluated the spatial and temporal consistency of satellite-based hydrological products based on the water budget equation, including three global evaporation products. The products were spatially matched using spherical harmonics analysis. The results highlighted the difficulty in obtaining agreement between independent satellite products, even over regions with simple water budgets. However, imposing a time lag on water storage data improved results considerably.\n\nOn the efficiency of the hybrid and the exact second-order sampling formulations of the EnKF: a reality-inspired 3-D test case for estimating biodegradation rates of chlorinated hydrocarbons at the port of Rotterdam\n\nMohamad E. Gharamti, Johan Valstar, Gijs Janssen, Annemieke Marsman, and Ibrahim Hoteit\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

The presented work is aimed at estimating concentration and biodegradation rates of subsurface contaminants at the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Overall, we found that accounting for both forecast and observation sampling errors in the joint data assimilation system helps recover more accurate state and parameter estimates.\n\nExamining the relationship between intermediate-scale soil moisture and terrestrial evaporation within a semi-arid grassland\n\nRaghavendra B. Jana, Ali Ershadi, and Matthew F. McCabe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

We present an analysis of the link between soil moisture and evaporation estimates from three distinct models. The relationships were examined over nearly 2 years of observation data. Results show that while direct correlations of raw data were mostly not useful, the root-zone soil moisture and the modelled evaporation estimates reflect similar distributions.\n\nA Bayesian consistent dual ensemble Kalman filter for state-parameter estimation in subsurface hydrology\n\nBoujemaa Ait-El-Fquih, Mohamad El Gharamti, and Ibrahim Hoteit\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 3289–3307, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-3289-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-3289-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe derive a new dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for state-parameter estimation. The derivation is based on the one-step-ahead smoothing formulation, and unlike the standard dual EnKF, it is consistent with the Bayesian formulation of the state-parameter estimation problem and uses the observations in both state smoothing and forecast. This is shown to enhance the performance and robustness of the dual EnKF in experiments conducted with a two-dimensional synthetic groundwater aquifer model.\n\nThe WACMOS-ET project – PartÂ 2: Evaluation of global terrestrial evaporation data sets\n\nD.

Evaluation of current evaporation data sets on the global scale showed that they manifest large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into several components. Different models perform better under different conditions, highlighting the potential for considering biome- or climate-specific model ensembles.\n\nThe WACMOS-ET project – PartÂ 1: Tower-scale evaluation of four remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration algorithms\n\nD. Michel, C. JimÃ©nez, D. G. Miralles, M. Jung, M. Hirschi, A. Ershadi, B. Martens, M. F. McCabe, J. B. Fisher, Q. Mu, S. I. Seneviratne, E. F. Wood, and D. FernÃ¡ndez-Prieto\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

The PT-JPL model and GLEAM provide the best performance for satellite and in situ forcing as well as for the different temporal resolutions. PM-MOD and SEBS perform less well: the PM-MOD model generally underestimates, while SEBS generally overestimates ET.\n\nThe GEWEX LandFlux project: evaluation of model evaporation using tower-based and globally gridded forcing data\n\nM. F. McCabe, A. Ershadi, C. Jimenez, D. G. Miralles, D. Michel, and E. F. Wood\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 9, 283–305, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-283-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-283-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn an effort to develop a global terrestrial evaporation product, four models were forced using both a tower and grid-based data set. Comparisons against flux-tower observations from different biome and land cover types show considerable inter-model variability and sensitivity to forcing type. Results suggest that no single model is able to capture expected flux patterns and response. It is suggested that a multi-model ensemble is likely to provide a more stable long-term flux estimate.\n\nTechnical Note: Reducing the spin-up time of integrated surface waterâgroundwater models\n\nH. Ajami, J. P. Evans, M. F. McCabe, and S. Stisen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Results illustrate that the hybrid approach reduced the spin-up period required for an integrated groundwater--surface water--land surface model (ParFlow.CLM) by up to 50%. The methodology is applicable to other coupled or integrated modeling frameworks when initialization from an equilibrium state is required.\n\nBenchmark products for land evapotranspiration: LandFlux-EVAL multi-data set synthesis\n\nB.

Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2651–2659, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2651-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2651-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have developed the first operational system (10 d latency) for estimating irrigation water use from accessible satellite and reanalysis data. As a proof of concept, the method has been implemented over an irrigated area fed by the Kakhovka Reservoir, in Ukraine, which collapsed on June 6, 2023. Estimates for the period 2015–2023 reveal that, as expected, the irrigation season of 2023 was characterized by the lowest amounts of irrigation.\n\nAn inter-comparison of approaches and frameworks to quantify irrigation from satellite data\n\nSÃ¸ren Julsgaard Kragh, Jacopo Dari, Sara Modanesi, Christian Massari, Luca Brocca, Rasmus Fensholt, Simon Stisen, and Julian Koch\n\nHydrol.

To evaluate the methodologies, we compared various approaches to quantify irrigation using soil moisture, evapotranspiration, or both within a novel baseline framework, together with irrigation estimates from other studies. We show that the synergy from using two equally important components in a joint approach within a baseline framework yields better irrigation estimates.\n\nThe Wetland Intrinsic Potential tool: mapping wetland intrinsic potential through machine learning of multi-scale remote sensing proxies of wetland indicators\n\nMeghan Halabisky, Dan Miller, Anthony J. Stewart, Amy Yahnke, Daniel Lorigan, Tate Brasel, and Ludmila Monika Moskal\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

However, in many areas a large proportion of wetlands are unmapped because they are hard to detect in imagery. We developed a machine learning approach using spatially mapped variables of wetland indicators (i.e., vegetation, hydrology, soils), including novel multi-scale topographic indicators, to predict wetland probability. Our approach can be adapted to diverse landscapes to improve wetland detection.\n\nTechnical note: NASAaccess â a tool for access, reformatting, and visualization of remotely sensed earth observation and climate data\n\nIbrahim Nourein Mohammed, Elkin Giovanni Romero Bustamante, John Dennis Bolten, and Everett James Nelson\n\nHydrol.

With our platform scientists, stakeholders and concerned citizens can engage in the exploration, modeling, and understanding of data. We envisioned this platform as lowering the technical barriers and simplifying the process of accessing and leveraging additional modeling frameworks for data.\n\nMonitoring the combined effects of drought and salinity stress on crops using remote sensing in the Netherlands\n\nWen Wen, Joris Timmermans, Qi Chen, and Peter M. van Bodegom\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4537–4552, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4537-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4537-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA novel approach for evaluating individual and combined impacts of drought and salinity in real-life settings is proposed using Sentinel-2. We found that crop responses to drought and salinity differ between growth stages. Compared to salinity, crop growth is most strongly affected by drought stress and is, in general, further exacerbated when co-occurring with salinity stress. Our approach facilitates a way to monitor crop health under multiple stresses with potential large-scale applications.\n\nA framework for irrigation performance assessment using WaPOR data: the case of a sugarcane estate in Mozambique\n\nAbebe D. Chukalla, Marloes L. Mul, Pieter van der Zaag, Gerardo van Halsema, Evaristo Mubaya, EsperanÃ§a Muchanga, Nadja den Besten, and Poolad Karimi\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

We developed a framework and applied the remotely sensed FAO WaPOR dataset to assess uniformity, equity, adequacy, and land and water productivity at the Xinavane sugarcane estate, segmented by three irrigation methods. The developed performance assessment framework and the Python script in Jupyter Notebooks can aid in such irrigation performance analysis in other regions.\n\nSatellite observations reveal 13 years of reservoir filling strategies, operating rules, and hydrological alterations in the Upper Mekong River basin\n\nDung Trung Vu, Thanh Duc Dang, Stefano Galelli, and Faisal Hossain\n\nHydrol.

Here, we rely on satellite observations to reconstruct monthly storage time series for the 10 largest reservoirs in the Lancang. Our analysis shows how quickly reservoirs were filled in, what decisions were made during recent droughts, and how these decisions impacted downstream discharge.\n\nSatellite soil moisture data assimilation for improved operational continental water balance prediction\n\nSiyuan Tian, Luigi J. Renzullo, Robert C. Pipunic, Julien Lerat, Wendy Sharples, and Chantal Donnelly\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

A simple and robust method was developed for an operational water balance model to constrain model predictions temporally and spatially with satellite soil moisture observations. The improved soil water storage prediction can provide constraints in model forecasts that persist for several weeks.\n\nMulti-constellation GNSS interferometric reflectometry with mass-market sensors as a solution for soil moisture monitoring\n\nAngel MartÃ­n, Sara IbÃ¡Ã±ez, Carlos Baixauli, Sara Blanc, and Ana BelÃ©n Anquela\n\nHydrol.

Two main objectives were pursued. The first was the extension of the technique to a multi-constellation solution using GPS, GLONASS, and GALILEO satellites, and the second was to test whether mass-market sensors could be used for this technique.\n\nCan we trust remote sensing evapotranspiration products over Africa?\n\nImeshi Weerasinghe, Wim Bastiaanssen, Marloes Mul, Li Jia, and Ann van Griensven\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1565–1586, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1565-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1565-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater resource allocation to various sectors requires an understanding of the hydrological cycle, where evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component. Satellite-derived products estimate ET but are hard to evaluate at large scales. This work presents an alternate evaluation methodology to point-scale observations in Africa. The paper enables users to select an ET product based on their performance regarding selected criteria using a ranking system. The highest ranked products are WaPOR and CMRSET.\n\nInfluence of multi-decadal land use, irrigation practices and climate on riparian corridors across the Upper Missouri River headwaters basin, Montana\n\nMelanie K. Vanderhoof, Jay R. Christensen, and Laurie C. Alexander\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4269–4292, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4269-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4269-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated trends (1984–2016) in riparian wetness across the Upper Missouri River headwaters basin during peak irrigation months (June, July and August). We found that 8 of the 19 riparian reaches across the basin showed a significant drying trend from 1984 to 2016. The temporal drying trends persisted after removing variability attributable to climate. Instead, the drying trends co-occurred with a shift towards center-pivot irrigation across the basin.\n\nDeveloping GIS-based water poverty and rainwater harvesting suitability maps for domestic use in the Dead Sea region (West Bank, Palestine)\n\nSameer M.

The obtained maps will assist the decision makers to formulate proper strategies including the development of efficient and comprehensive water resource management strategies in trying to bridge the increasing water supply–demand gap for domestic purposes in the West Bank as a recognized area in the Dead Sea region which is facing a series water resource shortage challenges.\n\nEstimating daily evapotranspiration based on a model of evaporative fractionÂ (EF) for mixed pixels\n\nFugen Li, Xiaozhou Xin, Zhiqing Peng, and Qinhuo Liu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

In order to do so, an equation to calculate evapotranspiration fraction (EF) of mixed pixels was derived based on two key hypotheses. The model is easy to apply and is independent and easy to be embedded in the traditional remote sensing algorithms of heat fluxes to get daily ET.\n\nEstimating irrigation water use over the contiguous United States by combining satellite and reanalysis soil moisture data\n\nFelix Zaussinger, Wouter Dorigo, Alexander Gruber, Angelica Tarpanelli, Paolo Filippucci, and Luca Brocca\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 897–923, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-897-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-897-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAbout 70 % of global freshwater is consumed by irrigation. Yet, policy-relevant estimates of irrigation water use (IWU) are virtually lacking at regional to global scales. To bridge this gap, we develop a method for quantifying IWU from a combination of state-of-the-art remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture products and apply it over the United States for the period 2013–2016. Overall, our estimates agree well with reference data on irrigated area and irrigation water withdrawals.\n\nA conceptual model of organochlorine fate from a combined analysis of spatial and mid- to long-term trends of surface and ground water contamination in tropical areas (FWI)\n\nPhilippe Cattan, Jean-Baptiste Charlier, Florence Clostre, Philippe Letourmy, Luc Arnaud, Julie Gresser, and Magalie Jannoyer\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 691–709, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-691-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-691-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the management of long-term environmental pollution by organochlorine pesticides. We selected the case of chlordecone on the island of Martinique. We propose a conceptual model of organochlorine fate accounting for physical conditions relative to soils and geology. This model explains pollution variability in water but also the dynamics of pollution trends. It helps to identify risky areas where pollution will last for a long time and where more attention is needed.\n\nSpatio-temporal assessment of annual water balance models for upper Ganga Basin\n\nAnoop Kumar Shukla, Shray Pathak, Lalit Pal, Chandra Shekhar Prasad Ojha, Ana Mijic, and Rahul Dev Garg\n\nHydrol.

Even in pixel-level computations, experiments are made with existing models of some of the involved parameters. The study indicates not only the suitability of pixel-based computations but also clarifies the suitable model of some of the parameters to be used with pixel-based computations to obtain better results.\n\nPopulation growth, land use and land cover transformations, and water quality nexus in the Upper Ganga River basin\n\nAnoop Kumar Shukla, Chandra Shekhar Prasad Ojha, Ana Mijic, Wouter Buytaert, Shray Pathak, Rahul Dev Garg, and Satyavati Shukla\n\nHydrol.

Therefore, this study could help to assess and solve local and regional WQ-related problems over a river basin. It may help the policy makers and planners to understand the status of water pollution so that suitable strategies could be planned for sustainable development in a river basin.\n\nWetlands inform how climate extremes influence surface water expansion and contraction\n\nMelanie K. Vanderhoof, Charles R. Lane, Michael G. McManus, Laurie C. Alexander, and Jay R. Christensen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1851–1873, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1851-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1851-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEffective monitoring and prediction of flood and drought events requires an improved understanding of surface water dynamics. We examined how the relationship between surface water extent, as mapped using Landsat imagery, and climate, is a function of landscape characteristics, using the Prairie Pothole Region and adjacent Northern Prairie in the United States as our study area. We found that at a landscape scale wetlands play a key role in informing how climate extremes influence surface water.\n\nParticipatory flood vulnerability assessment: aÂ multi-criteria approach\n\nMariana Madruga de Brito, Mariele Evers, and Adrian Delos Santos Almoradie\n\nHydrol.

Sci., 22, 373–390, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-373-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-373-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper sheds light on the integration of interdisciplinary knowledge in the assessment of flood vulnerability in Taquari-Antas river basin, Brazil. It shows how stakeholder participation is crucial for increasing not only the acceptance of model results but also its quality.\n\nMonitoring small reservoirs' storage with satellite remote sensing in inaccessible areas\n\nNicolas Avisse, Amaury Tilmant, Marc FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, and Hua Zhang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 6445–6459, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6445-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6445-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInformation on small reservoir storage is crucial for water management in a river basin. However, it is most of the time not freely available in remote, ungauged, or conflict-torn areas. We propose a novel approach using satellite imagery information only to quantitatively estimate storage variations in such inaccessible areas. We apply the method to southern Syria, where ground monitoring is impeded by the ongoing civil war, and validate it against in situ measurements in neighbouring Jordan.\n\nPerformance of the METRIC model in estimating evapotranspiration fluxes over an irrigated field in Saudi Arabia using Landsat-8 images\n\nRangaswamy Madugundu, Khalid A. Al-Gaadi, ElKamil Tola, Abdalhaleem A. Hassaballa, and Virupakshagouda C. Patil\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 6135–6151, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6135-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6135-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn view of the pressing need to assess the productivity of agricultural fields in Saudi Arabia, this study was undertaken in an attempt to apply the METRIC model with Landsat-8 imagery for the determination of spatial and temporal variability in ET aiming at optimizing the quantification of crop water requirement and the formulation of efficient irrigation schedules. This paper will be of great interest to readers in the areas of agriculture (in general), water management and remote sensing.\n\nThe predictability of reported drought events and impacts in the Ebro Basin using six different remote sensing data sets\n\nClara LinÃ©s, Micha Werner, and Wim Bastiaanssen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 4747–4765, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4747-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4747-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper aims at identifying Earth observation data sets that can help river basin managers detect drought conditions that may lead to impacts early enough to take mitigation actions. Six remote sensing products were assessed using two types of impact data as a benchmark: media records from a regional newspaper and crop yields. Precipitation, vegetation condition and evapotranspiration products showed the best results, offering early signs of impacts up to 6 months before the reported damages.\n\nA multi-sensor data-driven methodology for all-sky passive microwave inundation retrieval\n\nZeinab Takbiri, Ardeshir M. Ebtehaj, and Efi Foufoula-Georgiou\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2685–2700, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-2685-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-2685-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a multi-sensor retrieval algorithm for flood extent mapping at high spatial and temporal resolution. While visible bands provide flood mapping at fine spatial resolution, their capability is very limited in a cloudy sky. Passive microwaves can penetrate through clouds but cannot detect small-scale flooded surfaces due to their coarse resolution. The proposed method takes advantage of these two observations to retrieve sub-pixel flooded surfaces in all-sky conditions.\n\nEffect of the revisit interval and temporal upscaling methods on the accuracy of remotely sensed evapotranspiration estimates\n\nJoseph G. Alfieri, Martha C. Anderson, William P. Kustas, and Carmelo Cammalleri\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 83–98, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-83-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-83-2017, 2017\n\nDownstream ecosystem responses to middle reach regulation of river discharge in the Heihe River Basin, China\n\nYan Zhao, Yongping Wei, Shoubo Li, and Bingfang Wu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 4469–4481, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4469-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4469-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper finds that combined inflow from both current and previous years' discharge determines water availability in downstream regions. Temperature determines broad vegetation distribution while hydrological variables show significant effects only in near-river-channel regions. Agricultural development curtailed further vegetation recovery in the studied area. Enhancing current water allocation schemes and regulating regional agricultural activities are required for future restoration.\n\nCombining satellite observations to develop a global soil moisture product for near-real-time applications\n\nMarkus Enenkel, Christoph Reimer, Wouter Dorigo, Wolfgang Wagner, Isabella Pfeil, Robert Parinussa, and Richard De Jeu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 4191–4208, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4191-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4191-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoil moisture is a crucial variable for a variety of applications, ranging from weather forecasting and agricultural production to the monitoring of floods and droughts. Satellite observations are particularly important in regions where no in situ measurements are available. Our study presents a method to integrate global near-real-time satellite observations from different sensors into one harmonized, daily data set. A first validation shows good results on a global scale.\n\nSupplemental irrigation potential and impact on downstream flow of Karkheh River basin in Iran\n\nBehzad Hessari, Adriana Bruggeman, Ali Mohammad Akhoond-Ali, Theib Oweis, and Fariborz Abbasi\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1903–1910, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1903-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1903-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nYields of rainfed winter crops such as wheat can be substantially improved with limited supplemental irrigation. The upper Karkheh River basin in Iran has 15 840 km2 of rainfed crops. A GIS method was designed to identify suitable areas for irrigation and a routine was developed to allocate water uses and route the flows downstream. A maximum of 13 % of the rainfed cropland could be irrigated under normal flow, 9 % if environmental flow requirements are considered and 6 % under drought conditions.\n\nMapping evapotranspiration with high-resolution aircraft imagery over vineyards using one- and two-source modeling schemes\n\nTing Xia, William P. Kustas, Martha C. Anderson, Joseph G. Alfieri, Feng Gao, Lynn McKee, John H. Prueger, Hatim M. E. Geli, Christopher M. U. Neale, Luis Sanchez, Maria Mar Alsina, and Zhongjing Wang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1523–1545, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1523-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1523-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes a model inter-comparison and validation study conducted using sub-meter resolution thermal data from an aircraft. The model inter-comparison is between a physically based model and a very simple empirical model. The strengths and weaknesses of both modeling approaches for high-resolution mapping of water use in vineyards is described. The findings provide significant insight into the utility of complex versus simple models for precise water resources management.\n\nSpatial evapotranspiration, rainfall and land use data in water accounting – Part 1: Review of the accuracy of the remote sensing data\n\nP.
