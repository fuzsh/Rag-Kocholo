        "text": "🤚🏼🛑 Humanities Resurgence in times of AI (personal reflection) (English version below) Esta foto representa la unión de las Humanidades (mi hija, Natalia, historiadora del arte) y la Tecnología (y yo, que hago lo que puedo😅 ) en el escenario del anfiteatro romano de Ploviv, una de las ciudades más antiguas de Europa. Para mi, creyente acérrimo en el empoderamiento del Ser Humano, la Inteligencia Artificial supondrá una evolución hacia una Sociedad más justa y, sobre todo, más humana. ¿Por qué? Pues porque la IA nos hace enfrentarnos, más que nunca, a conceptos como el Bien y el Mal, subraya carencias como el racismo, el sexismo o la violencia y nos empuja a ser más inclusivos y diversos. ¿Por qué? Porque las consecuencias de todo lo anterior, las sufrimos todos y la única manera de evitar el desastre es tomar nosotros mismos las riendas de la responsabilidad y nuestro destino y caminar, por fin, hacia el equilibrio entre la Razón y el Corazón. Y a ti, ¿qué te mueve? --- This picture represents the union of the Humanities (my daughter Natalia, an art historian) and Technology (and me, well...doing my best 😅). For me, a firm believer in the empowerment of the Human Being, Artificial Intelligence will mean an evolution towards a more just and, above all, more human Society. Why? Because AI forces us, more than ever, to confront concepts such as Good and Bad, highlights shortcomings like racism, sexism, or violence, and pushes us to be more inclusive and diverse. Why? Because the consequences of all the above affect us all, and the only way to avoid disaster is to take responsibility and our destiny into our own hands and finally walk towards the balance between Reason and Heart. What is going to be your role then? әʌ!ʇɔәdsɹәd ɹәɥʇouɐ ɯoɹɟ ʎʇ!|ɐәɹ ɹnoʎ әәs noʎ d|әɥ ! '!ɐ puɐ s!dɐ ƃu!sn 𝗟𝗶𝗸𝗲𝗱 this post? 𝗙𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗺𝗲 for regular insights.

It's an honor to be a part of the scientific committee and share insights on Multimodal AI Agents for API Integrations. In this talk, I'll explore how multimodal AI agents—capable of processing and integrating data from various sources such as text, images, and voice—can revolutionize the way APIs are utilized. By leveraging multiple data channels, these agents can provide richer, more context-aware interactions and significantly streamline complex workflows. 💡You're still on time to join us: https://lnkd.in/dNDcacYh A special thanks to Miss.Tuppari Prashanthi for trusting me with this opportunity and to Tim Dutta and the APIDNA team for their invaluable support in preparing for the talk.

Limited online banking access, disrupted mobile apps, and failed transactions painted a stark picture of our reliance on technology. I'm sharing here her article (link below) explaining what happened and how the upcoming #DORA regulation can help them build resilience against future disruptions. ️ Let's discuss how we can ensure uninterrupted service and maintain customer trust in a constantly evolving technological landscape. I'm reading your comments! ✍ ✍ ✍ Link to the article: https://lnkd.in/d44qCf9a #apinity #financialservices #cybersecurity #DORA #resilience #financialsector #banking 𝗟𝗶𝗸𝗲𝗱 this post?

It's true that haven't meet in person but everything seems to say that this next season this bug is going to be fixed. ▶ Inga, I'm more than glad for having you in this boat..Now I understand why is not \"Tim & David's show\"...You're a big part on this. Probably, the only one with common sense 😂 ...but no so much 🙊 We are planning to be back after this summer (in the North Hemisphere) and winter (in the South Hemisphere) - we are global and almost intergalactic - so, stay tuned and enjoy your break and your life. Thanks so much Inga and Tim for being there and always a corner of exciting laughts and fun in my life. See you on the try line!\n\n🤚🏼 🛑 APIs: The Digital Backbone for DORA and FiDA Compliance In the ever-evolving financial landscape, staying compliant with regulations like the Digital Operational Resilience Act (#DORA) and Financial Data Access (#FiDA) is crucial. But did you know that #APIs play a pivotal role in achieving this? In this article I briefly explore how APIs are the backbone of regulatory compliance as they: ▶ Enhance Third-Party Risk Management ▶ Streamline Incident Reporting and Response ▶ Facilitate Comprehensive Testing ▶ Enable Secure Data Portability and Interoperability ▶ Ensure Robust Authentication and Authorization ▶ Enhance Monitoring and Logging ▶ Support Data Encryption and Privacy What is your experience and challenges with DORA and FiDA?
