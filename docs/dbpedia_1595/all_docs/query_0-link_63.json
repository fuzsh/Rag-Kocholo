        "text": "Threat of a sinkhole: A reevaluation of Cavern 4, Bayou Choctaw salt dome, Louisiana\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNeal, J.T.; Todd, J.L.; Linn, J.K.\n\n1993-09-01\n\nCavern Lake at Bayou Choctaw salt dome resulted from the failure of Cavern 7 in 1954. Uncontrolled solutioning of this cavern through the thin caprock had set the stage for overburden to collapse into the cavern below. A similar situation developed with nearby Cavern 4, but with less dissolutioning of the caprock. Because pressure loss was already a problem and because another 800 ft diameter lake would have endangered surface operations, solutioning of Cavern 4 was stopped and the cavern abandoned in 1957 in order to protect the already-small site. In 1978 the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) acquired a numbermoreÂ Â» of caverns at Bayou Choctaw, including Cavern 4, and the possible repeat of the Cavern 7 failure and formation of another lake thus became an issue. The cavern dimensions were re-sonared in 1980 for comparison with 1963 and 1977 surveys. Annual surface leveling between 1982--1992 showed less subsidence occurring than the site average, and a cavern monitoring system, installed in 1984, has revealed no anomalous motion. Repeat sonar surveys in 1992 showed very little, if any, change occurred since 1980 although a small amount of uncertainty exists as a result of changing sonar techniques. We conclude that significant additional solutioning or erosion of the caprock has not occurred and that there is no increased threat to SPR operations.Â«Â less\n\nExpansion analyses of strategic petroleum reserve in Bayou Choctaw : revised locations.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEhgartner, Brian L.; Park, Byoung Yoon\n\n2010-11-01\n\nThis report summarizes a series of three-dimensional simulations for the Bayou Choctaw Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The U.S. Department of Energy plans to leach two new caverns and convert one of the existing caverns within the Bayou Choctaw salt dome to expand its petroleum reserve storage capacity. An existing finite element mesh from previous analyses is modified by changing the locations of two caverns. The structural integrity of the three expansion caverns and the interaction between all the caverns in the dome are investigated. The impacts of the expansion on underground creep closure, surface subsidence, infrastructure, and well integrity are quantified.moreÂ Â» Two scenarios were used for the duration and timing of workover conditions where wellhead pressures are temporarily reduced to atmospheric pressure. The three expansion caverns are predicted to be structurally stable against tensile failure for both scenarios. Dilatant failure is not expected within the vicinity of the expansion caverns. Damage to surface structures is not predicted and there is not a marked increase in surface strains due to the presence of the three expansion caverns. The wells into the caverns should not undergo yield. The results show that from a structural viewpoint, the locations of the two newly proposed expansion caverns are acceptable, and all three expansion caverns can be safely constructed and operated.Â«Â less\n\nBayou Choctaw Well Integrity Grading Component Based on Geomechanical Simulation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPark, Byoung\n\n2016-09-08\n\nThis letter report provides a Bayou Choctaw (BC) Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) well grading system based on the geomechanical simulation. The analyses described in this letter were used to evaluate the cavernsâ geomechanical effect on wellbore integrity, which is an important component in the well integrity grading system recently developed by Roberts et al. [2015]. Using these analyses, the wellbores for caverns BC-17 and 20 are expected to be significantly impacted by cavern geomechanics, BC-18 and 19 are expected to be medium impacted; and the other caverns are expected to be less impacted.\n\nSonar atlas of caverns comprising the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Volume 1, Bayou Choctaw site, Louisiana.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRautman, Christopher Arthur; Lord, Anna Snider\n\n2007-10-01\n\nDownhole sonar surveys from the four active U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve sites have been modeled and used to generate a four-volume sonar atlas, showing the three-dimensional geometry of each cavern. This volume 1 focuses on the Bayou Choctaw SPR site, located in southern Louisiana. Volumes 2, 3, and 4, respectively, present images for the Big Hill SPR site, Texas, the Bryan Mound SPR site, Texas, and the West Hackberry SPR site, Louisiana. The atlas uses a consistent presentation format throughout. The basic geometric measurements provided by the down-cavern surveys have also been used to generate a number of geometric attributes,moreÂ Â» the values of which have been mapped onto the geometric form of each cavern using a color-shading scheme. The intent of the various geometrical attributes is to highlight deviations of the cavern shape from the idealized cylindrical form of a carefully leached underground storage cavern in salt. The atlas format does not allow interpretation of such geometric deviations and anomalies. However, significant geometric anomalies, not directly related to the leaching history of the cavern, may provide insight into the internal structure of the relevant salt dome.Â«Â less\n\nHexahedral Finite Element Mesh Capturing Realistic Geometries of Bayou Choctaw Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPark, B. Y.; Roberts, B. L.; Sobolik, S. R.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) stores crude oil in 60 caverns located at four sites located along the Gulf Coast. As a matter of normal operation of caverns in a salt dome, the continuous mechanical creep of salt, along with the change in internal cavern and casing pressure due to cavern closure and fluid exchanges, impose several mechanical conditions on the skin, well, and casing of a cavern that could potentially create damage. Sandia, on behalf of DOE, is evaluating the structural integrity of the salt surrounding existing caverns in the Bayou Choctaw (BC) salt dome in Louisiana. In reality, the geometry, spacing, and depths of the caverns are irregular. It is not easy to realize the naturally and artificially formed cavern and salt dome for numerical analysis. It is harder to convert the geometries into the meshed mass consisting of only hexahedral finite elements. A three-dimensional (3D) finite element mesh capturing realistic geometries of the Bayou Choctaw site has been constructed using the seismic and sonar survey data obtained from the field (see Figures below). The mesh consists of hexahedral elements because the salt constitutive model is coded using hexahedral elements. Techniques to reduce the number of elements as much as possible to save on computer run time while maintaining computational accuracy are also developed. These methodologies could also be applied to construct computational meshes for the Big Hill, Bryan Mound, and West Hackberry SPR sites. The methodology could be applied to the complicated shape masses for not only various civil and geological structures but also biological applications such as artificial limbs. The newly developed mesh is expected to provide more accurate solutions of geotechnical concerns that arise due to the close proximity of the caverns to each other or to the edge of salt. Also, there are nine abandoned caverns, one of which is believed to be in a quasi-stable condition. Stability issues for these\n\nConversion of the Bayou Choctaw geological site characterization report to a three-dimensional model.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStein, Joshua S.; Rautman, Christopher Arthur\n\n2004-02-01\n\nThe geologic model implicit in the original site characterization report for the Bayou Choctaw Strategic Petroleum Reserve Site near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has been converted to a numerical, computer-based three-dimensional model. The original site characterization model was successfully converted with minimal modifications and use of new information. The geometries of the salt diapir, selected adjacent sedimentary horizons, and a number of faults have been modeled. Models of a partial set of the several storage caverns that have been solution-mined within the salt mass are also included. Collectively, the converted model appears to be a relatively realistic representation of the geologymoreÂ Â» of the Bayou Choctaw site as known from existing data. A small number of geometric inconsistencies and other problems inherent in 2-D vs. 3-D modeling have been noted. Most of the major inconsistencies involve faults inferred from drill hole data only. Modem computer software allows visualization of the resulting site model and its component submodels with a degree of detail and flexibility that was not possible with conventional, two-dimensional and paper-based geologic maps and cross sections. The enhanced visualizations may be of particular value in conveying geologic concepts involved in the Bayou Choctaw Strategic Petroleum Reserve site to a lay audience. A Microsoft WindowsTM PC-based viewer and user-manipulable model files illustrating selected features of the converted model are included in this report.Â«Â less\n\nGeomechanical Simulation of Bayou Choctaw Strategic Petroleum Reserve - Model Calibration.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPark, Byoung\n\n2017-02-01\n\nA finite element numerical analysis model has been constructed that consists of a realistic mesh capturing the geometries of Bayou Choctaw (BC) Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) site and multi - mechanism deformation ( M - D ) salt constitutive model using the daily data of actual wellhead pressure and oil - brine interface. The salt creep rate is not uniform in the salt dome, and the creep test data for BC salt is limited. Therefore, the model calibration is necessary to simulate the geomechanical behavior of the salt dome. The cavern volumetric closures of SPR caverns calculated from CAVEMAN aremoreÂ Â» used for the field baseline measurement. The structure factor, A 2 , and transient strain limit factor, K 0 , in the M - D constitutive model are used for the calibration. The A 2 value obtained experimentally from the BC salt and K 0 value of Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) salt are used for the baseline values. T o adjust the magnitude of A 2 and K 0 , multiplication factors A2F and K0F are defined, respectively. The A2F and K0F values of the salt dome and salt drawdown skins surrounding each SPR cavern have been determined through a number of back fitting analyses. The cavern volumetric closures calculated from this model correspond to the predictions from CAVEMAN for six SPR caverns. Therefore, this model is able to predict past and future geomechanical behaviors of the salt dome, caverns, caprock , and interbed layers. The geological concerns issued in the BC site will be explained from this model in a follow - up report .Â«Â less\n\nA validation test for Adagio through replication of Big Hill and Bayou Choctaw JAS3D models.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPark, Byoung Yoon\n\n2013-06-01\n\nJAS3D, a three dimensional iterative solid mechanics code, has been used for structural analyses for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve system since the 1990s. JAS3D is no longer supported by Sandia National Laboratories, and has been replaced by Adagio. To validate the transition from JAS3D to Adagio, the existing JAS3D input decks and user subroutines for Bayou Choctaw and Big Hill models were converted for use with Adagio. The calculation results from the Adagio runs are compared to the JAS3D. Since the Adagio results are very similar to the JAS3D results, Adagio is judged to be performing satisfactorily.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRoberts, Barry L; Lord, David; Lord, Anna C.

The grading included consideration of all 15 wells at the Bayou Choctaw site, with each active well receiving a separate grade for remediation and monitoring. Numerous factors affecting well integrity were incorporated into the grading including casing survey results, cavern pressure history, results from geomechanical simulations, and site geologic factors. The factors and grading framework used here are the same as those used in developing similar well remediation and monitoring priorities at the Big Hill,moreÂ Â» Bryan Mound, and West Hackberry Strategic Petroleum Reserve Sites.Â«Â less\n\nSonar atlas of caverns comprising the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

This information is important for assessing the SPRâs ability to deliver oil to domestic oil companies expeditiously if national or world events dictate a rapid sale and deployment of the oil reserves. What factors go into assessing available drawdowns? The evaluation of drawdown risks require the consideration of several factors regarding cavern and wellbore integrity and stability, including stress states caused by cavern geometrymoreÂ Â» and operations, salt damage caused by dilatant and tensile stresses, the effect on enhanced creep on wellbore integrity, the sympathetic stress effect of operations on neighboring caverns. Based on the work over the past several months, a consensus has been built regarding the assessment of drawdown capabilities and risks for the SPR caverns. This paper draws upon the recently West Hackberry model upgrade and analyses to reevaluate and update the available drawdowns for each of those caverns. Similar papers for the Bryan Mound, Big Hill, and Bayou Choctaw papers will be developed as the upgrades to those analyses are completed. The rationale and documentation of the methodology is described in the remainder of this report, as are the updated estimates of available drawdowns for the West Hackberry caverns.Â«Â less\n\n75 FR 52937 - Turtle Bayou Gas Storage Company, LLC; Notice of Application\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-08-30\n\n...] Turtle Bayou Gas Storage Company, LLC; Notice of Application August 20, 2010.

In addition to CRF history, the authors investigated the frequency of apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) genotype andplasma homocysteine (HC) levels. The authors compared 39 Choctaw Indians with AD and 39 Choctaw Indians without AD to 39 white persons with AD with all groups similar in age. CRF history included diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol or hypolipidemic agent use, or myocardial infarction. The authors also compared plasma HC concentration and apoE4 allele frequency. Choctaw persons with AD differed significantly from white persons with AD in history of hypertension, diabetes, and in HC values but not from Indians without AD. There was a significantly lower apoE4 allele frequency in Choctaw Indian AD than white persons with AD, and both AD groups had an affected first degree relative significantly more often than Indian controls. There was no relationship between the number of CRF and age at onset among Indians or whites, whereas HC concentration was associated with significantly earlier age of onset for Choctaw Indians but not for whites. This small study suggests that in Choctaw Indians modifiable risk factors may play more of a role in disease pathogenesis than in whites and that nonmodifiable risk factors such as apoE4 may play less of a role.\n\nThe Choctaw Home-Centered Family Education Demonstration Project.

The salt creep rate is not uniform in the salt dome, and the creep test data for BC salt are limited. Therefore, the model calibration is necessary to simulate the geomechanical behavior of the salt dome. The cavern volumetric closures of SPR caverns calculated from CAVEMAN are used as the field baseline measurement. The structure factor, A 2, and transient strain limit factor, K 0, in the M-D constitutive model are used for the calibration. The value of A 2, obtained experimentally from BC salt, and the value of K 0, obtained from Waste Isolation Pilot Plant salt, are used for the baseline values. To adjust the magnitude of A 2 and K 0, multiplication factors A 2 F and K 0 F are defined, respectively.

The cavern volumetric closures calculated from this model correspond to the predictions from CAVEMAN for six SPR caverns. Therefore, this model is able to predict behaviors of the salt dome, caverns, caprock, and interbed layers.

A large swamp abuts the eastern bank of the bayou. Cores were taken from 15 baldcypress [Taxodium distichum (L.) Richard] trees growing in the swamp along a 610-m transect (nine trees) and a 183-m transect (six trees) running perpendicular from the spoil bank. The cores were crossdated, annual rings were measured, and 5-yr segments of the cores were prepared and analyzed for heavy metals. Soil samples were collected along one transect and analyzed for metals. Levels of Pb in Bayou Trepagnier swamp trees were compared to levels in nine baldcypress trees growing along Stinking Bayou, a reference area. During the last 100 yr, Pb in growth rings of swamp baldcypress trees averaged 8.6 mg/kg (SD 4.88) along one transect and 7.9 mg/kg (SD 5.39) along the other. Lead in the soil along the first transect dropped from >2700 mg/kg (spoil bank) to 10 mg/kg at 420 m into the swamp. Baldcypress trees growing near the refinery on the spoil bank along Bayou Trepagnier (covered in an earlier study) averaged 4.5 mg/kg Pb, and trees along Stinking Bayou averaged 2.1 mg/kg. Trees in the swamp soil with 10 to 425 mg/kg Pb concentrated much more Pb than trees growing on the heavily polluted bank. Greater uptake of Pb by trees in the swamp is discussed in terms of soil dynamics and Pb sources.\n\n77 FR 27763 - Quantum Choctaw Power, LLC, USG Nevada LLC, et al.; Notice of Effectiveness of Exempt Wholesale...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-05-11\n\n...

Water-quality data-collection surveys consisted of synoptic 24-hour continuous measurements of water temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen at the five sites and periodically collected samples at four sites analyzed for several properties and constituents of interest. Stream-habitat data were collected at each of four sites three times during the study. At each site, a representative stream reach was selected and within this reach, five evenly spaced stream transects were determined. At each transect, stream attributes (wetted channel width, water depth, bottom material, instream cover) and riparian attributes (bank slope and erosion potential, width of natural vegetation, type of vegetation, percentage tree canopy) were measured. Benthic macroinvertebrate and fish data were collected from the same reaches identified for habitat evaluation. A total of 2,572 macroinvertebrate individuals were identified from the four reaches; insect taxa were more abundant than non-insect taxa at all reaches. A total of 1,082 fish, representing 30 species and 13 families, were collected across all reaches. Stream-habitat and aquatic biota (benthic macroinvertebrates and fish) were assessed at the four sites to evaluate aquatic life use. Habitat quality index scores generally indicated 'intermediate' aquatic life use at most reaches. Benthic macroinvertebrate metrics scores indicated generally 'intermediate' aquatic life use for the West Fork Double Bayou reaches and generally 'high' aquatic life use for the Cotton Bayou and Hackberry Gully reaches.

Agriculture, population growth, and industrial activities are significant sources of nitrogen inputs for surface waters. Increased nitrogen loading stimulates eutrophication through algal blooms, which leads to an overall decrease in drinking water and aquatic habitat quality. Bayou Chico, a highly urbanized watershed in the Pensacola Bay system in northwest Florida, is a nutrient-impaired waterbody under management to reduce bacteria and nutrient loadings, in accordance with the Florida Department of Environmental Protectionâs (FDEP) Basin Management Action Plan. Best management practices and green infrastructure (GI) throughout Bayou Chico help reduce nitrogen inputs by retaining and filtering water. GI can function as a nitrogen sink by sorption or infiltration into soils, sequestration into plant material, and denitrification through microbial processes. However, a better understanding of the efficiency of these systems is needed to better inform management practices on future nitrogen reduction. This project will address two issues relating to the presence of nitrogen in the Bayou Chico watershed: 1) the identification of specific nitrogen sources within urbanized areas, and 2) the potential rates of nitrogen removal and sequestration from GI and nitrogen transport throughout the bayou.

When oil is stored in domal salts, gases intrude into the stored oil from the surrounding salt. Aspects of the mechanism of gas intrusion have been examined. In all cases, this gas intrusion results in increases in the oil vapor pressure. Data that have been gathered from 1993 to August 2002 are presented to show the resultant increases in bubble-point pressure on a cavern-by-cavern as well as on a stream basis. The measurement techniques are presented with particular emphasis on the TVP 95. Data analysis methods aremoreÂ Â» presented to show the methods required to obtain recombined cavern oil compositions. Gas-oil ratios are also computed from the data and are presented on a cavern-by-cavern and stream basis. The observed increases in bubble-point pressure and gas-oil ratio are further statistically analyzed to allow data interpretation. Emissions plume modeling is used to determine adherence to state air regulations. Gas intrusion is observed to be variable among the sites and within each dome. Gas intrusions at Bryan Mound and Big Hill have resulted in the largest increases in bubble-point pressure for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The streams at Bayou Choctaw and West Hackberry show minimal bubble-point pressure increases. Emissions plume modeling, using the state mandated ISCST code, of oil storage tanks showed that virtually no gas may be released when H2S standards are considered. DOE plans to scavenge H2S to comply with the very tight standards on this gas. With the assumption of scavenging, benzene releases become the next most controlling factor. Model results show that a GOR of 0.6 SCF/BBL may be emissions that are within standards. Employing the benzene gas release standard will significantly improve oil deliverability. New plume modeling using the computational fluid dynamics code, FLUENT, is addressing limitations of the state mandated ISCST model.Â«Â less\n\nMetal contamination of sediments and soils of Bayou Saint John: a potential health impact to local fishermen?\n\nPubMed\n\nWelt, Marc; Mielke, Howard W; Gonzales, Chris; Cooper, Kora M; Batiste, Corey G; Cresswell, Lawrence H; Mielke, Paul W\n\n2003-12-01\n\nThis research examines the pattern of sediment contamination of an urban bayou of New Orleans (formerly a natural waterway) and the potential for human exposure from consumption of fish caught in the bayou. Sediments and soils of Bayou Saint John were evaluated for lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd). Sediment cores were collected at bridges (n = 130) and sites between the bridges (n = 303) of the bayou. In addition, soil samples (n = 66) were collected along the banks of the bayou. Sediments below the bridges contain significantly more (p-value approximately 10(-7)) Pb and Zn (medians of 241 and 230 mg kg(-1), respectively) than bayou sediments located between bridges (medians of 64 and 77 mg kg(-1), respectively). Sediments below bridges of the upper reaches of the bayou contain significantly larger amounts of metals (p < 10(-14) for Pb and Zn and p approximately 10(-8) for Cd) (medians of 329, 383 and 1.5, respectively) than sediments below bridges in the lower reaches of the bayou (medians of 43, 31 and 0.5 for Pb, Zn and Cd, respectively). Likewise, medians for sediments located between bridges contain significantly (p < 10(-14)) higher quantities of Pb, Zn and Cd (170, 203 and 1.8 mg kg(-1), respectively) in the upper bayou than Pb, Zn, and Cd (48, 32, and 0.8 mg kg(-1), respectively) in the lower reaches of the bayou. The potential risk for human exposure may be magnified by the fact that fishing generally occurs from the numerous bridges that cross the bayou. Poor and minority people do most of the fishing. Most people (87%) indicated they ate fish they caught from the Bayou.\n\nPostsecondary Transitions of Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians Tribal Scholarship Program Students\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCarlyle, Gregory A.; Thompson, Nicole L.; Hare, R.

In most cases, the brine outflow from an opened cavern is slow; it results from the cavern creep closure and the thermal expansion of the cavern brine. These two processes are smooth; however, the brine outflow often is bumpy, as it is modulated by atmospheric pressure variations that generate an elastic increase (or decrease) of both cavern and brine volumes. In addition, when the flow is fast enough, the brine thermodynamic behavior in the wellbore is adiabatic. The cold brine expelled from the cavern wellhead is substituted with warm brine entering the borehole bottom, resulting in a lighter brine column. The brine outflow increases. In some cases, the flow becomes so fast that inertia terms must be taken into account. A geyser forms, coming to an end when the pressure in the cavern has dropped sufficiently. A better picture is obtained when head losses are considered. A closed-form solution can be reached. This proves that two cases must be distinguished, depending on whether the cold brine initially contained in the wellbore is expelled fully or not. It can also be shown that geyser formation is a rare event, as it requires both that the wellbore be narrow and that the cavern be very compressible. This study stemmed from an actual example in which a geyser was observed. However, scarce information is available, making any definite interpretation difficult. xml:lang=\"fr\"\n\n33 CFR 207.185 - Taylors Bayou, Tex., Beaumont Navigation District Lock; use, administration, and navigation.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-07-01\n\n... 33 Navigation and Navigable Waters 3 2011-07-01 2011-07-01 false Taylors Bayou, Tex., Beaumont Navigation District Lock; use, administration, and navigation. 207.185 Section 207.185 Navigation and...

Bayou Chico has water quality problems attributed to its low flushing rate and urban/industrial land use in its watershed. The sampling scheme assessed the within-sampling station and spatial variability of measurement endpoints. Fourteen sampling stations in Bayou Chico and 3 stations in Pensacola Bay were selected based on an intensified EMAP sampling grid. Time and space coordinated sampling was conducted for: sediment contaminants and properties, sediment toxicity, water quality, benthic infauna,moreÂ Â» zooplankton and phytoplankton populations. Fish and crabs were also collected and analyzed for a suite of biomarkers and organic chemical residues. Primary productivity was measured via the light bottle dark bottle oxygen method and via diurnal oxygen measurements made with continuous recording data sondes. Stream sites were evaluated for water and sediment quality, water and sediment toxicity, benthic invertebrates and fish. Watershed analyses included assessment of land use/landcover (via SPOT and TM images), soils, pollution sources (point and non-point) and hydrography. These data were coordinated via an Arc/Info GIS system for display and spatial analysis. 1994 survey data were used to parameterize environmental fate models such as SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), DYNHYD5 (WASP5 hydrodynamics model) and WASP5 (Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program) to make predictions about the dynamics and fate of chemical contaminants in Bayou Chico. This paper will present an overview, and report on the results in regards to within-site and spatial variability in Bayou Chico. Conclusions on the efficacy of the assessment and measurement endpoints in evaluating the condition (health) of Bayou Chico will be presented.Â«Â less\n\n76 FR 73619 - Quantum Choctaw Power, LLC; Supplemental Notice That Initial Market-Based Rate Filing Includes...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-11-29\n\n...

Cavernous malformations are associated with developmental venous anomalies that occur sporadically or in familial form. Patients with a cavernous malformation can present with headaches, seizures, sensorimotor disturbances, or focal neurologic deficits based on the anatomic location of the lesion. Patients with infratentorial lesions present more commonly with a focal neurologic deficit. Cavernous malformations are increasingly discovered incidentally due to the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging. Understanding the natural history of these lesions is essential to their management. Observation and surgical resection are both reasonable options in the treatment of patients with these lesions. The clinical presentation of the patient, the location of the lesion, and the surgical risk assessment all play critical roles in management decision-making. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The study was done as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Monitoring for Public Access and Community Tracking (EMPACT) program. The EMPACT program was designed for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to work with communities to âmake timely, accurate, and understandable environmental information available to millions of people in the largest metropolitan areas across the country.â (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2000). Buffalo Bayou, located in Houston, Texas, was chosen as a pilot project because it is a frequently used recreational water source, it has many water-treatment facilities located along its stream segments, and it has a history of water-quality problems (Houston-Galveston Area Council, 2000). One component of the pilot project is to develop a water-quality simulation model that can be used to assess the effects of noncompliance events on Buffalo Bayou. Because accurate estimates of time of travel during low flow are required to develop the model, the time of travel of solutes in Buffalo Bayou and selected tributaries was determined using dye tracing methods. The study was conducted during low flow in a 38.7-mile reach of Buffalo Bayou, a 9.6-mile reach of Whiteoak Bayou, a 5.9-mile reach of Mason Creek, and a 6.6-mile reach of Bear Creek. Efforts to determine the time of travel in a 7.5-mile reach of Horsepen Creek were unsuccessful.

The oil is stored in multiple salt caverns spread over four sites in Louisiana and Texas. Cavern infrastructure near the bottom of the cavern can be damaged from vertical floor movement. This report presents a comprehensive history of floor movements in each cavern. Most of the cavern floor rise rates ranged from 0.5-3.5 ft/yr, however, there were several caverns with much higher rise rates. BH103, BM106, and BH105 had the three highest rise rates.

In most cases, at the end of leaching, the cavern roof had reached the top of the salt formation, allowing direct contact between brine and marl (or argillite) layers that compose the overburden of the salt formation. These layers are prone to weathering when in contact with saturated brine. Stoping takes place, and the cavern roof rises through the overburden. This process may be several years or dozens of years long. In Lorraine salt formations, stoping stops when the rising cavern top reaches a competent layer, the Beaumont Dolomite. Operators then lower cavern-brine pressure to trigger collapse. A rigid cylinder of rock (a \"piston\") drops into the cavern, and a crater whose initial edges are vertical is created. Cavern drop is more abrupt when the cavern top is filled partly with air. The contour of the piston is circular, as a circle is the shape such that the ratio between perimeter and area is minimal. In other cases, for instance in Kansas, the cavern rises until the uppermost keystone in the bedrock at shallow depth is breached, permitting loose materials to flow into the cavern through a relatively narrow hole at the bottom of the sink hole, as in an hour glass.\n\nResults of a test well in the Nanafalia Formation near Melvin, Choctaw County, Alabama\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nDavis, M.E.; Sparkes, A.K.; Peacock, B.S.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nTest drilling at Melvin, Choctaw County, Alabama, discloses that the Nanafalia Formation (Paleocene) contains freshwater in sand at a distance of 25 miles downdip from the outcrop area.

The large relative abundance of soil algae at stations in the middle of the watershed likely indicates the cumulative effects on water quality of agricultural nonpoint sources. Farther downstream near the State Highway 3 bridge, and downstream of three major tributary inflows, the increase in abundance of soil algae to a larger-than-expected level might reflect water-quality influences from predominantly urban nonpoint sources in the drainage basins of the three major tributary inflows. Nutrient concentrations do not appear to limit algal production in the upper (non-tidal) reach of Dickinson Bayou; but nutrient concentrations could have been limiting benthicalgal production in the lower (tidal) reach of the bayou during the time of the synoptic survey. If nitrogen is the limiting resource for algal productivity in the tidal reach of Dickinson Bayou, eutrophication of the system could be (at least partially) mitigated if nonpoint-source nutrient loads into the Bayou were reduced.Â\n\nHistorical and Archeological Investigations of Fort Bisland and Lower Bayou Teche, St. Mary Parish, Louisiana\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-06-01\n\nmarsh deposits and sediments originating from the adjacent Lafourche delta complex.

R.; Donnelly, J. P.; Toomey, M.; Sullivan, R.; MacDonald, D.; Evans, R. L.; Ashton, A. D.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nHurricanes pose a considerable threat to coastal communities along the Atlantic seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico. The complex role of ocean and atmospheric dynamics in controlling storm frequency and intensity, and how these relationships could be affected by climate change, remains uncertain. To better predict how storms will impact coastal communities, it is vital to constrain their past behavior, in particular how storm frequency and intensity and the pattern of storm tracks have been influenced by past climate conditions. In an effort to characterize past storm behavior, our work contributes to the growing network of storm records along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts by reconstructing storm-induced deposits in the northern Gulf of Mexico during the Late Holocene. Previous work on the northern Gulf coast has shown considerable centennial-scale variability in the occurrence of intense hurricanes, much like the northern Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea. The timing of active and quiet intervals during the last 1000 years amongst the Gulf Coast records appears to be anti-phased with stormy intervals along the North American east coast. The sparse spatial coverage of the existing intense hurricane reconstructions provides a limited view of the natural variability of intense hurricanes. A new, high resolution reconstruction of storms along the northern Gulf Coast would be beneficial in assembling the picture of the patterns of storminess during the Late Holocene. Our study site, Basin Bayou, is situated on the north side of Choctawhatchee Bay in northwest Florida. From 1851 to 2011, 68 storms have struck the coast within 75 miles of Basin Bayou, of which 10 were Category 3 or greater, making it a prime location to reconstruct intense hurricanes. Basin Bayou openly exchanges water with Choctawhatchee Bay through a narrow channel, which acts as a conduit for propagating storm surges, and potentially coarse-grained bay sediments, into the bayou.

W.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe Orca and Choctaw salt bounded mini-basins, which occur in 1.5 to 2.5 km water depth on the northern Gulf of Mexico slope, are currently under consideration as an IODP scientific drilling location for coarse-grained natural gas hydrate systems. We use a 3D seismic dataset for gas hydrate prospecting that covers parts of eleven lease blocks ( 200 km2) in the Walker Ridge protraction area. The study area includes the southern section of the Orca Basin and a smaller section of the northern Choctaw Basin. We have mapped a discontinuous bottom-simulating reflection (BSR) over nearly 30% of our seismic dataset, which varies significantly in both amplitude and depth throughout the area. The southeastern section of our dataset contains three positive impedance amplitude horizons with possible phase reversals at the BSR. Detailed mapping in the area also reveals at the base of gas hydrate stability, a complicated intercalation of an east-west trending fault system and an amalgamated deepwater depositional system comprising channel levee deposits and turbidite sheet sands. Three industry wells drilled in the southwestern section of our study area indicate that the sedimentary sequence infilling the basins consists of predominantly mud rich units with interbedded turbidite sands, forming a 2 km thick supra-salt sequence of late Miocene to Pleistocene sediments. Two of the industry wells have strong evidence for natural gas hydrate in clay-rich sediment, with moderate resistivity (between 2-10 Î©m) increases above background resistivity in zones that exceed 60 m thick. Additionally, the electromagnetic resistivity curves in these wells separate suggesting that the gas hydrate occurs in high-angle fractures. We will present our seismic dataset, our continuing analysis and selected drill sites in the Orca and Choctaw basins. Furthermore, our analysis in the southeastern section of the study area underscores the importance of interpreting faults when considering phase\n\n77 FR 57020 - Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Carlin Bayou, LA\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-09-17\n\n... lift bridge across Carlin Bayou in Delcambre, Iberia Parish, Louisiana.

Eye irritation, dryness, excessive tearing, visual blurring, diplopia, pain, visual loss, retroorbital discomfort are the symptoms and they can mimic carotid cavernous fistulas. Carotid cavernous fistulas are abnormal communications between the carotid arterial system and the cavernous sinus. The clinical manifestations of GO can mimic the signs of carotid cavernous fistulas. Carotid cavernous fistulas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the GO patients especially who are not responding to the standard treatment and when there is a unilateral or asymmetric eye involvement.

The motivation for this effort was to quantify improvements, or lack thereof, in water quality in the Steele Bayou watershed as a result of implementing large- and small-scale best-management practices aimed at reducing nutrient and sediment concentrations and loads. The results of this study document the hydrologic, water-quality, and sedimentation status of these basins following over two decades of ongoing implementation of conservation practices.Results from this study indicate the two Steele Bayou stations have comparable loads and yields of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended sediment when compared to other agricultural basins in the southeastern and central United States. However, nitrate plus nitrite yields from basins in the Mississippi River alluvial plain, including the Steele Bayou Basin, are generally lower than other agricultural basins in the southeastern and central United States.Seasonal variation in nutrient and sediment loads was observed at both stations and for most constituents. About 50 percent of the total annual nutrient and sediment load was observed during the spring (February through May) and between 25 and 50 percent was observed during late fall and winter (October through January). These seasonal patterns probably reflect a combination of seasonal patterns in precipitation, runoff, streamflow, and in the timing of fertilizer application.Median concentrations of total nitrogen, nitrate plus nitrite, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, and suspended sediment were slightly higher at the upstream station, Steele Bayou near Glen Allan\n\nEvaluation of Girder Cores from the US 90 Bayou Ramos Bridge\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThis technical assistance report documents the investigation conducted by the Louisiana Transportation Research Center (LTRC) of the cored concrete from girders of the US 90 Bayou Ramos Bridge near Morgan City, LA.

Case report A 33-year-old female visited our hospital for severe, right-sided, temporal headache, chemosis, periorbital edema, and proptosis. These signs were associated with congested erythematous nasal mucosa with purulent discharge from the right superior nasal meatus. Contrast enhanced CT showed dilated left superior ophthalmic vein, suggestive of thrombosis, contrast enhancement of the left cavernous sinuses, and dilation of cavernous sinus, indicating cavernous sinus inflammation. The right maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses showed mucosal thickening and retention of purulent material. She was diagnosed with cavernous sinus thrombosis caused by contralateral sphenoid sinusitis. All clinical symptoms and signs improved after endoscopic sphenoidotomy and appropriate medical treatment. Conclusions Sphenoiditis can cause contralateral cavernous sinus thrombosis. Early surgical sphenoidotomy and aggressive medical treatment are the cornerstones of successful management of this life-threatening complication.

Posttraumatic fistulas represent 70% of all carotid-cavernous fistulas and they are mostly high-flow shunts (type A). This type gives characteristic eye symptoms. This paper presents a 44-year old male patient with carotid-cavernous fistula as a result of penetrating head injury. In clinical presentation the patient had exophthalmos, conjunctival chemosis and weakening of vision on the right eye, headache and diplopia. Digital subtracted angiography showed high-flow carotid-cavernous fistula, which was vascularised from the left carotid artery and from vertebrobasilar artery. Endovascular embolization with platinum coils was performed through the transarterial route (endoarterial approach). Check angiogram confirmed that the fistula was closed and that no new communications developed. Embolization of complex carotid-cavernous fistula type A was successfully performed with platinum coils by endovascular approach.\n\nCarotid-cavernous fistula after functional endoscopic sinus surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaraman, Emin; Isildak, Huseyin; Haciyev, Yusuf; Kaytaz, Asim; Enver, Ozgun\n\n2009-03-01\n\nCarotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) are anomalous communications between the carotid arterial system and the venous cavernous sinus. They can arise because of spontaneous or trauma causes. Most caroticocavernous fistulas are of spontaneous origin and unknown etiology. Spontaneous CCF may also be associated with cavernous sinus pathology such as arteriosclerotic changes of the arterial wall, fibromuscular dysplasia, or Ehler-Danlos syndrome. Traumatic CCFs may occur after either blunt or penetrating head trauma. Their clinical presentation is related to their size and to the type of venous drainage, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, such as visual loss, proptosis, bruit, chemosis, cranial nerve impairment, intracranial hemorrhage (rare), and so on. Treatment by endovascular transarterial embolization with electrolytically detachable coils is a very effective method for CCF with good outcomes. Carotid-cavernous fistulas have been rarely reported after craniofacial surgery and are uncommon pathologies in otolaryngology practice. In this study, we report a 40-year-old"
