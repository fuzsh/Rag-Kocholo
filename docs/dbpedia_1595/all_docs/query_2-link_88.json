        "text": "01 of 13\n\nClarence Ray Allen: \"Hoka Hey, it's a good day to die\"\n\nWhile serving life in California's Folsom Prison for the 1974 murder of his son's girlfriend — who'd snitched on a robbery he committed — Clarence Ray Allen solicited hits on eight witnesses against him. A paroled fellow inmate later killed three of them and was arrested while carrying Allen's list of names. Allen was convicted for those added killings and, at age 76, died by lethal injection on Jan. 17, 2006. He was the second-oldest inmate executed by the U.S. in 30 years.\n\nHis last words: \"My last words will be, Hoka Hey, it's a good day to die. Thank you very much; I love you all. Goodbye.\"\n\n02 of 13\n\nWilliam Bonin: \"Think about it seriously\"\n\nDubbed the \"Freeway Killer\" after many of his victims' bodies were discovered along Southern California roadsides in 1979 and 1980, William Bonin was convicted for 14 murders of boys and young men — although he is suspected of the rape and murder of many more. Bonin died on Feb. 23, 1996, at San Quentin State Prison by lethal injection.\n\nHis last words: \"I would suggest that when a person has a thought of doing anything serious against the law, that before they did that, they should go to a quiet place and think about it seriously.\"\n\n03 of 13\n\nGeorge Bernard Harris: \"Somebody needs to kill my trial attorney\"\n\nAfter winning big in a Kansas City, Mo., craps game on March 11, 1989, George Bernard Harris gave $500 to a man in exchange for two machine guns, then enlisted a second man to hold the guns for safekeeping.\n\nThe second man enlisted a third — but when Harris wanted the guns back later that night, the third man couldn't find them, and Harris shot him dead with a revolver. According to the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, he was later picked up for a robbery, then charged and convicted for the murder and executed on Sept. 13, 2000.\n\nHis last words: \"Somebody needs to kill my trial attorney.\"\n\n04 of 13\n\nTed Bundy: \"Give my love to my family and friends\"\n\nThe exact number of rapes, murders and kidnappings carried out by Ted Bundy is unknown. He was convicted for killing two Florida State University sorority sisters in January 1978 and a 12-year-old girl three weeks later, all committed after he'd escaped from jail — twice — in Colorado, where he was facing charges in the 1975 murder of a nurse. Per ABC News, before being executed in Florida's electric chair on Jan. 24, 1989, he confessed to 30 homicides across seven states between 1974 and 1978.\n\nHis last words: \"I'd like you to give my love to my family and friends.\"\n\n05 of 13\n\nAileen Wuornos: \"I'll be back\"\n\nAileen Wuornos was a sex worker along Florida's highways and claimed she only killed in self-defense. But her shooting of several men in 1989 and 1990 — Wuornos was convicted in six of the murders — landed her on the state's death row. Before she died by lethal injection on Oct. 9, 2002, she invoked the films The Terminator (1984) and Independence Day (1996).\n\nHer last words: \"I'd just like to say, I'm sailing with the rock, and I'll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus, June 6th. Like the movie, big mothership and all. I'll be back.\"\n\n06 of 13\n\nJohn Wayne Gacy: '\"Kiss my ass\"\n\nA killer who dressed as Pogo the Clown for kids' parties and charity events around Chicago, John Wayne Gacy was convicted of murdering at least 33 teen boys and young men between 1972 and 1978. All were killed in his suburban Norwood Park ranch house, most of them strangled or asphyxiated, and Gacy buried 26 of the bodies in the crawl space beneath his home. In 1980, he was sentenced to die for 12 of those killings, and he was executed by lethal injection on May 10, 1994.\n\nHis last words: \"Kiss my ass.\"\n\n07 of 13\n\nWestley Allan Dodd: \"Any way sex offenders could be stopped\"\n\nAfter several arrests and court-ordered therapy for child molestation convictions, Westley Allan Dodd pleaded guilty to the 1989 sexual assault and murder in Washington state of two brothers, 11 and 10 years old, and the subsequent abduction and murder of a 4-year-old boy in Oregon. He was executed by hanging on Jan. 5, 1993 — the first legal hanging in the U.S. in 28 years. Uniquely, Dodd refused to appeal his case or sentence and specifically requested that he be executed by hanging.\n\nHis last words: \"I was once asked by somebody, I don't remember who, if there was any way sex offenders could be stopped. I said no. I was wrong.\"\n\n08 of 13\n\nKimberly McCarthy: \"This is not a loss, this is a win\"\n\nPretending she was borrowing sugar, Kimberly McCarthy entered the home of a 71-year-old neighbor in Lancaster, Texas, in 1997. McCarthy then stabbed and killed her neighbor in a robbery to support a crack cocaine addiction. (She was accused of killing two other elderly women in 1998 but never faced trial in those cases.) Her June 26, 2013, death by lethal injection became the 500th execution in modern Texas history.\n\nHer last words: \"This is not a loss, this is a win. You know where I am going. I am going home to be with Jesus. Keep the faith. I love y'all. Thank you, chaplain.\"\n\n09 of 13\n\nJack Jones Jr.: \"I love you like a child\"\n\nIn 1995, Jack Jones Jr. entered a county tax office in Bald Knob, Ark., where Mary Phillips worked, strangled her 11-year-old daughter Lacy, then raped and murdered Phillips, who was 34 at the time. Investigators who arrived to document two homicides were startled when — after the flash of a camera — Lacy opened her eyes, showing she was still alive. Jones was convicted of murder and attempted murder and was executed by lethal injection on April 24, 2017.\n\nHis last words: \"I hope over time you can learn who I really am, and I am not a monster. There was a reason why those things happened that day. I am so sorry, Lacy. Try to understand; I love you like a child.\"\n\n10 of 13\n\nRosendo Rodriguez III: \"I have run the good race\"\n\nRosendo Rodriguez III confessed to killing a 16-year-old girl in 2004, then packing her body in a piece of luggage and dumping it at the city landfill in San Antonio. He was convicted of murder for doing the same to a 29-year-old woman in 2005 and was linked to at least five other sexual assaults before he was executed in Texas by lethal injection on March 27, 2018.\n\nHis last words: \"I have fought the good fight; I have run the good race. Warden, I'm ready to join my father.\"\n\n11 of 13\n\nTimothy McVeigh: \"I am the captain of my soul.\"\n\nOn April 19, 1995, Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh orchestrated the Oklahoma City bombing, which stands as the deadliest domestic terrorist act in U.S. history — according to the FBI. This tragic event resulted in the death of 168 people and 680 others who were injured, as well as the decimation of one-third of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. McVeigh faced indictment on 160 state offenses and 11 federal offenses, ultimately receiving the death penalty.\n\nBefore he was executed by lethal injection in 2001, McVeigh passed on a handwritten copy of William Ernest Henley's poem, \"Invictus,\" to serve as his final statement.\n\nHis last words: \"It matters not how strait the gate/How charged with punishments the scroll/I am the master of my fate/I am the captain of my soul.\"\n\n12 of 13\n\nCarl Panzram: \"I could kill 10 men while you're fooling around!\"\n\nSerial killer Carl Panzram was arrested in 1928 in Baltimore for a burglary and later found guilty of killing three men earlier that month. While serving his 25-year-to-life sentence in prison, the convict confessed to having murdered 21 boys and men (only five could be confirmed at the time) and committing more than a thousand rapes, per San Diego State University. Suspected of killing over 100 men in the U.S., Panzram was executed by hanging in 1930 after slaughtering a prison employee.\n\nHis final words: \"Hurry it up, you Hoosier bastard. I could kill 10 men while you're fooling around.\"\n\n13 of 13\n\nRobert Alton Harris: \"Everybody dances with the Grim Reaper.\"\n\nOn July 5, 1978, Robert Alton Harris — previously imprisoned twice for car theft — and his younger brother, Daniel, abducted and killed 16-year-old boys John Mayeski and Michael Baker, stealing their car to pull off a bank robbery. Harris was arrested less than an hour after the burglary and was later convicted and sentenced to death. In April 1992, he was executed in a gas chamber in San Quentin State Prison.\n\nHis last words: \"You can be a king or a street sweeper, but everyone dances with the Grim Reaper.\""
