        "text": "Healthy cells can only divide a limited number of times during an organism’s lifetime. In contrast, tumor cells are immortal: they proliferate indefinitely and uncontrollably, and this is the defining characteristic of cancer. Researchers from the Telomeres and Telomerase Group at the CNIO (Spanish National Cancer Research Center), led by Maria Blasco, have studied for the first time the possibility of treating lung cancer by targeting the telomeres, the structures that protect the ends of chromosomes and whose condition determines the cell’s ability to divide indefinitely.\n\nThe results, as explained by the researchers in the journal Cell Death & Differentiation, show that, indeed, targeting telomeres “might be an effective therapeutic strategy” against non-small cell lung cancer, which is responsible for much of the mortality in lung cancer patients.\n\nThe work has Sergio Piñeiro as first author, recipient of a postdoctoral contract from the Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC).\n\n“Removing immortality from cancer cells is a therapeutic strategy that has not yet been exploited in the fight against cancer,” says Maria Blasco.\n\nFocus on the tumor microenvironment\n\nLung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. The long-term ineffectiveness of current therapies and late diagnosis mean that only one in five patients survive more than five years. Specifically, non-small cell lung cancer is responsible for 85% of lung cancer-associated deaths.\n\nThe work now published focuses on the so-called tumor microenvironment, which is a set of cells and factors surrounding the tumor that plays a crucial role in the development of cancer and the response to therapies.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the impact of dysfunctional telomeres. Also, they studied the effect of telomerase deficiency on the cellular microenvironment of non-small cell lung tumors, telomerase being the enzyme that repairs telomeres.\n\nTelomerase deficiency\n\nTelomeres are protein structures located at the ends of chromosomes. At each cell division, telomeres shorten until, after a certain number of divisions, the shortening becomes excessive and the cell stops dividing. This happens in healthy cells, but not in most tumor cells.\n\nTelomerase expression is reactivated in 90% of human tumors. Because of the action of telomerase, the telomeres in tumor cells maintain a minimum functional length, which allows them to divide indefinitely.\n\nCNIO researchers studied what happened when they caused a telomerase deficit in the lung tumor microenvironment. They also deliberately damaged their telomeres, using the compound 6-thio-dG.\n\n“It is the first time that the involvement of telomerase and dysfunctional telomeres in the lung tumor microenvironment has been investigated,” explains Sergio Piñeiro, currently at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in La Rioja.\n\nDamaged telomeres hold back the tumor\n\nTelomerase deficiency and dysfunctional telomeres slowed tumor progression. The researchers observed a reduction in tumor implantation and vascularization in the lung, while increasing the vulnerability of tumors to DNA damage and cell death. Tumor cell proliferation and inflammation were also decreased, and the anti-tumor response of the immune system was enhanced. As the authors write in Cell Death & Differentiation, “we address by the first time the implication of TERT [telomerse] and dysfunctional telomeres in the lung tumor microenvironment. Our results demonstrate that targeting telomeres might be an effective therapeutic strategy in non-small cell lung cancer”.\n\nThe study that analyses the impact of genetics among the Spanish population in their response to drugs has just been published by researchers from CNIO (National Cancer Research Centre) in the journal Pharmaceutics. The paper focuses on variants of the 21 genes that play a role in metabolism, transport or are target of the most common drugs.\n\nThis research conducts an in-depth analysis of genetic information from 3006 people, a representative sample of the Spanish population. The results indicate that 98% of our population carries at least one pharmacogenetic gene [a relevant gene in drug interaction] with variants that could affect response to treatments.\n\nPractically the entire population “could benefit from the use of this information to personalise their treatment and, consequently, improve the response to it,” says Anna González Neira, head of the Human Genotyping Unit at CNIO and director of the research. “Treatments could be adjusted to find the best fit for each individual according to their pharmacogenetic genes, so that they are more efficient and safer.”\n\nSpecifically, 50% of the population would benefit from changes in the usual treatments with tricyclic antidepressants, and 10% from adjustments in certain anticoagulants, antitumour, and immunosuppressants, among other drugs. These changes range from finding an alternative drug to prescribing a different dose to the standard one.\n\n“Our study provides valuable reference information to help implement pharmacogenetic diagnosis in Spain,” adds González Neira.\n\nPreventive testing to determine the pharmacogenetic profile\n\nPharmacogenetics seeks to offer patients “optimal treatments and move towards personalised medicine,” says González Neira. “Our ultimate goal is to find out, through a single preventive test, the pharmacogenetic profile of each individual in order to personalise the use of as many drugs as possible.”\n\nAdverse drug reactions are “a serious clinical problem,” write the authors of the paper, including the lead author Rocío Núñez Torres from CNIO.\n\nAdverse drug effects are considered the fifth leading cause of death in Spain. One of the factors that contribute to such reactions is human genetic variability: even if a drug is effective for most of the population – which is why it is approved -, it may not be useful, or could even be harmful for people with a certain genetic profile.\n\nDelays in clinical application\n\nIn recent years, the increasing abundance of genomic and epidemiological data from different populations, stored in databases accessible to the international scientific community, has furthered the field of pharmacogenetics. But the reality is that “the implementation of pharmacogenetic diagnosis is still extremely slow and uneven around the world,” writes Núñez Torres and her fellow authors in Pharmaceutics.\n\nIn order to make it easier for pharmacogenetic knowledge to reach clinical practice, information on the specific genetic variability of each population is essential. For this reason, genomic data were collected from more than 3,000 people (50% men/women) from all over Spain, and the researchers searched for genetic variants of 21 pharmacogenes that affect the response to 64 drugs. It is, say the researchers, the “most complete study [of pharmacogenetics] carried out in the Spanish population to date.\n\nAntidepressants, ibuprofen, simvastatin, tamoxifen and 50 other drugs\n\nThe 64 drugs analysed include some as common as simvastatin -used to lower cholesterol-, tricyclic antidepressants, the antitumour drug tamoxifen and the immunosuppressant tacrolimus.\n\n“Our study shows that patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants are the ones who could benefit most from a pharmacogenetic diagnosis, since about 50% of Spaniards would need to be prescribed an alternative drug or a decrease in the initial dose,” write the authors.\n\nIn addition, “about a third of the population would need a different prescription for antiretroviral therapy, opioids and some antitumour drugs, such as tamoxifen. The family of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, simvastatin, anticoagulant therapy with clopidogrel and the immunosuppressant tacrolimus appear to be altered in ~10-20% of the Spanish population,” they add.\n\nSpanish genetic variability in a database\n\nAll the information obtained has been made available to the scientific community in the Collaborative Spanish Variability Server (CSVS), a project started three years ago, and which already has more than 2,000 genomes from unrelated Spanish subjects.\n\nIn addition, González-Neira adds “Although there are already pharmacogenetic clinical guidelines available to be used in the clinical field, within the Spanish Society of Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics (SEFF) we are working intensively on the development of specific Spanish guidelines that facilitate and accelerate the implementation of pharmacogenetics in our country.”\n\nThe authors are aware, however, that although the study of our genes for the personalisation of treatment provides valuable information, it has to be managed within a clinical context where all the patient’s clinical information (age, sex, other diseases) is available, and possible interactions with other drugs can also be taken into account in the case of polymedicated patients.\n\nResearchers at the CNIO (Spanish National Cancer Research Center) have discovered that one of the causes for the rare tumor pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma is the interruption of a very specific step in the production of some proteins, called succinylation. This is a relatively poorly studied mechanism that may be involved in more diseases than previously thought, according to the new results, which are published in the journal Cancer Communications.\n\nThe researchers find that faults in the DLST protein prevent succinylation, and that DLST is therefore “a promising therapeutic target for treating diseases linked to dysregulated succinylation,” they write in the paper.\n\nA mutation causing rare tumor pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma\n\nProteins are the building blocks of the organism, the structural component of tissues and organs. They are also the nanomachines that carry out all biological functions. There are tens of thousands of different human proteins, and each one has its tasks: transporting oxygen in the blood, contracting muscles, reading DNA… even manufacturing other proteins. When cancer develops, it always implies that there are faulty proteins.\n\nAlberto Cascón and Sara Mellid, from the CNIO Hereditary Endocrine Cancer Group, wanted to understand what was going wrong in five specific patients with pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma. The incidence of these rare tumors, actually considered a single disease, is three to eight cases per million inhabitants each year.\n\nOver the last decade, this CNIO group has discovered five of the 22 genes implicated in the disease so far.\n\nIn the case of the five patients whose analysis has led to the new result the researchers knew the causative mutation, because they discovered it themselves in 2019. But they did not know what was going wrong in the cells because of that mutation.\n\nMalfunctions in cell metabolism, pseudohypoxia and cancer\n\nProteins are made according to instructions written in the genes; mutations amount to erroneous instructions. The mutations studied by Cascón and Mellid affect the DLST protein, involved in cell metabolism. It is known that when there are faults in some proteins related to cell metabolism, pseudohypoxia can occur, a situation in which tumor cells increase glycolysis as a way of obtaining energy, even in the presence of oxygen, which is to their advantage.\n\nCNIO researchers discovered that the mutated DLST protein effectively generates this cancer-friendly pseudohypoxia by preventing other proteins from being manufactured correctly. Specifically, it prevents other proteins from being succinylated.\n\nSuccinylation: embellishing proteins\n\nSuccinylation is one of the last steps in the manufacture of some proteins. Genetic information dictates which pieces make up the protein and in what order they should be arranged; but after the pieces are assembled, like beads on a necklace, they often need to be further completed with specific molecules, which are added like brooches to the necklace. These embellishments change the function of the proteins.\n\nIn succinylation, the chemical group succinyl is added to the protein. This mechanism is still poorly studied, “but it seems that it will be very important for protein function and is beginning to be studied extensively, not only in cancer, but also in other diseases,” say Cascón and Mellid.\n\nLack of succinylation leads to cancer\n\n“We see that when the DLST protein has the mutations that we have found in PPGL patients, succinylation does not occur, and that causes many key proteins for cell function to be hyposuccinylated,” they explain.\n\n“Proteins not being properly succinylated is what we propose as one of the mechanisms that could give rise to the tumor. Hyposuccinylated proteins in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are involved in several processes, and when they do not function correctly, pseudohypoxia is triggered, which favors tumor cells,” say Sara Mellid and Alberto Cascón.\n\nRichard Vile is researching oncolytic viruses, which are viruses that specifically attack tumour cells. He wants to use them as a decoy to activate our immune system, and thus contribute to immunotherapy against cancer. One strategy is for oncolytic viruses to infect the tumour so that our defence cells, seeking to eliminate the viruses, end up eliminating the tumour: the equivalent of disguising tumours as viruses.\n\nFor Vile, Professor of Paediatric Immunology and Oncology at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, it is important for ideas like this to be tested quickly in clinical trials. He has led several trials, specifically against a very aggressive type of paediatric brain tumour that is currently without treatment. “It’s very frustrating that it takes so long to bring good scientific results to patients in clinical trials, although I am not arguingfor a relaxation of the regulatory process at all,” he says.\n\nVile recently visited CNIO at the invitation of Luis Álvarez Vallina, head of the Clinical Research in Cancer Immunotherapy Unit H12O-CNIO.\n\nWhen were oncolytic viruses discovered?\n\nThe concept of oncolytic viruses emerged in the mid-twentieth century. But long before that, there were cases of patients with Burkitt lymphoma where the tumour disappeared after infections with chickenpox, flu, or other viruses. The first prototypes of oncolytic viruses were developed to replicate selectively in the tumour, and it was initially thought that, since they attacked tumour cells rather than healthy ones, they would provide an antitumour strategy. But as soon as clinical trials began, it was observed that the viruses did not replicate that much in tumour cells, and their antitumour effect was not very powerful.\n\nYour group demonstrated that the important thing is the response of the patient’s immune system.\n\nThat’s right, we demonstrated in animal models that the antitumour effect of oncolytic viruses disappears if we experimentally eliminate the animal’s immune system. This suggests that the oncolytic effect comes from the reaction of the immune system to the infection, rather than from the infection itself. It is a key difference.\n\nSince then my research has focused more on the virus as an alarm system, alerting the immune system, rather than as a direct weapon against the tumour.\n\nHow does the alarm system work?\n\nNormally our immune system responds quickly and effectively to viral infections. So if we get the virus to infect and destroy a certain number of cancer cells, it may alert the immune system to the presence of more infected tumour cells, both locally and in other tumour sites, when there is metastasis.\n\nSo harnessing the antivirus response, and make it an anti-tumour response, that I think is the challenge now. It’s a strategy that offers great potential. Using the virus as a burglar alarm, rather than as the weapon itself.\n\nIs this a controversial idea in the research community?\n\nWhen the field exploded, in the late 1990s, people wanted to believe that the virus was strong enough to be the single agent that would work, and was somewhat unpopular to talk about the immune system because it was seen as the enemy of the virus, it stopped the virus from replicating.\n\nWith the data we have now we it’s fair to say that infection stimulates a defence response, and that this response is what fights cancer. But some researchers still think that the important thing is the replication of the virus.\n\nHow can the antiviral response be turned into an antitumour response?\n\nWhen we introduce a virus into a patient’s tumour we see a very powerful antiviral response, because the immune system has great power and multiple tools to detect and fight viral infections, which is what it has evolved for. Our approach is to try to direct this antiviral response towards the tumour.\n\nSpecifically, we have modified viruses to express tumour antigens [tumour proteins], so that when the virus infects the patient, a double response is stimulated, against the virus and against the tumour, because the virus also expresses antigens from the latter. So the antiviral response becomes by definition also an antitumour response.\n\nYou are also trying to combine current immunotherapy, specifically CAR-T cells, with oncolytic viruses. Why?\n\nYes, we can also use that strong antiviral response as an adjuvant to CAR-T cells [patient’s own T cells modified in the laboratory to get them to detect and kill tumour cells]. One of the reasons T cells have not worked well in solid tumours is because the tumour has the ability to suppress the immune system, so the T cells reach the tumour but cannot work well. By introducing a virus into the tumour, it’s like lighting a fire in it: CAR-T cells can better detect the tumour and act against it.\n\nHow do you see this area in a decade’s time?\n\nI truly belileve that in 10 years’ time viruses will be part of effective anti-tumour therapies. Theses viruses will be engineered so that they will be carried to tumours by CAR-T cells, and once inside the tumour, they will produce molecules that will activate those same CAR-T cells. When we combine both strategies, oncolytic viruses and CAR-T, we will have a really powerful resource against cancer.\n\nWhat phase of this research are you at now?\n\nClinical trials. We have administered some viruses to patients, we are now starting to infuse CAR-T cells, and the next step,we hope, will be a test combining virus with CAR-T cells.\n\nWhat tumours are you working on?\n\nWe are quite focused on a particularly difficult type of paediatric brain tumour. It is very poorly immunogenic tumour. One of the advantages of working on it is that, if our idea works with this tumour, what we learn can be applied to many other non-immunogenic tumours.\n\nYou are in contact with patients. What is it like seeing announcements made about advances in cancer research that will take quite a while to reach clinical practice?\n\nEvery day we see announcements of ‘the next big thing’ in the media, followed by the statement that such advancements will take five to ten years to reach patients. But some of the people who are reading about them have children who will die long before that. There is a huge disconnect between the media enthusiasm when reporting on research findings… and the reality of the patients. Communicating an advance in the scientific literature is not the same as talking about something ready to be tested in the clinic.\n\nOur cells know how to solve the problem that tortures us when we pack a suitcase: how to put in what obviously does not fit, or will only fit if folded and organized to perfection. Cells fold and organize to perfection their DNA, which in our species, when stretched, extends to two meters.\n\nInvestigating this meticulous folding is of interest because, as has been discovered in recent years, errors in the three-dimensional structure of the genome are directly related to cancer.\n\nThe latest results on the study of the genome’s 3D structure, and how it relates to genome stability, will be discussed by twenty international leaders in this area at the CNIO-CaixaResearch Frontiers Meeting ‘Genome Organisation and Stability’, to be held in collaboration with La Caixa on May 22 and 23.\n\nTwo meters of DNA packaged in each cell\n\nAll cells have in their nucleus several DNA molecules, the chromosomes, which contain the genes – the instructions for building and running an organism. If these molecules were simply compressed into a ball, the resulting tangle would be larger than the cell. So how exactly does DNA fold up to fit? How exactly does DNA fit into the nucleus of cells?\n\nThis is a booming area of research. It is now known that the 3D shape DNA takes on determines how genes are expressed -because distant areas of the molecule come into contact.\n\nAlso, understanding DNA folding will help identify the most fragile and unstable areas of the genome, those most susceptible to rearrangements of the genetic material. Genome instability leads to failures in the cell –such as an abnormal number of chromosomes– directly linked to cancer.\n\n“Extraordinary attention in recent years”\n\n“The three-dimensional folding [of DNA] in the cell nucleus determines how cells read, interpret and maintain the information in the genome. Its study has attracted extraordinary attention in the last few years,” say the conference organizers, CNIO researchers Felipe Cortés, Ana Losada and Óscar Fernández-Capetillo,as well as Andre Nussenzweig, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n“The most illustrative example for this is perhaps the regulation of gene expression, which is now unconceivable to understand without taking into account how the genome is structurally organised”, they say. “The connections between 3D genome organisation and the processes that signal and repair DNA damage are, however, only now starting to emerge, and proving fundamental to understand the endogenous sources of DNA breaks and chromosomal rearrangement events that drive cancer onset and progression. In this meeting we aim at bringing together world-leading researchers in both fields, 3D genome organisation and the DNA-damage response, in order to provide an ideal setting to bridge the gap between these two fundamental aspects of genome dynamics”.\n\nMásMore info:\n\nProgram: CNIO-CaixaResearch Frontiers Meeting: Genome Organization and Stability #CFM_Genome – CNIO\n\nClaudio Joazeiro (Brazil, 1968) studies how cells control the quality of their proteins. He wants to find out how cells know when proteins are aberrant or damaged, and how they decide on ways to either correct or eliminate them. “Protein quality control is critical to ensure cellular fitness”, he explains. “Defective protein quality control is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases”.\n\nJoazeiro is Full Professor at Heidelberg University (Germany), while keeping a fractional appointment at the Scripps Research in San Diego (U.S). He has recently visited the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), invited by the head of CNIO Genomic Instability Group, Oscar Fernández Capetillo. Here he talks about a key cellular machinery involved in protein quality control, the Ribosome-Associated Quality Control (RQC) complex. Joazeiro’s research on mutations affecting this complex are leading to insights onto the molecular basis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to potential therapeutic targets.\n\nWhy is protein quality control such an important process in our cells?\n\nAberrant proteins are continuously produced as a consequence of, for example, gene mutations, errors during gene expression or chemical damage. Therefore, cells have a variety of protein quality control mechanisms that detect the production of aberrant proteins and prevent their accumulation. Defects in protein quality control are associated with various diseases and are a hallmark of neurodegeneration3.\n\nYou discovered Ribosome-Associated Quality Control (RQC), one of those protein quality control mechanisms.\n\nProtein surveillance must occur with great sensitivity and precision, to detect as many forms of protein aberration as possible. RQC is indeed a process that checks the quality of newly made proteins. Ribosomes are the cellular machineries that make new proteins, but for different reasons this process can go wrong, and end up producing proteins that are incomplete, or have other forms of aberration. So, cells need checkpoint processes to make sure that every step in protein synthesis is going on as it should. We have identified a number of factors that carry out this surveillance for an aberrant situation versus a normal situation.\n\nIs this a mechanism to help the cell clean itself, or just to find out if something is wrong?\n\nIt’s both. It’s a process that will check if something is wrong, and if that is the case, it will eliminate these abnormal proteins. There are many processes involved in checking the quality of every type of macromolecule in the cell, whether they are proteins, mRNA, lipids or DNA, for example. Cells are constantly monitoring the quality of its constituents and looking for ways to either correct the problem, or eliminate the aberrations.\n\nWhat do cells do with the waste, once they eliminate aberrant proteins? Do they ‘recycle’?\n\nYes. Cells don’t waste anything, if a protein has to be degraded or eliminated, its components (amino acids and short peptides) are recycled.\n\nWhat were you looking for when you discovered the Ribosome-Associated Quality Control?\n\nWe found a new mutation that caused an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)-like phenotype in mice: the animals lose motor neurons and develop paralysis. We managed to identify the gene whose mutation causes the problem, but then we wanted to know what it does when it is not mutated. To make a long story short, we found that the protein encoded by this gene is involved in ribosome quality control.\n\nWhat is the significance of these findings?\n\nFirst, there is this clear disease relevance: we know that mutations in the pathway cause neurodegeneration. In addition to these mice that I mentioned already, we have found mutations in other components of the RQC system that also cause neurodegeneration in mice, as well as neuromuscular disease in humans. Biologically it is also a very important cellular mechanism. We know that because it has been conserved through evolution: all cells, from bacteria to humans, use ribosome quality control.\n\nWhat is the state of the art of your investigation in this field?\n\nThe field for the past decade has been very mechanistic, we have identified the factors and the processes that are responsible for this quality control, but now we are integrating this knowledge into biology and disease. We are investigating the role of RQC in neurodegeneration and in cancer, and we want to know what is happening in normal biology, for example in aging or under conditions of nutrient starvation.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the recent realization that aberrant proteins trigger a complex alarm response in the cell?\n\nWhat we knew until recently was that RQC eliminates the aberrant proteins, and also the mRNA that was being translated to generate these aberrant proteins. Now we know a lot more. We know that RQC also activates a number of stress-signaling responses, it promotes an overall inhibition of translation in the cell, and it can promote apoptosis [programmed cell death]. It can also promote innate immunity, and all kinds of alarm systems used by the cell to signal that something is going wrong.\n\nHow do you see your field in the future?\n\nI think we will be able to modulate the RQC mechanism therapeutically. The ribosome is the cell machinery responsible for making new proteins. It reads the blueprint for a certain protein on a messenger molecule – known as messenger RNA (mRNA) – and then converts this information into new proteins. When this process fails, the ribosome gets stalled on the mRNA and protein synthesis is brought to a halt. I am a believer that if we are able to modulate or to decrease ribosome stalling, we may be able to decrease the rate of aging, for example, and we may find ways to approach cancer therapeutics and certainly neurodegeneration.\n\nThe Academy of Television and Audiovisual Arts and Sciences delivered this week the VII Concha García Campoy Science Journalism Awards, in a ceremony held at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO).\n\nAt the ceremony conducted by the journalist Sandra Golpe, the video of Margarita Salas‘ speech at the first edition of these awards, in 2015, was screened, in which this scientist, a pioneer in molecular biology on a global scale, expressed that “as Concha García Campoy would have wanted, science must be disseminated in the different media“.\n\nFor María Blasco, CNIO Director and member of the jury, it was “a pleasure to present these science communication and journalism awards at a center like CNIO, where we are committed to communication“, and in particular in an auditorium named after Margarita Salas, her mentor.\n\nThe President of the Television Academy, María Casado, highlighted that these awards, which remember the journalist Concha García Campoy, “value the committed work of radio, television and press colleagues who, through science communication, make what is important interesting”.\n\nJosep Corbella, science and health journalist at La Vanguardia, received the Lifetime Achievement Award, which was handed by Ignacio Melero, Professor of Immunology at the University of Navarra. “I started in radio with Concha García Campoy, who had the vision and courage to defend a weekly science news program in a prime time slot,” said Corbella.\n\nLaura Chaparro, winner in the Written Press category for her report Los microorganismos son los amos, published in Muy Interesante, collected the award from the president of FAPE, Miguel Ángel Noceda. “The pandemic achieved something never been seen before: science news opened the news for months,” said Chaparro. “This highlighted the importance of good specialized journalism.”\n\nEva Caballero, who directs the outreach program La mecánica del caracol on Radio Euskadi, was presented by Luis del Olmo, honorary president of the Radio Academy.
