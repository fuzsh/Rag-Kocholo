        "text": "#103 = Vol. 34, No. 3 = November 2007\n\nYolanda Molina-Gavilán, AndreaBell, Miguel Ángel Fernández-Delgado, M. Elizabeth Ginway, Luis Pestarini, and Juan Carlos Toledano Redondo\n\nChronology of Latin American Science Fiction, 1775-2005\n\nMany readers and critics possessing only a superficial acquaintance with Latin American science fiction erroneously assume the works to be mere variations of the more prestigious genres, magical realism and the literary fantastic. (Oftentimes, this misperception is fueled by publishers, who are unconvinced of the market appeal of a book labeled “science fiction.”) Any foray into the speculative that comes from Latin America runs the risk of being classified as either magical realism or the fantastic, as if those genres were somehow endemic and unavoidable. The term “sf” has now become internationally accepted, however, and is widely used, sometimes to differentiate subgenres within the overall rubric of the fantastic and at other, less fortunate times, to label those works as “sub-literature.” Although we use the designation “sf” here, we must point out that sf is often intertwined with other speculative forms in Latin America (most commonly horror and the fantastic). Historically, in the absence of sustained attention from the literary establishment, Latin American writers have been free to disregard the more stringent genre boundaries that shaped early sf production in the US. Therefore, this and any chronology of Latin American sf will of necessity include texts not always or exclusively identifiable as science fiction, especially to readers accustomed to works from parts of the world with more established sf traditions and stronger ties to the critical and market sectors.\n\nThe objective of this Chronology is to continue to inventory this type of cultural production in Latin America and to present it here in English for the first time. An earlier version was published in November 2000 in Chasqui, a journal devoted to Latin American literary criticism. That first attempt was written in Spanish and included coverage of regional works published between 1775-1999.1 While we have expanded this version of the Chronology into the twenty-first century, we are nonetheless aware that it may still be incomplete and welcome additional titles for a future edition.\n\nThe selection criteria do not necessarily imply aesthetic or other value judgments. Generally, this compilation does not include forms of the sf genre such as poetry, film scripts, films, or comic books. The only exceptions are indicated in the text. The Chronology is mostly organized by country and year of publication, and the term “Latin American” is meant to indicate the authors’ nationalities as well as the original language of the fictional works—that is, either Spanish or Portuguese. If an author is classified under “Argentina,” for example, in most cases this designates his or her country of origin. In some instances, authors are listed under the countries where they spent most of their lives or where their works were published, rather than under the countries where they were born. Such is the case of Alfredo Cardona Peña, who was born in Costa Rica in 1917 but whose works are listed under Mexico, where he lived and worked until his death in 1995; such is also the case of René Rebetez, a Colombian who lived and published in Mexico for many years. If the author published the work under a pseudonym, his or her real name is indicated in square brackets the first time the pseudonym appears—for example, S. Fragoso Lima [pseud. of Horacio Quiroga]—and thereafter is omitted. Novels and short-story collections are indicated by italics; the titles of short stories are given in quotation marks. Some short stories have been listed individually in order to highlight their importance; whenever possible, we have included the titles of the collections, anthologies, or magazines in which they were first published. A collection of short stories by either single or multiple authors is indicated in parentheses as “(anth).”\n\nTitles of magazines or fanzines from each country are listed following the fictional works. They are organized chronologically according to the years in which those magazines were in circulation (e.g., “1998-99”). In cases where the magazine in question is still being published, this is indicated by a dash following the date it first appeared (e.g., “1998- ”). The number of issues is shown in parentheses whenever possible. Some of the listed magazines are not sf magazines proper but have published special issues on the genre. In these cases, this information appears in parentheses next to the name of the magazine. Meriting its own subsection within the Chronology is the Spanish-language magazine Nueva dimensión, edited in Spain from 1968 to 1982, which published the work of many Latin American sf authors throughout its 148 issues.2\n\nThe section entitled “Essays” includes critical works about Latin American sf written in any language, as well as academic articles written in Spanish or Portuguese that deal with sf in general. The bibliographical information about primary texts has been kept to a minimum for reasons of space; the critical works, however, are listed with complete bibliographical information. For the benefit of those who do not read Spanish or Portuguese, we have included a section that lists sf works available in English translation.\n\nFinally, the sections entitled “The Caribbean,” “Mexico,” “Central America,” “Colombia,” “Venezuela,” “Bolivia,” “Peru,” “Brazil,” “Argentina,” “Chile,” and “Uruguay” provide us with a convenient format for organizing the bibliographical entries. Each section will introduce leading sf authors and provide some historical context for the sf production in the country specified. It is thus our hope that the data and commentary offered in this Chronology will be useful both to literary critics and historians and to the general public.\n\nThe Caribbean\n\nScience fiction published in the countries forming the Hispanic Caribbean (Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic) has historically experienced a strong US influence and presence. And yet we must note that the genre has developed in very different ways in each of these three countries. While the Dominican Republic can only offer one notable work—Josefina de la Cruz’s Una casa en el espacio [A House in Space, 1986]—and Puerto Rico has only two—James Stevens-Arce’s Soulsaver (1998) and Rafael Acevedo’s Exquisito cadáver [Exquisite Corpse, 2001]—Cuba has excelled in sf production, mostly since Castro’s 1959 Revolution. Such disparity is difficult to explain. We might speculate that the Dominican Republic has been too economically disadvantaged to develop what we may call a “scientific literary taste” among its reading public, or that Puerto Rico has been so culturally dominated by the US that its writers were exposed only to American sf, while Spanish and Latin American models were practically unavailable. But these are mere hypotheses. In any case, the quality of sf produced in Puerto Rico has recently been internationally recognized, after Stevens-Arce won the Spanish UPC award and Acevedo won an honorable mention in the Cuban Casa de las Américas award competition. (The UPC award for short stories and short novels has been hosted by the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Spain since 1991; it is the only sf competition that considers submissions written in French, English, Catalan, and Spanish. The Casa de las Américas award, for its part, is one of the most prestigious literary awards in Spanish, promoted by the official Cuban Casa de las Americas since 1960 for the best Latin American novel, play, essay, poetry, and short-story collection.) Nothing similar can be said about their Dominican counterpart, De la Cruz, whose work was so poorly received by the public that she took it upon herself to publish an essay “explaining” the plot of her novel as well as the reasons for having published it in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, if we take a look at Cuba’s recent history, it becomes much easier to understand why this small island of some eleven million people has become one of the most important producers of sf in Spanish. Although there are some pre-1959 works listed as sf in this Chronology, it is not until the 1960s, with the publication of works by Ángel Arango, Miguel Collazo, and Arnaldo Correa that there is a clear effort by Cuban publishers to encourage the genre. The genre did not, however, reach its pinnacle until the 1980s, more specifically after 1979, when more titles of high quality by local authors appeared on Cuban shelves. Two major reasons are usually given to explain that development. The first is the abundant publication of sf works from the Communist block in the 1970s, which fed a new generation of Cuban writers who had grown up under Castro’s regime. The second reason is the establishment of a category for sf within the prestigious national David award for new Cuban writers. The award included the publication of the winner’s work by Editorial Unión, a national publisher, ensuring the distribution of thousands of copies all over the country. The David award for sf continued uninterrupted for eleven years and prompted the appearance of a strong sf movement with annual national conferences and literary workshops. It also fostered a new group of writers that included Daína Chaviano, F. Mond (Félix Mondéjar), Agustín de Rojas, and Yoss (José Miguel Sánchez). Although the 1990s were a difficult period for Cuba in general, sf has remained strong and today both authors and fans keep the genre alive. In addition, some authors are publishing and garnering acclaim overseas—for example, Yoss and Vladimir Hernández in Spain and Daína Chaviano in Spain, Mexico, and the US. With Cuba still strong and Puerto Rico emerging as a contender, sf in the Caribbean looks healthier today than it has ever been.\n\nMexico\n\nMexican science fiction has a long, though rather uneven, two-hundred-year history that can be divided into five distinct periods. The first, the precursor era, spans more than a century, beginning in 1775 with a philosophical short story by Manuel Antonio de Rivas, a Franciscan friar who imagined a trip to the Moon as a prologue to his astronomical almanac. Almost 70 years later, Sebastián Camacho Zulueta (under the pseudonym Fósforos Cerillos) offered his vision of Mexico in the year 1970 as a model nation whose main method of transport was balloons. In 1849 Gerónimo del Castillo Lenard also imagined his countrymen in the twentieth century transported by balloons and ruled by a monarch. From 1861 to 1871, writers such as Juan Nepomuceno Adorno, Nicolás Pizarro, and Ignacio M. Altamirano sympathized with a liberal party bent on preventing religion from hindering progress; these writers produced utopian works in which religion and technological advances joined forces to ensure material progress. Pedro Castera celebrated the new popularity of Comptian positivism in “Un viaje celeste” [A Celestial Trip, 1872] and his best novel, Querens (1890), deals with the effects of mesmerism and hypnosis on human will and our ability to reason.\n\nThe second period, from 1900 to 1939, is characterized by a clear interest in improving the literary quality of the genre. To do this, Mexican writers found it helpful to follow foreign models such as Verne, Flammarion, and Wells. The most acclaimed writer of this period is Amado Nervo, who contributed to the genre with poems such as “El gran viaje” [The Great Voyage, 1917] and such excellent short stories as “La última guerra” [The Last War, c. 1900], where he speculates about animal evolution into the fifty-sixth century. Other noteworthy writers of the period are Carlos Toro, who imagined a global disaster brought about by Halley’s Comet in “En los días del cometa” [In the Days of the Comet, c. 1910]; Martín Luis Guzmán, who presents an intelligent machine able to predict the consequences of World War I in “Cómo acabó la guerra en 1917” [How the War Ended in 1917, 1917]; and Julio Torri, with two stories also published in 1917, “La conquista de la Luna” [The Conquest of the Moon] and “Era un país pobre” [It Was a Poor Country]. The novel Eugenia: Esbozo novelesco de costumbres futuras [Eugenia: A Fictional Outline of Future Mores, 1919], by Eduardo Urzaiz Rodríguez, is an optimistic forerunner of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932); and Félix F. Palavicini’s ¡Castigo! Novela mexicana de 1945 [Punishment! Mexican Novel of 1945, 1926] is the first Mexican dystopia.\n\nThe next period, from 1940 to 1964, is one of consolidation that begins with the work of H.G. Wells’s most successful Mexican follower, Guillermo Zárraga, who wrote under the pseudonym Diego Cañedo. His first novel, El réferi cuenta nueve [The Referee Counts to Nine, 1942], is set in a parallel universe where the Nazis have invaded Mexico. He followed that first work with Palamás, Echevete y yo, o el lago asfaltado [Palamás, Echevete, and I, or The Paved Lake, 1945], a collection of time-travel stories set in pre-Hispanic and Colonial Mexico, and La noche anuncia el día [The Night Heralds the Day, 1947], about a machine able to read the minds of professional politicians. Another important writer of the period is Rafael Bernal, whose novel Su nombre era muerte [Its Name was Death, 1947] is about a scientist who deciphers the language of mosquitoes and urges them to rebel against their own repressive regime. Mexican versions of US pulp magazines such as Famous Fantastic Mysteries, Startling Stories, Fantastic Story Magazine, and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction experienced a boom in the decade from 1948 to 1958. Although for the most part they published translations, these magazines also managed to include a few stories by Mexican writers. Meanwhile, mainstream authors such as Juan José Arreola (“Baby H.P.,” 1952) and Carlos Fuentes (“El que inventó la pólvora” [He who Invented Gunpowder, 1954]) began publishing a few sf stories in mainstream magazines. For the most part, however, Mexican sf fans could nurture their interest by reading translations of classic novels from the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union; these were published by Spanish, Argentinian, and Mexican publishing houses such as Diana and Novaro, which launched a series of paperback novels in translation from 1955 to 1975. In 1964, two expatriates living in Mexico, Alejandro Jodorowsky and René Rebetez, published two issues of Crononauta, introducing surrealist psychedelia into the genre to produce what they labeled “panic science fiction.”\n\nThe fourth period, from 1964 to 1983, belongs to the first generation of Mexican authors to become known for writing science fiction. Among their works are Juan Aroca Sanz’s El último reducto [The Last Refuge, 1968]; Agustín Cortés Gaviño’s Hacia el infinito [Towards Infinity, 1968] and ¿De dónde ...? [From Where?, 1969]; Carlos Olvera’s Mejicanos en el espacio [Mexicans in Space, 1968]; Jorge Tenorio B.’s Sin ventaja [Without Advantage, 1971]; and Jesús Pavlo Tenorio’s La píldora maravillosa [The Wonder Pill, c. 1970]. Mainstream writers who also contributed to the genre include Edmundo Domínguez Aragonés with Argón 18 inicia [Argon 18, Engage, 1971]; Tomás Mojarro with Trasterra, 1973; and Marcela del Río with Proceso a Faubritten [Faubritten’s Trial, 1976]. We should also mention Alfredo Cardona Peña, a Costa Rican author living in Mexico, who published his fantasy works in Los ojos del cíclope [The Cyclop’s Eyes, 1980] and Los mejores cuentos de magia, misterio y horror [The Best Magic, Mystery, and Horror Stories, 1990].\n\nThe current generation of authors, who have managed to furnish Mexican science fiction with its own language and themes, got its start in 1984, when the journal Ciencia y Desarrollo launched the first National Science Fiction Short Story Contest. In 1992 the Mexican Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy (AMCYF) was formed and its first president, Federico Schaffler, brought together the works of 42 authors in a three-volume anthology entitled Más allá de lo imaginado [Beyond What’s Imagined, 1991-94]. The Association and the national contest, together with a workshop led by Schaffler known as Terra Ignota and the publication of the magazine Umbrales (1992-2000), have all helped to encourage contemporary sf writers. Other key promoters, historians, critics, and well-known authors who have helped Mexican sf achieve national and international recognition include Gabriel Trujillo Muñoz, José Luis Zárate Herrera, and Gerardo Horacio Porcayo Villalobos.\n\nThe following authors and works are also representative of contemporary Mexican sf: Ernesto de la Peña, Las máquinas espirituales [Spiritual Machines, 1991]; Mauricio-José Schwarz, Más allá no hay nada [There is Nothing Beyond, 1996]; Bernardo Fernández, ¡¡Bzzzzzzt!! Ciudad interfase [Bzzzzzzt!! Interface City,1998]; Gerardo Sifuentes, Perro de luz [Light Dog, 1999] and Los pilotos infernales [Infernal Pilots, 2002]; José Luis Zárate, Hyperia (1999); and Ramón López Castro, Soldados de la incertidumbre [Soldiers of Uncertainty, 2000]. What makes these stories representative is their high literary quality, their thematic originality, and their genuine Mexican voice.\n\nAlso of note is an anthology that pays homage to Philip K. Dick—a highly admired author in Mexico—entitled El hombre en las dos puertas [The Man by the Two Doors, 2002]. Other novels worth noting include Arturo César Rojas’s space opera Xxyëröddny, donde el gran sueño se enraíza [Xxyëröddny,Where the Great Dream is Rooted, 1984]; Gerardo Horacio Porcayo’s pioneering cyberpunk work La primera calle de la soledad [The First Street of Solitude, 1993]; and María Luisa Erreguerena’s Precursores [Precursors, 1995], which tells of women’s social and intellectual progress on another planet, offering a point of comparison with the plight of women on Earth. The constant deterioration of Mexico’s future is a common theme that runs through several key works of this period and this idea is reflected in such suggestively titled works as Cristóbal nonato [Christopher Unborn, 1987] by Carlos Fuentes; La destrucción de todas las cosas [The Destruction of All Things, 1992] by Hugo Hiriart; Que Dios se apiade de todos nosotros [May God Have Mercy on Us All, 1993] by Ricardo Guzmán Wolffer; ¿En quién piensas cuando haces el amor? [Who Are You Thinking of When You Make Love?, 1995] by Homero Aridjis; Máscara Azteca y el Doctor Niebla (después del golpe) [Aztec Mask and Doctor Fog (After the Coup), 1996] by Paco Ignacio Taibo II; El dedo de oro [The Golden Finger, 1996] by Guillermo Sheridan; and Sequía: México, 2004 [Drought: Mexico, 2004, 1997] by Francisco Martín Moreno. Visiones Periféricas [Peripheral Visions, 2001], a highly-praised anthology edited by Miguel Ángel Fernández-Delgado, serves as a good introduction to Mexican sf.\n\nCentral America\n\nScience fiction in Central America first emerged in the work of two Modernist authors, Rubén Darío and Máximo Soto Hall. Nicaraguan-born Rubén Darío, in his commentary on H.G. Wells’s sf works, held that it was Wells’s aspiration to connect the “miracle of science” to the “religious miracle,” just as Darío himself tried to do with his short story “Verónica,” his closest approach to the genre. This story, written in 1896, was later rewritten and published in 1911 under the title “La extraña muerte de Fray Pedro” [The Strange Death of Fray Pedro] and deals with the consequences of a skeptical friar’s X-ray experiments on a consecrated Host. Guatemala’s Máximo Soto Hall, in his 1899 novel El problema [The Problem], imagined a near future when Central America would be taken over by a great power that was then digging an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua. In 1920, Costa Rican Carlos Gagini continued this anti-imperialist tradition with La caída deláguila [The Eagle’s Fall], a story featuring an alliance among the nations of Central America against the US. Another Guatemalan, the Modernist Rafael Arévalo Martínez, followed suit in 1925 with La oficina de paz de Orolandia [Goldland’s Peace Office], about the offices of the Panamerican Union, a satire of Washington’s Peace Office denouncing the exploitation of his country’s natural resources. He later wrote a couple of utopian works, El mundo de los Maharachías [The World of the Maharachías] in 1938 and Viaje a Ipanda [Trip to Ipanda] in 1939. Yet his most genuine contribution to the genre is his 1951 short story “El gigante y el auto” [The Giant and the Automobile] which clearly pays homage to Voltaire’s “Micromégas” (1752).\n\nDuring the postwar period, Panamanian author Rogelio Sinán combined magical realism and cubist techniques in his 1954 “La boina roja” [The Red Beret]. This story was included in Seymour Menton’s 1964 anthology El cuento hispanoamericano [The Latin American Short Story] and is considered one of the best sf stories from the region.\n\nThe most prominent and prolific Central American author writing during the so-called “Latin American Boom” is Salvadoran Álvaro Menéndez Leal, better known by his pseudonym, Álvaro Menén Desleal. His literary influences include Borges, Kafka, Bradbury, Asimov, Poe, Wells, and Arreola, and he paid homage to those writers in the following short-story collections: Cuentos breves y maravillosos [Brief and Wonderful Stories, 1963], La ilustre familia androide [The Illustrious Android Family, 1972], Hacer el amor en el refugio atómico [Making Love in the Atomic Bomb Shelter, 1972], and Tribulaciones de un americano que estudió demografía [Tribulations of an American who Studied Demographics, n.d].\n\nFrom the 1970s on, there is little information available about the works and authors of this region, except for their sporadic appearances in Latin American sf anthologies. Thus, in Primera antología de la ciencia-ficción latinoamericana [The First Anthology of Latin American Science Fiction, 1970], we find Costa Rican Alberto Cañas with “El planeta de los perros” [The Planet of the Dogs], and Hondurans Oscar Acosta with “La búsqueda” [The Search] and “El regresivo” [The Regressive] and Orlando Enríquez with “Nacimiento último” [Last Birth]. Costa Rican Louis Doudray’s story “Aquí” [Here] is included in the Spanish fanzine Zikkurath (1979).\n\nThe last decades have produced only a few titles and authors, among them the novel Juan Chapín en el siglo XXX [Juan Chapín in the Thirtieth Century, 1986] by Guatemalan Francisco Javier Aguirre Batres, and the collection C.R. 2040 (1996) edited by Costa Rican Roberto Sasso. In 2003, Alberto Ortiz, also from Costa Rica, published in Mexico Azor y Luna [Goshawk and the Moon] a novel of historical extrapolation set in a post-apocalyptic Caribbean Basin that combines science fiction and magical realism. Before that, in 1995, Laura P. Quijano Vincenzi became the first Costa Rican author to publish an sf novel. Her Una sombra en el hielo [A Shadow in the Ice] is a mystery set in 2195 about an abandoned underground polar research station and an enigmatic figure who disappeared along with it. Finally, Iván Molina Jiménez is the only other Costa Rican author who has managed to publish two recent short-story anthologies, La miel de los mudos y otros cuentos ticos de ciencia ficción [The Honey of the Mutes and Other Costa Rican Science Fiction Stories, 2003] and El alivio de las nubes y más cuentos ticos de ciencia ficción [The Relief of the Clouds and More Costa Rican Science Fiction Stories, 2005].\n\nColombia\n\nColombia’s literature is among the richest in the Spanish language, having given us authors of the stature of José Eustasio Rivera, Jorge Isaacs, and Gabriel García Márquez, the grand master of magical realism. Yet science fiction represents only a brief chapter in its history. Studies of the genre in Colombia are very rare, perhaps the most comprehensive of them being Ricardo Burgos López’s “La narrativa de ciencia ficción en Colombia” (2000) which is our principal source of information for this introduction (see the full entry below in “Studies in English on Latin American sf and studies on sf in Spanish and Portuguese,” 429).\n\nColombian sf’s predecessors appeared toward the end of the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth: “Futura” (1896), a short poem by the distinguished writer José Asunción Silva, and “Bogotá en el año 2000” [Bogota in the Year 2000, 1905], an exercise in social extrapolation by Soledad Acosta de Samper. Over two decades would pass before another sf work would come to light: Una triste aventura de catorce sabios [A Sorrowful Tale of Fourteen Wise Men, 1928], an episodic social satire by José Félix Fuenmayor.\n\nThe 1930s were years of political stability and industrialization in Colombia and, in that context, two new sf novels appeared. Barranquilla 2132, by José Antonio Osorio Lizarazo, used the familiar trope of a man falling asleep only to awaken two centuries later in a future that mirrors his own social reality. In the realm of pulp fiction and extraordinary voyages, we have Viajes interplanetarios en zepelines que tendrán lugar en el año 2009 [Interplanetary Zeppelin Voyages That Will Take Place in the Year 2009, 1936] by Manuel F. Sliger, of interest now only to literary historians.\n\nThe 1940s and 1950s marked the start of political violence and guerrilla warfare in Colombia, and most authors abandoned the emphasis on regionalism that prevailed in earlier times and adopted a more universal and experimental narrative style. Sf’s most prolific period began in the 1960s with authors such as René Rebetez and Antonio Mora Vélez, who openly identified their work as science fiction. For much of his life, Rebetez (1933-99) lived outside his native country, primarily in Mexico. There he published a large part of his oeuvre, beginning with Los ojos de la clepsidra [The Clepsydra’s Eyes, 1964], a volume containing many sf stories and poems. Those of his sf stories that appeared in La nueva prehistoria y otros cuentos [The New Prehistory and Other Stories, 1967], Ellos lo llaman amanecer [They Call it Dawn, 1996], and Cuentos de amor, terror y otros misterios [Stories of Love, Terror, and other Mysteries, 1998] are well known for incorporating elements of the genre’s traditional iconography into a mythic, latino-flavored environment. Rebetez’s early literary criticism was published in Ciencia ficción: la cuarta dimensión de la literatura [Science Fiction: Literature’s Fourth Dimension, 1966].\n\nMora Vélez, a poet and short-story writer, remains sf’s chief proponent in Colombia. He has published three sf anthologies—Glitza (1979), El juicio de los dioses [The Judgment of the Gods, 1982], and Lorna es una mujer [Lorna is a Woman, 1986]—in which he develops the genre’s main themes to reflect a certain candor and trust in scientific progress. His two recent collections of poetry are Los caminantes del cielo [Travelers of the Heavens, 1999] and El fuego de los dioses [The Fire of the Gods, 2001].\n\nScience fiction has not yet managed to establish itself in Colombia as a genre in its own right, however. Unfortunately, few Colombian sf texts really pass critical muster and the country’s top writers have, for a variety of reasons, tended to avoid the genre.\n\nVenezuela\n\nThe earliest example of Venezuelan science fiction, a short story by Julio Garmendia titled “La realidad circundante” [The Reality Around Us, 1927], proposed a device that would enable the user to adapt effortlessly to any circumstance, be it physical or psychological. Nothing could better proclaim the arrival in Venezuela of the new genre of science fiction. Almost a decade later, in his novel La galera de Tiberio [Tiberius’s Galley, 1938], Enrique Bernardo Núñez described his nation’s future by means of an ironic and critical timeline of the years to come.\n\nWe have no other record of Venezuelan sf until the end of the 1960s, when the start of the space race between the US and the Soviet Union triggered in Venezuela—as it had in other Latin American countries—a prolific increase in the number of sf authors. Most of them engaged the genre only briefly, examples being the anthology Quorum (1967) by David Alizo and the short stories “Conspiración en Neo-Ucronía” [Conspiracy in New Uchronia, 1967] by Francisco de Venanzi, “Racine desde el aeropuerto” [Racine from the Airport, 1970] by José Balza, and “Jinetes de la luz” [Riders of the Light, 1970] by Humberto Mata. De Venanzi’s and Balza’s stories criticize their present society from the distance of a technologically perfect country, while Mata’s story takes a nostalgic look at contemporary human achievements that will be scorned or ignored in the future.\n\nLuis Britto García, better known as a university professor and writer of mainstream literature, made his debut with the anthology Rajatabla [To the Letter, 1970], which contains many sf stories representative of his sharp sense of humor and his irony; it was awarded the prestigious Casa de las Americas prize, an honor also bestowed upon his later novel Abrapalabra [Hocus Wordus, 1979]. His most recent incursions into the genre appear in the anthology, La orgía imaginaria [The Imaginary Orgy, 1983].\n\nIn 1979, Julio E. Miranda published the first anthology of Venezuelan sf as part of the “Libros de Hoy” collection sponsored by the newspaper El Diario de Caracas. Works by the aforementioned authors appear in this volume, as do those of younger writers such as Pascual Estrada, Ednodio Quintero, José Gregorio Bello Porras, and Armando José Sequera. We have been able to find only sporadic and incomplete information about Venezuelan sf texts published since then. This neglect, however, was tempered in part by the birth of Ubik, the sf club of the Universidad Simón Bolívar, on 24 May 1984. Ubik was responsible for the publication two years later of the magazine Cygnus, followed in 1988 by La Gaceta de Ubik [The Ubik Gazette] and, in 1993-94, Necronomicón. Before changing its name in 1997 to the Venezuelan Science Fiction and Fantasy Association, Ubik organized sf film festivals, literary contests and workshops, conferences, and expos. Currently, the club not only continues with these activities but also edits three online publications: Ubikverso, Necronomicón, and Desde el Lado Obscuro [From the Dark Side].\n\nBolivia\n\nThe two earliest examples of speculative fiction in Bolivia were written by women: Adela Zamudio’s “El viaje” [The Trip, c. 1920] is included in her anthology Cuentos breves [Short Stories, 1975] and “El occiso” [The Slain Man, 1937] is a collection of three stories by María Virginia Estenssoro. The next two experiments with the genre come from the 1940s, 2487 (a.k.a. Utopía 2487, n.d.) by Werner Pless and Víctima de los siglos [Victim of the Centuries, n.d.] by Álvaro Montenegro. As noted in an article on Bolivian science fiction appearing at <elforastero.blogalia.com>, it is significant that both writers felt they had to use a similar strategy to place their characters in a highly technological world in the distant future.3 In 2487, the protagonist sleeps for about 500 years and in Víctima de los siglos his counterpart is frozen by gas after an atomic bomb explosion and wakes up 5000 years later. In both cases, the travelers’ efforts at understanding the future serve as vehicles for reflecting on the present.\n\nIt is difficult even to find exact titles and publication dates for the few other sf stories written before the 1990s. There are references to authors such as Harry Marcus, Edmundo Carmargo, Roberto Leiton, and Marcela Gutiérrez, whose works are being rescued in part by the magazine Correveydile, but otherwise they are very difficult to find. One author who excels in the genre is Hugo Murillo Bénich, winner of national awards for his anthology Paraíso [Paradise, 1990] and his 1995 short story “El Supraespacio” [Superspace]. There are a few short stories cited in Paraíso that were published during the 1990s, but more concerted efforts on the part of both publishers and writers had to wait until the beginning of the twenty-first century. One of those efforts was a contest sponsored by the United Nations that resulted in an anthology of sf stories by young writers, published by Santillana in 2001. Among them, we may note Greg Mercado (“El Koan-Testador” [Tester-Koan]) and Nayra Corzón (“Cognitivo disidente” [Cognitive Dissenter]) as young writers to watch.4 Fortunately, it seems that the new century may yet produce Bolivian sf works of greater quality and rooted in a more autochthonous cultural form, if we are to judge by the novel El viaje [The Trip, 2001] by Rodrigo Antezana, which touches on cyberpunk without being sf proper. Another similar novel is Edmundo Paz Soldán’s El delirio de Turing [Turing’s Delirium, 2003]. This ambitious novel has been described by Solange Iriarte as “a perfect combination of politics, suspense, science fiction and social realism.”5 Alison Spedding’s De cuando en cuando Saturnina [From Time to Time Saturnina, 2004], however, fits the genre squarely. In it, Spedding, an English anthropologist who has lived in Bolivia since 1989, imagines her adoptive country in the year 2086 having been taken over by an indigenous revolution led by the Aymara Indian majority. As a linguistic innovation, the novel mixes Spanish, Spanglish, and Aymara. Published in the same year, Gary Daher’s El huésped [The Guest, 2004] tells an Orwellian story of a man checking into a hotel where reality is controlled by a computer net. Today the Internet is helping writers to get their work published; even novel-length projects such as Fernando Aracena’s Latinoamérica 2025 may find a readership online (at <http://members.tripod.com/~Aracena/index-2.html>). Let us hope that the trend continues and more Bolivian writers start using the genre to comment on their reality while stimulating readers’ imaginations.\n\nPeru\n\nThe earliest examples of science fiction written in Peru are two short stories by Clemente Palma published in the first decade of the twentieth century. “La última rubia” [The Last Blonde, 1904] places an alchemist in the year 3000, and “El día trágico” [The Tragic Day, 1910] plays on people’s fears of Halley’s Comet. After Palma, it is not until the 1950s that two more Peruvian writers, Eugenio Alarco, an academic, and Héctor Velarde, a humorist, look to the genre for inspiration. Alarco’s La magia de los mundos [The Magic of the Worlds, 1952] depicts a society where involuntary organ donation is a matter of routine; it is considered by some to be a classic of the genre in Peru. Some critics have appreciated the literary influence of Homer, Dante, and Cervantes on the novel’s poetic style, while others consider its gory content to be ahead of its time. It was published in Buenos Aires in 1952 and has a sequel, Los mortales [The Mortals, 1966]. Velarde’s contribution to the genre is a series of humorous essays—“La perra en el satélite” [The Bitch in the Satellite, 1958]—that have the space race and the atomic age as background.\n\nJust as in the rest of Latin America, Peruvian science fiction gained considerable strength during the 1960s and 1970s, with two significant figures emerging at this time, José B. Adolph and Juan Rivera Saavedra. Ironically, although Adolph is considered the primary sf author associated with Peru, he was born in Germany and only became a Peruvian citizen in 1974. His work has been translated into several languages and included in anthologies in the US, Europe, and Latin America. A good example of Adolph’s style and a classic of Peruvian science fiction is the short story “El falsificador” [The Falsifier, 1972] in which Latin American history and myth are cleverly juxtaposed. Most of Adolph’s oeuvre uses the conventions of the genre, although he himself prefers to use the term “speculative fiction.” Rivera Saavedra, on the other hand, preferred the more widely used term “science fiction” and indeed included it in the title of his short-story anthology, “Cuentos sociales de ciencia ficción” [Social Science Fiction Stories, 1976], which focuses on what it means to be human. Saavedra uses the genre as a weapon to denounce social problems of the time, the worst being, according to him, our own loss of humanity. Another significant work of the 1970s is José Manuel Estremadoyro’s hilarious and original space opera Glasskan, el planeta maravilloso [Glasskan, the Marvelous Planet, 1971] and its sequel “Los homos y la Tierra” [Men and Earth, 1971]. The first novel recounts a trip to Glasskan, a utopian planet where human beings go to be trained in the art of achieving perfection, while the second describes how those men return to Earth to bring peace and prosperity but find no one there who deserves these gifts.\n\nUnfortunately, the growth of Latin American science fiction during the 1960s and 1970s to which Adolph and others contributed in Peru does not seem to have lasted very long. In a recent article—posted at <espanol.geocities. com>—sf author Daniel Salvo refers to the current state of science fiction in Peru, from the reader’s point of view, as “desolate,” singling out Spanish publishers such as Minotauro, Gigamesh, and Bibliópolis as culprits or at least accomplices in this matter. Peruvian readers, according to Salvo, must resign themselves to cheap second-hand copies of sf works, since powerful publishers such as the aforementioned ones offer new books at inflated prices or have stopped making them available altogether. At the same time, Peruvian sf authors do not have access to publishing houses in their own country and must seek to publish their work abroad. Among those who managed to get their work into print in the 1990s are then-fourteen-year-old Giancarlo Stagnaro, with Hiperespacios [Hyperspaces, 1990]; Carlos Bancayán Llontop with Las formas [The Forms, 1997], a collection of four of his short stories; and Enrique Prochazka with his first short-story collection, Un único desierto [A Single Desert, 1997], whose language is reminiscent of Borges’s.\n\nAgain, the Internet is doing much to alleviate this state of affairs by offering an outlet to newer writers such as Rubén Mesías Cornejo, José Donayre Hoefken, José de Piérola, Yelinna Pulliti Carrasco, and Daniel Salvo, among others. And it is perhaps a good omen that both José B. Adolph and Juan Rivera Saavedra published new works in 2003—the former a novel, Un ejército de locos [An Army ofMadmen], and the latter a short-story collection, Oprimidos y exprimidos [Oppressed and Squeezed].\n\nBrazil\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, Brazilian authors begin writing tales of imaginary societies and voyages into the future in the mode of Verne and Flammarion. These descriptive works, which have little real action and mostly passive protagonists, deal with political reform through the depiction of future events or societies, as in Joaquim Felício dos Santos’s Páginas da História do Brasil [Pages from Brazil’s History, 1868-72] and Emílio Zaluar’s novel O Doutor Benignus [Dr. Benignus, 1875]. Beginning in the early part of the twentieth century, works of this sort address more controversial topics, such as social and agrarian reform, eugenics, and the social roles of women. Utopian novels of this type written by Godofredo Emerson Barnsley (Brasil no Ano 2000 [Brazil in the Year 2000, 1909]), Rodolfo Teófilo (O Reino de Kiato [The Kingdom of Kiato, 1922]), and Adalzira Bittencourt (Sua excelência, a Presidente no ano 2500 [Her Excellency, the President in the Year 2500, 1929]) portray Brazil as a world power that has made reforms in the areas of health, urbanization, and political organization. By modernizing the Brazilian myth of grandeza (greatness based on the country’s size, natural resources, and potential political and economic advances), these works reflect a generally optimistic attitude toward science and technology and its role in Brazilian society.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Afonso Schmidt continued the utopian current in his 1934 novel Zanzalá, while other Brazilian sf authors began writing futuristic short stories criticizing contemporary mores, adventure tales of lost worlds, or stories of the uncanny and absurd. Berilo Neves’s A costela de Adão [Adam’s Rib, 1930] and Gomes Netto’s Novelas Fantásticas [Fantastic Novellas, 1934] focus on the battle of the sexes, bemoaning incipient feminism and the ills of modern society. Among the “lost world” adventure novels set in the remote hinterlands of Brazil are Menotti del Picchia’s A filha do Inca [The Daughter of the Inca, 1930] and Kalum (1936), as well asJerônimo Monteiro’s O irmão do diabo [The Brother of the Devil, 1937], all of which recall works by Haggard, Burroughs, and Conan Doyle. In 1947, Monteiro wrote his first sf novel, Três meses no século 81 [Three Months in the 81st Century], while the master of the literary fantastic, Murilo Rubião, began to publish tales of the uncanny, first in newspapers and then in an anthology titled O ex-mágico [The Ex-Magician, 1947]\n\nThe late 1950s and early 1960s ushered in the first works of modern sf published in Brazil. Known as the GRD Generation, after Gumercindo Rocha Dorea—one of the few Brazilian publishers of the genre during this period—these authors demonstrated originality in their reworking of typical sf motifs such as space travel, alien contact, robots, and nuclear war, by filtering them through the perspective of Brazilian culture. Lighthearted works from this period make reference to Rio’s carnaval and street hustlers (malandros), as in “Missão T-935” [Mission T-935, 1963] by Wilmar Guido Sassi and “Ukk” (1965) by Levy Meneses, or to affectionate robots, as in “O menino e o robô” [The Boy and the Robot, 1961] by Rubens Teixeira Scavone, “Zinga, o robô” (1963) by André Carneiro, and “O Carioca” (1960) by Dinah Silveira de Queiroz. More somber works by these authors, along with the novel Fuga para parte alguma [Flight to Nowhere, 1961] and Os visitantes do espaço [Visitors from Outerspace, 1963] by Jerônimo Monteiro, portray the threat of nuclear war and the fear of non-humanoid aliens, evoking a sense of powerlessness and a dread of neo-colonialist exploitation. Tales of space travel resulting in death or alienation, such as Fausto Cunha’s “Regresso” and “O dia que já passou” [Return, and The Day that Already Passed, 1960], illustrate the fear that Brazil might lose its sense of compassion or cultural identity by assimilating technology and foreign cultural values. It could be said that these works anticipated the actual policies of modernization and development initiated by the Brazilian military beginning in 1964.\n\nBrazilian science fiction of the late 1960s and the 1970s can be divided into two categories: narratives of the fantastic and dystopian novels. At this point, almost all of the typical motifs of science fiction disappear, except for the uncanny events of fantastic literature and the clockwork worlds of imaginary technocratic regimes. Fantastic tales by José J. Veiga (A máquina extraviada [The Misplaced Machine, 1968] and Sombras de Reis Barbudos [Shadows of the Bearded Kings, 1972]) and by Murilo Rubião (O pirotécnico Zacharias [Zacharias, The Pyrotechnician, 1972]), include motifs such as unfathomable machines, unexplained appearances of animals in urban environments, unending bureaucratic procedures, and Kafkaesque interrogations. In the 1970s, several mainstream authors turned to dystopian fiction to avoid censorship by the regime, disguising their critiques of its policies of fast-paced economic development in their futuristic tales. As allegorical representations of Brazil under military rule, these novels contain clear allusions to the regime’s use of censorship, media control, torture, imprisonment, and disappearances, tactics of the post-1968 crackdown by military hardliners. The dystopian novels of the period are characterized by a nostalgia for the past, especially in the idealized portrayal of nature or women as repositories of authentic Brazilian identity, as seen in works such as Fazenda Modelo [Model Farm, 1974) by Chico Buarque, O funcionário Ruam [Ruam the State Worker, 1975] by Mauro Chaves, O fruto do vosso ventre [The Fruit of Thy Womb, 1976] by Herberto Sales, Asilo nas torres [Asylum in the Towers, 1977] by Ruth Bueno, and Um dia vamos rir disso tudo [Someday We Will Laugh about All This, 1976] by Maria Alice Barroso. Recurrent themes include governmental regulation of reproduction and sexual behavior, policies of modernization, the destruction of natural environments, and control of the media and the minds of citizens. In the dystopian novels Umbra [Shadow, 1977)] by Plínio Cabral and Não verás país nenhum [And Still the Earth, 1981] by Ignácio de Loyola Brandão, environmental degradation goes hand in hand with eroding personal freedoms as Brazil faces the ecological and political consequences of military rule.\n\nCoinciding with the end of the dictatorship in 1985, a new generation of writers emerges and begins to write in a wide variety of sf subgenres. In hard science fiction, Jorge Luiz Calife’s Horizonte de Eventos [Event Horizon, 1986] and Roberto Schima’s “Os fantasmas de Vênus” [The Ghosts of Venus, 1993] use outer space exploration and settlement to criticize the political and environmental devastation caused by the dictatorship and its policies of economic development. Other hard sf stories such as Fábio Fernandes’s “Color Me Black” (1998) and Carlos Orsi Martinho’s “Pressão fatal” [Fatal Pressure, 2000] raise as yet unresolved issues of race and gender within Brazilian society, which persist despite technological advances in the future. Highlighting verbal play and sensory overload made possible by computers, Brazil’s cyberpunk introduces elements of racial politics, sexuality, violence, and poverty to comment on social and political changes taking place in Brazil’s urban culture. Brazilian cyberpunk novels such as Silicone XXI (1988) by Alfredo Sirkis, Santa Clara Poltergeist (1990) by Fausto Fawcett, and Piritas siderais [Outerspace Pyrites, 1993] by Guilherme Kujawski use urban settings instead of cyberspace, stressing international conspiracies against Brazil. Robots and computers emerge as vehicles to criticize class, race, and gender prejudice in stories such as “Pela valorização da vida” [In Favor of Life, 1988] by Ivan Carlos Regina, “O consertador” [The Repairman, 1989] by Henrique Flory, “As crianças não devem chorar” [Children Shouldn’t Cry, 1990] by José dos Santos Fernandes, and O demônio do computador [The Devil in the Computer, 1997] by Marcia Kuptsas. Cyborgs tend to reflect the Brazilian incorporation of technology into the Brazilian body politic in “A pedra que canta” [The Stone that Sang, 1990] by Henrique Flory and in the novella “Julgamentos” [Judgments, 1993] by Cid Fernandez. Aliens are portrayed in a variety of ways, reflecting divergent attitudes towards globalization. In the story “O espelho relâmpago no oco do ciclone” [The Mirror-Lightning in the Eye of the Cyclone, 1989] by Braulio Tavares, the invaders represent foreign consumer culture disrupting the rhythms of Brazilian life. Aliens can also be seen as Brazil’s potential allies, uniting political, religious, mystical, and folk cultures in a mix of cultural hybridity as in narratives such as “Amigos” [Friends, 1989] by Henrique Flory, “A vitória dos minúsculos” [The Victory of the Miniscule, 1997] by Roberto de Sousa Causo, “Portas Induzidas” [Induced Doors, 1999] by Anna Creusa Zacharias, and “Caidocéu” [It Came from Above, 1985] by Marien Calixte. Alternate histories and parallel universes are subgenres that show the lasting impact of colonialism, reflecting Brazil’s struggle with modernization and self-discovery. In many of the alternate histories of Gerson Lodi-Ribeiro, such as “A ética da traição” [The Ethics of Treason, 1992], as well as Max Mallman’s parallel-universe novel, Mundo Bizarro [Bizarre World, 1996], we are reminded of how Brazilian elites, having held on to power for too long, have failed to sacrifice privilege for greater social justice.\n\nDuring this period, science fiction written by women becomes more common. While Finisia Fideli’s two stories “Exercícios de silêncio” [Exercises of Silence, 1983] and “Quando precisa ser homem” [When you Gotta Be a Man, 1993], as well as Marcia Kupstas’s O demônio do computador [The Devil in the Computer, 1997], use male narrators or characters to subvert or question male hegemony in the genre, Martha Argel’s “Vidinha caseira” [Home Life, 2000] and Carla Cristina Pereira’s “Longa viagem para casa” [The Long Voyage Home, 2000] use the female voice to parody or reverse the conventional gender roles of mother and housewife in Brazil. More recently, Michelle Klautau’s A Terra do Hy Brasil [The Land of Hy Brazil, 2005] and Helena Gomes’s O arqueiro e a feiticeira [The Archer and the Sorceress, 2003] have created new hybrid fantasy genres, portraying complex female characters and situations based on medieval themes taken from more conventional fantasy stories. Recent currents in sf and fantasy also include traditional heroic sword-and-sorcery novels such as Orlando Paes’s Angus (2003), Luiz Roberto Mee’s O prisioneiro da sombra [Prisoner of the Shadow, 2003], and Arthur Bastos and Álvaro Pereira’s Armanon (2005), while Roberto de Sousa Causo’s more anthropological A sombra dos homens [The Shadow of Men, 2004] is set in the Amazon and involves an encounter between a Viking and an Amerindian. A postmodern mixture of the horror genre, science fiction, time travel, and fantasy is being explored as a way of capturing readership in Brazil, and recent multi-authored anthologies exemplify this trend, such as the historical survey of sf and horror, Páginas da sombra: Contos fantásticos brasileiros [Pages from the Shadow: Brazilian Tales of the Fantastic, 2003] edited by Braulio Tavares, and an anthology of time-travel police stories, Intempol (2000), edited by Octavio Aragão. Individual works such as Carlos Orsi Martinho’s “O Mistério da Sala Quatro” [The Mystery of Room Four, 2004] and Aragão’s “Hóspedes” [Guests, 2004] also combine sf motifs with elements of horror.\n\nAlthough contemporary sf in Brazil expresses a global consciousness, it also generally attempts to retain its national character. At the same time, the recent “Manifesto Antibrasilite” [Anti-Brazilitis Manifesto, at <www. antibrasilite.xpg.com.br>] blasts literary nationalism as reductive and limiting, demonstrating that the debate about the future of science fiction written in Brazil is far from over.6\n\nArgentina\n\nArgentina has a wide-ranging and rich history of fantastic literature, particularly of science fiction. The first example we can claim for the genre, “Delirio” [Delirium], was published anonymously just before Argentina’s Declaration of Independence in 1816. This short story, an exercise in social and urban criticism following the dicta of the French Revolution, is set in 1880 in Buenos Aires and its main character is Tremebundo, a kind of superman who makes all sorts of improvements in the city.\n\nMany sf works were written in the second half of the nineteenth century, partly because of the political stability that had been achieved after decades of unrest and partly due to the creative impulse reigning in Buenos Aires society at that time. Progressive liberalism, European Romanticism, “new sciences” such as spiritualism and mesmerism, and the theory of evolution all contributed to the production of sf works during this period. The most prominent sf writer of the time was Eduardo Ladislao Holmberg, with works such as Viaje maravilloso del señor Nic-Nac [The Marvelous Voyage of Mr. Nic-Nac, 1875] and “Horacio Kalibang o los autómatas” [Horacio Kalibang or the Automatons, 1879], a work that predicts the advent of robots. Also worth mentioning from that same period is Eduardo de Escurra’s Buenos Aires en el siglo XXX [Buenos Aires in the 30th century, 1891] a work that reflects positivist thinking as it relates to technological development.\n\nDuring the first decades of the twentieth century, highly respected Argentinian authors experimented with the genre, producing works of superior literary quality; these include Leopoldo Lugones’s Las fuerzas extrañas [Strange Forces, 1906] and Ricardo Rojas’s La psiquina [The Psychine, 1917). There were also some popular anarchist and socialist-utopian works published at this time, and La novela fantástica,the first magazine in Spanish entirely dedicated to science fiction, was published in Buenos Aires in 1937.\n\nLa invención de Morel [The Invention of Morel] by Adolfo Bioy Casares was published in 1940; this is a key novel in Argentinian literature and one of the most influential sf novels written in Spanish. This novel—which Borges is said to have called perfect—explores two key topics in science fiction: the search for immortality and the nature of reality. Bioy Casares, winner of the Cervantes Award (the Nobel Prize of Spanish letters), turned to science fiction several times, although critics did not acknowledge his affiliation with the genre for quite some time. Jorge Luis Borges’s work, although much closer to the fantastic, also touches the realm of science fiction in stories such as “Las ruinas circulares” [The Circular Ruins, 1964] and “La otra muerte” [The Other Death, 1949].\n\nDuring the 1950s, science fiction came into its own as a genre, especially after the magazine Más allá [Beyond] was launched and a publishing house, Minotauro, issued handsome editions of modern sf classics. It was also at this time (1957) that the comic El Eternauta became available. This comic, with scripts by H.G. Oesterheld and drawings by Francisco Solano López, helped popularize sf motifs.\n\nDuring the 1960s, sf works began appearing more frequently in anthologies, in short-story collections, and as novels. The first important study of the genre in Spanish, El sentido de la ciencia ficción [The Meaning of Science Fiction], appeared in 1966. In it, Pablo Capanna used his philosopher’s skills to examine sf’s mythological and religious roots. Later, the same author would write studies about Cordwainer Smith, Philip K. Dick, J.G. Ballard, and J.R.R. Tolkien, among others.\n\nScience fiction in Argentina was strengthened during the 1970s by the publication of specialized collections and several books by Argentinian authors. Especially noteworthy are the short-story collections by celebrated author Angélica Gorodischer, Bajo las jubeas en flor [Under the Flowering Jubeas, 1973] and Casta luna electrónica [Chaste Electric Moon, 1977], with their picaresque, colloquial, and epic tones. Gorodischer’s most praised book, Kalpa Imperial [Imperial Kalpa, 1983], portrays the growth of an empire in language that is both precise and fluid.\n\nAfter a bloody dictatorship and decades of political instability, the sf genre began to flourish with the return of democratic governments in 1983. The point of departure for this new period was the launching of the magazine El Péndulo edited by Marcial Souto, a key proponent of sf during this time. El Péndulo, in the words of Swedish critic Sam J. Lundwall, was “undoubtedly the best science fiction magazine in content, presentation and layout ever published anywhere” (“Adventures in the Pulp Jungle,” Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction 34 [Autumn 1985]: 12). Numerous other publications, both professional and amateur, also appeared in connection with the magazine. Between 1983 and 1989 more Argentinian sf works were published than in the whole of the previous period. Among the most noteworthy authors of these years are the two-time winner of the Spanish UPC Award, Carlos Gardini, with Primera línea [First Line, 1983] and Mi cerebro animal [My Animal Brain, 1983]; Marcelo Cohen, highly regarded in academic circles, with Insomnio [Insomnia, 1986]; and Sergio Gaut vel Hartman, one of the main promoters of the genre, with Cuerpos descartables [Disposable Bodies, 1986]. Two other periodicals that are still active began during this same period: Cuásar, edited by Luis Pestarini, and Axxón, edited by Eduardo Carletti. The former started in 1984 and is the longest-running Spanish-language magazine dedicated to the genre, and the latter is an electronic publication, a pioneer in its field that began its distribution via diskette in 1989 and now appears on a very popular web site.\n\nDuring the 1990s, a downturn in the economy brought a considerable reduction in the publication of sf works. In 1991, ConSur I, the first Latin American Science Fiction Convention, was held in Buenos Aires. A few noteworthy novels appeared, but only sporadically, and many of the authors whose names had appeared frequently a decade earlier either abandoned the genre or remained silent. Unsurprisingly, pessimistic visions dominated this period, in works such as Anatomía humana [Human Anatomy, 1993] and Cruz diablo [Vade Retro, 1997] by Eduardo Blaustein.\n\nAfter Argentina’s social crisis and financial default of 2001-02, the early twenty-first century shows signs of a new vitality, with new works by emerging authors such as Alejandro Alonso’s La ruta a Trascendencia [Route to Transcendence, 2004] and Postales desde Oniris [Postcards from Oniris, 2004]. Also worth noting is the launch of Nautilus, edited by Carlos Abrahan, the first publication in Latin America dedicated exclusively to sf criticism.\n\nChile\n\nFuturistic fiction was probably introduced to Chilean readers during the colonial era through works such as Jean-Sébastien Mercier’s utopian time-travel fantasy, L’An 2440 [In the Year 2440, 1771]. In 1877, Francisco Miralles published Chile’s first full-length speculative fiction novel, Desde Júpiter: Curioso viaje de un santiaguino magnetizado [From Jupiter: The Curious Voyage of a Magnetized Man from Santiago], a positivist critique of Chilean society written at a time of popular fascination with the paranormal and, in progressive circles, a belief in human perfectibility through science and technology. One might assume that Miralles’s novel spawned followers, yet to date scholars have found nothing published between 1877 and 1913.\n\nUp until the late 1950s, most Chilean sf authors paid little attention to scientific plausibility, mixing the fantastic with technological innovations to create a convenient platform from which to examine serious social issues. Some notable exceptions include Alberto Edwards (writing as Miguel de Fuenzalida) and Ernesto Silva Román, with his short story collections El dueño de los astros [The Owner of the Stars, 1929] and El holandés volador [The Flying Dutchman, 1948]. They wrote for rival magazines and penned thrilling stories full of technological gadgetry and action-adventure heroics in the style of the US pulps.\n\nThe appearance in 1959 of Hugo Correa’s seminal novels, Los altísimos [The Superior Ones] and Alguien mora en el viento [Someone Dwells Within the Wind], was a turning point in Chilean sf and is widely considered to mark the first flourishing of the genre in Spanish America. The excitement of the space race, combined with the expansion of the Chilean publishing industry and the availability of sf in Spanish—both translations and original works were published in classic magazines such as Argentina’s Más Allá and Spain’s Nueva dimensión—resulted in more works appearing between 1959 and 1973 than in the entire preceding eighty years. Writers were now less isolated from each other and from their readers, and they shared a sense of purpose in developing and promoting this new genre in Chile. The first sf fan club was formed in the 1970s and around this time Julio Bravo Eichkoff launched two short-lived fanzines, Sagitario (1972) and Aleph (1973). In addition to Hugo Correa, the most important sf writers from this period are Elena Aldunate, with her 1967 anthology El señor de las mariposas [The Lord of the Butterflies]and Antonio Montero with Los superhomos [Supermen, 1963]. Although Chile’s publishing industry suffered during that country’s military dictatorship (1973-89) and the economic hardships of the 1980s, sf managed to survive with an average of two new or reissued works published every year between 1974 and 1986.\n\nA new generation has been sustaining Chilean sf since the late 1980s. Fandom coalesced around Sochif (Sociedad Chilena de Fantasía y Ciencia Ficción) in the 1980s and Ficcionautas Asociados in the 1990s and these groups hosted several public sf events. Moisés Hassón, a much-published sf historian, brought out thirteen issues of the fanzine Nádir between 1986 and 1994. Fobos, another noteworthy fanzine edited by Luis Saavedra, holds Chile’s record for longevity, with 23 print and electronic issues published between 1998 and 2004; the entire run can be found online at <www.fanzine-fobos.cjb.net>. Currently, Chile’s leading e-zine is Tau Zero (<www.tauzero.org>). Fobos sponsored three national sf short-story contests and subsequently published three volumes of prize winners, Púlsares 2002, Púlsares 2003,and Púlsares 2004. (An earlier contest, not organized by Fobos, resulted in the collection Fixión 2000.) Saavedra has written about Chilean fandom, and Hassón and Omar E. Vega recently compiled a comprehensive bibliography of the genre (this Chronology owes a large debt to these three researchers).\n\nThe literature itself is now more self-consciously science fictional, and many of the genre’s most innovative techniques and ideas are handled skillfully by such writers as Diego Muñoz, with Flores para un cyborg [Flowers for a Cyborg, 1997]; Pablo Castro, with “Exerion,” published in 2002 and available in English translation in the 2003 anthology Cosmos Latinos; and Sergio Amira, with “PET,” available in the 2002 edition of Pulsares: relatos chilenos de ciencia ficción. Jorge Baradit recently achieved a milestone in Chilean sf when his 2005 novel Ygdrasil was released by a major international publisher. Chilean sf’s momentum and quality may vary over time, as they do everywhere, but the genre is again on the ascendent thanks to a dedicated corps of writers and promoters. There is every reason to expect a vigorous Chilean presence on the future Spanish-language sf scene.\n\nUruguay\n\nUruguayan science fiction was only a collection of isolated texts until the 1970s, when a few authors began producing a body of work identifiable within the genre. It must be noted that a significant portion of Uruguayan science fiction was published outside the country, either because the authors lived abroad (mostly in Argentina) or because they found better publishing conditions there than in their own country. As a consequence, Uruguayan authors suffered from isolation and a lack of mutual influence.\n\nThe first Uruguayan forerunner of the genre that we know of is Francisco Piria’s El socialismo triunfante [Triumphant Socialism, 1899] a utopian work set two hundred years in the future, when illnesses are eradicated and all races and religions live in harmony. Piria took his utopian project seriously: he founded and built the city of Piriápolis (originally called Heliópolis) by the River Plate at the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nHoracio Quiroga, a master of short narrative, tried his hand at every genre, including science fiction. Among his most noteworthy efforts are the newspaper serial El hombre artificial [Artificial Man, 1910] and some of his short stories published in Más allá(1935). Between the death of Quiroga in 1937 and the publication of Mario Levrero’s first short stories at the end of the 1960s, we find no science fiction works in Uruguay.\n\nLevrero is the central figure in Uruguayan science fiction in the second half of the 20th century, but it is difficult to state conclusively that his work fits squarely within the genre. And yet, the sense of strangeness he conveys, his surrealist landscapes and the unusual situations surrounding his characters place Levrero, like Ballard, on the edge of science fiction. His most noteworthy work is the thematic trilogy La ciudad [The City, 1970], París [Paris, 1980], and El lugar [The Place, 1982].\n\nUnlike Levrero’s oeuvre, Tarik Carson’s pessimistic, bitter science fiction works clearly belong to the genre. Indeed, his short story collection El corazón reversible [The Reversible Heart, 1986] and his novel Ganadores [Winners, 1991] are some of the finest examples of Latin American science fiction.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s a few small groups of authors and fans have joined together to launch several short-lived science fiction magazines. There are also a number of writers, such as W. Gabriel Mainero, Roberto Bayeto, and Félix Obes Fleurquín, who regularly publish short stories in magazines and anthologies, but who have never published their work in book form unless it has been self-financed. Carlos María Federici has tried his hand at many genres, and within science fiction his best work is “El nexo de Maeterlinck” [The Maeterlinck Nexus, 1978]. Finally, Ana Solari, with sf novels such as Zack (1993), deserves mention as the most prominent figure of the past few years, although her latest works veer away from the genre.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe diversity of Latin American cultures is echoed in the diverse backgrounds of this Chronology’s authors. Yolanda Molina-Gavilán is from Madrid, Spain; Andrea Bell was raised in northern California and currently lives in Minnesota; Miguel Ángel Fernández-Delgado is from Mexico City, Mexico; M. Elizabeth Ginway is from New York, NY; Luis Pestarini is from Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Juan Carlos Toledano is from Adra, Spain.\n\n1. That earlier version was the product of the combined efforts of Yolanda Molina-Gavilán, Miguel Ángel Fernández Delgado, Andrea Bell, Luis Pestarini, and Juan Carlos Toledano. It was published as “Cronología de CF latinoamericana: 1775-1999” in Chasqui: Revista de Literatura Latinoamericana 29.2 (November 2000): 43-72.\n\n2. Another great Spanish-language magazine, the Argentinian Más allá, started even earlier in 1953 and folded in 1957 after 48 issues.\n\n3. Most of the information presented here is also found on that web site (<http://elforastero.blogalia.com/documentos/articulos/cienciaficcion.html>).\n\n4. These two short stories can be found online at <http://espanol.geocities.com/ cifiper2002/colaboraciones.htm>.\n\n5.

Andrew Brown’s “Edmondo Paz Soldán and His Precursors: Borges, Dick, and the SF Canon” elsewhere in this special section.\n\n6. By using the suffix “-itis”—as in tonsillitis, bronchitis—the term “Brazilitis” (as opposed to “Brazilian,” for example) is a play on words that deliberately evokes the image of disease, and thus takes the mania for Brazilianess to the point of sickness and repulsion.\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL LISTING OF SF WORKS BY COUNTRY\n\nArgentina\n\n1816: Valdés, Antonio José. “Delirio.” La Prensa Argentina (June 11 and 18).\n\n1850:Sarmiento, Domingo Faustino.
