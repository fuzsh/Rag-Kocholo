        "text": "New York native Charles Cyphers, an actor known for his roles in “Halloween” and “Major League,” has died at age 85.\n\nHis manager, Chris Roe, confirmed to Variety that Cyphers died on Sunday in Tucson, Ariz., following a brief illness. He did not provide further details.\n\nCyphers played Sheriff Leigh Brackett in John Carpenter’s original “Halloween,” released in 1978. He went on to reprise the role and reunite with Jamie Lee Curtis in 1981’s “Halloween II” and the reboot-sequel “Halloween Kills” in 2021. The latter marked his final film appearance before his death.\n\n“To be called back again in a film, it’s unheard of after 40 years. Most people are dead,” Cyphers said in a 2022 interview at HorrorConUK.\n\nNancy Keyes, who played his doomed daughter Annie Brackett in the classic horror flick, remembered him fondly.\n\n“So sorry to hear about dear Chuck,” Keyes told People magazine. “My friend of many years, he could always be relied on for a kind word, a good laugh and a great story. How he will be missed.”\n\nAlongside Keyes, Cyphers also appeared in Carpenter’s “Assault on Precinct 13” and “The Fog.” He worked with Carpenter again on the 1981 low-budget action classic “Escape From New York.”\n\nIn addition to his collaborations with Carpenter, he also appeared on episodes of “Seinfeld,” “ER,” “The Dukes of Hazzard,” “Starsky and Hutch,” “The Betty White Show,” “Charlie’s Angels,” and many more."
