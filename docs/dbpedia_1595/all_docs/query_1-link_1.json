Signed and titled on the back.\n\nSize: 51 x 73,3 cm; 77 x 100 cm (frame).\n\nSurrealist painter, although not all his work developed within this movement. Dalí discovered him when he was very young, when he was fascinated by the fantastic drawings he made in the Mallorquina pastry shop in Cadaqués, where he worked. He soon became friends with René Magritte. In 1929 he moved with his family to Blanes, a town to which he remained linked all his life, despite having settled in Barcelona. He holds his first exhibition at the Dalmau galleries in Barcelona, where he will continue to exhibit his work. Among the great avant-garde artists, he exhibited at the First International Exhibition of Surrealism, held at the New Burlington Galleries (1936), together with Dalí, Miró and Óscar Domínguez. He is represented in the most prestigious collections in the world, such as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, the Gala Dalí Foundation, in the private collections of André Breton and Luis Buñuel. The Angel Planells Foundation in Blanes is dedicated to the dissemination and preservation of his work. Caja Madrid organised a major retrospective of his work in 2005.",

By modifying the General Conditions set out on the https://setdart.com website, said duty of notification shall be understood to have been fulfilled.\n\nIn any case, before using the services or contracting products, the General Conditions may be consulted.\n\n4.- Description of the products and services\n\nhttps://setdart.com is an online auction whose purpose is to sell art, antiques, collectibles and other artistic goods of a similar nature that are entrusted to it for this purpose.\n\nSetdart Subastas and its fiscal figure Setdart Online SL act as mediators between the owner and the buyer of each lot.\n\nTo be able to bid on Setdart, it is necessary to register as a user, after reading these Conditions and the Privacy Policy. Enter the link on the Home page \"Register as a user\" and correctly fill in the boxes with your data. The form will ask you to enter a \"user code\" and a \"password\". This guarantees the privacy and authenticity of the bids, since when you make an offer, your user code will be visible in the bid history and not your name and surname, and the bid will not enter unless you enter the correct password.\n\nYour personal data must be authentic and correct since, in the event of any falsehood or manipulation, Setdart will cancel the registered client. Once the correct form has been sent, Setdart will accept you as a user and will send you the approval, via email, so that you can act as a bidder. Registering as a user entitles you to receive the Newsletter that Setdart sends weekly to its users, via email, with the most outstanding news.\n\nOnce your user registration has been approved by Setdart, you can operate on the page as a bidder.\n\nWhen bidding Setdart presents you with several alternatives. The first is to bid directly for the next amount the auction goes for; When entering the lot, mark the quantity you want to bid on. When accepting the bid, a proforma appears on the screen with the total amount that would be paid if the lot is awarded, including the commission and VAT on the commission. Only when you accept this proforma, will your bid enter the lot. Remember that to place a bid you must always be logged in as a user. You can also make the EXPRESS BID, in which you will bid directly for the higher amount without opening the information window.\n\nAnother option is SELF-BID: You have the possibility to bid for a higher amount, using the drop-down. In the latter case, the AutoBid system will be activated. The AutoBid is an automatic bidding system in which the system itself will enter your bid, revealing the immediately subsequent bid and will in turn save the highest bid you have made. This will not enter the auction unless another user exceeds it. Ultimately, the SELF-BID will allow you to record your maximum amount that will only be activated in the event that you are exceeded or that the piece has not reached its reserve price.\n\nWhen entering the lot, mark the quantity you want to bid on. When accepting the bid, a proforma appears on the screen with the total amount that would be paid if the lot is awarded, including the commission and VAT on the commission. Only when you accept this proforma, will your bid enter the lot. Remember that to place a bid you must always be logged in as a user.\n\nThe lots presented at auction have a Reserve Price, that is, a confidential minimum price agreed between the consignor or transferor-seller and Setdart. If at the end of the auction the last bid does not reach this reserve price, the lot is not awarded and therefore it is not sold. Before the auction ends, the transferor-seller can modify the reserve price downwards in order to accept or move closer to the last existing offer at that time. Therefore, the agreed reserve price may be downward with the consent of the consignee.\n\nEach lot is marked with a Low Estimate and a High Estimate, which represents the opinion of Setdart's experts about the range at which a lot is likely to sell at auction. Estimates are based on examining the lot or item and comparing market prices for comparable works. These estimates provide buyers with a prior indication of value and are generally a basis for setting the reserve price. The buyer can be sure that if he meets or exceeds the low estimate, he has reached the minimum price or reserve of the lot but this does not mean that the reserve price is equal to the low estimate as the reserve price may be lower.\n\nIn Setdart there are also lots at Free Price, this means that there is no reserve price and, therefore, they are sold whenever there is a bid, whatever its value.\n\nIt is strictly forbidden for any transferor / seller to make, personally or through third parties, bids on their own lots with the aim of increasing the award values of the lots and not with the intention of buying. In the event that such an action is detected, Setdart reserves the right to immediately cancel the user accounts used for this purpose, and to withdraw the auction lots from the transferor seller.\n\nIn the event that a lot has not reached the reserve price, before the auction time ends, Setdart's bidding system indicates in the bid history \"Reserve Price Not Reached\" and the auction time automatically increases. 3 minutes so that potential buyers can continue bidding if they want to win that lot. Only in this case, the system will admit that the same bidder exceeds his last offer in order to reach the reserve price and win the lot. Once the duration of the auction is over, when the timer indicates \"This auction has ended\", the user will be able to see if the lot has not reached the reserve price and, therefore, the lot has not been awarded, or if On the contrary, the lot has been awarded and sold.\n\nIf you are the winner of a lot, you will receive an e-mail informing you of the award once the day's auctions are over. During the next day you will receive the budget for your settlement. The settlement period is seven working days.\n\nAs a customer, from the \"My Data\" section on the web, you can change your data, as well as the user code and password, to access the bidding process and from the \"My Setdart\" section you can consult all the information updated regarding your bids, purchases, sales or payments. If you wish to unsubscribe as a user, you must contact us, via email or telephone.\n\nIt is not necessary to be registered as a user to travel through our website.\n\nRegistration as a user has no charge. As a member of a community with a common interest, the only prerequisite to any transaction is acceptance of the rules of procedure.\n\nOnce registered, the user agrees to use the means of the Setdart.com website for the purpose for which they were created and to act in accordance with current legislation, respecting the privacy policy and the moral characteristics of the page, being Setdart's power is the fact that in the event of non-compliance with any of these conditions and regulations, the user's account may be suspended or eliminated without prior notice or the right to any type of compensation.\n\nIncidents in Auctions\n\nIn the event that there is any incident of connectivity or access to the Setdart service, it will be notified to the last bidding user and published on the Setdart home page.\n\nIn any case, Setdart reserves the right to extend the auction to the next day to guarantee access for all users or to cancel the affected Auction.\n\nThe auction lots are presented on the web with a complete cataloging and with additional images that can be enlarged so that the user-buyer can have a complete vision of the state in which they are. Auctions Setdart also offers an advisory service to inform you about the state of conservation of the piece, its author, market prices or any other available data. The advice will be provided in accordance with the reasonable and prudent judgment of Auctions Setdart but without assuming any responsibility for the content of said information and, therefore, the buyer must form his own conviction.\n\nThe data in the image gallery relating to the author, origin, age, provenance and status of the lots are included after careful investigation, verification and advice, but for their accuracy, Setdart Auctions does not accept any responsibility. Interested parties must form their own opinions regarding the pieces before the auction closes. If the user-buyer wishes to physically view a lot, he can request it from Setdart Subasta, which will facilitate this whenever possible.\n\nCanceling a purchase\n\nAs a buyer, you can cancel an acquisition within fourteen days from the auction date, only in cases where the piece does not correspond to the catalog or has very significant flaws not indicated in the description or that cannot be seen in the images. The inauthenticity of the object must be reasoned and justified by an authority on the matter. The part must be returned in the same condition and condition as it was delivered.\n\nSetdart reserves the right to cancel the user's account in the event that the user cancels an award for a reason other than one of the above due to the damage caused to the seller, the next bidder and the auction directly.\n\nIn any of these cases and always within the established period, Setdart will mediate and refund the money paid for the purchase of the object in full. The transport costs in the collection and delivery of the piece or any other expense that is not the auction amount plus the commission and VAT, will not be paid by Setdart.\n\nAny other claim that the buyer wants to make for inaccurate data or falsification of the piece, must be inexcusably addressed to the seller, while Setdart does not assume the authenticity of the piece but only mediation in the sale.\n\nIn no case may compensation or compensation be claimed on pieces that, having been auctioned or awarded, have been lost, stolen from or in the auction, withdrawn from auction or canceled, expressly limiting the amount to be returned to the amount of the award of the piece to the buyer .\n\nIn no case Setdart Online, s.l. will accept any responsibility for the possible damages occurred during the transport of the auctioned lot / s, it will only be responsible if the piece suffers any damage during its stay at the facilities of Setdart Online, s.l.\n\nUnder no circumstances will any claim on the awarded lots be admitted, after 15 days from the auction of the piece.\n\nThe parties involved, seller-depositor and buyer, must comply with the provisions of the Heritage Law, the General Tax Law and the Intellectual Property Law.\n\nIndirect taxation on purchases from individuals.\n\nAcquisitions made to individuals at auction, is an operation subject to the Tax on Patrimonial Transmissions, a tax assigned to the Autonomous Communities so it will have to be in accordance with their particular regulations, being the taxpayer the purchaser, who must carry out the self-assessment the fee resulting from applying the tax rate in force on the date of the acquisition, in the Autonomous Community where it has its fiscal domicile, using the form provided for this purpose, normally the 600 form.\n\nThe operations in which Setdart Auctions intervenes are subject to the provisions of Spanish Law and, more specifically, to the stipulations that regulate mediation and deposit contracts.\n\nOnce the lot has been awarded, a quote will be sent to you indicating the auction price and additional costs. An 24% commission is added to the auction price of the piece. This commission is subject to VAT, and therefore, the corresponding VAT of 21% must be added. If you need transportation, it will also be budgeted depending on the nature of the lot and the destination. Transportation costs are also subject to VAT.\n\nDelivery times:\n\nOnce the lot has been settled, Setdart will proceed to carry out the arrangements for packaging and transporting the piece. Note that all the pieces that have more than 100 years are required of an export permit from the Spanish Ministry of Culture. If the lot goes outside the EU, there will be a cost for such certificate. Kindly note you can check all this information in the Spanish Miistry of Culture website. This period may vary depending on the availability of the part in our facilities, if it must be collected at the place of deposit or if the part requires special packaging or adjustments. If the client requests a grouping of lots to lower transport costs, we will wait to receive the last lot to make the shipment, although the payment deadlines will have to be met.\n\n1. Pick up at the Setdart facilities:\n\nYou can collect your lots yourself at our facilities in Barcelona, once you have been informed by email that the lots are available. In the event that you are not the one who collects the awarded lot or lots, you must give an authorization to the person who is going to do it by means of an authorization document or via e-mail.\n\n2. Shipments via MRW:\n\nSetdart.com usually works with MRW as a transport and courier service. Setdart sends you an e-mail indicating that your shipment is ready. The collections are normally made at 18:30 in the afternoon, except in cases of urgent shipments. Shipping through MRW is usually received within 24-48 hours.\n\nShipments made by MRW have insurance that covers up to 3,000 euros on the award price. Any claim for a shipment must be made, at most, within 48 hours of receipt. After this period, there will be no insurance coverage. It is also necessary to keep the original packaging in order to make a claim.\n\nIf you wish to receive the piece at a different address than the one you have specified as a user, you must indicate it in the \"alternative shipping address\" in your USER REGISTRATION or send it by mail to [email protected].\n\n3. Collection of lots by your private carrier:\n\nYou can use your own means of transport or hire the one of your choice directly. Setdart.com, by default, includes the transport price in its budget. So, if you want to hire your own transport or collect the lot in person, it is necessary that you inform us as soon as possible so that we can send you the settlement estimate without this charge. In this case, only, the packaging would be charged if it were necessary.\n\nAdditional insurance:\n\nIf you wish to take out additional insurance to cover the total amount of the lot, you can contact us and we will carry out the management with an insurance company specialized in objects of art and / or jewelry.\n\nPrices:\n\nIn Setdart we have preferred to adopt the auction system with Estimate and Reserve Price since it seems to us a more flexible system and that allows a greater rapprochement and understanding between Offer and Demand.\n\nAs already indicated in the Conditions of sale, most pieces at auction have a reserve price, that is, a confidential minimum price agreed between the transferor-seller and Setdart.com. If at the end of the auction the last bid does not reach this reserve price, the lot is not awarded and therefore it is not sold. Before the auction ends, the transferor-seller can modify the reserve price downwards in order to accept or move closer to the last existing offer at that time. Thus, the agreed reserve price is movable downward. In Setdart there are also lots at Free Price, this means that there is no reserve price and, therefore, they are sold whenever there is a bid, whatever its value.\n\nEach lot is marked with a low estimate and a high estimate, which represents the opinion of Setdart's experts about the range at which a lot may be sold at auction. Estimates are based on examining the lot or item and comparing market prices for comparable works. These estimates provide buyers with a prior indication of value and are generally a basis for setting the reserve price. The buyer can be sure that if he meets or exceeds the low estimate, he has reached the minimum price or reserve of the lot but this does not mean that the reserve price is equal to the low estimate as the reserve price may be lower.\n\nDuring the last hour of the auction process for each lot, Setdart's bidding system indicates in the bid history if the last offer has not reached the reserve price set with the acronym NAPR (Not Reached Reserve Price), inviting the Bidders to continue bidding if they wish to win that lot. Only in this case, the system will admit that the same bidder exceeds his last offer in order to reach the reserve price and win the lot. Once the duration of the auction is over, when the timer indicates \"This auction has ended\", it will be immediately informed whether or not the lot has been awarded.\n\nPayment Methods:\n\nTo settle your lots, you can pay by credit / debit card through our website. Banco Sabadell offers you the Virtual POS, an online payment gateway that allows you to pay your batches with a card, through the internet, in an easy and, above all, safe way.\n\nBanco Sabadell's online payment platform integrates CES (Secure Electronic Purchase) which, under the international protocols Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode, provides high security and protection in payments.
