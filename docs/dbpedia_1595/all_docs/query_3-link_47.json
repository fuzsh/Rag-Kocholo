Her work focuses on questions of emotions, the law, and democratic institutions. Sonali is the author of two books—Radical Enfranchisement in the Jury Room and Public Life (University of Chicago Press, 2019) and Sing the Rage: Listening to Anger After Mass Violence (University of Chicago Press, 2014)—as well as numerous peer-reviewed articles and chapters in publications including Political Theory and the Journal of Law, Culture, and the Humanities. At Wesleyan, she teaches courses including What Is the Good Life?, The Moral Basis of Politics, Transitional Justice, and Acting and Citizenship, among others. She served on the Educational Policy Committee in 2019–20, and on the faculty board of the Fries Center for Global Studies in 2018–19. In 2014, she was awarded Wesleyan’s Baker Memorial Prize. Sonali has been the Ann Plato Post-Doctoral Fellow at Trinity College and Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellow at the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University. She earned a B.A. in political science from Swarthmore College, and an M.A., an M.Phil., and a Ph.D. in political science from Yale University.\n\nDouglas Arthur Martin\n\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF THE PRACTICE IN CREATIVE WRITING\n\nDouglas Arthur Martin, assistant professor of the practice in creative writing, joined Wesleyan’s faculty in 2008. Douglas is an author of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and prose, whose books have been translated into Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. The most recent book, Wolf, is “an anti–true crime novel about abuse, patricide, and Southern working-class life.” Douglas’s first novel, Outline of My Lover, was an International Book of the Year in the Times Literary Supplement, and was adapted in part for the multimedia ballet and live film Kammer/Kammer. It has now been reissued in a 20th-anniversary edition. Douglas’s work also has been recognized with a Lambda Award nomination in the Gay Memoir/Biography category (Once You Go Back) and as a finalist for the Ferro-Grumley Award (Branwell). At Wesleyan, Douglas teaches creative writing courses in all genres and currently serves as assistant director of creative writing. Born in Virginia and raised in Georgia, Douglas now divides time between Brooklyn, upstate New York, and Connecticut.

She is co-chair of the College of Education Studies, established in 2020. Anna directs research in the Wesleyan Cognitive Development Laboratories exploring how young children’s experiences change their thinking and behavior. Her research has been published in numerous scholarly journals, including Developmental Science, Cognition, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. At Wesleyan, she teaches courses in developmental psychology, education, early childhood, and cognitive science. Her efforts to connect University-based research to real-world settings include Kindergarten Kickstart, a summer bridge-to-kindergarten program in Middletown; two service-learning courses connecting students to local preschools; and a large project to develop and test research-based math games for early childhood settings. She has held many University service positions, including serving as chair of the Education Policy Committee and as a McNair Research advisor. Anna earned an Sc.B. in neuroscience from Brown University and a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard University. Prior to teaching at Wesleyan, she was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard and a science teacher at Saint Ann’s School in Brooklyn. She has received a National Science Foundation CAREER Award and was a finalist for the Campus Compact Ehrlich Civically Engaged Faculty Award.\n\nHONORARY DEGREES\n\nReginald Dwayne Betts\n\nHONORARY DOCTOR OF LETTERS\n\nReginald Dwayne Betts is the award-winning author of four collections of poetry, a nonfiction memoir, and a powerful body of essays and scholarship that has been featured in such publications as The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Washington Post. The founder and director of the Million Book Project, his work has earned him a Radcliffe Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, NEA Fellowships, and a PEN New England Award for poetry, among many other recognitions.\n\nIn his National Magazine Award–winning essay “Getting Out,” published in The New York Times Magazine in 2018, Betts explores the central themes of self-reflection and self-actualization, and the effects of incarceration on individuals, families, and communities. A gifted student in elementary and high school, Betts was himself sentenced to nine years in maximum security prison at age 16. During that time, he studied literature and poetry and laid the foundation for a career that has since seen him earn a B.A. from the University of Maryland, an M.F.A. from Warren Wilson College, and a J.D. from Yale Law School. Betts has engaged in wide-ranging speaking engagements and has years of experience in public defense, advocacy, and public service. He has received an appointment from Governor Ned Lamont to Connecticut’s Criminal Justice Commission, the state body that hires all state prosecutors.\n\nBetts is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Law at Yale University and continues to lecture on his formative experiences and the importance that grit, perseverance, and literature have played in his success, as well as the intersection between literature and advocacy. His most recent collection of poems, Felon: Poems (2019), was a winner of the American Book Award and the NAACP Image Award, and a finalist for the LA Times Book Award. He is also the author of A Question of Freedom: A Memoir of Learning, Survival, and Coming of Age in Prison and the poetry collections Shahid Reads His Own Palm (2010) and Bastards of the Reagan Era (2015).\n\nCatherine Coleman Flowers\n\nHONORARY DOCTOR OF SCIENCE\n\nCatherine Coleman Flowers is a renowned environmental health advocate whose work focuses on bringing attention to and developing solutions for failing water and waste sanitation infrastructure in rural areas, and increasing our understanding of how this infrastructure failure perpetuates health and socioeconomic disparities. For her work, Flowers was awarded a 2020 MacArthur Fellowship, also known as a “Genius Grant,” which goes to citizens or residents of the United States who demonstrate “extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction.”\n\nOriginally from Lowndes County, Alabama, Flowers earned a B.A. from Cameron University in 1986 and an M.A. from the University of Nebraska in 2015, and worked as a high school teacher in Detroit, Michigan, and Washington, D.C., before returning to Lowndes to begin her advocacy work. She is the founding director of the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice, an Alabama-based policy and advocacy organization devoted to addressing the root causes of poverty in the state and developing multidisciplinary, grassroots solutions and models that can be replicated in rural communities throughout the country. Part of the organization’s work included a house-to-house survey in Lowndes that confirmed more than half of county households were either piping raw sewage into the ground or had failing septic systems, which led to the first open discussion of flaws in onsite water treatment (which previously had been governed under threat of incarceration by the Alabama Public Health Department). She is currently collaborating with The Guardian on a national study to identify and quantify wastewater infrastructure problems throughout the United States.\n\nFlowers is the author of Waste: One Woman’s Fight Against America’s Dirty Secret (2020), and has published articles in Anglican Theological Review, Columbia Human Rights Law Review, and American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, among other journals. She is also the rural development manager for the Equal Justice Initiative, a senior fellow for the Center for Earth Ethics at Union Theological Seminary, and a member of the board of directors of the Climate Reality Project and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Flowers was recently appointed to the Biden-Sanders Task Force on Climate Change, co-chaired by United States Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former Secretary of State John Kerry, who is now a special envoy for climate.\n\nScott Gottlieb ’94\n\nHONORARY DOCTOR OF SCIENCE\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb ’94 is a physician, public health and policy advisor and advocate, and a special partner with the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates. He served as the 23rd commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2017 to 2019 and is currently a resident fellow at public policy think tank the American Enterprise Institute (AEI).\n\nDr. Gottlieb’s work spans a great many aspects of health care. At the FDA, he oversaw a record number of generic drugs, novel medicines, and innovative medical devices in two consecutive years, helping to make the regulatory process in those areas more efficient; advanced policies to address opioid addiction; reduced death and disease from tobacco; and guided important progress on drug pricing, food safety, and vaccination. At AEI, he has pursued public health improvements through entrepreneurship and continued to focus on medical innovation and expanding regulatory approaches aimed at patient and physician autonomy.\n\nAfter graduating from Wesleyan with a B.A. in economics, Dr. Gottlieb went on to earn his M.D. from Mount Sinai School of Medicine and conducted his residency in internal medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He serves on the boards of Pfizer, Illumina, Aetion, and Tempus, and was previously a senior policy advisor to the administrator at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and a clinical assistant professor at New York University School of Medicine, in addition to a practicing physician and hospitalist. He is a frequent contributor to CNBC and CBS’s Face the Nation, and has also published commentary and articles in Health Affairs, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, among many others.\n\nDEGREES IN COURSE\n\nDOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY\n\nDaniel Christopher Alvey\n\nB.S., The United States Military Academy, 2011\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nDissertation: Approximation on Affine Subspaces\n\nKayla E.

Aaron Treadwell, Class of 1888, received the first such degree, an M.S., at the graduation exercises of 1891. He went on to earn a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago and to serve as a professor of biology and zoology at Vassar College from 1900 to 1937.\n\nThe granting of unearned master’s degrees to alumni was a common practice in American higher education through most of the 19th century. Three years after obtaining the B.A., a Wesleyan graduate who had “sustained a good moral character” could obtain the M.A. by payment of “the customary fee of five dollars.” Upon recommendation of the faculty in the late 1880s, the trustees terminated this practice. The last such degrees were dispensed in 1891.\n\nThe awarding of honorary master’s degrees at Wesleyan began with the first Commencement. In 1833, the Rev. John Foster, principal of Wesleyan Academy (now Wilbraham & Monson Academy), was so recognized by the University. Foster was a self-educated Methodist circuit rider who came to this country from England in 1823. One hundred and five years later, Wesleyan’s M.A. was the first honorary degree received by another largely self-educated man, Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nIn 1894, the M.A. ad eundem gradum was first granted to “permanent members of the faculty who are graduates of other colleges.” As the Latin phrase suggests, this degree went to those who held a degree of at least the same grade from another institution. Among the “permanent” or full professors thus brought into the Wesleyan alumni ranks in 1894 was President Bradford P. Raymond, the first president of the University to hold a Ph.D.\n\nCommencement ceremonies from 1954 to 1976 included the awarding of Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. In 1955, Wesleyan’s Master of Arts in Liberal Studies Program, the earliest of its kind in American higher education, produced its first eight graduates.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nSinging of the “Alma Mater” and Wesleyan “Fight Song” will be led by members of Wesleyan singing groups.\n\nPROCESSIONAL MUSIC\n\nTaiko Drumming Ensemble\n\nDirected by\n\nFumi Tanakadate ’12, Visiting Instructor in Music\n\nENSEMBLE MEMBERS\n\nShuyuan Hung ’21\n\nDaniel P.

The Commencement is one of the few public events at which the University celebrates the academic purposes and accomplishments of members of the Wesleyan family. In symbolic recognition of these achievements, the trustees, administrators, faculty, and recipients of degrees are attired in academic costume for this occasion. In 1997, Wesleyan began the practice of inviting the parents of Wesleyan students who serve as educators, either teachers or administrators, to don academic regalia and march as a division in the procession.\n\nPlease note: Due to safety protocols on campus during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 Commencement procession has a limited number of participants (other than graduates). In addition, the recession will not be held.\n\nTraditionally, the Wesleyan procession* is arranged by academic degrees, lowest to highest. Within each group of degree recipients, the graduates are ordered alphabetically. The faculty, administrators, trustees, and parent-educators are arranged by date of receipt of the first, or bachelor’s, degree, youngest first. The platform party is composed of those Wesleyan officers with Commencement duties: the chair of the Board of Trustees, the president, the provost and vice president for Academic Affairs, the director of Continuing Studies and Graduate Liberal Studies, and the vice president for Student Affairs. The recession, including only those seated on Denison Terrace, is in reverse order.\n\nThe procession is led by the marshal of the faculty, whose function derives from a keeper of the horses in the medieval royal household. As a badge of office, the marshal carries a mace that has evolved from the spiked staff used in battle in the Middle Ages. Wesleyan boasts a mace designed and constructed by the late Professor of Art John Risley to mark the University’s Sesquicentennial in 1981. Made of redwood, the mace depicts the Wesleyan seal surmounted by the cardinal. Incorporated in the design are paintings by Professor Emeritus of English Joseph Reed of Willbur Fisk, Wesleyan’s first president; Victor Butterfield, president from 1943 to 1967; the University seal; and South College, the oldest building on campus.\n\nThe procession begins on the incline of Foss Hill with the formation of an aisle of honor by the faculty, the trustees, the platform party, the honorary degree recipients, and the parent-educators. Through this aisle proceed the members of the graduating class to receive applause and congratulations from the other participants.\n\nAt the base of the hill, the procession moves to its seats on Denison Terrace and Andrus Field in the following order: faculty marshal, color guard, senior class officers, seniors who received University honors, the rest of the senior class, recipients of earned graduate degrees, parent-educators, faculty and trustees, retiring faculty, recipients of the M.A. ad eundem gradum, award winners, honorary degree recipients, and the platform party.\n\nWesleyan seniors first presented themselves for graduation in caps and gowns at the Commencement of 1892. This custom had appeared at a few American colleges in the 1870s. It became a regular practice on this campus in 1897. Faculty did not adopt this practice until a few years later. A Methodist newspaper reported in 1902 that faculty assembled on the Commencement platform wore “all sorts of fashion in clothing, from the dignified and appropriate Prince Albert coat, with its fitting accompaniments, down to a gray sack suit and red necktie.” The reporter thought even John Wesley would have disapproved of this disarray and urged faculty to join the seniors in wearing academic garb. Acting upon a faculty recommendation made several months later, Wesleyan’s trustees decided that the practice of professors processing in academic regalia should begin with the Commencement season of 1903. Those festivities included celebration of the Wesley Bicentennial “with much dignity and impressiveness.”\n\nThe trustees themselves completed this trend to academic attire in 1917. That Commencement in Memorial Chapel was the first held on Wesleyan’s campus. The site for almost all prior Commencements had been the First Methodist Church in Middletown.\n\nThe academic costumes of the degree recipients and the other participants represent an evolution of robes worn centuries ago. No longer are gowns worn during instructional periods or for warmth. Now the regalia merely symbolize the academic degrees of the wearers and the universities and colleges awarding those degrees.\n\nThough the traditional headwear is the mortarboard, many schools now opt for the soft Tam o’ Shanter-style cap. The tassel is generally black, but holders of the doctoral degrees may wear gold tassels. The custom of moving the tassel from right-front to left-front at the time a degree is awarded has practically vanished.\n\nBlack gowns are acceptable for all institutions, but some universities have adopted optional colors for gowns. For example, Yale gowns are Yale blue; Harvard, crimson; Columbia, light blue; Princeton, black with orange trim. In recent decades, the B.A. recipients at Wesleyan have worn cardinal red gowns. The velvet panels down the front and around the neck of doctors’ gowns may be colored, depending on the faculty awarding the degree: philosophy for the Philosophia Doctor, dark blue; law for the Juris Doctor, purple; medicine, green; education, light blue; science, golden yellow; theology, scarlet; arts, letters, and humanities, white. The three bars on the sleeve of a gown signify a doctor’s degree; four, the president.\n\nA hood indicates the level of the degree, the faculty in which the degree was awarded, and the university awarding the degree. The length of the hood and the width of its velvet trim signify the level. Masters’ hoods are three-and-one-half feet long, with velvet trim three inches wide; doctors’ hoods, four feet, with a five-inch width of velvet trim. The velvet trim on these hoods, like the optional trim colors on the doctor’s gown, is colored according to the faculty awarding the degree: philosophy, dark blue; law, purple; etc. Since 1895, the colors of the lining have indicated the institution awarding the degree: Harvard has adopted black lined with crimson; Yale, Yale blue; Princeton, orange with a single black chevron; Williams, purple; Amherst, purple with a single white chevron. Wesleyan’s colors, displayed on hoods worn by recipients of the Ph.D., M.A., M.Phil., and M.A.L.S. degrees, are cardinal red with a single black chevron.\n\nThe South College Bells, traditionally played before and after the Commencement ceremony, were installed in December 1918 as the gift of the Class of 1863. Members of that class were “possessed of unusual intellectual ability. . . . They were jolly good fellows. Everybody liked them, even the president and some of the professors,” according to the December 1918 Wesleyan University Alumnus magazine. “They were a musical class,” fitting for the donors. The original 11 copper-alloy bells were cast in 1916 by Mears and Stainbank, founders, of London, in business since 1570. Special permission of the War Bureau was required to bring them into the country during the Great War. During restoration in 1966, facilitated by an anonymous contribution (by President Butterfield, it turned out), five bells were added. In 2005, an additional eight bells, donated by Wesleyan friends, alumni, and parents, were installed. This new addition upgraded the South College Bells from the status of a chime (10 to 22 bells) to that of a carillon (23 or more). The bells are played by a direct action keyboard of wooden peg-like keys, and, according to a 1974 Wesleyan Argus article, they are “hung on hickory beams to add to the mellowness of the tone.”\n\nCome, Raise the Song\n\nWords by F.
