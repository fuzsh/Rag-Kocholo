Currently, he is involved in an ERC Advanced-Grant in Archaeology (ARTSOUNDSCAPES) as the leader of two research lines (psychoacoustics and neuroscience).\n\nResearch interest\n\nMy research focuses on how the human brain builds up the auditory world around us to give rise to auditory perception. In particular, I am interested in how the brain models the implicit regularity in the acoustic environment supporting predictive perception, and more recently in how it encodes a particular type of sounds, those of speech, as critical prerequisite towards human communication. My approach is multimodal, including EEG, magnetoencephalography (MEG), structural and functional neuroimaging, and animal models. The results of my research support the emerging view that the subcortical auditory system has complex computation capabilities contributing to auditory cognition. My current projects address speech sounds acquisition in very young infants born normally or after clinical conditions challenging fetal development. Also, I inquiry how the acoustic environment where sounds are heard shapes the way these are perceived, eventually triggering altered states of consciousness.\n\nKey words\n\nPsychology, cognitive neuroscience, attention, auditory perception, speech\n\nORCID\n\n0000-0001-8203-2951\n\nResercher ID\n\nA-8658-201\n\nCLOSE\n\nEsteban-Guitart, Moises\n\nUniversitat de Girona (UdG) ¬∑ Institut de Recerca Educativa (director)\n\nFull Professor at the Department of Psychology and director of the Institute of Educational Research at the University of Girona (UdG).

The coordination of these neuronal networks ultimately leads to our perception of the world, reasoning and consciousness. Despite great progress, our current understanding of the brain is still very primitive. For instance, it is not well understood how information is represented in the sensory cortex, and how this information is readout to generate behavior.\n\nIn the Theoretical and Cognitive Neuroscience group, we study the link between neuronal activity, perception and behavior. How is sensory information represented in neuronal activity? How is this information readout by downstream neurons to form a perceptual decision or make a choice?\n\nThus, our work has shed new light over the link between neuronal activity and perception and decision-making. Our next steps will further advance our understanding of this linkage by exploring new territories of behavior.\n\nKey words\n\nreinforcement learning, behavior, decision-making, neuroscience, neural networks\n\nORCID\n\n0000-0003-0398-014X\n\nResercher ID\n\nnone\n\nCLOSE\n\nMu√±oz Mendoza, Jordi\n\nUniversitat de Barcelona (UB) ¬∑ Departament de Ci√®ncia Pol√≠tica, Dret Constitucional i Filosofia del Dret\n\nI am Associate Professor (Professor Agregat) at the Department of Political Science of the University of Barcelona, and Fellow at the Institutions and Political Economy Research Group.

We use mobile technologies to map real-life person-context interactions and their impact on the dynamic expression of symptoms and wellbeing, which informs clinical diagnoses and helps tailoring individualized treatments.

A successful theory of meaning should account for our ability to construct and interpret an infinite variety of complex utterances; it should also explain how we integrate general knowledge, information about the specific individuals and situations we refer to, and information about the structure of the discourses in which we participate. I aim to develop a general theory of meaning that makes testable predictions about the similarities and differences between languages, about human language processing and acquisition, and about language change; one that, eventually, might be computationally implemented. Traditionally, theories of meaning have differed according to whether they take language to signal something in the world versus some sort of conceptual representation. In contrast, the model I am developing explicitly integrates these two approaches to meaning.\n\nKey words\n\nlinguistics, semantics, pragmatics, computational semantics\n\nORCID\n\n0000-0002-3355-913X\n\nResercher ID\n\nC-2615-2013\n\nCLOSE\n\nMorr√°s Ruiz-Falc√≥, Mar√≠a\n\nUniversitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) ¬∑ Humanitats\n\nMar√≠a Morr√°s is Senior Lecturer of Spanish Literature at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, accredited in 2017 as Full Professor.

I focus on food systems and compare conventional, organic and agroecological production as they interlock with struggles around socioecological valuation and economic valorization circuits.\n\nKey words\n\nEconomic Anthropology, Food production, Social Reproduction, Crisis, Gender relations, Racism, Valuation, Sustainability\n\nORCID\n\n0000-0001-7390-7840\n\nCLOSE\n\nNieto-Galan, Agust√≠\n\nUniversitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB) ¬∑ Institut d'Hist√≤ria de la Ci√®ncia\n\nAgust√≠ Nieto-Galan is Full Professor of History of Science at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB), ICREA Acad√®mia Fellow (2009 & 2018), and director of the Institute d'Hist√≤ria de la Ci√®ncia (iHC) at the UAB. Following degrees in both chemistry (URL) and history (UB), he took his PhD in the History of Science at the Universitat de Barcelona (UB) and held postdoctoral positions in the Modern History Faculty, University of Oxford, and the Centre de Recherche en Histoire des Sciences et des Techniques at the Cit√© des Sciences et de l‚ÄôIndustrie/ CNRS, Paris. He has written widely on the history of chemistry and natural dyestuffs, the history of the popularization of science (18th-20th centuries), and the relation between science and power in the twentieth century. Among his last books it is worth mentioning: The Politics of Chemistry (Cambridge, 2019), T√≥xicos invisibles (Icaria, 2020) and The Land of the Hunger Artists (Cambridge, 2023, forthcoming).\n\nResearch interest\n\nDr. Nieto-Galan analyses several historical cases in which science played a key role in the public sphere. As a continuation of his work on science popularization, he develops the \"hunger artists\" project as an example of intersection between science and spectacle in the late nineteenth century at a global scale.\n\nHe also explores the role of science popularization in non-democratic societies such as Franco's dictatorship and its funtction as diplomatic tool in international organizations. He is now editing a collective volume on the role of science popularization at UNESCO in the 1950s.\n\nHis analysis of the relation of science and power in the 20th century - in particular, chemistry- has led him to work on toxic products as relevant sociotechnical agents, and on the experts' practices of invisibilization of pollution and risk (agnotology) from a political perspective. He is also working on a biography of chemist and science popularizer Miquel Masriera.\n\nKey words\n\nHistory of Science, History of Chemistry, Science Popularization, Urban History of Science, Science and Power, Science Diplomacy\n\nORCID\n\n0000-0002-3458-0774\n\nResercher ID\n\nCivil servant number: 3503259424A0504\n\nCLOSE\n\nPiqu√© Huerta, Raquel\n\nUniversitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB) ¬∑ Departament of Prehistory\n\nPhD in History by the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (1997).

My research during the last five years has provided outstanding data on plant raw materials used, woodworking techniques, and crafts in prehistoric times in Western Mediterranean during the early Holocene, contributing to widener our knowledge of environmental, economic and social changes. My second focus of interest has been the end of hunter-gatherer societies and the impact of agricultural societies on the environment. I conducted this research primarily at the sites of La Draga (Banyoles, Girona, Spain) (5300-4900 cal BC) and Coves del Fem (Ulldemolins, Tarragona, Spain) (6000-4500 cal BC). The research has demonstrated the importance of these archaeological sites for explaining the Neolithization process in northeastern Iberia and has provided outstanding data on the landscape, technology, and resource management.\n\nKey words\n\nPrehistory, Archaeobotany, Early Farming, Hunter-gatherers\n\nORCID\n\n0000-0002-8253-6874\n\nResercher ID\n\nH-9315-2015\n\nCLOSE\n\nRisch, Roberto\n\nUniversitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB) ¬∑ Prehist√≤ria\n\nRoberto Risch studied History, Archaeology and Anthropology at the Universities of Freiburg, Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, and Cambridge. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1995 at the UAB. He has been a visiting scholar at numerous institutions including U. di Padova, U. Freiburg and the Max Planck Institute (Jena & Leipzig). His research is mainly concerned with the economy and ecology of Prehistoric societies of the Mediterranean and central Europe during Later Prehistory. He has participated in and coordinated several European projects on environmental and technological changes during Prehistory. Together with Cristina Rihuete, Vicente Lull and Rafael Mic√≥, he is currently one of the co-directors of the \"La Bastida Project\" which has seen excavations at La Bastida and La Almoloya (SE Iberia). In his more than 25 years of experience, he also excavated other sites in Europe and India and has undertaken ethnoarchaeological fieldwork in Western Africa.\n\nResearch interest\n\nMy main scientific activity is focused on the emergence and decline of new forms of political and economic domination during Later Prehistory, following five lines of research:\n\n1. Investigation of disrutpive societies and economies during later Prehistory.\n\n2. The projection of historical questions arising from research on the first state and proto-state societies, seeking to account for observable socioeconomic convergences and divergences in Europe and the Mediterranean.\n\n3. The development of an interdisciplinary methodology for macrolithic tool analysis, as an essential tool towards a better understanding of prehistoric economies.\n\n4. The advance of a general theory of political economy that accounts for the different strategies to produce and circulate economic surplus, as an indispensable element in the rise of social exploitation.\n\n5. The effects of migratory movements and integration mechanisms on social and political change.\n\nKey words\n\nPrehistory, Geoarchaeology, Archaeometallurgy, aDNA, Paleoecology, Paleoeconomy\n\nORCID\n\norcid.org/0000-0001-8534-5806\n\nResercher ID\n\nL-4115-2014\n\nCLOSE\n\nSabat√© Curull, Flocel\n\nUniversitat de Lleida (UdL) ¬∑ Historia\n\nProfessor of Medieval History (s. 2002) at the Universitat de Lleida and Doctor Honoris Causa by the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, (Mendoza, 2014), he served as visiting professor (Cambridge, Concepci√≥n, CONICET-Buenos Aires, ENS-Lyon, JSPS-Tokyo, Lisbon, Paris-1, Poitiers, Tashkent, Yale), and has been member of research trust boards (California, Latvia, Lisbon, Leeds, Nova de Lisboa, Porto, CNRS-Paris, CNR-Rome).
