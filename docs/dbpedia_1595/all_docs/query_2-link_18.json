        "text": "Overview\n\nA total of 42,514 people died in motor vehicle crashes in 2022. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s most recent estimate of the annual economic cost of crashes is $340 billion (Blincoe et al., 2023). Contributing to the death toll are alcohol, speeding, lack of seat belt use and other problematic behaviors. Death rates vary by vehicle type, driver age and sex, and other factors.\n\nIn 1975, the U.S. Department of Transportation started an annual census of motor vehicle deaths, recording information on crash type, vehicle type, road type, driver characteristics and a variety of other factors. Institute researchers analyze these data each year to quantify the public health problem of motor vehicle deaths.\n\nThe following facts are based on analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System.\n\nPosted June 2024.\n\nAge and sex\n\nAt all ages, males had higher per capita crash death rates than females in 2022. Males ages 20 to 29 and those 85 and older had the highest rates of crash deaths, while females ages 12 and younger had the lowest rate.\n\nMotor vehicle crash deaths per 100,000 people by age and
