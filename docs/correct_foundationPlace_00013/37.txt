The Adobe Foundation is a Structure introduced in the Scorched Earth and also available on Ragnarok, Valguero, Crystal Isles, Genesis: Part 2, Lost Island and Fjordur.

Usage

The Adobe Foundation, along with the rest of the Adobe tier, is a strong structure that provides the necessary insulation to survive on Scorched Earth. Adobe and the Tent will provide insulation, while any other material gives an insulation penalty and can make you lose health quickly.

The Adobe Foundation can be placed on even or slightly uneven ground. Once the first Adobe Foundation is placed, subsequent Adobe Foundations can snap into place along the first one, allowing them to line up, provided that there is adequate room and ground to do so.

A foundation provides the structural support to allow the placement of walls, ceilings, and other such objects, but only when the Adobe Foundation is directly underneath them. It also supports up to two ceilings in any direction on the x and y-axis, and up to 1 ceiling diagonally. However, the ceilings on the far end will not support walls.

Notes

Doedicurus is an excellent companion to gather Sand and a Stone Hatchet or Metal Hatchet can easily gather Cactus Sap to build adobe structures. It is recommended that you build in stone or metal around the Adobe, as it is easy to break into.
