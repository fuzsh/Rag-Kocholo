The Mountain View Educational Foundation is a volunteer-driven 501(c)3 that brings essential programs to all 11 Mountain View Whisman School District (MVWSD) schools.

The mission of MVEF is to "work collaboratively with the community to raise funds for programs essential to a well-rounded education for all Mountain View Whisman School District students." MVEF history is closely tied to the history of school funding in California.​

​

If MVEF raises $1,200,000 again during the 2023-24 school year, we can continue to fund our current priorities and plan the addition of new priorities in 2024-25.

​

Most of our funding comes from direct donations by MVWSD families. These programs exist only with your generous support.

2024 Spring Gala recap

On behalf of the Mountain View Educational Foundation (MVEF) we want to thank everyone who contributed to the Gala and made it a great success! The outcome of the Gala far exceeded our expectations! We raised over 25% more than last year (still counting…) The MVEF Board and Executive Directors would like to thank the many generous donors, volunteers, and sponsors who made this year's Gala such a successful event!
