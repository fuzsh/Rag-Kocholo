        "text": "Our 27th annual Thanksgiving Cops & Gobblers traditional food drive is back! Join us Sunday, November 19th at 9am in front of the MV Police & Fire Building at 1000 Villa Street. We will assemble baskets and make a special delivery to families in the community that need a little extra this holiday season.\n\nIf you are unable to make it but want to help, we are still in need of donations to help us serve *600 families* this Thanksgiving. If you’d like to help contribute to the gift cards, please consider making a donation.\n\nThe violence and behavior we have all witnessed is inexcusable and goes against the tremendous work and service of building trust between law enforcement and our diverse communities. The tragic death of George Floyd as well as the aftermath of events have sparked significant and challenging debate for reform.\n\nThe Foundation’s mission remains to support public safety to help make our communities better and safer. We recognize that our local public safety has championed 21st Century Policing in order to provide professional and compassionate service to our diverse community.\n\nMoving forward as we listen and understand the needs of everyone in our community, we are better able to follow our mission and make our communities better.\n\nThrough continued collaboration, partnerships, and education, with community-based organizations and public safety organizations, we focus to find ways to bridge the gap and be a part of the solution.\n\nThe past year we have seen our first responders stretched and community members experiencing significant challenges. MVPSF immediately responded to some of these challenges and in the early months of 2020, we partnered with community organizations to provide Cops & Gobblers Relief and created the First Responder’s Benevolent Fund.\n\nCops & Gobblers Relief\n\nThis program will be providing $50 Safeway gift cards for local families in need.\n\nFirst Responder’s Benevolent Fund\n\nMVPSF will be providing support for local first responders and their families who are affected by COVID-19."
