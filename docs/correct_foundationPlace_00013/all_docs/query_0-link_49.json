        "text": "Unifies Modern Scripting Across Firefox and Flash and Advances Innovation on the Web\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — November 7, 2006 — Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) and the Mozilla Foundation, a public-benefit organization dedicated to promoting choice and innovation on the Internet, today announced that Adobe has contributed source code for the ActionScript™ Virtual Machine, the powerful standards-based scripting language engine in Adobe® Flash® Player, to the Mozilla Foundation. Mozilla will host a new open source project, called Tamarin, to accelerate the development of this standards-based approach for creating rich and engaging Web applications.\n\nThe Tamarin project will implement the final version of the ECMAScript Edition 4 standard language, which Mozilla will use within the next generation of SpiderMonkey, the core JavaScript engine embedded in Firefox®, Mozilla’s free Web browser. As of today, developers working on SpiderMonkey will have access to the Tamarin code in the Mozilla CVS repository via the project page located at www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/. Contributions to the code will be managed by a governing body of developers from both Adobe and Mozilla.\n\n“Adobe’s work on the new virtual machine is the largest contribution to the Mozilla Foundation since its inception,” said Brendan Eich, chief technology officer, Mozilla Corporation, and creator of JavaScript. “Now web developers have a high-performance, open source virtual machine for building and deploying interactive applications across both Adobe Flash Player and the Firefox web browser. We’re excited about joining the Adobe and Mozilla communities to advance ECMAScript.”\n\n“This is a major milestone in bringing together the broader HTML and Flash development communities around a common language, and empowering the creation of even more innovative applications in the Web 2.0 world,” said Kevin Lynch, senior vice president and chief software architect at Adobe. “By working with the open source community we are accelerating the adoption of a standard language for creating and delivering richer, more interactive experiences that work consistently across PCs and mobile devices.”\n\nTamarin implements the ECMAScript standard used by languages such as JavaScript, Adobe ActionScript, and Microsoft JScript, the primary languages developers use for building rich Internet applications. Adobe and Mozilla are both active participants in the ECMA International Programming Language technical committee (TC39-TG1) developing the ECMAScript Edition 4 (ES4) standard.\n\n“There is nothing better for a standard than to have it implemented in multiple products,” said Jan van den Beld, Secretary General, Ecma International. “Adobe is taking a huge step forward in driving standards-based Web development by open source licensing their virtual machine technology.”\n\nAdobe’s most recent virtual machine for ActionScript 3.0, a core component of Adobe Flash Player 9 released in June 2006, was built from the ground up to offer breakthrough performance and features, including more efficient memory utilization, faster application start-times, improved debugging and full runtime error reporting. Adobe Flash Player is installed on over 700 million Internet-connected PCs and mobile devices worldwide. The ActionScript Virtual Machine features a Just In Time (JIT) compiler that translates ActionScript bytecode to native machine code for maximum execution speed. Now developers can leverage existing skills to quickly and easily build complex rich Internet applications increasingly required as users demand more interactive Web experiences.\n\nAbout Mozilla Foundation\n\nEstablished in July 2003, the Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote choice and innovation on the Internet.
