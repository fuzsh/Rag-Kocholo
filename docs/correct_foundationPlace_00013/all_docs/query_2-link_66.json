        "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Adobe Foundation today announced the winners of its second annual Adobe Youth Voices (AYV) Aspire Awards, the only online competition inviting youth around the world to creatively express their vision for change in their communities. More than 1,100 submissions from 51 countries were received, and over 830,000 audience votes were cast for the audience choice awards. Winning entries across the competition’s nine categories address a variety of complex social and environmental topics, such as bullying and climate change; they are featured online at http://youthvoices.adobe.com/awards/.\n\n“The winning projects illustrate the power of creativity and expression among young people, especially when they have access to digital tools that help bring their ideas to life,” said Michelle Yates, director of corporate social responsibility, Adobe and Adobe Foundation executive director. “This program focuses on encouraging youth to develop the creative skills that will help them be more deeply engaged in their education in the short term, and better prepared to succeed long term in a rapidly evolving global economy.”\n\nAYV Award entries were invited in eight standard content categories, representing various storytelling methods including animation, music video, documentary, and photo essay. A ninth category, the UNICEF Challenge, gave entrants the opportunity to develop a video proposal for a project they would implement in their local community. An international panel of professionals working in art, film, and other creative fields selected the first and second place winners in each standard category, while a panel of international UNICEF experts selected the UNICEF Challenge winners.\n\n“Adobe is creating a meaningful opportunity for youth to come together and share digital content that bravely and creatively helps these teens address issues that are important to them,” said Meredith Lavitt, director, Film Forward Initiative, Sundance Institute and 2013 AYV Awards judge. “I’m excited to be involved in an effort that inspires the next generation and sparks a global conversation.”\n\nWinners and affiliated schools/organizations for each standard category receive software, hardware, a trip to attend the 2013 AYV Summit in San Jose, Calif., and a charitable donation to a cause of their choice. The UNICEF Challenge first and second place winners receive $40,000 and $30,000 grants, respectively, dedicated to implementing the winning project proposals. In addition to being showcased on the Aspire Awards website, winning entries from all categories will be featured at distinguished exhibitions, including international film festivals and other arts organization events.\n\n2013 winners are:\n\nAnimation:\n\nFirst Place: Vacant, Dhenzel Obeng, Free the Children, Canada\n\nSecond Place: Nothing is Impossible, Tansy Piar, Bonaire Youth Outreach Foundation, Bonaire\n\nAudience Choice Award: It Makes A Big Difference, Jeanviêr Janga, Bonaire Youth Outreach Foundation, Bonaire\n\nDocumentary:\n\nFirst Place: DREAMS: Un-Deferred, Maymunah Stroud, Whitefoord Community Program, USA\n\nSecond Place: Life's a Fight, Nkengafac Lekealem, Brian Dunn, Kennedi Caldwell, Christian Chadwell, Appalachian Media Institute, USA\n\nAudience Choice Award: Marshall, Angelo Alberto, Bonaire Youth Outreach Foundation, Bonaire\n\nMusic Video:\n\nFirst Place: Polaroids and Films, Luz Campuzano, MACLA, USA\n\nSecond Place: Talking About You, Carlos Eduardo Moreno Bernal, Computer Clubhouse Suba Compartir, Colombia\n\nAudience Choice Award: Together We Can Do Anything, Angelo Francees, Aaron Francees, Daniel Francees, Dustan Mercelina, Bonaire Youth Outreach Foundation, Bonaire\n\nPoster Campaign:\n\nFirst Place: Bullied, Angelo Alberto, Bonaire Youth Outreach Foundation, Bonaire\n\nSecond Place: Infinite MPG, Payton Narancic, Willow Glen High School, USA\n\nAudience Choice Award: Women Empowerment, Lahiru Wanigasekara, Madhudshani Sandya, Medha Herath, Shilpa Sayura Foundation, Sri Lanka\n\nNarrative:\n\nFirst Place: Dear Child, Ismael Mora, Daniel Cordero, Casa de la Juventud Mora, Costa Rica\n\nSecond Place: Silicon, Andrew Elias, Edward Flores, Redwood City Peapod Academy, USA\n\nAudience Choice Award: Life=Smile, Sandro Bernuez, Mateo Pérez Dadone, Julia Kazepis, Magalí Aredes, IPEM 23 LES and Instituto Nuestra Seora de Lourdes, Argentina\n\nPhoto Essay:\n\nFirst Place: Bowing Down to the Earth, Agata Mroczek, Zespół Szkół im.
