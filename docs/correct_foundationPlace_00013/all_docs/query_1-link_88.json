        "text": "C2 helped me learn the importance of time management and instilled in me a greater work ethic that made it possible to do my best in high school. The teachers took the time to break down concepts that I didn’t understand and made sure I understood the mistakes I made before moving on to the next unit. Paying attention to this level of detail in my academic performance made me more confident and ready to conquer standardized testing.\n\nC2 really knows how to tailor their teaching to suit each individual student’s needs and interests. Every time I went to someone at C2 for help, they did their absolute best to give me additional study materials and guidance. It was because of C2 that I was able to score an 800 on both the writing and critical reading sections on the SAT.\n\nC2 really has improved my study habits dramatically, giving me that extra edge to get to a 34 on the ACT and also obtain a 4.4 cumulative GPA. I feel like this academic help ensured that I would have a good chance at getting into colleges. I got into my family’s dream school of the University of California, Berkeley, while becoming a Regents’ and Chancellor’s scholar (top 2 % of incoming class). C2 has taught me in a multitude of ways, and my success is directly tied to them."
