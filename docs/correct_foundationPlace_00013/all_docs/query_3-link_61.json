        "text": "Internal Medicine\n\nOverview\n\nWelcome to the MountainView Regional Medical Center Center internal medicine residency program! Our training program offers a supportive environment where our residents can fulfill their fullest potential as clinicians, educators and leaders with a special focus on physician well-being.\n\nMission and Vision\n\nOur faculty is committed to our residents, keeping in mind their individualized career interests, learning styles and overall goals in medicine. Our purpose is to prepare graduates for today’s challenges in patient care. We provide a structured academic foundation with patient care diversity, subspecialty exposure, and research opportunities. Because of our affiliation with the Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine (BCOM) – located on the New Mexico State University campus – our residents have access to a library, simulation center and research facilities. Residents also work closely with BCOM students while rotating in both the inpatient and outpatient settings and participating in a “Residents as Teachers” curriculum.\n\nResidents interested in osteopathic recognition at graduation have the opportunity to train alongside local experts in the field. MountainView Regional Medical Center is the only IM residency program in the region where residents can achieve such recognition.\n\nCome train in sunny Las Cruces, where you will be considered part of our family. Residents, faculty, and staff pride themselves on maintaining a nurturing environment while maintaining an exceptional educational experience.\n\nCurriculum\n\nCase presentations (formally morning report) are held up to 1.5 hours daily from 12 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. The relaxed environment allows for group discussion of clinical cases with a multidisciplinary approach. Cases are broken down to help learners formulate assessments and plans on complex patients. Subspecialists are invited to add their clinical knowledge to the case.\n\nNoon conferences: Residents receive lectures led by faculty in general internal medicine and its subspecialties. We also have frequent visitors:\n\nTopics in medicine: faculty presentations\n\nMorbidity and mortality conference\n\nJournal club\n\nBoard review sessions from Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program (MKSAP)\n\nWellness lecture series, including monthly fitness challenges\n\n“Rich Doctor Poor Doctor”: financial wellness lecture series for physicians\n\nGrand rounds\n\nSimulation training, including procedural skills workshops\n\nInternal medicine themed Jeopardy\n\nClinical data integrity\n\nBilling and coding\n\nTransitioning to outpatient practice\n\nHospitalist medicine\n\nOsteopathic Recognition\n\nHere at MVRMC, we offer all residents the opportunity to graduate from residency with a certificate in osteopathic recognition (OR). OR is a designation granted to programs through the ACGME Osteopathic Recognition Review Committee. MVRMC's internal medicine residency program was accredited for OR in 2020. We offer a robust curriculum which includes a monthly didactic session where residents attend hands-on workshops and journal clubs as well as inpatient bedside rounds where residents treat patients in both the general ward and critical care settings. If you are interested in continuing and improving your osteopathic skills as a doctor of osteopathic medicine or looking to learn a new skill set as a graduate of an LCME accredited medical school or hold a certification from the ECFMG, MVRMC may be a perfect location for you to become not only an outstanding internal medicine physician, but also one proficient in osteopathic principles and practice.\n\nScholarly Activity\n\nResidents are required to do scholarly activity within three years of training. Examples include poster and podium presentations at local, regional, and national meetings, publications, and IRB approved studies, webinars, and quality improvement initiatives.\n\nCommittees\n\nResidents are required to join at least one committee. Committees include but are not limited to: Ethics, Infectious Disease, Mortality and Morbidity, Patient Safety, Quality Improvement and Sepsis. Here, they discuss, plan and implement actions congruent with learning objectives and character building throughout the three years of residency.\n\nFormal Mentor Program\n\nResidents will regularly meet with a program assigned faculty advisor who will offer objective feedback, discuss rotation evaluations and provide a clear path to success based on the resident’s career goals.\n\nResidents\n\nInternal Medicine Residents PGY-1\n\nAnanya Cingireddy, M.D.\n\nMedical School: Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences, India\n\nAhmed Hasson, M.D.\n\nMedical School: Spartan Health Sciences University, Saint Lucia\n\nStuart Hepworth, D.O.\n\nMedical School: Midwestern University, Glendale, Arizona\n\nSamuel Huseman, M.D.\n\nMedical School: Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso, Texas\n\nPretty “Sara” Idiculla, M.D.\n\nMedical School: Sree Gokulam Medical College, India\n\nZachary Lang, D.O.\n\nMedical School: Midwestern University, Glendale, Arizona\n\nChau Nguyen Gonzalez, D.O.\n\nMedical School: Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine, Las Cruces, New Mexico\n\nAshraf Rjob, M.D.\n\nMedical School: Cairo University Faculty of Medicine, Jordan\n\nAditi Roy, D.O.\n\nMedical School: Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York\n\nInternal Medicine Residents PGY-2\n\nHebah Alrahamneh, M.D.\n\nMedical School: Hashemite University Faculty of Medicine, Jordan\n\nAuria Chowdhury, MBBS (M.D.)\n\nMedical School: Chittagong Medical College, Bangladesh, India\n\nHayden Collins, D.O.\n\nMedical School: Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Rocky Vista, CO\n\nGiselle Irio, D.O.\n\nMedical School: Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine, Las Cruces, New Mexico\n\nM.
