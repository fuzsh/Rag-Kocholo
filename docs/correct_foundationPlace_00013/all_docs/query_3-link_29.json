        "text": "Wayfinding from the entry to the nearly 33 clinical departments is a series of straight-forward binary choices . . . up or down, left or right. Eliminating patient frustration and reducing stress informed the site planning from the parking garage design to the entry and on to the clinical departments. Adding in Art, ample natural light, and access to mountain views leads to a positive patient experience.\n\nThis project illustrates our core belief that a positive patient experience likely leads to more frequent visits, earlier detection of health issues, and less invasive medical solutions. So while the sculpture and the tree do participate in keeping care costs low and healing high, the HPS integrated project delivery approach shaved 6 months off the construction schedule and saved approximately $9 million."
