        "text": "WRT was engaged in master planning a 40 acre technology district to accommodate the future growth needs of this international company. A sustainable ethos guided the development program. Working closely with the project architect, WRNS Studio and local landscape architect, ArcSitio, WRT served as lead landscape architect for Adobe’s LEED Silver Campus in Metro Salt Lake City. The design team’s collective objectives were to create a new identity for Adobe’s Utah-based team, to support an engaging and energetic workplace through the creation of outdoor gathering and recreational spaces, and to create a highly sustainable native landscape. Buildings are oriented to direct views to nearby mountain peaks and for optimal natural lighting. Outdoor spaces further frame these mountain vistas while providing programmed recreational areas for employees with special provisions for natural habitat creation. Stormwater from parking areas and streets is collected in planted swales to filter pollutants and recharge aquifers. All-season promenades connect to nearby transit opportunities. For cyclists, storage areas and showers are also provided."
