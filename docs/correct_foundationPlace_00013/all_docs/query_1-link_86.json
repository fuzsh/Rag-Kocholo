Currently, the Bay Area OWASP Chapter covers this whole geographic region.\n\nNotes about OWASP presentations\n\nOWASP presentations are geared for a technical audience. We are particularly interested in new approaches to tackling application security problems, defensive techniques for new technology in the application security space and lessons learned from developers and security professionals tackling application security. Please consider a wide breadth of topic areas and we can discuss if they should be tailored in a particular direction for the OWASP audience.\n\nOWASP chapter presentations must not be sales pitches and must adhere to a vendor neutral approach to the topic.\n\nChapter Meetings\n\nOWASP Bay Area Meetup - All events can be found here\n\nAbout Presentation Events\n\nPresentation events will feature 1 or more speakers discussing application security. These events will include a networking session, with drinks and food, before and after the event.\n\nAbout OWASP Social Hours\n\nThe purpose of the OWASP social gathering is:\n\nInformal security chat - the benefits of “hallway con” and security talk with others in the industry\n\nNetworking - meet other people in the field and industry\n\nAfter work drinks - a nice break after a long work day\n\nNote: These events won’t have any formal presentations. They’re meant to be social gatherings to meet others in the industry and chat about security. Check our quarterly OWASP Bay Area schedule for the security presentation events. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bay_Area\n\nIs your organization interested in hosting an OWASP social hour in the bay area (San Francisco, South Bay, East Bay)?
