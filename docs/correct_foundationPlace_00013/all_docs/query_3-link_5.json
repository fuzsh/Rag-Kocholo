These programs exist only with your generous support.\n\n​\n\nGet Involved!\n\n2024 Spring Gala recap\n\nOn behalf of the Mountain View Educational Foundation (MVEF) we want to thank everyone who contributed to the Gala and made it a great success! The outcome of the Gala far exceeded our expectations! We raised over 25% more than last year (still counting…) The MVEF Board and Executive Directors would like to thank the many generous donors, volunteers, and sponsors who made this year's Gala such a successful event!\n\n​"
