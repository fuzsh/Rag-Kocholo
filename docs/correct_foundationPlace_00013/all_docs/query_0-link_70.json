        "text": "These days, generous benefits packages are often a key motivation behind why employees apply for specific roles. Naturally, perks that go some way to alleviating the economic difficulties many workers are currently experiencing, such as childcare support and health insurance, are among the most appealing.\n\nA recent study from MetLife found that workers are 60% more likely to remain at a company that they feel supports them. With that in mind, we’ve looked into the benefits, perks, and other forms of support offered by tech companies from around the world to find the companies that actually have the best employee packages.\n\nThere’s a reason tech businesses are often considered to be the best companies to work for. Check out the companies below to see what employees are raving about most, and get your résumé ready if you’re interested in the perks of the business. Before we get into the companies offering the best perks on the market, here are some employee benefits statistics to know:\n\n40% of employers say workers leave jobs to find roles offering better employee benefits (Forbes Advisor)\n\n19% of Gen Z think companies should have mental health benefits (TeamStage.io)\n\n83% of employers have changed their benefits strategy within the last three years (Empyrean)\n\n68% of employers believe health care to be the most important employee benefit (Forbes Advisor)\n\nThe Importance of Employee Benefits and Perks\n\nWhy are these companies giving away so many perks and benefits, far beyond the expected rewards of salary and basic legal requirements? Because it makes business sense – and even more so given rising inflation.\n\nWith around 40% of professionals leaving their posts or searching for workplaces that offer better benefits, perks, benefits, and general flexibility have taken on renewed importance, especially as a metric to decide between companies offering similar salaries.\n\nInvesting in your employees, and showing them you care about their happiness and well-being is the best way to manage and boost employee performance – and make remote workers feel appreciated. If you treat your staff as the valuable asset that they are, in return, they will put more effort into their work and be more loyal to the business out of genuine affection and respect. This is a sustainable way to ensure staff work hard.\n\nThis increase in productivity and employee retention will pay off in higher profits as well as company leaders feeling rewarded by the good karma and stronger relationships at work. You’ll also be able to recruit talented employees more easily, as the best workers will want to work for the most rewarding business.\n\nThe twenty companies below all understand this, making them great places to work and more successful businesses because of it.\n\nDay-to-Day Employee Performance\n\nOnce you’ve laid the foundation for happy, motivated employees, how do you encourage their performance and allow for personal growth on a daily and weekly basis?\n\nPerformance management software, like Betterworks, can help bring out the full potential of each employee, through clear structure and data-driven progress tracking. It’s really useful software for the finer details of productivity, allowing employees and managers alike to understand what works and what doesn’t.\n\nIf you’re interested in performance management software for your company, we can help! With Tech.co, you’ll be able to find the right software for you at the right price thanks to our in-depth research.\n\n1. Adobe Employee Benefits and Perks (San Jose, CA)\n\nEducation\n\nFamily care\n\nSocial Good\n\nGenerous does not even begin to describe the perks and benefits packages at Adobe. Sure, other companies provide things like commuter programs and retail discounts, but this company goes a little bit further. From educational grants to commuter packages, this company is providing its employees with a bevy of perks that can seriously make a difference in retaining top talent.\n\nAdobe has launched a Disaster and Epidemic Time Off Policy, which expands upon the existing Covid-19 Time Off policy and stipulates that you can take up to 20 days off a year if you’re caring for family members, or experiencing vaccine side effects – and this policy also applies to anyone experiencing difficulties with Ukraine.\n\nEducation\n\nFirst off, Adobe offers employees $10,000 per year “for tuition and books for courses, certificate programs and graduate programs that meet the program’s eligibility criteria,” according to their website. Additionally, the company allows employees to set aside pre-tax savings for their children’s college education, as well as access to college admissions and financial aid officers to make the process a little easier on their employees.\n\nFamily Care\n\nSpeaking of children, Adobe understands the importance of family, which is why they also allow employees to set aside up to $5,000 pre-tax per year for child daycare expenses. They even let employees use it for elder care, in the event of an older family member needing assistance. Adobe will even chip in up to $1,200 per year to assist with the childcare expenses for children up to 13 years old.\n\nSocial Good\n\nDoing something good for the world is always a good move, which is why Adobe is so committed to helping employees do just that. The San Jose-based company will match all donations and volunteer time up to $10,000 per year.\n\n2. Airbnb Employee Benefits and Perks (San Francisco, CA)\n\nTime off\n\nHealth benefits\n\nVolunteering\n\nYes, free snacks and flexible schedules are part of Airbnb’s amazing perks and benefits for all the employees that call it home, but there really is so much more – including the fact employees can now live and work absolutely anywhere they want.\n\nThe way Airbnb dealt with forced redundancies (25% of their workforce) due to the pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic was exemplary too – and how companies deal with employees they’re letting go says a lot about a company’s culture. The CEO wrote a letter to employees about the decision process and created an alumni talent directory, as well as redeploying Airbnb’s recruiters to help employees find new jobs.\n\nTime Off\n\nAirbnb employees are given the flexible option to work from home when necessary, but that’s become pretty standard in the business world today. However, what isn’t standard is a full two-week vacation during the holiday months, in addition to other paid vacation days and annual travel credits.\n\nThe company says it offers a “quarterly Airbnb travel and experiences credit” as well. Plus, Airbnb provides 10 weeks of paternity leave and even more for maternity leave. Not too bad for a company based in one of the few developed countries in the world without mandatory programs in place for that kind of thing.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\nOf course, having some kind of health benefits package has been a necessity for companies for decades. However, many skimp on the coverage, leading to a lot of paying out of pocket; but not Airbnb. They provide incredible comprehensive packages for health, vision, dental, and everything in between with no out-of-pocket expenses for employees, and only 25 percent for dependents.\n\nVolunteering\n\nThere will likely be a few companies on this list that match donations and volunteer time with their dollars. However, Airbnb provides their employees with paid volunteer time to get out and make a difference in their community. Plus, they support the initiative so you can find the best place to volunteer.\n\n3. Apple Employee Benefits and Perks (Cupertino, CA)\n\nDiscounted Devices\n\nMaternity & paternity leave\n\nCelebrities\n\nWhile simply being around all those iPhones and Macbooks would be enough to make any employee drool, Apple does so much more for their employees when it comes to perks and benefits. But with a current market cap of $3.51 trillion, they better be!\n\nIn light of post-pandemic labor shortages, Apple has upped its benefits for its retail workers, including doubling paid sick days for full-time and part-time employees, more annual vacation days, and introducing six-week paternity leave.\n\nDiscounted Devices\n\nWhile just a few years ago iPhones and Macbooks were a luxury, they’ve become a necessity in the world today. Giving employees a 25 percent discount on these items (well, one discount per year) shakes out to quite a hefty sum, particularly around the holidays. Plus, after working there for three years, you can get iPhones discounted $250 and Macbooks discounted $500. Not too shabby.\n\nMaternity & Paternity Leave\n\nMuch like Adobe, Apple offers generous maternity and paternity packages, with 16 total weeks for mothers (although this is down from its 18-week maternity leave a year ago) and six weeks for fathers.\n\nAdditionally, the company has added a four-week transition period, which will allow workers to get full-time pay while working part-time after leave is over. Apple will even pay if you’re interested in having your eggs frozen to start a family sometime in the future. Now that’s a new one.\n\nCelebrities\n\nEvery company has social events that involve free drinks, tasty appetizers, and even some live music. However, like most things in the company’s culture, Apple goes all out with these events, hiring some of the biggest names in music to perform, including Stevie Wonder, Demi Lovato, and many more.\n\n4. Atlassian Inc. (San Francisco, CA)\n\nEmployee support\n\nAmple benefits\n\nBalancing Work & Life\n\nAtlassian is a software company originally from Australia, and perhaps best known for its flagship project management software Jira (which is now over two decades old), and corporate wiki program called Confluence – and the benefits they provide for employees are vast and varied.\n\nEmployee Support\n\nAtlassian provides a lot of different types of employee support, including personalized care plans to maintain and improve mental health – and it’s a good thing too, considering 92% of recent graduates think companies should have mental health benefits. Ample educational resources including an annual learning budget, over 7,000 online courses, and a business book portal are also provided. Atlassian won’t discriminate against employees who work from home either and will provide financial support for anyone who feels like they need extra resources to make their remote working environment suitable to their needs. The company’s partnership with Bright Horizons Childcare, further, means staff can get backup care for their children.\n\nAmple Benefits\n\nAtlassian offers employees health and life insurance and pays 100% of the monthly premiums for employees and eligible dependents. Their 401(k) will allow you to save and invest as part of your income, and Atlassian even offers flexible spending and health saving accounts so employees can compile pre-tax funds.\n\nBalancing Work & Life\n\nAtlassian has an employee assistance plan – which includes counseling and parenting resources – and these are available for not just employees, but members of their households too.\n\nThere’s also an annual fund for fitness and wellness reimbursements designed to ensure employees are leading a healthy and active lifestyle, and Atlassian will even pay you to volunteer at a charity!\n\n5. Cisco Employee Benefits and Perks (San Jose, CA)\n\nSocial Events\n\nBirthdays\n\nSupport\n\nSetting up shop in the Bay Area is no easy feat for startups these days. But when you’re one of the biggest companies in the area, spending on your employees kind of comes with the deal. Fortunately, Cisco does not disappoint.\n\nDuring Covid, Cisco employees were surveyed about their workplace experience and used this feedback to better the workplace for them – members of the senior leadership team also ran ‘check-in’ sessions (some lasting 75 minutes) to address questions.\n\nSocial Events\n\nDesignated mixers and social events are a big part of a lot of companies’ perk packages. But at Cisco, each department is given its own budget to do with what they please. Whether you go out to a bar nearby or do battle at the local laser tag arena, it’s up to you (and the rest of your department).\n\nBirthdays\n\nStarbucks and Cisco have something in common: they want to make sure you’re celebrating your birthday right. But at Cisco, you don’t get a free cup of coffee; you get one full day off, to take at any point within 10 days of your actual birthday. Never work on your birthday again, the way it was meant to be.\n\nIf you’re feeling a little bit self-centered after a day of celebrating your existence, you’ve got ten volunteering days throughout the year to give back – and Cisco will pay you to do it! They used to only pay for five days a year, but increased the number to ten back in 2022.\n\nSupport\n\nPaid perks and benefits are always nice. However, studies have shown that a little positive reinforcement goes a long way, which is probably why Cisco has a dedicated recognition platform that allows employees to call out others for going above and beyond for the company. And they come with prizes!\n\nThere’s also reimbursement available for lab fees and books for courses at universities and other accredited educational institutions. There’s also support for parents regarding paternity, maternity, and adoption leave.\n\n6. Facebook Employee Benefits and Perks (Menlo Park, CA)\n\nFamily planning\n\nVacation\n\nHeaven in Menlo Park\n\nAs one of the most powerful tech companies in the world, you know Facebook & parent company Meta isn’t going to disappoint when it comes to perks and benefits. They exemplify the new business model and their packages do a lot to prove that.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, Facebook pledged to give every employee an extra $1,000 to help them through it. However, it’s worth noting that while it had an initially generous remote work policy, it has since backtracked on this.\n\nFamily Planning\n\nThis perk has made the list a few times, and you might think it’s getting old. However, Facebook’s plan is above and beyond, providing four months of parental leave for mothers and fathers within the first year of the birth or adoption. Additionally, they provide up to $4,000 in “baby cash” for new parents, along with reimbursement for egg-freezing and adoption fees.\n\nVacation\n\nVacation time in the U.S. has become notably less important to most companies. But at Meta, employees get to enjoy four weeks of paid vacation per year, up from three weeks a few years ago. Full-time employees will get an extra 30 days to take in a row after they pass the five-year mark, too.\n\nHeaven in Menlo Park\n\nThe company’s headquarters in Menlo Park is a veritable heaven of perks and benefits. From a full arcade and barbershop to valet parking, employees are treated like royalty as long as they’re in Menlo Park. However, things aren’t quite as good as they used to be. Some perks, such as laundry and dry cleaning, have been removed, and there are more stringent restrictions on free meals.\n\n8. HubSpot Employee Benefits and Perks (Cambridge, MA)\n\nVacation\n\nParental Leave\n\n401K\n\nAs Boston becomes one of the major tech hubs of the country, it’s no wonder why they’ve begun to embrace the perks and benefits mentality of the industry. Back in 2020, Hubspot pledged to make 70% of advertised jobs location-agnostic by 2021. Today, a little under half of its posted jobs are remote, but maybe that’s down from 2021? They’re trying.\n\nHubspot has its own mental health resource center, called HubCare, which has clinicians available for contact via phone, email or video chat.\n\nVacation\n\nYou’ve probably heard the phrase before and get confused whenever you do: unlimited vacation. HubSpot aims to take the stress and the need to ask permission out of taking some time off, insisting employees simply “use good judgement” when it comes to taking vacation time. And there’s no waiting period! Employees get to enjoy unlimited vacation from day one.\n\nParental Leave\n\nThis perk keeps making it on the list and that’s because it’s important! With so few companies offering something reasonable, the companies that do really stand out. HubSpot is one of those companies, with three months of leave for mothers and one month of leave for fathers.\n\n401K\n\nAgain, this is another common perk within the list, but HubSpot shines above the rest. By matching employee contributions at 12 percent, they are truly making a statement that their employees’ future is just as important as theirs.\n\n10. Intel Corporation Employee Benefits and Perks (Portland, OR)\n\nCareer advancement\n\nSmall perks\n\nHealthy living\n\nAs one of the few companies outside of tech hubs on this list, Intel boasts some of the most impressive tech and one of the longer runs. This explains why they’re willing to spend so much on employees: they care!\n\nAs the skills shortage exacerbated the scarcity of top talent, Intel didn’t just hope for the best – they increased employee compensation by over $2 billion ($1 billion in pay and $1.4 billion in stock compensation) to keep dedicated staff on their books. They also surveyed all their employees about which working arrangements suited them best, and after 90% said they wanted a hybrid working arrangement, “hybrid-first” became company policy.\n\nCareer Advancement\n\nAs one of the leading technology companies out there, Intel knows the value of improving the knowledge of its employees. That’s why, according to their website, they offer career advisors, mentors, networking events, workshops, tuition assistance, certifications, and internal development opportunities for everyone at the company.\n\nSmall Perks\n\nThey always say that it’s the little things that make the difference at a big company, which is true when you consider that Intel provides employees with a bevy of on-site conveniences, ticket giveaways for local sporting/cultural events, travel perks, discounted shopping programs, and much more.\n\nHealthy Living\n\nTrying to be healthy shouldn’t be a full-time job; you’ve already got one of those. That’s why Intel provides innovative health coverage, onsite health and fitness centers, wellness programs, nutritious food options, and local community events that support a healthy lifestyle for all employees.\n\n11. Intuit Employee Benefits and Perks (Mountain View, CA)\n\nPet insurance\n\nEntertainment\n\nFamily planning\n\nWhile you might think a company that deals in nickels and dimes (quite a lot of them, in fact) would always be watching its bottom line, Intuit knows that taking care of its employees is the most effective way to succeed as a company.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Inuit “instituted a temporary time-off benefit for all employees that augments regular leave policies should they need additional time to care for family members impacted by school closures or for times they cannot perform their job remotely during the work-from-home period” and provided numerous working-from-home resources to help employees lead virtual teams successfully, keep kids engaged and stay mentally and physically fit.\n\nThere’s also a wealth of mental health and medical services for Intuit employees, such as the Employee Assistance Program – which can help staff develop resilience and manage stress better, as well as deal with emotional issues like grief, anxiety, depression, or substance use issues.\n\nPlus, tuition assistance is offered to workers for up to $5,250 per calendar year or $2,625 for part-timers.\n\nPet Insurance\n\nNo one is going to perform well at work when they’re worried about their furry little friend back home. That’s why Intuit makes sure to cover pets as well as dependents so you can have peace of mind for your puppy.\n\nEntertainment\n\nThere’s nothing better than a little fun thanks to work, which is why Intuit provides the opportunity to enjoy a wide range of entertainment options. Examples include movie tickets, broadway show tickets, tickets for theme parks such as Knott’s Berry Farm, Universal Orlando Resort, Six Flags Adventure, Wild Safari, E-tickets for LEGOLAND, Six Flags, and even SeaWorld.\n\nFamily Planning\n\nWhile some companies feel burdened by employees building a family, Intuit takes care of their own by providing thorough benefits for new children. From parental leave and adoption reimbursement programs to backup day care centers and Well Minds life guidance class, you’ll be ready to start a new family, no problem.\n\n12. LinkedIn Employee Benefits and Perks (Mountain View, CA)\n\nHolidays & family support\n\nFinances\n\nFitness\n\nRetaining talent is hard, and no one knows that more than LinkedIn. As perhaps the most recognizable job-searching platform in the world, LinkedIn wants to keep its employees more than anyone else, which is why it offers such great benefits.\n\nLinkedIn has lots of useful employee initiatives such as InDay which, as the company states, means you can set aside one Friday every month to focus on “yourself, our company, or the world.” It also pioneered several COVID-specific initiatives like LiftUp, a resource platform and event series created in the name of global company well-being.\n\nHolidays & Family Support\n\nFolks, I think we have a winner. In addition to the generous vacation time, LinkedIn recognizes 17 national holidays, giving employees plenty of time off to spend with their families for any number of important holidays.\n\nIn addition to this, LinkedIn provides a wealth of support services for employees who have fallen on hard times or are going through major life events. There’s fertility and adoption assistance, childcare, eldercare, and pet care subsidy, as well as paid parental leave and survivor support.\n\nFinances\n\nPaying a hefty salary is one thing. But if your employees don’t know how to handle their cash, what’s the point? That’s why LinkedIn provides employees with financial classes that can help them set budgets and invest.\n\nFitness\n\nOn-site gyms are nice, but they often lack the machines you want or the convenience you need. Fortunately, LinkedIn provides employees with a $2,000 “Perk Up” bonus that can go towards fitness classes, massages, and even child care.\n\n13. Microsoft Employee Benefits and Perks (Redmond, WA)\n\nEducation\n\nSports\n\nCar chargers\n\nWhen your founder is one of the richest men in the world (depending on what Jeff Bezos is up to that day), you know that you’re going to get some awesome perks. Microsoft delivers on this promise with a few pretty great benefits for their employees.\n\nMany companies recognized during the pandemic that benefits and perks can only go so far – financial support is what a lot of staff really needed. That’s why Microsoft gave all employees a one-time monetary gift of $1,500 in the summer of 2021. Microsoft has and continues to offer flexible working schedules for staff, subsidized and discounted childcare, and backup care for children, adults, and elderly members of employees’ families.\n\nEducation\n\nImproving your career is easy for employees, thanks to Microsoft. In addition to “tuition and textbook reimbursement for approved work-related courses, they offer amazing internal resources such as technical, management and professional development classes, a visiting speaker series, TechFest and even their own library,” according to their website.\n\nSports\n\nProviding on-site gyms and exercise stipends is one thing, but sometimes you just want to go outside and have some fun. In a unique move, Microsoft allows employees to check out footballs, basketballs, bocce balls, and even bicycles for anything during the day.\n\nCar Chargers\n\nGoing green can be hard when your employer isn’t on board. But Microsoft is so green that they provide employees with electric car chargers so that they won’t have to rush home to get a jump.\n\n14. Netflix Employee Benefits and Perks (Los Gatos, CA)\n\nMaternity & paternity leave\n\nOn-site theater\n\nFree lunch\n\nAs one of the most successful, paradigm-shifting companies of the 21st century, you better believe Netflix takes care of its employees. The streaming giant provides a comparatively impressive level of flexibility for employees, as well as a stellar perks and benefits package that stands on its own.\n\nMaternity & Paternity Leave\n\nDespite being based in one of the few countries that doesn’t provide maternity or paternity leave to citizens, Netflix has one of the most robust plans in the world. The streaming company offers a full year of maternity and paternity leave for employees, and even offered an unlimited option a few years ago, before opting to change to a year.\n\nOn-Site Theater\n\nWhen you’re creating some of the most-watched movies and television shows, it’s safe to say your employees deserve a taste. Fortunately, the company agrees, which is why it built a 200-seat movie theater in its Los Gatos office so that employees can watch Netflix movies and television shows on the big screen.\n\nFree Lunch\n\nIt may seem like a trivial addition to such a stellar perks package, but you can never underestimate the value of a good lunch, which is why Netflix offers them to their employee free of charge. Plus, with plenty of free snacks on site, you could save a bundle on meals while enjoying a healthy diet.\n\n17. Spotify Employee Benefits and Perks (New York, NY)\n\nMusic focused culture\n\nMaternity & paternity leave\n\nFree lunch\n\nSpotify is one of the largest music-streaming companies in the world, and they take that role seriously by providing a truly impressive set of benefits and perks to their employees. And with unfettered access to the world of music, those perks can be pretty cool.\n\nBut aside from exciting, music-based opportunities, there’s an employee assistance program and a self-care hub, and extensive learning opportunities available through GreenHouse, the company’s dedicated team for such. As Covid continued into 2021, Spotify was quick to get with the times and instate a work from anywhere policy, giving employees complete freedom over where they complete their work.\n\nMusic-Focused Culture\n\nAs you might imagine, the music-focused culture of Spotify is substantial. From employee jam sessions to epic concerts, the music streaming giant makes music a big part of the back end of the company in addition to the front end. Conference rooms are even named after famous music venues to drive the message home even further – although you’ll also get the opportunity to visit real music venues, festivals and events as a staff member.\n\nMaternity & Paternity Leave\n\nWhile it’s not as robust as Netflix’s year-long option, Spotify still offers a decidedly impressive six months off for maternity and paternity leave for parents to get a good footing before coming back to work. The company even offers to pay for fertility treatment, like egg-freezing, so that employees won’t incur those additional costs.\n\nFree Lunch\n\nSeriously, who doesn’t love a free lunch? Granted, a large chunk of the tech industry subscribes to the use of this perk to keep employees happy. Still, Spotify takes that trend to heart by offering free lunches daily, as well as an array of snacks to keep employees fat and happy!\n\n18. Square Employee Benefits and Perks (San Francisco, CA)\n\nMeals\n\nPaternal leave\n\nOn-site amenities\n\nThis up-and-coming company didn’t get to where it is today by treating its employees poorly, that’s for sure. Square has made a name for itself with its innovative technology and its commitment to retaining quality talent at its organization.\n\nSquare dealt with the shift to remote working quite well and provided a number of resources for employees with tips on how to homeschool kids and deal with increased levels of self-isolation brought about by the pandemic.\n\nMeals\n\nYes, some companies offer the occasional catered lunch or even a social event out on the town. But at Square, employees have historically been able to take advantage of free, freshly made meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nWhile we couldn’t verify whether Square still offers this perk, they do state on their website that “some meals” are provided to employees working in their offices.\n\nParental Leave\n\nSquare sets itself apart from other companies when it comes to parental leave by offering the same for mothers and fathers. Plus with up to three to four months off, any family will be prepared to take on the world.\n\nOn-Site Amenities\n\nWorking in the Square office is obviously nice because of the free food, but it goes so far beyond that. They also have on-site chiropractic, acupuncture, and massage specialists, along with yoga and meditation classes."
