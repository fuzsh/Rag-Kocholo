        "text": "About Mountain View Elementary School\n\nMountain View School is a public elementary school established in 1966 as part of the Goleta Union School District. With approximately 350 students in grades K-6, the school has a history of exemplary student performance and is regularly ranked as one of the highest achieving schools in Santa Barbara County. Outstanding test scores earned Mountain View a rating of #1 in Santa Barbara County in 2013, and it was awarded a “California Distinguished Schools” recognition that same year.\n\nWhat is the MVS Foundation?\n\nThe Mountain View School Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit supporting public education at Mountain View School.\n\nThe Foundation is dedicated to raising funds from sources other than school families. With the support of neighbors, former parents, local business and grants from public and private foundations, we have completed the Multi-Purpose room project, helped with the creation of a STEAM lab, and purchased a new class set of MacBook Air laptops. See our project tab for more detailed information on current and past projects.\n\nAnother goal of the Foundation is to establish an endowment that will help fund the School’s needs into the future. The Foundation currently has an endowment of $10,750 for this purpose. All professional services and most costs relating to the organization, tax exemption, and ongoing operations of the Foundation have been donated, so that 99% of the funds we raise will be spent for the school and not for overhead.\n\nWe encourage Mountain View families to contact us with questions and suggestions.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nWhy is the MVS Foundation Needed?\n\nDon’t our tax dollars pay for MVS education?\n\nYes, in large part. California public education is funded primarily by State tax dollars. The breakdown of sources is shown here:\n\nTotal spending per pupil fluctuates over time, but even with recent increases in per pupil spending, California ranks almost 13% below the average level of spending in the rest of the nation. In addition, district direct costs are rising faster than state spending for many reasons but including a requirement that districts fund an increasing percent of pension contributions. In 2013, school districts were required to pay 8% of their teacher payrolls for pensions; by 2020, that contribution will rise to 19%. We can continue to expect the district budgets to remain tight."
