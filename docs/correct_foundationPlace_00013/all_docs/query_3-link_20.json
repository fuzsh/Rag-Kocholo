        "text": "Ameswell Mountain View reimages two former underutilized parcels of land—one a service yard for the City of Mountain View, the other an abandoned Caltrans off-ramp—into a thriving neighborhood with world-class work environments and unparalleled lodging and dining experiences. Flanked by I-85, I-101, and Moffett Boulevard, the development reaches out to the neighboring community and connects to the adjacent Stevens Creek trail which is utilized by the public for recreation and bicycle commuting. Organized around a major new landscaped public lawn, the Moffett Development includes the Ameswell Mountain View office building, The Ameswell Hotel, and an 822-stall parking structure. The new development takes cues from Mountain View’s Precise Plan, manifesting its ideals of returning to nature and providing a better future for the City’s inhabitants with landscape and campus-planning strategies that offer public amenities and rebuild riparian habitat.\n\nSupporting a thriving live-work community, Ameswell Mountain View provides the convenient amenities and communal spaces desired by businesses, travelers, and local residents alike. Running parallel to Stevens Creek, the Ameswell Mountain office building features a roof deck and outdoor courtyard carefully tuned to be desirable to tech companies. Ameswell Mountain View office building has been entirely leased by Google. The 255 guestroom Ameswell Hotel fills the northeast corner of the development site and serves as a memorable gateway along the freeway into the City of Mountain View. The five-story hotel provides guests with significant views in most directions including to the nearby historic Moffett Airfield and the internal public lawn and courtyard. The hotel includes meeting rooms, a restaurant, a bar, and an outdoor pool that are just as much an amenity to the hotel guests as nearby office workers. WRNS Studio served as the design architect for the Ameswell Hotel project.\n\nThis highly visible development responds to its surrounding well-trafficked corridors with animated facades that serve as the building’s public face. Each structure uses varying materials in a complementary, natural palette. The Amswell Hotel uses plaster with a wood-grain printed porcelain panel accents with more vigorous patterning facing the freeway and a quieter courtyard façade that is capped with textured, stained zinc. The office building reflects this patterning with GFRC and glass. The façade that faces the interior courtyard is primarily glass with wood accents, allowing for natural daylight and a workplace that clearly connects with nature. Adjacent to the office, the parking structure is clad in a corten steel mesh and metal panels.\n\nAmeswell Mountain View is certified LEED Platinum. Photovoltaic panels on the roofs provide a means to reduce the consumption of resources for building operation. The heavily wooded site will be repopulated with over 350 California native species like Redbuds, Oaks, and California Buckeyes that support wildlife. This reinvigorated habitat will be open to the public with bike paths and access to the adjacent Stevens Creek as well as a large public courtyard where visitors can take in views of the tree canopy and the interior building facades that react to it."
