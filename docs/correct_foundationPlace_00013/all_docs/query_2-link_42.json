        "text": "When using Adobe Creative Cloud software products (such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, etc.), you will be prompted to follow a particular logon sequence that uses your email address and your Los Rios W+ID for authentication.\n\nPlease following these steps when signing in to Adobe:\n\nStart signing in to Adobe Creative Cloud using your email address (example: dubinen@flc.losrios.edu)\n\nTab or move your mouse to the password field. A new popup will appear prompting you to choose an account. You will want to choose the Enterprise ID option.\n\n3. After choosing the Enterprise ID account, you will be redirected to a Los Rios Single Sign-On (SSO) page. Enter your W+ID and password, and then click Login.\n\nYou will now be able to use the Adobe product. This same sign-in process will apply to using Adobe Creative Cloud products at home.\n\nTechnical assistance from Folsom Lake College is limited since the Adobe Work at Home software resides on personal machines that are not owned or managed by the College. The Los Rios IT Support HelpDesk will not be able to assist with training, application support, or the installation of the Work-at-Home products on your personal device.\n\nListed below are several free support options available to you:\n\nCreative Cloud Help Center and tutorial videos are available\n\nThe Adobe User Forums are also a great resource\n\nIf you experience any issues with product serial numbers, please call Adobe at 1 (800) 833-6687. To avoid potential hold times, you may request a call back."
