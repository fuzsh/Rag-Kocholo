        "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Adobe Foundation today announced the winners of the third annual Adobe Youth Voices (AYV) Awards, a global, online competition inviting students ages 13-19 to use digital media to express their vision for driving positive change in their communities. A record 2,400 students from 50 countries submitted projects this year on social issues including: bullying, body image, and climate change. First and second place winners were chosen by a luminary panel of judges, while Audience Award winners were determined by 200,000 votes cast online.\n\n“Since its inception, AYV has impacted the lives of more than 190,000 students around the world. It’s empowered them to make a difference in their communities, and build the digital media making skills that will help them get ahead,” said Michelle Crozier Yates, director, corporate responsibility, Adobe. “With what they’ve learned, 88% of AYV youth tell us they feel confident about their ability to ideate, collaborate, adapt and express their point of view. 95% believe creativity is important to their future success. We look forward to making the AYV program even more globally accessible.”\n\nAYV Award winners are chosen in seven categories: animation, documentary, photo essay, music video, narrative, poetry and campaign poster. Youth can submit projects individually or as teams working with an AYV educator. First and second place winners are named in each of the seven categories by a diverse panel of judges, including luminaries working in art, film, and other creative fields, alongside AYV educators, student alumni, and Adobe representatives.\n\n“Everyone today has the tools to express themselves. This combination of digital tools and self-expression is very empowering and can create powerful change. I am honored to be an AYV judge and to have the opportunity to support these young media makers,” said Patrick Coyne, editor and designer of Communication Arts magazine and AYV 2014 judge.\n\nThe public determines an Audience Award winner in each category by voting for their favorite projects online.
