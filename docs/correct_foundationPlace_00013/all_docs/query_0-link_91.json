        "text": "North Carolina must increase its crisis response capacity for long-term success, according to a new report by the mental-health policy group Inseparable. The report analyzes 988 crisis lifeline responses in every state and proposes improvements.\n\nOne key area it says requires attention in North Carolina is the need for more crisis-response mobile units and beds. Kelly Crosbie, director of the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, acknowledged this challenge and said funding from the General Assembly is addressing the need.\n\n\"So, now we have 19 'urgent cares' opening across the state,\" she said. \"In the community crisis center space, we've added about 64 new beds for adults and 44 new beds for children.\"\n\nThe report shows an 81% call capacity rate, with a recommended goal of 90%. Crosbie said current numbers are higher, with call capacity at 98% and calls being answered in about 14 seconds. North Carolina's 988 line receives around 8,000 calls monthly.\n\nIn order to sustain this progress for the long term, Crosbie said, the 988 system will need sustainable funding.\n\n\"We really need insurers to recognize this as an appropriate level of care and to cover it. So they all cover 'urgent cares' now, right? Folks who go to an urgent care, and you have Aetna or Blue Cross, they're going to cover it,\" she said. \"You go to a mental-health 'urgent care'; that should be covered as well.\"\n\nAngela Kimball, chief advocacy officer for the group Inseparable, said the report calls on state legislatures to focus on creating sustainable funding sources and accountability measures for their crisis response systems.\n\n\"By having these accountability pieces,\" she said, \"this allows legislators to oversee the system over the long haul, and to set up the structures for continuous learning, continuous system improvement.\"\n\nShe said data collection, annual reporting and coordination between the 988 and 911 systems are ways states can make them more accountable.\n\nDisclosure: Inseparable contributes to our fund for reporting on Criminal Justice, Health Issues, Mental Health, Social Justice.

The Diabetes Impact Project works in the Northeast, near Northwest, and Near West neighborhoods in Indianapolis, where rates of diabetes are almost double other parts of Marion County.\n\nLisa Staten, associate professor of community and global health at the university, said the project's three-tier approach involves community health workers assisting people with diabetes in managing their diet and glucose monitoring, while also addressing their social needs.\n\n\"The community health workers work with them to understand, is there a food security issue? Are there challenges with housing?\" Staten explained. \"We also have neighborhood community health workers that are located in these three parts of the city, to help raise awareness about diabetes prevention and diabetes risk.\"\n\nThe third tier, which Staten described as the most direct, is made up of steering committees, funding projects to improve physical activity infrastructure and healthy food access, address mental health concerns and build social connections. According to the Indiana Department of Health, about 12% of Hoosiers are diabetic.\n\nThe $12 million eight-year program is a partnership with the Fairbanks School of Public Health, Eli Lilly and Company, Eskenazi Health and the Marion County Health Department. One component was to have a federally qualified health center located in each of the areas for more community-based involvement.\n\nStaten pointed out diverse neighborhood input was sought prior to the project's funding.\n\n\"We approached community residents and asked what they wanted to see in it,\" Staten recounted. \"They said they don't want a one-year project. 'We don't want you to come in and take our data and go. It needs to be a long-term commitment.' And we listened to that and incorporated all that into it.\"\n\nDespite the pandemic, which happened during the project, Staten added the researchers were able to continue their work. The findings will be published in academic journals and public forums for the community to see its impact.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nA North Carolina woman is speaking out about the importance of the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nDonnaMarie Woodson, who battled cancer during the 2008 recession when her husband lost his job, credits the Affordable Care Act for providing vital health insurance for her family. Enrolling in the federal program allowed Woodson to undergo regular screenings, leading to the early detection of colon and breast cancer.\n\nNow, Woodson is urging lawmakers to protect important health care programs.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act literally saved my life,\" Woodson asserted. \"Because I would not have gone to get screened because of medical debt.\"\n\nShe pointed out the Inflation Reduction Act has also had a profound effect on her family, particularly in managing her husband's Type 1 diabetes. She said the measure's insulin cap helped reduce the cost of his medicine from $200 to $35. It has made a significant difference for their fixed income household.\n\nAccording to Tufts University, the Affordable Care Act has been challenged in court more than 2,000 times. The Inflation Reduction Act has also met its\n\nfair share of pushback and votes to repeal different provisions in the law.\n\nWoodson argued if the programs are not protected, it could pose severe risks to people across the country.\n\n\"People's lives are at stake. People will die,\" Woodson stressed. \"That is a plain fact without health care, quality affordable care, not just in your care but quality affordable care. People need that and it's a right.\"\n\nToday, Woodson's story extends beyond her personal experiences. She actively works with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network to lobby for health care rights, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining and expanding health care programs. She encouraged others to share their own experiences in their communities and make their voices heard by local leaders.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nIn rural Tennessee, many residents lack access to healthy, fresh, and affordable food. So, two health center systems in the state are sprouting solutions - with community garden programs.\n\nAura Sheran - a certified clinical medical assistant with East Tennessee State University's Johnson City Community Health Center - said the garden connects patients, the community, and volunteers - which fosters a collaborative effort to address food insecurity and promote healthier choices.\n\n\"We serve a lot of the community, that don't have enough funds to purchase produce and that kind of thing, food wise,\" said Sheran. \"So, it helps them to cut some of that cost back, and to take some produce home and share with their family.\"\n\nCommunity health centers serve more than 423,000 patients across Tennessee, regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.\n\nNicole Vanover is a phlebotomist with Ballad Health who provides lab services to the ETSU clinic.\n\nShe said community partners - like the Appalachian Resource Conservation and Development Council, which runs a food access program - help to provide resources, and vendors provide funding and equipment.\n\n\"Tractor Supply - both the Johnson City Tractor Supply and the Jonesborough Tractor Supply store - each donated about $150 to $200 worth of products,\" said Vanover. \"That was soil, fertilizer, tomato cages, things like that.\"\n\nShe added that the garden flourishes with the support of volunteer ETSU students who help maintain it, and clear the beds at the end of each growing season.\n\nCherokee Health Systems maintains legacy gardens at its Alcoa, Maynardville, and New Tazewell health centers.\n\nGinny Weatherstone, community development consultant with Cherokee, said the gardens serve as community spaces where patients can interact.\n\nAnd they honor the memory of former CEO - Dr. Dennis Freeman, who had a passion for gardening from his Iowa farm upbringing.\n\n\"Growing things was something that he did growing up, and it was always near and dear to his heart,\" said Weatherstone. \"He got sidetracked there, leading a rather large organization for over 40 years, and always in the back of his mind had the idea of community gardens that would serve our patients.\"\n\nWeatherstone pointed out that participants also learn about gardening in Cherokee Health Systems' psychiatric day-treatment program.\n\nSo, the garden serves a dual purpose - providing fresh fruits and vegetables for patients, and helping people with mental illness learn how to cope.\n\n\"We really do believe that these gardens are an important part of the day treatment program. They are scheduled now into the the daily activity, the list of things that are going to be done,\" said Weatherstone. \"There is nothing like a bowl of fresh strawberries to just really make somebody feel good about what they've been able to accomplish.\"\n\nget more stories like this via email"
