        "text": "Use of Dallmeier trademarks by third parties\n\nBusiness partners of Dallmeier as well as media (newspapers, trade journals, etc.) may use Dallmeier trademarks (overview), for example to illustrate the compatibility with products or applications, to indicate a cooperation or to guide the reader, provided that the aforementioned guidelines are adhered to.\n\n1) Correct spelling\n\nIn principle, it should be worked towards ensuring the correct spelling and display of trademarks when they are used. A shortened or modified depiction requires a permission by Dallmeier electronic. The use of variations that may lead to ambiguity errors is not permissible.\n\n2) Designation of Dallmeier trademarks\n\nWhere they are most distinctly marked, Dallmeier trademarks must be designated by the registered sign ®. This applies to products, packaging, manuals, advertisements, promotional material, online presences as well as headlines and such. Thereby it is sufficient to insert the registered sign ® in continuous texts or the main text at the point where the Dallmeier trademark is first mentioned. The indication of proprietary rights must adhere to the following structure:\n\n“[Name of the trademark(s)] is/are (a) trademark(s) or registered trademark(s) of Dallmeier electronic\".\n\nThe ® sign as well as the addendum indication of proprietary rights need to be positioned so that the reader can easily and effortlessly take notice of them.\n\n3) Distinction between Dallmeier trademarks and products of the partner\n\nWhen using Dallmeier product names in order to illustrate product compatibility, a clear distinction must be made between the products and services of the partner and the products and services of Dallmeier electronic.\n\nExamples of correct indications:\n\n[Name of third-party product] for use with recorders by Dallmeier electronic.\n\n[Name of third-party product] compatible with recording devices by Dallmeier electronic.\n\nIf, instead of the company name, product names which have been registered by Dallmeier electronic are used, a registered sign ® as well as an indication of the proprietary rights must be inserted after the designation.\n\n4) Incorporation of Dallmeier trademarks into names of products\n\nThe incorporation of Dallmeier trademarks or the company name into the names of products or domains or into an external company's name is only permissible if a written authorisation by Dallmeier has been obtained.\n\n5) Correct style\n\nIn the case that the business partner wants to use trademarks by Dallmeier electronic in headlines or on packaging in order to indicate the compatibility of its products, the style of the depiction must be such that there is no danger of ambiguity errors. Also, the phrasing must not give reason to assume that a connection with Dallmeier electronic exists. This applies to packaging labels as well as marketing materials and other publications. In those cases the company name of the business partner must be more distinctly highlighted than the trademarks by Dallmeier electronic with regard to all materials, products, packaging, advertisements, online presences and other promotional material.\n\nTrademarks and registered trademarks\n\nThe following list includes company trade marks as well as registered company trademarks which Dallmeier electronic uses in accompanying print materials and on websites in order to guide the reader or to point out any compatibility with products by Dallmeier or refer to corresponding products and services of the company.\n\nIn using those names Dallmeier does not intend in any way to convey the impression that Dallmeier has any trade mark rights whatsoever or that any special business relationship exists.\n\nIf a trade mark is not included in the overview, it is no indication that the respective trade mark is not protected. The unlawful use of a trade mark may constitute existing protective rights."
