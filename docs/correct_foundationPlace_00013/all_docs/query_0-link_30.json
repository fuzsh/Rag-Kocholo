        "text": "FLY Results – Values – Staff – Imagine 2030 – FLY Awards & Recognition – Supporters – Careers – Press Kit\n\nWatch “Why I FLY” featuring FLY’s President and CEO, Ali Knight\n\nThe Need for Fly and Results\n\nThe Pipeline to Prison\n\nThere is a pipeline to prison that funnels young people into the criminal justice system. Oftentimes this cycle begins in schools. Once a young person has entered this pipeline it is difficult to escape and the likelihood of ending up in prison as an adult is magnified.\n\nThis is especially true for youth of color, students with disabilities, histories of poverty, abuse or neglect. These students would likely benefit from resources, but are isolated, punished and pushed out.\n\nRacism and Discrimination in the Justice System\n\nThe overwhelming majority of young people involved in the juvenile justice system have been youth of color.\n\nWe believe this is because the racism embedded in our society is mirrored—or even magnified—in the juvenile justice system. FLY has a strong commitment to racial equity in our systems and communities.\n\nFly’s Solution\n\nIt’s time to imagine new possibilities for youth impacted by the justice system.\n\nFLY youth are part of the solution! Young people who have lived experience within the justice system help us identify and advocate for innovative and effective solutions.\n\nFLY supports reducing and eventually eliminating juvenile incarceration, transitioning instead to a community-based system of care aimed at wrapping support around youth using a strengths-based approach like the approach we employ at FLY.\n\nAll of these solutions provide children with critical services, keep communities safe, and save taxpayer dollars. There are many better choices than incarceration to promote public health and safety, and to ensure all our kids have the opportunity to grow into healthy, free, and productive adults.\n\nResults\n\nStudies show that young people are up to\n\n10 times less likely\n\nto face later system involvement when they have access to community-based alternatives to incarceration like FLY.\n\nOn average, completion of a FLY program has the following impact:\n\nEach year, FLY’s young people make significant gains in reducing system involvement, attaining their educational goals, and developing the critical life skills and confidence they need to make changes in their lives. Together with our young people, we also help our juvenile justice systems become more just, humane, and equitable. As a result, FLY increases safety in our communities and decreases the costs and consequences of crime.\n\nRead FLY’s 2023 Annual Report for data about the most recent fiscal year.\n\nImagine 2030\n\nCareers & Internships\n\nPress Kit\n\nAwards\n\n& recognition\n\nRecognized nationally, regionally, and locally\n\nWith an innovative head & heart approach and consistently outstanding results, FLY has received local, national and state recognition for our work!"
