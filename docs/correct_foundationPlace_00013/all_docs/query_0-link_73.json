Experience courtrooms, law offices, law libraries and mock trials using the U.S. judicial process. Develop a foundation in criminal, family and civil law. Work in an office environment using software applications and processes used by attorneys and paralegals.\n\nSee what customized training options are available to you.\n\nWith a wide range of organizations and industries calling Downtown Oklahoma City home, a one-size-fits-all training approach will not meet every business need.\n\nMedical assistants are multi-skilled health professionals who work primarily in ambulatory settings such as medical offices and clinics. They perform clinical and administrative tasks, and their duties vary by office or clinic.\n\nTo prepare medical assistants who are competent in cognitive knowledge, psychomotor skills, and affective behavior learning domains to enter the profession, the major combines classroom, laboratory and work-site learning components to ensure that each student achieves entry-level competencies for the medical assistant.\n\nStudents practice in a variety of settings as chosen by the instructor. Students completing this career major will be eligible to sit for the Certified or Registered Medical Assistant exam.\n\nIt is the mission of the Metro Technology Practical Nursing Program to prepare individuals for successful employment and life in entry level nursing positions within a global society. Metro Technology Centers (Metro Tech) and the practical nursing program are committed to responding to the student and community needs through the programs, learning environment and quality instruction. Jointly we strive to facilitate the optimal achievement of every student. We are focused on preparing a student with the education to become gainfully employed in a global society."
