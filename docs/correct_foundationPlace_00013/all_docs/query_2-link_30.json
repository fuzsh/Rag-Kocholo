        "text": "Through Adobe Express for Education, we offer our easy-to-use, task-based creativity applications to teachers and students in the US along with tutorials, courses, lesson plans, and video guides to help them start their creative journeys. In 2022, we put Adobe Express in the hands of more than 40 million K–12 students globally.\n\nThrough Adobe Express for Nonprofits, we offer free licenses to over 10 million global nonprofits to help them engage donors and drive greater impact.\n\nWe’re engaging with college students across the US at more than 50 designated Adobe Creative Campuses. This program spotlights leading colleges and universities that recognize the value of teaching digital literacy in higher education. For example, as part of the curriculum at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California, students interested in pursuing careers in design and creativity can enroll in a free 10-week certification course taught by Adobe experts.\n\nThrough our India 2% for Youth program, we are working with local partners Pratham Education Foundation and Agastya International Foundation to create opportunities that promote creative learning among children and youth in rural and remote areas across India. We’ve connected with more than 100,000 students in 800 villages via Creative Clubs and supported Mobile Innovation Labs that reach an additional 21,000 children.\n\nThis program supports creativity in the community in two ways: through museum collaborations that provide greater community access to arts education and raise the visibility of diverse creators, and through the Community Fund, which supports creators during times of extraordinary hardship. In 2022, Adobe supported 125 creators impacted by the war in Ukraine.\n\nWe launched this program on Adobe.com to enable everyone to engage and share their stories. We believe that hearing diverse perspectives can help us evolve what’s possible for the next generation.\n\nOn a global scale, our Create Change campaigns bridge the divides between cultures and creative disciplines by bringing unique stories to life across social channels, Adobe.com, and our media partners’ platforms. The campaigns have resulted in over 20 million impressions for diverse creators around the world.\n\nWe collaborate with partners such as Sundance, Apple+, Meta, USC Annenberg, and others to provide underrepresented creators with the mentorship and access they need to advance their careers. In 2022, these partnerships resulted in 75 new intensive mentorships and over 10 million impressions for their work."
