        "text": "​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Vine mealybug (Planococcus ficus) in Oregon\n\n​​Vine mealybug (VMB) was found in Oregon for the first time in the summer of 2021 by OSU Extension - male VMB were found in vineyards in Jackson County, OR. More information is available in the Vine mealybug Pest A​​​lert Handout​. VMB is one of the most important pests in grape-growing regions and is a vector for leafroll viruses. The establishment and spread of VMB throughout Oregon's winegrowing regions would be a serious threat to Oregon's wine industry.\n\nWhat actions has ODA taken?\n\nDelimitation Surveys. In 2022 ODA conducted surveys to determine the extent of the infestation around two sites – 450 trap sites were used on over 130 properties. These caught 25,459 male vine mealybugs. It is currently believed that the infestation is contained to approximately 1.5 square miles around the initial finds. OSU and affected Jackson County growers initiated treatments for the vine mealybug in 2023. These included treatment with the systemic insectide Movento® and season long mating disruption (pheromone) treatments. Delimitation trapping was repeated in 2023 in Jackson County with 360 trap sites. No VMB males were caught.\n\nStatewide Survey. A voluntary statewide VMB survey was initiated in 2023. 83 facilities participated from 11 counties (Benton, Clackamas, Douglas Josephine, Lane, Linn, Marion, Polk, Umatilla, Washington, and Yamhill Counties). Only two counties had one positive site each: Douglas and Linn Counties. Delimitation trapping will occur at both sites in 2024 and treatments where appropriate. An ODA led statewide survey will occur during 2024.\n\nQuarantine. Properties with grapevine plantings and positive trap finds were notified that they were under quarantine. Quarantine requirements and management recommendations were communicated. Quarantined vineyards applied at least one treatment in 2022 and 2023. Treatments are planned for 2024.\n\nThink you have found VMB or another mealybug in Oregon?\n\n​Report suspected finds at ODA’s identify an insect pagehttps://www.oregon.gov/oda/programs/IPPM/InsectsSpiders/Pages/IdentifyInsect.aspx .\n\nPlease include the location and date of the observation​​, putative identification, and a photo if available.​\n\nResources for mealybug identification\n\nMealybug sampling protocols in English and Spanish. Note: these ​reference Gill's mealybug, but protocols are effective for VMB.\n\nVine mealybug Pest Alert Handout​\n\nTrapping and Identifying Mealybugs in Oregon Vineyards​​ (OSU Extension)\n\nField Monitoring for Grapevine Leafroll Virus and Mealybug in Pacific Northwest Vineyards ​(OSU Extension)\n\nGrapevine Leafroll Virus and Mealybug Prevention and Management in Oregon Vineyards ​(OSU Extension)\n\nDistribution and monitoring of grape mealybug: A key vector of grapevine leafroll disease in Oregon (OSU Extension)\n\n​Resources for managing vine mealybug​\n\n​\n\nOregon's Grape Pest & Disease Quarantine (OAR 603-052-0051)\n\n​The following pests and diseases are considered harmful organisms under Oregon's quarantine rules:\n\nCertification Program Requirement - Effective January 1, 2023\n\n​In addition to other quarantine requirements, beginning January 1, 2023, all Vitis spp. plants and plant parts, including cuttings, bare-root plants, and rooted plants must o​riginate from an approved certification program. Currently, California and Washington are the only approved programs. Phytosanitary certificates must accompany all shipments.\n\nNotification Requirements for Importing Grapevine into Oregon\n\nPPA 7721 Grapevine Pathogen Testing Project\n\nODA's Plant Health Program has funds available for testing of Vitis spp. planting materials for several quarantine pathogens of concern for grapevine. These pathogens include Xylella fastidiosa (Pierce's Disease), Grapevine red blotch virus, and Grapevine leaf roll-associated virus 3. These pathogens were identified as being of significant concern to Oregon's grape industries.\n\nFunding for testing is available through a Plant Protection Act Section 7721 (PPA 7721) grant awarded to the ODA Plant Health Program. Funding is available for 2022 and 2023.\n\nGrapevine Pathogen Testing Project Handout\n\nGrapevine Pathogen Testing Request Form\n\nPacific Northwest Grapevine Quarantine Harmonization Project\n\nAs part of a multi-state harmonization project, the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA), Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), and the Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) worked closely with stakeholders in all three states to update their respective state quarantines based on current science, regional pest and disease pressures, and industry needs.\n\n​​ODA's updated quarantine rule was effective April 1, 2021.\n\n​Summary Document of Grapevine Quarantine Rule Changes​\n\n​​WSDA's rule was effective February 14, 2021.\n\nWSDA Grape Pest Quarantine w​ebpage.\n\nISDA adopted new rules for Grape Planting Stock and updated their quarantine in 2020.\n\nIdaho's Rules Governing Grape Planting Stock webpage.\n\n​Oregon Grapevine Quarantine Rulemaking Documents (2021)"
