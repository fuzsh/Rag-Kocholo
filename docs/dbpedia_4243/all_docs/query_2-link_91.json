        "text": "Hey All,\n\nIt seems that I am constantly battling mealy bug infestation with my Sarracenias, but not with my Nepenthes. Both genuses of plants feed primarily on ants. Ants are known \"farmers\" of mealybug and scale because they are attracted to the honeydew produced by these pests, and they move the pests between plants at will. Since I grow both Sarracenia and Nepenthes outdoors, ants frequent their traps on a daily basis. However, my Nepenthes have never had a mealy bug infestation whereas my Sarracenias always get the little buggers in their crowns. I've also noticed that scale isn't much of an issue with my Nepenthes either. Has anyone else experienced this situation? For some reason my mealy bugs attack everything except my Nepenthes. I wonder if they have some sort of natural pest repellant in them.\n\nAny thoughts??\n\nJoel\n\nNepenthes Around the House\n\nThere is a nepenthes pest going around. It is ,like a small tiny white fly/insect. It gathers in groups and not tended by ants. they will remain on a pitcher or stem even until they dry and turn brown/black.\n\nI have used a strong spray of water and it seems to work. I have also used very hot water from the tap in a mist bottle and chemicals from Merit and Orthene wp to even Avid with some success.\n\nI have recntly used marathon with mixed success.\n\nM\n\nI;ve got theese really wierd small pests that keep poping up and mainly attacking my truncata and truncata hybrids for some reason. They're also on my ventrata. I got the pests from a grower here in cali who grew a truncata and ventrata outside, which I now have. Theese demonic pests have small, narrow white bodies (or maybe those are dead bodies?) that group up and cling to the leaves and stems. If given time, they wil take over the anatomy of the host, and leaves it covered in disgusting white flecks that are very difficult to wash off. They dont seem to fit the description of typical pests, but I think they may be in the presence of some scale. Have you ever encountered theese things NepsAroundTheHouse? Nepenthes are deffinately not immune...\n\nI've only been able to manage them. I've competely killed them on some plants, but they cling tenaciously to a couple of them, defying any attempt at killing even with repeated orthene applications.\n\nI wouldn't be suprised if they were aliens. They don't look like anything I've seen before, and I've never even seen one moving around. They are almost spooky that way.\n\nCapslock\n\nActually, those are called 'Whitefly'. Those are the egg/larval cases. The hatchlings suck the plant juices out from inside the case. The adult is a small whitish colored fly. They can be seen flitting around the plant, sitting on the leaves. However, they spend most of their time down in the potting mix, where they mate. The females then lay more little elongated white dots that suck your plant dry of vital life fluids. They often return to the area where they hatched, because, if you're a whitefly, it was a successful place to breed. This whole life cycle takes about ten days to two weeks.\n\nWhenever we see them in the greenhouse, I take action immediately. First step-remove the white dots. As recommended to me by a Florida Agricultural agent: mix rubbing alcohol and water 50/50. Add a few drops of liquid soap, like dish washing detergent. Soak a cotton swab in this mixture and gently scrub off the white dots. Be thorough-these little suckers like to hide in leaf crevasses and undersides of leaves. Once removed, I like to rinse off the plant with purified water.\n\nNext step-eradicate the adults. For this you should use an insecticide. Whitefly adults are not tough. Any standard insecticide will work. Spray the infected plant and the surface of the potting mix. Spray the potting mix surface of adjacent plants.\n\nCheck the infected plant a week later and remove any new white dots using the same procedure. Repeat the insecticide spraying 10 days to two weeks later. I find preventative treatment is best. We never have problems with them anymore-nor scale or mealybug.\n\nBye bye whitefly.\n\nTrent\n\nI have good success uisng Merit every ten days. I also use very hot water through a mist bottle and burn the hell out of them!\n\nI have way too many plants and many are inaccessible to swab alcohol. These are tough little guys. Its interesting that they are not associated with ants and they get around on their own. Its also interesting that they persist even on dried foliage and remain after the leaf/pitcher/tendril dies.\n\nAvid also works well, but this is too expensive for regular use. I have also alternated with Orthene WP (wettable powder) with positive success.\n\nAlso removing very damaged leaves and pitchers helps cut down the breeding population.\n\nMichael\n\nNo guys, the pic on the previous page is a whitefly, not a mealy bug. We'll see if we can get a pic of a mealy bug... they almost look fluffy, like cotton. They are not the same as whitefly.\n\nlol, the whitefly are tiny, and you may not see them around. The little white dots are egg cases of this whitefly. We have had good results with Orthene, but now we use Talstar and haven't seen a whitefly attack since our first application.\n\nJust spraying the plant with a non-systemic (like Talstar) does have disadvantages - because once the plant produces new leaves, they are unprotected by the insecticide. Orthene is a systemic, which means the plant absorbs it and is inoculated for several months.\n\nWhitefly is tough to get rid of, but we did it. Michael, I have spent a lot of time cleaning leaves with the cotton swab, it really helps to control the problem."
