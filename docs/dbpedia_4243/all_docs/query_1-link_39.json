        "text": "Sure looks like it to me. I get them in the branch crotches on some azaleas and I have a starflower that draws them like a magnet.\n\nThe alcohol treatment works well, and you can put the solution in a spray bottle and use it at one-week intervals to kill any eggs left behind. Insecticidal soap works too.\n\nBut personally, maybe I’m just getting nasty in my old age, but I more and more often get out a spray bottle of Sevin for most pests. It’s my horticultural equivalent of, “Say hello to my little friend!”.\n\nYep, you hit the jackpot, some white fly, and some mealy bug, treat with what ever you are comfortable using. I prefer going full nuclear, something truly toxic. Sevin - you need to read the label, if it doesn't list mealy bug and white fly, it will just piss them off, they will breed faster. (partly joking) The old line organophosphates like Malathion will work, as will neo nics, like imadiproclid which is, or was in Bayer and in Bonide products. The Alcohol will work, but you must spray surface and underside of every leaf, and repeat every 4 or 5 days if weather is in the 80's F. Alcohol will require 3 or more applications to really kill off the pests. Pyrethrum based products tend to be pretty weak due to many insects having built some resistance.\n\nHummert is based in Saint Louis, they have a full line of pesticides, you could probably order and just pick up at the warehouse, saving on shipping if you can't find something in your local full line nursery. Just browse through their website, they have the full labels on line.\n\nKey - read the labels. The label must list the pest you are trying to kill. If it doesn't list it, don't use it."
