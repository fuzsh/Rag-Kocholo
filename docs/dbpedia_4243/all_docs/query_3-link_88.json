        "text": "2. Mealybugs (Classification) Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Insecta Order: Hemiptera Superfamily: Coccoidea Family: Pseudococcidae Genus: Planococcus Species: P. citri\n\n3. Introduction • Members of scale insects • Name is due to the sticky and powdery covering that resembles “cornmeal” • 5000 species from 246 families of plants • Waxy material, which protect them from loss of moisture and heat • Common pest of indoor plants • “Hard to kill insects” as they live in hidden places\n\n4. Contd… • Warm temperature favors their growth • Herbaceous, woody plants, citrus plants and ornamental plants. • Found all over world except Antarctica. • Fruiting phase of plants • Arboreal or subterranean. • Can make colonies • Suck plant sap.\n\n5. Female •Adult females are elongate, oval, soft •Distinct segmentation • 8–9 mm in length, • Wingless • Their thread-like mouthparts.\n\n6. Male • Adult male has a pair of long opaque wings • Slender body • Two multisegmented antennae that are about half the body length • About 1.5 mm in length • Active fliers & abortive mouthparts • Only fly and find a female to mate\n\n7. Commonly found types of mealybugs i. Rice mealybug Across East Asia, serious pest of rice in Asian countries. All stages except crawlers infective. ii. Citrus mealybug Citrus plant pest. Female and nymph infective Greenhouse plants.\n\n8. Contd…. iii. Long-tailed mealybug Possess long tail, 17 pairs of waxy filaments around periphery,(tail) filaments & bear young ones. iv. Root mealybug Present in roots. No filaments, serious pest of Africa violet.\n\n9. Life cycle Stages of life Egg • Oval, visible and are covered in ovisac. • Color of eggs differ among different species & time of hatching. Nymph • Instars are nymphal stages. • First instars are called crawlers and active. • Females have three instar and males have four for stages.\n\n10. Adults Females develop after third instar . Parts and pores for secretion of wax. Not active, oval, pink to white in color and die after laying eggs hatch under the female’s dead body. Males are formed after fourth instar including pre-pupa and pupa stages. It is produced in cocoon. Three pairs of eyes and wing pads Active and pair of wings, lack mouth parts which means they do not feed. They are needed for mating.\n\n12. Life cycle of P.citri • Eggs are oval, yellow and glossy 300 to 800 in one. • Hatching after 6 to 10 days. • Nymphs appeared are coated with some wax particles containing red eyes. Instar are 4 in females while 3 in males (with pre-pupal and pupa stage). • Males are in cocoon, greyish, contain wings and antennae, slender and elongated than females. • Female grow completely in 6 to 8 weeks while male in 2 to 3 weeks. • Females are wing-less and are coated with wax • Total span is 30 to 35 days. • Both males and females are almost equal\n\n13. Damage • Direct & Indirect • plant growth, wilting, yellowing of leaves, leaf drop and possibly plant death • Fungus; Indoor plants, green house plants • Mango, banana and apple tree. • Plants under irrigation or fertilization • Affect xylem and phloem. • Cotton mealybug in 2005, Sindh Punjab.\n\n14. Contd… • They secrete honey dew • promote development of fungus • creating a black sooty mass • Honeydew flicked away by mealybug • Mealybugs are carrier for various viral diseases and secrete toxins.\n\n15. Methods of dispersal By planting of infected plants have cryptic behavior.  Dispersal to distant areas can be due to trade of plants infected .  Water used for irrigation is the source for Root mealybugs dispersal  Air currents are responsible for spread of crawlers  Instruments used for farming and harvesting used in infested area, if not cleaned properly may carry them.  If natural predators are not present mealybugs spread rapidly.  Ants are reported as an important source for dispersal of crawler\n\n16. Control of mealybugs 1. Chemical control They repel water soluble and polar insecticide due to their waxy coating . Controlled by some neonicotinoids (dinotefuran) and systemic insecticides (Azadirachtin) or drenches. Can be applied in many ways Population above ground can be controlled by foliage cover spray.\n\n17. Contd… Insecticide solutions applied to soil cause its penetration to root zone to control species underground. Applied through irrigation. Smearing of insecticides on stem and branches can also be done. Ethyl bromide fumigation can also be done\n\n18. Insecticides Name Class Mode of action Acephate Organophosphate Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor Dinotefuran Neonicotinoids Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor disruptor Bifenthrin Pyrethroid Prolong opening of sodium channels Buprofezin IGR Chitin synthesis inhibitor\n\n19. Oil • Oils have long been used for the control of scale insects • the integration of narrow refined oils with other insecticides was suggested as a means to dissolve the insect’s wax. • Effective in the control of garden and household mealybugs. • Neem oil and insecticidal soaps are used • Not much effective on large area • Neem Oil is also sprayed as insecticides\n\n20. Physical control • Water can cause mealybug’s flushing from leaves providing fast but temporary relief • Colonies of mealybugs can crush and rub off by cloth. • Removal of infested plants. • Cleaning by cotton dipped into alcohol. • Hot water is also an effective to get rid of mealybugs as it does not alter quality of fruit.\n\n21. Biological control Cryptolaemus montrouzieri • “Australian lady bird beetle” • mealybug destroyer. Spalgis epius Indian butterfly, feed on root mealy bug.\n\n22. Contd… Anagyrus pseudococci • Parasitoids of citrus mealybug, . • They feed of larval instars and females Anagyrus fusciventris Parasitoids, P. longispinus , One mealybug give birth to one wasp in about 3 weeks. They suck bodies of instars and kill them\n\n23. Resistance in mealybugs • Behavioral resistance • Metabolic resistance Causes of resistance • Waxy coating • Cryptic behavior • Presence of refugia • Repeated exposure"
