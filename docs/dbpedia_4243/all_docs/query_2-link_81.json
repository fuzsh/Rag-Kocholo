        "text": "Retarded plant growth & malformations\n\nMealybug females feed on plant sap, secreting a powdery wax layer over their body, for protection. Their feeding causes stunting, chlorosis, defoliation and wilting. Adult male mealybugs, on the other hand, do not feed at all, they only live shortly to fertilize the females. A high mealybug population can lead to fruit drop, fruit deformation (‘high shoulders’) and development of discolored welts on the rind of the fruit. Mealybugs are phytosanitary pests in some export markets (USA, Japan) and if found on fruit destined for these markets can result in rejection of the consignment and could place these important markets at risk for the future.\n\nBlack fungal mold\n\nMealybug secrete copious quantities of honeydew which is a substrate for the a group of fungi, sooty mold. Sooty mold is black in color and may stain the fruit decreasing packout percentages as well as causing a delay in fruit color development. Photosynthetic potential, especially of young trees, may be negatively affected if the sooty mold coverage is severe."
