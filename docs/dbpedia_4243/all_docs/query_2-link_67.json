        "text": "f a plant is heavily infested with mealybugs, the best course of action is to throw the plant away before the bugs can spread to another plant. Smaller infestations can be dealt with by separating the plant so the mealybugs stay contained. To get the mealybugs off your plant, remove them with a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol. Then, spray the infected plant with a mixture of dish soap, rubbing alcohol, and water. Putting neem oil on plants will also deter mealybugs from getting on them. The best way to prevent mealybugs from contaminating your greenery is to carefully inspect a new plant before putting it near others.\n\nIf you find yourself with mealybugs infesting your plants, call us for a quick and efficient removal."
