        "text": "Monitoring: As the fruit ripens, it becomes more attractive to mealybugs. At this point, begin scouting the field regularly and on a weekly basis.\n\nUsing traps to monitor: Monitoring systems can help you decide when to apply insecticides. Population levels can be reduced or controlled by mass trapping, mating disruption, or lure and kill. The success of these methods depends on the availability of the pheromone and its quality.\n\nControlling ants: Ants assist in the spread and establishment of mealybug colonies, are attracted to the honeydew, and can have a suppressive effect on natural mealybug enemies.\n\nSanitation: Keep the crops’ close surroundings and environmental conditions neat by removing weeds and plant debris as much as possible.\n\nIn vines: Mealybug populations overwinter primarily under the bark of the trunk that keeps them relatively safe and more protected against spraying applications. As berries ripen and sugar levels begin raising, mealybugs start moving towards the berry clusters and infestation upon fruits will likely begin near the vine cordon. For these reasons, a common practice in vines is peeling up the bark along the stems – from cordon to bottom. This will expose mealybugs and make them more vulnerable to sprayable insecticides."
