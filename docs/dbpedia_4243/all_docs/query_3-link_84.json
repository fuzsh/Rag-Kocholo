        "text": "( scale insects )\n\nGeneral\n\nStinging-sucking insects belonging to the order Hemiptera and the superfamily Coccoideae.\n\nSeveral species parasitize vegetables, especially floury plants belonging to the Pseudococcidae family.\n\nThey lack a horny shield (a kind of shell), and the body is usually covered with a white mealy secretion. They also have lateral waxy filaments clearly visible at the periphery of the body, and a cottony secretion containing the eggs can sometimes be noticed at the end of the abdomen.\n\nBy way of example we will describe the characteristics of the species Pseudococcus viburni (Signoret) (syn. Pseudococcus affinis [Maskell]).\n\nInsects observed in open fields and under shelters.\n\nExamples of species reported on Solanaceae: Pseudococus spp., Paracoccus marginatus , Phenacoccus gossypii , Orthezia spp.\n\nOrgans attacked : leaves, fruits, stems.\n\nSymptoms :\n\nPlant growth reduced due to the numerous bites and food sucks exerted by the larvae and females of mealybugs present, especially on the stem.\n\nDeformation of the leaves which can be more or less curled, blistered, embossed, etc.\n\nPresence of honeydew and subsequently Sooty mold covering the surface of the affected aerial organs (figures).\n\nSooty mold, by reducing photosynthesis and respiration, causes yellowing and leaf damage. It also stains the fruits or alters their coloring, making them unmarketable (figure).\n\n>>> More pictures\n\nSigns : Presence of larvae and adults on the affected organs (figures).\n\nPossible confusion :\n\nBiology\n\nDevelopment cycle : involves\n\nEggs laid inside a white waxy ovisac.\n\nAfter hatching, the first instar larvae disperse on infested plants.\n\nAfter the second larval stage, this insect will form two successive false nymphs in which the males will undergo a metamorphosis.\n\nAdults, small winged midges whose life is ephemeral. Females, measuring 4 mm in length, do not undergo metamorphosis and therefore do not change shape. The pinkish color of their body is masked by white mealy wax.\n\nDispersion : by plant material, but also by workers during cultivation operations, animals.\n\nP. viburni tolerates cold fairly well and overwinters as a non-diapausing nymph in the soil. It can be maintained on other alternative hosts, in particular on potato, apple tree, lemon tree, vine.\n\nProtection\n\nCreate a crawl space on the farm if the cochineal populations are important.\n\nLeach with water and treat the walls of shelters, posts, concrete walkways with an insecticide or a contact acaricide.\n\nDisinfect the equipment used in the greenhouse (drip system, boxes, etc.).\n\nDisinfect the reused substrate or soil.\n\nProduce the seedlings in an nursery insect-proof .\n\nCheck the sanitary quality of the plants before and during their introduction into the crop or shelter.\n\nRemove and destroy infested plant debris and crop residues.\n\nReason for chemical protection, in particular if you use auxiliaries or biopesticides, especially since most insecticides are not very effective on whiteflies.\n\nTreat plants before uprooting in the presence of high pest populations.\n\nLast change : 10/12/21"
