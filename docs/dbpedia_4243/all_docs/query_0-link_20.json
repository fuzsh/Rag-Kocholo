        "text": "There are hundreds of insect species known collectively as mealybugs, nearly 300 of which are found in North America. They cause damage by sucking the juice from their host plants, especially from new growth.\n\nIn northern climates, they are principally a problem with houseplants and are found in private greenhouses but are rarely seen outdoors. In warmer climates, however, they can pose a serious problem for entire crops.\n\nRead on for seven methods that help you get rid of mealybugs outside and on houseplants.\n\nWhat Are Mealybugs?\n\nMealybugs are small, oval sap-sucking insects related to scale insects. These warm-weather bugs measure 1/10 to 1/4 inch and secrete a powdery wax substance as a protective coating. The mealybug's coating has a white cottony appearance, making it easy to identify when it appears on the stems and leaves of plants.\n\nMealybugs belong to the Pseudococcida family. Mealybugs eat plant sap. There are different types of mealybugs, with some of the most common being the citrus mealybug (Planococcus citri) and the long-tailed mealybug (Pseudococcus longispinus).\n\nMealybug Life Cycle\n\nFemale mealybugs lay from 300 to 600 eggs, which hatch in a few days. Within six to 10 weeks, the hatched insects are ready to lay eggs, so an infestation of mealybugs can perpetuate itself almost indefinitely unless they are eradicated.\n\nMealybug Damage on Plants\n\nA light mealybug infestation is easy to get rid of, but heavy infestations can be more difficult.\n\nLight infestation: Light mealybug infestations are when you detect a few mealybugs and their white, cottony egg masses on the plant. The earlier you take action to get rid of the mealybugs, the less likely it will turn into a heavy infestation that will affect the plant's health. If it's a houseplant, it should be separated from other houseplants during treatments to prevent the infestation from spreading.\n\nModerate to heavy infestation: Signs of a heavy infestation are lots of mealybugs and their egg masses. You'll also see their waxy excretions (known as honeydew), which encourage the growth of sooty mold fungus, and possibly ants feeding on the honeydew. Over time, mealybugs cause the leaves to yellow and eventually drop from the plant. They can also cause fruits, vegetables, and flower buds to prematurely drop off. Moderate to heavy mealybug infestations may require getting rid of the plant if it’s indoors. For outdoor plants with more serious infestations, repeated treatments are suggested.\n\nWant more gardening tips?

This is best for light infestations, as some fragile plants do not tolerate vigorous treatment. From there, repeat the treatment whenever mealybugs reappear.\n\nMethod 2: Use Isopropyl Alcohol\n\nFirst, soak a cotton ball with isopropyl rubbing alcohol that contains no more than 70% alcohol. Test the alcohol on one leaf to ensure it doesn't cause damage before applying it to the whole plant. Next, wipe the mealybugs off with the cotton ball, which kills them instantly and removes them.\n\nRepeat treatment weekly until the infestation is completely gone.\n\nMethod 3: Spray With Insecticidal Soap\n\nWhen it comes to insecticidal soap, you can opt for a commercial product, preferably one that is free of perfumes and additives that might harm plants. You can also make insecticidal soap by mixing 1 teaspoon of dish soap with 1 gallon of water.\n\nSpray the soapy solution on all the plant parts, including the underside of the leaves. Repeat biweekly or weekly if the infestation persists.\n\nDo know, homemade insecticidal soap and many commercial products can be used up to the day of harvest on edibles (make sure to wash it thoroughly before consuming) but always check the product label.\n\nMethod 4: Use Neem Oil\n\nMix neem oil, which is an organic insecticide. with a mild dish detergent and water (1 to 2 tablespoons of neem oil, 1 to 2 teaspoons of dish detergent, and 1 gallon of warm water, or as directed on the product label).\n\nNext, spray the neem oil on the plants in the morning or evening when beneficial insects are less active. The natural substance in neem oil affects an insect's feeding abilities, growth, and development, plus acts as a repellent. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, neem oil is safe to use on vegetables and other edible plants, including ornamentals.\n\nRepeat every seven days until the infestation is gone.\n\nMethod 5: Introduce Predatory Insects\n\nCombatting mealybugs with predatory insects will take the longest, but it is also the only one with beneficial side effects for your garden. It is not recommended if you have a severe mealybug infestation and need quick results.\n\nLacebugs, parasitoid wasps (Leptomastix dactylopii), and Crypts sometimes known as the \"mealybug destroyer\" (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri), all naturally kill mealybugs. Crypts are closely related to ladybugs and take between 5 and 6 days to hatch. All of these natural predators are more commonly used for outdoor infestations or in greenhouses.\n\nTo introduce predatory insects, plant host plants that attract them, or purchase them from commercial online retailers. Make your garden a welcoming environment for predatory insects by offering food sources and shelter. Don't use broad-spectrum pesticides.\n\nMethod 6: Use Homemade Insect Spray\n\nTo make a batch of homemade garden pesticide, combine 1 garlic bulb, 1 small onion, and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper in a food processor or blender and process into a paste. Mix into 1 quart of water and steep for 1 hour. From there, strain through a cheesecloth and add 1 tablespoon of liquid dish soap. Mix well.\n\nNext, spray the solution on the plant parts where mealybugs are present, including the underside of the leaves. Repeat as needed after a few days. The mixture can be stored for up to 1 week in the refrigerator.\n\nMethod 7: Use Synthetic Chemical Pesticide\n\nThe use of a chemical pesticide should always be the last resort and used with extreme caution. Not only do broad-spectrum insecticides indiscriminately kill all insects, good or bad, but they also contain substances that can be harmful to humans. Also, remember that the protection offered by the wax on the insects can make these pesticides less effective.\n\nFirst, select a pesticide that is specifically formulated and approved for use against mealybugs, and if planning to use it on houseplants, verify that it is safe to use indoors. Follow the label directions on how and when to apply it.\n\nIf the infestation persists, follow the pesticide label instructions for repeated application.\n\nWhat Causes Mealybugs?\n\nMealybugs tend to be drawn to certain plants that are abundant with juices they prefer to feed on. Citrus trees are particularly susceptible, and mealybugs can pose a serious threat to some commercial crops, such as mango. Mealybugs can infest various indoor houseplants, particularly tropical species.\n\nMealybugs are attracted to plants with high nitrogen levels and soft growth; they may appear if you overwater and over-fertilize your plants. Properly watering and feeding plants not only lowers the risk of plants getting mealybugs, it is also crucial for preventing plant diseases.\n\nHow to Prevent Mealybugs\n\nThe best control for mealybugs is defensive. Healthy, vigorous plants are less susceptible to infestation than weak, underpotted, and stressed plants.\n\nHowever, mealybugs can infect even healthy plants. Often, they come in on new plants, because greenhouses are the perfect breeding ground for them. Check any new plant purchases carefully before adding them to your collection.\n\nMany other strategies can help prevent mealybug infestations on your plants including:\n\nReducing feeding and watering may sometimes prevent mealybugs since it reduces nitrogen levels and hardens a plant's growth.\n\nWiping foliage regularly with a leaf shine solution containing neem oil.\n\nFor plants that can tolerate such treatment, regularly spray with hard blasts of water.\n\nFor indoor plants that can tolerate it, dropping nighttime temperatures to 60 degrees Fahrenheit will discourage mealybugs, which prefer more tropical temperatures.\n\nIf an infestation cannot be controlled after two or three weekly applications of insecticide, consider destroying the plant before the mealybugs spread to other plants in your home.\n\nMealybugs vs. Scale\n\nMealybugs are closely related to scale insects, but mealybugs are soft-bodied, rather than wearing the hard protective shells found on scale insects. Rather than the fluffy, cottony material, scale insects create a hard, barnacle-like coating on the leaves and stems of plants. The methods for getting rid of scale are very much the same as for mealybugs."
