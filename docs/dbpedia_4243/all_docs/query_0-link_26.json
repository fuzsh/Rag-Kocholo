        "text": "Cultural Control\n\nThere are a few options available to reduce scale insects and mealybugs without using pesticides. You can replace herbaceous annuals or perennials as well as small shrubs with plants that are not susceptible to the scale insect that is present. For this to work, you need professional identification of the scale you’re dealing with. Some scales can attack more than one plant type; identification helps to ensure that you make a good choice.\n\nAnother option is to use a consumer-grade pressure washer to remove some of the scale insects. Pressure washers can dislodge as many as 70 percent of these insects from plants. Keep in mind, however, that certain tips on consumer pressure washers can do more damage than good. The trick is to use a tip that is broad and not pinpoint. A pinpoint tip will severely or fatally injure plants, trees, and large shrubs. If properly timed, this technique can be used once or twice a year and can help to reduce unsightly sooty mold.\n\nChemical Control\n\nThe use of chemical insecticides to control scale insects is often required to avoid loss of the plant or to prevent the plant from becoming unsightly. Different insecticides may be required at different stages in the life of these insects.\n\nInsect Growth Regulators\n\nInsect growth regulators (IGRs) generally work by targeting the molting process in insects. This action limits the negative impacts on beneficial insects. IGRs are especially effective against scales when applied at the crawler stage. Multiple applications often are needed.\n\nWhen choosing a product, look for the active ingredient pyriproxyfen on the label (Distance is one example). Many products are labeled for application when crawlers are hatching. Knowing when to expect crawler hatch can improve results (table 1).\n\nSystemic and Translaminar Insecticides\n\nInsecticides that move into and within the whole plant are called ‘systemic’ (figure 25). Insecticides that move into and within the leaf on which they are applied are called ‘translaminar’ (figure 26).\n\nClick on the images below to view the full image.\n\nThe most widely used systemic insecticides contain the neonicotinoid class of insecticides. Insecticides with translaminar activity include those with the active ingredients acephate or abamectin."
