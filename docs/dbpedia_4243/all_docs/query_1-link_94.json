        "text": "Wine Australia is working with key stakeholders to develop research and innovation strategies to tackle scale and mealybug pests using co-design principles.\n\nScale and mealybug are estimated to cost Australian winegrape growers between $5–20 million each year. The insects feed on the grapevine, secreting honeydew that can serve as a substrate for black sooty mould. The insects can also transfer the viruses that cause Grapevine Leafroll disease and Shiraz disease.\n\nThe co-design process will be used to guide investment to develop sustainable management practices for scale and mealybug.\n\nThe co-design process started with two recent workshops, attended by vineyard owners and viticulturists; consultants, agronomists and advisors; researchers, entomologists and virologists; potential solution providers, and sector bodies including Wine Australia, Australian Grape & Wine and Vinehealth Australia.\n\nParticipants shared their current knowledge about the pests and existing management methods, and brainstormed innovative new strategies and solutions to deal with them.\n\nImage: AdobeStock\n\nSeven key priorities were identified in the workshops, including two clear top priorities – scale biology and lifecycle; and control options for scale (including a review of wine residue risk posed by late-season use of existing chemicals).\n\nOther high priority areas included investigating the role of scale and mealybug in virus spread; and biocontrol/ecological options for control of scale.\n\nAnna Hooper was part of the co-design process in her role as Manager, Industry Policy with Australian Grape & Wine.\n\nShe was very enthusiastic about the process and was confident it would provide strategies and solutions to deal with the insects in the future.\n\n“Scale and mealy bug have emerged as key issues for the wine sector, and knowledge gaps have made it difficult for growers to get effective control.”\n\n“Identifying that there was a problem that required further research was the easy part; gaining a full understanding of the issues and ensuring that research solutions will be well targeted to solving the problem is not as straightforward.”\n\nHowever, she said she was confident the co-design process would result in a path forward.\n\nImage: AdobeStock\n\nShe said while the co-design process might have involved a little more work, she was convinced it would pay dividends in the end results.\n\n“This was the first time that I have been involved in co-designing a research project with such meaningful sector engagement up front.\n\n“I would like to acknowledge the exceptional insight from sector participants and other experts who generously gave up their time to assist, including Dr Liz Waters and the team at Wine Australia for such a well-executed process.”\n\nHow does co-design work?\n\nCo-design is designing “with, not for” according to Dr Liz Waters, General Manager, Research and Innovation, Wine Australia,\n\n“Co-design is a participatory process that goes beyond consultation. It builds and strengthens an equal collaboration between people affected by a problem or opportunity (e.g. the end users of the solutions such as viticulturists) and those attempting to resolve it (e.g. the researchers, or suppliers, or both).\n\nDr Waters said the process is often iterative: “Potential solutions frequently need refining as new information becomes available.”"
