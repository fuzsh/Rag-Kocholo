        "text": "TREATMENT OPTIONS\n\nFor treating mealybugs, the three best insecticides are spirotetramat (Movento, IRAC 24), acetamiprid (Assail, IRAC 4A) and buprofezin (Centaur, IRAC 16). If the May spray is missed, acetamiprid can be effective against second generation crawlers in mid- to late July. However, Gill’s mealybugs in the Hanford area of the San Joaquin Valley are showing some resistance to acetamiprid.\n\nBuprofezin, in turn, should not be used later than March. The European Union (EU) rejects shipments with residues higher than the limit of 0.01 ppm for buprofezin. A good rotation to use all three products would be to apply spirotetramat in May/June of one year, followed by buprofezin in March and acetamiprid in May the next year.\n\nImidacloprid (Admire Pro, IRAC 4A) is less effective than the previous three insecticides, but its low cost (less than $10/acre) and ease of application through drip irrigation make it an acceptable choice with low mealybug populations. As with buprofezin, tolerances for residues are extremely low in the EU, so the Administrative Committee for Pistachios sets guidelines for its use. Growers can check with their processors on the current guidelines before applying imidacloprid.\n\nA 2021 insecticide study found that additional products did well against Gill’s mealybug: spirotetramat and acetamiprid, as before, plus spirotetramat + pyrifoxen\n\nPEST MANAGEMENT\n\n(Senstar, IRAC 24 & 7C), sulfoxaflor (Sequoia, IRAC 4C), flupyradifurone (Sivanto, IRAC 4D) and phosmet (Imidan, IRAC 1B). Pistachios, however, have since been removed from the sulfoxaflor label due to higher-than-expected residues.\n\nFurther two-spray trials showed that Movento in May plus Assail or Sequoia in July both worked well. In addition, afidopyropen (Sefina, IRAC 9) did well at double the prescribed rate, so the manufacturer is investigating getting the double rate approved for pistachios.\n\nTo prevent insect resistance, Haviland recommends rotating the insecticide from year to year, even if only one spray is used. For two sprays per year, the two should never be the same insecticide.\n\nPostharvest treatment is not recommended for two reasons. First, it may kill beneficial predators at the time they are most active; second, spraying is not worth the cost because more than 99% of the nymphs die in the winter anyway.\n\nCHALLENGES WITH RESISTANCE\n\nTreatment for Gill’s mealybug has become more complicated in the past few years. Numerous observations indicate that insecticides are not working as effectively as when they were first registered in the mid-2000s. When first launched, one application of any of these products was adequate for season-long control. Now, in some cases, a follow-up spray in late July is needed to kill the second generation of crawlers.\n\nThe population skyrockets in early August if not treated, so the timing of that July spray is crucial.\n\n“Once the nymphs are numerous and coated in wax, around Aug. 1, further spraying is useless,” Haviland said.\n\nTo ensure the spray is timely, the grower should monitor frequently for crawlers in late July and purchase product ahead of time.\n\nBIOLOGICAL OPTIONS\n\nBiological options are available for organic growers. Azadirachtin (Aza-Direct, a neem derivative) and Burkholderia spp. (Venerate, bacteria) applied in May, or azadirachtin in May and Burkholderia spp. applied in July, reduce the number of Gill’s mealybug by 60% to 80%.\n\nSome growers also release predatory lacewings. Research on lacewings has not found conclusive evidence that they are cost-effective for managing Gill’s mealybugs in pistachios.\n\nHaviland encourages growers to try new methods on their own, being sure to include an untreated control group for comparison. For example, try both May/June and July sprays on five acres and spray just in May/June on the rest of the acreage. Other treatments to test may include March treatments, releases of predators such as lacewing larvae, or conservation biocontrol that promotes natural enemy populations.\n\nApplying the current best practices and having new ones in the pipeline may help pistachio growers stay ahead of Gill’s mealybug."
