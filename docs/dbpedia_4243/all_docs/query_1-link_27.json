        "text": "Mealybugs are soft-bodied insects that do not look like insects but more like small ovals that are often covered with cottony white filaments. They are about 1/8th inch long, with pinkish or yellowish bodies. Since these insects are so small, it is best to view them through a 10x magnifying glass.\n\nThese insects can move throughout their lives. They infest all plant parts: feeder roots, root crowns, stems, twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Injured plants have discolored, wilted, and deformed leaves.\n\nMealybugs excrete large amounts of honeydew which provides an excellent medium for the growth of a black fungus called “sooty mold” – refer to sooty mold article – https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/monroeco/2008/07/23/what-is-that-black-stuff-on-my-plant-leaves/\n\nWhen looking for this insect if you are seeing sooty mold on the upper leaf surface then examine the bottom of the leaf above for the mealybug. If you need any help in identifying the insect, contact your County Extension Agent. For those living in the Florida Keys you can contact Kim Gabel at kgabel@ufl.edu\n\nThe least toxic mealybug control methods are:\n\nUse strong stream of water to blast off the mealybug but not the leaves\n\nUse insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils (read and follow all label directions)\n\nPrune and remove the branch with the mealybugs\n\nLook for beneficial insects that are eating the mealybugs (Green Lacewings, Mealybug Destroyers) or tiny wasps that lay their eggs on live mealybugs that then become a food source for the wasp\n\nFor more information please refer to the following University of Florida Extension fact sheets:\n\nhttp://edistt.ifas.ufl.edu/mg005\n\nhttp://ufdc.ufl.edu/l/IR00002883/00001\n\n(Note: This publication was last reviewed in 2004 and has been archived)\n\nThis blog article was reviewed and updated in June, 2013.\n\nPhoto Credit: Kim Gabel, UF/IFAS"
