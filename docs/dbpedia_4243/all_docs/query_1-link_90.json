        "text": "Mealybugs are scale insect pests belonging to the family Pseudococcidae which tend to live together in clusters in plant parts. They suck sap from plants and excrete the excess sugars as a substance called honeydew, which facilitates the development s sooty mold. They also act as vectors for various plant diseases.\n\nDistribution & Host Range\n\nMealybugs attack both indoor and outdoor plants.\n\nThey are found in all parts of the world but mostly occur naturally in warmer regions.\n\nThese insect pests have a wide range of cultivated plants, both broadleaved and grasses. For example. Fruit trees, vegetables, ornamentals, etc.\n\nIdentification of Mealybugs\n\nGenerally, mealybugs are small, soft-bodied sucking insects with a characteristic cottony appearance. Adult mealybugs are mostly found on leaves, stems and roots in colonies and are covered with whitish masses, which makes them difficult to eradicate.\n\nHowever, different mealybug species have varied characteristics.\n\nFor example;\n\nCitrus mealybug (Planococcus citri) – anal filaments are less than one-eighth the length of the body. This species produces an egg mass which is irregular and remains under body of female.\n\nSolanum mealybug (Phenacoccus solani) – body is covered with very short waxy filaments. Long tails and stripes on the body are absent. This species does not produce an egg mass or ovisac.\n\nMango Mealybug (Drosicha mangiferae) – females can be identified by their flat shape, covered with white mealy powder.\n\nPineapple mealybug (Dysmicoccus brevipes) – this species is associated with roots of host plants. Body color is light pink to grey and has 17 pairs of wax filaments.\n\nBiology\n\nMealybugs are sexually dimorphic, females are wingless while males are smaller and have wings.\n\nThis insect pest does not undergo a complete metamorphosis.\n\nThe mature female lays eggs in an egg sac of white wax, usually in clusters on the twigs, branches, or bark of the host plant but sometimes on the plant’s leaves and terminal ends.\n\nThe eggs are small in size varying from 0.3 to 0.4mm in length and their development takes between 3 and 9 days.\n\nAn individual mealybug may takes approximately 30 days to grow through all the nympal stages under normal conditions.\n\nMealybugs can withstand cold conditions as eggs and other life stages, both on the host plant and in the soil. In warm climates; the insects stay active and reproduce round the year.\n\nFeeding & Damage\n\nMealybugs feed on plant parts through piercing and sucking. Both nymphs and adults suck the sap causing withering and yellowing of leaves while fruits may drop prematurely. Heavy infestation can cause defoliation and even death of the plant.\n\nInfested growing points become stunted and swollen. Severity of infection depends on the susceptibility of the host species.\n\nHeavy clustering of mealybugs can be seen under leaf surface giving the appearance of a thick mat with waxy secretion.\n\nWhile feeding, they excrete copious amount of honey dew that attracts ants. The honey dew facilitates for the development of black sooty mold on leaf surfaces. This inhibits photosynthesis. Mealybugs also affect the development of flowers and stems especially in succulents with fleshy stems.\n\nInfested fruits can be entirely covered with the white, waxy coating of the mealybug, and this can cause shriveling of the fruits.\n\nSurvival\n\nMealybugs have the ability to overwinter and can live for relatively long periods without water or food. They can survive cold conditions both on host plants and in soil. Their broad host range gives a survival advantage.\n\nManagement\n\nInfestation by these pests can cause up to 100% crop loss if not controlled. Therefore, it is very important to eradicate mealybugs.\n\nThere are several ways that can be used to manage and control this pest as follows;\n\nChemical Control\n\nTo effectively control mealybugs, the chosen insecticide should have a systemic characteristic.\n\nThe following products are therefore fit for the control of this pest;\n\nEMERALD 10ml/20l\n\nLOYALTY 5g/20l\n\nAMAZING TOP 5g/20l\n\nLEXUS 8ml/20l\n\nNB: Always mix the insecticide with INTEGRA 3ml/20l.\n\nIntegra ensures that the products you spray sticks to the leaves and stem, spreads to all areas of the leave and penetrates to the underside of the leaf.\n\nTo cleanse the sooty mold, spray JAMBO CLEAN 100ml/20l.\n\nCultural Control\n\nThis involves the following;\n\nRemoval of all the infested materials from the field.\n\nCrop rotation with non-host plants\n\nEnsuring field sanitation\n\nField borders should be free from weeds and debris that may harbor this pest.\n\nStar Grass\n\nStar grass (Cynodon aethiopicus) is a warm climate noxious weed with an extensive system of creeping rhizomes and stolons. It belongs to the poaceae family.\n\nSeptoria Leaf Spot of Tomato\n\nSeptoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici and is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage. Infection can occur at\n\nFarmers’ contribution to the effects of pesticides on human health\n\nThe adoption and application of safety measures are necessary to avoid the detrimental effects of pesticides. That is, the right balance between the need to\n\nClub Root of Crucifers\n\nClub root, also known as swollen fingers amongst other names is a serious fungal mould type of disease caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae\n\nInsect and disease management in cereals\n\nIn this month’s edition we are going to highlight some important insects and diseases that pose a threat to cereal crops and recommend control measures.\n\nBlack Rot of Crucifers\n\nBlack rot is a bacterial disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, which is considered the most serious disease of crucifer crops.
