        "text": "Female mealybugs do not fly or crawl far, so they are usually brought in on an affected plant. Inspect new plants carefully before putting them in a greenhouse or conservatory and, where possible, keep them in quarantine (isolated from other plants) for at least a month before adding new acquisitions to an existing collection.\n\nCheck susceptible plants frequently so action can be taken before a damaging population has developed. When choosing control options you can minimise harm to non-target animals by using the methods in the non-pesticide section below. Pesticide treatments are likely to kill natural enemies and are only likely to be successful if the entire plant can be reached.\n\nNon-pesticide\n\nDead leaves and pruning’s should be removed from the greenhouse as these may have mealybugs or eggs on them\n\nIt can be simpler to dispose of heavily affected plants rather than try to eliminate mealybugs\n\nPlant can tolerate some levels of mealybug, although populations can quickly build if left unchecked\n\nBiological control\n\nA ladybird, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, can be released into greenhouses to control mealybugs. Note that the ladybird's larvae look like large mealybugs! Both the adult ladybirds and their larvae are able to find and eat mealybugs and their eggs in confined spaces on the plants. Parasitic wasps (Leptomastix spp., Leptomastidea spp. and Anagrus spp.) are also sometimes available for use against these insects. The parasitic wasps can give control of mealybug populations where population levels are fairly low.\n\nThe ladybird and parasitic wasps need relatively high temperatures and so are only likely to be successful during May to September. They are susceptible to insecticides and should therefore be used as an alternative, rather than in addition to pesticide control. They are available by mail order from suppliers of biological controls.\n\n.\n\nPesticides\n\nThe RHS recommends that you don't use pesticides. Most pesticides (including organic types) reduce biodiversity, including natural enemies, impact soil health and have wider adverse environmental effects.\n\nWhere you cannot tolerate mealybugs, manage them using the information above as your first course of action.\n\nPesticide treatments are likely to kill natural enemies and so reduce the likelihood of natural control and can lead to resurgence of the target animal.\n\nIf you do decide to use pesticides, the shorter persistence products (that are usually certified for organic growing) are likely to be less damaging to non-target wildlife.\n\nThe pesticides listed are legally available in the UK. This information is provided to avoid misuse of legal products and the use of unauthorised and untested products, which potentially has more serious consequences for the environment and wildlife than when products are used legally.\n\nAlways follow the instructions on the products. For edible plants, make sure the food plant is listed on the label and follow instructions on maximum number of applications, spray interval and harvest interval.\n\nHomemade products are not recommended as they are unregulated and usually untested.\n\nBe aware that products such as Neem oil are not registered for use in the UK and we cannot advise on their use.\n\nPlants in flower must not be sprayed due to the danger to bees and other pollinating insects.\n\nDue partly to the waxy covering mealybugs are difficult to control with insecticides, affected plants should be sprayed thoroughly. In many cases it may be impossible to eliminate mealybugs.\n\nOrganic sprays, such as natural pyrethrum (e.g. Bug Clear Ultra 2, Neudorff Bug Free Bug and Larvae Killer) or plant oils (e.g. Vitax Plant Guard Pest & Disease Control, Bug Clear Fruit & Veg, Vitax Rose Guard) have a largely physical mode of action and can give control of mealybugs.These are broad spectrum so will kill a wide range of insects. These pesticides have a very short persistence and so may require reapplication to keep mealybugs numbers in check. Plant oil and fatty acid products are less likely to affect larger insects such as ladybird adults\n\nPlant invigorators combine nutrients to stimulate plant growth with surfactants or fatty acids that have a physical mode of action against mealybugs (e.g. Ecofective Bug Control, Growing Success Bug Stop, RoseClear 3 in 1 Action and SB Plant Invigorator). These products contain some synthetic ingredients and so are not considered organic\n\nMore persistent contact-action insecticides include the synthetic pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin (e.g. Resolva Bug Killer), deltamethrin (e.g. Provanto Ultimate Fruit & Vegetable Bug Killer, Provanto Sprayday Greenfly Killer) and cypermethrin (e.g. Py Bug Killer). Permethrin is available as a smoke formulation for use in glasshouses (e.g. DeadFast Greenhouse Smoke Fumigator)These products have long lasting action against insects including those that are beneficial\n\nPesticides, with both systemic (absorbed and transported through plant tissues) and contact action, are available. These include Flupyradifurone (Provanto Smart Bug Killer) for use on ornamentals and selected edibles and the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid (e.g. Bug Clear Ultra). These pesticides are widely considered to be the most environmentally damaging, remain active for a long time and will kill beneficial invertebrates\n\nFurther information about the use of pesticides available for management of mealybugs is available on the pesticides for gardeners leaflet\n\nInclusion of a pesticide product does not indicate a recommendation or endorsement by RHS Gardening Advice. It is a list of products currently available to the home gardener.\n\nDownloads\n\nPesticides for gardeners (pdf document)\n\nBiological control suppliers (pdf document)\n\nSeveral species of mealybug occur in greenhouses or on houseplants. These include Pseudococcus calceolariae (Glasshouse mealybug), P. longispinus (Long tailed mealybug) and Planococcus citri (citrus mealybug) and Rhizoecus species (root mealybugs).\n\nThe adult females have flattened oval-shaped soft bodies up to 4mm in length; they are sometimes pink in colour but appear whitish due to the white, waxy powder that covers their bodies. Waxy filaments project from the edges of their bodies. Some species are all female; others have small winged males, but the latter are infrequently seen.\n\nFemale mealybugs lay eggs under a white, waxy coating. Mealybug nymphs resemble the adult insects and can complete their development in about a month in mid-summer. Breeding continues throughout the year in greenhouses, but takes place at a slower rate in winter."
