        "text": "Papaya mealybug (Paracoccus marginatus) is an invasive insect pest that spreads rapidly.\n\nIt forms large infestation on leaves, fruit and stems of host plants such as papaya, frangipani and hibiscus.\n\nIt is a threat to commercial papaya production, as well as backyard trees.\n\nThere is no threat to humans posed by this pest.\n\nLocation\n\nPapaya mealybug was first reported in July 2023 and has widely spread through Darwin, Palmerston and Howard Springs.\n\nAppearance\n\nPapaya mealybug can be easily mistaken for other species of insects.\n\nKey characteristics of the papaya mealybug include:\n\n2mm to 3.5mm long\n\nyellow body covered in white wax with a fringe of short filaments\n\nround yellow eggs laid inside an egg sac\n\nvery sticky wax with lots of honeydew\n\npresence of sooty mould on the infested plant.\n\nSpread\n\nPapaya mealybug crawlers have a limited range of natural spread to neighbouring plants.\n\nStrong winds may increase this range, as well as movement of infected plants, soils and fruits.\n\nTo prevent further spread, you should not transport infected plants. Follow the control measures below.\n\nSymptoms\n\nHeavy infestations of papaya mealybug cause a range of symptoms including:\n\nleaf chlorosis, deformation or crinkling\n\npremature aging of leaves\n\nflowers and fruit may be underdeveloped or may drop under sever infestation\n\nsooty mould formation around mealybug honeydew secretions\n\nthick white, sticky waxy coating on leaves, stems and fruit.\n\nControl measures\n\nIf you have infected plants or trees, keep them in your garden.\n\nThis helps the papaya mealybug's natural enemies to emerge and keep them under control, such as:\n\nnative mealybug ladybird (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri):\n\nfor a list of suppliers, go to the Good Bugs website\n\nladybird, lacewing or hover fly larvae\n\nparasitoid wasp (Acerophagus papayae) - originally from Central America, arrived with mealybug.\n\nYou can also spray an oil or soap-based pesticide to kill papaya mealybug.\n\nEven if they're dead, they will remain on the plant. Scrape back the waxy coating to see if they're still alive.\n\nWhen using any pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow all label instructions.\n\nSubmit a sample\n\nAs papaya mealybug is now widely spread, reporting is no longer required.\n\nIf you wish, you can still submit a sample in a sealed bag to be tested at:\n\nDITT Entomology\n\nBerrimah Agricultural Laboratories\n\nBerrimah Farm, Darwin NT\n\nPhone: 08 8999 2258\n\nYou can also email photos to insectinfo@nt.gov.au.\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy link\n\nURL copied!"
