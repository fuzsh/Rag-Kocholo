They’re oval in shape and they’re covered with this white, mealy wax, which is where they get their name, mealybug.”\nShe says heavy infestations can lead to browning, even death of the plant.\n“A lot of times when people bring potted plants from outside indoors, then they’re kind of infesting their house,” Brown says. “And sometimes they might be on poinsettias that people buy at the store at certain times of the year. So always check your plants and make sure they are mealybug-free before you bring them home with you.”\n \nWritten by Jen Rice. \n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t \n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t \n\nShare this story with a friend:FacebookXEmail",
