        "text": "Mealybug Treatments\n\nCryptolaemus was one of the first discoveries in the science of biological control. This little beetle known as \"the Australian Ladybird\" was first exported from Australia to California in 1891 to control citrus mealybug.\n\nThe larvae hatch out as voracious predators of mealybugs. Young larvae and adults prefer the smaller stages of mealybug, whereas the large larvae will eat mealybugs of any size. If mealybug is in short supply, Crytpolaemus may also eat young scale insects."
