        "text": "If you have detected scale insects that are still active, it’s time to take action. A few options are available and depend partly on whether your problem is inside or outdoors.\n\nPrevention\n\nScale insects can come from many sources, and eliminating them is impractical. Your best bet is healthy soil to keep your plants vigorous and some good old-fashioned monitoring to catch them early.\n\nKeep an eye on your houseplants and spend time walking your garden and yard. When you have a good feel for what “normal” is, you can more easily spot a change. Proper monitoring is an integral part of integrated pest management.\n\nInvestigate yellowing leaves promptly.\n\nOutdoors, minimize the use of pesticides that may harm populations of beneficial, predatory insects like ladybugs.\n\nDispose of heavily infected plant material to limit new generations of scale insects.\n\nClosely inspect new plants when purchased, especially under leaves and between stems. Quarantine away from other plants if in doubt.\n\nIndoor Scale Control & Treatment\n\nA severely damaged plant may need to be disposed of, but less infested plants can be given some TLC.\n\nUse a Toothbrush\n\nGrab a soft-bristled toothbrush and some soapy water and start doing what your dentist taught you, only to your plant. A gentle brushing will often remove many adults and most crawlers. Moving your plant to the sink or shower may be less messy.\n\nTry to avoid over-wetting the soil, and use warm soapy water. You can also use a 70% solution of isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs, dabbing them directly on the insects. Several treatments may be necessary to finally get them all.\n\nBrushing will also clean up some of the messy honeydew.\n\nInsecticidal Soaps and Horticultural Oils\n\nInsecticidal soaps and horticultural oils are minimally effective against adult scale due to their waxy coatings. However, they are effective for controlling the crawlers (young scale) and thereby limiting the next generation. These types of treatments can often be found a local garden center or supply store. Apply to the undersides of leaves and stems, and repeat weekly for several weeks.\n\nOutdoor Scale Control & Treatment\n\nRemoval\n\nAn infested tree or shrub may be pruned, and the infected branches removed and destroyed. Scale insects are not very mobile, so mechanical methods can work. Infected branches of larger garden plants can be trimmed off as well.\n\nDon’t throw them in the compost! Scale insects can overwinter as eggs under the shells.\n\nInsecticidal Soaps and Horticultural Oils\n\nInsecticidal soaps and horticultural oils can control crawlers in the garden, orchard, or yard. Neem oil is also effective. Apply either solution weekly for at least 3 weeks to get control. Be cautious and do not overuse. Some of these chemicals can harm bees and other beneficial insects as well, so avoid spraying around flowers or when beneficial insects are spotted.\n\nDead scale insects will not fall off the plant. To check if they are dead or alive, rub them with your thumbnail. Dead scale insects will be dehydrated and flake off. Live ones will smear.\n\nMix your Neem oil or insecticidal soaps and oils in a pump sprayer for a more practical application. Try to avoid spraying on drought-stressed plants, as it can worsen their condition.\n\nEncourage Beneficial Insects\n\nParasitic wasps, lacewings, ladybugs, and other predators can keep scale insects under control. If you have a large garden or orchard, these can be your best line of defense. Parasitic wasps will lay eggs in the scale insect; their larvae eat it before emerging. Ladybugs have a voracious appetite and will eat hundreds of scale insects, aphids, and other pests.\n\nYou can encourage beneficial insects by planting pollinator patches or strips to provide habitat and food when there are insufficient levels of prey insects. If they can’t find food, they may relocate and leave you on the battlefield alone!"
