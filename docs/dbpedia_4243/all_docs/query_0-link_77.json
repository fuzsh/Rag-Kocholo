        "meta_description": "As their name indicates, the main host for Citrus Mealybugs (Planococcus citri) is citrus. However, they can also be found on many other hosts plants, including fruit trees, roses and other flowers, cucumbers, melons and all sorts of ornamentals. Citrus Mealybugs are partial to humid environments, which makes them a problem for greenhouse horticulture. In tropical and sub-tropical locales where humidity is high, many outdoor crops are at risk. \r\nCitrus Mealybugs congregate where fruits touch each other, and they move between the fruit and through the tree. They extract sap, which affects tree vigor and secrete honeydew, which attracts ants and provides a surface that encourages the growth of Sooty Mold. The damage caused by these insects can be extensive. Fruit drop, galls, stunted growth, deformities, the appearance of fungal diseases, lower yields, and yellowing of leaves are just some of them. For ornamental plants and fruit crops anything that causes them to be unsightly will ruin the crop, so mealybugs present a strong danger to the economic stability of growers.\r\nThe best method for controlling citrus mealybug is prevention, as it can be extremely difficult once the insects have made a home inside a greenhouse or garden. Keeping trees pruned so that they do not touch, disinfecting tools after each use, and introducing beneficials that will prey upon them are all recommended actions. It's also important to eliminate future generations by getting rid of the males before they reproduce. To this end, deploying lures that mimic the female insects' pheromones work well. As males pick up the scent, they are drawn to the lure's location inside the trap where they meet their end on the sticky surface.\r\nThe Pest Wizard Citrus Mealybug Trap Kit comes with 2 disposable red paper delta traps coated with MessyLess Adhesive™ and a lure that selectively attracts male Citrus Mealybugs. The lure is effective for up to 30 days. If traps become covered with insects or debris before that time, remove the lure and attach it to a fresh trap. When the lifespan of the lure is complete and the season is still active, replace lure and sticky trap with new ones. Replacement lures and additional red paper delta traps are available. \r\nNon-toxic pheromone lure and adhesive\r\nLow risk to beneficials\r\nResults may vary due to seasonal changes, insect pest population variations, natural predator populations, correct or incorrect trap installation, proper lure storage, weather extremes, disruption, damage and/or contamination due to chemical sprays, pets, children, sprinklers, or other unforeseen events.\r\nSome beneficial insects may land on the sticky traps. But, by comparison, toxic insecticides totally annihilate all insects and will harm or kill outright other wildlife. Not to mention children and pets.\r\n\r\nShop All Pest Wizard Products here.",
