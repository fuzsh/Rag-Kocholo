        "text": "Crystal Palace FC become a member of the Football League in 1920, after 15 years in the Southern League. They reached the Division One for the first time in 1969 and the best position was achieved in 1991 with a third place. They have reached the FA Cup final two times without winning it. In the 2000s the club was going through a lot of economical struggles and several owner shifts have occurred.\n\nHistory\n\nThe club was established in 1905. The first version of Crystal Palace, also named Crystal Palace FC, was formed by workers at Crystal Palace, the enormous exhibition hall constructed in glass. This club was, however, dissolved in the 1870s. A second club with the same name was founded in 1905, in conjunction to the football arena Crystal Palace what were built in 1894.\n\nWhen the Football League was expanded with a third tier to the 1920-21 season, Crystal Palace was one of the elected clubs. It lead to instant success: the London team won the Third Division before Southampton and Queens Park Rangers and was the only team promoted to the Second Division.\n\nBy Oscar Anderson\n\nAdvertisement"
