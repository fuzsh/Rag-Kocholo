        "text": "Manchester City could face expulsion from the Premier League or a points deduction if the club are found to have committed breaches of financial rules.\n\nAfter a four-year investigation, the Premier League has referred a number of alleged breaches to an independent Commission.\n\nIt is alleged that Manchester City broke rules relating to the provision of “accurate financial information” across nine Premier League seasons from 2009 to 2018, and that the club had failed to cooperate with the league’s investigation since the start of the 2018-19 campaign, among wide-ranging alleged breaches.\n\nA statement from the league alleged that the club had failed to reflect a “true and fair view” of their financial position, “in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs”.\n\nA Commission will now be appointed by the chair of the Premier League’s Judicial Panel, with proceedings to be held in private and confidentially, with only their final decision published.\n\nUnder Premier League regulation W51, the Commision is empowered to reprimand Manchester City with a number of sanctions, including recommending that the Premier League “expels” the club.\n\nThe Commission can also impose a points deduction and an unlimited fine if breaches are proven.\n\nOther allegations of wrongdoing made by the Premier League relate to improper disclosure of remuneration, including Roberto Mancini’s contract during his time as Manchester City manager, and player remuneration between the 2010-11 and 2015-16 seasons.\n\nIt is also alleged that the club broke rules when making approaches to young players, and may have failed to comply with Uefa financial fair play (FFP) regulations for several seasons.\n\n“Commissions are independent of the Premier League and member clubs,” the statement from the English top flight continued.\n\n“The members of the commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel, in accordance with Premier League Rules W.19, W.20 and W.26.\n\n“The proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission’s final award will be published on the Premier League’s website.”\n\nIn 2020, Manchester City overturned a two-year Champions League ban for a serious breach of Uefa’s financial rules at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nCas found that, while the club had failed to comply with Uefa’s investigations, many of the alleged breaches were either “not established” or “time-barred”.\n\nThe Premier League does not time-bar breaches - there is no restriction on the length of time since alleged offences have taken place.\n\n1.
