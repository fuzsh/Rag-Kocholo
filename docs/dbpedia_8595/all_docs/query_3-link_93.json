        "text": "Richard Keys broke down the details of Manchester City's 115 FFP charges live on-air before their 2-0 win over Tottenham on Tuesday night.\n\nThe crucial victory, spearheaded by Erling Haaland's brace, lifted Pep Guardiola's side into pole position in the Premier League title race, two points clear of Arsenal ahead of their final league game of the season against West Ham.\n\nBut Keys told beIN Sports that he felt the potential top-flight success - which would be the club's fourth league title in a row - would be tainted by the ongoing financial investigation surrounding Man City.\n\nKeys said: 'The problem remains, it all comes with an asterisk.'\n\nHe later read out the charges that Man City are facing: '54 failures to provide accurate financial information between 2009-10 to 2018. 14 failures to provide accurate details for player and manager payments. Five failures to comply with UEFAâs rules including Financial Fair Play 2013-14 to 17-18. Seven breaches of the Premier Leagueâs PSR rules 2015, 16, 17, 18. 35 failures to co-operate with the Premier Leagueâs investigations from December 2018 onwards â thatâs the charge sheet.'\n\nHe believes that Man City fans would want the outcome of this process to be decided quickly, to properly celebrate their historic success if there is no wrongdoing, before adding: 'If they are found guilty, it dilutes everything they've done'.\n\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Jason McAteer, who also appeared on beIN Sports' coverage, responded: 'My team have been hot on their heels. It does stick in your throat when you think how close we got to Man City and how many titles we could have won.\n\n'Then you look at the circumstances where they have been able to spend what they want. Theyâve had fantastic lawyers and even better accountants.'\n\nManchester City are awaiting the outcome of 115 charges brought against them by the Premier League at the start of 2023, for regulation breeches across 14 seasons from 2009-10 onwards.\n\nThe charges include claims over financial reporting, and a lack of co-operation with a Premier League investigation which was opened in 2018.\n\nPremier League CEO Richard Masters said a trial date for Man City's case was set in January, but it has not yet been revealed when it would take place.\n\nMail Sport reported last year that the 'trial of the century' was pencilled in for late 2024, with a verdict not expected until at least the summer of 2025.\n\nManchester City deny any wrongdoing."
