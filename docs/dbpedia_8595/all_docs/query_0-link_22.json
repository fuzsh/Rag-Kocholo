        "text": "Sky Sports News' chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol reflects on the charges over Man City's alleged breaches of Premier League financial rules...\n\nThis article was first published in February 2023 and has since been updated.\n\nWhat are the charges against Man City?\n\nManchester City have been charged with breaking financial fair play rules around 100 times over a nine-year period, which started in 2009 and went on until 2018.\n\nDuring that period, Man City, who have denied all the charges against them, won the Premier League three times.\n\nThe Premier League's financial fair play rules are designed to ensure clubs pretty much spend what they earn. You can get around that potentially by inflating how much you're earning or hiding how much you are spending.\n\nAccording to the Premier League, Man City broke the rules over nine seasons by allegedly failing to provide accurate financial information.\n\nAmong the charges against City are that they didn't fully disclose the financial remunerations that were made to one of their managers over a four-year period. The suggestion is that there was a secret contract so one of the managers was getting paid much more than officially stated.\n\nThe Premier League also allege Man City didn't comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules over a five-year period. They also allege that Man City have not fully co-operated with the Premier League's investigation.\n\nWhat are the possible punishments?\n\nAccording to Premier League rules, it can be a points deduction or even the threat of expulsion from the Premier League, although I think that would be an extreme punishment.\n\nBut a points deduction would only be applied be in the current season.\n\nWhat do rival clubs make of it all?\n\nMany Premier League clubs want City to be relegated if they are found guilty of breaking rules over nine seasons.\n\nThere is a feeling among top-flight clubs that taking away City's titles retrospectively would be meaningless and cause confusion, but a fine is also not likely to have much of an effect, either.\n\nThe clubs who had been pressing hardest for action were the other members of the so-called 'big six': Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nThere will not be much sympathy for City, who have won the Premier League six times in the last 11 years, if they are found guilty.\n\nHow did the investigation begin?\n\nThe only reason this all came to light was five years ago, German outlet Der Spiegel published an investigation which was based on the work of a Portuguese computer hacker Rui Pinto, who had hacked into the email accounts of various football clubs and agents. It was this story that started the UEFA investigation into Man City, which also led to this Premier League investigation.\n\nMan City issued a statement at the time the charges were brought, which read: \"Manchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.\n\n\"The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position.\n\n\"As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.\"\n\nCan City appeal?\n\nThe independent commission will be formed of three members, who will be selected by Murray Rosen KC, the chair of the Premier League's judicial panel.\n\nThe three-person panel can include any of the 15 members of the judicial panel, as well as non-members.\n\nOnce a judgement is made, the Premier League and Man City will be able to appeal - although it cannot be taken to the CAS.\n\nInstead, Rosen would appoint an appeal panel made up of new members. There are currently six members of the Premier League appeal panel.\n\nWho will be on the panel?\n\nStephen Taylor Heath, JMW head of sports law, speaking to Sky Sports News:\n\n\"The commission will have a legal representative on the panel, and you'd expect that representative to be a pretty heavyweight King's Counsel.\n\n\"Manchester City have had an obligation to comply with the Premier League's investigation and they now have an obligation to comply with the commission's procedure. If they don't comply then a dim view will be taken.\n\n\"If the charges relate to administrative errors then the sanctions will be a slap on the wrist. You would think, if the Premier League have taken it this far, they either think there is a case to answer or they've simply got to the point where they haven't been given the answers, and they're now putting it to a commission to get those answers.\"\n\nWhat could the ramifications be for other Premier League clubs?\n\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire speaking to Sky Sports News:\n\n\"If you talk to lawyers, they say it would be difficult for another club to say they lost a title or, perhaps more importantly, access to the Champions League and all the rewards that it brings.\n\n\"There was talk not too long ago about Burnley and Leeds potentially putting in a claim against Everton with regards to their financial scenario, although that was never crystallised.\n\n\"Everybody is going to be watching this with a huge amount of interest and once independent commission makes a judgement, things will move on from there.\""
