He has overseen 53 victories in the previous 99 matches.\n\nFormer Reds boss Roy Hodgson will be the fourth different Palace manager Klopp has faced. Alan Pardew, Sam Allardyce and Frank de Boer are the others.\n\nIn the last seven league visits to Selhurst Park, Liverpool have found the net 19 times.\n\nThe Reds' biggest ever top-flight league win came against Palace in September 1989, when eight different men found the net in a 9-0 victory.\n\nNathaniel Clyne played 137 times for Palace during four seasons with the club and the Liverpool right-back could make his first appearance of the 2017-18 campaign against the Eagles after recovering from injury.\n\nSadio Mane has scored four times in seven games against Palace in his career.\n\nJoel Matip scored his first Liverpool goal in the 4-2 win at Selhurst Park in October 2016.\n\nJames Milner was sent off at Palace in March 2016 with the Reds trailing 1-0, but Christian Benteke's stoppage-time strike to make it 2-1 meant it was the first ever known occasion that Liverpool had come from behind with 10 men to win a game.\n\nBenteke, who made 42 appearances for the Reds, has netted six times against LFC in the league during his career - only eight players have scored more against Liverpool in the Premier League era."
