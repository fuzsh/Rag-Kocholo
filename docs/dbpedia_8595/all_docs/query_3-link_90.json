Manchester City won the Premier League three times during that period.\n\nThe Premier League said the alleged breaches referred to “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position” in particular its “revenue”, “sponsorship revenue” and “operating costs” and potential punishments range from fines to points deductions or even expulsion from the league.\n\nThe Premier League listed over 100 breaches of its rules during the nine-season period, and the club released an official statement in response saying they are “surprised” by the allegations, given the “extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials” they have provided but “welcome the review” and “ look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.”\n\nFollow all the latest updates with our live blog below:\n\nMan City acused of breaching Premier League financial rules\n\nMan City charged with breaching Premier League financial rules\n\nThe club is accused of over 100 breaches between 2009 and 2018 after a four-year investigation by Premier League\n\nCity also accused of not co-operating with the investigation from December 2018\n\nA Man City club statement says they are “surprised” by the charges and confident of being exonerated\n\nWill football’s richest club escape punishment again?\n\nFootball’s landmark moment and how white paper can change game forever\n\nMan City statement after being charged with over 100 financial rule breaches\n\n17:55 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City insist they are “surprised” at being charged by the Premier League with more than 100 alleged breaches of financial regulations.\n\nThe reigning champions could potentially be hit with a points deduction or even expulsion from the league if found guilty following a four-year investigation.\n\nThe unprecedented series of allegations from Premier League concerns a nine-year period from 2009 to 2018, with the club insisting there is “irrefutable evidence” to prove their innocence.\n\nMan City statement after unprecedented Premier League charges\n\nPremier League ‘expulsion’ among possible Man City punishments for alleged financial breaches\n\n17:40 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City could face expulsion from the Premier League or a points deduction if the club are found to have committed breaches of financial rules.\n\nAfter a four-year investigation, the Premier League has referred a number of alleged breaches to an independent Commission.\n\nIt is alleged that Manchester City broke rules relating to the provision of “accurate financial information” across nine Premier League seasons from 2009 to 2018, and that the club had failed to cooperate with the league’s investigation since the start of the 2018-19 campaign, among wide-ranging alleged breaches.\n\nA statement from the league alleged that the club had failed to reflect a “true and fair view” of their financial position, “in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs”.\n\nWhat are Man City’s possible punishments for alleged finance breaches?\n\nWhich rules have Man City been accused of breaking?\n\n17:25 , Michael Jones\n\nExpulsion from the Premier League is on the table for Manchester City after being accused of breaching more than 100 financial rules.\n\nThe Premier League has concluded a four-year investigation and has now referred a number of the alleged breaches to an independent Commission.\n\nHaving successfully overturned a two-year ban from Uefa in July 2020, City are now tasked with another battle to save their reputation.\n\nThe champions are alleged to have broken rules relating to the provision of “accurate financial information” across nine Premier League seasons from 2009 to 2018, and that the club had failed to cooperate with the league’s investigation since the start of the 2018/19 campaign, among wide-ranging alleged breaches.\n\nWhich rules have Man City been accused of breaking?\n\nMan City charged with over 100 breaches of financial rules after four-year investigation\n\n17:10 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City have been charged by the Premier League with over 100 breaches of their financial rules.\n\nIt follows a four-year investigation into the finances of the current Premier League champions.\n\nIn an unprecedented series of allegations, the Premier League said the breaches referred to a requirement to provide “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position” in particular its “revenue”, “sponsorship revenue” and “operating costs”.\n\nManchester City announced their “surprise” at the Premier League’s statement and denied the charges. The club insisted there is “irrefutable evidence” to prove their innocence.\n\nMan City charged with over 100 breaches of Premier League rules\n\nFootball’s landmark moment and how white paper can change game forever\n\n16:55 , Michael Jones\n\nIn the discussions to inform next week’s white paper on football, many stakeholders were attempting to get the government to understand this is much more than a “once a generation” moment. They described it as possibly the only opportunity to properly assess the English game and where it’s going, since nothing like this has ever been done before. It is quite a thought, that illustrates the “enormity” of what this government are taking on. In 160 years of codified English football, there has never been anything like an attempt at a holistic assessment of the sport and what it should look like.\n\nEven events since the Super League, like Chelsea’s spending, illustrate it is now more important than ever. There are reservations within the game over whether Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Michelle Donelan gets this, as eyebrows were raised over recent statements and questions.\n\n“This is a really important opportunity for football,” says Niall Couper of Fair Game, “but the most important thing is it has to have teeth.”\n\nThe landmark moment that can change football forever\n\nIndependent commission proceedings to go ahead in private\n\n16:45 , Michael Jones\n\nThe independent commission tasked with figuring out whether Manchester City broke any Premier League financial rules will undergo their proceedings in a confidential and private manner.\n\nA Premier League statement announcing the referrals said: “The proceedings before the commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the commission’s final award will be published on the Premier League’s website.\n\n“This confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice.”\n\nMan City unhappy with Premier League’s announcement\n\n16:34 , Michael Jones\n\nThe BBC’s Simon Stone says Manchester City are confident about their position in this case though the club are unhappy that the Premier League gave them no warning that an announcement was being made.\n\nHe says: “Man City were not given advance warning of the Premier League statement.\n\n“They were called at the same time as the statement went out. They believe some journalists were given advance warning of the statement, which evidently, they are not impressed about.\n\n“They also note the timing of the statement given the White Paper on football governance is scheduled to be published soon. It is felt that bringing this case it likely to be used by the Premier League as evidence of them being able to deal with governance issues itself.\n\n“City are confident in their position and that includes the charges that were time-barred in their Uefa case. The club are understood to have provided the relevant evidence around those charges to the Premier League some time ago.”\n\nMan City’s alleged breaches of Premier League rules\n\n16:26 , Michael Jones\n\n1.

In respect of the period from December 2018 to date, the Premier League Rules applicable in the relevant Seasons requiring a member club to cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations, including by providing documents and information to the Premier League in the utmost good faith, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2018/19, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;\n\n(b) for Season 2019/20, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;\n\n(c) for Season 2020/21, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;\n\n(d) for Season 2021/22, Premier League Rules B.15, B.18, W.1, W.2, W.15 and W.16; and\n\n(e) for Season 2022/23, Premier League Rules B.15, B.18, W.1, W.2, W.15 and W.16.\n\n‘Going to war with the champions’: Why the Premier League is taking on Man City, and what comes next\n\n16:15 , Michael Jones\n\nIt was around the same time as a generically pictured statement appeared on the Premier League website that legal papers were served to Manchester City executives. There was initial shock, that soon rippled around English football, as news spread. It was so abrupt that City chief executive Ferran Soriano was still on the phone to the Premier League as the statement went out. There hadn’t even been an email as regards notification - and this for a story that could yet lead to relegation or more.\n\nThe statement was nevertheless quickly shared with far more excitable exclamations.\n\nSenior figures in football were describing it as “the biggest scandal the Premier League has faced”, “the nuclear button” and “going to war with their serial champions”. It certainly isn’t being seen as a case that will be just eased out and go nowhere. The Premier League’s published list of over 100 alleged breaches should be sufficient indication of that, especially when they could have just fined City for non-cooperation.\n\nExecutives around the game were genuinely stunned at the extent of it. It is the product of four years of investigation, that the Premier League had taken a lot of criticism for - not least from Lord Justice Males who said in a July 2021 High Court ruling over whether arbitration could be kept secret that it was “a matter of legitimate public concern”.\n\nThis was why it took so long.\n\nWhy the Premier League is ‘going to war’ with Man City\n\nEvery trophy Man City won during period of alleged financial breaches - and who missed out\n\n16:03 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City won eight pieces of silverware across a nine-year period in which they have been charged by the Premier League with more than 100 alleged breaches of financial regulations.\n\nThe champions have reacted to the alleged breaches, claiming to be “surprised” and that there is a “comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence” to support their innocence.\n\nCity overturned a two-year ban from Uefa in 2020 and will now brace themselves for the findings from an independent commission.\n\nA number of punishments are available to the Premier League, should City be found guilty of the breaches, including expulsion and a points deduction.\n\nMan City trophies won during alleged breaches - and who missed out\n\nMan City will fight charges\n\n15:53 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has always said he was assured by his employers that they have done nothing wrong in terms of breaking finanical rules but the charges brough forward from the Premier League claim otherwise.\n\nCity will be challenging this allegations and should they win legally they will be clear, reputation untouched - mostly.\n\nShould they lose, the punishments handed down would be unprecedented. The Premier League’s scope in that sense is completely open-ended and this is a precedent setting case.\n\nCity’s reputation is on the line and the outcome, whenever it comes, will be fascinating.\n\nArbitration panel ordered City to provide documents to Premier League\n\n15:42 , Michael Jones\n\nAn arbitration panel ordered Manchester City to provide “certain documents and information to the Premier League and to make inquiries of third parties”, after the club lost a challenge over an arbitration panel’s right to hear the case.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruling stated: “For the Premier League it was submitted that the tactic that the club has adopted has been to make as many procedural applications and complaints as it possibly can to slow the day when it will actually have to provide the information.”\n\nWill football’s richest club escape punishment again?\n\n15:32 , Michael Jones\n\nThe news was found on the official website, beneath a video of the former Everton midfielder Leon Osman talking about the difference Sean Dyche has made at Goodison Park, above the story about the fantasy league points the Nottingham Forest forward Brennan Johnson accrued this weekend. “Premier League statement” is a dry headline, offering little clue what it leads to.\n\nA more newsworthy headline might have included mention of the reigning champions being charged with more than 100 breaches of financial regulations over a nine-year period, the allegation Manchester City had not been honest in disclosing how much they paid former manager Roberto Mancini, the architect of their dramatic and historic 2012 title win, or some unnamed players. It amounted to the longest charge sheet in the Premier League’s history. The consequences, if found guilty, could involve points deductions or even expulsion from the division.\n\nIt transpires City’s problems extend beyond Sunday’s 1-0 defeat against Tottenham or the suspicion their current manager, Pep Guardiola, picked the wrong team then. City have suspicions about the timing of their charges, believing the Premier League was trying to prove its toughness to show that, as the government prepares to publish a white paper, football does not need an independent regulator and that the world’s richest league can keep their own house in order.\n\nWill football’s richest club escape punishment again?\n\nNo time-barred breaches for Premier League\n\n15:30 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City’s finances also came under investigation a couple of years ago from Uefa who found that City had breached their own financial rules an issued them with a two-year ban for European football.\n\nIn 2020, City overturned the Champions League ban for a serious breach of Uefa’s financial rules at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nCas found that, while the club had failed to comply with Uefa’s investigations, many of the alleged breaches were either “not established” or “time-barred”.\n\nThe Premier League does not time-bar breaches so there is no restriction on the length of time since alleged offences have taken place.\n\nThis means that Manchester City would have a more difficult time fighting these accusations should the independent commission find that breaches of the financial rules have taken place.\n\nPremier League ‘expulsion’ among possible Man City punishments for alleged financial breaches\n\n15:19 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City could face expulsion from the Premier League or a points deduction if the club are found to have committed breaches of financial rules.\n\nAfter a four-year investigation, the Premier League has referred a number of alleged breaches to an independent Commission.\n\nIt is alleged that Manchester City broke rules relating to the provision of “accurate financial information” across nine Premier League seasons from 2009 to 2018, and that the club had failed to cooperate with the league’s investigation since the start of the 2018-19 campaign, among wide-ranging alleged breaches.\n\nWhat are Man City’s possible punishments for alleged finance breaches?\n\nNo retrospective punishment for Man City\n\n15:08 , Michael Jones\n\nDuring the time frame of the alleged breaches from Manchester City (2009/10 to 2017/28), the club won a lot of trophies.\n\nCity won the Premier League three times (2011/12, 2013/14 and 2017/18) and finished inside the top five in every season. They also came runners-up in 2012/13 and 2014/15, won the FA Cup in 2011, and the League Cup in 2014, 2016 and 2018.\n\nHowever, if they are found guilty of breaching the Premier League financial rules there should not be any retrospective punishment meaning their titles and honours will all still count.\n\nMan City face charges over finanical rules breach\n\n15:00 , Michael Jones\n\nHere are the sections of the rules that the Premier League say Manchester City breached:\n\n- Seasons 2009/10 to 2017/18 - rules that required provision, in the utmost good faith, of accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position, in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs.\n\n- Seasons 2009/10 to 2012/13 - rules requiring full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager.\n\n- Seasons 2013/14 to 2017/18 - rules requiring club to comply with Uefa’s’ regulations, including club licensing and financial fair play.\n\n- Seasons 2015/16 to 2017/18 inclusive - rules on profitability and sustainability,\n\n- From December 2018 to date - requiring club to cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations, including by providing documents and information in the utmost good faith.\n\nPremier League accuse Man City of breaching financial rules\n\n14:51 , Michael Jones\n\nThis is not the first time Manchester City’s finances have been called into question.\n\nIn 2020 City had a two-year ban from European club competitions overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), after Uefa had ruled that City committed “serious breaches” of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations between 2012 and 2016.\n\nThat period of time is covered in the Premier League’s investigation as well.\n\nPremier League accuse Man City of breaching financial rules\n\n14:43 , Michael Jones\n\nThe Premier League has charged Manchester City with breaking its financial rules.\n\nA long-running investigation into the club’s finances found alleged breaches of the rules between 2009 and 2018, and the report accused City of not co-operating with the investigation from December 2018.\n\nThe Premier League has referred the club to an independent commission over the investigation.\n\nIn a statement released on this morning the Premier League said City breached rules requiring them to provide “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position”.\n\nThis information included the club’s revenue, including sponsorship revenue and operating costs.\n\nPep Guardiola rues missed opportunity in Man City’s defeat at Tottenham\n\n14:33 , Michael Jones\n\nPep Guardiola insisted there was a long way to go in the Premier League title race but conceded Manchester City had missed an opportunity following their 1-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nHarry Kane’s record-breaking goal in the 15th minute earned Spurs a third win from their last four matches against the Premier League champions, who could have closed the gap on leaders Arsenal to two points.\n\nIt proved to be Kane’s day with his scuffed first-half finish moving him beyond Jimmy Greaves’ tally and putting him alone as Tottenham’s all-time leading scorer with 267 goals to make both sides of north London happy.\n\nPep Guardiola rues missed opportunity in Man City’s defeat at Tottenham\n\nKevin De Bruyne faces Pep’s displeasure but it’s Man City who pay the price\n\n14:23 , Michael Jones\n\nOne of the two most creative passers on Manchester City’s books was in the starting 11. He had an assist after 14 minutes. Not for City, admittedly. Joao Cancelo was in the Bayern Munich team. The beneficiary of his supply line was not Erling Haaland but Kingsley Coman. He was facing Wolfsburg and a former Wolfsburg playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne, became the latest public target of Pep Guardiola’s displeasure. There was no pretence of a minor injury. His demotion was tactical. “Definitely,” said Guardiola. was\n\nThere are different forms of exile, to the Bundesliga and the bench. One will last for five months. The other spanned 58 minutes. It offered scant evidence City are better off without the player with the most assists in the Premier League this season and the fifth most in its history. It did demonstrate the restlessness of Guardiola, the fractiousness with some of his players that has extended beyond Cancelo’s dramatic fall from grace. But without the creators, City weren’t creative enough.\n\nKevin De Bruyne faces Pep’s displeasure but it’s Man City who pay the price\n\nErling Haaland ‘might have picked the wrong club’, says Jamie Carragher\n\n14:13 , Michael Jones\n\nJamie Carragher has suggested that Erling Haaland “might have joined the wrong club” and insisted that Manchester City are yet to get the best out of their Norwegian striker.\n\nHaaland already has 25 Premier League goals after a summer arrival in Manchester, but struggled to make an impact during Sunday’s defeat to Tottenham.\n\nThe 22-year-old failed to register a single shot or touch in the Spurs box as Pep Guardiola’s side missed an opportunity to close the gap to league leaders Arsenal.\n\nWhile Haaland remains on track to complete the most prolific individual scoring season in Premier League history, former Liverpool defender Carragher does not think that Guardiola has yet worked out how to fully utilise the forward’s considerable threat.\n\nHaaland ‘might have picked the wrong club’, says Carragher\n\nHistory-making Harry Kane steals the show to leave Man City trailing\n\n14:04 , Michael Jones\n\nThis young stadium enjoyed a special moment, as Pep Guardiola endured yet another bad evening here. The Manchester City manager could only watch as his side failed to do what Harry Kane has now made historic virtue out of. The Tottenham Hotspur legend has become their leading goalscorer, going one better than the great Jimmy Greaves with his 267th goal for the club. It proved the only goal of an invigorating 1-0 win over the champions, as they still haven’t scored at the Spurs Stadium since it was built in 2019.\n\nThat was this time without the recovering Antonio Conte present in the ground, as Guardiola’s problems only mounted. His side failed to take the chance to go within two points of Arsenal after the leaders’ loss at Everton on Saturday and that, most aggravatingly for the City manager, after his side barely mustered a chance at all.\n\nSpurs will put that benefit to their great rivals out of their mind, just as they did for all of this game. The evening is of course about Kane, to dominate all headlines, but that only after a display of ultra-focus from Spurs. You could say that is because they now know this tactical approach against City so well but that is precisely what was missing in the 4-2 defeat in Manchester - as well as so many other games over the last few weeks.\n\nHistory-making Harry Kane steals the show to leave Man City trailing\n\nWho will be on the independent commission panel?\n\n13:56 , Michael Jones\n\nStephen Taylor Heath, JMW head of sports law, told Sky Sports: “The commission will have a legal representative on the panel, and you’d expect that representative to be a pretty heavyweight King’s Counsel.\n\n“Manchester City have had an obligation to comply with the Premier League’s investigation and they now have an obligation to comply with the commission’s procedure. If they don’t comply then a dim view will be taken.\n\n“If the charges relate to administrative errors then the sanctions will be a slap on the wrist. You would think, if the Premier League have taken it this far, they either think there is a case to answer or they’ve simply got to the point where they haven’t been given the answers, and they’re now putting it to a commission to get those answers.”\n\nGovernment pushes back publication of White Paper on football\n\n13:50 , Michael Jones\n\nThe publication of a Government White Paper expected to support the creation of an independent regulator for football has been pushed back.\n\nThis is not supposed to be linked with any of the news concerning Manchester City today but rather due to the volume of other business needed to get through by the government.\n\nGovernment pushes back publication of White Paper on football\n\nThe Erling Haaland issue that Manchester City must solve\n\n13:43 , Michael Jones\n\nAs Pep Guardiola sat down to his post-game press conference, there were a few comments that could have been construed as swipes. He referred to Tottenham defending with nine men, and said he wouldn’t again describe them as “the Harry Kane team” as he didn’t want to upset Mauricio Pochettino. In truth, though, none of this was delivered with enough energy to feel any way deliberate as barbs. There wasn’t much energy at all, which was pretty much like his Manchester City team in their 1-0 defeat to Spurs.\n\nThe difference with his press conference after his previous match against the same opposition, just a few weeks ago, couldn’t have been more pronounced. It was then that Guardiola went on an impassioned monologue, referring to “happy flowers”. While his meaning was often difficult to decipher, the intention wasn’t.\n\nGuardiola wanted a response out of his team. He wanted hunger. On the evidence of this, and even his response, he hasn’t got it.\n\nThe Erling Haaland issue that Manchester City must solve\n\nWhat punishments can the independent commission impose on a club?\n\n13:34 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City’s potential financial rule breaking is now being reviewed by an independent commission. The commission will the decide which punishment, if any, City will face.\n\nThere are a number of penalties with points deductions and heavy fines the most likely. Here’s what could happen to Man City if they’re guilty of breaking financial rules:\n\n- Suspend a club from playing league matches\n\n- Points deductions\n\n- Recommend to the board that league matches be replayed\n\n- Recommend to the board that the league expels the respondent club\n\n- Order compensation\n\n- Cancel or refuse registration of players\n\n- Conditional punishment\n\n- Order the club to pay costs\n\n- Make such other order as it thinks fit\n\nMan City statement after being charged with over 100 financial rule breaches\n\n13:24 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City insist they are “surprised” at being charged by the Premier League with more than 100 alleged breaches of financial regulations.\n\nThe reigning champions could potentially be hit with a points deduction or even expulsion from the league if found guilty following a four-year investigation.\n\nThe unprecedented series of allegations from Premier League concerns a nine-year period from 2009 to 2018, with the club insisting there is “irrefutable evidence” to prove their innocence.\n\nMan City statement after unprecedented Premier League charges\n\nMan City charged with over 100 breaches of financial rules after four-year investigation\n\n13:18 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City have been charged by the Premier League with over 100 breaches of their financial rules.\n\nIt follows a four-year investigation into the finances of the current Premier League champions.\n\nIn an unprecedented series of allegations, the Premier League said the breaches referred to a requirement to provide “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position” in particular its “revenue”, “sponsorship revenue” and “operating costs”.\n\nManchester City announced their “surprise” at the Premier League’s announcement and denied the charges.

They believe some journalists were given advance warning of the statement, which evidently, they are not impressed about.\n\n“They also note the timing of the statement given the White Paper on football governance is scheduled to be published soon. It is felt that bringing this case it likely to be used by the Premier League as evidence of them being able to deal with governance issues itself.\n\n“City are confident in their position and that includes the charges that were time-barred in their Uefa case. The club are understood to have provided the relevant evidence around those charges to the Premier League some time ago.”\n\nMan City will fight charges\n\n13:00 , Michael Jones\n\nIt’s taken the Premier League four years to get to this point and form a case to the point where they are confident of bringing charges against Manchester City who will now do their utmost to respond to the accusations.\n\nDo not expect a resolution to this case any time soon.\n\nFor years Manchester City have denied financial wrongdoing. Details into their finances were published by Der Spiegel - when it was passed information by Football Leaks - but the club claimed this information was incomplete.\n\nUefa then launched its case against City but the club had no faith in that investigation and, when it went against them, they went straight to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Cas cleared them of the substantive allegations, even though some were timed out.\n\nThe Premier League’s charge sheet includes five years of allegations that City have not assisted with their inquiry - which is all of it. The club will now have their lawyers on the case and it will be an expensive and time-consuming matter before any resolution is found.\n\nMan City will fight charges\n\n12:56 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has always said he was assured by his employers that they have done nothing wrong in terms of breaking finanical rules but the charges brough forward from the Premier League claim otherwise.\n\nCity will be challenging this allegations and should they win legally they will be clear, reputation untouched - mostly.\n\nShould they lose, the punishments handed down would be unprecedented. The Premier League’s scope in that sense is completely open-ended and this is a precedent setting case.\n\nCity’s reputation is on the line and the outcome, whenever it comes, will be fascinating.\n\nArbitration panel ordered City to provide documents to Premier League\n\n12:50 , Michael Jones\n\nAn arbitration panel ordered Manchester City to provide “certain documents and information to the Premier League and to make inquiries of third parties”, after the club lost a challenge over an arbitration panel’s right to hear the case.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruling stated: “For the Premier League it was submitted that the tactic that the club has adopted has been to make as many procedural applications and complaints as it possibly can to slow the day when it will actually have to provide the information.”\n\nMan City respond to being charged with over 100 financial rule breaches\n\n12:45 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City insist they are “surprised” at being charged by the Premier League with more than 100 alleged breaches of financial regulations.\n\nThe reigning champions could potentially be hit with a points deduction or even expulsion from the league if found guilty following a four-year investigation.\n\nThe unprecedented series of allegations from Premier League concerns a nine-year period from 2009 to 2018, with the club insisting there is “irrefutable evidence” to prove their innocence.\n\nMan City respond to unprecedented Premier League charges\n\nKyle Walker insists Erling Haaland is a not a problem for Manchester City\n\n12:39 , Michael Jones\n\nKyle Walker has leapt to the defence of Manchester City forward Erling Haaland following Sunday’s 1-0 defeat at Tottenham.\n\nPremier League top goalscorer Haaland cut a frustrated figure in the capital and failed to have a single shot on target.\n\nHaaland has scored 31 goals in 28 appearances since a summer switch from Borussia Dortmund, with 25 of them in the top flight but City remain five points behind leaders Arsenal after their fourth league loss of the campaign.\n\nKyle Walker insists Erling Haaland is a not a problem for Manchester City\n\nMan City’s alleged breaches of Premier League rules\n\n12:34 , Michael Jones\n\n1.

They described it as possibly the only opportunity to properly assess the English game and where it’s going, since nothing like this has ever been done before. It is quite a thought, that illustrates the “enormity” of what this government are taking on. In 160 years of codified English football, there has never been anything like an attempt at a holistic assessment of the sport and what it should look like.\n\nEven events since the Super League, like Chelsea’s spending, illustrate it is now more important than ever. There are reservations within the game over whether Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Michelle Donelan gets this, as eyebrows were raised over recent statements and questions.\n\n“This is a really important opportunity for football,” says Niall Couper of Fair Game, “but the most important thing is it has to have teeth.”\n\nThe landmark moment that can change football forever\n\nPremier League accuse Man City of breaching financial rules\n\n11:54 , Michael Jones\n\nIndependent commission proceedings to go ahead in private\n\n11:49 , Michael Jones\n\nThe independent commission tasked with figuring out whether Manchester City broke any Premier League financial rules will undergo their proceedings in a confidential and private manner.\n\nA Premier League statement announcing the referrals said: “The proceedings before the commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the commission’s final award will be published on the Premier League’s website.\n\n“This confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice.”\n\nCarragher reacts\n\n11:44 , Michael Jones\n\nJamie Carragher has reacted to the news of Man City potentially breaking the Premier League’s financial rules.\n\nHe cheekily wrote on Twitter: “This can’t be right, Man City bring in more commercial revenue than Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Man Utd & Liverpool.”\n\nWhy did the Premier League wait so long to act?\n\n11:38 , Michael Jones\n\nThe Premier League’s charges against Manchester City cover a period of over 10 years. They were investigating the club from 2009 onwards yet only brought the charges forward now almost 14 years later.\n\nThis week there is a government white paper passing through the House of Commons which is being described as possibly the only opportunity to properly assess the English game and where it’s going, since nothing like this has ever been done before.\n\nThat will likely be known on Wednesday 8th February, which is when the white paper is expected to be published and it is expected that the document will call for the much-debated football regulator, albeit with its powers to be determined, and announce its intention to properly recognise the community role of clubs and ensure there cannot be future collapses like Bury.\n\nIs the Premier League trying to get ahead of a crisis it sees coming further down the line?\n\nNo retrospective punishment for Man City\n\n11:27 , Michael Jones\n\nDuring the time frame of the alleged breaches from Manchester City (2009/10 to 2017/28), the club won a lot of trophies.\n\nCity won the Premier League three times (2011/12, 2013/14 and 2017/18) and finished inside the top five in every season. They also came runners-up in 2012/13 and 2014/15, won the FA Cup in 2011, and the League Cup in 2014, 2016 and 2018.\n\nHowever, if they are found guilty of breaching the Premier League financial rules there should not be any retrospective punishment meaning their titles and honours will all still count.\n\nWhat are the possible consequences for Man City?\n\n11:23 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City have been referred to an independent commission who will determine whether the club have broken Premier League rules.\n\nIf the club are found guilty, punishment could range from a points deduction to a possible exclusion from the Premier League.\n\nManchester City are expected to defend themselves against the charges but have yet to respond.\n\nMan City charged with over 100 breaches of financial rules after four-year investigation\n\n11:20 , Michael Jones\n\nManchester City have been charged by the Premier League with numerous breaches of their financial rules.\n\nIt follows a four-year investigation into the finances of the current Premier League champions.\n\nIn an unprecedented statement, the Premier League alleged that the breaches came over nine seasons, from 2009 to 2018. Manchester City won the Premier League three times during that period.\n\nThe Premier League said the alleged breaches referred to “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position” in particular its “revenue”, “sponsorship revenue” and “operating costs”.\n\nMan City charged with over 100 breaches after four-year investigation\n\nMan City face charges over finanical rules breach\n\n11:17 , Michael Jones\n\nHere are the sections of the rules that the Premier League say Manchester City breached:\n\n- Seasons 2009/10 to 2017/18 - rules that required provision, in the utmost good faith, of accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position, in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs.\n\n- Seasons 2009/10 to 2012/13 - rules requiring full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager.\n\n- Seasons 2013/14 to 2017/18 - rules requiring club to comply with Uefa’s’ regulations, including club licensing and financial fair play.\n\n- Seasons 2015/16 to 2017/18 inclusive - rules on profitability and sustainability,\n\n- From December 2018 to date - requiring club to cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations, including by providing documents and information in the utmost good faith.\n\nPremier League accuse Man City of breaching financial rules\n\n11:14 , Michael Jones\n\nThis is not the first time Manchester City’s finances have been called into question.\n\nIn 2020 City had a two-year ban from European club competitions overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), after Uefa had ruled that City committed \"serious breaches\" of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations between 2012 and 2016.\n\nThat period of time is covered in the Premier League’s investigation as well.\n\nPremier League accuse Man City of breaching financial rules\n\n11:11 , Michael Jones\n\nThe Premier League has charged Manchester City with breaking its financial rules.\n\nA long-running investigation into the club’s finances found alleged breaches of the rules between 2009 and 2018, and the report accused City of not co-operating with the investigation from December 2018.\n\nThe Premier League has referred the club to an independent commission over the investigation.\n\nIn a statement released on this morning the Premier League said City breached rules requiring them to provide “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position”.\n\nThis information included the club’s revenue, including sponsorship revenue and operating costs."
