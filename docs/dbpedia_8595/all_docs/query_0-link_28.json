        "text": "Brentford 2-1 Crystal Palace: Eagles grounded by disallowed goal\n\nJoe Rindl\n\nBBC Sport journalist\n\nFor Crystal Palace fans there was only one key talking point.\n\nAt 0-0, Eberechi Eze caught Brentford keeper Mark Flekken dozing to find the net with a quickly taken free-kick, but referee Sam Barrott had spotted a foul by Will Hughes on Nathan Collins as the set-piece was struck.\n\nWith the whistle blown before the ball entered the goal, the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) was unable to intervene and check Hughes' challenge to potentially overrule the onfield decision.\n\nOn reflection, it was probably not a foul which meant Brentford's goal moments later stung even more.\n\nCrystal Palace still got themselves back into the game in the second half, and had Odsonne Edouard timed his run better, would have gone 2-1 up.\n\nEdouard had a good game after replacing Jean-Philippe Mateta at half-time, while Eze was clearly Palace's biggest goal threat.\n\nThe performance was there, despite the loss. What might have been had that Eze strike counted...\n\nBrentford 2-1 Crystal Palace: What Glasner said\n\nOliver Glasner spoke to BBC Match of the Day after Crystal Palace's defeat to Brentford: \"When you lose it is always disappointing in a game like this. We don't look for excuses or complain about anything. it is how it is. We had many opportunities to create chances. When you concede two goals it's difficult because we have to score three. We will analyse it and have more compactness in defense. We are disappointed today.\n\n\"We are disappointed but it is how it is. It makes no sense to complain now. We won't get this goal back for a draw. We had a great reaction after the 1-0 at half-time and played well in the second half. We scored but it was offside. We could have avoided the cross for their goal and defended better. I'm very confident that when we get into our rhythm then we will get into these games.\"\n\nOn Marc Guehi, Glasner added: \"Everyone can see he is completely focused on Crystal Palace and the game today. The last two days, we didn't speak about transfers because we focused on the game so no news.\"\n\nPalace perform well but may have to invest to replace Olise\n\nAlex Howell\n\nBBC Sport football news reporter\n\nCrystal Palace ended the last campaign on a high, winning six of their last seven games but weren't able to match the form they showed at the back end of last season.\n\nThe Eagles have lost winger Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and the forward was a key part of that success they had.\n\nDaichi Kamada started the match on the right side of the Palace attack and was tidy and linked the play well but did not look as creative as Olise - which will be hard for any player to match.\n\nPalace had a lot of the game where they were on top but could not make the most of those times.\n\nGlasnerâs side had 54% possession, 14 shots with six of those on target. It still took an own goal to get them level and Edouard will be disappointed that he strayed offside when he thought he had given Palace the lead.\n\nTo be fair to Edouard he did improve the Palace attack when he came on but Palace may have to invest if they want to make up for the loss of Olise and not keep having the same conversation throughout the season.\n\nSutton's predictions: Brentford v Crystal Palace\n\nA new season, and a new challenge for BBC Sport's prediction expert Chris Sutton.\n\nSutton faced off against a guest for each of the 38 game weeks in 2023-24 and triumphed 21-10 (with seven draws) to secure his second predictions title in a row.\n\nIn the first week of the new season, his opponent is The Courteeners frontman Liam Fray.\n\nThe pair have both given their prediction for Brentford v Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\n\nEngland striker Ivan Toney is still at Brentford and who knows how that will pan out.\n\nThey will be fine if Toney does leave, because they carried a threat for so long without him last season anyway, and I like the balance in their team.\n\nCrystal Palace ended last season really well under Oliver Glasner but I'm not sure how they will shape up this time.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta has been at the Olympics, Michael Olise has left, while Marc Guehi and Joachim Andersen could be sold as well - so we could be seeing a very different Palace.\n\nWe will have to wait to see how things settle down for both sides but, in the meantime, this is another game with draw written all over it.\n\nLiam's prediction: 2-2\n\nI think both teams will be pretty attacking so I can see a few goals.\n\nRead the full predictions and have your say here\n\nOur reporter asked... you answered\n\nOur football news reporter Alex Howell believes Crystal Palace need to be \"shrewd\" in their dealings this transfer window if they are to continue to excel under Oliver Glasner. So we asked you to have your say on what the Eagles need to do.\n\nHere are some of your comments:\n\nGareth: Potentially our most exciting season since the early 90s under Sir Stevie Coppell. Team appear to have really bought into Glasner's vision and style of play. Need to sort out Guehi situation, while keeping Eze and Wharton is a must. Would like one more attacking player. Europe is a real possibility this season.\n\nKester: The new leadership feels stable. Glasner has the team playing attractive football. All areas seem to be improving. To kick on we will need to avoid injuries to some key players - mainly Eze. If we do that, then top 10 is possible. As always, survival is the main priority. If we make Europe, my concern - will this impact our Premier League survival?\n\nGary: Palace can finish in the top eight even without Olise. One player doesn't make a team. I'm sure Glasner can and will find a way to compensate for the loss of Olise. Top eight here we come. We'll be glad all over if that happens.\n\nPalace in 'stable situation' despite Textor sale plans - Parish\n\nAlex Howell\n\nBBC Sport football news reporter\n\nThe transfer window has been a busy time at Crystal Palace, with Michael Olise leaving for Bayern Munich and interest in key players Marc Guehi and Joachim Andersen.\n\nBut that is not the only potential sale that is being worked on behind the scenes.\n\nJohn Textor owns about 45% of the Eagles but has made it clear that he wants to sell his stake to pursue a deal to buy another club, with Everton one of the options.\n\nPalace chairman and co-owner Steve Parish is the man in charge of running the club and said that the situation is amicable.\n\n\"John has a multi-club setup and because he has a minority position in Crystal Palace it makes it more difficult for him to do the things that he wants to do,\" Parish said.\n\n\"Personally, I think John is making a good a job as anyone in that multi-club situation, he has great assets.\n\n\"He wants a club that plugs into that where he controls everything that happens. We don't think that is right for us as a club right now.\n\n\"We do collaborate with his clubs where we can. He wants to go and do something else, we're helping him do that.\n\n\"John has supported the club financially as we all have. He has put his part in and we have put our part in and we're all aligned on the strategy.\n\n\"We're very happy to help John fulfil his ambitions.\n\n\"I was chatting to him on email while he was flying to Brazil last night. We will try to find the right people to come in his place.\n\n\"Josh, David and I between us have 55% with some friends. It's a very stable situation for the club and very amicable. We will work to wish John well and do our best to get him in the position we want him to be in.\"\n\nNewcastle 'not scared off' by Parish interview\n\nThe Telegraph's Luke Edwards says his \"gut feeling\" tells him a price for Marc Guehi will be met so that the defender can sign for Newcastle.\n\nCrystal Palace have rejected three offers from the Magpies, with the latest bid understood to be in the region of Â£60m.\n\n\"It has legs,\" said Edwards on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. \"Crystal Palace's chairman Steve Parish gave a very interesting interview which basically said he is available to buy but you will have to pay top money for him.\n\n\"Newcastle have not been scared off by that. Negotiations are continuing and everybody on both sides will want it to be less public now.\n\n\"Newcastle have tried to go low ball and get a bit of a bargain because they know he wants to come, so I think it will go quiet in the meantime.\n\n\"My gut feeling is that it will get done and it is a brilliant signing for them if it is.\"\n\nListen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds\n\nWill Palace 'kick on' this season?\n\nAlex Howell\n\nBBC Sport football news reporter\n\nThis season, like most for Crystal Palace, seems like it could be a pivotal one for them as they look to take the next step from an established low-to-mid-table team to one that could potentially qualify for Europe.\n\nI have covered Crystal Palace in one way or another for the majority of the time they have been in the Premier League.\n\nIt is safe to say that the football that Oliver Glasner has got them playing is the best I have seen in that time.\n\nThe big question this season is whether the team are able to kick on from how they finished the last campaign.\n\nThey have lost key player Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and Marc Guehi is the subject of interest from Newcastle.\n\nIf Palace are to continue to show the progress of the last 10 games of last season and match the ambition of manager Glasner, they will need to hold on to the rest of the important players they have and continue to be shrewd in the transfer market.\n\nWill you kick on, Palace fans? Tell us here, external"
