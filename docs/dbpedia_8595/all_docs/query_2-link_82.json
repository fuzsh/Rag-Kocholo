        "text": "Liverpool and Manchester City developed a ferocious rivalry over the years when Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola produced consistently thrilling matches every time they went head-to-head on the pitch.\n\nWhen Liverpool travelled to the Etihad Stadium to potentially decide the 2021/22 English top-flight crown in April 2022, Guardiola and Klopp faced off in one of the biggest Premier League games in recent memory. That match ended in a draw giving City the edge they needed to win the Premier League title by a single point from the Reds.\n\nThe two managers have plenty of history, and while the two Premier League sides have much to do with that, it goes back further than just meetings between the Reds and Citizens.\n\nThe pair began their history as opposing managers of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, sharing big moments and big results between them across both the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal.\n\nThat transferred to England when Klopp moved to the Premier League in 2015 and Guardiola followed a year later.\n\nHowever, the 2023/24 campaign is likely to be the final season in which Guardiola and Klopp contested for the top honours in England and Europe.\n\nKlopp officially stepped down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season and in came Arne Slot..\n\nMORE: Man City and Liverpool's all-time head-to-head record\n\nPep Guardiola vs Jurgen Klopp: Head-to-head record\n\nWhere there's smoke, there's fire. The volume of matchups tells a story.\n\nThe 30 meetings between the two means they have faced one another more often than any other opponent in their careers.\n\nTheir final clash in the Premier League was on March 10, 2024, when Liverpool recovered from a goal down to draw 1-1 with Manchester City at Anfield.\n\nAll-time Klopp vs. Guardiola meetings: 30\n\nGuardiola wins: 11\n\nKlopp wins: 12\n\nDraws: 7\n\nKlopp vs Guardiola all-time head-to-head meetings\n\nHome team noted in italics\n\nDateCompetitionGuardiola TeamKlopp TeamWinnerJuly 27, 2013DFL-SupercupBayern Munich 2Borussia Dortmund 4KloppNov. 23, 2013BundesligaBayern Munich 3Borussia Dortmund 0GuardiolaApril 12, 2014BundesligaBayern Munich 0Borussia Dortmund 3KloppMay 17, 2014DFB-Pokal FinalBayern Munich 2Borussia Dortmund 0GuardiolaAug. 13, 2014DFL-SupercupBayern Munich 0Borussia Dortmund 2KloppNov. 1, 2014BundesligaBayern Munich 2Borussia Dortmund 1GuardiolaApril 4, 2015BundesligaBayern Munich 1Borussia Dortmund 0GuardiolaApril 28, 2015DFB-Pokal SemisBayern Munich 1Borussia Dortmund 1*Klopp*Dec. 31, 2016Premier LeagueMan City 0Liverpool 1KloppMar. 19, 2017Premier LeagueMan City 1Liverpool 1DrawSept. 9, 2017Premier LeagueMan City 5Liverpool 0GuardiolaJan. 14, 2018Premier LeagueMan City 3Liverpool 4KloppApril 4, 2018Champions LeagueMan City 0Liverpool 3KloppApril 10, 2018Champions LeagueMan City 1Liverpool 2KloppOct. 7, 2018Premier LeagueMan City 0Liverpool 0DrawJan. 3, 2019Premier LeagueMan City 2Liverpool 1GuardiolaAug. 4, 2019Community ShieldMan City 1*Liverpool 1GuardiolaNov. 10, 2019Premier LeagueMan City 1Liverpool 3KloppJuly 2, 2020Premier LeagueMan City 4Liverpool 0GuardiolaNov. 8, 2020Premier LeagueMan City 1Liverpool 1DrawFeb. 7, 2021Premier LeagueMan City 4Liverpool 1GuardiolaOct. 3, 2021Premier LeagueMan City 2Liverpool2DrawApril 10, 2022Premier LeagueMan City 2Liverpool 2DrawApril 16, 2022FA Cup semifinalMan City 2Liverpool 3KloppJuly 30, 2022Community ShieldMan City 2Liverpool 3KloppOct. 16, 2022Premier LeagueMan City 0Liverpool 1KloppDec. 22, 2022Carabao CupMan City 3Liverpool 2GuardiolaApr. 1, 2023Premier LeagueMan City 4Liverpool 1GuardiolaNov. 25, 2023Premier LeagueMan City 1Liverpool 1DrawMar. 10, 2024Premier LeagueMan City 1Liverpool 1Draw\n\n* = Win via penalty shootout\n\nWhat have Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp said about each other?\n\nThe rivalry between the two bosses was a point of discussion in the build-up to the November 24, 2023 Premier League showdown, when Guardiola said Klopp \"absolutely made me better\".\n\n\"Part of when you are many years in this business is him and his teams, here and at Dortmund. [We have] always been big rivals,\" reflected Guardiola.\n\n\"[These are] good games for both [teams, with a] positive approach and always attractive [style]. He made me a better manager through his teams. They are a fantastic team – a top side, no doubt.\"\n\nBefore the teams met in the top flight in April 2022, Klopp calling Guardiola one of the best managers of all time.\n\n\"I respect a lot what they [City] do,\" Klopp said at the time, calling City \"an insane football team\" in an unusual choice of compliment. \"And, for me, the world's best manager.\n\n“So, that’s a combination which makes it quite tricky. But the good news is that they are human beings as well. If I would be a different person I would be, probably, a little bit depressed about the fact that Pep Guardiola is constantly coaching these kind of teams.\n\n\"Maybe in Dortmund we could've won more titles if Pep wouldn't have been at Bayern. Now it is pretty much the same.\n\n\"Imagine if he would not be here. We probably could've won at least one more league title. But I am not like this, thank God. So I am completely happy with our situation.\"\n\nGuardiola shook that thought off, but had similar praise for his counterpart.\n\n\"Thank you so much, but I'm not [the world's best manager],\" Guardiola said. \"I would like to tell him I'm the best, but I'm not.\n\n\"Jurgen makes world football a better place to live with his message.\"\n\nSo can this be a rivalry with such kind words being thrown around? Pep thinks so.\n\n\"In the last five years they have been the biggest opponent,\" Guardiola said in that pre-match press conference. \"Jurgen, as a manager, has been the biggest rival I've ever had in my career and I think what both teams propose is good for football.\n\n\"When I'm retired — watching and playing golf — I'll remember my biggest rival was Liverpool, for sure.\"\n\nMORE: Where are PL referees from and which teams do they support?\n\nHow many trophies have they won?\n\nOddly enough, the two managers have only met once — three times if you count season-opening showcases — in a final with silverware directly on the line.\n\nBut the two bosses have had plenty of meetings that eliminated one or the other from contention for trophies.\n\nPep Guardiola has the edge when it comes to his trophy haul, although many of them came from his days at Barcelona before the two had ever met.\n\nKlopp edged Guardiola in cup competitions during their time in Germany, while Guardiola held the Bundesliga league title on lockdown most of that time.\n\nIn the Premier League, it has been largely the same, as Klopp has seen more European success while Guardiola succeeds in league play plus a run of EFL Cup (Carabao Cup) wins.\n\nJurgen Klopp trophies\n\nDomestic (Germany):\n\nBundesliga title: 2010/11, 2011/12\n\nDFB Pokal: 2011/12\n\nDFL Supercup: 2013, 2014\n\nDomestic (England):\n\nPremier League title: 2019/20\n\nEFL Cup (Carabao Cup): 2021/22, 2023/24\n\nFA Cup: 2021/22\n\nCommunity Shield: 2023\n\nEuropean & International:\n\nChampions League: 2018/19 (Liverpool)\n\nClub World Cup: 2019 (Liverpool)\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 2019 (Liverpool)\n\nPep Guardiola trophies\n\nDomestic (Spain):\n\nLa Liga title: 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11\n\nCopa del Rey: 2009/09, 2011/12\n\nSupercopa de Espana: 2009, 2010, 2011\n\nDomestic (Germany):\n\nBundesliga title: 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16\n\nDFB Pokal: 2013/14, 2014/15\n\nDomestic (England):\n\nPremier League title: 2017/18, 2018/19, 2020/21, 2021/22, 2022/23, 2023/24\n\nFA Cup: 2018/19, 2022/23\n\nEFL Cup (Carabao Cup): 2017/18, 2018/19, 2018/20, 2020/21\n\nCommunity Shield: 2018, 2019\n\nEuropean & International:\n\nChampions League: 2008/09 (Barcelona), 2010/11 (Barcelona), 2022/23 (Man City)\n\nClub World Cup: 2009 (Barcelona), 2011 (Barcelona), 2013 (Bayern Munich), 2023 (Man City)\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 2013 (Bayern Munich), 2023 (Man City)\n\nMost memorable matchups between Guardiola and Klopp\n\nFirst-ever meeting\n\nJurgen Klopp gave Pep Guardiola a rude welcome to German football after the Spaniard moved to Bayern Munich in 2013.\n\nIn the season-opening DFL-Supercup, Marco Reus scored a brace, and Ilkay Gundogan — an eventual Guardiola disciple at Man City — bagged the eventual game-winning goal to give Borussia Dortmund a 4-2 victory, with Arjen Robben scoring a brace in the defeat.\n\nThe back-and-forth match proved an exciting harbinger to what would become an electric rivalry. It also marked the first of two Super Cup meetings, as Klopp would win both.\n\nGuardiola wins 2014 DFB Pokal final\n\nPep Guardiola would complete a domestic double in the 2013-14 season, finishing a massive 19 points above second-place Dortmund to win the league, and a Der Klasikker win in the DFB Pokal final sealed the deal.\n\nWhile the 90 minutes of regulation finished scoreless, Arjen Robben scored in the 107th minute to put Bayern ahead and Thomas Muller added to it in the 121st minute to seal the silverware.\n\nKlopp ruins Guardiola's 2015 domestic double\n\nWhile Bayern Munich romped to a resounding Bundesliga title in 2014-15, with Borussia Dortmund finishing a disappointing seventh, Jurgen Klopp would still have his say in the season.\n\nThe two sides met in the DFB Pokal semifinals, and while Bayern went ahead in the 29th minute through former Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang tied it in the 75th minute. The match went to penalties, and in a memorable shootout that saw Bayern fail to score a single effort — Philipp Lahm, Xabi Alonso, and Manuel Neuer (!) all missed and Mario Gotze's effort was saved — and Dortmund went through on the back of shootout conversions by Gundogan and Sebastian Kehl.\n\nOnly Champions League meeting\n\nFor all the matchups between the two over the years, they have only met once — well, twice, across one two-legged matchup in the 2017-18 quarterfinals — which saw Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool advance to the semis and eventually the final, before a loss there to Real Madrid.\n\nThe series between Liverpool and Man City was won in the first leg at Anfield, where Mohamed Salah scored one and assisted another and Liverpool won 3-0. The second leg was a fascinating matchup made more exciting when Gabriel Jesus opened the scoring for Man City to give the hosts a chance, but Liverpool held firm and Salah scored a fabulous goal to put the match out of reach.\n\nMan City 4-0 Liverpool\n\nThe second-most lopsided result of the managerial rivalry (behind 2017's 5-0 Man City league win) saw Man City set the tone early for its eventual 2020-21 Premier League title run with a resounding victory at the Etihad.\n\nIt was a comprehensive result, with three different goalscorers for Man City plus an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain own-goal to round things out. City would finish 12 points atop the Premier League table when it was all said and done, with Liverpool a distant third 16 points back.\n\nMan City win 2-1 to edge 2018-19 title\n\nAfter a 0-0 draw in October that set the stage for the 2018-19 Premier League title chase, the two teams met in January still jockeying for position atop the table.\n\nWhile May was still quite a ways away at that point, and neither side would know just how close they would finish — a single point apart in the final standings — Man City fought to a 2-1 win on the back of Leroy Sane's 72nd minute winner at the Etihad. Those three points proved absolutely critical as Man City would finish on 98 points, just a single point ahead of the Reds at the end of the season.\n\nLiverpool 2-2 Man City\n\nWe should have known what would lie ahead in 2021/22.\n\nThis campaign's reverse fixture at Anfield was back-and-forth, with a scoreless first half giving way to a wild second half.\n\nAll the stars came to play, with Liverpool goals from Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane cancelled out by strikes from Phil Foden and Kevin De Bruyne."
