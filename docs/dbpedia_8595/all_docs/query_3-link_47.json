        "text": "What is going on with Manchester City?\n\nThe Treble winners have not won in four league matches and are six points behind leaders Arsenal in the Premier League.\n\nAfter their 1-0 loss at Aston Villa on Wednesday night manager Pep Guardiola admitted his side \"are struggling\".\n\nAnd former Arsenal defender Martin Keown believes the champions are \"in a mini crisis\", telling BBC Match of the Day \"they look vulnerable\".\n\nLeon Bailey's 74th-minute deflected shot gave Villa a deserved victory - one which meant City dropped to fourth in the table, behind Villa, Liverpool and Arsenal.\n\nWith so many challengers emerging, is City's crown starting to slip after three successive titles?\n\nAfter the disappointing defeat, Guardiola admitted \"the better team won\" and he \"has to find a solution\" to reverse City's woes.\n\n\"We struggled, especially in the first half and the second was completely different,\" the City manager told Amazon Prime. \"In the final third, the quality of the pass and the movement, we didn't find it all game.\n\n\"We know what's our level and as a manager we have to find a way to win games. We're struggling a bit. I'm here to help them.\"\n\nCity's four defeats this season have come when influential midfielder Rodri has been out of the starting XI. The Spaniard missed the match with Villa through a one-match suspension.\n\nWith Rodri in the team, City are unbeaten in their past 43 matches and Guardiola added he has \"to find a way to win without him\".\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Gael Clichy on Amazon Prime: \"City played one of the worst games we've seen from them. There was no fluidity, they were lucky not to concede two, maybe three or four.\"\n\nEx-Chelsea winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"City looked like a team that were well-beaten, actually out-run tonight. Just recently teams have taken the 'let's have a go at them' approach - Chelsea, Spurs, now Villa, and it is working.\n\nFormer Wales captain Ashley Williams on BBC Match of the Day: \"It almost felt like Unai Emery got the better of Guardiola. In all aspects of the game, Villa got the better of Manchester City. Something isn't right. In a normal season, City would dispatch these sides.\"\n\nFormer Aston Villa midfielder Andy Townsend on Amazon Prime: \"I don't think Guardiola has seen his side outmanoeuvred and outworked as much as he has tonight. Villa have dominated Manchester City.\"\n\nEx-Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill on Amazon Prime: \"Manchester City were really disappointing, they never really got going. There was too much energy for Manchester City to handle. It did not feel like a Guardiola side.\"\n\nMohammed Zahfeer: \"Have never seen a team dominate a Pep team like this.. no Rodri = no City. Lost all four without him, more important than Haaland.\"\n\nTunde Paul: \"Pep must be thinking \"what's going on\". He'll be looking to unleash Kevin de Bruyne once back to full fitness. I think [to say] they are missing him is an understatement.\"\n\nScott Allen-Johns: \"Man City seem different this season, not as dominant. They have clear weaknesses. It's early days still and you cannot write them off but this is going to be a tighter battle. My gut is leaning towards Liverpool for the title though.\"\n\nCharlie: \"City will still win the league by six points [minimum].\""
