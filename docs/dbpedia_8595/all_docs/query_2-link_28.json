        "text": "Ahead of Manchester City vs Manchester United on Sunday, we look back at some of the most memorable Manchester derby matches in Premier League history.\n\nThe Cantona Debut\n\n6 December 1992\n\nThe first-ever Premier League Manchester City vs Manchester United clash was also the competitive debut for Red Devils legend Eric Cantona.\n\nCantona had signed from Leeds United, where he’d started the season with an impressive 11 goal involvements in 13 Premier League appearances (six goals, five assists) – ahead of United’s most threatening attacking player at the time, Mark Hughes (six goals, one assist).\n\nThe mercurial Frenchman had a quiet debut after coming on as a half-time substitute but did collect another much-revered accolade on the night, becoming the first-ever player to make consecutive Premier League appearances against the same opponent but for different teams.\n\nCantona’s last league appearance for Leeds United was a 2-0 defeat against Manchester City, just 29 days before his debut at Manchester United in the derby.\n\nThe Comeback Win\n\n7 November 1993\n\nWith a 2-0 lead at half-time courtesy of a Niall Quinn brace, Man City could have been forgiven for believing they’d ended their seven-game winless run in the derby. However, Man Utd produced the first comeback victory in the Premier League era and the first seen in a Manchester derby since United’s 2-1 win at Maine Road in March 1983.\n\nCantona scored twice for Sir Alex Ferguson’s side after the break before Roy Keane struck the winner in the 87th minute with his first and only Premier League goal against Manchester City. More on Roy later.\n\nThis was the first time that Man United had come from two or more goals behind to win a Premier League game. That tally now stands at 14 over 31 years later – more than any other club in the history of the competition – and is a statistic to define why United are synonymous with comeback victories.\n\nThe Thrashing\n\n10 November 1994\n\nDespite being played 53 times in the Premier League, the Manchester derby had only seen one hat-trick scored in the competition before Erling Haaland and Phil Foden helped themselves to one each in the Manchester City vs Manchester United clash of October 2022.\n\nThe first man to score a treble between the two Manchester clubs in the Premier League? That would be Andrei Kanchelskis in this derby back in November 1994.\n\nKanchelskis’ hat-trick came in a 5-0 victory for United, which still remains their biggest margin of victory over their City rivals in a competitive fixture. The winger scored 13% of his Premier League goals for Manchester United within the space of 45 minutes during this derby.\n\nThe Red Card\n\n21 April 2001\n\nRoy Keane received the most red cards for Manchester United in the Premier League (seven), so it is hardly a surprise that he was the first player to be sent off in a Manchester derby in the competition.\n\nHis infamous, ever-so-slightly high, tackle on Alf-Inge Haaland (yes, father of Erling) saw the Irishman dismissed at Old Trafford during an otherwise unremarkable 1-1 draw. The tackle was rumoured to be retribution for an injury that Keane suffered in September 1997 against Leeds, that Manchester United midfielder blamed Haaland for.\n\nWeirdly, they had played a full 90 minutes against one another between Keane’s injury and his shocking challenge on the Norwegian in the Red Devils Premier League clash versus Leeds United at Old Trafford in November 1998, but Keane scored that day so maybe it was enough to distract him on that occasion.\n\nThe First City Win\n\n9 November 2002\n\nAfter 16 successive Manchester derbies without a victory, City finally ended their run with a 3-1 victory in the last ever derby match at Maine Road.\n\nThis 16-match run was the longest City have ever gone without a victory in the derby and it was Kevin Keegan who managed to orchestrate the win in the dugout.\n\nKeegan hadn’t faced Ferguson in a league match since his rant live on TV six years previously and after Shaun Goater netted his 100th and 101st Manchester City goals to seal victory, the former England manager did indeed “love it”.\n\nThe Etihad\n\n14 March 2004\n\nAfter moving to their new stadium, the Etihad, in August 2003, they had to wait until their 19th competitive game there to welcome rivals United in the derby.\n\nIn the 13 Premier League games at their new home prior to the derby, they’d collected just 13 points and scored 17 goals – the only team with a worse home record in the league at that point was Leicester City on 12 points. Kevin Keegan’s side threw the form book out of the window, as they dispatched their rivals with a comprehensive 4-1 victory.\n\nCity managed to complete a miserable week for Sir Alex Ferguson’s side after they were knocked out by FC Porto in the UEFA Champions League just five days previously. Some guy called José Mourinho made a bit of a stir by running down the Old Trafford touchline in that game.\n\nThe Theatre Silenced\n\n10 February 2008\n\nManchester United came into the Manchester derby in February 2008 on the back of 12 successive home wins in the Premier League and with the best home record in the competition (37 points in 13 games). Naturally, they went on to suffer their first-ever Premier League defeat to City at Old Trafford.\n\nFirst-half goals from Darius Vassell and Benjani saw City outscore United (who netted a late consolation via Michael Carrick) to secure their first competitive victory away at Old Trafford in 34 years, while it also meant they completed a first league double over their rivals for the first time since 1969-70.\n\nAs a tribute to the Munich air disaster 50 years previously, the occasion saw Manchester United’s players wear 1950s style red shirts numbered one to 11, with City also wearing special shirts. There were no advertising hoardings on display, instead the names of the 23 who died in 1958 were displayed. The respect continued on the pitch, as with only one yellow card in this derby match – no Premier League game between City and United has seen fewer cards dished out before or since.\n\nThe Handball\n\n30 November 2008\n\nManchester United picked up a fairly routine 1-0 win in derby against City in November 2008 at the Etihad Stadium, but their task was made harder by the dismissal of Cristiano Ronaldo in the second half.\n\nWayne Rooney had scored his 100th club goal before the Portuguese received two yellow cards from referee Howard Webb, the second of which was a deliberate handball. As a result, Ronaldo is the only player to be sent off twice in Premier League derbies between United and City.\n\nThe Noisy Neighbours Dealt With\n\n20 September 2009\n\nPossibly the most dramatic of Manchester derbies in the Premier League occurred at Old Trafford in September 2009.\n\nAfter a summer of heavy spending by City – which included the signing of Carlos Tevez from United – Alex Ferguson had proclaimed that they were the “noisy neighbours” and thanks to an injury time winner from Tevez’s replacement Michael Owen, they were able to turn down the noise.\n\nOwen’s winner came on 95:27 and was the latest winning goal in the 2009-10 Premier League season, this goal coming just five minutes and 32 seconds after Craig Bellamy thought he’d salvaged a draw with a fantastic individual effort for City.\n\nThe Rout\n\n23 October 2011\n\nAlex Ferguson took charge of 725 competitive home games for Manchester United during his 27-year tenure at the club, but the only game he suffered a defeat by a margin of four or more goals was the Manchester derby back in October 2011.\n\nA 6-1 home defeat to their rivals had dire consequences down the line, as United went on to lose the Premier League title to City on goal difference, with eight goals separating the sides.\n\nIn a match remembered by some for Mario Balotelli’s celebration; revealing a “Why Always Me?” shirt, City attempted 22 shots – a tally that has only been bettered twice by an away side at Old Trafford in the Premier League since detailed shot data became available in 2003.\n\nFerguson later revealed that he would have retired at the end of 2011-12 has United won the title, but he stayed for another campaign and ended up picking up his 13th and final Premier League crown in 2012-13.\n\nThe Title Swing\n\n30 April 2012\n\nChasing their first ever Premier League title, a springtime wobble of one win in five games saw Manchester City fall away in the title race to such an extent that it looked like there was no way back. Having led the way for most of the season, by 8 April their recent form had been so poor that United had built up an eight-point lead at the top of the league.\n\nCity won three games in a row to take advantage of United slipping up against Wigan and Everton, leaving them three points behind heading into the late-April derby at the Etihad. Roberto Mancini’s side then came into the game knowing that their superior goal difference meant a win would take them back to the summit with two games to go.\n\nIn a cagey game in which Alex Ferguson went on the defensive, deploying Wayne Rooney as a lone striker in what might have been an attempt to see out the draw his side needed to stay top, neither side created a great deal.\n\nThen, on the stroke of half-time, captain Vincent Kompany rose highest at a corner to head in a crucial goal that tipped the title race in City’s favour.\n\nThey then won away at Newcastle before a final-day encounter at home to relegation threatened QPR, and what should have been a routine win. We all know what happened next.\n\nThe New Era\n\n22 September 2013\n\nFor the first time in 26 years, the Manchester derby saw two new managers in the dugout – David Moyes was picked as United coach on the “recommendation of a legend” and Manuel Pellegrini was taking charge of his first Premier League derby.\n\nIt didn’t go well for Moyes, as City were 4-0 up inside 50 minutes before a late Wayne Rooney consolation. Rooney’s goal was his 11th in a Manchester derby overall, with this tally the record number in the history of the match. Of the 11, this was the only one from a set-piece, with his 87th minute direct-free kick beating Joe Hart in the City goal.\n\nThe Highest-Scoring Derby\n\n2 October 2022\n\nThere have been 190 Manchester derby matches in all competitions, and this has been the only one to see as many as nine goals scored.\n\nManchester City’s 6-3 home win over Manchester United was the first time that City had scored as many as six goals at home versus their rivals in a competitive fixture, with Pep Guardiola’s side demolishing the Red Devils in Erik ten Hag’s first Manchester derby as a manager.\n\nErling Haaland and Phil Foden both scored hat-tricks in this match, with Man City becoming just the third team to have more than one hat-trick scorer in a single Premier League match. It was Haaland’s first Manchester derby after signing from Borussia Dortmund in the summer, while Foden surpassed 50 competitive goals for City with his treble and became the youngest player to reach 50 goals under Pep Guardiola, surpassing Lionel Messi (22y 164d)."
