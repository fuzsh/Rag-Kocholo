        "text": "The 2023/24 Premier League season is under way and you can follow every game and every goal right here with The Independent.\n\nThis year sees Manchester City try to defend their crown and claim a historic fourth title in succession. Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering City, who also won the Champions League and FA Cup last season, will have to see off Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and the rest to claim an unprecedented sixth league title in seven years.\n\nMeanwhile Luton Town are making their first appearance in the Premier League, having risen from non-league in an incredible decade of progress. They followed Championship winners Burnley and second-placed Sheffield United in earning promotion to the top flight.\n\nFollow the latest action from the Premier League below.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley LIVE: Premier League updates\n\nRED CARD - Brownhill sent-off for denying a scoring chance\n\nCrystal Palace FC 3 - 0 Burnley FC\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n17:18\n\nOliver Glasner's start to life as Crystal Palace boss has gone swimmingly with this win over lowly Burnley. Joining an exclusive club (Alan Pardew) when it comes to managers at Palace that have opened their tenure with victory, the Austrian boss can thank Jordan Ayew for a superb welcome party. The first half was relatively non-descript aside from Josh Brownhill's dismissal. He was unfortunate when it came to receiving a hospital pass from James Trafford. However, the pull back on Jefferson Lerma was unacceptable as the last man. Palace had kept Trafford relatively busy in the first, but the second half was where they dealt their deadliest blows. Inspired by a string of substitutions, a freshly energised Palace built up well and Ayew curled in a peach of a ball from the right for the diving Chris Richards to nod home well on 68 minutes. Two minutes later, Ayew himself was on the scoresheet, as he latched on to a marvellous Matheus Franca low ball from the left. Although Mateta missed it in the centre, he was analysed by the VAR for a potential offside but was found to be on. Before the final ten minutes, a Burnley substitute went wrong as Vitinho emerged to instantly give away a penalty by bringing down fellow Brazilian Franca. Mateta slotted that one away coolly despite more meddling VAR. Burnley's VAR luck was even worse, as David Datro Fofana thought he'd got one back as Vitinho looked to make up for the penalty with a fine run on the left. The low cross fired into Fofana's path off of Daniel Munoz, yet with Lorenz Assignon offside and on the line in Sam Johnstone's way - it was rightfully disallowed. Palace look to turn a corner as they get ready for Tottenham away from home. Burnley are rolling with the pucnhes, it seems. They look to next week's trip to Bournemouth as another chance to end a dismal run of games. Well, thank you for joining us today - we hope you enjoyed and enjoy the rest of your evening!\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n17:04\n\nFULL-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 3-0 BURNLEY\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:59\n\nSubstitution Jordan Pierre Ayew David Ikechukwu Ozoh\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:58\n\nThis win will be the first time since 2018-19 that Palace have completed a double over Burnley.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:56\n\nYellow Card Tyrick Kwon Mitchell\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:56\n\nIt's signalled here we'll receive a whopping 12 minutes of additional time.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:52\n\nYellow Card Jordan Pierre Ayew\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:52\n\nGREAT RUN AND... IT'S A GOAL FOR BURNLEY! DAVID DATRO FOFANA! Vitinho makes up for giving away that penalty with a stunning, jinking run and while Palace half clear, it's kept alive. Fofana then nods home from close range after the cross from the left deflects kindly off of Munoz. BUT WAIT, it's disallowed as Assignon was offside on the goal line! Commiserations Burnley...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:52\n\nSubstitution David Datro Fofana Jay Enrique Rodríguez\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:50\n\nSubstitution Jóhann Berg Guðmundsson Jack Frank Porteous Cork\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:50\n\nSubstitution Wilson Serge Eric Odobert Benson Manuel Hedilazio\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:47\n\nGoal David Datro Fofana\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:45\n\nAs we tick away the clock, it's worth mentioning Palace's fine record against promoted teams continues. They have lost just one of their last 10 Premier League home games against promoted sides (W6 D3), going down 3-0 against Fulham in December last season. The Eagles have won three of their four games overall against promoted sides so far this term (L1).\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:44\n\nYellow Card Maxime Esteve\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:44\n\nWow, this game has really taken off in this second half. Could we see a fourth here in South London?\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:40\n\nPENALTY! Vitinho brings down Franca as he's tracking back. Kompany's made a switch and the fresh Brazilian has made matters worse. Mateta steps up, yet VAR are again looking at this one. Again, Burnley on the wrong end of it.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:39\n\nPenalty Goal Jean-Philippe Mateta\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:38\n\nMateta's impact in the build up nearly proves detrimental. He missed Franca's ball and there was even question to the former Mainz man being offside. The VAR has had a look, and we're good to go. Goal. 2-0 it remains...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:34\n\nSubstitution Charles James Taylor Victor Alexander da Silva\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:33\n\nAssist Matheus França de Oliveira\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:31\n\nGoal Jordan Pierre Ayew\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:30\n\nAhamada forces a fine save from Trafford at his left post. It's taken little time for an impact from the substitute. A corner on the right will follow.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:30\n\nAssist Jordan Pierre Ayew\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:28\n\nGoal Christopher Jeffrey Richards\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:27\n\nMunoz has pulled up after a collision with Taylor in the air. It looks ok though, as we see some changes...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:25\n\nSubstitution Odsonne Édouard Matheus França de Oliveira\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:24\n\nAyew with some enterprising forward play here. He moves well for a big man and glides down the right side before propping up a ball to the back post. Trafford arrives though, and collects consummately.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:22\n\nDo not scratch your eyes... Burnley have come forward and presented us with an offensive offering. \"We've had a shot!\" the away fans sing. Fofana is the man to get it, latching on to a right-sided cross. However, his header is weak and loopy. Still, on the hour it's a place to start. On to the final 30 minutes...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:20\n\nAs I type that... Wharton connects with a well-hit drive from outside the box. It's curling and moving with some verocity, yet despite Trafford's athletic leap, it's just wide of the top left corner.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:20\n\nWhoops, fearless football is walking the fine line. Wharton flies in on a loose ball and he's got away with one here. He's taken two Burnley players out and not(!) got a second yellow. Any more of that, and you'd think Glasner would be wise to withdraw the ex-Blackburn teen.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:17\n\nPalace free kick on the right comes in at pace but the Clarets, or neon yellows we should call them, get it away.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:17\n\nThe naivety of youth, eh? Wharton, unfazed by his caution produces an excellent tackle to win back possession for the Eagles. He comes from behind and times it right down the side, poking the ball away. No Burnley complaints. Everyone loves a bit of fearless football.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:15\n\nLerma bursts forward and links up with Munoz on the right. He gets his pass back and drives for the byline but Burnley block it behind for the first Palace corner of the second period. Munoz flies up to meet it but Burnley get it away.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:13\n\nMitchell heads over! Ayew cuts back onto his left foot on the right of the box. He gets his head up and lifts it over to the onrushing Mitchell but he can't get over it and it flies high of Trafford's goal.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:11\n\nYellow Card Adam James Wharton\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:10\n\nLerma fires a speculative drive from range and it's straight at Trafford. Still, the Colombian found himself with way too much time and space. We've seen those go in before...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:08\n\nSECOND HALF KICK-OFF: Crystal Palace 0-0 Burnley, Adam Wharton gets the hosts back underway.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n16:03\n\nTrafford the stand out for Burnley: It's safe to say that James Trafford has been kept relatively on his toes and his two close range saves have worked well to chip into this weight of his £19 million transfer fee. Furthermore, a clean sheet could really help the youngster as well as the club's confidence. In bleak reading, Burnley have conceded 55 goals in their 25 Premier League games this season – in a complete campaign, they’ve only shipped more in 2009-10 (82) and 2018-19 (68) in the competition.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:56\n\nWell, it's not exactly been a classic. You'd be hard pushed to find this on Premier League years in the distant future. However, in both teams' bid to turn the tides on some dismal form - Palace are looking much more likely of the two to take the lead. Burnley haven't had a shot, let alone one on target yet, and of course, they'll be depleted for the second 45 minutes. Josh Brownhill saw red in what was likely the games most notable event so far. Although Palace have been unable to find the net, there's a certain new-manager swing and Mateta, Ayew and Edouard's presence has been emphasised by the tenacity of Munoz and the skill of Wharton. Trafford has been worked often from close range, yet the second half leaves everything all still to play for. Will Burnley get a shot off? Hopefully. Will they keep an illusive clean sheet? Well, this commentator is just hoping for some more action...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:51\n\nHALF-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 0-0 BURNLEY\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:50\n\nMunoz is part of some quick link up, yet in the end, he chalks up Palace's sixth offside of the day. A little too much frenetic energy in a crowded box...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:49\n\nSome determined running from Assignon has earned Burnley a corner on the right. Edouard heads clear.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:47\n\nAs we encroach the 45 minute mark, we're told of three additional minutes.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:47\n\nBleak statline for the travelling Clarets... they've yet to have an effort on goal. Zero compared to Palace's six...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:41\n\nEduoard stands over the ball. It sits within the D just on the edge of the box. The Frenchman lifts it... Trafford is all ends up and I think that's just clipped the bar. We don't take scimmers though, Odsonne...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:38\n\nSubstitution Mohamed Zeki Amdouni Joshua Jon Cullen\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:37\n\nWhile the game drifts into a brief lull of scrappy possession changing football, let's look back at the last meeting. The previous Premier League fixture between the sides saw Crystal Palace emerge victorious 2-0 at Turf Moor in November. Jeffrey Schlupp scored first for the Eagles in the 22nd minute. Tyrick Mitchell also found the net.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:37\n\nRed Card Joshua Brownhill\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:34\n\nAmdouni's miss-control gives Palace possession and denies a fast breakaway. Out of character perhaps, as Amdouni has at times been one of Burnley's brighter sparks this term. Alongside Lyle Foster, and Wilson Odobert, Amdouni has been part of Burnley's main attacking threats this season, that trio has scored four, three, and four times, respectively.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:33\n\nTRAFFORD BLOCKS AGAIN! It's a big stop once more from the Englishman - the corners aren't working so well, yet the short routine could catch Burnley out. Wharton floats in an inviting ball from a short corner rework. It goes to the back left post where Eduoard is waiting. He heads it straight at Trafford before it then trickles behind. It's all going one way here...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:30\n\nAnother corner is won for Palace on the left as Esteves clears. Ayew whips it in to no avail. Wharton takes the resulting kick to show a stat sheet that reads eight corners to Burnley's one.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:28\n\nFINE SAVE TRAFFORD. Corner is worked short then crossed. A header is flashed wide right but Andersen latches on and fires straight at Burnley's number one. It's a top block.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:25\n\nTrafford flights a long goalkick downfield. He'll no doubt be bolstened by the fact that each of Burnley’s last seven Premier League away wins against London sides has been to nil. They’re winless in their last 22 top-flight games when conceding at least once in the capital (D5 L17) since beating Chelsea 3-2 in August 2017. Will Palace score first here? They've got another corner here...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:23\n\nThe visitors have seemingly settled into a bit of possession here. Palace take a relaxed approach by keeping their shape, yet Ayew's had to track back and tackle to give Burnley a corner on the right for Gudmundsson to take. He curls it in but it's cleared relatively easily.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:21\n\nCLOSE! Palace are enjoying freedom in behind. Mateta gets in amidst cries of holding. He stalls then finds Ayew and his cross from the right is JUST missed by the head of Eduoard at the back post.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:18\n\nGoing back to the set piece allowance. Excluding penalties, only Nottingham Forest (15) have conceded more set piece goals than Burnley this season (13). However, the Clarets can be confident in defence as Crystal Palace have scored just a single goal in this manner, the fewest in the division.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:18\n\nSo far the complexion is clear. Palace have had six touches in Burnley's box. On the contrary, the Turf Moor residents haven't had one yet.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:15\n\nNice link up from Palace. Munoz latches onto a cutting ball down the right. He finds Wharton and his early ball is chested back out of the box by Eduoard. Palace just can't get on the end of it. Promising though...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:14\n\nBurnley glide a long ball forward, yet Taylor is a little too keen to dispossess Ayew. Foul for Palace and we reset.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:14\n\nMateta holds up the ball well in the area - however, he's offside. It's Palace's second of the match.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:14\n\nIt must be said, the early trend of the game looks to have been set. Burnley are prepared to soak up pressure with Palace holding the offensive aces. That said, excluding own goals, no side has had fewer different scorers than Crystal Palace in the Premier League this season (9 – level with Sheffield United). The injured duo Eberechi Eze (5) and Michael Olise (6) have netted 39% of their goals this term (11/28). Can their be inspiration in their absence?\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:11\n\nTrafford forced into a low claim here. Ayew slides a wishful, yet cultured ball in behind after running in from the right. A Palace player can't get on the end of it and the young stopper does well to gather in his six yard box.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:09\n\nBurnley seem happy to allow the set piece flurries - they're clearly confident in their physicality and aerial presence...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:08\n\nIt comes to nothing once more...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:08\n\nPalace have worked another corner here with Eduoard and Ayew linking up. Ayew takes from the left, but Taylor heads clear. Palace recycle and Andersen's deflected slide tackle reaps yet another set piece, this time on the right.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:05\n\nTrafford will be counting his lucky stars... that said, he's a keeper that's struggled at times this term. He has conceded 55 goals in 25 games this season, keeping just two clean sheets. Only two keepers have conceded more goals in their first 25 appearances in the competition; David Watson for Barnsley in April 1998 (58) and Wes Foderingham for Sheffield United this season (63). Let's see if he can put that early slip well and truly behind him...\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:05\n\nCharlie Taylor floats back a challenging pass for Trafford and the young keeper stumbles! It trickles wide, but Burnley hearts are pounding early. Luckily Palace's resulting corner ends up over the bar.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:02\n\nReferee Lewis Smith signals and Amdouni gets us underway in the South London sunshine.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:02\n\nKICK-OFF: Crystal Palace v Burnley\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:01\n\nNo pressure Oliver! Only one of the 15 managers to have taken charge of Crystal Palace in the competition have won their first game with the Eagles (D4 L10), with that sole victory coming for Alan Pardew against Tottenham in January 2015.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n15:01\n\nAs the players come out on to the pitch, Oliver Glasner gets a first taste of the atmosphere in the hot seat. He is set to become just the second Austrian to manage in the Premier League after Ralph Hasenhüttl.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:57\n\nAhead of KO, Palace’s win probability sits at 44.1%. Burnley on the other hand have 26.8% while a draw sits at 29.1%. Burnley have lost just two of their seven Premier League away games against Crystal Palace (W3 D2), with both of those defeats coming in 2018 (0-1 in January, 0-2 in December).\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:57\n\nToday's officials are led by on-pitch referee Lewis Smith for whom it will be a first Burnley game. His assistants are Ian Hussin and Eddie Smart. Fourth official today is Darren England while Michael Salisbury is primed on VAR duty.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:47\n\nVincent Kompany makes two Burnley changes with Aaron Ramsey ruled out for the season and Hannes Delcroix dropping to the bench.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:47\n\nBURNLEY SUBS: Arijanet Muric, Jack Cork, Jay Rodriguez, Manuel Benson, Hjalmar Ekdal, Vitinho, Josh Cullen, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Hannes Delcroix.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:47\n\nBURNLEY (4-4-2): James Trafford, Lorenz Assignon, Dara O'Shea, Maxime Esteve, Charlie Taylor; Wilson Odobert, Josh Brownhill, Sander Berge, Johann Berg Gudmonsson; Zeki Amdouni, David Datro Fofana.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:47\n\nOliver Glasner, in his first official game as Palace manager, names an unchanged side from the one that drew with Everton on Monday.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:47\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: Dean Henderson, James Tomkins, Nathaniel Clyne, David Ozoh, Franco Umeh, Naouirou Ahamada, Kaden Rodney, Matheus Franca, Luke Plange.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:42\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE (3-4-2-1): Sam Johnstone; Joel Ward, Chris Richards, Joachim Andersen; Daniel Munoz, Tyrick Mitchell, Jefferson Lerma, Adam Wharton; Jordan Ayew, Odsonne Edouard; Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:42\n\nBurnley suffered a 5-0 defeat against Arsenal at Turf Moor in their last league match, extending their winless streak to seven (W0 D2 L5), putting them in 19th place on 13 points, seven points adrift of safety with 13 matches remaining.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:42\n\nBoth sides are in the midst of Premier League winless streaks, as the visitors have missed out on three points in seven straight matches while the hosts hope to avoid their fourth straight game without a victory.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:42\n\nCrystal Palace are in 15th place on 25 points, having scored 28 goals and conceded 44. With 13 matches to play, the Eagles trail fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur by 22 points for a spot in the Europa League. Crystal Palace earned a point in their last Premier League match, drawing 1-1 at Goodison Park against Everton, extending their winless streak to three (W0 D1 L2).\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:37\n\nHello everyone, welcome to this live text commentary of Premier League action from Selhurst Park!\n\nCrystal Palace vs Burnley\n\n14:00\n\nFollow all the goals and latest action from the Premier League here with The Independent.
