        "text": "In the wake of Everton's recent financial breach and subsequent 10-point deduction, all eyes are now on Manchester City and Chelsea as they face investigations into their own financial practices.\n\nWhile Chelsea has not been charged, Manchester City is currently facing over 100 charges related to breaches of Premier League rules. The outcome of these investigations could have significant implications for the reigning Premier League champions and their rivals, including Liverpool.\n\nEverton's penalty and subsequent appeal have sparked interest among other clubs, including Liverpool, who are closely monitoring the decisions made regarding the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules. Manchester City's alleged breaches span a period of nine years, from 2009 to 2018, and involve a wide range of league regulations.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool player is like 'peak Lionel Messi' as Jürgen Klopp emulated in brilliant fans moment\n\nREAD MORE: Xabi Alonso could deal $49m transfer blow to Liverpool as Real Madrid eyes Mohamed Salah 'heir'\n\nLiverpool has a vested interest in the outcome of this investigation, as some of Manchester City's achievements during the period in question came at their expense. The 2013/14 Premier League title and the 2016 League Cup victory were both secured by Manchester City, potentially impacting Liverpool's own pursuit of titles and success in European competitions.\n\nThe potential punishments that Manchester City could face if found guilty are severe. The independent commission overseeing the case has the authority to impose a points deduction in the Premier League, similar to what Everton received. In more extreme cases, expulsion from the top-flight could also be on the table. Other possible consequences include suspending the club from playing league matches, ordering compensation, canceling player registrations, or imposing conditional punishments.\n\nThe commission may also make additional orders as it sees fit, raising questions about the potential reassignment of historical trophies won by Manchester City. It is clear that even a single proven charge resulting in a 10-point deduction, which is already a record-breaking penalty in the Premier League, would pale in comparison to the 115 charges against Manchester City.\n\nThe Premier League confirmed the charges in an official statement released in February. The allegations cover a wide range of Premier League rules, including accurate financial reporting, disclosure of manager and player remuneration, compliance with UEFA regulations, and adherence to profitability and sustainability guidelines. Detailing the charges, the Premier League wrote:\n\nIn accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has referred a number of alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules by Manchester City Football Club (Club) to a Commission under Premier League Rule W.3.4.\n\nDetails of the Premier League Rules that the Club is alleged to have breached are as follows:\n\n1.

In respect of:(a) each of Seasons 2009/10 to 2012/13 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to include full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager, namely:\n\n(1) for Seasons 2009/10 to 2011/12 inclusive, Premier League Rules Q.7 and Q.8; and(2) for Season 2012/13, Premier League Rules P.7 and P.8; and(b) each of Seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to include full details of player remuneration in its relevant contracts with its players, namely:\n\n(1) for Seasons 2010/11 and 2011/12, Premier League Rules K.12 and K.20;(2) for Season 2012/13, Premier League Rules T.12 and T.20;(3) for Seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15, Premier League Rules T.12 and T.19; and(4) for Season 2015/16, Premier League Rules T.13 and T.20.\n\n3. In respect of each of Seasons 2013/14 to 2017/18 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to comply with UEFA’s regulations, including UEFA’s Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2013/14, Premier League Rule B.14.6; and(b) for Seasons 2014/15 to 2017/18 inclusive, Premier League Rule B.15.6.\n\n4. In respect of each of the Seasons 2015/16 to 2017/18 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons on Profitability and Sustainability, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2015/16, Premier League Rules E.52 to E.60; and(b) for Seasons 2016/17 and 2017/18, Premier League Rules E.53 to E.60.\n\n5. In respect of the period from December 2018 to date, the Premier League Rules applicable in the relevant Seasons requiring a member club to cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations, including by providing documents and information to the Premier League in the utmost good faith, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2018/19, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;(b) for Season 2019/20, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;(c) for Season 2020/21, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;(d) for Season 2021/22, Premier League Rules B.15, B.18, W.1, W.2, W.15 and W.16; and(e) for Season 2022/23, Premier League Rules B.15, B.18, W.1, W.2, W.15 and W.16.\n\nCommissions are independent of the Premier League and member clubs. The members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel, in accordance with Premier League Rules W.19, W.20 and W.26.\n\nThe proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission’s final award will be published on the Premier League’s website.\n\nThis confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice.\n\nManchester City has consistently denied the charges and expressed surprise at their issuance. The club maintains that it has provided extensive evidence to support its position and welcomes an independent commission's review of the matter. They hope that this process will bring clarity and put the issue to rest once and for all.\n\nThe outcome of the investigation into Manchester City's financial practices will have far-reaching implications for the club and its rivals. If found guilty, the consequences could significantly impact their future prospects in domestic and international competitions. Liverpool, along with other clubs, will be closely following these developments as they unfold.\n\nLiverpool.com says: Whatever the outcome of City's charges, a verdict really needs to be passed sooner rather than later. Chances are though we won't hear anything for a good while. Liverpool though will be watching on with interest, and no doubt both managers will be asked about the situation ahead of Saturday's game at the Etihad.\n\n---\n\nYou may notice the below message on a small number of Liverpool.com articles.
