        "text": "Man City vs Inter: UCL final as it happened\n\nManchester City lift the Champions League with a 1-0 win over Inter Milan, completing the final leg of a historic treble for Pep Guardiola's side.\n\nMuch has been made of City's transformation this season. The height, the physicality, the introduction of a genuine target man to lead the line. In the Ataturk Stadium on Saturday, Pep's fortified side showed that they had the mettle.\n\nInter Milan, cup specialists under Simone Inzaghi, came into the game as underdogs but managed to keep City at a distance in the opening 45 minutes. Erling Haaland has been unplayable at times this year, but Inter marshalled him well. They disrupted City's play and frustrated their players.\n\nInter will have been the happier of the two sides after a goalless first half. City had suffered a key injury too, Kevin de Bruyne withdrawn due to a hamstring injury.\n\nIt looked, briefly, like things could go wrong for City in a game that would decide their season. But this team have a mental toughness to match their physical attributes.\n\nWhen the goal came, it was a distillation of the City from previous years. Dazzling feet from Phil Foden, a slipped through ball for the onrushing Bernardo Silva, then a clever pull-back and a frictionless finish from Rodri. It was classic Guardiola.\n\nAfter that goal Inter went straight on the offensive, knowing that they had 20 minutes to unsettle Guardiola's side. But this team do not cower, and would not be rattled. They relied on a couple of sharp saves from Ederson in the final minutes to keep Inter at bay, but in truth this felt different from previous City teams.\n\nFor once it was City who dictated the final moments, who knew when to slow it down and take their time. In the intense pressure of the Champions League, City have buckled in the past. This time around they stayed strong and stood tall.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nErling Haaland gets his hands on the cup\n\nFew members of this incredible Manchester City side have contributed more to the treble than Erling Haaland, the man brought in to deliver European glory. Haaland has scored 52 goals in all competitions, doing so in his debut season in English football.\n\nHe was fairly quiet in the final against Inter but had done so much already to get them to the final. He was close to tears after the full time whistle as the enormity of this achievement became clear.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nInvestment pays off for City chairman\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola and club chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak lift the trophy after City's Champions League triumph. The journey to take Manchester City to the top of the club game has been a long one, and one that has endured many bumps along the way. But under the guidance of Guardiola, who must surely now be considered the finest coach of his generation, they have reached the promised land.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nSeventh time's the charm for Pep and City\n\nIn recent years, Manchester City has seemed to find every conceivable way to avoid winning the Champions League. There have been late losses, punishing defeats and miniscule VAR decisions. But this year they looked like the real deal and Pep Guardiola's incredible team have lifted the big one.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nStones the key man in City success\n\nWhat a season it has been for John Stones. There was a time, not so long ago, when it seemed like he had slipped from first team consideration at Manchester City. He had always seemed like the ideal Pep Guardiola defender, but few would have predicted him forcing his way back into the team as the ideal Pep Guardiola midfielder.\n\nThe Englishman's technical abilities were never in doubt but his adaptability will have surprised more than a few onlookers in recent months. Transformed into an auxiliary midfielder, Stones has been an ever-present in recent months and has added crucial steel to City's absurdly talented midfield. He was pushed even further forward against Inter Milan, playing almost as an attacking midfielder at time, taking on more of the burden of creation after the substitution of Kevin de Bruyne in the first half.\n\nIt was a crowning performance from the imperious Stones, as City became kings of Europe.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nUCL Final: Guardiola joins rare group with third European title\n\nPep Guardiola was brought to Manchester City with the aim of winning the club's first European title. Finally, after years of near misses, he has done exactly that.\n\nThis triumph puts the Catalan coach on three European titles as a manager, putting him in very elite company. How many more with Pep get?\n\nRead more\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nJohn Stones thrives in new role\n\nWell, I did say that Stones was pushing forward a lot!\n\nThe Englishman's transformation from central defender to ball-playing midfielder has been one of the most notable parts of City's success in the second half of this season. Against Inter Milan he looked to be playing even further further, almost level with Kevin de Bruyne.\n\nNot only was he playing closer to the forward line, Stones was playing like a forward!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nAnother award for Erling Haaland\n\nWhat a season Erling Haaland has had in his first year in English football. The Norwegian sensation has won the treble, broken the Premier League scoring record and also finished as the top goal scorer in the Champions League.\n\nAnd terrifyingly, at 22 years of age, he's probably just getting started.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCity fans rejoice\n\nManchester City fans in the 4TheFans Fan Park celebrate after the team emerged victorious in the Champions League final. After years of near-misses Pep Guardiola's side finally got over the line against Inter Milan and secured a famous treble.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nDid Ederson win the Champions League?\n\nFor all Manchester City's attacking talents, and there are many, it was goalkeeper Ederson who starred in the crucial final stages. The City stopper had a couple of shaky moments early on in the final but he came into his own towards the end with two crucial saves.\n\nHe twice denied Inter Milan with sharp saves and came out to claim a dangerous cross with second remaining. Sofascore gave him the highest rating of any player in the final.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nWho is Man City owner Sheikh Mansour and what‚Äôs his net worth?\n\nFor the first time since 2010, Sheikh Mansour was in attendance for a Manchester City. He was there at the Ataturk Stadium to see the team that he owns lift the Champions League, the most coveted prize in club football.\n\nBut what do we know about the City owner, and how much is he worth?\n\nRead more\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nThree's the charm for Pep Guardiola\n\nFor the third time in his stellar managerial career, Pep Guardiola is a European champion. Crucially, however, this is his first UCL triumph since leaving his homeland of Barcelona, where he could call upon the era-defining talents of Lionel Messi.\n\nBringing European success to City, a club who has craved this trophy for so long, must rank among his greatest achievements as a coach.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nManchester City lift the Champions League\n\nHere it is, the moment that Manchester City lifted the Champions League trophy after years of heartache. It was Ilkay Gundogan, who has performed so well in recent months, who did the honours as club captain and brought a stunning season to a close.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n'We are the champions', blares over the stadium PA system.\n\nAnd they are. But not just of the Champions League, but of the FA Cup and the Premier League too. It's an incredible achievement and one that has only been managed once before in the history of English football.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nAs the City players take turns to hold the trophy aloft, Pep Guardiola takes a step back from the crowd of blue-shirted players to take it all in. He looks up, almost wistfully, at the golden confetti fluttering in the Istanbul night sky.\n\nIt's taken a while for him to get this team to the promised land, but get there they have.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nAnd he raises it high into the air\n\nMANCHESTER CITY ARE CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE\n\nGold confetti flies around the City squad and the team celebrates the ending of a historic season, one that ends with treble. What a season, and what a team!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nIlkay Gundogan picks up the cup and heads over the the rest of his teammates....\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nErling Haaland looks a little overwhelmed are he strolls onto the stage and past the Champions League trophy. No one has played a bigger part in this year's successes than him, and the season ends in glory.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nAnd now, Manchester City!\n\nThe Manchester City players are in a much more conversational mood as they step up to collect their medals. Pep Guardiola has a close embrace with Sheikh Mansour, the rarely seen but often-discussed City owner.\n\nThe City players gleefully collect their medals and take the places on the trophy lift stage...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nManchester City have formed a guard of honour for the defeated Inter players to pass through on their way to collect the medals. UEFA boss Gianni Infantino is taking his time with the process, having a little chat with the players as they go past\n\nMost of them look like they just want to get it over with.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nPresentation ceremony begins in the Ataturk Stadium\n\nWe're onto the medal-giving now, with the referee and match officials up first to receive their trinkets.\n\nNext up, a decidedly gloomy set of Inter Milan players.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nMANCHESTER CITY\n\nManchester City win the treble: what is ‚Äòthe treble‚Äô and which European men‚Äôs teams have won it?\n\nManchester City's achievements this year will go down as one of the great in the history of British football and one that few teams in Europe have ever managed. 'The treble' is often spoken of in hushed tones by soccer fans, but what does it actually mean?\n\nWe explain all...\n\nRead more\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nA new name on the trophy\n\nFor the first time in their history Manchester City are European champions. As we await for the presentation in Istanbul, a new name is being carved onto the famous trophy.\n\nHow many more with City win before Guardiola decides to leave? You get the feeling that this will not be their last...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nThe moment City became European champions\n\nAfter years of longing, Manchester City finally reached the promised land with a 1-0 win over Inter Milan. When the final whistle went the City players and backroom staff poured onto the pitch in jubilation, bringing to a close a long pursuit.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nDid Ederson win it for City?\n\nManchester City needed to massive saves from Ederson to ensure that they ended the game with a win. The Brazilian stopper made two crucial saves towards the end to keep his team ahead, just as Inter were gaining momentum.\n\nOpta found that City had an xG of 0.94 tonight, far less than Inter's 1.77.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCity fans rejoice!\n\nManchester City survived a late scare to clinch the Champions League trophy, the one priza that had eluded them under Pep Guardiola. The Premier League champions have been the best team in Europe in recent months and are deserved winners.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nFinally Pep Guardiola returns to the pinnacle of the European game and buries the memories of previous near misses. Inter Milan fought bravely against City but the Premier League champions did enough to secure the final leg of a famous treble.\n\nA goal from Rodri, coolly slotted past Onana, was the difference today and City have reached the promised land.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCity players collapse to the turf in the Ataturk Stadium having finally secured the one prize that had eluded them. Erling Haaland, who had very little involvement in the game, has his head in his hands and appears close to tears.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nManchester City, Champions League winners 2022/23\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n90+5\n\nPeep peeeep peeeep\n\nMANCHESTER CITY ARE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS\n\nIt ends 1-0 and Guardiola's side have done it!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n90+5\n\nCorner ball for Inter Milan a last chance now!\n\nInzaghi pushes someone on the touchline. Not sure who. Tensions are high!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n90+4\n\nA long ball is launched forward by Onana but Ederson is there to claim it. The City keeper collapses onto the ground. Just one minute remaining.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n90+2\n\nThe cross is cleared as far as Barella. The Italian slashes at a volley that flies over the bar. The minutes are slipping away for Inter now.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n90+2\n\nInter Milan win a free kick on the right wing, in a great position to deliver into the box...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n90+1\n\nErling Haaland and Andre Onana are both booked after a clash in the box. Inter free kick, launched forward.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n90\n\nFive minutes of added time\n\nFive more minutes, that's what we've got.\n\nCan Inter find an equaliser? Can City see it out?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n89\n\nInter Milan fans in the crowd hold their heads in their hands. That was so close to an equaliser.\n\nBut Inter are clearly not giving up here and they're on the attack again. It's Lukuka, in space, but his effort is dragged wide of the far post.\n\nCity goal kick. How long to go?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n88\n\nSO close! Lukaku\n\nWOWWW! The ball's worked in towards Lukaku but his header is saved and then pushed wide for a corner. Inches!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n88\n\nCity are definitely dropping deeper now, with all 11 players inside their own half as Inter build up on the halfway line. Simone Inzaghi is gesturing wildly on the touchline as his side patiently works their way up the pitch.\n\nGood play for Inter here..,\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n86\n\nNathan Ake dallies over a throw in in the full back area and is told to get a move on by the assistant referee. This is going City's way now, but you sense that they might be another chance for Inter in the closing stages. Can they make the most of it?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n84\n\nTwo more subs for Inter Milan as D'Ambrossio and Mkhitaryan come on for the final few minutes. It's Mkhitaryan's first appearance in weeks, can he spark a comeback?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n83\n\nRomelu Lukaku\n\nBooking for the Inter striker now, who was a little too zealous in his defensive duties. City have the free kick out wide, midway into the Inter half.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n82\n\nAfter a few minutes waiting on the touchline Kyle Walker comes on, replacing John Stones.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n81\n\nJohn Stones is down in the box with a shirt that appears to have been slashed down the side. Not entirely sure how that happened, and it doesn't look like we'll find out, he's being replaced.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n80\n\nBernardo Silva jinks his way down the right wing and is felled by Marcelo Brozovic. City win the free kick and eat up a little more time.\n\nSilva whips it in but Onana claims easily.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n79\n\nA brilliant flick-on from Romelu Lukaku forces a corner for Inter Milan. Can they work something here? No, it's Haaland back to head away.\n\nBut Inter come forward again... Barella's long-range effort flies over the bar.\n\nLittle over ten remaining now.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n77\n\nChance! Manchester City\n\nBrilliant from Phil Foden. The Englishman swivel in the middle of the Inter half and sprints in on goal, slipping through a gap in the Inter defence.\n\nHe's one-on-one with Onana but his low shot is comfortably saved.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n76\n\nIn the meantime Inter do make a substitute, two of them!\n\nRobin Gosens and Raoul Bellanova enter the fray for the final 15 of normal time.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nFree kick for a foul on Bernardo Silva and a chance for City to make that substitution. Kyle Walker comes on for... Wait, no he doesn't there seems to be some confusion on the City bench.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n72\n\nChance! Inter Milan\n\nNow we've got a game on our hands.\n\nRomelu Lukaku picks up the ball on the right and drives at the City defence, firing a low shot towards goal. Ederson gets down low to save. Can Inter keep this up?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n71\n\nWhat a moment that could of been. Nearly an instant response from the Italian side.\n\nIt wasn't a goal but it has certainly given Inter fans a boost. So close to equalising their fans are back on their feet.\n\nCity are readying Kyle Walker from the bench.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n70\n\nChance! Inter Milan\n\nIncredible! Inter Milan nearly go up the other end and score.\n\nThe ball bounced to Dimarco in the box and he lofted a head over the onrushing Ederson. The ball came back off the crossbar but Dimarco's second attempt is blocked by Lukaku!\n\nSo close!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nManchester City take the lead\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nBernardo Silva raced on a ball behind the Inter defence and fired it across the six yard box. Inter managed to repel the first ball but it fell to Rodri, arriving late in the box. The Spaniard curls the ball home from 15 yards to give City the crucial lead!\n\nWhat can Inter Milan muster now?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n67\n\nGOOOAAAAALLLLL! Manchester City\n\nAnd there it is, Rodri with the first goal of the Champions League final!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n66\n\nNearly a chance for Haaland. The City striker picks up a lose ball and drives at the Inter defence, looking to play a one-two with Foden on the edge of the box.\n\nThe pass is a little sloppy and Acerbi is on hand to mop up.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n64\n\nPlenty of shoving in the box and Inter are awarded a free kick. John Stones really seems to be in the heart of everything here, both good and bad.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n63\n\nJohn Stones receives it on the right flank and looks to play a low ball across to Haaland. An Inter defenders cuts it out and ball goes for a corner. Grealish to take.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n63\n\nNeat play from Inter see the ball worked out wide to Brozovic. It's whipped into the box by Barella but City clear, a chance to break now perhaps...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n62\n\nFirst signs of frustration from Haaland as he drops deep to receive the ball but loses it with a poor pass out to Grealish. Without De Bruyne's incisive passing City have struggled to get the ball into Haaland in positions where he can be dangerous.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n59\n\nNicolo Barella\n\nFirst booking of the game goes to the Inter midfielder for a pretty cynical challenge.\n\nCity lob the resultant free kick into the box but it's headed well over.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n58\n\nStill very little service for Erling Haaland. The Inter backline is doing a brilliant job of shielding the ball from his feet and forcing City out wide.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n56\n\nIt is time for Romelu Lukaku! The big Belgian replaces the big Bosnian as the focal point of the Inter attack.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n55\n\nInter work their way up the pitch and look to swing the ball into the City box. Guardiola's team manage to repel the ball but it simply goes back to Inter. This might be their best spell of the game from an offensive perspective.\n\nHang on, Edin Dzeko is down. It might be Lukaku time!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n54\n\nThe intensity of this game has definitely increased in recent minutes with both teams flying into challenges.\n\nIt's Foden who gives away a foul this time and screams furiously at referee Marciniak. It's heating up!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n52\n\nBig tackle from Gundogan in the middle to halt an Inter break and get his team on the counter. Grealish sets off on a mazy run but Darmian shoves him off the ball and gives away a foul.\n\nCity win the free kick but Grealish's cross is well over hit.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n51\n\nCity win a free kick on the halfway line as Darmian and Calhanoglu are a little to eager to dispossess Gundogan. It's a pretty obvious foul, but a promising sign for Inzaghi's team.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n48\n\nInter enjoy a decent spell of possession for the first time since the break and manage to work the ball through the City press. A raking pass out towards Dumfries is intercepted by Ake and goes for an Inter throw.\n\nThose sort of rapid switches have been a hallmark of Inter's play this season and could cause City problems.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n47\n\nMarcelo Brozovic goes down clutching his back after a knock from Silva. The referee initially waves away the Inter protests but stops play as Silva advances forward with the ball.\n\nBoth sides, naturally, are furious.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n46\n\nBrilliant play from Dzeko to hold off a number of City challenges and fires a low ball down the line to Martinez. The Argentine can't quite latch on to the pass and City recover the ball, but its a promising start for Inter.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n45\n\nAnd we're back\n\nThe second half is underway, let's see what Manchester City can do in the next 45 minutes.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nThe players are back on the pitch at the Ataturk Stadium for the second half. After 45 minutes of action the scores remain level, who will make the breakthrough?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nThe players are gathering in the tunnel and readying themselves for the second half, Pep Guardiola looks pretty nervous as he emerges from the City changing room.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nAnd a word for the Inter Milan fans\n\nFew would have expected this aging Inter Milan squad to make it to the final of the Champions League, but the Nerazzurri faithful are certainly making the most of the occasion.\n\nFor all the stars on the pitch, the Inter fans have been a constant force at the Ataturk Stadium. The longer this game remains 0-0, the more they will believe that an upset is on the cards here.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nWell, half time. What have we learnt?\n\nIf anyone was expecting Inter Milan to be brushed aside by the might of Manchester City they will have been surprised by the opening 45. City have, of course, dominated the ball but Inter's central six defenders and midfielders have made it all-but impossible to play through the middle.\n\nCity have only found space out wide, with Dimarco and Dumfries have proved worthy advisories. Haaland has had very little to work with so far, although he did force one sharp save from Onana.\n\nThere has been little attacking intent from Inter, but they have managed to disrupt City's play from defence. Will Guardiola be tempted to throw more forward in the second half? Let's see...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nSome more stats - and this is a fantastic (and sad) one:\n\nThe last time City were in a Champions League final, De Bruyne also went off injured in the game!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nHere's how Sofascore saw the game:\n\nCity dominated on the influence graph, but Inter certainly had their moments... let's see if things change in the second half.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nKevin De Bruyne suffers injury in Champions League final vs Inter: what injury has he got?\n\nThere were not a huge number of chances in the first half of the Champions League final, but there was one major talking point in the opening 45 minutes. Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne, so often the difference-maker, was substituted midway through the first half.\n\nWhat was it that forced the early switch?\n\nRead more\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nChampions League final scoreless at the break\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n45+2\n\nPeeep peeep peeeeep\n\nAnd there we go, half time. All square.\n\nInter Milan will be very, very happy with that half. For De Bruyne-less City, that was a frustrating half.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n45+1\n\nTo their credit, Inter are not content to sit back here and they are pressing the City defenders.\n\nCity work the ball up the pitch and Akanji finds a pocket of space around 25 yards out. The defender lets fly and it sails over the bar, much to the delight of Inter fans/frustration of Jack Grealish.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n45\n\nTwo minutes of added time\n\nNot long to go now...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n45\n\nAnother clipped pass from Onana finds the head of Edin Dzeko and the veteran forward flicks the ball on. No one's there to chase it, however, and City reclaim the ball.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n44\n\nFoden swings it in but his cross is over hit and the ball goes out for a Inter goal kick. Not long until the break now.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n41\n\nSimeone Inzaghi is berating his players as Gundogan finds a pocket of space on the left flank. City have had possession for the last couple of minutes now but havent been able to work the ball into a dangerous position.\n\nA change of pace from Jack Grealish looks to have sent him free down the wing he's bundled over by a desperate challenge from Dumfries. Free kick to City from the left wing, De Bruyne looks on...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n40\n\nLittle bit of play-acting from Acerbi to exaggerate the contact from Foden and win a free kick.\n\nInter will be very happy to get to half time at 0-0, five minutes of normal time remaining in the first 45.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n39\n\nThe Inter backline looks to be relishing this battle with Haaland. Francesco Acerbi flies into a challenge to clear the ball as it approaches the City striker. The three Inter defenders have managed to keep him quiet so far.\n\nHow long will it last?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n37\n\nIt looks like De Bruyne/Foden substitution is a straight swap with the Englishman moving into the City midfield. Foden is the closest to Haaland, who has struggled to get into the game so far.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n36\n\nInterest stat from the first 35 minutes in the Champions League final...\n\nManchester City have had 67% of the ball so far, but Inter have had 4 attempts on goal to City's 3.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n35\n\nKevin de Bruyne is replaced by Phil Foden.\n\nBad news for City as the Belgian magician is substituted. Still, not a bad replacement. Let's see how that changes the City set up.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n34\n\nKevin de Bruyne is definitely moving a little gingerly, if you'll pardon the pun.\n\nThe City superstar is clearly feeling the after-effects of that knock and Foden is still on his feet in the City technical area.\n\nWait.. he's signalled to the bench, De Bruyne is going off!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n31\n\nThere's definitely been a bit more confidence in Inter's play in the last few minutes. More willingness to play out from the back, a bit more time in midfield to play their passes.\n\nIt must also be said that the Inter Milan fans in the stands are looking pretty confident too. Their side of the stadium is bouncing in unison, a sea of blue and black shirts rippling across one flank of the Ataturk Stadium.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n30\n\nKevin de Bruyne\n\nA real concern for City here as Kevin de Bruyne is down injured. The Belgian hobbles off to receive treatment and Phil Foden is readied on the touchline.\n\nIt looks like De Bruyne will be fit to continue, but that's one to keep an eye on here.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n28\n\nAll of Inter's attacking intent so far has come down the right, with Onana finding Dumfries in space on the flank. That combination gets the ball forward to Dzeko, who is felled by a City challenge. Free kick Inter.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n26\n\nClose! City\n\nWe're up and running now. A powerful run from De Bruyne creates the space to slip the ball through to Haaland.\n\nThe Norwegian has a tough angle to contend with but he fires the ball goalwards. Onana is equal to it and nudges it wide of the post.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n25\n\nClose! Inter\n\nWhat on earth?! An Inter attack appeared to have fizzled out but a loose pass from Ederson was intercepted by Brozovic in the Inter midfielder.\n\nHe tries to lift the ball into the empty net but his effort goes wide.\n\n'RELAX,' Guardiola screams at his team.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n24\n\nOnana launches one forward to the left wing towards the head of Federico Dimarco. Akanji muscles the wing back out of the way and the ball trickles through to Ederson.\n\nIn response to that passage of play, Dzeko makes clear that he believes that he might be a better target in future.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n23\n\nNicolo Barella goes down under a challenge from Gundogan, who did catch the Inter midfielder on the ankle. It looks like he'll be fine though.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n21\n\nInter's work without the ball really is excellent.\n\nA few players will likely find their way into the referee's notebook before too long but they are as organised as they are dogged. City struggling to build any passing moves.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n20\n\nChance for Inter Milan to break as Martinez darts onto a loose ball. He looks for Dzeko outside him but the Bosnian's touch lets him down.\n\nThe ball drops to Brozovic, 30 yards out, and he lets fly at goal. It goes way, way over the crossbar.\n\nTwenty minutes gone, the noise is astonishing. Both sides will be fairly happy with how it's gone.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n17\n\nBit of a telling off for Marcelo Brozovic there, who makes a fairly cynical chalelnge on Bernardo Silva as he skips through the midfield. Referee Szymon Marciniak is keeping his hands in his pockets for now, however.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n16\n\nPep Guardiola, by the way, is doing his best Diego Simeone impression in an all-black ensemble with a tight-fitting suit jacket. No sign of Simeone in City's play, though.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n15\n\nCity are very clearly split into a five and a five without the ball. Five forwards pressing the Inter backline; five back on the halfway line to protect against the long ball from Onana.\n\nThe Inter keeper's ability to play accurate long passes is crucial to the way Inzaghi's side play and Guardiola is clearly trying to limit their effectiveness.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n14\n\nCorner kick for Inter, first chance of the match...\n\nDimarco plays it short to Barella but his curled cross is easily cleared.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n13\n\nAnother foul on Stones, whose ability to play through the press is being severely tested in the opening stages.\n\nGrealish is next, going down under a challenge from Brozovic. Inter are not giving City a second here.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n11\n\nBit of handbags in the corner between Stones and Martinez after the Inter forward hassle Ederson for a high ball. The Argentinian World Cup winner's dogged running will be crucial for Inter tonight is they are to disrupt City's play.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n9\n\nFoul for Inter on the halfway line and an opportunity for them to take a breathe.\n\nThe Inter fans, however, will not be taking a breathe and they remain intent on belting out their support. There's an incredible noise from that side of the stadium, can they roar their team on to victory?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n7\n\nJust on Stones' positioning: He's starting on the right for City with Ake on the left. Akanji and Dias are playing as the two central defenders.\n\nThis is, of course, subject to Guardiolaism and it would not be a surprise to see them popping up elsewhere soon.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n6\n\nThe most striking thing about the opening stages is just how high John Stones has been pushing up the pitch. He's not only higher than Rodri but seems to be ahead of Gundogan too, almost level with De Bruyne just behind the forwards.\n\nIf he keeps moving forward at this rate, Stone will start next season as a striker.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n5\n\nClose! Man City\n\nA slick City passing move works the ball out to Silva on the right and the Portuguese winger darts in field, past Dimarco and into the box. He tries to curl one with his left but it goes just wide. Not by much though.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n3\n\nIt might be a little direct, but it nearly got Erling Haaland in behind the Inter defence. The big Norwegian mistimed him run slightly and was called offside but he managed to find himself in a little bit of space there.\n\nNot the best start for Inzaghi's men.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n2\n\nSurprisingly direct start from City here. Inter Milan are trying to unsettle Guardiola's side from the off and the Blues' backline has resorted to some pretty long ball stuff.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\n1\n\nAn earlier touch for Edin Dzeko, the former City player starting in the Champions League final at the age of 37. Should he score tonight, he will become the oldest player to score in the final of this competition.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nAnd we're off\n\nChampions League final 2022/23, is officially underway!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nWho is Szymon Marciniak, referee for 2022/23 Champions League Final: Man City vs Inter?\n\nHere's the man who will be getting us going in Istanbul, Polish referee Szymon Marciniak...\n\nSeconds to go now\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nOk then, the players are out\n\nThere's just moments to go until kick off in the Champions League final. Both sets of players are out on the pitch in the fervent atmosphere of Istanbul's Ataturk Stadium.\n\nIn case you missed it earlier, here's how the two teams line up...\n\nMan City XI: Ederson, Akanji, Stones, Dias, Ake, Rodrigo, Gundogan (C), De Bruyne, Bernardo, Grealish, Haaland\n\nInter XI: Onana; Darmian, Acerbi, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Brozovic, √áalhanoglu, Dimarco; Dzeko, Lautaro Mart√≠nez\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nLook who's here!\n\nFor the first time since 2010, City owner Sheikh Mansour is in attendance for a Manchester City game. The promise of a historic treble and a first ever Champions League triumph is clearly enough to get him over to Europe for the occasion. What a tantalising game we have in store here.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nAnd finally, it's Alesso!\n\nWe're now onto Swedish DJ and music producer Alesso, who will close out the pregame show at the Ataturk Stadium. He brings things to a mighty crescendo with a blare of euro-dance and flashing lights.\n\nBig noise, big fireworks, and a big mist across the pitch to greet the players when they head out on to the pitch.\n\nRight, music over. Pitch clearing in process. Let's have have football!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nTonight's pre-game star, Anitta!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nNext up, Anitta!\n\nThe Brazilian singer Anitta takes over from Burna Boy on stage. Controversially, perhaps, she's rocking a blue and black outfit for the occasion!\n\nA secret Inter Milan fan? Who knows. It's certainly quite a show.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nSilver-suited Burna Boy takes to the stage\n\nFireworks, dancers, flashing lights and a whole lot of pizazz! The Afro-beats star has taken over the stage with a stunning performance. This is a huge production from the Nigerian star and a truly sensational way to start the final.\n\nThere's going to be a football match on there in a few minutes!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nBurna Boy up now with the pre-game show\n\nWhat a spectacle for everyone in attendance tonight!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nThe stage is set...\n\nWhat a venue for football! The Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul is primed for a thrilling Champions League final which will be decisive in both team's seasons.\n\nFor Manchester City, the Champions League is the promised land. For Inter Milan, a chance to return to the top table of European football.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nVIDEO: City fans abandoned vehicles to walk to Atat√ºrk Olympic Stadium\n\nThere's now just 20 minutes until the scheduled kick-off for the Champions League final at the Ataturk Stadium. Last year there was considerable delay due to issues outside of the stadium and at one point it looked like something similar could unfold in Istanbul.\n\nEarlier today City fans were seen travelling to the stadium on foot after traffic jams caused huge delays for taxi users. However the stadium has filled up nicely and it looks like everyone is in with plenty of time.\n\nThe game will kick off at the local time of 10pm, as scheduled.\n\nRead more\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCity fans pack out the Ataturk Stadium\n\nThe Inter Milan fans certainly filled up their side of the stadium a little earlier, but the Manchester City contingent are in the house now and the Ataturk Stadium is readied for the Champions League final. The 74,000-capacity stadium was initially built to aid Turkey's unsuccessful bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nThey were beaten by Beijing for that honour, but that stadium is a fitting venue for the Champions League final.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nErling Halaand eyes Champions League success\n\nAhead of the Champions League final, Erling Haaland spoke about his desperation to bring European success to Manchester City. This year's league title was the club's fifth in six seasons but the Champions League has always evaded them.\n\n‚ÄúCity won the Premier League two times in a row, for example, before I came here ‚Äì they know how to win the Premier League,‚Äù Haaland said. ‚ÄúThe only thing they miss is the Champions League so you can think and read between the words and the lines. I am coming here for a reason.\n\nThe Norwegian continued: ‚ÄúOf course I feel pressure. I would lie if I said I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm here to try to do a thing that the club has never done before and I‚Äôll do my best.‚Äù\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nVAR in Champions League: how does it work? The rules explained\n\nThe Champions League final is the pinnacle of club football and every single decision made by referee Szymon Marciniak will be poured over be supporters around the world.\n\nThe Polish official won't be on his own though. He will be assisted by a team of Video Assistant Referees (VAR) helping with decision-making in the Champions League final. Here's how it will work...\n\nRead more\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nLights, camera... Salt Bae\n\nOf course! No elite football match is complete without an appearance from 'Butcher-to-the-stars' Salt Bae, sprinkling salty stardust over the occasion.\n\nThe chef and business mogul sparked a FIFA investigation after the 2022 World Cup final when he managed to worm his way onto the pitch to take pictures with a number of Argentina's winning players. Let's hope that he keeps his distance this time around.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nPep Guardiola speaks ahead of UCL final\n\nManchester City come into the game still searching for their first European triumph. They reached the final in 2020/21 but were beaten by Premier League rivals Chelsea in Portugal. Ahead of today's game, Guardiola was asked what affect that experience had had on the side.\n\n\"I hope so, but I don't know. Experiences must be learn but sometimes you don't learn it, it's just a football game,\" Guardiola said, when asked if his team was wiser after defeat to Chelsea in 2021.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nWhat are the teams for the UCL final?\n\nIn case you missed it, here's the starting XIs for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Inter Milan. Both managers had big decisions to make and there are a couple of surprises in the two sides.\n\nPep Guardiola has opted not to start Kyle Walker, the lightening-fast full back who performed so well agaisnt Real Madrid. In his place, Pep goes with Manuel Akanji on the right of the defence.\n\nFor Inter, Simone Inzaghi has decided to leave Mkhitaryan on the bench and play Marcelo Brozovic in the middle instead.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nWill the Champions League final be delayed?\n\nLast year's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid was delayed by nearly 45 minutes due to poor organisation on the part of French officials. This time around UEFA will be desperate to avoid a repeat but there have been reports of huge traffic jams in Istanbul that is making it difficult for fans arriving by car.\n\nThere were a number of videos on social media showing City fans walking to the stadium having abandoned their taxis. However at this stage it looks like everyone will be able to get to the stadium in time and there will be no need to delay kick off for the final.\n\nWe'll keep you up to date on developments from around the Ataturk Stadium...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nUEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nManchester City vs Inter Milan: times, how to watch on TV, stream online | UEFA Champions League\n\nThere's just an hour to go until kick off now and the Ataturk Stadium is filling up nicely. We will, of course, be bringing you full live coverage from the Champions League final here at AS USA, but you can also watch or stream all the action.\n\nIf you're in the United States, here's how you can watch or stream Manchester City vs Inter Milan...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nWhat a noise from the Inter support!\n\nFew expected Inter Milan, a rather ramshackle band of players past their prime, to make it to the final of the Champions League this season. They have failed to find consistency in the league but Simone Inzaghi's cup specialists have thrived in the big games and now find themselves just 90 minutes from history.\n\nThe Inter Milan fans are clearly keen to savour every moment and had started to fill up their end of the Ataturk Stadium hours before kick off. What an atmosphere we have tonight!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nEdin Dzeko looks to make history against his former side\n\nInter Milan booked their place in the Champions League final with a comprehensive 3-0 aggregate victory over city rivals AC Milan in the semi-final. Inter were set on their way by an early first leg goal from Edin Dzeko, the Bosnian striker who used to play for Manchester City.\n\nDzeko scored against AC Milan at the age of 37 years and 54 days, making him the fifth-oldest player to score a goal in the Champions League. If he scores against his former team, City, he will break the record for the oldest scorer in a Champions League final.\n\nThe current record is held by AC Milan legend Paulo Maldini, who scored at the age of 36 years and 333 days against Liverpool in 2005. That game ended in tears for the Italian, however, after Liverpool staged a stirring comeback to win the trophy on penalties.\n\nDzeko is now 37 years and 85 days and he will be hoping to channel a little of Maldini from 18 years previous. Strangely enough, both this year‚Äôs final and the 2005 edition take place in the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nHow many goals has Haaland scored in the Champions League?\n\nIt was no surprise to see that Erling Haaland will lead the line for Manchester City tonight, despite coming into the final on a comparatively poor run of goal-scoring form. The Norwegian sensation has hit 50 goals in all competitions this season but just once in his past six matches.\n\nNevertheless, Haaland has helped to fire City to the Champions League final in his debut season at the club. We take a look at the numbers...\n\nRead more\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nConfirmation of the Champions League final lineups\n\nSo here's how the two teams line up this evening. The big talking point is the absence of Kyle Walker, so impressive in the semi-final against Real Madrid, from the City starting XI. For Inter Milan, former City striker Edin Dzeko starts up front.\n\nMan City XI: Ederson, Akanji, Stones, Dias, Ake, Rodrigo, Gundogan (C), De Bruyne, Bernardo, Grealish, Haaland\n\nInter XI: Onana; Darmian, Acerbi, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Brozovic, √áalhanoglu, Dimarco; Dzeko, Lautaro Mart√≠nez\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nAnd here's the City starting XI\n\nWill Pep Guardiola overthink it? No, it doesn't look like he has as he names the team that has dominated the Premier League in recent months.\n\nThe only slight surprise is the omission of Kyle Walker from the defence, Pep opting for Akanji and Ake instead.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nInter Milan team news confirmed\n\nHere's how Simone Inzaghi's side line up for the final today! No major changes for Inter this evening, Brozovic starts ahead of Mkhitaryan in midfield and captains the Italian side.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nWhat time is the Champions League final kick off?\n\nSoccer fans from all around the world will be tuning in to tonight's game between Manchester City and Inter Milan. The game will begin at 10pm local time in Turkey, here's when kick off is wherever you are...\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nJamie Carragher reflects on UCL glory days\n\nToday's final will be held in the Ataturk Stadium, Istanbul. It's the largest stadium in Turkey and was once the site for one of the most famous games in Champions League history.\n\nJamie Carragher was part of the Liverpool side that lifted the trophy back in 2005 with a stunning victory over AC Milan. Liverpool were 3-0 down at half time but managed an incredible comeback to become European champions. A happy memory for Jamie, clearly.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nWhat is the biggest win in a Champions League final?\n\nThe final of European club football‚Äôs flagship competition is often considered to be the highest standard of football played anywhere in the world. Whether in the Champions League or its predecessor, the European Cup, the chance to be crowned European champion is an opportunity that few players get in their careers.\n\nSometimes, however, the final can turn into something of a mismatch as one team runs riot. Manchester City are considered the strong favourites against an Inter Milan side who have struggled for consistency in Serie A this season.\n\nThe biggest game in European club football has finished with a four-goal winning margin on four separate occasions, and a Milan team has been on the winning side in two of them‚Ä¶\n\n7-3 Real Madrid vs Frankfurt (1960)\n\n4-0 Bayern vs Atl√©tico (1974)\n\n4-0 AC Milan vs Steaua (1989)\n\n4-0 AC Milan vs Barcelona (1994)\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nHow much will Inter Milan earn for having Paramount+ as shirt sponsor for the Champions League final?\n\nSharp-eyed soccer fans will have noticed something odd about Inter Milan's shirts during their run to the Champions League final. In the early stages they wore shirts emblazoned with the name of cryptocurrency firm 'DigitalBits'.\n\nIn the semi-final against AC Milan they wore plain shirts with no sponsor, and in preparation for the final against Manchester City the name of 'Paramount+' has been added to the jerseys.\n\nWe take a look at why this has happened, and how much Inter stand to make from this final alone...\n\nRead more\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nIt's heating up in Istanbul\n\nFor man observers Inter Milan go into the Champions League final as underdogs, but their passionate fanbase will be confident of pulling off a surprise victory. The Nerazzuri have reached the Champions League final for the first time since 2010 and are certainly making the most of their return to the top table of European football.\n\nThere's less than two hours until kick off at the Ataturk Stadium and the atmosphere is really getting going now!\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL\n\nHow much do 2023 Champions League final tickets cost?\n\nSpecial delivery!\n\nThe fans are starting to arrive at the Ataturk Stadium, and that's not all. The coveted Champions League trophy has just arrived at the stadium in the Turkish capital and both sets of players will be desperate to get their hands on the iconic award.\n\nWhich captain will be lifting it later this evening?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nManchester City fans pass police checkpoints\n\nAfter the fiasco of the 2021/22 final, UEFA will be desperate to ensure that this year's Champions League final goes off without a hitch. Last year Liverpool fans were caught up in a series of bottle-necks and excessively stringent policing, forcing UEFA to delay the start of the game.\n\nLiverpool fans, trying to enter the stadium legally, were hit with pepper spray by overly officious police and many reported being squashed into tight areas.\n\nUEFA promised major improvement for this year's final and it looks like things are going well so far. We'll keep you updated from the Ataturk Stadium, Istanbul.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nChampions League final 2023 venue: where is the Atat√ºrk Olympic Stadium and what is its capacity?\n\nThere's less than three hours to go until kick off in the Champions League final and fans of Manchester City and Inter Milan are already starting to take their place for the spectacle. This year's final will be hosted in the Atat√ºrk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe iconic venue was also the site for one of the most famous Champions League finals of all time, Liverpool's astonishing victory over AC Milan in 2004/05.

This time around it is their opponents, Manchester City, who are on the bring of a famous treble.\n\nHowever the Nerazzuri are a fierce proposition when it comes to one-off cup fixtures and in the likes of Eden Dzeko have the big game experience to cause anyone problems.\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nCity fans in good voice in Istabul\n\nIs this their year? It's been more than a decade since Manchester City were first crowned Premier League champions but European success has evaded them throughout that time. At various points under Pep Guardiola City have looked like the best, most complete team in Europe but they have contrived to fall just short in Europe.\n\nThis time, however, with Erling Haaland spearheading the attack, City fans are confident that they can finally break their UCL duck. The City support are out in force in the Turkish capital, will they still be in high spirits by the end of the night?\n\nWilliam Gittins\n\nThere's a little over three hours to go until kick off in Istanbul! I'm Will Gittins and I'll be taking over live feed duties for the rest of the evening.\n\nPep Guardiola's Manchester City go into the game as clear favourite to not only lift the Champions League, but to secure a famous treble.

But he‚Äôs super normal. He has the character and the mental and physical ability to always be on top form. That allows him to maintain his composure on the pitch. Plus, he‚Äôs a winner, he‚Äôs so when playing with his ‚ÄòI‚Äôm coming for you‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôm back‚Äô... He reminds me a bit of what we saw with Cristiano and Messi.

However, he heads into his first ever Champions League final with an overall tournament scoring record that is quite something. The 22-year-old has racked up 35 goals in 29 career UCL games, including 12 in 10 for Manchester City this season.\n\nHe's needed fewer appearances than any other player to reach 35 goals, and it's a haul that means he has already risen to 18th in the Champions League's all-time scoring charts.\n\nWe take a look at Haaland's goal exploits in the competition.\n\nas.com\n\nErling Haaland trains for Manchester City on Friday, ahead of today's Champions League final.\n\n(Photo: EFE/EPA/SEDAT SUNA)\n\nas.com\n\nCity and Inter to sport home kits\n\nBoth sides will be in their home kits today, by the way.\n\nInter are the designated ‚Äòaway‚Äô team, but it has been confirmed that they will be in their traditional blue and black stripes, with black shorts and socks.
