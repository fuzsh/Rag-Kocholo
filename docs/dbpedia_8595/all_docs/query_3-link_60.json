        "text": "As is well known by now, Manchester City has been accused of breaching Premier League financial regulations. The club has been charged with over 100 alleged rule breaches, which will be reviewed by an independent panel — with that hearing now penciled in for late next year.\n\nThe scheduled date means that any potential points deduction will not impact the current season, denying rivals Arsenal and Liverpool a boost in their quest for the Premier League title. If found guilty, this is just one of a number of sanctions Pep Guardiola's side could theoretically face, with expulsion from the league the most extreme measure available.\n\nThe investigation into Manchester City's alleged breaches of Premier League rules was launched in 2018, with the potential offences dating back further. As a result, there is eagerness within the game for a conclusion to the saga. The Daily Mail reports that Manchester City and the Premier League have tentatively agreed to go to an independent panel in late Autumn next year, with the verdict expected in the summer of 2025.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool transfer news as $20m teen 'on radar' and Jürgen Klopp 'looks closely' at young keeper\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool team vs LASK predicted as Luis Díaz and Ben Doak in and Kostas Tsimikas out\n\nThis timeline suggests that Guardiola, Manchester City's current manager, may not be around to face any possible fallout. His contract with the club is set to expire around the same time as the anticipated verdict. Whoever takes over from Guardiola could face a nervous wait, as delays and appeals could potentially push the date back even further.\n\nWhatever the verdict, there will be no recourse to the Court of Arbitration for Sport for either Manchester City or the Premier League, with the division's regulations giving final authority to the independent panel. However, there is a mechanism for an appeal to a second panel.\n\nManchester City is accused of breaching Premier League regulations over a long period, starting from the 2009/10 season. However, the club vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Arsenal, who narrowly missed out on last season's league title, currently lead the way in the campaign with 30 points from a possible 39. Manchester City and Liverpool are close behind, while Tottenham Hotspur, who had a strong start, have fallen behind due to injuries.\n\nGuardiola has overseen a dominant period at Manchester City, leading the team to a remarkable treble of silverware last season and clinching its first ever Champions League title. In response to the charges, Guardiola stated, \"We are innocent until guilt is proven. I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait and see, and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen what penalties Manchester City will face if found guilty of breaching financial regulations. The outcome of the investigation will have significant implications for the club's future — and while it will not help Liverpool's cause this season, it will undoubtedly be among those watching most closely, having gone toe-to-toe with Guardiola's behemoth over a number of years.\n\nLiverpool.com says: All Liverpool and everyone else can do is watch and wait. All things considered, an outcome one way or another in the summer of 2025 would not be too bad, although it remains to be seen whether or not that is an optimistic projection.\n\nObviously, the wait in the meantime will be frustrating. Manchester City's treble occurred in curious circumstances, with the legitimacy of the achievements effectively suspended, pending the outcome of this massive hearing. This campaign and the next one will now be beset by the same uncertainty, which is frustrating for Guardiola, Liverpool and the rest of the league in equal measure.\n\nBut a resolution is edging ever closer. Whatever the verdict, and whenever it comes, it will be seismic.\n\n---\n\nYou may notice the below message on a small number of Liverpool.com articles.
