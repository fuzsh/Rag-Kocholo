        "text": "The football world has reacted with astonishment after the Premier League alleged reigning champions Manchester City had breached 100 cases of its financial rules and face points deduction or expulsion from the league if proven. In breaking news on Monday evening, the Premier League released a statement that alleged City had made the alleged breaches, which span from the 2009-10 season to the 2017-18 campaign, according to an independent commission.\n\nAnd Manchester City claimed that the were surprised at Monday's announcement, and referred to \"extensive engagement\" with the Premier League on the matter. The club also said they held \"irrefutable evidence\" in support of their position.\n\nSO GOOD: Socceroos World Cup hero makes history in huge Premier League move\n\nNOT HAPPY: Pub team slams football icon Dwight Yorke over A-League swipe\n\nUPROAR: NZ media slammed over response to women's football thrashing\n\nIncredibly, the club's chief executive Ferran Soriano is understood to have only been notified by his Premier League counterpart Richard Masters of the referral over alleged breaches as the statement was going live on the league's website. The sanctions that can be handed down to Manchester City are vast and would be detrimental to the club that has dominated England over the last few years.\n\nThese include a fine, a deduction of points or the expulsion from the league. The commission has the power to make such sanctions conditional on defined actions being taken within a fixed time period, and respondents have a right of appeal.\n\nThe alleged breaches are said to be around the \"accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club's financial position\". The accurate financial information required related to \"revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs\".\n\nThe second set of breaches listed refers to alleged breaking of rules \"requiring a member club to include full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager\" related to seasons 2009-10 to 2012-13 inclusive. The club's manager between December 2009 and May 2013 was current Italy boss Roberto Mancini.\n\nThe third section deals with alleged breaches of Premier League rules requiring clubs to comply with UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations, between 2013-14 to 2017-18.\n\nFootball world reacts to Manchester City news\n\nThe football world has reacted with utter shock over the allegations. Many fans have reacted with anger at the news and have called for Manchester City to be relegated if the breaches are proven.\n\nFormer Liverpool player Lucas Leiva took to social media to ask if he was a Premier League champion with Liverpool finishing a close second to Manchester City in the league a few years back. He was questioning whether Liverpool would be retrospectively handed the title.\n\nCoach Pep Guardiola made the statement in 2022 that if the Manchester City hierarchy ever 'lied' to him he would leave the club. The hearing will now go on behind closed doors.\n\nwith AAP"
