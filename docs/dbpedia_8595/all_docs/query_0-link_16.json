        "text": "Manchester City ended a run of four Premier League matches without a win when they beat Luton last time out and Pep Guardiola will want his team to continue that upwards trajectory.\n\nThe champions are currently fourth in the table and trail Liverpool by four points – though they can close that to one with a win this afternoon. City host Crystal Palace at the Etihad and despite an injury to Erling Haaland will be confident of securing a victory.\n\nThe Eagles have slipped to 15th having won none of their previous five games. Just one draw and four defeats has turned the pressure up on Roy Hodgson who could send down a statement by beating City on their own turf today.\n\nFollow the latest action from the Premier League below.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace LIVE: Premier League updates\n\nManchester City host Crystal Palace in the Premier League\n\n24’ - GOAL! Grealish puts City ahead (MCI 1-0 CRY)\n\nMan City XI: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Ake, Gvardiol, Rodrigo, Lewis, Bernardo, Foden, Grealish, Alvarez\n\nCrystal Palace XI: Henderson, Clyne, Ward, Guehi, Andersen, Mitchell, Olise, Riedewald, Richards, Schlupp, Mateta\n\nManchester City FC 2 - 2 Crystal Palace FC\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n17:07\n\nOlise's stoppage-time penalty snatches a late point for Palace as they come from behind to draw 2-2 with City. The first half was dominated by City, and Grealish gave them a deserved lead with a low finish into the bottom corner which was ruled just onside by VAR. After the break, Alvarez had a goal ruled out due to Rodri ducking under his free-kick from an offside position, but Lewis did double their lead moments later with a lovely volley. In the 76th minute, Mateta pulled one back for Palace with their first shot on target as he tapped Schlupp's cross into an empty net, and he won the penalty in the final minute when Foden kicked his shin. Olise coolly slotted it in to deny City the win. Guardiola's side miss the chance to move second as they register their third consecutive home draw, and they stay fourth, three points off Liverpool. Next up for them is Urawa Reds in the Club World Cup semi-final on Tuesday. It's a huge point for Palace given their recent run of form. They stay in 15th as they turn their attention to Brighton at home on Thursday. That's all for today, goodbye!\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n17:01\n\nFULL-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 2-2 CRYSTAL PALACE.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n17:00\n\nEze goes down cheaply near the corner flag under pressure from Gvardiol to win a late free-kick. It's whipped in by Olise, but he can't pick out a team-mate in the crowd in the middle.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:59\n\nSubstitution Rico Henry Mark Lewis John Stones\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:57\n\nPenalty Goal Michael Akpovie Olise\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:57\n\nPENALTY TO PALACE! Franca's cross caused City all sorts of problems, and Richards can only knock it onto Mateta. He sees Foden coming and knocks the ball away before getting a kick to the shin. He goes down and the referee points to the spot. City are furious, but Palace have the chance to snatch a late point here!\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:54\n\nPalace's final change of the game sees Eze making his return from an ankle injury in place of Clyne for the four minutes of stoppage time.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:54\n\nIt's a poor pass out from Ederson and Olise cuts it out, pushing Gvardiol aside so that he can swing in a cross. He gets too much on it in his haste though and curls it straight out of play.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:52\n\nPalace look tired and there's not a lot of movement in front of City, who are passing it between their defenders. Olise has a half-hearted attempt at a press, but the hosts easily pass their way around him.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:50\n\nGOOD SAVE! Foden comes up with another bit of brilliant play that opens up the space ahead of him. He works it out to the right though, with Silva cutting inside before curling a shot on goal that Henderson stretches to tip away.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:49\n\nAfter another patient spell of possession in front of Palace, Lewis goes for a more direct option with a long ball down the right. It's too heavy for Silva though, and Henderson is able to claim it.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:46\n\nOzoh does brilliantly to hold off Gvardiol and keep the ball in play, but Olise is fouled by Ake when he's played in. He tries to take the free-kick quickly, but slips as he does, giving City a chance to get back.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:44\n\nPalace are making a double change now. Riedewald is the first to go off, with Ahamada on in his place.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:44\n\nSubstitution Jeffrey Schlupp Matheus França de Oliveira\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:44\n\nGrealish plays himself out of a tight spot well, and Rodri benefits by sweeping it out to Silva in space down the right. His first touch lets him down for the first time today, and he can't stop the ball from rolling out of play.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:42\n\nCity uncharacteristically get a little sloppy with the ball, and Palace are enjoying their best spell of possession here. It's all deep in their own half though, and they don't look quite sure how to get themselves upfield.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:39\n\nAssist Jeffrey Schlupp\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:38\n\nGoal Jean-Philippe Mateta\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:37\n\nIt's Dias who pushes forward down the right for City now, and he gets a yard on Mitchell to drill a low cross into the six-yard box. It's too close to Henderson though, and the keeper turns it away with an outstretched leg.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:36\n\nOlise sets off down the right again, and gets the better of Ake as he pulls it back to Ozoh. Just like every time before, there are more sky blue shirts flooding back, and Palace can't do anything with it.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:35\n\nPalace have everyone apart from Mateta back in their own box to continue to deny City any hope of passing it into their box. Silva is still trying to make something happen down the right, but can't dribble past Mitchell.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:31\n\nGrealish and Gvardiol are linking up well down the left, but City are once again struggling to put the ball into the box. They switch it out to the right and back again, but a sloppy pass from Rodri eases the pressure on Palace.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:29\n\nPalace's best out ball has been Olise all game, and he has another chance to run down the right. He has to hold it up again as support is slow to get up, and that gives Rodri the chance to stop him from getting into the box.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:27\n\nHenderson hurt himself making that save, and he's complaining about a muscle problem. Having just come back from injury, Hodgson might be worried about him, but the keeper is back on his feet to carry on.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:27\n\nGREAT SAVE! Foden is scrambling to reach the ball after a loose touch, but it ends up being a good set-up for Silva. He hits it first time, curling his long-range shot towards the far post, and at full stretch, Henderson tips it wide.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:26\n\nPalace just can't get out of their own half at the moment, and they're hesitant to press high upfield. The City centrebacks are allowed to carry it a long way, and their passes over the top are causing a few problems.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:24\n\nOzoh tries to keep Palace's rare chance to attack alive, but Foden is just too quick for him. Both Riedewald and Richards try to stop him from mounting a counter, but give away a free-kick in the centre circle.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:21\n\nCity win their sixth corner of the game, and Alvarez looks to pick out Gvardiol in the middle once more. He glances his header towards goal, but Henderson is able to hold onto it.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:20\n\nPalace look a little shaky after City's latest spell, and Henderson sloppily puts the ball out of play. City are pushing forward with intent once more, but the visitors aren't as compact as they once were.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:17\n\nGoal Rico Henry Mark Lewis\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:16\n\nNO GOAL! Grealish won a free-kick just outside the box on the left and Alvarez floats a lovely cross straight into the far post. Rodri had just stepped up too early though and ducks under the ball. He's judged to be interfering with play, and the goal is ruled out. Still 1-0 City!\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:14\n\nAll of City's outfield players created a chance in the first half against Palace. This is the first time on record (2006-07 onwards) that 10 different players have created a chance for one team in the first half of a Premier League game.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:12\n\nCity have started the second half in similar vain to the first, but a sloppy pass from Gvardiol gifts it to Olise. He surges down the right but has to wait too long for support, so his eventual cross is cut out.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:08\n\nCity get us back under way for the second half!\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n16:03\n\nFor the majority of the first 45 minutes, it was all one team, even if City did struggle to break down their opponents more often. Guardiola will be after more of the same, just with a more clinical edge. As for Palace, they started to show glimpses of the problems they could cause, and Hodgson will be looking for them to pick up where they left off in an attempt to get back into this game.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:56\n\nGrealish's goal gives City a 1-0 lead over Palace at half-time. The hosts dominated from the first whistle, but after Henderson was forced into a good save to deny Alvarez early on, City struggled to create anything clear-cut until something a little special. Foden's lovely turn on the edge of the D opened up the space to slide in Grealish, who picked out the bottom corner and was shown to be just onside by VAR. At the other end, Palace's best chance came from a free-kick given away by Ederson, but Olise's shot was just too high.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:51\n\nHALF-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 1-0 CRYSTAL PALACE.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:50\n\nPalace are attempting to counter once more, but when Mateta touches it out to Olise, he has three City players around him. He can't get far, but does manage to win a free-kick when he's nudged over by Gvardiol.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:48\n\nInto the first of five added minutes here, and City are back to camping out in Palace's half. The visitors are slow to close them down, not wanting to lose their shape to gift their opponents any space.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:47\n\nSO CLOSE! Olise steps up to take the free-kick just outside the box and he isn't far away! He lifts his effort over the wall and it has Ederson scrambling, but it sails just over the bar, landing on the roof of the net.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:44\n\nYellow Card Ederson Santana de Moraes\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:43\n\nCLOSE! Silva's floated free-kick is glanced on by Richards at the far post, and Lewis keeps it alive on the right. He touches it back to Foden, who tries his luck from range, coming close as it skims just wide of the top corner and into the side netting.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:42\n\nThe ball is there to be won, but Ake just gets there ahead of Andersen's sliding challenge. There isn't too much contact, but the Dane is shown the first yellow card of the game.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:40\n\nGrealish has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time, with each goal giving Manchester City the lead.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:38\n\nCLOSE! Silva gets the better of Mitchell down the right again, and his cross is only flicked on as far as Gvardiol on the far side. He brings it down before hitting it on the half-volley, but a nick off Ozoh helps it into the side netting.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:35\n\nWhile defending a free-kick, Ward slips awkwardly and the medical team are quickly rushed onto the field. He hands the captain's armband to Guehi as he gets back to his feet, and Palace's injury woes get worse.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:35\n\nSubstitution Joel Edward Philip Ward David Ikechukwu Ozoh\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:33\n\nMateta is truly playing as a lone striker, and when Palace do manage to get the ball to him, he's struggling. He holds it up well against Walker this time, but has nobody to pick out in support, meaning City win it straight back.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:32\n\nGOOD SAVE! The midfield is very compact, so when Dias can't pick out a short pass, he clips it over the top, where Gvardiol has gotten between two of the centre-backs. He drills his shot on goal, but Henderson gets behind it to smother the effort.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:30\n\nCity quickly win it back from the restart and go back to their patient play until Riedewald steps in to win it back in midfield. He looks to set Mateta on his way, but the linesman's flag cuts it short.\n\nGOAL! Manchester City 1-0 Crystal Palace (Jack Grealish 24’)\n\n15:28\n\nCity finally break the deadlock and it’s been coming! Ruben Dias slides the ball to Phil Foden on the edge of the box, with his back to goal, and Foden turns, slips a ball into the path of Jack Grealish, who finishes first time with his right foot into the far corner beyond Dean Henderson.\n\nOooh, but could this be ruled out by VAR? Is Grealish offside when Foden plays the ball into him?\n\nFrom one angle, Grealish looked to be standing in an offside position, but as VAR changes view, it looks a lot tighter than it originally did. It takes them a long time to draw the lines in, but when they do, it shows that he was just onside. The goal stands!\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:25\n\nAssist Philip Walter Foden\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:24\n\nGrealish leaves the ball behind in a turn, and Olise instantly sets off on the counter. He has support to his left and looks for Schlupp, but his first touch forces him wide, and City comfortably deal with the danger.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:22\n\nCity have already had 75 per cent possession in the first 20 minutes, and they're continuing to patiently try and open up space. Palace's switch to a back five looks to be working perfectly so far.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:20\n\nCity are upping the pressure and keeping Palace penned back deep in their own half. Silva is already getting a lot of joy down the right, spinning past Mitchell with some clever footwork, but his cross is cleared by Andersen.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:18\n\nBLOCK! Silva touches it into the byline for Lewis to pull back, and his low ball causes all sorts of confusion. It pinballs off Mateta to Foden, whose first-time shot hits Guehi, and his block just rolls wide of the far post.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:17\n\nIt's a brilliant run from Grealish down the left as he just breezes down the wing before teeing up Foden. That's when Palace decide to get touch-tight, and he has no space to work in.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:15\n\nSince Guardiola was appointed City manager, only Manchester United (three) have won more away league games against the Citizens than Palace (two).\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:13\n\nWIDE! Dias stops Schlupp in his tracks, and he sets Lewis on the counter. He takes it to the edge of the D before teeing up Rodri, but his first-time shot flies wide of the far post.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:12\n\nCHANCE! Walker's low, fizzed cross is blocked by Guehi, and it rebounds back out to Dias on the edge of the box. He catches the shot sweetly, but it's just too high as it sails over the bar.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:09\n\nCity's first corner results in a quick second, and Alvarez curls this one deep to the far post. Ake nods it back into the crowd and Dias stretches to poke it back out to the Dutchman, but he was caught on his heels.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:07\n\nGOOD SAVE! Silva touches it back to Walker, who floats a lovely cross onto the edge of the six-yard box. Alvarez gets a glancing touch with his head, and Henderson stretches to tip it wide for a corner.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:06\n\nAndersen is too casual when Henderson plays it out to him and Grealish pounces onto it. He's the furthest forward so has to go back, and Palace can breathe a sigh of relief when Rodri plays it straight out of play.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:04\n\nCity knock it neatly through Palace, but Grealish comes back from an offside position to pick out Foden. Henderson takes the resulting free-kick, sending it long, but he fouls Ake when he tries to hold him off.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:01\n\nOlise gets the game under way for Palace!\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n15:01\n\nThe teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:59\n\nRoy Hodgson makes five changes from their defeat to Liverpool last Saturday and they're all enforced. Sam Johnstone, Odsonne Edouard, Jefferson Lerma and Will Hughes are all injured, while Jordan Ayew is suspended, so they're all out. Henderson and Mitchell return from injury to start, with Olise, Riedewald and Mateta also being brought in.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:55\n\nAfter making wholesale changes for the Champions League game in midweek, Pep Guardiola goes back to the side that beat Luton last weekend with just one swap. Lewis comes into midfield in place of Kovacic, who drops to the bench. Grealish is the only one to have started both previous games, and he's shaken off a knock to retain his place. They're still without Erling Haaland and Jeremy Doku through injury though.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:50\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: Naouirou Ahamada, Matheus Franca, James Tomkins, Eberechi Eze, David Ozoh, Tayo Adaramola, Malcolm Ebiowei, Remi Matthews, Ademola Ola-Adebomi.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:50\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE STARTING XI (5-4-1): Dean Henderson; Nathaniel Clyne, Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Michael Olise, Jairo Riedewald, Chris Richards, Jeffrey Schlupp; Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:46\n\nMANCHESTER CITY SUBS: Kalvin Phillips, Manuel Akanji, Sergio Gomez, Matheus Nunes, Stefan Ortega, Mateo Kovacic, Oscar Bobb, John Stones, Mahamadou Susoho.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:42\n\nMANCHESTER CITY STARTING XI (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Josko Gvardiol; Rodri, Rico Lewis; Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish; Julian Alvarez.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:38\n\nAs for Palace, they sit at the other end of the table and are looking to end a winless run of their own. They haven't managed a victory in their last five outings (D1 L4), even dropping the lead to lose 2-1 to Liverpool last weekend. They've actually won just one of their previous nine matches (D2 L6), and have a poor record against City, winning just two of their last 16 games against the Citizens. Both of those victories did come at the Etihad though.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:34\n\nCity are looking to close the gap to the table before they go off to play in the Club World Cup, and a win here would lift them into second, above Arsenal on goal difference. They were winless in four in the Premier League (D3 L1) but managed to turn things around with a comeback win against Luton Town last time out in the competition (2-1). They come into this game on the back of finishing a perfect Champions League campaign with their win over Red Star Belgrade and will be looking to follow that up with another three points here after drawing their last two league games at home against Liverpool and Tottenham.\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:34\n\nHello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Manchester City and Crystal Palace at the Etihad Stadium!\n\nMan City vs Crystal Palace line-ups\n\n14:17 , Mike Jones\n\nMan City XI: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Ake, Gvardiol, Rodrigo, Lewis, Bernardo, Foden, Grealish, Alvarez\n\nCrystal Palace XI: Henderson, Clyne, Ward, Guehi, Andersen, Mitchell, Olise, Riedewald, Richards, Schlupp, Mateta\n\nManchester City vs Crystal Palace\n\n14:00\n\nFollow all the goals and latest action from the Premier League here with The Independent.
