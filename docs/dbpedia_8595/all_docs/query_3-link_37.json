        "text": "Manchester City know that they'll be crowned champions if they beat West Ham on the final day of the season this afternoon.\n\nAfter the Citizens' 2-0 win over Tottenham in midweek, Pep Guardiola's side are on the cusp of a fourth consecutive Premier League trophy.\n\nFollow Premier League title race LIVE HERE\n\nSubstitute goalkeeper Stefan Ortega made a crucial save with the game at 1-0 to deny Heung-min Son in a one-on-one before Erling Haaland scored a late penalty to seal all three points.\n\nSo, it doesn't matter what happens in Arsenal's final game against Everton, live on talkSPORT, as long as City win.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hammers will want to send David Moyes off in the best way by getting a result at the Etihad.\n\nThis will be the Scotsman's last match as West Ham boss, with his contract set to expire at the end of the campaign.\n\nMan City vs West Ham: Title decider\n\nMan City are unbeaten in the Premier League since December and have won eight domestic games in a row.\n\nThey are almost unstoppable and it's hard to see how they don't get the job done against a West Ham side who have nothing to play for.\n\nGuardiola's teams are built for this sort of situation, and they are on the brink of something no club has ever managed.\n\nCity will be bolstered by their incredible record in this fixture, having gone unbeaten in their last 16 Premier League games against West Ham (W13 D3), since a 2-1 home loss in September 2015.\n\nManchester City are the only side yet to lose a home Premier League match this season (W13 D5). City are looking to remain unbeaten at home in a top-flight season for a fourth time, along with 1904-05, 1920-21 and 2011-12, while manager Pep Guardiola has only gone a full top-flight season unbeaten once before, with Barcelona in 2009-10.\n\nWest Ham have lost 15 of their 17 Premier League away games against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, with the exceptions being a 1-1 draw (January 2008) and a 2-1 win (September 2015).\n\nWest Ham have conceded at least once in all 17 of their Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium – only Tottenham have played at a specific venue more in the competition without ever keeping a clean sheet (18 at Emirates Stadium).\n\nMan City vs West Ham: Team news\n\nMan City: Ortega, Walker, Dias, Akanji, Gvardiol, Rodri, Doku, Bernardo, De Bruyne, Foden, Haaland\n\nSubs: Stones, Ake, Kovacic, Grealish, Alvarez, Luiz, Carson, Bobb, Lewis\n\nWest Ham: Areola, Zouma, Mavropanos, Cresswell, Coufal, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Emerson, Kudus, Antonio, Paqueta\n\nSubs: Fabianski, Johnson, Cornet, Ings, Alvarez, Ogbonna, Earthy, Casey, Mubama\n\nReferee: John Brooks\n\nManchester City go into this match looking to become the first team in the history of the English top-flight to win four titles in a row. It would the sixth title overall for Pep Guardiola, with only Sir Alex Ferguson ever winning more titles in the top-flight (13).\n\nBefore their 1-0 defeat at Brentford last season, Manchester City had won their final league game in each of Pep Guardiola’s first six seasons in charge. They’ve not lost their final league game in consecutive campaigns since a run of three between 2005-06 and 2007-08.\n\nWest Ham have lost their final league game in each of the last two seasons, last doing so in three in a row between 2013-14 and 2015-16.\n\nMan City vs West Ham: What has been said?\n\nGuardiola is still anticipating a tough match at the weekend.\n\nSpeaking after the win over Spurs, he said: \"The tennis players say 'the serve to win Wimbledon', the last game, is the most difficult one.\n\n\"We know what we're playing for. The tension is there.\n\n\"Everyone come to the stadium and make noise.\n\n\"We'll have one day off, two days to prepare, and then we will do our best.\"\n\nWest Ham have lost 5-2 at Crystal Palace and 5-0 at Chelsea in their last two Premier League away games; the last team to concede 5+ goals in three consecutive top-flight away games were Blackburn Rovers (April-August 1965), while West Ham last did so in April 1932.\n\nMan City’s Kevin De Bruyne has six assists in Premier League final games – it’s the most of any current player, with only Nolberto Solano providing more in the competition’s history (7). De Bruyne’s assist for Haaland against Spurs on Tuesday took him to 112 in the Premier League, with only Ryan Giggs having more in the history of the competition (162).\n\nThis will be David Moyes’ 198th and final Premier League game in charge of West Ham – no permanent manager has a higher win rate for the Hammers in the competition than the Scotsman (37.1%, same as Alan Curbishley).\n\nMan City vs West Ham: Date and how to follow\n\nThis Premier League game is scheduled to take place on Sunday, May 18.\n\nKick-off at the Etihad is scheduled for 4pm.\n\nThe game will be broadcast on Sky Sports Premier League, with their coverage starting at 3pm.\n\nSky Sports customers can live stream this via the app using their mobile, tablet or computer devices.\n\nYou can also purchase a Sky Sports Day Pass from NowTV for £11.98 while Channel Four will broadcast highlights later in the evening.\n\ntalkSPORT.com will also be across the action with a dedicated live blog.\n\nTo tune in to talkSPORT through the website, click HERE for the live stream."
