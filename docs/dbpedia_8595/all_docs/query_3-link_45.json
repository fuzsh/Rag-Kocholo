        "text": "City referred to an independent commission over alleged rule breaches between 2009 and 2018\n\nPremier League says club breached rules requiring it to provide ‘accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position’\n\nEnglish soccer champions Manchester City have been referred to an independent commission by the Premier League over alleged breaches of its financial rules.\n\nThe alleged breaches span a period from the 2009/10 season to the 2017/18 campaign.\n\nThe club are alleged to have breached league rules requiring provision ‘in utmost good faith’ of ‘accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position’.\n\nThe Premier League says the accurate financial information required related to ‘revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs’.\n\nThe second set of breaches listed refers to alleged breaking of rules ‘requiring a member club to include full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager’ related to seasons 2009/10 to 2012/13 inclusive.\n\nThe club’s manager between December 2009 and May 2013 was current Italy boss Roberto Mancini.\n\nThe second set of alleged breaches also refers to requirements for a club to include full details of player remuneration within the relevant contracts, for the seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16 inclusive.\n\nThe third section deals with alleged breaches of Premier League rules requiring clubs to comply with Uefa Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations, between 2013/14 to 2017/18.\n\nCity were banned from Uefa competitions for two years by European soccer’s governing body for alleged breaches of its FFP regulations in February 2020, but the sanction was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in July of the same year.\n\nThe fourth set of alleged breaches relates to the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules in seasons 2015/16 to 2017/18 inclusive.\n\nFinally, the club are alleged to have breached league rules requiring member clubs to cooperate with and assist the Premier League with its investigations, from December 2018 to date.\n\nThe Premier League statement concluded: ‘The proceedings before the commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League rule W.82.2, the commission’s final award will be published on the Premier League’s website.\n\n‘This confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League rule W.82.1. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice’.\n\nSportsPro says…\n\nThis news has been more than four years in the making. The consequences for City could be dire.\n\nThe club has been charged with more than 100 alleged breaches of financial regulations and faces a raft of different sanctions if found guilty. A fine, points deductions and expulsion from the Premier League are among potential punishments.\n\nMake no mistake, City will fight until the end. The club already managed to get its two-season European competition ban lifted, with CAS finding that City had not disguised equity funding as sponsorship, though they had failed to cooperate with Uefa’s club financial control body’s (CFCB) investigation. A lack of cooperation was not deemed worthy of a two-season ban.\n\nCity will have been vindicated by that decision and no doubt hope they can again disprove the latest charges against them. Considering it took the Premier League since 2018 to reach this point, a final resolution is unlikely to be imminent.\n\nIf City do lose the case, we enter uncharted waters. There is no real precedent in the Premier League’s history for how the club could be punished. City’s wealth, courtesy of the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), means a fine would be of little consequence. Relegation, however, would be harshly felt, no matter how deep the club’s pockets are."
