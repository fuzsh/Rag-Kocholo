        "text": "Manchester City face off against Inter Milan in at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul on 10 June.\n\nInter and City’s paths to the Champions League final\n\nSimone Inzaghi’s men cruised through to the final thanks to a comprehensive 3-0 aggregate victory over San Siro co-tenants AC Milan, an outcome which was never in doubt after they went two goals ahead early on in the first leg.\n\nThe heavyweight semi-final clash between City and Real Madrid looked as if it was going to be rather harder to call after an evenly-matched first leg in Spain, but Pep Guardiola’s men completed blitzed last year’s Champions League winners at the City of Manchester Stadium on Wednesday, despite Erling Haaland unbelievably failing to find the net.\n\nHow many times have Manchester City and Inter won the Champions League?\n\nInter have long been considered part of European soccer’s ‘elite’, having won the European Cup/Champions League on three occasions (1963-64, 1964.65 and 2009-10). City, of course, are a much more recent addition to that particular group of clubs and, after over a decade of trying, are going in search of their first ever victory in the continent’s top competition.\n\nManchester City vs Inter: the first time\n\nBut despite both teams sitting among the best in Europe, they have never actually played each other in European competition. This is the first ever season that both teams have made it past the group stages of the same edition, which has limited the chances of their paths crossing.\n\nCity and Inter have faced off in pre-season friendlies before, however, with the Italians winning 3-0 at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore in 2010, while the Premier League side won by the same scoreline in the Dublin Super Cup the following year."
