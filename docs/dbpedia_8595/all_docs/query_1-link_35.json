        "text": "Neil Warnock is staying on as manager of Crystal Palace, despite the Football League's confirmation earlier today that the club have been docked 10 points with immediate effect after going into administration.\n\nThe club's chairman Simon Jordan had been attempting to attract new investment in the club, who have been late in paying their players twice this season. But on Tuesday Brendon Guilfoyle, Chris White and John Russell of the P&A Partnership were appointed administrators. Now Palace find themselves in a relegation battle after falling from ninth to 21st in the Championship table, just three points clear of the bottom three.\n\nWarnock met Guilfoyle this morning to discuss his future and that of the club. \"Neil has no intention of leaving,\" said Guilfoyle. \"He wants to see the outcome of the administration and see what the future holds.\""
