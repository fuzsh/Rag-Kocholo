        "text": "Manchester City begin another Premier League season as defending champions, favourites and potential record breakers - chasing five titles in a row.\n\nYet some bookmakers have City at short odds such as 14-1 for relegation, alongside West Ham and Brighton. Others are not offering any odds on City to go down.\n\nThat's because this season will almost certainly see a conclusion to the 115 charges against City for alleged breaches of Premier League financial rules, with the case due to start this year.\n\nThe storyline of the 2024-25 season will be dominated by what happens with City's hearing.\n\nThe outcome of a separate legal case brought by City against the Premier League's associated party transactions (APT) rules, which determine whether sponsorship deals are financially 'fair', is expected in the next few weeks.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since City were hit with the 115 charges of alleged financial irregularity - charges they strongly deny.\n\nBut with City's period of unprecedented success of four Premier League titles in a row - alongside Everton and Nottingham Forest's points deductions for breaches of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) last season - the case prompts many football fans to put 'What about Manchester City's charges?' and other similar questions into Google.\n\nBBC Sport addressed the most popular search terms around the case and assessed the latest information.\n\nEffectively the charges allege that Manchester City cheated.\n\nWe only have the information published in Der Spiegel to go on, but the charges identified allege that:\n\nFor nine years to 2017, the club did not provide accurate financial information about their revenue\n\nThat from 2009 to 2013, they didnât give full details of how much they were paying their manager\n\nFrom 2010 to 2016 they didnât give full detail around payments to players\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018 they didnât comply with Uefa FFP regulations\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018 they didnât comply with the Premier Leagueâs PSR rules\n\nAnd finally, from 2018 onwards, they did not co-operate with the Premier Leagueâs inquiry\n\nNow, if we go back to Der Spiegel, the allegations were around driving more money into the club from owner Sheikh Mansour through fictitious sponsorship deals, paying then manager Roberto Mancini to act as a consultant to a club in Abu Dhabi and giving players more money than was going through the accounts.\n\nIn theory, this would have allowed City to sign more and better players than they would normally have been able to.\n\nIn the period in question, they won Premier Leagues in 2012 and 2014, finishing runners-up twice, the FA Cup in 2011 â beaten finalists in 2013, and the EFL Cup in 2014 and 2016.\n\nWithout the additional money, the argument goes, they would not have won what they did and would not have been as far advanced as they were when Pep Guardiola arrived in 2016 and turned them into the most successful team in the world, culminating in them winning the Treble in 2023.\n\nThere are a number of club officials, including director Simon Pearce, chief executive Ferran Soriano, chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak and owner Sheikh Mansour whose involvement is pivotal.\n\nThe same is also true of new Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada, who worked for the City group in various guises from 2011 and negotiated many huge deals.\n\nThe honest answer is no-one knows and of course they will only be punished if they're found guilty.\n\nA new report published on 12 August claims the hearing could start as early as next month.\n\nIt had originally been expected to be heard in the autumn, with a verdict in spring 2025.\n\nHowever, The Times claim, external, citing sources close to the case, that the independent commission is now due to begin hearing the case in \"mid-to-late September, unless there are further legal delays\", with a decision \"at the start of 2025\".\n\nBBC Sport has, as yet, been unable to verify those reports. The Premier League and Manchester City have not commented.\n\nThe case will be detailed and the arguments multifaceted.\n\nCity have already been largely successful in winning a similar case with Uefa - they were fined 10m euros by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) when they overturned a two-year Champions League ban imposed by European football's governing body, largely for non-compliance with rules.\n\nThe club accepted the Cas ruling because they said they didn't trust Uefa. However, a number of allegations were dismissed because Cas ruled they were time-barred.\n\nThe same rules do not apply in the Premier League.\n\nGuardiola said in one press conference he would like the hearing \"this afternoon\" so that the club could clear their name once and for all. That timescale was impossible, but there is a recognition of how long this has now been dragging on.\n\nDer Spiegel published the leaked documents in 2018. Cas concluded the Uefa case in 2020, yet still we wait for a Premier League resolution. It is impossible to say why it took two and a half years for the Premier League to bring its case.\n\nThe only clue comes in the charges, namely that from 2018 to 2023, City allegedly did not provide the required documents and information to the Premier League and are accused of not acting in the âutmost good faithâ.\n\nIn other words, City dragged their feet, which is at odds with Guardiolaâs words.\n\nThis is the question repeated every time there is a PSR decision and completely overlooks the complexity of the City case.\n\nNottingham Forest and Everton didnât actually deny a breach of PSR rules, they put forward mitigation for why they had.\n\nThe cases themselves were relatively simple. The independent commissions had to decide to what extent they accepted the mitigations, and the same for the appeal panels.\n\nIn contrast, City are facing 115 charges, some of which date back to 2009. In addition, City are said to have concealed payments made by Sheikh Mansour through third parties and disguised them as sponsorship revenue, which in itself was inflated.\n\nThis is detailed, serious stuff and the club deny it. The legal argument simply cannot be heard in the same timescale as the Everton and Forest cases. Even if the hearing is later this year, it will probably be months before a decision is reached.\n\nPremier League chief Richard Masters was asked a similar question by UK government MPs when he appeared before the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee earlier this year and replied: \"I can [understand] but they are very different charges.\n\nâIf any club, the current champions or otherwise, had been found in breach of the spending rules, they would be in exactly the same position as Everton or Nottingham Forest.\n\n\"But the volume and character of the charges laid before Manchester City, which I obviously cannot talk about at all, are being heard in a completely different environment.\n\n\"There is a date set for that proceeding. Unfortunately, I can't tell you when that is but it is progressing.\"\n\nSpeaking again in April 2024, at a European Leagues meeting in London, Masters added: \"The date is set. The case will resolve itself at some point in the near future.\"\n\nThis case cannot go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). But either side could appeal and a fresh hearing arranged. There would have to be grounds for an appeal but, as with many aspects of this case, the detail would be key.\n\nIn that previous FFP case City said they did not trust Uefa, so freely admitted they did not co-operate with their investigation, preferring to take their chances with Cas, a decision that was vindicated.\n\nThat backstop of Cas is not an option with the Premier Leagueâs investigation.\n\nGuardiola has said in the past that if City are found guilty he would leave. At other times he has referred to the club's immediate response to the charges, which was: \"The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position. As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.\"\n\nHowever, occasionally, when the mood takes him, he offers support to his owners, most recently this in November 2023: \"[Letâs] wait until the sentence [judgment]. I know [some] are in a hurry but I know what happened with Uefa. Just wait.\n\n\"We are innocent and people have to know we are innocent until the sentence.\"\n\nAsked again about his future should the club be found guilty, Guardiola said: \"I will answer when I have the sentence. You are questioning like we have been punished. And in the moment we are innocent until guilt is proved. I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future [if] it depends on being here [Premier League] or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nClubs have to submit their financial results to the relevant governing body and show they have operated within the rules. In the cases of Nottingham Forest and Everton and PSR, they lost more than the permitted limit over a three-year period and have suffered Premier League points deductions as a result.\n\nUefa's latest changes will eventually force clubs to spend no more than 70% of their turnover on wages.\n\nUefa first introduced the concept of financial regulations in 2009 â the year after Sheikh Mansour bought Manchester City. The rules were implemented at the start of the 2011-12 season, which was the first season City played in the Champions League. Similar rules were adopted by the Premier League in 2013.\n\nThe Premier Leagueâs current PSR system looks set to be in place for one more season, with a probable introduction of a new âspending capâ edging closer.\n\nThat would limit clubs' outlay on transfers, wages and agents' fees, with a proposal to cap spending to between four and five times the amount the lowest-earning Premier League club receives in TV revenue.\n\nNone of these developments impact Cityâs ongoing case."
