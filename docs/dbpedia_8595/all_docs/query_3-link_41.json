        "text": "Alas, the 2017/18 Premier League season has ended and Manchester City were crowned the champions of England. But how extraordinary was their campaign, and what records did they break this season? To answer these questions, this report has been broken these new records into four categories: the English top tier; Premier League; club records; and individual records.\n\nEnglish Top Tier Records (1888 – Present):\n\nMost Points: Following the conclusion of the 2017/18 season, Manchester City earned 100 points. The previous record in the top flight was 98 points, set by Liverpool in the 1978/79 season. The Blues are also the first team in English football history to reach 100 points within the top tier.\n\nMost Wins: City won 32 out of 38 matches during the 2017/18 season, the most in a top flight campaign. The previous record was set by Tottenham Hotspurs during the 1960/61 season, where they won 31 games.\n\nPremier League Records (1992 – Present):\n\nMost Points: Manchester City earned 100 points in a single Premier League season, surpassing Chelsea’s record of 95 points in the 2004/05 season.\n\nBiggest Title-Winning Margin: Manchester City won the league by 19 points. The previous record was held by Manchester United, who won the league by 18 points in the 1999/2000 season.\n\nMost Wins: Manchester City won 32 games this season. Chelsea previously held the record, set during the 2016/17 season, where they won 30 matches.\n\nConsecutive Wins: Manchester City recorded 18-consecutive wins in a single campaign, spanning from 26 August to 27 December, 2017. Chelsea, who previously held the record, earned 13-consecutive wins during the 2016/17 season.\n\nMost Away Wins: Manchester City earned 16 victories on the road out of a potential 19. The previous record was set by Chelsea during the 2004/05 season, where they won 15 matches.\n\nMost Away Points: Manchester City earned 50 points on the road this season. Chelsea, who previously held the record, earned 48 points during the 2004/05 season.\n\nGoals Scored: Manchester City scored 106 goals this season.

Chelsea previously held the record, having earned a goal differential of +71 during the 2009/10 season.\n\nMinutes Behind: After combining the number of minutes in which Manchester City trailed their opposition, the Blues were only behind for a total of 153 minutes this season. This is the lowest account by a Premier League side in a single campaign, where the previous record was 170 minutes - set by Arsenal during the 1998/99 season.\n\nHighest Average Possession: Manchester City registered an average 71% of ball possession throughout the 2017/18 season.
