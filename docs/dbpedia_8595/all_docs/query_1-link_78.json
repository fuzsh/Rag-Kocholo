        "text": "Alan Pardew reckons he laid the foundations for Southampton's surge up the league ladder.\n\nPardew's Crystal Palace side travel to St Mary's on Saturday for an FA Cup fourth-round encounter against his high-flying former club.\n\nAnd after the Saints started the post-administration 2009-10 season in League One with just five first-team players, Pardew believes he deserves credit for their march through the leagues.\n\n\"I thought we were good in the transfer market at Southampton in the first year I was there,\" said the 53-year-old, who left the Newcastle job earlier this month to boss Palace.\n\n\"We brought in Rickie Lambert, Dean Hammond and Jose Fonte, and they went through all the divisions with them.\n\n\"Jason Puncheon as well - and we picked them up for peanuts, really. I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing a few players we had - in particular Punch, Lambert and Adam Lallana.\n\n\"I think they are three great guys and I've followed their careers since. I take a lot of pride in that they have done so brilliantly.\"\n\nPuncheon should start against his former club on Saturday, and Pardew reckons there is a lasting bond from their time together at Saints.\n\nHe added: \"We had a couple of situations that bond you as a manager and a player, so he knows the standards I expect - and boy is he delivering on that front at the moment.\""
