        "text": "Saturday 19th September 1908\n\nCrystal Palace 4-0 Brighton\n\nSouthern League Division One – Att: 10,000\n\nManager: Edmund Goodman\n\nCharles McGibbon bagged a hat-trick on his debut for Palace, becoming the first player to achieve this feat, albeit in the Club’s very short history at this point. McGibbon would score 13 goals in 17 games for this season before military duties took him to the south coast. He would sign for Southampton – he scored a hat-trick against the Saints in his short time at Palace as well.\n\nPost World War One Charles would play a first-class cricket match for Hampshire against Yorkshire (he bowled one over and went for 10 – see the scorecard here) but he wouldn’t play football professionally after 1911. His son, Douglas McGibbon, would play professional football for Southampton, Fulham and Bournemouth.\n\nJames Beauchop, who was the first Palace player ever to get sent off, scored the other goal in this game.\n\nPalace: Johnson, Walker, Innerd, Ryan, Brearley, Garratt, Beauchop, Woodger, E.Collins, Haywood, McGibbon\n\nSaturday 19th September 1987\n\nReading 2-3 Crystal Palace\n\nLeague Division Two – Att: 7,039\n\nManager: Steve Coppell\n\nA whirlwind seventeen minute period either side of half-time settled this match at Elm Park. Reading took the lead on 41 minutes through Les Taylor to spark off the flurry of goals.\n\nIan Wright levelled 2 minutes after the break before two goals in a minute, from Gavin Nebbelling (57 - below) and Mark Bright (58), had Palace looking comfortable. However, substitute Michael Gilks would pull the hosts back into the game from the penalty spot, but there would be no further goals in this one.\n\nSaturday 19th September 1992\n\nEverton 0-2 Crystal Palace\n\nPremier League – Att: 18,083\n\nManager: Steve Coppell\n\nTwo goals from Chris Armstrong (8, 17) saw Palace claim their first win in the newly-formed Premier League. I’ll let the video below do the talking for this one - props to Paul Rideout on one of the worst efforts on goal one could ever wish to see.\n\nSaturday 19th September 2009\n\nCrystal Palace 1-0 Derby County\n\nChampionship – Att: 12,760\n\nManager: Neil Warnock\n\nIt is only with hindsight that we can appreciate the importance of every win early on in the 2009/10 season. The start to this season had been a mixed one and this win in the 7th game of the season took Palace to a record of two wins, two draws, and three losses and would start a run of 10 points from a possible 12 that would take us up the table and towards the play-off places.\n\nDarren Ambrose, as he so often did this season, scored the winner 10 minutes into the second half, converting a Shaun Derry headed knockdown from six yards. Johnny Ertl would later hit the bar and County would have a late penalty appeal turned down.\n\n\"All the talking (Clough on the penalty call) is trying to cover the cracks. Look at their bench. They've got a better side there than we have been able to put out. Let's complain about that.” rambled Neil Warnock to the BBC after the game.\n\n\"I didn't see it like the ref. It couldn't have been a foul or else he would have given it.\n\n\"We gave absolutely everything, and I'm proud as punch of my boys, and I hope they get the headlines they deserve.\"\n\nNeil Warnock’s men would flirt with the playoffs until Administration and a 10 point deduction in late January. To go from promotion hopefuls to relegation fighting would be tough on any Club but Palace would pull through, just.\n\nPalace Links: Two future Palace players featured for Derby in this one – Dean Moxey and James Vaughan.\n\nFriday 19th September 2014\n\nThe final ten potential Palace TV Presenters are announced.\n\nTuesday 19th September 2017\n\nCrystal Palace 1-0 Huddersfield Town\n\nLeague Cup - Att: 6,607\n\nManager: Roy Hodgson\n\nRoy Hodgson picked up his first win as Crystal Palace during an emotional night at Selhurst Park. Pape Souare, just a year after suffering a life-threatening car crash, returned to first-team action.\n\nBakary Sako scored the only goal of the game that saw Palace advance to the 4th Round and exact some revenge for the opening day 0-3 loss to the Terriers.\n\nAll Results\n\nWhat happened yesterday?"
