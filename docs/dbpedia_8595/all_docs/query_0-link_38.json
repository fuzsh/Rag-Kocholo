        "text": "Crystal Palace vs Man City LIVE!\n\nKevin De Bruyne struck twice to inspire Manchester City to a dominant 4-2 win at Crystal Palace on Saturday and move the champions level on points with Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nStunned by conceding an early goal scored by Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, De Bruyne equalised with a superb shot before second-half goals by Rico Lewis, Erling Haaland and the Belgian midfielder adding his second.\n\nOdsonne Edouard grabbed a late consolation for the hosts but with seven games remaining City are level on 70 points with Liverpool and two ahead of Arsenal, although both their title rivals have a game in hand.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Man City highlights\n\nGOAL! Mateta shocks City in third minute\n\nGOAL! De Bruyne screamer levels up\n\nGOAL! Lewis completes comeback after break\n\nGOAL! De Bruyne to Haaland for 3-1\n\nGOAL! 100th City goal for De Bruyne\n\nGOAL! Edouard hits late consolation\n\nWatch Kevin De Bruyne score his 100th City goal\n\n14:35 , Marc Mayo\n\nTwo absolute pearls from the Belgian today!\n\nFull time!\n\n14:29 , Marc Mayo\n\nMan City go level on points with Liverpool atop the Premier League table!\n\nCrystal Palace 2-4 Man City | 90+7 mins\n\n14:28 , Marc Mayo\n\nJefferson Lerma and Erling Haaland with a bit of afters as we approach the final whistle.\n\nPaul Tierney calls them in for a chat.\n\nThen Joachim Andersen is the next to wind up the Norwegian...\n\nCrystal Palace 2-4 Man City | 90+2 mins\n\n14:23 , Marc Mayo\n\nTricky play from Palace, they are going down with a bit of fight and Naouirou Ahamada shoots low at the keeper.\n\nUp the other end, only a last-ditch Joachim Andersen tackle prevents Kevin De Bruyne from shooting for a hat-trick.\n\nIn fact, off comes the Belgian with Bernardo Silva on for a short cameo.\n\nCrystal Palace 2-4 Man City | 90 mins\n\n14:20 , Marc Mayo\n\nA bit of life in the home crowd now, particularly when Michael Olise gets on the ball.\n\nAnd it’s his delightful cross from the right which just evades Jeffrey Schlupp!\n\nSeven added minutes coming up.\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nThat’s more like it from Palace. Edouard flicks home nicely. Nothing City could do about that.\n\nGGGGOOOOAAALLLL!!! Crystal Palace 2-4 Man City | Edouard, 86'\n\n14:17 , Marc Mayo\n\nTHE EAGLES HIT BACK!\n\nJeffrey Schlupp crosses from the left and a neat flick from Odsonne Edouard reduces the deficit.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-4 Man City | 83 mins\n\n14:14 , Marc Mayo\n\nWill Hughes off for Naouirou Ahamada as Oliver Glasner makes his final change.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-4 Man City | 80 mins\n\n14:12 , Marc Mayo\n\nCHANCE!\n\nPoor giveaway by Manuel Akanji allows Odsonne Edouard to shoot but a superb recovery block allows the defence to clear.\n\nWatch Erling Haaland add his name to the scoresheet\n\n14:08 , Marc Mayo\n\nFPL players worldwide rejoice...\n\nCrystal Palace 1-4 Man City | 74 mins\n\n14:05 , Marc Mayo\n\nMateo Kovacic and Matheus Nunes on for Julian Alvarez and Rodri.\n\nPalace also make some changes, Michael Olise back from injury to replace Jordan Ayew with Odsonne Edouard and Nathaniel Clyne on for Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-4 Man City | 71 mins\n\n14:03 , Marc Mayo\n\n“Champions again, ole ole” chant the away fans as Pep Guardiola begins to turn to his bench to rest some legs.\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nStunning pass from Grealish through Munoz’s legs into De Bruyne. The Belgian puts it on a plate for Haaland, who has looked lacking in confidence in recent weeks and needed that goal. Palace’s race increasingly looking run.\n\nAnd that’s that. Wondrous strike from De Bruyne. A Manchester City fourth that kills the chance of a Palace comeback now. They’ve been far from their best here, but Pep Guardiola’s side now have a commanding lead.\n\nGGGGGGOOOOAAAALLLL!!! Crystal Palace 1-4 Man City | De Bruyne, 70'\n\n14:01 , Marc Mayo\n\nHAVE SOME OF THAT!\n\nA beautiful volley from Kevin De Bruyne makes it four!\n\nCrystal Palace 1-3 Man City | 68 mins\n\n13:59 , Marc Mayo\n\nVAR wants to have a look at Kevin De Bruyne’s run to ensure he’s on side. Indeed he is, and City look good value for another three points today.\n\nGGGOOOOAALLL!!! Crystal Palace 1-3 Man City | Haaland, 66'\n\n13:57 , Marc Mayo\n\nKEVIN DE BRUYNE TO ERLING HAALAND...\n\nYou know the rest!\n\nCrystal Palace 1-2 Man City | 65 mins\n\n13:56 , Marc Mayo\n\nEberechi Eze departs for Jeffrey Schlupp. Not been his game, in fairness. Schlupp goes left wing.\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nEberechi Eze has delivered a bit of a stinker today. Constantly being dispossessed and not playing in well-placed teammates quickly enough. Plays much better when Michael Olise is fit and on the field of play alongside him. Olise is back from a hamstring injury and could feature for a 15–20-minute cameo today.\n\nWatch Rico Lewis put Man City ahead\n\n13:55 , Marc Mayo\n\nHis second league goal, with the other also coming against the Eagles.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-2 Man City | 63 mins\n\n13:54 , Marc Mayo\n\nBooking for Jean-Philippe Mateta after he landed his studs on the top of Rodri’s foot.\n\nA painful one for the Spaniard, looks like he’ll play on though.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-2 Man City | 60 mins\n\n13:51 , Marc Mayo\n\nWide from Kevin De Bruyne as he takes aim far out.\n\nPalace have half an hour to regather some momentum.\n\nPerhaps we’ll see Michael Olise from the bench?\n\nCrystal Palace 1-2 Man City | 56 mins\n\n13:47 , Marc Mayo\n\nThe corner is spun back to Jack Grealish, who has to control it in a bit of a difficult spot and lashes over.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-2 Man City | 54 mins\n\n13:46 , Marc Mayo\n\nCHANCE!\n\nRico Lewis again strolls forward and Kevin De Bruyne’s cute header nearly sends Erling Haaland in.\n\nHe rounds the keeper and has to cut it back, before Julian Alvarez’s shot is blocked by a defender on the floor.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-2 Man City | 52 mins\n\n13:44 , Marc Mayo\n\nDaniel Munoz races down the right into space and yet his cross is of the aimless variety, and Palace have to settle for possession in their own half.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-2 Man City | 49 mins\n\n13:41 , Marc Mayo\n\nThat goal has City level on points with Liverpool, who play Manchester United tomorrow. Another three goals and they’ll go top on goals scored.\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nA horrible start to the second half for Crystal Palace, who concede just 104 seconds after the restart. Joachim Andersen’s defensive header should be better. Lewis picks up the pieces for City and scores.\n\nGGGOOOAAAALLL!!!! Crystal Palace 1-2 Man City | Lewis, 47'\n\n13:39 , Marc Mayo\n\nRICO LEWIS STRIKES FOR CITY!\n\nNot for the first time today, the young right-back wanders into the box and collects a cross from the left - which he buries in the corner of the goal!\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 46 mins\n\n13:37 , Marc Mayo\n\nManuel Akanji in at left-back, up against Jordan Ayew.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta looks offside as he runs in behind and eventually shoots wide, before the flag goes up.\n\nKick-off!\n\n13:36 , Marc Mayo\n\nIt is indeed Josko Gvardiol taken off by Pep Guardiola, who still has Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden among his bench options. The Croatian looks to be injury free as he heads to the dugout, hood up.\n\nAnd we’re back underway!\n\nManuel Akanji coming on\n\n13:35 , Marc Mayo\n\nLooks like Josko Gvardiol may be departing, we’ll find out in just a moment.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Man City | Half-time\n\n13:30 , Marc Mayo\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nWith a right-back and a defensive midfielder among their three centre-backs today, Palace can be proud of that first-half performance as they are applauded loudly back into the dressing room.\n\nDrawing 1-1, went ahead, and looking dangerous on the break. City must find something more to avoid a halting of their title-race momentum here.\n\nWatch Stefan Ortega's cheeky turn\n\n13:25 , Marc Mayo\n\nEderson, watching on from the bench, may well struggle to get his place back on this form!\n\nHalf-time!\n\n13:20 , Marc Mayo\n\nWork to do for Man City with plenty of applause for Crystal Palace as the players depart at the break.\n\nIt’s 1-1.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 45+2 mins\n\n13:19 , Marc Mayo\n\nCheers from the home fans asJosko Gvardiol is booked for a late one on Jordan Ayew.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 45 mins\n\n13:17 , Marc Mayo\n\nBig appeals from a penalty by the home fans as Eberechi Eze goes down under pressure from Josko Gvardiol in battling for a cross.\n\nReplays show the Palace man just stood still, waiting for the contact. No foul, VAR agrees.\n\nThree added minutes as the Eagles’ corner comes to nothing.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 43 mins\n\n13:15 , Marc Mayo\n\nThe mother of all Cruyff turns from Stefan Ortega beats Jean-Philippe Mateta after a shocker of a backpass from Rodri put the City goalkeeper in all kinds of trouble by his own goal.\n\nIt caps a scrappy move by Palace that neither team really got a grip of, Jordan Ayew and Will Hughes unable to produce enough of a touch to open a shooting chance.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 40 mins\n\n13:11 , Marc Mayo\n\nRico Lewis pops up on the 18-yard line and shoots early, hitting a shot straight at Dean Henderson.\n\nNice little move by the right-back, he travelled forward well under the radar.\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nA glorious, glorious chance for Palace to take the lead for the second time in this game. Ayew, Mateta and Eze had a three-on-one against Dias. Ayew opted to go alone and stung the crossbar. Might Palace rue that by the end of this game? Win, lose or draw, Ayew certainly will.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 38 mins\n\n13:09 , Marc Mayo\n\nOFF THE BAR!\n\nJordan Ayew takes advantage off a mistake by Rodri and decides to shoot, with options to his left, and his effort clips the top of the woodwork.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 37 mins\n\n13:08 , Marc Mayo\n\nInto the final ten minutes of the half, can City make a breakthrough to grab the lead?\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nFirst moment of quality for a good few minutes as Alvarez does a give-and-go with Stones and then fires just wide of the post. City, naturally, dominating proceedings here, but the Eagles have defended resolutely. So nearly undone there though.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 33 mins\n\n13:05 , Marc Mayo\n\nJefferson Lerma has thrown in some important tackles in the past few minutes yet looks hurt after sliding in in the box. Erling Haaland then wins a corner as Joachim Andersen’s plea for a foul goes ignored.\n\nCity work it short and Julian Alvarez lashes a shot wide from range.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 30 mins\n\n13:01 , Marc Mayo\n\nCity’s sixth corner of the first half hour is slapped clear by Joel Ward at the near post.\n\nThe visitors have had over three-quarters of possession but Palace’s setup makes it an intriguing contest, particularly the longer the score stays level.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 28 mins\n\n12:59 , Marc Mayo\n\nGood target man work by Jean-Philippe Mateta, who finds Eberechi Eze and gallops into space. The England international doesn’t trust his striker with a ball into space though, and quickly gets crowded out.\n\nYou sense Oliver Glasner would have much preferred that ball to go in behind quickly.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 25 mins\n\n12:56 , Marc Mayo\n\nHandball by Oscar Bobb in the Palace box shuts down a City attack after a neat crossfield ball. It’s another big game for the Norwegian to try and impress in, down the same flank as fellow youngster Rico Lewis too.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 22 mins\n\n12:54 , Marc Mayo\n\nA short pause as Jordan Ayew is down, along with Jack Grealish who was caught in a challenge by Daniel Munoz.\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nDe Bruyne has been fairly influential in the first 22 minutes of this match and has seen a lot of the ball. There’s a good structure about Palace’s defensive shape, though, and they deserve to be level.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 19 mins\n\n12:50 , Marc Mayo\n\nPalace are undoubtedly a threat on the break today, they’re getting forward with numbers and confidence.\n\nThe latest counter ends with Jordan Ayew swinging a shot over the bar from 20 yards.\n\nAnd Dean Henderson denies Erling Haaland up the other end after a fine ball by Kevin De Bruyne!\n\nBreathless start...\n\nWatch De Bruyne goal to level the score\n\n12:49 , Marc Mayo\n\nDean Henderson made two good saves moments before and had no chance with this.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Man City | 16 mins\n\n12:48 , Marc Mayo\n\nBig test now for Palace, who nearly threaten instantly only for a cross to escape Eberechi Eze at the far post.\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nDe Bruyne was rested in midweek when Foden did the business against Villa. He’s back in now, and that’s a show of his world-class quality. Drops his shoulder and curls into the top corner. Hint of a deflection. If so, it only helped the City man.\n\nGGGGGOOOOAAALLLL!!!! Crystal Palace 1-1 Man City | De Bruyne, 13'\n\n12:47 , Marc Mayo\n\nTHAT IS CLASS FROM KEVIN DE BRUYNE!\n\nA serious finish from the Belgian, who cuts onto his right foot at a narrow angle just inside the box and curls an unstoppable effort into the top corner.\n\nMan City are level and Pep Guardiola’s blowing him kisses from the dugout!\n\nCrystal Palace 1-0 Man City | 11 mins\n\n12:42 , Marc Mayo\n\nSAVE!\n\nDean Henderson again! Rodri’s volley is a little awkward but goalbound and the keeper tips it wide.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-0 Man City | 10 mins\n\n12:42 , Marc Mayo\n\nCHANCE!\n\nJulian Alvarez is slipped in and shoots from a tight angle, but Dean Henderson makes the save with hsi foot and it pops clear off Joel Ward.\n\nWatch Mateta score the opening goal\n\n12:40 , Marc Mayo\n\nCool, calm and collected.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-0 Man City | 7 mins\n\n12:39 , Marc Mayo\n\nSo, we’re back into a pattern of City possession but they lose it again and Adam Wharton’s pass isn’t good enough to send Eberechi Eze in the box.\n\nA give-and-go with Jordan Ayew then fails to come off.\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park:\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta said this week, in an interview with The Athletic, that he believes he can become one of the Premier League’s best strikers. Decent way to show so — scoring against the Treble winners after just three minutes. Palace into a surprising early lead.\n\nGGGOOOOAAALLLL!!!! Crystal Palace 1-0 Man City | Mateta, 3'\n\n12:37 , Marc Mayo\n\nJEAN-PHILIPPE MATETA BREAKS THROUGH TO SCORE!\n\nWell, well, well. Man City are caught in possession in the Palace half and the hosts break with devastating effect.\n\nMateta shrugs off a challenge, bears down on goal and scores via the inside of the far-post.\n\nPandemonium in south London (and north London... and Merseyside)!\n\nCrystal Palace 0-0 Man City | 2 mins\n\n12:34 , Marc Mayo\n\nRico Lewis is marauding forward with John Stones staying back in the usual City switch to a three-man backline when on the ball.\n\nPalace are in a five-man backline in defence and have a corner to deal with early on.\n\nIn front of the away fans, Kevin De Bruyne sends it in and Joachim Andersen clears as Erling Haaland lingers.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Man City | Kick-off!\n\n12:32 , Marc Mayo\n\nWe’re underway!\n\nHere come the players!\n\n12:31 , Marc Mayo\n\nOur referee, Paul Tierney, leads out the two teams into a packed Selhurst Park.\n\nCrystal Palace in their traditional home kit, City in their away strip of white and crimson.\n\nPep Guardiola is settled in\n\n12:23 , Marc Mayo\n\nThe Man City boss has been sat in his seat in the dugout - looking around, scrolling on his phone - for the best part of 40 minutes waiting for kick-off.\n\nLuckily for him, and us, the wait is nearly over!\n\nCrystal Palace vs Man City: Countdown to kick-off\n\n12:19 , Marc Mayo\n\nFootball reporter Dom Smith at Selhurst Park\n\nMarc Guehi has just been signed autographs for Palace fans near the tunnel. He remains a big miss for the Eagles. Oliver Glasner, and indeed Gareth Southgate, will be hoping to see him back to full fitness soon.\n\nKick-off in ten minutes!\n\nMarc Guehi provides injury update\n\n12:15 , Marc Mayo\n\nCrystal Palace captain Marc Guehi has just popped up on TNT Sports to discuss his injury absence\n\nHe said: \"It's going well, I'm lucky I've got good people around me.

A lot of work on details and that'll help especially in a big game like this.\n\n\"[England] is in the back of my mind but I'm really focused on the injury, making sure my knee is good. It's important to have perspective and think long-term as well as short-term.\n\n\"It's been unfortunate at times, we have ourselves to blame in the last few games we haven't won. But we've played well, we're just missing that cutting edge.\"\n\nPep Guardiola explains Phil Foden decision\n\n12:11 , Marc Mayo\n\nIn midweek, Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne were given a chance to rest their legs as Man City beat Aston Villa.\n\nToday, it’s Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva and Manuel Akanji.\n\n“It was difficult, but not just [Foden],” Pep Guardiola has just told TNT Sports.\n\n“All the guys, when you don't allow a player to play it's tough but we have a lot of games. Phil played against Arsenal, then friendly games with England... it's a lot of games.\n\n“I thought a lot about letting [De Bruyne and Foden both] play but after we arrived I felt [today] then Madrid, we need sometimes fresh [legs].\n\n“I'd love to have Phil on the pitch - I'm not stupid - but that's why I decided.”\n\nOliver Glasner on his toughest challenge\n\n12:06 , Marc Mayo\n\nThe Crystal Palace boss has given his take on his early weeks in the Eagles job ahead of kick-off.\n\nSpeaking to TNT Sports, Oliver Glasner has insisted he will need a full pre-season to implement his hard-running, high-pressing style.\n\nSo far, he’s only managed to win one of his five games in charge.\n\n\"How we want to play means a lot of intensity - and we're 19th in runs, 19th in sprints,” he said.\n\n“You can't make it work [so quickly].\n\n“We arrived mid-season and three days before the Burnley game. It's important the players are fresh and avoid injuries, increasing our intensity is the biggest challenge we have.”\n\nCrystal Palace vs Man City: Countdown to kick-off\n\n12:00 , Marc Mayo\n\nIt’s high noon in south London so that means we’re only half an hour away from kick-off!\n\nThe warm-ups are underway and here’s our reporter Dom Smith to preview the action from the press box.\n\nHead-to-head record\n\n11:55 , Marc Mayo\n\nPalace have only beaten City once in their past 10 meetings, but they recorded an impressive draw earlier in the season, courtesy of the returning Olise’s 95th-minute penalty.\n\nMan City wins: 37\n\nCrystal Palace wins: 17\n\nDraws: 16\n\nCrystal Palace unchanged\n\n11:48 , Marc Mayo\n\nOliver Glasner sticks by the team which lost to Bournemouth in midweek.\n\nHowever, Michael Olise is back in the squad after injury and should feature later on as a substitute.\n\nErling Haaland starts for Man City\n\n11:41 , Marc Mayo\n\nFour changes for the visitors as Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland retake their spots in the XI.\n\nPhil Foden and Bernardo Silva drop out along with Mateo Kovacic and Manuel Akanji.\n\nIn their place come Oscar Bobb and John Stones, while Ederson is fit for the bench.\n\nSpanish midfielder Mahamadou Susoho, 19, is once again among the substitutes.\n\nCrystal Palace team news\n\n11:33 , Marc Mayo\n\nCrystal Palace XI: Henderson; Ward, Andersen, Lerma; Munoz, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Eze, Mateta, Ayew\n\nSubs: Matthews, Tomkins, Clyne, Schlupp, Ahamada, Ozoh, Umeh, Olise, Edouard\n\nMan City team news is in!\n\n11:30 , Marc Mayo\n\nMan City XI: Ortega; Lewis, Stones, Dias, Gvardiol; Rodri, De Bruyne; Bobb, Alvarez, Grealish; Haaland\n\nSubs: Ederson, Kovacic, Doku, Bernardo, Gomez, Akanji, Nunes, Foden, Susoho\n\nMan City touch down\n\n11:22 , Marc Mayo\n\nEderson, Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne all off the team bus.\n\nTeam news coming up next!\n\nMatch odds\n\n11:13 , Marc Mayo\n\nCrystal Palace to win: 17/2\n\nMan City to win: 2/9\n\nDraw: 7/2\n\nHosts are in the house\n\n11:07 , Marc Mayo\n\nCrystal Palace’s squad have touched down at Selhurst Park.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Man City: Countdown to kick-off\n\n10:59 , Marc Mayo\n\nWe are just 90 minutes away from the 90 minutes beginning in south London!\n\nTeam news expected in the coming half-hour.\n\nWeekend build-up: Liverpool manager search intensifies\n\n10:53 , Marc Mayo\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Jurgen Klopp leading Liverpool’s charge to the title in his final season with the club, they are also looking for his replacement.\n\nXabi Alonso isn’t a go-er and there appear to be doubts over Roberto De Zerbi, who’s been linked with Bayern Munich.\n\nRuben Amorim of Sporting CP appears to be the top candidate and he’s once again opened the door to a summer switch - although Barcelona also like the look of him.\n\nRead the full story!\n\nWeekend build-up: Michail Antonio milestone for West Ham\n\n10:47 , Marc Mayo\n\nMichail Antonio will make his 300th West Ham appearance in today’s trip to Wolves.\n\n\"He's shown loyalty to West Ham over a long time,” David Moyes said. “He's aging like we all are but he's doing the job well.\n\n“Every time I've sat in this seat, most people have asked, 'When are you buying a striker?'
