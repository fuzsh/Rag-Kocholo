Inter vs Atletico could be a case of who blinks first with the start of those games being about not wanting to lose rather than going on the front foot and trying to win it from day one.\n\n“I always like to watch Bayern play because they always try and win games, Real Madrid are the same.\n\n“Maybe this is an enormous compliment to the Premier League but I look at Spanish football and Italian football and German football – then there’s PSG who are not the same team – and I’ve got question marks about the leagues.\n\n“They’re nowhere near as good as our league. There’s not the same intensity and I’m not sure if they’ve got that desire that our players show.\n\n“I think that with Arsenal and Man City, we’ve got the best teams. Looking at them, I think that our league is so good now that most of our teams are the outstanding favourites. Maybe first and second or first and third.”\n\nAsked if Man City will have enough to beat Copenhagen, Jordan said: “You’d think so. That’s a decent draw for them and ultimately in the Champions League, they’ve got to turn up and perform.\n\n“The tie, for me, is Leipzig vs Real Madrid as both of those sides score goals and so if you’re watching games and you want to see goals then you’re going to see goals between Leipzig and Real Madrid.”"
