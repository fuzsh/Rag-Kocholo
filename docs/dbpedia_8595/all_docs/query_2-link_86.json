        "text": "The Cityzens have been charged for many financial rule violations\n\nManchester City have been charged by the Premier League for many financial rule violations.\n\nThe Premier League has accused the team of breaking multiple financial fair play regulations. The club has also said that it is astonished by the reported accusations and that it would welcome an investigation.\n\nThe charges cover the seasons 2009–10 and 2017–18.\n\n2009-10 season\n\nManchester City finished 5th in the Premier League 2009-10 season.\n\n2010-11 season\n\nThe Cityzens finished 3rd in during the 2010-11 season.\n\n2011-12 season\n\n1.Manchester City - 89 points 2. Manchester United - 89 points\n\nManchester City won the league on goal difference, and if the Premier League tries to remove their league titles, Manchester United could be crowned the champions.\n\n2012-13 season\n\nManchester United won the league, and City came in second.\n\n2014-15\n\nChelsea winning the league title won't affect City’s title collection.\n\nIn 2015-16\n\nLeicester City won the title, while City finished fourth.\n\nIn 2016-17\n\nCity finished third.\n\n2017-18\n\n1.Manchester City - 100 points 2. Manchester United - 81 points\n\nCity won the title, and if the sanction takes place, United could be handed the league title.\n\nFirstly, in a statement, the Premier League said: \"In accordance with Premier League rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has today [February 6, 2023] referred a number of alleged breaches of the Premier League rules by Manchester City Football Club to a commission under Premier League rule W.3.4.\"\n\nThe club have broken a number of rules and may face fines from the league.\n\nSecondly, the team violated league rules by failing to provide \"correct financial information that conveys a truthful and fair perspective of the club's financial status\" in the \"utmost good faith.\"\n\nAlso, the second batch of violations, which pertain to the years 2009–10 through 2012–13 inclusive, \"require a member club to include full information on manager remuneration in its applicable contracts with its management.\"\n\nThe second violation likewise pertains to the club's failure to include complete information about player compensation in the applicable contracts for the seasons 2010–11 to 2015–16, inclusive.\n\nAlthough this is the second time the team has broken the Financial Fair Play guideline, which the City previously broke in 2020 and resulted in a two-year punishment. However, European football's Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overruled it.\n\nWhat sanctions might an independent commission inflict on the club?\n\nSuspend a club from playing league matches.\n\nPoints deductions\n\nrecommend to the board that league matches be replayed.\n\nrecommend to the board that the league expel the respondent club.\n\nOrder compensation\n\nCancel or refuse registration of players\n\nConditional punishment\n\nOrder the club to pay the costs\n\nMake such other order as it thinks fit\n\nAlso, the club may lose its status, be relegated to the Championship, or have its league titles revoked if the commission decides to impose these punishments.\n\nIs it the same as what Juventus did?\n\nIt differs from Juventus, who were accused of giving players cash after the COVID-19 outbreak affected the club's finances.\n\nAlso, this resulted in the whole Juventus board leaving the business after a study was conducted by the Italian government agency CONSOB, which resulted in the loss of 15 points for the team and league titles. Finally, CONSOB is in charge of overseeing the Italian stock market.\n\nIn this instance, Manchester City have violated the FFP regulations once more, and as a result, they risk being demoted to the Championship and even losing their league title.\n\nHowever, it's still unclear how things will turn out at this point."
