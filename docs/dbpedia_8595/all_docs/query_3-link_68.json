        "text": "Manchester City look vulnerable, so much so the word “crisis” has been flirted with after defeat to Aston Villa followed three draws and leaves them trailing in the Premier League title race.\n\nWhat clubs lower down the rung would give to call this a crisis, a team backed by a state with the world’s best coach, just six points off the top.\n\nAnd after all, is this not exactly where they want to be? The ruthless hunters who overtook Arsenal when it mattered? They’ll just do it again, right? Right?\n\nWell right now, allow us to borrow and perhaps butcher Oxford’s Word of the Year by claiming Manchester City have lost their “rizz”, the swagger that propelled them to the Treble, the style that has served them so well under Pep Guardiola.\n\nCity’s total of 30 points after 15 games is their joint-second lowest total across Guardiola’s eight seasons in charge, while the 17 league goals they have conceded makes for their worst defensive start since 2009-10.\n\nTheir defensive frailties may well be the greater concern for Guardiola. They may have conceded just three more goals than Arsenal and Liverpool, but in a race of fine margins, apply one goal to each of the leads they let slip against Chelsea, Liverpool, and Tottenham – and you have six points dropped right there.\n\nMan City after 15 games under Pep Guardiola\n\nSeason: Points total after 15 games (where they were in the table) – where they ended up\n\n2017-18: 43 (1st) – Champions\n\n2018-19: 41 (1st) – Champions\n\n2022-23: 35 (2nd) – Champions\n\n2021-22: 35 (1st) – Champions\n\n2019-20: 32 (3rd) – 2nd\n\n2016-17: 30 (4th) – 3rd\n\n2023-24: 30 (4th) – ?\n\n2020-21: 29 (5th) – Champions\n\nThe seven goals conceded in the matches against Chelsea and Tottenham skews this data slightly but also indicates City are getting swept up in the chaos as opposed to getting a handle on it. If you’d have put a £1 double on those 4-4 and 3-3 scorelines, you’d have got £7,701 back, and in a wild campaign where we’ve already had a goal-of-the-decade contender, a record points deduction, and weekly VAR uproar, we are also witnessing more goals than ever.\n\nAveraging 3.15 goals per match, this Premier League season is up on last year’s record of 2.85, but for their part City are not outscoring their 2022-23 selves, averaging 2.4 goals per match this season (36 goals in total) compared to 2.5 last season (94).\n\nOther attacking stats are strikingly similar, too, namely the 15.5 shots (15.8 last season) and 2.6 big chances (2.7 last season) created per match – but defensively they are worse off.\n\nBeyond conceding at a greater rate (1.1 goals per match vs last season’s 0.9), Ederson is busier in goal, facing more shots and making more saves – exactly two per match, an increase from 1.6 last season.\n\nAgain, fine margins that can make the difference, and with Ruben Dias suffering a drop-off in form – from his dizzying standards – Guardiola will know the importance of refortifying a defence that was the joint-best in class last season.\n\n‘Don’t worry, they’ll come good’\n\nThis is all likely temporary. That is the hunch, anyway, based on what we’ve seen from Guardiola’s City before. In the immediate term, they go from playing top-half opposition to facing four of the bottom seven sides before the New Year. Once they’ve played Luton, Crystal Palace, Everton and Sheffield United, it could be a different story.\n\nWe have also come to expect City will turn it on in the second half of the campaign. After Arsenal topped the table for 93 per cent of last season, along came City with an 11-game winning run from February to May that made them champions by the time they made it 12 straight against Chelsea on 21 May.\n\nCity picked up 47 points in their final 19 games, compared to 42 in their opening 19, a trend also seen in 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, while in 2016-17 and 2021-22 there was a greater parity. The only significant dip was in 2017-18, when they picked up a record 100 points – 55 in the first 19, thus coasting to a further 45.\n\nMan City – strong finishers?\n\nSeason – points in first 19 matches – points in last 19 matches\n\n2022-23: 42 47\n\n2021-22: 47 46\n\n2020-21: 41 45\n\n2019-20: 38 43\n\n2018-19: 44 54\n\n2017-18: 55 45\n\n2016-17: 39 39\n\nIt is why they remain favourites with the bookmakers, why the supercomputer at Opta gives them the greatest chance of winning – 45 per cent, compared to 26 for both Arsenal and Liverpool (Aston Villa are at two per cent, for those wondering).\n\nAnd it is because of who will return. While Liverpool face losing Mohamed Salah for four rounds of action when the Africa Cup of Nations takes place in January and February, by this point City should have welcomed back Kevin De Bruyne, who has not kicked a ball since 11 August.\n\nDe Bruyne is hopeful of returning around the New Year. He has been named in their Club World Cup squad, while the 13 January match against Newcastle is perhaps a realistic target – which is notably their 20th league match of the season. The comeback could start right there.\n\nHis input will quite simply elevate City, and could make the fact they are conceding more goals immaterial. The Belgian has been their top creator every season since David Silva in 2018-19, and while Bernardo Silva has admirably stepped up in his absence – nine big chances created already beats his total of six all last season – they will only improve once De Bruyne is back.\n\nFor Erling Haaland alone, De Bruyne provided 13 assists last season, and the fact this relationship is yet to be rekindled should only serve as a positive for City’s second-half pursuit.\n\nThat is providing De Bruyne gets fit and stays fit. His hamstring was deteriorating in the latter stages of their Treble-winning campaign, he painfully walked off in another Champions League final, and at 32 such problems may not be so easily overcome.\n\nSo, all on De Bruyne? Maybe not, for just how City cope without two players they sold in the summer remains a factor that could come back to bite them.\n\nThe best teams in the world rarely struggle to hold onto their stars, and often – as was the case with Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United – it is the club who make the tougher calls, but in the summer City lost two players they had wanted to keep: Ilkay Gundogan, and arguably a player whose departure has been underplayed, Riyad Mahrez.\n\nIn the words of Kyle Walker, City had their own prime Zinedine Zidane in Gundogan, who turned clutch at the latter stages of 2022-23 with some crucial goals – in particular his double against Manchester United in the FA Cup final.\n\nGundogan, 33, wanted a fresh experience and chose to move to Barcelona, and unless summer signing Mateo Kovacic replicates the German’s end-of-season heroics, then City are worse off in midfield than they were last year.\n\nMahrez, meanwhile, contributed towards 28 goals last season, scoring 15 times and second only behind De Bruyne for assists with 13.\n\nDespite this, the Algerian lost his starting place, and his move to Al-Ahli came amid frustrations he played no part in the Champions League final, and just 11 minutes in the semi-finals, saying as much to L’Equipe in November when revealing Guardiola and technical director Txiki Begiristain “really” wanted him to stay.\n\nJeremy Doku has lit up the Etihad in his place, but with just three goals in all competitions so far, the rate at which Mahrez scored could be a factor sorely missed.\n\nAnd all this without mentioning Rodri, who was absent for the loss against Villa, with City unbeaten in 43 straight games when he starts. Avoid injury, and further suspension, and the Spaniard could prove key – but with Liverpool having reinvigorated their midfield, and Arsenal signing a player in Declan Rice that Jamie Carragher says is now the league’s most influential player, then after all this, stats only tell us so much.\n\nThe belief that City will fight back is based on previous. Perhaps things have changed."
