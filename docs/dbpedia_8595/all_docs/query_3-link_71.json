        "text": "Manchester City will be hoping to keep up with Liverpool in the Premier League title race when they take on Chelsea this afternoon.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side have won all of their last six games and are finding their familiar form when it comes to the battle at the top.\n\nCity are known to step up when things get tough and they’re chasing down their rivals as they sit two points behind the Reds with a game in hand.\n\nMauricio Pochettino will be out to stop their winning streak though, as his Blues look to rise up the table and put an end to their torrid campaign.\n\nManchester City vs Chelsea: Cold Palmer\n\nA key man that could possibly help Chelsea scupper City’s plans is their old academy product.\n\nCole Palmer is hitting new heights at the Blues and he is starring in the Premier League.\n\nThe 21-year-old has become a leader in London already, scoring 10 goals this season as well as providing six assists.\n\nFor City, he didn’t manage to score a single league goal as he only played a bit-part role under Guardiola.\n\nAnd now Palmer returns to the Etihad for the first time aiming to show what his former side are missing out on.\n\nShould he help Chelsea to a crucial three points in Manchester, he will massively hamper City’s top-flight title chances.\n\nChelsea have kept just one clean sheet in their last 19 Premier League meetings with Manchester City, with that coming via a 2-0 home win in December 2018 under Maurizio Sarri.\n\nManchester City have won six of their last eight Premier League home games against Chelsea (L2), keeping a clean sheet in five of those victories.\n\nManchester City vs Chelsea: Team news\n\nCity were dealt an injury blow in midweek as Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva were substituted with knocks.\n\nThe pair are likely to miss out and so is Josko Gvardiol who is set to be sidelined until next month.\n\nMateo Kovacic is expected to be back fit to feature if needed against his former club.\n\nAs for Chelsea, they are dealing with an injury crisis once again.\n\nThiago Silva has picked up a knock and won't feature while Benoit Badiashile will be absent for a few weeks.\n\nBoth of those players join Reece James, Lesley Ugochukwu, Marc Cucrella, Robert Sanchez, Romeo Lavia, Wesley Fofana on the sidelines.\n\nPalmer will lead the line against his former employers at the Etihad with Malo Gusto and Levi Colwill fit.\n\nThe 4-4 draw between Man City and Chelsea in the reverse fixture ended a run of 16 Premier League games without a draw between the sides. The last time both meetings ended level in a season was in 2014-15.\n\nManchester City and Chelsea played out a 4-4 draw in the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge – the most goals scored between these sides in a single Premier League campaign is nine in 2009-10, with the Citizens winning 2-1 (h) and 4-2 (a) that season.\n\nManchester City vs Chelsea: What has been said?\n\nChelsea boss Pochettino has been speaking about his relationship with Guardiola ahead of their meeting this weekend.\n\nHe said at his press conference: \"I like him? Yes, of course. I like him of course.\n\n\"I was so angry with the referee [so he didn't shake hands with him in November]. It's not going to happen tomorrow. I went like an arrow to the referee.\"\n\nOn his record vs Pep, he continued: \"It's not important for me.\n\n\"Of course, Pep is an unbelievable coach, one of the greatest coaches ever in football.\n\n\"Not only me, but the record is not so good against him; there are so many coaches that suffer.\"\n\nManchester City haven’t lost any of their last 22 home Premier League matches (W18 D4), with only Liverpool on a longer unbeaten run at home (24). City are also on the longest scoring run on home soil in the competition, scoring in their last 44 games at the Etihad and netting 135 goals in these games.\n\nManchester City have won their last six Premier League matches, having only won one of their previous six games (D4 L1). Four of those wins have come in 2024 – the only time they’ve won their first five Premier League games in a calendar year was in 2021 (won first 13 games).\n\nManchester City vs Chelsea: How to follow\n\nThis Premier League clash will take place on Saturday, February 17.\n\nKick-off at the Etihad Stadium is scheduled for 5:30pm.\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League.\n\ntalkSPORT and talkSPORT.com will also keep you up-to-date with all the action.\n\nManchester City vs Chelsea: Betting with talkSPORT BET\n\nMatch odds:\n\nMan City - 3/10\n\nDraw - 17/4\n\nChelsea - 15/2\n\nBoost: De Bruyne to score and to assist - was 7/2 NOW 9/2\n\n*odds correct as of 16/02/23\n\nSee more Premier League odds here\n\nNew Customer?
