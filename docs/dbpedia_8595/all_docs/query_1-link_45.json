        "text": "Condition: 9/10 Superb\n\nSize: Adult Medium\n\nChest Measurement: 38-40 Inches / 97-101 CM\n\nManufacturer: Nike\n\nColour: Red & blue stripes, white trim\n\nMaterial: Polyester\n\nSeasons: 2009/2010\n\nPlayer: N/A\n\nPatches: N/A\n\nOfficial Nike Crystal Palace home football shirt from the 2009/10 season.\n\nCondition of this vintage football jersey is 9/10 - Superb (see photos).\n\nSteve Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 First Division campaign, which put the club at the top of the table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw the team slip towards the relegation zone. Iain Dowie was appointed manager and guided the club to the play-off final, securing promotion with a 1–0 victory over West Ham. Again Palace could not maintain their place in the top tier and were relegated on the last day of the season after drawing at local rivals Charlton Athletic.\n\nFollowing that relegation, Simon Jordan was unable to put the club on a sound financial footing in the next few years, and in January 2010 the club was once again placed in administration, this time by a creditor. The Football League's regulations saw the Eagles deducted ten points, and the administrators were forced to sell key players including Victor Moses and José Fonte. Neil Warnock had also departed as manager in the early part of 2010.\n\nHe had taken over as manager in 2007, replacing Peter Taylor who had a brief spell as manager. Paul Hart took over as caretaker manager for the final weeks of the season. Survival in the Championship was only secured on the final day of the season after a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, which was itself relegated as a result."
