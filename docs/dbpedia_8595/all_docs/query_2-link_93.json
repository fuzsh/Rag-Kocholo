        "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo endured a difficult and goalless night as Portugal suffered a shock defeat by Georgia at Euro 2024.\n\nIt means that the footballing superstar has \"now failed to score in the group stage of a major international tournament for the first time in his career\", said the Daily Mirror. Before Euro 2024 he had scored at least one goal in all 10 major tournament group stages he'd played at.\n\nRonaldo, who plays his club football for Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr, is considered one of the greatest male footballers of all time – but at 39 years old, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner is \"in the twilight of his career\", said The Sun. Despite the setback against Georgia, Portugal won their first two group games so qualified for the knockout stages, where they will face Slovenia on Monday in the last 16. Ronaldo is the top scorer in the competition's history and might set a record for the oldest goalscorer at a European Championship.\n\nLionel Messi, the most decorated footballer of all time, is also back in the spotlight. The captain led defending champions Argentina to a 1-0 win against Chile in the Copa América, heading to the knock-out stages – and celebrated his 37th birthday this week. This year's Ballon d'Or (given to the player judged the best in the world) will be hotly contested, but Messi hopes to retain the award after jointly winning it last year with Colombia's Luis Díaz. Last year Messi, who captains the MLS side Inter Miami, celebrated a record-breaking eighth Ballon d'Or win. Ronaldo was not on the shortlist – for the first time since 2003.\n\nBut with countless trophies and a host of personal records, Messi and Ronaldo have a very special rivalry. We take a look at their profiles and all-time career statistics.\n\nPlayer profile: Lionel Messi\n\nLionel Messi spent the first 21 years of his career with FC Barcelona – where he won Spain’s La Liga title ten times and the Uefa Champions League four times – before joining Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. After two seasons in France, he signed for MLS team Inter Miami.\n\nThe Argentine “hasn’t had any problem adjusting to life” in Miami, said Fox Sports. As well as being among the goals he also helped the club win the 2023 MLS Leagues Cup after they beat Nashville SC on penalties in the final.\n\nAfter leading Argentina to World Cup glory in Qatar in 2022 Messi was named the men’s player of the year at the 2022 Best Fifa Awards. The forward has won the Fifa award three times and is also a record eight-time Ballon d’Or winner following his triumph in 2023.\n\nAt Qatar 2022 Messi scored seven goals, including two in the final against France. He played his 1,000th career match as Argentina beat Australia in the round of 16.\n\nArgentina also won the 2021 Copa América with Messi the top goalscorer in the competition. After winning a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Copa América triumph in 2021 was his first in senior international football. South American champions Argentina won the 2022 \"Finalissima\", 3-0 against European champions Italy, with captain Messi named man-of-the-match at Wembley Stadium.\n\nMessi is the only player in history to win the World Cup Golden Ball twice (2014 and 2022).\n\nFull name: Lionel Andrés Messi\n\nNationality: Argentine\n\nAge: 37\n\nBorn: 24 June 1987\n\nClubs: Inter Miami (2023-present); Paris Saint-Germain (2021-2023); Barcelona (2004-2021)\n\nBallon d’Or wins: 8 (2023, 2021, 2019, 2015, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009)\n\nThe Best Fifa Men’s Player: 3 (2023, 2022, 2019)\n\nChampions League winners’ medals – 4: 2014-15, 2010-11, 2008-09, 2005-06 (all with Barcelona)\n\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year award: 2 (2023; 2019 joint winner with Lewis Hamilton)\n\nCaptained Argentina in their 2021 Copa America win\n\nCaptained Argentina in their 2022 Fifa World Cup win\n\n108 goals in 184 games for Argentina (both national records)\n\nPlayer profile: Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nPortugal star Cristiano Ronaldo has played his club football with Sporting Lisbon (2002-2003), Manchester United (2003-2009 and 2021-2022), Real Madrid (2009-2018), Juventus (2018-2021) and Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia (2023-present).\n\nThe 39-year-old’s trophy collection includes five Champions League winners’ medals, plus league titles in England, Spain and Italy. At Qatar 2022 he became the first male player to score in five different Fifa World Cups. Ronaldo was also the first player to score at five European Championships.\n\nFive-time Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo, who has scored more than 890 goals for club and country, is the top goalscorer in men’s international football with 130 goals for Portugal and holds the record for most international appearances (209). He won the European Championship with Portugal in 2016 and is also the all-time top goalscorer for Real Madrid (451) and in the Champions League (141).\n\nOn 12 August 2023 Ronaldo won his first trophy in Saudi Arabia, scoring twice in Al-Nassr’s 2-1 victory over Al-Hilal in the Arab Club Champions Cup final.\n\nFull name: Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro\n\nNationality: Portuguese\n\nAge: 39\n\nBorn: 5 February 1985\n\nClubs: Al-Nassr (2023-present); Manchester United (2021-22 and 2003-09); Juventus (2018-21); Real Madrid (2009-18); Sporting Lisbon (2002-03)\n\nBallon d’Or wins: 5 wins (2017, 2016, 2014, 2013, 2008)\n\nThe Best Fifa Men's Player: 2 (2017 and 2016)\n\nChampions League winners’ medals – 5: 2017-18, 2016-17, 2015-16, 2013-14 with Real Madrid; 2007–08 with Man Utd\n\nCaptained Portugal in their Euro 2016 win\n\nAll-time top goalscorer in men’s international football (130 goals)\n\nAll-time record men’s international appearances (209)\n\nTop goalscorer in the Uefa Champions League (141 goals)\n\nFirst male player to score in five different Fifa World Cups\n\nAll-time goals, career statistics and red cards\n\nAll-time goals, career statistics and red cards\n\nAccording to messivsronaldo.app\n\nRonaldo: 895 goals and 252 assists in 1,228 appearances\n\nMessi: 821 goals and 374 assists in 1,066 appearances\n\nHat-tricks: Ronaldo 66; Messi 57\n\nCareer goal ratio: Ronaldo 0.73; Messi 0.79\n\nPenalties: Ronaldo 164; Messi 109\n\nAll-time club careers (excluding friendlies)\n\nRonaldo: 765 goals and 216 assists in 1,019 appearances\n\nMessi: 729 goals and 319 assists in 882 appearances\n\nHat tricks: Ronaldo 57; Messi 48\n\nClub goal ratio: Ronaldo 0.75; Messi 0.83\n\nPenalties: Ronaldo 144; Messi 85\n\nInternational careers (friendly and competitive matches)\n\nArgentina star Messi has scored 108 goals in 184 international appearances – both all-time records for his nation.

He saw red just 43 seconds into his Argentina debut after coming on as a sub against Hungary in 2005. He was also sent off against Chile in the 2019 Copa América.\n\nMessi’s third career red card – and first at club level – came on 17 January 2021. In Barcelona’s 3-2 Spanish Super Cup final loss against Athletic Bilbao, Messi walked after VAR spotted him lashing out against Asier Villalibre.\n\nRonaldo has been sent off 12 times in his career – once for Al-Nassr, once for Juventus, six times for Real Madrid and four times for Manchester United. \"Notably,\" said Goal.com, \"the Portuguese has shown himself to be somewhat prone to losing his cool in derby matches.\"\n\nArgentina star Messi has scored 106 goals in 178 international appearances – both all-time records for his nation. With 127 goals in 203 games for Portugal, Ronaldo holds both the all-time men’s records for international appearances and goals.\n\nInternational careers (friendly and competitive matches)\n\nRonaldo for Portugal: 127 goals and 34 assists in 203 appearances\n\nMessi for Argentina: 106 goals and 53 assists in 178 appearances\n\nHat-tricks: Ronaldo 10; Messi 9\n\nInternational goal ratio: Ronaldo 0.63; Messi 0.60\n\nPenalties: Ronaldo 20; Messi 24\n\nRonaldo's Uefa European Championship finals record\n\nTournaments: 2024, 2020, 2016, 2012, 2008, 2004\n\nAll-time finals record: 14 goals in 24 matches\n\nEuro 2004: two goals\n\nEuro 2008: one goal\n\nEuro 2012: three goals\n\nEuro 2016: three goals (Portugal won the tournament)\n\nEuro 2020: five goals (top scorer)\n\nEuro 2024: none so far\n\nMessi's Copa América finals record\n\nTournaments: 2024, 2021, 2019, 2016, 2015, 2011, 2007\n\nAll-time finals record: 13 goals in 36 matches\n\n2007 Copa América: two goals\n\n2011 Copa América: zero goals\n\n2015 Copa América: one goal\n\n2016 Copa América Centenario: five goals\n\n2019 Copa América: one goal\n\n2021 Copa América: four goals (Argentina won the tournament)\n\n2024 Copa América: none so far\n\nTrophies and awards\n\nMessi club honours\n\nClubs: Inter Miami (2023-present); Paris Saint-Germain (2021-2023); Barcelona (2004-2021)\n\nSpanish La Liga titles: 10\n\nSpanish Copa del Rey: 7\n\nSpanish Supercup: 8\n\nUefa Champions League: 4\n\nUefa Super Cup: 3\n\nFifa Club World Cup: 3\n\nFrench Ligue 1 titles: 2\n\nMLS Leagues Cup: 1\n\nMessi international honours with Argentina\n\nFifa World Cup: 1 (2022)\n\nFinalissima: 1 (2022)\n\n2021 Copa América winner and Golden Boot winner\n\nFifa Under-20 World Cup: 1 (2005)\n\nOlympic Gold Medal: 1 (2008)\n\nRecord number of appearances for Argentina: 184\n\nArgentina all-time top goalscorer: 108 goals\n\nRecord number of World Cup appearances: 26\n\nRonaldo club honours\n\nClubs: Al-Nassr (2023-present); Manchester United (2021-2022 and 2003-2009); Juventus (2018-2021); Real Madrid (2009-2018); Sporting Lisbon (2002-2003)\n\nEnglish Premier League titles: 3\n\nEnglish FA Cup: 1\n\nEnglish Football League Cup: 2\n\nSpanish La Liga titles: 2\n\nSpanish Copa del Rey: 2\n\nSpanish Supercup: 2\n\nUefa Champions League: 5 (four with Real Madrid, one with Man Utd)\n\nUefa Super Cup: 3\n\nFifa Club World Cup: 4 (three with Real Madrid, one with Man Utd)\n\nPortugal Super Cup: 1\n\nItalian Supercoppa: 2\n\nItalian Serie A titles: 2\n\nArab Club Champions Cup: 1\n\nRonaldo international honours with Portugal\n\nUefa European Championship titles: 1 (2016)\n\nUefa Nations League titles: 1 (2019)\n\nAll-time leading scorer in men's international football (130 goals)\n\nAll-time men's international appearances (209)\n\nAll-time leading scorer in European Championship history (14 goals in 27 tournament matches)\n\nEuro 2020 Golden Boot winner\n\nRecord number of European Championship tournaments: 6\n\nRonaldo vs. Messi: Ballon d’Or wins\n\nRonaldo – 5 wins: 2017, 2016, 2014, 2013, 2008\n\nMessi – 8 wins: 2023, 2021, 2019, 2015, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009\n\nMessi’s European Golden Shoe awards\n\n2009-10: 34 goals\n\n2011-12: 50 goals\n\n2012-13: 46 goals\n\n2016-17: 37 goals\n\n2017-18: 34 goals\n\n2018-19: 36 goals\n\nRonaldo’s European Golden Shoe awards\n\n2007-08: 31 goals\n\n2010-11: 40 goals\n\n2013-14: 31 goals (shared with Luis Suarez)\n\n2014-15: 48 goals\n\nHat-tricks\n\nThe rate at which the duo score hat-tricks is \"scarcely believable\", said the MessivsRonaldo.app, with a \"staggering\" 123 between them. Ronaldo leads the head-to-head 66-57, but Messi has a \"slight edge\" in frequency. Ronaldo scores a hat-trick approximately \"every 18.6 games\", while Messi manages once every 18.7.\n\nOf Ronaldo's 66 career hat-tricks, he scored 45 for Real Madrid, three for Manchester United, three for Juventus, and is currently on 10 for Portugal and six for Al-Nassr – the most recent coming last September when Al-Nassr thrashed Al-Wehda 6-0 in the Saudi Pro League.\n\nThe latest of Messi's 57 career hat-tricks was for Argentina in the 7-0 win over Curacao on 28 March 2023. He has nine hat-tricks for his country and previously scored 48 hat-tricks for Barcelona.\n\nIn league games, it's 36 for Messi and 45 for Ronaldo, while in the Champions League the two are tied on eight.\n\nFifa World Cup\n\nIt was the perfect end to Lionel Messi’s World Cup story. At Qatar 2022, the Argentina captain’s fifth and final World Cup, he achieved his lifelong dream of lifting the trophy for his country.\n\nWith two goals in the epic final against France, and a penalty in the shoot-out, Messi inspired Argentina to an unforgettable victory at the Lusail Stadium. He was also awarded the Golden Ball for the tournament's best player and only missed out on the Golden Boot after Kylian Mbappé's brilliant hat-trick saw the French striker finish with eight goals. Messi scored seven goals and also provided three assists in Qatar, and he moved above Brazil legend Pele on the World Cup all-time goalscorer list.\n\nMessi’s brilliant tournament saw him break a host of records. He is now Argentina’s all-time highest goalscorer in World Cups with 13 goals. And he also has the highest number of appearances in men’s World Cup history, with 26.\n\nMessi “not only emulated the deity of Argentinian football”, Diego Maradona, but he “finally plugged the burning gap on his CV”, winning the “one title that has eluded him”, said David Hytner in The Guardian. “In the process he gilded his claim to being recognised as the greatest player of them all.”\n\nCristiano Ronaldo also made history at Qatar 2022 as Portugal reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to Morocco 1-0. He became the first men’s player to score in five separate World Cup tournaments. His World Cup record stands at eight goals in 22 appearances.\n\nHere we take a look at their World Cup stats, according to MessivsRonaldo.app:\n\nMessi’s World Cup stats\n\nGames: 26\n\nGoals: 13\n\nAssists: 8\n\nMinutes played: 2,314\n\nMessi's World Cup tournament goals: 13\n\n2022: 7\n\n2018: 1\n\n2014: 4\n\n2010: 0\n\n2006: 1\n\nRonaldo's World Cup stats\n\nGames: 22\n\nGoals: 8\n\nAssists: 2\n\nMinutes played: 1,762\n\nHat-tricks: 1 – against Spain in 2018\n\nRonaldo's World Cup tournament goals: 8\n\n2022: 1\n\n2018: 4\n\n2014: 1\n\n2010: 1\n\n2006: 1\n\nUefa Champions League\n\nRonaldo vs. Messi in European football\n\nStatistics according to Uefa.com:\n\nChampions League goals (group stage to final): Ronaldo 140 (21 for Man Utd; 105 for Real Madrid; 14 for Juventus); Messi 129 (120 for Barcelona; 9 for PSG)\n\nTotal Uefa competition goals (Champions League and Europa League): Ronaldo 144; Messi 132\n\nChampions League hat-tricks: Ronaldo 8; Messi 8\n\nAll-time Champions League group stage goals: Ronaldo 73; Messi 80\n\nDid you know? Ronaldo is the only player to score in three Uefa Champions League finals, and the first to score in 11 successive Champions League matches\n\nChampions League head-to-head\n\nRonaldo Champions League stats: 140 goals, 40 assists, 183 appearances\n\nMessi Champions League stats: 129 goals, 38 assists, 169 appearances\n\nRonaldo Champions League winners’ medals – 5: 2007-08 (with Man Utd); 2013-14, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 (with Real Madrid)\n\nMessi Champions League winners’ medals – 4: 2005-06, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2014-15 (all with Barcelona)\n\nCareer hat-tricks in the Champions League: 8 each\n\nTheir last ever meeting?\n\nCristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have possibly shared a football pitch for the final time in their glittering careers. In an exhibition game between a Riyadh All-Star XI and Paris Saint-Germain on 19 January 2023, Ronaldo scored twice in his first match in Saudi Arabia, while Messi scored once for PSG, who won the contest 5-4.\n\nIt was a “thrilling” match in the Saudi capital city as the “two GOATs faced off”, said Shamoon Hafez on BBC Sport. And it was “fitting” that Ronaldo’s first game in the Gulf was against his “old foe” Messi, who lifted the World Cup in neighbouring Qatar just a month before.\n\nThe star duo have “contested” El Clasico, “fought it out” in the Champions League, “squared off” in the colours of their country, and “together they have reached such magnificent heights”, said Riath Al-Samarrai in the Daily Mail. Messi’s “still on top of the world” and Ronaldo “has got his payday”, but against “a backdrop of Saudi sportswashing”, the end of this “once-great rivalry” is certainly “tinged with sadness”.\n\nWhat people say about Messi\n\nCristiano Ronaldo: “I really admire the career he has had so far, and, for his part, he has already said that he had trouble when I left the Spanish league because it is a rivalry that he appreciates. It is a good rivalry that exists in football, but this is no exception. Michael Jordan had rivals in basketball, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were great rivals in Formula One, the only common point between all the big rivalries in the sport is that they are healthy.”\n\nGigi Buffon: “When I met Messi I reached out and touched him. I needed to make sure he was human like the rest of us.”\n\nRonaldinho: “When I look back on my career, the most enjoyable thing was seeing the early years of Leo Messi. When he retires, football – not just Barcelona – should retire the No.10 shirt.”\n\nPep Guardiola: “He is the best player I have ever seen. The best thing about him is not what he does but how simple he makes everything look.He is not just the best player because he can dribble past three or four players, it is because he does it better than anyone in the world.”\n\nNeymar: “I played with Messi, who is, for me, one of the greatest footballers of all time, and he is my idol in football.”\n\nDiego Maradona: “I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentine football and his name is Messi. Messi is a genius.”\n\nDavid Beckham: “He [Messi] is alone in his class as a player, it is impossible that there is another like him. He, like Cristiano Ronaldo, who is not at his level, are both above the rest.”\n\nWhat people say about Ronaldo\n\nLionel Messi: “(Ronaldo) is always there scoring goals in all the games and taking part in his club and national side. He has been doing that for many years and whether he is at his peak or a bit below it makes no difference.”\n\nBrazil legend Pele, after Ronaldo reached 770 official goals: “Life is a solo flight.
