        "text": "Manchester City have toppled Premier League records in vast quantities since Pep Guardiola joined, and they're on the precipice of yet another mark.\n\nCity are fresh off a famous 2022/23 season in which Guardiola led City to the European treble, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and Champions League titles.\n\nLooking to continue that stretch, Guardiola has engineered a furious start to the new campaign, guiding Man City to the Premier League summit and leaving them as the last team with the maximum points from their opening matches.\n\nAs City look to put themselves atop yet another list, The Sporting News details the best perfect starts to Premier League and English top flight campaigns as Guardiola hopes to topple further long-standing records.\n\nMORE: Updated Premier League table as Man City retain perfect record\n\nMost consecutive wins to start to Premier League season\n\nThe best start to a season in Premier League history is held by Chelsea in 2005/06, when they began the league campaign with nine straight victories.\n\nLed by manager Jose Mourinho, the Blues were exceptional to begin the year, keeping an incredible six straight clean sheets before conceding a goal to Luke Moore of Aston Villa after 584 minutes of Premier League play.\n\nChelsea would go on to win the Premier League title that year, as Frank Lampard led the club with 16 goals, followed by 12 from Didier Drogba and 10 by Hernan Crespo. They collected 91 points that year, with 27 of those coming during the early winning streak. Chelsea conceded just 22 goals that season, three fewer than second-best Liverpool.\n\nStart to Chelsea 2005/06 Premier League season\n\nMatch Date Fixture Result 1 Aug. 14, 2005 Wigan vs. Chelsea W 1-0 2 Aug. 21, 2005 Chelsea vs. Arsenal W 1-0 3 Aug. 24, 2005 Chelsea vs. West Brom W 4-0 4 Aug. 27, 2005 Tottenham vs. Chelsea W 2-0 5 Sep. 10, 2005 Chelsea vs. Sunderland W 2-0 6 Sep. 17, 2005 Charlton vs. Chelsea W 2-0 7 Sep. 24, 2005 Chelsea vs. Aston Villa W 2-1 8 Oct. 2, 2005 Liverpool vs. Chelsea W 4-1 9 Oct. 15, 2005 Chelsea vs. Bolton W 5-1 10 Oct. 23, 2005 Everton vs. Chelsea D 1-1 11 Oct. 29, 2005 Chelsea vs. Blackburn W 4-2 12 Nov. 6, 2005 Man United vs. Chelsea L 1-0\n\nBest starts in Premier League history\n\nOutside of Chelsea's record-setting 2005/06 season, there have been six occasions on which a club has won at least six straight matches to begin a Premier League campaign, including Manchester City this year.\n\nLiverpool did it under Jurgen Klopp to begin their famous 2019/20 Premier League title season â€“ which marks the only time City haven't won the league in the past seven years.\n\nIncredibly, only two of the four teams to win six straight games to start a season went on to win the title, those being Chelsea in 2009/10 and Man City in 2016/17. Newcastle first set the mark at six back in 1994, a record which would stand for more than a decade, but Blackburn would go on to win the title that year.\n\nClub Season Wins Chelsea 2005/06 9 Liverpool 2019/20 8 Man City 2023/24 6* Newcastle 1994/95 6 Chelsea 2009/10 6 Man City 2016/17 6 Liverpool 2018/19 6\n\nEnglish football record for best start to league season\n\nThe most wins to begin a top flight league campaign in English football history is 11, set by Tottenham back in 1960/61. As you'd expect, they won the title that year, finishing with 66 points rom 42 matches, in a time when a win was only worth two points.\n\nThey would bag the double that year, winning the FA Cup as well. It would be the last time they'd win a top flight title.\n\nThe most wins to begin any league campaign in English football history is 13, which Reading accomplished back in 1985/86 in the Third Division.\n\nMan City start to 2023/24 Premier League season\n\nManchester City have won their first six matches of the year, putting themselves within reach of the Premier League record.\n\nAfter winning the title last year, City were the pre-season favourites once again to top the table, and they're backing that up to start the season. Their schedule has been somewhat soft, facing only Newcastle in terms of likely top seven finishers.\n\nCity have a difficult stretch coming up, which means Guardiola's side will have to earn it if they are to set the record for best Premier League start to a season. They have Arsenal and Brighton on the list of upcoming matches, with the potential chance to set the record against arch-rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford.\n\nCity have also reached the six-game milestone once before under Guardiola, in 2016/17, but they faltered after that, winning just one of their next five en route to a third-place finish in the Catalan's debut campaign at the Etihad.\n\nFixtures and results for Man City 2023/24 Premier League season start"
