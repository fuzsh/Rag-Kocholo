        "text": "Borussia Dortmund have confirmed the signing of Manchester City full back Yan Couto, initially on loan but with an option to buy for a reported £23 million.\n\nThe reigning Premier League champions signed the right-back in 2020 from Brazilian side Cortiba FC for £5 million, but he failed to make a first-team appearance for City.\n\nSince signing for City, Couto spent three full seasons on loan at Spanish side Girona, who are owned by the City Football Group.\n\nPremier League\n\nGuardiola compares Haaland to Messi and Ronaldo - 'His numbers are that level'\n\n6 hours ago\n\nThe Brazil international joined the Spanish club on a one-year loan in 2020 before moving to Braga on loan for the 2021/22 season, making 42 appearances for the Portuguese outfit.\n\nThe 22-year-old then rejoined Girona on loan, spending the last two seasons in Spain and helping guide the club to a third-place finish in La Liga to qualify for the UEFA Champions League.\n\nThe defender made a total of 95 appearances for the club, scoring five goals and assisting 17 more across all competitions in that time.\n\nThe player will leave the Etihad Stadium on a 12-month loan deal with the obligation for Dortmund to make the deal permanent next summer if \"certain sporting criteria are fulfilled\".\n\n'It's difficult to be sharp if you play over 70 games a year' - Haaland on fixture drain\n\nCouto said on the transfer, via Dortmund's official website: \"For me it’s a dream come true. Borussia Dortmund is a special club.\n\n\"Every child in Brazil knows how great this club is, knows the fans, and is fascinated by the Yellow Wall. I can’t wait to wear the BVB shirt for the first time and experience the power and emotions in this brilliant stadium.\"\n\nThe German side will look to improve on a disappointing fifth-place finish in the Bundesliga last season, with new manager Nuri Sahin arriving at the Westfalenstadion after Edin Terzic's resignation following the 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final.\n\nCouto may not be the only player leaving the club this summer, with Kevin De Bruyne heavily linked with a move to the Middle East. Atletico Madrid are also eyeing striker Julian Alvarez as a replacement for Alvaro Mortata, who joined AC Milan after the European Championships.\n\nCity have already raised around £60 million in transfer fees for outgoing players, with Liam Delap, Tommy Doyle, Taylor Harwood-Bellis and Sergio Gomez all departing, while the club recieved a sell-on fee for Douglas Luiz's transfer from Aston Villa to Juventus.\n\nPep Guardiola's side play their final pre-season friendly on Saturday in the United States before flying home to face Manchester United in the Community Shield at Wembley on August 10.\n\n---\n\ndiscovery+ is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer\n\nPremier League\n\n'No space for all of them' - Maresca coy on Sterling future, says omission was 'tactical'\n\n6 hours ago\n\nPremier League\n\n'That's the million-dollar question' - Haaland reveals Pep demands after win over Chelsea\n\n8 hours ago"
