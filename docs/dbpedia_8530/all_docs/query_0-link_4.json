        "text": "Hans Luther (10 March 1879 – 11 May 1962) was a German politician and the first President of Germany. He made the German Confederation join the League of Nations.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nHans Luther was born in Berlin on 10 March 1879 into a Lutheran family as the son of Otto (1848–1912), a well-off merchant, and Wilhelmine Luther.\n\nAfter attaining the Abitur at the Leibniz-Gymnasium/Berlin, Luther studied law at Geneva, Kiel and Berlin from 1897 to 1901. His teachers included Otto von Gierke, Franz von Liszt, Heinrich Brunner, Gustav von Schmoller and Hugo Preuss. In 1904, Luther was awarded a Dr.jur. for his dissertation Die Zuständigkeit des Bundesrats zur Entscheidung von Thronstreitigkeiten innerhalb des Deutschen Reiches. He passed the Assessor exam in 1906 and worked in the Prussian administration, in 1906/07 at the city council of Charlottenburg, now a part of Berlin.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nIn 1907, Luther was elected to the Magdeburg city council where he increased the area assigned to Schreber garden tenfold and litigated against the regional potash industry for polluting the drinking water. From February 1913 to the summer of 1918, Luther was a member of the board of the Preußischer Städtetag (later Deutscher Städtetag). In the summer of 1918, he became Oberbürgermeister (mayor) of Essen. During the Revolution he managed to convince the revolutionary workers' and soldiers' councils to cooperate with the city administration and to accept the mayor's leading role.\n\nThe Republic Era[]\n\nHans Luther was still focusing on politics until a Democratic Revolution happened in Germany. The Royal family quit and now a Republic is ruled. Although he took a big part with other fellow politicians in the change they need to know who will rule. An election took place in 1923 between Luther, Ebert, and Simons. The votes were counted and Hans Luther was elected.\n\nPresidency[]\n\nHans Luther then started his years by negotiating with the British and French. He made the Republic of the German Confederation part of the League of Nations. The Germans also allied with the Americans. The Tariffs of 1925 gave out tariffs of agriculture imports which he signed the law. In 1926, The Germans get to have the Trenčín Region in Slovakia, although they were never in WWII. Hans Luther's presidency oversaw a new wave of German Culture and City growth. Hans Luther presidency was over in 1929 as he lost the election in 1928 from Paul von Hindenburg.\n\nDeath[]\n\nOver the years until 1968, Hans Luther dies at the age of 83. He was known as the \"The Father of German Confederation Republic\" due to as him being the first President of the Confederation and his works on a democratic change."
