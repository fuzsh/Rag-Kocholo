Luther's speech stressed Hitler's \"peaceful intentions\" toward his European neighbors. Nicholas Murray Butler, Columbia's president, rejected student appeals to cancel the invitation, calling the request \"illiberal\" and citing the need for academic freedom.[1]\n\nAfter the Second World War, Luther came out of retirement to become an advisor for the new government.\n\nHe died in Düsseldorf.\n\nHans Luther's First Cabinet, January – December 1925[]\n\nHans Luther, Chancellor\n\nGustav Stresemann (DVP), Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nMartin Schiele (DNVP), Minister of the Interior\n\nOtto von Schlieben (DNVP), Minister of Finance\n\nAlbert Neuhaus (DNVP), Minister of Economics\n\nHeinrich Brauns (Z), Minister of Labour\n\nJosef Frenken (Z), Minister of Justice\n\nOtto Gessler (DDP), Minister of Defence\n\nKarl Stingl (BVP), Minister of Posts\n\nRudolf Krohne (DVP), Minister of Transport\n\nGerhard Graf von Kanitz, Minister of Food\n\nChanges\n\n26 October 1925 – Schiele, Schlieben, and Neuhaus resign from the Cabinet.
