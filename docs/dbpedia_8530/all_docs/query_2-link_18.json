        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 16 Apr 2024 | Created 9 Aug 2011\n\nThis page has been accessed 9,939 times.\n\nBiography\n\nHans Luther has German Roots.\n\nJohannes Luther was the eldest son of the reformator Martin Luther (1483-1546) and his wife Katharina von Bora (1499-1552).\n\nhttps://gw.geneanet.org/cvpolier?lang=en&iz=0&p=johannes&n=luther\n\nHe is known as as \"Hänschen\", to whom Luther wrote when the latter was only four years old. The letter was sent from Coburg Castle; his purpose in writing the letter was to encourage his son to be diligent in his studies. Woven into the letter is a description of a wonderful garden that is open to studious children.[1]\n\nIn 1549 he went to the University of Königsberg (Prussia), but returned home in the summer of 1551 at the request of his mother. He soon got a job as a \"ducal chancellery\" (\"herzoglicher Kanzleirat\") in Weimar. After having been on leave for East Prussia already once in 1566, he came to Königsberg on a second trip in 1575, \"in businesses\", as his obituary says.\n\nHe died there on October 27, 1575 and was solemnly buried by the university.\n\nFrom his marriage to Elisabeth Creuziger/Cruciger, he has only one child, Katharina, wife of the pastor Nikolaus Böhme.[2]\n\nJohannes Luther war der älteste Sohn des Reformators Martin Luther (1483-1546) und seiner Ehefrau Katharina von Bora (1499-1552).\n\nEr ist bekannt als \"Hänschen\", an welchen Luther von der Feste Coburg aus den köstlichen kindlichen Brief geschrieben hat.[3]\n\nEr ging 1549 auf die Universität Königsberg (Preußen), kehrte aber 1551 im Sommer nach dem Wunsche der Mutter wieder heim. Er bekam dann bald eine Stelle als herzoglicher Kanzleirat in Weimar. Nachdem er schon einmal 1566 nach Ostpreußen beurlaubt worden war, kam er bei einer zweiten Reise 1575, \"in Geschäften\", wie das Leichenprogramm sagt, nach Königsberg.\n\nDort starb er am 27. Oktober 1575 und ist von der Universität feierlich begraben worden.\n\nAus seiner Ehe mit Elisabeth Creuziger/Cruciger ist nur eine Tochter Katharina überliefert, Gattin des Pastors Nikolaus Böhme.[2]\n\nhttp://qoqa.de/qoqa2_e.html\n\nThe son of Doktor Martin Luther, Johannes Luther, was called yesterday in a city of the old state from this miserable life into heaven. He was a man, who was characterized by religiousness, wisdom, erudition, honesty and virtue. He lived at the court of the Dukes of Saxony and of the Elector of Brandenburg and supported the decisions of the state. His nature was genuine, he loved the truth and hated and contemned sophistry and quarrels. The greed for money and illusive calculations to accumulate the fortune, he rejected and he was characterized even always by a generosity, that was almost bigger than it was up to his possibilities. He demonstrated to everybody a unique philantrophy. With highest diligence he bewared of curiosity, and the duties of his profession he performed as far as possible. He bore the common miseries of this life quietly and patiently. Some years ago he lived even at the court of the famous Duke Albrecht, the Duke of Prussia (in blessed memory). And just in this our academia he could be a member; he was enlisted and accepted by the leader Di Melchior Insinderus in the year 1549 to the official register, he heard eagerly the public lectures. He arrived here completely by reason of certain enterprises. He was ill for a rather long time, but he bore the cruelty of the illness with strong devoutness. When he perceived finally, that the time of his departing this life was imminent nearly, he prayed to the Lord in true faith and repeated often this sentence: I want to be loosened and to be with Christ. In this way he confided in his God and passed away peacefully in God.\n\nLet us recapitulate once again: It is certain, that Johannes Luther during his marriage since 1563 had a daughter and at least three sons. But perhaps we must still assign to him those Friedrich Luther, that we have to handle later. Except for the three stirps and their descendants, that are containing in the parish registers in Eastern Prussia, you can find nowhere in Eastern Prussia the surname Luther. Out of it we can suggest, that the surname Luther is come first with Johannes Luther to Eastern Prussia.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nAccording to the book \"Einladung an Dr. Martin Luther's Deutsches Vaterland zur dritten Secularfeier seines Todestages des 18. Februars 1846 (p.8)\" Google Books Link, Johannes (Hans) Luther only had a daughter, who was married, but did not have any children \"...der älteste Sohn Johannes hatte von seiner Gattin Elisabeth Cruziger erweislich nur ein Kind, Catharina Luther, welche mit dem Pfarrer Böhme zu Eilenburg in kinderloser Ehe lebte.\"\n\nThere are arguments though, that indicate that Johannes Luther really also had sons. Because these sons are (still) not recognized by the Lineage Socitety, they are not mentioned in the books about the descendants of Martin Luther. That is why I will put the relationship of Johannes to his sons as \"uncertain\".\n\nSources\n\n↑ The letter (translated by Thomas Dunlap) can be found under: germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org.
