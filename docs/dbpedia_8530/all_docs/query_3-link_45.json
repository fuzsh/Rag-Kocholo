        "text": "Above/featured: ‚ÄúLuther war hier. (Luther was here.)‚Äù Eisleben, Germany. Photo, 27 Oct 2016.\n\nIn pre-teen years, I attended a Catholic elementary school by weekday, and a missions-oriented Protestant church by weekend. I already had multiple questions running around my pre-scientist brain, like electrons appearing and dissipating in a fuzzy halo. When various disparate elements began to settle with few satisfying answers, I left behind the churches and their respective religions. But one thing that‚Äôs remained is my love of history. History has never been boring, because I carry the past (as offspring of immigrants), and I‚Äôm determined to bring history‚Äôs lessons into the present.\n\nEven in youth, I had to ask: why was one set of churches called ‚ÄúProtestant‚Äù? What was under protest? How did one man help spark a movement that would help merge and create a version of a language that continues today, that would bring accessible means to literacy for the public, and that would begin to change rule by religion to rule by law?\n\nMartin Luther: Luder‚Äô name at birth\n\nFrom his birth in Eisleben; to formative years in Mansfeld, Magdeburg, and Erfurt; to the bulk of his working and teaching years in Wittenberg; to his death in Eisleben, Martin Luther set upon a course that helped change language, education, culture, religion, and governance. In many ways, Luther had much to thank Jan Hus for the latter‚Äôs efforts to reform the Catholic Church in Bohemia one hundred years earlier.\n\nEvery year on the 31st of October, a number of cities, regions, and federal states in Germany mark an important event in this movement. It‚Äôs widely understood Martin Luther walked up to the Castle Church in Wittenberg and pinned his 95 Theses to the church doors on 31 October 1517. Even if direct evidence Luther actually posted papers to the doors is debatable, what‚Äôs not is that 2017 marks the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in Germany.\n\n16 places in Germany\n\nLuther influenced people and cities throughout what is now present-day Germany. In a non-exhaustive list, here are 16 cities (in alphabetical order) where he left his mark: 6 are in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, 3 in Thuringia, 2 in Saxony, 2 in Rhineland-Palatinate, 2 in Bavaria, and 1 in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.\n\nAugsburg (Bavaria)\n\nDessau (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nDresden (Saxony)\n\nEisenach (Thuringia)\n\nEisleben (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nErfurt (Thuringia)\n\nHalle an der Saale (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nHeidelberg (Baden-W√ºrttemberg)\n\nLeipzig (Saxony)\n\nMagdeburg (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nMansfeld (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nMittenwald (Bavaria)\n\nSpeyer (Rhineland-Palatinate)\n\nWeimar (Thuringia)\n\nWittenberg (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nWorms (Rhineland-Palatinate)\n\nEvery city listed is accessible with German national rail (Deutsche Bahn).\n\n1. Augsburg (Bavaria)\n\nIn 1518, Martin Luther was called to Augsburg to answer Cardinal Cajetan‚Äôs charge of heresy. Cajetan ordered Luther to withdraw statements challenging the morality of the practice of indulgences and questioning the supreme authority of the Pope. With no satisfactory conclusion for either side, Luther posted in defiance at the cathedral‚Äôs portal a notice opposing Rome‚Äôs heresy trial against him. With Cajetan‚Äôs subsequent orders to arrest Luther looming large, Luther managed to escape Augsburg. In the Augsburg Confessions (Confessio Augustana), Phillip Melanchthon set down into print the underlying principles of the Reformation as ‚Äúconfessions‚Äù in 1530. The document was delivered to and read by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Augsburg. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg recognized the Confessions and allowed local rulers the authority to decide what religion their subjects could follow (cuius regio, eius religio). Today, a plaque near the cathedral commemorates Luther‚Äôs act of dissent in 1518.\n\n‚Ä¢ At the Domportal: REVOCA! Cajetan demanded of Luther in 1518; Luther said ‚Äúno.‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¢ Augsburg: Fugger, Luther, & water in Germany‚Äôs 3rd oldest city\n\nBack to list\n\n2. Dessau (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nSituated only 30 kilometres (20 miles) west from Wittenberg, Martin Luther visited Dessau regularly and preached at St. Mary‚Äôs Church (Marienkirche). Built in 1508 and finished in 1554, the castle and town church of St. Mary‚Äôs was constructed on the site of a former Romanesque church. In 1534, the city‚Äôs authorities declared the city as Lutheran, and in the same year on the Thursday before Easter, Luther offered Communion to the community, providing the town another push towards the Reformation. This building is no longer a church and is used as event space.\n\nBack to list\n\n3. Dresden (Saxony)\n\nStanding in the square in front of Dresden‚Äôs landmark Frauenkirche is a late 19th-century memorial to Luther‚Äôs visit to the city in 1516 and 1517. The memorial statue was destroyed along with the church in Allied air raids of 1945. Post-reunification meant repair funding and work, and the statue was restored and reinstalled in conjunction with the unveiling of the Frauenkirche in 2005.\n\nBack to list\n\n4. Eisenach (Thuringia)\n\nAfter being called to the Imperial Diet (parliament) of Worms in 1521 to answer charges of heresy, Luther departed with his life under threat. His benefactor Frederick the Wise of Saxony arranged to have Luther ‚Äúkidnapped‚Äù and brought to Wartburg Castle in Eisenach to ensure Luther‚Äôs safety. In Wartburg, Luther hid as ‚ÄúJunker J√∂rg‚Äù (Knight George), and proceeded to translate the New Testament from Greek into German. From a variety of dialects at the time, he created a common simplified version of German to ensure accessibility to as many people as possible which would improve literacy at large. The Wartburg Castle has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999.\n\nBack to list\n\n5. Eisleben (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nEisleben is the city where Martin Luther was born in 1483 and where he died in 1546. However, most of his youth- and adult-years were spent in Mansfeld and Wittenberg, respectively; see below. The Luther Birth- and Death Houses are part of the inscription as UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996. Below is a picture from inside the Peter-Pauli-Kirche (Peter and Paul Church) where Luther was baptized the day after he was born.\n\n‚Ä¢ Martin Luther‚Äôs Birth & Death Sites\n\n‚Ä¢ Fotoeins Friday: where Martin Luther was baptized in Eisleben\n\nBack to list\n\n6. Erfurt (Thuringia)\n\nErfurt is the city where Luther enrolled at the University of Erfurt in 1501 to successfully complete the Baccaleureat and Master‚Äôs degrees in arts and humanities, and where he changed his life and entered the Augustine monastery in 1505 at the age of 22 to become a monk. In 1521, he introduced to the city‚Äôs citizenry principles of what would become the Reformation; he would subsequently be called to the Diet of Worms to answer to the charge of heresy. After successfully hiding out in Eisenach‚Äôs Wartburg Castle (see above), he returned to Erfurt in 1522 and gave a sermon at Kaufmannskirche (Merchants‚Äô Church). Luther is honoured with a memorial statue in front of the church, which was built in 1248 as Romanesque church and rebuilt and reconsecrated in the Gothic style in 1368. The parents of Johann Sebastian Bach were married at this church in 1668.\n\n‚Ä¢ Erfurt: Martin Luther‚Äôs start at the Augustine Monastery\n\nBack to list\n\n7. Halle an der Saale (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nHalle was the home of Luther‚Äôs great rival, Cardinal Albrecht, Archbishop of Magdeburg and Mainz, who was the highest-ranking dignitary after the Pope in the Holy Roman Empire. Albrecht would have been the recipient of Luther‚Äôs letter with arguments against Catholic dogma and challenges against excess by Albrecht and the Church. Albrecht would eventually be forced out of Halle in 1541. After Luther‚Äôs death in Eisleben in 1546, the subsequent funeral procession on foot to Wittenberg stopped in Halle where molds of his death mask and hands were made. These relics now reside in the Marktkirche St. Marien (St. Mary‚Äôs Market Church). Across from the church is Germany‚Äôs oldest and likely largest Protestant library, the Marienbibliothek, with several Luther Bibles.\n\n‚Ä¢ Halle highlights in the H√§ndelstadt\n\nBack to list\n\n8. Heidelberg (Baden-W√ºrttemberg)\n\nThe Universit√§tsplatz (University Square) in Heidelberg is over the foundation walls of the former Augustinian monastery. To commemorate Luther‚Äôs visit to the monastery and debate (Disputation) in 1518, a memorial plaque was installed at Universit√§tsplatz in 1983. The plaque reads:\n\nMartin Luther (1483-1546): zum Gedenken an seinen Aufenthalt im Kloster der Augustiner und an seine Heidelberger Disputation am 26. April 1518. Im Lutherjahr 1983.\n\nIn commemoration of his Heidelberg visit at the Augustinian monastery and debate on the 26th of April 1518. In Luther year 1983 (500th anniversary of his birth).\n\n‚Ä¢ My Heidelberg: 1 of 38 Highlights from Home.\n\nBack to list\n\n9. Leipzig (Saxony)\n\nThe Leipzig Disputation in 1519 pitted Luther, Philipp Melanchthon, and Andreas Bodenstein (Karlstadt) against Johannes Eck from Ingolstadt. During the debates, the Protestant reformers cast doubt on the absolute doctrinal authority of the Pope. The Reformation movement bore fruit in the city with the first Lutheran sermons in 1522. Luther returned to Leipzig in 1539 with a visit to St. Thomas Church after the city converted officially to the Reformation. This same church is best known for Johann Sebastian Bach; he was the church‚Äôs Kapellmeister (music director) from 1723 until his death in 1750, and his grave is near the church‚Äôs main altar.\n\nBack to list\n\n10. Magdeburg (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nIn 1497 at the age of 14, Luther left Mansfeld for further education in Magdeburg for about a year, before he moved onto Eisenach and Erfurt. Luther would subsequently visit Magdeburg a number of times later in life. Most notably in 1524, he visited the Johanniskirche (St. John‚Äôs Church) and his sermon helped convince most of the city‚Äôs council to convert to the Reformation. A monument to Luther by Emil Hundrieser in 1886 now stands in front of St. John‚Äôs Church.\n\n‚Ä¢ Magdeburg, the city of 2 Ottos\n\nBack to list\n\n11. Mansfeld (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nShortly after Martin was born in 1483, his parents, Hans and Margarete Luder, moved the household from Eisleben to nearby Mansfeld for better economic opportunities; historically, the surrounding area was dotted with many mines for ore and minerals. With steady income from mining and subsequent mining operations, the Luder family lived comfortably, and Martin‚Äôs parents lived in Mansfeld for the rest of their lives. Martin grew up in Mansfeld until the age of 14. In 1497, Martin departed for Magdeburg and Eisenach to further his education. Martin would sign documents and letters with the surname evolving from Luder to Eleutherius to Luther. The restored family house and the modern museum across the street provide an account for life in the late-15th and early-16th century in the Mansfeld-S√ºdharz region.\n\n‚Ä¢ Mansfeld: Martin Luther‚Äôs childhood home\n\n‚Ä¢ Fotoeins Friday: Luther‚Äôs parents house in Mansfeld\n\nBack to list\n\n12. Mittenwald (Bavaria)\n\nAfter being ordained as a priest in 1507, Martin Luther continued his (doctoral) studies in Theology at the University of Erfurt. He and a fellow monk were called to Rome in 1510 to represent the Augustinian order. His outbound journey from Erfurt took him west through Nuremberg, Ulm, Lindau, and Milan. The return journey to Erfurt took him on an eastern route through Verona, Innsbruck, the Isar river valley via Mittenwald, then Augsburg, Nuremberg, and beyond. There isn‚Äôt a lot of physical evidence of his stay at the Pilgerhaus (Pilgrim House) in Mittenwald in March 1511, but that didn‚Äôt stop the Pilgerhaus from installing signage nor the local evangelical Protestant church (Evangelisch-Lutherische Dreifaltigkeitskirche Mittenwald) from constructing a stone memorial in 1983 (on the 500th anniversary year of his birth).\n\nBack to list\n\n13. Speyer (Rhineland-Palatinate)\n\nCompleted in 1904, the Ged√§chtniskirche (Memorial Church) acknowledges the reformers‚Äô protests against the reinstatement of the absolute authority of the Catholic Church at the Imperial Diet (royal parliament) in Speyer in 1529. Representatives of self-declared evangelical or ‚Äúreform‚Äù states within the Holy Roman Empire had arrived in Speyer to convene the imperial parliament (Diet) to protest the continuing intransigence of the Pope to allow an alternative to Catholicism. In hindsight, a way to break papal power structures would prove politically useful to regional rulers who wished to rally people around the cause of ‚Äúlocal rule‚Äù, rather than rule from a very distant Rome. After the official declaration of protest, followers of the Reform or Luther movement would be known as ‚ÄúProtestants.‚Äù\n\nBack to list\n\n14. Weimar (Thuringia)\n\nWeimar‚Äôs St. Peter and Paul parish church (also called the Herder Church) contains a pulpit that was used by Luther between 1518 and 1540. The church also features the 1555 altar triptych. The triptych was painted by Lucas Cranach the Senior and Junior, both of whom were Luther‚Äôs contemporaries. The altar piece is an important testament to Reformation history for Weimar and present-day Thuringia. The Herder Church is part of the ‚ÄúClassic Weimar‚Äù inscription as UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998.\n\n‚Ä¢ Weimar Classicism: Cranach Altar in the City Church\n\nBack to list\n\n15. Wittenberg (Saxony-Anhalt)\n\nWittenberg is where Martin Luther spent a large part of his life and career, happily married to former nun Katharina von Bora who would be his business and managing partner. Four sites make up the town‚Äôs inscription as UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996: St. Mary‚Äôs Town Church, Castle Church, Luther House, and Melanchthon House. Wittenberg was the centre of attention for the Reformation quincentenary in 2017.\n\n‚Ä¢ Castle Church (Schlosskirche)\n\n‚Ä¢ St. Mary‚Äôs Town and Parish Church (Stadt- und Pfarrenkirche St. Marien)\n\n‚Ä¢ More historical highlights in Wittenberg\n\nBack to list\n\n16. Worms (Rhineland-Palatinate)\n\nMartin Luther was called to the Imperial Diet (parliament) of Worms in 1521 to answer charges of heresy. He went to Worms to defend himself, but he would have been wary, no doubt thinking about what happened to Bohemian reformer Jan Hus in 1415. Luther denied all charges and stuck to his arguments against excess and absolute authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church. Designed by Ernst Rietschel and unveiled in 1868, the Luther Memorial in Worms is the world‚Äôs largest Reformation monument which also includes other important persons of the Reformation.\n\n‚Ä¢ Luther on trial in 1521 at the Diet of Worms\n\n‚Ä¢ The world‚Äôs largest Reformation monument\n\nBack to list\n\nMore\n\n‚Ä¢ Martin Luther timeline (Luther Country)\n\n‚Ä¢ Luther 2017\n\nThe map below of ‚ÄúLuther Country‚Äù in the German federal states of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia shows places where Martin Luther left his mark; nine cities marked with orange squares are included in the list above.\n\nBack to list"
