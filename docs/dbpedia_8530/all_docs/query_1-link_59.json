        "text": "At the House of Culture here, Gudrun Riedel flipped through her calendar of Martin Luther events and her list of Martin Luther exhibits and shrugged coyly at the ironies of her destiny.\n\nAs a schoolgirl, Mrs. Riedel said, she had learned from East Germany's Communist authorities that Luther, the initiator of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, was \"an enemy of the peasants and the Jews.\" Later, after the Communist authorities redefined Luther in 1983 as a \"pre-bourgeois revolutionary,\" Mrs. Riedel understood there was a \"solid regard for the inheritance of Luther as a person.\"\n\nNow, she said, her task in the reunified, non-Communist Germany lay in a capitalist marketing of this year's commemoration of the 450th anniversary of Luther's death, at a time when his legacy again arouses a passionate and remarkable debate: was he the forerunner of modern German democracy, or did his belief in obedience to the state prepare the German psyche, centuries later, for submission to Hitler?\n\nFor most of this year, the towns dotted around here where Martin Luther prayed, preached and studied will be the center of the most concerted effort to draw in visitors, income and prestige since the Communists then in power twinned commemorations of Luther's birth with the 1983 centenary of the death of Karl Marx."
