        "text": "During the diet of worms Luther was asked to take back all of his writings, His writing had included stuff the church liked, they wanted him to recant it all though. Luther refused to take back his writings and left. Luther was then going to travel back to Wittenberg when Charles V to declared Luther as an outlaw. Luther's way back to Wittenberg Frederick kidnapped him and brought him to the Wartburg castle to keep him safe from Charles V and his men\n\nMartin Luther was a man of great thought and constantly went against the feelings and views of other people of his time. Martin Luther was born on November 10th in 1483, in the Saxon town of Eisleben located in Germany. Martin was born of mother Margrethe, who many of his enemies thought of as being a whore and a bath attendant, yet Martin recalled her later on in life as someone who was hardworking and very able and willing to punish him if he had done wrong. Martin Luther grew up in the middle-class range and wasn't born into great wealth like many other great scholars of his time were like such as Girolamo Savonarola, who's family was rich before his birth around Luther’s time. Martin Luther’s father's name was Han's Luder, which later\n\nBorn November 10th 1483 in Eisleben, Saxony, Martin Luther was baptised the following day into the Catholic church. Being the eldest of a large family, Luther’s father wanted his son to complete his masters, and then his law degree. During his time studying to becoming a lawyer, Luther studied the arts of the mind in theology and philosophy, though even these became unsatisfying as Luther believed strongly in the importance of faith in god rather than reasoning. Legend holds that a sign from St Anne is the reason for Luther’s radical change into a religious role; Returning to Erfurt after visiting his parents, Luther encountered a thunderstorm where a bolt of lightning struck near him, terrified, Luther pleaded out \"St. Anne Help me! I will become a monk.” Once the storm had passed, Luther, against his parents will, entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt in mid July 1505, and continued his search for religious understanding.\n\nThe world into which Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, was in the midst of great change. In Western European history, the Middle Ages (roughly from 400 to 1400) had been an age of walls and of faith. Around each little town men had built massive stone walls against the evils outside. Inside these walls, medieval people knew their place. They were craftsmen, noblemen, churchmen, farmers, and knights. They did not question their duties because they were safe and had faith in the way things were run.\n\nBorn in 1483 to a family of peasant origins (his father worked in a copper mine in the Mansfeld region), Martin Luther was admitted in 1505 to the Augustinian convent of Erfurt, where his intellectual qualities were quickly noticed. Ordained a priest two years later, he was appointed to teach philosophy. Later, he taught biblical theology at the University of Wittenberg, where he became a doctor of\n\nMartin Luther’s strict upbringing provoked his view of God as being a harsh judge and impelled him to depart from law school at Erfurt to become a monk. Luther was born on November 10, 1483 in Eisleben, Germany where his father Hans started out as a farmer and eventually reached moderate wealth by owning copper mines. Hans would have never been able to attain these copper mines without marrying Margarete (Lindeman) Ziegler who came from a fairly prosperous family. From an early age Luther was destined to become a lawyer and his parents were committed to see their son succeed in life. Luther obeyed his father’s desire for him to become a lawyer therefore he was sent to the most prestigious schools in the area. Luther started out going to Latin\n\nMartin Luther was a professor of theology in Wittenberg and a German monk who initially started the Reformation in the 1500s. Born on November 10th, 1483 in Eisleben, Germany, he was going to be a lawyer through his father’s wishes. One fateful afternoon returning home, he was nearly struck by lightning in a thunderstorm. He felt that this was a sign for him to become a monk and quit law school. Martin Luther joined a monastery in Germany, studying the Bible and to search for salvation through dedicating his life to learning/teaching the Gospel. However as he studied more, he began to feel and realize that the Catholic Church was wrong and had gone astray. People were complaining that the church was\n\nMartin entered the Augustinian monastery at Erfurt, did his one-year trial period and made his final vow to renounce the world forever. This involved a vow of poverty, chastity and obedience. When a monk took that vow, the belief was that he reverted back to the grace Adam had before the Fall, and even though he’d fall again he’d have the monastic lifestyle to help keep him straight and pure for heaven. In April 1507, at twenty-three years of age, Martin was ordained to the priesthood and was now authorized to administer the sacraments. The period that followed is known as Luther’s “years of silence.” Martin did as asked and studied theology in an effort to become a professor at one of the many new universities being staffed by monks. He attained his bachelor degree in theology in 1509, a year after moving to the University of Wittenberg where\n\nMartin Luther, a German monk, started the biggest reformation in Christian history in 1517. Causing the reformation was the idea held by the Catholics that indulgences, or rather temporal pardons meant for the wrongdoings, were in a position of being achieved by the people who had the feeling that they had committed a sin. Martin Luther had chosen a path that needed dedication and sacrifice by fasting and dedicating his time to prayers (Luther & Dillenberger, 1961). The commitment that he made led to his realisation of how sinful he has been and this put him to anguish. Luther was facing so much anguish which forced the order for Luther to intitiate instructions in academics. Later on he was ordained into the priesthood in 1508. He was awarded a doctorate in 1512 and started teaching theology at Wittenberg. At the university is when he started to question the doctrines that were been followed by the roman church. He developed a strong feeling on matters concerning penance, salvation and the righteous way of life, and this formed a strong basis of his believe. According to him, salvation was a gift from God could not be given by anyone or be found through"
