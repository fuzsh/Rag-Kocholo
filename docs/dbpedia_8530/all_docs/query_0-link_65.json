Her master thesis analyses the genesis and operating principles of daily talk shows in German private television in the 1990s against the background of medieval village courts. She then complemented her education with postgraduate studies in German as a foreign language at Ruhr-Universität Bochum in 2003 and with a diploma in Journalism from Freie Journalistenschule Berlin in 2020.\n\nBesides her career as a teacher, Ariane is a keen writer and journalist. Her work mainly deals with the social transformation and cultural evolution of her hometown Berlin over the past three decades, captured in daily life and in the biographies of its inhabitants.\n\nContact:\n\nAriane Friedländer\n\nGerman Studies\n\n[email protected]\n\nContact\n\nJoon Park\n\nSouth Korea\n\nBA in Studio Art and Psychology\n\nBoston College\n\nJoon Park (b. 1986, Seoul, South Korea) earned his BA degrees in Studio Art and Psychology from Boston College, USA.\n\nHe is a 2012 recipient of the Mima Weissmann fellowship at the ceramics program at Harvard University.
