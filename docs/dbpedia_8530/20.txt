Profession: Chancellor of Germany

Biography: Hans Luther was a German politician and jurist who served as the Chancellor of Germany and made significant contributions to Germany's economic stability during the Weimar Republic. He played a pivotal role in combating hyperinflation and was involved in major international treaties of the time.

Born into a Lutheran family, Hans Luther studied law and was deeply influenced by scholars Otto von Gierke and Franz von Liszt. After obtaining his doctorate in 1904, he entered the Prussian administration. In 1907, he married Gertrud Schmidt and had three daughters with her before she passed away. Later, he married Gertrud Sioli.

Luther's political career began with his election to the Magdeburg city council in 1907 and his tenure as mayor of Essen in 1918. He initially declined ministerial positions in 1922 but later served as Minister for Food and Agriculture and as Minister of Finance in 1923, where he played a crucial role during the hyperinflation crisis. His actions contributed to the stabilization of the German Mark and the introduction of the Reichsmark.

In January 1925, he was appointed Chancellor of Germany, leading a coalition government. He negotiated the Treaty of Locarno and improved social insurance during his term. He resigned from the chancellorship in May 1926 over a dispute concerning the Flaggen-Verordnung.

Following his chancellorship, Luther became the president of the Reichsbank from 1930 to 1933 and served as German Ambassador to the United States from 1933 to 1937, promoting the Nazi regime's agendas. He retired from public service in 1937 but remained active in economic and political advisory roles after World War II.

Hans Luther died in Düsseldorf in 1962. His works, such as Politiker ohne Partei (1960) and Vor dem Abgrund 1930–1933 (posthumous, 1964), reflect his economic and political insights. His life story is documented in detail in The Lives of Hans Luther, 1879–1962 by C. Edmund Clingan (2010).
