Bovie - electrocautery Kocher Sherrington Halsted Bovie\n\n8. Discoveries  Cushing reflex - relation between blood pressure and intracranial pressure (1901)  Due to increased intracranial pressure - results in increased systolic pressure, bradycardia, irregular respiration – Cushing triad  Experimented in dogs, monitored the caliber and color of cortical vessels by fitting a glass window into the skull of the dog\n\n9.
