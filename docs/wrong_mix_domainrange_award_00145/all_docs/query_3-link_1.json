        "text": "Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen (6 April 1911 â€“ 6 August 1979) was a German biochemist.\n\nBiography\n\nFeodor Lynen was born in Munich, Germany on April 6, 1911. He started his studies at the chemistry department of Munich University in 1930 and graduated in March 1937 under Heinrich Wieland with the work: \"On the Toxic Substances in Amanita\". After several years of lecturing there, Lynen became professor at the Munich University in 1947. From 1954 onwards he was director of the Max-Planck Institute for Cellular Chemistry in Munich, which was merged into the newly founded Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry in 1972.\n\nIn 1964 he won the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology together with Konrad Bloch for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. He gave his Nobel Lecture on 11 December 1964 titled The Pathway from Activated Acetic Acid to the Terpenes and Fatty Acids.\n\nFellowship\n\nThe Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has a fellowship named in his honor."
