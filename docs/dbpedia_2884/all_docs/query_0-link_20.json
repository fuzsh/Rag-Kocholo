        "text": "JOHN CARLOS I\n\nKING OF SPAIN\n\nTo all who present it and understand it.\n\nSabed: That the General Courts have approved and I come to sanction the following law.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nI\n\nThe Spanish economy is characterized by its dynamism as it has been shown in the spectacular development of the last decades. In that time, their integration has increased internationally, which has enabled them to benefit from increased opportunities for growth.\n\nIn this process of development, economic and financial imbalances have been accumulating. Spain has made progress in 2012 towards the correction of its vulnerabilities, implementing an economic policy strategy that pursues the transition towards a sustainable balance and laying the foundations for growth that will enable employment to be generated.\n\nIn this context, the structural reforms that have been implemented in Spain since the beginning of 2012 pursue three main objectives: firstly, to provide the Spanish economy with macroeconomic stability both in terms of public deficit and inflation as an external balance. Secondly, to achieve sound and sound financial institutions, which will enable credit to be channelled back into productive investment. Finally, to achieve a high degree of flexibility in order to adjust relative prices and wages, so as to increase the competitiveness of our economy.\n\nFrom this set of actions, some of the fundamental obstacles to economic reactivation have been overcome. In any case, it is necessary to continue with the reformist effort to recover the path of economic growth and job creation.\n\nTherefore, in order to develop the third area of the aforementioned economic policy strategy, in addition to maintaining and culminating the actions already initiated, a second generation of necessary structural reforms is begun. to grow back and create jobs.\n\nWithin the Spanish business fabric, SMEs and the self-employed stand out for their quantitative and qualitative importance. Studies show that precisely these types of companies and entrepreneurs are one of the main engines to energize the Spanish economy, given its capacity to generate employment and its potential for value creation.\n\nHowever, over the last few years, these economic agents have seen a decline in economic activity and have had to develop their activity in a working, fiscal, regulatory and financial environment that has diminished their economic activity. ability to adapt to changes. In addition, they are facing a structural dependence on bank-based funding that can, in circumstances such as the current ones, limit their ability to expand.\n\nThe regulatory and institutional framework in which business activities are developed is essential to drive productivity gains and optimize resources.\n\nTherefore, it is essential that the public authorities strengthen and facilitate the business initiative, especially in the current economic situation. It is necessary to establish an environment that promotes entrepreneurial culture, as well as the creation and development of business projects that generate jobs and added value.\n\nSupport for entrepreneurial initiative, business development and job creation is the common logic that vertebra the set of measures contained in this law.\n\nIn this sense, measures are adopted in this law, as a matter of urgency, aimed at developing the Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment Strategy, to encourage business financing through alternative markets, to reduce late payments in commercial transactions and, in general, promote the competitiveness of the Spanish economy.\n\nII\n\nYouth unemployment in Spain is a structural problem, which has been exacerbated by the crisis, and which has serious consequences for the present and future situation of young Spaniards and limits the potential growth of the Spanish economy in the long run.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2012, Spain recorded an unemployment rate of 54.1% for young people under the age of 25, compared with 23% for the EU-27, according to Eurostat data.\n\nIf we look at the breakdown of the data from the Labour Force Survey (EPA) for the fourth quarter of 2012, the unemployment rate is 74% in the population group composed of young people aged between 16 and 19, in 51.7%. among young people aged between 20 and 24, and 34.4% among young people aged between 25 and 29.\n\nIn addition to the circumstances arising from the current economic situation, there are a number of structural weaknesses that directly influence the young and the proposed employment figures, such as the high school dropout rate, which doubles the values of the EU-27; the marked polarisation of the labour market, where young people leave their studies with low qualifications and others, highly skilled, are underemployed; on the medium-grade vocational training and the low employability of young people, In particular with regard to the knowledge of foreign languages; high temporality and unwanted partial recruitment; the difficulty of access to the labour market for groups at risk of social exclusion; and the need to improve the level of self-employment and entrepreneurship among young people.\n\nTitle I develops the Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment Strategy 2013-2016 that is part of the objective of promoting measures aimed at reducing youth unemployment, whether through employment or employment. through self-employment and entrepreneurship, and is the result of a process of dialogue and participation with the social partners.\n\nIn addition, it responds to the recommendations that the European Commission has made in terms of young employment and is part of the National Reform Plan launched by the Government. In this way, it is in line with the objectives of the European Youth Guarantee and develops a good part of the specific recommendations or lines of action proposed from the European Union's areas.\n\nIts objectives are to improve the employability of young people, to increase the quality and stability of employment, to promote equal opportunities in access to the labour market and to promote entrepreneurship. And the axes on which the strategy is based are: to encourage recruitment and entrepreneurship among young people, to adapt education and training to the reality of the labour market and to reduce the rate of school leaving early.\n\nTo make this possible, the Strategy contains a number of measures aimed at encouraging the integration of young people into the labour market, either as an employed person or through entrepreneurship, which are classified according to their impact and their temporary development.\n\nThe Strategy aims to serve as a means of participation for all public and private institutions, companies and all types of organizations that want to collaborate in achieving their goals.\n\nTo do this, it has been articulated as an open instrument, which can be added to all those who want to contribute their own initiatives to meet the challenge of youth employment in any of its forms, and self-employment, and shall have a stamp or mark which may be used in recognition of their contribution.\n\nThis set of measures has been designed after a process of dialogue and participation with the social partners. Similarly, consultations have been held with the principal entities and associations of autonomous work and the social economy, among others.\n\nIn this law, a first set of measures is developed which is expected to have a positive impact in reducing the youth unemployment rate and improving quality and stability in employment.\n\nIn Chapter I of Title I measures are taken to promote entrepreneurship and self-employment among young people under the age of 30, among whom the introduction of a reduced initial quota is highlighted. the compatibility of the unemployment benefit with the start of an activity on its own account, or the extension of the possibilities for the application of the capitalisation of unemployment benefit.\n\nIn addition, Chapter II establishes a more favourable fiscal framework for the self-employed, which initiates an entrepreneurial activity with the aim of encouraging the creation of companies and reducing the tax burden during the period of the first years of the exercise of an activity.\n\nThus, in the area of Corporate Tax, a tax rate of 15% is set for the first € 300,000 of tax base, and 20% for the excess over that amount, applicable in the first the tax period in which the tax base of the institutions is positive and in the tax period following this.\n\nIn line with the above, in the Tax on the Income of the Physical Persons, with the aim of encouraging the beginning of entrepreneurial activity, a new reduction of 20 percent is established on net yields. of the economic activity obtained by taxpayers who have commenced the exercise of an economic activity, applicable in the first tax period in which the net return is positive and in the tax period following that period.\n\nAlso, in the area of the Income Tax of the Physical Persons, the limit currently applicable to the exemption of unemployment benefits in the single payment method is abolished.\n\nChapter III contains measures to encourage the incorporation of young people into social economy enterprises, as well as incentives for the recruitment of young people in unemployment. Among the latter, the incentives for part-time recruitment with training links, the indefinite recruitment of a young person by micro-enterprises and self-employed entrepreneurs and the recruitment of trainees stand out.\n\nIn addition, the recruitment of young self-employed people over 45 years of age and the recruitment of young people to acquire a first professional experience is encouraged.\n\nChapter IV incorporates measures related to the improvement of work intermediation, the effectiveness of which makes it necessary to remove any obstacles that hinder the rapid coverage of the available jobs by allowing any person has knowledge of the job offers. It is therefore envisaged that the public employment services will register all the vacancies and applications for employment in the database of the Information System of the Public Services of Employment, as laid down in Law 56/2003 of 16 December 2003, of Employment, ensuring the dissemination of this information to all citizens, businesses and public administrations, as a guarantee of transparency and market unity.\n\nIn the same line of improvement of labor intermediation, a modification of the recast text of the Law on Public Sector Contracts, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 3/2011 of 14 November, is included in this law. allow the State Employment Public Service and the competent contracting authorities of the Autonomous Communities, and bodies and entities dependent on them and integrated in the National Employment System, to conclude jointly Framework agreements with a view to establishing the conditions for the adjustment of service contracts which are consider appropriate in order to provide employment services to public employment services.\n\nIII\n\nSeveral measures to promote business finance are articulated in Title II, which require their adoption as a matter of urgency in view of the current economic situation.\n\nAn amendment to the Regulation on the Management and Supervision of Private Insurance to collect the possibility that insurance institutions may invest in securities admitted to trading on the Alternative Market Securities, and that such investments are considered eligible for the coverage of technical provisions.\n\nOn the same line, the pension fund and plans regulation is amended to collect the possibility that pension funds can invest in securities admitted to trading on the Alternative Stock Market as well as in venture capital institutions, setting a specific ceiling of 3% of the fund's asset for investment in each institution.\n\nFinally, in order to facilitate access to the non-bank financing of Spanish companies, it is necessary to lift the limitation imposed by Article 405 of the Capital Companies Act, whereby the total amount of the Companies ' emissions cannot be higher than the paid-up share capital, plus reserves. The amendment raises this limitation for investment in multilateral trading systems (in line with what is already produced with regulated markets). This flexibility will only apply in cases where emissions are directed at institutional investors to ensure adequate protection for retail investors. In this way, the development of alternative markets, articulated as multilateral trading systems, is made a substantial contribution and, in line with the ongoing projects to improve the financing of Spanish SMEs, it is facilitated the emergence of markets specialised in the trading of debt of companies.\n\nIV\n\nIn order to alleviate the difficult economic situation that some local entities and some autonomous communities are experiencing, the government approved last year the Royal Decree-Law 4/2012, of 24 February, for which they are determined the information and procedures required to establish a financing mechanism for the payment to the suppliers of the local authorities, and which was subsequently extended to the autonomous communities by means of an agreement of the Fiscal and Financial Policy Council of 6 March 2012. In addition, a Fund for Financing of Payments to Suppliers was established, through Royal Decree-Law 7/2012 of 9 March.\n\nThe aforementioned regulations established an extraordinary financing mechanism for the payment and cancellation of debts contracted with the providers of local entities and autonomous communities, which allowed the payment of debts that They had with the contractors, at the same time as it was easier for the public administrations in debt to formalize long-term loans, but with the requirement of a fiscal and financial conditionality that was concrete, among others elements, in the requirement to have adjustment plans.\n\nBy means of the provisions contained in Chapter I of Title III of this Law, a new phase of the said mechanism is established at the same time as its subjective and objective scope of application is extended and established some of the procedures required for this new phase.\n\nIn this way, the municipalities of municipalities and local entities that are located in the Basque Country and Navarre are included.\n\nWith respect to the objective scope of application, the outstanding obligations arising from: conventions, administrative concessions, management fees in which the entrusted entity is assigned are included, among others. the condition of own resources and technical service of the Administration, of the lease on immovable property, of the contracts provided for in Law 31/2007 of 30 October on procurement procedures in the water sectors, the energy, transport and postal services, of the concession contracts of the public works, collaboration between the public sector and the private sector and public service management contracts, in the form of concession, in which a grant from local authorities or communities has been agreed standalone.\n\nOn the other hand, this extension may include only those outstanding obligations to contractors that are accounted for and applied to the budgets.\n\nSection 1. of general provisions regulates the subject matter of the first chapter which is concrete in the extension of the subjective and objective areas of the financing mechanism for payment to suppliers, as well as the establishment of the required specialties.\n\nSection 2 on provisions applicable to local authorities regulates the subjective and objective scope of application, in accordance with the above criteria, and sets out the specialties relating to the procedure for the provision of information, with particular attention to the municipalities of municipalities, and the adjustment plans.\n\nSection 3 of the provisions applicable to the Autonomous Communities lays down the subjective and objective scope of application, the procedural specialties relating to the provision of information and the payment of invoices. necessary revision of the adjustment plans in accordance with the new concerted credit operations, as well as the way in which the outstanding debt obligations that have been affected will be cancelled.\n\nOn the other hand, the payment of contractual debts between companies, as well as between them and public administrations, and the payment deadlines are the subject of particular attention both in the European Union and in the our country. The reason for this concern is due to the negative effects that both late payment and excessively long payment periods have on employment, competitiveness and the very survival of businesses.\n\nThe fruit of the above was the adoption of Directive 2000 /35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 laying down measures to combat late payment in commercial transactions, which Spain transplaced our legal order through Law 3/2004, of December 29.\n\nWhile the European Union was beginning the revision of Directive 2000 /35/EC, Spain also addressed the amendment of our law, which was embodied in Law 15/2010 of 5 July, amending Law 3/2004, 29 of\n\nCommission also took the view that the Commission was not in a position to act.\n\nIn this way, a number of measures were anticipated which were subsequently included in Directive 2011 /7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down measures to combat late payment in the commercial operations, which came to replace the previous Directive of the year 2000. This has happened with payment deadlines, including those in the public sector.\n\nAlthough the Spanish right after the proposed amendment complies, in general terms, with the new requirements of the European Union, there are certain aspects in which there is some divergence that makes the reform of the Law 3/2004 of 29 December, which is carried out in the second chapter of Title III of this Law.\n\nAmong the changes that are now being made, in the first place, is the determination of payment deadlines, which is the subject of simplification. Both the payment periods and the calculation of the payment periods are required, with the novelty of the provision of the acceptance or verification procedure, which must be regulated to prevent their use in order to delay the payment.\n\nThe forecast for payment calendars is incorporated and interest will be calculated if any of the payments will not be paid on the agreed date.\n\nThe legal rate of interest for late payment that the debtor will be obliged to pay is also reformed, which goes from seven to eight percentage points to add to the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank to its most recent main funding operation.\n\nIn the compensation for recovery costs, it is anticipated that a fixed amount of EUR 40, without the need for a prior request, will be paid to the creditor, which will be added to the one resulting from the claim that follows: by the costs incurred in order to recover the amount due. In addition, the previous limit of this compensation, which could not exceed 15% of the main debt, disappears. This allowance may include, among other things, the costs incurred by the defaulting creditor for the hiring of a lawyer or a recovery management agency.\n\nAnother novelty is precisely the inclusion of the unfair terms and, therefore, the provisions of Law 7/1998 of 13 April on general conditions of employment, which exclude compensation for recovery costs, which shall be contrary to the law, unless the debtor demonstrates that such exclusion is not abusive. And along with those clauses the foresight that the violation of this law will occur through commercial practices, which also receive the rating of abusive and will have the same regime of impeachment.\n\nV\n\nThe current economic situation poses the need to intensify the rationalisation measures of the railway sector in order to achieve maximum efficiency in the management of services and to promote the processes of liberalisation already started.\n\nIn order to achieve the aforementioned purposes, as well as to unify the management of the state railway infrastructures, it is considered necessary to transfer to the business public entity Administrator of Railway Infrastructures (ADIF) the State-owned railway network. In this way, the railway infrastructure and stations that constitute the network of ownership of the State whose ADIF administration is entrusted, will become of ownership of this, with which the ownership of the functions of network administration for the benefit of effectiveness.\n\nOn the other hand, the Royal Decree-Law 22/2012 of 20 July, adopting measures in the field of infrastructure and railway services, provides for the restructuring of RENFE-Operadora in four commercial companies that assume the different tasks assigned to them, including the carriage of passengers and goods. In order for them to operate, according to the Law of the Railway Sector, at the moment they are actually constituted, it is necessary that they have the corresponding license of railway company, safety certificate and that they are assigned the required infrastructure capacity.\n\nCertain amendments are also introduced in Law 39/2003 of 17 November of the Railway Sector. First, it is appropriate to comply with judgment 245/2012 of 18 December 2012 of the Constitutional Court in respect of the determination of the Railway Network of General Interest. The forecast of the next establishment of a catalogue of the lines and sections of the Network of General Interest to be approved by the Ministry of Public Works of the Autonomous Communities for whose territory shall run the network. As a transitional measure, as long as the establishment of the catalogue of lines and sections of the General Interest Rail Network does not occur, it shall be deemed to be composed of the lines and sections related to this law.\n\nAlso amended Law 39/2003 of 17 November of the Railway Sector, in relation to the progressive opening to the free competition of the rail passenger transport, within the scope of competences corresponding to the State on such transport, in accordance with the provisions of Article 149.1.21 of the Constitution. In this sense, it is considered transiently to establish a scheme of markets in which the access for the new operators will be carried out through the obtaining of the enabling titles. The Council of Ministers shall determine the number of securities to be awarded for each line or set of lines in which the service is to be provided and the granting of the enabling securities shall be carried out by the Council. Ministry of Public Works through the corresponding tender procedure.\n\nHowever, passenger transport services for primarily tourist purposes (which include \"tourist trains\"), which are not defined in the Law of the Rail Sector and currently provided by RENFE-Operadora (and As a result of this, it is not necessary to provide services for mobility, but they are leisure services where there are no circumstances in which transitional periods may be required in the process of liberalisation.\n\nVI\n\nGiven the current economic recession scenario and taking into account the evolution of the petroleum product prices, it is considered justified on grounds of national interest to ensure the stability of the prices of petroleum products. automotive fuels and to adopt direct measures of immediate impact on fuel prices, while allowing for a more efficient operation of this market.\n\nThe higher level of pre-tax prices of fuels in Spain with respect to Europe is consistently noted in the various monitoring reports issued by the National Energy Commission.\n\nIn addition, the National Competition Commission concludes in the various reports issued that, on the basis of a comparison of fuel prices in several countries in Europe, the behaviour of prices and margins Fuel distribution market in Spain shows signs of reduced effective competition.\n\nIn this regard, a number of measures are taken in both the wholesale and retail markets, which will allow effective competition in the sector to be increased, reducing barriers to entry to new entrants and impacting on positively on the welfare of citizens.\n\nThese measures are implemented through the timely modification of Law 34/1998, of 7 October, of the hydrocarbon sector, which establishes the basic sector framework, in particular the supply of liquid and oil hydrocarbons. Royal Decree-Law 6/2000 of 23 June of Urgent Measures to Intensify Competition in Goods and Services Markets.\n\nAt the wholesale level, it is considered necessary to ensure that the efficiency of the hydrocarbon logistics allows the distribution costs to be as low as possible. For this reason, Articles 41, 43 and 109 of Law 34/1998 of 7 October 1998 are amended and the system of supervision of logistics and storage facilities which have an obligation to access third parties under conditions is deepened. transparent, objective and non-discriminatory, which will enable public administrations to properly follow the activity developed by these companies and their impact on competition in the market.\n\nAt the retail level of the sector, measures are proposed to remove administrative barriers, simplify procedures for the opening of new fuel retail facilities and measures to encourage the entry of new operators.\n\nIt facilitates the opening of service stations in commercial centers, commercial parks, technical inspection establishments of vehicles and industrial zones or polygons, deepening in the objectives set by the Royal Decree-law 6/2000 of 23 June.\n\nIn addition to the difficulties for the establishment of new service stations, the existence of exclusive retail supply contracts is considered one of the main barriers to entry and expansion of the operators in Spain alternative to the main operators. The contractual restrictions currently appearing in exclusive contracts limit competition in the sector, which is detrimental to consumers. In order to alleviate this effect, a new Article 43a is added to Law 34/1998 of 7 October to establish stricter conditions for the subscription of exclusive supply contracts and to prohibit the recommendations of the sale price to the public. The aim is to avoid economic management regimes for service stations with exclusive contracts where the retail distributor acts as a fixed discount reseller or as a commission. In these schemes, the recommended price or the maximum price are fundamental parameters in the establishment of the purchase price of the product, encouraging price alignment between standard service stations, thereby reducing the price of the product. intra-brand competition.\n\nLikewise, and on a transitional basis, the growth in number of sales facilities for petroleum products is limited to the main operators in each province.\n\nRoyal Decree 459/2011 of 1 April, setting the mandatory targets for biofuels for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, sets annual targets for the consumption and sale of biofuels, both global and per year. product in that period. In order to achieve these ambitious objectives, the subjects are obliged to use significant quantities of biodiesel, as well as alternative products such as hydrobiodiesel, whose energy content is computable for the fulfilment of the (a) the above mentioned objectives and the advantage that, being a practically undifferentiated product of diesel, it meets the technical specifications in force at high mixing rates. However, these are more expensive products than the fossil fuel, which has a significant impact on the final price of diesel.\n\nIn the current economic and fuel price scenario, it is considered appropriate to revise the objectives of 2013, establishing objectives that will allow the price of fuels to be minimised and to ensure some stability to the (a) the use of biofuels, without any commitment to the achievement of the Community's objectives for 2020. The targets for the consumption and sale of biofuels, both global, and products, are also set for the coming years.\n\nWith this same objective, a period of absence is established in such a way that compliance with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 4 of Royal Decree 1597/2011 of 4 November 2011 will not be required. However, the subjects shall submit truthful information in this respect and apply the expected mass balance system in a correct manner.\n\nVII\n\nThis law is completed with nine additional provisions, six transitional provisions, one repeal and fifteen endings.\n\nThe additional provision first provides that the allowances and quota reductions provided for in this Act shall be financed from the corresponding budget item of the State Employment Public Service and shall be shall be supported by the Social Security revenue budget, respectively. It also establishes the actions to be carried out by the State Employment Public Service and by the General Treasury of Social Security in relation to the control of the reductions and bonuses practiced.\n\nThe second additional provision provides for the creation of an Inter-Ministerial Commission, whose composition and functions will be determined by regulation, for the monitoring and evaluation of the Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment Strategy, and the additional third provision entrusts the Ministry of Employment and Social Security to articulate the procedure for accession to the Strategy and establishes the obligation of the Department to report regularly on the companies attached and the initiatives raised.\n\nIn addition, the fourth additional provision determines the 12-month period for the adaptation of the distribution contracts to the conditions laid down in the new Article 43a.\n\nThe fifth additional provision provides for the possibility for a temporary work company and a user to enter into making contracts.\n\nIn the sixth additional provision the tax base of the betting on sports or competition events and the bingo in the Cities with Statute of Autonomy of Ceuta and Melilla is modified. And in the seventh additional provision, Article 9 of Law 8/1991 of 25 March, which approves the tax on production, services and imports in the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, is amended.\n\nThe transitional provision first provides that the measures and incentives referred to in Articles 9 to 13 of the Act shall remain in force until the unemployment rate is below 15%.\n\nThe second transitional provision, in respect of contracts of employment and pre-existing bonuses and reductions, specifies that they will continue to be governed by the rules in force at the time of their conclusion or the start of their enjoyment.\n\nThe third transitional provision refers to pre-existing contracts for late payment.\n\nThe fourth transitional provision refers to licenses that are requested for new supply facilities, which already have a municipal license for their operation. The fifth transitional provision determines that, in order to complete the new legal system introduced in Article 43.2, the wholesale operators of petroleum products with a market share of more than 30% will not be able to subscribe new exclusive distribution contracts with retail distributors engaged in the operation of the installation for the supply of fuels and fuels to vehicles, irrespective of who holds the actual right or right on the same. The sixth transitional provision provides for the beginning of the effects of changes in the field of equal treatment between women and men.\n\nThe derogating provision repeals the first transitional provision of Royal Decree-Law 6/2000 of 23 June of Urgent Measures for the Intensification of Competition in Goods and Services Markets, as a result of the provisions of the provisions of the in this law.\n\nWith respect to the final provisions, it stands out, first of all, the extra character of the Royal Decree-Law 4/2012, of 24 February, and 7/2012, of March 9.\n\nThe second final provision amends the recast text of the Law of the Workers ' Statute, approved by the Royal Legislative Decree 1/1995, of March 24, to delete the last paragraph of article 11.1.c). The third, fourth and fifth final provisions amend Law 14/1994 of 1 June on the regulation of temporary employment undertakings, Article 3 of Law 3/2012 of 6 July, of urgent measures for the reform of the labour market, and Royal Decree 1529/2012 of 8 November for the development of the contract for training and learning and establishing the basis for dual vocational training, respectively, in order to authorise temporary work enterprises to conclude contracts for training and learning with workers to be made available to them user companies.\n\nThe seventh final provision amends various precepts of the recast text of the Public Sector Contracts Act. The amendments made to Articles 216 and 222 seek to specify the time for the payment of the interest on late payments provided for in the Directive laying down measures to combat late payment in commercial transactions. a function of the various cases of receipt and processing of invoices, in a manner consistent with the regulation of Directive 2011 /7/EU of 16 February 2011. The amendment of the additional provision of the Law on Public Sector Contracts is excluded from the general regulation of the uses of electronic, computer and telematic means, the electronic invoices issued in the procurement procedures. To the extent that the invoice is an element associated with the performance of the contract, it is not covered by the provisions of Directive 2004 /18/EC on the use of electronic means in procurement procedures, and it seems appropriate. In the light of the fact that it has an effect on tax, banking, etc., it will provide for autonomous regulation. In the new 33rd additional provision, a new route for the submission of invoices to the administrative body with powers in the field of public accounting is articulated, in order to ensure that the administration has a exact knowledge of all the debts incurred by the performance of the contracts.\n\nThe ninth final provision amends Royal Decree-Law 7/2012 of 9 March establishing the Fund for the financing of payments to suppliers and provides that the ICO shall be responsible for the administration and administration of the funds. operations that are designed with the FFPP.\n\nThe 10th final provision amends the Royal Decree-Law 21/2012 of 13 July 2012 of liquidity measures of public administrations and in the financial field, providing that the fulfilment of the obligations arising from the Debt transactions with multilateral financial institutions, as well as those provided for in the adjustment plans, cannot be affected by the possible retentions of the resources of the financing system of the communities. standalone.\n\nThe final provision of the 13th amendment amends the Organic Law 3/2007 of 22 March for the effective equality of women and men; and the final provision fourteenth the recast text of the law of ordination and supervision of the private insurance.\n\nTITLE I\n\nDevelopment measures of the Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment Strategy\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nPromoting entrepreneurship and self-employment\n\nArticle 1.
