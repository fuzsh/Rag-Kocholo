        "text": "To find your train, locate your train number and the departure time on the departures board. There will be a track (\"Voie\") number next to the train and departure time. Follow signs to that track to board the train. You will have a reserved seat on TGV trains. On other long-distance trains, you can make reservations (at least one day in advance); if you do not have one you may use any unused seat not marked as reserved. To find your reserved seat, first look for the train coach number (\"Voit. No\"). Pay attention to the possible confusion between track number (\"voie\") and coach (\"voiture\", abbreviated \"voit\") number. As you go down the track, the coach number will be displayed on an LCD screen on the car, or maybe just written in the window or right next to the doors. Within Paris, on the RER and Transilien networks, four-letter codes (such as COHI, FACA, QYAN, VICK) are generally used in place of train numbers.\n\nThe reserved-seat rules are lax; you are allowed to switch seats or use another seat (of the same class, of course) if it is empty because the TGV is not fully booked or the other person agrees to switch with you. The only requirement is not to continue using a reserved seat if the person holding the reservation claims it.\n\nOn the main lines, TGVs often run in two. There are two possibilities: either the two TGVs are considered as one train with one train number (in this case each coach has a different number); or the two TGVs are considered as separate trains which run together during a part of their journey, with two different train numbers (in this case, the two trains may have two close numbers such as 1527 and 1537), and each train will have its own coach numbering. So be sure you are in the right train (the train number is shown on the LCD screen, with the coach number).\n\nIf you are early, there is often a map somewhere on the platform (displayed either on LCD screens, or on older LED panels marked \"Composition des trains\") that will show how the train and car numbers will line up on the platform according to letters that appear either on the ground or on signs above. That way, you can stand by the letter corresponding with your coach number and wait in order to board the train closest to your coach. You can easily go from one coach to another, so if you are very late, jump in any coach of the same class before the train starts, wait until most people are seated, then walk to your coach and seat number.\n\nBeware: To avoid any form of fraud, paper tickets must be punched (composté) by an automatic machine (composteur) to be valid. Older machines are bright orange, newer machines are yellow and gray. The machines are situated at the entrance of all platforms, but there is no barrier preventing you from entering the platform or boarding the train without stamping your ticket; the onus is on you, the passenger, to remember to do so. There is a knack to using the composteur, and it can take several attempts if you don't know what you're doing: insert the ticket face up, left end (with the SNCF logo on it) first, into the slit of the machine, as far to the left of the slit as you can. If the validation is successful, you will hear a buzz that's a bit like the sound of paper being torn, and see a small light on the machine flash green. The ticket won't look any different after validation.\n\nFailure to punch the ticket may entitle you to a fine even if you are a foreigner with a limited French vocabulary, depending on how the conductor feels, unless you approach the conductor as quickly as possible and request that your ticket be validated. Likewise if you step aboard a train without a ticket, you must find the conductor (\"contrôleur\") and tell him about your situation before he finds you. However, printouts of e-Billet electronic tickets do not have to be punched: in doubt, punch it anyway, you won't be fined for punching an e-Billet.\n\nFrench information booths, especially in larger train stations, can be quite unhelpful, especially if you do not understand much French. If something does not seem to make sense, just say \"excusez-moi\" and they should repeat it."
