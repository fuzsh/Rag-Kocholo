        "text": "Something appears to be going on with the highspeed tracks the 30th and 31st or all the trains are completely sold out, or.... I checked all along the route, from Paris to Barcelona, Montpellier to Barcelona, nada.\n\nI looked on SNCF Connect, Renfe, and Trainline. Trainline will sell you a ticket on a local train. I've taken it before, a commuter train. It will be crowded and no reserved seats, but you'll get there. Everyone will be taking the local trains those two days.\n\nYes, there's a bus. Trainline will sell you a ticket. Also, check rome2rio.com https://www.rome2rio.com for companies.\n\nCan you go on Saturday night instead if you can get a hotel reservation? Barcelona hotels can fill on Saturdays.\n\nThe agreement between SNCF and Renfe to manage the train lines between France and Spain will end in December 2022.\n\nAccording to the press there are many disagreements between SNCF on the French side and Renfe on the Spanish side.\n\nSome say that the Elipsos company, which was created to manage these France-Spain lines, prevented booking portions of the route that were too short even if there are free seats, in order to favor long journeys like a Paris Barcelona. The reason would be that Elipsos wants to compete with the airlines.\n\nThere are also problems on the TER line (which goes to Cerbère on the French side) some trains that could continue to Spain now stop at the border because Spain requires French drivers to speak Spanish to travel the 1/2 miles that takes travelers to the first Spanish station.\n\nPlan B could be the bus. See with Flixbus\n\nhttps://www.flixbus.com/bus/perpignan\n\nThe Perpignan-Barcelona journey takes 2h30 and costs around 25€\n\nEach company will run its own trains and Trenitalia will begin that route, too. But that's not the problem for October 30th. Perhaps there's an announced labor dispute, but even then trains aren't cancelled until the day before.\n\nI checked all the way from Paris to Barcelona to see if that route was running at all. It's not bookable on any website on any part of the route but only the 30th and 31st.\n\nWe have always had to change trains at Port Bou due to track differences. Is this language issue in addition?\n\nAnd wouldn't most everyone speak Catalan anyway?\n\nIt would seem (at least that's what I read) that some trains now stop at Cerbère, forcing travelers who are on their own to walk to Port Bou to catch a Spanish train.\n\nAmong the 13,500 SNCF train drivers, there must be a maximum of 3% who speak Spanish and 3 or 4 drivers who speak Catalan! :))\n\n(a completely personal estimate that only engages me)\n\nLOL. So what do you think is going on with that train on the 30th and 31st, JoLui? I have to go to the station for something else tomorrow, so I'll ask.\n\nYes, OP the bus is your best bet, if still available, or go on the 29th.\n\nGoing to the SNCF Connect website there are no direct trains, and all other indirect trains (not bookable) take 4 hours to make the journey.\n\nIn addition there is this message:\n\nDue to work at a level crossing, the TGV INOUI to/from Perpignan will exceptionally depart from or arrive in Montpellier from Saturday 29 October at 11.40 p.m. to Monday 31 October at 11.40 p.m.\n\nThe bus makes the same trip in 2h25 and there are 9 a day...\n\nThe bus seems like a good plan B to me that could easily become a pretty good plan A\n\nPersonally when I go to Barcelona it's by car, but sorry for the OP, the 30th and 31st I'm not free, I'll be in Brittany eating crêpes and seafood......\n\nBets & JoLui,\n\nTHANK YOU!! I knew there had to be something going on with the train system when I couldn't find a train. We are flexible with this part of our trip. I will see what trains are available for Oct. 29th and if I can get another night at our hotel in Barcelona. Worse case we take the BUS into Barcelona Thank you both for clearing things up.\n\nBets and JoLui, can either of you recommend a drive service to take us from Perpignan to Barcelona? I have checked out Mydaytrip.com and GetTransfer.com companies. Do you have any suggestions for a good and safe company to use. We like the option of stopping and sight seeing along the way. Again thank you for the candid advice."
