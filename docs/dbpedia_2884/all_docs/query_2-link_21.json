        "text": "The quickest route: Paris to Barcelona by TGV\n\nAt the moment, the Paris - Barcelona high-speed route is served by a measly two TGV trains daily, run by the French railway operator SNCF.\n\nTrains leave from the Gare de Lyon station in Paris as follows:\n\nMorning train (journey time 6h 52min)\n\nParis Gare de Lyon depart: 09:42\n\nBarcelona Sants arrive: 16:34\n\nAfternoon train (journey time 6h 29min)\n\nParis Gare de Lyon depart: 14:56\n\nBarcelona Sants arrive: 21:25\n\nIn the other direction, from Spain to France, trains leave as follows:\n\nMorning train (journey time 6h 45min)\n\nBarcelona Sants depart: 10:33\n\nParis Gare de Lyon arrive: 17:18\n\nAfternoon train (journey time 6h 46min)\n\nBarcelona Sants depart: 14:32\n\nParis Gare de Lyon arrive: 21:18\n\nThese TGV trains are reservation-only. Ticket prices vary depending on how early you book.\n\nInterrail passes are accepted, but you'll still need to make (and pay for) a reservation.\n\nThe Spanish rail operator RENFE plans to introduce its own high-speed AVE trains on the Paris - Barcelona route from 2024. If this happens it will introduce some welcome competition on a route where SNCF currently has a monopoly.\n\nThe Catalan-Pyrenees route: France to Spain via Latour de Carol Enveitg and Puigcerdà\n\nCombining two of the most scenic railways in France and Spain, this is one of our favourite rail routes, with an opportunity for a gentle (or not so gentle, depending on how adventurous you're feeling) bike ride to connect the two sections.\n\n(If it's getting late or the weather is lousy, you can also make this a train-only connection, linking Paris to Barcelona with a single change of trains at Latour de Carol Enveitg. (Let's just call it Latour de Carol from here on, Latour de Carol Enveitg is a bit of a mouthful for a a station serving a tiny Pyrenean village, no matter its importance in the history of European railways.)\n\nIn fact we love this route so much that we've written a dedicated page with all the details.\n\nBut here's a quick summary.\n\nFrom Toulouse to Latour de Carol\n\nOn the French side, 5 trains daily climb from Toulouse-Matabiau station up into the Pyrenees, reaching Latour de Carol around 2h 45mins later. These are local \"TER\" services, so no seat reservations are required: just buy your ticket at the station and hop on.\n\nCurrent timings are as follows.\n\nd. Toulouse Matabiau 07:47, a. Latour de Carol 10:28\n\nd. Toulouse Matabiau 10:47, a. Latour de Carol 13:29\n\nd. Toulouse Matabiau 13:47, a. Latour de Carol 16:35\n\nd. Toulouse Matabiau 15:47, a. Latour de Carol 18:36\n\nd. Toulouse Matabiau 17:47, a. Latour de Carol 20:32\n\nFrom Latour de Carol to Barcelona\n\nOn the Spanish side, 5 local \"Rodalies de Catalunya\" trains make the journey down from Latour de Carol to Barcelona Sants (the main railway station in Barcelona).\n\nCurrent timings are as follows:\n\nd. Latour de Carol 08:25, a. Barcelona Sants 11:45\n\nd. Latour de Carol 10:25, a. Barcelona Sants 13:45\n\nd. Latour de Carol 13:25, a. Barcelona Sants 16:45\n\nd. Latour de Carol 16:25, a. Barcelona Sants 19:45\n\nd. Latour de Carol 18:25, a. Barcelona Sants 22:45\n\n(Note: these local trains don't show up on the main European or even Spanish Renfre timetables. They're hidden away on the Rodalies de Catalunya website. And to find \"Latour de Carol\", you'll need to search for the Catalan version of its name, \"La Tor de Querol-Enveig\".)\n\nYou'll notice that these two sets of timings couldn't be worse coordinated. It's almost as if the two railway companies in question (SNCF on the French side and RENFE on the Spanish side) don't like each other.\n\nThe early-morning train from Toulouse arrives at Latour de Carol at 10:28, just missing the 10:25 departure for Barcelona. So you have to wait three hours.\n\nThe mid-morning train from Toulouse arrives at Latour de Carol at 13:29, just missing the 13:25 departure for Barcelona. So you have to wait three hours.\n\nThe early-afternoon train from Toulouse arrives at Latour de Carol at 16:35, just missing the 16:25 departure for Barcelona. So you have to wait two hours.\n\nThe late-afternoon train from Toulouse arrives at Latour de Carol at 18:36, just missing the final departure of the day for Barcelona at 18:25. So you have to stay overnight.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, you will have at least a couple of hours to kill between arriving in Latour de Carol, and departing for Barcelona.\n\nFortunately, this is no bad thing, because there's enough to explore in Latour de Carol, and its sister-village on the Spanish side, Puigcerdà, to keep you entertained. See the Latour de Carol page for details.\n\nThe sleeper train option: overnight from Paris to Latour de Carol\n\nTwice a week, and more often in high season, a direct sleeper train leaves Paris around 22:00, arriving around 09:00 the next morning. It's a hard-to-beat way to arrive in the heart of the Pyrenees. If you're in a hurry, you can connect with the 10:25 train from Latour de Carol to Barcelona, arriving in the Catalan capital at 13:45, in time for a late lunch.\n\nIf you book well in advance, you can get 2nd-class couchettes on this Paris-to-the-Pyrenees train from as little as €29. While prices do rise towards €100 as the travel date approaches, even that is not bad value for a ticket all the way across France, with a bed for the night thrown in.\n\nFrom Portbou onwards to Girona, Blanes or Barcelona\n\nFrom Portbou, trains run roughly hourly (though on an irregular schedule — check latest timetables!) direct to Barcelona Sants, with the earliest train leaving Portbou at 07:05, and the last train leaving at 20:24.\n\nRegional (\"R\") trains take between 2 hours 30 mins and 3 hours to make the journey. The fare is €13.50, no advance booking necessary or possible. Buy your ticket from the machine or the ticket office in Portbou station, and remember to validate it at the little orange machine before boarding the train.\n\nA handful of so-called \"Medium-distance\" trains (\"MD\", for media distancia) run the same route daily in slightly quicker time — 2 hours 16 minutes — and for a slightly higher fare (€18.10).\n\nAll Barcelona-bound trains call at Figueres and Girona en route.\n\nIf you're heading to Blanes or one of the coastal towns between Blanes and Barcelona, you'll normally have to change at Maçanet-Massanes."
