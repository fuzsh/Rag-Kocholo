        "text": "History\n\nThe first railway line in the Iberian Peninsula was built in 1848 between Barcelona and MatarÃ³.[4] In 1851 the Madrid-Aranjuez line was opened. In 1852 the first narrow gauge line was built; in 1863 a line reached the Portuguese border. By 1864 the Madrid-Irun line had been opened, and the French border reached.[4]\n\nIn 1900 the first line to be electrified was La Poveda-Madrid.[5]\n\nIn 1941 RENFE was created.[4]\n\nThe last steam locomotive was withdrawn in 1975, in 1986 the maximum speed on the railways was raised to 160 km/h, and in 1992 the Madrid-Seville high-speed line opened,[4] beginning the process of building a nationwide high-speed network known as AVE (Alta Velocidad EspaÃ±a).\n\nThe current plans of the Spanish government are to finish the standard-gauge high-speed network by building new sections of track and upgrading and converting to standard gauge the existing line along the Mediterranean coast connecting the ports of Barcelona, Tarragona, Valencia, Cartagena and AlmerÃ­a, and to link Madrid with Vigo, Santiago and A CoruÃ±a in Galicia, and to extend the Madrid-Valladolid line to Burgos and the Basque cities of Bilbao and San Sebastian and Hendaye on the French border, as well as to link Madrid with Lisbon and the port of Sines through Badajoz. Former plans by the Popular Party government under PM Aznar to link all provincial capitals with high-speed rail have been shelved as unrealistic, unaffordable, and contrary to all economic logic as no European funding would be made available for such projects.\n\nFollowing the opening of the AVE network, the classic Iberian gauge railways have lost importance in inter-city travel, for example, the MadridâBarcelona railway takes over nine hours to travel between the two cities stopping at every station. With the MadridâBarcelona high-speed rail line, the longest possible journey is just three hours.[6] This has allowed the conventional lines to increase focus on regional and commuter traffic, along with freight. Some lines, including the CÃ³rdoba-Bobadilla section of the classic CÃ³rdobaâMÃ¡laga railway, have lost passenger traffic completely due to the opening of AVE serving the same destinations.\n\nMany important mainland Spanish towns remain disconnected to the rail network, the largest being Marbella with a population of over 140,000, along with Roquetas de Mar (pop. 96,800), El Ejido (pop. 84,000), Chiclana de la Frontera (pop. 83,000) and Torrevieja (pop. 82,000). Other towns and municipalities are not on the national rail network but linked to light rail or metro systems, such as Santa Coloma de Gramanet, Barcelona (pop. 118,000); Getxo, Biscay (pop. 80,000); Torrent, Valencia (pop. 79,000); and Benidorm, Alicante (pop. 69,000)."
