        "text": "Barcelona commuter rail service\n\nedit\n\nRodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona commuter rail service consists of eight lines serving a large part of the Barcelona metropolitan area, even extending out of its limits in some cases. Excluding the Vic–Latour-de-Carol portion, it runs on 467 kilometres (290 mi) of railway lines and has 109 stations in 77 municipalities, accounting for a population of 4.7 million. It is calculated that the service has a daily ridership of 350,000 travelers and,[10] according to 2016 figures, an annual ridership of 108.3 million.[1]\n\nAll lines (except line R8) are centred in the city of Barcelona, where they run on two underground trunk routes. Lines R3 and R4, and partly lines R1 and R7, use the Meridiana Tunnel, comprising Plaça de Catalunya, Arc de Triomf, La Sagrera-Meridiana and Sant Andreu Arenal stations. Lines R2, R2 Nord and, partially, R2 Sud use the Aragó Tunnel, comprising Passeig de Gràcia and El Clot-Aragó stations. Both trunk routes converge at Barcelona Sants railway station, the service's main station.[13]\n\nRenfe created the Cercanías Barcelona/Rodalia Barcelona branding in 1979 with the aim of absorbing the traffic of passengers who enter and leave the Catalan capital every day. The system became one of the crown jewels of Renfe, however, the reality was that the network was in very poor condition and required modernisation. In 1984 Renfe was in a critical economic situation due to the high number of deficient lines, which is why it decided to close many of them, part of which were saved by the Autonomous Communities. There was a modernisation of facilities, especially in stations, to adapt to new needs. In 1989–1991 Renfe created separate business units, due to the deep reorganisation of the rail service at the state level and divided the operation into commuter trains, medium distances and long distances. In 1992 there were many works and transformations, one of the most relevant, the removal of the track between Estació de França and Sant Adrià de Besòs along the Barcelona seafront, and the diversion of Line R1 through La Sagrera and the purchase of rolling stock specially designed for commuter services. It can be considered that in 1992 the network is consolidated in the way we know it today.\n\nThe current system is the successor of former Renfe Operadora's Cercanías commuter rail system for Barcelona known as Rodalia Barcelona, and it has kept most of its features. Nevertheless, while all the other Cercanías systems around Spain use letter 'C' (from the Spanish word cercanías) plus a number for identifying their lines, Barcelona's commuter rail system uses letter 'R' instead (from its Catalan equivalent rodalia). As for the numbering, since Rodalies de Catalunya shares market with Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) on the city's commuter rail, it can only use numbers from 1 to 10 leaving numbers 5 and 6 for FGC lines.[14]\n\nSince 22 July 2006 ( ), a line named R10 has been running between Barcelona–El Prat Airport and Barcelona's Estació de França.[15] However, due to construction works near Barcelona Sant Andreu Comtal railway station, a \"temporary\" restructuring of lines R2 and R10 was implemented on 31 January 2009 ( ); the R10 was suspended and the R2 was divided into three different lines—R2, R2 Nord (\"North\") and R2 Sud (\"South\"). The R10 was initially scheduled to resume services two years later.[16]\n\nOn 26 June 2011 ( ), a restructuring of the service affecting several lines was implemented. It mainly involved the creation of new line R8, the first line ever bypassing Barcelona, and the rerouting of line R7. Before the restructuring, former line R7 ran from L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to Martorell via the Meridiana Tunnel in Barcelona's city centre and Rubí. With the rerouting, it was shortened and started to run as a shuttle line between Cerdanyola Universitat and Barcelona Sant Andreu Arenal stations. New line R8 took over the former route of line R7 between Martorell and Cerdanyola Universitat, then continuing towards Granollers Centre. Thanks to the changes applied on lines R7 and R8, it was able to increase frequencies with a train every 6 minutes and 8 minutes during rush hour on lines R1 and R4, respectively.[17][18]\n\nTypically, most trains call at all the stations on the line. Nevertheless, some trains on lines R2 Sud, R3 and R4 operate limited service and only call at certain stations. Furthermore, most trains on all lines, excepting lines R2, R7 and R8, operate partial services, being line R1 exclusively operated with partial services.\n\n† Suspended line\n\nRodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona commuter rail service lines (as of 26 June 2011 ) Line Route No. of\n\nstations Length Avg. weekday ridership Annual ridership Schedule R1 Molins de Rei – L'Hospitalet de Llobregat – Mataró/Arenys de Mar – Calella – Blanes – Maçanet-Massanes 31 95.1 km[19]\n\n59.1 mi 102,214\n\n(2008)[19] 28 million\n\n(2016)[1] [1][permanent dead link] R2 Castelldefels – Granollers Centre 14 133 km[20]\n\n82.6 mi 125,948\n\n(2008)[21] 33.6 million\n\n(2016)[1] [2] R2 Nord Barcelona–El Prat Airport – Sant Celoni/Maçanet-Massanes 21 R2 Sud Sant Vicenç de Calders – Vilanova i la Geltrú – Barcelona Estació de França 17 R3 L'Hospitalet de Llobregat – Granollers-Canovelles/La Garriga – Vic – Ripoll/Ribes de Freser – Puigcerdà/Latour-de-Carol-Enveitg[a] 35 161.4 km[23]\n\n100.3 mi 22,841\n\n(2008)[23] 6.6 million\n\n(2008)[23] [3][permanent dead link] R4 Sant Vicenç de Calders – Vilafranca del Penedès – Martorell/L'Hospitalet de Llobregat – Terrassa – Manresa 40 143 km[24]\n\n89 mi 105,935\n\n(2008)[24] 33.4 million\n\n(2016)[1] [4] R7 (Martorell –)[b] Barcelona Sant Andreu Arenal – Cerdanyola Universitat 7 13.5 km[25]\n\n8.4 mi 8,140\n\n(2010)[25] 1.9 million\n\n(2010)[25] [5][permanent dead link] R8 Martorell – Cerdanyola Universitat – Granollers Centre 8 40 km[26]\n\n25 mi ? ?

At the time it started services, it was the first commuter rail service in Catalonia not centered in Barcelona. The Camp de Tarragona commuter rail service consists of two lines, which are identified by letters 'RT' (the latter referring to Tarragona) plus a number, serving a total of 13 stations. Both lines converge at Tarragona railway station and are served by stopping trains only. Currently, it does not run on weekends.\n\nLine RT1 actually serves as a reinforcement for regional services between Tarragona and Reus with 9 additional trains in each direction, allowing a service pattern of approximately 30 minutes during rush hour and lower to one hour during off-peak time between the two cities, combining all lines.[28]\n\nOn the other hand, line RT2 provides a direct service between the Baix Penedès and the Costa Daurada areas. Before the creation of the line, the L'Arboç–L'Hospitalet de l'Infant route was not possible without interchanging at Sant Vicenç de Calders railway station.[6] Although line RT2 initially ran only between L'Arboç and Cambrils, from 20 June 2014 ( ) on, some trains travel further west to L'Hospitalet de l'Infant stopping at Mont-roig del Camp.[29]\n\nRodalies de Catalunya's Camp de Tarragona commuter rail service lines (as of 20 June 2014 ) Line Route Avg. weekday\n\nfrequency No. of\n\nstations Length Schedule RT1 Reus – Tarragona 18 trains per day 3 18.1 km[30]\n\n11.3 mi [7][permanent dead link] RT2 L'Hospitalet de l'Infant – Tarragona – Sant Vicenç de Calders – L'Arboç 10 trains per day 11 69.1 km[31]\n\n42.9 mi\n\nGirona commuter rail service\n\nedit\n\nThe Girona commuter rail service started services on 24 March 2014 ( ), four days after the Camp de Tarragona commuter rail service did so, becoming the second commuter rail service in Catalonia not centered in Barcelona. It consists of a single 44-station line named RG1 (letter 'G' referring to Girona), which directly links the Alt Empordà, Gironès, Selva and Maresme areas. Before the RG1 started services, its route was only possible by interchanging at Maçanet-Massanes railway station. In addition, the RG1 has improved the service pattern at stations in the Girona area.\n\nLine RG1 is actually an extension of some trains on Barcelona commuter rail service line R1 which formerly terminated at Maçanet-Massanes.[7] Due to this fact, line RG1's L'Hospitalet de Llobregat–Mataró section, despite not serving as a Girona-centered commuter rail line, but as a Barcelona-centered one, is included as part of the Girona commuter rail service.[32][33] At the beginning, the RG1 did not run on weekends and ran exclusively between L'Hospitalet de Llobregat and Figueres. However, from 20 June 2014 ( ) on, some trains travel further north towards Portbou and additional weekend services are offered during the summer season.[29]\n\nRodalies de Catalunya's Girona commuter rail service lines (as of 20 June 2014 ) Line Route Avg. weekday\n\nfrequency No. of\n\nstations Length Schedule RG1 L'Hospitalet de Llobregat – Mataró – Figueres – Portbou 16 trains per day 40 181.2 km[34]\n\n112.6 mi [8][permanent dead link]\n\nLleida commuter rail service\n\nedit\n\nThe Lleida commuter rail service started services on 16 March 2015 ( ), becoming the third commuter rail service in Catalonia not centered in Barcelona. It consists of five lines; two labelled RL1 and RL2 (letter 'L' referring to Lleida), which directly link Lleida with Balaguer and Àger areas, on the Lleida-La Pobla Line, operated by Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC), and parts of regional lines R12, R13 and R14 (see below), operated by Renfe Operadora, linking the city with Cervera and Vinaixa. The five lines in total have improved the service pattern at stations in the Lleida area.\n\nFerrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya's Lleida commuter rail service lines (as of 16 March 2015 ) Line Route Avg. weekday\n\nfrequency No. of\n\nstations Length Schedule RL1 Lleida Pirineus – Balaguer 6 trains per day 6 26.1 km\n\n16.3 mi [9] RL2 Lleida Pirineus – Balaguer - Àger - La Pobla de Segur 6 trains per day 17 89.4 km\n\n55.9 mi [10]\n\nFor the Renfe Operadora-operated lines, see below.\n\nRegional rail services\n\nedit\n\nRodalies de Catalunya's division for regional rail services consists of six lines centered in Barcelona that serve the whole of Catalonia and are sometimes extended towards the neighboring Spanish autonomous communities of Aragon and the Valencian Community as well as the French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. Although Estació de França serves as the main terminus station in Barcelona for most regional lines, especially those traveling towards southern and western Catalonia, all of them converge at Barcelona Sants only, which serves as the center of the service.[35] The 2013 annual ridership for the regional rail services was 9.267 million.[36]\n\nRegional services run on major corridors between Barcelona and other cities in Catalonia, excluding the Barcelona–Mataró and the Barcelona–Vilafranca del Penedès corridors, which are served by Barcelona commuter rail service lines R1 and R4, respectively. In addition, none of the regional services (excepting line R12) calls at all stations near Barcelona, which are already served by the city's commuter rail service. Yet, they usually stop at almost all the stations in Barcelona city centre.[35]\n\nThe system's division for regional services is the precursor of several Renfe Operadora's Media Distancia regional lines in Catalonia, which were identified using letters 'Ca' (from the Catalan or the Spanish language form of Catalonia, Catalunya and Cataluña, respectively) plus a number.[22] With the transfer of all regional services to the Catalan government, the lines happened to be identified with letter 'R' like the already transferred Barcelona commuter rail service lines. In order to differentiate the regional lines from those that are part of the Barcelona commuter rail service, the first ones use only numbers larger than 10—currently, numbers 11–16—,[37] leaving numbers 1–10 for Barcelona commuter rail service lines.\n\nRodalies de Catalunya's regional lines have kept the same operating scheme just like before they were transferred, similarly to all other Renfe Operadora's Media Distancia lines around Spain. Likewise, there exist different types of train services. Specifically, the following types of train services are present in the system's division for regional lines:\n\nRegional (R): These services usually call at all the stations on the line.[38]\n\nRegional Exprés (RE): In contrast to R services, RE services have fewer stops and are faster. They are, however, slightly more expensive than R services.[38]\n\nMedia Distancia/Mitjana Distància (MD): Similar to RE services referring to the number of stops and operating speed, though they are exclusively operated by Renfe series 449 trains, Renfe Operadora's newest rolling stock for regional lines, and are more expensive than RE trains. Currently, they run only on line R11.[38]"
