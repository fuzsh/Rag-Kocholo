It runs hourly between Martorell and Granollers across the Vallès Occidental region, spanning 40 kilometres (25 mi) and eight stations. The R8 primarily uses the Castellbisbal–Mollet-Sant Fost railway, as well as the Sant Vicenç de Calders–Vilafranca del Penedès–Barcelona and Barcelona–Cerbère railways on its southern and northern ends, respectively. It is currently the only line of the Barcelona commuter rail service entirely bypassing Barcelona. The trains operating on the line are Civia electrical multiple units (EMU).
