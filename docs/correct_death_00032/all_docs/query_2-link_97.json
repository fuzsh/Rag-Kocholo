        "text": "Former President Donald Trump, in the wake of an assassination attempt at a Saturday rally in Butler, Pa., is calling for independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to receive Secret Service protection.\n\nThe Secret Service via its website it provides protection to “major” presidential candidates and their spouses in the lead-up to a presidential election. The secretary of homeland security is responsible for determining which individuals qualify under such a rule.\n\nKennedy via X in 2023 he had requested Secret Service protection, but was denied due to it being “not warranted.”\n\nSince the assassination of my father in 1968, candidates for president are provided Secret Service protection,” Kennedy said. ”But not me.”\n\nAfter narrowly avoiding an assassination attempt while in the presence of Secret Service agents, Trump on Monday said Kennedy deserves similar protections.\n\nIn light of what is going on in the world today, I believe it is imperative that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receive Secret Service protection — immediately,” he via Truth Social. “Given the history of the Kennedy Family, this is the obvious right thing to do!”\n\nREAD MORE |\n\nKennedy has repeatedly received different treatment than Trump and President Joe Biden during the 2024 election cycle. The independent was not to join the two on stage during the first presidential debate, forcing him to host his own solo counter-programming that night. CNN said Kennedy failed to meet its eligibility criteria for the debate, citing polling and state ballot thresholds.\n\nThe independent's campaign is also still fighting for ballot access in several states.\n\nKennedy on Saturday called for unity following the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\n“Now is the time for every American who loves our country to step back from the division, renounce all violence, and unite in prayer for President Trump and his family,” he via X.\n\nJackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news.
