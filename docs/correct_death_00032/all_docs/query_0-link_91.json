        "text": "Comedian John Belushi did cocaine with his Hollywood friends Robert De Niro and Robin Williams just hours before he suffered a fatal overdose in a private bungalow at the famed Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles three decades ago.\n\nThe details about the night Belushi died in March 1982 are among the stories included in Hollywood historian Shawn Levy's new book, 'The Castle on Sunset', about the iconic and scandalous hotel.\n\nIn excerpts of the book, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Levy details the tragic final days and hours of the comic's life.\n\nBelushi, an original Saturday Night Live cast member, had checked into his usual private bungalow at the hotel on February 28, 1982 - almost a week before he suffered the fatal overdose on March 5 at the age of 33.\n\nThe Animal House star was visited by Robert De Niro on the evening of March 4 1982 because he wanted to go partying - but De Niro left after being freaked out by the state of the suite.\n\nCocaine was piled on the living room table, there was dirty laundry everywhere and the place was littered with discarded pizza boxes and wine bottles.\n\nAccording to a new book the living room was a 'shambles - not sloppy, but actually trashed, as if in a rage'.\n\nDe Niro returned 3am to do some cocaine, as did Robin Williams but both left Belushi in the squalor of the $250 a night bungalow because the found the scene so disturbing.\n\n'The Castle on Sunset: Life, Death, Love, Art, and Scandal at Hollywood's Chateau' by Shawn Levy, which is out next month on Doubleday, says that at noon the next day Belushi was found unconscious by his bodyguard Bill Wallace.\n\nWallace called Belushi's manager Bernie Brillstein and screamed: 'There's something really wrong with John!'\n\nParamedics arrived but Belushi was already gone from an overdose, the book reveals.\n\nWhen De Niro head the news he called the hotel frantically demanding to know: 'Where's John?'\n\nGeneral manager Suzanne Jierjian told him: 'There's a problem'. De Niro said: 'What'. She replied: 'It's bad'. De Niro demanded: 'Is he sick' and was told: 'It's really bad'.\n\nLevy writes: 'De Niro suddenly understood. He dropped the phone, crying'.\n\nThe dramatic account puts new light on the tragic end of Belushi, who was one of the the greatest comedians of his generation but died at the age of 33.\n\nHis contemporaries and friends included Dan Aykroyd who was planning to include Belushi in Ghostbusters which would have made him a huge star.\n\nLevy writes that when Belushi checked into the Chateau Marmont in February 1982 he was a 'bomb, a waste site, a mess, sweaty, flabby, edgy, pale, disheveled'.\n\nIt had been four years since Animal House came out and his only modest success since then was The Blues Brothers.\n\nHe had well established alcohol, pot and cocaine problems and had begun to dabble in heroin, telling people it was research for a movie about the punk scene.\n\nWhen Aykroyd visited Belushi they staged a mock sword fight in the lobby lounge using 2ft candles as weapons, but as February rolled into March Belushi became more reclusive.\n\nLevy writes: 'He darted around erratically from nightclubs to people's homes to restaurants to guitar shops to his favorite bathhouse to assignations with drug dealers, sometimes abandoning limousines he hired and driving off with some new acquaintance.\n\n'When he was in the bungalow, he was often too addled to talk or answer the phone, or he was surrounded by clutches of sycophants and drug-world people and hangers-on and unable to have a serious conversation. He was a wreck, and he was spinning beyond the reach of anyone who could help him'.\n\nDe Niro had become good friends with Belushi as they were both from New York and the Raging Bull star had an upper floor penthouse at the Chateau Marmont.\n\nLevy writes that on one visit to Belushi with his young son and adolescent daughter he found Belushi 'snorting such quantities of cocaine and heroin that he had to excuse himself to go find a place to vomit'.\n\nNot that it put De Niro off as he was 'using cocaine himself in those days' writes Levy and they would run into each other at VIP rooms of various Sunset Strip clubs.\n\nAccording to Levy on March 4, Belushi's last night alive, De Niro and his friend the actor Harry Dean Stanton kept calling Belushi to try and get him to come out with them but he wouldn't pick up.\n\nAt that point they drove to his bungalow at the Chateau Marmont and found it in an 'awful state'.\n\nLevy describes how a 'flinty, hard-eyed woman named Cathy' was there and De Niro and Stanton left because they felt so uncomfortable.\n\nThey went to a club called On the Rox and came back at past 3am where he 'had a few words and a few lines and took some of the cocaine that was piled on the living room' and went back to his suite.\n\nWilliams also stopped by and was 'creeped out by the scene' and left after a quick chat and some cocaine.\n\nAt 8am the next day a room service waiter delivered wheat toast, jam and a pot of coffee to Belushi's bungalow and Cathy signed for it - Belushi was in bed, snoring loudly.\n\nShortly after that music producer Derek Power knocked loudly because he was looking for a friend but did not get an answer and then realized he had the wrong bungalow.\n\nAt noon Wallace, Belushi's bodyguard, went to see him and found him unconscious so tried to give him CPR. He called Brillstein, Belushi's agent and told him: 'I'm having trouble waking John up'\n\nMinutes later he called again: 'There's something really wrong with John!'\n\nBrillstein got his secretary to call 911 and ordered his assistant, Joel Briskin, to go the bungalow. When he arrived Wallace told him: 'Get out of here! John's dead!'\n\nAfter the paramedics arrived pandemonium set in at the Chateau Marmont and journalists arrived en masse - one banged on De Niro's door until he shouted: 'Go away!'\n\nA gardener was reassigned to another hotel after telling reporters that Belushi appeared to have choked on his tongue.\n\nEventually Belushi's body was strapped to a gurney and wheeled out in front of the waiting news media, turning his death into a bizarre and grim circus.\n\nThe next day Brillstein was allowed into the bungalow after the police had done a sweep, and was horrified of what he saw.\n\nAs well as the half finished beers, coffees and plates of food there were piles of trash and piles of phone messages.\n\nBrillstein told Levy: 'The scene was not only depressing, it was depraved. I couldn't believe John had lived there'.\n\nThe Chateau Marmont management decided to completely remodel Belushi's room and changed the furniture and the decor because they didn't want it to become a 'cult symbol', but they did not succeed.\n\nLevy writes: 'More than three decades after Belushi's death, the tragedy was still synonymous with Chateau Marmont.\n\n'Almost every article about the hotel would mention the connection, and even for many in the Hollywood community, the comedian's overdose was considered a feature of the hotel and not a sad fact from its past.'"
