        "text": "Who is the most favorable candidate running for president this year?\n\nAccording to the latest , it’s not either of the current party frontrunners, President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump.\n\nIt’s not any of the other GOP candidates including former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, either.\n\nIt’s independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He’s the only candidate with a favorability rating over 50%, according to the poll.\n\nHere’s the favorability breakdown:\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.: 52%\n\nDonald Trump: 42%\n\nJoe Biden: 41%\n\nNikki Haley: 33%\n\nRon DeSantis: 32%\n\nNot only is Kennedy Jr. the most favorable, he’s also tied with Haley for the lowest unfavorable rating. Here’s that breakdown:\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.: 34%\n\nDonald Trump: 57%\n\nJoe Biden: 58%\n\nNikki Haley: 34%\n\nRon DeSantis: 52%\n\nSo far, the 2024 presidential race is shaping up to be a potential rematch between Trump and Biden. Both have significant leads over their party rivals in nearly all polls.\n\nA recent found, in a hypothetical seven-way ballot (including Trump, Biden, Kennedy Jr., Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Independent candidate Cornel West, Libertarian Party candidate Lars Mapstead or a No-Labels candidate), Kennedy Jr. earned about 10% support, versus Trump at 37% and Biden at 34%.\n\nKennedy Jr. has more support than any other third-party candidate but still has a long way to go to prove his candidacy is viable. He and the others will face the uphill battle of qualifying for general election ballots since every state sets its own requirements.\n\nSo far, Kennedy Jr. is the first of his fellow third-party candidates to officially to appear on a November ballot – Utah’s.\n\nBut why is he so favorable to voters? Political analysts offer various reasons.\n\nOne is that it has more to do with his popular family than actual knowledge about the man himself – being the son of former U.S. Attorney General and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy and former Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n\nAnother theory is his unusual political platform.\n\nHe’s a member of one of the most famous families in Democratic politics, has long identified himself as a Democrat, and initially wanted to challenge Biden as a Democrat.\n\nBut in recent years, he’s buddied up to right-wing figures like Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and appeared on talk shows with Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon – largely because of his anti-vaccination views, which he’s held for years. COVID-19 lent him a platform on another level with those beliefs.\n\nThe environmental lawyer branded this combination into “Kennedy Americans” – anti-war, anti-corruption, anti-corporate greed and anti-political establishment – concepts that appeal to members of both major political parties. As New York Intelligencer , Trump calls him a liberal; Biden calls him a conservative; and they’re both right.\n\nGallup presumed Kennedy Jr. just hasn’t undergone the public scrutiny everyone else has, from previous public service and participating in debates.\n\nBut, the numbers could also hint at a fact that has nothing to do with him – American voters just dislike everybody else in the race.\n\nBiden’s favorability ratings have been abysmal since 2022, along with his approval ratings on the economy and foreign policy. With all the legal battles he faces and the fallout from the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Trump can’t shake abysmal favorability ratings either.\n\nPlus, they’ve both been president before, and incumbents historically have lower favorability ratings.\n\nIt may seem like a long shot now, but if Kennedy Jr.’s favorable image holds and he edges himself onto the ballot in November, he could attract what appears to be a decent swath of voters who don’t want Trump or Biden."
