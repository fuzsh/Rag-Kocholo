        "text": "After Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy gave an impromptu speech in Indianapolis, Indiana. At the time Senator Kennedy was running for the presidential nomination for the Democratic Party. He had announced his candidacy just weeks before King was killed.\n\nKennedy began his speech:\n\nI have bad news for you, for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and killed tonight. Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice for his fellow human beings, and he died because of that effort.\n\nKennedy even referenced his late brother, President John F. Kennedy in the speech. President Kennedy was killed by an assassin's bullet in Dallas, Texas in November 1963:\n\nI had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man. But we have to make an effort in the United States, we have to make an effort to understand, to go beyond these rather difficult times.\n\nAuthorities in Indianapolis had advised Senator Kennedy against making the speech for fear that it could escalate tensions in the city. Indianapolis had a turbulent year leading up to King’s assassination, and officials feared that Kennedy’s speech could further inflame racial tensions once people learned about King’s death. However, the improvised speech to a mostly African American crowd was later credited for preventing a potential riot in the city. Kennedy’s perceived empathy with the black community felt genuine to many in the crowd who found his speech powerful and healing. However, other major cities found themselves not so lucky, and experienced deadly rioting that night in response to King’s assassination."
