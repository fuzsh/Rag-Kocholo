        "text": "On July 17, 1999, items started washing ashore on Martha's Vineyard beaches that told a story of tragedy — not of some long-forgotten shipwreck with unknown seafarers lost at sea, but rather tidbits attached to the behind-the-scenes lives of an iconic family embraced by many as \"American royalty.\"\n\nA suitcase, a prescription bottle, a checkbook, registration papers for a single-engine Piper Saratoga private aircraft encased in a plastic sleeve.\n\nIt has been a quarter of a century since that six-seat airplane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about 7.5 miles southwest of the Vineyard, killing 38-year-old John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, 34, late on a Friday night with haze enveloping the Islands and the waters off Point Judith and the South Coast. The power couple was going to drop off Lauren Bessette at the Vineyard before continuing on to Hyannis to attend the wedding of JFK Jr.'s cousin, Rory Kennedy, to Mark Bailey at the Kennedy compound.\n\nThe small debris washing ashore the next day at Philbin and Moshup beaches was the first material indication that something had gone terribly wrong with the flight — ironically, the registration papers that connected the plane to the son of the late President John F. Kennedy came to rest, soggy but intact, on the Kennedy family's own 400-acre beachfront property off Moshup Trail in Aquinnah.\n\n'Was this the end of Camelot?'\n\n\"I can't believe it's been 25 years,\" said Matt Pitta, director of communications at the Cape-based Davenport Companies, reflecting last week as the tragic anniversary approached.\n\nAt the time of the plane crash, he was the news director and morning news host at WQRC and Ocean 104.7, part of Cape Cod Broadcasting Media.\n\n\"I vividly remember what happened that day, the whole sequence of events,\" he said. \"It was Saturday morning after the plane had gone missing. One of my colleagues, Doug Verney, who was the news anchor, called me early. He basically said, 'I need to talk to you,' and 'you better sit down for this.' He said, 'JFK Jr. is missing.'\"\n\nAt first, Pitta recalled, the words did not register with him, until Verney emphasized, \"the Coast Guard is out looking for JFK Jr.\"\n\n\"It was at that moment I thought, 'We're on the verge of one of the biggest stories on Cape Cod and the Islands in a long time,'\" Pitta said. Just like that, the \"big Kennedy wedding story everybody was planning for began turning from a celebratory kind of story into a story of tragedy.\"\n\nIn those first hours, there was a lot of confusion about whether JFK Jr. and his passengers had landed somewhere else and their whereabouts just hadn't been relayed to the family yet. But as the hours passed and it was confirmed the plane had not landed anywhere between New Jersey and Martha's Vineyard, he said, \"there was an overwhelming sense that this was not going to go well, \" and \"it became very clear that this was going to become a major national and international story.\n\n\"This was the son of a slain president. Many looked at JFK Jr. as someone who maybe someday could go into politics. Could he become the president?\" Pitta said. \"He was in a position to potentially rise to that next level of politics. Was this the end of Camelot?\"\n\nA Kennedy wedding celebration turned 'somber'\n\nRetired Barnstable Police Sgt. Sean Sweeney, a 39-year veteran of the force, was working a wedding security detail at the Kennedy compound that morning, July 17, 1999. At the time, he'd been working in the department for 20 years and he'd undertaken countless details for the Kennedys. He knew many of them on a personal level and he'd even spent time working out in the police department's fitness room with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was married to JFK's niece, Maria Shriver.\n\n\"Everything that morning was going along smooth. I was posted at the top of the driveway and I remember Arnold walking up the driveway and saying to me, 'We're going to be a little delayed,' but it was nothing alarming at the time. John Jr. was late,\" Sweeney recalled. \"And then, as we were standing there talking, word filtered in that something had gone wrong with John's plane.\"\n\nIn short order the joyous atmosphere \"really changed, and everything became somber,\" he said. The wedding was called off and everyone seemed to be holding their collective breath as answers as to what had happened were sought.\n\nIt would be three days before the family lowered the flag at the compound to half-staff in formal acknowledgement of their loss.\n\n\"It was a very sad day. John Jr. was real nice, down to earth, never got into any trouble. He was kind of like our Princess Diana — both were polite, kind, well-liked by their respective country people, both came to a tragic death all too early,\" Sweeney said. \"Most Americans remember the famous picture of John Jr. saluting when his father's casket went by after his funeral. He was kind of the beloved kid for the U.S.\"\n\nFinding information and solace in Hyannis\n\nNearby, the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum soon transformed from a tourist attraction into a hub of communication and a place to gather in solidarity and prayer.\n\nWendy Northcross, co-founder and the current museum executive director, said the news brought an influx of media and visitors.\n\n\"We had media from all over the world here,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of us who were just stunned, shocked and couldn't believe what was going on, and just the overwhelming response. I had never seen anything like it.\"\n\nBarnstable Director of Communications Lynne Poyant was working as executive director of the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, which at the time owned the museum, and was in charge of the facility's day-to-day operations. That Saturday was the first day of her first vacation in three years, she said.\n\nWhen she heard the news, Poyant headed to the museum. They were already getting calls from dozens of media outlets, including NBC's Dateline, and soon there was the chaos of news trucks and commercial-sized generators crowding the surrounding neighborhoods, and countless cameras set up with massive power cables snaking throughout the museum property.\n\nLocal residents and visitors from off Cape also began arriving at the museum by the thousands, at first as a place to get information, and then to mourn and share stories, \"kind of like a wake,\" Poyant said.\n\nThe developing story, Poyant said, \"was like a roller coaster ride of emotions,\" and when it became clear that it was going to be a recovery story and not a rescue story, \"people just wanted to share so much because they felt that this was America's royal family and how could another tragedy be befalling this family?\n\n\"I think there was hope that he would find his way in politics and carry on his father's legacy and, unfortunately, that did not happen,\" she said.\n\nA massive, but respectful gathering\n\nRetired Barnstable Police Deputy Chief Craig Tamash, now a town councilor, said when the news started getting out, police management of the situation rapidly turned into a 24/7 effort.\n\n\"It really was quite an operation from a police perspective just because of the crowds,\" he said. But in spite of the massive turnout Tamash doesn't recall any \"specific incidents of problems with people.\n\n\"Everyone seemed very well behaved,\" he said. A lot of people came and stood at the museum for hours at a time just to hear any snippets of news and to share the grief, he said.\n\n\"I think it's that he was part of Camelot,\" said Tamash, who was with the police department for 40 years. \"It really made an impression on people. \"\n\nLocally, a sense of losing cherished neighbors\n\nThe loss made a particular impression on the Cape Cod community that counted the Kennedys among neighbors including members of the police department.\n\n\"A lot of the officers knew a lot of the Kennedys, and a lot of the older officers had been involved in doing special details, so in a lot of respects it was losing someone you knew as a person,\" Tamash said.\n\nAnd it wasn't just sadness for the Kennedys, but also for the Bessettes, \"who lost two daughters,\" he said.\n\nHyannis museum co-founder Rebecca Pierce-Merrick also felt the loss deeply, a feeling shared by many. \"Throughout Cape Cod and far beyond people were crying, praying and broken-hearted,\" she said.\n\nShe spent many days at the museum and Kennedy compound and gave countless interviews, though \"it was very difficult to talk to people without crying.\" The final day of the search and recovery effort, she said, \"was the hardest to swallow. They were gone forever.\n\n\"I will never forget how very sad those five days were. But we do have precious memories. JFK Jr. loved visiting our JFK Hyannis Museum. We would quietly walk through the museum seeing so many images of his family. We were always so happy to see him,\" she said. \"It is hard to believe that he has been gone for 25 years.\"\n\nWhat happened in the 1999 Kennedy plane crash?\n\nIn the end, the National Transportation Safety Board found that JFK Jr. had become disoriented during his final approach to Martha's Vineyard after leaving the mainland coastal route he'd followed up to Point Judith on Narragansett Bay and striking out across open water.\n\nAccording to the board's 28-page aviation accident final report, issued the following July, the probable cause July 16, 1999, was \"the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.\"\n\nSpatial disorientation is the inability to determine body position or relative motion in the absence of visual cues. It is a factor in 5% to 10% of aviation accidents, with 90% of them ending with fatality, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nFactors in the accident, the report found, \"were haze, and the dark night.\" JFK Jr. was not yet rated to fly on instruments alone and he'd also had limited solo night-time flying experience, according to the report. The investigators found no mechanical failures and no indications of in-flight breakup or fire.\n\nWhile the weather that night required only that pilots be certified in visual flight rules — that is, flying with the visible horizon and at least three miles of visibility — other pilots who'd also flown in the Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard area that evening reported hazy conditions over the water and the islands.\n\nOne pilot, referenced in the report, said that visibility was unrestricted at 14,000 feet, but as he began his descent toward Nantucket over Martha's Vineyard, he looked down and, \"…there was nothing to see. There was no horizon and no light...I turned left toward Martha's Vineyard to see if it was visible but could see no lights of any kind nor any evidence of the island…I thought the island might (have) suffered a power failure.\"\n\nAccording to radar analysis, the plane had begun to descend from an altitude of 2,200 feet on approach to the Vineyard that evening, then rose in a turn toward the island, banked to the right and plunged into the ocean at a rate of 4,700 to 5,000 feet per minute, the Times reported. It disappeared from radar around 9:40 p.m.\n\nThe search for JFK Jr. and his passengers covered 9,000 square miles and involved 10 Coast Guard vessels, two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessels, a Navy salvage vessel, two Air National Guard aircraft, two Coast Guard helicopters and a Coast Guard Falcon jet.\n\nSmall debris from the plane was recovered July 19, 1999, three days after the crash. The deceased, and larger pieces of the wreckage, were recovered from 116 feet of depth July 21.\n\nJuly 22, 1999, JFK Jr., his wife of nearly three years and his sister-in-law were buried at sea from the USS Briscoe. The junior Kennedy's cousin, whose wedding he and his wife had been going to, quietly married two-and-a-half weeks later, in a small private ceremony in Greece.\n\nHeather McCarron can be reached at hmccarron@capecodonline.com."
