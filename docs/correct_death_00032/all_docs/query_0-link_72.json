        "text": "The world has reacted with mixed emotions to the death of OJ Simpson, the former American footballer who was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ron Goldman.\n\nSimpson, who was controversially acquitted of the murders in a 1995 trial that gripped public attention in the United States and overseas, died of cancer aged 76.\n\nMs Brown Simpson and Mr Goldman were found stabbed to death outside Ms Brown Simpson's Los Angeles home in 1994.\n\nSimpson was found liable for their deaths following a civil suit pursued by the Goldman and Brown families, and was ordered to pay $US33.5 million ($51 million) in damages.\n\nHe was later imprisoned for armed robbery and kidnapping in a separate criminal trial.\n\nSimpson's death was announced by his family in a post on X, in which they asked for \"privacy and grace\".\n\n'Further reminder' of loss\n\nMr Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, said Simpson's death only emphasised his grief.\n\n\"The only thing I have to say is it's just further reminder of Ron being gone all these years,\" Mr Goldman told NBC News.\n\n\"It's no great loss to the world. It's a further reminder of Ron's being gone.\"\n\nGloria Allred, an attorney who once represented Ms Brown's family, said she mourned for them, not Simpson.\n\n\"I feel that the system failed Nicole Brown Simpson and failed battered women everywhere. I don't mourn for OJ Simpson. I do mourn for Nicole Brown Simpson and her family and they should be remembered,\" she said.\n\nThere has been no comment from the Brown family or Ms Brown Simpson's two children who live very private lives. Sydney Simpson was eight and Justin Simpson was five when their mother was killed.\n\nDavid Cook, an attorney for the Goldman family, has been seeking to collect the civil judgement in the Ron Goldman case since 2008.\n\n\"We don't know what he has, where it is or who is in control. We will pick up where we are and keep going with it.\"\n\nFormer Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, who's ex-wife Kris Jenner was previously married to Robert Kardashian, a lawyer on Simpson's defence team in the criminal trial, posted a pithy \"Good Riddance\" on social platform X.\n\nDivisive figure\n\nWhile many took Simpson's death as an opportunity to remember the deaths of Ms Brown Simpson and Mr Goldman, Pro Football Hall of Fame president Jim Porter drew attention to his athletic career.\n\n\"OJ Simpson was the first player to reach a rushing mark many thought could not be attained in a 14-game season when he topped 2,000 yards. His on-field contributions will be preserved in the hall's archives in Canton, Ohio,\" Mr Porter said in a statement. He made no reference to any of the legal cases against Simpson.\n\nAlan Dershowitz, a legal advisor on Simpson's so-called \"dream team\" in the murder trial, told AP Simpson \"played an important role in exposing the racial divisions in America\".\n\n\"His trial also exposed police corruption among some officials in the Los Angeles Police Department. He will leave a mixed legacy. Great athlete,\" Mr Dershowitz said.\n\nSports commentator Bob Costas, who worked with Simpson on NBC's football coverage, recalled him as an athlete who branched out beyond football and broke barriers. Simpson starred in commercials, television shows and movies including The Naked Gun film trilogy.\n\n\"He was not just admired, but beloved,\" Costas told CNN. \"He was, if not the first, he was the first to do it in a big way, an African American who broke through.\"\n\nDavid Zucker, who directed Simpson in two Naked Gun movies, made a more cheeky tribute on social media. He wrote: \"R.I.P. Nordberg. 'His acting was a lot like his murdering: He got away with it, but no one believed him.'\"\n\nIn the affluent Los Angeles neighbourhood of Brentwood, where Simpson and Ms Brown Simpson lived, reactions to his passing varied.\n\n\"I saw it this morning on the news. You know, I went to USC when he was there. So, you know, he was a very nice man at the time. I think it was very tragic what happened with him and Nicole and Ron Goldman … it's kind of tragic and sad and, you know, for such a talented guy,\" said Bill Cloke, a 81-year-old Brentwood resident.\n\nGeorge Molsbarger, a 78-year-old Brentwood resident, summed up his reaction in one word: \"Good.\"\n\n\"Not missed. Not going to miss him … sorry to see anybody die, but I'm sure some people out there are missing his wife as well.\""
