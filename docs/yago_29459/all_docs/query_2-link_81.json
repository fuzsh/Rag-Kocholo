        "text": "Jean I (November 15 – 20, 1316), called the Posthumous was King of France and Navarre, as the posthumous son and successor of King Louis X of France and Navarre for the five days he lived in 1316. The infant King’s mother was Clementia of Anjou and Hungary, the daughter of Charles Martel of Anjou, the titular King of Hungary, and Duchess Clemence of Austria.\n\nClementina of Anjou’s father, Charles Martel (1271 – 1295) of the Capetian dynasty was the eldest son of King Charles II of Naples and Princess Mary of Hungary, the daughter of King Stephen V of Hungary and his wife Elizabeth the Cuman.\n\nClementina’s mother, Clemence of Austria (1262 – ca.1293, or 1295) was a daughter of King Rudolph I of the Romans/Germany, Duke of Austria and Gertrude of Hohenberg. She was a member of the House of Habsburg.\n\nBoth of Clementina’s parents died during her early childhood, and Princess Mary of Hungary, her grandmother, raised her. The family claimed the Crown Hungary through Mary, and although Clementia was born a cadet member of the French Royal House of Capét and grew up in Naples; she was considered a Hungarian Princess.\n\nKing Jean I of France and Navarre is the youngest person to be King of France, and the only one to have been King from birth, and the only one to hold the title for his entire life. His reign is the shortest of any undisputed French king.\n\nAlthough he is considered a King today, his status was not recognized until chroniclers and historians in later centuries began numbering the Kings of France and they numbered Prince Jean de Valois of France, as King Jean II of France, thereby acknowledging Jean I’s brief reign. King Alfonso XIII of Spain is the only other European monarch to be born a King from birth.\n\nJean reigned for five days under the regency of his uncle, Prince Philippe the Tall, Count of Poitou, until his death on November 20, 1316. His death ended the three centuries of father-to-son succession to the French throne. The infant king was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis.\n\nKing Jean I was succeeded by his uncle, the Count of Poitou, as King Philippe V of France, whose succession led to the re-affirmation of the Salic law, which excluded women from the line of succession to the French throne.\n\nConsequences\n\nThe child mortality rate was very high in medieval Europe and King Jean may have died from any number of causes, but rumours of poisoning spread immediately after his death (including one which said that he had been murdered with a pin by his aunt), as many people benefited from it, and as John’s father had also died in strange circumstances. The cause of his death is still not known today.\n\nThe premature death of King Jean I brought the first issue of succession of the Capetian Dynasty. When Louis X, his father, died without a son to succeed him, it was the first time since Hugh Capét that the succession from father to son of the Kings of France was interrupted.\n\nIt was then decided to wait until his pregnant widow, Clementia of Hungary, delivered the child. The king’s brother, Philip the Tall, was in charge of the regency of the kingdom against his uncle Charles de Valois, Count of La Marche.\n\nThe birth of a male child was expected to give France its king. The problem of succession returned when Jean died five days after birth. Philippe the Tall ascended the throne at the expense of Jean’s four-year-old half-sister, Joan, daughter of King Louis X and Margaret of Burgundy.\n\nThere were a couple of reasons Joan was passed over for the French throne. First, Joan’s paternity was dubious because her mother was involved in a scandal, but King Louis X declared her his legitimate daughter before he died in 1316.\n\nEarly in 1314, Margaret of Burgundy was caught in an alleged act of adultery in the Tour de Nesle affair. Her sister-in-law Isabella of France was a witness against her, and Margaret was imprisoned at Château Gaillard along with her sister-in-law Blanche of Burgundy.\n\nSecondly, the French Lords were opposed to the idea of a female monarch and therefore elected Louis X’s brother, Prince Philippe the Tall, Count of Poitou, as King Philippe V of France instead.\n\nJoan II (January 28, 1312 – October 6, 1349) was Queen of Navarre from 1328 until her death. She was the only surviving child of King Louis X of France and Navarre, and Margaret of Burgundy, the second daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy (1248–1306) and Agnes of France (1260–1327), the youngest daughter of King Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence. As such, she was a member of House of Burgundy, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty.\n\nThe future King Louis X of France was born in Paris, the eldest son of Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre, daughter of King Henri I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois who was the elder child and only daughter of Robert I, Count of Artois, and Matilda of Brabant. Robert I, Count of Artois was the fifth (and second surviving) son of King Louis VIII of France and Infanta Blanche of Castile.\n\nKing Louis X inherited the Kingdom of Navarre on the death of his mother, on April 4, 1305, and was crowned on October 1, 1307. On September 21, 1305, at age 15, he married Margaret of Burgundy and they had a daughter, Joan.\n\nLouis’ first wife, Margaret of Burgundy implicated in the Tour de Nesle affair, was found guilty of infidelity and was imprisoned until her death on August 14, 1315. Louis and Clémentina of Hungary were married that same year. Clémentina of Hungary was the daughter of Charles Martel of Anjou, the titular King of Hungary, and Clémentina of Austria, daughter of King Rudolph I of the Romans/Germany and Gertrude of Hohenberg. She was a member of the House of Habsburg.\n\nKing Louis X died within a year of his marriage on June 5, 1316 leaving a pregnant wife. According to an agreement of the most powerful French lords, which was completed on July 16, if Clémentina gave birth to a son, the son was to be crowned King of France, but if a daughter was born, she and Joan could only inherit the Kingdom of Navarre and the counties of Champagne and Brie (the three realms that Louis X had inherited from his mother, Joan I of Navarre).\n\nIt was also agreed that Joan was to be sent to her mother’s relatives in Burgundy, but her marriage could not be decided without the consent of the members of the French royal family.\n\nQueen Clémentina gave birth to a boy, who was proclaimed king as Jean I of France but the infant King lived only five days. His death precipitate a succession crisis.\n\nKing Louis X’s only other child was Princess Joan from his first marriage to Margaret of Burgundy. However, Joan’s paternity was dubious because her mother was involved in a scandal, but King Louis X declared her his legitimate daughter before he died in 1316.\n\nJoan’s mother, Margaret of Burgundy, and the other daughters-in-law of King Philippe IV of France, Joan and Blanche of Burgundy, were involved in the Tour de Nesle affair, were accused of adultery and were arrested in 1314. They were charged with adultery with two knights, the brothers Philippe and Walter of Aunay.\n\nAfter being tortured, one of the brothers confessed that they had been the lovers of Margaret and Blanche for three years. The Aunay brothers were soon executed, and Margaret and Blanche were imprisoned. After the scandal, the legitimacy of Joan of France became dubious, because her mother was accused of having had an extramarital affair around the year of Joan’s birth.\n\nWith the death of the infant King Jean I of France the French lords were opposed to the idea of a female monarch and elected Louis X’s brother, Philippe, as King Philippe V of France. King Philippe immediately had himself crowned at Reims. However, his legitimacy was challenged by the party of Louis X’s daughter Joan.\n\nKing Philippe V successfully contested her claims for a number of reasons, including her youth, doubts regarding her paternity (her mother was involved in the Tour de Nesle Affair), and the Estates General’s determination that women should be excluded from the line of succession to the French throne. The succession of Philippe, instead of Joan, set the precedent for the French royal succession that would be known as the Salic law.\n\nThe Navarrese noblemen also paid homage to King Philippe V. Joan’s maternal grandmother, Agnes of France, and uncle, Odo IV of Burgundy, made attempts to secure the counties of Champagne and Brie (which had been the patrimony of Louis X’s mother, Joan I of Navarre) to Joan, but the French royal troops defeated her supporters.\n\nAfter Philippe V married his daughter to Odo IV of Burgundy and granted him two counties as her dowry, Odo renounced Joan’s claim to Champagne and Brie in exchange for a compensation in March 1318. Joan married Philippe of Évreux, who was also a member of the French royal family.\n\nPhilippe of Évreux was the son of Louis, Count of Évreux, a younger son of King Philippe III of France by his second wife, Marie of Brabant, a daughter of Henri III, Duke of Brabant, and Adelaide of Burgundy.\n\nPhilippe’s father was the founder of the Capetian House of Évreux, while his mother, Margaret (d. 1311), belonged to another Capetian branch, the House of Artois.\n\nKing Philippe V was succeeded by his brother, Charles IV, in both France and Navarre in 1322, but most Navarrese lords refused to swear loyalty to him. After Charles IV died in 1328, the Navarrese expelled the French governor and declared Joan the rightful monarch of Navarre as Queen Joan II of Navarre. Her husband, Philippe of Évreux, became King Philippe III of Navarre by right of his wife. They ruled Navarre jointly.\n\nIn France, Philippe of Valois was crowned king as King Philippe VI of France. He concluded an agreement with Joan and her husband, who renounced Joan’s claims to Champagne and Brie in exchange for three counties, while Philip acknowledged their right to Navarre. Joan and her husband were together crowned in Pamplona Cathedral on March 5, 1329.\n\nThe royal couple closely cooperated during their joint reign, but Philippe of Évreux was more active. However, they mostly lived in their French domains, with Navarre being administered by governors during their absences.\n\nCharles, Count of Valois (March 12, 1270 – December 16, 1325), the fourth son of King Philippe III of France and Infanta Isabella of Aragon, was a member of the House of Capét and founder of the House of Valois, whose rule over France would start in 1328.\n\nCharles ruled several principalities. He held in appanage the counties of Valois, Alençon (1285), and Perche. Through his marriage to his first wife, Margaret, Countess of Anjou and Maine, he became Count of Anjou and Maine. Through his marriage to his second wife, Catherine I of Courtenay, Empress of Constantinople, he was titular Latin Emperor of Constantinople from 1301 to 1307, although he ruled from exile and only had authority over the Crusader States in Greece.\n\nAs the grandson of King Louis IX of France, Charles of Valois was a son, brother, brother-in-law and son-in-law of kings or queens (of France, Navarre, England and Naples). His descendants, the House of Valois, would become the royal house of France three years after his death, beginning with his eldest son King Philippe VI of France.\n\nLife\n\nBesides holding in appanage the counties of Valois, Alençon and Perche, Charles became in 1290 the Count of Anjou and of Maine by his first marriage with Margaret of Anjou, the eldest daughter of King Charles II of Naples, titular King of Sicily; by a second marriage that he contracted with the heiress of Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople, last Latin emperor of Constantinople, he also had pretensions to the throne of Constantinople.\n\nFrom his early years, Charles of Valois dreamed of more and sought all his life for a crown he never obtained. Starting in 1284, Pope Martin IV recognized him as King of Aragon (under the vassalage of the Holy See), as the son of his mother, Infanta Isabella of Aragon, in opposition to King Pedro III of Aragon, who after the conquest of the island of Sicily was an enemy of the Papacy.\n\nCharles hence married Margaret, the daughter of the Neapolitan king, in order to re-enforce his position in Sicily which was supported by the Pope. Thanks to this Aragonese Crusade undertaken by his father King Philippe III against the advice of his elder brother Philippe the Fair, he believed he would win a kingdom and however won nothing but the ridicule of having been crowned with a cardinal’s hat in 1285, which gave him the alias of the “King of the Cap.” He would never dare to use the royal seal which was made on this occasion and had to renounce the title.\n\nHis principal quality was to be a good military leader. Charles commanded effectively in Flanders in 1297. Thus his elder brother, King Philippe IV of France, quickly deduced that Charles could conduct an expedition in Italy against King Frederick III of Sicily. The affair was ended by the Treaty of Caltabellotta.\n\nDreaming at the same time for an imperial crown, Charles married secondly to Catherine I of Courtenay in 1301, who was the titular Empress of Constantinople. But it needed the connivance of Pope Boniface VIII, which he obtained by his expedition to Italy, where the Pope supported Charles’s father-in-law King Charles II against King Frederick III, his cousin.\n\nNamed papal vicar, Charles of Valois lost himself in the complexity of Italian politics, was compromised in a massacre at Florence, and in sordid financial extremities, reached Sicily where he consolidated his reputation as a looter and finally returned to France discredited in 1301–1302.\n\nCharles was back in shape to seek a new crown when the German King, Albrecht I, King of the Romans, was murdered in 1308. Charles’s brother King Philippe IV, who did not wish to take the risk himself of a check and probably thought that a French puppet on the imperial throne would be a good thing for France, encouraged him.\n\nThe candidacy was defeated with the election of Heinrich VII of Luxembourg as German king, for the electors did not want France to become even more powerful. Charles thus continued to dream of the eastern crown of the Courtenays.\n\nHe did benefit from the affection which his brother King Philippe, who had suffered from the remarriage of their father, brought to his only full brother, and Charles thus found himself given responsibilities which largely exceeded his talent. Thus it was he who directed, in 1311, the royal embassy to the conferences of Tournai with the Flemish; he quarreled there with his brother’s chamberlain Enguerrand de Marigny, who openly defied him. Charles did not pardon the affront and would continue the vendetta against Marigny after his brother King Philippe’s death.\n\nIn 1314, Charles was doggedly opposed to the torture of Jacques de Molay, grand master of the Templars.\n\nThe premature death of Charles’s nephew, King Louis X of France, in 1316, gave Charles hopes for a political role. However, he could not prevent his nephew Philippe the Tall from taking the regency while awaiting the birth of his brother King Louis X’s posthumous son. When that son (Jean I of France) died after a few days, Philippe took the throne as King Philippe V of France. Charles was initially opposed to his nephew Philippe’s succession, for Philippe’s elder brother King Louis X had left behind a daughter, Joan of France, his only surviving child. However, Charles later switched sides and eventually backed his nephew Philippe, probably realizing that Philippe’s precedent would bring him and his line closer to the throne.\n\nIn 1324, Charles commanded with success the army of his nephew, King Charles IV of France (who succeeded his elder brother King Philippe V in 1322), to take Guyenne and Flanders from King Edward II of England. He contributed, by the capture of several cities, to accelerate the peace, which was concluded between the King of France and his sister Isabella, the queen-consort of England as the wife of King Edward II.\n\nThe Count of Valois died on December 16, 1325 at Nogent-le-Roi, leaving a son who would take the throne of France under the name of Philippe VI and commence the branch of the Valois. Had he survived for three more years and outlived his nephew King Charles IV, Charles might have become king of France. Charles was buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris – his effigy is now in the Basilica of St Denis."
