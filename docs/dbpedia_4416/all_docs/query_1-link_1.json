        "text": "Changing jobs every few years or less is increasingly the norm among younger generations.\n\nA 2020 Deloitte survey found that 31% of Millennials and around 50% of those from Generation Z anticipate leaving their job within the next two years.\n\nWorking people are increasingly responsible for carving their own path (Savickas, 2011). But the countless career-sculpting possibilities can be an exciting but daunting process for people at any stage of life.\n\nCareer counselors offer a valuable source of support and guidance for people wanting to explore their aspirations, make a career change, or simply get more satisfaction from their work.\n\nThis article outlines what career counseling is, how it can be beneficial, and several highly influential career counseling theories.\n\nBefore you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Goal Achievement Exercises for free. These detailed, science-based exercises will help you or your clients create actionable goals and master techniques to create lasting behavior change.\n\nWhat Is Career Counseling & Why Is It Important?\n\nEach year of full-time work equates to around 2,000 hours of our life – a considerable chunk of time. It’s not surprising then that being unhappy or unsatisfied in a job can profoundly affect our lives.\n\nAs well as providing financial security, jobs are a chance to gain fulfillment, meaning, and connection with others, and offer an important means of identity expression (Lent & Brown, 2013).\n\nCareer counselors are trained professionals who help people explore, understand, and execute career-related decisions. Sessions may happen in a one-to-one setting, educational contexts such as in a university, or as part of group counseling (Lent & Brown, 2013).\n\nCareer counseling also offers a supportive space to help people navigate the complex and ever-changing world of work, enabling people to find their own solutions to a variety of job challenges.\n\nA Brief History of the Field\n\nThe evolution of career counseling has matched the economic turns of the past century (Maree, 2015).\n\nDuring the second industrial economic wave of the early 20th century (1900–1950), many people began working in industries that were manufacturing products on a large scale, such as textiles and iron (Maree, 2015).\n\nBetween 1940 and 1990, the spotlight shifted to specialization and honing in on a particular career path. The conventional “career” was punctuated with job milestones and a sense of progression, with the goal of gradually fulfilling more challenging and probably higher paid roles (Maree, 2015).\n\nThis was a turning point for career counselors, who could help job seekers identify opportunities that would land them on a solid career track (Maree, 2015). Tools like personality assessments that could identify people’s unique characteristics gained attention (Maree, 2015).\n\nIn the 1990s, rapid advances in computer technology were making waves in the workplace (Maree, 2015). Individual career identity became more important in career counseling, and goalposts moved from linear career progression to continued professional development and helping people develop versatility in their employment prospects (Maree, 2015).\n\nNow, work is increasingly digital, remote, and flexible. As a result, Argyropoulou and Kaliris (2018) suggest that career counseling is becoming more dynamic and integrated, helping clients explore their career identity within the larger context of their life while also supporting them to manage their careers more effectively for themselves.\n\nDownload 3 Free Goals Exercises (PDF)\n\nThese detailed, science-based exercises will help you or your clients create actionable goals and master techniques for lasting behavior change.\n\nDownload PDF\n\n5 Benefits of Seeking Career Counseling\n\nThere’s no question that career counseling can help people with the practical decision-making aspects of career choices. However, similar to other forms of counseling, the therapeutic relationship and the opportunity for dialogue are central to the effectiveness of career counseling interventions.\n\nReducing indecision and executing career plans\n\nCareer counseling has shown to be beneficial for making career choices in the longer term. One study found that after only four or five career counseling sessions, most clients had carried out their career plans within a year and reported less difficulty in making career decisions up to a year later (Perdrix, Stauffer, Masdonati, Massoudi, & Rossier, 2012).\n\nCounselor support, clarifying values, and life satisfaction\n\nOther research found that a strong working alliance with a career counselor was positively linked to increases in life satisfaction and negatively related to difficulties in career decision making (Masdonati, Massoudi, & Rossier, 2009).\n\nIn addition, a large meta-analysis involving 57 studies (Whiston, Li, Mitts, & Wright, 2017) revealed that counselor support and helping the client better understand their values were integral components of effective career choice interventions.\n\n3 Fascinating Theories\n\nThe landscape of career counseling has evolved considerably over the last 50 years, which is mirrored in the development of psychological theories in this field.\n\nBelow, we outline three influential career counseling theories.\n\nMinnesota Theory of Work-Adjustment\n\nAt the heart of the Theory of Work-Adjustment (TWA; Dawis & Lofquist, 1984) is the notion that the “fit” between a person and their work environment can drive important career choices (Swanson & Schneider, 2013).\n\nThe predictive model of TWA refers to the level of compatibility between a person and their environment (Swanson & Schneider, 2013).\n\nDoes the workplace meet their needs? Are they satisfied?\n\nDoes the person’s abilities match what is needed of them in the workplace? Are they satisfactory?\n\nThe TWA approach aims to determine whether there is an agreement between the individual’s values/abilities and the requirements of their job – the ultimate goal being a satisfied and satisfactory employee (Swanson & Schneider, 2013).\n\nThe process model of TWA seeks to understand the processes of work adjustment and how it can be sustained (Swanson & Schneider, 2013) by looking at adjustment styles that are influenced by:\n\nFlexibility:\n\nHow much person–job incompatibility someone can put up with.\n\nActive adjustment:\n\nHow much the individual affects their environment to increase compatibility.\n\nReactive adjustment:\n\nHow much the individual tries to change themselves to increase compatibility.\n\nPerseverance:\n\nHow long someone perseveres with incompatibility after investing in active and reactive adjustment.\n\nWhen a flexibility limit is reached, this will usually drive adjustment behaviors, and then perseverance dictates how long someone will continue trying to make the job “fit” (Swanson & Schneider, 2013). For example, a career counselor might explore whether greater satisfaction or “satisfactoriness” at work could be found in engaging in active or reactive adjustment (Swanson & Schneider, 2013).\n\nWorld’s Largest Positive Psychology Resource\n\nThe Positive Psychology Toolkit© is a groundbreaking practitioner resource containing over 500 science-based exercises, activities, interventions, questionnaires, and assessments created by experts using the latest positive psychology research.\n\nUpdated monthly. 100% Science-based.\n\n“The best positive psychology resource out there!”\n\n— Emiliya Zhivotovskaya, Flourishing Center CEO\n\nHolland’s theory of vocational choice\n\nThe theory of vocational choice (Holland, 1959) proposes that people and their environments fall into six “types” that are associated with particular values, abilities, self-beliefs, and inclinations toward certain activities (Nauta, 2013).\n\nThe types are:\n\nRealistic\n\nInvestigative\n\nArtistic\n\nSocial\n\nEnterprising\n\nConventional\n\nAn individual’s pattern of “RIASEC” types is proposed to foretell a variety of career outcomes, such as job satisfaction and typical career paths (Nauta, 2013).\n\nFor example, someone in the Enterprising camp will value ambition and economic achievement and like working with people and data. Such a person is likely to have a keen desire to lead and is potentially suited to a career as a lawyer, manager, or politician (Nauta, 2013).\n\nHolland (1959) proposed that the interests people have drive the competencies and experiences gathered and the beliefs developed, which can be helpful to understand future career decisions (Nauta, 2013). Work environments, too, can be classified according to types, in terms of the rewards on offer or the abilities required of employees (Nauta, 2013).\n\nSocial cognitive career theory\n\nSocial cognitive career theory (Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994) is aligned with Bandura’s (1989) social cognitive theory, which proposes that people’s agency to make decisions is heavily influenced by their social environments (Lent, 2013).\n\nWhile growing up, an individual’s environment and relationships can dictate the activities a person is exposed to and will be encouraged to pursue. The performance at certain activities and the feedback received provide a sense of a person’s capabilities and the consequences of carrying out certain behaviors.\n\nAccording to social cognitive theory, self-efficacy beliefs and outcome expectations are catalysts for behavior (Lent, 2013). Self-efficacy beliefs refer to people’s dynamic perceptions of their capability to perform certain tasks, such as having strong self-efficacy beliefs about cooking skills, but feeling relatively incompetent at technological tasks.\n\nOutcome expectations refer to beliefs about what will happen if certain behaviors are carried out (Lent, 2013); for instance, someone might believe that becoming a chef would involve working late hours, which would negatively affect their social relationships.\n\nPeople can exert their agency for career choices through their personal goals. Outcome expectations and self-efficacy beliefs may work in tandem to influence people’s career interests and goals. In other words, we are more likely to work toward achievable goals that will also have positive outcomes (Lent, 2013).\n\nOver time, as goals and interests facilitate the selection of pursuits, this leads to outcomes that feed back into the cycle, shaping or reinforcing outcome expectations and self-efficacy beliefs that drive future career interests. As self-efficacy beliefs and outcome expectations firm up, career interests may narrow and strengthen (Lent, 2013).\n\nCareer Counseling Process: 3 Models\n\nFor those of you who want to understand the career counseling process, we explain three models below.\n\nSelf-Directed Search\n\nThe Self-Directed Search tool (SDS; Holland, Fritzsche, & Powell, 1994) accompanies Holland’s (1959) theory of vocational choice. The SDS is a 228-item inventory that gathers information about work activities, interests, jobs, and self-assessed competencies and capabilities associated with the “RIASEC” types (Hansen, 2013).\n\nThe ranked order of types provides insight into that person’s unique profile constellation, and there are a staggering 720 possible combinations (Nauta, 2013). Career counselors may zoom in on the top three types (Artistic, Social, and Conventional), giving a three-point “Holland code” (Nauta, 2013).\n\nThis assessment becomes a starting point for career counseling to begin identifying career prospects that suit the person’s interests and personality profile (Hansen, 2013). Holland suggested that people with more consistent and differentiated profiles are more likely to have a steady career path, potentially because career decisions come more easily and they have greater clarity on which jobs are a suitable fit (Nauta, 2013).\n\nA narrative approach\n\nIn line with social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1989) and social cognitive career theory (Lent et al., 1994), narrative career counseling is a wonderful way to ignite the client’s sense of agency in their career choices, making them the protagonist in their career story (Chen, 2011).\n\nThe aim is to support the client to understand and develop their own career narratives (Savickas, 2011) in a way that is helpful for their future selves (Cochran, 2011). One narrative-based approach is Brott’s (2004) “Storied Approach” of career counseling, which comprises three interlacing phases:\n\nCo-construction: counselor and client explore previous work stories and narratives.\n\nDe-construction: looking at past “chapters” from alternative points of view to uncover consistent themes or storylines.\n\nConstruction: the client embarks on future storytelling, discussing the themes they wish to leave behind and those they want to pursue.\n\nTo facilitate the processes of the Storied Approach (Brott, 2004), qualitative assessments may be used, such as\n\nLife line:\n\nThe client creates a timeline of significant memories and events as the counselor asks questions to deepen their insights into particular life “chapters” (Brott, 2004).\n\nCard sorts:\n\nCard sorts are personalized to reflect the client’s values, interests, meaningful memories, or language they use. This can be helpful to clarify the counselor’s understanding of the client (Brott, 2004).\n\nThe goal map:\n\nThe goal map explores anticipated challenges in the future and the client’s resources for dealing with these challenges. This helps clients begin to construct a vision of their next destination (Brott, 2004).\n\nMulticultural career assessment\n\nCulture, race, and ethnicity are fundamental considerations for effective and inclusive career counseling of all kinds. Multicultural career assessment is the process of actively exploring differences in race, culture, and ethnicity between the client and counselor in order to reduce opportunities for bias during the counseling process (Flores & Heppner, 2002).\n\nSelection and use of assessment tools:\n\nMuch consideration should be given to the cultural appropriateness of certain assessment tools. Does a construct or attribute mean the same thing across cultures? Has a tool been validated with representative samples of cultural/ethnic/racial groups (Flores & Heppner, 2002)?\n\nInterpretation:\n\nThe client’s cultural environment needs to be fully understood for the counselor to correctly interpret the context and meaning of assessment responses. The counselor should validate and sense-check any results and confirm their interpretations with the client (Flores & Heppner, 2002).\n\nGoals of Career Counseling: 3 Examples\n\nNegotiating career changes and challenges is potentially a lifelong process.\n\nBelow are three broad areas where career counseling may be helpful (Lent & Brown, 2013).\n\n1. Making career decisions\n\nPerhaps the most well-known role of a career counselor is helping clients make decisions that align with their longer term aspirations, including identifying realistic job options (Lent & Brown, 2013).\n\nSome people may have an overwhelming number of potential options, and some may not know where to start looking. A career counselor can help people realize an achievable roadmap for what they want to do (Lent & Brown, 2013).\n\n2. Career adjustment and management\n\nChange in a work environment can trigger feelings of dissatisfaction; for example, if a role changes, this may require an uncomfortable period of adjustment (Lent & Brown, 2013). Equally, job dissatisfaction may develop over time. A promotion may leave people feeling overly stretched, or expectations for what a job was anticipated to be like are left unfulfilled.\n\nA career counselor can talk through these concerns to help identify how clients can cope with their situation and explore opportunities for greater job satisfaction or competency building (Lent & Brown, 2013).\n\n3. Navigating work changes and finding work–life balance\n\nCareer counselors can provide support and help people find their way through a period of change. Some people may seek counseling following a difficult or unexpected life event, such as needing to relocate or being laid off (Lent & Brown, 2013).\n\nFor others, regaining work–life balance may be the objective, perhaps shifting their work goals or aspirations to better suit home-life demands or other interests they’d like to pursue (Lent & Brown, 2013).\n\nA Note on Ethics\n\nIn the United States, the National Career Development Association (NCDA; 2015) provides a code of ethics for people in career counseling professions.\n\nProfessional members of the NCDA are required to observe certain values, such as\n\nFacilitating and improving career development throughout people’s lives\n\nRespecting diversity and advocating social justice\n\nProtecting the integrity of the working alliance\n\nEthical and competent practice\n\nHonoring the dignity and value of every individual\n\nFurthermore, NCDA ethical guidelines of practice broadly relate to these core principles:\n\nAutonomy — encouraging individuals to take agency in their own lives\n\nNon-maleficence — avoiding doing harm\n\nBeneficence — having a positive impact and taking actions that support wellbeing\n\nObjectivity — fair and unbiased treatment\n\nAccountability — taking responsibility for actions, cultivating trust, and keeping your word\n\nVeracity — acting truthfully with clients\n\n17 Tools To Increase Motivation and Goal Achievement\n\nThese 17 Motivation & Goal Achievement Exercises [PDF] contain all you need to help others set meaningful goals, increase self-drive, and experience greater accomplishment and life satisfaction.\n\nCreated by Experts. 100% Science-based.\n\nPositivePsychology.com’s Relevant Resources\n\nYou’ll find many worksheets and tools throughout our site that can support your career counseling practice.\n\nCheck out the following for a selection of useful resources and further reading.\n\nCoping With Stress\n\nThis two-part exercise invites clients to list experienced physiological and emotional symptoms of stress and brainstorm strategies to reduce, cope with, or eliminate these sources of stress.
