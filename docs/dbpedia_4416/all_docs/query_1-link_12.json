        "text": "Throughout our working lives, most of us will reflect at some point on where our career is heading.\n\nWe may ask ourselves, “Have I chosen the right path?” and “How do I earn a good living, yet remain true to my values?”\n\nThese are big questions — and not easily answered.\n\nWhether we are embarking on a first career or feeling stuck in a long-term job, a career coach can help, adding value by bringing “the advantage of insight, information and planned action to the pursuit of goals” (Cox, 2018, p. 412).\n\nLet’s learn more about what a client can expect from career coaching and look at tools, questions, and templates to help.\n\nBefore you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Work & Career Coaching Exercises for free. These detailed, science-based exercises will help you or your clients identify opportunities for professional growth and create a more meaningful career.\n\nWhat Is Career Coaching? 2 Models\n\n“The boundaries between work life and home life, and career and family are increasingly blurred, and the two parts of life inevitably influence and impact on each other.”\n\nYates, 2021, p. 282\n\nWhile career coaching typically focuses on supporting choices and making transformations associated with moving between jobs, it can also help us find a balance between multiple life domains (Yates, 2021).\n\nA career coach supports clients in defining their career goals and devising strategies to meet them while balancing other aspects of their lives (Kauffeld et al., 2022).\n\nThe following two models are helpful when considering and delivering change. These specific models can be transformational in career coaching.\n\nGROW Model\n\nJohn Whitmore’s (2009) model is a powerful tool for setting and working toward career goals.\n\nKey elements of the GROW coaching model include:\n\nGoal – Clients establish their goals.\n\nReality – They examine their reality.\n\nOptions – They explore the options for meeting their goals.\n\nWill – They affirm their commitment, or will, to do what is needed to move forward.\n\nOSCAR\n\nThis solution-focused model breaks down the process into a series of steps to understand the goal and context before capturing and finding a path toward the client’s career aspirations (Gilbert & Whittleworth, 2009).\n\nOutcome – Understand the desired outcome and the individual’s long-term goals.\n\nSituation – Help the client become aware of their skills, abilities, level of knowledge, and how they feel.\n\nChoices – What are the options for reaching the desired outcome?\n\nActions – Identify the improvements and how best to make them.\n\nReview – Hold regular check-ins to ensure the client is on track.\n\nThese and other coaching models are further described in our article 12 Effective Coaching Models to Help Your Clients Grow.\n\nCareer coaching vs. career counseling\n\nCareer coaching and career counseling inevitably overlap, covering similar challenges, setting comparable goals, and relying on one-on-one conversations (Passmore, 2021).\n\nHowever, counseling “involves a significant amount of time exploring issues in the past and present,” while coaching “encourages a stronger focus on the present and future” (Passmore, 2021, p. 5).\n\nExecutive vs. career coaching\n\nExecutive coaching is typically a subset of career coaching (Passmore, 2021).\n\n“At its simplest, executive coaching could be defined as coaching for senior, or C-suite, managers” (Passmore, 2021, p. 8).\n\nAnd yet, it can be more than that. Executive coaches support leadership development through a series of one-to-one reflective conversations, requiring significant trust, safety, and support (Passmore, 2021).\n\n3 Goals of career coaches\n\nCareer coaches supporting individuals facing an evolving career often focus on three goals (Kauffeld et al., 2022):\n\nAssessing the client’s potential for development in terms of their present career situation, goals, and competencies\n\nIncreasing the client’s “awareness of opportunities for professional development, challenges, and obstacles” (Kauffeld et al., 2022, p. 138)\n\nDeveloping the knowledge and skills required to take the appropriate next steps\n\nMost clients seeking a career coach’s support are either considering starting a new career or facing a forthcoming career transition — potentially outside their control (Kauffeld et al., 2022).\n\n9 Benefits of Career Coaching\n\nWhile there are many benefits to working with a career coach, the following positives are nine of our favorites (Kauffeld et al., 2022).\n\nClarity: Uncovering professional goals to ignite passion and creativity\n\nAdaptation: Shaping and realigning careers to fit evolving aspirations and needs\n\nInsight: Supporting confident, informed career decisions\n\nStrategy: Crafting a strategic roadmap for the next career chapter\n\nHarmony: Achieving a more manageable balance between work and personal life\n\nEmpowerment: Recognizing and honing career-relevant skills and strengths\n\nImpact: Mastering self-marketing to showcase talents and ambitions\n\nFulfillment: Creating more fulfilling, value-led roles\n\nThriving: Unleashing potential by connecting values and career pursuits\n\n4 Career Coaching Skills & Techniques\n\nCareer coaching draws practical techniques from several theoretical approaches, including Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Narrative Therapy, positive psychology, and Person-Centered Therapy (Cox, 2018).\n\nWhile each session may vary, the following are four typical coaching techniques that the career coach should be skilled at (Cox, 2018).\n\nConducting assessments\n\nThe coach must identify and help the client realize (and understand) their needs, values, and life domains.\n\nIt can help to understand the following:\n\nWhat is the client’s personal and family history of work?\n\nWhat values and life domains are most important to the client?\n\nPlanning\n\nIt is vital to identify the client’s current and goal (target) state. For example:\n\n“I am in sales but wish to move into marketing.”\n\nAlso, consider other commitments, such as timing and finances.\n\nDefining the exit criteria\n\nCareer coaching should have a clear end goal.\n\nConsider the following:\n\nHow will the client know when they are successful?\n\nAddress skill deficits\n\nThe client will probably require different or additional skills to perform a new role.\n\nIdentifying what is needed and taking action to address any deficits are vital.\n\nHow to Plan Your Sessions: 5 Templates\n\nThe role of the career coach involves planning and implementing the changes required for the client to reach their career goals.\n\nThey must plan their approach and continually re-assess whether they are meeting the client’s needs (Cox, 2018).\n\nStructuring the program and the sessions\n\nThere are many ways to design a coaching program. Use this Checklist for Building a Coaching Program to consider every aspect of your business and client offering.\n\nUse our Coaching Program Blueprint to help structure sessions and include all the necessary learning points and activities.\n\nBest intake forms for career coaches\n\nIntake forms are vital for identifying the client’s needs and situation.\n\nAdult Psychotherapy Intake Form\n\nWhile targeting clients in psychotherapy, this template can be tailored to the needs of a client entering career coaching.\n\nNew Client Intake Form\n\nThis useful form is meant to be completed before the first session, helping the career coach understand the client’s background and goals.\n\nEmployee Intake Form\n\nThis valuable form is for dealing with multiple clients in a workplace setting.\n\nCareer change\n\nCareer changes typically involve moving between jobs but can also include job crafting, where individuals shape their existing roles to make them more satisfying (Yates, 2021).\n\nEither way, career changing may require costly training and may briefly leave the individual feeling like they are professionally regressing.\n\nFor those experiencing layoffs, this can be particularly true. Along with facing their fears, they may experience a loss of confidence.\n\nCareer coaches help clients see such changes as opportunities with the potential to surface the other side happier and more engaged (Yates, 2021).\n\nReturn to work\n\nThis group often includes parents returning to their career and seeking help from a coach as they reach the end of a career break.\n\n“Family dynamics tend to be quite entrenched by this point, which often means that the stay-at-home parent expects to be the children’s primary carer, even after their return to work” (Yates, 2021, p. 284).\n\nCareer conversations often involve identifying priorities and are likely to include consideration of working hours, location, and flexibility.\n\nRetirement\n\nReaching the end of a career can feel scary, heading into uncharted territories where the individual must choose whether to stop and fully retire or do something they’ve always wished for (Yates, 2021).\n\nThe career coach will help the individual maintain or regain their self-confidence and consider what they wish to do next while considering their financial situation.\n\n12 Questions to Ask Your Coaching Clients\n\nHere are several questions exploring values, identifying personal resources, and generating job ideas (Yates, 2021).\n\n1. Questions to explore values\n\nWhat causes or issues are you most passionate about, and why?\n\nWhat impact or legacy would you like to leave behind?\n\nWhat are your top priorities in life, and how do they align with your career goals?\n\nWhat kind of work environment or company culture brings out the best in you?\n\n2. Questions to help identify personal resources\n\nWhat skills or abilities do you possess that others often recognize and appreciate?\n\nThink of a time when you faced a significant challenge. How did you overcome it, and what personal strengths did you rely on?\n\nWhat activities or tasks do you enjoy that make you lose track of time? What does that tell you about your natural talents?\n\nIn what ways do your personality traits contribute to your success in certain areas?\n\n3. Questions to generate job ideas\n\nWhat job would you choose if there were no limits, and why?\n\nWhat are your hobbies or interests outside of work?\n\nWhat entrepreneurial venture or business would you start if you had unlimited resources and support?\n\nReflect on times when you have felt the most excited and energized. Are there any job roles or industries that evoke similar feelings?\n\nThere are several considerations when choosing a career. The following exercises, tools, and worksheets can help.\n\nAssessment of Life and Career ‘Wants’\n\nThis assessment of life and career wants asks five questions to help clients consider their sense of purpose as they assess career opportunities.\n\nHow do your life experiences connect with and shape your career development?\n\nWhat makes your life meaningful?\n\nWhat sort of life would you like to build (for example, work–life balance, time spent traveling, etc.)?\n\nWhat would you like to express through your work?\n\nWhat aspects of work or ways of working allow you to come closest to expressing who you are?\n\nCareer Visualization\n\nBefore choosing a career direction, it’s helpful to consider our future selves.\n\nHow might it look, feel, and be like if we took the path we have been thinking about and had the career of our dreams (Yates, 2021)?\n\nUse the Career Visualization worksheet with your clients to explore those dreams.\n\nFIRST Framework Questions\n\nUse the FIRST framework to understand the client’s current developmental stage.\n\nFocus: How far have you narrowed down your career options?\n\nInformation: How well informed are you about the career options you have in mind?\n\nRealism: How realistic do you think you are regarding your abilities and external constraints (for example, the job market)?\n\nScope: How aware are you of the range of options available?\n\nTactics: How far have you worked out the practical steps to reach your career objective(s)?\n\nThe answers will help the career coach assess where the client is on their career path.\n\nA Note on Using Online Platforms and Apps\n\nTo avoid spending too much time on administrative tasks and taking focus away from clients, using digitization can create the opportunity to automate and scale up your career coaching business.\n\nWhile there are other coaching platforms available, Quenza has been developed by psychologists, therapists, and coaches to provide a powerful and easy-to-use tool to:\n\nIncrease engagement with clients through sending online exercises, activities, and meditations\n\nInspire clients with automatically timed motivational content, including videos, podcast links, and articles\n\nTrack activity completion and identify where extra focus is required\n\nAutomatically collect feedback to improve and refine the service offering\n\nCrucially, services can be turned into products for increased reach and profitability.\n\nBest Resources From PositivePsychology.com\n\nWe have many resources available for career coaches supporting individuals and groups entering, leaving, or moving within the workplace.\n\nLet’s start with a resource aspiring career coaches would find most useful:\n\nHow to Become a Career Coach: 12 Certifications & Courses\n\nOur free resources include the following:\n\nCareer Counseling Evaluation\n\nBy asking the client to rate each of the statements, the career coach can improve existing and future interventions.\n\nCareer Action Plan\n\nWhen moving toward career aspirations, it is helpful to break larger goals into smaller tasks and actions.\n\nMore extensive versions of the following tools are available with a subscription to the Positive Psychology Toolkit©, but they are briefly described below.\n\nPriority Dartboard\n\nOur working life can be hectic. Being busy does not always mean being productive, especially if we focus on the wrong tasks.\n\nTry out the following four steps to improve performance in the workplace:\n\nStep one – List all the tasks on your to-do list.\n\nStep two – Prioritize each one. How urgent and how important is it?\n\nStep three – Draw an outline of a dartboard and add the tasks. Put the most urgent and important ones near the center.\n\nStep four – Plan your day, week, and month around those tasks nearest the center of the dartboard.\n\nThe Five Ps of Job Preference\n\nWhen we make career changes, we must clearly understand what we are looking for.\n\nConsidering the five Ps can help:\n\nPeople – Who would you like to work with (if anyone)?\n\nPlace – Where would you like to work?\n\nProjects – What projects and tasks do you prefer?\n\nProcess – What are your desired ways of working?\n\nPowers – What strengths and skills do you like to use at work?\n\nReflect on the answers to the coaching questions and consider what insights they offer regarding career choice.\n\nA Take-Home Message\n\nWhether preparing for a first job, feeling stuck in a current role, or facing layoffs or retirement, a career coach can help.\n\nUnlike counselors, career coaches typically focus on present and future goals and how to achieve them.\n\nIn doing so, they consider the values and life domains critical to the client and support them in finding the right work–life balance and a role that fosters engagement and interest.\n\nThere are plenty of tools to help career coaches and their clients, including the GROW and the OSCAR models, which help break down important, daunting goals into more manageable chunks.\n\nAs a result, clients find new ways to balance their work and personal life, reconnect their work with their values, and create clarity and direction for their careers.\n\nWhy not try some of the tools discussed in the article? Create a path of interventions that help clients visualize potential careers and identify values and strengths that can support their professional transformation.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this article.
