        "text": "Karen Cross\n\nSr Enrollment Counselor II\n\n“I have been in the higher education field as an Enrollment Counselor for about 15 years, and almost 6 years of those years have been here at ACE. ACE is by far the best place I have ever worked and I honestly love my job for two major reasons. The first reason is that ACE truly puts students first and I am proud to stand behind and support every aspect of this college. The second reason is that I feel valued here, my ideas and suggestions are received and often put into place. ACE’s leaders, across all departments are what all industries are looking for. They are transformative leaders who create an environment of trust, appreciation, and success for each individual staff, for the many teams within various departments, and for the college as a whole.”\n\nBianca Stakes\n\nMarketing Content and Communications Specialist\n\n“Working at ACE is a special balance of excellence, service, and fun. We actively take steps as an organization and unified front to develop as employees, and this directly strengthens our unwavering commitment to providing an affordable, flexible, and high-quality education. This dedication sparks action in our students and communities to make the world a better place.”\n\nMarsha J. Phelps, MBA, EdD\n\nSenior Core Faculty, Department of Educational Leadership\n\n“As a faculty member at ACE, I take great joy in functioning as a positive and vital force within our societal framework. I am excited daily by the thought that our core values—values that guide our actions 24/7—have the potential to exponentially enhance the quality of life for students everywhere.”\n\nSandra Quiatkowski\n\nDirector, ACE Library\n\n“I truly love my job at ACE! Out of all of the companies and institutions where I have held a position, this is my absolute favorite place to work. ACE provides opportunities for growth and development, as well as encouraging me to use my prior knowledge and experience to do my very best. I feel that my opinions and ideas are valued.”"
