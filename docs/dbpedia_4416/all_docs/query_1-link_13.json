        "text": "A career crossroads refers to a point in a person’s professional career where they are forced to decide their next move. A crossroads can occur in anyone’s career path as circumstances change and events occur, which may cause you to reevaluate your job role. They can also happen periodically as a person’s drives and interests change over time. It is entirely normal for someone to change jobs at least three times throughout their working life, facing two major crossroads in that time. Perhaps you require a higher salary to support your family, or you may be required to relocate. You may want to move up to a more senior position. Whatever the reason, career crossroads are typical and easy to overcome with the right tools and guidance.\n\nHow to Tell if You’re at a Crossroads in Your Career\n\nIt can be challenging to know whether you are at a career crossroads. It can be a particularly confusing time as you find yourself feeling unsure about what your next move should be. Career crossroads are recognisable by a feeling of either wanting or being required to make a significant change in your career. This can be a daunting moment as the decision you make has the potential to change your life going forward.\n\nThere are a few signs to look out for that indicate that you have reached a crossroads in your career:\n\nFeeling unfulfilled in your current job role\n\nFeeling you are stuck in your position\n\nFeeling undervalued by your current employer\n\nFeeling as though there is more out there\n\nThe Benefits of Changing Career\n\nChanging the direction of your career from time to time can actually benefit you in the long run. Although it may seem frightening or unnecessary to some, if you feel as though you need more fulfilment or variety in your work, then a career change can provide this for you. Career crossroads can be a valuable part of your working life and a great contributor to your career development.\n\nIf you are wondering whether or not to take the leap and change your career path, here are some key advantages:\n\nIt’s an opportunity to gain more knowledge & experience\n\nIt helps to broaden your network\n\nIt increases opportunities for higher salary positions\n\nHaving a variety of skills & expertise increases employee value\n\nMistakes to Avoid at a Career Crossroads\n\nBeing faced with a career crossroads can be an overwhelming experience. The feelings of anxiety that come with this can potentially lead people to make the wrong decision. While every situation is unique to the individual, certain mistakes are often made when someone finds themselves at a crossroads. When people act out of fear of an uncertain outcome, they risk missing out on what is potentially an excellent opportunity for self-development and a change of routine.\n\nHere are the career crossroad mistakes to avoid:\n\nThinking you must make a huge change – a crossroads doesn’t always involve a drastic career change.\n\nThinking that changing job roles/ employers is always the answer – changing employment without a second thought can be risky.\n\nLetting doubt & fear prevent you from making a change – making no decision is often worse than making the wrong decision.\n\nHow to Know if You’re Making the Right Decision\n\nNow you know what not to do when faced with a big career decision; you may feel at a loss when it comes to knowing if you’ve made the right choice. Thankfully, there are some good indicators to help reassure you and help you move forward with whatever decision you’ve made.\n\nAre You Putting Your Needs First?\n\nThis may seem obvious because the situation involves your career. However, many people often make a decision based on external factors. This can make them feel forced to make a decision based on the needs of others and not their own. For instance, if your family is struggling to make ends meet, you may feel you need to switch to a job with a higher salary, whether or not it is something you are passionate about.\n\nSeeking Guidance & Support\n\nOne of the best ways to know you have dealt with your career crossroads correctly is if you have sought support or guidance from others. Not only can sharing your predicament with someone help you make a well thought out decision but offloading some of the stress and anxiety that comes with the situation can help provide clarity. Seeking advice from a colleague, boss, or career coach will reassure you that you have explored every possible option available.\n\nYou Have Explored Each Possibility\n\nThousands of job roles are available, so you don’t have to worry about a one-size-fits-all approach. It can often feel like you have limited options based on your skills and experience. If you are looking for a new direction in your career, you must keep an open mind. It is not as black and white as picking one job or another. Actively putting yourself out there to explore your options will put you in the best possible position going forward.\n\nYou Can Envision Yourself Where You Want to Be\n\nA good indicator that you have made a good choice at a career crossroads is when your career move and goals for the future align. Taking your time for introspection and exploration will help you to get a clearer idea of the direction you want your life and career to be headed. Considering why your current job is no longer satisfying you and determining what will provide that fulfillment will help you achieve this. Visualise your ideal life and use this to influence your decision making.\n\nMoving Forward"
