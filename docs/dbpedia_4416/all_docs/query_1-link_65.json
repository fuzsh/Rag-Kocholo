        "text": "Assurance services are more than an examination of a company's business—they’re an opportunity to take a global view of an organization, evaluating a company’s overall financial and operational performance to help solve complex business challenges.\n\nAs part of the assurance team, you’ll gain experience performing the following services:\n\nConduct engagement planning, process and controls testing, audit procedures, analytical reviews, and accounting research, as well as draft financial statements, disclosures, and other reports\n\nWork with seasoned professionals who provide clients with the information and tools they need to achieve their operational, compliance, and financial reporting goals\n\nDeliver business process control services in areas such as internal audit, construction audit, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance, royalty compliance, and government contracting\n\nHelp clients implement effective and efficient processes and controls needed to mitigate internal and external organization threats and exposures\n\nCredits & Incentives\n\nFederal, state, and local governments constantly seek ways to stimulate economic development and investment. One lever used frequently is tax credits and other incentives designed to foster innovative research and development, keep businesses in certain jurisdictions, or give them a reason to move to those jurisdictions.\n\nOn these teams, you’ll help companies apply and qualify for credits and incentives; ultimately, discovering opportunities to save clients money on federal, state, and local taxes and turn what would have been tax expenditures into positive cash flow to help grow their business.\n\nInternational Tax\n\nMany companies have some form of activity outside their national jurisdiction, whether it's foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures, international suppliers, or import-export relationships. These arrangements can provide distinct competitive advantages, but also create challenges for organizations to remain in compliance, reduce risk to individual employees and the company, and succeed in the marketplace. On the International Tax team, you’ll help companies understand the international components of their overall business operations and enhance their value.\n\nState & Local Tax\n\nOur team provides a variety of state tax consulting services, including but not limited to, income and franchise tax, sales and use tax, property tax, and tax controversy representation. With a large multistate Tax Practice, our State & Local Tax team helps clients across industries remain in compliance and reduce their tax burden.\n\nOur team of tax, family office, and investment advisory practitioners work together to help families, executives, and business owners plan for the future and achieve their goals. As part of Moss Adams, you’ll have the opportunity to work with clients that are doing amazing things: writing the next chapters in their family stories, building companies, creating legacies, and impacting communities.\n\nWe have several different technical tracks within our wealth management team. Common among them is a vision for collaborating to meet our clients’ needs and to learn and grow with each other and positively impact client outcomes through multiple perspectives and technical disciplines.\n\nThrough Moss Adams Wealth Advisors LLC, we provide clients with comprehensive financial planning and investment management solutions. We work with clients to understand their current financial situation and risks, help them establish and prioritize their goals, determine an investing strategy, and help them execute their plan along the way. Within this practice area there are two distinct tracks: one as a financial advisor working with clients to plan and advise through their wealth journey and a second in investment management that focuses on implementing and monitoring client investing strategies.\n\nOur financial advisory team works with clients to discover and claim their future. We believe achieving financial goals happens through diligent planning—not by chance. Our financial advisors guide clients through a comprehensive planning process that helps them articulate or refine their financial goals, gain a detailed understanding of their current financial situation, evaluate risks, develop an investing strategy, and execute and monitor their plan along the way. Common goals often include financial independence or lifestyle maintenance, family and legacy planning, business transition planning, managing equity compensation or concentrated stock positions, and wealth building and preservation. Mostly commonly, individuals in this career path will obtain a CFP® credential as part of their career journey.\n\nCertified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. (CFP Board) owns the CFP® certification mark, the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification mark, and the CFP® certification mark (with plaque design) logo in the United States, which it authorizes use of by individuals who successfully complete CFP Board’s initial and ongoing certification requirements.\n\nThe Deal Advisory Services team helps clients navigate complex business challenges surrounding their deal cycle, whether it’s a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or business spin-off.\n\nWe provide financial analysis, due diligence, valuations, and M&A tax services. Our team works closely with clients to understand their unique business objectives and develop tailored strategies to increase value and reduce risk. Working with a middle-market client base will allow you to make a tangible impact and see your strategies come to life by directly contributing to our clients’ growth and success.\n\nDue Diligence\n\nOur Financial Due Diligence team is dynamic and works alongside private equity firms, strategic clients, and investment banks to perform buy-side and sell-side due diligence as well as other M&A activities across a variety of industry groups.\n\nM&A Tax\n\nWe provide clients with tax due diligence, tax structuring, quantitative tax modeling services, transaction agreement review and consultation and tax technical support.\n\nValuations\n\nThe Business Valuations team combines financial expertise, analytical skills, and industry knowledge to deliver accurate and insightful valuation reports.\n\nThe Outsourced Finance & Accounting (OFA) team helps businesses operate more effectively, make better decisions, and spend less time on accounting and financial operations. We provide outsourced services through a cloud-based technology stack designed to serve the client and their industry.\n\nOur services are designed to meet the client’s needs and can include support for accounts payable, fixed assets, bank and balance sheet account reconciliations, and month-end activities. Our goal is to be seen as an integral member of the client’s team and an advisor to their business operations.\n\nIn an increasingly complex regulatory environment, compliance risk management is essential, whether to meet statutory requirements, adhere to practices in corporate governance, or reduce reputational risk. On the Risk Advisory & Compliance team, you’ll work with clients in three specific areas:\n\nIT Compliance\n\nOur IT Compliance team focuses on compliance around technology supporting financial compliance, ranging from internal financial audits, public company audit requirements, to IT internal control validation and audits for businesses processes and technology.\n\nDay-to-day work on this team involves assessing internal controls, mitigating risks, conducting IT audit reviews, and implementing controls to promote compliance with regulatory requirements and industry practices. This team works in close contact with our firm’s Assurance and Internal Audit teams. Junior team members could be exposed to both System and Organization Control (SOC) Examination and IT Compliance engagements.\n\nSOC Examinations\n\nThis team performs System and Organization Control (SOC) examinations for service organizations. They have direct interactions with clients who range in size from start-up to enterprise. Those who join this team will perform testing of security, IT, and business process controls as well as assist throughout all stages of SOC projects from initial client acceptance to on-the-ground reporting, through to final report issuance.\n\nInternal Audit\n\nInternal audits help clients achieve reliable financial reporting and regulatory compliance. As part of our internal audit team, you’ll help clients with both tasks while navigating risk through internal audits, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) consulting and compliance, process and control improvement, and internal controls reviews.\n\nYou’ll also help businesses mitigate the risk of fraud by evaluating the quality and effectiveness of their controls, providing solutions to improve their responses to warning signs, and lending your expertise to forensic investigations.\n\nIf you’re interested in pursuing a degree—and a career—in accounting, we invite you to apply for our 2024 Ignite Diversity Scholarship (ID: 26385).

The GPS Operational Internship is a six-week rotational internship with many of the departments that successfully maintain firm operations.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nAfter completing a GPS Operational internship, you could be eligible to receive a client service internship offer, which could eventually lead to an offer to join Moss Adams full time.\n\nEligibility\n\nStudents who demonstrate a strong commitment to diversity in their school or community through student clubs and organizations, community groups, mentoring, or more should apply for GPS. This internship is for students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, LGBTQ+ individuals, military veterans, and people with disabilities.\n\nLaunch your career through these eight to 10-week internships, which provide robust training and mentoring. Winter/spring internships typically run from January to late March; summer internships are mid-June to mid-August. You’ll leave with skills that apply to many routes within accounting, whether that’s assurance, tax, or consulting.\n\nAfter completing your internship, you’ll understand the expectations of our staff—receiving insight into the exciting future that awaits after you graduate. Read about our career paths in accounting, consulting, and wealth management above.\n\nThese internships kick off with a training program. Our summer interns attend a firmwide summer internship program (SIP) in Southern California.

Through it all, you won’t get lost in the ranks. Instead, you’ll see the big picture early on and gain exposure to a wide array of industries.\n\nStarting your career as an entry level staff will get you where you want to go, fast.\n\nEach year, Moss Adams sponsors Project Run With It. This is an opportunity for members and candidates of Beta Alpha Psi—the international honor organization for financial information students and professionals—to gain real-world consulting experience and provide meaningful community service to not-for-profit organizations.\n\nEach participating not-for-profit organization presents its business challenges and answers questions for selected students during the Beta Alpha Psi annual meeting. Afterward, students have about 24 hours to develop strategies and formal presentations that showcase a solution for their assigned not-for-profit. The organization’s leaders, faculty members, and a panel of Moss Adams judges choose a winning team for each of the cases presented. Each Beta Alpha Psi chapter represented on the winning teams receives $1,000.\n\nProject Run With It is a unique opportunity to experience what client service is really like. You’ll tackle genuine business issues in real time with a team of like-minded students, gaining critical experience while contributing meaningfully to a not-for-profit organization’s success.
