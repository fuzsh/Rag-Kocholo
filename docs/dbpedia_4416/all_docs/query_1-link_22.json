        "text": "An after-school job is a part-time job and a great way for a student to gain experience. You can make connections with people, and learn what the working world is all about.\n\nMany teens work part-time jobs after school to start saving money for college. Others save for a car or other large expenses. Being able to save money is an important life skill that benefits everyone. Along with instant “spending money,” having a job after school can teach students how to save and set financial goals for themselves.\n\nWith an after-school, part-time job, you can take the skills learned and continue to use them through college, or whatever you choose to do after high school.\n\nYou may want to consider cooperative education when you are interested in working for the same company over an extended period throughout your time in school. A co-op position will require you to work full time, and you will usually stay with the same company the entire time you are in school.\n\nCo-op programs can be offered with two different types of schedules: alternating and parallel. Alternating schedules require you to work for one semester and attend classes during the next semester. Parallel schedules allow you to work and attend classes part-time during the same semester.\n\nAs you progress in your education, the responsibilities you have in your co-op program will likely increase as well.\n\nDifferences between internships and apprenticeships include:\n\nLength of Time: Internships are usually short term (1-3 months) and apprenticeships are longer term (1-3 years).\n\nStructure: Apprenticeships include a structured training plan, with a focus on mastering specific skills an employer needs to fill an occupation within their organization. Internships aren’t structured and often focus on entry-level general work experience.\n\nMentorship: Apprentices receive individualized training with an experienced mentor who walks them through their entire process. Internships do not always include mentorship.\n\nPay: Apprenticeships are paid experiences that often lead to full-time employment. Internships are often unpaid and may not lead to a full-time job.\n\nCredential: Apprenticeships lead to an industry-recognized credential. Internships typically do not lead to a credential.\n\nCollege Credit: Internship and apprenticeship experiences may both lead to college credit, although some apprenticeship programs will lead to a debt-free college degree.\n\nApprenticeship, a blend of on and off-the-job learning, is an attractive way of learning as it simultaneously enhances development of skills and prepares for jobs and careers.\n\nInternship, The responsibilities you will be given during an internship program can vary but often include several entry-level tasks. Regardless of the level of responsibility you are given in an internship program, you will likely spend a good amount of your time in the program shadowing senior-level professionals who can teach you new things and help you develop the skills most important to their role.\n\nWhen you I.G.N.I.T.E. something generally it means to activate, kick-start, or to begin a transformation.\n\nWe believe that I.G.N.I.T.E is a set of character qualities that students can have in the workplace that make individuals good at their job. These same character traits can be applied in life as students progress into adulthood."
