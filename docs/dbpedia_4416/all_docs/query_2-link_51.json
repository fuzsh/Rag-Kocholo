Suggest having the battery load tested to see if is even viable................\n\nIf the battery checks out OK, I’d get a multi meter and start looking at how much current draw there is at the battery with the engine off. Should be 40-60 mAh, if it is higher, you have a parasitic drain that needs to be located.\n\n__________________\n\nAnything really new is invented only in ones youth.

A load test is always the \"proof positive\" test for battery condition and will single out an otherwise fine appearing battery.\n\nYes, you can disconnect the ignition switch if you want, but you should recognize that not all of the car's electrical circuits pass through it; you can still have a parasitic drain that by-passes it, so I am not sure what you will learn by removing it.\n\nNot to be repetitive, but the correct diagnostic path way is to place a multi meter between the positive battery cable and the battery, then read the current draw. If it exceeds 40-60 mAh, you need to start pulling circuit fuses one at a time until you find the one pulling the power; that is your problem area............. If the current draw is in spec, your battery is likely toast\n\n__________________\n\nAnything really new is invented only in ones youth.

Same basic issue. The culprit turned out to be the ignition switch just as you suspect.\n\nMy mechanic put a battery meter on the car. My car was drawing something like 1800 mAh. The car is supposed to have a draw of around 30!\n\nHe was fiddling with the fuses (remove one at a time until the problem is identified).\n\nCheck out your frunk & rear trunk light. Does it go out when you close the trunk?\n\nMy problem turned out to be the very dim amber light in the cabin. It is supposed to go out after a few minutes, but it never went out. A new ignition switch (around $200 installed) did the trick.\n\nGood luck.\n\n/\n\n__________________\n\nSOLD - 2002 Boxster S - PSM, Litronics, De-ambered, Bird Bike Rack, Hardtop, RMS leak..."
