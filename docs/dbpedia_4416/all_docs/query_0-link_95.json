        "text": "OnStar may be able to provide Vehicle Location Assistance* in emergency situations where law enforcement is treating a vehicle as stolen or trying to find a missing person. Law enforcement involvement is required, and will be verified, before providing the vehicle’s location to public safety only. Public safety is encouraged to contact OnStar on the dedicated public safety number 1.866.866.5006 with the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to confirm how OnStar can assist in the beginning of the report process to begin location attempts as soon as possible.\n\nStolen Vehicle Assistance\n\nOnStar Stolen Vehicle Assistance* continues to have the most comprehensive in-vehicle security service available. With industry-leading technologies, such as Remote Ignition Block™ and Stolen Vehicle Slowdown®, public safety can rely on OnStar as a partner to assist with the quick and safe recovery of stolen vehicles.\n\nThere are two typical scenarios for initiating Stolen Vehicle Assistance, depending on which party contacts OnStar.\n\nA vehicle owner contacts OnStar after a vehicle has been stolen. OnStar then links the vehicle owner with law enforcement to initiate a report or confirm if one has been started.\n\nIn the second scenario, law enforcement contacts OnStar after the owner reports the vehicle as stolen. OnStar then contacts the ECC to verify the report before providing the location to law enforcement.\n\nOnStar can pinpoint the location of the stolen vehicle using GPS technology and aerial imagery, then provides this information to authorities. Advisors may also provide the direction of travel and speed the vehicle is traveling.\n\nAn OnStar Advisor can send a Remote Ignition Block signal to the stolen vehicle, preventing it from being restarted once the engine has been turned off.\n\nIf the vehicle is still running, the Advisor can activate Stolen Vehicle Slowdown once law enforcement confirms clear sight of the vehicle and indicates conditions are appropriate. The vehicle will slow down to an idle speed of 3–5 mph with steering and braking functions intact.\n\nOnce recovered by law enforcement, an Advisor may need to send a signal to restore the vehicle's services so it can resume normal driving operations.\n\nMissing persons\n\nThere may be emergency situations that do not involve a stolen vehicle where public safety officials request OnStar assistance in determining vehicle location involving a missing person. Situations include individuals who may be suicidal, endangered or have dementia/Alzheimer's. OnStar will attempt to locate a vehicle for this purpose.\n\nOnStar requires a missing person report be initiated for these situations in order to work with law enforcement to help locate the vehicle of the missing person.\n\nLaw enforcement must also confirm the vehicle location is not being sought for any other purpose. If an individual is missing, but also under criminal investigation, law enforcement must provide a court order before OnStar can assist. (See Criminal Investigations.)\n\nIn life-threatening situations, such as a carjacking or kidnapping, OnStar will immediately contact Law Enforcement and begin attempts to locate the vehicle.\n\nQuestions and additional information can be obtained by contacting our dedicated public safety number 1.866.866.5006, prompt 2.\n\nThis section describes what OnStar requires to disclose the following categories of OnStar Member (“Member”) information in the United States. In accordance with our terms, conditions, policies, and applicable law, OnStar will review each request individually to assess the circumstances and the nature of the request before providing any Member information.\n\nVEHICLE LOCATION AND CONTENTS OF ONSTAR COMMUNICATIONS\n\nIf available, OnStar may supply vehicle location and contents of communications subject to:\n\nA warrant or court order supported by a showing of probable cause; or\n\nMember consent.\n\nBASIC MEMBER INFORMATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: NAME, ADDRESS, AND LENGTH OF SERVICE)\n\nIf available, OnStar may supply basic Member information subject to:\n\nA warrant or comparable court order supported by probable cause;\n\nA court order issued under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d);\n\nAn administrative, grand jury, or trial subpoena; or\n\nMember consent.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE THE CONTENTS OF COMMUNICATIONS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: DATES OF ALERTS, VEHICLE INFORMATION, CRASH DATA, AND LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS)\n\nIf available, OnStar may supply other information subject to:\n\nA warrant or comparable court order supported by a showing of probable cause;\n\nA court order issued under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d); or\n\nMember consent.\n\nREQUESTS FOR INTERCEPTIONS OR REAL-TIME ACCESS TO CALL-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n\nOnStar is not able to facilitate interceptions of communications or real-time access to call-identifying information. In the United States, such requests should be directed to AT&T.\n\nHow to request information\n\nTo the extent OnStar is able to provide information as described above, you may serve a request for information through OnStar’s registered agent, Corporation Service Company (CSC). You can obtain a local address for CSC by calling 1.888.690.2882.\n\nFor proper routing, address requests in the following format:\n\nTo: OnStar LLC, C/O CSC [Insert address provided by CSC]\n\nWhen you submit a request, please include:\n\nThe date and time of the relevant occurrence(s);\n\nA description of the information you are seeking (e.g., vehicle location or account records); and\n\nThe associated legal basis for your request.\n\nIf your request involves an OnStar Good Samaritan call, please provide:\n\nThe date of the call; and\n\nThe OnStar case number provided to 911 dispatch by OnStar.\n\nTo help OnStar comply with your request, please provide the following information (if available):\n\nFull name;\n\nMailing address including ZIP code;\n\nPhone number;\n\nOnStar account number;\n\nVehicle identification number (including year, make, and model).\n\nCall recordings\n\nOnStar does not create or provide transcripts of audio recordings, and OnStar cannot guarantee that any audio recording was taken at the time of a call or that it can be retrieved, given OnStar’s limited retention of such audio recordings. OnStar may, upon written request, be able to preserve available information until you can obtain appropriate legal process.\n\nConsistent with 18 USC 2702(b)(8), (c)(4), OnStar may act in good faith when OnStar believes that an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure without delay of communications relating to the emergency.\n\nCrisis Assist* provides Members access to many OnStar services in the event of a weather emergency, natural disaster, power outage, hazardous materials spill, and other types of man-made or natural crisis situations. Regardless of their current plan, these services are at no additional cost to the Member to help them stay safe. This includes situational information, assistance with evacuation or alternate routes, identifying available hotels and making hotel reservations, finding open shelters, connecting Members to emergency services or loved ones, etc.\n\nOnStar's Command Center monitors severe weather and disaster activity across North America 24/7, so we are prepared to assist Members and public safety professionals at a moment's notice. The Command Center works to gather relevant situational information from emergency management and response organizations to share with our Advisors to facilitate support of Members' needs. When an OnStar Advisor receives a call from a Member, Advisors are notified of crisis activity occurring in the vicinity of the Member's location and provide guidance, as needed."
