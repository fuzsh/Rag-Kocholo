As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in NRS 608.009 to 608.0126, inclusive, have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1985, 577; A 2017, 4178)\n\nNRS 608.009 Domestic service employee defined. Domestic service employee means an employee who performs any household service in or about a private residence or any other location at which a person resides.

It is unlawful for any person by force, intimidation, threat of procuring dismissal from employment or in any other manner to induce or attempt to induce an employee to refrain from testifying in any investigation or proceeding relating to or arising under this chapter, or to discharge or penalize any employee for so testifying.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1975, 1582)\n\nNRS 608.0155 Persons presumed to be independent contractor.\n\n1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, for the purposes of this chapter, a person is conclusively presumed to be an independent contractor if:\n\n(a) Unless the person is a foreign national who is legally present in the United States, the person possesses or has applied for an employer identification number or social security number or has filed an income tax return for a business or earnings from self-employment with the Internal Revenue Service in the previous year;\n\n(b) The person is required by the contract with the principal to hold any necessary state business license or local business license and to maintain any necessary occupational license, insurance or bonding in order to operate in this State; and\n\n(c) The person satisfies three or more of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Notwithstanding the exercise of any control necessary to comply with any statutory, regulatory or contractual obligations, the person has control and discretion over the means and manner of the performance of any work and the result of the work, rather than the means or manner by which the work is performed, is the primary element bargained for by the principal in the contract.\n\n(2) Except for an agreement with the principal relating to the completion schedule, range of work hours or, if the work contracted for is entertainment, the time such entertainment is to be presented, the person has control over the time the work is performed.\n\n(3) The person is not required to work exclusively for one principal unless:\n\n(I) A law, regulation or ordinance prohibits the person from providing services to more than one principal; or\n\n(II) The person has entered into a written contract to provide services to only one principal for a limited period.\n\n(4) The person is free to hire employees to assist with the work.\n\n(5) The person contributes a substantial investment of capital in the business of the person, including, without limitation, the:\n\n(I) Purchase or lease of ordinary tools, material and equipment regardless of source;\n\n(II) Obtaining of a license or other permission from the principal to access any work space of the principal to perform the work for which the person was engaged; and\n\n(III) Lease of any work space from the principal required to perform the work for which the person was engaged.\n\nÊ The determination of whether an investment of capital is substantial for the purpose of this subparagraph must be made on the basis of the amount of income the person receives, the equipment commonly used and the expenses commonly incurred in the trade or profession in which the person engages.\n\n2. A natural person is conclusively presumed to be an independent contractor if the person is a contractor or subcontractor licensed pursuant to chapter 624 of NRS or is directly compensated by a contractor or subcontractor licensed pursuant to chapter 624 of NRS for providing labor for which a license pursuant to chapter 624 of NRS is required to perform and:\n\n(a) The person has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of the services, both under his or her contract of service and in fact;\n\n(b) The service is either outside the usual course of the business for which the service is performed or that the service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprises for which the service is performed; and\n\n(c) The service is performed in the course of an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business in which the person is customarily engaged, of the same nature as that involved in the contract of service.\n\n3. The fact that a person is not conclusively presumed to be an independent contractor for failure to satisfy three or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of subsection 1 does not automatically create a presumption that the person is an employee.\n\n4. As used in this section:\n\n(a) Foreign national has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 294A.325.\n\n(b) Providing labor does not include the delivery of supplies.\n\n(Added to NRS by 2015, 1743; A 2019, 3159)\n\nPAYMENT AND COLLECTION OF WAGES AND OTHER BENEFITS\n\nNRS 608.016 Payment for each hour of work; trial or break-in period not excepted.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, wages or compensation paid to an employee whose duties include the manufacture of an explosive, or the use, processing, handling, on-site movement or storage of an explosive that is related to its manufacture, must be based solely on the number of hours the employee works.

It is unlawful for any employer to discriminate between employees, employed within the same establishment, on the basis of sex by paying lower wages to one employee than the wages paid to an employee of the opposite sex who performs equal work which requires equal skill, effort and responsibility and which is performed under similar working conditions.\n\n2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply where wages are paid pursuant to:\n\n(a) A seniority system;\n\n(b) A merit system;\n\n(c) A compensation system under which wages are determined by the quality or quantity of production; or\n\n(d) A wage differential based on factors other than sex.\n\n3.

An employer shall pay 1 1/2 times an employees regular wage rate whenever an employee who receives compensation for employment at a rate not less than 1 1/2 times the minimum rate set forth in NRS 608.250 works more than 40 hours in any scheduled week of work.\n\n3. The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 do not apply to:\n\n(a) Employees who are not covered by the minimum wage provisions of Section 16 of Article 15 of the Nevada Constitution;\n\n(b) Outside buyers;\n\n(c) Employees in a retail or service business if their regular rate is more than 1 1/2 times the minimum wage, and more than half their compensation for a representative period comes from commissions on goods or services, with the representative period being, to the extent allowed pursuant to federal law, not less than 1 month;\n\n(d) Employees who are employed in bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacities;\n\n(e) Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements which provide otherwise for overtime;\n\n(f) Drivers, drivers helpers, loaders and mechanics for motor carriers subject to the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, as amended;\n\n(g) Employees of a railroad;\n\n(h) Employees of a carrier by air;\n\n(i) Drivers or drivers helpers making local deliveries and paid on a trip-rate basis or other delivery payment plan;\n\n(j) Drivers of taxicabs or limousines;\n\n(k) Agricultural employees;\n\n(l) Employees of business enterprises having a gross sales volume of less than $250,000 per year;\n\n(m) Any salesperson or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks or farm equipment;\n\n(n) A mechanic or worker for any hours to which the provisions of subsection 3 or 4 of NRS 338.020 apply;\n\n(o) A domestic worker who resides in the household where he or she works if the domestic worker and his or her employer agree in writing to exempt the domestic worker from the requirements of subsections 1 and 2; and\n\n(p) A domestic service employee who resides in the household where he or she works if the domestic service employee and his or her employer agree in writing to exempt the domestic service employee from the requirements of subsections 1 and 2.\n\n4. Any regulation of the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services concerning the payment of overtime to a home care employee adopted pursuant to NRS 608.670 prevails over the general provisions of this section.\n\n5. As used in this section:\n\n(a) Domestic worker has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 613.620.\n\n(b) Home care employee has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 608.530.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1975, 1583; A 1977, 1373; 1985, 578; 2003, 1742; 2005, 2520; 2009, 2493; 2017, 3886, 4178; 2019, 3746; 2021, 3659)\n\nNRS 608.019 Periods for meals and rest.\n\n1.

The duration of the rest periods shall be based on the total hours worked daily at the rate of 10 minutes for each 4 hours or major fraction thereof. Rest periods need not be authorized however for employees whose total daily work time is less than 3 and one-half hours. Authorized rest periods shall be counted as hours worked, for which there shall be no deduction from wages.\n\n3. This section does not apply to:\n\n(a) Situations where only one person is employed at a particular place of employment.\n\n(b) Employees included within the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.\n\n4. An employer may apply to the Labor Commissioner for an exemption from providing to all or to one or more defined categories of his or her employees one or more of the benefits conferred by this section. The Labor Commissioner may grant the exemption if the Labor Commissioner believes the employer has shown sufficient evidence that business necessity precludes providing such benefits. Any exemption so granted shall apply to members of either sex.\n\n5. The Labor Commissioner may by regulation exempt a defined category of employers from providing to all or to one or more defined categories of their employees one or more of the benefits conferred by this section, upon the Labor Commissioners own motion or upon the application of an association of employers. Each such application shall be considered at a hearing and may be granted if the Labor Commissioner finds that business necessity precludes providing that particular benefit or benefits to the employees affected. Any exemption so granted shall apply to members of either sex.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1975, 1583; A 1977, 82)\n\nNRS 608.0193 Employer required to provide break time to express breast milk; compensation pursuant to collective bargaining agreement; reasonable alternative to alleviate undue hardship; retaliation prohibited; exceptions.\n\n1.
