But, you have to take into account that the oil filters on most cars today have been downsized from the previously “standard” quart-sized filter to a pint-sized filter. At that capacity, the oil filters in today’s vehicles won’t perform well if you wait until a second oil change.\n\nEvery oil change service here at Lamb’s Tire & Automotive includes an oil filter change. Schedule your appointment today for a high-quality oil and filter change, along with a multi-point vehicle inspection.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of having my tires rotated?\n\nWhat are the signs that I might need my car’s AC system serviced?\n\nHow do I know if I need new tires?"
