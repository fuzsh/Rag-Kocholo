When I go out to turn the truck on and warm her up in the morning the key is VERY hard to turn in the ignition, almost to the point where I am afraid I may break the key off or bend it.\n\nsecondary cause : is magnesium housing , & steel & brass tumblers & springs all contract / get closer together at colder temps. hence binding may occur\n\nPrimary cause : Toyota Installs a type of Dielectric type grease at factory , also either a PO or maybe u has with good intentions Lubed the Key Cylinder w/ a type of Lube that coagulates under cold conditions climate , such as white Lithium spray grease or Red spray grease for example , this will cause rotational binding in a worn ignition cylinder , and more importantly the 6 tumblers & 6 springs to stick and not become disengaged to allow freedom of movement\n\nIs there something I can do, add, squirt, etc. in the ignition cylinder that will help this out? Seems like we are going to have a real bitter cold winter this year the way things are shaping up right now. So anticipating a few weeks of teens if not 0* weather in the evenings.\n\nYes ,\n\n- remove plastic steering column cover clam-shell\n\n- place site protection on your floor under the lock area , such as thick cardboard or a old thick towell , Beach terry type\n\n- using a can of NON Chlorinated brake Klean , instert the red straw fully into the lock key hole , depress nozzle and slowly pull out straw while keeping the tip fully depresed\n\n- this will start to wash out all the old grease & more inportantly , a Crap load of black residue , the residue is Microscopic metal filings from age time use\n\n- Now quickly insert your Key and push pull in out rapid motion wiping key every few rounds of doing this\n\n- repeat steps 1- down , untill the key is klean when wiped . and all grease and black residue is gone 100 %\n\n- let dry naturally overnight , then insert WD-40 straw and give one short blast , inster key and again in & out motion to free up and lube all tumblers & springs\n\n- Your Cold lock should now operate Normally ,\n\n- I have used this method many times with Much Success & Good results Taught to me by My Master Tech while i studied under him as his T-TEN Apprentice @ Dealership circa 1996 era\n\nResult - Pulled out the cylinder per the video above (super easy) and took it to the local locksmith in Torrance yesterday evening. Old school Japanese man in his 60s that I'm sure has been doing it most of his life.\n\nHe said the key and tumblers were worn and told me to leave it with him for half an hour. He made a new key (cold cut?, I believe) and rebuilt the tumblers inside. He did say there was some additional wear to the cylinder internals and it would have been ideal to have a new one, but this should get me by for some time. Because of the extra wear internally, the new key he made was slightly stepped up from the one I provided. Even the door locks work smoother now with the new key. I'm actually embarrassed to say how little I paid for this.\n\nI appreciate the advice and detailed guidance here by everyone. I'm sure RagingMatt's service is excellent and is definitely the Toyota method, I just needed minimal downtime and this was the solution that worked best in my situation.\n\nP.S. - when he gave it back to me, he asked what kind of Toyota it was for then lit up when I told him it was an old Land Cruiser. This led to a 10 min conversation about people he knows who have them, their off-roading expeditions in SoCal, and the sense of community a lot of the owners have.\n\nResult - Pulled out the cylinder per the video above (super easy) and took it to the local locksmith in Torrance yesterday evening.

Always neat to meet people like that, that actually know what they are and have some enthusiasm for them.\n\nResult - Pulled out the cylinder per the video above (super easy) and took it to the local locksmith in Torrance yesterday evening.
