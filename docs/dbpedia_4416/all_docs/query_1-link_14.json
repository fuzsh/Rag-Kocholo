        "text": "Matt Tanner\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n6 min read\n\n·\n\nOct 6, 2018\n\n--\n\nI carefully navigate my car through the pre-dawn blackness and make my way toward the parking deck entrance. Completely void of cars at this hour, I easily find a spot near the elevator. I put the car in park and turn off the ignition, exhaling deeply as I do so.\n\n“Good,” I whisper to myself. “No one here.”\n\nI complete a final check in the rearview mirror (teeth clear, hair on point), then I make my way from the car to the parking ticket kiosk. I glance furtively about as my footfalls echo across the concrete. Wind whips through the open structure, sending old handbills and discarded food wrappers across my path like tumbleweeds. I cinch my jacket closed and brace against the chill.\n\nI have to remove my black leather gloves to feed (untraceable) quarters into the kiosk. I consider paying for just an hour, but I’m feeling optimistic so I pony up for two. As I turn to head toward the elevator I am startled by a security guard who has emerged from the shadows.\n\n“Cold enough for ya!” she asks.\n\nWithout slowing down, I avoid eye contact and mumble an inaudible acknowledgement. The elevator is a momentary respite from the cold and as it rises, I mentally go over my plan for once I am on the inside. The steel doors slide open and I emerge on the ground level just outside a large brick building. I scurry in.\n\nIt is here that disaster nearly strikes. I recognize the first person I see inside the building lobby and they look straight at me. I duck into a bathroom and hide in a stall, unsure if I’ve been made. After what seems like an eternity, I exit the stall, only to see him standing at the sink. I sprint past him as he calls my name and I just shout “nope, not him!” and run to my destination.\n\nPanting, I arrive at the front desk. Before I can speak the security guard is telling me the office doesn’t open for another hour, not bothering to hide his annoyance at my interruption of his dalliance with a chicken biscuit.\n\n“So how can I help you?” he asks.\n\n“I’m here for an interview,” I say.\n\nLooking for a job when you already have a job can be stressful. Taking hushed phone calls just out of earshot of your coworkers and sneaking away to interviews can make you feel like you are leading a double life (which, in a way you are). It can make you feel dirty, deceitful and duplicitous.\n\nIn short, it can make you feel like a criminal.\n\nBut should you feel bad about it? Is it unethical? And do you have other options besides sneaking around?\n\nLet’s dig in.\n\nWhat about just telling your boss upfront?\n\nI happen to believe that employees should explore outside opportunities somewhat regularly. It helps them gauge their value in the market and can even reenergize them to stay put and reapply themselves. Basically, the grass is always greener until you look over the fence.\n\nSome companies agree and openly encourage interviewing elsewhere. Consider this passage from the Netflix website:\n\nWe see occasional outside interviewing as healthy, and encourage employees to talk with their managers about what they learn in the process.\n\nIn most places though, I just don’t believe this is the norm.\n\nIn some companies you can be terminated immediately if it is discovered you are interviewing (this varies according to state laws, but still). And even if the policy is as forward-thinking as at Netflix, I wonder if the reality matches the sentiment. I have managed many folks and must admit that even though I believe that being open with your manager and testing the waters is healthy, every single time someone told me they were doing it, I questioned their commitment to the company, at least momentarily. I’d like to think I didn’t treat them any differently once they decided to stay, but I can’t be certain.\n\nThe decision of whether or not to tell, boils down to this: If you are absolutely certain that you are going to leave your current company for whatever reason (toxic culture, the wrong industry for you, poor leadership), you should keep your search completely secret. There is little potential benefit to talking to your manager or other colleagues, only negative consequences.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are genuinely unsure as to whether or not you should seek employment elsewhere, you might want to talk to your manager or a trusted mentor. They may have had no idea you harbored career development concerns and they could be aware of opportunities within the organization that you didn’t know about.\n\nThe paradox here is that any manager worthy of giving you solid career advice, would probably have already done so if they were good at their job. So tread lightly.\n\nIf you do go the route of telling your boss, you need to be prepared with a list of reasons for your wandering eye. That way, they may be able to help you find something internally that meets your needs. If all you are doing is dropping the news in their lap, that’s a waste of everyone’s time (and potentially disastrous) and you are better off keeping your search to yourself.\n\nYou can be discreet without being shady\n\nIf you decide to conduct your job search in secret, that does not mean you have to be dishonest. Nor should you take advantage of your current employer, no matter how toxic or difficult the situation may be. They are paying you after all. (If they’ve stopped paying you, then uh, do whatever you want).\n\nBeing discreet and respectful means taking interviews before or after your normal working hours. It means using your PTO to go to interviews or networking events. Then there’s all the little stuff like printing resumes or apply to other jobs while at work. Or even on your company computer.\n\nDon’t do that stuff!\n\nThis isn’t just about keeping it secret. That’s important to be sure, but it’s also about doing the right thing. Keep in mind that a career is often a weird, winding path and you just never know when you might find yourself working with some of these people again.\n\nAs for how it all feels? Yeah, it might feel a little shady and there will be spots where there is no clear ethical path.\n\nOnce I was interviewing and the hiring manager asked me if I could come in the next morning for a “very important” interview with a team that could only do it that day. If I couldn’t make it work, they understood, but it would be two weeks before I could give it another shot. I had used all of my PTO and didn’t want to call in and ask for a day off with such short notice anyway because it would look suspicious.\n\nI considered just going to the interview and then going to work and seeing if anyone missed me. That felt a little like stealing though, so I opted to call in sick in the morning (a lie) but I used an allotted sick day (not stealing). I even did some work for my current company after the interview during my “sick” day.\n\nWas it the right ethical call? I’m honestly not sure, but I weighed all sides and made the best choice I could, given the situation.\n\nIf you do your best to respect your current employer, including continuing to do your best work up until the moment you walk out the door (after giving proper notice, of course), that’s all any employer can reasonably ask for.\n\nNo matter what you do, it’s going to be exhausting\n\nFinding meaningful work is a full-time job.\n\nThe math is pretty straightforward: If you already have a full-time job, and you remain committed to it and respectful of your employer during a job search, you suddenly have two full-time jobs.\n\nThat’s hard. Potentially very rewarding, but hard.\n\nDoing it discretely is even harder.\n\nThe emotional roller coaster of interviewing and getting your hopes up and waiting for callbacks is taxing enough; throwing secrecy on top if it just compounds the stress.\n\nIf you’re employed and considering a job search-discretely or otherwise-make sure you are ready to commit fully to the process. You need to be upfront with yourself (and your family, girlfriend, boyfriend, dog, whatever) about what lies ahead. You might not be able to talk to your boss, but you need someone to serve as confidant during this process.\n\nAnd while it’s exhausting, that shouldn’t scare you away from trying to find meaningful work. After all, what’s more terrifying than staying in a miserable job forever?\n\nSo take a deep breath, polish up that resume, and get out there.\n\nI won’t tell anyone."
