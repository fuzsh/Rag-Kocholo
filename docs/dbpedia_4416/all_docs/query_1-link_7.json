You end up taking a job that has nothing to do with what you studied. Now you’re trying to cope. Here are some tips to help you make the most of that first job. 🙌 Transitioning from campus to corporate life seamlessly. 💼 👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾 #firstjob #graduate #anutio #careeradvisor\n\nAm I Right or Wrong? 🚀 Degree + Skills: The Winning Formula for Career Success! 🚀 In today's dynamic job market, it's not just about having a degree. While degrees provide valuable knowledge and open doors, it's your skills that truly help you hit your targets and excel. 🌟 Every degree holder isn't necessarily skilled, and every skilled individual may not have a degree. But when combined, they create a powerful formula for success. Degrees give you a broad foundation, while skills are the specific tools that drive your career forward. 🛠️📈 Degrees: Equip you with comprehensive knowledge and credibility. Skills: Enable you to apply that knowledge effectively and achieve your goals. In essence, a degree can put you in line, but it's your skills that will advance you in your career. Together, they ensure you not only get the opportunity but also make the most of it. 🚀 Invest in both your education and your skills to build a perfect career. The future belongs to those who blend knowledge with action! 🌟 #CareerSuccess #DegreeAndSkills #ProfessionalGrowth #CareerAdvancement #SkillsMatter #EducationAndSkills #CareerDevelopment\n\nIn college, I struggled with finding a career option for me. I randomly decided to prepare for mba in sixth semester. Couldn't prepare well, either for mba or college placement. After getting a low percentile in mba, was left with off-campus placement as my only option. Didn't have a LinkedIn profile back then. Things have changed now. LinkedIn and IT are both popular. But finding a right career still remains tough. That's why finding a right mentor early in your life is so important. As a mentor in the past, I realised how much difference can my guidance make be it cracking a job or changing careers. I also realise how occupied one becomes in his job, family etc and gets no or very little time to reply/refer/guide to those hundreds of pending messages, requests on LinkedIn. I'm providing my daily availability slots for the next week for people in need of any career guidance. https://lnkd.in/gu8hUBwk I request all my connections who are in a position to help. I know you might be a lot busy in your work, but please take out at least 10-15 minutes in a week if not every day to help those in need. You can contribute by any means, be it mentorship, career guide or providing a referral. Your little valuable help can have a huge impact on other people's career. The essence is: Waqt bura ho toh mehnat karna, Waqt acha ho toh madad karna! #mentorship #career #guidance #helpothers\n\n🎓 Navigating Your Path After Graduation: Choosing the Right Career Journey! 🚀 Dear Campus Graduates, Congratulations on nearing the exciting milestone of your final placement! 🎉 As you stand at the crossroads of countless opportunities, I wanted to share a few insights that might help you make an informed and confident decision about your career path.

With a large number of IIT graduates and others entering the workforce, those from other universities should recognize their distinct abilities and remain optimistic. Persistence and flexibility can lead to success in various industries for those who keep trying. The competition is indeed stiff. Graduates from other colleges may feel overshadowed by their counterparts, but it’s important to remember that each individual brings a unique set of skills and perspectives to the table. The job market trends suggest a shift towards sectors like technology, healthcare, and renewable energy, which are on the rise and present new opportunities for employment. For those feeling the pressure, it’s crucial to focus on building a skill set that aligns with the emerging sectors. Internships, online courses, and certifications can enhance employability. Networking and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn can also uncover opportunities that may not be widely advertised. The job market may be challenging, but it’s not insurmountable. With persistence, adaptability, and a willingness to learn, graduates from all backgrounds can find their niche. Opportunities may be few and far between, but they do exist, and with the right approach, they can be within reach. Remember, it’s about finding the right fit and not losing hope. Keep striving, keep learning, and the right opportunity will present itself. The key is to stay resilient and keep pushing forward. #India #CareerGoals #JobHunt #InterviewPrep #ResumeTips #Networking #CareerDevelopment #JobMarket #CareerAdvice #JobTrends #EmploymentOpportunities #WorkplaceCulture #JobStrategy #CareerCoaching #JobFair #CareerChange #JobHuntingTips #CareerOpportunities #JobSearchStrategy #CareerPlanning #HiringTrends\n\n“85% 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐫 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧-𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲\" This isn’t what we say, This statement was highlighted in an article by the Economic Times!!

No, not the Seasons Greetings just yet. It’s the season for the young, vibrant, and ambitious graduates in their robes. Smiling with their loved ones. Posting for best shots. The hard work and dedication paid off. Now you are all graduates. Ready for the next stage in your life. Being a graduate and hunting for a role is the beginning of a new adventure. You are a newborn in an ocean. You need grit, strategy, clear vision, probably a mentor too. Don’t hesitate to ask for help. Don't stop at sending out resumes and attending interviews. It's a vast green field and you have a lot to learn. Remember, “when you stop learning, you stop growing”. What you have learned back on campus is not the complete package. To hunt for a role and to build a career you need to discover a lot more. You need to read, reach out to others, and take initiative to ask questions. Being unique and different is not a taboo. Trying out something new is not fatal. Learning from mistakes will make you wiser. Be Bold. Be Passionate. Your academic qualifications surely will get you a job. Your passion and perseverance will build you a career. Stay passionate. Career growth is your own responsibility. Talent development is an organization process. But you know best how to navigate your own growth plans. Always aim for growth. There is a major difference between finding a job and building a career. Job will pay your bills and a career will build your future. Be clear in your aims. #graduation #convocation #career #careermentoring #mentors\n\nSeek challenges and not job titles. . . I recently came across a few young and smart graduates looking to build their professional careers and develop their niche skills. But instead of seeking the right organisation and job that would challenge them They were looking for 'Job Titles' and 'Benefits' Becoming a 'Head of Something' isn't called a successful career, at least in the early days of your career. Here's the thing: the right job might not always come with the most impressive title, but it can offer you something far more important - growth and fulfilment. When you're passionate about what you do, and you're willing to commit to learning, thriving, and growing, you're setting yourself up for long-term success. The knowledge and skills you acquire in a role that challenges you will far outweigh the allure of a prestigious job title. So, for those eager graduates, I'd encourage you to seek out opportunities that ignite your passion, challenge your abilities, and allow you to contribute your best. Embrace the roles that push you beyond your comfort zone because you truly evolve in those moments. Don't get hung up on titles or benefits; focus on the impact you can make, the skills you can acquire, and the person you can become. Over time, success and recognition will naturally follow your dedication and hard work. Choose challenges over titles; your early career will set the foundation for a fulfilling and prosperous professional journey. Do you agree with this?
