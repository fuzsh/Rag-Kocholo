        "text": "If there is a pushbutton kit for that specific car, they may address it… If it’s a generic pushbutton, you will still have to address the issue. ON the newer cars, it’s all electronic, and it may be electronic on yours but it’s something to look into. If your steering wheel locks when the key is not in the ignition… I think the shifter interlocks have been electronic for a while (hear a click when you hit the brake in park). But the steering could be an issue… Also if you remove those interlocks, it removes some basic security features. Now someone can jump in, put it in N and roll away with the car. It’s certainly possible to do, just some things to think about.\n\nSome of these kits come with RFID, but may will not read a glass tag through say the windshield due to the read range being very short. I’m sure there have been people here that have done it, so I’ll let them chime in…\n\nThe short answer is yes, most of these kits aren’t designed for people with RFID implants to be able to get rid of their keys, in fact the cheapest ‘push button start’ kits you can find still require you put your key in the car and turn it to ‘on’ - it literally just replaces turning the key to the start position.\n\nThese kits are made for people who want to show off to their mates and feel like they are driving a high end sports car when they can only afford a Camry - although its become less of a thing these days because passive keyless and pushbutton are coming to more and more cars as standard even in the middle of the market.\n\nAs for leaving it unlocked, that is definitely not recommended, something like an xEM Access Controller to look after locking, and then this to look after starting is a pretty common solution, but how you’d connect it up changes per car. If you’re wondering if your car has a factory immobiliser and how to get around that, look up “immobiliser bypass module your car model and year” and get your advice from a reputable car forum - this is done all the time for people who want remote start to warm up their car on cold days, so as much as they probably can’t help with the RFID stuff, the users there will be better able to advise on what needs to be done for your car.\n\nThat Amazon “EasyGuard” is pretty much what I am using for mine.\n\nI haven’t yet updated my rfid-vehicle-unlock-and-start project. ( Where @turbo2ltr also gave me some good suggestions )\n\nOnce it is done, I will update the whole project thread because I don’t want to drag anybody down the garden path until its finished.\n\nBut for now, to help you out, Just some observations, thoughts and results that I have had.\n\nThe installation of the Push to start you linked to (mine was aliexpress but the same unit) was very simple.\n\nAs @turbo2ltr eluded to\n\nSo I installed the antenna in the windscreen and it reads the factory fob easily, I haven’t actually tested my NExT because the xEM side is T5577 for my work access, I am hopeful it will work when I get my dedicated xEM, although in saying that, I am going to move it to the wing mirror with a momentary button underneath that will be pressed by my thumb as I scan my implant (that’s the plan anyway)\n\nWhy put in a momentary switch I hear you ask\n\nWhen I travel, I do so for extended periods, I don’t want to come back to a flat battery.\n\n(I have a hide-a-key on the outside)\n\nalternatively, I will put in a low voltage cut out and rely on the key.\n\nI removed my key barrel and inserted the Push to start in the cavity and it fit perfectly.\n\nRemoving the key barrel in mine removes the steering lock\n\nMy car doesn’t need a transponder, but if It did this is where you would install/mount the chip.\n\nNow here is where it got tricky, I REALLY like the xAC, but my whole goal was to use one device to push to start and to unlock.\n\nYes I could have installed both and enrolled the same xEM to both…Yes I could have used 2/3 xACs, but that was not what I wanted to do.\n\nFor a few different reasons, I decided to just go with the cheap Chinese Pust to start.\n\nThe problem lies with finding a switched 12V on the board of the Push to Start when the RFID is scanned and Authenticated to unlock the doors.\n\nThe only place I could find was the piezo buzzer -ve drop, but It beeps twice in quick succession and without going into it, you can probably see the problem.\n\nMy Door locks are +vely triggered, not too much of an issue with a relay, but just one more consideration.\n\nI am working with my mate who is an electronics engineer, who is happy to teach me some board design and programming from start to finish, It will contain a Flip Flop latching relay and will recognise the authentication peizo beep to lock / unlock.\n\nNow for the biggest problem. TIME\n\nNot his priority, nor mine for that matter, but I will get it done. ( It would actually be done sooner if I wasn’t involved…) It is currently out of my car and sitting on his bench, and I won’t get back until March, nothing is happening with it anytime soon.\n\nOn the plus side\n\nwhen the board is complete and tested as working, I will release all the files to the community.\n\nand a WikiHow style update for installation.\n\nIf all goes to plan, it will be an Unlock, push to start, Lock system for under $20 ( my Aliexpress PtoS was around $10 ).\n\nI hope this was helpful and there is some stuff to consider and not a derailment\n\nI was going to wait to share this in my project until I had it sorted and proven, but since you kinda asked…\n\nI am aware there are some potential security flaws in MY system, but luckily for me, this is not something I have to worry about.\n\nI did actually consider adding a tracking solution triggered off the same system, and THEORETICALLY, it wouldn’t be difficult, but…\n\nThere are some much smarter and more capable people on this forum than me, that can provide you further advice / suggestions…this is just MY input."
