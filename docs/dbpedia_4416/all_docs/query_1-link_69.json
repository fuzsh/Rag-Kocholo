        "text": "All UC jobs can be applied to online. Our application process starts with an applicant profile - make sure your profile is thorough and current. Once you have a profile you can apply to any job posting, at any time - just log in and start searching.\n\nOnce you’ve submitted your application, the hiring process and timeline is set by the hiring department and varies by area and position. You can access your Profile at any time to see the progress of your application by logging into your account.\n\nIf you need accommodations to assist with the application process, please contact us at (513) 556-6381. Computers are available in the Human Resources office Monday through Friday 8:00 am - 5:00 pm if you need access to a computer.\n\nYou got an interview, hooray! This is our chance to get to know you, learn about your experience, and understand your unique skills. With that said, it’s also your chance to get to know us! Be sure to come prepared with any questions you may have regarding the role. We’re excited to meet you!\n\nThe hiring authority from the college or department of the role will determine the specific interview process. It may be virtual, in person, or both, and there may be more than one interview. Some roles may require testing, either written or practical. If this is required, we will guide you through this process.\n\nAfter the interview, someone from UC will follow up with you either via email or a phone call to provide feedback or any potential next steps.\n\nNow for the most exciting part! If you are determined to be the best person for the role, you will receive a verbal offer followed by a written offer with role details and information about UC’s benefits package.\n\nOnce you accept your role online, a required background check will be performed and your start date will be decided.\n\nThe onboarding process is designed to help set you up for success in your new role. You will be able to attend a virtual new hire onboarding session that will help you get to know UC, learn about your benefits and meet other new hires.\n\nFrom there, your new department will conduct your training and help you acclimate to your role. UC is a great place to work and offers ongoing development and career opportunities, including tuition remission for employees and immediate family members."
