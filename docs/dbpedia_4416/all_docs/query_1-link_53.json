I worked myself to death in restaurants, hotels, and resorts until I moved back to Washington, and a buddy I worked with before was at Aegis and convinced me to come work with him in a retirement setting... That was seven years ago and I do not regret a single thing. This is the most rewarding job in hospitality! Aegis is the best company in senior living! Great pay, career advancement, great benefits, work-life balance, and lots of fun with residents!"
