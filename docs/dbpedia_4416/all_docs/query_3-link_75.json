        "text": "CRR: Where do I start?\n\nHere are the 2 most important takeaways for you today:\n\nLearn about CRR through these 2 National Fire Academy (NFA) self-study courses: Introduction to Strategic Community Risk Reduction and Introduction to Community Risk Assessment.\n\nConduct a risk assessment for your community.\n\nRead on to explore CRR a little more in depth, including examples of successful community programs and resources to help with your program, but the most important thing for you to do after closing this page is to get started with the 2 takeaways above.\n\nThe 5 E's\n\nCRR uses a wide variety of tools to form a strategic and integrated program focused on reducing the occurrence and impact of local risks. The “5 E's” is one of the strategies used to combat local fire and preventable injury issues. When using this or any other strategy, be intentional about reducing your community's risk: base your approach on data that you collected through your risk assessment and then focus on that specific risk(s).\n\nFocusing on risk: Older adult cooking fires\n\nThe Worcester (Massachusetts) Fire Department, working with the Worcester Housing Authority, analyzed locations and populations at disproportionate risk from cooking fires in 2015. 4 properties housing low-income older adults represented nearly 24% of all reported cooking fires, with an average of 12 incidents per month.\n\nThe department applied for and received a Fire Prevention and Safety Grant to support a collaborative effort that replaced conventional electric coil burners with temperature limiting control technology units to prevent auto-ignition. 800 electric stoves were retrofitted with fire-safe burners and on-site safety education was provided to approximately 900 residents. In the 6 months after the installation, no stovetop fires were reported in units where smart technology burners were installed."
