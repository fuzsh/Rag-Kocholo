        "text": "Educators & School Districts\n\nLaser-focused and generating results quickly, we unveil hidden career pathways and enhance the recruitment and retention of a diverse, inclusive, and equitable workforce.\n\nCollaborating with educators and school districts, we establish post-secondary career pathways and create efficient workforce pipelines with employer partners.\n\nOur programs are meticulously crafted to align with local and regional industry priorities.\n\nEmployers & Training Partners\n\nOur comprehensive consulting program is a structured process that quickly brings clarity, identifies stumbling blocks and implements steps to advance the recruitment and retention of entry level talent from high schools.\n\nWe collaborate with clients to create career pathways and develop recruitment strategies to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce.\n\nIn collaboration with Specialized Career Guidance, our team at AccuRounds provided high school students an overview of advanced manufacturing through a virtual tour followed by Q&A. Judi and her team planned a productive event, with excellent feedback from both our team and the students. Programs like these are vital in exposing students to viable career pathways. Specialized Career Guidance plays a key role in workforce development, connecting employers to their future workforce. It was a pleasure working with Judi.\n\nMichael Tamasi\n\nPresident and CEO, AccuRounds\n\nThe Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts (AGC MA) recently undertook a concerted workforce development initiative for the commercial construction industry. While we represent some of the most sophisticated commercial builders in the country, we lacked the expertise to navigate the space between the educational community and our industry. After becoming a client of Specialized Career Guidance, we couldn’t be more pleased with our progress in creating pathways to employment between schools, community stakeholders, and our industry. Judi Vigna is an exceptional collaborator who creates synergistic connections with all stakeholders to make educational and vocational pathways to employment more diverse, inclusive, and navigable.\n\nJohn S. Ferrante\n\nCEO, Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts, Inc.\n\nSpecialized Career Guidance took our Photonics Certificate Program to a whole new level. Judi Vigna brought the future direction into focus with suggestions about student experiences, funding, and industry pipelines. We will be forever grateful for her expertise, organization, and positive energy.\n\nDr. Cheryl Schnitzer\n\nDirector of the Photonics Certificate Program and Chemistry Professor, Stonehill College\n\nJudi has been an exceptional partner that I hope to work with for many years to come. While Judi and her team are quintessential professionals and researchers, what really sets them apart is their expertise in workforce development, organizational improvement, and the institutional landscape in Massachusetts. The team is able to leverage this expertise to add tremendous value to schools seeking to elevate and accelerate their work to provide students with career pathways towards prosperity. I enthusiastically recommend them without reservation!\n\nJoshua Otlin\n\nPrincipal, Milford High School\n\nI have had the pleasure of knowing Judi for many years and I can confidently say I have never met anyone with as much infectious energy and drive. As founder and CEO of Specialized Career Guidance (SCG), Judi brings a level of expertise and support to our district that was previously lacking. Judi and her team have a special skill set for bringing a wide range of stakeholders together with varying perspectives, finding their common interests and building an infrastructure that benefits everyone involved. Judi’s commitment to creating diverse, equitable and inclusive opportunities for all students has had such a profound impact on our students. SCG truly cares about helping youth find options that will improve their future.\n\nChristopher Campbell\n\nSuperintendent, Plymouth Public Schools"
