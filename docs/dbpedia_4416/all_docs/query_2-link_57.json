        "text": "Spark plugs have been around as long as internal combustion engines have and are often a misunderstood component. This basic guide is designed to assist the technician, hobbyist or race technician in understanding, using and troubleshooting spark plugs.\n\nSpark plugs are a “window” into the engine and can be a valuable diagnostic tool. The spark plug displays the condition inside the combustion chambers of the engine. The experienced tuner can use spark plugs to find the root cause of problems, determine air-fuel ratios and increase vehicle performance.\n\nSpark Plug Basics\n\nThe primary function of the spark plug is to ignite the air-fuel mixture within the combustion chamber under any operating condition.\n\nSpark plugs must provide a path and a location for electrical energy from the ignition coil to create a spark used to ignite the air-fuel mixture. A sufficient amount of voltage must be supplied by the ignition system to spark across the spark plug gap. This is called “electrical performance.”\n\nThe spark plug firing end temperature must be kept low enough to prevent pre-ignition, but high enough to prevent fouling. This is called “thermal performance,” and is determined by the heat range selected.\n\nNGK Spark Plug Heat Rating\n\nThe spark plug heat range has no relationship to the electrical energy transferred through the spark plug. The heat range of a spark plug is the range in which the plug works well thermally. The heat rating of each NGK spark plug is indicated by a number; lower numbers indicate a hotter type, higher numbers indicate a colder type.\n\nHeat rating and heat flow path of NGK Spark Plugs\n\nSome basic structural factors affecting the heat range of a spark plug are:\n\nSurface area and/or length of the insulator nose\n\nThermal conductivity of the insulator, center electrode, etc.\n\nStructure of the center electrode such as a copper core, etc.\n\nRelative position of the insulator tip to the end of the shell (projection)\n\nThe major structural difference affecting the heat rating is the length of the insulator nose. A hot-type spark plug has a longer insulator nose. The insulator nose of a hotter spark plug has a longer distance between the firing tip of the insulator and the point where insulator meets the metal shell. Therefore, the path for the dissipation of heat from the insulator nose to the cylinder head is longer and the firing end stays hotter. The insulator nose of a hotter spark plug also has a greater surface area that is exposed to more of the ignited gases and is easily heated to higher temperatures. A colder spark plug functions in an opposite manner.\n\nThe heat range must be carefully selected for proper spark plug thermal performance. If the heat range is not optimal, then serious trouble can be the result. The optimal firing end temperature is approximately 500°C (932°F) to 800°C (1472°F). The two most common causes of spark plug problems are carbon fouling (< 450°C) and overheating (> 800°C).\n\nCauses of Carbon Fouling:\n\nContinuous low-speed driving and/or short trips\n\nSpark plug heat range too cold\n\nAir-fuel mixture too rich\n\nReduced compression and oil usage due to worn piston rings/cylinder walls\n\nOver-retarded ignition timing\n\nIgnition system deterioration\n\nPre-delivery Fouling:\n\nCarbon fouling occurs when the spark plug firing end does not reach the self-cleaning temperature of approximately 450°C (842°F). Carbon deposits will begin to burn off from the insulator nose when the self-cleaning temperature is reached. When the heat range is too cold for the engine speed, the firing end temperature will stay below 450°C and carbon deposits will accumulate on the insulator nose. This is called carbon fouling. When enough carbon accumulates, the spark will travel the path of least resistance over the insulator nose to the metal shell instead of jumping across the gap. This usually results in a misfire and further fouling.\n\nIf the selected spark plug heat range is too cold, the spark plug may begin to foul when the engine speed is low or when operating in cold conditions with rich air-fuel mixtures. In some cases, the insulator nose can usually be cleaned by operating the engine at higher speeds in order to reach the self-cleaning temperature. If the spark plug has completely fouled, and the engine will not operate correctly, the spark plug may need to be replaced and the fouling cause identified.\n\nCauses of Overheating:\n\nSpark plug heat range too hot\n\nInsufficient tightening torque and/or no gasket\n\nOver-advanced ignition timing\n\nFuel octane rating too low (knock is present)\n\nExcessively lean air-fuel mixture\n\nExcessive combustion chamber deposits\n\nContinuous driving under excessively heavy load\n\nInsufficient engine cooling or lubrication\n\nThe most serious result of selecting a heat range that is too hot is overheating. Overheating will cause the electrodes to wear quickly and can lead to pre-ignition. Pre-ignition occurs when the air-fuel mixture is ignited by a hot object/area in the combustion chamber before the timed spark event occurs. When the spark plug firing end (tip) temperature exceeds 800°C, pre-ignition originating from the overheated insulator ceramic can occur. Pre-ignition will dramatically raise the cylinder temperature and pressure, which can cause serious and expensive engine damage. When inspecting a spark plug that has experienced overheating or pre-ignition, blistering on the ceramic insulator and/or melted electrodes can sometimes be found.\n\nAs a general guideline, among identical spark plug types, the difference in tip temperature from one heat range to the next is approximately 70°C to 100°C.\n\nTip Temperature and Firing End Appearance\n\nThere are many external influences that can affect the operating temperature of a spark plug. The following is a brief list to consider in avoiding reduced performance and/or expensive engine damage.\n\nEngine Speed and Load\n\nIf the engine is to be operated at high RPM, under a heavy load or at high temperatures for long periods, a colder heat range may be needed.\n\nConversely, if the engine is to be operated at low speeds or at low temperatures for long periods, a hotter heat range might be needed to prevent fouling.\n\nAir-Fuel Mixture\n\nExcessively rich air-fuel mixtures can cause the plug tip temperatures to decrease and carbon deposits to accumulate, possibly causing fouling and misfires.\n\nExcessively lean air-fuel mixtures can cause the cylinder and plug temperatures to increase, possibly resulting in knock and/or pre-ignition. This may cause damage to the spark plug and/or seriously damage the engine.\n\nIf an air-fuel ratio meter or gas analyzer is not available, it will be necessary to visually inspect the spark plugs frequently during the tuning process to determine the proper air-fuel mixture.\n\nFuel Type/Quality\n\nLow quality and/or low octane fuel can cause knock which will elevate cylinder temperatures. The increased cylinder temperature will cause the temperature of the combustion chamber components (spark plug, valves, piston, etc.) to rise, and will lead to pre-ignition if the knock is uncontrolled.\n\nWhen using an ethanol blend fuel with high ethanol content in high-performance applications, a colder heat range may be necessary. The spark timing can be advanced further because ethanol blend fuel has a higher resistance to knock (higher octane). Due to the decreased knock, there will be less audible “warning” from knock before the spark plug overheats and pre-ignites.\n\nSome types of fuel additives in lower quality fuels can cause spark plug deposits that can lead to misfires, pre-ignition, etc.\n\nIgnition Timing\n\nAdvancing ignition timing by 10° will cause the spark plug tip temperature to increase by approximately 70° to 100°C.\n\nA colder heat range spark plug may be necessary if the ignition timing has been advanced to near the knock level. Higher cylinder temperatures near the knock level will bring the spark plug firing end temperature closer to the pre-ignition range.\n\nCompression Ratio\n\nSignificantly increasing the static/dynamic compression ratio will increase cylinder pressures and the octane requirement of the engine. Knock may occur more easily. If the engine is operated near the knock level, a colder heat range spark plug may be necessary due to the resulting increased cylinder temperatures.\n\nForced Induction (Turbocharging, Supercharging)\n\nA colder heat range spark plug may be necessary due to the increased cylinder temperature as boost pressure (manifold pressure) and subsequent cylinder pressure and temperature increase.\n\nAmbient Air Temperature/Humidity\n\nAs the air temperature or humidity decreases, the air density increases, requiring a richer air-fuel mixture. If the air-fuel mixture is not properly richened, and the mixture is too lean, higher cylinder pressures/temperatures, knocking, and the subsequent increase in the spark plug tip temperatures can result.\n\nAs the air temperature or humidity increases, the air density decreases, requiring a leaner air-fuel mixture. If the air-fuel mixture is too rich, decreased performance and/or carbon fouling can result.\n\nBarometric Pressure/Altitude\n\nAir (atmospheric) pressure and cylinder pressure decrease as altitude increases. As a result, spark plug tip temperature will also decrease.\n\nFouling can occur more easily if the air-fuel mixture is not adjusted to compensate for the altitude. Higher altitude = less air = less fuel.\n\nTypes of Abnormal Combustion\n\nPre-ignition\n\nPre-ignition occurs when the air-fuel mixture is ignited by a hot object/area in the combustion chamber before the timed spark event occurs.\n\nWhen the spark plug firing end (tip) temperature exceeds 800°C, pre-ignition originating from the overheated insulator ceramic can occur.\n\nIt is most often caused by the wrong (too hot) heat range spark plug, and/or over-advanced ignition timing. An improperly installed (insufficient torque) spark plug can also result in pre-ignition due to inadequate heat transfer.\n\nPre-ignition will dramatically raise the cylinder temperature and pressure, which can melt and hole pistons, burn valves, etc.\n\nKnock\n\nOccurs when part of the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, away from the spark plug, is spontaneously ignited by the pressure from a flame front originating from the spark plug. The two colliding flame fronts contribute to the “knocking” sound.\n\nKnock occurs more frequently when using low octane fuel. Low octane fuel has a low resistance to knock (low resistance to ignition).\n\nKnock is related to ignition timing. (Knock is sometimes referred to as “spark knock.”) Retarding the ignition timing will reduce knock.\n\nHeavy knock often leads to pre-ignition.\n\nHeavy knock can cause breakage and/or erosion of combustion chamber components.\n\nKnock is sometimes referred to as “ping” or “detonation.”\n\nMisfires"
