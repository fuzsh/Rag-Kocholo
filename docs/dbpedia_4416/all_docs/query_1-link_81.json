From initial online application to reference checks, we follow a thorough process that assesses your unique skills and experiences as they relate to the role you’re applying for. We also determine that your motivations fit with our mission and the core values that make Teach For America a unique workplace.\n\nThere are five basic steps in our application process, which combined take about six-to-10 weeks to complete. These steps allow you to take the time to determine if TFA is the right fit for you and your aspirations, as well.\n\nLearn more about each step below.\n\nOnline Application\n\nOur hiring process is highly selective, so we encourage you to complete your online application carefully and accurately. We suggest applying for no more than three positions at a time. Your cover letter should demonstrate an understanding of Teach For America and the position to which you are applying. Your resume should outline your past accomplishments and leadership experiences.\n\nPlease also include any supplemental materials (e.g., a writing sample) specified in the job description. Your application will not be considered complete without all materials. Once you submit your application, you’ll receive an email confirming that we received your application. Unless a deadline is specified in the job description, your application will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\nInvitation to Interview\n\nDue to candidate volume, we typically only contact candidates moving forward in the interview process. If invited for an interview, you’ll also receive an email with helpful links to learn more about life at TFA, our core values, and our regional and national offices.\n\nFirst Interview\n\nFirst interviews are typically conducted over the phone. You’ll be asked to share more about your past accomplishments and speak to your interest in and fit with the role. Please note that if you’ve applied to multiple positions, we will only consider you for the roles for which you are best suited.\n\nSubsequent Interview(s)\n\nYou may be invited to a series of subsequent interviews with the hiring manager and other members of the team after your initial interview. Getting the right fit is important to us, so you could have a single interview or multiple interviews for a given position.\n\nIn subsequent interviews, you may be asked to role-play a scenario you might encounter in the position and/or complete a work-related exercise, such as a project plan, an analytical exercise, or a response to a prompt. You should be prepared to dedicate a few hours to subsequent interviews and additional exercises.\n\nReference Checks\n\nOnce our hiring managers have identified a finalist, they will talk to the candidate’s references. This is to get another lens on the candidate’s strengths and areas of development.\n\nJoining TFA Staff Questions\n\nYou may have some questions about the staff application process. Below are answers to frequently asked questions:\n\nI'm interested in a lot of staff positions on your website. Can I talk to someone about which position is right for me?\n\nWe’re so glad you’re interested in staff positions at Teach For America. However, due to the number of applications we receive each day, we don’t have the capacity to have individualized conversations with prospective candidates. To be fair to all candidates, we encourage you to browse all positions that fit your interest and background experience and submit an application online.\n\nWhat is the status of my staff application?\n\nIf you haven’t received confirmation of your application submission, make sure your email address is correct in your application profile. Please also adjust your spam filters so that you receive communication from staffing@teachforamerica.org.\n\nA member of our hiring team will contact you for an interview if your profile corresponds to the requirements of the job to which you applied. If you don't hear from us, we have determined that your profile is not aligned with the role's needs. We will keep your resume on file for consideration for opportunities that become open in the future.\n\nCan I apply for an internship with Teach For America?\n\nYes! Teach For America offers paid internships and roles to undergraduates from all college majors and in all parts of the country. Several of our partners also have opportunities for you to get involved. Find out more on Internships and Experiences.\n\nWho do I reach out to if I need accommodations for the application process?\n\nAny applicant who requires an accommodation for a disability—either to apply for a position or to proceed with the job search process—should contact staffing@teachforamerica.org.\n\nWhat paperwork will I need if I am hired?\n\nAfter you are hired, you should provide documents that prove your identity and prove you are work-authorized (eligible to work legally in the United States). Acceptable documents are your Employment Authorization Document (EAD), driver’s license and social security number, which you will notate on a Form I-9.\n\nOur Human Assets team will submit the information from your I-9 in an online system called E-Verify which compares your I-9 information to data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration's records to confirm employment eligibility. Shortly after you are hired, you’ll need to complete a W-4 form to allow Teach For America to determine the amount of taxes to withhold from your paycheck.\n\nDo you have a question we didn’t answer here? Email us at staffing@teachforamerica.org."
