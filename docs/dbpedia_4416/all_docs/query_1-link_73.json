        "text": "You have many talents. Salary negotiation doesn’t have to be one of them. At IGNITE, we invest in our team, ensuring salary levels for all staff are benchmarked to the 80th percentile for nonprofit organizations of our size. We match each job to its corresponding level, salary and career trajectory, so you can count on transparency, equity, and a clear path to growth. These salaries will always be listed clearly in job descriptions.\n\nWe know you have a full life, including friends, family, and obligations. We believe flexibility at work is key to your success.\n\nIGNITE is a fully remote organization with team members across the United States. You can count on home office setup support and cell phone reimbursement to make sure you’re set up for success. We offer a generous childcare policy if you need to travel for work. You also get to choose two additional holidays (on top of the 15 org-wide paid holidays), since we know the diversity of our team means that you may celebrate different occasions and holidays than others on the team.\n\nYour health comes first. You can count on top medical, dental and vision coverage, generous personal time off and sick days (including mental health days) with additional time off for recovery from COVID-19.\n\nTo safeguard the health of our team, IGNITE requires all employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 within six weeks of their start date. We also believe a family and medical leave policy is necessary to close gender gaps in the workplace and ensure people can thrive at work. We work to support our staff members when they need to take time away for a multitude of family or medical reasons.\n\nWe want you to have the ability to build and plan for a strong future. All full-time employees can take advantage of an employee 401K plan with employer match.\n\nWe also offer full-time staff access to ScholarShare 529, a flexible and tax-advantaged savings plan for your child’s higher education.\n\nAdditionally, we support professional development opportunities from courses, events and certifications to help you build your expertise."
