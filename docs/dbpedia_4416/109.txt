Ignite gives people of all ages and abilities the fuel needed to reach their goals. At any stage of your career, you will benefit from membership. We begin with exploring your skills, strengths and experience, as well as your individual preferences and requirements. From there we’ll learn about the personal and professional challenges that you face and then guide you towards the ideal job opportunity for you, personally!

How do we do it? We take an individualized approach to your success. That’s one of the reasons we are so different from typical career coaches or placement agencies. Then we strengthen that with the latest job-seeking strategies and our close connections to Greater Baltimore’s business leaders. Plus, you don’t need to be a Maryland resident to take advantage of our services. Our members come to us from around the country — and even the world — for our expertise in career guidance, whether that is finding a position now or focusing on professional development to be better prepared for the future.
