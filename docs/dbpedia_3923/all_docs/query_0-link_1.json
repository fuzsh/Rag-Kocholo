About 400 of these were probably not worth producing, seeing or mentioning. That’s what 1 think. So 1 am adding to this index page, with the editor s permission, a list of 100 films which, it seems to me, would have met the entertainment needs of the great American public, with all its varying moods and sexes. For the convenience of any who may wish to refer to this list I have classified it according to general type, and I have marked with a star the films selected by the National Board of Review and the motion picture critics of the New York Times and Herald-Tribune as the ten best pictures of the year. There are nineteen oi them. — Penetrix ADVENTURE Boom Town 1 Married Adventure Northwest Mounted Police Northwest Passage The Mark of Zorro The Sea Hawk Wyoming BIOGRAPHICAL and HISTORICAL Abe Lincoln in Illinois Brigham Young Dispatch from Reuter’s Dr. Ehrlich’s Magic Bullet Edison, The Man Knute Rockne, All American Queen of Destiny The Howards of Virginia Young Tom Edison COMEDIES Andy Hardy Meets Debutante Arise My Love * Blondie Has Servant Trouble Blondie on a Budget Blondie Plays Cupid Brother Rat and a Baby Christmas in July Congo Maisie Curtain Call Gold Rush Maisie He Stayed for Breakfast Hired Wife Lucky Partners Maryland My Favorite Wife My love Came Back No Time for Comedy Pride and Prejudice * Raffles Remember the Night Star Dust Susan and God The Baker’s Wife (French) * The Great Dictator * The Great McGinty * The Shop Around the Corner * Third Finger, Left Hand Three Cheers for the Irish Too Many Husbands Torrid Zone Tugboat Annie Sails Again Twenty-Mule Team Of Mice and Men * Our Town * Pastor Hall * Rebecca * Strange Cargo The Biscuit Eater * The Fighting 69th The House Across the Bay The House of Seven Gables The Hunchback of Notre Dame The Letter The Light That Failed The Long Voyage Home * The Mortal Storm * The Primrose Path * The Sidewalks of London They Drive by Night They Knew What They Kanted ’Til We Meet Again Tom Brown’s School-Days Vigil in the Night Waterloo Bridge FANTASIES Fantasia * Pinocchio The Thief of Bagdad MUSICALS Bittersweet Irene It’s a Date L.ttle Nellie Kelly Strike Up the Band The Great Victor Herbert Tin Pan Alley Too Many Girls -:- SHORT SUBJECTS — A — ACQUITTED BY THE SEA AMERICAN SPOKEN HERE — B — BLONDES AND BLUNDERS BOWLING FOR STRIKES — C — CAVALCADE OF SAN FRANCISCO..

LOVE THY NEIGHBOR: Produced by Mark Sandrich for Paramount Director: Mark Sandrich Screenplay: William Morrow, Edmund Beloin, Ernest Pagano, Z. Myers Photography: Ted Tetzlaff Art Directors: Hans Dreier, Roland Anderson Editor: Le Roy Stone Jack Benny Jack Benny Fred Allen Fred Allen Mary Allen Mary Martin Barbara Allen Vcrree Teasdale Rochester Eddie Anderson Virginia Astor Virginia Dale Josephine Theresa Harris Joe Richard Denning Policeman Jack Carson George Barnett Parker Mr. Harrington Russell Hicks Chambermaid Mary Kelley Judge Chester Clute The Merry Macs: Judd McMichael, Ted McMichael, Joe McMichael, Helen Car- roll, Merricl Abbott Dancers. Glib and diverting gag comedy in which Fred Allen and Jack Benny bring their four-year radio feud to the screen in a series of frantic fun fireworks. Mary Martin as Allen’s niece joins Benny’s show in order to reconcile the rivals but her efforts result in further complica- tions. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 80 minutes) Those rival clowns of the airwaves, those two needling concocters of nitwit. Jack Benny and Fred Allen, finally have out their feud in a hilarious gag-pulling match conducted especially for all the ardent ether fans. Belieing its name with brash and amusing pertinence, Love Thy Neighbor makes an attempt to settle on celluloid the famous battle of word- blisters and barbed invective which started off so casually some four years ago when one of the humor men let drop an edged remark. It all gets under way when Allen sets out to meet a cruise-boat bringing home Mary Martin, his shapely cinema niece. As ill-fortune and the script scrib- blers would have it, Benny also heads in the same general direction. That starts things off with a bang of course, and the tension mounts swiftly when Mary - who really means well — impersonates a star in Benny’s musical in order to dis- solve the feud and calm the nerves ot her distracted uncle. From then on in- vective follows insult. Before the wild windup Benny has hired away Allen’s Merry Macs, Allen has taken potshots at Benny and planted a blonde in his apart- ment, and enough brawls, quips and savage sallies have been introduced to ap- pease the most enthusiastic feud fan. The swift and bristling repartee in- dulged in by the two principals is the show’s prime attraction but by no means its only asset. Lithe, alluring Mary Martin sings and swings “My Heart Belongs to Daddy,” the song which lifted her to stardom, in fetching fashion, besides bringing charm and appeal to the story’s slapstick situations. “Rochester\" (Eddie Anderson), at his best, slips in some ef- fective by-play and banter with Benny, while others of the cast, notably, Verree Teasdale, Virginia Dale, Theresa Harris, and the Merry Macs add worthy enter- tainment elements. The songs, “Isn’t It Just Like Love ?”, “Do You Know Know Why?”, and “Dearest, Darest I,” seem destined for hit ratings. It’s an enthusiastic, ably produced gag roundup which no A-l Benny- Allen fan can afford to skip. 46 \"The MOVIES • • • 1940” GO WEST: Produced by Jack Cummings for MGM Director: Edward Buzzell Screenplay: Irving Brecher Photography: Leonard Smith Editor: Blanche Sewell S. Quentin Quale Groucho Marx Joe Panello Chico Marx \"Rusty\" Panello Harpo Marx Terry Turner John Carroll Eve Wilson Diana Lewis Beecher Walter Woolf King \"Red\" Baxter Robert Barrat Lulubelle June MacCloy Railroad President George Lessey Neatly nonsensical fun fest with music featuring the three merry Marx brothers in their yearly screen scramble. The zanies get mixed up with bad men seek- ing to promote a railroad deal in the seventies, lose a vital deed, steal it back for the sake of the pretty heroine and finally partake in a wild race which foils the villains. (Adults & Young People) (Running time, 79 minutes) The Marx Brothers 1940 slapstick feature sends the gagsters gallavantin through another broad farcical comedy directed along familiar laugh requirement lines. Rollicking antics, ridiculous humor situations, novel musical interludes, light romance and a wild melee with mercenary competitors keep the hysterical hi] inks moving at a swift pace most of the way. Careful editing in a few reels would have done no harm, but that’s a minor criti- cism of a show cut successfully for laughs and more of them. Learning that the New York and West- ern Railroad plans to extend its lines from Cripple Creek Junction to the Pacific, young Terry Turner comes to the big town in order to advise the railroad of a short-cut route through Dead Man’s Gulch. Terry is in love with Eve Wilson, daughter of the Gulch owner whose poverty has delayed the marriage of the young folks. The railroad dispatches Beecher, a shady individual, to purchase the cut for $^0,000. After highlighting S. Quentin Quale involved in hocus pocus with Joe and Rusty Panello, co- owners of a ten dollar bill, the scene shifts to the west where Terry and Eve gaily set out to inform old Dan Wilson of the good news. Dan has passed away however, leaving a deed to the Gulch in the hands of Joe and Rusty who have journeyed west on the money fleeced from S. Quentin Quale. Thinking the deed worthless, the pair have left it as an I. O. U. at the Crystal Palace Saloon, whose owner. Red Baxter, is in league with Beecher. Joe and Rusty leave Crip- ple Creek in a stagecoach with Beecher and Lulubelle, the Crystal Palace’s enter- tainer, pick up a hitch-hiker, S. Quentin Quale, who wangles the I. O. U. for a dime, delivers it to Baxter and Beecher for a promised $10,000 — and is prompt- ly kicked out. After laying eyes upon Diana, the conscience-stricken trio — Quale, Joe and Rusty — swipe the deed in a torrid set-to, board the train which Beecher and Baxter take in order to reach the impatient railroad officials first. Eve and Terry race the train in a buck- board, win out thanks largely to the hilarious lack of cooperation displayed by the clowns on the speeding train. As usual the story is a framework foi fun proceedings which allow the Marx talents a nice individual play. Groucho as Quale, the outslicked slickster, deftly clears the top comedy hurdles, displaying his usual flair for monkeyshines and horseplay — plus his familiar weakness for blondes. Chico as Joe is divertingly dumb and gets in his usual lick at the piano, while Harpo maintains a most potent silence, besides strumming “From the Land of the Sky-Blue Water” on an improvised harp. Diana Lewis is pleas- ingly pert as she teams with John Carroli for the light love interest. Walter Wool! King and Robert Barrat make good vil- lains: contralto June McCloy delivers a torch song in style and also contributes to the general plot. The final windup is a corker and tbe full show maintains a lively laugh level. MICHAEL SHAYNE. PRIVATE DETECTIVE: Produced by Sol M. Wurtzel for 20th Century-Fox Director: Eugene Forde Screenplay: Stanley Rauh, Manning O’Connor Story: Brett Halliday Photography: George Schneiderman Editor: A1 De Gaetano Michael Shayne Lloyd Nolan Phyllis Brighton Marjorie Weaver Marsha Gordon Joan Valerie Elliott Thomas Walter Abel Aunt Olivia Elizabeth Patterson Chief Painter Donald MacBride Gordon Douglas Dumbrille Brighton Clarence Kolb Harry Grange George Meeken Bright little murder-with-comedy mys- tery; a flippant detective, hired to protect a pretty girl with a penchant for gamb- ling, pulls her out of a homicide situa- tion. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 77 minutes) Here's a light, diverting little offering which skips along blithely among its many crime and comedy situations. The plot is something of a crazy-quilt, but the seams are sewed with laughter. Michael Shayne, a lone-wolf sleuth, encounters at- tractive Phyllis Brighton at a race track, manages to call off her bet on a horse, and then finds himself hired to look after the horse-minded maid. Shayne soon wades into deeper waters however when a young man acquaintance of the girl’s is murdered. In attempting to keep the young lady’s reputation untarnished, he himself becomes the chief suspect. Need- less to say, the mystery is finally solved to the audience’s satisfaction. Things happen fast enough to main- tain suspense straight through. Lloyd Nolan as Shayne, the wise-cracking sleuth, shows up very well indeed and he re- ceives stronger support than is usual in a shindig of this sort. Marjorie Weaver as Phyllis is both eye-catching and cap- able; Donald MacBride as the police chief and Elizabeth Patterson as Shayne’s self-appointed, old maid assistant bring in necessary comedy elements, and Walter Abel and Douglas Dumbrille make cred- ible crime-hatchers. 47 \"The MOVIES 1940” SANTA FE TRAIL: Produced and distributed by Warner Brothers Director: Michael Curtiz Original Screenplay: Robert Buckner Photography: Sol Polito Art Director: John Hughes Editor: George Amy Jeb Stuart Errol Flynn Kit Carson Halliday.. Olivia de Havilland John Brown Raymond Massey George Custer Ronald Reagan Tex Bell Alan Hale Bob Halliday William Lundigan Rader Van Heflin Jason Brown Gene Reynolds Cyrus Halliday Henry O'Neill Windy Brody Guinn “Big Boy’’ Williams Oliver Brown Alan Baxter Martin John Litel Robert E. Lee Moroni Olsen Paul Sheridan David Bruce Barber Doyle Hobart Cavanaugh Major Sumner Charles D. Brown Kitzmiller Joe Sawyer James Longstreet Frank Wilcox Townley Ward Bond Shoubel Morgan Russell Simpson Gentry Charles Middleton Jefferson Davis Erville Alderson Conductor Spencer Charters Charlotte Suzanne Carnahan George Pickett William Marshall John Hood George Haywood Imposing and opulent super-spectacle western stint adhering more to heroics than the spirit of historical fact. Laid in the pre-Civil War period, the story de- tails the breathtaking adventures of two West Point cadets who ride against the embattled John Brown in “bloody Kan- sas” shortly before the outbreak of hos- tilities. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 110 minutes) Like Dodge City and Virginia City, Sanata Fe Trail returns to the past for a period rich in historical associations and a place admirably suited to swift action and scenic requirements and then — blandly ignoring small matters of his- torical import - — - proceeds to unreel a grandiose, interesting and at times even gripping popular melodrama. The year is 1854, a year of smoulder- ing hatreds between the North and the South. Just before graduation at West Point, Jeb Stuart (the hero) fights with Rader, an unsavory disciple of John Brown, the famous Kansas abolitionist. Rader is discharged, but Jeb is graduated, dispatched by Commandant Robert E. Lee with six other graduates to “bloody Kansas.” After Jeb and his young officer friend, George Custer, fall in love with winsome Kit Holliday, operator of the Holliday freight service over the Santa Fe Trail, they gladly set out as part of a military convoy of one of the wagon trains. John Brown, who has meanwhile accepted Rader's aid, attacks the train with his followers. He is beaten off fi- nally, after a vicious fight, but betrayed by his young son, who reveals his hiding place before dying of wounds. Jeb sets out in pursuit, after hearing the sweet words from Kit, narrowly escapes hang- ing and death in a holocaust at the hands of Brown who is defeated again by the forces of Custer. Later, while attending a military ball at Washington with Kit, Jeb hears that Brown, deserted by Rader, has attacked the arsenal at Harper's Ferry. He leads the forces which precipitate Brown’s cap- ture, but not before the fiery abolitionist has killed Rader. At the finish Kit and Jeb are married on the Santa Fe Trail railroad. Michael Curtiz’ direction guarantees some powerful and stirring scenes, but the lack of either theme or continuity tends to offset isolated impressions. Errol Flynn as Jeb once again gallops about grimly but suavely as the handsome hero whose sturdy shoulders carry the weight of heroics. His followers should be com- pletely satisfied with this performance. Lovely Olivia de Havilland, sacrificing more feminine costumes for cowgirl garb, struggles commendably as Kit, the wagon train manager and general heroine, while Ronald Reagan fills a stock role as Geo. Custer. Raymond Massey as John Brown is perhaps too much the hard-riding fanatic but he brings talent and no end of vigor to his performance. Van Heflin as Rader is convincing, as are Alan Baxter and \"Big Boy” Williams as two comic cowboys. Most of the other actors on the roster, including those who portray his- torical personages, contribute routine work. LONE STAR RAIDERS: Produced and distributed by Republic Director: George Sherman Stony Brooke Robert Livingston Tucson Smith Bob Steele Lullaby Joslin Rufe Davis Linda June Johnson Martin George Douglas Granny Sarah Padden Three Mesquiteers adventure short of the series standard. The cowboys save an old lady’s ranch by winning a U. S. cavalry contract in spite of sagebrusli sabotage. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 57 minutes) Although it includes most of the usual western ingredients plus sequences show- ing beautiful wild horses. Lone Star Raiders, because of its shooting script, falls below the series level. Mesquiteer followers however, and even sterling western fans, should find the release at least tolerably entertaining. The Mesquiteers, Stony, Tucson and Lullaby, work for a ranch which is in- herited by a kindly old lady fresh out of the poor house. The ranch isn’t bring- ing in any money it seems, and wreckers in the ranks of the home boys threaten to thwart the Mesquiteers when they at- tempt to win an Army contract by round- ing up wild mustangs. The cactus fifth columnists are hired by a neighboring rancher who hopes to put the skids under the old lady’s outfit and grab all the gravy for himself. The climax is what counts most however, and the boys breeze through the cavalry-contract race in fine style, stumping the villains and saving the old lady. Robert Livingston, Bob Steele and Rufe Davis as the Mesquiteers continue their familiar characterizations with the latter supplying unimportant songs and comedy. Sarah Padden as the old lady leads the secondary players. PONY POST: Produced and distributed by Universal Director: Ray Taylor (Running time, 59 minutes) When Cal agrees to become operator of the pony express relay station in Ruby Valley right away you know he’s riding into trouble. There’s grief and gunfire, spurious Indian attacks and gen- eral skullduggery before the lurking cul- prit (the discharged post official) gets a cuffing-up and final quietus. Fuzzy Knight flips in somewhat uncertain fun efforts and there’s a stab at the stock romantic angle. Johnny Mack Brown as Cal handles the standard action assignment with com- petence enough, but the story just doesn’t seem to make much of an impression. Nell O’Day, Stanley Blystone and Tom Chatterton lead the support.

Today I see published one of the first, if not the first, of these lists. This is the list of those chosen b> the National Board of Review, that almost ancient and still honorable organization which represents women's clubs, civic organizations, etc. interested in the motion picture, an organization which has waged a stout battle against censorship boards, unnecessary and vicious legislation, and has consistently worked for better films and more intelligent audience apprecia- tion. Indeed the National Board of Review has published three lists, chosen from diff- erent points of view. A comparison oi these 1 find interesting. 1. The list of the reviewing committee based on the merits of the pictures, in the order of preference: The Grapes of Wrath The Great Dictator Of Mice and Men Our Town Fantasia The Long Voyage Home Foreign t-orrespondent The biscuit Eater Gone With the Wind Rebecca 2. A list by the same committee of the ten pictures considered to have the great- est popular appeal: Rebecca Gone With the Wind The Grapes of Wrath Fantasia Pride and Prejudice Foreign Correspondent The Great Dictator All This and Heaven Too Abe Lincoln in Illinois The Long Voyage Home 5. A list made from a poll of the mem- ber Motion Picture Councils, most oi which had not had opportunity to see Fantasia or The Great Dictator when the poll was taken: Rebecca All This and Heaven Too The Grapes of Wrath Pride and Prejudice Gone With the Wind Knute Rockne All American Abe Lincoln in Illinois The Howards of Virginia Foreign Correspondent Young Tom Edison Examination of these lists will show that Rebecca has reversed herself, last in the first list, first in the other two. It will show that only four of the films rated on their merits figure in the choice of the Councils. It will show a number of things which I, for one, find a bit amazing. I cannot understand the choice by any group of Young Tom Edison. It must be Mickey Rooney’s fatal charm. If I were going to put either of the Edison pictures into the list of tops, which I wouldn’t do, I would select Edison, the Man which 1 consider far superior. I would not put The Howards of Virginia in anything smaller than a list of the fifty-two best films of the year, I wouldn’t put The Great Dictator ahead of either The Long Voyage Home or Of Mice and Men. I would put Rebecca somewhere in the mid- dle instead of either first or last. In short my own list would not be like any of these. - — Penetrix \"The MOVIES • • • • 1940” Sibu “THE THIEF OF BAGDAD” THE THIEF OF BAGDAD: Produced by Alexander Korda; released by United Artists Directors: Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell Screenplay: Miles Malleson Scenario: Lajos Biro Music Score: Miklos Rozsa Photography: George Perinal, Osmond Borradaile Editor: Charles Crichton Jaffar Princess Ahmad Old King Jaffar’s Aide Merchant Astrologer Singer Jailer Story-teller Super-spectacle of screen wizardry Technicolor and mechanical magic; all lavish, eye-filling background for an Ara- bian Nights fantasy of Bagdad boy meet- ing Basra girl, their separation through the wiles or a wicked vizier, the final clinch brought about by a light-fingered urchin on a Hying carpet. (Adults SC Young People) (Running time, 105 minutes) Director Alexander Korda is reported to have said that this picture represents an attempt to do with living players what Disney has accomplished with cartoons. And the results have been as wildly im- probable, and, on the whole, as utterly delightful. The story itself is not an im- portant one; what matters is the pleasing riot of color from Mr. Korda s dripping palette. Retaining nothing of the earlier Fair- banks version but the title and general locale, The Thief of Bagdad tells the tale of the allied fortunes of a light-fingered gutter-snipe and the rightful occupant of the throne of Bagdad, both outcasts from the regime of the usurping Grand Visier. Abu, the little thief, and the deposed Ahmad meet in prison awaiting execution by Jaffar, the vizier. Abu steals the prison keys, and the two start off on a life of adventure. Ahmad, to the boy’s disgust, finds it in the sight of the beautiful Prin- cess of Basra, to look upon whom is death. Jaffar arrives to sue for the hand of the princess, sees his former captives, and in wrath, turns the boy into a dog and blinds Ahmad by the power of his magic. The senile King of Basra agrees to his daughter’s marriage to the upstart Jaffar in return for the- gift of a flying horse, a little invention of Jaffar’s. The Princess, however, is in a trance, and only the voice of Ahmed can wake her. Magic and a little applied psychology help Jaffar out at this point, but the course of true love is too strong even for him. It's Abu, back in his boyish shape again, who finally resolves the story’s many difficulties. He releases a Djinni from a sealed bottle, gets three wishes, steals the All-Seeing Eye from an idol guarded by a terrible spider, and finally, by dint of a trick, acquires a magic carpet and a super-magical bow and arrow with which to foil the wicked vizier, by this time running out of tricks himself. It's all done with mirrors, as the say- ing used to be, but to Sabu must go much of the credit for making a story a bit too much on the fantastic side both human and appealing. He plays the wiley scapegrace with superior ease, sings “1 Want To Be A Sailor” with appealing gravity, and wears an amusing small-boy superiority and scepticism before all the wonders he is confronted with. Conrad Veidt takes time off from his portrayals of strictly contemporary villains to get into the wicked spirit of the Grand Vizier’s part. He has never had the opportunity of combining menace with magic before; he does it here with fierce gusto. Rex Ingram is fierce and terrible, too, as the towering Djinni and unwilling servant of Abu. The lovers are given routine char- acterization by June Duprez and John Justin. The gouty old Sultan is effectively played by Miles Malleson. What with fly- ing horses and aerial carpets, magic weap- ons and contrivances and the most subtle and satisfying color tones yet seen in Technicolor, the cast have a time of it keeping in the running. They do, though, and help to make The Thief of Bagdad the fascinating, unbelievably beautiful, and truly poetic achievement that it is. If you go accepting fantasy for what it is worth, you should not fail to find this picture a grand show with appeal for all ages. NOBODY’S CHILDREN: Produced and distributed by Columbia Director: Charles Barton Screenplay: Doris Malloy Story: Walter White, Jr. Photography: Benjamin Kline Editor: Richard Fantl Pat Edith Fellows Tommy Billy Lee Mrs. Marshall Georgia Caine Miss Jamieson Lois Wilson Walter White, Jr Walter White, Jr. Mr, Millar Ben Taggart Mrs. Miller Mary Currier Mary Mary Gordon Sentimental drama about orphanage children based on Walter White, Jr.’s weekly radio program. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 64 minutes) Starring Edith Fellows, the Little Pep- per, as a crippled orphan, Nobody’s Chil- dren sympathetically probes into the pri- vate lives of institution youngsters. In- spired by Walter White’s radio program “Nobody’s Children,” the film bids suc- cessfully for tears and heart-tugs in a tale concerned with the efforts of orphanage directors to place their charges in private homes. Nobody wants to adopt Pat, the crippled girl, so Tommy bravely bears up, turning down offers of adoption because of his sister’s infirmity. Pat herself finally persuades him to accept parents even though she is past the age limit and must soon enter a state home for invalids. Finally she too is adopted and after much sentimental turmoil the courageous young- sters are reunited. The saccharine material is well handled by the cast, especially Edith Fellows as Pat, the snuling-through-tears heroine and Billy Lee as brother Tommy. Ben Tag- gart and Mary Currier as an adoption- minded couple and Lois Wilson as a supervisor show up well in lesser roles. Walter White, Jr. plays himself without sacrificing naturalness. 49 \"The MOVIES *«**#• 194®” ELLERY QUEEN, MASTER DETECTIVE: Produced by Larry Darmour for Columbia Director: Kurt Neumann Screenplay: Eric Taylor Story: Ellery Queen Photography: James Brown, Jr. Editor: Dwight Caldwell Ellery Queen Ralph Bellamy Nikki Porter Margaret Lindsay Inspector Queen Charley Grapewin Sergeant Velie James Burke Dr. James Rogers Michael Whalen Barbara Braun Marsha Hunt John Braun Fred Niblo Dr. Prouty Charles Lane Lydia Braun Ann Shoemaker Cornelai Marion Martin Rocky Taylor Douglas Fowley Zachary Morgan Wallace Amos Byron Foulger Valerie Norris Katherine DcMille Averagely absorbing murder mystery introducing Ralph Bellamy as Ellery Queen of radio and novel fame; the sleuth hides a girl suspect whom he knows is innocent and then seeks out the real killer. (Adults Si Young People) (Running time, 69 minutes) Ellery Queen’s first case on celluloid is an unexceptional but competent affair which cuts a nice initial for the series. The film has its draggy moments, but taken as a whole the material should satisfy. Vieing with his father, Police Inspector Queen, Ellery hides a young woman, Nikki Porter, in the apartment shared with the Inspector as the police hunt the girl for the murder of a physical culturist. Ellery — and the audience — know that Nikki is innocent, even though her finger- prints were found at the scene of the crime. Disappearance of the murdered man’s will, and later the disappearance ot his corpse, contribute to a tough knot of complications which Ellery finally unties with the help of Nikki. The picture has a helpful spooky angle, as well as a quota of comedy relief. Ellery Queen is credibly portrayed by Ralph Bellamy, and Margaret Lindsay makes a refreshing foil and suspect as Nikki Porter. A solid characterization is achieved by Charley Grapewin as In- spector Queen. The supporters haven’t much to do but Michael Whalen, Marsha Hunt and Fred Niblo especially concen- trate on performances of standard calibre. MEET THE MISSUS: Produced and distributed by Republic Director: Mai St. Clair Screenplay: Val Burton, Ewart Anderson, Taylor Cavan Photography: Ernest Miller Editor: Ernest Nims Joe Higgins Roscoe Karns Lil Higgins Ruth Donnelly Grandpa Spencer Charters Sidney Higgins George Ernest Betty Higgins Lois Ranson Widow Jones Polly Moran Violet Astrid Allwyn Johnny Williams Alan Ladd Slullingford Harry Woods Millie Lou Dorothy Ann Seesc Mr. Godfrey Harry Tyler Higgins Family comedy introducing a new cast in old situations; the loss of negotiable bonds sets off a train of mildly humorous complications which involve Grandpa with a young widow and Joe with a blonde. (Adults Si Young People) (Running time, 68 minutes) With Roscoe Karns, Ruth Donnelly and George Ernest handling the Higgins Family roles formerly played by Jimmy, Lucille and Russell Gleason, Meet the Missus advances without ado into a string of familiar domestic adventures. The trouble starts when young Sidney loses some bonds which he was supposed to have delivered for Joe Higgins' employer. Grandpa woos the widow Jones in an ef- fort to raise cash to cover the loss and then Joe himself falls under suspicion when his attempts to straighten things out involve him with Violet, a blonde with a jealous boyfriend. Eventually Betty Hig- gins’ fiance smooths out the family tangle. Even though they have been employed often in the past, the mirth circumstances still bring out laughs. The new Higginses fill their character roles agreeably enough, while Spencer Charters and Lois Ranson in their usual parts maintain the assign ment standard. Polly Moran as the Widow Jones, Astrid Allwyn as Violet, Alan Ladd and Harry Woods serve in the secondary roles. WEST OF PINTO BASIN: Produced by George W. Weeks; released by Monogram Director: S. Roy Luby Screenplay: Sari Enell Story: Elmer Clifton Photography: Ed Linden Editor: Roy Claire Dusty John Kinn Crash Ray Corrigan Alibi Max Terhune Joan Gwen Gaze Harvey Tristan Coffin Hank Dirk Thane Lane George Chesebro Joe Carl Matthews Sheriff Bud Osborne Summers Phil Dunham Jones Bud Smith Jerry Jerry Smith Cactus-country yarn constructed for the average western fan; the Range Busters ride against a gang of plotters who plan to buy up land at nominal prices by rob- bing all the payrolls sent through for dam construction. (Adults Si Young People) (Running time, 60 minutes) Third in the Range Busters series fea- turing King, Corrigan and Terhune, West of Pinto Basin runs along regulation lines, working the formula for an unspectacular but satisfactory episode. This time the trouble busting trio relys on their wits and their riding skill to overcome a' range- grabber who sends out masked stooges to lift all arriving payrolls. The mob king figures to interfere with the building of a dam which is being constructed to help the drought-plagued basin dwellers. When the latter give up hope he'll purchase all the land for peanuts and sit pretty. The Busters however decide otherwise. They're harried hither and yon, into jail and out, before the finish, but the badmen bounce in basin dust ere the fadeout. “Crash,” “Dusty” and “Alibi” combine talents for a balanced blend of stiff riding, light ro- mance and humor. Both Corrigan and King dally for the hand of heroine Gwen Gaze but they breeze off at the end so there must be another episode in the works. Songs include “That Little Prairie Gal of Mine,” sung by King; plus \"Rhythm of the Saddle” and “Ridin’ the Trail Tonight” delivered by Jerry Smith, ’The Yodeling Cowboy.’ They aren’t bad. DR. KILDARE’S CRISIS: Produced and released by MGM Director: Harold S.

The comedy element is subordinated to the medical aspect, but all ends well. (Adults) (Running time, 73 minutes) Unfolded in a more dramatic atmos- phere than a number of earlier episodes in the series. Dr. Kildare’s Crisis intro- duces Robert Young as Douglas Lamont, nurse Mary Lamont’s brother. Arriving from the west as Mary and Dr. Kildare are making plans for their wedding. Douglas arouses the attention of the young physician by his peculiar behavior. The doctor questions him, finally decides that he is afflicted with hereditary epi- lepsy. Mary learns the result of Dr. Kil- dare's diagnosis, cancels the wedding plans and bravely determines to return home and care for her brother, even though she is heartbroken. At this juncture the forthright Dr. Gillespie wheels in, ac- quaints himself with developments after a bit of maneuvering and lifts a crushing weight by proving that Douglas’ alternate fits of enthusiasm and despair are caused by an old head injury. Following an oper- ation which restores normalcy, Mary and Dr. Kildare continue their wedding plans. The regular cast — Lew Ayres as young Dr. Kildare, Lionel Barrymore as Dr. Gil- lespie, the cross, kind-hearted wizard of the sick room, and Laraine Day as Miss Lamont, the sweet angel in white, settle into their roles with the polish acquired by experience, while Robert Young as the afflicted brother brings intensity to a somewhat exacting assignment. While the emphasis on epilepsy may tend to estrange certain audience groups, the film's general competence should satisfy the majority. 5Q \"The MOVIES ® • 9 ® 1940” NIGHT TRAIN: 20th Century-Fox release of Gaumont- British production Director: Carol Reed Screenplay: Sydney Gilliat, Frank Launder Story: Gordon Wellesley Photography: Otto Kanturek Editor: R.

Prada Austen Trevor Costroller Kenneth Kent Admiral Hassinger C. V. France Taut, thoroughly entertaining British- made comedy melodrama; an English agent disguised as a German officer aids an attractive Czech girl and her aged father in a thrilling escape from Naziland. (Adults SC Young People) (Running time, 90 minutes) Tempered by zestful comedy, tightly spun from a compact script which builds steadily toward the climax in an atmos- phere of nerve-tingling intensity. Night Train reaffirms the reputation which the British have established for themselves as masters of first-class melodrama. The film may suffer because of its indisputable re- semblance to The Lady Vanishes, which was produced by the same English studio and which included in its cast several of the same players featured in the present release, but the picture’s exciting, smooth- ly-paced and smoothly directed sequences should easily overcome its lack of origi- nality. The story opens in the breathless days of early August, 1929. A German spy in London rounds up two escaped Czechs, Anna Bomasch, a lovely young girl, and her aged father, an armor-plate inventor. A cunning British Secret Service oper- ator secretly follows the trio to Germany, impersonates a Nazi official, survives hec- tic events as war is declared and finally leads the two Czechs in a headlong and highly exciting dash into Switzerland. Director Carol Reed effectively blends the farcical comedy slant with the pre- dominant thrill appeal, carefully muster- ing the complete story pattern against a background suggesting suspense and im- pending disaster. Characterizations are authentic and neatly executed. Margaret Lockwood, feminine lead in The Lady Vanishes, arouses sympathy in a cleancut performance as the Czech girl and Rex H arrison is efficiently nonchalant as the British agent. Paul von Hernreid seems believably sly and certain as the Gestapo man. Basil Radford and Naunto Wayne repeat their Lady Vanishes performances as cricket-minded Englishmen on tour. Margaret Lockwood Rex Harrison “NIGHT TRAIN*’ A NIGHT AT EARL CARROLL’S: Produced by Earl Carroll for Paramount Director: Kurt Neumann Screenplay: Lynn Starling Photography: Leo Tover Art Directors: Hans Drier, Robert Odell Editor: Alma Macrorie Barney Nelson Ken Murray Ramona Lisa Rose Hobart Cobina Gusher Elvia Allman Brenda Gusher Blanche Stewart Earl Carroll Earl Carroll Lillian Lillian Cornell Steve Kalkus J. Carroll Naish Lela Moore Lela Moore Alonzo Smith Jack Norton Mayor Jones of Hollywood.... Russell Hicks Slow-paced comedy melodrama with music set against the background of Earl Carroll’s Hollywood night club-theatre. Vaudeville gags and shapely chorus girls fail to compensate for a thin story outline which deals with the the attempts of a gangster to revenge himself on a reform mayor by kidnapping Carroll and his im- portant performers. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 62 minutes) Leaning too heavily on its display of the Carroll cuties' lovely legs, this musical melodrama lapses into a sort of glorified advertisement for the renowned theatre restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Specialty acts and comic interludes are sprinkled through the sketchy reels, but the show seldom overcomes its script limitations. The lackadaisical proceedings get under way when Steve Kalkus, a gangster who has been hounded by the new reform- conscious mayor of Hollywood, kidnaps Carroll and most of the floor show just as H is Honor, Mayor Jones, enters the luxurious night club with fellow officials to celebrate the crook cleanup. The re- maining performers are then faced with the ■ task of entertaining the visiting mayors. Barney Nelson, Carroll’s press agent, and Ramona Lisa, his assistant, manage to string along impromptu acts with the aid of the other principals until Earl and his performers break loose and get* back to the club. Ken Murray as the press agent and Rose Hobart as Ramona work up a few amusing touches, while J. Carroll Naish as the gangster as well as Russell Hicks as the mayor deserve compliments for try- ing at least. Blanche Stewart and Elvira Allman (Brenda and Cobina of the Bob Hope radio show) continue their frantic manhunt, Jack Norton enacts the stand- ard drunk, and Lillian Cornell sings “Li’l Boy Love.” To Earl Carroll go the bally- hoo producer credits. 51 \"The MOVIES • • • • 1940” LONE WOLF KEEPS A DATE: Produced and distributed by Columbia Director: Sidney Salkow Screenplay: Earl Felton, Sidney Salkow Photography: Barney McGill Editor: Richard Fantl Michael Lanyard Warren Williams Patricia Lawrence Frances Robinson Scotty Bruce Bennett Jamison Eric Blorc Inspector Crane Thurston Hall Captain Moon Jed Prouty Dickens Fred Kelsey Big Joe Brady Don Beddoe Mr. Lee Lester Matthews Chimp Edward Gargan Measles Eddie Laughton Mrs. Colby Mary Servoss Competent crime comedy in which Mike Lanyard once again fools crooks and cops in a Havana kidnapping case. The usual unlikely situations are satisfactorily decked out by virtue of good acting and amusing dialogue. (Adults & Young People) (Running time, 63 minutes) This latest chapter in the adventure' some life of the Lone Wolf finds the debonair detective traveling by air to Havana in order to enter his stamp col- lection in a convention. As soon as the plane lands however, he finds himself en- tangled with the underworld. Driving away two men who were trying to force a young girl into a car, he learns that the would-be kidnappers were after $100,000 in ransom money which was to be paid for the release of a millionaire. Pat, the girl, intends to use the money in order to free her boyfriend. Scotty, who has been unjustly jailed. After taking charge of the case, Mike himself is captured and brought to Big Joe’s casino. Promising a cut-in on the ransom money, the Lone Wolf natches a ruse which brings out the police, saves the millionaire's life and trips the kidnappers. It's all enacted in a spirit of fun. Comedy, rather than scientific crime de- tection, is the keynote. Warren William maintains his man-of-the-world poise in the lead role, aided by Eric Blore as Jamison, the comic valet. Thurston Hall and Jed Prouty as thwarted police of- ficials earn some choice laughs, while Frances Robinson as Pat conducts herself well in a patterned role. IT’S IN THE AIR: Produced by Basil Dean; presented by B. S. B. Corp.

Denier Warren Adjutant Michael Shcpley Nobby Hal Gordon Silly British slapstick comedy featuring George Fromby as an accidental R. A. F. pilot. The leading English comedian clowns through farcical antics culminating in a typical wild plane flight. (Adults & Young People) (Running time, 74 minutes) War or no war, the British sense ol humor knows no blackout. Produced dur- ing the last year. It’s In the Air presents the popular horse-faced comedian, George Formby, in ludicrous broad comedy se- quences tailored for a typical British audi- ence. The nonsense reels are well knit however, and the laugh appeal of the lanky English cutup will not be lost on American audiences — especially Joe E Brown and Laurel and Hardy adherents. The fun begins after George puts on a uniform to help out a friend and finds himself taken in tow by a tough sergeant major. He competes for the hand of the commanding officer's eye-catching daugh- ter, suffers as a result of schemes hatched by a flying field joker, runs against the sergeant major and at last takes to the air for a test flight. His lack of flying know- ledge is demonstrated in a familiar but still funny stunt sequence which winds up the doings. The farce gains an added asset because of the fact that it was filmed on actual English flying fields with the cooperation of the R. A. F. Comedy of course re- mains the picture's chief merit. Besides Formby, who carries the important chores, the cast includes likable Polly Ward as the love interest, Julien Mitchell as the splut- tering sergeant-major and Jack Hobbs as the rival. The situations are by no means novel, but it’s an effective dash of slap- stick nevertheless. THE BORDER LEGION: Produced and distributed by Republic Director: Joseph Kane Screenplay: Olive Cooper, Louis Stevens Story: Zane Grey Photography: Jack Marta Editor: Edward Mann Steve Kells Roy Rogers Honest John Whittaker' 'Gabby' Hayes Gulden Joseph Sawyer Hurricane Hattie Maude Eburne Santos Jay Novello The Sheriff Hal Taliaferro Red Dick Wcssel Tony Paul Porcasi Officer Willets Robert Emmett Keane Rog Rogers as a frameup fugitive goes west and trips up an outlaw gang. The story’s threadbare, but the acting’s good and the pace adequate. (Adults &C Young People) (Running time, $8 minutes) As Steve Kells, a doctor fleeing a New York frameup, Roy Rogers journeys to Idaho and as luck would have it settles in the territory where a mob of plunderers operate. Steve is really protecting the bro- ther of his fiance, Alice, who follows him to the cow country. Before long he’s em- broiled with the badmen, who accept him as a fellow outlaw until the roar of guns and the stamp of hooves die away, leav- ing them in the hands of the law. This Zane Grey novel adaptation has its dull moments, but the script keeps ac- tion stirring most of the way. Although it’s never explained how Steve Kells, the Easterner, becomes an accomplished gun- and-fist artist almost overnight, it must be admitted that Roy Rogers handles the role with all the required conviction. He sings a couple of songs too, without slow- ing up the action much. George “Gabby” Hayes furnishes light comedy relief, and Carol Hughes as heroine Alice poses well enough. Of the gentlemen who receive their just deserts, Joseph Sawyer and Jay Novello stand out most prominently. Maude Eburne as Hurricane Hattie, a tough-hided saloon keeper, fills a helpful character role. SOUTH OF SUEZ: Produced and distributed by Warner Brothers Director: Lewis Seiler Screenplay: Barry Trivers Story: Sheridan Gibney John Gamble George Brent Katherine Sheffield Brenda Marshall Eli Snedeker George Tobias Inspector Thornton James Stephenson Delia Snedeker Lee Patrick Limey Eric Blore Roger Smythe Miles Mander Henry Putnam Cecil Kellaway Mrs. Putnam Mary Forbes Manders Gilbert Emery Prosecutor Stanley Logan Defense Counsel Frederick Worlock Judge Edward Fielding Competently-acted melodrama about a South African diamond mine operator who flees a murder frameup, falls in love with the daughter of the man he is sup- posed to have killed and at length wins vindication when the real murderer’s wife betrays him. (Adults) (Running time minutes) Good average melodrama arising from familiar complications. Eli Snedeker, Af- rican diamond mine owner, murders Smythe, a rival, in order to obtain s fabulous diamond and then directs sus- picion against Gamble, Smythe’s business partner, whom he believes is interested in his wife, Delia Snedeker. Gamble, who has actually repulsed the amorous woman, escapes to London with a fortune in dia- monds and changes his identity. He in- tends to deliver the wealth to the mur- dered man’s daughter, Katherine, with whom he falls in love. He is arrested finally and tried for murder but cleared when the calloused Delia reveals the guilt of her ruthless husband. George Brent, well cast as Gamble, carries through his assignment with due vigor, and Brenda Marshall is pleasant and capable enough as Katherine. Snede- ker, the killer, is strongly portrayed by George Tobias. Lee Patrick also, as Delia, brings power to a thankless role. Eric Blore as Gamble's comic friend, Miles Mander and James Stephenson provide acceptable support. The intrigue is inter- esting, if not impressive. 52 Th.

TALKING IT OVER Representatives of Better Films Councils and the like who have protested to their theatre managers about the showing oi certain films or the combination of certain films in double-feature programs have al- ways been met with the excuse that the manager couldn’t help it — that owing to the rules and regulations of the block- booking system he was obliged to buy and to show films which, really madam, he would personally prefer not to exhibit. I remember with relish the refreshingly frank statement of one theatre manager at the Senate Committee hearing on the Neely Bill, which, as you will recall, was designed to pass legislation against the practice of block-booking. He said that the word “Block-booking” was the best alibi a theatre manager could possibly have and admitted that he himself had frequently used it in order to get rid of such deputations. Now the Neely Bill, which I myself al- ways thought a particularly bad piece of attempted legislation, looks to be a back number. And since the signing, on Nov. 20th, of the “consent decree” in the Gov- ernment’s anti-trust suit against the mo- tion picture industry, block-booking also became pretty much of a back number. The changes agreed to in their trade prac- tices, by all the major companies except Columbia, United Artists and Universal, ruin the theatre manager’s best defense against the attack of the Better Films or- ganizations. What alibi will he use now ? If any partially defunct Better Films Council, and many of them have died a natural death or at least in a state of coma owing to the generally higher quality of films produced, is now looking for a program, may I suggest that it might well put on a campaign for better habits and manners in movie audiences. Or since it is always easier to campaign against something rather than for some- thing such a council might put on a drive against: Late comers. An effort should be made to get the theatres to publish the times the pro- gram changes and to make the public as time conscious about a motion pic- ture as about a play or a concert. Women who keep their hats on in the theatre. Some are born courteous, others may be made so. Seat squirmers. The people who are always changing their position so that everyone behind has to keep dodging to see around them. Noisy children The bane of theatre managers and au- diences alike. Cellophane. The practice of wrapping not only the box but every chocolate in the box in this annoyingly crackly material. Such a five-point program might be in- corporated in a polite trailer which could be flashed on the screen at every perform- ance. “In the interest of greater enjoy- ment the Better Films Council of This- ville urges, etc., etc.” In the past few years the industry has certainly improved the films for the pub- lic. H ow about the public improving its manners at the films ? — Penetrix \"The MOVIES 1940” BLACKOUT: Produced by John Corfleld for British Films; released in U. S. by United Artists Director: Michael Powell Screenplay: Emeric Pressburger Story: Emeric Pressburger Scenario: Michael Powell, Brock Williams Musical Director: Muir Mathieson Photography: F. A. Young Editor: John Seaborne Captain Andersen Conrad Veidt Mrs. Sorensen Valerie Hobson Skold (Mate of S. S. Helvig) ....Hay Petrie Skold (Chef of “3 Vikings\" ).. Hay Petrie Mr. Pidgeon Esmond Knight Van Dyne Raymond Lovell Hendrick Charles Victor Singer in \"Regency\" Paddy Browne Gripping, powerfully produced British- made spy melodrama featuring Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson as a Danish sea captain and an English agent who sur- vive spectacular entanglements with a German espionage ring operating in the heart of London during a blackout. (Adults St Young People) (Running time, 80 minutes) Produced during the early days of the present war. Blackout deals with espionage and counter-espionage carried out in Lon- don during an air-raid alarm. Due largely to the dynamic yet subtle direction of Michael Powell and the remarkable per- formances of Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson, the picture lines up as one of the most exciting spy stories to be issued for some time. Displaying a Hitchcockian flair for restrained, hair-raising melodrama, Powell pours into the film a vital impact which is strengthened at all times by ex- pert sets and a muscular, moodily ranging camera. Stopped on the Channel by a British patrol ship searching for contraband, Hans Andersen, captain of the Danish Helvig finally decides to make the best of the predicament, accepts the English com- mander’s invitation to dine ashore. As he is about to leave the freighter however, he learns that his landing permits, and two passengers, a talent scout, and an at- tractive young lady who has already aroused his interest are missing. Andersen follows the pair on the London train, catches “Mrs. Sorensen,” the girl, at Waterloo Station, where the scout escapes. Mrs. Sorensen refuses to talk, but allows the determined Dane to accompany her through blacked-out London. When they arrive at the girl’s aunt’s house just be- fore train time, the couple are confronted by an armed group which forces them to a basement hideaway. There Andersen learns that the kidnappers are German agents and that “Mrs. Sorensen” is in reality a British spy. The girl maintains silence in the face of threats, is finally tied up along with the captain and left to con- sider what will ensue if she continues to withhold secret information. How the cap tain escapes, how he manages to discover the location of the building in darkened London, and how he rescues his beautiful companion at the last moment, furnish materia! for the stirring sequences which lead to the climax. An appropriate note of romance closes the proceedings. Valerie Hobson “BLACKOUT” Though it moves ahead with never a static moment, the film finds time to cap- ture some superb seascapes and London scenes. The acting is just about as ac- complished as any could be. Conrad Veidt as Andersen employs again a naturalness, a complete lack of pose, which makes his role exceptionally convincing, while Va- lerie Hobson as the feminine British agent is as assured and poised as she is attrac- tive. Raymond Lovell as the chief Ger- man spy contributes a splendidly unsym- pathetic performance. LITTLE MEN: Produced by Gene Towne and Graham Baker; distributed by RKO Director: Norman Z. McLeod Screenplay: Mark Kelly, Arthur Caesar Story: Louisa May Alcott Photography: Nicholas Musuraca Editor: George Hively Jo Willie Maj. Burdle Dan Nan Kay Francis Teddy Richard Nichols Robby Bess Francesca Santoro Silas Asia Tommy Demi Daisy Jack Adolphus Nat Schuyler Standish Stuffy Sentimental adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s novel; a swindler takes charge of an orphan, places him in a boys’ school which he nearly ruins and then finally saves. (Adults St Young People) (Running time, 84 minutes) Towne and Baker’s version of Little Men considerably revises the original, en- dowing Dan, the tough tyke, with a shyster foster-father, Major Burdle. The major feels a sense of responsibility after he falls heir to the infant son of a friend and finally places the youngster in a rep- utable boarding school run by motherly Mrs. Jo. He accepts money from Jo and her professor husband, loses it when the bank fails. The day is saved however, when Willie the Fox, an amiable crook and friend of the Major, is surrendered to the law officers for a $5,000 reward. Dan, the young ruffian, meanwhile re- form’s in Jo’s school. Although the film retains the leisurely air of the original, much of the novel’s quaint appeal has been lost. The added plot elements too often seem artificial. Jack Oakie as Willie the Fox does the best he can with the material, getting a number of good laughs, but none of the other performers are more than passable: Kay Francis as the sympathetic Mrs. Jo, Jimmy Lydon as Dan, the calloused youngster, and George Bancroft as the Major included. Elsie, the glamour cow, adheres to the spirit of Louisa May’s Buttercup. THE FARGO KID: Produced and distributed by RKO Director: Edward Killy Screenplay: Morton Grant, Arthur V. Jones Story: W. C. Tuttle Photography: Harry Wild Editor: Frederic Knudston Fargo Kid Tim Holt Johnny Ray Whitley Whopper Emmett Lynn Jennie Jane Drummond Nick Cyrus W. Kendall Bush Ernie Adams Deuce Paul Fix Caleb Paul Scardon Sheriff Glenn Strange Sarah Mary MacLaren Another favorable western offering; Tim Holt is mistaken for an imported killer by a pair of crooks who live to regret their error. (Adults St Young People) (Running time, 63 minutes) RKO’s second release in the western series featuring Tim Holt turns out to be a simple, neatly trimmed story which offers the hero plenty of opportunity to demon- strate his saddle skill. Entering the gold country in a search for pals Johnny and Whopper, Tim is mistaken for a notori- ous outlaw by a brace of badmen who have sent for a killer to dispose of an elderly mine owner. The crooks plan to jump the claim once the old man is out of the way, figuring that the mother and daughter won’t be able to oppose them. Tim, of course, turns out to be the knight who thwarts all this. There’s a clatter of hooves and a crash of six-guns and you know the rest. Worked in unobtrusively are songs by Ray Whitley (Johnny) and his rangers, a restrained romance involv- ing Jane Drummond, who plays the miner’s daughter, and humor contributed by Holt himself. The release is stronger than the previous edition and augurs well for the series. 53 \"The MOVIES • • • • 1940” THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO: Produced by Edward Small; released by United Artists Director: Rowland V. Lee Screenplay: George Bruce Photography: George Robinson Editor: Arthur E. Roberts Count of Monte Cristo Louis Hayward Grand Duchess Zona Joan Bennett Gurko Lanen George Sanders Mathilde Florence Bates Colonel Zimmerman Lionel Royce Baron Von Neuhoff Montagu Love Conrad Stadt Ian Mac Wolfe Fritz Dorner Clayton Moore Gluck Ralph Byrd French Ambassador George Renavent Pavlov Michael Visaroff Hans Mirbach Rand Brooks Captain Theodore von Eltz Lieutenant James Seay Schultz Henry Brandon Schm.dt Jack Mulhall Turnkey Edward Keane The Baron Lawrence Grant Picturesque but plodding costume melo- drama about the swashbuckling young hero who rescues the beautiful Lady of Lichtenburg caught in the machinations of empire, thwarts the villain at the wed- ding ceremony and finally wins the glam- orous queen himself. (Adults & Young People) (Running time, 102 minutes) Opulent backgrounds, elegant costumes and a conventional cloak-and-carriage script cannot, it seems, quite compensate for a decided lack of animation. The Son of Monte Cristo attenuates the Dumas legend without infusing any new force into familiar sword situations. Grand Duchess Zona of Lichtenburg, a princi- pality involved in dealings between Bis- mark and the Czar, hurries toward Paris to enlist the aid of Napoleon III, hotly pursued by the troops of Gurko Lanen, dastardly dictator of Lichtenburg. The gallant son of Monte Cristo happens along, saves her for the moment, but later travels to the little country disguised as a banker when the ever active forces of evil threaten to overwhelm the lovely lady. Dashing about as “The Torch” in a black cape and mask, Cristo attempts to liberate the country. He is jailed finally, but bolts prison just in time to run a blade through Gurko, who is about to be made the hus- band of a languishing Duchess in a dagger wedding which will confirm his clutch on the helpless kingdom. Neither Director Rowland V. Lee nor Scripter George Bruce deserve much credit for this undistinguished dilution of Dumas. The intrigue is often telegraphed and the dialogue frequently becomes static and stilted. Edward Small’s produc- tion embellishments seem to constitute about the only feature of the show which is above adverse criticism. Louis Hayward as The Son of Monte Cristo displays gusto and agility but it is George Sanders as the despotic Gurko who contributes some genuine acting. Joan Bennett, beautifully arrayed in an assortment of elegant costumes as the Grand Duchess Zona, is alluring but list- less. Lionel Royce, Montagu Love and Florence Bates fill helpful character roles. It’s romantic make-believe unreeled on a rather routine level, but patrons seeking pure escapist entertainment will be by no means entirely disappointed with the show. DARK STREETS OF CAIRO: Produced and distributed by Universal Director: Leslie Kardos Screenplay: Alex Gottlieb Photography: Elwood Bredell Ellen Dennis Jerry Jones Abadi Shan Joachim Khattab Margo Baron Hessien Ahmend Nardo Bellboy Prof. Wynham Minus melodrama; the old story about the archeological expedition, the gems of the pharaoh, the Egyptian bandits and dark doings in the subterranean passage. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 59 minutes) In spite of the hundreds of American archeological expeditions that have slip- ped into Egypt via the celluloid route and lifted jewels from the mummy’s tomb, the supply of gems just never gives out. This time it’s the “Seven Jewels of the Seventh Pharaoh.” There’s a scientific expedition including the inevitable young he-man ad- venturer, a rich, gem-dealing Swedish baron with a romantic daughter, a lurking Abadi, dark-skinned and suave, and. oh yes, the exotic daughter of said villain who is sold on the local British repre- sentative of law and order. Once the stage is cluttered for action, the story moves forward through its frame of cliches to- ward a highly melodramatic climax which ends with the villain thwarted, the jewels recovered and the girl safe in the hands of the hero. Sigrid Gurie as the girl, Ralph Byrd as the American he-man, and George Zucco as Abadi top the cast with toler- able performances. George Quillan’s at- tempts at humor would make a mummy groan. Katherine DeMille as the daughter of the lurking jewel thief is fairly well cast, and newcomer Yollande Mollot shows ability as the shapely target for a knife thrower. THE OLD SWIM MIN’ HOLE: Produced and distributed by Monogram Director: Robert McGowan Story: Gerald Breitigam Screenplay: Dorothy Reid Photography: Harry Neumann Editor: Russell Schoengarth Chris Jackie Moran Betty Marcia Mae Jones Julie Leatrice Joy Doc. Elliott Charles Brown Baker Theodore Von Eltz Harper George Cleveland Jimmy Dix Davis Wholesome family comedy drama about two adolescent youngsters who strive to promote a romance involving their parents. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 75 minutes) After Betty arrives to visit her father, Doc Elliott of Oakdale, she determines to remain in order to collect some of his bills and deepen his interest in the mother of her new friend, young Chris. Chris, inspired by Doc Elliott, hopes to become a medico himself, but lack of funds pre- vents his widowed mother sending him to medical school. Even though he has to leave high school to support his mother however, Chris turns down an offer by his grandfather, who says he will educate the boy if Mrs. Harper will agree not to see her son until he is of age. When it begins to look as if Barker, the grand- father’s lawyer, might propose to Chris’ mother, Doc Elliott finally discovers that he is in love with the widow. His offer is accepted of course, and the youngsters are made happy. Jackie Moran and Marcia Mae Jones as Chris and Betty, Leatrice Joy and Charles Brown as Mrs. Harper and Doc Elliott, provide warmly human portrayals which maintain interest in the unspectacular pro- ceedings. It’s minor but generally agree- able family fare. WAGONS WESTWARD: Produced by Armand Schaefer for Republic Director: Lew Landers Screenplay: Joseph Moncure March, Harrison Jacobs Photography: Ernest Miller Editor: Ernest Nims David Cook - Tom Cook. ...Chester Morris Phyllis Anita Louise Sheriff McDaniels Buck Jones Julie Ona Munson Hardtack George ‘Gabby' Hayes Hardman ‘Big Boy’ Williams Marsden Douglas Fowley Blackie John Gallaudet Angela Cook Virginia Brissac Alan Cook Trevor Bardette Major Marlowe Selmer Jackson Pima Charles Stevens David as a boy Wayne Hull Tom as a boy Warren Hull Over-complicated but well-acted western about the upright cowboy who poses as his twin outlaw brother and finally catches the whole robber crew. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 70 minutes) In spite of ambitious production mount- ing, Wagons Westward rolls along on a routine level. The cast performs well enough but a confused plot pattern un- aided by poor direction holds the piece to a one-star rating. When outlaw Tom Cook is captured and sent to jail, his twin brother David, who looks just like him, rides off to impersonate the badman as head of the cactus gangsters. The scheme succeeds ultimately, but not before he has become romantically involved with Phyllis, a dance-hall girl who mistakes David for Tom. David marries Phyllis when he is urged to do so by Julie, Phyllis’ sister, whom he really loves. Tom finally escapes, slays Phyllis whom he believes untrue and then receives his just deserts at the hands of David, who is left free to fall again under the spell of Julie. There’s an at least average amount of action inserted between the love scenes, although some of it, including the night gun battle which marks the climax, is none too impressive. Chester Morris manages the dual twin role with due emphasis on the extremes of good and evil. Anita Louise acts well, but seems miscast, as Phyllis, the dance- ludl girl; and the same thing might be 54 \"The MOVIES .... 1940” said of Buck Jones, who plays the part of a crooked sheriff. Ona Munson as Julie shares romantic interest convincingly, while George “Gabby” Hayes supplies comedy in spite of some soggy lines. TRAIL OF THE VIGILANTES: Produced and distributed by Universal Director: Allan Dwan Screenplay: Harold Shumate Photography: Joseph Valentine, Milton Krasner Art Director: Jack Otterson Editor: Edward Curtiss Kansas Franchot Tone Mark Dawson Warren William Swanee - Broderick Crawford Meadows Andy Devine Bolo Mischa Auer Sheriff Korley Porter Hall Barbara Thornton Peggy Moran John Thornton Charles 1 rowbridge Delightful comedy-action western intro- ducing Franchot Tone as a young marshal who invades Peaceful Valley to subdue the slick leader of rampaging Vigilantes. Wild brawls, hectic pursuits and forthright romance handled with a light farcical touch lift the proceedings far above the conventional level. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 75 minutes) A swift-moving, rib-tickling travesty on formula westerns, Trail of the Vigilantes scuffles along at top speed successfully playing hilarity against a broad action pat- tern. Director Dawn has taken a set of time-worn cowboy-picture conventions and built them into a refreshing and continu- ously entertaining production. Franchot Tone, a somewhat naive Kansas City marshal, is dispatched to the wild ranges of Peaceful Valley to crack down on the smooth leader of cactus racketeers who exploit the rancher folk. He enlists the assistance of Swanee, a handy customer with gun and fist, finds himself on the receiving end of a romantic blitzkrieg launched by Barbara, a blue-eyed, petite and completely unabashed ranch owner's daughter, and soon becomes involved with Dawson, the dastardly villain who heads the blackmailing cattle men. Before the final wildfire pursuit through the streets of the town, there’s a whirling as sortment of crosscountry breakaway flights, violent brawls, farcical buffoonery scenes, etc. Novel insertions include a sequence in which Tone, on horseback, crashes into a savage saloon fight, a unique bull fight, and an all-out chase with the girl in the hands of the villain and all tarnation thundering along in pursuit. Allan Dwan sends the material along at a romping stride all the way, effectively emphasizing the mockery moments. Fran- chot Tone dons cowboy regalia like a ris- ing star of the sagebrush lands, breezing through his assignment with persuasion and considerable finesse. Whether en meshed in romantic doings or purely muscular activity he maintains satisfactory poise. Peggy Moran, who plays the very decided prairie deb, acts natural and of course can’t help looking pretty. Broder- ick Crawford as Swanee, the good-natured but heavy-fisted aide to Tone, contributes solid, hard-driving support, while Mischa Auer as a chameleon-like clown handles some funny comedy characterizations. Warren William as Dawson provides con- ventional menace and Andy Devine as a clumsy bunkhouse cowboy is properly suppressed. It’s a superior blend of horse-play and horse-opera which no sterling western fan can afford to miss. Franchot Tone “TRAIL OF THE VIGILANTES” MURDER OVER NEW YORK: Produced by Sol M.

Bombing plane saboteurs murder a British Intelligence officer and several other luckless individuals but there is no escaping the Chinese mastermind. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 65 minutes) Charlie Chan arrives in New York merely to attend a police convention, but a police convention won’t make a picture so before you can say “Sidney Toler” ten times backward Hugh Drake, the English intelligence official, lies dead of gas poisoning on the floor of a friend’s apartment and the chase begins. George Kirby, an airplane manufacturer, gets needled next and there’s a third murder before the redoubtable Oriental investi- gator nails the number one menace high up in a bombing plane which carries all the suspects over the city in a test flight. Meshed in the reels involving bombing plane blowups by foreign agents are the usual befuddled police efforts and the comic efforts of Chan’s son Jimmy, por- trayed by Sen Yung. High in the support brackets are Marjorie Weaver, Robert Lowery, Ricardo Cortez, Melville Cooper and John Sutton. Miss Weaver provides agreeable decoration and the others handle standard roles trimmed to fit the material. Sidney Toler displays stoic suavity in the face of nasty proceedings, proving once again that a cool head and a calm hand can cope with just about anything, even including scriptwriter saboteurs. The story is exciting enough to overcome its improbabilities — which may not be noticed anyway until the lights go on. Novelty comedy musical featuring mid- western radio personalities. A group ot talented youngsters put on a barnyard show which nets enough money to pay off a debt which endangers their 4-H program. The picture is tailored especi- ally for rural audiences. (Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 68 minutes) Offering a novelty revue including various airwave personalities popular in the midwest, this rural program filler should prove at least mildly diverting in urban areas. Harry ‘Pappy’ Cheshire acts as the kindly manager of an orphanage Borrowing $5,000 of orphanage funds in order to establish a 4-H setup for the youngsters, ‘Pappy’ finds himself involved with two hard-shelled politicians who put on the pressure and try to take over the home. ‘Pappy’ then inherits a non-profit night club whose performers gather at the orphanage.

The release leans heavily on hillbilly hokum, but the musical moments and madcap cast cut-ups will please audiences for which they were concocted. Precoci- ous little Mary Lee handles her meatiest role to date with aplomb, sings songs in smooth style, the best being \"Big Boy Blue.” Other cast members: Rufe Davis, The Kidoodlers, Ralph Bowman, June Storey, Mrs. Uppington, etc., carry on in the correct vein.

(Adults 8C Young People) (Running time, 82 minutes) Jim Moore, learning that Steve Harper's love affair with Cynthia seems to be laps- ing, sells his friend a million dollar love insurance policy to be paid if the mar- riage doesn’t come off. Roscoe, a tough night club owner, agrees to assume half the insurance risk, sends two of his stooges, Abbott and Costello to the Carib- bean to watch over the lovers. Jim how- ever, who also goes along, falls in love with Cynthia himself. Steve, meanwhile, meets Mickey, a former girl friend, and at length marries her in San Marcos. With the insurance voided, Jim and Cynthia fall into each other’s arms and every- body’s contented. The story, fortunately, is incidental to songs and comedy antics. Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, the Kate Smith hour com- edians, liven things up considerably with some neatly staged vaudeville nonsense routines, while Jerome Kern's five songs fit tunefully enough into the proceedings. Robert Cummings as Steve leads a cast including Allan Jones as Jim, Nancy Kelly as Cynthia and Peggy Moran as Mickey. Singing honors are shared by the latter three. It’s a somewhat loosely assembled production, but fans who relish light- laugh films should be appeased. Caricature comedy serving as a frame- work for W. C. Fields’ broad brand of humor. The hero becomes a bank guard after accidentally catching a bandit and thereafter undertakes an embezzling scheme resulting in hilarious complica- tions. (Adults) (Running time, 69 minutes) In The Bank Dick W. C. Fields falls back on the farce formula which has served him so well in the past. Guided by Eddie Cline, a veteran of the Keystone Kop era, Fields clowns and gags his way through a series of comic routines which still draw a good number of laughs. The story is a ragged but incidental affair link- ing together the various improvised amusement situations. Fields, Egbert Souse (pronounced Soo-zay) the towns most notorious tippler, becomes a bank police- man when he is credited with the appre- hension of an escaping robber. After per- suading the bank clerk engaged to his daughter to swipe enough money to pur- chase oil stocks, he finds himself on a spot when the bank examiner shows up without warning. Stalling off the gentle- man, Egbert again becomes involved in a bank robbery. This time he accompanies the crook on a wild ride which ends in his being honored the second time as a crook catcher.
