His diligence, commitment and enthu¬ siasm went far beyond the call of duty. I would also like to thank all the staff of the British Film Institute’s Information Library, whose unfailingly courteous assistance and response to the oddest (and sometimes silliest) queries helped me track down some of the historical curiosities included herein. They made my weeks at the Library far more pleasant than they might have been. Amongst the many people who helped in various ways are Anne Yelland, whose affability made the irksome bits and pieces of book production far less so; Roma Gibson, who knew where things were; Denis Gifford, who not only knew the name of the last on the left in the posse but could spell it as well; Michael Haggiag, who cracked the whip, as all publishers should; Carole James, who likes Westerns even less now but whose support was invaluable; David Meeker, who knew more than Variety about Herb Jeffries; and Paul Taylor, who reminded me of titles I might otherwise have missed. I would also like to thank Ed Buscombe, Allen Eyles, Chris Frayling (twice), Colin McArthur, Tom Milne, Ted Reinhart, Richard Schickel, David Thomson and Robin Wood for their Top Tens and Gerald Peary, Dave Pirie and Variety for kindly allowing me to reprint material originally compiled by them.\n\nVb\\wi\n\nCOU.&GE USSARY,\n\nThis edition published 1985 by Octopus Books 59 Grosvenor Street London W1X9DA\n\nf'AX HALiP DA7£\n\nISBN 0 7064 2555 5\n\nOCjTiX*. 1 * U-isoSi\n\nCLASS\n\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card Number: 83-62127\n\nA/So. .\n\n. -4\n\n\\\n\nmn 10\n\n°;\n\nJ o\n\nu ai\n\nPrinted in Shen Zhen, China. 123456789\n\n7VH1TIB\n\nV/-.U\n\n^\n\nho. 1\n\n»xl.;\n\nContents Preface\n\nvii\n\nThe Western in Perspective\n\nix\n\nThe Thirties:\n\n16\n\nThe Rise and Rise of the B Western\n\nThe Forties: The Fifties:\n\nThe Resurgence of the Genre Indians and Psychopaths\n\nThe Sixties:\n\nA Genre Redefined\n\nThe Western Goes International\n\nThe Seventies: The Eighties:\n\n-\n\nThe Western in Transition The Western Is Dead - Long Live the Western!\n\n102 186\n\n272 320 356\n\nAll-Time Western Rental Champs\n\n364\n\nMost Successful Westerns: Inflation Adjusted\n\n365\n\nBiggest Money-Making Western Stars\n\n366\n\nCritics’ Top Tens\n\n367\n\nWestern Oscars\n\n370\n\nSelected Sound Westerns and Their Novel Sources\n\n372\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\n374\n\nAll Other Sound Westerns\n\n375\n\nIndex\n\n396 i\n\n.--V • ..\n\n.\n\n■\n\n' \\\n\n\"\n\nNotes on the Entries\n\nAbbreviations and Explanation of Terms\n\nEntries are arranged chronologically throughout the volume and alphabetically within each year. The definite and inde¬ finite articles in both English and foreign titles have been disregarded in establishing alphabetical order. The index gives the year under which all film titles having entries are to be found. Films that do not have an entry may be found, with brief credits, in Appendix 8. The titles of all films which have their own entries are printed in bold throughout the book (except for a second reference to such a film in the same entry), with their date for ease of cross-referencing. All other films mentioned are printed in italics. The running time of a film can vary considerably because different versions are often released in different territories. Accordingly, where such versions are known to be in circulation, the different lengths are fisted in brackets after the original running time. All such lengths relate to theatrical screenings; on television, because of the medium’s faster projection speed, a film will generally run (excluding com¬ mercial breaks), approximately four minutes per hundred shorter. Only films over 50 minutes in length are included. Unless otherwise indicated all films are in colour and made in the United States of America. For the purposes of this book the date of a film has been taken as the year of its release rather than its making. In the case of some films even this is open to debate, and many of the sources are inconsistent if not actively in dispute. In such cases I have opted for the date most often ascribed. Where the date is in doubt, you are advised to consult the index to find the year under which the title has been entered. Similarly, often films are given different titles for different markets. Accordingly, if a film seems to be missing, you are advised to consult the index to find out which title has been used here. Although the credits have been exhaustively researched, inevitably some are missing. Most of these are producers’ credits from the years prior to 1933. Before that date studio producers were not credited as such on individual films; in that year David O. Selznick joined mgm and his contract stipulated that he receive an on-screen credit for his produc¬ tions. His first film to feature this was Night Flight (1933). All the other producers promptly followed suit.\n\naka orig Studios aa col fox mgm mon par prc rep rko u UA wb b/w sepia scope\n\nalso known as; used where a film has more than one title original; used where the English language title is not the original one Allied Artists Columbia Fox and (after 1935) Twentieth Century Fox Metro Goldwyn Mayer Monogram Paramount Producer’s Releasing Corporation Republic RKO Radio Universal United Artists Warner Brothers and (between 1967 and 1969) Warner Brothers-Seven Arts\n\npv w\n\nblack and white Sepiatone all wide-screen anamorphic systems Cinemascope and Warnerscope except: Panavision Vistavision\n\nCredits d p s c lp co-\n\ndirector producer screenwriter cinematographer leading players in collaboration\n\nsuch\n\nas\n\nPreface '■'x\n\nAt the time of writing, the Western stands in a peculiar position. Fewer and fewer are being made than at any point in the genre’s history, and yet in the American video market B Westerns are the second most popular item. Hollywood’s standard explanation of the genre’s sudden dip in popularity is that people are bored with cowboys, but in recent years there has been a remarkable upsurge of writing devoted to the genre. The aim of this book is to document the Western’s splendours, both consequential and inconsequential, and serve as a guide to the rugged terrain that is the Western. What distinguishes this volume from others is its scope, which is truly encyclopedic, and its structure. The heart of the book is some 1,800 entries, arranged chronologically and alphabetically within each year, which are devoted to indi¬ vidual films. These entries range from fifty words to a thousand in a direct reflection of the film’s interest and/or importance in the history of the Western. Each entry comprises fully researched credits (director, producer, writer, cinematographer and where possible a minimum of six leading players), a brief synopsis of the plot and informed critical comment on the film. Where relevant, cross reference is made to other movies. Thus it is possible to follow the career of important stars, directors and producers through the entries. A good example of this, and of how close knit a world the Western is, is the career of Harry Joe Brown, the director of numerous Ken Maynard B Westerns. After a stint as producer with Warners, he entered into independent produc¬ tion with Randolph Scott, in which capacity he hired Budd Boetticher to direct what turned out to be a classic series of B Westerns that culminated in Comanche Station (1960). There are no silent films among the entries for two reasons. Because the Western was the most prolific genre in the history of Hollywood, space is at a premium. Moreover, at present, and for the foreseeable future, only a few silent Westerns are available for viewing and even less are commercially available. Accordingly, in a book intended as a viewing guide, it makes little sense to include them, especially when there are so many sound Westerns, films that will turn up on television, video and in the rental market, pressing for inclusion. In addition to the entries the encyclopedia also contains numerous appendices. Of these the most important is Appendix 8 which fists, with brief credits, all the Westerns not given their own entry in the book, up to the end of 1982. Other appendices include a Critics’ Top Ten, a ranking of Westerns by their rental earnings and a fist of Oscars won by Westerns. Taken together, the appendices represent the most comprehensive statistical overview of the genre ever published. Precisely because this is an encyclopedia of the Western rather than a personal view of the genre, I have cast my net wide when considering whether to include or exclude a title in the entries. My concern has not been ‘Is it a Western in the strictest of senses?’ but ‘Has it developed from or does it contribute to the Western tradition in the broadest sense?’. Thus, I have included several Civil War films (but not Gone With the Wind, 1939); several films set in Colonial times and contemporary Westerns ranging from Junior Bonner (1972) and Coogan’s Bluff (1968) to Lonesome Cowboys (1968) (but not Godard’s Le Vent d’Est (1969) which, its title notwithstanding, owes little to the genre); and films about Western film-making such as Hearts of the West (1975). I have not included those films loosely called ‘Indian’, ‘Japanese’ or ‘Brazilian’ Westerns because, although they have adapted many of the conventions and traditions of the Western to local situations, those situations are so markedly different from the mainstream of the Western.\n\nviii\n\nI have, of course, included Westerns made outside Amer¬ ica. Thus, of all the entries, there are about a hundred devoted to the Italian Western. In my survey of this fascinating and controversial sub-genre I have relied heavily on Christopher Frayfing’s invaluable history of the phe¬ nomenon, The Spaghetti Western. Moreover, I have not restricted myself to Italian Westerns. Amongst the entries can be found German Westerns (of the thirties as well as of the sixties), a couple of British Westerns and even a Russian Western. Similarly I have included representative examples of that seventies’ phenomenon, the sex Western, and the numerous cross-genre films like Westworld (1973) and Billy the Kid vs. Dracula (1965), where the Western elements are essential. As part of the broad notion of the Western outlined above I have sought to include a substantial number of B Westerns. Too many accounts of the genre have restricted themselves to very narrow notions of the Western that have the films of John Ford at the centre and just at the edges admit the existence of, for example, Audie Murphy’s fifties Westerns. Alternatively writers have treated the world of the B Western, a world where the likes of Roy Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy are megastars, in splendid isolation. This view is understandable, since the two ‘Westerns’ influenced each other little, but when it comes to the actual films, despite their different perspec¬ tives (and budgets), both A and B Westerns clearly share so many characteristics that it is ridiculous to segregate the two. Accordingly, in this book at least, George O’Brien, the Three Mesquiteers and Smith Ballew ride the range in the company of John Wayne, Randolph Scott and James Stewart. Simi¬ larly, I have included a number of Western serials in the main body of the book. My concern when selecting serials or B Westerns has been to include not only the best, but also a judicious mix of those that are representative of their stars, those whose production circumstances are significant, those which are historically important and those which are accessible for viewing. If A and B Westerns can sit side by side easily enough, however, to judge the series Westerns by the standards of the big budgeted A Westerns makes a nonsense of their inclusion. The production values of the Bs, their plots, direction and, usually, acting are, with few exceptions, vastly inferior to those evident in A Westerns. Moreover, to judge the Bs by the standards of the A Westerns would be to blind oneself to the charm, innocence and simplicity of the series Western at its best, in short to those qualities that have kept its memory alive for so long. Accordingly, my comments on the B Westerns are written from a different perspective and are relative, rather than directly comparable, to those apprecia¬ tions of A Westerns. For my comments on the B Westerns included I have relied on extensive research in which I have been greatly aided by the maps of the sub-genre provided by Don Miller (in his intelligent and reliable study, Hollywood Corral), Jon Tuska (in his mammoth piece of research, The Filming of the West) and the anonymous reviewers of Variety and the Motion Picture Herald, of whom it must be said that though they rarely liked B Westerns they were quick to detect the minutest differences between them. With these as my guides I have sought to select the most interesting of the Bs, and so give a picture of the genre from both top and bottom. The result, I hope, is the most comprehensive guide in book form to the Western so far ever produced. Happy Trails! Phil Hardy London 1983\n\nThe Western in Perspective\n\nJohn Ford on location during the filming of\n\nStagecoach.\n\nWhat’s in a Name?\n\nShane: a fairy tale of a Western.\n\nAt a famous meeting, to identify himself as he rose to speak, one director said succinctly ‘I’m John Ford, I make West¬ erns.’ The deprecating nature of the remark is typical of Ford’s easy confidence. Indeed the anecdote has become one of those most often told about him. Until recently, it has been a self-sufficient story; now there is a need to explain it. No director these days could, or would wish to, similarly identify himself. Quite simply, so few Westerns have been made recently that it is hard to talk of the genre except in the past tense. Similarly the days when so many stars were almost completely identified with the genre are long gone. W.S. Hart, John Wayne, Buck Jones, Tom Mix and Randolph Scott could also say, with John Ford, ‘I make Westerns’. And it wasn’t only stars who were identified with the genre: character actor Joseph Crehan donned whiskers and took up a cigar as part of his portrayal of President Ulysses Grant some fifty times in various Westerns, while Gabby Hayes was as much of a fixture in Westerns as the stars he supported. If historical figures such as President Grant and other more romantic types like Buffalo Bill, Geronimo and Jesse James seemed perpetually to be playing second lead to Wayne, Mix and company as they criss-crossed the most recognizable landscape in cinema, the strong moral dimension to that landscape was at least as important as the stars. Perspectives may have changed as the Western evolved, but from the earliest days of the silent cinema to the present the idea of moral regeneration has remained one of the key elements in a story that has been told and retold countless times throughout the history of the genre. Figures as diverse as W.S. Hart, Harry Carey, John Wayne, Gary Cooper and Randolph Scott have been saved from themselves either by the love of a good woman or by a sense of mission. In so many of the Westerns’ most famous scenes this moral dimension is an integral element of the drama: W.S. Hart setting fire to the town in Hell’s Hinges (1916), Wayne gunning down the evil Plummer brothers in Stagecoach (1939) and William Holden leading the remainder of his gang to their deaths in The Wild Bunch (1969). So strong is the contrast between the genre’s triumphant past and the doldrums it currently finds itself in that one is inevitably led to the most obvious question: ‘What is the Western?’ It is not a new question. At every stage in the genre’s evolution, it has been raised. In its crudest form it is\n\nseen in the bizarre debates about whether films like Lonely Are the Brave (1962) and Hud (1963) are Westerns or not, or whether there can be such a thing as the Italian Western. Though the Italian Western is now accepted as a significant part of the genre in the sixties and seventies, and Sergio Leone is thought by many to be one of the more interesting and influential makers of Westerns, when the sub-genre made its first appearance on the international market, the films, their success at the box office notwithstanding, were greeted with derision by most critics. Whatever the Western was, it was clearly assumed to be something that only Americans could make. This and other hidden assumptions about the genre need to be uncovered, if only to isolate the genre from the values ascribed to it. From this perspective it is worth having a look at a couple of attempted definitions of the Western. In his classical essay ‘The Westerner’, Robert Warshow offers a thumbnail sketch of the Western and attempts to explain its enduring appeal. Warshow sees this as stemming primarily from the man with the gun at the centre of the genre. He is a man unconcerned with the realities of modern fife and its constraints, a man who can act direcdy, if reluctantly, in support of values he believes in. Moreover, he acts with style. For Warshow, writing in 1954: Above all, the movies in which the Westerner plays out his role preserve for us the pleasure of a complete and self-contained drama - and one which still effordessly crosses the boundaries which divide our culture - in a time when other, more consciously serious art forms are increasingly complex, uncertain and ill-defined. In short, at a time when frustratingly complex issues like the Bomb, the Cold War, the House Un-American Activities Commitee and Suez were being raised, the Western remained a simple, unchanging, clearcut world in which notions of Good and Evil could be balanced against each other in an easily recognizable fashion. Moreover, Good not only invari¬ ably triumphed but did so with style and grace. Warshow is concerned to distil the essence of the Western, to define the genre in terms of its essential elements. This becomes all the more obvious when he turns to the contemporary Western which he sees as confused either by a concern for ‘social drama’ or by attempts to aestheticize the genre. Warshow sees both these strands of the fifties Western as violating the ‘Western form’ and threatening the innocence of the genre. Thus, neither High Noon (1952) nor Shane (1953) are ‘right’.\n\nix\n\nThe first is a piece of ‘vulgar anti-populism’ which ‘does not exist in the proper frame of the Western movie’, while Shane is an attempt ‘to freeze the Western myth once and for all’ and accordingly the result is a film that is more ‘fairy tale’ than Western. With the benefit of almost thirty years of hindsight, it is easy to counter some of Warshow’s absolutist descriptions of the genre. To take just one example: ‘The Westerner is par excellence a man of leisure. Even when he wears the badge of a marshal or, more rarely, owns a ranch, he appears to be unemployed’ writes Warshow. Yet from Will Penny (1967) onwards there has been a new emphasis on work in the Western. The drudgery that is the life of the cowboy has been detailed in several films, like Monte Walsh (1970), as part of the process of de-romanticizing the cowboy. More important¬ ly, Warshow’s aims in writing his essay are clearer now. At a time when violence and complexity were intruding into the genre because the Western was reflecting its times more closely, Warshow was attempting to defend the Western’s innocence, to save it from defilement. In this he was not alone. In his influential essay, ‘The Evolution of the Western’, French film critic Andre Bazin takes a similar position. Calling Shane and High Noon ‘Super-Westerns’, Bazin compares them unfavourably to earlier Westerns for being self-conscious. Like Warshow, but even more explicitly, Bazin argues the merits of the Westerns of the forties, which he sees as the time of the classic Western. Bazin accepts developments in the genre - he warmly welcomes the first Westerns of Anthony Mann as building upon the tradition of Stagecoach (1939). But, in effect, what he and Warshow attempt is to define the genre, to pick out its essence, in such a way that their preferred films are the classics of the genre because they best exemplify the Western as defined by their criteria. George N. Fenin and William K. Everson in their book The Western, From Silents to Seventies proceed by a similarly self-referential route. Despite their chosen title, the authors clearly prefer the silent films of W.S. Hart above all others. Accordingly they develop ‘realism’ as the essential element of the genre, construct a ‘realist tradition’ which has Hart’s films at its source and then value individual films by how closely they conform to that tradition. ‘What is a Western?’ is clearly a far more complex question than a simple matter of name. Similarly an ‘essentialist’ answer won’t do, especially when the essence defined is either a defence of, or an attack on, the Western in a particular phase of its evolution.\n\nAmerica and History A more useful starting point for a discussion of the Western and a probing of its identity or identities is American history. After all, the Western is fixed in time in a relatively straightforward way. Indeed Hollywood and the Western are part of the history of the West. When the genre first made its appearance on celluloid at the turn of the century, it might just as well have been called ‘the Eastern’. Films like Kit Carson (1903) and Edwin S. Porter’s far more famous The Great Train Robbery (1903) (which was neither the first Western nor the first narrative film, the legend surrounding it notwithstanding) were made in New Jersey. However, within ten years film production had gravitated to the West coast. The reasons for this were complex but high on the fist was the Californian climate, which was first demonstrated in a series of two-reel Westerns made by Bronco Billy Anderson (who had a small part in The Great Train Robbery) for Colonel Selig. The frontier had been declared closed and there was no more open range to settle but when the film-makers made their pioneer-like trek to California they found that the West was still alive, if only just. For the numerous cowboys who were being thrown off the range as the big ranches closed x\n\ndown, Hollywood, which quickly established itself as the movie capital, appeared just in time. Few of the cowboys who flocked there in search of work ever became stars but many of them found regular work and a few became well established as character actors. Several of the rodeo riders eventually did become stars, usually after working for a period as stuntmen. Notable examples were Tom Mix, Yakima Canutt and, much much later, Ben Johnson. In an interview late in his life, Colonel Tim McCoy, who was born in 1891 in Saginaw, Michigan, spoke about this strange twilight period of the West: At the turn of the century, children could still dream. There were those who watched the fire wagons and wanted to be firemen and those who wanted to be policemen ... I didn’t want to be a fireman, nor a policeman ... I wanted to be a cowboy. And so, in 1907, after a week spent watching a Wild West show, McCoy quit college and headed for the West to become a cowboy. Thus, when Hollywood was founded it quickly became both the last real employer of cowboys and the inspiration of a new generation of kids who, unlike McCoy, couldn’t become cowboys themselves. Not surprisingly, since Westerns were to all intents and purposes contemporary films, silent Westerns made in Hollywood showed a great advance in realism over their Eastern counterparts. However, despite the presence in Hollywood of the likes of Wyatt Earp and Emmett Dalton as technical advisors, the scripts and acting styles remained firmly within the Wild West show and dime novel traditions. A thoroughgoing realism was occasionally attempted, as in The Bank Robbery (1908), but such films invariably fared badly at the box office. Nonetheless, The Bank Robbery remains a fascinating movie. It was made by the Oklahoma Mutoscene Company which was set up by BUI Tilghman and A1 Jennings. Jennings was one of the last train robbers of note and TUghman was the law officer who caught him! Their film which, it must be said, was crudely made, told the story of one of Jennings’ attempted bank robberies and was shot on the actual Oklahoma locations. Jennings would soon follow Earp and others to Hollywood where, like them, he would help write the legend at the expense of reahty. But The Bank Robbery, made before HoUywood had begun to streamline the Western, remains as a reminder of how close to reality the Western in fact was historicaUy and how close it could attempt to get dramaticaUy. The film represents a strand of filmmaking that would not re-enter the Western until the seventies. IronicaUy, at the time, what was seen as missing from The Bank Robbery was a sense of the West that actors Uke the athletic Tom Mix and W.S. Hart would exploit so melodramaticaUy in their films. Bronco Billy Anderson (second from right), the first Western star.\n\nMy Darling Clementine, John Ford’s poetic celebration of the coming of civilization to the old West.\n\nstone. Henry Fonda’s Wyatt Earp is civilization’s agent, the man who forgoes vengeance to become the representative of law and order. Similarly, the dance at the half-completed church, the scent Fonda wears to court Cathy Downs and Alan Mowbray’s drunken Shakespearian actor all represent aspects of Tombstone’s transition from a place of frontier savagery to an outpost of civilization. Wellman’s film offers a sharp contrast to Ford’s positive, not to say poetic, celebra¬ tion of the civilizing of the West. Wellman and writer Lamar Trotti’s frontier is one where fear and ignorance rule and where justice is trampled on in the search for a quick and easy solution to the problem posed by the three wandering cowboys who might have killed a local rancher. Even more damning is Wellman’s indictment of the institutional repre¬ sentative, the Colonel, who is seen to act petulantly rather than with due consideration. The fact that Henry Fonda is the hero of both films makes the contrast between them all the more visible. This is not to say that Westerns are to be valued purely in terms of their historical accuracy, but simply that the frontier, and, more particularly, the frontier between the Civil War and the turn of the century, forms the backdrop to most Westerns. The word ‘most’ is important. Films set in the Colonial period, like Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and Northwest Passage (1940), and films set after 1900, like Lonely Are the Brave (1962) and Westworld (1973), clearly share enough important features of the genre and in some sense present themselves as Westerns to a degree that they can be usefully included in a broad notion of the genre. For though the period between 1860 and 1900, the years of America’s headlong Westward expansion to the Pacific, provides the raw material of the Western, an equally important element is the idea of the frontier, of the West. It is to this idea that the above films direct themselves in various ways. This concept of the West is seen at its purest in films like The Covered Wagon (1923), the first epic Western, The Iron Horse (1924), Dodge City (1939), My Darling Clementine (1946), Bend of the River (1952) and The Searchers (1956), films which, in different ways, are explicit¬ ly about the idea of the West and the elements that go to make it up, like pioneering, making fertile what was desert, bringing law and order where there was only chaos, etc. The West, or at least the ‘big themes’ of the West are not necessarily present in all Westerns, but it is noticeable that even those series Westerns that are purely action-oriented were as often as not promoted by association with the idea of the West. To pick a few examples at random from Alan Barbour’s compilation of ads for series Westerns, Movie Ads of the Past: Johnny Mack Brown’s actioneer, The Law Comes to Gunsight (1939) was advertised as taking place ‘When Justice fought for its life on the ramparts of a bold and pioneering Nation!’, and a Western which advertised its contents as ‘A Beautiful Girl ... A Murdered Brother . . . Stolen Gold’ was entitled Winning the West (1931). Equally direct is the poster for Ken Maynard’s Come On Tarzan (1932): ‘A drama of men who ride with their stirrups long and their holsters handy . . . who deal across the top of the table . . . and shoot from the hip!’ These posters and many like them invoke the idea of the West, associating the films they promote not merely with the years between 1860 and 1900 but, to borrow one of the copywriters’ favourite phrases, with times ‘when men were men. . .’. However, this view of the West is only one of many. Just as the frontier can be celebrated as the place where men wore six-guns and were free to use them, so it can be described as a place where lynch law took the place of justice, food was scarce and culture non-existent. These different Wests have each made their mark on the Western, as a brief comparison between John Ford’s My Darling Clementine and William Wellman’s The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) makes clear. Ford’s film deals with the moment when civilization reaches Tomb¬\n\nHorse, an innocent celebration of the winning of the West, to Cheyenne Autumn (1964), a bitter account of the bravery of the Cheyenne and their maltreatment by Ford’s beloved Cavalry, reveals a dramatic shift in perspective. From the fifties onwards, Ford’s Westerns increasingly question what he once celebrated, treating the arrival of civilization and law and order at the frontier in terms of the cost rather than of the achievement. The key films here are The Searchers and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). Ford has explained the darkening mood of his films cryptically with the off-the-cuff remark, ‘Maybe I’m growing old’. It should be emphasized however that Ford’s change of attitude, though expressed in a uniquely Fordian way, is representative of, rather than at odds with, the general shift in the Western since the fifties. This kind of reinterpretation of the West is significantly different from the changes in fashion that have periodically swept over the series Western although some of these changes have been direct if superficial responses to events outside the genre. In the early thirties when the crime melodrama and men with machines carried all before them, writers of Westerns quickly began writing city gangsters and machine guns into scripts which, otherwise, were entirely convention¬ al. A common theme of these ‘gangsters on the range’ Westerns is the superiority of the Old West over the New East. Even more startling were the Nazi and Japanese sympathizers who took to the range in the early forties and had to be hunted down by Hollywood’s series cowboy stars after America’s entry into the Second World War. Rather more interesting are the black Westerns that surfaced briefly in the thirties and again in the seventies. The first was Harlem on the Prairie (1937). Were it not for its all black cast the film would be just another independent quickie. The project was seen purely in novelty terms by producer Jed Buell, writer Fred Myton and director Sam Newfield, all veterans of series Westerns (like Terror of Tiny Town, 1938, which was made by the same team with a cast of midgets), but the success of Harlem on the Prairie with the black audiences, confirmed by the flurry of all-black Westerns that followed, marked the resurgence of the ghetto market. Black gangster films and musicals followed but, surprisingly, the Westerns were the most popular all-black features. Particular¬ ly interesting was the ‘colour design’ of most of the films. The hero, almost invariably played by Herb Jeffries, was light skinned, as was the heroine, while the comic support and villain were played by darker skinned actors in a literal version of the ‘white hat for the hero, black hat for the villain’ convention that still permeated the genre, at series level at any rate. Similarly the films aped the most successful form of series Western until then, the musical Western, while Jeffries, true to the tradition of series cowboy stars, took to ornamenting his car with bronzed horns and such like. The spate of the xi\n\nblack-exploitation Westerns of the seventies was very diffe¬ rent from that of the thirties in two important respects. Whereas the Westerns of the thirties were the product of the ghetto mentality, the black-exploitation films of the seventies were marketed to black and white alike and, ironically, are far surer of their blackness than the majority of their thirties counterparts. What is notable about the Western since the fifties is that writers and directors have treated contemporary issues in Western form as a means of securing sufficient finance for their projects. The classic examples of this are the highly influential Broken Arrow (1950) and High Noon (1952). Both of these, and the numerous films that followed in the wake of each, are important because they introduced into the Western the sympathetic treatment of Indians and adult themes like civic responsibility. However, they didn’t do this in a vacuum; they were examples of the ‘liberal backlash’ of the fifties, displaced into the Western in the same way that, in the seventies, the new Indian films like Soldier Blue (1970) were a displaced reaction to the Vietnam War. Another indication of the Western’s continual reinterpreta¬ tion of the legend of the West is reflected in the way that the mythical last days of the frontier have been slowly pushed from around 1890 in the sixties to, by now, the years immediately prior to the outbreak of the First World War. Thus the classic example of mourning the dying frontier Western, The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970), sees the man with the gun dying beneath the wheels of a motor car. This echoes the rather more mundane death of the Western’s first ‘last cowboy’, Kirk Douglas, at the end of Lonely Are the Brave in which he is run over by a truck carrying a load of toilet pans, on the verge of reaching the border and freedom, like Jason Robards in the Peckinpah film. Treading delicately through the maze of conflicting Wests, the place where men were men (or rather ‘six foot two of Western rawhide’), the changing West of John Ford, the highly self-conscious West of the seventies, let alone the highly individual West of Sergio Leone and company, what should be clear is how flexible a genre the Western is. From this perspective it is not surprising that essentialist defini¬ tions, however illuminating they may be at the time, should fall by the wayside as the Western evolves.\n\nHeroes and Villains The raw material of the West is not merely America’s westward expansion of the second half of the nineteenth century and the details of frontier life. A central element has always been the heroes and villains of the West, legendary characters from James Fenimore Cooper’s Leatherstocking to Daniel Boone and from Deadwood Dick to Buffalo Bill, characters who from their beginnings were as much creatures of fiction as they were historical figures and vice versa. Cooper’s Leatherstocking, the scout and first pioneer who led America into the forests and across the plains to the West - in The Prairie, Cooper describes him as having seen the Pacific was a figure of myth. Cooper viewed his fictional hero with deep ambiguity. Henry Nash Smith in Virgin Land, his classic account of the West as myth, describes the first biographers of Daniel Boone as wrestling with the same problem as Cooper: ‘which was the real Boone, the standard bearer of civilization and refinement or the child of nature who fled into the wilderness before the advance of the settlements?’ Propheti¬ cally he concludes, ‘the image of the Wild West Hero could serve either purpose.’ This is even more so in the case of the heroes who followed Leatherstocking and Boone. They weren’t pioneers; the next significant Western heroes were the men with the guns Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, Jesse James and company. These people were relatively unimportant in the overall history of the westward movement xu\n\nand, accordingly, the literature that quickly surrounded them contained, for the most part, little reference to notions of the West or the pioneering spirit. Indeed by the 1890s the locale of the dime novel, in whose pages these heroes rode into legend, became largely insignificant; what mattered was the hero and the wholesale slaughter he was called upon to perform. The shift from the ambiguity with which Boone was viewed was significant. The frontier of the dime novel, even that of its most genteel practitioners, was blood red as heroes faced nature in the raw and the primitive savagery of the Red Man. The legends soon took on lives of their own outside the dime novels: Deadwood Dick and his companions survived the death of the literature that gave them fife. Moreover, because the Western hero was located in a particular time and place that was close enough to be accurately reported and far enough away to be shamelessly romanticized, a degree of self-consciousness entered the process and became part of the legend. Thus, in his own lifetime, Jesse James was treated both as a legend and as a real historical figure. The most important of these legendary figures was William F. Cody, alias Buffalo Bill, the man Ned Buntline discovered in 1869 when he rode West in search of someone he could turn into a dime novel hero. Cody returned East with Buntline for publicity purposes and ended up playing himself on the stage. From then on, his career was consciously to make a spectacle of the Wild West, first on stage and then in the circus ring, while in print he ‘chronicled’ - ie had written for him - his life. Cody became Buffalo Bill to a degree that he and his role merged completely, as dime novel fiction and reality became inseparable. At times his letters suggest that his new role wore heavily upon him. Hence he wrote to his publisher, ‘I am sorry to have to lie so outrageously in this yarn - if you think the revolver and the Bowie knife are used too freely, you may cut out a fatal shot or stab wherever you deem it wise.’ At the end of his fife he obviously felt trapped by his role: ‘I do not want to die a showman. I grow tired of this show hero worship sometimes.’ However, Cody continued with his role of the Wild West hero to the end of his life. As Cody was glamorizing the West and popularizing it in Europe through his circus tours, some European travellers to the West were busy pointing out that the true character of the cowboy was being lost behind the glamour: he was becoming a legend. The cowboy has at the present time become a personage; maybe he is rapidly becoming a mythical one. Distance is doing for him what the lapse of time did for the heroes of antiquity. His admirers are investing him with all manner of romantic qualities; they descant upon his manifold virtues and his pardonable weaknesses as if he were a demi-god, and I have no doubt that before long there will be ample material for any philosophic enquirer who may wish to enlighten the world as to the cause of the cowboy myth. The format of the Western, its conventions, stock charac¬ ters, the function of Indians, the dude etc, derive from the legends of the West, the dime novel and Wild West shows. Similarly much of the Western’s treatment of its heroes and villains can be traced back to the tensions between legend and reality that were implicit (and sometimes explicit) in the initial treatment of the heroes of the West. In short, the genre’s literary origins reinforce the Western’s flexibility by adding to its potential. Thus it is that Jesse James, and even more extraordinarily Billy the Kid, are both hero and villain. Indeed, in the case of Billy the Kid, it is the recurring theme of a long-running series starring Buster Crabbe as Billy and A1 St John as his comic side-kick: Billy fights on the side of law and order but is thought to be an outlaw by all and sundry. One way of writing a history of the Western would be to detail the changing views of its outlaw heroes. Butch Cassidy\n\nClockwise from top: Heroes and Villains: W. S. Han in The Gunfighter; a grinning outlaw from a Triangle silent; Roy Rogers clearing the name of Jesse James in Days of Jesse James; Bruce Cabot in the title role of Wild Bill Hickock Rides; the Daltons in Jesse James versus the Daltons; Henry Fonda in the title role in The Return of Frank James and Johnny Mack Brown as Billy the Kid.\n\n^ vi- i vx snnnKj 'fi Bft ... | MftMNBVHniflKbOTtaH -aTr*.\n\n-\n\n. vrsj&Tw!'; mw .\n\nmade his appearance in forties Westerns as a devil and was slowly rehabilitated until, as impersonated by Paul Newman, he became a charming version of the last cowboy. Similarly, Wyatt Earp has oscillated between being presented as representative of law and order (My Darling Clementine) and maddened killer (Hour of the Gun, 1967). It is noticeable that, in the fifties, both hero and villain became more complex figures, far closer to each other than they had ever been presented in previous decades. Thus, in Boetticher’s series of Westerns with Randolph Scott (which includes The Tall T (1957), Ride Lonesome (1959) and Comanche Station (I960)), the Scott figure actually inhabits the same moral landscape as his adversaries. Similarly, and more extremely, the hero of Anthony Mann’s series of Westerns with James Stewart, which includes Winchester ’73 (1950), Bend of the River (1952) and The Man from Laramie (1955), feature a hero who is a psychopath for much of the picture (or in the director’s own words, ‘a man who could kill his brother’). It is not coincidental that such heroes arrived at a time when the positive values that lay behind the forties Western were being challenged. However, the legacy of those heroes was more problematic for the genre. Once the man with the gun was given a psychological dimension and confronted with problems that couldn’t be solved by the speed of his draw, the simple appeal of the Western was thrown into doubt. Suddenly these were real men facing real issues, not creatures of make believe and fantasy like the Lone Ranger and company. In My Darling Clementine, his poeticizing not¬ xiv\n\nmsKW&m k\n\ni\n\nwithstanding, Ford was able to insert his story into the ‘Western form’ (to use Warshow’s phrase) without in any way deforming it. A few years later, the ending of Howard Hawks’ Red River (1948), which saw John Wayne and Montgomery Clift not shooting it out, was much criticized for not being true to the verities of the genre. From the fifties onwards, more and more Westerns followed the line of Red River and in various ways deformed the genre, challenging its ossifying conventions. This evolution produced a richer form, but led to diminishing audiences, especially after the death of the B Western. From the sixties onwards, the Western has been a genre in search of heroes. Only very rarely have these heroes been like their uncomplicated brothers of earlier times. For the most part, they have been bemused observers of the pageant of the West (Dustin Hoffman in Little Big Man, 1970); self-personifications of the genre itself (John Wayne in The Shootist, 1976); men at the end of their tether (William Holden in The Wild Bunch, 1969) or unaware that their time is gone (Warren Beatty in McCabe and Mrs Miller, 1971). It is against this background that the upsurge of wilderness and pioneering films (like Jeremiah Johnson, 1972 and Heartland, 1979) with their celebration of the beauty and ferocity of nature are to be understood. They, at least, provide heroes and heroines; they may be uncomplicated and thendesires may be limited to a concern to survive but there is enough substance and variety already demonstrated in the sub-genre to make it clear that it is a far richer area than has been accepted as yet by most critics of the Western.\n\nClockwise: More Heroes and Villains: John Sturges’ Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and James Gamer in Hour of the Gun, Sturges’ second thought on the subject; Paul Newman and Robert Redford as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid; Paul Newman in the title role in Buffalo Bill and the Indians and Stacy and James Keach as Frank and Jesse James in The Long Riders.\n\nHollywood and the Western In Hollywood more Westerns have been made than any other kind of film. The economic importance of the Western to Hollywood in the thirties and forties cannot be overempha¬ sized. One says the Western yet in fact there were two Westerns whose histories, for the most part, ran parallel to each other: the A Western and the series Western. The series Western was so called because its stars were contracted to make not an individual film but a series of films, usually six or eight. The first such Western star was ‘Bronco Billy’ Anderson. From 1910 onwards all Anderson’s Essanay two-reelers featured him as Bronco Billy. Thus in one film the character might get married or be shot but at the start of the next he would once more be ready for action. The stories were discontinuous, the characters continuous. Anderson was also the first cowboy producer-star. By the end of the twenties, Western production in Hollywood had become very specialized. Stars like Tom Mix and Ken Maynard made their own films for distribution by the major studios, which in turn had their own Western units churning out films by the week. The arrival of sound did little to change this production set-up. Although at first the majors were reluctant to invest in expensive sound equipment for their Western units, the speed with which the independents moved into the Western series market forced the majors to respond swiftly. By 1932, Western film production was higher than it had been at the end of the silent era. It was soon to ride even higher when Hollywood tried to offset the effects of the Depression by introducing double bills in a desperate attempt to boost sagging box-office receipts. Thus it was that, in the early thirties, a single cinema theatre could easily get through some 300 pictures a year. As the number of majors turning to double bills in all but their most prestigious theatres grew, so did the need for product to fill the lower half of those double bills. Faced with the winning combination of cheap costs and a ready market, production of series Westerns rocketed. The classic example of this is Republic Studios. The studio was founded by Herbert J. Yates in 1935, as an act of desperation. Yates’ Consolidated Film Laboratories processed over half the released footage in America and his biggest customers were the independent film companies of Holly¬ wood’s Poverty Row. When they faltered and the possibility of them defaulting on their debts was raised, Yates brought about the merger of several of them. Within two years Republic, as the resulting company was called, was making more films, albeit nearly all second features, than any other Hollywood studio. Needless to say, the staple diet of Republic’s production fines was the series Western.\n\nHerbert J. Yates, the founder of Republic, the studio that hitched its star to the series Western.\n\nRepublic’s production values were high compared to those of the first independently produced sound series Westerns which were marked by inept cinematography and sound recording and speeded up action. Republic’s experienced crews brought to a fine art many of the stock convention shots of the series Western - the running insert, the general use of camera trucks to intensify chases and the like. The series Westerns, especially the films of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, were hugely profitable for the company, but despite Yates’ many attempts. Republic never became a major studio and never found its way out of Poverty Row. Indeed it didn’t long survive the death of the B Western and was sold in 1959. The studio’s fate was mirrored by that of virtually every series star. The gap between the series Western and the A Western seemed unbridgeable; John Wayne was the only exception. Moreover, apart from Wayne (who only became a big box-office star after he quit series Westerns) and (very briefly) Gene Autry, no other series cowboy ever became a big box-office star. Indeed, during the heyday of the series Western, Motion Picture Herald ran a separate annual box-office poll for cowboy stars, a mark of their economic importance and their difference from other Hollywood stars (see Appendix 3). Behind the scenes it was even more noticeable that once cinematographers, writers, producers and directors had accustomed themselves to the hectic pace of series production they invariably remained there. Amongst the few who escaped were Joseph H. Lewis and Gerd Oswald, who rose from the depths of second unit direction at Republic and Monogram respectively to the heights of the B Western in the fifties. But perhaps the most revealing demonstration of just how far apart were the series and A Western is the musical Western. This historical curiosity seemed to take over completely the series Western in the mid thirties, yet it hardly had any influence at all on the A Western. There were the occasional musical A Westerns, but none of the singing cowboy variety. Thus when Roy Rogers attempted the transition from series to film star in Raoul Walsh’s The Dark Command (1940), he left his guitar behind. Series Westerns did evolve. It is particularly noticeable that the role of women changed over the years, but in retrospect it is equally clear that such developments were marginal at best. Were it not for the fact that high production costs cut into profits after the Second World War and so hastened its decline, the signs are that the series Western might well have faded away on its own for lack of interest. Certainly it no longer catered for the interests of the fifties in the way that science fiction and horror films did. In a similar fashion the B Western soon followed its series cousin to the grave. Thus, in 1960, the Western’s position vis-ik-vis Hollywood was radically different from what it had been before the Second World War. A change of a similar magnitude occurred in the years between 1960 and the present day. From one perspective these changes have left the Western less a genre and more a collection of films that just happen to be set in a particular time and place, yet from another these films are united by the modernist stance most of them adopt. All they lack is the automatic audience of their forebears, a lack that Hollywood itself is also facing. The Western, then, has been dethroned; it is no longer the all-powerful genre that it was. Hollywood and audiences no longer seem interested in the last days of the frontier, which has resolutely remained the dominant theme of recent Westerns, even those set in the present day like Rancho Deluxe (1974). The Western’s potential growth areas, the pioneering and wilderness films, might not prove to be as adaptable and flexible as they seem at present. Certainly without them it is hard to envisage the Western surviving in its present form. But then the history of the genre is one of rising from the grave, to which it has all too frequently been consigned, with the most unlikely of films. xv\n\nWife\n\nNATIONAL\n\nbank\n\n1930 s first charge\n\nCiwt HOPPtf #Ui HiKDH 0*\n\nWINES\n\nThe Thirties Bride of the Desert b/w 57 min An independently-produced quickie that borrows much of its plot from In Old Arizona (1929).

(TREM CARR productions)\n\n'v.\n\nThe Rise and Rise of the B Western In the thirties all trails led to Republic, the studio that raised itself by its own bootstraps through a wholesale commitment to the B Western. Up to 1935 and the formation of Republic it was, however, a fairly rocky road. The decade opened decidedly inauspiciously for the West¬ ern. The last years of the silent cinema had brought a significant drop in the popularity of the Western, whose sexless and saintly characters were clearly out of step with the liberated twenties. The coming of sound only accelerated this decline in popularity. Moreover, the mechanical problems and the high costs associated with the bulky sound equipment made the major studios look with disfavour upon the genre. Two films changed this view - In Old Arizona, and the independently produced Overland Bound, both of which were made in 1929. The former introduced music and sexuality (if not sex) to the genre and sparked off a short-lived wave of prestige Westerns (which included Cimarron, 1931, the only Western to date to win the Oscar for Best Picture). Overland Bound inspired the revival of the B Western, first from independent producers quick to notice a gap in the output of the major studios and then from the majors themselves. Republic represented the culmination of these two strands in the development of the Western: the studio was formed to fill the lower half of the double bills that had become the norm in the course of the Depression, and its output is best represented by the image of the singing cowboy whose origins he in the South of the Border Westerns of which In Old Arizona was the first. However, although the Republic formula for Westerns - action and/or music, production fine scenarios and filming, and an efficient distribution system quickly made the studio a giant on Poverty Row (and allowed its owner, Herbert Yates, to make the occasional prestige picture), like so many of the stars the studio created, it never achieved the respectability that Yates so desperately desired; nor would it survive the death of the double bill in the mid-fifties. But in the thirties Republic reigned supreme, for the decade, more than any other, was the time of the B Western and its glorious inconsequentialities, of the Three Mesquiteers, Hopalong Cassidy and Gene Autry. Only in the forties was the Western to achieve respectability as major studios regularly committed big stars and budgets to the genre. Thus it was fitting that the thirties should end with the escape of John Wayne from the confines of the B Western, if not from Republic where he’d eventually taken refuge after the failure of his first Western of the decade, The Big Trail (1931). 18\n\nPrevious pages: The boom town of Osage from Cimarron, the only Western to win the Oscar for best picture.\n\nd Duke Worne p Trem Carr s Arthur Hoerl c Ernest Depew Ip Alice Calhoun, LeRoy Mason, Ethan Laidlaw, Lum Chan, Walter Ackerman, Horace Carpenter Courtin’ Wildcats b/w 58 min Gibson’s last outing in 1929 and, more significantly, his last part-talking film; henceforth his Westerns would be all-sound affairs.

Walsh had intended to star in as well as direct the film but he lost an eye in an accident. Baxter took over the role of the Cisco Kid and Cummings took a hand in the direction. One of the film’s most notable features is its use of outdoor sound: Walsh’s recordings of hoofbeats, gunshots and the sound of sizzling bacon helped persuade Hollywood that sound as well as speech could greatly aid the Western. The screenplay, though based on the O’Henry stories, owes much to Walsh’s own silent films about the exploits of the battling Sergeants Flag and Quirt impersonated by Victor McLaglen and Edmund Lowe. Baxter is a dashing Cisco Kid, Lowe a wily Texas Ranger and Burgess the girl whose betrayal of Baxter nearly costs him his fife. The film was also significant for introducing music to the Western: the theme song, ‘My Tonia’, was a big hit for Nic Lucas. This in turn inspired Ken Maynard to experiment with music in his Universal Western series.

Significantly, though the Virginian’s retort to the evil Trampas (here Huston), ‘When you call me that Smile’ has passed into folklore, Wister’s almost obsessive concern with capital punishment, seen in Cooper as the Virginian leading a search party for his friend (Arlen) even though he knows a hanging will result, is glossed over in most accounts of his work. W.S. Hart, who acted in the stage version of the novel in 1907, was highly critical of Wister’s preference for abstract notions of justice over loyalty which, in W.S. Hart’s eyes, would have stopped the Virginian leading the posse to Arlen. Cooper, drawling beautifully, courtesy of Scott’s dialogue coaching, is the mythic cowboy and Huston the evil Trampas under whose sway Arlen falls. Having led the posse to Arlen after he’d turned to rustling, Cooper then hunts down Huston before marrying Brian. The film’s slowness is a direct result of the new slower pace sound brought to the cinema. d Victor Fleming p Louis D. Lighton s Edward E. Paramore Jnr, Howard Estabrook c J.

He plays the Arizona Kid (rather than the Cisco Kid) hiding out from the law in Utah and living on the proceeds, not of earlier robberies, but of the sale of gold from his private goldmine. Maris is the heroine and von Eltz (cast for his resemblance to Edmund Lowe, Baxter’s co-star in the earlier film) is the villain who steals the gold from Baxter.

The fault lies not in Huston’s interpretation of the role of Pancho Lopez but in Estabrook’s script which simply rehashes the melodramatics of the silent version as Huston, having settled matters with Blackmer’s villain, accepts his death at the hands of the Texas Rangers with equanimity.

Wayne, recommended to Walsh (who had intended to play the part himself before he lost an eye) by Ford, is more than adequate in the lead. However, soon after he was dropped by Fox and spent the thirties working on Poverty Row until Ford revived his flagging career with Stagecoach (1939). The film neatly unites a standard revenge plot (Wayne hunting for his father’s murderer) with the story of the first wagon train’s laborious progress along the Oregon Trail. The sequences of the wagons fording rivers and being manhandled up mountains and the action sequences are both realistic and visually breathtaking, but the interior scenes, as was the case with many early talkies, are spoilt by the genteel and overly theatrical speech patterns demanded by the film’s dialogue director, Lumsden Hare.

On his return from town to woo her he finds that Mason has rustled the Bar Q cattle and kidnapped Crawford who’s been brought to the range to serenade the cowboys. He rescues both. Gibson’s penchant for comedy and his self-indulgent attitude to his scripts sadly too often masked his considerable abilities. This skill was also obscured as increasingly sound Westerns lost the oddness that had characterized many of the best silents and the genre became more and more inflexible and the films more and more streamlined.

Of all the silent cowboy stars who learned to talk after the coming of sound, Maynard was the first to be interested in the idea of music and singing as well as talking and sound effects. In this, his last part-sound part-silent movie, he features a singing trio, the Hook Brothers. This film also sees Rice as Maynard’s side-kick for the first time. Cohen and Mason’s script, which has Maynard seeking revenge for the murder of his Texas Ranger brother, opts for a more dramatic tone than was usual. Thus, instead of an action-packed climax, we watch the killer, Adams, deteriorate as he waits and waits for Maynard to shoot it out at midnight.

As part of her contract, her husband, Bannister, was also hired, but in the role of the sheriff, not the outlaw who was played by Rennie. The film is virtually a transcription of the play, but without its melodramatic power. Such were the limitations of the early talkie, the film is wooden and stilted.

After a lenghty fistfight for openers, Steele is sought on a made-up charge and has to spend most of the film disguised (with Murdock) as half of an English dance-hall team, singing (well actually, miming) and dancing his way closer to the truth, before catching the villains in another lengthy fight.

Its success - produced for $160,000, it reportedly grossed over $1 million within a year - was further proof that sound Westerns could be profitable at all levels. It also marked a transition from the more melodramatic aspects of Westerns of the silent era to an almost nostalgic account of the glories of the old West, as in the long wagon-train journey with McCoy and Ray perpetual¬ ly attacked by Indians.

Unlike a film like Song of the West (1930) whose makers refused to acknowledge they were making a Western (of sorts), rather than filming a stage musical, St Clair and writer Farnham liberally splattered their film with Western cliches as part of the process of opening out the stage play it was based on. Set in a fantasy world where ranchers wear tuxedos and buy modernistic furniture for their ranch houses, the film follows Crawford, as the Easterner on the run from her rich but stuffy daddy, who marries a calloused cowhand, Brown, in his last role before Billy the Kid (1930) would make him a huge star.

Custer is the mysterious cowboy - in fact a secret serviceman on the track of horse thieves - who foils Chandler’s attempts to defraud an orphaned girl of her money. The plot is complicated by Chandler’s impersonating an army officer he and the gang of horse thieves have captured.

The script has him and Morrison vying for the affections of Quimby and Gibson being branded a thief after he is robbed of the money he got for selling Quimby’s father’s cattle in Kansas City. Toy, the Chinese girl he’s rescued in Kansas City, saves the day when she returns the money. A delightful picture.

It is imaginatively directed by Neill, a director better known for his superior Sherlock Holmes series of the forties, and brilliantly lit by Tetzlaff and Van Enger. The Townley-Morgan script sees Jones avenging the death of his brother, Fix, not as was usual his wife, and meting out justice to those responsible. As such it is a more domestic account of Murietta who is generally treated as the scourge of all gringos. As an indication of the way things were to develop, the film opens with a dubbed Jones serenading Revier. Although the actual Townley-Morgan screenplay was only remade once (by Lambert Hillyer as Vengeance of the West starring Wild Bill Elliott, in 1942), the Murrieta story was to be the basis of numerous later films, of which Robin Hood of El Dorado (1936) was just the first.\n\nWay Out West (mgm) b/w 71 min The first spoof Western of the sound era. Haines is the comic hero, a Western tenderfoot but an experienced trickster who does his cardsharping on cowboys, after being kicked out of the circus, only to have them force him to work off the $200 he cheated them out of. Saved by the love of Hyams, he in turn saves her from a sandstorm. Structured around Haines’ smart-aleck comic persona, the film was just the first of many to use the West as a novelty backdrop for its star. d Fred Niblo s Alfred Block, Ralph Spence, Joe Farnham c Henry Sharp Ip William Haines, Leila Hyams, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Vera Marsh, Charles Middleton\n\nThe Avenger\n\nBuck Jones as Joaquin Murrieta and Dorothy Revier as his wife in The Avenger, the first sound version of the Murrieta story.\n\nd Roy William Neill p Sol Lesser s George Morgan, Jack Townley c Teddy Tetzlaff, Charles Van Enger Ip Buck Jones, Edward Piel, Dorothy Revier, Otto Hoffman, Paul Fix, Slim Whitaker\n\nBattling with Buffalo Bill\n\n(u) b/w 12 chaps This was made by Universal to capitalize quickly on the phenomenal success of The Indians Are Coming (1930). However, although it is a superior serial, it did not match the success of the earlier chapter play in commercial terms. A major reason for its success is the second unit direction and stunting of Yakima Canutt. Canutt had starred in several early independent Westerns. Though he continued to act, usually as a villain"
