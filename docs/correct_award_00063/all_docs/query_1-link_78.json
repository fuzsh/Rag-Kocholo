        "text": "From Stockholm announcement was made that the Nobel Prize for Literature for 1923 had been awarded to the Irish poet-author, William Butler Yeats.\n\nSince The Wanderings of Oisin (a narrative poem based on Celtic legends), Yeats has been recognized as among the most distinguished of living poets. His life has been devoted to the Irish renaissance. In large measure he was the Irish renaissance. George Moore admits it. Synge, a finer dramatist, and Lady Gregory, a better technician, were directed by him. To him the Abbey Theatre (Dublin) owes its great days and its survival. His best drama is the Land of Heart’s Desire, but his fame rests upon his lyrics. In the U. S., Yeats’ complete works have been published by Macmillan.\n\nFormer Nobel Prize for Literature winners:Year Name Nationality\n\n1922 T.
