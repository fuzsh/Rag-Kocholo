        "text": "From The Times: November 13, 1920\n\nThe Swedish Academy has awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1919 to the Swiss poet Carl Spitteler, of Lucerne, and for 1920 to the Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun. The latter choice has been expected and is generally approved, but much astonishment is felt as to the former. M Spitteler is the author of Prometheus and Epimetheus, published in 1880, and of Olympischer Fruhling (1900-1906). Very little is known of him outside a small circle of admirers, although Meyer’s Dictionary compares him with Nietzsche. With few exceptions the Press this morning gives full vent to its astonishment. The Dagens Nyheter remarks that Carl Spitteler’s name is virtually unknown in the literary world, that this ignorance is not limited"
