        "text": "As many of you know, I’m slowly, very slowly, making my way through the Nobel Prize winners. April is poetry month in America, so I thought I would use this opportunity to focus on one of the poets on my Nobel list.\n\nCarl Friedrich Georg Spitteler (24 April 1845 – 29 December 1924) was a Swiss poet who grew up in the area around Basle. He wrote epic, heroic poetry from a pessimistic point of view. He created his own metric system with which to write his poems.\n\nHis early working life (1871-79) was spent in Russia and Finland as a tutor to the children of General Standertskjöld. He then described his first foray into the publishing world like this:\n\nI worked on Prometheus und Epimetheus, which, after my return to Switzerland, I published in 1881 at my own expense under the pseudonym Carl Felix Tandem. The book was completely neglected; because it was not even reviewed I abandoned all hope of making poetry my living and was compelled instead to teach school. [1]\n\nIn 1909 he revised Olympic Spring and re-published it in five volumes. It was this edition that brought him wider recognition and praise.\n\nPrometheus und Epimetheus (1881)\n\nExtramundana (1883, seven cosmic myths)\n\nSchmetterlinge (Butterflies 1889)\n\nDer Parlamentär (1889)\n\nLiterarische Gleichnisse (Literary Parables 1892)\n\nGustav (1892)\n\nBalladen (1896)\n\nConrad der Leutnant (1898)\n\nLachende Wahrheiten (1898, essays)\n\nDer olympische Frühling (1900–1905, revised 1910)\n\nGlockenlieder (Grass and Bell Songs 1906)\n\nImago (1906, novel)\n\nDie Mädchenfeinde (Two Little Misogynists 1907)\n\nMeine frühesten Erlebnisse (My Earliest Experiences 1914, biographical)\n\nPrometheus der Dulder (Prometheus the Suffering 1924)\n\nA few years ago Ross @ Ross’ Column posted a number of Spitteler’s poems in English – thank goodness, because trying to find English translations of his work was very difficult indeed. They’re not really my style but I’ve included two of my favourites from Ross’ blog below.\n\nA Vignette\n\nA troop of children scales the ridge, and cries\n\nChallenge to April skies.\n\n“Come on! No fear!”\n\nHats off! This is not play;\n\nThey mean to storm high-heaven today.\n\nIt lies so near!\n\nSee how, above, it peeps through tall green grasses!\n\nTwo silver bell-notes, borne on morning breeze that passes,\n\nHappy and careless, lightly swinging.\n\nCome singing, ringing.\n\n“Where lies our pathway now?”\n\n“Above that little crowd of starry faces,\n\nOver the hill we go\n\nTo paths that pearl-white cherry-blossom traces,”\n\nThey say – then sing, then soar\n\nTo hill, to cherry-blossoms, and are heard no more.\n\nBut what of the child-army under?\n\nOh, they are all gazing in wonder:\n\n“A hedge-hog!” they say –\n\nHeaven’s safe for to-day.\n\nA Shout of Joy\n\nOh what has changed my thought’s defiant tread\n\nTo wing`ed ride on drifting clouds o’erhead?\n\nIs it my view, unfettered and wide,\n\nO’er countryside?\n\nIs it the torrent’s ringing call,\n\nTumbling through woods from fall to fall?\n\nIs it the peal of sabbath bells\n\nThat clear from peaceful valley swells?\n\nAh, nay!\n\nMy joy has fairer feet than they.\n\nBecause this truth rings clear,\n\nLove shall be always near;\n\nAnd woman’s realm, divine, yet lowly,\n\nIs full of wonders holy;\n\nBecause my heart, in thirsting hour,\n\nHas thy love for its princely dower."
