        "text": "Carl Spitteler, German-Swiss epic and lyric poet, was born at Liestøl near Ble, in 1845, and died in 1924 at Lucerne, where he is buried in the romantic Friednental Cemetery. Recognition of his poetic talent was somewhat late in arriving, but he ultimately became a familiar name in Germany and Switzerland, while in France he was hailed by the French academy and other societies, as well as by the individual critics, as a poet of outstanding genius. In 1919 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, mainly on account of his epic, Olympian Spring. The Swiss Government has now appointed a Commission to prepare a national edition of his works, together with a full biography. A recent bibliography enumerates 230 titles of books and pamphlets dealing with Spitteler. His European reputation is thus one that English readers can hardly afford to ignore.\n\nThe prose-poem Prometheus and Epimetheus, published in 1880-81, was Spitteler's earliest literary work of importance, and at first elicited little notice. Prometheus, as a symbolic figure, remained one of his main interests throughout his life, just as Faust was for Goethe; and his last work, issued a short time before his death, was Prometheus the Long-Suffering (Prometheus der Dulder), a metrical and compacter version of the same legend. The general thesis is the same, though the treatment and episodes are different. It is no mere replica; the two epics stand side by side, like two renderings of the Madonna by the same painter. It is difficult to choose between the youthful exuberance and wide sweep of the prose-poem and the more mature and austere handling of the epic in verse. Every reader will have his own preference.\n\nAny attempt to give a brief synopsis or explanation of the poem would be misleading and futile. The English reader must be left to himself, even as the reader of the German original. As Spitteler himself to an enquirer: \"If you find these scenes beautiful, you have understood them, and I have nothing to explain; if you do not find them beautiful, so much worse for me, but I cannot give you an better explanation.\"\n\nCarl Friedrich Georg Spitteler (24 April 1845 – 29 December 1924) was a Swiss poet who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1919 \"in special appreciation of his epic, Olympian Spring\". His work includes both pessimistic and heroic poems.\n\nSpitteler was born in Liestal. His father was an official of the government, being Federal Secretary of the Treasury from 1849–56. Young Spitteler attended the gymnasium at Basel, having among his teachers philologist Wilhelm Wackernagel and historian Jakob Burckhardt. From 1863 he studied law at the University of Zurich. In 1865–1870 he studied theology in the same institution, at Heidelberg and Basel, though when a position as pastor was offered him, he felt that he must decline it. He had begun to realize his mission as an epic poet and therefore refused to work in the field for which he had prepared himself.[1]\n\nLater he worked in Russia as tutor, starting from August 1871, remaining there (with some periods in Finland) until 1879. Later he was elementary teacher in Bern and La Neuveville, as well as journalist for the Der Kunstwart and as editor for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung. In 1883 Spitteler married Marie op der Hoff, previously his pupil in Neuveville.\n\nIn 1881 Spitteler published the allegoric prose poem Prometheus and Epimetheus, published under the pseudonym Carl Felix Tandem, and showing contrasts between ideals and dogmas through the two mythological figures of the titles. This 1881 edition was given an extended psychological exegesis by Carl Gustav Jung in his book Psychological Types (published in 1921). Late in life, Spitteler reworked Prometheus and Epimetheus and published it under his true name, with the new title Prometheus der Dulder (Prometheus the Sufferer, 1924).\n\nIn 1882 he published his Extramundana, a collection of poems. He gave up teaching in 1885 and devoted himself to a journalistic career in Basel. Now his works began to come in rapid succession. In 1891 there appeared Friedli, der Kalderi, a collection of short stories, in which Spitteler, as he himself says, depicted Russian realism. Literarische Gleichnisse appeared in 1892, and Balladen in 1896.\n\nIn 1900–1905 Spitteler wrote the powerful allegoric-epic poem, in iambic hexameters, Olympischer Frühling (Olympic Spring). This work, mixing fantastic, naturalistic, religions and mythological themes, deals with human concern towards the universe. His prose works include Die Mädchenfeinde (Two Little Misogynists, 1907), about his autobiographical childhood experiences, the dramatic Conrad der Leutnant (1898), in which he show influence from the previously opposed Naturalism, and the autobiographical novella Imago (1906), examining the role of unconscious in the conflict between a creative mind and the middle-class restrictions with internal monologue.\n\nDuring World War I he opposed the pro-German attitude of the Swiss German-speaking majority, a position put forward in the essay \"Unser Schweizer Standpunkt\". In 1919 he won the Nobel Prize. Spitteler died at Lucerne in 1924.\n\nCarl Spitteler's estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern, in the Zürich Central Library and in the Dichter- und Stadtmuseum in Liestal.\n\nWorks:\n\nPrometheus und Epimetheus (1881)\n\nExtramundana (1883, seven cosmic myths)\n\nSchmetterlinge (\"Butterflies\", 1889)\n\nDer Parlamentär (1889)\n\nLiterarische Gleichnisse (\"Literary Parables”, 1892)\n\nGustav (1892)\n\nBalladen (1896)\n\nConrad der Leutnant (1898)\n\nLachende Wahrheiten (1898, essays)\n\nDer olympische Frühling (1900–1905, revised 1910)\n\nGlockenlieder (\"Grass and Bell Songs\", 1906)\n\nImago (1906, novel)\n\nDie Mädchenfeinde (Two Little Misogynists, 1907)\n\nMeine frühesten Erlebnisse (\"My Earliest Experiences\", 1914, biographical)\n\nPrometheus der Dulder (\"Prometheus the Suffering”, 1924)"
