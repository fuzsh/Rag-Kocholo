        "text": "1903 – 1909\n\n(First Nobel for Literature, that is)\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature goes back to the beginning of the twentieth century, when the Nobel Prize Committee decided to look beyond the sciences. The first prize was to be awarded in 1901. There wasn’t much question who deserved it. Leo Tolstoy was still alive. He was not only the greatest novelist ever, probably, but also an imposing moral figure, a champion of non-violent resistance who would eventually inspire Gandhi and Martin Luther King. So the first Nobel Prize in Literature went to …\n\nSully Prudhomme\n\nNo, I haven’t read anything of his. Have you?\n\nNext year they could still have awarded the prize to Tolstoy, although it would have been pretty embarrassing to have him getting it only after Prudhomme. So instead the prize went to the historian Theodore Mommsen. Thus began a century-plus long tradition of hit-and-miss awards. In some years, the awardees were acknowledged great writers. In other years, the winners were less well-known, but arguably merited the wider recognition that came with the prize. But many of the choices – and omissions – were just plain weird.\n\nIn response to all these wasted opportunities, Ted Gioia, musician, music historian, and author, offered his own list of authors who should have gotten the prize, year by year up to 2015, with a generous representation of popular writers as well as more literary ones. At least by one metric, he did a great job: among authors mentioned on this blog,\n\n10 appear on Gioa’s list but not on the actual winner list (Conrad, Joyce, Brecht, Borges, Tolkien, Dick, Larkin, Heinlein, Doctor Seuss (Theodor Geisel), and Joni Mitchell).\n\n1 appears on the actual winner list but not on Gioa’s list (Bertrand Russell).\n\n1 appears on both lists (Shaw)."
