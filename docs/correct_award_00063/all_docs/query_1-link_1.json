        "text": "Carl Spitteler (born April 24, 1845, Liestal, Switz.—died Dec. 29, 1924, Lucerne) was a Swiss poet of visionary imagination and author of pessimistic yet heroic verse. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1919.\n\nSpitteler was a private tutor for eight years in Russia and Finland. After he returned to Switzerland in 1879, he made his living as a teacher and journalist. He contributed articles to Der Kunstwart and was an editor of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung. In 1892 a legacy enabled him to settle in Lucerne and devote himself to creative work.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Study of Poetry\n\nSpitteler’s first great poetic work was the mythical epic Prometheus und Epimetheus (1881). His second great work (which won him the Nobel Prize) was the poetic epic Der olympische Frühling (1900–05; revised 1910; “The Olympic Spring”), in which he found full scope for bold invention and vividly expressive power. The last years of his life were given up to rewriting his first work. Tighter in composition than the early version and, like Der olympische Frühling, in rhyming couplets, it appeared in 1924 under the title Prometheus der Dulder (“Prometheus the Long-Suffering”)."
