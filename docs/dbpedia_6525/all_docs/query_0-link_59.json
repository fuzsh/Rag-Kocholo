Talbot's crew, comprised mostly of workers from his hometown of East Machias, Maine, constructed the mill and its company town on the Port's sand spit. The mill, despite briefly changing hands during the Great Depression, operated continuously for 142 years (1853-1995).

Thousands of people were displaced, 120 acres of land burnt, and approximately five-thousand people lost their jobs; close to twelve percent of the city. The city estimated its losses at over $8 million, which did not include personal losses or utilities damage, which may have brought the actual cost close to $20 million (appx. $650 million today).\n\nReconstruction from the so-called \"Great Seattle Fire\" was swift due to corporate sponsorship, municipal partnerships (namely Tacoma), and goverment relief programs. The city largely recouped its losses the year after, adding over five-hundred new buildings and numerous new development areas. In October 1889, the Seattle Fire Department was professionalized. Concurrently, the water utility was municipalized, modernized, and expanded.\n\n1/11 SE19\n\nTerry-Denny Building and Hotel Northern, Pioneer Square (W&S 4396)\n\nShows Simon Barman & Co.

Her family had solicited a carver to create a pole they felt represented Chief-of-All-Women, and raised it at a potlach in her honor. From 1790 the pole stood at Taant͏̛a (in Tongass Island) until members from the Seattle Chamber of Commerce with accessory from crew on the City of Seattle cut the totem down in August 1899 while most of the community was out fishing. It was taken to Seattle, incorrectly refitted and repainted, and \"gifted\" to the city, where it became a landmark at Pioneer Square. The Kinninook clan filed a petition to the Alaskan government for return of the pole and compensation for damages, and a grand jury was struck to indict eight Chambersmen for theft. However, the suit was dismissed after behind-closed-doors deals were reached with the US District Judge, the Seattle city government, and members of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the sponsors of the expedition wherein the theft occurred. The pole remained despite protests and further petition by the Kinninook clan. By 1917, advertising for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition intentionally removed the Kinninook clan from the narrative and popularized calling the kootéeyaa \"the Seattle totem pole\". By 1938, the pole suffered from dry rot and arson and the Seattle City Council and Park Board ordered the pole be taken down and recreated. The United States Forest Service offered to coordinate efforts to recreate the pole in collaboration with the Civilian Conservation Corps, who hired Tlingit carver Charles Brown and his team in Saxman, Alaska (which included descendants of Chief-of-all-Women) to carve a copy from red cedar. The copy was installed on July 14, 1940, where it continues to stand unchanged, except for conservation work by John C. Hudson, Jr. (Tsimshian) in 1972.\n\nSeattle's Totem Poles (Garfield, 1996). Tlingit Dictionary (Twitchwell, 2017).\n\nFrom top to bottom, the figures depicted in the totem are: Raven; the frog princess with her child; the frog princess' husband; Mink; Raven alongside Whale, with a seal in his mouth; and Raven-at-the-Head-of-Nass (Grandfather of Raven). Collectively they represent some stories from the The Raven Cycles (Yéil Ḵutláakw), and some stories from the \"Frog Princess\".\n\n1/13 SE44\n\n4th Ave from University St facing north (W&S 17518)\n\nFrom left, Cobb Building, Hotel Georgian, Hotel Raleigh, White and Henry Buildings.\n\n1/13 SE45\n\nPavillion at Leschi Park, Leschi (W&S 92)\n\nWritten on verso: Opened by John Cort in 1890 at th end of the Yesler Ave. cable car line on Lake Washington.\n\n1/13 SE46\n\nJohn Hay School, Queen Anne (W&S 4350)\n\nThe original John Hay School building now houses Queen Anne Elementary School, while later additions to the John Hay School have become John Hay Elementary, located on the same site.\n\n1/13 SE47 1/13 SE48\n\nTrolleys, horse-drawn carts, and pedestrians, 1st Ave from Cherry St facing north (W&S 5606)\n\nWritten on verso: right, Sullivan bldg., E.

In the year between 1915 and 1916, electric lights replaced acetylene gas headlamps, louvers were added to the vertical runs of the engine, and the windshield was combined with the cowl panel and moved behind the firewall.\n\n2/1 TP3\n\nWestern Airlines DC-4 on landing strip, Seattle-Tacoma Airport (W&S 483233)\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States military assumed control of many West Coast airports going into World War Two; both Boeing Field in South Seattle and McChord Field in Tacoma all but ceased civilian carriage. In 1942, the Civil Aeronautics Authority (the predecessor to the Federal Aviation Administration), formally sought a Puget Sound municipality to create a new airport for the area, which The Port of Seattle accepted. The Seattle-Tacoma Airport (\"SeaTac\") opened to full civilian operations on July 9, 1949 upon the completion of its first terminal. However, military and limited civilian use existed at the airport as early as October 1944.\n\nWestern Airlines, one of the major North American airlines until the latter half of the 20th century, began serving SeaTac in 1948. DC-4 planes were commonly used throughout World War Two, and refitted to serve civilian operations. The characteristic \"Arrowliner\" livery featured on this plane was common throughout the airline until the late 1950's.\n\nShips\n\nBox/Folder item 2/2 TP4\n\nSurvivors of Steamship Valencia alongside the City of Topeka, Cape Beale, Vancouver Island\n\nWritten on verso: Rescue of Survivors of Valencia Wreck off Van. Isl. 1906.\n\nBuilt in 1882 as a passenger liner from Caracas to New York City, in 1897 its service was reassigned to the West Coast following a brief attack near Cuba by Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes . While transporting passengers nearly a decade later off Cape Beale, part of the area known as the \"Graveyard of the Pacific\", the Valencia ran aground and sank. Considered one of the worst maritime disasters in the Graveyard, more than one-hundred people perished, including every woman and child on the boat.\n\n2/2 TP5 2/2 TP6\n\nSternwheeler Susie (W&S 2488)\n\nThe Susie was built in 1898 by the Howard shipyard at Jeffersonville, Indiana, using molds from the Ohio River boats Bluff City and Dolphin No. 3. Along with her sister ships Sarah and Hannah, she was shipped in sections to Unalaska, where she was assembled by the Alaska Commercial Co. and proceeded from there to St Michael and the Yukon under her own power. They were spectacular boats in the grand tradition of the Western river packets, particularly at night when they made their fast passages up and down the desolate Yukon with decks and cabins ablaze with lights. Their niceties included spacious mahogany paneled dining salons and two and three-berth staterooms to accommodate 150 first-class passengers. She was out of service by 1920.

During that time, his crew and guests hunted local flora and fauna then-unknown to Western science, and stole tangible and intangible heritage from many Tlingit communities.\n\nIn July of 1899, the SS George W Elder landed at the Tlingit village of Gaash, near Saanya Ḵwaan (Cape Fox), home to the Kaats’ Hít (Kaats’ House) of the Teiḵweidí (People of the Wolf/Eagle clans in and near Cape Fox). Members of the Expedition stole at.óow (treasured belongings) and used photographic and written documentation (largely by Edward Curtis), to support the theft. Following in Herriman's belief that these stolen artifacts ought to be \"[distributed]... for the benefit of others,\" many of these stolen at.óow were then given to promiment members of the settler-colonial scientific community. Edmond Meany, early 20th century professor at the University of Washington whose attic is pictured above, probably received these stolen at.óow from the Expedition directly. Edmond Meany's collection formed part of the original set of belongings entered into the Washington State Museum, which would eventually become the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.\n\nThe √gaasʼ (housepost) in the center of the photo is one of four stolen from the Teiḵweidí Kaats’ Hít in Cape Fox, and one of two which were \"reunited at the Burke Museum.\" These posts depict the story of Kaats’, the husband of a bear whose cubs killed him for betraying her, seen also on the Teiḵweidí crest as a grizzly bear. On July 23, 2001, after more than a decade in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation (NAGPRA) claims process, the Kaats’ Hít √gaasʼ was returned to Saanya Ḵwaan. In August 2005, a recreation of the housepost, along with a complement piece, was carved by Nathan and Stephen Jackson, and propatriated to the Burke Museum in kind.\n\nIn the Spirit of the Ancestors (Bunn-Marcuse and Wright, 2013).
