        "text": "Article content\n\nFormer Alberta politician Stan Schumacher is being remembered as a respected community leader and family man after his death at age 87.\n\nSchumacher’s lengthy political career spanned decades where he served federally and provincially, including time spent as MLA for Drumheller with four years as deputy speaker and four years as the first elected Speaker of the House.\n\nPremier Jason Kenney offered his condolences on the loss on Saturday, a week after Schumacher’s death from dementia, according to his family.\n\n“Stan had a unique combination of personal charm and steely resolve. His politics were unapologetically conservative. He was both a Canadian patriot and a relentless champion of Alberta, our values and way of life,” said Kenney in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nKenney said Schumacher was an “Albertan through and through” who was dedicated to bringing a voice to rural communities. In addition to his political efforts, he also served as head of the Alberta Shriners and chairman of the Alberta Surface Rights and Land Compensation Board.\n\nSchumacher was born in Hanna, Alta., just outside of his parents’ home town of Sunnynook. He then spent time in Dorothy and Drumheller before attending university in British Colombia, where Schumacher graduated in 1959 with a degree in law and commerce.\n\nIt was at school where he joined the Canadian Officer’s Training Corps, which brought him to Germany to serve with the Royal Canadian Dragoons, as part of the British Army of the Rhine.\n\n“Stan credited this training with causing the most significant changes in his life — confidence and the ability to be analytical,” said his family in his obituary. “Most importantly, it helped him to overcome his extreme shyness. He believed this new found self-assurance allowed him to go on to ‘do what he wanted to do,’ which would eventually be to enter the political arena.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe practised law before entering the political realm, first serving three terms in the House of Commons as a Progressive Conservative in the Palliser riding and later as MLA under the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta in Drumheller.\n\n“This prestigious office afforded him the opportunity to meet and travel with innumerable legislators from around the world,” said his family. “Throughout the years, Stan continued his work in law and the community, eventually creating Schumacher, Gough & Co.”\n\nHis political career ended in 1997 and he focused his efforts on the community thereafter. In 2012, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in recognition of his public service contributions to Albertans and Canadians over more than 45 years.\n\n“Stan succeeded at pretty much everything he put his mind to,” said Kenney.\n\n“Stan was a true champion of parliamentary traditions and institutions and, in my view, stands out as one of the great Speakers in Alberta legislative history.”\n\nalsmith@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter: @alanna_smithh\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
