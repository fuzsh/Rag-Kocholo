        "text": "Riding profile\n\nThis riding stretches east to the Saskatchewan/Alberta border and is one of the largest in south-central Alberta. Major centres include Drumheller, Stettler, Oyen, Consort and Brownfield. There is a federal medium-security penitentiary in the riding. Dinosaur Provincial Park is a big tourist draw in the Badlands in the southwest of the riding. In the 2010 electoral boundary changes, the riding expanded to include thirteen per cent of Battle River-Wainwright.\n\nPolitical history\n\nThe old riding of Drumheller-Chinook and its forerunners - the individual ridings of Drumheller and Chinook - have supported Tories since the 1970s. In 2008, Incumbent Jack Hayden trounced Liberal Tom Dooley by an almost 5-1 margin, winning 6,986 votes. In the earlier 2007 byelection, he also beat Dooley decisively. Hayden's predecessor, Shirley McClellan, held the seat for 20 years. She was first elected in the Chinook riding in a 1987 byelection, defeating Jack Ramsay of the Western Canada Concept. Her election wins afterwards had wider margins. In 2001, she received about seven times the number of votes for runner-up Liberal Greg Pyra. And in 2004, she defeated Alberta Alliance candidate Dave France by more than 5,000 votes. Her run as MLA ended in January 2007, when she resigned, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family. McClellan's predecessor in Chinook was PC Henry Kroeger, who served from 1979 until his death in 1987. The Drumheller riding was also represented by Tories Michael Clark (1979-86) and former MP Stan Schumacher (1986-97).\n\nCandidates"
