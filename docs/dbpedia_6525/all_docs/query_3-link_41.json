        "text": "As Monmouth County’s only countywide land trust, Monmouth Conservation Foundation’s overarching mission is to create a permanent legacy of open space and to protect the natural habitat and wildlife throughout the county for our generation and future generations.\n\nOur Properties\n\nEstablished as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 1977 by Michael Huber and Judith Stanley, Monmouth Conservation Foundation (MCF) has directly preserved thousands of acres throughout Monmouth County. The conservation and preservation of land creates a better quality of life – protecting the character of Monmouth County for everyone to appreciate and benefit.\n\nOur ongoing charge is to steadfastly continue that mission and serve our community to make Monmouth County an even more extraordinary place to live.\n\nCHRIS’ RIVER PLAZA MARINA (now known as Swimming River Park)\n\nMiddletown Township / 14 acres / Completed in 2015\n\nThis waterfront property located in the River Plaza section of Middletown, will soon be transformed by the County of Monmouth into a beautiful park. Located just over the bridge from Red Bank, Swimming River Park will feature numerous passive recreational options, such as a boat launch and sledding hill.\n\nFARIELLO PHASE 1 AND 2 (an addition to Freneau Woods Park)\n\nMarlboro Township / 66 acres\n\nThis land is a set of properties acquired in furtherance of a new Monmouth County regional park called Freneau Woods Park. The property was purchased as a collaborative effort by the Monmouth County Park System and the Monmouth Conservation Foundation. To date, 154 acres have been purchased, being acquired like pieces of a puzzle, that with future acquisitions will one day become a 250-acre regional County Park.\n\nABERDEEN WILSON ASSOCIATES (addition to Freneau Woods Park)\n\nAberdeen Township / 89 acres / Completed 2015\n\nAberdeen Wilson Associates is the largest acquisition of the Freneau Woods Park, comprised of 89 acres. MCF has partnered with the Monmouth County Park System, as well as the NY/NJ Baykeeper, to ensure this land is preserved for future generations. This new park will ultimately connect to the Henry Hudson Trail.\n\nBATES\n\nWall Township / 0.5 acres / Completed 1999\n\nBAUM\n\nTinton Falls Borough / 10+ acres / Completed 2000\n\nThis property, which sat within Shark River Park, was acquired by the Monmouth County Park System with aid from MCF. The property has become an addition to Shark River Park.\n\nBOWNE HOUSE EASEMENT\n\nMiddletown Township / 0.34 acres / Completed 1987\n\nIn MCF’s 10th Anniversary year, the historic Bowne House, located in the Leonardo section of Middletown, was purchased in an effort to preserve one of Monmouth County’s oldest homes. With the help of Mr. and Mrs. Sorenson, MCF placed a conservation easement on the property and exterior of the house to assure that the historic value of the house would be preserved.\n\nBREZA ROAD\n\nUpper Freehold Township & Allentown Borough / 101 acres\n\nMCF assisted project partners in the acquisition of this property. The preservation of this site met the goals of both communities and provided a greenbelt and scenic vista between the historic village of Allentown and the surrounding municipality.\n\nCHASE TRACT\n\nHolmdel Township / 416 acres / Completed 2001\n\nThe Chase Tract was part of the original 1677 land grant to the Holmes family, from which Holmdel got its name. The property contains several historic homes and barns dating back to the 1700 and 1800’s including the foundation of a rare Anglo-Dutch barn. MCF, with help from Friends of Holmdel Open Space, the Monmouth County Park System, Holmdel, the State Agricultural Development Committee and Green Acres, raised $19 million to purchase the property from Chase Manhattan Bank.
