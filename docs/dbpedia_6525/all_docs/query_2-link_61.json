Because of their remarkable properties, hydrogel systems are used for a wide range of biomedical applications, such as three-dimensional (3D) matrices for tissue engineering, drug-delivery vehicles, composite biomaterials, and as injectable fillers in minimally invasive surgeries. In addition, the rational design of hydrogels with controlled physical and biological properties can be used to modulate cellular functionality and tissue morphogenesis. Here, the development of advanced hydrogels with tunable physiochemical properties is highlighted, with particular emphasis on elastomeric, light-sensitive, composite, and shape-memory hydrogels. Emerging technologies developed over the past decade to control hydrogel architecture are also discussed and a number of potential applications and challenges in the utilization of hydrogels in regenerative medicine are reviewed. It is anticipated that the continued development of sophisticated hydrogels will result in clinical applications that will improve patient care and quality of life.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nHydrogels are three-dimensional (3D) networks consisting of hydrophilic polymer chains, which are crosslinked to form matrices with high water content (up to thousand of times their dry weight).[1] Due to their remarkable characteristics, including tunable physical, chemical, and biological properties, high biocompatibility, versatility in fabrication, and similarity to native extracellular matrix (ECM), hydrogels have emerged as promising materials in the biomedical field.[1–3] Significant progress has been made in the synthesis and fabrication of hydrogels from both natural and synthetic sources for various applications; these include regenerative medicine, drug/gene delivery, stem cell and cancer research, and cell therapy.[4–6] Naturally-derived hydrogels, such as collagen, chitosan, hyaluronic acid (HA), alginate, gelatin, elastin, chondroitin sulfate, and heparin, are appealing for biological applications due to their cell signaling and cell-interactive properties, and biodegradability.[7] However, their limitations include low mechanical properties, inability to control their degradation and structure, and potential immunogenicity. On the other hand, synthetic hydrogels, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), and polyacrylamide (PAM), possess controllable degradation and microstructure, generally show high mechanical properties, but lack biological moieties.[3,7] Due to the distinct properties of each of these hydrogel classes, gels that are based on the combination of natural and synthetic polymers have attracted significant attention for biological and biomedical applications.[8]\n\nVarious crosslinking approaches, including chemical and physical, have been employed to create polymer networks and preserve their 3D structures in aqueous environments. In physically crosslinked gels, physical interactions between polymer chains prevent dissociation of the hydrogel, while in chemically crosslinked gels, covalent bonds between polymer chains create stable hydrogels. Physically crosslinked hydrogels are formed through changes in environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, and ionic interactions), hydrogen bonds, and protein interactions. There has been a growing interest in using this class of hydrogels for tissue regeneration as the gelation often occurs in mild conditions and aqueous solution in the absence of chemical crosslinkers.[9] Various injectable hydrogels based on alginate, collagen, agarose, HA, and chitosan have been synthesized by using physical crosslinking approaches for engineering different tissues.[10] These gels can be confined in the damaged site and eliminate the need of invasive surgery. However, low mechanical properties of physically crosslinked hydrogels may limit their tissue engineering applications, particularly in the regeneration of load bearing tissues. Chemically crosslinked gels have been obtained by radical polymerization, chemical reactions, energy irradiation, and enzymatic crosslinking. Some examples of chemically crosslinked gels for tissue engineering applications include PHEMA, glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinked PVA, elastin, and chitosan, UV crosslinked methacrylated gelatin and elastin, transglutaminases crosslinked fibrinogen hydrogels.[9,11–13] Generally, chemically crosslinked gels have higher mechanical properties compared to their physically crosslinked counterparts, but the residual chemical crosslinkers, organic solvents, and photoinitiator may cause cytotoxicity.\n\nOver the past decade, complex hydrogels have been designed as a result of major breakthroughs in the field of polymer science, microscale technologies, and molecular biology.[4,6] These advances have set the framework to overcome some of the challenges in regenerative medicine by rational design of hydrogels for various medical applications. This review covers the design principles being applied to synthesize advanced hydrogels with enhanced mechanical, biological, chemical and electrical properties. Due to their important biomedical applications, particular emphasis is given to elastomeric, photo-sensitive, hybrid and shape-memory hydrogel systems. In addition, emerging techologies for controlling the micro- and nanoscale architectures of 3D hydrogel constructs and their potential applications are highlighted.\n\n2. Advanced Hydrogels with Tunable Properties\n\n2.1. Elastomeric Materials\n\nBiomaterials have been used as an artificial ECM to support the regeneration of various tissues. Since elasticity is one of the major mechanical characteristics of soft tissues, significant efforts have been made to engineer elastomeric biomaterials, which mimic the ability of native tissues to extend under stress. Mimicking the non-uniform elasticity of innate tissues including skin, blood vessel, lung, cardiac, and muscle is one of the major challenges in tissue engineering. Due to the high stretchability of native tissues, thermoplastic polymers with elongation break of less than 3% fail to replicate the innate tissue elasticity, as they undergo plastic deformation under variable loading.[14] To overcome this limitation, elastomeric hydrogels have been developed for biomedical applications.[15,16] However, one of the challenges associated with these elastomeric systems is their inability to mimic non-uniform elasticity of the native tissue. For example, many of the native tissues display strain stiffening and are responsive to applied strain, which can not be easily obtained by elastomeric systems.[17]\n\nThe use of synthetic elastomers for medical devices dates back to 1890s when the rubber industry was developed. Since then, natural and synthetic rubbers, such as silicones, polyolefins, and polydienes, and polyurethanes have been widely used as elastomers to engineer various medical devices due to their biocompatibility, mechanical durability, and low cost.[15]\n\nIn the last three decades, the rise of hydrogels as a popular choice of elastomeric materials for a variety of applications has been observed.[18] In this section, we focus on natural- and synthetic-derived elastomeric hydrogels, which are particularly useful for soft tissue engineering applications. We also discuss their limitations and potential applications for engineering biomimetic tissue constructs.\n\n2.1.1. Naturally-Derived Elastin-Based Elastomers\n\nElastin is one of the main elastomeric proteins in connective tissues that are exposed to repetitive strains such as major vascular vessels, aorta, skin, elastic cartilage, tendon, and lung. Elastin is the essential component that provides elasticity and resilience needed for the proper function of these tissues. For example, the presence of elastin in arterial walls facilitates the blood transfer from the heart, lowers the mechanical work performed by the heart, and preserves the steady flow of oxygen to tissues.[19] In addition, elastin fibers allow blood vessels to withstand continuous cycles of contraction and expansion over the course of a life time.[20] Elastin is also known for being the most persistent and durable protein in the human body, with a half-life of 70 years.[18]\n\nElastin plays a critical biological role in regulating cellular functions. Various cell-surface proteins including elastin binding protein (EBP),[21] glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),[22] and integrin αvβ3[23] have been identified as receptors for elastin and its derivatives. Binding with these receptors has been shown to facilitate various cellular interactions. For example, it was found that elastin induced the attachment and proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs) and formation of vascular networks.[24] In addition, elastin derivatives could enhance the in vitro proliferation of skin fibroblasts.[23,25] Elastin fibers in the skin were also shown to influence cellular phenotypes during wound healing processes by controlling the differentiation of proliferative dermal fibroblasts into contractile myofibroblasts to help close the wound.[26] The presence of various cell-interactive segments in elastin and its derivatives enable them to modulate cellular functions. For example, VGAPG peptide sequences in elastin facilitate the formation of epidermis layer by inducing the migration and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes.[27] These unique features demonstrate the potential value of elastin as a biologically active molecule for engineering elastic hydrogels in tissue engineering.\n\nVarious techniques have been developed to synthesize and purify elastin molecules from natural sources to engineer elastin-based hydrogels. Elastin can be obtained by partial hydrolysis of decellularized elastin-rich tissues in animals or by expression of recombinant protein.\n\nDecellularized Tissues as Elastin-Based Scaffolds\n\nNatural elastin-containing scaffolds can be generated by tissue decellularization, which removes the cellular component of explant tissues by detergent, enzymatic digestions, and solvent extraction processes. Due to their stability and durability, elastin-based tissues preserve their functions and structure after decellularization. Decellularized elastic scaffolds have been used as suitable replacements of lung, bladder, artery, heart valve, skin, and vascular graft.[28–30] Despite their advantages, decellularized scaffolds have several limitations. For example, the decellularization process involves harsh reaction conditions (e.g., enzymatic, chemical, or physical treatments) that may compromise the biological and mechanical properties of the constructs, particularly when additional steps of tissue purification are used.[31] Other limitations include batch-to-batch variability, risk of pathogen transfer, inability to obtain highly purified elastic tissue, and lack of versatility and uniformity of decellularized elastic tissues.[31]\n\nElastin Hydrogels Made from Soluble Elastin\n\nHydrolyzed elastin, soluble in aqueous solvents, has been used to engineer elastic hydrogels. The insolubility of intact elastin fibers in tissues prevents their processing into elastin-based hydrogels. To solve this problem, elastic tissues have been treated with oxalic acid or potassium hydroxide to yield soluble forms of elastin (e.g., α-elastin and K-elastin).[32,33] These hydrolyzed elastin molecules have properties similar to the native tropoelastin, such as ability to coacervate as well as to regulate cell signaling via the elastin receptors. This demonstrates the potential biological value of this class of elastin derivatives for biomedical applications.\n\nSeveral elastin-based hydrogels have been synthesized from solubilized elastin for engineering different tissues such as skin,[32,34,35] cartilage,[36,37] and blood vessels.[38] For example, α-elastin hydrogels have been fabricated through chemical crosslinking approaches using various types of crosslinking agents.[32,34,40] Highly porous and elastic hydrogels were also engineered by crosslinking α -elastin with glutaraldehyde (GA)[34] and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI)[32] under high pressure CO2. The fabricated hydrogels facilitated the infiltration, attachment, and growth of 3T3 fibroblasts within the 3D structure of the hydrogels.[32,34] In addition, the combination of α-elastin with poly caprolactone (PCL) promoted chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation.[36,39] Regeneration of cartilage tissue has also been achieved by using composite hydrogels containing K-elastin, alginate, and collagen.[37] Chondrocytes isolated from porcine and human were embedded inside the hydrogel composite and subsequently implanted in nude mice. After 12 weeks of implantation, cartilage-specific components including proteoglycans, collagen, and elastin fibers were formed within the engineered tissues which closely mimicked the native articular cartilage.[37] Despite its extensive use in tissue engineering, animal-derived soluble elastin is a heterogeneous mixture of peptides which are partially crosslinked and may not have adequate cell binding sites.[41] In addition, the clinical use of animal-derived proteins is often restricted due to the risk of pathogen transfer and immunological rejection.[42]\n\nRecombinant Elastin-Based Hydrogels\n\nElastin-based elastomers can be also produced from various recombinant elastin proteins (e.g., recombinant elastin like polypeptides (ELP) and recombinant human tropoelastin). These proteins are obtained via the expression of recombinant DNA in different hosts including plants,[43–45] yeast,[46,47] and Escherichia coli (E. coli).[48]\n\nRecently, human recombinant tropoelastin (rhTE) has been used to generate elastic rhTE-based hydrogels. Previously, rhTE was obtained in very low yield by construction of an expression vector containing the cDNA sequence of an isoform of human tropoelastin.[49] To enhance the production yield, Martin and Weiss developed a 2210-bp synthetic human TEL-encoding gene (SHEL) which contained codons optimized for maximum expression of rhTE in commercial yields.[50] This rhTE has been processed into a variety of promising hydrogels for tissue engineering applications.[27]\n\nElastic rhTE-based hydrogels with excellent cell-interactive properties have been created by using various approaches including, enzymatic crosslinking using yeast lysyl oxidase (PPLO),[51] chemical crosslinking,[52,53] using a fungal copper amine oxidase,[54] physical crosslinking,[55] and UV crosslinking.[13,56] For example, rhTE were chemically crosslinked by GA ( )[52] or bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) ( )[57] to generate hydrogels in various forms such as sheets, sponges, and tubes. The fabricated hydrogels promoted in vitro attachment, proliferation, and growth of dermal fibroblast cells ( ).[52] Furthermore, cellular penetration within the 3D structures of these hydrogels was significantly promoted by increasing the level of porosity and average pore sizes of the gels through the incorporation of GAGs[58] and the use of high pressure CO2.[52] In addition, the BS3 crosslinked rhTE hydrogels, that were implanted subcutaneously in guinea pigs, exhibited high biocompatibility and stability up to 13 weeks of culture ( ).[57] A physical crosslinking approach was also used to generate rhTE hydrogels by increasing the pH of protein solutions, which facilitated the self-assembly of rhTE spherules in a sol-gel transition process.[55] This approach eliminated the use of chemical or enzyme crosslinkers. The resulting hydrogel was highly flexible and elastic with compressive modulus of about 1.7 MPa over 5 cycles ( ). These hydrogels also facilitated the attachment and proliferation of dermal fibroblast in vitro and were stable for two weeks after intradermal injection into rats ( ).[55] Recently, a highly elastic photocrosslinkable hydrogel, methacrylated tropoelastin (MeTro), with tunable physical properties has been synthesized by functionalization of rhTE with methacrylate groups and subsequent UV crosslinking.[13] This approach was used to control the physical properties of resulting hydrogels including swelling behavior, porosity, and mechanical properties by altering the methacrylation degree and MeTro concentration. The fabricated MeTro hydrogels displayed high resilience, reversible deformation with low energy loss following cyclic compressions, and substantial extensibility up to 400% before rupture ( ). In addition, in vitro studies showed that MeTro hydrogels supported cellular attachment and growth in both 2D and 3D culture environment.[13] Micropatterns were then created on the surface of these elastic hydrogels with microscale technology to fabricate micropatterned MeTro hydrogels, which were used to align cardiomyocytes (CMs) isolated from rat hearts ( ).[56] The in vitro studies demonstrated that these microfabricated MeTro hydrogels successfully promoted all the characteristics of CMs including attachment, spreading, alignment, phenotype and synchronized beating, which ultimately led to the formation of highly functionalized cardiac tissues ( ).[56] rhTE-based elastomeric hydrogels have shown unique mechanical and biological properties[59] and exhibited potential advantages compared to animal-derived hydrolyzed soluble elastin. First, rhTE is synthesized using a highly reproducible recombinant technology, which eliminates the batch-to-batch variations associated with soluble elastin derived from animal sources. Second, as shown by the animal studies using rhTE-based hydrogels, rhTE carries little risk of immunological rejection upon implantation.[59] Third, the abundance of cell-responsive peptides on rhTE molecules[23] significantly promotes biological properties of rhTE-based biomaterials as compared to soluble elastin.\n\n2.1.2. Synthetic Elastomers\n\nSynthetic degradable elastomers have received significant attention for tissue engineering applications, particularly for soft tissue regeneration. Their unique features include 3D crosslinked networks, which mimic the structure of naturally-derived elastic materials, high elasticity and flexibility, biodegradability, and mechanical properties similar to those of native soft tissues.[16] In addition, the physical properties of these elastomers can be adjusted by changing their processing conditions. The synthesis and preparation of synthetic degradable elastomers have been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere.[15,16] In this section, we introduce several examples of the synthetic elastic materials and composites, which can be used to form elastic hydrogels.\n\nElastin-like Polypeptides (ELPs)\n\nELPs containing repetitive amino acids have been synthesized and extensively used to engineer highly elastic hydrogels.[60,61] This class of polymers possesses promising properties for tissue engineering including tunable degradation rates and similarity to native ECM. In addition, their fabrication method allows the incorporation of bioactive peptide moieties within their structures during polymer synthesis.\n\nELP-based elastomers have been fabricated for the regeneration of blood vessels, cartilage, ocular, and liver tissues.[60,61] For example, cell-laden ELP hydrogels were fabricated by Betre et al. for cartilage repair.[62] To form these injectable cell-laden hydrogels, temperature-triggered coacervation of ELPs was used to encapsulate chondrocytes. The resulting gels facilitated the growth and proliferation as well as the formation of cartilage ECM (e.g., deposition of glycosaminoglycans and collagen).[62] These ELP-based hydrogels also facilitated the in vitro differentiation of human adipose-derived adult stem cells into chondrocytes without the addition of chondrogenic growth factors.[63] Despite the suitable biological properties, these coacervated ELP hydrogels lacked mechanical stability and stiffness, which limited their tissue engineering applications. To fabricate ELP-based gels with higher mechanical properties, researchers have chemically crosslinked a lysine containing ELP by using β-[tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphino]propionic acid (THPP) under physiological conditions.[64–67] The THPP-crosslinked ELP hydrogels supported cell penetration and formation of ECM after injection into an osteochondral defect using a goat model. However, their fast degradation rate was an issue.[67] ELPs containing lysine were also crosslinked using various types of crosslinking agents such as tris-succinimidyl aminotriacetate[66] and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate.[68]\n\nThe unique properties of ELP-based hydrogels, such as their tunable degradation and mechanical properties, and low toxicity, make them a promising class of materials for biomedical applications. However, in vivo biocompatibility of ELP-based hydrogels is still unknown as there are only few in vivo studies on these materials. Therefore, it is crucial to study the immune response against a comprehensive library of ELPs prior to clinical application. It is expected that more systematic approaches for engineering ELPs with controlled biological properties will be developed. Microengineered technologies can also be used to tailor the properties and architectures of ELP-based materials to further advance the potential applications of this class of polymers in regenerative medicine.\n\nPoly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS)\n\nPGS has been synthetized by polycondensation of glycerol and sebacic acid,[69] and used as a promising polyester-based elastomer for soft tissue engineering applications. PGS has been used in various forms including sheets, porous scaffolds, electrospun fibers, and microfabricated constructs for the regeneration of soft tissues such as vascular,[70] cardiac,[71] retinal,[72] cartilage,[73] and neural[74] tissues. Despite having promising properties, PGS has limited water uptake capacity (approximately 2%), which constrains its utility as a hydrogel for soft tissue engineering applications. The hydrophilicity of PGS can be improved by incorporating additional carboxyl groups in PGS backbone[75] or by its copolymerization with PEG.[76–78] Recently, poly(glycerol sebacate citrate) (PGSC) was synthesized by thermally curing citric acid and PGS mixture in a mold.[75] The biodegradation and mechanical properties of elastomeric PGSC scaffolds were controlled by its composition as well as the thermal curing time. The presence of hydroxyl groups in the backbone of PGSC improved the water uptake properties of the elastomer, which can be beneficial for tissue regeneration.[75] Our group has also demonstrated the synthesis of highly elastic PGS-co-PEG copolymers with controlled swelling behaviors.[76] The mechanical properties and degradation of resulting elastomers were finely tuned by changing the water uptake properties of the hydrogels. The elastic modulus of PGS-co-PEG was in the range of 13 kPa to 2.2 MPa, depending on the concentration of PEG incorporated within the copolymer. In addition, the presence of PEG in the polymer network resulted in a 15-fold increase in water uptake capability and a 6-fold increase in elongation as compared with PGS elastomers. The PGS-co-PEG copolymers supported the growth and proliferation of 3T3 fibroblasts over 10 days of culture, demonstrating the suitability of synthesized elastomers for tissue engineering applications.[76]\n\nDue to their tunable physical properties, PGS-based materials are promising candidates for engineering soft tissues, particularly cardiovascular tissues. Despite significant progress in utilizing PGS elastomers for tissue regeneration, there are still some challenges including their fast degradation rate (several weeks), which limits their applications for engineering tissues that require longer time to regenerate (several months to years). In addition, PGS polymers produce acidic degradation products, which causes cytotoxicity in vitro.[74,79] However, in vivo assessment of PGS-based scaffolds showed little to mild inflammation.[73,80,81] It has been shown that increasing the crosslinking density can improve the in vitro cytocompatibility of PGS-based elastomers.[79,82] Other limitations of PGS for soft tissue engineering applications include difficulties in achieving non-linear elastic behavior similar to native soft tissue and their inability to be used as a 3D environment for cellular encapsulation due to their harsh processing conditions (e.g., high temperature).\n\nPolyurethanes (PU)\n\nSince the 1980s, PU materials have been widely used for engineering cardiovascular devices including vascular prostheses, cardiac valves, the total artificial hearts, blood bags, and small diameter grafts for bypass surgeries. Due to their long-term stability, PU-based scaffolds have been utilized for long-term implantation. Tuning biodegradability and durability of PU-based materials is an essential step for their tissue engineering applications. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a new class of biodegradable PUs for engineering various tissues including vascular grafts,[83] neural tissue,[84] bone,[85] and cardiac muscle.[86,87] These biodegradable PU-based polymers have been synthesized by incorporating chain extenders or soft segments (e.g., caprolactone, lactides, amino acids, and PEG) in PU backbone to induce degradability and in some cases hydrophilicity. For example, Zhang et al. synthesized a series of photocrosslinkable PU hydrogels containing PEG and PCL as the soft segment, lysine diisocyanate (LDI) as the hard segment, and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as the chain terminator.[88] The physical properties of fabricated elastic PU hydrogels were tuned by changing the ratio of PCL/PEG in the soft segment. For example, increasing the amount of PEG enhanced the swelling ratio and degradation rate but reduced the mechanical properties of fabricated PU hydrogels. The fabricated PU hydrogels had swelling ratio in the range of 3.2–66%, elastic modulus ranging from 17–34 MPa, and fracture strain of 5–61% when the ratio of PEG/PCL was changed from 0/100 to 50/50. The PU hydrogels supported mouse chondrocyte attachment and proliferation.[88] Recently, an injectable amine-functionalized PU/PEG block co-hydrogel was synthesized and exhibited its highest elastic modulus at 37 °C.[89] The fabricated composite supported in vitro growth of smooth muscle cells. The results of in vivo test exhibited significant inflammatory response 3 days post-implantation with the presence of recruited ED-1 positive macrophages but the amount of inflammation decreased 4 weeks after implantation.[89] In another recent study, highly elastic PU-based biomaterials, with extensibility of more than 1100%, were fabricated by the solution blending of sodium alginate and an aqueous solution of cationic PU to form cationic dispersions-sodium alginate nanoparticles.[90] Incorporating sodium alginate into PU network improved the mechanical strength as well as the hydrophilicity of the composite network.[90] Similarly, Huang et al. combined a hierarchical PU scaffold with a cell-laden hydrogel composed of gelatin, alginate, and fibrinogen by using a rapid prototyping technique to form 3D vascular constructs.[91] The external PU scaffold provided adequate mechanical support while the internal hydrogel construct supported adipose-derived stem cell growth and proliferation in vitro. The fabricated PU/cell-laden hydrogel was also found to be stable and biocompatible after two weeks of implantation in the abdominal cavity of nude mice.[91]\n\nThese results together indicate that biodegradable PU-based composite hydrogels are promising elastic biomaterials for tissue engineering. These highly elastic materials have shown proper durability and good biocompatibility in vitro by supporting cellular adhesion and proliferation during culture. However, the in vivo evaluation of biodegradable PU-based scaffolds demonstrated limited stability and consequently mechanical failures. In addition, the toxic degradation products of PUs (e.g., aromatic diisocyanates) can cause cytotoxicity.[92] To address this problem, aromatic diisocyanates have been replaced with aliphatic ones such as lysine diisocyanates for the synthesis of bioresorbable PU.[93,94] However, more investigation on the in vivo response to biodegradable PU-based materials and their susceptibility to biodegradation is required.\n\nComposite Elastomers\n\nVarious types of composite elastomers have been developed including nanocomposite hydrogels ( ),[95,96] polyrotaxane gel ( ),[97] double network (DN) gels,[98] hydrophobic bilayers (PDGI)/polyacrylamide (PAAm) ( ),[99] and PAAm/alginate composite gel[100] ( ). For example, polymer/clay nanocomposites composed of N-isopropylacrylamide and hectorite clay Laponite XLG were formed by free radical polymerization of the polymer in an aqueous suspension of clay. The resulting hydrogel had tensile modulus in the range of 270–300 kPa and elongation of up to 1300%. The fabricated nanocomposite gels could also withstand high levels of deformation in twisting, bending, and knotting[95] ( ). In another study, highly elastic hydrogels were formed by ionic crosslinking in combination with physically associated triblock copolymer chains, but these hydrogels could only recover up to 50% of their initial deformation.[101] To solve this problem, Haque et al. incorporated lamellar PDGI in a hydrophilic PAAm matrix as reversible sacrificial bonds to dissociate upon deformation with large energy dissipation.[99] The fabricated hydrogel was highly elastic with a tensile strength of 38 kPa and strain of 2200%. The hydrogel fully recovered its original length within several minutes after stress removal ( ). Despite their high recovery capability, these PDGI/PAAm gels had lower fracture energy compared to DN gels. Recently, a highly stretchable and tough hydrogel was synthesized by mixing ionically crosslinked alginate, and covalently crosslinked PAAm ( ).[100] The fabricated hydrogels were able to stretch more than 20 times of their initial length. The hydrogel sheets were also shown to be notch-insensitive and fully recovered after mechanical stretching caused by dropping a metal ball on the hydrogel membrane.[100]\n\n2.2. Photosensitive Hydrogels\n\nHydrogels can be crosslinked or degraded by utilizing various approaches such as ionic interactions, pH stimulation, and light exposure.[102] Photosensitive hydrogels have been extensively used for a wide range of tissue engineering applications. In this section, we will discuss about polymer networks, which can be either generated or degraded by UV light exposure.\n\n2.2.1. Photocrosslinkable Gels\n\nTo form hydrogels via exposure to light, a photocurable hydrogel precursor is mixed with a photoinitiator and then exposed to light that initiates the crosslinking reaction.[2] Although a range of light wavelengths can be used, ultraviolet (UV) light is most commonly used to induce the photoinitiator to generate free radicals. The activated functional groups then form covalent bonds with free radicals to create crosslinked networks.[103,104] Subsequently, unreacted polymer is washed out upon completion of the crosslinking process. Photocrosslinkable hydrogels offer a number of advantages over other types of crosslinking schemes. For example, they enable controlled spatial crosslinking of the hydrogel to control the microarchitecture of the resulting material,[105–107] which can be used to modulate cellular behavior (e.g., adhesion, migration, and differentiation).[108,109] In addition, photocrosslinking is a simple, rapid, and cost effective technique.[2,6] Despite these attractive features, photocroslinkable hydrogels also demonstrate some drawbacks. For instance, the formation of free radicals upon UV exposure may lead to DNA damage and impair cellular function.[2] In addition, in vivo gelation of photocrosslinkable hydrogel is challenging due to the limited light penetration through the tissues.\n\nMaterials with both synthetic and natural origins have been modified with photocrosslinkable functional groups.[107] For instance, PEG[110–112] and PHEMA[113] were chemically modified by methacrylate groups to synthesize photocrosslinkable hydrogels ( ). Similarly, naturally-derived materials, such as alginate,[114] dextran,[115] agarose,[116] heparin,[117] hyaluronan,[118–121] chitosan,[122] collagen,[123] and gelatin[12,119,124–126] were methacrylated to yield photocurable gels. These photocrosslinkable hydrogels were used as robust 3D environments to engineer biomimetic cell-laden hydrogels for different tissue engineering applications. For instance, 3T3 fibroblast cells were encapsulated within photocurable gelatin hydrogels to test the biocompatibility of the gels.[12,127] Similarly, macrophages,[110] human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)[107] and hepatocytes[111] were tested for their cellular response within photocrosslinkable gels based on PEG, gelatin, and HA.\n\nMicropatterning using photocrosslinkable gels is a common strategy to modulate cellular behavior. For example, micropatterned gelatin-based hydrogels enabled guidance and alignment of different cell types, such as 3T3 fibroblasts, C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, cardiac side population (CSP) cells, and HUVECs.[128] These technologies will be discussed in details in Section 3. Photocrosslinkable hydrogels allow temporal and spatial control over structural, mechanical, and degradation of the fabricated constructs. For example, in one study methacrylated HA gel was first crosslinked by a Michael-type addition reaction with dithiothreitol (DTT) and then its mechanical stiffness was tuned by additional UV crosslinking.[129] It was shown that the substrate stiffness affected differentiation of MSCs, seeded on the surface of the hydrogel.\n\nDue to their ability to generate micro- and nanostructures, as well as their tunable chemical, biological and mechanical properties, photocrossinkable hydrogels have been extensively used in tissue engineering research. However, the next generation of photocrosslinkable hydrogels could further benefit from novel strategies for in situ crosslinking of these hydrogels within the human body.\n\n2.2.2. Photodegradable Gels\n\nHydrogel structures can be controlled both spatially and temporally to modulate material properties and therefore their biological response.[130] When photodegradable gels are exposed to irradiation, light-triggered reactions induce dissociation of the crosslinks in the polymer chain and therefore its degradation in the exposed region. This results in either complete degradation or local decrease in the crosslinking density, which influences the physical properties of the gel and subsequently cellular behaviors.[131] For example, the degradation of cell-encapsulated hydrogels can facilitate the deposition of the ECM by the cells as well as guide cellular migration within the hydrogel.\n\nThe most commonly used photodegradable functional groups are nitrobenzyl ether,[130] poly(t-butyl acrylate),[132] 4-[4-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy] butanoic acid,[133] and bis(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)(4-vinylphenyl)methyl leluco cyanide.[134] Photodegradable hydrogels from different synthetic sources have been fabricated by the incorporation of the above listed groups to the polymer backbone.[132,133,135–142] For example, the migration of stem cells was guided within photodegradable PEG-based hydrogels.[143] In addition to their bulk degradation ability, photodegradable hydrogels can also be patterned by irradiating light through photomasks to generate specific patterns for modulating or directing cellular migration. In one study, directed migration of fibrosarcoma cells within photodegradable hydrogels was investigated.[130] In another report, DeForest et al. controlled the architecture of PEG-based photodegradable hydrogels, which led to the modulation of the adhesion, spreading, and migration of 3T3 fibroblasts.[144]\n\nGenerally, photodegradation enables tuning the hydrogel structure and properties spatially and temporally and offers unique opportunities to control cellular function in 3D environments. But tissue engineering applications of photodegradable hydrogels have been less explored. In addition, similar to their photocrosslinkable counterparts, sensitivity of cells to irradiation may be a concern for cell encapsulation; therefore the process should be optimized.[142] It is expected that photodegradable hydrogels to be utilized to direct cellular behavior dynamically and control local microenvironments for different tissue engineering applications ranging from directed migration of neurons, formation of cardiac fibers, and photorelease of biological molecules.\n\n2.3. Reinforced Composite Hydrogels\n\nHydrogels are generally made from a single polymer network. But no single polymer holds all the required mechanical and biological properties for tissue engineering applications. Therefore, strategies are being employed to improve the properties of hydrogels, mainly by incorporating different entities to create composite hydrogel matrices.[145–147] These strategies include incorporation of secondary polymers as well as various nanostructures into the main hydrogel. In this section, we will discuss the fabrication and characterization of these composite hydrogels.\n\n2.3.1. Polymer-Composite Hydrogels\n\nThe simplest way to create composite materials is by mixing different materials (‘physical blending’). As polymers used to fabricate hydrogels are hydrophilic, they are generally compatible with one another, and miscible in aqueous solutions. For example, alginate hydrogels are widely used in various bioengineering applications.[148] However, alginate alone may not induce the desired cellular response. Therefore, ECM proteins such as collagen and fibronectin, or cell-responsive synthetic polymers such as polylysine are often mixed with alginate to regulate its cell-interactive properties.[149,150] In addition, mechanical properties of the alginate hydrogels were enhanced by incorporating other natural or synthetic polymers (e.g., chitosan, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(acrylic acid)(PAA)) into hydrogels.[151–153] There are other types of polymer-composite hydrogels utilizing more elaborate strategies to incorporate a secondary polymeric network, such as hybrid networks, interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs), and semi-IPNs.\n\nHybrid Hydrogels\n\nOne critical drawback of incorporating secondary polymers via physical blending is that only limited amounts of the polymers can be included within the hydrogel network. Often, inadequate inclusion of the secondary polymers within the hydrogels leads to phase separation.[154,155] Therefore, co-polymerization schemes are employed to covalently link the secondary polymers to the hydrogel, and ultimately create fully integrated “hybrid” hydrogels with a wide range of properties. For example, photocrosslinkable hydrogels are commonly prepared by UV-induced radical polymerization of reactive species containing double carbon-carbon bonded functional groups (e.g., vinyl, acrylic and methacrylic).[156,157] Secondary polymers containing those groups can readily undergo copolymerization to form hybrid hydrogels. For example, HA, a polysaccharide component of natural ECM, is made photocrosslinkable by conjugating methacrylated functional groups, and incorporated into PEG hydrogels.[158]\n\nRecently, more biocompatible and selective chemical reactions have been used to create hybrid hydrogels. For example, Lutolf and Hubbell first employed a Michael-type addition reaction to engineer hydrogels using thiol- and vinyl-functionalized PEG molecules ( ).[159] This thiol-based Michael reaction was especially useful to prepare hydrogels for biological applications as the reaction took place in physiological pH and buffers and in the absence of potentially toxic initiators.[135,160–162] Furthermore, “click” chemistry, which has gained recognition in recent years as a highly bio-orthogonal and facile reaction between alkyne and azide groups, has also been explored to fabricate hydrogels.[162–164] Especially, the biocompatibility of the click chemistry was achieved by the recent development of “copper-free” method (i.e., cycloaddition reaction between cyclooctyne and azide), which circumvented the use of cytotoxic copper catalyst ( ).[164,165] For example, DeForest et al. utilized the copper-free click chemistry to create PEG-polypeptide hybrid hydrogel ( ).[166] The reaction between tetraazide-functionalized 4-arm PEG and bis(difluorocyclooctyne)-functionalized polypeptide resulted in hydrogel formation under physiological conditions. The viability of cells encapsulated in the hydrogel was well maintained.[166]\n\nIPN and Semi-IPN Hydrogels\n\nIPNs date back to early 20th century, when Aylsworth first created IPN materials by introducing phenol-formaldehyde resins to natural rubber network.[167] The primary purpose for developing IPN has been to improve the fracture resistance of a material, which otherwise may be too weak or brittle.[168] It is well known that the IPN materials demonstrate enhanced mechanical toughness by efficiently transferring externally applied stress to the secondary polymer network.[98,168] The major distinction of IPN hydrogels from hybrid hydrogels is that the secondary polymers are not covalently conjugated to the hydrogel. Rather, the secondary polymers are placed within the hydrogel already formed, and then allowed to undergo polymerization to form the secondary polymer network. Therefore, the secondary network becomes interlocked within the hydrogel.[169] Semi-IPN hydrogel is another class of polymer-composite hydrogels, in which the secondary polymers are not crosslinked, but only “trapped” within the polymer network.[169]\n\nThe strategy of creating IPN hydrogel is continuously explored as a popular mode of structurally reinforcing hydrogels. For example, Gong et al. engineered IPN hydrogel with PAAm and poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS), which demonstrated extremely high tensile strength as compared with the single network of PAAM or PAMPS (i.e., 10 to 20 fold increase in fracture stress).[170] Sun et al. have recently reported similar findings, in which by introducing ionically crosslinked alginate network to PAAm network, the resulting IPN hydrogels showed significant stretchability.[100]\n\nThere are efforts to create IPNs in order to add different physical characteristics to the hydrogels, rather than focusing purely on the mechanical properties. For example, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) and PAAm networks are often incorporated to engineer IPN hydrogels with temperature- and pH-sensitivity, respectively.[171,172] In addition, Lin et al. introduced electrically conductive polyaniline (PANI) network to non-conductive PAAm hydrogel, and demonstrated that the resulting PANI/PAAm IPN hydrogel showed improved electrical field sensitivity as compared with PAAm hydrogel.[173]\n\n2.3.2. Nanocomposite Hydrogels\n\nWith the rapid development of nanotechnologies in recent years, extensive research efforts are being made to develop nanoparticles (NPs) for various biomedical applications.[174] NPs can be engineered from a variety of sources (e.g., polymers, minerals, metals, and semiconductors) and into different shapes (e.g., spheres, rods, shells, wires, and tubes).[174–176] In addition, chemical modification strategies are available to further modulate the properties of NPs.[177] Due to this diverse array of NPs with distinct physical and chemical properties, research efforts are being made to incorporate various types of NPs into hydrogel systems to create reinforced nanocomposite hydrogels.\n\nMineral NPs\n\nThe earliest attempt to reinforce materials with NPs was made by Usuki et al., who incorporated mont-morillonite, a type of natural silicate mineral (“clay”) NPs, into nylon-6.[178] The fabricated nanocomposites showed significant improvement in tensile strength.[178] Since then, various types of clay NPs have been used as prominent composite materials.[179] The inorganic clay NPs are often modified with polymers to render them hydrophilic, and therefore increase solubility and interaction with polymers.[180] The organic clay NPs are also being used to reinforce hydrogels. For example, Kokabi et al. engineered PVA hydrogel reinforced with organic-substituted clay NPs.[181] The resulting PVA-clay nanocomposite hydrogels showed enhanced tensile strength and diminished microbial penetration, while maintaining high water absorbency.[181]\n\nPolymeric NPs\n\nSynthetic polymeric NPs, such as dendrimers and micelles, which are widely used as drug delivery systems, have also been incorporated into hydrogels to utilize their drug releasing capability, as well as enhance their mechanical properties. In one study, Xiao et al. covalently incorporated micelles, made from self-assembly of block copolymers, in PAAm hydrogel.[182] Mechanical properties of the micelle-linked PAAm hydrogel could be controlled by the amount of micelles, in which 2-fold increase in tensile stress and 4-fold increase in Young’s modulus were observed when the micelle concentration was doubled, from 7.5 to 15 mg mL−1. In another study, Desai et al. developed a photocurable PEG hydrogel crosslinked with polyaminoamine dendrimers, and demonstrated cytocompatibility, controlled swelling and degradation by modification of dendrimers (i.e., chain length and charge density).[183]\n\nMetallic NPs\n\nWith increasing popularity of hydrogels in various areas of biomedical engineering, there is a growing need to engineer hydrogels with tunable properties (e.g., electrical and optical properties) to meet specific needs. Metallic NPs hold great promise as reinforcing elements to engineer composite hydrogels with unique characteristics, since they possess properties that are not commonly found in polymers or inorganic materials. For example, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are actively explored as biosensors, as they possess useful electronic and optical properties (e.g., quantized capacitance and surface plasmon resonance).[184] Pardo-Yisar et al. utilized a “breathing” mechanism to introduce AuNPs into hydrogels, in which PAAm hydrogel was first dehydrated by organic solvent, then followed by swelling in aqueous media containing AuNPs.[185] The resulting AuNP/PAAm composite hydrogels demonstrated significant increase in electrical conductivity. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are also well known for their unique antibacterial activity. Therefore, AgNP-incorporated hydrogels are currently being investigated for their use as antibacterial wound dressing.[186]\n\nMagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), such as iron oxide and gadolinium, are the most widely investigated class of metallic NPs for biomedical applications.[187,188] They have been mainly used as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with several products already commercially available.[187] Strategies of coating MNPs with hydrogels have been explored to increase their hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, as well as reduce non-specific protein adsorption. For example, Yi et al. utilized a sol-gel reaction to coat iron oxide MNPs with silica hydrogel.[189] Another interesting aspect of MNPs is their ability to produce heat under applied magnetic field (“magnetocaloric effect”).[190] Therefore, MNP-loaded hydrogels are currently being explored in hyperthermia-based cancer therapies (e.g., thermal ablation and temperature-sensitive drug delivery).[188,191,192] For example, Hoare et al. developed a composite film consisting of thermosensitive PNIPAm hydrogel and iron oxide MNPs.[193] They demonstrated that magnetic-induced hyperthermia from iron oxide MNPs caused the volumetric change of PNIPAm hydrogel, thereby inducing the release of cancer drugs ( ). In another study, Meenach et al. showed that magnetization of PEG-MNP composite hydrogels generated enough heat to kill glioblastoma cells.[194]\n\nCarbon-based NPs\n\nCarbon-based NPs (CBNs), such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, have gained worldwide popularity in recent years for their excellent multi-functional nature (i.e., mechanical strength, electrical, thermal, and optical conductivity). Therefore, extensive research efforts are under way to utilize their unique and favorable properties to create CBN-based composite materials for a variety of applications, including high-strength materials, nanoscale electronic circuitry, sensors, and actuators.[196–198] CBNs are also being investigated to reinforce hydrogels for biomedical applications. For example, Tong et al. demonstrated a twofold increase in tensile stress of PVA hydrogels by incorporating CNTs (0.05 wt%).[199] Similarly, Zhang et al. reported a 2-fold increase in tensile stress of PVA-graphene oxide (GO) composite hydrogel when GO was increased up to 0.8 wt%.[200]\n\nHydrogels commonly used in biomedical applications are not conductive towards thermal, optical and electrical stimuli, as they are made from non-conductive polymers. However, there is a growing need for conductive hydrogels to be used as biosensors, actuators and tissue engineering scaffolds. Therefore, CBNs are considered as highly promising materials to engineer conductive stimuli-responsive hydrogels. For example, Zhang et al. developed an electrical- and pH-responsive actuator based on graphene-PAAm composite hydrogel.[201] Shin et al. also demonstrated increased electrical conductivity of methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel by incorporating CNTs. The resulting CNT-GelMA composite hydrogel was successfully used as a tissue engineering scaffold to mediate enhanced electrophysiological function of CMs ( ).[195]\n\nOverall, as hydrogels have become a popular choice of materials used in several areas of bioengineering, strategies of encompassing various components to develop composite hydrogels with tunable properties are expected to be continuously explored. Traditionally, the composite strategies are often employed to engineer hydrogels with enhanced mechanical strength and function. Also, commonly used reinforcing materials have been mostly limited to polymers. However, more extensive research efforts are now being made to impart hydrogels with various properties (e.g., electrical and optical conductivity), with added emphasis on engineering multifunctional hydrogels to tailor to specific needs and complexities often required for present and future challenges. For this purpose, the recent advances in nanotechnology and development of various types of nanomaterials have made it possible to engineer nanocomposite hydrogels, which are likely to attain greater popularity than polymer-based composite hydrogels. This can be due to the fact that the nanomaterials often possess highly specialized and favorable functions that are not commonly found in polymers.\n\n2.4. Shape Memory and Self-Assembled Hydrogels\n\nShape memory hydrogels (SMHs) are a class of smart biomaterials with multiple shape capability. These hydrogels can vary their shapes when exposed to an external stimulus such as temperature or pH.[202–205] In this section, we review the fundamental mechanisms of shape memory hydrogel formation with their advantages and shortcomings. Particularly, we review the properties of hydrogels with stimuli-responsiveness, self-healing, and shape-memory characteristics. Finally, we point out applications of SMH in regenerative tissue-engineering strategies, particularly of those that are responsive to temperature changes with enhanced control-release and mechanical properties pertinent to biomedical applications and medical devices.[206]\n\nRepeating units such as macrobiomolecules, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids make up the basic building blocks in living organisms. In their native environment, these repeating units are responsible for directing various cellular functions such as morphogenesis, proliferation, migration, and metabolic activity.[207–209] These building blocks are stable at a broad range of temperature gradients but undergo biophysical changes when they are exposed to their thermal transition temperatures (TT), which trigger the reversible transition from a firm state to a softer, rubbery form. This non-linear and specific behavior happens due to cumulative cooperative interactions of the repeating units (e.g., macrobiomolecules, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids). That is, under alteration of temperature, the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions undergo conformational and structural changes. This physiological observation has been introduced artificially in biomaterial design strategies to stimulate a response in natural or synthetic polymers.[210–212]\n\nAmong the variables studied to modify the response of polymers and hydrogels, thermal stimulation is the one that causes the largest conformational and structural responses. SMHs are created when these conformational responses are reversible; this reversibility occurs via supramolecular bonds formed by hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, π–π interactions, or metal complexes. These interactions serve to build up network chains from non-covalent interactions between monomers, or non-covalently associate polymer chains together.[213–215] The non-covalent bonds can be combined in different ways to produce SMH networks with adaptable wettability,[216] swelling capability,[217] permeability,[218,219] and sol-gel transition properties.[220] Merging transient, reversible, non-covalent physical bonds with stable chemical bonds is a feature of SMHs that arises during its mechanism of formation.\n\nThe mechanism of SMH formation can be described as follows. When reversible supramolecular crosslinks and permanent covalent crosslinks are heated to a critical TT, the physical crosslinks dissociate, the network deforms, and only the permanent covalent crosslinks are responsible for an elastic response.[221] Decreasing the temperature below TT causes association of the physical molecular crosslinks; thus, deforming the hydrogel and locking it. Raising the temperature again above TT dissociates the physical molecular crosslinks, releasing stored elastic energy of the permanent crosslinks, and restoring the hydrogel back to its original shape ( ).[222]\n\nAs mentioned above, one important advantage of SMHs is that they rely on the synergistic interplay between networks forming chemical and physical connections.[223] Chemical networks are connected together by covalent chemical bonds; physical networks on the other hand, are connected by transient non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions). Both chemical and physical crosslinks have advantages and disadvantages. Chemical networks are strong and can be considered permanent. This feature is important for applications that require tough and highly connected networks, but may be detrimental if the hydrogel has to be reprocessed or recycled. On the other hand, the reversibility physical crosslinked networks greatly enhance reprocessing and recycling capabilities. Nonetheless, physical crosslinks are hard to customize, and their applications are specific to polyelectrolyte or biopolymer systems.[213] The combination of these chemical and physical crosslinks offers several advantages to SMHs. First, the reversibility of the physical crosslinked networks in SMHs enable their utilization as sensors,[224] actuators,[225–228] and controlled release platforms.[229] Second, SMHs exhibit self-healing properties;[221] when the network is ruptured, unassociated molecular bonds display a tendency to re-associate if they are brought into close proximity with each other. Third, the SMHs are customizable as they can form strong materials under favorable conditions, but easily de-coupled or de-crosslinked when exposed to temperatures below their TT. Forth, SMHs can be considered as composite hydrogels combining polymers and nanoparticles with specific “memory” characteristics. The detailed chemistry and characteristics of these composite hydrogels have been previously described in Section 2.3.\n\nTemperature-responsive SMHs present promise as delivery vehicles of multiple bioactive molecules or growth factors due to their unique self-healing properties.[230–232] Once the SMH is stimulated, it can modify its shape and selectively attract or release a pre-determined set of biomolecules. For example, Ozadin-Ince et al. developed a coaxial nanofilm with a hydrogel core and a p(tert-butyl acrylate-co-diethylene glycol divinyl ether) shape memory shell to form temperature activated nanotubes using vapor phase deposition.[233] The temperature response of the coaxial nanofilm was then studied through release of encapsulated fluorescent dye. Burst release of fluorescent dye (fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide, FTSC) occurred due to the stress applied by the shape memory outer layer when activated at elevated temperatures.[233]\n\nTemperature-responsive SMHs have also been used as smart hydrogels for cell and growth factor encapsulation. For example, Wang et al. developed a biodegradable, partially crosslinked alginate hydrogel with shape-memory properties at body temperature for minimally invasive surgical applications.[234] In this paper, 90% of recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that was encapsulated in these hydrogels was released over several days in vitro, allowing skeletal muscle cell survival, proliferation, and migration within the scaffold over a 28-day period. In another study, a temperature-sensitive hydrogel composed of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanosulfonic acid (AMPS), NIPAm, and acrylamide (AAm) was synthesized to selectively bind proteins from serum samples.[224] The AMPS was chosen as a protein complex monomer based on the affinity of sulfonic acid groups to amide groups of bovine serum albumin (BSA). In addition, NIPAm was introduced as a temperature-sensitive material to bind and release BSA upon temperature changes. The shape-memory properties of the fabricated hydrogel combined with charge interactions enabled selectively reorganization and adsorption of BSA from a real serum sample.[224]\n\nA near-infrared light responsive polymer-nanorod composite with a TT in the range of body temperature was also employed for the control-release of anti-cancerous drugs such as doxorubicin.[227] In vitro studies on these composite microspheres demonstrated a ~90% reduction in the activity of cancerous T6–17 cells when the release of doxorubicin was triggered from microspheres exposed to near-infrared light. Due to their high surface area, the microspheres facilitated cumulative release of drug;[227] however their applicability for clinical application such as cancer treatment remains to be proven.\n\nInjectable Smart Hydrogels\n\nRecently, SMHs with tunable mechanical characteristics have shown promise as injectable hydrogels. For example, Bencherif et al. developed injectable macroporous alginate scaffolds with well-defined shape-memory properties ( ).[235] These injectable hydrogels were highly compressible and could withstand reversible deformations up to 90% strain upon in vivo injection by a using conventional needle–syringe technique. Moreover, the fabricated hydrogels were employed as a delivery vehicle for biomolecules such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) as well as cells. Recently, shear-thinning hydrogels have been also proposed as injectable biomaterials at physiological conditions.[236,237] These hydrogels can be injected by application of shear stress during injection and quickly self-heal after removal of shear. In one study, shear-thinning hydrogels were made from small peptides and used to improve the immune response of H1N1 influenza vaccines.[238]\n\nSMHs with Enhanced Mechanical Properties\n\nTemperature-responsive SMHs nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical properties have also been investigated. For example, a reinforced SHM was produced by introducing reinforcing networks of cellulose whiskers (CCW) isolated from cotton into poly(vinyl acetate).[240] Upon immersion in artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 37 °C, the nanocomposites showed an adaptable change in elastic modulus, which made them suitable substrates for intracortical electrodes.[240]\n\nIn another study, highly stretchable SMHs were produced by covalently crosslinking quad-polymers of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA), 2-(N-ethylperfluoro-octanesulfonamido) ethyl methacrylate (FOSM), hydroxyethyl acrylate, and 2-cinnamoyl-oxyethyl acrylate ( ).[239] These hybrid hydrogels, containing physical and covalent crosslinks, exhibited high mechanical strength, elasticity, extensibility, and fracture toughness, with potential applications for ligament or tendon repair.[241] Anthamatten et al. also synthesized copolymers of methyl acrylate (MA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and iso-bornyl acrylate (IBoA) by adjusting their TT between 28 °C and 55 °C to form highly stretchable SMHs.[242] The developed materials demonstrated fully recoverable strains at 807% for a TT of 28 °C, at 663% for a TT of 37 °C, and at 553% for a TT of 55 °C. Due to their recoverable high-strain, these SMHs may be useful as cardiac patches or synthetic blood vessels.\n\nVarious temperature-responsive SMHs have been explored in the medical devices industry with applications in aneurysm treatment,[243] blood clot removal,[244] stents,[245,246] and dialysis needles.[247] Lately, there have been examples of temperature-responsive polymers with promising clinical applications in minimally invasive gastrointestinal surgery.[248] Minimally invasive surgeries can benefit from devices that can change their geometry or shape when placed inside the body. For example, Kratz et al. utilized thermoplastic temperature-responsive polymers for designing intelligent devices, which could be programmed by the clinician to individually adapt their shifting geometry and response temperature to the patients’ needs.[248] In this study, multiblock copolymers were synthesized from biocompatible poly(ω-pentadecalactone), as the hard backbone, and PCL as the crystallizable controlling unit. This polymer network was then used to develop an intelligent temperature-responsive drainage pigtail catheter for gastroenterology applications.[248]\n\nOverall, SMHs hold promise as robust biomedical platforms that can be rationally designed since their structure is controlled by reversible crosslinks. Once created, they can be reversibly disassembled, as their hybrid structures could spontaneously reassemble in one, two or multiple steps. Fundamental research in the area of temperature-responsive SMHs aims to develop materials that can be either light-stimulated remotely or highly compressible to be injected via minimally invasive surgeries. SMHs could also envisioned to be triggered by pH[249] or by shear stress.[250] Therefore, in the future, there may be opportunities for the use of biodegradable and biocompatible medical devices made from SMHs to perform complex movements in the fields of cardiovascular surgery or gastroenterology.\n\n3. Emerging Technologies for Engineering Hydrogel Constructs\n\nHydrogel constructs with controllable architectural features, at the micro- and nanoscale, have been shown to be useful in directing cell behavior, tissue formation and may be powerful tools for tissue engineering applications. Over the past decades, many research groups have tried to adopt techniques from various engineering fields for the fabrication of hydrogel constructs with controlled architecture.[251–256] However, factors such as low mechanical properties of hydrogels as well as the biocompatibility of the employed chemicals and the fabrication process, should be considered in utilization of these methods. Here, we review the emerging techniques, which can be used to control the geometrical features as well as the distribution of cells and biomolecules within fabricated hydrogel constructs.\n\n3.1. Microfabrication\n\n3.1.1. Photopatterning\n\nPhotolithography, or photopatterning, is one of the techniques that has found popularity in the creation of microfabricated hydrogels.[252] This approach was originally developed for the fabrication of micron-sized features for micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) applications. In photopatterning, a mask is first created, which contains the pattern to be implemented. Certain areas of the mask are kept transparent allowing the light to pass and certain areas are opaque, blocking the light. Upon light irradiation, the hydrogel areas corresponding to the transparent regions of the mask are crosslinked to form the micropatterns, whereas the remaining uncrosslinked parts (under the opaque parts of the mask) are washed out in the washing step.[256] As expected, this photopatterning technique is only applicable to microfabricate photocrosslinkable hydrogels. Recently, researchers have conjugated acrylamide- or acrylate-based groups to prepolymer backbone, which make these hydrogels photocrosslinkable. Some examples of these hydrogels include PEG diacrylate (PEGDA),[257,258] PEG-dimethacrylates (PEGDM),[259] GelMA,[260] gelatin methacrylamid,[261] methacrylated HA,[262] and MeTro.[13,263] To form a polymerized network, a photoinitiator is usually used which forms free radicals upon light irradiation and initiates the polymerization reaction.\n\nDuring the photopatterning process, the entire thickness of the hydrogel layer is usually crosslinked with no control over the crosslinking depth. The resolution of the features depends on the quality of the employed photomask and the illumination system. However, a resolution down to few microns is readily achievable. Another important property that can limit the dimensions of the microfabricated hydrogel constructs is their aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio between their height and width). Since hydrogels are not usually mechanically strong, high aspect ratio features may collapse.\n\nPhotopatterning is a versatile technique and allows precise spatial control over the cellular microenvironment. In addition, it allows the fabrication of 3D cell-laden constructs or patterning of different cells through sequential photopatterning of hydrogels containing various cell types. In a notable study, Tsang et al. photopatterned complex 3D structures by successive crosslinking of PEGDA containing different chemicals using three different photomasks ( ).[257] In addition, they encapsulated primary hepatocytes as a model for liver-on-a-chip research. To control the height of the constructs, the height of the reservoir was changed by means of removable spacers. Cells stayed viable after the fabrication and showed a higher albumin and urea secretion in comparison with unpatterned cells.[257] In another study, Nichol et al. fabricated low aspect ratio HUVEC-laden GelMA constructs through UV crosslinking of the hydrogel and showed high cell viability after the fabrication process.[260] They characterized the hydrogel properties as a function of the UV exposure time and noticed that the mechanical properties were directly related to the UV exposure time and methacrylation degree. In a follow up study, Aubin et al. fabricated lines of cell-laden GelMA hydrogels with different widths and demonstrated that the widths of the patterned lines had a significant impact on the morphology of the cells.[128] Using a similar approach, biomolecules were patterned within photocrosslinkable hydrogels[264] or spatial patterns with different mechanical properties were created.[265] Such patterns can be used to direct cellular activity, migration, and differentiation, which will be further discussed in the following sections.\n\nPhotodegradable hydrogels can also be used for the fabrication of microscale features within hydrogel constructs. For example, Wong et al. formed a photodegradable hydrogel through conjugating photodegradable ortho-nitrobenzyl (o-NB) groups to PEG.[132] They used photomasks to fabricate microchannels and microwells within the fabricated hydrogels. In addition, they could locally adjust the swelling properties of photodegradable hydrogels. As a result, the photodegraded area was swollen and formed a 3D microstructure ( ). In another study, Chiu et al. sandwiched a layer of photodegradable PEG-co(L-lactide) diacrylate (PEG-PLLA-DA) between layers of PEGDA.[266] A photomask was then used to selectively irradiate UV light to degrade a pattern within PEG-PLLA-DA layer. Upon the exposure of the construct to high pH conditions, the photopatterned regions were dissolved quickly and 3D microchannels were formed.[266] One of the limitations of this technique is the inability to encapsulate cells within the fabricated construct due to the use of a basic environment.\n\nPhotopatterning technique is easy-to-use and does not require sophisticated equipment. For photopatterning of hydrogel constructs, one needs a light source, a photo mask, and a photocrosslinkable hydrogel mixed with a photoinitiator. However, a key challenge is determining the suitable UV exposure time. Longer exposure times are found to affect cellular viability and activity or potentially might result in phenotype variation. Another limitation of this method is the fabrication of only planar constructs. Moreover, controlling cell distribution requires the use of multiple photomasks, which is challenging due to the need to align the photopatterns with the masks before each exposure.\n\n3.1.2. Soft Lithography and Molding\n\nSoft lithography and molding have been widely used in the creation of microfabricated hydrogel constructs.[267] Molds can be fabricated from various materials including plastics, polymers, and metals. However, elastomers such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) have found more popularity.[256] This is due to their ease of microfabrication, biocompatibility, and hydrophobic surface property, which helps the detachment of crosslinked hydrogels from the mold. In addition, coating the mold with temperature responsive hydrogels, such as PNIPAm, have been shown to facilitate hydrogel removal from the mold.[268] Molding has been used for the fabrication of both physically and chemically crosslinkable hydrogels. The fabrication of 3D constructs using molding can be achieved by independent fabrication of multiple layers and their subsequent assembly.\n\nHe et al. employed a microreplication method followed by a molding process to fabricate biomimetic perfusable microvascular networks.[269] They digested the soft tissue of a leaf and sputtered its veins with a layer of chrome. The sputtered leaf was used as a photomask in a soft lithography process to fabricate a negative PDMS mold, which was then utilized for the fabrication of agarose hydrogels ( ). Collagen solution containing ECs was injected within the patterned microchannels. In addition, HepG2 cells were encapsulated within the agarose hydrogel to form a liver-like structure containing perfusable channels. The in vitro results indicated that the presence of the microvascular network resulted in high cellular viability over 3 days of culture.[269] Zheng et al. fabricated microvessel networks within 3D collagen gel by using an injection technique ( ).[270] They encapsulated human umbilical arterial smooth muscle cells (HUASMCs) as well as human brain vascular pericytes (HBVPCs) within the collagen layer. The channels were also seeded with HUVECs to form functional microvessels. The hydrogel constructs were then cultured for 14 days to study the effects of cell-cell interactions on angiogenesis and sprouting. They observed that HUVECs tend to form cylindrical lumens within the channels. Our groups also used micromolding technique to form microchannels within PDMS samples and used them as molds for fabricating grooved MeTro and GelMA hydrogels.[56] The fabricated constructs were then used to align CMs within the fabricated micropatterns.\n\nAnother emerging application of the molding techniques is the fabrication of 3D pre-vascularized hydrogel constructs.[271] In this method, a 3D mold of sacrificial fibers is first fabricated and subsequently covered by a hydrogel layer. The sacrificial fibers are then removed from the construct to engineer vascular network.[271] Researchers have used various sacrificial fibers including glass carbohydrate, shellac, gelatin, and metallic needles.[272–275] For example, Golden and Tien formed a gelatin mesh using micromolding and then embedded it as a mold within collagen and fibrin hydrogels.[275] Gelatin mold was then melted away leaving behind perfusable channels, which were seeded with ECs to form functional microvessels.\n\nMicromolding and soft lithography are robust and easy-to-use technologies. Complex structures can be created through layer-by-layer fabrication followed by an assembly step. Molding is also rapid, biocompatible, and scalable. However, these techniques are limited to planar structures and the fabrication of 3D biomimetic geometries such as vessels or veins is challenging. To address this limitation, combination of molding and rapid prototyping strategies could be the next step for the formation of microfabricated complex 3D hydrogels. Moreover, hydrogels that crosslink chemically or through ion transfer such as alginate deform during the molding process; thus strategies that preserve the shape of the hydrogel during its crosslinking are essential.\n\n3.1.3. Rapid Prototyping\n\nRapid prototyping is an additive-based fabrication technique in which materials or energy is sequentially delivered to form a construct. Rapid prototyping systems are automated and the construct is previously designed using a CAD software or through reconstruction of a geometry from images (MRI, CT, and X-ray).[276] The CAD files are then converted to a standard tessellation language (STL) format, which describes the actual surfaces by raw unstructured triangulated surfaces. The STL files are then converted to sliced models, which are fabricated using the machine through an additive process.[253] In this section, latest advances in the use of laser-based systems will be discussed. The nozzle-based and bioprinting devices will be introduced in the following sections.\n\nIn laser-based systems, the beam can only crosslink the hydrogel on the focal plane and the rest of the hydrogel will stay uncrosslinked. As expected, this technique is only applicable to photocrosslinkable hydrogels. The major difference of laser based systems from the mask-based systems is that in the former no physical mask is used and light illumination is not powerful enough to crosslink the complete depth of the hydrogel.[277]\n\nStereolithography (SLA) is one of the oldest laser-based rapid prototyping strategies.[278] In this approach, 3D constructs are fabricated in a layer-by-layer fashion.[261] The machine follows the sliced model and hydrogel on the focal plane is crosslinked through irradiation in a point by point format. Once all the points on a layer are crosslinked, the focal plane changes and the next layer is fabricated. This method is used to fabricate complex 3D constructs with high resolution. Since the whole area should be swept for each focal plane, SLA is a slow process, which is not favorable for cell encapsulation.\n\nTo increase the speed of the fabrication process, researchers have developed a digital light projection (DLP) technology, in which the whole pattern on the focal plane is crosslinked simultaneously.[279] In this method, a digital micro-mirror device or a liquid-crystal display (LCD) can be used to project a dynamic pattern.[280] Gauvin et al. employed a digital micro array system to pattern 3D scaffolds from GelMA in a layer-by-layer fashion ( ).[281] By programming the system, they were able to control the microstructure of the fabricated scaffolds and consequently tune their mechanical properties. In vitro studies showed that the fabricated scaffolds with 1 mm thickness supported the viability and proliferation of HUVECs during 7 days of culture.\n\nAnother alternative to SLA is the two photon polymerization (2PP), which is an emerging technology for fabricating 3D hydrogel structures.[283] In 2PP, two laser pulses with high wavelengths are irradiated, which act as a single pulse with a low wavelength at the intersection point to excite the PI and crosslink the hydrogel.[252] As a result, in contrast with SLA systems, which possess a focal plane, 2PP systems have a focal spot. In general, the accuracy of 2PP is higher than SLA.[284] Moreover, 2PP systems can be used to fabricate 3D biomimetic structures such as microvessels, which mimic the vasculature in native tissues. Recently, Laza et al. developed an advanced form of 2PP combined with continuous flow of the prepolymers.[282] Using this approach, they were able to fabricate 3D objects such as helix-shaped constructs from PEGDA gels[282] ( ). In another study, Ovsianikov et al. demonstrated the capability of 2PP systems for grafting biomolecules to PEG-based hydrogels.[285] The absorption of laser energy by the 2,6-bis(4-azidobenzylidene)-4-methylcyclohexanone (BAC-M) triggered chemical reactions, which resulted in the grafting of the targeted molecule to the backbone polymer. Their technique enabled formation of high resolution (4 μm) complex 3D structures. Moreover, the intensity of the emitted laser and the scanning speed had a direct relationship with the concentration of grafted molecules.[285] A multiphoton system was also used to create patterns of various biomolecules in an aga-rose-based hydrogel modified with coumarin-caged thiols.[264] Neural precursor cells were then seeded on the surface of hydrogels containing gradients of various growth factors to monitor cellular migration over 14 days of culture. It was shown that cells responded to the 3D patterns to a depth of 85 μm.[264]\n\nLaser-based rapid prototyping devices enable the fabrication of 3D constructs in an automated fashion. Moreover, these systems offer high precision and resolution in comparison with photomask-based counterparts. However, the major challenge is their high capital and operating costs, which has limited their use to a few research labs. Moreover, operating systems based on SLA and 2PP are relatively slow, which makes cellular encapsulation challenging.\n\n3.2. Bioprinting\n\nDespite major advances, clinically relevant 3D engineered tissues have not been fabricated, due to our inability to recreate tissue architecture and function.[286,287] Thus, the development of technologies that enable the fabrication of complex multicellular tissue constructs can aid in addressing this challenge.[286] Overall, bioprinting of hydrogels at precise 3D architectural arrangements represents a powerful approach for engineering biomimetic tissue constructs.[288]\n\nBioprinting techniques originate from additive manufacturing approach, where the sequential deposition of solid layers allows for the precise development of complex structures. In engineering bioprinted tissues, cells can be either embedded within biologically relevant hydrogels or printed free of scaffold support.[288] Bioprinting techniques enable rapid printing of micro- and macro-scale 3D structures with high cell viability.[288–291] A wide variety of bioprinting systems have been developed to engineer and control the design and architectures of 3D hydrogels.[289,290,292,293] In the following sections, we will briefly describe relevant bioprinting methods and highlight potential developments in the future prospects for bioprinting in regenerative medicine.\n\n3.2.1. Inkjet Bioprinting\n\nEfforts to utilize inkjet printers as tools to dispense cells and biological materials were initially reported in the 1980s. In an early study, Klebe used a common Hewlett-Packard desktop printer to deposit both collagen and fibronectin suspensions with cells, thus forming simplified tissue analogs.[294] In inkjet bioprinting, a container, analog to ink cartridges, dispenses drops in the range of 1 to 100 pl via heating and vaporizing, while either a bubble or a piezoelectric actuator forces out the liquid drop.[293] In these systems, pressure waves are generated by a pulse behind an orifice; subsequently, droplet ejection occurs when the wave overcomes the liquid-vapor interfacial tension. These systems were primarily developed to be used with low viscosity and well-dispersed inks, such as cell suspensions. To print high viscosity solutions, such as hydrogels, recently, researchers have intensively attempted to modify inkjet bioprinting systems. One improvement is the development of nozzle-free acoustic ejectors, whereby an X-Y-Z stage is controlled by a computer and synchronized with a pulse generator programmed to build 3D layers.[293] The use of a synchronized opening and closing of a micrometer sized valve orifice in these bioprinters prevents clogging during droplet generation. These systems were successfully utilized to study stem cell genomics, via a method called drop-on-demand single cell isolation.[295] Similarly, an inkjet bioprinting method was used to replace a manual pipetting step for the formation of uniform-sized embryoid bodies.[296] In one study, an array of fibrin gels containing gradients of immobilized growth factors were bioprinted to guide stem cells migration over extended time (>1 day) and length scales (>1 mm).[297] Fibronectin and gelatin gels were also printed by using an inkjet bioprinter to form 3D tissue arrays.[298] In this study, 440 microarrays of simplified 3D structures were fabricated retaining micrometer-sized multilayers with different cell types. This platform was utilized to study the role of co-cultures of HUVECs and liver hepatocellular cells (HepG2) on liver-specific biomarkers, as well as on drug metabolism ( ). The combination of bioprinting with other widespread fabrication technologies, such as electrospinning, has also attracted significant attention. For example, in a recent report, an inkjet printer set-up was mounted directly adjacent to an electrospinning device, allowing for the alternate fabrication of a layer of electrospun PCL and another layer of chondrocyte-laden fibrin/collagen hydrogel.[299] This integrated platform supported the formation of cartilage tissue both in vivo and in vitro.[299]\n\nGenerally, inkjet printers are widely used in the fabrication of many devices, from light-emitting diodes to full-color high-resolution flat panel displays.[302] An interesting field that has emerged recently is the utilization of inkjet printers as tools for fabricating biochemical sensing devices. In the fabrication of these biosensors, inkjet printers are utilized to form electrically conducting traces (e.g., electrode, and electric contact) or sensing layers (e.g., polymer film, enzyme or antibody spot, and colorimetric reagent.). All these technologies are profited from developments achieved in printed electronics.[303] The integration of printed electronic with elastomeric stretchable organic fibers can give rise to exciting possibilities in the field of implantable hydrogel-based electronics. We foresee that this may lead to important advances in regenerative medicine towards bionic implants integrating bioprinting, biosensors and advanced biomaterials.[304,305]\n\n3.2.2. Laser-Assisted Bioprinting\n\nIn common laser-guided bioprinters, a laser-induced forward-transfer (LIFT) technique transfers a biological material from a source film onto a non-absorbing surface in close proximity to the film.[292,306] Depending on the rheological properties of liquid films and the thickness of the metallic absorbing layer, printing is obtained through a jet formation, occurring above a laser energy limit. The requirement for a high-energy transfer system, however, has been associated with a decrease in cell survival after deposition.[307] One of the recent potential applications of LIFT technique is the fabrication of cardiac-patches made of polyester urethane urea (PEUU) treated with Matrigel.[308] During the fabrication of these patches, a laser printer was utilized to pattern a co-culture of HUVECs and human MSCs at precise regions ( ). In vitro results demonstrated the possibility of creating vascular micropatterns, which could be arranged in parallel, thus leading to organized cell-cell interactions and formation of a vascular-like network. After implantation in infarcted rats, the bioprinted patches showed significant improvements in cardiac function when compared to a non-printed control.[308] Biological laser printing (BioLP), derived from the LIFT technique, was also utilized to study the formation of microvascular systems in hydrogel treated substrates.[309] In this approach, a laser bioprinter with improved resolution (approximately 30 μm) was utilized to deposit HUVECs on the surface of Matrigel loaded PLGA based biopapers.[309] Results demonstrated a high fidelity of the cells onto the pre-defined patterns. Similarly, in a recent study, 3D multilayered constructs made of fibroblasts and keratinocytes encapsulated in alginate hydrogels were bioprinted. The fabricated constructs demonstrated high structural biomimicry resembling the microarchitecture of human skin.[310,311]\n\n3.2.3. Direct-Write Bioprinting\n\nDirect-write bioprinting has been also widely utilized in the biomedical field given the inexpensive character of manufacturing devices and the relative straightforward principle behind the associated fabrication methods. Direct-write printing generally functions with pressure-driven extrusion methods (via air or mechanical pressure) of pre-cured hydrogels, cell-laden hydrogels or mature cell-aggregate filaments.[290] In principle, a syringe, generally connected to a pump and mounted onto an X-Y-Z stage, allows for controlled deposition of 3D layers or lines containing cells or bioactive materials. To form vasculature, direct-write printers were also integrated with a thin capillary tube with a metallic piston in its center. The piston assisted with the aspiration of a pre-polymer gel and then mechanically extruded it after polymerization.[312] This technique was also employed to bioprint scaffold-free cell aggregates.[313] Due to their ability in prototyping micro- to macro-scale tissue constructs, direct-write printers have been used as a promising alternative to laser and inkjet methods, which tend to dispense much lower volumes of material at a time.\n\nDirect-write 3D printers have also promoted exciting alternatives in tissue engineering. For instance, by controlling the 3D microarchitectures of hydrogels constituted of HEMA absorbed with polylysine, researchers have been able to guide proliferation and alignment of primary rat hippocampal neurons depending on scaffold architecture[300] ( ). In another example, 3D silk/hydroxyapatite scaffolds were bioprinted with gradient porosity ranging from 200 μm to 750 μm. The scaffolds were then co-cultured with human MSCs and ECs, leading to new tissue formation and bone remodeling.[314] Photopolymerizable thermosensitive p(HPMAm-lactate)-PEG hydrogels were also developed to fabricate complex 3D constructs with tunable mechanical properties.[315]\n\nDirect write printers have also offered exciting prospects in the fabrication of functional and perfusable microvascular networks;[271,316–319] these approaches will be discussed in greater detail in Section 4.1. Similar to the combination of inkjet printing of conductive inks described above, direct write printers have also brought about yet another level of complexity and functionality towards the integration of bionic parts with tissue engineering constructs. This method was recently utilized to fabricate electric antennas on 3D surfaces,[320] optical waveguides,[321] stretchable microelectrodes,[322,323] and conductive grids.[324] Direct write 3D printing technologies has potential to be used for the fabrication of body parts and electronic devices, which brings forth outstanding possibilities in the field of biomedical engineering. Whole 3D body parts integrated with electrically conductive materials have been recently engineered.[301] In this recent work, Mannoor et al. reported the 3D fabrication via direct-write printing of a cell-seeded alginate hydrogel in the anatomic geometry of a human ear integrated to an cochlea shaped electrically silver-nanoparticle infused silicone antenna.[301]\n\n3.3. Microfluidics\n\nMicrofluidic technologies are being increasingly applied to various tissue engineering and biological applications. For instance, microfluidic systems have been used for single cell analysis,[325,326] engineering tissue-like structures,[263,327] and fabricating functional tissues for drug screening.[328] Microfluidic technologies offer an attractive strategy, in particular, for creating functional microengineered hydrogels (microgels and microfibers) with 3D morphologies and configurable chemistries. As discussed in the previous sections, these microgels may be used as tissue building blocks, which can be assembled to form complex 3D tissue engineered constructs.[329] Microfluidic technologies have been used to fabricate microgels in the shape of spheres,[330] disks,[331] hemispheres,[332] core–shell structures,[332] Janus-like particles,[333] and fibers[334] by using flow focusing,[335] T-junction geometries,[336] and co-flowing of laminar streams.[337] In addition, microfluidic techniques can be combined with projection-photolithography, which was previously used for particle manipulation,[338,339] to create microgels with more complex geometries and tunable chemical compositions.\n\nThis section aims to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the use of various microfluidic systems for the fabrication of engineered microgels and microfibers. We mainly focus on emulsion-based techniques with particular emphasis on co-flow, flow focusing, flow lithography systems, and fiber-spinning techniques. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and highlight their emerging applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.\n\n3.3.1. Emulsion-Based Systems\n\nEmulsion is a process whereby small particles are formed by dispersing one liquid into an immiscible solution. Microfluidic systems can be used to produce highly monodisperse emulsions by precisely fabricating one drop at a time. The size and chemical composition of the resulting droplets can be manipulated by controlling the flow rates and concentrations of different chemicals in each stream. Microfluidic technologies also enable the fabrication of double, and higher-order emulsions with an exquisite degree of control. Single and multi emulsions are generally produced by co-flow, flow focusing, or a combination of two systems ( ).[337,340]. These systems can be simply created by using glass capillaries[337] or micromachining techniques such as micromolding in PDMS.[341] By combining hydrodynamics and in situ crosslinking (photo or chemical), microgels can be generated in a continuous and cost-effective manner.\n\nMicrogels can be formed from hydrogel materials using emulsion-based microfluidic techniques for tissue engineering applications. In one study, Matsunaga et al. used the flow focusing method to create monodispersed collagen spherical microgels with tunable diameters in the range of 50 to 300 μm.[343] They cultured various types of cells including NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, HepG2 cells, HUVECs, primary neurons, primary rat hepatocytes, and MIN6 pancreatic cells on the collagen beads and showed that the cells attached to the surface of the bead in less than 2 hours. To form a macroscopic 3D tissue construct, a modular approach was used to induce NIH 3T3-seeded beads to morph into a body-shaped figure inside a PDMS mold ( ). Results showed that the beads formed strong constructs after 17 hours, indicating that robust tissue constructs can be formed using this rapid fabrication method.[343]\n\nMicrofluidic technologies also enable the fabrication of microparticles containing multiple biochemical functions ( ). For example, Shepherd et al. devised a microfluidic system to form microgels of varying shapes and compositions.[345] They first created droplets with different chemical compositions by focusing two laminar streams in a continuous oil phase sheath-flow. These droplets were subsequently crosslinked in situ to form Janus-like microgels. These particles are of interest in tissue engineering as they are asymmetric and thus can be used to better mimic the mechanical and chemical anisotropy of native tissues.[345]\n\nWhile creating particles using emulsion-based microfluidics is a promising approach for creating tissue constructs, there are still several challenges that remain to be addressed. Since surface tension effects play a key role in particle formation, only particles with limited shapes can be created. Moreover, using emulsion-based microfluidics requires phase-separating chemistries (immiscible fluids) and stabilization techniques that are generally toxic to the cells. One possible approach could be the formation of particles using coaxial flow of two miscible fluids in microchannels under dripping regime.[346] In this method, droplets are formed due to the break-up of a liquid jet formed by a coaxial stream of core fluid in a sheath flow. These droplets can be subsequently crosslinked downstream of the flow using photopolymerization. Moreover, to prevent the formation of harmful radicals during the crosslinking process, other methods such as radical- and catalyst-free, bio-orthogonal click reactions can be used.[347]\n\n3.3.2. Flow Lithography\n\nFlow lithography combines the advantages of photolithography and microfluidics to create microgels with complex morphologies and chemical compositions ( ).[348] These methods are divided into continuous flow lithography (CFL) and stop flow lithography (SFL). In CFL, microgels are formed by exposing a stream of flowing acrylic oligomer in a PDMS microchannel to pulses of mask-defined UV light. Portions of the oligomer that are exposed to the UV light are crosslinked almost instantaneously to form well-defined solid structures. These structures are then carried away by the continuously flowing polymer precursor liquid that surrounds them.\n\nCFL has certain advantages over the emulsion-based approach. This process only requires the use of one phase, which eliminates the challenges associated with optimizing device surface chemistry required in two-phase flows. Moreover, Janus-like particles with different chemical properties are fabricated by using polymeric precursors with varying chemical properties. In addition, CFL enables high throughput fabrication of microgels with complex morphologies, which are formed by projecting different shapes with rates as high as 100 particles per second[331] ( ). However, the use of CFL for tissue engineering is limited, as it requires high concentrations of monomer or photoinitiator, which are toxic to cells. Moreover, CFL is restricted to low flow rates because the particles are synthesized in flow and exposed to finite pulses of UV light. To address these limitations, Panda et al. developed a SFL method to synthesize large numbers of cell encapsulated hydrogels in a continuous format ( ).[349] The SFL process included three steps: i) stopping the liquid flow, ii) polymerizing the patterned solution, and iii) flowing the particles out of the device.[350] Using SFL process, mouse fibroblast cells wer"
