        "text": "Mr. Sian Schumacher (Palliser):\n\nMr. Speaker, in rising to participate in the debate on second reading of Bill C-120 I want first to protest against the false and misleading reporting of this stage of the legislative process by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It was stated on the C.B.C. news program, \"The World At Eight\", on Friday morning that this measure could perhaps receive approval in principle by second reading later that day, and I understand that this statement was repeated again this morning. I also noticed that this morning's issue of the Globe and Mail, I believe under Mr. Seale's by-line, also repeated this misinformation. After almost five months of operation under the new rules, surely the persons reporting the proceedings of this house should know that second reading merely allows the referral of legislation to a committee and nothing else. However, in view of the fact that most members of the newspaper editors' fraternity in Canada appear to consider this debate to be almost totally unnewsworthy, perhaps one should be thankful that at least the people's broadcasting system deigns to mention it more or less in passing if only in an inaccurate way.\n\nI should first like to deal with some of the most glaring trouble spots in the bill. The first of these is clause 13 (1) which says that a bilingual district may vary in size between a census district and a school district. The important thing to note here is that census districts are established by the Governor in Council and therefore can be quite variable in themselves. It seems to me that this bill has been presented to the public on the basis that bilingual districts will roughly correspond to the boundaries of federal electoral divisions even though it has been represented that British Columbia will have no bilingual districts and there would only be a few in the prairie provinces and Atlantic Canada excluding, of course, New Brunswick.\n\nOfficial Languages\n\nOne could also ask what is the necessity of the establishment of bilingual districts at all in view of the proposed amendments to clause 9. The difficulty here, of course, is in the words \"significant demand\" because this is another area that is totally subjective so far as the administration of this bill is concerned. It is in the area of administration that the real troubles will arise because, as has already been pointed out by the hon. member for Cardigan (Mr. McQuaid), the bill is in large part a purely administrative one and, apart from the clauses dealing with the administration of justice, does not give the federal government any new powers.\n\nMany Canadians are already objecting to and are fearful of the emphasis being placed on bilingualism in the public service. One has only to refer to the comments of the hon. member for Ottawa West (Mr. Francis) for confirmation of this. It is my feeling that this bill will merely increase the emphasis rather than modify it or put it on a more rational and functional basis. I say this because I believe in bilingualism in the public service of Canada on a functional basis, but not in a totally bilingualized civil service. After all, what is the aim? I have always thought the aim to be that service should be provided in both languages. This does not mean that everyone must know both languages. It means that in any particular office or facility there should be one or more persons to serve the minority public in that area. However, everything about this bill seems to deny this reasonable policy, and on the contrary, implies an open-endedness that will force the provision of a bilingual service where it may not be desired or required. In this connection may I point to the fact that once established there is plenty of room for the expansion of bilingual districts but no provision for their abolition if, through the mobility of population, these same districts should no longer qualify for establishment as districts.\n\nThere is no provision for the desires of the residents to be heard. An advisory board is contemplated, but of what possible good is such a body if its members do not go out amongst the people actually affected by the board's opinion? Surely the board should reflect the opinions of the citizens concerned, or is this board to be just another haven for tired, worn-out Grits, another last chance for participatory democracy?\n\n[DOT] (3:20 p.m.)\n\nThe opinion of the editor of the Ottawa Citizen notwithstanding-and here I refer to\n\nMay 26, 1969\n\nOfficial Languages\n\nhis editorial of May 22-the provisions of the bill concerning the administration of justice are particularly offensive to any understanding of our constitution, which of course places the responsibility for the administration of justice on the provinces. In its original draft, which is all we have before us officially, the provisions contained in clause 11 are flagrantly unconstitutional. How can this parliament impose a duty on any provincial court? To attempt to do so is to fly directly in the face of the doctrine of the division of powers and the supremacy of parliament-doctrines\n\nwhich are basic to our constitution. I suggest that the proposed amendment to 11(4) does not in any way get around this objection because it does not remove the duty mentioned in subclause 1 from any of the criminal courts of the common law provinces-that duty being to receive or take evidence in either of the official languages, depending upon the request of the accused. Surely the only effective way of curing this fault would be to make subclause 4 apply to subclause 1 in full.\n\nNo matter what the government says about clause 11, Mr. Speaker, and in particular about the way in which the subclauses are interrelated, there is no doubt in my mind that subclause 4 does not have any effect on subclause 1 by the interposition of subclause 3, because it is merely permissive in nature. In my opinion this is of particular importance in view of the coyness of the Minister of Justice (Mr. Turner) in suggesting that it would place him at a disadvantage if he were called upon to defend this bill before the Supreme Court of Canada if he were to reveal his constitutional authority now.\n\nThe House of Commons is the highest court in the land, whether the Minister of Justice knows it or not, and I believe the minister is in contempt of this court by refusing to behave in an adult and mature manner in this regard. One would almost think he fancies himself as a Perry Mason type of person, saving all his legal expertise to the last possible moment. Speaking of expertise, one thing which is evident about this bill is that no drafting expertise went into it at all.\n\nIf I may, Mr. Speaker, I would now like to turn to the social implications of the bill. We have heard references made to melting pots and mosaics. Personally, I do not accept the melting pot theory as exemplified by the United States experience, as I believe the great significance of Canada is the tolerance displayed by the whole for its many parts. Of course, I speak as a member of that group of\n\nCanadians whose background is neither British nor French. It may be, therefore, that I do not feel any guilt for any of the alleged sins of my forebears because, quite frankly, I do not feel guilty about any injustices which either the French or British allege may have been perpetrated on them by the other group in the past. Perhaps it is because they lack this guilt feeling that the people of western and most of Atlantic Canada cannot be said to be exactly in love with this bill. In these parts of the country it is looked upon as a central Canadian solution to a central Canadian problem. The only objection is that it has national implications and national repercussions totally outside the ambit of the Dominion civil service.\n\nIf one wants to look, plenty of evidence can be found that the Dominion government continues to believe it has the constitutional right to abuse its spending power, as it did with medicare, to impose its ideas on language and culture on the individual provinces. It would be interesting to know what economic or money lever was applied to the new premier of Alberta, Mr. Harry Strom, popularly referred to as a nice guy, to quieten that province's official if not actual doubts about this measure-doubts which were so ably set out by the hon. E. C. Manning in his letter to the Prime Minister of October 29, 1968.\n\nApart from constitutional or social questions I believe this bill raises questions important to Canada's economic future. While it is glib to say one cannot put a price tag on bilingualism because, according to its proponents, they have a monopoly on ideas for nation saving, I submit that there certainly is a price tag involved.\n\nI referred earlier to the melting pot theory. In my view this bill will go a long way toward the imposition of the melting pot theory in this nation but with two pots instead of just one. This is twice as bad as having one. The bill before us will merely serve to weaken both the French and English languages in this country. I have had English speaking proponents of the bill tell me that it is a good bill because it will help to break down the relative immobility of the French speaking population of Quebec and get them out into the English speaking ocean of 220 million North Americans where they will be swallowed up and assimilated.\n\nA further aspect of this bill which has not been considered, apart from the tremendous cost, is the inefficiency which it will cause.\n\nMay 26, 1969\n\nThis will make Canada, as a nation, less competitive in the world marketplace. I would like to refer here to what G. A. Blackburn, the man responsible for the federal service language training program, had to say as reported in the Montreal Star for April 16, 1969. I am reading from the report.\n\nBecoming bilingual through classroom teaching is impossible, says the man responsible for the language training program in the federal civil service.\n\nA second language, G. A. Blackburn said here yesterday, can only be attained by one who is prepared to work on a full-time basis in a second linguistic and cultural milieu for a long period- a year or more.\n\nThe need for the second language is particularly doubtful in the technological and scientific fields. I would seriously ask why these areas of the public service are not specifically exempt from the operation of this bill because surely it must be apparent to everyone that the average Canadian has absolutely no contact with these areas of the government. I believe it is also true that the French language has now become quite inadequate in these areas. It certainly cannot be argued that it is necessary to impose compulsory bilingualism on scientific and technological personnel in order to carry out the stated aims of this bill or to preserve and strengthen the cultural fact of the French language in this country.\n\nI would like to make reference to the question of representation abroad. It should be apparent to everyone that for the next decade at least, if present policies are continued, more and more of the public service will be made up of persons whose first language is French. This will be one of the facts of life, because it is impossible for the rest of Canada, bearing in mind the facilities we have and the fiscal resources available to us, to produce anywhere near enough bilingual persons whose first language is English. I would again like to refer here to the comments of Mr. Blackburn as reported in the Montreal Star:\n\nHe admitted, however, that in his opinion the truly bicultural person is virtually non-existent. Even the bilingual person was \"at an enormous disadvantage if he has to do intellectual creative work in a second language.\"\n\nStressing the differences between bilingualism and biculturalism Mr. Blackburn pointed out that England and the United States may speak the same language but they form two distinct cultural groups.\n\n\"They have most words in common, but the words do not necessarily mean the same thing.\"\n\nSince language reflected the background and the experience of the people, communication between two individuals was effective only when they were of the same culture or when each of them had a\n\nOfficial Languages\n\nthorough understanding of the cultural background and experience of the other. \"Failure to take this concept into consideration produces many translations which do not convey the intended message,\" Mr. Blackburn said.\n\nHe suggested that Canadian companies serving a clientele made up of both French and English \"need a team representative of both cultures\" with each member of the team \"free to do his creative work in his own first working language.\"\n\nTherefore, Mr. Speaker, the question has to be asked: should not some attempt be made to define \"bilingual\" in order to relieve against this problem, because most of our representation abroad is of necessity conducted in the English language? Is it not poor practice to have policies at home which require our representatives abroad to work primarily in their second language? Will this policy give us our most effective representation where, as a nation which must trade to live, our interest is so vital? In other words, Mr. Speaker, will this policy help sell our timber, pulp and paper, fish, wheat and oil, or will it be a hindrance?\n\n[DOT] (3:30 p.m.)\n\nI believe the thoughts of one J. W. Kitchie of Victoria, British Columbia, are appropriate here, as he expressed them in a letter to the editor published in the Albertan of May 20, 1969. He says:\n\nAs the government has brought the new official languages bill before the House of Commons, and as there seems to be every indication that some appointments in the civil service, the armed forces and other federal agencies, will depend on a bilingual qualification it is essential that the term \"bilingual\" is clearly defined. The above definitions-\n\nThese are some definitions of bilingualism set out at the beginning of the letter to which I did not refer.\n\n-are from two recent editions of French dictionaries, published in Quebec and in Paris. Three contemporary English dictionaries mention or infer equal facility, or fluency in both languages.\n\nComplete fluency in both official languages will not be easy to find in this country; we must accept a degree of difficulty with idioms, the construction of sentences and some grammatical errors in that language which is not our native tongue. The Canadian of French parents often retains an accent to a greater or lesser degree which indicates his upbringing and background. Similarly, most English Canadians who have been taught French do not develop a true accent. Limited vocabularies and different grammatical constructions compound the problems. If one uses French with an English accent, some grammatical errors, a limited vocabulary and a lack of familiarity with French idioms, speaking only as well as some of the French federal cabinet ministers stumble through their television interviews in English, is one bilingual?\n\nMay 26, 1969\n\nOfficial Languages\n\nTrue bilingualism would be most difficult to achieve in this country, but practical bilingualism must be defined in the official languages bill to be equally fair to those seeking appointments where bilingualism is considered essential, whether their native language is French or English. Proficiency must be based on a standard, clearly defined ability to communicate regardless of the mother tongue of the individual.\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of the problem is forbearance and sympathy to someone who is seeking assistance, advice or direction in that official language which is not his mother tongue.\n\nThe Minister of Justice has stated that it would be tragic for Canada if this bill were referred to the Supreme Court for a test of its constitutionality. All I can say is that it is almost criminal for the minister to be promoting this bill and legislation such as the omnibus Criminal Code bill at a time when large areas of this country are suffering from what is in fact an economic depression due to the non-existence of an effective or aggressive grain marketing policy and abysmally poor administration of the grain movement machinery, while other areas are suffering from abnormally high unemployment compounded by the problems of runaway inflation and an inadequate housing program. I say it is almost criminal for him to be diverting our attention from these problems when he has so little faith in the legality of what he is promoting. After all, what would be so tragic about the Supreme Court of Canada declaring that this bill is perfectly within the powers of the government of Canada? I am sure we would all feel a lot more comfortable if that statement were made.\n\nEven if the bill were clearly constitutional, since it deals with language it should be in our constitution, in the same way as religion. If there is the support for this policy in the country that the Prime Minister believes there is, and if he has the mandate he alleges, why is he avoiding its implementation through entrenchment in the constitution? He has already passed up the February, 1969, constitutional conference, and he could have used the one that is going to be held within the month for this purpose. Why is he ignoring that method in favour of using his parliamentary majority to force his ideas on the country?\n\nIn my view the people of Canada did not give the Prime Minister a mandate for this legislation at all. This legislation is really based on the two-nations concept which the Prime Minister never tires of saying was rejected by the people of this country last June."
