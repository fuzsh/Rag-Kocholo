        "text": "Current Research\n\nWood structures can endure for centuries if they remain sufficiently dry. As the construction industry evolves, research is needed to protect wood buildings from the potential effects of moisture. Proper design, operation, and maintenance of wood buildings are critical to prevent moisture-induced damage, such as mold growth, wood decay, and corrosion of metal fasteners.\n\nDr. Glass is a member of the Building and Fire Sciences Research Work Unit at the Forest Products Laboratory. His research focuses on the building envelope, the collective elements that separate the interior and exterior environments, including the foundation, exterior walls, and roof. Dr. Glass investigates the relationships between moisture, energy efficiency, and durability in residential and non-residential wood buildings. Primary research objectives include\n\nAdvancing the fundamental understanding of wood–water interactions;\n\nQuantifying moisture transfer in the building envelope;\n\nDeveloping tools for assessing risk of moisture-induced damage in buildings; and\n\nDeveloping moisture control strategies for cross-laminated timber, a relatively new engineered wood product with vast potential for use in mid-rise and high-rise buildings.\n\nPast Research\n\nDr. Glass conducted his doctoral research in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He investigated how surfactant films at the gas-liquid interface control gas uptake and evaporation of water. These studies contributed to understanding chemical reactions that occur in sulfuric acid droplets in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, which affect ozone levels.\n\nResearch Interest\n\nWood−water interactions\n\nWater vapor sorption in wood\n\nMoisture-related properties of wood and wood products\n\nCross-laminated timber (CLT)\n\nMoisture control in buildings\n\nHeat, air, and moisture transfer in the building envelope\n\nInterior and exterior moisture loads on the building envelope\n\nTools for assessing risk of mold growth, wood decay, and corrosion of metal fasteners\n\nHygrothermal modeling\n\nInstrumentation for monitoring moisture levels in building assemblies\n\nWhy This Research Is Important"
