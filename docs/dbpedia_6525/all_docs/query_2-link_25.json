        "text": "At the time of the League’s 10th Anniversary in 1980, a system of League Honours was devised whereby those members who had given it distinguished service might be recognized. Additionally, provision was made to make awards to non-members who had shown particular loyalty to the Canadian Crown in public or private life. Over the years, League Honours have generally been awarded to commemorate a particular milestone in the reign of The Queen or an anniversary of the League’s founding. A number have been presented by distinguished guests such as Lady Mountbatten (1985), King Michael I of Romania, our Queen’s cousin (1992) and HRH Prince Michael of Kent (2002). Most have been presented by lieutenant governors. On rare occasions, the Dominion Chairman has made a presentation. These awards provide a modest, tangible recognition of service to the Crown and to the League. Below is a complete record of devoted members and friends of the cause who have received recognition. An asterisk (*) indicates that the recipient is now deceased. The city listed is that in which the recipient lived at the time of presentation.\n\nAwarded to members of the Monarchist League of Canada for singularly outstanding service at the Dominion level, or service given in several branches. Only ten badges exist, and each is returned to the League upon the death of its holder, in the fullness of time to be presented to a new recipient, so forming a golden thread of dedication and service uniting the League’s fellowship and purpose down the years. Only exceptionally are badges awarded to serving officers of the League.\n\nAwarded to individuals, not necessarily League members, who have distinguished themselves in their careers, professions or callings by their consistent and useful public advocacy of the monarchy. Particularly prior to the establishment of Badges of Service in 1980, but also occasionally thereafter, this award has also been made to members for special service on behalf of the League."
