        "text": "Career\n\nHe returned to Drumheller where he practiced law. Schumacher first ran for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the 1968 Federal election, and was elected to represent Palliser in Alberta. He would serve in the Canadian House of Commons for a total of three terms.\n\nAs a result of redistribution for what would be the 1979 federal election, Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark and Schumacher saw their ridings abolished.\n\nSchumacher\"s former assistant, John Aimers, resigned from the party in January 1978 in protest accusing the national executive engineering Schumacher\"s defeat. On February 28, 1978 Schumacher left the party in order to sit as an Independent.\n\nHis tenure as an Independent member lasted until his defeat in the 1979 federal election. In that election he ran in the new electoral district of Bow River but lost to Taylor.\n\nIn the 1986 Alberta general election Schumacher ran for the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta in Drumheller electoral district.\n\nHis first role in the Legislative Assembly was Deputy Speaker, he served that position for until 1993. Schumacher became Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in 1993 after the retirement of David Carter. He retired in 1997 from politics after the dissolution of the 24th Legislature after serving a total of three terms as an Modern Language Association.\n\nAfter his career in the provincial legislature he served on the Alberta Surface Rights and Land Compensation boards where he eventually became Chairman."
