        "text": "E.F. Schumacher (born August 16, 1911, Bonn, Germany—died September 4, 1977, Romont, Switzerland) was a German-born British economist who developed the concepts of “intermediate technology” and “small is beautiful.”\n\nAs a German Rhodes scholar in the early 1930s, E.F. Schumacher studied at the University of Oxford and Columbia University. He and his wife settled in England in 1937. During World War II he helped develop theories behind full-employment policies and, under William Henry Beveridge, the chief economic adviser to the government, worked on plans for Britain’s postwar welfare state. From 1950 to 1970 he was also an adviser to Britain’s nationalized coal industry. In that role he advocated the continuation of British coal production while emphasizing conservation—despite a Middle Eastern oil glut and the development of nuclear energy. (He opposed nuclear power generation because of what he saw as its intractable waste-disposal problem.)"
