It was announced on 29 June 2017 that he was released by the club.[136]\n\nSouthport\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 2017, Schumacher joined Southport after being released by Stevenage.[137] He made his Southport debut in the opening game of the season against Boston United and scored his first goal for the club, in a 4–0 win.[138] Schumacher then appeared in a number of matches, as he fight for his first team place, and went on to make ten appearances in all competitions.[139] He went on to score three more goals for Southport.[140] After being placed by the club on a transfer list, Schumacher was released by Southport in January, having spent six months at the club.[141]\n\nCoaching career\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing his release by Stevenage, Schumacher took a coaching job at Everton and was once an interim manager at Southport.[142][143] On 19 January 2018, Schumacher returned to Bury as first team coach, assisting caretaker-manager Ryan Lowe.[144] Upon Lowe's appointment as permanent manager, Schumacher remained in his role.[145] As a result, he quietly announced his retirement from professional football.[142] At the end of the 2018–19 season, Schumacher's contributions helped Bury gain promotion back to League One despite the financial turmoil surrounding the club, a winding-up petition pending and players and staff being paid late or not at all.[146]\n\nPlymouth Argyle\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 5 June 2019, Lowe brought Schumacher with him upon leaving Bury to become Plymouth Argyle manager, with Schumacher appointed as his assistant manager.[147] By the time he joined the club, Schumacher only just received his UEFA Pro License A.[148] Together with Lowe, Schumacher's contributions helped Plymouth Argyle to a third-place finish and an immediate return to League One in a season interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.[149]\n\nOn 7 December 2021, following the departure of Lowe in order to take a job at Preston North End, Schumacher was swiftly appointed manager of Plymouth Argyle. A day later, his first match ended in a 1–1 draw against Milton Keynes Dons.[150] In just his tenth match as a manager, Schumacher took charge of Argyle as they narrowly lost 2–1 in extra time in the FA Cup fourth round to reigning European Champions Chelsea.[151] Argyle's fine early form under Schumacher saw the club record six straight wins in March 2022 without conceding a single goal, the best defensive record at the club since 2005.[152][153] This impressive run of form saw Schumacher awarded the EFL League One Manager of the Month award for March.[154] The season ultimately ended in disappointment as a 5–0 home defeat to Milton Keynes Dons on the final day of the season saw Plymouth drop out of the play-off places.[155]\n\nAn impressive start to the 2022–23 season saw Plymouth sitting top of the league at the end of September. Having won three out of four of the matches, including a victory over fellow promotion hopefuls Ipswich Town, Schumacher was awarded the Manager of the Month award for September.[156] Schumacher won the award for a second consecutive month after another unbeaten month that kept Plymouth top of the league.[157] At the end of April, Plymouth secured promotion to the Championship after 13 years away.[158] A week later, Plymouth secured the League One title on the final day of the season with a 3–1 victory away at Port Vale, winning 101 points in total.[159][160] He was also named as the League One Manager of the Year.[161]\n\nStoke City\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 December 2023, Schumacher was appointed head coach at Championship club Stoke City on a three-and-a-half-year contract.[160] He was also joined by his coaching staff of Darren Behcet, Peter Cavanagh and Mark Hughes.[160] His first match in charge was a goalless draw against Millwall on 23 December 2023.[162]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSchumacher is good friends with Peter Sweeney as they have known each other since they were fifteen.[163] Schumacher has qualified for the UEFA B Licence and later the UEFA A License.[164][148] He also has a BA Honours Degree in Professional Sports Journalism and Broadcasting.[148] In September 2011, Schumacher became a father when his partner gave birth to a baby girl, Claudia.[165]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League FA Cup League Cup Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Everton 2003–04[166] Premier League 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Carlisle United (loan) 2003–04[166] Third Division 4 0 1 0 0 0 1[a] 1 6 1 Oldham Athletic (loan) 2003–04[166] Second Division 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bradford City 2004–05[167] League One 43 6 1 0 1 0 1[a] 0 46 6 2005–06[168] League One 30 1 3 0 1 1 1[a] 0 35 2 2006–07[169] League One 44 6 3 1 1 0 1[a] 0 49 7 Total 117 13 7 1 3 1 3 0 130 15 Crewe Alexandra 2007–08[170] League One 26 1 1 0 1 0 1[a] 0 29 1 2008–09[171] League One 15 2 0 0 2 0 2[a] 1 19 3 2009–10[172] League Two 32 4 0 0 0 0 1[a] 0 33 4 Total 73 7 1 0 3 0 4 1 81 8 Bury 2010–11[173] League Two 43 9 1 0 1 0 1[a] 0 46 9 2011–12[174] League One 32 6 1 0 1 0 0 0 34 6 2012–13[175] League One 39 8 2 0 1 0 2[a] 2 44 10 Total 114 23 4 0 3 0 3 2 124 25 Fleetwood Town 2013–14[176] League Two 32 5 2 0 0 0 5[b] 0 39 5 2014–15[177] League One 32 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 33 0 Total 64 5 3 0 0 0 5 0 72 5 Stevenage 2015–16[178] League Two 15 2 1 1 1 0 1[a] 0 18 3 2016–17[179] League Two 28 5 0 0 0 0 2[a] 1 30 6 Total 43 7 1 1 1 0 3 1 48 9 Southport 2017–18[180] National League North 10 4 0 0 — 0 0 10 4 Career total 425 59 17 2 10 1 19 5 471 67\n\nManagerial statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of matches played 13 August 2024\n\nTeam From To Record G W D L Win % Ref Southport 27 September 2017 18 October 2017 1 0 0 1 000.00 [181] Plymouth Argyle 7 December 2021 19 December 2023 108 57 21 30 052.78 [181] Stoke City 19 December 2023 present 27 11 6 10 040.74 [181] Totals 136 68 27 41 050.00\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nPlymouth Argyle\n\nEFL League One: 2022–23[182]\n\nEFL Trophy runner-up: 2022–23[183]\n\nIndividual\n\nEFL League One Manager of the Season: 2022–23[161]\n\nEFL League One Manager of the Month: March 2022,[154] September 2022,[156] October 2022[157]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
