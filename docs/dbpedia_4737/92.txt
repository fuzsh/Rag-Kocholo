Mota-Engil, a leading company in Portugal and a European benchmark, secured in 2015 a position among the world’s 100 largest construction companies, by achieving the 86th in the Annual Ranking of Engineering News-Record (ENR), an acknowledged international publication specialised in the construction industry.

It is also worth highlighting Mota-Engil’s achievement of the 54th position among the world’s most internationalised construction companies, a criterion which excludes the Turnover obtained in the domestic market, and for which the significant growth of the Group in the regions of Africa and Latin America has been a determining factor. Therefore, the Group is currently present in 22 countries, spread over 3 Continents.

Mota-Engil has reached in 2014, for the first time, a position among the world’s 100 largest companies in the sector, being placed in the 98th position, after occupying the 110th position in 2013, thus ensuring in 2015 the best position ever of a Portuguese construction company in this Ranking.
