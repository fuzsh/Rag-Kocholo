Our greatest strength is the expertise and experience of our people, all of whom are committed to putting our clients’ needs first.\n\nWe work closely with clients to structure insurance programmes for those engaged in international trade, investment and lending. With the largest broking team in the CPRI market, an annual premium volume of approximately US$400 million, and a market share close to 20%, we are the leading broker in CPRI.\n\nWe are proud to be employee-owned which provides continuity for our teams and our clients, allowing us to build long-term relationships.\n\nOur company was founded in 1983 when the CPRI market was in its infancy. Over the past 35 years, we have developed in-depth knowledge and expertise of our market and product, enabling us to provide high quality advice and tailored solutions for our clients. We believe we are the broker of choice not just for our clients, but that insurers also value the professionalism and breadth of experience we bring to each transaction.\n\nAs an insurance broker, we act exclusively for our clients as their agent. We do not act for insurers. We allow our clients to fix our remuneration, which is typically standard brokerage. We take no additional payments or commissions from insurers for the services we provide to them while acting for policyholders.\n\nOur global network ensures we can provide services for our clients worldwide from our offices in London, New York, Paris, Geneva, Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BPL_Global\n\nFollow us on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/berry-palmer-&-lyle/\n\nTEXEL\n\nThe Texel Group established over 20 years ago is a privately owned and independent insurance broker specialising in the field of credit and political risk insurance and reinsurance. We are focused purely on arranging, structuring and negotiating CPRI to provide clients with credit and concentration risk mitigation, balance sheet and regulatory capital solutions. Our company represents commercial, investment and multilateral banks as well as development financial institutions, using non-payment insurance to allow them to conservatively grow their lending book. We are a market leader in creating insurance solutions to support lending across the sectors within the Project and Infrastructure Finance market and represent a number of the largest bank and multilateral lenders within this financing segment.\n\nThe Texel Group established a charitable foundation in 2015 and we have supported more than 90 programmes across 21 countries with donations of over £1.3 million.
