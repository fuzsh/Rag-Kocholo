        "text": "When close to half the companies in Portugal have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") above 13x, you may consider Mota-Engil, SGPS, S.A. ( ) as an attractive investment with its 9.7x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nMota-Engil SGPS certainly has been doing a good job lately as its earnings growth has been positive while most other companies have been seeing their earnings go backwards. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, possibly more than the market, which has repressed the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think Mota-Engil SGPS' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .\n\nIs There Any Growth For Mota-Engil SGPS?\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Mota-Engil SGPS' is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.\n\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 116%. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. Accordingly, shareholders probably wouldn't have been overly satisfied with the unstable medium-term growth rates.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 6.1% each year during the coming three years according to the three analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 6.3% per year growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nWith this information, we find it odd that Mota-Engil SGPS is trading at a P/E lower than the market. It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.\n\nWe've established that Mota-Engil SGPS currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. It appears some are indeed anticipating earnings instability, because these conditions should normally provide more support to the share price.\n\nIt's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. (at least 1 which is a bit concerning), and understanding these should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free\n\nHave feedback on this article?
