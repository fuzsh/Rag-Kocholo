Mota-Engil is also committed to including this KPI performance in its Sustainability Report.\n\nIn the roadshow with European investors, that preceded this offering, Mota-Engil's management team presented the new strategic plan pursuant to the investment agreement with China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.\n\nOver 4.836 investors have participated in the offering. Several insurance companies, pension funds, asset management firms, banks and private banking entities from Portugal, Spain and Switzerland took part in the transaction in the segment of Institutional Investors.\n\nHaitong Bank acted as Joint Global Coordinator, alongside CaixaBI, Banco Finantia and Novo Banco.\n\nAs a global coordinator of this transaction, Haitong Bank reinforces its role as a reference bank for Portuguese companies seeking to access the capital markets through the adoption of innovative solutions or based on sustainability principles, where the Bank is a leading player. Mota-Engil, in turn, joins a selected group of issuers in Portugal of sustainability-linked bonds."
