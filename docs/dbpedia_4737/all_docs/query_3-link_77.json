        "text": "Portugal-based railroad company Mota-Engil is consolidating its position as a major railroad developer, as it might finish 2022 with three important railway projects in Mexico that go from the construction of an interstate train to a local railway system. Along with other companies, Mota-Engil aims to reactivate the railway industry in the country.\n\nAt the time of writing, the company has won two contracts to develop railway projects, the first being Section 1 of the Mayan Train, which the company gained in April 2020. The project consists in developing 228km of a railway from Chiapas to Campeche. The company is developing the project with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), Grupo Cosh and Eyasa y Gavil Ingeniería, three companies providing an investment of over US$638 million.\n\nMota-Engil has recently also won the tender for the construction of lines 4, 5 and 6 of Monterrey's Metro System (Metrorrey) along with the China-based CRRC (Hong Kong) and CRRC Nanjing Puzhen. These projects will require an estimated investment of US$1.2 billion, though according to state authorities, the final amount could change because it is not clear whether Line 5 will be constructed at ground level or using an elevated viaduct. The project consists of the development of 34km of a railway that will connect Monterrey’s downtown with the municipalities of Santa Catarina and Mederos. Construction works are set to start on Sept. 30, 2022.\n\nMota-Engil was the only company that presented an offer to design, plan, construct, equip and operate Line 4 of Guadalajara’s Light Rail system. The consortium led by the company presented a public offer of US$1 billion, and it also proposed to manage the project under a public-private scheme where the public sector would invest US$477 million. However, authorities must announce the final decision on Oct. 5, 2022. It is unclear which companies constitute the consortium led by Mota-Engil. Nonetheless, local media speculated that the Chinese company CRRC is a key player in the group."
