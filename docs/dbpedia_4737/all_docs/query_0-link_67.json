        "text": "Clients within the construction industry have become more aware of benefits that exist and can be reached when going through a major construction project, benefits that invite for efficiency improvements both during construction and its prophases. People are still not aware of project management and its practices, which is serving as a major drawback for non-adopting of management techniques in construction. New methods of execution and their different advantages are evaluated. This change has opened the door for new business models such as Construction Management (CM) but it also demands the contractors to adopt and come up with more client-customized methods. The study is made on, factors affecting the client when making the choice between CM and contractors. Investigation and highlighting the behaviors, features and processes that affect the client in their way towards an optimal investment. It further explores what the contractors and CM firms can do in order to adapt to their c...\n\nThis article is written for the launch of the specialty section on construction management at the Frontiers in Built Environment. This new specialty section opens an on-line platform for academics and practitioners in the subject field to share valuable experiences and findings from innovative research and development as well as practices, which focus on the management of people/workforce, product/production, and processes across built environment project stages, including development and construction, operation and maintenance, as well as demolition and redevelopment, under considerations on the dependability and productivity of construction management services. In this article, the writer presents his humble opinions limited from experiences from academic research and professional services around the world in the past three decades. The topics derived on grand challenges in construction management are gigantic in terms of their coverages, but may have huge impacts on professional development in both short and longer term. Discussions presented here on grand challenges in construction management consist of four parts to respectively focus on an initial cognitive framework of the construction management body of knowledge (CMBOK), intelligence pervasive construction management systems, interdisciplinary digital innovation, and solutions for performance enhancement in megaproject delivery. The research methodology that support the writer to describe the four grand challenges includes literature review, comparison study, site observation, and system architecture analysis and development. It was the writer's initial abductive reasoning to identify the four grand challenges in construction management through an extensive literature review, which was based on national and regional strategies for the construction industry from the world top economies. Some key references relating to these four major topics are collected to support discussions in this article. It is expected that this article could contribute to the debate as well as research and development in construction management in terms of continuous technical enhancements on project-oriented performance and value regardless the scope, the location, and the time associated and concerned. As the study was conducted through abductive reasoning, this article should have its limitation on the coverage to all grand challenges in construction management, and this should leave many unanswered questions for further exploratory research.\n\nIn the increasingly globalized world, the most important goal of the businesses is trying to do activities both in time and with the least cost by managing the resources productively. The businesses attach the importance to planning, programming and controlling for the purpose of increasing productivity and ensuring coordination on the ground of increasing competition and extensity of the works. Because of that reason, today Project and Project management become unavoidable in each sector. Regardless of the work done with Project managemet, activies are seen as whole, these activities are examined thoroughly with the appropriate methods of Project analysis and it is created a business plan. The business plans differ in not only management strategies of the business but also application methods in sectors. In this study, it is aimed to examine the contribution of the time analysis to the Project by using the Project planning techniques in a constructional Project. In accordance with ...\n\nProject management standards are gradually moving to the direction where increasingly attention is put on cooperation and collaboration methods between different players involved in construction operation. Construction professionals and other experts i.e. in academia agree widely that this is essential. Construction business and its operations in general have not been isolated from the long term developments in different sectors such as outsourcing where core businesses is valued high and other operations are cut away. This has resulted in high number of specialized companies that on the other hand has increased the total number of partners in any kind of construction project. From the management viewpoint this is a different challenge and it has naturally provided the starting point for new kind of managerial tools and solutions. This paper provides discussion of the characteristics of modern construction and those as starting points for the development of new kind of construction ..."
