        "text": "BARCELONA, Spain, Nov. 10, 2010 /PRNewswire/ -- With more than 180 companies in 19 countries, Grupo Mota-Engil is one of the largest civil construction and public works organizations in Portugal. Today, the company relies on enterprise performance management (EPM) solutions from SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) to consolidate information from across the enterprise and to oversee strategic growth and global development.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20050310/SFTH009LOGO-a)\n\n(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20050310/SFTH009LOGO-a)\n\nGrupo Mota-Engil uses the SAP® BusinessObjects™ Strategy Management application to support its \"Ambition 2013\" initiative, a high-level strategy to promote growth through continued diversification of its worldwide projects. The application brings Grupo Mota-Engil a unified view of these projects, and enables the company to drill down into individual business units with scorecards that monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for finance, operations, marketing, innovation and other areas. Since the KPIs have standardized definitions, decision-makers can easily compare and contrast the aggregated performance metrics of different business units. They can also cascade the scorecards throughout the company to align top-level Ambition 2013 strategy with execution at the unit level.\n\nThe application has enabled Grupo Mota-Engil to focus on critical issues first, as well as reduce risk by identifying potential problems early and responding swiftly with corrective actions. Managers who previously spent a great deal of time manually collating data from different sources now have quick and easy access to more accurate and higher quality information that is automatically consolidated across the companies.\n\nThis announcement was made at SAP Insider Financials 2010, taking place in Barcelona, Spain, Nov. 10-12.
