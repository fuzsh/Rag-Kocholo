        "text": "Several members of the Board of Directors, including the Chairman António Mota, Maria Manuela Mota, Maria Teresa Mota, Maria Paula Mota and Gonçalo Moura Martins, and also several relevant figures in the historical journey of the Mota-Engil Group were present at the event.\n\nIn the stock market debut of Mota & Companhia in 1987, the company’s market capitalization was worth 156 million euros, an amount very different from de current 831 million euros. “It is made public that 2,700,000 shares with par value of 1,000 escudos each of Mota & Companhia, S.A. and represented by securities of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 shares have been admitted to official listing”, was written in a book displayed at the ceremony, containing the notice issued by the Lisbon Stock Exchange on the 5th of November 1987. Thirty years later, Mota-Engil is one of the historical companies of the national stock market, which rose the most in 2017, appreciating over 114% this year.\n\nFor the Chair of Euronext Lisbon, Paulo Rodrigues Silva, Mota-Engil “is an example of the stock market importance in funding the real economy”.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors, António Mota, sustains that “this is a key date and that a part of the company’s knowledge is also due to the ability to find the capital required to make its development”, also reminding that being listed “lead to a more professional and transparent management.”\n\n“These 30 years had difficult moments, but the good ones have been more”, he finished. Referring one of the most symbolic moments of the Group’s history, the Chairman admits that “there would be no merge of Mota with Engil if both companies weren’t listed; only the combination of the shareholders’ will with that fact has enabled a successful merge.”\n\nFor the future, António Mota believes that “2017 is the year the downturn shifts and 2018 will be a year of growth consolidation”, and guarantees that the Group is “designing a project which will have an upward trend over the next few years.”"
