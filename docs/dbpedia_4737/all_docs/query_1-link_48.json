        "text": "On 9 December 2019, the Government of Rwanda and Qatar Airways concluded an investment partnership for Rwanda’s new international airport. According to the agreement, the partnership features three agreements to build, own, and operate the state-of-the-art facility. Under the new deal, Qatar Airways agreed to take a 60% stake in the project, which, as a whole, is valued at around $1.3 billion.\n\nIn 2016, Rwanda partnered with Mota-Engil as the former majority shareholder of 75 percent in the project. In the new deal, Rwanda had to purchase the 75 per cent shareholding by Mota-Engil in order to retain 100 per cent ownership before entering the new partnership with Qatar Airways.\n\nThe third part of the agreement is one of security, considering that Aviation Travel and Logistics (ATL) Holding is entering the agreement on behalf of the Government of Rwanda, it is necessary to have a security agreement to establish that they are guaranteed by the government.\n\nMinister of Infrastructure, Hon. Claver Gatete told local and international media that Mota-Engil,the Portuguese company remains in the project as the contractor.\n\n“The Government of Rwanda will continue working with Mota-Engil in construction activities.The company remains as a contractor not as a shareholder” Minister Gatete has clarified.\n\nMinister Gatete also noted that the next step is the signing of a Concession Agreement between the Government of Rwanda and the Project Company as a conclusion of the deal by March 2020.\n\nThe new airport is being redesigned to accommodate seven million passengers per annum starting end 2022. In phase two, the new International airport would be expanded to reach a maximum passenger capacity of 14 million passengers a year by 2032."
