        "text": "Portugal have only 3 stocks in Trading 212 in CFD mode only. Is it possible to add more stock options from this country to invest and CFD´s also?\n\nThere is some of listed Portuguese stocks from EURONEXT Lisbon:\n\nJERÓNIMO MARTINS (JMT.LS)\n\nGALP ENERGIA (GALP.LS)\n\nMOTA-ENGIL SGPS S.A. (EGL.LS)\n\nSONAE SGPS S.A (SON.LS)\n\nEDP (EDP.LS)\n\nEDP RENOVÁVEIS (EDPR.LS)\n\nNOS TELECOMUNICAÇÕES (NOS.LS)\n\nGRUPO IMPRESA (IPR.LS)\n\nCOFINA S.A (CFN.LS)\n\nCTT Correios de Portugal (CTT.LS)\n\nBCP - Banco Comercial Português S.A. (BCP.LS)\n\nThey won’t be able to add them as it’s not a Penny Stock Exempt.\n\nAs a recommendation before posting, just go to https://www.otcmarkets.com/ put in your thicker and be sure it has the Penny Stock Exempt badge. Only they can be added.\n\nFunny that you caught me out on that @Rygel…\n\nI am aware of it, I even liked several of your posts today as I think you are doing a great job of increasing awareness and kindly replying to threads .\n\nUnfortunately, I just assumed that as it was a profitable company and with a reasonable stock price it was automatically penny stock exempt. I did not even ocurr to me to check.\n\nI am very surprised that it is not penny stock exempt as its share price is greater than 5 dollars and I am confident that its assets exceed 5 million USD.\n\nFollowing on from my previous post, it seems like the ticker from Yahoo (which I mentioned above) is incorrect:\n\nThe correct ticker is EDRVF, which as expected is Penny Stock Exempt:\n\nhttps://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EDRVF/overview\n\nThanks for raising it Rygel, we have now hopefully got the apropriate ticker."
