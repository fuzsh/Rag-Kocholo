Therefore, the Group is currently present in 22 countries, spread over 3 Continents.\n\nMota-Engil has reached in 2014, for the first time, a position among the world’s 100 largest companies in the sector, being placed in the 98th position, after occupying the 110th position in 2013, thus ensuring in 2015 the best position ever of a Portuguese construction company in this Ranking."
