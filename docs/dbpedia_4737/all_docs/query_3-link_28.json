        "text": "LONDON – Mota-Engil Africa, a subsidiary of the Portuguese conglomerate Mota-Engil, said on Thursday that its initial public offering could value the company as much as 1.33 billion pounds, or about $2.26 billion.\n\nMota-Engil Africa, an engineering and construction company based in Johannesburg, intends to offer at least 25 percent of its share capital.\n\nThe company said it expected to price its shares at £9.20 to £11.60 a share, giving it a market capitalization of up to £1.33 billion. Conditional trading of the company’s shares in London is expected to begin on July 11.\n\n“We are very pleased with the positive response to the news of our intention to float and today’s announcement reflects the high level of investor interest in Mota-Engil Africa and its significant opportunities for growth in sub-Saharan Africa,” Gilberto Rodrigues, the Mota-Engil Africa chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nMota-Engil Africa plans to use the proceeds from the offering to expand its core construction and engineering business in sub-Saharan Africa and to diversify its operations.\n\nThe offering will include sales to institutional investors in Portugal and other jurisdictions and qualified shareholders of the company’s corporate parent, Mota-Engil.\n\nFounded in Angola in 1946, Mota-Engil Africa operates in 10 African countries, including its primary markets of Angola, Malawi and Mozambique. The company, which employs about 14,600 people, had revenue of 1 billion euros in 2013."
