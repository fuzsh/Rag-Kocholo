        "text": "Don’t cry for St. Louis, sports fans.\n\nThe departure of the Rams to Los Angeles, whence they came two decades ago, is something for the city’s residents to cheer, not bemoan. St. Louis got lucky.\n\nSure, fans of professional football in St. Louis are going to miss the Rams. Though they have been bad in recent years, they had some great seasons in St. Louis. From 1998 to 2003, Kurt Warner — one of the greatest undrafted players in N.F.L. history — set the city on its ear, winning two Most Valuable Player Awards as the Rams’ quarterback and leading the team to a Super Bowl victory after the 1999 season.\n\nBut the economics underpinning the recent deal St. Louis and the State of Missouri tried to put together to keep the Rams would have been financially ruinous. Let’s not be coy about this: St. Louis, a city of fewer than 320,000 people, with a shrinking tax base, simply couldn’t afford to help finance the $1 billion stadium that the Rams’ billionaire owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, was seeking. Its mistake was in trying.\n\nStadium financing has always been a struggle for St. Louis. In 1995, hoping to attract an N.F.L. franchise, the city, the state and the county built what was essentially a spec stadium, originally called the Trans World Dome. (The naming rights later shifted to Edward Jones, the financial services company.) The stadium was paid for entirely with public funds, with the three entities agreeing to repay $258 million in bonds. The city’s share of that was $6 million a year, which it expected to generate from so-called game-day taxes — that is, taxes on everything sold inside the stadium during a game.\n\nIn recent years, those game-day taxes have consistently fallen short, amounting to around $4.8 million a year, according to Andrew Arkills, a financial analyst who dissected the numbers for stadium opponents. The difference was being paid out of the city’s coffers, meaning that those were tax dollars not going to the police or teachers or city services.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
