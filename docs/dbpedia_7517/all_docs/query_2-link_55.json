        "text": "Keep up to date with the latest college football stadium news below. Dozens of stadiums are undergoing renovations and improvement projects. Renovations range from new video boards to multi-phase development projects. Bookmark this page for the latest updates to FBS stadiums.\n\nLooking for new college football stadiums or conference realignment news?\n\nBeaver Stadium (Penn State)\n\nPenn State approved a $700M renovation to Beaver Stadium in May 2024. The three-phase project is expected to be completed a phase at a time for the next three seasons. The total renovation is expected to be completed by the 2027 season.\n\nIncluded in the project are a 21,000-square-foot welcome center (pictured), expanded luxury seat options, widened concourses, improved wifi and cell connectivity, better video boards, and a winterized field. The winterization was announced long before the renovation project and will be ready this year in anticipation of hosting a College Football Playoff game.\n\nPenn State long threatened to build a new stadium, but the $700M renovation is likely a more affordable option than building a new premier stadium. There’s no word yet on how the renovations will affect Beaver Stadium’s 106K capacity – currently the second-largest stadium in the country.\n\nMemorial Stadium (Missouri)\n\nThe University of Missouri revealed renderings for a $250M upgrade to Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium in April. That followed an announcement on Feb. 5 of the largest athletics gift in school history ($62M donation). The project is set to be completed in time for the 2026 season.\n\nAdditions to the North End Zone, including the construction of premium seats and a complex, will reportedly increase Memorial Stadium’s capacity from 62,621 to 65,000. That increase would bump Mizzou up five spots nationally in total capacity.\n\nKansas City-based DLR Group will lead the construction and planning after being selected by the school in December 2023.\n\n– Apr. 18, 2024\n\nWar Memorial Stadium (Wyoming)\n\nThe University of Wyoming announced a plan to renovate War Memorial Stadium following the 2023 season. “Restore the War” as it’s come to be known is a project to completely renovate the west grandstands in Laramie.\n\nPhase I will be complete ahead of the 2024 football season and completely revamps the fan experience in the stands. Phase II begins after the 2024 season – set to be completed in time for 2025 – and is focused around the media and broadcast sector. The total renovation will cost $20M.\n\nRynearson Stadium (Eastern Michigan)\n\nThanks to a $1M donation made by EMU alumnus and current Las Vegas Raider Maxx Crosby, Rynearson Stadium is getting a new playing surface. The EMU athletics department confirmed this to Road to CFB, saying an announcement was coming “soon” (reported Nov. 15, 2023). The track around the stadium will be removed and it’s expected the turf will remain grey, although both of those details were not confirmed by EMU.\n\nMarch, 2024, proposed renderings reflected the grey turf remain in place.\n\nSimmons Bank Liberty Stadium (Memphis)\n\nThe University of Memphis announced major renovations for Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium in March 2024. The three-phase renovation will cost $195M, with a total completion expected in time for the 2026 football season.\n\nPhase I began after the 2023 season. It includes improving the East Side Suite Level Two to accommodate media and game day operations. Phase II is expected to begin “as soon after the 2024 academic calendar begins” as possible. This more dramatic phase includes a total revamp of the west side, including the press box and grandstands.\n\nThe most dramatic improvement is the introduction of a “Party Plaza” replacing a bulk of the premium stands under the press box. It would be the first of its kind in the FBS.\n\nPhase III is not yet confirmed. According to the school, an additional $25M would be needed to expand locker rooms, upgrade the stadium “halo” (see blue ribbon lights above), and expand the north end zone tunnel so the venue can host major concerts.\n\nJordan-Hare Stadium\n\nAuburn announced plans to replace its current north end zone video board. The current video board has been an iconic staple to Jordan-Hare Stadium since 1987 and is one of the largest in college football. The newer one will be notably smaller, but paves the way for more north end zone improvements laid out in the release.\n\nThe video board will also be raised from being flush with the stands. While perhaps a bit awkward at the start, Auburn intends to fill that space in down the line.\n\nConstruction will begin in Summer 2024 and the project expects to be complete by the 2025 season.\n\n– Feb. 2, 2024\n\nDoak Campbell Stadium\n\nConstruction on “Transformation of Doak Campbell Stadium” began Jan. 26. Several improvements are planned, most notably adding new luxury box seats to the west grandstand and a revamping of the stylized south end zone. The east grandstand is also receiving an upgrade for 2024, expanding seat width to 18″. As of February, there wasn’t a newly-announced capacity, which currently stands at 79,560.\n\nThe entire project is expected to be $265 million. That price tag caused the increase in some season ticket prices – a move met with opposition. The west grandstands are quoted to reopen in time for the 2025 football season.\n\n– Jan. 26, 2024\n\nCotton Bowl Stadium\n\nThe Oklahoma Sooners’ Twitter account announced a contract extension to keep their annual Red River Shootout rivalry against Texas at the Cotton Bowl through 2036. Also announced in the presser was $140 million worth of renovations to Cotton Bowl Stadium.\n\nThe project is a “two-year renovation project that honors the Cotton Bowl Stadium’s celebrated legacy and distinctive architecture with sweeping enhancements…” Plans include widening concourses – a common problem with older stadiums – adding elevators, improved entrance/exodus, and more premium options.\n\nThe first phase includes revamping the west side of the stadium and is expected to be complete by the 2026 season. Phase two won’t be finished until 2034. That part includes “significant” renovations to the east side.\n\n“The stadium renovations will be extensive, and we can’t wait for our fans to experience the enhancements,” commented OU Director of Athletics Joe Castiglione.\n\nNebraska Memorial Stadium (Nebraska)\n\nThe Lincoln Journal Star reported in October 2022 that Nebraska’s Memorial Stadium was in need of renovations. According to Nebraska Athletic Director Trev Alberts, the renovation project would be focused on modernizing and preserving the stadium for “the next 50 to 100 years of Memorial Stadium.”\n\nIn September 2023, plans for a $450 million renovation dropped. The south end zone of the stadium will be demolished and rebuilt, reportedly dropping the capacity from 90,000 to 75,000. Notably, the Huskers have sold out a record 396 consecutive games through the 2023 season at its current capacity.\n\nA new 360º concourse will be installed on the ground level while a new 270º one is planned for the upper decks. The south end zone will be torn down following the 2024 season.\n\nFolsom Field (Colorado)\n\nColorado announced a $15M upgrade for a new video board, one five times larger than their current board. The new build is expected to be ready by the start of the 2024 season. The Buffs will move from the Pac-12 back to the Big 12 next season, as well.\n\nDavid Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium (Kansas)\n\nThe University of Kansas released plans Aug. 15 to renovate David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium and the surrounding land. The entirety of the property plans to undergo a facelift, from the stands to the football facilities, and they will add a Gateway District. Renderings for a new locker room, player lounge, and suites for fans were released alongside the announcement.\n\nThe project begins immediately following the 2023 football season. Phase I will completely redo the stands of the stadium and that phase plans to be done by the 2025 season. The seating facelift will “lower capacity” but will still exceed 40,000. Kansas plans to raise $335 million total in funding for the renovation.\n\nMichie Stadium (Army)\n\nArmy announced a $145M “restoration” of Michie Stadium to be completed in time for the 2026 football season. In the renderings appear to be a revamped concourse, new luxury seating options, a brand-new 162K-foot athletic facility, and a complete rebuild of the East stands. The lower stretch of stands are reserved for cadets with a “central focus” on the cadets.\n\nA new “Victory Plaza” is also planned for visitors outside of the stadium gates. Ground breaking is set for Spring, 2024.\n\nBen Hill Griffin Stadium (Florida)\n\nIn July, the University of Florida confirmed they began the process to select an architect to complete a $400M renovation to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The Tampa Bay Times reported that UF was looking at companies that had worked on modernization projects like Fenway Park and Lambeau Field.\n\nWhile no details or timeline are yet available, Florida plans to revamp “every phase of the fan experience.” UF is the next in a long line of major programs renovating historic stadiums in the ongoing college football facilities arms race.\n\nValley Children’s Stadium (Fresno State)\n\nFresno State revealed rendering for a $250M upgrade to their athletic facilities on May 9, 2023. Included is a re-imagining of Valley Children’s Stadium (formerly Bulldog Stadium), shown in the renderings. In 2018, Fresno State tried, and failed, to renovate the stadium, which is reportedly in serious need of an upgrade.\n\n“It’s real,” said Fresno State athletic director Terry Tumey. “We are no longer in a hypothetical mode. We understand the external pressures that we have and the changing landscape of collegiate athletics [and] we do think that by showing investment by the university and by the community speaks volumes to the nation as to the importance of our athletics enterprise to what we do as a university.”\n\nThe project begins this summer with upgrades to suites on the east side of the stadium.
