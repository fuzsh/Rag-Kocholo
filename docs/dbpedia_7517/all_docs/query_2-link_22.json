        "text": "Every NFL fanbase starts the season with renewed hope, and the Dallas Cowboys may have the biggest fanbase — as illustrated by attendance numbers.\n\nThe Cowboys have dominated NFL attendance since 2009, attracting more than a million fans annually, according to ESPN rankings. In 2023, 1.3 million fans traveled to watch the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium and on the road.\n\nThe New York Giants placed second in 2023 for attendance, with just over 1.2 million fans.\n\nEl Pasoan Jaime Garcia created Dallas Cowboy Fan Club 915, a group with dozens of diehard fans.\n\nWhile the fan club gathers in lively watch parties at local spots, Garcia said there's nothing like visiting AT&T Stadium, a visit he's made countless times.\n\n\"I refer to it as God's house because of the hole in the roof — even though it's retractable,\" Garcia said with a laugh. \"It's a big deal to visit Jerry World — it's a billion-dollar facility.\"\n\nHere's how much it could cost to watch the Dallas Cowboys play in person:\n\nWhere is the Dallas Cowboys stadium?\n\nThe $1.2 billion AT&T Stadium is in Arlington, Texas.\n\nWhere to find the 2024 Dallas Cowboys schedule\n\nThe Dallas 2024 season schedule can be found on the team's official website. It is also available as a downloadable version for printing.\n\nMore: Former Cowboys RB, Super Bowl VI champion Duane Thomas dies at 77\n\nHow much do Dallas Cowboys tickets cost?\n\nTicket prices vary from $25 for standing room to more than $1,000 for seats closer to the field.\n\nTickets went on sale in May, shortly after the NFL released the regular season schedule.\n\nSeveral months later, there is only standing room available on the team's official site — and marked-up resale tickets.\n\nFor Dallas' preseason game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Aug. 24, pricing starts at $25 for standing room, and the cost nearly triples for its Thanksgiving game against the New York Giants at $65 a ticket for standing room, according to Seat Geek, the online ticket seller for the official Dallas Cowboys website.\n\nResale tickets get a little tricker to find — and pricier.\n\nBefore purchasing, Ticketmaster warns ticket prices may be higher than face value. The listing price is determined by the seller, which includes fans, season ticket holders, and professional resellers, according to its website.\n\nTickets for the Cowboys' first preseason game cost $662 for seats near the field and $150 or more for seats in the middle of the stadium.\n\nFor more popular games — like Dallas' Thanksgiving game — fans will pay between $1,000 and $1,300 per ticket for seats near the field, while sections towards the back of the stadium cost an average of about $250.\n\nThis doesn't include those resale fees, which include a service fee, order processing fee, delivery fee and facility fee.\n\nHow much will airfare cost?\n\nAs most flyers know, airfare can vary drastically depending on the flight's month, day and time.\n\nOn the travel website Expedia, a roundtrip from El Paso to Dallas in August, September, or October could cost travelers upwards of $300 roundtrip per person, while prices around Thanksgiving cost more than $400 on average.\n\nHotels near AT&T Stadium\n\nThe good news for Dallas fans is that there are several hotels around AT&T Stadium, and nightly rates seem to be stable throughout the year.\n\nPrices range from about $60 a night at nearby Motel 6 — only a five-minute walk from the stadium — to just over $200 a night at the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center, also within walking distance."
