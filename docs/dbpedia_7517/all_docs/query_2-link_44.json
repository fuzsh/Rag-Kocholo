        "text": "It’s no great trick to find a new apartment complex under construction in Arlington where multifamily occupancy is at a red-hot 94%, but few of those attract as much attention as One Rangers Way. It’s being built smack in the middle of the Entertainment District on the banks of Mark Holtz Lake.\n\nThe partners in the project, Cordish Companies and the Texas Rangers, are making a multimillion dollar bet that some people will relish living a three-minute walk from Globe Life Field or two blocks from AT&T Stadium. Or across the street from the soon-to-open National Medal of Honor Museum or the Arlington Museum of Art. It’s also a quick 20-minute commute to either Fort Worth or Dallas via nearby Interstate 30.\n\nThey’re also wagering that those future residents will be both willing and capable of paying above-market rates for the privilege of living steps away from a Rangers or Cowboys game, or maybe a Stevie Nicks concert. It’s not uncommon for the Entertainment District to host 100,000 or more assorted eventgoers at the area’s various venues in a day.\n\nIt’s definitely not a low-traffic environment, but for the sports enthusiast, it’s a bonanza. Besides the Rangers and Cowboys, nearby Choctaw Stadium — a 100-yard walk from the apartments — hosts pro rugby, soccer and UFL football, as well as assorted high school and collegiate football games.\n\nNot that One Rangers Way is an untried concept. See existing Cordish enterprises like One Cardinal Way in St. Louis next to Busch Stadium, or One Light, Two Light and Three Light in downtown Kansas City.\n\nOne Rangers Way basics: It’s 300 units and eight stories — that’s skyscraper height in vertically challenged Arlington — with both furnished and unfurnished units ranging from 444-square-foot studios to one-and-two-bedroom units, and a cluster of eight almost 1,500-square-foot primo penthouses on the top three floors. A sweeping pool and recreation area is a nicely private four floors up. Practically every amenity is named after some famous Texas Rangers ballplayer, and the artwork scattered through the complex will be decidedly baseball oriented. It’s all somewhat hotel-like, less the room service.\n\nThe price tag will not be insignificant. The smallest studio rent starts, in apartment marketing parlance, in the $1,500s, and from there the monthly tab escalates up to the $4,000s for those penthouses. Plus a $500 deposit. Plus an application fee. Plus renters insurance. Plus another $500 if the prospective tenant wants to bring Fido along, with leases running anywhere from six months to two years. And no, utilities are not included. Parking is in an attached multilevel garage and, yes, there’s space for guests. There’s a boatload of amenities worth checking out.\n\nDon’t load the U-Haul just yet. Though leasing is underway and there’s a demo unit, actual move-in residency won’t start until mid-January, presumably after the Rangers win a second World Series but before the Cowboys begin playoffs enroute to the Super Bowl — hypothetically. Or optimistically.\n\nJust by way of reference, the average apartment monthly cost in Arlington in 2023 was $1,254, though that number has been increasing about 10% annually the last two or three years — 94% occupancy is really more like 10%, the remaining 6% being mostly the occupancy churn of a highly transient society, of which Arlington is solidly representative.\n\nIt’s Nicholle Soendker’s job to market One Rangers Way, and she is bullish about the project.\n\n“It’s really created for the ultimate Rangers fan and, of course, our location is key,” Soendker, marketing director for Cordish Living Residential, said. “The proximity to three iconic stadiums, and with all the entertainment that goes on at Texas LIVE!, the great dining and nightlife options, you can’t beat the location.”\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Entertainment District, Texas LIVE!, adjacent to Globe Life Field, is a massive restaurant, nightclub and event venue in its own right, including the Arlington Backyard (5,000 capacity).\n\nWho’ll live in One Rangers Way? That remains to be seen. But, for the well-heeled, a unit would be handy for in-and-out temporary residency — a weekend retreat at the games or to attend a concert sort of thing. No doubt some Rangers or other sports venue players would find the location seasonally ideal. It seems logical that some corporate leases will take place. And then there are just people with deeper-than-average pockets attracted to a mixed bag of sports, dining and cultural happenings with a quick commute time to other metroplex locations.\n\nJust how all that will unfold won’t be known until construction — still underway — is completed and that mid-January move-in day finally takes place.\n\nO.K.
