        "text": "Edward Jones Dome – stadium description\n\nThe stadium built for $280 million is a multifunctional arena with permanent roof, incorporated into a larger commercial complex. It was built primarily to secure an NFL franchise for Saint Louis. Opened in 1995, it provides various configurations thanks to removable football pitch platform, seeing maximum capacity at 70,000 (66,000 for American football).\n\nIn 2009 the stadium saw new LED giant screens instead of old ones. That same year hospitality zone and skyboxes were rev amped. Part of the stadium also received new paintwork, making it more in tune with Saint Louis Rams colours. In 2011 new HD screens were mounted around the stadium.\n\nIn 2008 the stadium was fund NFL’s worst ground in a fans’ vote. Then in 2012 Time magazine ranked it one of the worst stadiums across the US.\n\nCurrently talks are ongoing about rebuilding the stadium completely or building a new one for St. Louis Rams. The city hopes to retain its franchise in the NFL, though the competition is very stiff."
