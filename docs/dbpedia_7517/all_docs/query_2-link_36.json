        "text": "Amidst the lively ambiance of Alamo Drafthouse within City Foundry STL, industry leaders convened for the MWM STL 2024 Adaptive Reuse & Redevelopment event on May 8, 2024.\n\nThe 15-acre site is a prime example of innovative adaptive reuse and redevelopment, featuring many diverse entertainment spaces, retail outlets, and nearly completed apartments with attached garages. The dynamic mixed-use project includes attractions beyond the Alamo Drafthouse; including Puttshack golf, a clandestine speakeasy, an immersive Sandbox VR experience, retail shops, its own Food Hall consisting of 17 restaurants, City Winery and more.\n\nIt was home to the Midtown St. Louis manufacturing hub and then purchased by the Century Electric motor manufacturing company almost 100 years ago. Work continued on a nearly 24-hour basis until 2007.\n\nThe event included a chance to see such projects in real-time through a tour of One Foundry Way, led by Todd Rogan of Lawrence Group.\n\nAlice Benner, CEO of the Artori Group, moderated insights from Sam Adler, director of development, New + Found; Joel Fuoss, AIA, IIDA, LEED AP, principal, Trivers; Greg Gleicher, founder, Good Developments Group; Michael Hamburg, owner, Pier Property Group; Jassen Johnson, founder, Onyx Development; and Matthew Stack, president-St. Louis, Russell.\n\n“The number of buildings going from office to apartments is increasing across the country,” Benner said. Reuse and redevelopment can be key to reviving both neighborhoods and individual properties, panelists agreed.\n\n“To build a long-term, self-sustaining neighborhood, you have to think holistically,” said Johnson. “You have to have residential density, you have to have vibrancy, restaurants, and businesses.”\n\nJohnson’s company has succeeded with several adaptive reuse and redevelopment projects in the city’s central core that he said can be applied to downtown. “You have to figure out office to residential as a model,” he said. “You have to shift to make creative, flexible spaces.”\n\nAccording to Adler, City Foundry has done just that. “The intent was to be a catalytic development to spur activity in the neighborhood,” he said. “We are creating an ecosystem. We’ve caught up to the trend in the central city.”\n\nSuch projects tend to attract a younger demographic, Adler noted.\n\nFor Hamburg, the focus is to “reuse and grow up.” These projects, he said, “Both have challenges and are rewarding.”\n\nHamburg has found that “You have to be more upfront with planning reuse to rebirth a building.” Since reuse involves properties that already exist, “from a financial standpoint, there shouldn’t be a ton of unknowns that you have with a ground-up project. Older buildings have a lot to offer.” Benefits can include solid construction and long-lasting materials, although many such projects do require extensive updates for code compliance and current safety regulations.\n\nThe Historic Tax Credit program can offset contingencies and challenges, Hamburg noted.\n\nThe increasingly popular conversion of office buildings to multifamily use has costs, Stack warned, with different population centers driving various projects. “It’s a monster challenge to change offices into apartments. You can’t just pencil it in.”\n\nChallenges aside, “We need visionaries in our city to do this,” said Stack.\n\nSt. Louis has a major asset as a power structure, according to Gleicher. “You have to figure out a smart way to use typical types of structures for atypical pairing up with funding sources and incentives that can be leveraged.”\n\nPositioning himself as the optimist on the panel, Fuoss said he thinks of reuse and redevelopment as “an opportunity from the cost perspective — you have to be prepared for unknowns (even with existing structures). You have to make the project attractive (to area residents, funders, businesses, and more).”\n\nEchoing colleagues, Fuoss said that St. Louis buildings have “superstructures and envelopes that are quite robust,” but that developers still “have to ask about what-ifs.”\n\nFuoss cited the AT&T Tower as an example of when it’s smart to wait before taking on a major adaptive reuse project. Reinventing the building for residential use would be a huge undertaking, in large part to deal with asbestos remediation, so the current plan is to “leave it as is for now and tackle other things (in the area). It has to become a mixed-use structure, but it doesn’t have to be done today.”\n\nJohnson agreed, especially because “downtown rent rates are half what they were 10 years ago. The best option might be to (let some buildings) sit there until that situation improves. Rents are what drive momentum (in development).”\n\nThoughtful planning is also an important factor — it isn’t possible to raise capital without that. “You can’t take a project that doesn’t work and make it into one that does,” Gleicher said. “You have to have one that’s good already.”\n\nAsked about the value of Opportunity Zones in planning reuse/redevelopment projects, panelists agreed that such incentives can be invaluable — and can be seen in action in St. Louis. “The Butler Building is the poster child for what Opportunity Zones were intended for,” Adler said.\n\nSustainability is also important and often requires understanding the requirements of the National Park Service. “You have to look at the embodied carbon footprint of buildings and the impact on the environment,” Fuoss said. “Having a building already in place has a huge positive effect on sustainability.”\n\n“Sustainability is interesting,” said Gleicher. “It’s not only environmental; it’s financial: a project has to generate enough money to create revenue.” Responding to current sustainability and environmental guidelines adds to the cost of a project involving new ways to use older buildings that went up when such concerns were not considered.\n\nGleicher cited his company’s Gateway South project as an example of “an opportunity to build a microsystem that can be sustained over time.”\n\nContemporary demands on utilities are another factor to prepare for in converting commercial properties into residential ones, said Hamburg. “You’re typically taking out every mechanical element — the veins of a building — to create a smart building. You have to accommodate new building codes and regulations, and the team needs to understand that. The key is to assemble that team ahead of time — you can’t do it in a vacuum.”\n\nAnother factor can be demanded from funding sources or government programs to “meet unreasonable asks about using historic materials,” Johnson warned. “You have to think smarter.”\n\nAdler said it’s time for a “call to action to rewrite the statues for historical preservation program” with that in mind.\n\nPanelists agreed that getting neighborhood buy-in for an adaptive reuse or redevelopment project can be key to its success. “It’s step 1 or 1-A,” Hamburg said. “You have to meet people early on.”\n\nThe good news is that “St. Louis has been great in supporting projects in the city,” said Gleicher. “People want redevelopment. We should be proud of that.”\n\n“We need to toot our horn and tout projects that work,” said Stack.\n\nAs Johnson said, “We have to figure out how to make lemonade out of lemons.”\n\nIn fact, “We are uniquely positioned to make a positive impact,” Benner said in wrapping up the session.\n\nThe St. Louis region is in good shape and offers worthwhile opportunities for commercial real estate, according to speakers at a February 13 CCIM-STL meeting at the Meridien Hotel about “Why St. Louis?”\n\nJim Fredericks, partner in luncheon sponsor Armstrong Teasdale, set the tone for the program by saying, “I believe in St. Louis, and I believe in what we can do for St. Louis.”\n\nDoug Rasmussen, founder and CEO of Steadfast City Economic & Community Partners, noted that his focus on site selection benefits from the interconnections among all 15 St. Louis counties, and that assumptions about the airport are not a big deal: “The lack of an airport hub isn’t that important,” he said. “We have parity in travel prices,” so business travelers have fewer concerns when planning trips.\n\nThe St. Louis region can “line up well in risk management,” Rasmussen said. “We can serve the globe from one location. We have diverse options for the supply chain. We have a reliable infrastructure, including weather. We have an industrial heritage and sites that can be redeveloped. We can provide a talent supply chain from the shop floor to the C-suite.”\n\nThe region does need more tech workers and residents in general, he noted.\n\n“The challenge for real estate professionals is to think of St. Louis as unique and focus on what’s in our own backyard for all aspects of what a company might need,” Rasmussen said.\n\nFor Maggie Kost, chief attraction officer at Greater St. Louis, Inc., promoting St. Louis to potential new businesses is “truly a team sport.”\n\nHer organization primarily focuses on companies in advanced manufacturing (automotive, aerospace, and food and beverage), agtech, bioscience and health, digital transformation, financial and business services, and geospatial. The span of industries and occupations is “an asset for spouses when [a business owner] is relocating here,” she said.\n\nKost and her team present St. Louis as “a place to start up, stand out, and stay.” St. Louisans “are hard on ourselves, and we shouldn’t be,” she added.\n\nShe noted that the metro St. Louis region is ranked as number one in the Mississippi River corridor. “We are putting St. Louis on the global stage,” she said. That’s due to the area’s “transport modal hub, great culture, affordable housing and minimal commutes,” among other qualities.\n\nCommercial real estate professionals would benefit from thinking of Greater St. Louis, Inc. as “a resource and part of your team,” Kost said.\n\nRobert (Bob) Millstone, president and founder of the The Millstone Company, outlined the ways that the Gateway South project, a 100-acre master-planned redevelopment along the riverfront, aims to enhance St. Louis as number one in construction innovation. It will be “a walkable, mixed-use downtown focused on cross-pollination,” Millstone said, at a total estimate cost of $1.2 billion.\n\nPhase 1 is expected to be complete in two years, with work scheduled to begin in March, Millstone said — an impressive goal. It already has $200 million in incentives and $25 million in out-of-town investments, as well as “real local manufacturing companies that will anchor the project.”\n\nReflecting on the history of the area, “we’re excited about the next 100 years,” Millstone said.\n\nKost also noted that the St. Louis area’s colleges and universities contribute substantially to the region’s appeal to new and existing businesses and nonprofit organizations as “tremendously important for filling the talent pipeline and innovating.”\n\nMillstone added that “we also have to keep tech training in mind”; not just area universities but also institutions like Rankin Tech and the offerings of the community college system.\n\nKost agreed: “A lot of people don’t realize there are a lot of community college programs for retraining. It’s all set up to address (business) needs. The community colleges and Rankin understand (what companies need).”\n\nAnother key to the region’s future, according to Rasmussen, will be promoting its “cool factor — making it an area that young people want to go to (and stay in). It’s mostly a matter of making (our advantages) known.”\n\nImmigration trends also work in favor of St. Louis, panelists agreed. “It’s very important for us that St. Louis has always been really good at welcoming immigrants,” Kost said, while Rasmussen said that “my lens as a site selector is that St. Louis is not as well-known as we could be (in this respect) — it’s important to make (us) more of a landing place for new Americans.”\n\nThe same things that attract new companies and people to the area are a factor in retaining graduates and employees, Kost said.\n\nMillstone identified the role of commercial real estate professionals as creating jobs for the future and convincing potential new businesses and residents that “this is a good place to live, work and play.” Being “ambassadors for the region” is also a vital role for the profession.\n\n“Projects have to integrate with what leaders and the community want,” Millstone added.\n\nThat perspective fits with plans for the Greenway project, which Kost called “incredibly important in quality of life and an asset in connectivity and bridging the divide.” It can also be promoted as a tourist attraction, Rasmussen said.\n\nThe session wrapped up with perspectives on downtown. “Downtown is incredibly important,” Kost said. “We have locations (that are ideal for) industrial reuse, office space that is very affordable compared to other areas. We’re making sure that we have the tools for redeveloping spaces (so employees will want to come back to offices).”\n\nThe answer to “Why St. Louis?” comes down to recognizing that “we’re a region and we live and die as a region,” Millstone said. “St. Louis can be a success, downtown can be a success, but we have to invest.”"
