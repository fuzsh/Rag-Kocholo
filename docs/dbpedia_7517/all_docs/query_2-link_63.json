For Razorback Stadium, a new north end zone expansion is in progress which includes new LED video displays, broadcast provisions, club rooms, suite, concourse and locker room areas audio/video systems. At Bud Walton Arena, three control rooms were constructed with a shared equipment room, one studio, an audio booth, a slow motion replay room, a camera shade room and an extensive video editing/archiving component. Key to the project was working with the campus to obtain the necessary fiber optic infrastructure and venue production cabling to connect the control room to the football stadium and a number of venues around campus including baseball, softball, soccer, gymnastics, volleyball, indoor track and outdoor track. Fiber optic equipment was specified to light up the infrastructure in order for a centralized production to occur for each venue.

The Campus Crossroads project was completed in the fall of 2017 and brought to the stadium most notably, new premium seats and the venue’s first-ever video board. As part of the renovation the project included three buildings adjacent to the stadium, creating 750,000 square feet of academic offices, classrooms and hospitality space. The Stadium’s East side Martin Media Center has two video production rooms equipped for national network\n\ngrade broadcast with a third smaller room to facilitate slow motion and smaller shows. There are two surround sound equipped audio mixing rooms to compliment the network grade broadcasts. These control areas are supported by a centralized rack room. These control areas interface to several sports and academic venues across campus via a ground breaking Evetz EXE IP Router. This facility takes advantage of state of the art IP technology to facility audio and video over IP enabling an previously unheard-of level of flexibility in remote venue production. The University of Notre Dame also boast three independent studios, one dedicated to athletics, one dedicated to large campus productions, and one to teaching and one to student originated production.

Of course the locker and training rooms are equipped with significant sound systems, driven from a variety of sound choices. Within the public spaces, WJHW designed the displays and sound systems for the themed display components. The team meeting room and auditorium were refreshed with new displays and sound systems.
