        "text": "44-story skyscraper in downtown St. Louis\n\nThe Beacon on Chestnut (stylized as THE BEACON on Chestnut, formerly One SBC Center, One Bell Center, One AT&T Center, and 909 Chestnut) is a 44-story building in downtown St. Louis, Missouri at 909 Chestnut Street on the Gateway Mall. It is Missouri's largest building by area with 1,400,000 square feet (130,000 m2).[5] The building is currently vacant.[6]\n\nThe building was built to replace the Southwestern Bell Building as the Southwestern Bell world headquarters. However, in a series of mergers, the headquarters moved to San Antonio, Texas and was later renamed AT&T.\n\nIn 2006 Inland American Real Estate Trust bought the building for $205 million. AT&T then signed a 10-year lease to be the sole tenant.[7]\n\nWhen AT&T announced, in 2013, that they would be vacating the building in 12 months and that they would be not be renewing the lease when it expired in 2017, the number of employees in that building had fallen from a high of 4,800 to 2,000 through layoffs, outsourcing and remote work.[8]\n\nThe building was ultimately foreclosed by US Bank after AT&T's departure and, on April 25, 2022, the building was sold for $4.05 million to SomeraRoad, a New Yorkâ€“based developer.[6] SomeraRoad later held an auction for the building in December 2023. It was sold an entity tied to the Boston-based Goldman Group for $3.6 million[9] in early April 2024. It is unclear what Goldman Group's plan is for the building at this time.[10]"
