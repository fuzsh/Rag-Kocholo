Listen to All I Do Is Win, the latest track from DJ Khaled, featuring Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, And T-Pain. The cut dropped on Monday, February 1st, 2010. DJ Khaled's future brightens with every new release, and All I Do Is Win certainly isn't an exception. It's a fitting addition to a solid catalogue that DJ Khaled has been developing since stepping foot in the game. We're excited to hear more.

Quotable Lyrics

"All I do is win win win no matter what

Got money on my mind, I can never get enough

And every time I step up in the building

Everybody hands go UP

And they stay there, and they stay there

And they stay there - up down up down up down

Cause all I do is WIN, WIN, WIN

And if you goin in put yo' hands in the air, make 'em stay there!"
