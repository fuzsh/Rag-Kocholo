        "text": "That's a wrap on the 66th annual Grammy Awards! And, let me tell you, they had everything.\n\nThere was drama. (See: Jay-Z clapping back at the Recording Academy for snubbing his wife Beyoncé.) There was shock. (Thank you for the new album announcement, Taylor Swift!) And there were tears. (Joni Mitchell, we don't deserve you.)\n\nKiller Mike was led out of the Crypto.com Arena in handcuffs, while Swift also made history as the first person to win album of the year four times. And Lainey Wilson, Miley Cyrus and Karol G claimed their first Grammys on music's biggest night.\n\nHere are the biggest updates, along with our unfiltered reactions of the awards show on CBS.\n\nYou know, I’m starting to think karma may really be her boyfriend. Nothing seems to get in the way of Taylor Swift's total music (and world) domination. The artist became the first person to win album of the year four times. “I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life, but I feel this happy when I finish a song,” she said, noting she was feeling \"mind blown.\" “For me, the award is the work.” She accepted the honor from Céline Dion, who made a surprise appearance as presenter following her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis. “I really mean it from my heart: Those that have been blessed enough to be here… must never take for granted the tremendous love and joy that music brings to our lives and to people all around the world,” Dion said.\n\nMore: Taylor Swift makes Grammys history with fourth album of the year win for 'Midnights'\n\nMiley Cyrus clearly doesn’t take herself, or awards shows, too seriously, and it’s honestly so refreshing. After her fun, lively and seemingly Tina-Turner-inspired performance of “Flowers,” she returned to claim the trophy for record of the year for the same song. In her speech, she reminded everyone that, even though not everyone can win a Grammy, everyone is “spectacular” and trophies don’t define success. (Are you listening, Jay-Z?) After some quick thank you’s, she quipped: “I don’t think I forgot anyone, but I might have forgotten underwear. Bye!”\n\nMore: Miley Cyrus just won the first Grammy of her career\n\nEarlier, she spoke on behalf of all Los Angeles residents when she confessed she almost missed her first ever Grammys win due to heavy rain traffic. “This is just too iconic,” she said onstage beside Mariah Carey, accepting the award for best pop solo performance for “Flowers.\" “I just got stuck in the rain in traffic and thought I was going to miss this moment.” Anybody who has ever braved an LA freeway during a light drizzle knows exactly what she’s talking about.\n\nWhile accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, Jay-Z used his acceptance speech to call out the Recording Academy's snubs against his wife, Beyoncé. \"We love y'all. We want y'all to get it right,\" he said. \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\" Though the Bey-Hive will surely eat this moment up, it's hard to feel much sympathy for a mega-wealthy, mega-awarded artist complaining at an awards show that his wife − also a mega-wealthy, mega-awarded artist − is actually entitled to more trophies.\n\nMore: Jay-Z calls out Grammys over Beyoncé snubs: 'We want y'all to get it right'\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is what the Grammys – and, dare I say, music itself – is all about. The most powerful moment of the broadcast came in the most simple, elegant performance of the night – something that’s become an unfortunate rarity at a show that tends to favor big dance numbers and pyrotechnics. Sitting in a regal chair and singing her soaring, timeless song “Both Sides, Now,” Joni Mitchell transported the Crypto.com Arena, and all of us watching at home, to a different place entirely. She sang with humility, grace and, most of all, a deep, deep love for music. It was moving. It was honest. It was unifying. It was everything a Grammys performance should be. Not to mention it was her first time performing at the ceremony ever too!\n\nDuring the premiere ceremony, Mitchell, 80, who suffered a brain aneurysm in 2015 that left her temporarily unable to walk or talk won for best folk album for \"Joni Mitchell at Newport (Live).\" Walking out onto the stage with a cane, Mitchell beamed at the crowd before giving a brief, humble thank you.\n\nMore: Joni Mitchell, 80, offers a stunning 'Both Sides, Now' for first Grammys performance\n\nVictoria Monét won best new artist, beating out fellow nominees Gracie Abrams, Fred again, Jelly Roll, Coco Jones and Noah Kahan. Born Victoria Monét McCants, the artist came into the ceremony with seven Grammy nominations — behind only SZA with nine — and in the pre-show awards, she won best R&B album and best engineered album for \"Jaguar II\" but lost traditional R&B performance to PJ Morton.\n\nThe In Memoriam segment, usually a somber montage honoring artists who've died, turned into a rousing concert, closing out with a lively tribute to Tina Turner, intro'd by Oprah Winfrey and ending with high-energy performance of \"Proud Mary\" by Fantasia. The number got everyone on their feet, and the energy could be felt through the screen. Detractors will surely say the segment should have been more subdued, but no one can deny Fantasia put on a good show.\n\nAnother potentially controversial In Memoriam moment? Annie Lennox ending her tribute to Sinéad O'Connor with a reference to the war between Israel and Palestine. \"Artists for ceasefire! Peace in the world!\" she exclaimed after her song.\n\nLeave it to Taylor Swift to zig when we all thought she would zag. After seeming to tease the re-recording of her album “Reputation” with a website crash earlier today, she ended up revealing she’s dropping a new album entirely instead. “This is my 13th Grammy, which is my lucky number,” Swift said, after winning best pop vocal album for “Midnights. “I know the way the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans. So I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the last two years, which is that my brand new album comes out April 19. It’s called 'The Tortured Poets Department.' I’m gonna go and post the cover right now backstage.\" Well, OK then!\n\nMore: Taylor Swift announces brand-new album at Grammys: 'Tortured Poets Department'\n\nLainey Wilson joined Karol G and Miley Cyrus in the Grammy first-timers club. During her acceptance speech for best country album for \"Bell Bottom Country,\" Wilson, a fifth generation farmer's daughter from a town of 200, gave a winding extended metaphor about how making an album is a lot like farming, or something like that. “Sometimes when you find the right farming community, you can find the harvest of a lifetime,\" she said. I have never farmed before, but I trust her completely.\n\nKiller Mike's triumphant run at the Grammys took a turn after the rapper was handcuffed. Shortly after winning three awards during the pre-show ceremony, he was escorted out of the Crypto.com arena in handcuffs by a squad of police officers, video shared by The Hollywood Reporter's Chris Gardner on X shows. It's unclear if the rapper was arrested or will return for the live ceremony. USA TODAY has reached out to reps for Killer Mike, the Recording Academy and the Los Angeles Police Department. Killer Mike won Grammys for best rap song and best rap performance for his song \"Scientists and Engineers\" and best rap album for \"Michael.\"\n\nMore: Killer Mike escorted out of Grammys in handcuffs after winning 3 awards\n\nLet's go, Karol G! The Colombian singer and songwriter became a first-time Grammy winner, taking home the trophy for best música urbana album for her album \"Mañana Será Bonito.\" \"I promise you to give you my best always, and I hope this is the first of so many,\" she said onstage. It's been less than an hour, and we've already seen career firsts for two major artists. At this rate, who knows what will else will happen?\n\nAt the Golden Globes, you could practically hear a pin drop when host Jo Koy made a joke about the frequent Taylor Swift cutaways at NFL games. That joke didn't seem to land with the pop star then, who took a cold sip from her cup while staring daggers at the comedian. Lucky for Trevor Noah, Swift seemed to have found her sense of humor in time for the Grammys, laughing when he joked that every time he mentions Swift's name, the broadcast should cut to a former NFL player. The camera then focused on a befuddled Terry Crews. Noah stayed mostly complimentary throughout his opening monologue. Was he pandering a little to the A-listers? Sure, but it was no disaster, which, in the realm of award shows, should be counted as a win.\n\nApparently not. Swift's website crashed Sunday afternoon for about two hours, and Swifties believed the site was riddled with Easter eggs teasing the long-anticipated announcement of the re-release of her sixth album \"Reputation (Taylor's Version).\" Swift's website appeared to show an error message hours before the Grammys. The first line was \"Error 321 Backend fetch failed.\" (Error 321 is a communication error that would appear on a fax machine with a poor telephone line connection.) \"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now\" is a line from Swift's track \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" the lead single on \"Reputation.\" Turns out, however, Swift had other plans, announcing an entirely new album instead.\n\nWith his win for best producer of the year, non-classical, Jack Antonoff joined Babyface as the only person to win the category three times in a row. During his acceptance speech, which rounded out the premiere ceremony, Antonoff thanked his wife Margaret Qualley and others who have supported him in his career, including his collaborator Taylor Swift. \"We made a song called 'Out of the Woods' for '1989,' and, when I was waiting for that call that says, 'OK, now this goes to some big-name person,' she said, 'Let's mix this...,' \" he said. \"I love you to death, Taylor.\"\n\nThat’s double-Grammy-winner Michelle Obama to you! The former first lady took home the Grammy for best audio book, narration and storytelling recording for “The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times.” It’s the second time she’s won a Grammy (she won in 2020 for \"Becoming), making her the only former first lady with two wins.\n\nIt’s the calm before the storm inside the massive white tent housing the Grammys red carpet, anyway. Outside, the downpour that meteorologists have promised all week has commenced. We are in the sweet spot on the carpet between artists attending the Grammys pre-show and the televised ceremony, and a few notable faces, including Josh Groban, boygenius and Victoria Monét, have made quick appearances. With two hours to go until the ceremony, things are certain to start heating up soon. –KiMi Robinson\n\nThe Beatles may have broken up about five decades ago, but they still can’t stop winning Grammys! The group won best music video at the premiere ceremony for their 1966 song “I’m Only Sleeping,” which got an official music video in November 2022. “I can’t believe I get to say this: I’d like to thank John, Paul, George and Ringo!” the video’s director Em Cooper exclaimed in her acceptance speech.\n\nWhat was that? You thought the Barbenheimer double features had finally come to an end? Well, think again: “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” which dominated theaters last summer, won back-to-back at the Grammys premiere ceremony. “Barbie the Album” won best compilation soundtrack for visual media and “Oppenheimer” for best score soundtrack for visual media. Billie Eilish and Finneas also made an early appearance to accept their award for best song written for visual media for their “Barbie” song “What Was I Made For?” “Making this song saved me a little bit,” Eilish said of the soft ballad in their acceptance speech.\n\nWell, that got started with a bang! If downtown Los Angeles was feeling sleepy amid this uncharacteristic rain, it better be awake now after the opening number of the premiere ceremony. J. Ivy, Pentatonix, Larkin Poe, Jordin Sparks and Sheila E. took the stage for a rousing set that seemed to jolt the theater awake, ending with a booming drum solo from Sheila E. while Sparks belted for her life. Let’s hope that energy lasts, because the Grammy ceremonies are going to unfold over for the course of the next nine hours."
