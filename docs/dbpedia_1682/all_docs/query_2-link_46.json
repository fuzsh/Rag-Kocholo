        "text": "Taylor Swift took home the award for album of the year at the 2024 Grammys on Sunday night and made history.\n\nThe singer was nominated alongside World Music Radio (Jon Batiste), the record (Boygenius), Endless Summer Vacation (Miley Cyrus), Did You Know That There‘s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd (Lana Del Rey),The Age of Pleasure (Janelle Monáe), Guts (Olivia Rodrigo) and SOS (SZA).\n\nThe award was presented by Céline Dion, who made a surprise appearance amid her health battle with stiff-person syndrome.\n\nA visibly shocked Swift was quick to express her disbelief when taking the stage with longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff and singer Lana Del Rey.\n\n“I don’t know, man. I get to work with one of my best friends, who is not only one of my best friends but is a once-in-a-generation producer that’s Jack Antonoff. I’m so lucky,” she said of Antonoff.\n\nShe also gave a shout-out to Rey, who is featured on the Midnights song “Snow on the Beach,” describing her as a “legacy artist” and “a legend in her prime right now.” “I’m so lucky to know you and to be your friend,” Swift said to the singer.\n\nThough already achieving an array of accolades, Swift explained how winning an award equates to the same excited feelings she has when making music and working.\n\n“I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life. But I feel this happy when I finish a song or when I crack the code to a bridge that I love or when i’m shotlisting a music video or when i’m rehearsing with my dancers or with my band or getting ready to go to Tokyo to play a show,” she said as she’s set to continue her Eras Tour overseas.\n\nSwift went on to say that to her “the award is the work. All I want to do is keep being able to do this. I love it so much. It makes me so happy. It makes me unbelievably blown away that it makes so many people happy who voted for this award too. All I want to do is keep doing this. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to do what I love so much. Mind blown, thank you so much!”\n\nWith the album of the year win, Swift makes history as the first performer to win album of the year four times. Swift previously won album of the year three times for her albums Fearless in 2010 — she surpassed Alanis Morissette as the category’s youngest victor at 20 years old — 1989 in 2015 and folklore in 2021.\n\nSwift and Adele are the only women to have taken home an award in this category more than once, with Adele winning for albums 21 and 25. Meanwhile, Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon have also won the album of the year award three times.\n\nAhead of the ceremony, Swift was nominated for six Grammys, including for best pop vocal album for Midnights, best pop solo performance for “Anti-Hero” and best pop duo/group performance for “Karma” with Ice Spice, who was up for best new artist.\n\nAfter winning for best pop vocal album, Swift announced that she was going to release a new album in April called The Tortured Poet’s Department.\n\nFor this year’s Grammys, female acts make up seven of the eight nominees in the top three categories — with SZA leading with nine overall nominations, followed by Swift, Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus and Boygenius with six nods apiece. Eilish, Dua Lipa and Rodrigo were among the musicians who took the stage at the ceremony."
