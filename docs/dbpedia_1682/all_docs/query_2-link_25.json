        "text": "Topline\n\n“Oppenheimer” leads the Oscar nominations with 13 total, just one short of the most nominations for a film ever, and pundits and bettors have it pegged to win at least eight awards, which would place it firmly among the biggest Oscar winners of this century and of all time.\n\nKey Facts\n\nBig Number\n\n11. That’s the most Oscars that have ever been won by a single film, a record shared by “Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” (2003), “Titanic” (1997) and “Ben-Hur” (1959).\n\nKey Background\n\nOnly 15 films have ever won eight or more Oscars, and just two of them have been from this century. The last film to win eight Academy Awards was “Slumdog Millionaire” (2008), which won Best Picture—meaning “Oppenheimer” would become the biggest winner in 15 years if it wins that many awards or more. Last year’s biggest winner, “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” won seven Oscars from its 11 nominations, which is the biggest haul for a Best Picture winner to date since “Slumdog Millionaire.”\n\nContra\n\n“Oppenheimer” is not expected to win some of its nominations, including the Best Supporting Actress trophy for Emily Blunt. Most pundits are predicting Da’Vine Joy Randolph will take the award for “The Holdovers” after she swept awards season for her performance. Few expect any of the Production Design, Costume Design or Makeup and Hairstyling Oscars to go to “Oppenheimer.”\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nWhether “Oppenheimer” will pull off any surprise wins—or losses—on Sunday night. “American Fiction” is the favorite to win Best Adapted Screenplay, according to many predictions, but the betting odds on GoldDerby and DraftKings are tight, with “Oppenheimer” in second place on both. Some awards observers have also noted Paul Giamatti has an outside shot to win over Murphy for Best Actor for his performance in “The Holdovers.” The Los Angeles Times expects “Poor Things” to be the most likely winner for Production Design, but noted “Oppenheimer” could notch a surprise win.\n\nTangent\n\n“Oppenheimer” is not involved in what may be the most unpredictable major category of the night: Best Actress, which is considered a close race between Lily Gladstone for “Killers of the Flower Moon” and Emma Stone for “Poor Things.” The two actresses have spent awards season trading wins at the major award shows, with Stone besting Gladstone at the Critics Choice Awards and Gladstone winning over Stone at the SAG Awards. Most pundits, though, are predicting an Academy Award win for Gladstone, which would be her first Oscar and the first win for a Native American actress.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWhich Movies Have Won the Most Oscars?
