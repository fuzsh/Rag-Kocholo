        "text": "During the veepstakes of the past few weeks, both moderates and progressives have scrambled to claim Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as one of their own. As a member of Congress, Walz was certainly a man of the middle, and he has maintained plenty of moderate positions alongside progressive ones during his gubernatorial tenure; progressive stalwarts from Bernie Sanders to the United Auto Workers also gave him their stamp of approval.\n\nBut what matters most about Walz isn’t where he sits on the ideological scatterplot—it’s his distinctive approach to wielding political power, which he summed up concisely in a tweet from last June accompanying a sizzle reel celebrating the legislative successes of Minnesota Democrats.\n\nMinnesota is a distinctly purple state. Hillary Clinton barely squeaked it out in 2016 over Donald Trump, and those on Trump’s 2020 team believed that it was in reach for them in that cycle too. Its state government also reflects that near 50–50 split—and after the most recent 2022 elections, Minnesota Democrats headed into 2023 having won the governorship, a six-seat majority in the House, and just a one-seat majority in the Senate, which made for only the second Democratic trifecta in the past 20 years.\n\nIn delicate, swingy political environments like that, Democrats have tended to embrace extreme caution, fearful of upsetting the balance and provoking a conservative backlash that might hand control back to Republicans. Walz and his Democratic caucus did exactly the opposite.\n\nWith the narrowest of margins, Minnesota Dems went on an incredible legislative tear, passing bill after bill along largely partisan lines. In just one session, they passed a constitutional right to abortion, universal free breakfast and lunch for Minnesota schoolchildren, paid family and medical leave, the nation’s broadest right-to-repair law (legislation making it easier for people to fix appliances and electronics), free college for students from families making less than $80,000 a year, legal weed, increased taxes on corporations and people earning over $1 million on investments, prescription drug price reform, and more. A lot more! They have kept at it this year, outlawing junk fees.\n\nThat legendary legislative session was well documented in a Vanity Fair piece that features this memorable line: “Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman said Democrats’ attitude headed into 2023 was ‘LFG’—‘let’s fucking go.’ ” Democratic lawmakers played the DJ Khaled song “All I Do Is Win” in the House caucus room anytime they passed one of the 30 priorities on their lengthy wish list.\n\nNot everything stuck. Walz himself vetoed a ride-share driver pay and benefits bill that Uber and Lyft lobbied fiercely against.\n\nStill, that willingness to use all available political power to pursue the Democratic agenda—as Walz himself put it, to “burn political capital and improve lives”—was a serious break with Democratic orthodoxy. Rather than constantly reaching across the aisle trying to court Republicans and watering down Democratic legislation, rather than citing future elections as a reason Democrats couldn’t do something, they simply went about pursuing a popular and transformative agenda with the full force of their tiny majority.\n\nThat epic legislative output put Walz on the map nationally; it also put true-blue states like California and New York to shame. Despite having Democratic governors and supermajorities in their state Houses and Senates, neither California Gov. Gavin Newsom nor New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has seen a legislative output anywhere near what Walz and his Minnesota Democrats pulled off with zero votes to spare.\n\nCongress looks an awful lot like Minnesota: Democrats had tiny majorities in the House and Senate for the first two years of the Biden administration and lost the House thereafter. Even if Harris and Walz win in November, it’s unlikely they’ll have anything resembling a robust majority, given how gerrymandered and polarized the country’s House districts are.\n\nSo the margins to pursue Democratic legislation are going to be narrow, if they exist at all. Walz has shown that despite all that, Democrats have no reason to aim small, shy away from party-line triumphs, or govern scared of forthcoming elections. His political reputation is proof that there’s more upside in taking bold action than in searching for reasons not to. Whether he’s a moderate or a progressive, that’s a major contribution to the Democratic ticket."
