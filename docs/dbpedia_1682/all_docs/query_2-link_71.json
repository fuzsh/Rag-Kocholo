Nederlander, the Jimmy Awards see nominees partaking in a week of events, workshops, and master classes with industry professionals. The week culminates in the ceremony itself.\n\nThe 12 coaches who mentored the 102 high school student nominees throughout the course of the week included English Bernhardt, Janet Dacal, Colin Hanlon, MaryAnn Hu, Leonard Joseph, Adam Kantor, Telly Leung, Adam J. Levy, Desi Oakley, Eliseo Román, Steven Telsey, and EJ Zimmerman.\n\nSpecial guest presenters included Victoria Clark, Justin Cooley, Andrew Barth Feldman, and Ayana Jackson.\n\nThe panel of judges for the awards included Montego Glover, Kenny Leon, Joe Machota, Marc Platt, T.

Preliminary judges who evaluated and cast the nominees in various musical numbers for the ceremony included Gabriel Barre, Kristian Charbonier, Stephanie Klapper, Sammy Lopez, Kevin Metzger-Timson, and Dale Mott.\n\nThe Jimmy Awards are notorious for helping young performers get discovered—stars like Reneé Rapp, Andrew Barth Feldman, Jai’Len Josey, and Kyle Selig were all Jimmy winners before making their Broadway debut.\n\nREAD: 15 Jimmy Award Alums Who Are Now Theatre Favorites\n\nMonday's ceremony was directed by Van Kaplan and featured music supervision by Geoffrey Ko, choreography by Kiesha Lalama, and group direction and choreography by Luis Salgado.\n\nThe Jimmy Awards are presented by The Broadway League Foundation and Pittsburgh CLO, with livestream support provided by Apples and Oranges Arts."
