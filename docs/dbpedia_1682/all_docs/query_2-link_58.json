        "text": "March 11, 2024\n\nOppenheimer's Historic 7 Academy Awards\n\nIn a special night for Christopher Nolan, Universal Pictures, and the entire Oppenheimer team, the film led this year's slate of winners with 7 wins, tying The Sting (1973), Out of Africa (1985) and Schindler’s List (1993) for the most ever for a Universal film. Oppenheimer — which became the highest-ever grossing biopic at over $950 million worldwide — is also the highest grossing movie to win Best Picture since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2004), and the first to release theatrically in July since Forest Gump (1995).\n\nUniversal’s Donna Langley thanked many for their hard work leading to the \"eight pinch-me moments.\"\n\nIt [all] started with a visit to Chris and Emma’s home, back in 2021. Reading the script for Oppenheimer in Chris’s office, I was mesmerized as one of the most impactful moments in history felt overwhelmingly resonant today... Soon after, our entire Film group — and the entire company — rallied around this piece. From production to marketing to distribution, MSNBC to Peacock to our full Symphony effort, our teams came together to share this story and show what makes this company unique.\n\n— Donna Langley, Chairman, NBCUniversal Studio Group & Chief Content Officer\n\nSee the full list of Oppenheimer wins below.\n\nBest Picture\n\nOppenheimer – Emma Thomas, Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan, producers\n\nDirecting\n\nChristopher Nolan – Oppenheimer\n\nActor in a Leading Role\n\nCillian Murphy – Oppenheimer\n\nActor in a Supporting Role\n\nRobert Downey Jr. – Oppenheimer\n\nCinematography\n\nOppenheimer – Hoyte van Hoytema\n\nFilm Editing\n\nOppenheimer – Jennifer Lame\n\nOriginal Score\n\nOppenheimer – Ludwig Göransson\n\nIn the acceptance speech for Best Picture, producer Emma Thomas spoke to how much the award meant to her and the Oppenheimer team.\n\nI think any of us who make movies know that you kind of dream of this moment. You know you do, right? I could deny it, but have I been dreaming about this moment for so long.\n\n— Emma Thomas\n\nThe Holdovers Da’Vine Joy Randolph Wins Best Actress in a Supporting Role\n\nOppenheimer wasn’t the only Universal film to score a win. The Holdovers joined a historic group of Focus Features titles to win multiple Academy Awards, including Brokeback Mountain (2005), Milk (2009) and Dallas Buyers Club (2014).\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph won the award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her role as Mary Lamb, where she plays the head cook at an elite New England boarding school. In her acceptance speech, Randolph thanked her mother for encouraging her to try acting.\n\nMy mother said to me, go across the street to that theater department. There's something for you there.\n\n— Da’Vine Joy Randolph\n\nAbout Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The film also stars Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. The film was part of a historic cultural phenomenon that brought attention to the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer through the film itself as well as numerous collaborative NBC News specials and more. It is now streaming on Peacock, where it received 821 million streaming minutes in its first week.\n\nAbout The Holdovers"
