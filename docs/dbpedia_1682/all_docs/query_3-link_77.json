        "text": "When Eva Marcille joined The Real Housewives of Atlanta as a main cast member in Season 11, she was already quite comfortable behind the camera. Besides appearing as a RHOA friend in Season 10, the Los Angeles native was recognizable from her numerous TV and movie roles — including winning America's Next Top Model in 2004.\n\nStill, becoming a Bravolebrity was a journey of its own.\n\n\"Real Housewives is like no other beast,\" Eva told The Daily Dish in March 2018. \"It doesn't matter that I've done other shows or that I'm aware of the camera and cool with that. Like, Housewives and everything that comes with it — the women, the circumstances, the drama, the shade — it's like a whole 'nother world.\"\n\nEva began her career using her surname Pigford (Marcille is her middle name!), and her sheer beauty and talent have always been on display as she's pursued her passions. Keep reading to take a peek through Eva's career so far, her modeling, hosting, and acting gigs included.\n\nEva Marcille on America's Next Top Model\n\nEva's career was kickstarted when she won Season 3 of America's Next Top Model. As the 2004 champion of the Tyra Banks-hosted modeling competition, her prizes included a contract with CoverGirl cosmetics, an Elle Magazine spread, and a contract with Ford Models.\n\nIn 2018, Tyra brought Eva back to the ANTM world for a special throwback episode.\n\n\"I'm insanely obsessed. I am so proud of her. I mean, from Cycle 3 of America's Next Top Model, she has held her own and is doing her thing,\" Tyra gushed during a January 2018 episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. \"I know what she can do.\"\n\nEva Marcille's Modeling Career\n\nFollowing her ANTM win, Eva graced the covers of Brides Noir, Women's Health and Fitness, King, IONA, and Essence, among others. She also appeared in campaigns for CoverGirl, DKNY, Samsung, Avon, and Red by Marc Ecko and graced many a runway stage.\n\nDuring her first solo scene in RHOA Season 11 Episode 1, she took her family — including her now-estranged husband Michael Sterling, daughter Marley, and newborn son Mikey — to a photoshoot.\n\nRELATED: Sterling Sweeties! Eva Marcille's Children Are Absolutely Adorable\n\nAfter the family photos were captured, Eva stepped back in front of the camera for some solo shots.\n\n\"This smize will never go to waste, honey.

I'm like, 'Oh!' So I put the G-string down, because I felt like the phone call and the unmentionables...\" she told Entertainment Tonight in September 2021. \"It was definitely a backless pair of underwear that I was holding, and Tyler's like, 'Hey, I have an amazing new project, and I think you are perfect for it.'\"\n\nEva Marcille's Hosting Career\n\nEva also took her competition chops and turned them into a hosting career, running the show on competitions like My Model Looks Better Than Your Model and Rip the Runway.\n\nRELATED: ANTM Alum Yaya DaCosta Shares What She *Really* Thinks of Eva Marcille on The Real Housewives of Atlanta\n\n\"I love to work.
