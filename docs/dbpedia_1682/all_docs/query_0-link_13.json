DJ Khaled's future brightens with every new release, and All I Do Is Win certainly isn't an exception. It's a fitting addition to a solid catalogue that DJ Khaled has been developing since stepping foot in the game. We're excited to hear more.\n\nQuotable Lyrics\n\n\"All I do is win win win no matter what\n\nGot money on my mind, I can never get enough\n\nAnd every time I step up in the building\n\nEverybody hands go UP\n\nAnd they stay there, and they stay there\n\nAnd they stay there - up down up down up down\n\nCause all I do is WIN, WIN, WIN\n\nAnd if you goin in put yo' hands in the air, make 'em stay there!\""
