        "text": "Billie Eilish may still be just 22-years-old but in her short career she has already achieved what most singer-songwriters could only dream of. The “Bad Guy” songstress has now won Best Original Song at the 96th Academy Awards for “What Was I Made For?,” the lead track from Barbie and with that win she’s set a new record\n\nFollow the 2024 Oscars ceremony and the red carpet latest updates live online on As.com.\n\nEverything you need to know about the 2024 Oscars\n\nEilish wins second Oscar after “No Time To Die”\n\nOscar success is nothing new for Eilish, despite her tender years. In 2022, she already picked up the very same award for “No Time To Die,” the theme song from the James Bond film of the same name.\n\nJust 17 when she recorded that particular track, she become the youngest artist ever to have sung a 007 franchise theme song, and she could now be set for another “youngest ever” record, along with songwriting partner Finneas O’Connell, who just happens to be her brother.\n\nWhat record has Eilish broken at the 96th Academy Awards?\n\nWith “What Was I Made For?” winning Best Original Song, the siblings have become the youngest duo ever to win two Oscars. More accurately, Eilish takes the spot on the new list, with O’Connell, four and a half years her senior, in second place.\n\nThey become only the fourth and fifth people to receive two Academy Awards before the age of 30, after Luise Rainer (Best Actress in 1936 and 1937 and the ages of 28 and 29), Jodie Foster (Best Actress in 1989 and 1992 at the ages of 26 and 29) and Hilary Swank (Best Actress in 2000 and 2005 at the ages of 26 and 29).\n\nWhat other “youngest” awards does Billie Eilish hold?\n\nBetween them, the brother and sister songwriting team have already hold a number of other “youngest” records, most notably at the Grammy Awards.\n\nEilish is the youngest artist to win the Big Four Grammy Awards in the same year, picking up Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist in 2020. O’Connell, meanwhile, is the youngest person to take home the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, also in 2020."
