        "text": "“The Bear” is back. After winning 10 Emmys just a few months ago at the 75th Annual Emmy Awards — the most ever in a single season of a comedy series — FX hope voters are still saying “yes, chef” this September, when the Chicago-set restaurant comedy will try to add to its 2024 Emmy haul at the 76th annual ceremony.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to believe Christopher Storer’s series will do exactly that. It’s the most-nominated comedy series (with 23 total nods) and the second most-nominated series overall (trailing only “Shōgun” with 25). Earlier this year, it won 10 trophies with only 13 nominations, and most critics agree the second season (which is what’s eligible right now) is better than the first (which was already rewarded back in January).\n\nBut there are significant question marks, as well. Season 3, which premiered in June, wasn’t as well received as prior editions. That shouldn’t matter, since voters won’t officially be asked to consider those episodes until next year’s Emmys, but whether voters know what season they’re voting for is anyone’s guess. Even if they do, the latest impression tends to linger. It’s already reignited complaints of category fraud — namely, that “The Bear” should be competing as a drama series, not a comedy — and all this turmoil could lead TV Academy members to take a second look at the other nominees.\n\nEnter: this article. Rather than predict what will happen — which IndieWire’s Marcus Jones already does so well — I’m here to help sort out how many Emmys “The Bear” deserves to win. Each category is unique. Each group of nominees deserves equal consideration. Below, I’ve tried to break down the ins and outs of every category in which “The Bear” has been nominated, explaining its merits (or lack thereof) along with its competitors’. Voters can use it as a handy resource, while awards fans can use it to gauge just how much love the Emmys still have for “The Bear” once the names are read.\n\nStyle note: For categories where each nominated program consists of multiple individual artists, not all names are listed. It’s just a space issue. Full credits can be found on the Emmys’ website."
