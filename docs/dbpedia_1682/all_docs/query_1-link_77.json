        "text": "Georgia rock band the Black Crowes have returned. Brothers Chris and Rich Robinson have announced Happiness Bastards, their 10th studio album first LP of original material in 15 years. The record is out March 15 via the band’s own Silver Arrow Records. Today, the Black Crowes have shared lead single “Wanting and Waiting,” as well as the 10-song tracklist for Happiness Bastards. Check those out below.\n\n“Happiness Bastards is our love letter to rock’n’roll,” Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson said in press materials. “Rich and I are always writing and creating music; that has never stopped for us, and it is always where we find harmony together. This record represents that.”\n\nRich Robinson added: “This album is a continuation of our story as a band. Our years of experience writing and making music and touring the world are represented in this record, and we were brilliantly guided by one of the best producers in the business, Jay Joyce. I am incredibly proud of what we put together.”\n\nHappiness Bastards was produced by Jay Joyce, and features vocals from country singer Lainey Wilson on “Wilted Rose.” The Black Crowes cut the album in early 2023 with Joyce and longtime bassist Sven Pipien.\n\nThe Black Crowes reunited back in 2020, embarking on a summer tour for the 30th anniversary of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker. The 1990 LP, which climbed to No. 4 on Billboard’s 200 chart, featured the band’s two biggest hits: a cover of Otis Redding’s “Hard to Handle,” and the original ballad “She Talks to Angels.” The Robinson brothers played Shake Your Money Maker in full each night of the North American trek.\n\nThe Black Crowes’ last studio album was the two-part project Before the Frost... Until the Freeze, released in 2009.\n\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
