        "text": "Post by 🇯🇲 dollybaby 🇯🇲 on\n\nThe song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 63 chart date of March 6, 2010, and peaked at this chart at No. 24 for the chart dated July 24, 2010. It also peaked at No. 8 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in 2010. The song was certified double Platinum by RIAA on July 6, 2011, and 3× Platinum on 19 June 2015. The song re-entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in May 2014 at No. 23. As of May 2014, the song has sold over 3 million copies in the US.\n\nRemix version:\n\nPost by 🇯🇲 dollybaby 🇯🇲 on\n\n#311 on Billboard's 500 Greatest Pop Songs\n\nYou Know What It Is: The DJ Khaled posse cut to end all DJ Khaled posse cuts, “All I Do Is Win” has become synonymous with victory — from basketball games to graduations and everything in between.\n\nThis Magic Moment: The hook, of course, when the instrumental pauses for a second between T-Pain declaring “Everybody hands go up” and “And they stay there.”\n\nThese Words: “Last time on the Khaled remix, now I’m on the original version” — Ludacris’ verse includes a nod to his appearance on 2007’s “I’m So Hood” remix, rather than that song’s initial release."
