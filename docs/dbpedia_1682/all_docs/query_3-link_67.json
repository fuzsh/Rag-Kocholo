Here’s how to get a chance at a contestant audition and Big Money!\n\nFill out the application below, and submit a photo and, if you’d like, a video of one minute or less telling us why you’d make a great contestant. Videos aren’t required, but we love to see them! (No TikTok videos, please). This application is for the broadcast version of Wheel of Fortune only.\n\nIf you’re selected, we’ll contact you to set up a virtual audition from the comfort of your own home. The last step in your submission process is playing a quick game consisting of five Toss-Up Wheel of Fortune® puzzles. The game will take under 10 minutes to play and must be completed in one session. Doesn’t get much easier than that!"
