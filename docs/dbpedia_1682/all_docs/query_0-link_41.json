        "text": "Coming off his 2010 album Victory, DJ Khaled's collaboration with T-Pain, Ludacris, Rick Ross and Snoop Dogg titled \"All I Do Is Win\" is a track that enjoyed a massive amount of success upon its initial chart run and continues to be a turn-up anthem to this day. From sporting events to massive club nights, there's still only a handful of songs that can transform a sweaty mass of partygoers into an synchronized, hands-in-the-air organism quite like this song. However, earlier today on Twitter, T-Pain let it be known that there are some lyrics that many people have been screwing up for years.\n\nTweeting out the correct lyrics to the hit single, T-Pain set the record straight with Internet users about the proper way to sing along to this popular jam. \"I don’t wanna throw another wrench in your childhood,\" he began, \"but also it’s 'Everybody hands go UP......... and they stay there....... AND THEY SAY YEA.'\"\n\nHe's referring to the \"say yeah\" part at the end, which is commonly sung as a just a refrain of the preceeding \"and they stay there.\" A quick check with a verified lyrics website will tell you that T-Pain isn't lying - you may have been singing this one wrong for a very long time. Check out the video below and see if you can hear the difference.\n\nThat's not the only lyric correction bombshell that T-Pain dropped today. He also clarified the right words from \"Buy U A Drank,\" his hit single from Epiphany, the album that originally made him a star. However, no matter how you sing it, T-Pain is grateful for the spin. \"It’s whatever you want it to be,\" he said. \"Just enjoy the song however you hear it. I just appreciate you listening.\" So, if you're one of the many who have been mangling T-Pain's words for several years, don't sweat it. At least you have the proper \"how to\" guide now."
