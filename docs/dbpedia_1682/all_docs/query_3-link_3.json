        "text": "American singer (born 1984)\n\nMusical artist\n\nFaheem Rashad Najm (born September 30, 1984),[4] known professionally as T-Pain, is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, record producer and actor. He is known for popularizing creative use of Auto-Tune pitch correction, often used with extreme parameter settings to create electronic-styled vocal performances. Blending its use with R&B and hip hop sensibilities, T-Pain became a prominent figure in both genres throughout the 2000s. Other music industry artists, such as Lil Wayne, Kanye West, Future, and Travis Scott, have since utilized Auto-Tune to a similar effect.\n\nT-Pain began his recording career as part of the Tallahassee, Florida-based hip hop group, Nappy Headz. He released his debut solo mixtape, Back @ It independently in 2004, and signed with Senegalese-American singer Akon through his label Konvict Muzik, in a joint venture with Jive Records the following year. His 2005 debut single, \"I'm Sprung\" was quickly met with commercial success, peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and receiving platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its follow-up, \"I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)\" (featuring Mike Jones) saw further commercial success at number five on the chart; both served as lead singles for his debut studio album, Rappa Ternt Sanga (2005). Its moderate reception was succeeded by his second album, Epiphany (2007), which peaked atop the US Billboard 200 and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-number one single \"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\" (featuring Yung Joc), as well as the top-40 single \"Bartender\" (featuring Akon). His third album, Three Ringz (2008) was preceded by the single \"Can't Believe It\" (featuring Lil Wayne), and his fourth album, Revolver (2011) was preceded by \"5 O'Clock\" (featuring Wiz Khalifa and Lily Allen). His fifth album, Oblivion (2017) sustained long-term delays and was met with critical and commercial failure, serving as his final major label release.\n\nMeanwhile, T-Pain saw continued success as a guest performer on nine Billboard Hot 100-top ten singles—\"Shawty\" by Plies, \"Cyclone\" by Baby Bash, \"Good Life\" by Kanye West, \"Shawty Get Loose\" by Lil Mama, \"Got Money\" by Lil Wayne, \"Blame It\" by Jamie Foxx, and \"Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)\" by Pitbull—which includes two singles that peaked the chart: \"Kiss Kiss\" by Chris Brown and \"Low\" by Flo Rida. The latter was named third in the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade and received diamond (10× platinum) certification by the RIAA. \"Good Life\" and \"Blame It\" both won Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance, respectively, from T-Pain's total of 12 nominations for the award. Outside of music, he founded the record label Nappy Boy Entertainment in 2005, and has signed rapper Travie McCoy to brief commercial success. Furthermore, he has produced and written material for other artists, and voice acted in film and television including Tom & Jerry, Freaknik: The Musical, The Cleveland Show, Squidbillies and We Bare Bears.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nNajm was born and raised in Tallahassee, Florida, to parents Aliyah, a Bahamian chef,[5] and Shasheem, who founded the Homeboyz to Men program.[3][6] His stage name is short for \"Tallahassee Pain\", and was chosen because of the hardships he experienced while living there. Najm was brought up in a Muslim household, but he has expressed his lack of interest in the concept of religion.[7][8] At three years old, he got his first taste of the music business when a friend of the family, gospel jazz artist/producer Ben Tankard, allowed him to spend time and \"twist the knobs\" at his recording studio. At age ten, Najm turned his bedroom into a music studio, using a keyboard, a beat machine and a four-track recorder.[9][10]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1999–2006: Early career and Rappa Ternt Sanga\n\n[edit]\n\nT-Pain joined the rap group Nappy Headz in 1999. Through a mutual connection with music promoter TJ Chapman, he was discovered by Rocco Did It Again! and Mike Blumstein—founders of the independent record label Chase Entertainment—to whom he signed.[11] He released his debut mixtape, Back @ It in 2004, and later released the song \"I'm Fucked Up\", a slightly altered cover version of Akon's then-popular 2004 single, \"Locked Up\". Akon himself came across the song and immediately offered him a deal to his label, Konvict Muzik.[12][13] While T-Pain was offered other record deals, with the highest-bidding being US$900,000, Akon promised the young artist a personal mentorship in the industry. Meanwhile, Blumstein and Rocco remained involved in T-Pain's careers as joint co-managers.[14] Afterward, T-Pain began singing instead of rapping, and used this inspiration to begin recording for his debut studio album, Rappa Ternt Sanga. Released on December 6, 2005, through a joint venture with Jive Records,[3] the album reached number 33 on the Billboard 200, and has since received gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThe album was preceded by the lead single, \"I'm Sprung\", which was released in August 2005 and peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The second single, \"I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)\", featuring Mike Jones, was released in December 2005 and peaked at number five on the former chart,[15] and number ten on the latter. The third and final single from the album, \"Studio Luv\", was released in October 2006 and failed to chart.\n\n2007–2008: Epiphany\n\n[edit]\n\nIn mid-2006, T-Pain began work on his second album, now with the Zomba Label Group as well as his previous labels. The album, titled Epiphany, was released on June 5, 2007. The album sold 171,000 records in its first week, reaching number one on the Billboard 200.[16] The record has since sold 819,000 records in the United States.[17]\n\nThe album was preceded by the lead single \"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\" featuring Yung Joc, released in February 2007. The song reached number one on both the Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming his first to peak atop both charts. The album's second single, \"Bartender\", featuring Akon, was released in June 2007 and reached number five on the Hot 100 and number nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The third and final single from the album, \"Church\", was released in October 2007 and failed to chart in the United States.\n\nSpeaking in May 2007 to Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul about his reason for naming his second album 'Epiphany', T-Pain stated: \"One of the two dictionary meanings of epiphany is 'a sudden moment of insight or revelation'. And to me the title 'Epiphany' signifies the moment I realized that, to make the best music I can, I needed to just go in the studio and be myself, and not concentrate so hard on following other people's formulas.\"[18] While promoting his second album, T-Pain made guest appearances on multiple songs by other artists. T-Pain was featured on \"I'm a Flirt\" (remix) by R. Kelly with T.I., \"Outta My System\" by Bow Wow, \"Baby Don't Go\" by Fabolous, \"I'm So Hood\" by DJ Khaled with many other rappers, \"Shawty\" by Plies, \"Kiss Kiss\" by Chris Brown, \"Low\" by Flo Rida, and \"Good Life\" by Kanye West.[19] For two weeks in late 2007, T-Pain was featured on four top ten singles simultaneously on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[20]\n\nHis performance on West's \"Good Life\" won the BET Award for Best Collaboration and was nominated in several other categories.[21][22] In 2008, the song won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Song.[23]\n\n2007–2009: Three Ringz\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, T-Pain began work on his third album, Three Ringz with Rocco Valdes, Akon and Lil Wayne. The album was also his first under his newly launched label, Nappy Boy Entertainment. Released on November 11, 2008,[24] the album sold 168,000 records in its first week and reached number four on the Billboard 200. A mixtape, Pr33 Ringz, was released in early 2008 for the album's promotion.\n\nThr333 Ringz was preceded by three singles; jts lead single, \"Can't Believe It\", featuring Lil Wayne, was released in July 2008 and reached number seven on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album's second single, \"Chopped 'N' Skrewed\", featuring Ludacris, was released in September 2008; it reached number 27 on the Hot 100 and number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The third and final single from the album, \"Freeze\", featuring Chris Brown, was released in October 2008; it reached number 38 on the Hot 100 and number 39 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Guest appearances on Three Ringz include T.I., Lil Wayne, Ludacris, DJ Khaled, Ciara, Chris Brown and Kanye West, among others.[25]\n\nIn 2008, T-Pain continued to guest perform on numerous singles, such as \"She Got It\" by 2 Pistols, \"Go Girl\" by Ciara, \"The Boss\" by Rick Ross, \"Cash Flow\" by Ace Hood, \"Shawty Get Loose\" by Lil Mama, \"One More Drink\" by Ludacris, and \"Go Hard\" by DJ Khaled with Kanye West.

T-Pain appeared again on SNL in February 2009 (S34E15, hosted by Bradley Cooper with musical guest TV on the Radio) as a feature in the Digital Short premier of The Lonely Island single, \"I'm on a Boat,\" off their Incredibad album. T-Pain also supported the album in 2009 with his Thr33 Ringz Tour, which included sold-out shows across North America. T-Pain and rapper Lil Wayne formed the duo T-Wayne in 2008.[26] The duo released a self-titled mixtape in late 2008; it charted on the Billboard 200 in January 2009.[27] Their debut album was going to be released in 2009, but never was.[28]\n\n2009–2012: RevolveR\n\n[edit]\n\nHe collaborated with country pop singer Taylor Swift for the CMT Music Awards, performing \"Thug Story\", a parody of Swift's hit single \"Love Story\".[29] In an interview with MTV, T-Pain announced that he would release his fourth studio album in November 2009 and that its title would be UBER.[30] He stated that although he originally wanted to release the album in the summer of 2010, his label had pushed the release forward. However, the album was not released in 2009.\n\nAn iPhone application called \"I Am T-Pain\", featuring an auto tuner, allowing fans to record and modify their own voice to accompany an instrumental collection of T-Pain's music, was released in September 2009.[31] In July 2009, T-Pain endorsed the 2009 T-Pain Killa Cam-Pain, a grassroots effort to help him become elected as president of Florida State University.[32]\n\nIn November 2009, T-Pain released the first single from his fourth studio album, \"Take Your Shirt Off\".[33] The single only managed to reach number eighty on the Hot 100, and was later dubbed a promotional single. In February 2010, he released \"Reverse Cowgirl\" featuring Young Jeezy, which was the official lead single from his fourth studio album.[34] He later release an updated version of the song excluding Young Jeezy's verse and adding a new bridge. The single reached number seventy-five on the Hot 100 and number sixty-four on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming a mild hit. The single has since been dubbed a promotional single. T-Pain was later featured on the \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\" single in February 2010, which reached number two on the Hot 100.[35] In March 2010, T-Pain developed and starred in Cartoon Network's Adult Swim animated musical special, Freaknik: The Musical.[36]\n\nT-Pain released a mixtape on his Nappy Boy label in February 2010, T-Pain Presents: Nappy Boy All Stars Vol.1, which contained remixes of songs including \"Forever\" by Drake.[37] On May 5, 2011, he announced another mixtape, prEVOLVEr, serving as a predecessor to his album.[38] The mixtape including collaborations from artists such as Lil Wayne and Field Mob.

The show has aired for two seasons so far: the first in 2018, which had six episodes, and the second in 2019, which had eight episodes.[77]\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nT-Pain has confirmed his involvement in the development of the upcoming video game Grand Theft Auto VI, although his role has not been specified.[78]\n\nMusical style\n\n[edit]\n\nT-Pain defined in 2005 his own music style as \"Hard & B\", a play on R&B.[79] In 2024, T-Pain said that country and gospel music were major influences on his music.[80]\n\nHe mentioned GarageBand and Logic Pro as the software he uses to produce his own beats.[81]\n\nUse of Auto-Tune\n\n[edit]\n\nMusically, T-Pain is best known for popularizing the use of Auto-Tune, a pitch-correcting audio processor, for vocals, with the effect turned up to give the voice a robotic quality. He has used this effect throughout his singing career, starting in 2003.[82] This use of Auto-Tune had been pioneered by Cher in her successful 1998 single \"Believe\".[83] T-Pain, who had been looking for a way to make his voice sound unique, was inspired to use Auto-Tune after hearing the Darkchild remix of the 1999 song \"If You Had My Love\" by Jennifer Lopez, which makes occasional use of the effect.[84] He was also inspired in part by a similar sound achieved by Roger Troutman in the 1980s (using a talk box) and Teddy Riley in the 1990s (using both talk boxes and vocoders).[82]\n\nAfter the success of T-Pain's first two albums, his use of Auto-Tune was replicated by a number of hip hop artists, including Snoop Dogg on the 2007 single \"Sensual Seduction\",[85] Lil Wayne on the 2008 single \"Lollipop\",[86] Kanye West on the 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak (on which T-Pain served as a consultant),[87] the Black Eyed Peas on the 2009 single \"Boom Boom Pow\", and Diddy on the 2010 album Last Train to Paris. In a November 2008 interview, T-Pain revealed that Diddy had paid him for the right to use Auto-Tune in T-Pain's style on the then-upcoming Last Train to Paris, and he felt that other artists should do the same.[88]\n\nIn 2009, rapper Jay-Z released the single \"D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)\", which criticized the practice. The song directly mentioned T-Pain, with the lyrics \"You niggas singing too much/ Get back to rap, you T-Paining too much.\"[89] Jay-Z has insisted that the song was not a personal attack on T-Pain, and that he was simply criticizing a trend that he felt had run its course. T-Pain has said that he loved the song.[30] However, he felt personally hurt by a general backlash against the use of Auto-Tune that began at around the same time.[84] Nevertheless, he has continued to use Auto-Tune, feeling that it is simply part of his musical style, as opposed to jumping on a trend as was the case for other artists.[84]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nT-Pain has been married to Amber Najm (née Wyatt) since 2003. They have three children: one daughter, Lyriq, and two sons Muziq and Kaydnz Kodah (born May 2009).[90][91]\n\nOn March 27, 2009, T-Pain was involved in a golf cart accident, the same day he was due for a music video shoot for Lil' Kim's \"Download\" song. He suffered cuts, bruises, and four missing teeth and had emergency dental work done. He returned to performing two days later.[92]\n\nOn April 1, 2013, T-Pain revealed that he had cut off his iconic dreadlocks, stating \"We must all learn to adjust with our surroundings. Those who get stuck doing the same things for too long are bound to get left behind the strong who press on & reinvent themselves. Also good news hair grows back.\"[93]\n\nOn August 30, 2016, T-Pain's niece, Javona Glover, was stabbed to death in a local Walgreens store in his hometown, Tallahassee, Florida.[94] In 2017, a suspect in the case was found dead in an apparent suicide.[95]\n\nHe is an avid gamer who regularly streams on Twitch.[96] He has many tattoos, some of which are internet memes or otherwise Internet-related.[97][98]\n\nLegal issues\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 28, 2007, T-Pain refused to shorten his performance at Radio One's Spring Fest Concert in Miami, which caused police presence to escalate backstage. He became agitated after concert officials stopped his performance of \"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\". Police chased him and his entourage out of the premises and detained them.[99]\n\nIn June 2007, a warrant was issued for T-Pain's arrest for driving with a suspended license. He subsequently turned himself in to the Leon County Jail on November 2, 2007. He was held without bail, but was released three hours later.[100]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: T-Pain discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nRappa Ternt Sanga (2005)\n\nEpiphany (2007)\n\nThree Ringz (2008)\n\nRevolver (2011)\n\nOblivion (2017)\n\n1UP (2019)\n\nOn Top of the Covers (2023)\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2010 Freaknik: The Musical The Ghost of Freaknik Past Voice Lottery Ticket Junior 2015 Furious 7 Himself 2016 The Boss Himself Ghostmates Himself 2021 Tom & Jerry Singing voice of Tom Cat\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards Host MTV Cribs Saturday Night Live Musical Guest Episode: \"Tim McGraw/Ludacris & T-Pain\" 2009 Aqua Teen Hunger Force Frylock (live-action) Episode: \"Last Last One Forever and Ever\" CMT Music Awards Himself Robot Chicken Roadblock/Lil' Jen Voice; Episode: \"The Ramblings of Maurice\" 2011 Squidbillies Himself Voice; Episode: \"Asbestos I Can\" 2011–2013 The Cleveland Show Theodore Voice; 6 episodes 2012 Behind the Music 2013–2016 The Eric André Show Himself 2 episodes 2014 Celebrities Undercover 2015 Wild 'n Out 2016 Comedy Bang!
