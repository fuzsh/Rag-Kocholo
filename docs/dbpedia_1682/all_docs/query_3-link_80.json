        "text": "To date, only three programs throughout TV history have swept the top seven Primetime Emmys categories for series, lead actor, lead actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, writing and directing. Miniseries “Angels in America” was the first to do so in 2004, followed by comedy “Schitt’s Creek” in 2020, and then drama “The Crown” in 2021. At the upcoming 2024 Emmys, “The Bear” is hoping to join this esteemed list — and it’s all thanks to a savvy category switcheroo.\n\nLast year, the FX dramedy about a Chicago beef restaurant claimed six of the top seven prizes for its first season: comedy series, lead actor Jeremy Allen White as Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, supporting actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Richard “Richie” Jerimovich, supporting actress Ayo Edebiri as Sydney Adamu, and both writing and directing for Christopher Storer. “The Bear” was not eligible in the lead actress category, so it couldn’t win there and complete the sweep. Until now. For Season 2, Edebiri has been “promoted” of sorts from supporting to lead, so now the show actually has a shot of claiming victory in all top seven races.\n\nEdebiri already campaigned as a lead actress for Season 2 at the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards, where she won both contests. But now, she faces stiff competition at the Emmys from current odds leader Jean Smart (“Hacks”), who won the Best Comedy Actress category in 2021 and 2022 (the show was not eligible in 2023). The other four nominees this year are Quinta Brunson (“Abbott Elementary”), Kristen Wiig (“Palm Royale”), Maya Rudolph (“Loot”) and Selena Gomez (“Only Murders in the Building”).\n\nIn Best Comedy Actor, White is the favorite to win a bookend trophy against the following five co-nominees: Martin Short (“Only Murders in the Building”), D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai (“Reservation Dogs”), Larry David (“Curb Your Enthusiasm”), Steve Martin (“Only Murders in the Building”) and Matt Berry (“What We Do in the Shadows”). Incidentally, White is also the reigning champion at the Golden Globes, Critics Choice and SAG Awards for Season 2.\n\nAs for the top category, “The Bear” has the lead at Gold Derby for Best Comedy Series over the likes of “Hacks,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “What We Do in the Shadows,” “Reservation Dogs” and “Palm Royale.”\n\nIn Best Comedy Supporting Actress, Liza Colon-Zayas (“The Bear”) is a brand new nominee this year, and she currently places third in our rankings behind front-runner Hannah Einbinder (“Hacks”) and runner-up Meryl Streep (“Only Murders in the Building”). The other featured ladies are Sheryl Lee Ralph (“Abbott Elementary”), Carol Burnett (“Palm Royale”) and Janelle James (“Abbott Elementary”).\n\nAs for Best Comedy Supporting Actor, Moss-Bachrach is predicted to triumph yet again, with the other contenders being Paul W. Downs (“Hacks”), Lionel Boyce (“The Bear”), Tyler James Williams (“Abbott Elementary”), Paul Rudd (“Only Murders in the Building”) and Bowen Yang (“Saturday Night Live”).\n\nFinally, the Christmas-set episode entitled “Fishes” is expected to win both Best Comedy Directing (for Storer) and Best Comedy Writing (for Storer and Joanna Calo). The directing co-nominees are “Hacks” (“Bulletproof”), “The Bear” (“Honeydew”), “Abbott Elementary” (“Party”), “The Gentlemen” (“Refined Aggression”) and “The Ms. Pat Show” (“I’m The Pappy”). And the other writing contenders are “Hacks” (“Bulletproof”), “Abbott Elementary” (“Career Day”), “What We Do in the Shadows” (“Pride Parade”), “Girls5eva” (“Orlando”) and “The Other Two” (“Brooke Hosts A Night Of Undeniable Good”).\n\nPREDICT the 2024 Emmy winners through September 15\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.
