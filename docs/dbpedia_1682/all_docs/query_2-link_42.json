        "text": "Taylor Swift is at it again. She made history at Sunday night’s 66th annual Grammys by winning album of the year for the fourth time.\n\nPrior to Sunday’s win, Swift had taken home that award three times and was tied with Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon for the record.\n\nEach time Swift has won the award, she’s made history. She became the youngest artist in history to win the award in 2010 when she won for “Fearless,” then she won album of the year again in 2016 for “1989,” making her the first woman to win. Her third win was with “Folklore” in 2021, making her the first woman to win the award twice.\n\nHas Taylor Swift won album of the year every time she was nominated?\n\nSo far, Swift has won album of the year four out of five times she’s been nominated. This year’s Grammys marked her fifth nomination for the award.\n\nIn 2014, when she didn’t win for “Red,” she told Pop Sugar she went home, cried and ate In-N-Out Burger, and reflected on the loss.\n\n“You have a few options when you don’t win an award. You can decide like, ‘Oh, they’re wrong, they all voted wrong,’” she told Pop Sugar. “Second, you can be like, ‘I’m gonna go up on the stage and take the mic from whoever did win it.’ ... Or third, you can say, ‘Maybe they’re right. Maybe I did not make the record of my career. Maybe I need to fix the problem, which was that I have not been making sonically cohesive albums.’”\n\nShe also won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album Sunday night, and during the acceptance speech, she announced the release of a new album “The Tortured Poets Department” on April 19. The award was her 13th Grammy win, which is her lucky number.\n\n“So I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I have been keeping from you for the last two years, which is that my brand-new album comes out April 19,” she said during her acceptance speech.\n\nHere are all eight artists who were nominated for the 2024 album of the year at the Grammys:\n\n“World Music Radio” | Jon Batiste.\n\n“the record” | boygenius.\n\n“Endless Summer Vacation” | Miley Cyrus.\n\n“Did You Know That There’s A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd” | Lana Del Rey.\n\n“The Age Of Pleasure” | Janelle Monáe.\n\n“GUTS” | Olivia Rodrigo.\n\n“Midnights” | Taylor Swift.\n\n“SOS” | SZA.\n\nAll the Grammys Taylor Swift has won\n\nOver the span of her career, Swift has won a total of 14 Grammys and has been nominated for 52 different Grammy awards, according to People.\n\nHere are the Grammys the music artist has won:\n\n2010 — Best Country Album | “Fearless.”\n\n2010 — Best Country Song | “White Horse”\n\n2010 — Best Female Country Vocal Performance | “White Horse.”\n\n2010 — Album Of The Year | “Fearless.”\n\n2012 — Best Country Song | “Mean.”\n\n2012 — Best Country Solo Performance | “Mean.”\n\n2013 — Best Song Written For Visual Media | “Safe & Sound (From The Hunger Games).”\n\n2016 — Best Music Video | “Bad Blood.”\n\n2016 — Best Pop Vocal Album | “1989.”\n\n2016 — Album Of The Year | “1989.”\n\n2021 — Album Of The Year | “Folklore.”\n\n2023 — Best Music Video | “All Too Well: The Short Film.”\n\n2024 — Best Pop Vocal Album | “Midnights.”\n\n2024 — Album Of The Year | “Midnights.”\n\nHere are the Grammys Taylor Swift has been nominated for but didn’t win:\n\n2008 — Best New Artist.\n\n2010 — Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals | “Breathe feat.
