        "text": "Research estimates about 4.4% of adults in the United States will experience bipolar disorder at some point in their lives.\n\nIt’s important for people living with bipolar disorder to be represented in film and TV. Yet, the media often exaggerates the emotional highs and lows of the condition.\n\nPeople with bipolar disorder can look like anyone. They’re old and young, work fulfilling jobs, and have loving friends and families. A more accurate representation can help raise awareness of the condition and reduce the stigma around mental illness.\n\nThe following are some movies and TV shows that include a character with bipolar disorder and do it well. They show what it’s like to experience episodes of mania as well as the incredibly low moods that can be part of bipolar disorder.\n\nThese characters have families, friends, and co-workers who care about their well-being. Some of these movies and shows address the challenge of caring for a loved one with bipolar disorder.\n\nIn several of these shows and movies, treatment decisions are explored and challenged. Just as in real life, it can be quite a journey to find the right care and treatment options for you or your loved one.\n\nThis 2012 movie is based on the book written by Matthew Quick. It’s about a man named Pat who gets into trouble with the law and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, he’s diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Pat has trouble accepting this diagnosis. After leaving the hospital, he moves back in with his parents.\n\nPat was married and working as a teacher before going into the hospital. He’s determined to get this life back. Pat doesn’t like how the medication makes him feel and doesn’t think he needs it. He wants to manage his bipolar disorder on his own.\n\nThe movie accurately depicts manic episodes: Pat comes up with complex plans to win back his wife. At times, he speaks rapidly, blurts out whatever ideas pop into his head, and barely sleeps.\n\nIt also shows how his family and friends respond to his bipolar disorder. They’re loving and supportive. It’s wonderful to see the role they play in his recovery.\n\n“Homeland” is a show that ran from 2011–2020. It features a CIA agent named Carrie who has bipolar disorder.\n\nCarrie, played by Claire Danes, believes that an American prisoner of war is actually an Al-Qaeda spy. Many people celebrate this prisoner as a hero, but Carrie’s instincts tell her otherwise.\n\nThe series is a thrilling game of cat and mouse, with brilliant Carrie at the top of her game. Carrie thinks quickly, pulls off complex plans, and is spontaneous. These traits may be associated with bipolar disorder, and they serve her well as a CIA agent.\n\nThe constant stress of her position takes a toll, however, and makes it more difficult to manage her bipolar disorder.\n\nThis Canadian TV series ran from 2001–2015. It’s the newest installment of the “Degrassi” shows that aired in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe show follows a group of students who deal with a variety of challenges typical to teenagers. It’s praised for having real-life characters tackle tough themes.\n\nThe series features two characters with bipolar disorder: Eli Goldsworthy and Craig Manning. They are otherwise typical teenagers with friends, relationships, and dreams. The viewer gets to see how living with bipolar disorder affects their lives and the people around them.\n\nIn every “Degrassi” series, in fact, there are characters living with mental health conditions.\n\nThis 2007 movie is an intense legal thriller about a law firm tasked with defending a giant, very guilty corporation. The class-action suit is worth billions of dollars, so stakes and tension are high.\n\nTom Wilkinson plays Arthur Edens. He’s a senior lawyer at the firm who’s living with bipolar disorder. He’s not taking his medication, however, and has a manic episode while in court. He’s removed from the case.\n\nThis movie deals with tough topics like not taking medication and involuntary hospitalization.\n\nThis 2014 movie is based on the childhood of writer and director Maya Forbes.\n\nThe movie takes place in the 1970s. The father, Cameron (Mark Ruffalo), lives with bipolar disorder. When the mom gets into grad school, she moves away and Cameron takes on the care of their daughters.\n\n“Infinitely Polar Bear” shows how bipolar disorder can disrupt a family.\n\nDuring his episodes of mania, Cameron is creative and spontaneous. He’s full of life and ideas. This is both charming and frustrating for his family.\n\nLife with their dad is not easy for the girls. Cameron sometimes stops taking his medication and tries to self-medicate with alcohol instead.\n\nThere are lots of challenges, but also lots of love.\n\nThis 1993 movie is about a man who is admitted to an inpatient treatment center for his bipolar disorder.\n\nThe film conveys the highs and lows of living with bipolar disorder. The main character, played by Richard Gere, doesn’t want to take medication.\n\nThe things he does during an episode of mania make perfect sense to him. He doesn’t want to give up the freedom and euphoria he feels during manic episodes.\n\nIn treatment, his therapist falls in love with him. She knows the rules about falling for a patient but can’t resist his charm.\n\nThis intense 2016 movie invites the audience to experience the episodes of mania and depression that, in some cases, may both be experienced with bipolar disorder.\n\n“Touched with Fire” is about two talented poets living with bipolar disorder. They meet in a treatment facility when they’re both experiencing episodes of mania.\n\nThey believe these episodes are fueling their creativity and that going back on medication would suppress their passion, which feels unthinkable to them.\n\nThe two poets continue their romance after they leave the facility. However, their loved ones worry the two lovers aren’t managing their condition properly.\n\nThis 2009 movie is based on a true story about a whistleblower in a big company.\n\nMark Whitacre, played by Matt Damon, is an executive at Archer-Daniels-Midland who lives with bipolar disorder.\n\nHe agrees to provide inside information to the FBI for an investigation. At the same time, he’s taking millions of dollars from the company for himself.\n\nBeing in a state of mania helps him keep this incredibly complicated plan going for a while. However, the stress and strain of this elaborate scheme worsen his condition.\n\nThis movie gives the viewer some insight into the inner workings of Whitacre’s incredible brain during an episode of mania.\n\nThe real-life Whitacre now works to reduce the stigma around mental illness.\n\nThis 2015 movie isn’t specific to bipolar disorder and is marketed as a kids’ movie, but it does a great job of depicting the condition.\n\n“Inside Out” explores how the human brain deals with feelings and memories. Characters represent five big feelings: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust.\n\nThe story helps the audience understand how emotions work. It also shows what happens when things get out of balance.\n\nThere are many mental health resources available for bipolar disorder. Some include:\n\nDepression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA)\n\nNational Alliance on Mental Health\n\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\n\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\n\nHelp is out there\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis and considering suicide or self-harm, please seek support:\n\nCall or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.\n\nText HOME to the Crisis Text Line at 741741.\n\nNot in the United States? Find a helpline in your country with Befrienders Worldwide.\n\nCall 911 or your local emergency services number if you feel safe to do so.\n\nIf you’re calling on behalf of someone else, stay with them until help arrives. You may remove weapons or substances that can cause harm if you can do so safely.\n\nIf you are not in the same household, stay on the phone with them until help arrives.\n\nRepresentation of people with bipolar disorder in movies and TV shows is important if they and their condition are portrayed accurately.\n\nThere are many harmful stereotypes about people with mental health conditions. Featuring characters with bipolar disorder in movies and TV can help build understanding about the condition and reduce stigma."
