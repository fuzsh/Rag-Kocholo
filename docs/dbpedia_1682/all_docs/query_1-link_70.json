        "text": "For Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — and Ty Dolla $ign, the third time was indeed the charm. After a pair of potential Vultures 2 release dates came and went, fans were apprehensive to believe the Aug. 2 arrival that was announced on the Yeezy website last week.\n\nYe (who hasn’t posted or said anything publicly about the album’s arrival) and Ty released their “Slide” single on Friday to kick off the rollout.\n\nHours later, Ty and Ye previewed the album via a YouTube livestream early Saturday (Aug. 3) and Vultures 2 began to land on streaming services just hours later. V2 boasts 16 tracks in total with features from some frequent collaborators such as Playboi Carti, Don Toliver, Lil Wayne, Future, Young Thug and more.\n\nPrior to the album’s arrival, Ty Dolla $ign told Billboard in July that V2 was finished but they were still finalizing plans about a proper rollout for the LP. “We got all the songs. Basically it’s just like, ‘How can we get it there? How can we go bigger than the first album?’” the rapper said. “Certain people will probably expect you to just do the same exact sound. But that sound’s already out.”\n\nThe Vultures duo look to be taking the sequel project on the road for their signature listening experiences. Ye and Ty will be heading to Salt Lake City on Aug. 9 before trekking to Asia for a pair of shows in South Korea and Taiwan later this month. If Vultures 2 debuts atop the Billboard 200, Ye will have earned his 12th project to reach the chart’s apex in his career.\n\nThe album remains a “living, breathing” body of work-in-progress with Ye and Ty still making updates to the sequel in real time. Songs have already been bolstered with new mixes, mastering and vocal tweaks in the hours since the project was released. While there’s plenty of potential for greatness scattered throughout the project filled with West’s avant-garde production, at times V2 is derailed by sound quality issues, unfinished thoughts or portions when Ye’s rapping dips.\n\nIt appears that West and Dolla $ign are still facing sample-clearing issues with fan-favorite Vultures leaks “Take Off Your Dress,” “Everybody” and “Gun to My Head” featuring Kid Cudi not making the cut.\n\nBillboard has run through Vultures 2 and ranked every song from the project (sans the nine-second “Isabella” interlude)."
