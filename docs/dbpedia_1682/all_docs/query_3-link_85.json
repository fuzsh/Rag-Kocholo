        "text": "What’s The Most Expensive Song to License for a Movie or TV Show?\n\nIt generally costs between $15,000 and $60,000 to license a song for a movie, TV show, or video game.\n\nBut there’s one song that costs WAY more than that. It’s actually THE most expensive song to license.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nIt’s AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck”.\n\nThe producers of “Varsity Blues” paid $500,000 to use it, and that was all the way back in 1999. So it’s possible that even that price has gone up.\n\nHowever, it must be worth it, because it’s been used in tons of other movies, including “Deadpool 2”, “Thor: Ragnarok”, “Battleship”, “Iron Man 2”, “The Longest Yard”, “Daddy’s Home” and “Daddy’s Home 2”, just to name a few."
