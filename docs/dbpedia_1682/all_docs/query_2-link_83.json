        "text": "Phoebe Bridgers took home the most trophies from the 2024 Grammy Awards, earning four wins, including three with her band, boygenius.\n\nBut when it comes to dominating headlines, Taylor Swift might have the edge. With her big win for ‘Midnights,’ Swift became the first artist to win best album of the year four times. Plus, she announced that yet another new album is on the way.\n\n▶ See the full list of winners.\n\nIn her home, Coco Jones has a photo of Beyoncé holding several Grammys, but with her own face replacing her idol’s.\n\nNow, Jones can have a photo of her holding her own trophy.\n\nThe singer won her first Grammy, in the best R&B performance category, for her ballad “ICU.” She went up against some stiff competition beating out the likes of SZA and Victoria Monét, among others.\n\nJones first heard about her Premiere Ceremony victory on the red carpet.\n\n“I was under the rain at the red carpet on my last stop and that’s when I heard that I won the award,” she said backstage. “I’m really soaking it in right now, looking at this award, thinking about my vision board and editing my face on Beyoncé’s picture of her holding the award. It’s totally surreal. It’s a lot to unpack on this stage.”\n\nJones said she’s grateful for her journey after finding stardom as a Disney child star. She struggled to maintain momentum then fell out the spotlight before she found success through her EP “What I Didn’t Tell You,” which was anchored by “ICU.”\n\n“All of the uncertainty can really be answered by God’s timing,” she said. “I’ve at this since I was 9. And to reap the benefits at this time, makes way more sense than I could ever imagine. I’m just truly grateful for all the obstacles that made me who I am.”\n\n▶ Read The Associated Press’ interview with Coco Jones ahead of the Grammys.\n\nBackstage, Phoebe Bridgers called out former Recording Academy President Neil Portnow when asked about the dominance of women at tonight’s Grammys. Her comments reflected what she told the AP last month.\n\n“Anybody who says ‘female’ is an alien,” Bridgers told The Associated Press ahead of the Grammys. “But also, being forced to say (expletive) like that, it’s true, for one, but it was only a couple of years ago now that that (expletive) who is now being accused of sexual violence said women need to step it up if they want to be nominated.”\n\nBridgers was referring to Portnow, who, in 2018, said women need “to step up,” if they wanted to receive Grammys and then issued an apology. In November 2023, Portnow was sued by a woman who said he drugged and raped her in a New York hotel room in 2018. His representative called the allegations “completely false.”\n\n▶ Read more from the AP’s interview with boygenius.\n\nThe Grammys brought no sweeping winners or major losers, but top nominee SZA won just three of nine and was shut out in the major categories.\n\nThe hip-hop soul dynamo came into the ceremony with a momentum and mojo that made it appear like she might run the board the way Billie Eilish did in 2020.\n\nBut her win list was limited to two awards won before the telecast began – “Ghost In The Machine” with Phoebe Bridgers won Pop Duo/Group Performance and “SOS” won best progressive R&B album – and one on the telecast, when “Snooze” won best R&B song.\n\nShe lost to Taylor Swift for album of the year, to Miley Cyrus for record of the year and to Eilish for song of the year.\n\nHer total – along with similar snubs two years ago – arguably had echoes of Beyoncé, who as her husband Jay-Z called out during the show, has won more Grammys than anyone while being consistently shut out of the top categories.\n\n“I would love to tell you this is the best moment of my life, but I feel this happy when I finish a song, or when I crack the code to a bridge that I love, or when I’m shortlisting a music video, or when I’m working with my dancers,” she said as she accepted the album of the year Grammy for “Midnights.”\n\n“For me, the award is the work,” she added. It was her record fourth album of the year win.\n\nShe also thanked Jack Antonoff, whom she described as “one of my best friends, and a once-in-a-generation producer. Earlier in the night, Antonoff matched the record for producer of the year (non-classical) wins.\n\n▶ Read more about her announcement of a brand-new album: The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nCeline Dion received a standing ovation when she surprised the Grammys to present album of the year.\n\n“When I say I’m happy to be here, I really mean it from my heart,” Dion said. “Those who have been lucky enough to be here, the Grammy Awards, must not take for granted the tremendous love and joy that music brings to our lives and to people all around the world.”\n\nDion has been diagnosed with stiff person syndrome, which caused her to suspend performing in late 2022.\n\nBilly Joel did something fans have wished he’d do for years: He showed up with new music.\n\nThe Long Island-bred piano balladeer sang “Turn the Lights Back On,” the first fresh song from the icon since 2007.\n\n“Time can make you blind,” he sang on the piano-led anthem, wearing sunglasses, a leather jacket and backed by violins, guitars, a sax and a cello. “Pride pride sticks out its tongue/Laughs at the portrait that we’ve become.”\n\nIt was the first time he’d performed the song live. Joel teased it Jan. 22 in a surprise statement. He wrote the song with Arthur Bacon, Wayne Hector and the track’s producer, Freddy Wexler.\n\nHe earned a standing ovation. “That was worth the wait,” host Trevor Noah said.\n\nJoel has five competitive Grammys, is in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and was a Kennedy Center honoree. In 2014, he began a monthly residency at the 19,500-seat Madison Square Garden that has soared past 150 gigs.\n\nNoah earlier joked about how many times the two men had sold out the Garden and Joel politely asked how many Noah had done it. Noah demurred, saying it wasn’t about the “numbers.”\n\nMiley Cyrus took home her second Grammy of the night — and all time — with record of the year for “Flowers.”\n\nEarlier in the night, she won the first award of the telecast for best pop solo performance, also for “Flowers.”\n\nAfter Meryl Streep and Mark Ronson proclaimed her winner of record of the year, she danced with fellow nominee Billie Eilish as she made her way to the stage.\n\nCyrus made several swerves during her speech, saying: “My life was beautiful yesterday. So please don’t think this is important. Even though it’s very important.”\n\nThen after giving several thank-yous, Cyrus — clad in at least her fourth outfit of the night — said, “I don’t think I’ve forgotten anyone, but I might have forgotten underwear.”\n\nBest new artist winner Victoria Monét thanked the Champagne servers first before adding her team, her fellow nominees and her mother, a single mom “raising this really bad girl.”\n\n“I just want to say to everybody who has a dream. I want you to look at this as an example,” she told the audience.\n\nShe said the award represented a 15-year pursuit and she likened herself to a plant.\n\n“My roots have been growing underneath ground, unseen for so long,” she said. “And I feel like today, I’m sprouting.”\n\nVictoria Monét has been crowned best new artist.\n\nMonét, 34, won the category against Gracie Abrams, Fred qgain.., Noah Kahan, Ice Spice, Jelly Roll, Coco Jones and The War and Treaty.\n\nShe emerged as a frontrunner early — and reigned in The Associated Press’ Grammy predictions — as the only best new artist nominee also nominated in one of the top three general field categories: record of the year.\n\nThe best new artist award, which went to jazz artist Samara Joy last year, is one of the Grammys’ most-anticipated as it is often seen as a bellwether for future success. Recent winners include Olivia Rodrigo, Megan Thee Stallion, Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa. Other winners include Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Amy Winehouse, Adele and Chance the Rapper.\n\n▶ Read more on her win.\n\nJoined by 21 Savage and Brandy, Burna Boy took the Grammys stage to highlight African musican’s ascendance on the global stage.\n\nEarlier in the evening, South Africa’s Tyla won the first best musical performance Grammy for “Water.”\n\nNigeria’s Burna Boy, who has a Grammy for 2020’s “Twice as Tall,” was among the other nominees.\n\n“You know, there is no denying that over the past few years, Afrobeats has swept the globe. And I’m proud to say that over the past year, South Africa’s very own amapiano has truly has truly taken over music in a special way. Shout out to Tyla,” host Trevor Noah, who is from South Africa, said in introducing Burna Boy’s performance.\n\nMusic from the continent varies in styles, geography and history — there’s no one such thing as “African music.” But the new Grammy was intended to highlight regional musical traditions and recognize “recordings that utilize unique local expressions from across the African continent.”\n\n▶ Read more about the genres hailing from the continent and the success they’ve enjoyed.\n\nTravis Scott brought the flames to his Grammy performance. The rap artist performed songs from his latest album “Utopia” including “My eyes” and “FE!N” where in typical Scott fashion he threw down a chair on a stage of constructed rocks and flames. Scott lost the Grammy for best rap album to Killer Mike.\n\nKiller Mike was detained by police and was seen on video being taken away in handcuffs after winning three awards.\n\nIn a pre-performance interview, Scott said his fans give him the energy to perform.\n\n“I go off the energy the fans give me and every night they are ready to go,” he said.\n\nUtopia is Scott’s fourth album after a five-year hiatus.\n\nJoni Mitchell turned the huge Crypto.com Arena into an intimate living room.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Famer sat in a velvet chair surrounded by candles and joined by Brandi Carlile and a chamber orchestra to perform a jazzy, meditative version of her classic “Both Sides Now.”\n\nThe performance was a more luminous version of the comeback concert she gave in 2022 at the Newport Folk Festival, 10 years after an aneurysm that threatened her life and left many thinking she would never sing again. That concert led to a live album that won her a Grammy earlier in the evening.\n\nShe mixed up the lyrics of the original to reflect the moment.\n\n“They shake their heads and say ‘Joni you’ve changed,’” she sang. “Well something’s lost and something’s gained in living every day.’”\n\nJay-Z, Beyoncé and Meryl Streep were among those leaping to their feet for a standing ovation.\n\n“Obviously, it’s subjective because, you know, it’s music and it’s opinion based. But you know, some things, you know, I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year,” Jay-Z said, as the camera cut to his wife, Beyoncé. He was accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award.\n\n“So even by your own metrics, that doesn’t work. Think about that. The most Grammys; never won album of the year. It doesn’t work,” he said as their daughter Blue Ivy stood beside him.\n\n“Some of you are going to go home tonight and feel like you’ve been robbed. Some of you may get robbed. Some of you don’t belong in the category. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that was it, no. When I get nervous, I tell the truth,” he said with a laugh.\n\nStevie Wonder sang a virtual duet with the late Tony Bennett, paying tribute to one of his musical heroes, who died last year at age 96 to kick off a sprawling in memoriam segment on the Grammys that also included Annie Lennox, who shouted for a cease-fire in Palestine.\n\nWonder praised Bennett “not just for his incredible voice” but for “his love for art, his love for peace, his love for unity, his love for civil rights.”\n\nHe then broke into “For Once in My Life,” in sync with Bennett singing on a video screen. Bennett even shouted “Stevie” while looking in Wonder’s direction. The two each had individual hits with the song decades ago, and recorded it together for Bennett’s 2006 “Duets” album.\n\nWonder then sang Bennett’s “The Best is Yet to Come” for a montage that included Harry Belafonte, Robbie Robertson, Jimmy Buffett and Chita Rivera.\n\nLennox then took over to perform Sinéad O’Connor’s “Nothing Compares 2 U” to honor more of the year’s dead, including O’Connor and Shane MacGowan. She concluded by raising a fist and declaring “Artists for cease-fire! Peace in the world!”\n\nJon Batiste then sang Bill Withers’ “Ain’t No Sunshine” and “Lean on Me” to honor others including executive Clarence Avant and Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nWinfrey then paid tribute to Tina Turner, saying “even if those big wheels of time keep on turning, Tina’s voice continues to speak to all of us.”\n\nFantasia then took the stage to sing Turner’s “Proud Mary.”\n\nForget her “Reputation.” Taylor Swift has a brand-new album coming out.\n\nAccepting the award for best pop vocal album — her 13th Grammy — Taylor said she’d been keeping a secret for two years.\n\n“My brand new album comes out April 19. It’s called the Tortured Poets Department. I’m going to go and post the cover right now backstage,” she announced.\n\nAnd so she did.\n\nOn her Instagram, Swift posted a black-and-white image of her reclining across pillows. The top half of her face and lower half of her legs are cut off in the low-contrast image.\n\n“All’s fair in love and poetry...” her caption read.\n\nSwift had provoked mass speculation earlier in the night when her site seemed to go down. Some theorized she was gearing up to release “Reputation (Taylor’s Version),” but cryptic clues on the “crashed” site indicated that might be a misdirect.\n\nAnd so it was.\n\nThe site’s back up now, focused around the upcoming album, with preordering and merchandise options.\n\nGrammy nominee Olivia Rodrigo drove a stake through “vampire” from her “GUTS” album onstage.\n\nStanding alone against a dark backdrop tinged with red, Rodrigo belted the song with blood — or the approximation of it — smeared on her face.\n\n“I love singing about rage,” Rodrigo told The Associated Press ahead of the show. “I think I’m a very happy kind of, you know, generally excited person. And I think that in my music and my songwriting, I can kind of express parts of myself that are not so easy to talk about in everyday life, and so rage definitely applies to that.”\n\n“I love just having a song where I can kind of scream and get all of my emotions out. I think it’s so therapeutic,” she continued.\n\n▶ Read more from the interview here and the AP’s review of “GUTS” here.\n\nSZA brought a dumpster fire to the Grammys after a year that was anything but.\n\nOn a night when she’s the top nominee and has already won two Grammys, she opened her performance in an alley setting, wearing a slung-low fedora and trench coat with flames shooting out of a dumpster.\n\nShe shed the suit and the stage set when her medley shifted to her huge hit “Kill Bill,” and was joined by vinyl-suited dancers doing stunts with swords as though they were in the song’s Quentin Tarantino film namesake.\n\nKiller Mike was detained at the Grammy Awards on Sunday after the rapper won three Grammy awards including his first in more than two decades.\n\nIn a video, Mike was shown handcuffed and escorted out by Los Angeles police at the Crypto.com Arena after some joyous moments for him at the Grammys’ Premiere Ceremony, where he won three awards in quick succession.\n\nA police spokesperson didn’t offer a name or additional details, but confirmed a Black male was detained.\n\nA representative for Mike did not immediately respond to an emailed or text request for comment.\n\n▶ Read more.\n\nKarol G won her the Grammy for best música urbana album.\n\n“This is my first time at the Grammys and this is my first time holding my own Grammy,” she said as the crowd cheered.\n\nThe Colombian singer, songwriter and actor previously won five Latin Grammy Awards, including best new artist.\n\n“I’m super happy, I’m super nervous, I’m super excited to be in front of so many legends that I admire and respect,” she said.\n\nTracy Chapman electrified and surprised the Grammy audience by teaming up with Luke Combs for a twangy, soulful duet of her “Fast Car.”\n\nThe single from Chapman’s self-titled 1988 debut album reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, and earned her three Grammy nominations, including record of the year and song of the year.\n\nThe track is written from the point of view of a woman whose life hasn’t worked out the way she envisioned.\n\n“You got a fast car, I want a ticket to anywhere. Maybe we make a deal. Maybe together we can get somewhere. Any place is better startin’ from zero, got nothing to lose,” she and Combs sang.\n\nCombs had a massive hit with his cover version and the song won two awards at the CMA Awards. The country star said he was first drawn to the song while driving with his father.\n\nThe cover sparked discussions of what it takes to make a country hit — and who can make one.\n\nChapman rarely makes public appearances. She has only performed for the cameras three times since wrapping up her last tour in 2009.\n\nMiley Cyrus has her first Grammy.\n\nShe won the first award handed out on the telecast — for best pop solo performance for “Flowers.”\n\nIn a career that goes back to her Hannah Montana childhood, she’s been nominated eight times, but had never won before. She has several more chances tonight, including nominations for record and song of the year.\n\nMiley said from the stage that she “just got stuck in the rain and traffic and thought I was going to miss this moment.”\n\nShe kept presenter Mariah Carey on the stage for her speech, saying: “I could’ve missed the award, that’s fine, but not Mariah Carey.”\n\nCyrus donned a different dress from her carpet walk.\n\nIn a marked contrast to Golden Globes host Jo Koy’s jests about Taylor Swift, Grammys host Trevor Noah vowed to defend the artist from the ire of NFL fans.\n\n“Can I just say I think it is so unfair how NFL’s fans have been complaining about the cameras cutting to Taylor Swift? Right. Like she’s controlling the cameras at the games,” he said. “Like just let her live.”\n\nHe proposed a spot of revenge: “Every time someone says ‘Taylor Swift,’ I’m going to cut the cameras to someone who played football. That’s what I’ll do. Cut back just like that.”\n\nThe camera panned to an unaware Terry Crews, who was a linebacker before becoming an actor.\n\n“Oh, yeah. You like that, Terry Crews? You like that? Terry Crews You better fix your face,” Noah advised the actor, who eventually cracked up.\n\nBut Noah still had some jokes for Swift, noting how “as Taylor Swift moves through the room, the local economy around those tables improves.”\n\n“Lionel Richie?” Trevor Noah quipped. “Now Lionel Wealthy.”\n\nDua Lipa went from construction-site chic to disco cool as she opened the Grammys telecast with a medley of her hits including “Training Season,” “Houdini.”\n\nShe and about a dozen male dancers opened the show in the middle of the floor among the nominees and other audience members. She climbed an apparatus that looked like part scaffolding, part playground equipment while the men lifted and rolled it.\n\nShe made her way to the stage where a group of female dancers joined the crew and the setup shifted to mirrored disco.\n\nShe’s up for record of the year later for “Dance the Night” from “Barbie.”"
