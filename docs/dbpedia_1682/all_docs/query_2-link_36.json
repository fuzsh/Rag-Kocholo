        "text": "In 1921 Frederic G.Melcher had the Newbery Medal designed by René Paul Chambellan. The bronze medal has the winner's name and the date engraved on the back. The American Library Association Executive Board in 1922 delegated to the Children's Librarians' Section the responsibility for selecting the book to receive the Newbery Medal.\n\nThe inscription on the Newbery Medal still reads \"Children's Librarians' Section,\" although the section has changed its name four times and its membership now includes both school and public library children's librarians in contrast to the years 1922-58, when the section, under three different names, included only public library children's librarians. Today the Medal is administered by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of ALA.\n\nHow the Newbery Medal Came to Be\n\nThe Newbery Medal is awarded annually by the American Library Association for the most distinguished American children's book published the previous year. On June 22, 1921, Frederic G. Melcher proposed the award to the American Library Association meeting of the Children's Librarians' Section and suggested that it be named for the eighteenth-century English bookseller John Newbery. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by the children's librarians, and Melcher's official proposal was approved by the ALA Executive Board in 1922. In Melcher's formal agreement with the board, the purpose of the Newbery Medal was stated as follows: \"To encourage original creative work in the field of books for children. To emphasize to the public that contributions to the literature for children deserve similar recognition to poetry, plays, or novels. To give those librarians, who make it their life work to serve children's reading interests, an opportunity to encourage good writing in this field.\"\n\nThe Newbery Award thus became the first children's book award in the world. Its terms, as well as its long history, continue to make it the best known and most discussed children's book award in this country.\n\nFrom the beginning of the awarding of the Newbery and Caldecott Medals, committees could, and usually did, cite other books as worthy of attention. Such books were referred to as Newbery or Caldecott \"runners-up.\" In 1971 the term \"runners-up\" was changed to \"honor books.\" The new terminology was made retroactive so that all former runners-up are now referred to as Newbery or Caldecott Honor Books.\n\nNewbery Honor Seal\n\nTerms\n\n1. The Medal shall be awarded annually to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children published by an American publisher in the United States in English during the preceding year. There are no limitations as to the character of the book considered except that it be original work. Honor books may be named. These shall be books that are also truly distinguished.\n\n2. The Award is restricted to authors who are citizens or residents of the United States.\n\n3. The committee in its deliberations is to consider only the books eligible for the award, as specified in the terms.\n\nDefinitions\n\n1. “Contribution to American literature” indicates the text of a book. It also implies that the committee shall consider all forms of writing—fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. Reprints, compilations and abridgements are not eligible.\n\n2. A “contribution to American literature for children” shall be a book for which children are an intended potential audience. The book displays respect for children’s understandings, abilities, and appreciations. Children are defined as persons of ages up to and including fourteen, and books for this entire age range are to be considered.\n\n3. “Distinguished” is defined as:\n\n• Marked by eminence and distinction; noted for significant achievement.\n\n• Marked by excellence in quality.\n\n• Marked by conspicuous excellence or eminence.\n\n• Individually distinct.\n\n4. “Author” may include co-authors. The author(s) may be awarded the medal posthumously.\n\n5. The term \"original work\" may have several meanings. For purposes of these awards,\n\nit is defined as follows:\n\n• \"Original work\" means that the text was created by this writer and no one else. It may include original retellings of traditional literature, provided the words are the author’s own.\n\n• Further, \"original work\" means that the text is presented here for the first time and has not been previously published elsewhere in this or any other form. Text reprinted or compiled from other sources are not eligible. Abridgements are not eligible.\n\n6. “In English” means that the committee considers only books written and published in English. This requirement DOES NOT limit the use of words or phrases in another language where appropriate in context.\n\n7. “American literature published in the United States” means that books first published in previous years in other countries are not eligible. Books published simultaneously in the U.S. and another country may be eligible. Books published in a U.S. territory, or U.S. commonwealth are eligible.\n\n8. “Published…in the preceding year” means that the book has a publication date in that year, was available for purchase in that year, and has a copyright date no later than that year. A book might have a copyright date prior to the year under consideration but, for various reasons, was not published until the year under consideration. If a book is published prior to its year of copyright as stated in the book, it shall be considered in its year of copyright as stated in the book. The intent of the definition is that every book be eligible for consideration, but that no book be considered in more than one year.\n\n9. “Resident” specifies that the author has established and maintains a residence in the United States, U.S. territory, or U.S. commonwealth as distinct from being a casual or occasional visitor.\n\n10. The term, “only the books eligible for the award,” specifies that the committee is not to consider the entire body of the work by an author or whether the author has previously won the award. The committee’s decision is to be made following deliberation about the books of the specified calendar year.\n\nCriteria\n\n1. In identifying “distinguished contribution to American literature,” defined as text, in a book for children,\n\na. Committee members need to consider the following:\n\nInterpretation of the theme or concept\n\nPresentation of information including accuracy, clarity, and organization\n\nDevelopment of a plot\n\nDelineation of characters\n\nDelineation of a setting\n\nAppropriateness of style.\n\nNote: Because the literary qualities to be considered will vary depending on content, the committee need not expect to find excellence in each of the named elements. The book should, however, have distinguished qualities in all of the elements pertinent to it.\n\nb.Committee members must consider excellence of presentation for a child audience.\n\n2. Each book is to be considered as a contribution to American literature. The committee is to make its decision primarily on the text. Other components of a book, such as illustrations, overall design of the book, etc., may be considered when they make the book less effective.\n\n3. The book must be a self-contained entity, not dependent on other media (i.e., sound or film equipment) for its enjoyment.\n\nNote: The committee should keep in mind that the award is for literary quality and quality presentation for children. The award is not for didactic content or popularity.\n\nAdopted by the ALSC Board, January 1978. Revised, Midwinter 1987. Revised, Annual 2008."
