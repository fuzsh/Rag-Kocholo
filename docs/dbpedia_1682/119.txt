Quotable Lyrics:

D-J Khaled

Hey, yeah (we the best)

All I do is win win win no matter what

Got money on my mind I can never get enough

And every time I step up in the buildin’

Everybody hands go up

And they stay there

And they say yeah

And they stay there

Up down, up down, up down

‘Cause all I do is win win win
