My ancestor, Thomas Fitch, is believed to have arrived in New England during the Great Migration (1620-1640), a significant period when around 80,000 people migrated from England to the American colonies. This era commenced with the arrival of the Pilgrims in the Plymouth Colony in 1620, followed by Puritans establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629. Join me as I delve into Thomas Fitch’s life in England and his contributions to the Connecticut Colony.

Thomas Fitch’s Life in England

Thomas Fitch was born on October 14, 1612, in Bocking, Essex, and was the eldest child of Thomas Fitch Sr. and Anne Reeve. He had eight siblings: Zachary Fitch, John Fitch, James Fitch, Nathaniel Fitch, Jeremy Fitch, Samuel Fitch, Joseph Fitch and Mary Fitch.

On November 1, 1632, Thomas married Anne Stacie. Together they had five children: Thomas Fitch Jr., Sarah Fitch, Ann Fitch, John Fitch and Mary Fitch.

Fitch was a clothier by trade and a landlord. Following his father’s death, he became very wealthy, inheriting multiple houses, buildings, tenements and lands.

Founding Settler of Norwalk, Connecticut

Sources differ on Thomas Fitch’s arrival in New England, with some indicating he arrived in 1638 and settled in Norwalk, Connecticut, while others suggest he emigrated with his wife, children, and mother around 1650.

Despite these discrepancies, Fitch is recognized as a founding settler of Norwalk. His name is engraved on the Founders Stone in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery, which honours the community’s first settlers, the first of whom arrived in 1649.

Thomas Fitch’s Extensive Property

Thomas Fitch achieved remarkable financial success in Norwalk, becoming its wealthiest citizen with more land holdings than any other settler. In 1652, he purchased a centrally located home on four acres. That same year, he acquired several additional acres of land and was granted four more plots totalling 15 acres and four roods.

During his subsequent years in Norwalk, Fitch continued to acquire land through grants, accumulating more than 35 acres of various terrain types. He also purchased another house lot. Between 1686 and 1688, Fitch aggregated a total of 64 acres across every part of the town.

Involvement in Civic Affairs

Thomas Fitch was one of the most active citizens in civic affairs in Norwalk. He held various important positions, including Norwalk’s Clerk of the Train Band, Recorder of Laws, and Selectman in 1659. Beginning in 1669, he served as King’s Commissioner for 25 years.

Fitch represented Norwalk in the Connecticut General Court in 1673, 1676, 1680 to 1686, 1691 to 1692, and 1694. He also served as Deputy Governor of the colony.
