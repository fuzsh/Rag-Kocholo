        "text": "Thomas Fitch Inherited an estate near Braintree, Essex County, England.\n\nHe was the oldest son of his family. he was named executor of father's estate with Uncle William, born between 1574 and 1583, at Brason Head farm (he was at least 22 when father died in 1605).

He also served as deputy governor of Connecticut. Thomas Fitch and his brother, Joseph Fitch, were both among the founders of Norwalk, but Joseph, the younger brother, soon removed and finally settled on a large farm at Windsor, Connecticut near the Hartford line.\n\nThe military history of Norwalk began in 1655 when Thomas Fitch and lieutenant Richard Olmstead were appointed by the Colony of Connecticut to \"look after\" the Indians, who began to become troublesome. They had under their command, eighteen horsemen, four of them from Norwalk. Fitch and Olmstead and their horsemen had a very quieting effect on the Indians and they did not cause the Norwalk people much trouble until 1675. Thomas's residence was somewhere near the home later occupied by Enos Osborn on East Avenue. Thomas died in Norwalk in 1704 at the age of 92 years.\n\n----------------------\n\nThomas's will:\n\nWILL OF THOMAS FITCH\n\nTo all persons whome these presents shall come: Greeting, I Thomas Fitch, Sen. of Norwalk in the County of Fairfield in New England, being weak in body but perfect in mind and understanding do by these presents make and confirm this my last will and testament to stand and abide Revocking all former wills and do solemly hoping upon good grounds Commit my soul in ye hands Into my Creator and Redeemer.
