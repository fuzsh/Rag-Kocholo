Martha Kenedy, of Ellington, Jan. 11, 1807, a late settler in Connecticut.\n\nALLYN, HON. MATHEW, was an early and important settler at Hartford, as early as 1638: he drew 110 acres of land in the Hartford land division in 1639. In 1639, he was sued for \"seventy-four rods of corn,''(for defect of his fence.) Plaintiff in an action of slander against John Coggin, Sept. 2, 1641. In 1644, Mr. Allyn presented to the General Court, several petitions against the church in Hartford, for relief in his censure of excommunication, in which he claimed he had been wronged by the church. The Court adjudged, that said Allyn by his petitions and his expressions in Court, had accused the church of Hartford, and that he should produce in Court, the particulars of his charges, that they might be answered. In Oct. [25,] 1644, the Court decided that he had not proved his charges against the church, and that he should answer their rejoinder in the matter in Court, Nov. 27th, and answer for his former contempt. In the General Court, Sept. 12, 1650, Mathew and Thomas Allyn, brothers, had several lawsuits, in one of which, the record says, the Court did \"further conclude that Mathew Allyn should pay unto his brother Thomas, the full sum of Â£5,\" &c.\n\nMathew Allyn was freed from training, April, 1654, for a time. August 18, 1658, Mr. Mathew Allyn was appointed by the General Court, to stand as a Committee, with Mr. Henry Clary Clark, of Windsor, to act in disposing of lands at Massacoe. May 17, 1660, the worshipful Governor and Deputy Governor, (Winthrop and Maj. Mason,) were chosen Commissioners, for the year then ensuing, and Mr. Allyn chosen as a reserve. Mr. Mathew Allyn was also appointed moderator to supply the place of the governor and deputy, in case of their occasional absence from the General Court. August 28, 1661, the General Court granted to Hon. Mathew Allyn, 400 acres of upland, and 100 acres of meadow, where he could find it in Connecticut, on the same terms as were given to Jonathan Gilbert.\n\nIn May, 1663, the General Court of Connecticut, appointed Wm. VVadsworth, James Avery and Lieut. Smith, a Committee to view the lands at \"Hamonoscitt,\" (Hamonasset,) and see whether it was fit for a plantation, and if not prejudicial to Saybrook, to lay it out to Mr. Mathew Allyn, Capt. Talcott, John Allyn and Mr. Wyllys, according to the grant of the Court. But if found to be prejudicial to Saybrook, then to lay out what they should judge right to the town of Saybrook, and the remainder to Mr. Mathew Allyn, Capt. Talcott, John Allyn, Mr. Willys, Mr. Joseph Haynes, or Mr. Daniel Clark, as the Court should determine, as far as it should go, according to their grants. Mr. Allyn is entered on the Town Record at Killingworth, as a large land holder there, and first settler, but there is no other evidence that he ever resided there, and he probably never did. He owned land in Windsor, in 1640. The exact time he removed from Hartford to Windsor, is not known.\n\nAfter several years' residence at Hartford, he removed to Windsor. In 1640, he owned at least three lots of land in Hartford. He was a member of the General and Particular Court, three sessions, in 1648, and Juror two sessions: Deputy two sessions in 1649, four sessions in 1650, He or his son John, three sessions in 1650, and four in 1651; three sessions in 1654; two in 1655; two in 1656; one in May 1664, and one session in 1665; four in 1657; two in 1653, as magistrate, also five sessions in 1659; three in 1660, and three in 1661, and two as moderator, in 1661; as moderator in May, in 1662, and three sessions as magistrate; one as moderator in 1662: also attended in 1663 and '64, and afterwards. Mr. Allyn was frequently appointed upon important Committees by the General Court. In 1658, he, with Hon. Henry Clark of Windsor, was appointed to dispose of lands at Massacoe, according to a previous order of Court.\n\nMr. Allyn was probably married before he came to this country. He was a proprietor in the undivided lands in Hartford, and received 110 acres in the division of lands in Hartford, in 1639, the fourth largest lot distributed. Mr. Allyn was a member of Mr. Hooker's Church: he was a man of superior talents, energetic, willful and obstinate in all his projects. After a few years at Hartford, he became involved in a difficulty in the church at Hartford, but his brethren knew his power and influence with the settlers, and rather than to have an open quarrel with him, they induced him to remove to Windsor, where he remained until his death. Few men in the Colony, had more influence, or received more honors from the people, than Mr. Allyn. He had been a member of both branches of the General Court; a Magistrate and Judge, a member of the United Congress, of New England; one of the signers of the petition to Charles H., for the Charter of Connecticut, and held many town offices. He died at Windsor, in 1670. His will was dated Jan. 30, 1670. His wife, Margaret, sole Executrix. He gave his wife the use of all his estate, for her life, of which he was then possessed, and desired his sons, John, (the Secretary,) Thomas, and his son-in-law, Benjamin Newbury, to improve the property for her comfort. After her decease, he gave his son John, all his lands and estate in the bounds of the Town of Kennilworth, the farm and stock upon it: also confirmed to him all his lands in Hartford, which he gave him as his marriage portion. Also a large estate to his son Thomas: to his daughter, Mary Newbery, wife of Benjamin: to his granddaughter Mary Maudsley, he provided liberally after the death of his wife. Inventory made Feb 14, 1670, Â£466, 17* 12d.

Benjamin Newbury, of Windsor.\n\nAnother daughter m. Maudsley, and had a daughter, Mary Maudsley, noticed by Hon. Mathew, as his granddaughter, in his will.\n\n(The name of Maudsley, has nearly disappeared in Connecticut, and changed to Mosely, particularly in Glastenbury.)\n\n*ALLYN, SECRETARY JOHN, the eldest son of Hon. Mathew, of Windsor, was one of the most efficient men in Connecticut. He was, when young, elected a member of the General Court, as Deputy, one session in 1661; two in 1662, and as Magistrate in the Particular and Genertal Court, twice, in 1662, and three sessions as Magistrate and Secretary in 1663; twice in 1664, and once in 1665: and at various other sessions. He was again elected Secretary of Connecticut, in 1667, which he held until 1695 inclusive. The ancient records of the Colony and Town of Hartford, are ample evidence of his intelligence and industry. Col. Allyn and Mr. Clark, in 1657, were desired to present a list of names of such persons as desired to be members of the first Troop in the Colony, to be approved by the General Court. He was confirmed as Cornet in said Troop, in 1657/8. In 1658, he, with Edward Stebbing, Nathaniel Ward, and Jonathan Barnard, were appointed to attend to the charges of the last Council, as to the withdrawers from the Church in Hartford. In *1659, he was one of the Committee to divide the Podunk lands, formerly possessed by the Indians, and treat with them for other lands there. In 1661, he was nominated \"to be put up\" for election for Magistrate. In 1661/2, John Talcott and Lieut. John Allyn, had granted to them 600 acres of upland, and 100 acres of meadow, equally.\n\nIn 1662, Mr. Allyn, Mr. H. Wolcott, and Wm. Wadsworth, were authorized, if those who were indebted to the Country did not pay their Taxes in season, for the Committee to procure other provisions, and make the delinquents pay the bills for such corn purchased.\n\n* EPITAPH.--Here lyes interred the body of the Honourable VT Colonel John Allyn, who served His Generation in the Capacity of a Magistrate, Secretary of the Colony of Connecticut 34 year, who dyed Nov. 6, in the year 1696.\n\nOctober 9, 1662, Lieut.
