She was probably a second wife. Nothing futher found in Savage concerning this settler.\n\nJOHN BROWN\n\nhad a wife, Mary, and a family of three sons and five daughters. He removed about 166_ to Newark, N.J., where probably further records of him and his family may be found.\n\nALEXANDER BRYAN (or Bryant) (1602-1679)\n\nson of Thomas Bryan of Alesbury, Eng., was baptized there Sept. 29, 1602.

Peter Prudden (d. 1656); was a minister before coming to New England. It is very probable that those of the New Haven Company who left New Haven by 1640 and went to Milford had been under the ministration of this minister in England, and for that reason followed him to whatever place he should settle.\n\nDeacon B. by his wife Hannah Hawkins (?) (d. 1647), had sons and daughters. He went to Boston \"to seek for them a Pastor\" (says the Church Record) and died there in 1657. His grandson, Rev.

He had five sons and a daughter Elizabeth, b. 1647. His wife Alice, d. Dec. 29, 1649. A line of ancestry to English Lords and members of the Royal family is said to be found in this family.\n\nNICHOLAS CAMP (1597-1652-8)\n\nperhaps son of John Campe (d. 1630) of Nasing, England, had three wives, possibly more; by his wife Sarah (d. 1645) he had Abigail (162_-1648), wife of Nathaniel Baldwin (16__-1650), Nicholas (1629-1707), William (163_-17__), and perhaps others.

Aug. 29, 1647).\n\nFor his third wife he married July 14, 1652, Mrs. Kattern (_____) Thompson, widow of Anthony Thompson (d. 1648) of New Haven. Evidently he died before 1658, for in that year she is called in New Haven records \"Widow Camp.\" He probably had no children by the third wife.\n\nSergt. THOMAS CANFIELD (16__-1689)\n\nwith his wife, Phebe Crance, who probably was in some way related to the Henry and Benj. Crane of Wethersfield, Conn., was a prominent man in Milford, a sergeant of militia, and a representative to the Connecticut Colony 1673-74; he left two sons and seven or more daughters.\n\nDeacon GEORGE CLARK (16__-1690)\n\nwith his wife, Mary, came from Wethersfield to Milford in 1639. Three of his sons were prominent in Milford affairs:\n\nGeorge was an ensign.\n\nSarah became the mother of Jonathan Law, Gov. of Connecticut Colony in 17__.\n\nSavage states he \"was called carpenter for distinction and this is all I know about him.\"\n\nGEORGE CLARK (16__-1690)\n\nthe \"Farmer,\" was a brother of Hon. Daniel Clark of Windsor, Conn., one of the patentees under the charter from Charles II. They with their brother John Clark of Guilford, came from England, where they had property which is mentioned in the wills of these three brothers; possibly Samuel Clark of New Haven was another brother.\n\nHis only son, John, died without leaving any children; a daughter, Ruth, married Thomas Fitch of Norwalk; her grandson Thomas Fitch (d. 1774) was Governor of Connecticut Colony; Abigail married Rev. Abraham Pierson, the first Rector of Yale College; Sarah married Capt. Reynold Marvin (d. 1676), the celebrated Indian fighter; she married in 1677, Capt. Joseph Sill.

In 1676 he had a second wife, Mrs. Mary (Baldwin) Plumb (b. Apr. 21, 1621, d. 1708), widow of Robert Plumb (d. 1655).\n\nHe died in 1681 without leaving any children.\n\nBENJAMIN FENN (16__-1672)\n\nwas a proprietor in Dorchester in 1637. It is suggested by Savage that he \"may have come over in the Mary and James in 1630, but his name is not mentioned until 1638.\"\n\nIt is more probable that he came over with the New Haven Company, or perhaps with the friends and parishioners of the Rev. Peter Prudden, who came in the Bristol at a later period in 1637, according to the History of New Haven. He was a man of prominence in Milford, was a Representative, Asssistant Governor, 1665-72; his estate at his death was large, both here and in England; he left lands in Aylesbury, but he was credited with 80 pounds in New Haven records in 1638; probably he in later years received additional funds from property in England, for his estate was inventorie at __ pounds in 1672. (trans. note: they don't know how many pounds, yet say it was large? How do they know that?]\n\nHe left sons and daughters. An unbroken line of Benjamin Fenns for ten generations can be recorded in this country.\n\nDeacon JOHN FLETCHER (1602-1661)\n\nbefore coming to Milford was in Wethersfield; he joined the church in 1641; according to Savage he had tehn been living in Milford for two years.\n\nHis only son, Samuel, born in 1649, died young.\n\nOf his six daughters, five were married when his wife Mary Ward (1607-168_) made her will in 1679, she then being the widow of John Clark (d. 1674).\n\nTHOMAS FORD (16__-1661)\n\nin Milford among the first settlers, married Elizabeth Knowles (d. 1673), daughter of Alex.

Roger Newton (d. 1683), the second minister of Milford. In March, 1663, Mrs. Elizabeth (Knowles) Ford married Eliezer Rogers.\n\nLt. WILLIAM FOWLER (d. 1660-1)\n\nwas one of the seven pillars of the foundation of the church. He was a builder of the first mill of the colony, which has now been in the possession of the Fowler family for ten generations. \"It is now acknowledged to be the oldest business (or manufacturing) establishment in the county.\"\n\nNo record of his wife is known. In the New Haven list of 1638, he had a family of three, and an estate of 800 pounds, as he brought his sons William and John with him, and who were undoubtedly minors in 1638, judging from the dates of their marriages, which took place in 1643 and 1647.\n\nDeacon JOHN FOWLER (16__-1677)\n\nremoved from Milford to Guilford about 1648, where he died in May, 1677; his widow, Mary Hubbard, daughter of George Hubbard (d. 1683) of Milford and Guilford, died April 13, 1703. He had two sons and four daughters; none of the daughters were married; one of these daughters, Mehitable Fowler, born in 1656, died March 18, 1751, being 95 years old at her death.\n\nWILLIAM FOWLER, Jr. (16__-1682)\n\nwhose name is also engraved on the Memorial Bridge, as well as that of his father, Lt. William Fowler, married, 164_ Mary Tapp, daughter of Edmund Tapp (d. 1653); for many years he lived in New Haven. In 1645 he built the mill at what is now called Whitneyville, where Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin, established in 1798, a factory for manufacturing firearms.\n\nHe married in 1670 Mrs. Elizabeth (Alsop) Baldwin, widow of Richard Balwin (1622-1665), and left sons and daughters who married and left descendants.\n\nSTEPHEN FREEMAN (16__-1675)\n\nin Milford in 1646; had a house-lot, but did not become a resident until 1658. In a few years he removed to Newark, N. J.; there Thomas Judd of Waterbury married his daughter Sarah, and perhaps he came back to Connecticut; his widow, Hanna, may have married Robert Porter (d. 1689) of Farmington, Conn.\n\nHe married 165_, Hannah Atwood, daughter of Captain Atwood (1604-1654) and had Hannah, b. 1655; Mary, 1658; Samuel, 1662; Martha and Sarah.\n\nDr. JASPER GUNN (1606-1670)\n\nwith his wife(?) Ann (b. 1610), or what is more probable, his sister Ann, came in the ship Defense in July, 1635, settled at Roxbury, and was a proprietor there May 25, 1636; he was at Milford at an earlyd ate; according to Lambert he came there from Wethersfield. Savage states that he was in Hartford from 1646 to 1657, and then removed to Milford.\n\nHe left four sons, Jobama, Abel, Daniel (d. 1690), Samuel, and daughter Mehitable Fenn.\n\nJudging from the dates of marriage of his children, most of them, if not all, were born in this country. On the Memorial Bridge his wife's name is engraved as Sarah. In his will he calls John Smith (d. 1684) and Joseph Peck (d. 1701) his brothers. In that case Sarah might have been a sister of Joseph Hawley of Stratford, as it is believed that Mrs. John Smith was Grace Hawley, a sister of that Joseph Hawley.\n\nEDMUND or EDWARD HARVEY (16__-May 22, 1648)\n\nwas in Milford in 1639; came from Wethersfield. Savage states that he was a merchant and brought two daughters with him, one aged nine years, the other four; perhaps also brought a wife, but more probably was a widower, for he married about 1540, Martha, and had Josiah, baptized December 29, 1640, and Hannah, b. 1646; he removed to Fairfield and died there May 22, 1648, leaving a daughter in England aged 22 years, two more as above stated aged 18 and 14 years (in 1648), all by a former wife.

His will was made May 9, 1694; he died about 1698; had twelve or more children. For a tradition of his rescuing an Indian from certain death, see Lambert's History of New Haven Colony [trans. note: I should find that book, aye?], also History of Derby.\n\nGEORGE HUBBARD (16__-1683)\n\nwas in Milford in 1643; he removed to Guilford in 1650 with his son-in-law, John Fowler (d. 1677).\n\nJOHN LANE (16__- Sept. 10, 1669)\n\ncame from Wethersfield to Milford in or before 1640 with his wife Kattareen (?) who died before 1662, for in that year he married Mrs. Mary (_____) Camp (16__-1669), of New Haven, by whom he probably had no children.\n\nHis daughter Katareen (163_-167_) married Nov. 8, 1653, John Tuttle (1631-1683) of New Haven; their descendants are recorded in the Tuttle Family Book.\n\nHis son Isaac removed to Middletown.\n\nHis will mentions Samuel, Edward and Mary Camp, the children of his wife by her first husband, Edward Camp. His will was made Sept. 10, 1669; inventory taken Sept. 16, 1669; amount 441 pounds, 15s, 1d.\n\nTHOMAS LAWRENCE\n\none of the Wethersfield people, died in 1648. Nothing further learned of him in Savage or Lambert.\n\nHENRY LYON (16__-1712)\n\nremoved from Milford to Fairfield before 1652, when he married the only daughter of William Bateman (d. 1658), who in his will, made March 24, 1656, gave one-half of his estate to his son-in-law, Henry Lyon.\n\nDeacon RICHARD PLATT (1603-1684)\n\nwas the son of John Platt, of Bovington, England. With his wife, Mary (d. Jan. 24, 1671-6) , he probably brought four children, Mary, John, Isaac and Sarah; although in the New Haven list of 1639 his family is only numbered as four instead of six. His estate at that time was 200 pounds. The inventory of his estate in 1683 amounted to ___ pounds. [trans note: arrgghhh].\n\nU.S. Senator Thomas C. Platt, of New York, is a descendant.\n\nThe town of Plattsville, N.Y. was named after a member of this family. [trans. note: I wonder if he means Plattsburg.]\n\nROBERT PLUMB (1617-1655)\n\nin Milford in 1639; came from Wethersfield. He married Jan. 9, 1642, Mary Baldwin (1621-1708), daughter of Sylvester Baldwin (d. 1638). He had a daughter, Mary, and five sons.\n\nHis widow married in 1676 William East, and died in 1708.\n\nU.S. Senator P. B.

Peter Prudden (1601-1656), had according to New Haven Records in 1638 a family of three persons and an estate of 10 pounds.\n\nAs his daughter Ann married in 1640, and his daughter Elizabeth married in 1648 or before, they must have been with him in New Haven, and consequently he must have been at that time a widower; no record has been found of his wife in New England.\n\nRev. PETER PRUDDEN (1601-1656)\n\nhad at New Haven in 1638 or '39, an estate of 500 pounds, a family of four, and at his death in July, 1656, he also still possessed lands in Edgton, York County, England, where he may have been born, and where he married his wife, Joanna Boyse. He had three sons:\n\nSamuel (163_-1685), who lived in Milford.\n\nRev. John (1646-1725), who died at Newark(?) N. J.\n\nPeter, baptized in 1652 and who died young.\n\nOf his six daughters several married and left descendants.\n\nThe widow married Sept. 19, 1671, Capt. Thomas Willett (d. 1674) and after 1674 Rev. John Bishop (d. 1693) of Stamford. Her will was made Nov. 8, 1681, in which she mentions all her children that were living, and she probably died soon after.\n\nTHOMAS REED\n\nmay be the same person who was living in Newtown, L.I.\n\nSergeant EDWARD RIGGS (1605-166_)\n\nson of Edward Riggs (1586-1672) and Elizabeth (d. 1635) of Roxbury. He came from Wethersfield in 1640, or before. In 1654 he removed to Paugussett (afterwards called Derby). He married at Roxbury in 1635 Elizabeth Roosa [tran. note: last letter hard to read. could be an 'a'], and had Edward, Samuel, Joseph and Mary.\n\nGen. Joseph Wheeler, U.S.A., retired, of Alabama, is a descendant.\n\nIn 1666 Edward Riggs removed to Newark (NJ) with his family, except Samuel, who remained in Derby.\n\nWILLIAM ROBERTS\n\ncame from Wethersfield before 1645.\n\nJAMES ROGERS (1615-1688)\n\nalthough his name is not recorded on the map of Milford, is engraved on the \"Memorial Bridge\" as one of the first settlers. He was a brother of John Rogers (d. 1684), and came over to New England on the ship Increase. He was early in Stratford, where he married before 1640 Elisabeth Rowland, daughter of Henry Rowland of Stratford.\n\nHe had six children in Stratford and Milford and removed to New Lonson after 1658. He was considered, next to Gov. Winthrop, the richest man in Connecticut Colony. His widow married before 1691 ____Wheeler, for she is mentioned in her father's will as Elizabeth Wheeler \"who had been wife of John Rogers.\"\n\nJOHN ROGERS (16__-1684).\n\nEDWARD SANFORD (16__-1681)\n\nwas in Dorchester in 1634, and in Milford in 1639.
