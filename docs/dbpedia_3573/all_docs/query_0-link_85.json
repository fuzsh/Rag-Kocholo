        "text": "This Page Is Under Construction\n\nThe Talcott Family In Vernon\n\nJohn Talcott came to Hartford, CT in 1636 with Rev. Thomas Hooker and was instrumental in establishing the young colony. The Talcott family played a role in establishing not just Hartford, but also Wethersfield, Glastonbury, Bolton and Vernon. Father's secured available land on which to establish their sons. As the river valley grew they turned to the east for open space.\n\nFollowing is a brief account of how the Talcott family, all descendants of John Talcott, came to Vernon and impacted our town.\n\nMost of the following is from S. V. Talcott's 1876 book \"Talcott Pedigree in England and America from 1665 to 1876,\" which is available online. The numbers after each name represent the individual's number in the genealogy. The symbol is a link to the Find A Grave memorial for additional information on other relatives. The frequent use of 'John's' and Benjamin's can be confusing, so they are labeled as 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe Connecticut Founders\n\nJohn 1 Talcott #1 (?-1606) - The family of \"Talcot\" was originally from Warwickshire, England. John 1, a descendant of the Warwickshire family, was living in Colchester, Essex county, previous to 1568. He possessed real estate in Colchester and adjacent towns, which, with his personal property, he bequeathed, at his death, to his children and grandchildren. Although he signed his name \"Taylcot,\" and it is variously spelled in the body of the will, still the name on all the old records in England is spelled \"Talcot or Talcott.\"\n\nHe was twice married, and had two sons by his first wife - John and Robert. He died in Colchester about November 1, 1606. He made a will which was admitted to probate on the 12th of November, 1606. John was apparently quite wealthy as in his will he lists a number of houses with shops and gardens. The entire will is in the Talcott Genealogy.\n\nJohn 2 Talcott #2 (??-1604) settled in Braintree, about fourteen miles from Colchester, and died there in 1604, shortly before his father, leaving a family of children all minors. According to his father's will the properties that would have been his had he outlived his father went to his brother Robert.\n\nThe eldest of John's sons was John 3, who came to New England. This decision may have been influenced by his grandfather's estates passing to his uncle. As the story was passed down the family in America it may also have played a role in parents securing land for their sons.\n\nFrom John (2), of Braintree, England all the Talcott's in America are descended. No other family of the name ever emigrated to this country.\n\nJohn 3 Talcott #11 (1594-1660) , the immigrant, was the son of John 2 Talcott and Anne Skinner. He was born in Braintree, Essex County, England and left a minor by the death of his father in 1604, the only son. John married Dorothy, the daughter of (probably) Mark Mott, Esq., and Francis Gutter, of Braintree, Essex Co., England. While still in England they had three children - Mary, John and Samuel.\n\nHe came to Boston, Mass., with others of Rev. Hooker's Company in the ship Lion, which sailed from England June 22, 1632, and arrived here on Sept. 16, 1632. The ship was Commanded by Capt. Mason and had 123 passengers (amongst whom were 50 children) and they all arrived in good health after a passage of twelve weeks from England.\n\nThis company first settled in Newtown, now Cambridge, near Boston. John Talcott was admitted a freeman by the General Court at Boston, November 6, 1632 and was one of the Representatives in the General Court for Newtown, May 14, 1634. At a general meeting of the whole town of Newtown, held February 4, 1634, he and five others, were chosen Selectmen of Newtown to do the whole business of the town.\n\nJohn was the fifth greatest proprietor of houses and lands in the town, out of eighty enumerated in 1634. He owned four houses in the west end,' and maintained, thirty-six rods of public fence.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Hooker joined his people in Newtown, and they, becoming dissatisfied with their location, after repeated efforts and much difficulty, obtained permission from the General Court to remove to the Connecticut River. John Talcott thereupon sold all his possessions in Newtown and with about one hundred others left Newtown in June 1636 Led by the Rev. Mr. Hooker they went on foot through the wilderness to the Connecticut River, where they founded the present city of Hartford.\n\nJason Newton has researched their journey on what is known as the Old Connecticut Path and believes that on the night before they arrived in Hartford they camped at Shenipsit Lake before passing down the Tankerhoosen River valley to the Hockanum River which they followed to Hartford. This path would have taken John Talcott through the future Talcottville.\n\nBefore leaving for Hartford John Talcott sent the carpenter Nicholas Clark, over the previous year to build him a house, which stood on the ground where the North Church stood, and was the first house built in Hartford. Here he took an active part in the affairs of the town, was a member of the General Court for many years, and was styled The Worshipful Mr. John Talcott.' He was one of the committee appointed in 1637, to take into consideration the propriety of a war with the Pequot Indians, and upon whose recommendation a war was accordingly declared. He was one of the Chief Magistrates of the Colony until his death, which occurred at his Mansion at the head of Main Street, in Hartford, in March 1660. He left by his will his property to his wife and two sons (his daughter having previously died), and grandchildren. He was buried in Hartford, and his name is inscribed upon the monument erected by the citizens of that place to perpetuate the memory of the founders of the Colony of Connecticut.\n\nOne of his descendants, Joseph Talcott, was chosen governor of Connecticut in 1725 and held that office for 17 years.\n\nCaptain Samuel Talcott #36 (1634-1727) , son of John 3 Talcott and Dorothy Mott, was probably born in Newtown, now Cambridge, MA coming to Hartford with his father and Hooker's congregation. He grew up in early Hartford, graduated from Harvard College in 1658 and was made a freeman in 1662. His father settled him upon land in Wethersfield before 1669.\n\nHe married Hannah Holyoke (1644-10), daughter of the Hon. Elizur Holyoke and Mary Pynchon on Nov. 7, 1661. Hannah was born June 9, 1644. His widow Mary died Jan. 5, 1710-11, 88. 73 years. ???????? His widow Mary died Jan. 5, 1710-11, at age 73 years. They had (435) Benjamin, b. March 1, 1674.\n\nAs was his father Samuel was very active in civic affairs in the new colony. From 1669 to 1684 he was Commissioner for Wethersfield; from 1670 to 1684 Deputy to the General Court. May 16, 1676, he was appointed one of a standing committee to order measures and dispose of such affairs as shall be necessary to attend to in the intervals of General Court. May 12, 1677, he was confirmed Lieutenant of the Wethersfield Trained band; Oct. 14, 1679, Lieutenant of the Troop ; Oct. 16, 1681, Captain of the Troop of Hartford Co. From 1683, except during Andros' administration, he was Assistant until his death.\n\nCapt. Samuel was one of the original proprietors of the town of Glastonbury, and owned the lot which was purchased by his Father in 1643, of Samuel Slierman and Richard Gildersleeve, 'being 44 rods wide, running back from the river three miles to the great wilderness.' He was the scholar of the family, and to him, his Father bequeathed all his books, except his \"Martyr Book,\" which he gave to his son John. From these two sons, John and Samuel, are descended all of the name of Talcott in America.\n\nSamuel Talcott died in Wethersfield, Nov. 10, 1691???. His will was made the preceding April and is in the Talcott genealogy:\n\n\"I give unto my son, Benjamin Talcott, and to his heirs forever, the one-half of my land on the east side of Connecticut river . . . he to have his part on the north side of it, and half a rod in breadth more than half. Also half my part of the undivided land lately purchased of the Indians, by the town of Wethersfield, on the east side of said River. Also of the two hundred acres given me by the General Court near Middletown bounds, . . . he to have the south side of it.\n\nDeacon Benjamin 1 Talcott #435 (1673-1727) , son of Captain Samuel Talcott and Hannah Holyoke, was born in Wethersfield on March 1, 1674. He was the first of the line to move east of the river where he built a house in 1699 on the Glastonbury farm given to him in his father's will.\n\nBenjamin married first Sarah Hollister (1699-1715), daughter of John Hollister and Sarah Goodrich on January 5, 1699. They had eight children from 1699 to 1715. She died in childbirth at their homestead on October 15, 1715 at 35 years of age. Their daughter Abigail, born October 10, lived only 18 days. Benjamin married again, but her name is unknown and they had no children.\n\nHis house was a large wooden building on the Main street, and was fortified and used as a place of refuge from the frequent attacks of the Indians. It bore the marks of the bullets, until it was taken down, soon after 1854. The farm and buildings thereon were owned and occupied (1856) by Jared G. Talcott, one of his descendants, having been in the family over 200 years. Deacon Benjamin Talcott held also the rank of Lieutenant in the Trained Band' of Connecticut.\n\nDeacon Benjamin died at his homestead on Nov. 12, 1727, aged 53 years. He left a large estate to his surviving children. According to his will \"I give and bequeath unto my son, Benjamin, all my right of lands in the towns of Bolton, and one hundred and twenty-four acres of land in the town of Hebron, which I bought of Joseph and John Phelps, of said Hebron, with what I have already given to my said son as may appear by my book of accounts.\"\n\nBenjamin left property worth 2563 pounds. He must have been very wealthy for the time as another 350 acres in Hebron was left to son John. He had additional tracts of land on the Blackledge river in Glastonbury and other lots in Glastonbury as detailed in his will. The will was witnessed by Samuel Smith, Jr.\n\nThe Bolton Founders\n\nBolton was recognized as a town in 1720 by the General Assembly, named and given privileges. In May 1731 a patent was granted listing the Grantees and Proprietors and the shares each received. This first division of 50 homelots was for about 100 acres each. John, Benjamin and Nathaniel Talcott each were listed as Bolton Proprietors. Benjamin received one and a half parts, but its not clear which Benjamin. The patent was signed by Governor John Talcott. Benjamin had a brother Nathaniel who remained in Glastonbury, but may have owned land in Bolton as a number of Grantees were absentee owners. Alford's 1920 recreated map also shows property owned by a Joseph Talcott, a possible brother of Benjamin, and also a Joshua Talcott.\n\nBenjamin's properties appear from the map to be in North Bolton, one of the few who chose their Homelots here. He seems to have acquired parcels east and west of Bolton Road near the quarry. One piece extends from Bolton Road to Railroad Brook. He gave land to his son sometimes called Benjamin Talcott, Jr near the quarry. This location would explain why he was buried in Bamforth Road Cemetery.\n\nAfter the initial division there were 14 more over the next 75 years, each smaller than its predecessor. As a result each of the Proprietors or their oldest male heir received additional parcels spread all over Bolton. These additional divisions were often given to sons to establish their own farms.\n\nBenjamin 2 Talcott #455 (1702-1785) was the oldest son of Deacon Benjamin Talcott and Sarah Hollister. He was born in Glastonbury on June 27, 1702 and was the first Talcott to move to Bolton and began farming on his father's land. As noted in his father's will he also inherited 124 acres of land in Hebron.\n\nHe married first Esther Lyman (1724-??), daughter of John Lyman and Mindwell Pomeroy of Northampton, MA on August 26, 1724. They had five children from 1725 to 1736. The oldest was the Benjamin who we are following. He married second Deborah Gillett and had another seven children with her, but dates are unknown.\n\nBenjamin died March 9, 1785 at age 83. It is from his 12 children that most of the Bolton/Vernon line of Talcott's descends.\n\nDeacon Benjamin 3 Talcott #909 (1725-1811) was the son of Benjamin Talcott and Esther Lyman and was born in Bolton on June 10, 1725. He was a farmer like his father and settled in Bolton near the quarry on land given him by his father. He died in Bolton on April 18, 1811 at age 85 and is buried in the North Bolton Cemetery on Bamforth Road.\n\nDeacon Benjamin married Elizabeth Lyman, the daughter of Samuel Lyman and Elizabeth Smith (1730-1810) of Coventry on March 15, 1753. Elizabeth was born in 1730 lived until the age of 80. They had 11 children from 1754 to 1773, including a set of twins. All lived to adulthood and married. The first four children were sons born in quick succession. Those we are following are:\n\n1029 - Elijah, the second son, born June 22, 1755 from whose line would come the owners of Talcottville as well as Royal Talcott, the journal writer. 1030 - Deacon Samuel Talcott (1757-1813) (Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin, Samuel, John, John, John), son of Deacon Benjamin Talcott and Elizabeth Lyman, was born in Bolton on April 7, 1757. He was a farmer in moderate, but comfortable circumstances and lived in Vernon. He moved to North Bolton before 1793 may have attended the Old Meetinghouse at Vernon Center or remained with the South Bolton congregation. He died on May 26, 1813 at age 56 outliving his father by only two years and his youngest daughter by only one month. He is buried in the Southwest Cemetery. He married at age 34 Sarah Smith, daughter of James and Mary (Tudor) Smith of Cromwell on Sept. 8, 1791. She died on Feb. 16, 1823 at age 58 and is buried in the Southwest Cemetery.\n\nThey had 9 children from 1793 to 1813. Two died very young. When Samuel died many of his children were still toddlers. Sarah died just ten years later when her youngest was not yet 10.\n\nThe Tankerhoosen Valley Talcott's\n\nThe Talcott family in Bolton and Vernon were in general industrious, civic minded, religious, prolific and willing to take risks. As a result many were successful and intermarried with other long time local families. The cemeteries of Vernon, Rockville and Talcottville are filled with Talcott's.\n\nIn my research I have explored the lives of many of only a few of the Talcott's who lived and worked in the Tankerhoosen Valley. Most are descendants of Benjamin 3 Talcott. Following are sketches of their lives and where they fit in the family tree. Links will take you to pages where you can learn more about their contributions to Vernon.\n\nDeacon Samuel Talcott #1052 (1757-1813) (Benjamin 3) is the son of Benjamin 3 Talcott and Elisabeth Lyman (1730-1810). He was born in North Bolton on Apr. 7, 1757.\n\nHe married Sarah Smith (???-1823), daughter of Koswell Smith on Jan. 6, 1818, who died in 1860 at age 63. They had five children from 1793 to 1813.\n\nSamuel died May 26, 1813 at age 56. Samuel and Sarah are buried in the Southwest Cemetery.\n\nAt the time Samuel died in 1813 his oldest son Samuel was just 20, while his youngest son James had just been born. He died a wealthy man for the time with an inventory valued at $5,215. His wife and oldest son Samuel were the executors. There were two pieces of land - his Home Lot and buildings worth $1,650. and a lot he bought from Olcott with buildings worth $2,610. In 1815 the estate sold 18.5 acres to Alexander McLean at auction for $554 sold to pay debts.\n\nSamuel Smith Talcott #1052 (1793-1882) (Samuel, Benjamin 3) is the son of Deacon Samuel Talcott and Sarah Smith, and grandson of Benjamin 3 Talcott. He was born in North Bolton on Dec. 13, 1793, and just 20 when his father died in 1813. As was often the case at the time his middle name is his mother's maiden name.\n\nSamuel first built an oil mill on the lower Hockanum River about 1835 and then, with partners, a successful paper mill, known as the Granite Mills, about 1850 at the same location. He was ambitious and hard working accumulating land and building his mills one step at a time.\n\nHe married first Harriet Smith (1797-1860), daughter of Koswell Smith on Jan. 6, 1818, who died in 1860 at age 63. They had six children from 1819 to 1830, including a set of twins. Only two of their children lived to be adults. His daughter Caroline married Orin C. Brown, who died in the Union Army on April 12, 1863. His son Samuel Tudor Talcott (1829-1908) married twice, but his only child died at age 9.\n\nSamuel married second Sophia C. Keeney in 1860 when he was 67. He died May 26, 1882 at age 88. Samuel and Harriet are buried in the Southwest Cemetery. Samuel's house on Talcottville Road appears to have been the Victorian that later became the Vernon Inn surviving until the 1950's.\n\n» Go to Samuel Smith Talcott biography\n\n» Go to The Granite Mills\n\n10?? - Smith Stephen Talcott (1834-1888) , son of Gurden Talcott and Asenath Fitch (???-1877), was born in North Bolton on Dec. 13, 1793. Samuel was 20 when his father died in 1813. Perhaps he took over his father's farm where he would later build the mill. Samuel owned and likely built the Granite Mills or its predecessor on the Hockanum River in the 1850's. See Granite Mills. Samuel's house was on Talcottville Road and appears to have been the Victorian that later became the Vernon Inn surviving until the 1950's. He died May 26, 1882 at age 88 and is buried in the Southwest Cemetery. He married first on Jan. 6, 1818 Harriet, daughter of Koswell Smith who was born on May 25, 1797. She died on April 28, 1860 aged 63 and is buried in the Southwest Cemetery. They had six children from 1819 to 1830, including a set of twins. Only two of their children lived to be adults. His daughter Caroline married Orin C. Brown, who died in the Union Army on April 12, 1863. His son Samuel Tudor married twice but his only child died at age 9. Samuel married second Sophia C. Keeney on Dec. 5, 1860 when he was 67.\n\nThe Talcott Family's Journey To Vernon\n\n1877 ad for Henry Cassin's business.\n\nClick on images to enlarge.\n\nMembers of the family contributed to the early history of Connecticut in many areas. Prominent Vernon family members included the SAMUEL, BENJAMIN, BENJAMIN, JR. line who owned and farmed a large parcel of land near today's Vernon Circle and into South Windsor. RALPH TALCOTT (1795-1847) in 1821 was one of the builders of the first textile mill in what is now Rockville. His brother PHINEAS TALCOTT (1793-1863) became president of Rockville's American Mill, served as our state representative and state senator, was president of the Rockville Railroad Company and the Savings Bank of Rockville. He was also a Probate Judge and donated Talcott Park to the city. GEORGE TALCOTT (1827-1917?) was a Justice of the Peace trying police cases, as well as director and president of the First National Bank. The Talcott's were already involved in every aspect of the growing community - mills, railroad, banking, law, church and schools - at the time the family became involved in what would become Talcottville.\n\nSources\n\nTalcott, S.
