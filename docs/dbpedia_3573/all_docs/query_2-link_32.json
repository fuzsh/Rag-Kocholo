        "text": "Sam considers himself an enthusiast regarding almost any topic, including travel. Born in California in the United States of America, he has lived in four different countries, including Australia and England, and now Hungary. During his travels, he has completed a Bachelors of Science in Psychology and is now completing a Masters of Education with TESOL. In addition to jobs as a construction worker, a bartender, and a dock worker, he has worked as a teacher in many subjects with various age groups, ranging from primary school children to adults. He has also volunteered with different organizations in his life, in programs such as bike repairs for people in need, and private tutoring in specific subjects.\n\nWhen he is not teaching, Sam can be found committed to one of any number of activities. To name a few, he loves photography, playing and watching sports, board games, movies, trying new foods, interacting with animals, listening to music, especially live performances, learning new languages, learning about history, learning different sciences, learning about philosophy and theories, learning art techniques, basically just learning. He feels that the best educators are the ones who are as open to learning as they are to teaching, which is why he is so happy to be working with The Bilingual Program."
