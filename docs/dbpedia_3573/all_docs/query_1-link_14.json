        "text": "Introduction\n\nAmerican history is deeply rooted in Connecticut, one of the 13 original U.S. states. It is known as the Constitution State because the set of laws by which the first settlers agreed to govern themselves—the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639)—embodied the first laws that recognized the people as the real basis of civil authority. This principle was later incorporated in the United States Constitution.\n\nAlthough Connecticut is one of the smallest states, it has made large contributions to the U.S. economy. In the first 150 years of the U.S. Patent Office, Connecticut received more patents in proportion to its population than any other state. The creativity and ingenuity of the state’s citizens produced a wide range of manufactures—from interchangeable parts for firearms to the first derby hat. Their mechanical skills spawned industries in cities such as New Haven, Hartford, Waterbury, Bridgeport, Danbury, and Meriden. Raw materials and markets for the finished goods have been within easy reach of Connecticut traders since colonial times.\n\nThe sea and the farm, as well as the factory, have contributed to Connecticut’s economy. Whalers and clipper ships built in Mystic and Stonington left impressive marks in the annals of U.S. shipping. Farms in the Connecticut River valley provided food for the region from before the days of the American Revolution. Though farming and fishing now play only small roles in the state, the growth of services—especially the prominent insurance industry—has helped Connecticut maintain its prosperity.\n\nConnecticut was named for the Connecticut River. Pequot Indians called the river Quonehtacut, meaning “long tidal river.” The Connecticut, with its source near the Canadian border, is the longest river in the country without a major port at its mouth.\n\nConnecticut’s unofficial nickname, the Nutmeg State, originated in New England folklore about the early Connecticut traders, who supposedly made wooden nutmeg seeds for sale as real ones. Other nicknames were the Blue Law State, the Land of Steady Habits, and the Brownstone State and Freestone State, for quarries no longer of any economic importance. Area 5,543 square miles (14,357 square kilometers). Population (2020) 3,605,944.\n\nSurvey of the Constitution State\n\nConnecticut is the southernmost of the New England states. It is almost rectangular in shape. The state is bounded by Massachusetts on the north, Rhode Island on the east, New York on the west, and Long Island Sound on the south.\n\nConnecticut ranks among the smallest states; only Delaware and Rhode Island are smaller. Its greatest length from east to west is 100 miles (160 kilometers), and its greatest length from north to south is 50 miles (80 kilometers). Its 618-mile (995-kilometer) coastline is all on Long Island Sound.\n\nNatural Regions\n\nConnecticut belongs to the New England Province of the Appalachian Highland region of the United States. Almost all of the state falls within the New England Upland Section of the province. It features low, wooded hills in the east and west separated by a central lowland. The western highlands are drained by the Housatonic and Naugatuck rivers. The Thames River and its tributaries run through the eastern highlands. The central lowland comprises the beautiful and fertile valley of the Connecticut River.\n\nThe northwestern corner of Connecticut is part of the Taconic region, which also covers western Massachusetts and a narrow stretch of eastern New York. The beautiful hills in this region are a southern extension of the Berkshires of Massachusetts. In this area is Mount Frissell—at 2,380 feet (725 meters) the highest point in Connecticut.\n\nA coastal plain stretches along Long Island Sound. It has sand beaches and good natural harbors, the busiest of which is at New Haven. The best water route to the interior is up the Connecticut River. From its mouth on the sound it is navigable to Hartford, 50 miles (80 kilometers) away by water.\n\nClimate\n\nConnecticut has a generally mild climate. The coast has somewhat warmer winters and cooler summers than does the interior, and the northwestern uplands have cooler and longer winters with heavier snowfall.\n\nConnecticut’s average annual precipitation (rain and melted snow) varies from about 49 inches (125 centimeters) in the northwest to 42 inches (107 centimeters) in the east-central part of the state. The temperature and precipitation are fine for good pastures, field crops, orchards, and vineyards. Around Hartford, near the center of the state, the frost-free season averages about 180 days a year.\n\nSudden change is a well-known characteristic of the Connecticut climate. Swift temperature swings are common, and storms and clear skies can alternate with each other daily. Hurricanes and other strong storms sometimes affect the state. Floods did much property damage in the 1930s and 1950s. After the disastrous floods of 1936, Connecticut and the other New England states built flood-control dams on the northern streams leading into the Connecticut River and dikes along many city banks.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nBefore its settlement by Europeans, Connecticut was a forested region. Clearings made by Native Americans, swampy floodplains, and tidal marshes accounted for only about 5 percent of the total area. The southern two-thirds was largely oak forest, and the northern border belonged to the northern hardwood region of birch, beech, maple, and hemlock. Some higher elevations and sandy sections supported coniferous forest cover. Virtually all of the original forest has been cut, however. Although some of the original species still exist, the woodland that now covers nearly two-thirds of the state more closely resembles a mixed forest.\n\nThe animal life of Connecticut when the first European settlers arrived included deer, bears, wolves, foxes, and numerous smaller mammals, such as raccoons, muskrats, porcupines, weasels, and beavers. Deer are still abundant in the less densely settled regions, but in general the populations of larger animals have been severely reduced. More than 300 species of birds are common in the state, but sightings of the Connecticut warbler are rare. The wild turkey, missing from the state since the early 19th century, is abundant again after having been reintroduced in the 1970s. Shorebirds, waterfowl, and seabirds abound along the coast.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nAt the time of the first U.S. census, in 1790, almost all of Connecticut’s people were English. The next century saw the arrival of new immigrants from other parts of Europe. Many Irish came to Connecticut after Ireland’s potato famine of the 1840s. They were followed by French Canadians and, later in the 19th century, by Italians, Poles, Russians, and other groups from southern and eastern Europe.\n\nAt the time of the 2020 census non-Hispanic whites made up 63 percent of Connecticut’s population. African Americans made up about 10 percent of the total, and Asian Americans 5 percent. About 17 percent of the people identified themselves as Hispanic, with Puerto Ricans being the largest subgroup. This figure increased from 13 percent in 2010, making Hispanics the fastest-growing segment of the population. Connecticut has a small Native American population and two federally recognized tribes—the Mashantucket Pequot and the Mohegan. (Federally recognized tribes are eligible to receive services provided by the U.S. government.)\n\nCities\n\nThe population of Connecticut is heavily urban. The state has no single large city, however, and the intense crowding characteristic of many urban areas is not found in Connecticut. Fairfield county in the southwest is uniquely oriented toward New York City and serves as a suburb for many commuters. In this area are two of the state’s largest cities, Stamford and Bridgeport. Stamford has one of the largest concentrations of corporate headquarters in the United States.\n\nA corridor of high population continues northeastward from Bridgeport along the coast of Long Island Sound to New Haven and then to Hartford, the state capital, and northward along the Connecticut River valley into Massachusetts. New Haven is the site of Yale University, and Hartford is home to many national insurance companies.\n\nEducation\n\nThe first schools in Connecticut were started soon after the colonists arrived. The early standards were set by the Connecticut code of 1650, which required that all parents educate their children and that every township of 50 families have an elementary school, paid for by the town. In 1672 the General Court, the chief governing unit, gave each county 600 acres (240 hectares) of land for school use. In 1795 the state gave money from the sale of the Western Reserve—land in northeastern Ohio that was then owned by Connecticut—to establish a state school fund. Development of the present school system was due to the efforts of Henry Barnard of Hartford, who became the first U.S. commissioner of education in 1867.\n\nConnecticut is renowned for its many private schools and colleges. Yale University, an Ivy League school located in New Haven, is regarded as one of the world’s great universities. Founded in 1701, Yale is the third oldest institution of higher learning in the United States (after Harvard, founded in 1636, and the College of William and Mary, founded in 1693). Other private institutions, such as Wesleyan University in Middletown, also have national recognition. The University of Connecticut has its main campus in Storrs, a law school in Hartford, and a medical school in Farmington. The first law school in America was founded by an attorney named Tapping Reeve in Litchfield about 1784. It was open until 1833.. The United States Coast Guard Academy is located in New London.\n\nSports and Recreation\n\nConnecticut’s hills and valleys invite hikers and horseback riders. The Appalachian Trail cuts through northwest Connecticut. On the streams, lakes, and Long Island Sound are facilities for swimming, fishing, and boating. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection keeps the waters stocked with fish. In winter ice boating and fishing are popular, and the hills and lakes attract skiers and skaters.\n\nThe University of Connecticut men’s and women’s basketball teams are among the state’s top athletic attractions. Minor league baseball and ice hockey are also popular, as is the Connecticut Sun, a professional women’s basketball team based in Uncasville. The Hartford Athletic plays in the USL Championship league.\n\nArts and Cultural Sites\n\nConnecticut’s historic houses and battle sites make up a major part of its heritage. In Hartford visitors may see the Old State House, designed by the noted colonial architect Charles Bulfinch. In East Haddam is the schoolhouse where the patriot Nathan Hale taught, and near the town is Gillette Castle—the unique home of the actor William Gillette, whose most famous role was Sherlock Holmes. Putnam Memorial State Park, near Danbury, is dedicated to the American Revolution soldiers who were encamped there during the fierce winter of 1778–79. Among the colonial homes on view are the Whitfield House, in Guilford; the Webb House, in Wethersfield; and the Glebe House, in Woodbury.\n\nArt exhibitions are held annually in many Connecticut cities. Some of the most prestigious cultural institutions in the state can be found at Yale University, in New Haven. The Yale University Art Gallery is the oldest university art museum in the Western Hemisphere, and the Center for British Art has the largest collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. Yale’s Peabody Museum of Natural History is among the oldest and largest university natural science museums in the world. The Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford is the oldest continuously operating public art museum in the United States. The New Britain Museum of American Art was the country’s first museum dedicated solely to American art. In Greenwich the Bruce Museum presents exhibits on the arts and sciences.\n\nPerforming arts programs are offered throughout Connecticut. Classical music concerts are offered by the Hartford, New Haven, Eastern Connecticut, Farmington Valley, New Britain, Norwalk, and Nutmeg symphony orchestras. The state’s professional ballet companies are Connecticut Ballet and Hartford Ballet, both in Hartford. Opera is performed by the Connecticut Lyric Opera in New London, the Hartford Opera Theater, and the Salt Marsh Opera in Stonington.\n\nProminent American authors have called Connecticut home. The Harriet Beecher Stowe Center and the Mark Twain House and Museum, both in Hartford, offer tours and an opportunity to learn more about the authors’ homes and work. Both are national historic landmarks.\n\nThe seaside town of Mystic is home to the Mystic Seaport Museum and the Mystic Aquarium. The seaport museum focuses on the town’s maritime heritage, and the aquarium offers close encounters with marine animals. The Connecticut Science Center, located in Hartford, offers more than 160 hands-on exhibits to educate visitors in all the STEM fields.\n\nFor brief biographies of some notable people of Connecticut, click here.\n\nEconomy\n\nConnecticut has a history of industry and innovation that dates back to the colonial era. Today, with an economy based on industry and services, the state remains generally prosperous. Connecticut ranks among the top states in the country in terms of personal income per capita. However, Connecticut also displays sharp contrasts between areas of great wealth and great poverty.\n\nAgriculture and Fishing\n\nAgriculture declined steadily in Connecticut during the 20th century and is now a relatively minor part of the economy. However, the average value per acre of the state’s farmlands is among the highest in the country. The most valuable agricultural product is greenhouse and nursery products, including flowers, ornamental shrubs, seedlings (young plants), Christmas trees, and specialty vegetables. Livestock and animal products—especially milk and other dairy products, eggs, and poultry—are another major source of farm income. Lowland farms grow garden vegetables, while the uplands are best for dairy cattle, orchards, and vineyards. Apples, peaches, and pears are grown. The one important export crop is shade-grown tobacco, which is used mainly for cigar wrappers. Commercial fishing is not of much importance to Connecticut, but oysters and clams are produced on fish farms along the coast.\n\nIndustry\n\nManufacturing has long been a key component of Connecticut’s economy, though its relative importance has lessened. Traditionally, the state was known for its pins, clocks, silverware, sewing machines, firearms (notably Winchester rifles and Colt pistols), and many brass products. Today, Connecticut’s factories turn out aircraft engines, helicopters, and other transportation equipment, chemicals, metal products, and electronics.\n\nConnecticut has limited natural resources, and its mineral deposits have been largely worked out. Near Salisbury, in the northwest, there were once deposits of high-grade iron ore. During the American Revolution the ore was made into cables, anchors, and cannons. The deposits were exhausted by the mid-1800s. The most valuable minerals today are clay, stone, and sand and gravel.\n\nServices\n\nThe service sector now dominates Connecticut’s economy. The state’s leading industry is finance and insurance, with Hartford long ago earning the nickname “Insurance City.” After first offering marine insurance for ships and their cargo, Connecticut companies expanded into fire, life, health, and other types of insurance. Real estate, health care, and tourism have also grown considerably.\n\nTransportation\n\nInterstate highways crisscross the state, but they are concentrated in the densely settled coastal and Connecticut River valley regions. The Merritt and Wilbur Cross parkways go through or within a few miles of the largest cities. These express roads run from the New York state line in the southwest to Milford and from Milford to Meriden. The Connecticut Turnpike, a 129-mile (208-kilometer) highway, crosses the state from Greenwich to South Killingly, near the Rhode Island state line. Interstate 91 links New Haven with Meriden and Hartford and with Springfield, Massachusetts. Interstate 84 angles northeastward across Connecticut to link New York with Massachusetts.\n\nConnecticut’s railroad network is a link in the rail corridor between Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C. Passenger trains running through Connecticut connect New York City and Boston. The (New York) Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Metro-North line carries many commuters between southern Connecticut and New York City.\n\nBradley International Airport, north of Hartford, is the major air terminal, but there are a number of smaller airports throughout the state that offer regional services. The port of New Haven is one of the largest in New England. Other major ports are at Bridgeport and New London.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first people of the Connecticut region were Paleo-Indians, who arrived about 10,000 years ago. They used stone tools and engaged in hunting, gathering, fishing, and woodworking. They are thought to have been seminomadic, moving their homes during the year to use resources that changed with the seasons.\n\nBy the time of European contact, a number of Northeast Indian peoples of the Algonquian language family were living in settled villages. Among them were the Pequot, the Mohegan, and the Nipmuc. They grew crops such as corn (maize), beans, squash, and tobacco in addition to hunting and gathering.\n\nColonial Era\n\nDutch traders first explored the Connecticut River in 1614. In 1633 a Dutch group from the colony of New Netherland founded the first settlement, a trading post, along the Connecticut River at a site that later became Hartford. In the next few years settlers of English descent from Massachusetts established posts at what are now Wethersfield and Windsor. In 1636 Thomas Hooker led about 100 people from Massachusetts south along the Connecticut River to the Hartford site and established a colony near that of the Dutch, who eventually left the area in 1654.\n\nIn contrast to many of the other New England areas, relations between Native Americans and the early settlers in Connecticut were good. Within a few years, however, conflict arose as English colonists expanded onto Pequot land. In 1637 the English and their Native American allies attacked and destroyed the main Pequot village, near the site of present-day Stonington. As many as 600 Pequot were killed.\n\nThe colonists of Wethersfield, Windsor, and Hartford formed their own set of laws, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, in 1639. Thought to be the first written constitution, it set up a government that was in effect independent of any authority but their own. The 11 orders provided for a general assembly and for the election of a governor and magistrates. They set up laws for elections, courts, powers of officials, and taxes.\n\nIn 1662 Governor John Winthrop, Jr., obtained a royal charter establishing Connecticut as an independent colony. It set up the boundaries of the colony as Narragansett Bay on the east, Massachusetts on the north, Long Island Sound on the south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west.\n\nBefore the American Revolution Connecticut had already established a manufacturing industry. During the war its mines and foundries produced arms that contributed greatly to the war effort. Connecticut also furnished many soldiers. Jonathan Trumbull, its governor at the start of the war, was the only royal governor to join the cause of independence. Ethan Allen, Israel Putnam, and many others also played key roles in the war.\n\nStatehood\n\nWhen the colony of Connecticut became a state in 1788, the 1662 charter continued to serve as the constitution. It was replaced in 1818 and amended in 1953. The present state constitution was adopted in 1965.\n\nAfter the American Revolution most of the former colonies had claims to unsettled lands in the West based on royal charters and grants. In 1786 Connecticut agreed to give up all of its land west of its present boundary except for a tract in what is now northeastern Ohio. This 3.5-million-acre (1.4-million-hectare) tract became known as the Western Reserve. About half a million acres were set aside for people whose homes had been destroyed during the Revolution. In 1795 the remainder was sold to investors, with proceeds going to the school fund. In 1800 Connecticut ceded the Western Reserve to the United States.\n\nConnecticut remained an agricultural region with a few small urban areas—Hartford, New Haven, New London, and Middletown—until the early 19th century. The state economy then began to change, however, with the establishment of textile factories. By 1850 manufacturing employed more state residents than agriculture.\n\nThe shift to manufacturing had been aided by the inventive genius of a number of Connecticut residents. Eli Whitney, well known for his invention of the cotton gin in 1794, introduced machine-made parts in his firearms factory in Hamden. The principle of interchangeable parts, adapted to clock manufacturing by Eli Terry of Plymouth in 1802, rapidly became basic to all manufacturing. Other famous Connecticut innovators included John Fitch, who built the first steamboat; Linus Yale, who invented the pin tumbler lock; Samuel Colt, who manufactured revolvers; and David Bushnell and Simon Lake, who were pioneers in the development of submarines.\n\nConnecticut’s vast industrial capacity made it a major supplier of arms for more than a century. During the American Civil War the state provided weapons for Union troops, and in World Wars I and II it was called an “arsenal of democracy.” The state’s defense contractors and small-arms makers also contributed significantly to the country’s efforts in the Korean and Vietnam wars. The U.S. Navy built a submarine base at Groton in 1917. In 1954 the world’s first atomic-powered submarine, the Nautilus, was launched at Groton.\n\nModern Connecticut\n\nThe end of the Cold War in the early 1990s led to a significant decline in government defense spending, which posed a challenge to Connecticut’s economy. The state responded by boosting exports and passing legislation to help diversify the economy. Finance became an increasingly important sector as the service economy expanded. The national economic downturn of the early 21st century was another blow, however, and Connecticut’s unemployment rate climbed from 2.3 percent in 2000 (tied for the lowest in the country) to 9.1 percent in 2010.\n\nLike other New England states, Connecticut saw its population increase relatively slowly in the first decade of the 21st century. Its population grew at a rate of 4.9 percent between 2000 and 2010, only about half the national rate of 9.7 percent. In the mid-2010s, as growing numbers of people left Connecticut for the South and the West, the population began to shrink. During the same period a number of corporations moved out of Connecticut. General Electric, for example, relocated its headquarters from Fairfield to Boston, Massachusetts, in 2016. (See also United States, “New England”.)\n\nSome Notable People of Connecticut\n\nP.T. Barnum (1810–91)\n\nShowman P.T. Barnum revolutionized the American circus to make it into the Greatest Show on Earth. He was born and raised in Connecticut. He began his career as a showman in New York City, where he attracted people to exhibits by using exaggerated claims and outrageous stunts. Barnum used these tactics to draw millions of people to his museum and, later, his circus. He was also elected mayor of Bridgeport and served two terms in the Connecticut state legislature. (See also P.T. Barnum.)\n\nKatharine Hepburn (1907–2003)\n\nActress Katharine Hepburn was a memorable performer, noted for her New England accent and distinctive beauty. Hepburn was born and raised in a wealthy Connecticut family. After her graduation from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, Hepburn appeared on Broadway but was soon invited to Hollywood, where she began her film career. She earned an Academy Award for her third movie, Morning Glory (1933). She went on to win three more Academy Awards, setting the record for most trophies won. (See also Katharine Hepburn.)\n\nAnnie Leibovitz (born 1949)\n\nPhotographer Annie Leibovitz is known for her portraits of celebrities. She was born in Connecticut and attended the San Francisco Art Institute. While still a student, Leibovitz received her first assignment—to photograph John Lennon—for Rolling Stone magazine. She went on to photograph musicians, athletes, film stars, and politicians while working for Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair. In 1991 she became the first woman to have a show in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. Leibovitz was named a Library of Congress Living Legend in 2000.\n\nConstance Baker Motley (1921–2005)\n\nConstance Baker Motley was the first African American woman to become a federal judge. She grew up in Connecticut and earned a law degree from Columbia University in New York City. Motley spent the next 20 years working on the Legal Defense and Educational Fund for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She won nine civil rights victories in cases she argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Motley for a federal judgeship in the Southern District of New York. She became a senior judge in 1986 and served in that position until her death in 2005.\n\nRalph Nader (born 1934)\n\nConsumer advocate Ralph Nader was a four-time candidate for U.S. president. After earning a law degree from Harvard University, Nader became interested in unsafe vehicle design. His work led to the passage of the 1966 National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. He became a consumer activist involved in such issues as nuclear safety, land use, and meat processing. Nader ran for president in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008. In 2015 he opened the American Museum of Tort Law in Winsted, Connecticut. (See also Ralph Nader.)\n\nSengbe Pieh (Joseph Cinque) (1814?–79?)\n\nSengbe Pieh was the leader of the captured Africans on the slave ship Amistad. Pieh and others were abducted from Sierra Leone to be sold as slaves in the West Indies. Once they arrived in Cuba, Pieh freed himself and others from their shackles. They killed some of their captors and told a navigator to sail back to Sierra Leone. Instead, the navigator sailed the Amistad northward, and Pieh and the others were jailed and tried in Connecticut. The Africans won the trial and were sent back to Sierra Leone. (See also Joseph Cinque.)\n\nNoah Webster (1758–1843)\n\nNoah Webster had a great influence on how American English is pronounced and spelled. He was born in Hartford. Webster practiced law, edited a newspaper, and served as a judge and a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives. In 1807 Webster began the American Dictionary of the English Language. He spent 10 years studying the English language and its connections with other languages. Webster published the first edition, in two volumes, in 1828. (See also Noah Webster.)"
