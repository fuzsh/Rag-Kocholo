        "text": "i Fitch Lamphere (Lamphier) b. 30 Mar 1761 Lebanon New London, CT; d. 10 Jan 1826 Durham, Greene, New York; m. 12 Jan 1792 Durham, Middlesex, CT to Jerusha Merwin (b. 27 Aug 1768 Durham). Jerusha’s parents were Miles Merwin Jr. (1744 – 1793) and Mary Parmalee (1747 – 1795) of Durham, CT. Fitch and Jerusha had nine children born between 1793 and 1811.\n\nFitch was a Revolutionary War soldier. Fitch enlisted April 22, 1777, at Lebanon, Connecticut, in Capt. Paul Willis’ company of Col. Samuel Blatchley Webb’s regiment. He served until April 28, 1780, when he was discharged at the expiration of his term of service, at Morristown, N.J. Ref. Pension Claim W27145 (38 pages).\n\nS.B. Webb’s Additional Continental Regiment, later became the 9th Connecticut Regiment. Early in 1777, Washington offered command of one of these additional regiments to Samuel Blatchley Webb, who accepted. Webb had formerly served as one of Washington’s personal aides. Webb’s Regiment was allotted to the Connecticut Line on July 24, 1780, and officially designated the 9th Connecticut Regiment.\n\nThe regiment was raised on January 11, 1777 at Danbury, Connecticut by Colonel Samuel Blachley Webb, a stepson of Connecticut politician Silas Deane. It was one of several so-called “additional regiments” authorized by the Second Continental Congress that were not associated with any particular state quotas.\n\nThe regiment first saw action at the Battle of Setauket in August 1777 under Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons. It was then sent to the Hudson River Valley, where it served under General George Clinton in the aftermath of the October Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery. In December 1777 the regiment was involved in a failed expedition to Long Island (a more elaborate attempt on Setauket than that of the previous August) in which Colonel Webb was captured. The regiment spent the winter of 1777-78 at West Point, where it assisted in the construction of fortifications (including the Webb redoubt, probably named for the colonel).\n\nIn 1778 the regiment was attached to the brigade of General James Varnum. As part of a combined Franco-American attempt to retake British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island, the brigade marched to Rhode Island, where it was involved in the August 29 Battle of Rhode Island. The battle was tactically indecisive, but the regiment was noted for its performance. The regiment wintered in Rhode Island.\n\nThe regiment spent most of 1779 in Rhode Island, but was sent to winter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey. In the spring of 1780, the remnants of Sherburne’s Additional Continental Regiment were merged into the unit, and it was formally added to the Connecticut Line as the 9th Connecticut Regiment.\n\nFitch is found in the 1800 and 1810 Oneida, Madison, NYCensus records of Albany Co., NY, pp. 182 [as Lamphier] and 91 [as Lanpher] respectively.\n\n1820 census Elijah Lamphier Hamilton, Madison, New York\n\nHis signed affidavit places him in Catskill, Greene, NY, by June of 1820; the federal census confirms this on p. 141 of the corresponding census where his name appears as Fitch “Lamphier”.\n\nFitch died in 1826 in Durham New York. Durham was first settled around 1782 within Albany County. The town was established from part of the Town of Coxsackie in 1790 as the “Town of Freehold.” In the spring of 1800 Freehold became part of the newly formed Greene County. The town’s name was changed to “Durham” in 1805, the town having been called informally “New Durham” by the many settlers from Connecticut. Part of the town was lost to form, in 1803, the new Towns of Cairo, Greenville, and Windham. In 1836, the western part of Durham became the Town of Conesville in Schoharie County.\n\nI have not found his widow or his children in the 1830 census.\n\nJerusha (Merwin) Lanphere signed an affidavit in May of 1839 placing her in Durham, Green Co., NY, and mentions her sister, Olive Smith, living in the same town. Along with the affidavit, Jerusha sent the New Testament title page of the family bible, printed in New York by M. L. & W. A. Davis in 1801. Abstract and copy of bible record printed in The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, Volume LXXI, 1940, p. 272.\n\nThe reverse of the title page contained the following:\n\nFitch Lanphere was Born March the 30 AD 1761\n\nJerusha Merwin was Born Aurgust the 27 AD 1768\n\nMiles Lanphere was Borne May 12 AD 1793 and died December 19th 18[26]\n\nElisabeth Lanphere was Borne Decmbar 13 AD 1794\n\nNancy Lanphere was Borne Novembar 16 AD 17[erased; 1796 written in later]\n\nRhoda Lanphere was Borne the Novembar 9 AD 1798\n\nSamuel Lanphere was Born octobar 10 AD 1801 and Decst in 3 moths\n\nJesse Lanphere was Borne December 2 AD 1803\n\nMary Lanphere was Born 7 June AD 1807\n\nNoah Lanphere was Boarn May 10 AD 1809\n\nDanel Lanphere was Borne Aurgust 9 AD 1811 Desest 6 days oald\n\nFitch Lanphere died January 10th 1826\n\nMiles Lanphere died December 19th 1826\n\nMary Servoss Departet this Life Febuary 26th 1832\n\nLemuel fich Servoss Son of Henry and Mary Servoss who departed this life\n\nFebuary 25th 1832\n\nIn Fitch Lanphere’s 1820 affidavit he states that his daughter “Roda” has been deranged for about 10 years; and that his nine-year-old son, Noah, “has St. Vitises Dance and Cannot Speak.” His son, Jesse, was described as an able bodied boy; and his daughter, Mary, in good health.\n\nSydenham’s chorea or chorea minor (historically referred to as Saint Vitus Dance) is a disease characterized by rapid, uncoordinated jerking movements affecting primarily the face, feet and hands. Sydenham’s chorea results from childhood infection with Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and is reported to occur in 20-30% of patients with acute rheumatic fever. No vaccines are currently available to protect against Streptococcus pyogenes infection, although there has been research into the development of one.\n\nii. Samuel Lamphere b. 1767;p d.

Bethia Winslow b. 31 Dec 1759 in Salisbury, Litchfield, CT; d. 2 Jun 1820; m. Samuel Chamberlain (b. 17 Apr 1757 in Westborough, Worcester, Mass – d. 11 Nov 1823 – Massena, St Lawrence, New York) Samuel’s parents were John Chamberlain (1721 – 1805) and Mercy Brown (1724 – ) Bethiah and Samuel had five children between 1784 and 1794 at Richmond, Chittenden, Vermont.\n\nEuropean settlement of Vermont did not begin until the Treaty of Paris ended the French and Indian War in 1763. While surrounding townships were being granted by Governor Wentworth of New Hampshire and being settled and organized, there was not one dwelling in the area destined to become Richmond. In 1775, Amos Brownson and John Chamberlain established homesteads in the area known as “the flats” which was at that time a part of the Williston Township. This early settlement coincided with the advent of the American Revolution when Vermont settlements on the borders of civilization were vulnerable to Indian attack. A man and a child were killed at the Chamberlain homestead before Richmond’s settlers, along with nearly all the other families in Chittenden County, abandoned their new homes and fled to the south for safety.\n\nAfter the close of the Revolutionary War, in the spring of 1784, they returned to the farms, on which they had made beginnings, accompanied by Asa and Joel Brownson, Samuel and Joshua Chamberlain, Jas. Holly, Joseph Wilson and Jesse McFairlain. Settlements were built in areas which were then portions of Huntington, Bolton, Jericho and Williston. Portions of these settlements formed what became Richmond. After petitioning the State, Richmond was granted township status Oct 27 1794, and has the distinction of being the first town chartered by the newly formed State of Vermont. By the time the census was taken in 1800, Richmond had grown to a population of 718. Formal community responsibility began with the first Town Meeting in March 1795.The Winooski River and Huntington River both offered locations for water mills. Industries began to manufacture wagons, harnesses, tinware, brass, cabinet work and woodenware.\n\niv. Nathaniel Winslow b. 9 Apr 1761 in Salisbury, Litchfield County, CT; d. 30 Apr 1831 Thomas Chittenden Cemetery, Williston, Chittenden, Vermont; m1. Joanna Kellogg (b. 4 Jul 1766 in Sheffield, Berkshire, Mass. – d. 15 Mar 1784) Joanna’s parents were Amos Kellogg (1716 – 1770) and Prudence Sedgwick (1724 – 1812);\n\nm2. Anna Hannah [__?__] (b 1766 – 14 Feb 1810 Thomas Chittenden Cemetery, Williston, Chittenden, Vermont,) Nathaniel and Anna had three children born between 1789 and 1803, including Hubbard Winslow (1799-1864) who graduated Yale Theological Seminary in 1825 and spent much of his life as a Presbyterian pastor.\n\nHubbard’s most influential works include Are You a Christian?, Intellectual Philosophy, and Moral Philosophy. The Historical Magazine adjudged “in the province of philosophy he had few equals.” Intellectual Philosophy was a popular 19th century textbook wherein he surveys the history of philosophy and, as well, relates influential thinkers to Christian philosophy in an accessible manner.\n\nIn his Moral Philosophy; Analytical, Synthetical, and Practical, Winslow argues that basing ethics on theoretical philosophy is a “prevailing error.” Metaphysics and logic, he argues, are not subservient to everyday consciousness of freedom and responsibility. In this reading, Winslow argues that philosophy should be used in the service of faith. He believes faith is a direct “manifestation of the truth” presented to each person’s conscience and adduces just as “[w]e must not wait until we can philosophize upon food before we eat…” so also “[n]either should we wait to learn all the grounds and reasons of duty, before doing what we already know to be right.”\n\nv. Mercy Winslow b. 16 Mar 1763 in Salisbury, Litchfield, CT; d. 1840; m. 1785 to John Devereaux (b. 1756 in Goshen, Litchfield, CT – d. 1843 in Richmond, Chittenden, VT) John’s parents were Jonathan Devereaux (1716 – 1767) and Sarah Seymour (1741 – 1808). Mercy and John had nine children between 1786 and 1797.\n\nJohn enlisted as private in Oct 1775 at Richmond, MA, under Captain Moses Ashley, Colonel Patterson’s Regiment. “Was taken prisoner at the battle of the Cedars and paroled in June 1777.”\n\n“John Devereaux was a Sergeant in Washington’s Army. He was repeatedly called into active service and was finally taken prisoner with three hundred of his fellow soldiers, by the enemy, near the Three Rivers in Lower Canada. The severe contest which resulted in their capture lasted for about two hours, when they were compelled to surrender, about one=third of their regular number having been already slain; their wounded companions were now unmercifully mistreated and were plundered of everything. In exchange for their clothing, they had each an Indian blanket. They were then crowded into an old building used as a prison house where they were confined in a state of suffocation and utter distress for twenty-four hours, all food and drink prohibited. After this they were kept close prisoners on an island until fortunately redeemed by an American General.”\n\nThe Battle of The Cedars was a series of military confrontations early in the Revolutionary War during the Continental Army’s invasion of Quebec that had begun in September 1775. The skirmishes, which involved limited combat, occurred in May 1776 at and around The Cedars, 45 km west of Montreal, Quebec. Continental Army units were opposed by a small number of British troops leading a larger force of Indians (primarily Iroquois), and militia.\n\nBrigadier General Benedict Arnold, commanding the American military garrison at Montreal, had placed a detachment of his troops at The Cedars in April 1776, after receiving rumors of British and Indian military preparations to the west of Montreal. The garrison surrendered on May 19 after a confrontation with a combined force of British and Indian troops led by Captain George Forster. American reinforcements on their way to The Cedars were also captured after a brief skirmish on May 20. All of the captives were eventually released after negotiations between Forster and Arnold, who was bringing a sizable force into the area. The terms of the agreement required the Americans to release an equal number of British prisoners. However, the deal was repudiated by the Second Continental Congress, and no British prisoners were freed. Another story is the men were exchanged for British soldiers captured at the St. Jean eight days after their capture.\n\nColonel Timothy Bedel and Lieutenant Isaac Butterfield, leaders of the American force at The Cedars, were court-martialed for their roles in the affair. Bedel was found not guilty and Butterfield was found guilty of cowardice. News of the affair included greatly inflated reports of casualties, and often included graphic but false accounts of atrocities committed by the Iroquois that made up the majority of the British forces\n\nJohn again “Enlisted Aug, 1777, for three months as Sargeant under Captain Fitch, Colonel Henry Livingston’s Regiment in the New York troops.”\n\nJohn Devereaux was living in 1780 at Stephentown, NY.\n\nJohn Devereaux appeared on the census of 1790 at Williston, Chittenden, VT.\n\nJohn Devereaux was living on 1 Jun 1840 at Richmond, MA with his son Alanson\n\nvi.

It received its name by the surveyors from Stockholm, Sweden. It retained its original territory until April 9, 1823, when a part was annexed to Norfolk, and on April 15, 1834, another portion was annexed to the same town. During the War of 1812 some residents left the town and a lesser number returned\n\nIn the 1850 census, Ralph and Rhoda were living in Stockholm, Saint Lawrence, New York with the family of Hugh and Olive Allen.\n\nOne version is Rhoda married Noah Adams (b. 27 Aug 1747 in Pomfret, Windham, CT – d. 26 July 1819 Cavendish, Windsor, Vermont) Noah’s parents were Isaac Adams (1696 – 1757) and Eleanor Fassett (1696 – 1784) Noah first married 22 Nov 1770 Brooklyn Congregational Church, Brooklyn, Windham, CT to Elizabeth Fassett (1749 – 1831) and had five children born between 1773 and 1782. Rhoda and Noah had three children born between 1790 and 1797.\n\nNoah assisted in the defense of the fort at the Battle of Wyoming. July 3, 1778 (See my post about the battle and the adventures of the Blackman family)\n\nThe first settlers in Cavendish, John and Susanna Coffeen and their children, arrived in 1769. Salmon Dutton, who came in 1781, founded what is today known as the village of Cavendish, while Leonard Proctor arrived in 1782, developing what is now called the village of Proctorsville.\n\nThere is a question which Noah Adams married Rhoda Winslow and how it relates to Rhoda’s marriage to Ralph Stearns.\n\nLinda Welch writes – Noah Adams (5) {Isaac (4), Richard (3), James (2), John (1)}, was born in Pomfret Conn, 27 Aug., 1747. He m. in Pomfret, Conn., 22 Nov., 1770, Elizabeth Fassett (b. Pomfret, Conn., 14 June, 1749, dau. of Adonijah Fasset & Anne Copeland); He was a Revolutionary soldier. He was ten years old when his father died Shortly after his marriage he moved to the Susquehanna Land Company’s new settlement in Westmoreland, Connecticut (the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania). A very long story about how they were caught in the cross-fire in the American Revolution… Noah Adams settled finally… in Cavendish (Windsor County) Vermont where he d. 26 July, 1819 (age 72\n\nMaureen Downs writes“Here in Northeatern PA, there are many descendants of Noah Adams (born 1747). I have believed him to be my gggg-grandfather. There is a Noah Adams Family Plot where he is buried in Forkston, Wyoming Co of PA. In the 1940’s, there was a ceremony at the gravesite honoring this Revolutionary War veteran. In fact, there are several local women (long deceased) who gained their membership in the DAR with this Noah Adams as their veteran ancestor. The death date given for Noah Adams was about 1834. Possible but probably questionable. After reading that he indeed moved back to VT and his wife Elizabeth with him and that he died there brought me to ask who really is the Noah Adams who is buried here in PA.\n\nThe local version of the story is that his wife died as did the children of his first marriage and that he then married 2nd, a Rhoda Winslow. He brought her here to NE PA and they had several sons and a daughter among whom were: Gilbert, Seril, Harriett and Asaph. These names are names found in the family of Noah and Miriam (Adams) Adams. Could it be that my gggg grandfather is really Noah Adams born 1763 son of Noah and Miriam Adams? I can’t find any information on Noah (b. 1763) as far as marriage or a deathdate. These Adams are all part of the same family since Miriam was a sister of Noah (b. 1747)!! Adding to the confusion, perhaps causing the confusion, is that the CT Vital records refer to Noah (1747) as “Jr.” in his marraige listing when in fact he was not a JR. but the son of Isaac Adams. Thank you for any information you may be able to provide in sorting this out.”"
