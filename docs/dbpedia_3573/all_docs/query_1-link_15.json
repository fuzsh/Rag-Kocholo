The baptism reportedly occurred on 14 August 1612, but church baptismal records for that period have apparently not survived. He was clearly identified as the eldest son in his father's will probated in 1633, which left to Thomas two houses in Bocking, in one of which Thomas and his new wife Anne Stacie, were then living. His father also left him more houses, buildings and lands which he had purchased from William Collin in Bocking and still more tenements and lands which he had bought from Edward Poppen and John Amptill. To this he added a barn in Panfield Lane that he had purchased from Thomas Trotter.[1]\n\nAt age 21, Thomas had by inheritance become a wealthy man. Like his father, he was a clothier by trade, (Bocking was a center of the woolen trade) and a significant landlord as well.\n\nThomas Fitch married at St. Mary's Church, Bocking, Essex, 1 Nov. 1632, Anne Stacie, daughter of William Stacie and Anne (or Agnes) Garrold. [2]\n\nLife in England\n\nThomas and Anne began their life together in Bocking, and Anne bore their children there. His siblings seem to have lived there as well, with one exception. His father had become friendly with the Rev. Thomas Hooker when he was preaching at Chemsford, and mentioned him in his will. Perhaps because of that connection, Thomas's younger brother James became a student of the charismatic Hooker and in 1638 at age 16 James removed to Hartford, Connecticut to join Hooker there. But Thomas and his family apparently remained in Bocking until about 1650.\n\nWhile a great many people from East Anglia emigrated to North America from 1630 to 1640, many motivated by a desire for freedom to practice their Puritan faith rather than submit to the Church of England headed by the King, one wonders why the wealthy and prosperous Thomas Fitch would leave behind all he had in England for the challenges of life in New England, and do that 10 years after the peak of the migration, after the Puritan side had won the Civil Wars and dethroned the king. While no evidence about his emigration, much less about the cause, has yet turned up, there is a hint in his will, abstracted below: he mentions his great expense in the Parliamentary Wars, which raged during the 1640's. In particular, fighting revived in Essex in 1648, where months of culminated in the defeat of the Royalists after an eleven-week-long siege of Colchester--just 12 miles east of Bocking. Whether he was on the losing side or just suffered losses from the taxation, military foraging, popular rioting, battles, and sequesters, all this instability was clearly bad for Fitch's clothing and other business activities. Perhaps his prosperity in Bocking had declined to the point at which he had no reason to remain there, and he thought about joining his younger brother James in the New World instead.[3]\n\nLife in Connecticut\n\nRecords of the voyage of the Fitch family to New England circa 1650 have yet to be found. Thomas, his wife, his five children, his mother Anne, and his not-yet-married brothers Samuel and Joseph all appeared in New England around that time and the general assumption is that they traveled as a group, led and paid for by Thomas, who mentions in his will the effect of the transportation of himself and family on his fortunes. Perhaps they traveled through Hartford, the established town in which his brother James had settled in 1638 and where his brother Samuel and their mother ended up settling, or through Saybrook, where James had become the pastor. Whatever their route may have been, Thomas, his wife and children, and his brother Joseph arrived in Norwalk, about 1651.\n\nThe first New England records of Thomas Fitch are in Norwalk, Connecticut Colony, which began to be settled in 1650. The first settlers entered into an agreement with Roger Ludlowe, signed 19 June 1650, in which Ludlowe released to them his rights under his earlier purchase agreement with the local Indians; Thomas is not listed on that 1650 agreement. However, on 15 February 1651/2, Thomas and his brother Joseph are listed among the settlers in the deed between the settlers and another group of Indians led by Runclinheage,[4] which strongly suggests that the Fitches arrived in Norwalk between those dates.\n\nThomas quickly settled in. He purchased in 1652 the centrally located 4 acre home lot and buildings from Edward Church, and he, his wife and their five children moved right in. In that same year he purchased several acres of upland from George Abbott and the town father granted to him 4 more plots totalling 15 acres and 4 roods, In the following three years he was granted 9 more plots, aggregating over 35 acres of meadows, salt marsh, and upland, and purchased another house lot and meadowlands from Edward Church.[5] He had rapidly become, in words attributed to Roger Ludlowe, the wealthiest citizen of Norwalk.[6]\n\nHis landholdings in Norwalk continued to expand. Further grants, not dated but documented between records dated 1686 and 1688, aggregated 64 acres in every part of the town, from Rowayton in the south to Chestnut Hill and Mahakeno in the north and east to the Saugatuck River.[7]\n\nThomas Fitch was not only the wealthiest Norwalker of his time, he was one of the most active in civic affairs. He was Norwalk's Clerk of the Train Band, Recorder of Laws and Selectman in 1659, and King's Commissioner beginning in 1669 and continuing in that role for 25 years. He represented Norwalk in the Connecticut General Court in 1673, 1676, 1680-86, 1691-92 and 1694, and served as Deputy Governor of the colony.[8]\n\nWill, and Death eight years later\n\nThomas made his will on 6 October 1696 in Norwalk, Fairfield, Connecticut. He named and bequeathed lands to grandson Thomas Fitch [son of Thomas] and to grandsons John & Nathaniel Fitch [sons of John]; named and bequeathed items to dau. Ann now wife of John Thompson of Farmington; dau. Mary now wife of Capt. Matthew Sherwood; son John & John's wife; \"son\"[in-law] Capt. Matthew Sherwood & cousin Sergt. John Platt, overseers. He mentioned his great expense in the parliamentary wars in England and in the transportation of himself & family to New England. Inventory dated 14 April 1704. John Fitch as executor engaged to give to the children of his deceased sister Burr the same amount which his other sisters had by will.[9]\n\nChildren\n\nThomas and Anne Fitch had at least six children, all born in or near Bocking, Essex, England. Birth dates are unknown, because the baptismal records of the parish of St Mary, Bocking in the pertinent period are unfortunately lost. His will, and records in Connecticut, are helpful:[9][6]\n\nThomas, possibly the Thomas born to Thomas and Ann Fitch who was baptized at the Church of the Holy Cross in nearby Felsted on 24 Feb 1640[10], m. Ruth Clark. He died before his father wrote his will in 1696\n\nJohn, m. Rebecca Lindall, inherited the bulk of the estate\n\nMary, m. Matthew Sherwood\n\nAnn, m. John Thompson\n\nSamuel, died, apparently without issue, before his father wrote his will in 1696\n\nSarah, m. John Burr, not mentioned in her father's will and had died by then. She was mentioned, as deceased and by her married name, by brother John in the probate of their father's will.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Probated in Prerogative Court of Canterbury, 12 Feb 1633\n\n↑ [https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XK8H-CV4. \"England, Essex Parish Registers, 1538-1997,\" database, FamilySearch \"Thomas Fytch and Anna Stacie, 01 Nov 1632\" ; citing Marriage, St. Mary, Bocking, Essex, England, Essex Record Office, England.\n\n↑ Brian Lyndon, \"Essex and the King's Cause in 1648\", in The Historical Journal, March 1986, pp. 17-39, viewable on jstor, gives a thorough account of the military events and the political machinations that led up to them, briefly mentioning the disruptions to ordinary life.
