He received his education in Boston, and practiced law in that City with success. In 1774, at the height of Hutchinson's unpopularity, Mr. Fitch was one of the signers of the address approving his course, and warmly espoused the royalist cause. Ill 1776 he removed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he held, under the king, the office of solicitor, or counselor at law, to the board of commissioners. He was proscribed and banished from the United Colonies in 1778, and was included in the conspiracy act of 1779. The same year (1779) he went to England, visited Hutchinson in his retirement and decline, and was appointed to deliver the loyalist address to the king. In 1783 he paid another official visit to England, remained two years, returning to Halifax in 1785, where he died.\n\nEdited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright Â© 2001 VirtualologyTM\n\nStart your search on Samuel Fitch.\n\nUnauthorized Site: This site and its contents are not affiliated, connected, associated with or authorized by the individual, family, friends, or trademarked entities utilizing any part or the subject's entire name.
