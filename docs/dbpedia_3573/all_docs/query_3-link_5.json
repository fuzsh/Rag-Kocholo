Mayflower Births and Deaths credits Samuell and Mary Anne with the following:[4]\n\nMary Fitch\n\nSamuel Fitch\n\nHezekiah Fitch\n\nElizabeth Fitch\n\nAbigail Fitch\n\nSamuel Fitch\n\nBenjamin Fitch\n\nJohn Fitch\n\nJabez Fitch\n\nPeltiel Fitch\n\nSamuel, Mary, and their children resided in Norwich and in Long Society (now Preston), New London Co., CT. Samuel was one of the first proprietors of Lebanon, New London Co., CT but he and Mary lived on the east side of the Shetucket River in what was designated, for ecclesiastical purposes, as the Fifth Society of Norwich. It was also known as East Norwich, Long Society, and then later, Preston. This is corroborated in part by The History of Norwich, Connecticut: from Its Possession by the Indians to the year 1866:\n\n\"The district on the east side of the river comprised Long Society, or East Norwich ; but the grants made by the town were not wholly limited to this society. A considerable portion of Preston was held originally by the same tenure. Its earliest land-owners and inhabitants settled under the authority of Norwich and were admitted to the privileges of the town, included also in the same church bounds, as parishioners of Mr. [Rev. James] Fitch. [Samuel's father.] In all probability Greenfield Larrabee was the first settler in this region, — the first actual inhabitant of the town of Preston. Next to him we may reckon the sons of Norwich proprietors, — Thomas Tracy, Jun., Jonathan Tracy, Samuel Fitch, and Nathaniel Letfingwell, who were cultivating farms on that side of Shetucket river in 1680, or soon afterward\" (242).[5]\n\nHe died on 18 Feb 1725 in Preston, New London Co., CT. and is buried in Brewster's Neck Cemetery, Preston, Connecticut.[6]\n\nNote\n\nA previous PM left this a reference number for Samuel: JTF6. Anyone know to what it pertains? Mayflower Society?
