He died on 18 (church record) or 19 (town record) November 1702 in Lebanon, New London County, Connecticut. [1] Mr. James Fitch of Saybrook married first Mrs. Abigail Whitfield, the daughter of Mr. Henry Whitford of Guilford in October 1648 in Norwich. [2] Mr. James Fitch, the pastor of the Church of Christ at Norwich married second Mrs. Priscilla Mason, the daughter of Major Mason of Norwich in October 1664 in Norwich. [2] Priscilla was also the daughter of Ann Peck, the daughter of Reverend Robert Peck. [3]\n\nAbigail, the daughter of Reverend Henry Whitfield and Dorothy Sheafe, was baptized on 1 September 1622 in Ockley, county Surrey. [4] Mrs. Abigail Fitch died on 9 September 1659 in Saybrook or Norwich. [1][2]\n\nAccording to the Old Saybrook church records, James came to New England from Boking, Essex. He was the first ordained pastor at Saybrook in 1646. He moved to Norwich in 1660. He died on 18 November 1702, age 80. [5]\n\nThe 15 May 1656 court at Hartford granted Mr. James Finch a farm of between 200 and 300 acres at Menunketeseck, so far as it was within their power to do so. [6]\n\nThe General Court at Hartford on 11 March 1657/8 appointed William Waller to forthwith \"make due satisfaction to those who are appointed by the Townesmen of Seabrook to levy the rate for Mr. Fitches Maintenance, or otherwise to make his appearance at the Gen: Court in May next to give an account of his neglect.\" [6, 1:312]\n\nIn 1660 James led a portion of his Saybrook congregation into the wilderness to settle the town of Norwich. [7]\n\nThe court granted 100 acres of upland and 20 acres of meadow to Mr. James Fitch of Norwich on 11 October 1666. James subsequently purchased the native right in this grant from the Uncas, Owaneco and Attawanhood, to be taken up as close to the farm of Major Mason at Pomacook as convenient. The court granted a patent to Major Mason and Mr. Fitch for their lands at Pomacook in 1686. [6]\n\nOn 16 May 1668, the court, in order to promote peace in the churches and plantations appointed Mr. James Fitch to a committee to meet at Saybrook or Norwich on 8 or 9 June and consider how to promote peace in the churches despite some differences over such matters as membership and baptism. On 8 October 1668 James was appointed to a committee to meet with the inhabitants of Windsor and attempt to restore peace in the church there. [6]\n\nMr. James Fitch was on a 5 October 1669 list of freemen in Norwich. [6]\n\nJames Fitch devoted himself to missionary work among the Indians of Connecticutâespecially the Mohegans. He learned their language and directed his energy at converting the sachem Uncas and his son Owaneco. [7]\n\nOn 14 May 1674 the court thanked James for preaching the election sermon. On 13 May 1675 they granted to James Fitch, Sr. and Lieutenant John Mason each 200 acres of land that had been given to them by the Indians. [6]\n\nReverend Mr. Fitch was chosen minister of the army on 11 May 1677. [6] He played an important role providing intelligence and as a go-between for the court and the Indians during King Philip's War and helped maintain their loyalty.\n\nReverend James Fitch was one of those admitted to the First Congregational Church in Norwich between 1660 and 1699.
