        "text": "Notes for Rev. James Fitch\n\nHe was also said to have been born 22 Dec 1622. 213\n\nHe was also said to have died 19 Nov. 1702. 556\n\n“James emigrated to America in 1638 or 1639 at the age of sixteen and finished his theological training at Hartford, Hartford Co., CT, under the Reverend Thomas Hooker. He was ordained as minister at Saybrook, and left (after the death of his first wife) in 1659 to become the minister in Norwich. Several of his letters, treatises, and sermons survive. He served as a chaplain for colonial troops in conflict with hostile Indians and later helped in resettlement programs for ‘surrenderers.’ He was disabled by a stroke in 1694 and replaced , temporarily, in the Norwich pulpit by his son, the Reverend Jabez Fitch, who had just completed his studies at Harvard. James retired to what later became Lebanon, where he died and was buried. The Latin inscription on his grave stone in the old Trumbull Cemetery was probably composed by his son Jabez. All of the children are mentioned in their father’s will.” 1006\n\n“The Fitch family was one of distinction in our Colonial annals. The Rev. James Fitch, the first minister in Saybrook and Norwich, the grandfather of Captain James, was born in Bocking, Essex, England. At the age of sixteen he had entered college at Cambridge, when he came over in 1638, the youngest of three sons, with his mother, a widow, to this country. He then passed seven years under the instruction of those eminent divines, the Rev. Mr. Hooker and his assistant the Rev. Mr. Stone, both graduates of Emanuel College, Cambridge, of which the former was a Fellow, and both regularly ordained clergymen of the Church of England, though afterwards silenced by the Spiritual Court for non-con formity. Mr. Fitch was ordained at Saybrook in 1646, the Rev. Mr. Hooker presiding at ‘this ceremony, with the imposition of hands by those appointed to that office - the same form was always used, - and was a Congregational ordination in the strictest sens of the term.’ He was considered a man of great learning and piety. His penetration of mind as well as energy caused him to be often in civil affairs. . . He had a large family. His sons were prosperous and extensive hand owners, and prominent in the public service, and ‘the daughters are said to have been very handsome, attractive and accomplished ladies. Among his descendants at the time of the Revolution there were a number who sided with the mother country, and went to Canada or London to live. Several were very distinguished men in both the civil and army life of the English government.” 1733\n\nHe was the first minister of Norwich, Ct. 1707\n\n“In the year 1660, the Rev. James Fitch,the first pastor of the church of Saybrook, with the greater part of his church, moved from Saybrook to Norwich. Said Mr. Fitch continued to be pastor of said church at Norwich, until by reason of his age and infirmity he resigned his said office about the year 1696, and in 1702 removed to the town of lebanon, and soon after died in a good old age. . . .He had nine sons and five daughters. One or more of his sons settled in Lebanon, where he retired after the infirmities of age rendered him unable to pursue his public labors, where he died. The old burying-ground in Lebanon received his remains, and contains a monument to his memory. . . .Those of the name in the vicinity of Windham, Lebanon, Canterbury, Preston, Norwich, and Montville are his descendants. Those in the western part of the state (Connecticut) descended from his brother Thomas, who settled in Norwalk.” Inscription on his monument in Latin to be entered. 1766\n\n“the reputation of the senior Fitch did not rest on his theological writing, however, but on his vigorous missionary work among the Indians of Connecticut, particularly the Mohegas. Having mastered the Indian language, Fitch worked diligently to convert the famous chieftain Uncas and his son Owaneco. For a time the work among ‘those poor heathen’ was so promising that the General Assembly of Connecticut acknowledged a readiness to ‘encourage Mr. Fitch in the work,’ and he received funds from the united Commissioners. During King Philip’s War, Fitch was particularly useful to the colony, maintaining the loyalty of the Mohegans and accompanying the colony’s forces into battle.” 1727\n\n“James came to America in 1638, when he was 16, in the company of 13 young men all of whom intended to enter the ministry. In 1646 he was ordained as Pastor of the Church at Saybrook, Connecticut. James was also a missionary ot he Mohecans and preached to them in their own tongue. He served as a Chaplain in King Philip’s War. In 1696 he retired and in 1702 moved to Lebanon where the Indians had given him 5 square miles ofland in Windham, in accordance with the will of Joshua Uncas, a Christian Mohecan chief.”1728\n\nHe was said to have had 6 children with wife Abigail Whitfield. 213\n\n“Res. Came to New England in 1638, aged 16; ordained Pastor of Saybrook, Conn., 1646; in 1660 removed with greater part of his congregation to Norwich, Conn.; retured from ministry in 1696; in 1702 he retired to Lebanon, Conn. Chaplain in King Philip’s War.” 1729\n\n“Descendants eligible to Ohio Society of Colonial Wars. Descendants eligible to Founders and Pariots.” 1729\n\n“Fitch, Rev. James, and Thomas, his father. Hartford and elsewhere, Connecticut.\n\nArms: Vert a chevron between three leopard’s faces gold.\n\nAlso (the ancient arms of ffyytche) Gold a roundle between three crosslets fitched sable.\n\nCrest: A leopard’s face gold in his mouth a sword proper the hilt gules.” Picture on file. 664\n\n“From this period [1645] the settlement [Saybrook] took a new start. It had been hitherto merely a military post; it was now a plantation, and the inhabitants increased rapidly. In 1646, a church was organized, and Mr. James Fitch ordained for its minister. . . . Saybrook has no church records of the period of Mr. Fitch’s ministry, and the town records before 1660, are also wanting. A few items only of earlier date may be found standing amid subsequent entries. One of these, (perhaps the earliest remaining of a municipal character,) is a notice of a town meeting, January 7, 1655-6, at which the following persons were present . . . At the same time mention is made of Mr. Fitch and Mr. Lay.” 1732\n\n“Thus it appears that the early inhabitants of nearly all our towns were obliged to wage an annual war, not only with wild beasts, venomous serpents and pilfering animals that burrowed in the ground, but with predatory fowls swarming in the air. But that the people of Saybrook were routed from their habitations, and forced into exile by the inroads of voracious birds, was doubtless a pleasant satire rather than a fact. President Styles notices the tradition in his diary, but dismisses it, expressing an opinion with which most people who consider the circumstances will coincide, that Mr. Fitch and his congregation relinquished their Saybrook grants in the hope of finding accomodations better adapted to their pursuits and aspirations at Norwich. . . . The probability is that Mr. Fitch and Major Mason had the privilege of a first choice. ”1732\n\n“The following list comprises those against whom not only nothing is found to militate against their being ranked as first proprietors, but, on the contrary, the records either prove conclusively, or favor the idea, that they belonged to that class:\n\nRev. James Fitch . . . “ 1732\n\n“The dwellings of Mr. Fitch and Major Mason were near together, facing the Green, and with the river in their rear. The road running from the Green to the river, and spanning the stream with a bridge, separated the two homesteads. The allotment of Mr. Fitch, consisting of eleven acres, was on the south-east side of the Green; the home-lot of Mason, ‘eight acres more or less,’ - the early measurements were extremely liberal, - was on the south-west side.” 1732\n\n“He came to Norwich a widower, with six children; two of them sons, five and eleven years of age, who became active business men, and appear in so short a time taking part in the affairs of the town that it might be a pardonable inaccuracy were they ranked as original planters.” 1732\n\n“We may therefore conclude that the first nuptial ceremony within the bounds of the new plantation, was that in which its widowed minister, the Rev. James Fitch, was united to Priscilla Mason. This was in October, 1664, and as the marriage service was then commonly performed by a magistrate, we may suppose that Major Mason himself officiated upon the occasion.” 1732\n\n“A strip of land, about three miles in breadth, lying between the northern boundary of New London and the southern of Norwich, gave rise to much litigation and controbersy, not only among individuals, but between the two towns, and the whites and Indians. Three parties claimed it, and each was officious in selling and conveying it to individuals, so that a collision of claims and interests was inevitable. It was long before this affair was satisfactorily settled. Many committees were appointed; and the town hoped to arrange the difficulty by referring it, as far as they were concerned, ‘to the worshipful Samuel Mason and the Rev. Mr. Fitch.’ This tract is now included inMontville. ‘ Dec. 31, 1669. ‘Ordered by the town concerning the outlands that there shall be only one allotment for the said lands and every man shall take his allotment in the place where God by his Providence shall cast it, Mr. Fitch only excepted.’ The meaning probably is, that Mr. Fitch had the liberty of choice, but others must abide by the lot. . . A gate was maintained at the town charge below the house of John Reynolds, another at Thomas Bliss’s, or Liffingwell’s corner, a third at the end of the Green by Mr. Fitch’s, a fourth at Quarter-bridge lane, near the houses of John Calkins and Samuel Griswold, and a fifth at Stephen Merrick’s on Bean Hill.” 1732\n\n“The conversion of these Indians was a cherished object witht he Rev. Mr. Fitch. He continually sought opportunities for sowing the seed, and his earnest faith and large-hearted charity made him hopeful of the harvest. He cultivated an intercourse with the tribe, and made use of every opportunity for acquiring their language. . Mr. Fitch, having a great purpose in view, pursued the study of the native tongue with system and a fair measure of success. After a few years he was able not only to instruct in private, or with an interpreter, but could speak in a way to be understood and appreciated in assemblies of the tribe. With the sachems and chiefs, Christianity was never popular . . but smong the poorer, gentler, and more scattered families, particularly among the tributaries and those adopted from other tribes, who were often oppressed by Uncas, Mr. Fitch found willing ears and accessible hearts. Here the gospel seemed to come as into a prepared place, bringing with it peace and comfort. Mr. Fitch rejoiced over these poor people as over lost children that had been found,and collected them into a small community, settling over them instructors and guardians from among themselves, whom he himself taught and trained for their office. The war with Philip commenced in June, 1675, and raged about raged about fifteen months. Mr. Fitch was an active agent and valued counselor of the government. . . Uncas came to consult with Mr. Fitch, and Mr. Fitch visited the Pequots to see if all was right in that quarter. the Indians consented to join the English, but apparently with a doubtful mind, and inclined to take that side only because it was the strongest. Of Uncas the English had at first deep distrust. He professed great friendship in his consultation with Mr. Fitch, but the latter thought it prudent that he should be induced to commit himself as soon as possible, by some act of hostility against Philip. The sachem saw where his interest lay, and consented to engage in immediate action. Before the end of July, fifty Mohegan warriors, staunch and well caparisoned, under the command of Owaneco, who had two other sons or near relatives on Uncas with him, were ready to start for Boston, there to offer their services against the Picasset chief. They paused in Norwich to obtain letters from Mr. Fitch and Lieut. Mason, and then proceeded to the Bay. . . On the 25th of January, 1676, Major Treat left New London on a second expedition into the wilderness, with a force of about 300 men. Mr. Fitch accompanied him as chaplain, - Uncas and his warriors as scouts. . . The Council of ar therefore appointed three Commissioners, Samuel Wyllis, James Richards, and John Allyn, to hold a general Indian convention at Norwich on the second wednesday of December, and there, in concert with Mr. Fitch, as one of them, ‘to received, dispose and settle alll surrenderers according to order. . . Feb. 1, 1676-7. A motion was made by the Rev. Mr. Fitch with reference to a place of residence for those Indians who are listed surrenderers, where they might be entertained and accommodated with lands for their improvement in order to their comfortable living till such time as some other way may be made open for them. . . . The kind-hearted Mr. Fitch labored hard for his poor Indians, yet with unsatisfying results. Our of the hundreds that surrendered during the war, only one village consisting of about thirty families was actually established, and this was on areservation, laid out by the town for this express purpose, betweent he rivers Shetucket and quinebaug, whre Owaneco and his people had formerly sojourned. . . .Mr. Fitch, in his report of the business to the General Court, observes: ‘ I am sufficiently informed there are a considerable number more abiding with Uncus, who are doubtless willing to come and settle with the others, but are meerly hindered by Uncus.’” 1732\n\n“The summer of 1676 was remarkable for a long-continued drought. . . At length they applied to mr. Fitch, entreating him to intercede with the Lord of the harvest to refresh their drooping fields with the customary showers. Of this drought and the successful prayer for rain, an account is given under Mr. Fitch’s own hand, which he calls ‘a true narrative of that providence.’ [prayer to be entered] . . . The sachem’s recognition of the might power of God, in the successful prayer for rain, was in 1676. But in May, 1678, Mr. Fitch depicts his character in colors of the blackest dye. He accuses him of hostility to the English, and hatred of their rulers, laws, and religion; of cunning, malice, robbery, oppression, and breaking of pledges.” 1732\n\n“This venerated man died at Lebanon; a plantation in which he had taken great interest, and where several of his children had established their homes. In the quiet cemetery of that place, where almost a congregation of good and great men have since been gathered, he was laid to rest. The monumental tablet that marks his grave, has an elaborate Latin inscription, said to have been written by his son, the Rev. Jabez Fitch, that furnishes a judicious and comprehensive sumamry of his life and character.” Translation of memorial to be entered. “ 1732\n\n“It appears that the father of the family had deceased, and that the mother with several sons emigrated to this country in 1638. The exact number of the brothers that came over has not been definitely ascertained. Thomas, Joseph and James can be clearly traced. . . . Of Mr. James Fitch, our immediate subject, we have a statement of his birth, emigration at the age of sicteen, and seven years of theological instruction at Hartford, and this is all that is known of him previous to his ordination at Saybrook in 1646. At this ceremony, Mr. Hooker of Hartford was present, but the imposition of hands was by two of the brethren appointed by the church to that office. . . . This was a Congregational ordination in the strictest sense of the term. The element of independence thus wrought into the original structure of Mr. Fitch’s church, was brought with it to Norwich, and has never died out.” Details to be entered, including his signature. 1732\n\n“Mr. Fitch was twice married, and had fourteen children, whose births are all recorded at Norwich, though the first were born in Saybrook, and are also recorded there, with the death of the first wife. All the children except Elizabeth are referred to as among the living, in the will of their father, february, 1696, and it is not improbable that twelve followed his remains to the grave. . . .Mr. Fitch had himself nine sons, and his oldest son James the same number. . . It is a little singular that not one of the sons of Mr. Fitch established his permanent home in Norwich. James went to Canterbury. . . Two of these daughters, viz., Abrigail and Hannah, remained at Norwich.” 1732\n\nThe Patent of the Town of Norwich, A.D. 1685 lists “Mr. Jaames Fitch senr, Capt. James Fitch” as two of the proprietors of the township of Norwich and grants them land. [text to be entered] 1732\n\n“In 1694, Mr. Fitch was suddenly disabled from preaching by a stroke of the palsy. This led to the following action:\n\n‘At a town meeting Sept. 12, 1694.\n\nInasmuch as ithath pleased God to lay his afflicting hand upon our Reverend pastor Mr. James Fitch that at present he is disabled with respect to the work of the ministry among us - Wherfore the towne appoint Left. Thomas Leffingwell, Left, William Backus, Simon Huntington Senr. Thomas Adgate and Richard Bushnell a Committee to treat with Mr. Jabez Fitch with respect unto his succeeding of his father in the work of the ministry among us.’ . .. Aug. 29, 1698. The preamble of a vote alludes to the melancholy fact that the town is ‘yet destitute of a preaching minister;’ and nine persons were designated as a committee, who, in concert with the Rev. Mr. Fitch, were authorized to look out for a pastor. This reference to mr. Fitch shows that his mind still retained its vigor, and that his people were in the habit of resorting to him for counsel and direction. Nor were they unmindful of his support. After he was disabled from service, a rate was annually collected for his use, amounting to forty, fifty, and one year to seventy pounds. There can be little doubt that he was favored also with many free-will offerings, and that his people wre studious to please and gratify him in the choice of a successor. . . The church organization in the days of Mr. Fitch not only extended over the nine-miles-square, but took in the new settlements of Windham and Canterbury.“ 1732\n\n“Thomas Meeks, son of Thomas of New Haven, and there born in 1635, married June 30, 1677, Hannah, daughter of Rev. James Fitch. He settled upon a farm belonging to Mr. Fitch, east of the Shetucket. A tract of twenty acres, ‘where his house stands,’ was confirmed to him July 16, 1680, as a free gift from Mr. Fitch to his daughter.” 1732\n\n“When the conflict [King Philip’s War] was over, a part of this tract was assigned to the Indian fugitives, called Surrenderers, and in May, 1678, Mr. Fitch reported to the government that twenty-nine families of this class had settled upon it under the supervision of th English.” 1732\n\n“Jan:31, 1701-2. The names of the first settlers now surviving are as followeth, -\n\nThe Rev. Mr. James Fitch. (died 18 Nov. 1702.).”1732\n\n“Half-century ministers, settled fifty years of more over one congragation within the original bounds of Norwich: James Fitch, 56 years. Congregational.” 1732\n\n“Fitch, Rev. James, was from the county of Essex, in England, and received the foundation of his education in England, though he came to this country in his boyhood, (about 16 years old.) He was placed in charge of Rev. Thomas Hooker and Samuel Stone, for the completion of his literary and religious education, where he remained about seven years. He was soon after settled at Saybrook, and remained there about 14 years, until he removed to Norwich, in 1660, with most of his church, where he closed his pastoral life in his old age, and died in 1702, aged about 80, (at Lebanon with his children.) He had two wives. His first wife was Abigail, the daughter of Mr. Whitefield, of Guilford. His children born at Saybrook were, James in ‘47 - Abigail in ‘50 - Elizath in ‘52 - Hannah in ‘54 - Samuel in ‘55, and Dorothy in ‘58. His wife died in ‘59. After he removed to Norwich, in ‘64, he married Priscilla, a daughter of Major General Mason, who resided at Norwich. By this marriage, his children were, Daniel, John, Jeremiah, Jabez, Anna, Nathaniel, Josiah and Eleazer, in all fourteen children, and a majority of them sons, which was fortunate in the early settlement; thirteen of them married and had families. Thomas Fitch, who was an early settler at Norwalk, and father of Gov. Fitch, was a brother of Rev. James; also, Jospeh, of Windsor was his brother. Mr. Fitch came to this country was 13 other young men in 1638, to prepare for and become ministers of the gospel - most of whom effected their object. [Record, Tombstone & Miss Caulkins.] “ 1747\n\n“[Regarding King Philip’s War] Reverend James Fitch of Norwich told Uncas, it would soon ‘come to the triall who are freinds and who are foes.’ “ 309\n\n“Certain men among the English, because of their place of residence and their connections, specialized in dealing with one or another of these tribes. The minister at Norwich, Mr. James Fitch, usually maintained a close liaison with Uncas and the Mohegans.” 309\n\n“The Rev. Fitch is buried in the old Trumbull Cemetery. There is a large gravestone at the site with a very long Latin inscription on it and a smaller footstone in English.” 1767\n\n“The independent tribes of the Nipmucks were ripe for revolt. Initial successes on his [King Philip’s] part were all that were needed to bring them to his aid, but he knew equally well that sympathy, the sense of common wrongs, and a tentative understanding, were but feeble reeds on which to lean if disaster threatened. [If they (the Pequots) doubt eh victory ‘they would be in hazard of joining with the stronger.’ - Letter of Rev. James Fitch of Norwich to the Council of Connecticut. Conn. Records, Vol II, page 337.] 308\n\n“A letter written by the Rev. Mr. Fitch of Norwich to the Connecticut Council records the capture by Mohegans of 111 women and children about this time, who were afterwards sold into slavery. - Conn. Records, Vol. II, page 355.” 308\n\n“Rev. James Fitch of Saybrook was born December 24, 1622, at Bocking, County Essex, England. He was ordained in the ministry in 1646. His wife died in 1659 and he removed the next year with a large part of his Saybrook church to the settlement of Norwich. He gave up his office in 1696 and removed to Lebanon where he died November 18, 1702. - Savage.” 308\n\n“In June, 1659, Uncas, with his two sons, Owaneco and Attawanhood, by a more formal and authentic deed, made over unto said Leffingwell, John Mason, Esq. the Rev. James Fitch, and others, consisting of thirty-five proprietors, the whole township of Norwich, which is about nine miles square. The company, at this time, gave Uncas and his sons about seventy pounds, as a further compensation for so large and fine a tract. Preparations were immediately made for its settlement’ and, this spring, the Rev. James Fitch, with the principal part of his church and congregation, removed from Saybrook, and planted the town of Norwich.” 1384\n\n“In 1646, a church was formed in that town [Saybrook] by the direction and assistance of the Rev. Mr. Hooker and some other ministers. At the same time, Mr. James Fitch, who had perfected his theological studies, under the direction of Mr. Hooker, was ordained their pastor. The tradition is, that though Mr. Hooker was present, yet that hands were imposed by two or three of the principal brethren, whom the church had appointed to that service. . . In 1660, Mr. Fitch and the greatest part of his church removed to Norwich.” 1384\n\n“At the election, May 11th [1676] . . . The Rev. Gershom Bulkley, of Weathersfield, was appointed surgeon, and Mr. James Fitch chaplain. . . . The assembly ordered that the surgeon and chaplain should be of the council of war.” 1384\n\n“the legislature, having given over all further attempts to compose the divisions in the colony, by public disputation and the decisions of general councils, detrmined to pursue a different course. They conceived the design of uniting the churches in some general plan of church communion and discipline, by which they might walk, nothwithstanding their different sentiments, in points of less importance. With this view, an act pass authorizing the Rev. Messrs. James Fitch, Gershom Bulkley, Joseph Elliot,a nd Samuel Wakeman, to meet at Saybrook, and devise a way in which this desirable purpose might be effected. This appears to have been the first step towards forming a religious constitution.” 1384\n\n“Some pains were take on instruct and christianize the Connecticut Indians. A law was made, obliging those under the protection of the government to keep the christian sabbath. The Rev. Mr. Fitch was particularly desired to teach Uncas and his family christianity.” 1384\n\n“This year that venerable man, the Reverend James Fitch, pastor of the church in Norwich, finished his course, at Lebanon, in the 80th year of his age. His history and character are given in the inscription upon his monumental stone. [Latin text to be entered]\n\nIn English to this effect.\n\nIn this grave are deposited the remains of that truly reverenc man, Mr. James Fitch. He was born at Boking, in the country of Essex, in England, the 24th of December, in the year of our Lord, 1622. Who, after he had been most excellently taught the learned languages, came into New-England, at the age of sixteen; and then spent seven years under the instruction of those very famous men, Mr. Hooker and Mr. Stone. Afterwards, he discharged the pastoral office, fourteen years, at Saybrook. Thence he removed, witht he major part of his church, to Norwich; where he spent the other years of his life in the work of the gospel. In his old age, indeed, he was obliged to cease from his public labors, by reason of bodily indisposition; and at length retured to his children, at Lebanon; where, after spending nearly half a year, he slept in Jesus, in the year 1702, on the 18th of Novemer, in the 80th year of his age.\n\nHe was a man, as to the smartness of his genius, the solidity of his judment, his charity, holy labors, and every kind of purity of life, and also as to his skill and energy of preaching, inferior to none.” 1384\n\nIn a list of ministers in the County of New London, James Fitch is listed twice, once in Saybrook and once in Norwich, ordained or installed 1660 and died or removed 1702. 1384\n\nIn a listing of “Students/recent graduates who became ministers in New England.\n\nAll from the University of Cambridge unless otherwise stated. . .\n\nFitch, James educated by Thomas Hooker Date of emigration 1638”846\n\n“During the winter [1675/6] Capt.

This company went up the river by water to Northampto, and from thence joined Major Talcott with supplies of which the army was in pressing need. They had suffered so much on their route, that the soldiers gave it the name of the long and hungry march.
