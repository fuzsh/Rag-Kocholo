        "text": "Lancton, John, jr. Farmingtondied in 1683. He owned a house and land at Northampton. He was a son of Deacon Lancton. Lester, Edward, held land about New London in 1653.\n\nLovering, William a hatter by tradewas admitted an inhabitant of Hartford in 1658.\n\nLoomis, Joseph, sen'r. Windsor, 1639. From history, tradition and records, it appears, and is believed by the Loomis family, that Joseph Loomis and his family were the only persons of the name who came to Windsor in the early settlement of the town, (as early as 1639)that he with his family, consisting of himself, wife, five sons and one daughter, emigrated from, at, or near Bristol in England, to New England, in the ship Mary and John, Captain Squid, master, which sailed from Plymouth, England, March 20, 1630, and arrived at Nantasket Point, May 30th the same year. From thence with the Rev. John Warham's church and people, in '36, he emigrated to Windsor, (or with Mr. Hewit in '39.) From all that is known it is quite certain that all the Loomises in this part of the country have originated from this family. The names of the five sons are as follows, viz. John, Joseph, Thomas, Nathaniel and Samuel, and daughter, Elizabeth. They all settled in the town of Windsor, and there remained until after Philip's war. Timothy, (in No. 2,) was recorder at a much later period than '39. [Dr. McClure was mistaken as to Timothy's coming to Windsor in '39, with Mr. Huit.] He died in Windsor in 1658his wife died in '52. Joseph, jr., son of Joseph, sen'r., of Windsor, died in '87. Estate £281. His children were, Joseph, 38 years old, John 36, Mary 34, Hannah 25, Matthew 23, Stephen 20, James 17, Nathaniel 14, and Isaac 9, at his decease. John Loomis was an appraiser of his estate, with H. Wolcott and John Wolcottperhaps at that time an appraiser could be a relative. John, of Windsor, married Elizabeth Scott, and had John, born in '49, Joseph, Thomas, Samuel, Daniel, James, Timothy, Nathaniel, David, Samuel, Isaac, Elizabeth and Mary. Thomas, married Hannah Fox in '53, and had Thomas, (died) Thomas, Hannah, and Mary. His wife died. He then married a second wife, and had Elizabeth, Ruth, Sarah, Jeremiah, (died) Mabel, Mindwell, &c. Nathaniel, married Elizabeth Moore, and had 12 children. Samuel, married and had 5 children. John, of Windsor, had a grand daughter, Anna Loomis, daughter of Joseph, born in '78. Lynde, Nathaniel, was an early settler of Saybrookhis son, Samuel, was a native of the town. Nathaniel, gave the first building for a College at Saybrook. His son, Samuel, was many years a member of the Council and a Judge in Connecticut. The other early settlers found upon record were, the Major, Rev. Mr. Higginson, Peters, Barker, Lieut. Bull, Bushnell Clark, Lay, Lord, Parker, William Pratt, Post, Champion, M. Griswold, Lee, Wade, Backus, Bliss, Huntington, Hyde, Larrabee, Leffingwell, Breede, Chalker, Waterhouse, Kirtland, Shipman, Whittlesey, Willard, Lieut. Seely. Mr. Higginson was the first unordained minister at Saybrook. He married the daughter of the Rev. Henry Whitefield, of Guilford, and afterwards became his assistant at Guilford, and about 1660 he moved to Salem to assist his father.\n\nLyman, Samuel moved from Northampton to Lebanon, and from thence to Coventry about 1718. Noah Carpenter, son of Benjamin, came from Northampton to Coventry at a later period, 1730.\n\nLucas, William owned land in Middletown in 1667he probably resided there previously.\n\nMaloy, Capt. was ordered in 1637, with Allyn and Ward, to go to Agawam and treat(trade?) with the Indians for their tribute to defray the expense of the wars, of one fathom of wampum a man, and a fathom and a quarter, for the Wawattock Indians.\n\nMarkham, James Windsordied in 1698wife, Elizabeth. He left a large estate to his wifeprobably had no children.\n\nMarsh, John who moved from Hartford to Litchfieldwas a descendant of John, of Hartford, (in No. 2.)\n\nMarshall, Samuel Windsor, married Mary Wilton in 1652, and had Samuel, Thomas, diedDaniel, Thomas, Mary, Elizabeth, John, and one other daughter. Capt. Samuel, of Windsor, (in No. 2,) was killed in battle by the Indians in '75. It was his fifth time in service, under Major Treat. He was a brave officer. Estate £902. (See S. Marshall in No. 2.)\n\nMaskell, Thomas Windsor, married Betsey Parsons in 1660. Children, Betsey, Thomas, Abigail, Thomas, John, Elizabeth and others.\n\nMason, Edward Wethersfield, 1639, (in No. 2,) died in 1640, and left an estate of £121.\n\nMather, Richard was one of the four early settlers of the town of Lyme before 1666.\n\nMaudsley, John Windsor, married Mary Newbury in 1664. Benjamin, born in '66, Margaret in '67, Joseph in '70, and Susannah in '75. A respectable family. He set out the estate of James Enoe to his children in '82.\n\nMay, Nicholas Windsordied in 1664. Estate £4.\n\nMarwine or Merwine, Miles in 1684. His children were, Elizabeth, John, Samuel, Abigail and Miles.\n\nMiner, John son of Thomas, of New London. In 1654, I find the following upon the colony record: \"Whereas, notwithstanding former provision made for the conveyance of the knowledge of God to the Natives amongst us, little hath hitherto been attended, through want of an able interpreter;this Court being earnestly desirous to promote and further what lies in them, a work of that nature, wherein the glory of God and the everlasting welfare of those poor, lost, naked sons of Adam is so deeply concerneddo order, that Thomas Miner, of Pequot, (New London) shall be wrote unto from this Court, and desired that he would forthwith send his son John to Hartford, where this Court will provide for his maintenance and schooling, to the end he may be for the present, assistant to such Elder, Elders or others, as this Court shall appoint to interpret the things of God to them as he shall be directed, and in the meantime, fit himself to be instrumental that way, as God shall fit and incline him thereunto for the future.\" This was the first action in the Missionary cause in Connecticut. Nothing previous to this date, appears from the record, to have been done preparatory to christianizing the Indians, except to suffer them, in small numbers, to attend their meetings for worship.\n\nMitchell, Nathan who moved from Stratford or Stamford to Litchfield, is supposed a descendant of Matthew, (in No. 2,) who moved to Stamford from Wethersfield, in the early settlement of Stamford.John, of Hartford, died in 1683. His children were, Mary, aged 28, John 25, Sarah 21, Margaret 19, Mabel 17, and Miriam 15. Sarah, of Wethersfield, died in '84, and left brothers and sisters, viz. John, Mary, Margaret, Mabel and Miriam, and £20 estate.\n\nMix, Rev. Stephen, and John Woodward were appointed scribes for the Convention that formed the Saybrook Platform in 1708. The name of Mix is yet at New Haven.\n\nMoore, Deac. John had a daughter born in Windsor, 1643, also John, in '45. Deac. Moore died in '77. His son John married Hannah Foote in '64and had John, Thomas, Samuel, Nathaniel, Edward, and twins in '74, Josias and Joseph.\n\nMorton, Samuel Hoccanumdied in 1668. Estate £4.\n\nMudge, Francis The town of Hartford, by their committee, sequestered to the use of said Mudge, six acres of land, if the town admitted him as an inhabitant, 1640.\n\nNash, Joseph Hartforddied in 16778--wife, Margaret. Sarah was his only child unmarried. Capt. John, of New Haven, was his eldest brother. He had no sons, and his other daughters were married at his decease. He left a good estate.\n\nNewbury, Thomas Windsordied in 1685. Children, Hannah 8, Thomas 6, Joseph 4, and Benjamin one year old. He married Ann Ford in 1676. Benjamin, of Windsor, married Mary Allyn in '46, and had nine children.\n\nNewel, Daniel with Samuel Hall, Ebenezer Smith, John Gaines, Richard Goodale, Samuel Eggleston, John Ranny, Thomas Buck, Thomas Wright, Nathaniel and Joseph White, Jonathan Judd, and others, were the first church member: At Chatham. The church was organized there in 1721; Daniel Shepard chosen Deacon; and the first meeting house erected there, 26 by 40 feet, in 1718. Thomas, of Farmington, died in 1689. His children were, John, 42 years old, Thomas 39, Samuel 28, Rebecca Woodford 46, Mary Bascomb 44, Hester Strong 37, Sarah Smith 34, Hannah North 31John Stanley and Thomas -North married two of his daughters. He was an early settler of Farmington. Joseph, of Farmington, died in 1689was a brother of John; and had five sisters, viz. Rebecca, Mary, Sarah, Esther and Hannah; he was also a brother of Thomas and Samuel.-To Esther Woodford he gave a share of his estatewas a brother-in-law to John Stanley, who had a son Samuel. He died unmarried. The name yet continues within the bounds of what was then Farmington.\n\nNichols, Siborn of Witham in the county of Essex, England, Gentlemanin 1664 received a deed, executed in London, of a large quantity of land located in Hartford, Conn., on both sides of Connecticut river, from William Whiting, a merchant then in London, and a son of William Whiting then deceased, of Hartford, which had fallen to him at his father's decease, for which Mr. Nichols paid him £320 sterling. It is doubtful whether the above Siborn ever came to this country. Cyprian Nichols the elder appears to have been the son of Siborn, of Witham, particularly from the fact that the lands deeded by Mr. Whiting in London, went into the possession of Cyprian, of Hartford, yet the lands were never deeded by Siborn to Cyprian, as appears of record. Cyprian was occasionally called Siborn, but generally Cyprian. There were five Cyprian Nichols in this family in succession. Cyprian, sen'r., died at Hartford, a gentleman of great wealth; Cyprian, jr., died in 1745left his widow, Agnes; Lieut. James and William were also sons of Cyprian, sen'r. In 1711 land was set out on execution by S. Webster, sheriff, to Cyprian Nichols. Capt. Cyprian, in 1720, had daughters, Mary Turner and Sarah Webster, wife of William Webster; he also had a grandson Cyprian, and a grandson William Davenport, to whom he gave There was a Cyprian Nichols as late as 1750, and the name is yet in the same family in Hartford at this time. Siborn was a gentleman of reputation and wealth in England, and in 1664 had the title of gentleman and Mr. Cyprian, of Hartford, married Mary Spencer, daughter of Samuel Spencer, May, 1705. In the settlement of estates, the name of Siborn Nichols has appeared, which is supposed to have been used for Cyprian. No person by the name of Siborn Nichols died in the Probate District of Hartford for the first 75 years of the settlement of the colony. It appears there was either a young man by the name of Siborn after the death of Siborn, of Witham, or Cyprian was occasionally called Siborn. Adam Nichols of 1681, appears to have been a different familyhe had a daughter Hester Ellishe also had a son and daughter at Haddam. Isaac and Caleb Nichols were located at Stratford as early as 1650.\n\nNorth, John died in 1690-1. Children, Thomas, Joseph, Mary and Sarah Woodruff.\n\nNorthum, John Colchesterdied in 1732wife, Hannah. He had a son John, and nine daughters; and a brother-in-law, Nathaniel Pomeroy.\n\nNorthend, John an original settler and proprietor of Stamford in 1641probably the same to whom Mr. Towsey gave 40 shillings in his will.\n\nNoyes, John Stonington, 1713.\n\nOlmsted, John was settled at Hartford, as early as 1639he probably was the same John Holmsted that afterwards located at Norwick, in 1660. He was a kinsman of the Richard Olmsted family of Norwalk, who went there from Hartford.\n\nOsborn, John Windsor, married Ann Olday in 1645, and had John, Nathaniel, Samuel, Mary, Hannah, Samuel, Isaac, Sarah, and two other daughters.\n\nOuld, Robert Windsor, married Susannah Sanford, and had Robert in 1670, and Jonathan in '72.\n\nPalmer, Timothy Windsor, married Hannah Buell in 1663, and had Timothy, Hannah, Mary, Sarah, died, John, Sarah, Samuel and Martha.\n\nParsons, Rev. Joseph In 1700 a church was formed at Lebanon, and the same year Mr. Parsons was ordained there. Several persons settled there from Windsor, Stratford, &c. Thomas, married Lydia Brown, of Windsor, in 1641, and had Betsey, Thomas, died, Abigail, John, Mary, Ebenezer, Samuel, and Joseph. Thomas died in 1680. Isaac, son of John and Phillis, born is 1699, Jacob in 1701, Moses in 1702, Phillis in 1704, Aaron in 1706, and Ruth in 1711. Ebenezer, of Windsor, had a daughter Abigail, born in 1675, Ebenezer in 1677, John in 1678. John Parsons married Phillis Hills in 1698.\n\nParent, John Haddamdied in 1686. Children, Mary and Elizabethno sons.\n\nPayne, Widow Hannah Wethersfielddied in 1682, and left chil dren, Hannah, 20 years of age, and Thomas 9. John, of Middletown, died in '81. His children were, Job, 4 years old, Latierce 3, and Abigail 1. Richard Hall, Samuel Hubbard and John Savidge were appraisers.\n\nPeacock, John settled at Stratford before 1650.\n\nPease, John It has generally been supposed by the Pease family, that the first of the name settled at Enfield about 1683; yet Miss Caulkins, in her History of Norwich, has reported John Pease as located at Norwich at a much earlier period, with his name and lot registered in the Town Plat, as a proprietor in the N. W. extremity of the settlement, with John Tracy, John Baldwin, Jonathan Royce, Robert Allyn, Francis Griswold, Nehemiah Smith and Thomas Howard. John Calkins, Hugh Calkins, Ensign William Backus, Richard Egerton, Thomas Post and John Gager. Upon the opposite side of the street she locates, with no river land attached to their homelots, Samuel and William Hide; upon the river, Morgan Bowers, Robert Wade, John Birchard, John Post, Thomas Bingham and Thomas Waterman; around the Plain, Gen. Mason and Rev. James Fitch. After which she gives with like particularity the locations of Lieut. Thomas Tracy, John Bradford, C. Huntington, Thomas Adgate, John Holmsted (or Olmsted,) Stephen Backus, Thomas Bliss and John Renolds. T. Leffingwell, J. Reed, R. Wallis and Richard Hendys, as the first planters of Norwich. Mr. Pease must have been located in Norwich as early as 1660, as a town book was then commenced, and from that it appears the contract which had been made with John Elderkin in '54, to erect a corn-mill for the town of Mohegan, was now understood to be erected either \"on the land of John Pease, or -at Norman's Acre, \"before Nov. '61. Mr. Pease was afterwards found at New London. Farmer says, John Pease was a member and Captain of the Ar. Co. in '61. He might have returned to the Plymouth Colony, and from thence removed to Enfield, or he might have removed direct from Norwich or New London to Enfield in '83. As the name and age of the man appears to be the same as that of John Pease who had resided at Salem, there is little doubt he was the same man. He was a good surveyor and a gentleman of education.\n\n[This note from David-Bryden Pease:\n\nIn reference to John Pease  there were two John Pease:\n\n1st - John Pease Jr. who live in Norwich, CT, son of John Pease (who had originally purchase land/claim in Moheyan (Norwich), New London CT ) & Lucy Weston from Marthas Vineyard, MA\n\nJohn Pease Jr was born in Salem, MA in 1639, died in Norwich, CT in 1711, he moved from Marthas Vineyard to Norwich, CT\n\n2nd  John Pease son of Robert Pease (brother of John Pease of Marthas Vineyard) lived in Enfield and died there. He also had a son named John Pease.]\n\nPeck, Paul The name of Paul in the Peck family continued over 100 yearsnamed after Deac. Paul, of Hartford, in 1639. Paul, son of Paul, a great grandson of Deac. Paul, born in 1702, Elisha in 1704, Thomas in 1709, and Cornelius in 1711. Paul Peck married Loah Morry in 1701. Samuel married Abigail Collier, daughter of Joseph, in 1701. Joseph Hopkins married Hannah Peck, daughter of Paul, in 1699. John and Paul, jr., emigrated to Litchfield after 1717.\n\nPerry, Richard Fairfield, with the following names are found upon the record of Fairfield, as first settlers, viz. Hon. Nathan Gold, Nathaniel Baldwin, John Tornson, George Starkey, Henry Rowland, Daniel Frost, Robert Lockwood and John Gray, as early as 1641. Fairfield had settlers as early as 1639-40. John Barlow, Samuel Drake, Tho. Sherwood, Richard Bowles, Thomas Dunn and Thomas Sherwington, also in 1650-1. There are no dates of 1650. In 1654, Edward Adams, Hon. Roger Ludlow, John Banks, Andrew Ward, Richard Lyon, Thomas Wheeler, John Nichols, Isaac Nichols, John Cable, Thomas Morehouse and Richard Osborn, (and William Hill and Robert Turney in 1654); also in 1654, Philip Pinkney, Thomas Barlow, George Goodwin, Thomas Bearsley; in 1657, Henry Lyon. Many names cannot be decyphered on the first record at Fairfield. The names of Rowland, Starkey, Sherwood, Dunn, Sherwington, Lyon, Morehouse, Turney and Pinkney were peculiarly Fairfield county names, none of which I recollect to have found among the first settlers of the old towns of Hartford, Wethersfield, or Windsor. Many of the above persons emigrated from Wethersfield, and other towns on the Connecticut riverS. A. Nichols.\n\nPettibone, John Windsor, married in 1664, and had a son John, born in '65, a daughter in '67, and Stephen in '69.\n\nPeters, Thomas at New London in 1645probably the same Rev. Thomas who came to Saybrook with Mr. Fenwick in '39. Mr. Peters aided Uncas in many respects; he performed the duty of surgeon in dressing the wounds of his warriors after his battles with the Narragansetts. In 1645 there must have been about 50 families at New London.\n\nPond, Samuel Windsor, married Sarah Ware in 1641, and had children, Isaac, Nathaniel, Sarah and Samuel.\n\nSavage, John, sen'r. settled early at Middletowndied in 1681 left his wife, Elizabeth, and children, John, 33 years old at his father's death, Elizabeth 30, Sarah 28, Mary 27, Abigail 19, William 17, Nathaniel 14, Rachel 12, and Hannah 9. He left a large landed estate to his family. He was often called upon by the town in various stations. He appears to have settled there as his first location in the colony, and was the first of the name in the colony.\n\nSage, David, sen'r. Middletowndied in 1703. Children, David, John, (two of his daughters married Bull and Johnson,) also Mercy, Jonathan, TimothyJonathan died in 1713; David, jr. died in 1712 or '13. His mother resided at Middletown, and owned land there. He left an estate of £753. Thomas Stedman, of Wethersfield, married a daughter of David, jr. Children of David, jr., deceased, Mary and Elizabethhe had no sons.\n\nStrong, Rev. Nathan His father early moved from Windsor to Woodbury, where the Rev. Nathan was born in 1716. He first learned the trade of a house joiner, but afterwards graduated at Yale College in 1742, immediately after he studied theology with the Rev. Mr. Graham, of Southbury, who preached his ordination sermon. He was ordained in Coventry in 1745, immediately after the church was formed there. He died in 1795, in the 51st year of his ministry. He married the daughter of the Rev. Mr. Meacham, and a grand daughter of the Rev. John Williams, of Deerfield, who was taken captive by the Indians. Some of the first settlers of Coventry under Mr. Strong, were, Nathaniel Kingsbury, John Fowler, Noah and Benjamin Carpenter, Joseph Long, Amos Richardson, Aaron Strong, Ebenezer Brown, John Hackings, John Craw or Crow, Timothy Ladd, Jonathan Shepard, Elijah Hammond, James Hotchkins, and others. The father of Rev. Nathan who moved to Woodbury, was the 14th child in his father's family. Rev. Nathan, of Coventry, was the father of Rev. Drs. Nathan, of Hartford, and Joseph, of Norwich. There are yet at Woodbury several families by the name of Strong, all descendants of John, of Windsor. After 1717, Eleazer and Supply Strong moved from Windsor to Litchfield. Rev. Nathan was a lineal descendant of John, of Windsor, who moved to Northampton.\n\nA CATALOGUE OF THE FAMILIES WHO EMIGRATED TO MASSACHUSETTS, IN 1659, FROM CONNECTICUT.\n\n\"At a meeting at Goodman Ward's house in Hartford, April 18, 1659, the company there met, engaged themselves, under their own hands, or by their deputies, whom they had chosen, to remove themselves and their families out of the jurisdiction of Connecticut, into the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, as may appear in a paper dated the day and year above said. The names of the engagers are these: John Webster, William Goodwin, John Crow, Nathaniel Ward, John White, John Barnard, Andrew Bacon, William Lewis, William Westwood, Richard Goodman, John Arnold, William Patrigg, Gregory Wilterton, Thomas Standley, Samuel Porter, Richard Church, Ozias Goodwin, Francis Barnard, James Ensign, George Steele, John Marsh, Robert Webster, William Lewis, jr., Nathaniel Standley, Samuel Church, William Markum, Samuel Moody, Zechariah Field, Wid. Westly, Wid. Watson, Andrew Warner, Mr. John Russell, jr., Nathaniel Dickinson, Samuel Smith, Thomas Coleman, Mr. John Russel, sen'r., John Dickinson, Philip Smith, John Coleman, Thomas Wells, James Northam, Samuel Gardner, Thomas Edwards, John Hubbard, Thomas Dickinson, Robert Boltwood, Samuel Smith, jr., William Gull, Luke Hitchcock, Richard Montague, John Latimer, Peter Tilton, John Watson, Richard Billing, Benjamin Harbert, Edward Benton, John Catling, Mr. (Samuel) Hooker, Capt. Cullick, not fully engag Daniel Warner.\" Of the 60 names on the foregoing list, about one-fourth part never removed to Hadley, and several that did remove returned to Connecticut again some years after. The names of a number that did remove are not on this list. ADVERTISEMENT. THE three Numbers, of which this is the last, is designed to give the information to those who possess any curiosity to learn the first of the name who came into the Colony of Connecticut. When it is known who the first progenitor was, there is little difficulty in tracing their ancestry. With most men there exists an anxiety to learn something of those of the same blood who had preceded them, and had aided in building up, and were the pioneers of this great and mighty republic, which has now become one of the three most powerful governments of the world. There will be a satisfaction in recognizing our first ancestorin learning from whence he camewhere he was first located, and his condition and character in life, in this country. If he was poor and homely, so much the more are you indebted to him, for abandoning the land of his nativity, his friends, and all that he held dear, (except his religion) to come to this gloomy wilderness, inhabited only- by wild beasts and savage men, where for many years their lives were never safe even with their arms in their hands, and the sweet sleep they had enjoyed in childhood had become a stranger to their eyelids. It will not be forgotten that all these dangers were suffered for you. Since my attention has been particularly called to this subject, I have often been astonished to find so many of the intelligent inhabitants of the State so perfectly destitute of information of their genealogy; indeed, I conversed with one gentleman, of whom I enquired the name of his great grand father and where he residedhe looked at me with a sort of surprise, and remarked, \"Really, Sir, I never thought I had any ancestor previous to my grand father,\" and was unable to even give the name or place of residence of his grand father. Thought I, a poor reward this for the hardships of his ancestorand my informant was a gentleman of 80,000. Nothing is required to find much of every man's ancestry, but patience, perseverance and industry in collecting them from the early records and papers which have been preserved for 200 years. My object at first was to publish only a list of the names of the Puritans who came to Connecticut during the first 30 years, from 1635 to 1665, while Connecticut stood alone, before the Union of the New Haven Colony with Connecticut; but believing it would be more interesting by adding little historical scraps to names, and giving short biographical sketches of persons, I have done so with as much accuracy as possible. To those who are familiar with the labor of such a work, I need not say, that much time has been bestowed upon these three small pamphlets, as well as considerable money advanced in so imperfectly giving it to the public. Errors there will be, but when it is considered that the numerous facts here collected are drawn from the half obliterated records, imperfectly kept 200 years since, depending mostly- upon the colony record, I trust that such errors will be excused until those who find them shall attempt to better the work by their own personal exertions. No towns are included in this compilation, but such as were at some time before 1665 within the jurisdiction of Connecticut. There probably at no period of time was ever as many respectable and educated men emigrated from any country, as from England, to Virginia, Massachusetts and Connecticut from 1635 to 1665men who were neither inferior to their successors in fervent piety, patriotism, learning, or in sterling integrity. There were, it is true, many needy and avaricious adventurers who quit their country, hoping to better their condition in life; and the fate of time and accident, by the equal laws of our country, has placed the successors of some of the most wealthy of the original pioneers, in humble poverty, while the successors of the most humble emigrants are now found surrounded with every comfort and in the highest walks of life. This is the fate of idleness on the one hand, and persevering industry on the other, in most cases. Where the names of families are mentioned, they may perhaps differ from some ancient family records, as some of them are taken from town books, while others are taken from the records of Probatethe former contains all the births, while the Probate record mentions only such as were living at the decease and distribution of the estate of the head of the family. Dates in the ancient records of the colony are difficult to procure with accuracy, as wills often are without date, as are inventories of estates. Not only so, some may be misled in supposing dates incorrect, from the fact, that the first settlers commenced the year on the 25th day of March, instead of the first day of January, and the records for many years are so dated, and time thus divided. Only 500 copies have been printed in this edition. The language used in describing the facts attached to names, is usually the language, if not the words of the record.\n\nERRATA\n\nFor \"Hon. Henry Wolcott, the first of Windsor,\" on page 108, 12th line from bottom, read Gor'rs. Winthrop, Welles and Webster. On page 94, the 5th line from bottom, read Doct. Charles P., instead of H. Welles. The Errata for the Three Numbers will be published in the next Number.\n\nNo. IV.\n\nIf an apology is required for publishing, at my own expense, a Fourth Number, after having remarked in No. 3, that it was the last to be published, I have only to say that there were several names left on hand which had cost considerable labor, and the 3d No. had cost all for which the numbers sold, and could be made no larger without a lossI have, therefore, rather than to lose the labor, ventured again to trespass upon the public, by publishing a Fourth Number.\n\nThe following is a copy of the officers of the first organized General Court of Connecticut, under the compact of 1638, viz:Record. \"April, 1639.
