Dates : 1753 - 1791 Extent : 4 boxes (2 linear feet) Abstract : Collection consists of personal and business correspondence; receipts, bills and accounts. Location: Ms Trumj1778 Language: English\n\nBiographical Sketch\n\nJoseph Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut on March 11, 1737, the eldest son of Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. and Faith (Robinson) Trumbull. Following his father's footsteps, Joseph Jr. spent his undergraduate years at Harvard, graduating in 1756. After Harvard he spent eleven years working with his father in trade.\n\nIn 1766, the Trumbull business was suffering and Joseph concluded his affairs as best he could and moved to Norwich, where he restricted his trade to chandlery and to the importation of tea, sugar, cotton, rum, and indigo.\n\nIn October 1767, his political career began when he was sent to Connecticut's General Assembly. His first act of public service, however, had been in 1763 when he had served as a captain in the Twelfth Connecticut.\n\nTrumbull spent a brief time around 1769 practicing law. In 1770 the colony of Connecticut appointed him to collect the papers of former governors and to sort, arrange, and file them chronologically. The papers were then deposited in the Office of the Secretary. His political career moved forward yet again in 1773 when the General Assembly appointed him to its Committee of Correspondence and Enquiry. The following year, the towns of Norwich and Groton appointed him to their Committees of Correspondence. The peak of his prestige came on July 19, 1775, when he was appointed to be the first Commissary-General of Stores and Provisions for the army of the United Colonies. But he was given little in the way of funds to feed the army and in order to help the Arnold Expedition; he borrowed seven hundred pounds from Nathaniel Tracy. In December 1775 a Court of Enquiry appointed by George Washington criticized the prices he fixed for provisions, but acquitted him of fraud.\n\nIn March 1777, Joseph Trumbull married Amelia Dyer, daughter of Eliphalet Dyer, in Windham, Connecticut. In November of that year, he accepted a Congressional appointment to the Board of War, but he had to resign his post in April 1778 due to ill health. A few months later, on July 23, 1778, he died insolvent and without children at his family home in Lebanon, Connecticut. His inscription read, \"Full soon may this person, his virtue, and even his extensive Benevolence be forgotton.\" On January 5, 1785, his widow married Colonel Hezekiah Wyllys.\n\nReturn to the Table of Contents\n\nScope and Content\n\nCollection consists largely of correspondence, letters, and supporting material written in both personal and official roles.
