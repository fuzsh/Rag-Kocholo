        "text": "(REVEREND) JAMES FITCH (1622  1702)  IMMIGRANT\n\nOn 24 December 1622 JAMES FITCH was born in Bocking, Essex, England. JAMES parents are Thomas Fitch and Anne Reeve.\n\n1639: IMMIGRATION TO AMERICA\n\nIn 1639 JAMES had immigrated to America.\n\nPREPARING FOR THE MINISTRY\n\nJAMES meets and becomes a student of Thomas Hooker in Hartford, Connecticut. Hooker was a theorist and lectured extensively on the church and ministry. JAMES stayed in Hartford, [Connecticut] for seven years learning from both Hooker, the Pastor, and Samuel Stone the teacher what he needed to learn from Hooker were such particular puritan doctrine as it was interpreted in New England, together the congregation of the elect, the role and the structure of a proper sermon for that Hooker was probably better prepared than almost any teacher in England, old or new.\n\n1646: ORDINATION\n\nIn 1646  probably early in the summer - JAMES was ordained as Pastor at Saybrook, Connecticut.\n\nJAMES wrote several important documents which were circulated widely. He struggled to clarify several important points of puritan doctrine, 1) he struggled to find grounds for proving the necessity of works without curtailing the absolute freedom of God to chose and reject regardless of mans achievement, 2) he wanted to resolve the question of individual assurance, that is how a man might reach some working assurance that he was of the regenerate even though pure knowledge was an inscrutable secret open to God himself, and 3) he wanted to justify Gods ways in concepts meaningful to the human intellect to bring him into line, so to speak, with the more rationale laws of ethics.\n\nJAMES lived near the new meeting house on a two acre lot with a house, a barn and an orchard.\n\n1647: EPIDEMICAL SICKNESS\n\nIn the early summer of 1647 an epidemical sickness swept through parts of New England. Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts reported that it seized the victims like a cold and light fever with it. On 7 July JAMES mentor, the Reverend Thomas Hooker, died at Hartford, Connecticut.\n\n1647: JAMES MEETS ABIGAIL\n\nSome time in 1647 the 25 year old minister met a young woman at about his own age named Abigail Whitfield.\n\nWhen JAMES came to Saybrook, Connecticut, one of those who was said to have participated in his ordination and installation was Reverend Henry Whitefield.\n\n1648: CONFIRMATION AND DISCOVERY OF WITCHCRAFT PUBLISHED\n\n1648: MARRIAGE OF JAMES AND ABIGAIL WHITFIELD\n\nOn 18 October 1648 JAMES (age 26) married Abigail Whitfield in Guilford, New Haven, Connecticut. JAMES and Abigail had at least six children:\n\n1649: MARYLAND PASSES ACT OF TOLERATION\n\nJAMES (MAJOR) (b. 2 August 1649)\n\nAbigail (b. 5 August 1650)\n\n1652: MAINE JOINED TO MASSACHUSETTS BAY COLONY\n\n1652: RHODE ISLAND FIRST COLONY TO ABOLISH SLAVERY\n\nElizabeth (b. 2 January 1652)\n\n1653: ENGLISH QUAKER JAMES NAYLOR SEEN BY SOME AS NEW MESSIAH\n\nHannah (b. 17 December 1653)\n\nSamuel (b. 16 April 1655)\n\n1656: LIFE IN CONNECTICUT\n\nDuring his life in America, JAMES accumulated large tracts of land, some in distributions of the town, some given to him by generous Mohegans, and others granted by a grateful legislature.\n\nHe kept this land and it appears to have been a good deal less than 200 or 300 acres for nineteen years-long after he moved to Norwich-when he sold it at the time of King Philips War.\n\n1658: CROMWELL DIES, IS SUCCEEDED AS LORD PROTECTOR BY SON RICHARD\n\nDorothy (b. 5 April 1658)\n\n1659: RICHARD CROMWELL ABDICATES\n\n1659: MASSACHUSETTS HANGS TWO QUAKERS ON BOSTON COMMON\n\n1659: DEATH OF ABIGAIL\n\nOn 9 September 1659 Abigail died in Norwich, New London County, Connecticut.\n\n1664: MARRIAGE OF JAMES AND PRISCILLA MASON\n\nOn 2 October 1664 JAMES married Priscilla Mason  place unknown. JAMES and Priscilla had at least five children:\n\nJohn (b. January 1667)\n\nJeremiah (b. 10 December 1670)\n\nKING PHILIPS WAR 1675-1676\n\nAnn (b. April 1675)\n\nWe tend to think of JAMES only as a minister, but the fact is that he had farms, he kept live stock - necessitated by the meager earnings as a minister.\n\nNathaniel (b. October 1679)\n\nJoseph (b. November 1681)\n\nSamuel Eliot Morrison said, Puritanism did not hold to asceticism or celibacy. The clergy married young and often 'increase and multiply, the oldest of Gods commandments, was one that the puritans particularly enjoyed obeyingor some of us would not be here. JAMES must have taken this admonition to heart; he married twice and fathered fourteen surviving children.\n\n1687: JAMES II ISSUES DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE FOR LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE\n\nKING WILLIAMS WAR 1689-1697\n\nFRENCH & INDIAN WARS 1689-1763\n\n1694: PALSY\n\nSometime in late 1694, JAMES suffered what we would call a stroke or, in those days a stroke of the palsy. It probably affected his speech, making it difficult to serve as minister.\n\n1695: ENGLAND ENDS PRESS CENSORSHIP\n\n1701: LEBANON, CONNECTICUT\n\nIn 1701 JAMES retired to Lebanon, Connecticut for the rest of his life. When JAMES moved to Lebanon, he and his son James sold the home lot in Norwich, [New London County], Connecticut.\n\n1702: WILLIAM III DIES AND IS SUCCEEDED BY QUEEN ANNE\n\n1702: COTTON MATHER PUBLISHES MAGNALIA CHRISI AMERICANA\n\n1702: QUEEN ANNES WAR BEGINS\n\n1702: DEATH OF JAMES\n\nOn 18 November 1702 JAMES (age 80) died in Lebanon, New London County, Connecticut. He is buried in the old Lebanon cemetery also called the Trumbull cemetery east of the village center. It is on a little knoll close to the Susquetonscut brook. The grave stone is quite large, probably to accommodate the lengthy epitaph. At the top is a sole effigy, a face with wings, symbolizing the immortal sole. Under the spreading wings is the legend remember eternity. Below is a long inscription in Latin reportedly written by JAMES son Jabez. The inscription has been translated as, This tomb are deposited the remains of the truly reverent Mr. James Fitch born at Bocking in the county of Essex, England December 24, 1622. Who after he had been well instructed in the learned languages, came to New England at the age of 16 and passed several years under the instruction of those eminent divines, Mr. Hooker and Mr. Stone. Afterward he discharged the pastoral office at Saybrook for fourteen years, from wence, with the greater part of his arc, he removed to Norwich, and there spent the succeeding years of his life, engaged in the work of the gospel, till age and infirmity obliged him to withdraw from public labor. At length he retired to his children at Lebanon, when scarcely half a year had past, when he fell asleep in Jesus, November 18 1702, in the 80th year of his age. He was a man of penetration of mind, solidity of judgment, of [charity,] devotion to the sacred duties of his office, and entire holiness of life, and also for skill and energy for preaching, inferior to none.\n\n***\n\nNotes On (Reverend) James Fitch\n\nInformation is based on the following sources:\n\nRootsweb.com: Contact: Marvin Dellinger [email protected] http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=:1703001&id=178353930 SEE WEB SITE SOURCE INDEX.\n\nBIRTH DATE\n\nBIRTH PLACE\n\nPARENTS\n\nSPOUSE\n\nMARRIAGE DATE\n\nCHILDREN (BIRTH DATE & PLACE)\n\nDEATH DATE\n\nDEATH PLACE\n\nRootsweb.com: Contact: Gordon Richard A.

Morant's 'History of County Essex, England,' says that 'Robert Gernon or de Gernon came from France along with William the Conqueror and that he was a relative of the Conqueror and of the House of Bologne. One of his sons took the name of de Montfitchet, or de Montifiquet - the name is written these three ways in the Doomsday Book.\n\nMANOR OF WRAYSBURY & CASTLE AT STANSTEAD-MONTFITCHET IN ESSEX\n\nIn Normandy near Bayeaux is a village, Montfiquet, and it is a section from whence came some of the Conqueror's most illustrious followers.' William the Conqueror gave the manor of Wraysbury as a special donation to his blood relative, Robert de Gernon, who held it as part of his barony of which the head was at Stanstead-Montfitchet in Essex. Here he built a castle on a hill artificially raised for the foundation; this castle he presented to his youngest son. William de Gernon, who in accordance with the custom of the time, dropped the patronymic of de Gernon and assumed the appellative, 'Montfitchet. (Gylls 'History of Wraysbury.') William de Gernon who assumed the appellative, de Montfitchet, married Margaret, daughter of Gilbert, second Lord of Clare, and had a son, Gilbert de Monfitchet, who had a son, Richard de Montfitchet.\n\n1225: BARON AT RUNNYMEDE & MAGNA CHARTA\n\nRichard de Montfitchet was one of the Barons at Runnymede A.D. 1225 who wrested the Magna Charta from King John and was one of the 25 barons appointed to rule the Realm.\n\n1236: JUSTICE OF THE ROYAL FOREST IN ESSEX\n\nIn 1236 he was made Justice of the Royal Forest in Essex.\n\n1242: HIGH SHERIFF OF ESSEX AND HERTFORDSHIRE & GOVERNOR OF HERTFORD CASTLE\n\nIn 1242, High Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire and Governor of Hertford Castle.\n\nNAME CHANGE\n\nHis third son was Roger de Montfitchet of Wraysbury, who had a son, John de Montfitchet, who tired of the prefix, 'Mont,' dropped it and spelled his name, John Fitche, leaving off the 't.' He was granted Armorial bearings in the year 1263, and was of 'Fitch Castle in the North,' 1294. (unpublished Fitch Genealogy, New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, NYC)\n\nCOAT OF ARMS\n\nMembers of the Fitch family bore a coat of arms through the centuries as substantiated by the ancient records of the College of Arms, London, and the British Museum.\n\nThe very ancient Fitch Coat of Arms was:\n\nGold a roundle between three crosslets fitched sable, which seems to indicate the possibility that the arms were granted for bravery in the Crusades.\n\nThe sixteenth century Fitch coat of arms was:\n\nVert a chevron between three leopard's faces gold; Crest - A leopard's face gold in his mouth a sword proper the hilt gules; Motto - Promptus et Certus (In French Prompte et Certe), used by descendants of Thomas Fitch I of Norwalk, CT, Spes Juvat, by descendants of Rev. James Fitch I of Norwich, CT and Virtus Omnia Vincit by descendants of Samuel Fitch I of Hartford, CT.\n\nCLAIM TO DESCENDANTS\n\nThe claim of the descendants of Thomas Fitch, Esq., of Bocking, Co Essex, England, father of the four Fitch brothers who settled in CT, to the use of both the ancient and sixteenth century Fitch arms is first, through long use by our ancestors, as shown by records of the Heralds' College in London, and secondly, by pedigree certified by the College of Arms. The Fitch family is one of seventy-two American families included in the New England Historic Genealogical Society's Roll of Arms.\n\nRELATION TO LORD TENNYSON\n\nLord Tennyson was a descendant of the Fitch family, and was very proud of his Fitch ancestry. His A Dream of Fair Women was illustrated with a part of Fitch Castle in the North. His mother was Elizabeth Fitch, a direct descendant of Fitch Castle in 1294. (Rhoades, p 37)\n\nThomas Fitchs daughter Elizabeth married George Clayton Tennyson and had son, poet Lord Alfred Tennyson. Tennyson was born on the fifth of August in 1809 and grew up in a small village of Somersby, Lincolnshire. Throughout his childhood his father, George Clayton Tennyson, suffered from deteriorating mental health, epileptic fits, and alcoholism. Tennyson's father went to Cambridge to study for the church, eventually becoming responsible for the Somersby Rectory. Alfred and his siblings were known to play in a brook at the bottom of the Rectory garden, and it was the scene of castle-building and mock-tournaments.\n\nElizabeth Fytche Tennyson, Alfred's mother, loved poetry and often read aloud to her children James Beattie's Minstrel, James Thomson's The Seasons, or the work of Felicia Hemans. Alfred memorized much seventeenth- and eighteenth-century poetry, including the works of Milton, William Collins, and Thomson, from which he derived many of his early techniques in writing loco-descriptive poetry. Elizabeth encouraged Alfred to write, while George viewed creative writing as a needless diversion from reading the classics. Alfred had a knack for story-telling. His sister Cecilia recalls that friends and family would listen open-eared and open-mouthed to legends of knights and heroes (qtd. in Ormond 8). Before the age of fourteen, Alfred had composed a six thousand line epic in the style of Walter Scott's Marmion and at least one blank verse drama entitled The Devil and the Lady.\n\nRootsweb.com: Contact: Brett D.
