The 'Home Alone' star passed away last month in his hotel room in Palo Alto, California.

He was found by the maid service, according to a source close to the family, and when paramedics arrived, John, 72 was pronounced dead at the scene.

And now he has been laid to rest in a plot at the Lady Of Hope Church in Massachusetts, beside his son Max, 22, who died following an overdose in December 2016.

John's former wife Lana Pritchard, told RadarOnline.com: "John was laid to rest next to Max which was a sweet gesture. The funeral was arranged by his sister, Cordis, and only a very few family were in attendance.

"I co-operated with the family the best I could after his sudden death but we are totally in the dark about any will and testament John may have had.

"I'm sad because I would have liked to have paid my respects as I was very close to him right up until he died although there could be a service to commemorate him by his friends in Los Angeles later this month."

John's cause is death is said to be unclear but police aren't treating it as suspicious.

A representative for the late actor previously confirmed he was staying in the hotel to recover after undergoing "minor back surgery" at Stanford Medical Centre earlier in the week.
