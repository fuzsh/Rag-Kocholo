        "text": "John Heard, best known for playing Macaulay Culkin’s dad, Peter McCallister, in the Home Alone franchise, died suddenly on July 21st.\n\nHeard, who was 72, passed away 6-months after his estranged son, Max dies mysteriously in his sleep aged just 22.\n\nThe Home Alone star, who was found unresponsive in a California hotel room after having minor back surgery, had distanced himself from his son, from his second marriage to ex-wife Sharon.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAccording to an obituary on Legacy.com, Max passed away ‘peacefully in his sleep’. The post however, went on to take digs at his estranged father, John, who was absent at the funeral, as he was for most of Max’s life.\n\n‘Many friends, including Annika, feel lost, as he directed them in their lives. Max was in deep grief of not having a father participating in his life. We did everything to help him, but the agony was with him’, the scathing obituary continued.\n\n‘He knew how loved he was by his mother, and sister, and his new girlfriend Maggie. We adore him, and will continue to adore him. For all of eternity.’ The obituary was apparently penned by Heard’s ex-wife, Sharon.\n\nSharon, who was married to John from 1988 to 1996, has since praised John and his career, in an interview with the New York Times following his untimely passing.\n\nSharon is quoted ‘He’d never compromise. He’d get scripts every day, but he didn’t care about money. He didn’t care about the Hollywood scene at all.’\n\nJohn was married three times, first to Margot Kidder in 1979, but the two divorced six days into the marriage. His most recent nuptial was to Lana Pritchard in 2010, they’re love affair ended after just seven months.\n\nJohn also has another son, John Mattew ‘Jack’ Heard III, with his former girlfriend, Melissa Leo.\n\nHeard had a long, eclectic career in Hollywood, with appearances in The Sopranos, The Pelican Brief and Gladiator. He will be best know for his role as Peter McCallister, a movie where a family forget about their son."
