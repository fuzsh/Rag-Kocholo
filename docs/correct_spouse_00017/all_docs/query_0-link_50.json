        "text": "Wow that is a whole lot of crazy. I knew about Leo but not kidder.\n\nHe was a cutey in Cat People.\n\n[quoet]Heard was married for six days to actress Margot Kidder in 1979.[3] He has a son, John Matthew \"Jack\" Heard, with ex-girlfriend Melissa Leo.[4] Heard was arrested in 1991 and charged with third-degree assault for allegedly slapping Leo.[5] In 1997, he was found guilty of trespassing Leo's home in Baltimore, Maryland's Fell's Point neighborhood, but acquitted of charges of trespassing at their son's school.[6] He has two other former wives, Sharon Heard and Lana Pritchard. Sharon and Heard have two children together, son Max and a daughter named Annika.[1] Heard and Pritchard married on May 24, 2010, in Los Angeles and divorced on December 22nd 2010 after nearly 7 months of marriage.[7]\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with this guy?\n\nYikes. I didn't read all that r1. When crazy married crazy I guess.\n\nMargot Kidder still works apparently. I thought she had disappeared after that incident. (I never liked her as Lois Lane. She was too butch and not pretty enough.) Wonder how she got that part and who also was considered.\n\nMelissa is the sole survivor of this ancient thread drama.\n\nI thought Heard was hottest when he was super skinny; later, he really bulked up\n\nVery cute on the first season of Kaye and Allie:\n\nI once fired John from a play I was directing in college. He failed to show up for two weeks of rehearsals, so I replaced him with another actor. he finally showed up and acted surprised that he had been replaced. But he was a good actor. Just had a bad drinking problem."
