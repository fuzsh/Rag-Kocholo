When her car breaks down in Indiana on Christmas Eve, Dana is stranded—until she’s rescued by Charlie, a pig farmer who doesn’t identify as male or female. Although they come from different worlds, Dana is intrigued by Charlie’s sense of humor and kindness. Despite her better judgment, Dana says yes when Charlie offers a ride.\n\nBut the journey home is paved with detours.

The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can’t fix their own marriage. There’s a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can’t seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment’s only bathroom, and you’ve got the worst group of hostages in the world.\n\nEach of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.\n\nRich with Fredrik Backman’s “pitch-perfect dialogue and an unparalleled understanding of human nature” (Shelf Awareness), Anxious People is an ingeniously constructed story about the enduring power of friendship, forgiveness, and hope—the things that save us, even in the most anxious times. (Synopsis courtesy of Amazon.)\n\nIt has been a while since I last read a Fredrik Backman novel. For some reason, Bear Town and Us Against You didn't capture my interest. However, after reading Anxious People, I'm leaning toward checking out some of his books that I missed!\n\nOverall, this was a great novel. There were parts that I didn't see coming at all and I was pleasantly surprised. I liked all of the characters and the way they interacted, as well as how their stories unfolded throughout the novel. It was so clever how everything was threaded together. One of the situations reminded me of something a close friend is going through and I hope things will happen for them the way they happened in this novel.\n\nThe only thing that didn't work for me was that some phrases translated strangely and it was hard to make sense of what was being said. It didn't detract from my enjoyment, but I had to re-read some sentences more than once.\n\nI definitely recommend this novel for a cozy fall read!\n\nMovie casting suggestions (even though this story takes place in Sweden, they've moved other stories to America, so I chose accordingly...and it was still a challenge, so bear with me!):\n\nJack: David Corenswet\n\nJim: Brendan Gleeson\n\nJulia: Stefanie Martini\n\nRo: Hannah John-Kamen\n\nAnna-Lena: Joanna Cassidy\n\nRoger: Craig T.

She’ll do whatever it takes to help them heal, but she didn’t anticipate Lily’s biological father would be part of the plan. Margaret is old-fashioned, though, and she has no compunction about finding a way to reach Lily’s dad, a sperm donor. After all, he's a blood relative, and she believes family should raise family.\n\nZack Bradley doesn't know what to expect when he finds out he has a child. Sperm donors don't usually get to meet their...well, he's not sure what to call Lily yet, but he’s certain he wants to get to know her. There’s just one of problem: he’s about to move to Seattle with his wife, Jessica, who’s undergone multiple infertility treatments, desperately wants a family of her own and can’t stand the idea of Zack playing daddy to another woman’s child.\n\nTogether, they’ll all learn that the human heart is infinitely expandable and there are many different roads to family.\n\nPurchase She Gets That From Me here.\n\nPhoto by Arden Wells\n\nRobin Wells was an advertising and public relations executive before becoming a full-time writer. She always dreamed of writing novels--a dream inspired by a grandmother who told \"hot tales\" and parents who were both librarians. Her books have won the RWA Golden Heart, two National Readers' Choice Awards, the HOLT Medallion, and numerous other awards. She now lives in Texas with her husband, but will always be a Louisiana girl at heart.\n\nBunco: A Comedy About The Drama of Friendship is a new book by Robin Delnoce. It is recommended for fans of Bridesmaids, Desperate Housewives, and Bad Moms. Thanks to Book Publicity Services, we have one copy for a lucky reader!\n\nWe all have “those” friends. Maybe you’ve known them since childhood, or met in college, or while waiting for a child’s practice to end. Maybe you found yourself living on the same street. There’s no single path to friendship. Relationships don’t follow a script and neither do the lives of smart, funny, complicated suburban women.\n\nJill, Anne, Mary, and Rachel met years ago through a neighborhood group that regularly got together to play a dice game called bunco. Although players have come and gone, they continue to use bunco as an excuse to abandon their day-to-day responsibilities and enjoy food, drinks, and the company of their best friends.\n\nWhen new neighbors move in under the cover of night, the foursome sees an opportunity to expand their bunco circle. But within hours, suspicions run rampant as the odd behaviors of the newest residents are interpreted differently. Are they quirky, or kinky? Diabolical, or misunderstood? Time after time, as the truth sheds light on some secrets, more emerge. Each woman finds herself shocked by the friends she thought she knew.\n\nThrough the friendly banter, intimate confessions, and tongue-twisting insults, you may see yourself or your friends in these characters. Wipe away tears of laughter and loss as you join the four metaphorical rounds of bunco, and feel part of the conversation. Whether engaging in playful exploits, providing unconditional support, making uncomfortable sacrifices, or winding up in handcuffs again, these ladies are those rarest of friends who become true family. Of course, families don’t follow a script either, unless it is a plot-twisting, slightly off-color comedy about the drama of friendship. And bunco, sort of.\n\nRobin Delnoce has the kind of sense of humor that would crush any political aspirations. Her off-color humor amuses most but offends a few, and she has been known to issue a post-party apology or two. After twenty years of being caught in her verbal crosshairs, her husband kindly suggested she shift her energies to a more constructive outlet. How to win: Use Rafflecopter to enter the giveaway.

She's too busy as PA for famous artist Damian Banks. When she's not arranging exhibitions, she's organising his dry cleaning or dumping his never ending stream of girlfriends.\n\nBut when she strikes up an unusual friendship with her desk share buddy, she finds a confidante and a new potential love interest. Problem is, they've never actually met...\n\nWith Christmas just around the corner, can Sadie put herself first for a change and find what she's been looking for all along? (Synopsis courtesy of Goodreads)\n\nI couldn’t help but picture Lucy, Sandra Bullock’s character in Two Weeks Notice, when I see the interaction between Sadie and Damian, a man reminiscent of Hugh Grant. Sadie is Damian’s go-to for nearly everything in his life, which often gets in the way of allowing Sadie a normal existence. Where it differs though, is through the unique situations and circumstances that Sadie finds herself in with being Damian’s PA. It’s not often an assistant has to break up with her boss’s girlfriends! That right there shows the originality and outward funny that Portia MacIntosh brings to her characters and her stories.\n\nAnother awkwardly funny scenario: When Sadie brings Damian home for the holidays. That scene alone, in where he’s practically inviting himself along when he knows that Sadie has requested the time off to spend with her family, speaks volumes on the type of character that Damian is. But at the same time, it’s hard not to find him likable. Over the course of Stuck On You, we discover how the preconceived notions had for how each character presents themselves and who they truly are will change. Damian isn’t who he really is at all, and Sadie might not feel as trapped in their codependent working relationship as she thought she’d been.\n\nThe premise behind the relationship Sadie has with her desk share buddy is an interesting one. At times I feel it limits her from fully pursuing someone else or even determining the best employment for her, because she doesn’t want to let that potential relationship go. I thought it was sweet how it all plays out, and while I had a clue as to how it would go, it was still nice to see that come to fruition.\n\nThe biggest thing to learn from Stuck On You is that you never really know what to expect. Appearances aren’t everything, not really. I love how we get to discover that, too, right along with the primary characters who made this book so much fun!\n\nThanks to Rachel's Random Resources for the book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nPurchase Links:\n\nAmazon UK * Amazon US\n\nPortia MacIntosh is a bestselling romantic comedy author of 12 novels, including It's Not You, It's Them and Honeymoon For One.
