According to the Santa Clara medical examiner's office, Heard was 71 but other sources claimed he was 72.\n\nThe office of the medical examiner in the Santa Clara has confirmed his death. At this time, the cause of death is still unknown. Palo Alto police reports indicate Heard was recovering from back surgery when emergency personnel were called to the actor's hotel room.\n\nThe Palo Alto police department said, \"Our officers responded with the Fire Department to a hotel in our city on a report of a person in need of medical aid.\"\n\nHeard became famous after playing Kevin's father role in the first two parts of 'Home Alone'\n\nHeard had a very versatile career. Before entering the movies, he played a theater artist role. He got his first break in Tom Hank's \"Big\".

And he’s got, what, 12 kids or something?\" he said.\n\nHe told AV Club that some of his roles surprised him when they did not receive more attention such as in \"Cross of Fire\" (TV movies in 1989). He played the role of DC Stephenson who was a Ku Klux Klan leader in the 1920s. “The character was real, it was a true story,\" he said.\n\n'Home Alone' actor acted as a lead actor in several other Hollywood films\n\nThe comedian, Marlon Wayans, who starred with John Heard in 2004 thriller and comedy film \"White Chicks\" said he and Heard laughed a lot together, reported the Guardian.
