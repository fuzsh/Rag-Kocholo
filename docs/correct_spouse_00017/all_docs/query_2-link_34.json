Nothing screams Christmas like Home Alone's Kevin McCallister causing chaos in the halls of his parents' enormous home.\n\nViewers all over the globe couldn't help but fall in love with the Hollywood film and the loveable cast whose lives were changed forever after its release – but not always for the better. Many of the stars from the 1990 film went on to endure years of torment long after its success.\n\nREAD MORE:Celebs who've had sex in public - volcano, Royal Albert Hall and 'arrested' for beach romp\n\nREAD MORE: Cara Delevigne admits she loves having sex on planes but 'always gets caught'\n\nWhile the Hollywood classic celebrates its 33rd birthday, Daily Star has taken a deep dive inside the cursed stars who faced hardships after they were shot to fame. Let’s take a look...\n\nKevin McCallister – Macaulay Culkin\n\nArguably, the most famous victim of the Hollywood curse was the movie’s leading man, Macaulay Culkin who was launched to stardom for his role as Kevin McCallister. The young actor went on to carve out a spectacular acting career as one of the most high-profile child stars in the world.\n\nThe youngster went on to make millions from his later films including Home Alone 2, The Pagemaster and Richie Rich in the mid-90s. But his Hollywood bubble soon burst when he hit his teenage years after stepping away from Hollywood.\n\nHis personal life took a hit after he effectively “divorced” his parents in 1994 when he became embroiled in a fierce legal battle with his parents to prevent them from controlling his vast fortune. At the age of 18, Macaulay, now 43, married actress Rachel Milner.\n\nBut two years after the pair tied the knot in 1998, they decided to separate and were divorced by 2002. The actor also became embroiled in Michael Jackson’s child sex scandal but insisted he was never abused by the King of Pop.\n\nMacaulay believes his relationship with the musician was due to their shared exposure to fame at such a young age. Speaking on the Inside Of You podcast with Michael Rosenbaum, he clarified: “A lot of things were happening, big and fast with me, and I think he identified with that.”\n\nThings didn’t get much better for the star in 2004 when he found himself in trouble with the law. He was arrested on suspicion of marijuana possession and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription.\n\nPolice are believed to have found 17.3 grams of marijuana, eight Xanax pills and 16 pills containing clonazepam – an addictive sedative used to treat anxiety and seizures. The actor pleaded guilty and was handed a one-year suspended sentence. In later interviews, Culkin denied that he was ever addicted to hard drugs.\n\nHe told The Guardian in 2016: “No, I was not pounding six grand of heroin every month or whatever. The thing that bugged me was the tabloids wrapping it all in this weird guise of concern. No, you’re trying to shift papers.”\n\nMacaulay has since made quite the comeback to acting, and starred in American Horror Story: Double Feature back in 2021 and has been going from strength to strength since.\n\nFuller McCallister - Kieran Culkin\n\nOne actor fans may have missed in the star-studded cast is Macaulay’s younger brother Kieran Culkin who starred in the first two Home Alone films as Kevin’s brother, Fuller. He went on to have a successful career in films like his brother, featuring in Father of the Bride, She’s All That and Scott Pilgrim Vs The World.\n\nMost recently, the actor found a new level of stardom when he starred as Roman Roy in the hit TV show Succession. However, during his rise to fame he faced huge difficulties because of his father, who he claimed: “wasn’t a good person and... probably not a good parent.”\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Kieran explained: “I never looked at him as Dad. He didn’t really belong here, and when he was finally gone for good, it made the most sense.”\n\nHe claimed his father once disappeared for three months, leaving his mother to take care of their children before they eventually split in 1995 when Kieran was 13. The difficulties were echoed by his brother Macaulay who told Marc Maron’s WTF podcast in 2018 that their father was “physically and mentally” abusive and was “jealous” of their success.\n\nBuzz McCallister – Devin Ratray\n\nDevin Ratray played the role of Kevin’s mean older brother Buzz McCallister in the festive favourite. He went on to land a few minor roles in Little Monsters, Dennis the Menace and The Prince and Me in the mid-90s.\n\nBut things took a turn for the worst for the actor later in the year when he turned himself in to police in Oklahoma City after he allegedly attacked his girlfriend during a row in 2021. The 44-year-old was charged with domestic assault and battery by strangulation and several other offences.\n\nA warrant was issued for the former child star’s arrest after allegedly attacking the woman who weeks later. He was later released on a £16,000 bond.\n\nPeter McCallister – John Heard\n\nJohn Heard was most well-known for his role as Kevin’s loving father Peter McCallister in the legendary Christmas movie. But it’s fair to say things were less than rosy in his personal life.\n\nDespite his prolific acting career, the actor’s life was blighted by real-life drama and tragedy. His love life appeared to jump from one disaster to another.\n\nIn 1979, he married Superman star Margot Kidder, but the pair split just six days after they said ‘I do’. He went on to strike up a relationship with actress Melissa Leo, who gave birth to his son John Matthew Heard.\n\nHowever, the pair went on to end their relationship on bad terms when he was arrested in 1991 on suspicion of assaulting her. He also charged with third-degree assault after allegedly slapping Melissa, as well as stalking her and their son and allegedly beating up her new partner.\n\nAt the time, Melissa told People magazine: “I fear for the safety of my son and my safety.” Throughout the Nineties, John faced a number of offences and was found guilty of trespassing at his ex’s home in Baltimore in 1997.\n\nBut that didn’t stop the actor from trying to find love again, and went on to marry two more times, to Sharon Heard – who shared children Max and Annika together – and Lana Pritchard. His marriage to Lana collapsed after just seven months.\n\nThe actor’s son Maxwell John, from his marriage to Sharon, died at the age of 22 in 2016. In an obituary, Sharon said Max “died peacefully in his sleep” and was “in deep grief” allegedly due to “not having a father participating in his life.”\n\nJust on year later, John was found dead in a hotel room in Palo Alto, California, in July 2017. He was discovered by a maid at the age of 71 after he suffered a fatal heart attack.\n\nGus Polinski – John Candy\n\nHollywood legend, John Candy, only made a small cameo appearance in Home Alone as polka king Gus Polinski – a friendly musician who gave mum Kate McAllister a ride to the airport. Although he only had a small role in the film, his presence wasn’t lost on set or by viewers at home.\n\nBut in 1994, his prolific career was cut short – just four years after Home Alone was released – when he died suddenly at the age of 43. It is understood that he collapsed during the filming of his last movie project, Wagons East, in Mexico and died of a heart attack.\n\nAs well as battling weight issues throughout his life, the actor also smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and was a heavy drinker. At the time, it was also reported that he had developed a vicious cocaine habit during his time in the spotlight.\n\nHis death sent Hollywood into mourning, with millions of fans all over the world devastated at the news of his passing.\n\nOld Man Marley – Robert Blossom\n\nHave you joined Threads? Follow Daily Star to keep up to date on all things showbiz here.\n\nIt’s fair to say the late Roberts Blossom gave a brilliant performance as Kevin’s misunderstood neighbour, Old Man Marley. But away from the cameras, the actor and poet became a widower in 1982 – eight years before Home Alone hit theatres – after his second wife Marilyn passed away.\n\nAfter staring in the Christmas special, he was kept busy until the end of the 1990s, with his final acting credit given in 1995’s The Quick and the Dead. In his final years, Blossom was confined to a nursing home where he died of a stroke in 2011, aged 87.\n\nHis family was struck by tragedy again three years later when his only son, Michael, died of cancer."
