        "text": "Home Alone star John Heard's tragic death has stunned fans, but many of the secrets and scandals of his bizarre personal life have been long forgotten. The actor, who died at 72, had brushes with the law after allegedly abusing his baby mama, actress Melissa Leo, years ago and was once briefly married to troubled Superman star Margot Kidder. In fact, Heard had three marriages that failed. The Big actor has also been blasted for having been a neglectful bad dad to his son Max, who died just months before Heard, as RadarOnline.com has reported. Scroll through our gallery for more.\n\nBut that isn't all. In addition to Kidder, he has two other former wives, Sharon Heard and Lana Pritchard. Sharon and Heard had two children together, son Max and daughter Annika. And Heard's second wife, Sharon, dissed his parenting last year. Sharon wrote in Max's obituary when he died in Dec. 2016 at only age 22 that he had missed not having a father figure. His third ex-wife, Pritchard, told RadarOnline.com in an exclusive interview that their marriage was short-lived because she met another man.\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
