        "text": "'Merry Christmas ya filthy animals!' It's that time of the year again when we welcome the McCallister family into our homes and bask in our love of all things Christmas.\n\nFrom getting the tree up to watching our favourite festive flicks it's all about Christmas from here on in so let's just go with it.\n\nSpeaking of Christmas films, there really only is one contender for the nation's favourite, and sorry to all the Elf fans out there but it has to be Home Alone although it's hard to believe that the film is 33-years-old!\n\nSo what has become of the McCallister clan and favourite baddies over the past three decades? We did some digging and here's what we've found out:\n\nKevin McCallister/ Macaulay Culkin\n\nAt the grand old age of 43, Macaulay Culkin has finally been recognised with his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Home Alone catapulted the then ten-year-old to stardom, and he followed that up with the sequel and another hit blockbuster My Girl.\n\nAs he entered his teen years though it was Macaulay's personal life that grabbed the headlines. At 14, he became legally emancipated from his parents who had allegedly been trying to access his fortune during their divorce.\n\nHe married Rachel Miner at 17 but their marriage lasted just two years. Then news of his sleepovers at Michael Jackson's house came to light during the singer's molestation trial. Macaulay began dating Mila Kunis in 2002 and they remained together for nine years.\n\nIn 2012 pictures of the reclusive actor looking gaunt started the rumour mill about a heroin addiction-but he rubbished the claims. These days he is dating New Girl actress Brenda Song and the couple welcomed their first son Dakota April 2021 followed by another baby boy in early 2023. His latest acting appearance was in an American Horror story.\n\nHarry/Joe Pesci\n\nJoe Pesci was unforgettable as the lead bad guy in the film and went on to star in string of hits after Home Alone, including Goodfellas which earned him an Oscar, Casino, Raging Bull and the Lethal Weapon franchise.\n\nNow 80, Joe has been married three times including to the model Claudia Haro and Playboy star and actress Angie Everhart. He has one daughter Tiffany and is reportedly worth an estimate $50 million. No need to keep robbing housed then!\n\nMarv/Daniel Stern\n\nOne of the best(and creepiest) scenes in the whole film is when the tarantula crawls across Marv's face.\n\nWhile Joe carved out a career playing gangsters, after Home Alone, Daniel went a different route. He appeared in the City Slickers franchise and was also the adult voice of Kevin from The Wonder Years. He also later appeared with Fred Savage (Kevin) in Little Monsters.\n\nDaniel is also an accomplished sculptor and has been commissioned to produce multiple works for public display in the US. He has a son, coincidentally named Harry, who is a senator in California as well as two daughters Ella and Sophie.\n\nKate McCallister/Catherine O'Hara\n\nCatherine O'Hara is one of the best screen mums of all time and not just for her portrayal of Kate McCallister. Following on from the movie, Catherine's portrayal of the wonderful Moira Rose in Schitt's Creek also kept us all entertained, especially during lockdown.\n\nCatherine has also appeared in the hit film Beetlejuice, voiced the character of Sally in A Nightmare Before Christmas, and picked up five Canadian Screen Awards. She has also known for impersonating other celebs on the comedy show SCTV.\n\nCatherine met production designer Bo Welch on the set of Beetlejuice and they married in 1992. They have two sons, Matthew and Luke.\n\nPeter McCallister/ John Heard\n\nJohn Heard played Kevin's dad in the film and enjoyed a prolific career which included recurring roles in The Sopranos and CSI: Miami. His personal life hit the headlines on several occasions.\n\nHis first marriage was to the actress Margot Kidder but they separated after just six days. He then began dating soap actress Melissa Leo with whom he had a son. Leo later accused him of slapping her and he was charged with third-degree assault. He was also found guilty of trespassing at her home. The actor then married Sharon Heard and they had two children, Annika Rose and Maxwell John with whom he became estranged and who sadly died at the age of 22.\n\nIn 2010, Heard married his third wife Lana Pritchard but they divorced after less than a year. Heard passed away of a heart attack in July 2017.\n\nBuzz McCallister/ Devin Ratray\n\nKevin's bullying older brother Buzz has continued to act and is best known these days for his appearances in The Prince and Me, Breaking Point, Nebraska, Masterminds and Rough Night. Fans were delighted when Devin reprised his role in the reboot of the classic film series, Home Sweet Home Alone, and his character hilariously gave fans an update on what Kevin has been up to in the intervening years.\n\nNow a police officer and sporting an impressive beard, Buzz was reintroduced to audiences in the reboot as he catches deceiving Jeff (Rob Delaney) and Pam (Ellie Kemper) putting in the wrong code for the security alarm to Max's home.\n\nHe also appeared opposite Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu and Lili Reinhart in the 2019 film Hustlers. The actor has largely kept his personal life out of the spotlight.\n\nLinnie McCallister/ Angela Goethals\n\nAngela played Kevin's sassy sister Linnie and went on to star in mostly independent productions although she did nab a small part in the films Jerry Maguire and Spanglish.\n\nShe married Without A trace Actor Russel Sodder in 2005 and they now have three children.\n\nJeff McCallister/ Michael C. Maronna\n\nMichael was one of the middle McCallister children and went on to appear in The Adventures of Pete & Pete and other US sitcoms.\n\nAccording to US weekly, he has one son.\n\nMegan McAllister/ Hillary Woolf\n\nHillary played another of Kevin's sisters but quit acting soon afterward and instead turned her hand (quite literally) to Judo. Woolfe went on to represent the US in the Summer Olympics in the sport in 2000.\n\nNow a mum of two boys she has penned the book The Not So Zen Mom: Parenting Strategies for Survival back in 2017.\n\nFuller/ Kieran Culkin\n\nRemember Kevin's cousin who wet the bed? He's actually the actor's brother in real life. Kieran went on to appear in Father of the Bride and the noughties teen drama She's All That.\n\nBut Kieran is best known for portraying Roman Roy on Succession which earned him an Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. He married model Jazz Charlton in 2013 and they welcomed their first son in 2019, and a daughter two years later."
