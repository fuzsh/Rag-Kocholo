        "text": "She was a former child star, known for her roles in “Bright Eyes” (1934) and “Ginger” (1935), and she was a box office draw in the era of Jean Harlow, Norma Shearer and the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musicals. As an adult, she became legendary as the commercial character Josephine the Plumber. Of course, I’m talking about Jane Withers, legendary screen actress for so many reasons.\n\nMs. Withers passed away on August 6, 2021, in Burbank, California at age 95. Her daughter, costume designer Kendall Errair, confirmed the death to the Associated Press and said in a statement, ‘My mother was such a special lady. She lit up a room with laughter, but she especially radiated joy and thankfulness when talking about the career she so loved and how lucky she was.’\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 12, 1926, Ms. Withers made her breakthough film “Bright Eyes” when she was 8, playing ‘the meanest and creepiest little girl that God ever put on this planet, running over Shirley Temple with a tricycle and a baby buggy.’ When I met Ms. Withers in 2000, she said, ‘I thought everyone was going to hate me forever because I was so mean to Shirley Temple.’ But no, not at all. Quite to the contrary. As Joyce Smythe, a loud, spoiled, and obnoxious girl, she stole the show and audiences loved her. She then signed a seven-year contract with Fox, and appeared in three to five films a year.\n\nI was welcomed by Ms. Withers in her office in North Hollywood, in March 2000, located in a warehouse filled with her Hollywood memorabilia she had collected over the years. She was working very hard on an auction she was preparing, and although she was about to part with all this movie memorabilia, she would never lose it. ‘It will always stay in my heart,’ she said, ‘I had the fun of finding and saving these things which are very important to me, because it is all Hollywood history. It includes the barber chair of “My Darling Clementine” [1946], and the hat Clark Gable wore in “Saratoga” [1937] with Jean Harlow. I loved it very much, and because of that, I wanted to save it. But it has become a tremendous responsibility and it is taking so much of my time, while there are so many other things now that I could be doing and that I would like to do, and haven’t had a chance to do yet. I have always been working and I loved it, but there are other things as well in life. I would like to travel again, visit many places I have never had the privilege of going to before, and I’m looking forward to that.’\n\nMiss Withers was also famous for her priceless doll collection; it has become the largest and most extensive in the world. By the early 1940s, the collection was estimated at 3,500 dolls. Later it totalled 14,000 dolls; she started collecting them as a youngster when people used to send her gifts at the studio. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom she befriended in the mid-1930s, gave her one of his teddy bears, and from First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt she got a French doll.\n\nMiss Withers’ first husband was Texas oilman and rancher Bill Moss. After their divorce in 1954, she met and married Kenneth Errair, one of the Four Freshman, in 1955. They had two children, one of them Emmy Award winner Kendall Errair (b. 1960), renowned costume designer and costume supervisor who worked on numerous films since the mid-1980s.\n\nMs. Withers’ first starring role in “Ginger” (1935), which began filming on her 9th birthday, catapulted her to fame and she became one of the top money-making stars of the late 1930s, as Quigley’s Motion Picture Herald and The Motion Picture Almanac indicated for 1936 until 1939:\n\n1936—1 Shirley Temple 2 Clark Gable 3 Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers 4 Robert Taylor 5 Joe E.

I know it did result into a huge amount of fan mail; at one time I had seven secretaries that handled the mail and we would spend three nights a week answering them. I asked them to separate the mail into five different categories. Mostly the fans asked the same questions; like what your favorite movie is, things like that. Some of them had much deeper thoughts than that and those I always answered first myself. I still get fan mail, now they often send lobby cards and stills to autograph. The last two times I moved, I had put everything into boxes and crates, including the fan mail. But after I moved, I opened the boxes of mail and I did answer them.\n\nMs. Withers, how do you explain your success in the 1930s?\n\nBoth Shirley Temple and I were Depression babies, but in “Bright Eyes” I played a character that was the opposite of her. I had no lovely curls, though; I had no dimples, no anything, so I could never be like her. I was just plain Jane. But in the 1930s so much insecurity and so much unhappiness went on. Our films were always entertaining and funny, and they would take anybody’s mind of their problems. Because we were both children, the audience would associate their families with us and with the films we did. So it was logical that we were very successful at that time because we brought love and entertainment, we brought a lot of the things maybe they felt they were lacking in some way.\n\nYou then made film after film, and became a very popular child star. But what happened in the early 1940? Is it correct to say that your career came to a standstill?\n\nIn the 1940s I didn’t appear in films that much anymore, because of the war. I was doing all those bond and camp tours, that had priority over any movie I made. And I always said I would work until I was 21, then I hoped to find Mr. Right and be married for the rest of my life. Well, I got married at 21, unfortunately it wasn’t Mr. Right—but we’re still good friends though. Also, in the 1940s I had to leave Fox. I didn’t want to, but they weren’t letting me grow up. I was getting all these letters from kids telling me I had grown up with. They wrote, ‘Hey, you’re still doing those movies like you did when you were 10, but you’re not 10 anymore.’ In fact, when I was 15, I wrote one of my own films. It was called “Small Town Deb” [1942]. I wrote exactly about what was happening to me in my real life, only I put it in a small town. It gave me a chance to show in the film what my feelings as a teenager are when the mother isn’t allowing her daughter to grow up, or to be herself and to find herself. The character of the mother [played by Katharine Alexander] didn’t realize she was so concerned about her older daughter [role for Cobina Wright], and she really didn’t take into her heart the situation of her younger daughter [Ms. Wither’s part] who really needed her help and guidance.\n\n“Giant” (1956, trailer)\n\nAfter “Small Town Deb,” you made a handful of films in the 1940s, until you virtually retired from the screen. But, in the end, your career was far from over. Another milestone was your supporting role in “Giant” [1956]. Can you tell something about that? What was it like shooting that film?\n\nWhen we were shooting “Giant” in Texas, after work or at night, we’d have Monopoly marathons, bridge tournaments, play records, etc. I’d always have simple, wholesome food and at night nobody wanted to go home. So I had this huge Chinese gong sent from the studio. We always had to get up at four o’clock in the morning, and at ten minutes to nine, I’d ring this gong and would say, ‘Okay everybody, put the covers over the Monopoly games, we’ll continue tomorrow night just were we left off.’ It was fun, great fun.\n\nYou became friends with James Dean, didn’t you?\n\nAfter we had spent some time in Texas, he came up to me and asked me, ‘You don’t like me, do you?’ I said I did, but he had to change his attitude. Instead of spitting on the ground or kicking up the dirt when he was talking to somebody, he could at least be more gentle and kind to all the others, be more appreciative for what they did for him. We talked about that, and one evening when he came to my house, he wore a pink shirt he had been wearing for a few days already. As it was terribly hot in Texas, I told him, ‘You should put on another shirt every day. Why don’t you give it to me and I’ll see to it that it has been washed by tomorrow, so you can drop by and pick it up.’ That’s what he did and whenever it was dirty or needed to be washed, he brought it over to me, and we got along just fine. He had set his mind on going to this race in California and he frequently asked George Stevens if he couldn’t leave any sooner to drive up to California. George Stevens always said, ‘No Jimmy, you have to stay here until your scenes are finished, you can’t leave any sooner than that.’ The day he left, he brought me his pink shirt before driving off. And the, when we heard he had been killed in this car accident, everybody on the set was heart-broken.\n\nDo you have photographs of the two of you together?\n\nYes. I also took photographs of him on the set, but there are also photographs of the two of us. I cherish those very dearly.\n\nOne of the Comet TV commercials of Josephine the Plumber, with Robby Benson\n\nFrom 1963 to 1974, you played Josephine the Plumber, one of the most recognizable faces on television, in Comet cleanser TV commercials. Sometimes you read that this character made you a very wealthy woman. How do you feel about that?\n\nWell, it is true, but I never look at wealth in dollars and cents. To me it’s the wealth of experience, the people you share your time with and what you do with your time, that’s the real wealth in life. But I did put all my five children through school and college of what I made as Josephine the lady plumber. It was fun to do, it entertained a lot of people, they all got a big kick out of the character I played and I took it very seriously. There has never been a lady plumber shown in any way before. Although it was only a TV commercial, I went to school to learn all about plumbing. You have to be familiar with it all, you have to know about the job you’re performing. Anywhere I would go in that period of my life, truck drivers would say to me, ‘Hey Josy! I got a bad sink!’ And I’d say, ‘I’m on my way to a job, if I had more time I would be glad to fix it!’ or something like that [laughs].\n\nFinally, what is the best advice you would give anyone?\n\nKeep watching those old movies, they’re the best!\n\nNorth Hollywood,\n\nMarch 8, 2000\n\nFILMS\n\nHANDLE WITH CARE (1932) DIR David Butler PROD George King, Randall Faye SCR Frank Craven, Sam Mintz (story by David Butler) CAM John Schmitz ED Irene Morra MUS George Lipschultz CAST James Dunn, Boots Mallory, El Brendel, Victor Jory, Buster Phelps, Jane Withers (Extra [uncredited])\n\nZOO IN BUDEPEST (1933) DIR Rowland V.
