        "text": "John Heard’s estranged son died just six months before his actor father passed away.\n\nHome Alone star Heard died on July 21 at the age of 72.\n\nThe actor was found dead in his hotel room in Palo Alto, California, by staff after undergoing minor back surgery.\n\nNow, it has emerged that John’s 22-year-old son Max died in December 2016.\n\nThe son of Heard and his ex-wife Sharon passed away ‘peacefully in his sleep’, according to his obituary posted on Legacy.com.\n\nHowever, the obituary contained a dig at John – who also had a daughter Annika with second wife Sharon – with the post saying the star was absent during his son’s life.\n\nThe obituary read: ‘Many friends, including Annika, feel lost, as he directed them in their lives. Max was in deep grief of not having a father participating in his life. We did everything to help him, but the agony was with him.\n\n‘He knew how loved he was by his mother, and sister, and his new girlfriend Maggie. We adore him, and will continue to adore him. For all of eternity.’\n\nDespite the apparent estrangement in the family, Sharon, who was married to John from 1988 until 1996, praised his career while speaking to the New York Times following his death.\n\nShe said: ‘He’d never compromise. He’d get scripts every day, but he didn’t care about money. He didn’t care about the Hollywood scene at all.’\n\nHeard also has a son, John Matthew ‘Jack’ Heard III, with ex-girlfriend Melissa Leo.\n\nHe was married three times, splitting from Margot Kidder in 1979 after just six days of marriage and divorcing from Lana Pritchard seven months after their wedding in 2010.\n\nHeard was most famous for his role as Peter McCallister – aka Macaulay Culkin’s dad – in the Home Alone films.\n\nHe also guest starred in The Sopranos and appeared in films including Beaches, The Pelican Brief and Gladiator.\n\nMORE : Home Alone’s Daniel Stern pens tribute to ‘romantic raconteur’ co-star John Heard who lived ‘hard, fast, and fearlessly’"
