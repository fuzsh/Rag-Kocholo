        "text": "I'm sorry. üòï I failed an insurance producer today. üòí He was a prospect of mine. He would have been perfect for 1-on-1 coaching and I'd have helped him greatly. But he couldn't pull the trigger. Here's why... He's too focused on holding onto his pennies and he's passing up on the dollars at his feet. I've seen it so many times. Being stuck, that is. It's just that it seems \"too expensive\" and so the person doesn't move forward with it, even though they know it's what they need to do in order to succeed. And so they settle. Settle back into the routine of mediocrity. And they keep getting the results that mediocrity offers. That's why I failed. I failed him. I failed to help him picture and see the final outcome. The end result. The trophy at the end of the race. üèÜ The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I couldn't help him to stop thinking about a few thousand dollars out of his bank account and I couldn't help him see the tens of thousands of dollars in bank deposits he'd be making in a few months. Again, that's why I failed. ----- Moral of the story? We have level-up our MINDSET in order to level-up our COMMISSION CHECK. Going BIGGER requires a change in mindset. A new way of thinking. It's hard to grow and get to the next level when we're holding on to last year's goals.\n\nMaybe you've noticed it too? It seems to me that people on the EB side are much happier and smile a lot more than the people on the P&C side. ü§£ üòÅ üò© Not sure why that is. Maybe health insurance is more fun than P&C? I'm not sure about \"fun\" but I'll tell you this .... ------> The Broker of Record Letter process works sooooooo much better on the EB side than it does on the P&C side. The BOR is messy. It's necessary but it's messy, on the P&C side. The BOR does *not* work if you don't have access to the carrier, or the carrier doesn't accept BOR's, or the policy was written through a wholesaler and they won't accept the BOR, or the carrier will accept them but only if it's processed within a small window of time, and the new agent doesn't even receive commission on the policy they're taking over .... It's weird. Not much fun and not much to smile about. ü§£ The P&C industry doesn't love the BOR. But the EB side loves the BOR. ‚ù§Ô∏è - All of the carriers (for the most part) will accept the BOR. - The carriers don't care when the BOR is submitted. - And ... get this ... the carriers on EB side will pay the new broker the full commission on that plan, starting the very next month! üòÆ Wow! What a country! üá∫üá∏ I've said this very often: If I could go back and redo my insurance career over again, I'd be an EB producer and not a P&C producer. EB agents do it better. And, they smile more. ;-) ------ PS: If you're interested in learning how to win more signed BOR's and build your Book of Business to $1,000,000 or more, send me a DM and we'll schedule a complimentay call and I'll tell you how it works. PS2: Happy prospecting! üíØ Millionaire Insurance Producer Podcast Permission Network Insurance Agency, LLC\n\nI recently went with a producer on a 1st Appointment with his prospect. However, the incumbent broker was a large alphabet house in a different state and the account was likely in their #servicecenter. We were meeting with the office manager and not the owner. Normally I wouldn't even schedule a meeting with a non-decision maker but it was one of the first appointments this producer ever set up, and so we went. We learned about their (subcontractor) insurance needs and what they wanted to do for their business. Once she told me about the types of projects they were performing I assumed they didn't have the proper coverage since many of those projects would have been excluded on the typical General Liability policy. We then began searching for holes in the relationship with the agent and the lack of services, versus what our agency would provide if we were their agent. Since they hadn't met with their broker face-to-face in a few years, I asked when the last time the agent went through their exposures to ensure they were properly insured. She admitted she didn't know. I asked if we could quickly review her GL policy just to be sure. I scanned the exclusions and -- sure enough -- they didn't have coverage for about 50% of the work they were doing. I asked her to explain once again what types of projects they were doing, and then I read through the exclusion wording with her, showing her that such work was excluded on her policy. Earlier in the conversation I could tell she was reserved and not wanting to open up or give us a fair shot. However, since we were showing her the exclusions in their own policy, she was shocked. She then took the binder/policy into the owner's (decision maker) office to show him the exclusions. He wasn't too happy either. I told them we weren't going to quote their insurance renewal but that we'd take over the policy via #BOR and do it correctly. Even then, however, they wanted to call the incumbent agent to see if these exclusions were legitimate. We left them the copy of our blank Broker of Record Letter. The insured contacted the incumbent agent. The exclusions were legitimate. The insured was furious. They signed our Broker of Record Letter and the new producer stopped by to pick it up the next day. Not a huge account (about $6,500 of commission) but for that new producer and it being his first client .... it was like a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. üí∞ Ya just gotta love the low-hanging fruit! ----- WHAT CAN WE LEARN? If you'll simply prospect and set appointments, you'll find tons of insureds who are not happy, not loyal to their current agent, and not satisfied by what the agent has been doing for them. You can win the account easily. Even if you could only win 1 new account per month that way via signed BOR, you'd win 12 accounts in the year. And that's how you #12X. ----- PS: Send me a DM if you're interested in learning how to build your Book of Business to $1,000,000 or more."
