        "text": "John Heard, an Emmy-nominated actor who was best known for his performance in the Home Alone film franchise, has died. He was 71.\n\nHeard died on Friday, showbiz publication TMZ reported. The Santa Clara County coroners office confirmed Heard's death, and said the cause is under investigation. He was found in a hotel room in Palo Alto, California.\n\nPolice had been called to the hotel for a report of a medical emergency, but Heard was pronounced dead on the scene. TMZ.com also reported that Heard had undergone \"minor back surgery\" at the Stanford Medical Center, and was staying at the hotel to recover.\n\nHeard was best known for playing Peter McAllister, the father who famously left Kevin alone in the Home Alone films in the Nineties. He racked up 179 acting credits for parts in TV series and films, including Beaches, the 1988 action comedy, Gladiator and, later, The Sopranos, for which he received an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of detective Vin Makazian.\n\nHe acted continuously from the mid-Seventies, and was still filming Broome Street Boys, a police drama based in New York, when he died. Five other projects Heard has credits in are yet to be released.\n\nHis death has encouraged fans and members of the Hollywood industry to share their tributes on Twitter. Many praised his performance in Cutter's Way, the 1981 thriller in which Heard made his breakthrough role alongside Jeff Bridges, and Snake Eyes, which was directed by Brian De Palma.\n\nHeard had a tumultuous personal life. He married three times, first to Margo Kidder, best known for playing Lois Lane in the Superman films, for a mere six days in 1979. Heard had two children with his second wife, Sharon, whom he married in 1988, although his eldest son, Max, died in January. In 1987 he fathered his third child, Jack, with actress Melissa Leo. Leo raised the child by herself, but in 1996 she filed stalking charges against Heard, telling police that she \"fears for the safety of my son and my safety.\"\n\nTheir relationship, however, did improve. In 2013, Leo told Buzzfeed that she maintained a \"friendly\" relationship with Heard. He married his third wife, Lana Pritchard, in Los Angeles in 2010. The marriage lasted seven months.\n\nHeard is survived by his children Jack and Annika."
