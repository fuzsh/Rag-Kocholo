        "text": "Personal injury claims have often been misrepresented in the media as “frivolous.” For the people who have actually been affected by an accident, these claims are anything but. An injury can render you unable to work while trying to find ways to pay for medical expenses. Some people become permanently disabled, and may never be able to do some of the things they used to do.\n\nFighting for compensation for an injury isn’t about greed – it’s about finding a way forward through one of the most difficult times in a person’s life. Many people think of car accidents or slip and falls when they hear personal injury, but virtually any injury that is caused by the negligence of another party can qualify. You could even be injured in your own home after buying a defective product, and the manufacturers of that product should be held accountable for your pain and suffering\n\nAttorneys Invested in You\n\nYou need someone who will listen carefully to your story and help you pursue the damages you deserve; money that will help you get your life back! The Tate Law Group is an award-winning, nationally-recognized team of personal injury attorneys in Savannah. We work closely with our clients and learn how this accident has affected their lives so that we can aggressively fight for what they need in court.\n\nOur team has litigated hundreds of cases and received damage awards totaling over $100 Million on our clients’ behalf in numerous courts of law since 2007. Our experience and tenacity have helped victims of accidents find a way forward.\n\nAbout Savannah\n\nSavannah was founded by the British in 1733 and served as Georgia’s first capital when the territory achieved statehood. Savannah is the county seat of Chatham County and is the state’s oldest city. It is also one of Georgia’s largest communities, with a population of 147,780 as of 2020. Savannah’s downtown area is one of the most expansive National Historic Landmark Districts in the United States and offers a diverse array of parks and points of interest. Local attractions include River Street, the Owens-Thomas House, the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force, and the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences. Our team at Tate Law Group, LLC is proud to offer our personal injury services to the people of Savannah."
