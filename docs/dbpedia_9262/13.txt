Münster, city, North Rhine–Westphalia Land (state), western Germany. It lies on the small Münster-Aa River and the Dortmund-Ems Canal, northeast of Essen.

The community was first mentioned as Mimigernaford (“Ford over the Aa”) when Liudger (Ludger), a missionary sent by Charlemagne, founded a bishopric there in 804. It was renamed Münster in 1068 and was chartered in 1137. Münster’s favourable position at the intersection of long-distance trade routes and its wool trade with England gave it early economic importance and contributed to its influential position in the Hanseatic League in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Anabaptists, who constituted the radical wing of the Protestant Reformation, proclaimed their “kingdom of a thousand years” there in 1534. In 1535 Münster was captured by an army of Catholics and Protestants, and in 1536 the Anabaptists’ “king,” John of Leiden (Jan Beuckelson), was executed with two of his accomplices; the iron cages in which their bodies were publicly exhibited still hang in the Gothic tower of St. Lambert’s Church. A neutralized Münster was the scene of the peace congress (1645–48) that resulted in the Peace of Westphalia. In 1815 Münster became the capital of Prussian Westphalia.
