        "text": "Welcome to Münster\n\nMünster, located in the heart of Westphalia, is a city that combines history, culture and a lively way of life. Its rich past, coupled with a modern attitude to life, makes Münster a fascinating destination. Here is a detailed look at the facets that make Münster so special:\n\nHistorical significance\n\nPrussian provincial capital: Between 1815 and 1946, Münster was the capital of the Prussian province of Westphalia, which gave the city a formative historical role.\n\nPeace of Westphalia: As the venue for the peace negotiations that ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Münster has a firm place in the history books.\n\nGeographical location\n\nHeart of the Münsterland: Strategically positioned between the Ruhr area and Osnabrück, Münster forms the center of an idyllic landscape.\n\nPicturesque scenery: The city stretches along the Münstersche Aa, surrounded by natural beauty and thus offers a unique atmosphere.\n\nPrinzipalmarkt and historic gabled houses\n\nCharacteristic place: Prinzipalmarkt, with its historic gabled houses, is the center of city life, where history comes alive.\n\nGothic masterpiece: The Lamberti Church dominates the market and gives it an unmistakable character.\n\nBicycle friendliness\n\nBicycle paths: Over 500 kilometers of cycle paths make Münster the most bicycle-friendly city in Germany.\n\nAasee: The man-made lake is the centerpiece for outdoor leisure activities and relaxation.\n\nStudent city and university town\n\nUniversity of Münster: The university characterizes the cityscape and creates a dynamic and young atmosphere.\n\nBotanical Garden: A highlight for nature lovers and a place of peace and beauty.\n\nGreen oases and all-weather zoo\n\nParks and green spaces: Münster offers a variety of recreational opportunities in its parks and at the Aasee lake.\n\nAll-weather zoo: An attraction for families and animal lovers who want to experience exotic animals up close.\n\nCulinary delights\n\nMünsterland cuisine: From savory to sweet, the culinary offerings reflect the diversity of the region.\n\nPumpernickel and student slices: Two specialties that should not be missed.\n\nImportance as a sports city\n\nMünster is not only culturally and historically significant, but also a lively sports city. From cycling and water sports on Lake Aa to university sports, there is something for everyone. Ballooning also has a long tradition in Münster and Münsterland. The city regularly hosts sporting events that inspire visitors and locals alike. The combination of sporting diversity and the bicycle-friendly infrastructure promotes\n\nLaunchfield Castle Square\n\nThe starting area on Münster's Castle Square is within walking distance of public transport and in close proximity to the city center of Münster. The launch of the Gordon Bennett 2024 will therefore take place close to the city center, making it attractive for the public. The launch site on the Castle's Square offers optimal space for pilots, spectators and partners.\n\nLaunchfield"
