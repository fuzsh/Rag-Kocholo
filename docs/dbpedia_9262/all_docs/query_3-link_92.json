        "text": "Its central location makes H.ostel Münster ideal for a tour through the historical centre. In addition to the cathedral and the Prinzipalmarkt, it is well worth visiting the Krameramtshaus, one of the oldest guild houses of the city or the Baroque Church of Clemens. A visit to Münster must include an evening in the Kuhviertel. It is characterised by a lively mix of student bars, typical Westphalian restaurants and historic breweries such as the \"Pinkus Müller\".\n\nDuring the day, the small shops in the narrow streets invite you to window-shop. Get to know the rest of the city of Münster too, for example the Hansaviertel around the former city port. The \"in district\" impresses with the \"waterfront\" - port buildings converted to apartments - as well as the port promenade with its many excursion possibilities. A different atmosphere prevails in the Geistviertel, which was created as a garden city after the first world war and has a popular weekly market. A cultural delight awaits you at Nienberge: Visit the Haus Rüschhaus here with the Droste-Museum.\n\nThe poet Annette von Droste-Hülshoff (1797-1848) lived in the Haus Rüschhaus, which is surrounded by a baroque garden from 1826 to 1846. Her living room and study have been preserved in their original condition. The rooms have a unique charm and give an impression of how the poet lived. Behind the main building is the lavishly designed garden with its orangery.\n\nYou can learn more about Annette von Droste-Hülshoff on a trip to the Burg Hülshoff, the birth and childhood home of the poet which is designed as a typical Münster water castle from the 15th century. If you are staying with your children at H.ostel Münster, the Münster Zoo is also well worth a visit. The attractions include over 300 animal species, a monkey house, the lion house and the bear house as well as an aquarium, a tropical house and a petting zoo.\n\nIf you come to Münster in winter, you will experience a very special atmosphere in the city. No less than five Christmas markets – the oldest in the courtyard of the town hall, the Aegidii Christmas market with a pantomime, the the Giebelhüüskesmarkt at the Überwasserkirche, the light market in St. Lamberti and the Christmas village in the Kiepenkerl – spread Christmas cheer in the old town. However, carnival is always loud and cheerful. Münster is the capital of the Westphalian carnival, the highlight is the Rosenmontagszug (Rose Monday Parade) from the castle through the city centre.\n\nActive holidaymakers benefit from the wonderful routes around the bicycle-friendly city of Münsterland. For example, cycle the \"Peace Route\" on the Dortmund-Ems canal or circle the city on the 40-kilometer long \"small circuit\".\n\nThe around 960-kilometre \"100-castles route\" is a cycle path in Münsterland and in the Tecklenburg land which passes well over a hundred castles, palaces, manor houses, parks and monasteries. The cycle path is divided into four, according to the circuits named after compass points, of which three pass through or close to Münster.\n\nMünster, the city of culture and knowledge has many attractive museums to offer. In the LWL Museum of Natural History marvel at the dinosaurs and discover the vastness of the universe in the planetarium. The unique Museum of Lacquer Art impresses with gleaming treasures from Asia, Europe and the Arab world. The archaeological museum of the university and the City Museum are places where you can learn about history with lots of interesting facts about Münster. Stay at H.ostel Münster and discover a welcoming and diverse city!"
