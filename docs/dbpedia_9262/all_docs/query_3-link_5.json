        "text": "1648 marks an important date for Germany and for Europe. 30 years before, an incident in eastern Europe led to a war that encompassed most of Europe but was held mainly in the area which is now called Germany. Social confilcts on themes like religion, supremacy of the state, clergy or monarchy where fundamental drivers of that war. But in 1648 the leaders of the several groups that were part of that war came together in Münster and Osnabrück to talk. These negotiations were later supposed to be the first ones to end a war in the history of the world in those times. Not swords ended that war, but negotiations. That´s something we all should celebrate and therefor, several events will take place during the next months to commemorate this."
