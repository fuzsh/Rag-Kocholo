Other sporting facilities include surfing, fishing, tennis, squash and bowls.\n\nThe coastline, south of the city of Durban, is known as the South Coast of the province of KwaZulu-Natal. This is where one will find South Africa’s most beautiful, sandy beaches, lush vegetation and quiet coastal villages for perfect beach holidays. Further down the south coast, beyond the towns of Shelly Beach and Margate, the coast becomes known as the Lower South Coast. The lower south coast is nature’s paradise and the perfect beach holiday destination. Sparsely populated, beautiful, rolling farmlands, breathtaking natural scenery, majestic gorges and the quietest, most beautiful, natural and unspoiled beaches in the country.\n\nIn the heart of the lower south coast lies the quiet village of Munster. Twenty kilometres beyond Margate, away from the madding crowds. Munster is only eight kilometres from the border-town of Port Edward and is a natural stop-over for travelers to and from the Eastern Cape.\n\nBeach Holidays and More in and around Munster\n\nBeautiful, safe beaches\n\nCentrally located to the best coastal golf courses. An ideal base for that dream golf holiday.\n\nMunster Sports Club. Bowls, tennis and squash facilities.\n\nHome to Glenmore Ski-Boat Club\n\nBeautiful, quiet and natural running, walking and cycling routes\n\nBirder and nature lover’s paradise\n\nMunster: A Quiet, Natural Area\n\nMunster has not been effected by large scale commercialization and has remained a quiet, peaceful, natural area, known for its abundant bird life and small wildlife, including Grey and Blue Duiker, Bushbuck and the ever present Vervet monkeys. These attributes make Munster, on the lower south coast, an ideal coastal holiday destination for peaceful, quiet relaxation."
