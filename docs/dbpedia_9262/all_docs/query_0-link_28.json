        "text": "17th European Biological Inorganic Chemistry Conference (EuroBIC-17)\n\nWelcome to the 17th European Biological Inorganic Chemistry Conference (EuroBIC-17), which is held at the University of MÃ¼nster from August 25th to 29th 2024. The EuroBIC conference series provides a platform for the presentation and discussion of the latest developments at the interface of Inorganic Chemistry and Life Sciences. EuroBIC-17 will follow the highly successful previous meetings, the last four being held in Grenoble (2022), Reykjavik (2020, online conference), Birmingham (2018), and Budapest (2016). Twenty years after EuroBIC-7 had taken place in GarmischâPartenkirchen in 2004, we are pleased to host EuroBIC-17 in Germany again.\n\nJens MÃ¼ller (Chair, UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nster)\n\nSonja Herres-Pawlis (Co-Chair, Rheinisch-WestfÃ¤lische Technische Hochschule Aachen)\n\nNils Metzler-Nolte (Co-Chair, Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum)\n\nFollow us on X @eurobic17 for the latest conference news!\n\nFounded more than 1200 years ago, the city of MÃ¼nster looks back on plenty of history. In 1648, MÃ¼nster became a city of peace when the Treaty of Westphalia was signed here. After the Napoleonic era, the city became the capital of the Province of Westphalia. Severely damaged in World War II, MÃ¼nster was rapidly rebuilt in the 1950s. Today, the combination of old street network and modern buildings attracts a large number of tourists from all over the world. In 2004, MÃ¼nster has been awarded the title of âWorldâs Most Livable Cityâ (LivCom Award 2004). With more than 300 000 inhabitants, MÃ¼nster is an important economic and scientific centre in the northwestern part of Germany. It can easily be reached by car, train and plane (for more details, see travel information). The city hosts the University of MÃ¼nster and the University of Applied Sciences, both together currently educating some 60 000 students in more than 180 disciplines."
