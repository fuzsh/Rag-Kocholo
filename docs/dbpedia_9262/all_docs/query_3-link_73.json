        "text": "Prinzipalmarkt\n\nA special part of the city’s colourful history has survived on the Prinzipalmarkt (principle marketplace), which dates back to the mid-12th century. It seems almost as if the Middle Ages and Hanseatic League are still alive and kicking there, as long-established merchant families go about their daily business. The traditional square with its characteristic gabled houses and arcades is Münster’s economic and political hub as well as being home to the Historical City Hall with its Gothic façade and Peace Hall, which was awarded the European Heritage Label in 2015. Not only that, it also offers an array of exclusive shops and top-quality restaurants. The north side of the square is crowned by the steeple of St Lambert’s Church and the south side by the old town hall tower.\n\nFurther information on the Prinzipalmarkt\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – Angelika-Klauser\n\nMünster Cathedral\n\nMünster Cathedral (St.-Paulus-Dom) is a Roman Catholic church and the third cathedral in the Diocese of Münster. It was constructed between 1225 and 1264 and unites elements of the Romanesque and Gothic styles. The cathedral is among the most significant church buildings in Münster and, alongside the Historical City Hall, is one of the city’s major landmarks. Church towers are not only striking features of the city’s unmistakeable skyline, churches are vibrant places bringing people together and popular sightseeing destinations with tourists with a special interest in religion and art history. Religion has always played a particularly special role in this Peace of Westphalia city, which hosted important negotiations leading to the end of the Thirty Years’ War in Europe in 1648. Ever since, the city has played an active role in promoting religious tolerance and dialogue between the belief systems.\n\nFurther information on Münster Cathedral\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – Tilman Roßmölle\n\nSt Lambert’s Church\n\nThe church was once funded as a market and town church by the merchants of Münster and now adorns the north side of the Prinzipalmarkt. Built between 1375 and 1450, the church is famous for a story about the three cages in the three towers. These iron baskets were used for the public execution of three remaining leaders of the period of Anabaptist rule in Münster in 1536. The tower warden sounds a horn every half an hour from 9 p.m. until midnight – an office which has existed since 1379.\n\nOpening hours: Daily from 8:00 a.m. to 6:45 p.m. Please also note the church’s special events before planning your visit.\n\nFurther information on the Peace Hall\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – Tilman Roßmöller\n\nPeace Hall in the Historical City Hall\n\nThe city hall became famous during the negotiations for the Peace of Westphalia in Münster and Osnabrück, which brought the Thirty Years’ War in Europe to an end. In addition, the Peace of Münster, which signalled peace between the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Empire was also signed there in the council chamber (now also known as the Peace Hall) on 15th May 1648.\n\nOpening hours: Tuesday to Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. as well as from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays. Entrance fee: Adults €2.00, concessions €1.50. The hall remains closed during official events.\n\nFurther information on the Peace Hall\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – MünsterView\n\nAllwetterzoo Münster\n\nThe Allwetterzoo (all-weather zoo) in Münster really lives up to its name, as it is well worth a visit come wind, rain or shine. The zoo is home to a whole menagerie of wild animals including rhinos, monkeys, leopards and elephants. One particular highlight is the large tropical greenhouse with colourful birds soaring through the air and plenty more to see in the tanks and enclosures too. There are also a number of play areas for families, offering plenty of opportunities for children to run around and have fun. The large water play area is a particular hit in the summer.\n\nOpening hours: Daily, times vary depending on the season. Entrance fee: Adults €18.90, children €10.90\n\nFurther information on the Allwetterzoo Münster\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – MünsterView\n\nLocal castles and stately homes\n\nMünster and the surrounding region is well known and loved for its wide array of castles and stately homes. Romantic stately homes and breathtaking moated castles are sure to delight you and whisk you back to days gone by. The beautifully landscaped gardens and parks are also always well worth a visit. To make it even easier, there is a mapped castle route stretching 960 km and connecting the most idyllic castles, stately homes and estates. Some stretches of the route are also suitable for bicycle tours.\n\nInformation on opening times and entrance fees\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – MünsterView\n\nWeekly market\n\nIf you’re planning a city trip to Münster, you should definitely make sure to include a Wednesday or Saturday, which is when the famous weekly market is held in front of the cathedral. The abundant range of goods on offer draws scores of visitors into the city centre: fresh fruit, vegetables, fish, game, poultry (ready-plucked or still clucking), herbs & spices, antipasti, bread, cakes and – especially in late summer – a veritable sea of beautiful flowers… The predominantly regional offering is also complemented by Dutch liquorice, fashionable jewellery, socks and batik shirts. Of course, no visit is complete without a soup from the Erbsenbus or a wedge of cheese from one of the many cheese vans. To top it all off, the organisers of the market have even come up with an excellent service to ensure you can peruse the stalls at your leisure: the Taschenwagen (bag van) will store your purchases cool, safe and free of charge until you are ready to pick them up again and leave.\n\nOpening hours are from 07.00 am – 02.30 pm.\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – Angelika Klauser\n\nAasee recreation area\n\nMünster’s central recreation area is situated around the Aasee lake. It is around 2.3 km long and spans an area of 40.2 hectares. The lake is surrounded by a multitude of park areas and collects the water from the river Aa, serving as a flood control measure as well as performing an important ecological and urban planning function. Picturesque paths attract people going for strolls, joggers and cyclists into the countryside; boat hire and sailing clubs offer the ideal opportunity to discover the lake from the water and cafés, restaurants and hotels ensure visitors are left wanting for nothing. The banks of the Aasee are also home to a youth hostel, a university refectory, a sports park, the Allwetterzoo Münster, a natural history museum with a planetarium and the Mühlenhof-Freilichtmuseum open-air museum. The Aaseepark spanning around 90 hectares was also named “Europe’s Most Beautiful Park of the Year 2009”.\n\nFurther information on the Aasee\n\nPhoto: © Adrian Klein\n\nMünster port\n\nMünster port is an inland port about the same size as the Old Town. Created as a harbour basin for the Dortmund-Ems Canal and opened by the German emperor Wilhelm II in 1899, the port was predominantly designed for imports right from the start. It suffered serious damage during World War II but was back in business again as early as 1946 with the aim of supplying desperately required construction materials for the rebuilding of the country. Today, the port is of little importance as a distribution hub; instead, the north bank is mainly home to cultural and gastronomic highlights, earning it the name “Kreativkai” (Creative Quay). Office buildings, a publishing house, the Wolfgang Borchert Theatre and a wide range of restaurants and trendy clubs ensure that there is always plenty going on whatever the hour.\n\nFurther information on the port\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – Tilman Roßmöller\n\nRieselfelder recreation area in Münster\n\nSituated just 6 km from the city centre is the popular Rieselfelder recreation area with its shallow water and reed bed areas as well as its wetlands and avenues lined with fruit trees. Covering around 230 hectares, it is home to many species of birds, offering them plentiful food sources and breeding places. Why not enjoy a walk through the Rieselfelder wetlands starting off from the biological station? The station offers a wide range of information materials and you can also visit the museum’s exhibition rooms to find out more about the natural habitats and flora and fauna found in the nature reserve.\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster\n\nThe Botanical Garden\n\nVisit one of the oldest gardens in Germany – very close to Münster Castle and Lake Aasee.\n\nSince 1803, the Botanical Garden has been a highlight in the beautiful city of Münster. Explore the variety of plants from different regions of the world on a total area of about 5 hectares. Not only a popular place for tourists - for students and scientists, the Botanical Garden also serves as an educational and research facility.\n\nTake part in interesting events, workshops and guided tours and experience nature at its best.\n\nMore about the Botanical Garden in Münster\n\nPhoto: © Hp.Gruesen – Pixabay\n\nPablo Picasso Museum\n\nGermany’s only Picasso museum can be found behind a listed façade in the heart of Münster’s Old Town. All in all, the museum boasts a permanent collection of around 800 Picasso lithographs and hosts special exhibitions featuring Picasso and his classic modern art contemporaries at different intervals. The public tours offer a fantastic insight into the popular artist’s work. Check the museum’s events calendar to find out more about current exhibitions.\n\nOpening hours: Tuesday to Friday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm different opening hours on public holidays. Entrance fee: Adults €10.00; young people up to 18 €4.00, children up to 6 years of age fre\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – Bernhard Fischer\n\nSkulpture Projects\n\nThe first exhibition was held in 1977 with around 40 works set up around the city and has since become a symbol of the city of Münster. Many of the sculptures were later relocated to Münster permanently following the exhibitions, either having been purchased or donated on permanent loan. Today, the exhibition is known as one of the most important public art exhibitions. The free, international art event is held for around 100 days every 10 years and attracts visitors from all over the world. In 2017, the exhibition comprised around 35 artistic positions from sculpture to performing art. Some of the works can still be seen around the centre of Münster.\n\nFurther information on the Sculpture Projects\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – Angelika Klauser\n\nMühlenhof-Freilichtmuseum open-air museum\n\nThe foundations for the new open-air museum were laid in 1961 when the old Emsland post mill was rebuilt. Located directly alongside the Aasee, the museum grounds are home to a further 20 traditional buildings from the Münster region and surrounding areas. The museum gives visitors a taste of what it was like to live and work in the rural area around Münster.\n\nOpening hours: From March to October, 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. From November to February, 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Entrance fee: Adults €5.00, Children aged 7 to 16 €3.00, children up to 6 years of age free\n\nFurther information on the Mühlenhof-Freilichtmuseum open-air museum\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster\n\nMuseum of Lacquer Art\n\nSituated directly opposite the hotel is the Museum of Lacquer Art, the only one of its kind in the world. The collection is composed of around two thousand exhibits from Europe, East Asia and the Islamic world. The value of the different works only becomes truly clear to visitors when they find out more about the complex manufacturing techniques. In addition, the museum’s unique building also plays host to a wide range of different concerts and readings.\n\nOpening hours: Tuesday 12:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., Wednesday to Sunday 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.\n\nEntrance fee: €3.00\n\nPhoto: © Presseamt Münster – MünsterView"
