These institutions have an enormous impact on the formation of Münster as an accepted research and technology place.\n\nThe Technology Centre is an important node within the local technology network. Thus the universities transfer office and numerous branch initiatives and associations are located in the Technology Centre.\n\nThe »most worth living city in the world«\n\nIn October 2004 Münster has been awarded as the world's most liveable community in the category Cities with 200.000 to 750.000 inhabitants.
