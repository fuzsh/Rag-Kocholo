The history of the city begins in 793 AD, and it is proud of its long history. This is one of the most attractive tourist cities in Germany, which combines the historical atmosphere and attractions, rhythm and entertainment of a modern large center.\n\nMuenster can offer tourists interesting sights, monuments of ancient sacral and modern architecture. Despite the fact that downtown was badly damaged during World War II, many historical sites were carefully restored. All the main sights of Muenster are located in the downtown surrounded by the \"green belt\", which is a pedestrian alley with greenery. The main masterpiece of sacred architecture is St. Paul's Cathedral, built in the XIII century. The facade is decorated with an astronomical clock made in the Late Middle Ages, which every day at noon shows the so-called show. A five minute walk from the cathedral is the street of the city elders Prinzipalmarkt. It is very funny to look at this street from the side, because every house has a magnificent Renaissance facade \"imposed\" in front. As a rule, it is one and a half to two times higher than the house itself. The highest, Late Gothic facade is the Town Hall, where the burgomaster and the city council of Muenster still have sessions. However, the old oak hall is open to all and works as a museum. The Gothic St. Lambert's Church, located opposite the Town Hall, is of historical value. Three cages hang on the tower of the church, in which in 1536 the bodies of the executed leaders of the Munster Anabaptist Commune were exhibited. Also a favorite place for tourists is the Gothic Church of St. Mary the Virgin, which is often called the \"church above the water\", as it is located near the small river Aa.\n\nWhile staying in Muenster, one should definitely visit the zoo, which is officially called \"All Weather Zoo\". This is one of the largest German zoos, while it is rather unconventional, because with a special ticket one can feed animals here. In addition, the zoo has a dolphinarium and a huge glazed area – the tropical pavilions. The visitors walk along special paths, while hummingbirds rush past them.\n\nMuenster offers city visitors a variety of inexpensive, but cozy, restaurants and cafeterias where one can taste dishes of national and international cuisine. Also, one can find a variety of shops on the streets of the downtown, where customers and visitors are always welcome."
