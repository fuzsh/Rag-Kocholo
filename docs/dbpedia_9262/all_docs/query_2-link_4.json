        "text": "MÃ¼nster - A city between services and agriculture\n\nThe city of MÃ¼nster is the capital of the correspondent administrative district in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. From 1815 to 1946, MÃ¼nster was the capital of the former Prussian province Westphalia. With a population of more than 310,000 people it is the 20th biggest city in Germany. Â\n\nMÃ¼nster is the seat of a catholic bishop. In 805 St. Ludgerus was consecrated as MÃ¼nsterâs first bishop. His 76th successor Felix Genn holds this position since 2009.\n\nMÃ¼nster emerged from an old Saxonian settlement, where bishop Ludgerus founded a monastery in 793. MÃ¼nster obtained its city rights in 1190. Further outstanding events of the cityâs history include the declaration of the kingdom of the Baptist movement and the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.\n\nMÃ¼nster is famous for its numerous bicycles and for its partially reconstructed ancient urban district, which was heavily destroyed during World War II. The city centre and especially the renowned âPrinzipalmarktâ were reconstructed again. The landscape around MÃ¼nster is very flat. Itâs biggest lake Aasee is located on the borders of the city centre. MÃ¼nster has got several theatres and museums. The city is the setting of the TV show âTatortâ, which reaches the highest viewing figures among all series of criminal fiction on German TV.\n\nWith nearly 60,000 students, MÃ¼nster belongs to the ten biggest university cities in Germany. MÃ¼nster offers a lot of jobs in the service industries, however traditional industries are comparatively rare. Instead of that, MÃ¼nster possesses various administrative authorities and courts. However, this medieval and more than 1,200 year old city with its endless amount of historic sites also possesses the biggest agricultural surface among all district-free cities in Germany, which covers an area of 13,865 hectares. 350 farmer families cultivate their fields, pastures and croplands."
