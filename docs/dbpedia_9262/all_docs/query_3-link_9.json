        "text": "Munster, the southwestern province of Ireland, comprising the counties of Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford. It was historically one of the “Five Fifths” (ancient provinces, or kingdoms) of Ireland. Geographically, the area is divided by the Sliabh Luachra Mountains into Desmond to the south and Thomond to the north.\n\nThe power of the kingdom originally lay in the south, where the ruling Érainn clan had their chief fortress at Temuir Érann in the Ballyhoura Hills in what is now County Limerick. Inroads into northern Munster made by the neighbouring men of Leinster were fought off by a people known as the Eoghanachta, who were aided by dési, professional fighting men, who were rewarded for their efforts with land that became County Waterford and part of southern County Tipperary. An offshoot group of those dési invaded Connaught and deprived that kingdom of the area that is now County Clare. From 400 ce the Eoghanachta ruled Munster, establishing colonies in Cork and Kerry and making Cashel their capital.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nBattle of Clontarf: The rise of Munster"
