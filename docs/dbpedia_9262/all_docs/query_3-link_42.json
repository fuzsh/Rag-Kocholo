        "text": "-About us-\n\nThe Munster Mansion is the proud home of Sandra and Charles McKee. The Munster Mansion is a replica of the house portrayed in the 1960’s sitcom, \"The Munster’s\". It has been painstakingly recreated room by room, through watching and re-watching footage from the show. Many pieces in the house are items or exact matches of items from the show. This is a living work as each year more detail is added, and more items collected to make this as exact as it can be. It was a challenging project, as there were no plans or blueprints to go by. The house was completely designed by the use of the show footage.\n\nWe are open for private tours by appointment Only"
