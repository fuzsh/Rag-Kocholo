        "text": "Dear Traveler,\n\nAs you wander the world in search of inspiration, understanding, and your own meaningful path, your feet might decide to take you exploring the charming cities of North-Western Germany. And among them, you will come across a place of captivating contrasts that is sure to enchant and encourage the best in you.\n\nThe cultural center of the Westphalia region, Münster is both ancient and youthful, a city of rich history and traditions, romantic bells, fascinating modern art, and awesome urban culture.\n\nVoted among the finalist for the European Green Capital Award, and as one of the world’s most livable cities, Münster is also Germany’s bicycle capital.\n\nIt is an engaging place, that inspires and provokes its guests, offering them a chance to explore and enjoy both past and modern times.\n\nThe stories of Münster\n\nA beginning…\n\nThe tale of Münster began to unfold at the end of the 8th century when the great Roman Emperor Charlemagne sent the Frisian missionary Ludger to continue his work from a stronghold near the Aa River, called Mimigernaford.\n\nSaint Ludger, later named the Apostle of Saxony, raised a church and an abbey on the right bank of the Aa, and it is said that from that monastery the city of Münster gained its name. As it dominated the crossroad between Cologne and Frisia, a powerful center soon formed around the monastery.\n\nIn 797, Ludger founded one of the oldest schools in Germany here, adding one more layer to the importance of this remarkable place.\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nAs an influential member of the Hanseatic League, the medieval alliance of ancient merchant guilds, Münster flourished even more during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Town Keeper\n\nProud of its glorious past, the city of Münster kept a remarkable tradition alive for over 600 years. There has been a town keeper, watching over the city from the 75-meter-tall tower of St. Lamberti Church, every day since 1383.\n\nToday, Martje Saljé, the first woman to occupy this honored position, safeguards the town from her high tower, looking out for fires or any other threats to the city.\n\nEach evening, save Tuesdays, between 9 p.m. and midnight, you can hear the tower guard blowing her horn, an exact reproduction of the ancient one from the 16th century. Thus, like many before her, she is announcing, to the south, west, and north that all is well within Münster.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia\n\nIn 1648, Münster was chosen as one of the two cities to host the signing of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years War (1618–1648) and the Eighty Years War (1568–1648).\n\nThe two important treaties, signed in October 1648 in Münster and Osnabrück, brought peace to the Holy Roman Empire, ending the horrible wars that killed over eight million people.\n\nThe room where the famous Münster Treaty was signed can be visited today in the city’s awesome historical Town Hall.\n\nWorld War II\n\nMünster is a city of rebirth, as it was almost entirely destroyed by air raids during the Second World War. Though approximately 90 % of its Old Town was ruined in 1944, it rose from the ashes and was faithfully reconstructed during the 1950s, reaching its pre-war magnificence.\n\n7 great things to do in Münster\n\n1.
