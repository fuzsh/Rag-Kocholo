        "text": "The Historical City Hall of Münster, located in Prinzipalmarkt street, is a significant landmark in Münster, Germany. It has been the historic seat of the mayor and the city council for centuries. This Gothic-style building from the 14th century was destroyed at the end of World War II and was subsequently rebuilt. Today, it stands as a testament to the city's rich history and architectural heritage.\n\nHistorical Events at the City Hall\n\nThe Historical City Hall of Münster holds a significant place in European history as the site where the Treaties of Westphalia were signed. These treaties ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648.

These tours provide an opportunity to explore the building's rich history and architectural features. Visitors can learn about the city's past, the signing of the Treaties of Westphalia, and the building's reconstruction after World War II."
