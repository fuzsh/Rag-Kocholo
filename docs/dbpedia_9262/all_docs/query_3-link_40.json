        "text": "Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, also known as the University of Münster, is a public research university and one of the largest in Germany with more then 45,000 students. It is often considered to be among some of the best universities in the country.\n\nDue to lack of funds, university’s establishment dates back to 1780, almost a century after Pope Urban VII and Emperor Ferdinand II granted their permission for its foundation. The institution was built with money accumulated from the dissolution of its predecessor Münster's Jesuit College. Since 1907, the institute bears the name of the last German emperor Frederick William Victor Albert of Prussia.\n\nLocated in the most densely populated administrative region in Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, the University of Münster has developed an reputation for excellence in cross-disciplinary research in medicine, business studies, mathematics and chemistry. Organised in 15 departments, the institute awards degrees on all levels ranging from protestant theology, PR and journalism to psychology and sports science.\n\nThe German Research Foundation and the funding programme excellence strategy of the Federal Government and the 16 administrative regions of Germany actively support the institution with funds aimed at big-scale research projects conducted in partnerships with German and international universities.\n\nStudent life in Münster, often ranked as being among the most live-able towns worldwide, offers choices of cultural events for every taste spanning from music festivals, theatre performances and historical exhibitions.\n\nThe symbol of the university is the famous Schloss, a building that resembles a mansion house, similar to the one in which the university’s administrative centre resides.\n\nSome famous alumni of the university include the footballer Jens Lehman, and Nobel Laureate Georg Bednorz.\n\nThe institution follows the motto: \"living knowledge\"."
