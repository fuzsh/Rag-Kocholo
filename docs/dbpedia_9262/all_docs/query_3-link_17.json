        "text": "There are bike paths throughout the city, and there’s even a bicycle garage at the main train station where you can rent, park or have your bike repaired. At many stop lights, you are allowed to move to the front of the line of cars so that drivers can see you better. If the weather’s bad, you can simply use the public bus lines. But if you go on foot, always watch out for oncoming bikers at the traffic lights and intersections.\n\nThere is a long 4.5-km promenade which runs around downtown Münster. This green ring circling the historic part of town used to be the site of the city wall, but is now open to bikers and pedestrians. A large Trödelmarkt (jumble sale) regularly takes place along the promenade during the summer. There you can find (or sell) used goods at an affordable price.\n\nMünster is famous for its Friedenssaal (Peace Hall). Located inside the Historic City Hall, it was the meeting place of a large congress of European ambassadors from 1644 to 1648. They were the first to draft a treaty known as the “Peace of Westphalia” which finally brought peace to Europe after the Thirty Years’ War.\n\nThe Historic City Hall is located at Prinzipalmarkt in the heart of the historic district. The buildings around Prinzipalmarkt are all very impressive with their decorative gables. An arcade at street level protects pedestrians from wind and rain. Today the Prinzipalmarkt is a pedestrian street with numerous shops and stores."
