        "text": "by Janis / 24 comments - Orginally published:1st November 2019\n\nMünster a city of incredible history, a tower keeper and one or two cyclists\n\nAhh, Münster, Germany, isn’t it wonderful when a charming city lives up to your expectations? and Münster in the Westphalia, did just that?\n\nAttractive gabled buildings along the cobbled street of Prinzipalmarkt, the eye-catching central cathedral, St. Lambert's Church and a beautiful Gothic Rathaus. Ohh, and that was just the start.\n\nMünster, Germany, is perfect for a weekend break any time of the year; however, if you love discovering Germany at yuletide, then visit Münster's Christmas Markets.\n\nWhy not Pin it for later?\n\nThe view from Café 1648, Münster\n\nWhere is Münster\n\nHow to get to Münster\n\n- By Air\n\nStart creating your own Münster adventure and discover the ancient history amongst the charming city streets.\n\nSearch for your flights in one easy place with ebookers.com. Over 400 airlines are scanned for your favoured routes and chosen dates. Then hop on a train for around 1 hour, and you’re there.\n\n- By Car\n\nIf your venturing from the UK, jump on Le Shuttle and tour to Münster under your own steam. Alternatively, it’s so easy to visit on a road trip. Rental Cars searches multiple well-known car hire brands and discovers the deals that suit you the best.\n\nWhy not stopover in Aachen on the way?\n\nDiscovering Münster\n\nIt starts with a city tour\n\nWith so many tales of ancient history, a rebellion, and the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia, ending the Thirty Years' War in 1648. Gary and I jumped at the chance of joining a 2-hour guided walking tour.\n\nHistorical lamps through Münster\n\nOur tour was organised through Münster Marketing with Annette from Stadt-Lupe.\n\nAnnette, our guide, took us on an incredibly interesting informal tour of Münster.\n\nExplaining how the centuries of history, intrigue and turmoil shaped Münster into the friendly city, it is today.\n\nThings to do in Münster\n\nVisit St Paulus Dom: - get your timing right to here the Astronomical clock chime\n\nFeel History in the \"Hall of peace\"\n\nTake in some culture at the LWL Museum, the Kunstmuseum Pablo Picasso or the Stadtmuseum Münster\n\nDon't miss the Tower Keeper at the St. Lamberti\n\nIf the weather's fine head to Aasee Park\n\nEnjoy the city at Christmas\n\nGrab your Münster Card\n\nWhether you are located in the heart of Münster or just out of the centre, the Münster Card will come in very useful. With unlimited free public transport, we could easily pop into the city. You pick and choose what suits you best, whether you love museums, galleries, guided tours the Münster Card has it all.\n\nThe History of Münster\n\nMünster Rathaus\n\nMünster City’s town hall like in so many others in Germany cities takes pride of place in the heart of the town. Standing elegant and proud, Munster’s Rathaus has many stories to tell.\n\nThe gothic building has been lovingly restored in the 1950s to its original character from the mid-14th-century.\n\nThe Münster Rathaus at dusk\n\nThe Friedenssaal “Hall of Peace” located within the Rathaus, is the most important room in the historic town hall. It’s within these four walls that the Spanish-Dutch Peace Treaty was ratified in May 1648. It’s also here in October of the same year that the Thirty Years’ War ended with the signing of the Peace of Westphalia.\n\nOriginal wood panelling in the “Hall of Peace”, Münster\n\nThe Friedenssaal has been preserved in its original state with portraits of the key figures involved in bringing to an end this awful war. The original wood panelling and seats were returned after being kept in storage during WWII.\n\nFireplace inside the “Hall of Peace”, Münster\n\nEnsure you book your slot to visit the Friedenssaal it is a spectacular hall. You can enter free of charge with your Münster Card.\n\nStay informed\n\nWhy not subscribe to our monthly newsletter for some travel inspiration, some tips and find out what we've been up to?\n\nOr alternatively, why not follow us on your favourite social media channel?\n\nReasons to visit Münster\n\nMünster Stadtweinhaus\n\nThe stadtweinhaus, the cities wine store stands pride of place next door to Munster Rathaus. Who can blame them for keeping an eye on it? Restored to its original glory from 1615, the stadtweinhaus house once housed the city scales and wine stores.\n\nStadtweinhaus on Prinzipalmarkt, Münster\n\nStadtweinhaus, Münster – city wine store\n\nThe external balcony on the wine store was used to make important city announcements.\n\nMünster Dom\n\nThe Cathedral with the special clock\n\nThe prominent St. Paulus Cathedral takes pride of place in the centre of Munster city. It has been restored to its original 13th-century late Romanesque and Gothic style architecture.\n\nSt Paulus Dom, Münster\n\nInside St Paulus Dom, Münster\n\nOne of the Dom’s unique charms is the 16th-century Astronomical Clock. The magnificent clock chimes at 12 noon every Monday to Saturday and 12:30pm on a Sunday and public holidays.\n\nAstronomical Clock in St Paulus Dom, Münster\n\nIt’s incredible to watch as the top section revolves depicting the adoration of the magi.\n\nMarket Day\n\nIf you’re visiting Münster on a Saturday or Wednesday, be sure to head to the traditional morning market located around the base of the Cathedral. Lots of local produce and always the bustling heart of any town or city.\n\nShopping in Münster\n\nMünster Prinzipalmarkt\n\nThe main street through Münster is the historic Prinzipalmarkt.\n\nLined with beautiful gabled buildings, this wide road would have always been a busy market street.\n\nFull of locals purchasing their goods from merchants and market traders.\n\nPrinzipalmarkt, Münster\n\nGiving Münster city’s Prince Bishop quite a resounding impression that the Münster townsfolk were building their own wealth.\n\nToday you can still imagine how this prosperous city would have looked. The arched colonnades have upmarket, stylish stores lining the magnificent buildings, giving a feel of wealth and pride.\n\nPrinzipalmarkt, Münster at night\n\nI love nothing more than planning a trip and so often I use the DK Eyewitness books. I find them extremely informative, easy to follow and the pictures and maps tempt you into discovering more.\n\nWe used a previous version of this book to plan our Germany road trips, now you can grab the revised copy.\n\nMünster and the Anabaptist rebellion\n\nSt. Lamberti and its gruesome tales\n\nAt the end of Prinzipalmarkt is St Lamberti Church. At first glance, you may be thinking it looks like many other churches, we particularly thought it had a resemblance to Cologne’s beautiful cathedral.\n\nSt. Lamberti Church, Münster\n\nSt. Lamberti Church, Münster at night\n\nHowever, take a closer look at the tower, and you’ll see three iron cages, hanging on the side. The three cages have a gruesome story to share. As it is here that three bodies of the Anabaptist rebels were left on display after being tortured and murdered.\n\nThe three iron Anabaptist cages\n\nAn Anabaptist cage close-up\n\nIn the mid-16th-century, the Anabaptists tried unsuccessfully to convert Munster from Catholicism to Protestantism. Their bodies were then hung on display as an act of warning to the town.\n\nThe original cages remain and as part of the Munster city’s public art. In 1987 three faint lights were placed inside as part of the city’s art exhibition, to denote their three souls.\n\nMaintaining traditions in Münster\n\nMünster’s Tower Keeper\n\nAs a little behind the scenes treat, we were given the opportunity to visit Münster’s Tower Keeper. Martje Salje has been the very proud holder of the Tower Keepers role since 2014. Martje is also the first lady to hold this role in over 630 years.\n\nSt. Lamberti, Münster, Tower Keeper’s Door\n\nThe Tower Keeper’s plaque, St. Lamberti\n\nIt was an incredible experience, even climbing the 300 spiralling stone steps. When we reached the top, it was magnificent and the night skyline across the city breath-taking.\n\nWhen we chatted to Martje, she was completely honoured to have been given this historical role and privileged to be carrying on the tradition for Münster.\n\nMartje the Tower Keeper at St. Lamberti, Münster\n\nMünster Cathedral from St Lamberti Tower\n\nEach evening, except Tuesday, the Tower Keeper blows the horn from the top of the tower. In the direction of north, south and west at 9pm until midnight, every 30 minutes. Unless there is anything untoward, Martje sounds the all-clear toot, that the city of Münster is free from fires or enemies beyond.\n\nHorn of the Münster Tower Keeper\n\nWe peer over the top of the 246 feet (75 metres) vantage point.\n\nAs this is such an iconic tradition, we see people waiting in the streets below for Tower Keepers nightly call.\n\nThere’s more to Münster, Germany\n\nArchitecture & style\n\nAs we stroll further around the city, there are more and more interesting buildings to see. The Baroque architect Johann Conrad Schlaun left his mark in a few places in the city. The Erbdrostenhof Baroque palace, which was built between 1753 and 1757, and to make more of an impact the palace is positioned diagonally on a rectangular site.\n\nErbdrostenhof, Münster Baroque palace\n\nAnother of Schlaun’s work is the circular Baroque church Clemenskirche, built between 1745 and 1753. It’s quite eye-catching on the outside, however, once you step inside the Rococo styling is incredible.\n\nClemenskirche, Münster\n\nThe Rococo styling in Clemenskirche, Münster\n\nAnother attractive and important church in Münster is Überwasserkirche, a hall church. Located just nearby the cathedral and along the banks of the River Aa.\n\nÜberwasserkirche, Münster\n\nOpposite here is also a bookshop that is used in a popular German TV detective series “Wilsberg”.\n\nMünster's café with a view\n\nTime for a coffee break\n\nIf you are in need of a well-deserved break, I would highly recommend heading up to the recently opened rooftop café “1648”.

However, there are always more to delightful qualities to keep an eye out for.\n\nFirstly, the six carillons (glockenspiels) located around the town, there is the one I mentioned in the Dom. Another on Nonhoff House along Rothenburg but see if you can spot the others.\n\nCarillon (glockenspiel) on Nonhoff House\n\nThe Kiepenkerl Fountain, Münster\n\nAlso, the Kiepenkerl statue and fountain, located by Bergstrasse. This charming statue depicts the local roaming merchant in the Münsterland. They roamed from the town to the countryside carrying their laden down panniers, \"Kiepe\".\n\nOne thing that certainly will not go unnoticed during your visit to Münster is the number of bikes and how well the city has become very bike-friendly.\n\nThere are on average 2 to 3 bicycles per person in Münster, and lots of the streets are now for only bikes and public transport. They even have dedicated underground bike parks, just like a car park to keep your bike safe during the day.\n\nBicycles along Kreuzstrasse, Münster\n\nBicycles getting festive in October\n\nOur video from Münster\n\nOur experience of the city\n\nWe have created a little YouTube video of time in Münster - we hope you enjoy it.\n\nAlso, why not subscribe to our YouTube channel and get the latest clips as we post them?\n\nWhere to stay in Münster\n\nElegant & charming accomodation\n\nSchloss Wilkinghege, Münster\n\nDuring our stay in Münster, we were hosted by Schloss Wilkinghege.
