        "text": "St. Paulus Dom (Munster Cathedral), Munster (must see)\n\nIn the heart of this German city, you'll find Munster Cathedral, known as Saint Paulus Dom (The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul). This Catholic church features mainly Gothic architecture, constructed in the 13th century. There are two large Romanesque-style towers preserved from an earlier cathedral that was located at this site. The towers are topped with copper-covered pyramids.\n\nThe church interior features a central nave surrounded by two side aisles. As you enter, you'll be greeted by a sizable statue of Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, standing on a pillar on one side of the nave. This sculpture dates from 1627. The Old Choir (Alte Chor) boasts a Baroque-style high altar that sits below round decorative windows.

An extensive restoration also took place in the 21st century, completed in 2013.\n\nToday, this beautiful cathedral offers regular church services and public tours.

The Weekly Market (Wochenmarkt), a vibrant farmer's market, is held twice weekly (Wednesday and Saturday) in the cathedral square.\n\nMunster's Religious Buildings Tour\n\nMunster, a German city steeped in history and religious significance, boasts a myriad of places of worship that have withstood the test of time.
