It has about 18 million inhabitants and comprises 34,080 km² (13,158 square miles) in western-northwestern Germany. North Rhine-Westphalia contributes about 22 percent of Germany's gross domestic product; its capital is Düsseldorf.\n\nContents\n\nGeography\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia borders on (from the west and clockwise) Belgium, the Netherlands, and the German states of Lower Saxony, Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate.\n\nThe state is centred on the sprawling Rhine-Ruhr urbanised region, which contains the cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf, and Bonn, as well as the Ruhr industrial complex. The Ruhr area consists, among others, of the cities of Essen, Dortmund, Duisburg, Bochum and Gelsenkirchen.\n\nFor many people North Rhine-Westphalia is synonymous with industrial areas and agglomerating cities. But the largest part of the state is covered with forests and fields. The southern parts of the Teutoburg Forest are located in the northeast. In the southwest, North Rhine-Westphalia shares in a small part of the Eifel, located on the borders with Belgium and Rhineland-Palatinate. The southeast is occupied by the sparsely populated regions of Sauerland and Siegerland. The northwestern areas of the state are part of the Northern European Lowlands.\n\nThe most important rivers that run at least partially through North Rhine-Westphalia include: Rhine, Ruhr, Ems, Lippe and Weser.\n\nSee also List of places in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nThe state consists of 5 administrative regions (Regierungsbezirke), divided into 31 districts (Kreise) and 23 urban districts (kreisfreie Städte). In total, North Rhine-Westphalia has 396 municipalities (1997), including the urban districts, which are municipalities by themselves.\n\nThe districts of North Rhine-Westphalia:\n\nMissing image\n\nNorth_rhine_w_map.jpg\n\nimage:north_rhine_w_map.jpg\n\nAachen\n\nBorken\n\nCoesfeld\n\nDüren\n\nEnnepe-Ruhr\n\nRhein-Erft-Kreis\n\nEuskirchen\n\nGütersloh\n\nHeinsberg\n\nHerford\n\nHochsauerland\n\nHöxter\n\nCleves (Kleve)\n\nLippe\n\nMärkischer Kreis\n\nMettmann\n\nMinden-Lübbecke\n\nRhein-Kreis Neuss\n\nOberbergischer Kreis\n\nOlpe\n\nPaderborn\n\nRecklinghausen\n\nRheinisch-Bergischer Kreis\n\nRhein-Sieg\n\nSiegen-Wittgenstein\n\nSoest\n\nSteinfurt\n\nUnna\n\nViersen\n\nWarendorf\n\nWesel\n\nThe independent cities, which do not belong to any district:\n\nAachen\n\nBielefeld\n\nBochum\n\nBonn\n\nBottrop\n\nCologne (Köln)\n\nDortmund\n\nDuisburg\n\nDüsseldorf\n\nEssen\n\nGelsenkirchen\n\nHagen\n\nHamm\n\nHerne\n\nKrefeld\n\nLeverkusen\n\nMönchengladbach\n\nMülheim\n\nMünster\n\nOberhausen\n\nRemscheid\n\nSolingen\n\nWuppertal\n\nThe five administrative regions, belonging to one of two Landschaftsverbände:\n\nNordrhein\n\nCologne\n\nDüsseldorf\n\nWestfalen-Lippe\n\nArnsberg\n\nMünster\n\nDetmold\n\nHistory\n\nThe state of North Rhine-Westphalia was established by the British military administration in 1947. Originally it consisted of Westphalia and the northern parts of the Rhine Province, both formerly belonging to Prussia. In 1947 the former state of Lippe was merged with North Rhine-Westphalia, hence leading to the present borders of the state.\n\nThe North Rhine-Westphalia state election on May 22, 2005 granted the CDU a landslide victory. Their top candidate Jürgen Rüttgers will now build a new coalition government consisting of CDU and FDP that will replace the incumbent government headed by Peer Steinbrück. Rüttgers will soon be elected new Minister President of the state.\n\nFlag\n\nThe flag of North Rhine-Westphalia is green-white-red with the combined coats of arms of the Prussian Rhine province (white line before green background), Westphalia (the white horse) and Lippe (the red rose).\n\nAccording to legend the horse in the Westphalian coat of arms is the horse that the Saxonian leader Widukind rode after his baptism. Other theories attribute the horse to Henry the Lion.\n\nList of Minister-presidents of North Rhine-Westphalia\n\n1946 - 1947: Rudolf Amelunxen (Zentrum)\n\n1947 - 1956: Karl Arnold (CDU)\n\n1956 - 1958: Fritz Steinhoff (SPD)\n\n1958 - 1966: Franz Meyers (CDU)\n\n1966 - 1978: Heinz Kühn (SPD)\n\n1978 - 1998: Johannes Rau (SPD)\n\n1998 - 2002: Wolfgang Clement (SPD)\n\n2002 - incumbent: Peer Steinbrück (SPD)\n\nFollowing the defeat of the ruling SPG/Green coalition in the election of May 22 2005, Jürgen Rüttgers (CDU) will become the new Minister-president once elected by the new parliament.\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial governmental portal (http://www.nrw.de/)\n\nTourism (http://www.nrw-tourismus.de/)"
