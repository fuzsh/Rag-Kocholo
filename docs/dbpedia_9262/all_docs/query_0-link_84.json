        "text": "In 1180, at the fall of Heinrich dem Löwen, the Herzogtum Westfalen (Duchy of Westphalia) was formed from the southwestern part of Sachsen (eastern Sauerland with northern bordering areas south of the river Lippe). At that time, the Duchy of Westphalia belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Cologne.\n\nFrom 1803 (Reichsdeputationshauptschluss) the Duchy of Westphalia came to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel and was one of the three divisions of the Landgraviate.\n\nIn 1807-1810 Westphalia was broken up and the northern part came to the Grand Duchy of Berg, the southern part to Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nIn 1815/1816, the area and other territories (roughly today's Westphalia) fell to Prussia and from then until 1945 formed the Province of Westphalia of the Kingdom/Free State of Prussia. In 1949, it was merged with the Prussian Rhine Province to form the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nThe Königreich Westphalen (Kingdom of Westphalia) was created in 1807 (the Duchy of Westphalia was never part of this kingdom); it disintegrated in 1813 and most of its parts went to the re-established Hessen-Kassel."
