The state of North Rhine-Westphalia is full of diversity. Its landscapes and people are just as varied as the different economic regions that Germany's most populous federal state has to offer. Both NRW companies and foreign investors find optimal prospects for success and growth here. The economic strength of the state with its export and innovation-strong business landscape goes hand in hand with the attractiveness of the location for international companies."
