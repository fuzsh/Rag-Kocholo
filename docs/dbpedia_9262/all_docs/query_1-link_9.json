        "text": "North Rhine-Westphalia (German Nordrhein-Westfalen) is the most populous state in Germany, with 17.5 million inhabitants, located in the west of the country. It consists of two historically independent parts: Nordrhein, the urbanized area across the river Rhine in the southwest, and Westfalen in the northeast, which is quite diverse as it includes both the heavily industrialized and densely populated Ruhr Valley and the very green Teutoburg Forest.\n\nThe region contains several of the most-often visited cities of Germany, both for business and pleasure. Here you can find numerous headquarters of Germany's large and mid-sized corporations, European outposts of Asian and American multinationals, as well as world-renowned factories. Many of the globally important trade fairs take place in Düsseldorf and Cologne, the latter is also a major cultural centre. The beautiful historic city of Bonn was West Germany's de facto capital until 1990 and still contains many federal institutions, both governmental and cultural.\n\nWith the large population accumulated within a small area, as well as equally sizeable tourist traffic, North Rhine-Westphalia possesses the appropriate transportation infrastructure, with three major international airports and a very efficient – if sometimes overcrowded – railway and motorway network. NRW, as it is frequently abbreviated, also contains the first \"cycle highway\" of Germany which is planned to grow to over 100 km of fully grade separated extra broad cycle route. Accommodation and gastronomic opportunities are aplenty as well. There is always a lot going on and getting between destinations is easy and quick.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia (often abbreviated to NRW) is a German state founded after World War II by British occupation authorities. The state capital is Dusseldorf while Cologne is the most populous city. It consists of, as the name indicates, the province Westphalia in the east and the northern Rhinelands in the west. The hyphen symbolizes the attempt to bind people and regions that are so very different and stands also for the gap between the ethnic groups. This gap runs from the south-east to the north-west for 283 km across the state.\n\nWhile the Rhineland is famous for its carnival and the \"Rheinische Frohnatur\" is a cliché throughout Germany, the Westphalians are said to be much more reserved and introverted. All over the state, but especially in its former industrial heart, migration has played a major role since at least the 19th century. Last names give an indication where much of the labour force came from when coal and steel built a nation and the stars of Schalke 04 during its glory days in the 1930s had names like Kuzorra or Szepan. Today the descendants of the earliest immigrants are hard to distinguish from people whose ancestors lived here even earlier, but new migrations of Turks, Italians and Yugoslavs after the war have left their mark on certain neighbourhoods – not least in the ubiquitous (and delicious) döner and pizza restaurants.\n\nThe geography is also varied from the Cologne \"bight\" (Kölner Bucht) that represents the southernmost reaches of the North German Lowlands to the moderately high mountain ranges that surround it, like the Eifel or the Sauerland. In general the north is flatter than the south and the west is more urbanized than the east.\n\nIn the middle of all aspects, geographic and ethnic, lies the Ruhr Area (Ruhrgebiet), the name of the river at whose banks the region is situated. It arose during the past 150 years by immigrants from all over Europe but has strong roots in Westphalia and the Rhinelands as well. The region was and still is the heart of heavy industry in Germany, based on coal and steel. Although mining has mostly come to an end, the people strongly derive their identity from heavy industry. And there are still some successful manufacturers of specialist steel or products made from it. Car manufacturers like Opel in Bochum were once thought of as the replacement for heavy industries, but they are in the news more for threatened closures and layoffs than anything else. The City of Essen was named European Capital of Culture in 2010. This gave a boost to the cultural scene in the region, put it on the map for something other than \"rust belt\" doom and gloom, and helped right many inaccurate stereotypes about the region. Finally, Dortmund is internationally known for its football club Borussia Dortmund, which has managed to carve out one of the most respectable club images in world football.\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia has about 18 million inhabitants, which makes it the most populous state in Germany and the fourth largest in area. The Ruhr is the third or fourth largest urban region in the European Union, after London and Paris and either ahead of or behind Madrid. Also, 34 of the 100 largest companies in Germany and 9 of the 100 largest European companies have their headquarters in North Rhine-Westphalia. Despite this, the region was hit hard by deindustrialization, and while many cities have managed to diversify their economies, others are still struggling to move on.\n\nTourist information\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia tourism website\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nIn most large cities the regular Hochdeutsch is spoken everyday, due to the communities there being mixtures of locals and immigrants from all parts of Germany, Europe and the world. The local dialects are mostly present in the form of unique vocabulary, otherwise you should find local German easy to understand (if you know any, that is).\n\nThe area, particularly the economic heartland of the Ruhr, has been a destination for millions of immigrants since the mid-19th century. As a result, immigrant languages can be found spoken by many. However, although someone has, for example, an ethnically Polish last name, they may not speak or think of themselves as Polish — their ancestors may have come to the area before the German Empire was even founded.\n\nIn larger cities, English can be spoken by those performing service jobs, and chances are any person you encounter will speak at least basic English too. This is not a rule, and you may still encounter people, mostly seniors, who do not speak communicative English.\n\nThanks to a history of immigration and the region's geographic location, it can be possible to hear languages such as Arabic, Dutch, French, Italian, Polish, and Turkish in major cities."
