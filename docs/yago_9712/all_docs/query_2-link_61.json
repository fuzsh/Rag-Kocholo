        "text": "Even if you're staying at Ocho Rios or Port Antonio, you may want to visit Kingston, Port Royal, and Spanish Town to sightsee.\n\nIn Town--The most important art collection in Jamaica is housed at the National Gallery, Roy West Building, Kingston Mall (tel. 876/922-1561). This gallery is a showcase for the nation's most talented artists. On the ground floor you're greeted with the controversial bronze statue of the late Bob Marley, the reggae great. A work by Christopher Gonzalez, the statue originally was meant to stand in Celebrity Park, but aroused opposition among Marley fans, who felt it portrayed their hero in an unflattering light. You be the art critic here.\n\nThe Jamaican School of Art is best highlighted by Edna Manley, a well-known sculptor who was married to Norman Manley, the former prime minister. She was also the mother of another prime minister, Michael Manley. Locals refer to her as the \"Barbara Bush of Jamaica.\" She died in 1876 at the age of 86. One of her most celebrated sculptures is Ghetto Mother, located in the main lobby.\n\nAlso attracting a lot of attention locally are the mahogany figurines and other works by Mallica Reynolds, better known as Kapo. His religious themes have made him a household word in Kingston. Some art critics have called his sculpture \"the work of a modern genius.\"\n\nEntrance is $1.50 for adults and $1 for children, and hours are Tuesday to Thursday 10am to 4:30pm, Friday 10am to 4pm, and Saturday 10am to 3pm. You'll better understand what you're seeing if you hire a guide, which costs J$800 (US$13) for a tour.\n\nOne of the major attractions, Devon House, 26 Hope Rd. (tel. 876/929-6602), was built in 1881 by George Stiebel, a Jamaican who made his fortune mining in Latin America-becoming one of the first black millionaires in the Caribbean. A striking classical building, the house has been restored to its original beauty by the Jamaican National Trust. The grounds contain crafts shops, boutiques, two restaurants, shops that sell the best ice cream in Jamaica (in exotic fruit flavors), and a bakery and pastry shop with Jamaican puddings and desserts. Admission to the main house is $6; hours are Monday to Saturday from 9:30am to 5pm. Admission to shops and restaurants is free.\n\nAt the Hope Botanical Gardens & Zoo, Hope Road (tel. 876/927-1257), you can visit a Jamaican Shangri-La, a 20-hectare (50-acre) plot of beauty and the largest botanical garden in the West Indies. It is adjacent to the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies. The \"Hope\" in the name comes from Richard Hope, a British Army commander who lived here in the mid-17th century. After the grime of downtown Kingston, it's a lovely place for a tranquil stroll; attractions include a cactus garden, sago palms, an orchid house, various greenhouses, an ornamental pond, and a \"forest garden,\" with an aviary for the \"birdie\" in you. There's also a little zoo on-site.\n\nThe admission-free gardens are open daily from 6am (we like to go very early in the morning) to 6pm. The zoo is open daily from 10:30am to 5pm, charging an admission of J$20 (US35¢) for adults or J$10 (US15¢) for children 4 to 12. There's also a cafe offering cold drinks and light snacks.\n\nBetween Old Hope and Mona roads, on the eastern outskirts, a short distance from the Botanical Gardens, is the University of the West Indies (tel. 876/927-1660), built in 1948 on the Mona Sugar Estate. Ruins of old mills, storehouses, and aqueducts are juxtaposed with modern buildings on what must be the most beautifully situated campus in the world. The chapel, an old sugar-factory building, was transported stone by stone from Trelawny and rebuilt. The remains of the original sugar factory here are well preserved and give a good idea of how sugar was made in slave days. Organized tours are available. You are also allowed to stroll around the campus Monday to Saturday from 9am to 5pm. You must see the Public Relations office first.\n\nThe National Library of Jamaica at the Institute of Jamaica, 12 East St. (tel. 876/967-2494), a storehouse of the history, culture, and traditions of Jamaica and the Caribbean, is the finest working library for West Indian studies in the world. It has the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and balanced collection of materials on the region, including books, newspapers, photographs, maps, and prints. It's open Monday to Thursday from 9am to 5pm, Friday from 9am to 4pm.\n\nBob Marley Museum, 56 Hope Rd. (tel. 876/927-9152), is the most-visited sight in Kingston, but if you're not a Marley fan, it may not mean much to you. The clapboard house with its garden and high surrounding wall was the famous reggae singer's home and recording studio until his death on May 11, 1981, in a Miami hospital. You can tour the house and view assorted Marley memorabilia, and you may even catch a glimpse of his children, who often visit the grounds. Hours are Monday to Saturday from 9:30am to 4pm. Admission is J$500 (US$8.30) for adults, J$400 (US$6.65) for children 13 to 18, and J$200 (US$3.30) for children 4 to 12. It's reached by bus no. 70 or 75 from Halfway Tree, but take a cab to save yourself the hassle of dealing with Kingston public transportation."
