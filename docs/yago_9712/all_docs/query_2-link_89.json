        "text": "The Statue of Kouros\n\n782 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe Statue of a kouros and the Portrait statue of a boy both depict similar subjects, however are greatly different in how they accomplish this task. Through detail, or lack there of, the Greeks and Romans are able to display a certain value they have in its members. These two statues were made about 500 years apart and approach the sculpting process quit differently. The Greek statue seems to use geometric exaggerated lines to form the body while the Romans use a more realistic approach and sculpt the body with a more rounded finish. Statue of a kouros, from about 590 B.C and Portrait of a boy, from about the first century, do not share any great technical aspects and are basically nothing alike.\n\nCritical Analysis Of Romare Bearden's The Family, 1941\n\n1303 Words | 3 Pages\n\nI will compare the emotions that both artworks send to the viewers when they first look at them. When I look at the portray 1, I fell sadness. That’s what the artwork is conveying to me. No one in the picture is happy or smiling. Everyone is sad, upset or indifferent. When we look at their gaze, the father is looking traight away, with tired eyes. His gesture shows that he doesn’t want to hear what his wife has to say and is asking her to stop. The mother’s gaze is on something in front of them. Her eyes are big and she seems to be giving more attention to things than the man. She seems sad sad to be spoken that way. On portray 2, the atmosphere is visibly different. The man and woman have a little smile on their faces and the kids are playing next to them. The people in the portray don’t look indifferent to each other or sad like in the other portray, they look pleased and caring. The man and women gaze are relaxed and they seem to be enjoying themselves. They are looking straight away in a pose as if someone is taking a picture of them. The kids gaze are in their\n\nThe Role of Female African American Sculptors in the Harlem Renaissance\n\n1699 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance, a time of global appreciation for the black culture, was a door opening for African American women. Until then, African Americans, let alone African American women, were neither respected nor recognized in the artistic world. During this time of this New Negro Movement, women sculptors were able to connect their heritages with the present issues in America. There is an abundance of culture and history to be learned from these sculptures because the artists creatively intertwine both. Meta Warrick Fuller and Edmonia Lewis, two of the most popular sculptors of this time, were able to reflect their native heritages and the dynamics of society through their artwork.\n\nKing Khafre Seated\n\n1079 Words | 3 Pages\n\nEgyptian art is infamous across the world - classified by the monumental pyramids, and the Sphinx. Although these are both valid forms of Egyptian art, they do not make up the entire artistic history of the country. On the contrary, perhaps the most replicated example of classic Egyptian art, from the Old Kingdom, can be found in their rendering of the human form. An interest in portraiture developed early in Egypt. (Gardner, 75) Whether painted on pottery, or cut into rock, the figures all had notably Egyptian characteristics. \"The seated statue is one of only a very small number of basic formulaic types employed by the sculptors of the Old Kingdom.\" (Gardner, 75)\n\nStrength, Serenity, and Idealism\n\n665 Words | 2 Pages\n\nWhen beginning my sketch, I took a moment to analyze the work of art and found that the statue illuminated a sense of serenity. Like most viewers my initial reaction was to explore the statue from head to toe as I sought out the different elements and principles of art. The statue was close to life-size and just about my height, so looking straightforward we were eye to eye. I noticed the softness gathered about the facial structure, but all the same time the depth and complexity that was engulfed around the muscularity of the body. The rigorous symmetry was accounte...\n\nArt Analysis\n\n965 Words | 2 Pages\n\nBoth of these pieces of art have much in common. Their functions are almost identical. Both were used to mark burial sites and to honor the deceased buried there. The body language of both the pieces’ figures are similar, with one seated and several others standing around them. Neither has color, but unlike the grave stele, the funerary banquet does show some degree of emotion. The figures in the banquet scene have slight smiles. These pieces played an important role in their times, honoring those who had passed on to the afterlife. For both of these people, it was important to memorialize them very similar to our practices today.\n\nSeparate Spheres In Chopin's The Awakening\n\n649 Words | 2 Pages\n\nStarting merely as a small hobby, her first dip of freedom opened Edna up to ferocious artistry. Finding a companion in Mademoiselle Reisz, the raw talent and compassion Mademoiselle puts into her work stirs Edna internally in a way she has never felt before. This is another stab at the society she finds herself to be in, for intellectual artistry was not meant for women to be an escape for themselves, but merely entertainment for others. Music becomes a therapy for Edna and opens her up to further creativity that she hadn’t given herself\n\nWhat Is Edna Pontellier's Sacrifice In The Awakening\n\n905 Words | 2 Pages\n\nWhen her husband and children are gone, she moves out of the house and purses her own ambitions. She starts painting and feeling happier. “There were days when she was very happy without knowing why. She was happy to be alive and breathing when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some perfect Southern day” (Chopin 69). Her sacrifice greatly contributed to her disobedient actions. Since she wanted to be free from a societal rule of a mother-woman that she never wanted to be in, she emphasizes her need for expression of her own passions. Her needs reflect the meaning of the work and other women too. The character of Edna conveys that women are also people who have dreams and desires they want to accomplish and not be pinned down by a stereotype.\n\nEdna's Awakening\n\n880 Words | 2 Pages\n\nEdna's Awakening Kate Chopin's \"The Awakening\" is a work of litature like none other I have read. It is not hard to imagine why this major work of Chopin's was banished for decades not long after its initial publication in 1899. Most of society did not like the fact that \"The Awakenings\" main character, Edna Pontellier, went against the socially acceptable role of women at that time. At that time in history, women did just what they were expected to do. They were expected to be good daughters, good wives, and good mothers.\n\nHow Is Edna St. Vincent Millay's Inequality\n\n217 Words | 1 Pages\n\nEdna St. Vincent Millay was born on February 22, 1892 in Rockland, Maine. During her childhood years, she grew up in an impoverished family. However, despite the fact that the family was poor, Cora Millay, her mother, continually supported her cultural advancement by exposing her to a mixture of reading materials and music lessons. The efforts of her mother eventually paid off when Millay became an accomplished poet. In an original work called Figs, Millay expresses the feelings of rebellion and desire for freedom within young teenagers. However, the ability to relate to her readers only represented one aspect of Millay’s versatility. Similar to another accomplished poet, Robert Frost, Millay had the ability to incorporate tradition forms\n\nEssay On Lucille Mulhall\n\n945 Words | 2 Pages\n\nLucille Mulhall was born on October 21, 1885 in Oklahoma and died December 21, 1940 in Oklahoma when she got in a terrible vehicle accident.

Her mother, Grace Satterlee Day was a New Yorker and her father, John Day, was from Tennessee. Dorothy had three brothers and a sister. At the age of six, John Day, her dad, had been relocated for his job and the family moved to Oakland. However, in 1906 he lost his job to the San Francisco earthquake. Unfortunately, the earthquake had destroyed the newspaper industry.

Those matters of kindness had really affected her and she could not forget them. On the other hand, due to the earthquake, the family moved to Chicago where they ended up living for the next twelve years of their lives.\n\nFrom Aphrodite Of Knidos To The Old Market Woman\n\n704 Words | 2 Pages\n\nTo conclude, both sculptures do not have much in common, but it is obvious that the artists had knowledge in human anatomy and was able to sculpt them spectacularly. It is also obvious the break from somewhat idealistic to realistic human nature. The change is so drastic that one might not believe that both sculptures come from the same Greece because it is so well-known for its astonishing artworks found in temples, building, etc."
