        "text": "Michael Manley (born December 10, 1924, St. Andrew, Jamaica—died March 6, 1997, Kingston) was a Jamaican politician who served three terms as prime minister of Jamaica (1972–80 and 1989–92) and was a powerful champion of Third World issues.\n\nHe was the son of noted sculptor Edna Swithenbank Manley and national hero Norman Manley, the cofounder of the People’s National Party (PNP) and Jamaica’s chief minister (1955–59) and premier (1959–62). Following service in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, he attended the London School of Economics, where he studied with socialist Harold Laski. After working as a freelance journalist in London, Manley returned to Jamaica in 1951 and went to work for Public Opinion, a leftist weekly newspaper. He soon became active in the trade-union movement, attaining positions of union leadership and gaining recognition as a skilled negotiator. In 1962 he was appointed to Jamaica’s Senate, and in 1967 he was elected to the House of Representatives. Two years later Manley succeeded his father as president of the PNP, and when the party won the election in 1972, he became prime minister."
