        "text": "The cultural ambassador spent the last 20 years of her life in Canada before passing away in 2006 at age 86.\n\nThe Miss Lou Archive is housed at McMaster University, a cultural room at Harbourfront Centre bears her name and York University bestowed her with an honourary degree in 1998.\n\nWatson, who has a soft spot for the late poet and folklorist because she was an artist, is open to the opportunity of creating a replica of the Miss Lou sculpture in Canada.\n\n“Miss Lou was highly revered in her adopted country and I think it would be tremendous to have something like that here,” he said. “On top of that, there are Caribbean nationals in Canada who excelled and deserve to be memorialized through art.”\n\nAs a University of the West Indies (UWI) Toronto Benefit Gala Luminary Award recipient, Watson will be in Toronto on June 25 to receive the honour.\n\nHis previous two visits to Canada were as a 10-year-old and a participant in a karate tournament a few years later.\n\n“To be recognized by a larger than life leading light Caribbean academic institution means a lot to me because it’s so much more meaningful when that honour comes from my people,” the 64-year-old artist, who has lived in Atlanta since 2002, said. “I always saw UWI as a very special place for the development of Caribbean people.”\n\nHaving a father who was one of Jamaica’s foremost artists made it easy for him to choose a career path at an early age.\n\nBarrington Watson, who in 1998 was honoured with an Award of Excellence by the Kingston College Old Boys’ Association (Toronto chapter), passed away in January 2016 at age 85.\n\n“I was told that when he brought home his paintings, I would stand in front them and stare,” he recounted. “His vision to see his life as an artist impressed me. If he could do it, so could I.”\n\nBesides his dad, Watson looked up to late Frenchman Auguste Rodin who is considered the founder of modern sculpture.\n\n“I learnt of him through my father who spoke glowingly of this man pushing sculpture beyond what Michelangelo had done,” the 6th degree Black belt holder and karate teacher said.\n\n‘Naked Came I’, a 1963 bestselling novel based on Rodin’s life, was one of Barrington Watson’s prized possessions.\n\n“I read that book at a fairly young age and started to research him,” said Watson who credits his mother, Gloria Watson, with teaching him empathy and the power of observation and sensitivity. “That’s where my fascination for him grew and the way in which he approached the human figure. What he did combined with my dad’s work heavily influenced the direction of my work.”\n\nSeeking an institution that provides an artistic education, he attended the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts.\n\nRespected painter Alexander Cooper, who died in March 2020, successfully encouraged Watson -- who he taught art at Kingston College -- to participate in his figure drawing classes at Edna Manley that was formerly the Jamaica School of Art & Crafts. (Barrington Watson was the institution’s first Director in 1962.)\n\nChristopher Gonzalez – who is best known for the 2.7-metre statue of Bob Marley that is on display in Ocho Rios – was Watson’s sculpture tutor in his first two years at Edna Manley.\n\n“Through his passion for sculpting and life, he influenced me to go into sculpture as my final medium,” he said.\n\nWhile at Edna Manley, Watson was also exposed to the teachings of George Rodney, one of the pioneers of the modern Jamaican art movement, ceramicist and sculpture Gene Pearson and painter Hope Brooks.\n\n“These Jamaican luminaries inspired me in a major way,” he pointed out. “The enthusiasm for the arts was extremely high as the transition was taking place from the Jamaica School of Art & Crafts to Edna Manley.”\n\nAt age 44 and well established in Jamaica, Watson migrated to the United States to expand his career.\n\n“I had already done a dozen or more public sculptures,” he noted. “But I was finding it difficult to make it on the international stage. That was around the time that social media was emerging and I was seeking a bigger platform. Living on an island also meant packaging and shipping. For my career, it thought the best thing for me would be to move to North America.”\n\nWith the art establishment falling in love with abstraction in the mid-20th century, figurative art became almost archaic.\n\nThe energy, vigor and emotive quality of the human figure intrigues Watson whose older brother Raymond is also a sculpture. It has also sustained and anchored his work.\n\n“When I started in the 1970s, the human figure was somewhat passé,” he said. “More abstractionism and expressionism were trending, but I had a passion for the figure which my father told me would return. There was a lot of experimentation in Jamaica at the time, but I stuck with the figure. Art has moved to a point where we are much more inclusive. It is no longer about one trend or the other. We can all co-exist speaking one language.”\n\nThree days before the Toronto honour, Watson’s first public artwork in England -- which is a tribute to the Windrush Generation – will be unveiled."
