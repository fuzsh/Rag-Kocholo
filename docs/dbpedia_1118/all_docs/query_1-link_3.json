        "text": "Posted by SME Zürich on Jun 7, 2021\n\nTo go with the title “Labyrinth”, Stefanie Heinzmann’s new album, her sixth, is all about the trials and tribulations of life. “As tricky as our lives might seem to us sometimes, it is down to us to find a way out of the maze”, she says. “It’s up to us to try out new routes and to change direction. Sometimes we might end up in a cul-de-sac, or we find ourselves going in circles. But that’s the great thing about a labyrinth. Almost always we find the exit.”\n\nStefanie Heinzmann ist one of the most successful Swiss pop stars of the last few years. Having won a vastly popular casting show on German television as a teenager, her debut album “Masterplan” hit the number one spot in Switzerland in 2008, remaining in the top 75 for a staggering forty weeks. Three more albums spent a combined 73 weeks in the charts before she took a four-year sabbatical in 2011. She returned in 2019 with “All We Need is Love”, another number 1 hit in Switzerland.\n\nThanks to the Corona lockdown, Heinzmann found herself with an unusual amount of time and freedom on her hands. Keen to find a creative release for the rich flow of new ideas, she relocated to Hamburg from her native Valais, to work with the producer of her last album, Steffen Graef. “Every day I went to the studio and asked myself the question: what style and which themes do I feel like trying out today? I realised that without festivals and people around me, I needed powerful and positive music I can dance\n\nto.” Which is a pretty accurate description of the musical contents of “Labyrinth”!\n\n“Labyrinth” was released on 14 May 2021 by Warner.\n\nStefanie Heinzmann"
