        "text": "After going up against 4 other hopefuls, FIA was chosen by a jury and the public to represent Germany at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2023.\n\nHer Junior Eurovision song is all about how she and her little sister Emilia communicate without words, and her sister even features in the music video. In fact, FIA says that her sister is her favourite superhero. Just like in Ohne Worte, FIA used sign language in her performances on The Voice Kids (Germany) in 2023.\n\nFamily is really important to FIA, and when she’s not spending time with her sister she’s hanging out with friends, swimming, or climbing.\n\nOhne Worte was written by 3 pop superstars. Songwriter Martin \"Fly\" Fliegenschmidt has had 5 million record sales, including 23 platinum and 14 gold awards. As well as working with top artists, he also fronts the indie rock band PARKA. Songwriter and producer David Jürgens not only works with top pop stars, but also composes film music. And musician, singer, and radio presenter Sascha Seelemann has been on stage with the likes of Jamie Cullum, Sarah Connor, and Stefanie Heinzmann.\n\nFIA was born in Shanghai, and her family moved back to Berlin when her little sister was born. But there are 2 more members of the family that we hope will be tuning into Junior Eurovision. Simba and Puschel are FIA’s two rabbits. FIA describes Puschel as a diva, who often ignores everyone else. Simba, however, likes a cuddle, and likes his food even more — so it's lucky that FIA has had a few thoughts about one day becoming a pastry chef. Carrot cake, anyone?\n\nFIA’s social media is full of cover songs, including one of Olivia Rodrigo’s Drivers License which she sings to her little sister. But if FIA had to choose her favourite pop star heroes, it would be Germany’s Eurovision Song Contest 2022 winner Lena (who was also her coach on The Voice Kids) and Lalisa from BLACKPINK.\n\nFIA spends most of her time singing and dancing, and she’s mastered every possible BLACKPINK routine. Her most treasured birthday present was even BLACKPINK tickets. Maybe they’ll be tuning in to see FIA on stage at Junior Eurovision.\n\nWith her family and friends being so important to FIA, we asked her what makes a good friend. She says: “A good friend should be honest, reliable, funny and likes me like I am.”\n\nYou can learn more about FIA right here.\n\nJunior Eurovision 2023 took place in Nice, France on Sunday 26 November and was won by Zoé Clauzure from France! You can rewatch it live via the official Junior Eurovision YouTube channel (if available in your country).\n\nAll 16 songs are available to watch on our YouTube channel and listen to the official album on all streaming platforms, and of course, you're invited to vote for your favourites too! How do I vote in Junior Eurovision? Here's how..."
