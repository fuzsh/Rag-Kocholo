        "text": "It was a night of celebrations as the Swiss music elite gathered in Zug for the 15th Swiss Music Awards. Known as Switzerland’s most prominent music awards ceremony, the Swiss Music Awards honor the best that the music industry produced during the previous year.\n\nHosts Marco Fritsche and Madeleine Sigrist added sparkle to the show, but the true star was none other than Joya Marleen. St. Gallen’s very own singer-songwriter took home three awards in three different categories – a great feat considering they were her first-ever nominations! Her debut single “Nightmare” was voted Best Hit by TV viewers via live voting. Not only that, but she also took home an SMA for Best Female Act and an SRF 3 award for Best Talent.\n\nTwice-nominated musician Kunz took to the stage twice to receive the Swiss Music Awards in both the Best Male Act and Best Album categories. And for the second time, Geneva singer Danitsa won Best Act Romandie, while ZIAN took home the Best Crushing Newcomer award. Aargaun band Mnevis was recognized with the prestigious Artist Award, a prize held in high esteem as it is awarded by other musicians.\n\nOne of the enchanting show’s greatest highlights was George Ezra’s energetic performance of his hit single “Anyone For You” on the Bossard Arena stage. In addition to the international acts, the Swiss music scene was also well represented: Kings Elliot, Loco Escrito, Naomi Lareine & Sektion Züri, TASHAN, Stress (with special guests Melanie Oesch and Stefanie Heinzmann), as well as Xen & EAZ took the show’s 2000+ attendees on a Swiss music journey.\n\nThe awards show promoted Swiss music through twelve categories, honoring young talents and artists on the rise. Luckily, all of Switzerland was able to watch the event via multiple online channels, as well as on television. The 15th Swiss Music Awards were sponsored by Generali Switzerland and Bank Cler."
