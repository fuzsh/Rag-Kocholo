        "text": "By the time y’all read this our 35th reunion will be in the books. Prior to reunion, however, I sent the following prompt to all ’90s: “We have all changed a lot since we graduated from Dartmouth 35 years ago, but how have you not changed since 1990?” Below is Part Two of your responses.\n\nCarolyn Choi writes, “Hello Kitty is still the object of lots of love from me, even at 55 years old!” Nick Stanham writes, “This is a tough one because externally a whole bunch has changed—we all get older and for some of us, our clothes fit a little tighter, we have less hair, etc., but something that has never changed is how much I love hanging around with my Dartmouth friends. It’s always a positive experience and somehow I feel smarter and a better all-around person when I do. That, and since I have been back living in Miami since 1994, I am still ‘Nick from Miami.’ ” Laura Jackson writes, “One thing that hasn’t changed for me is that I still love hanging out with Sandy Yusen, my freshman-year roommate. We just got back from a yoga and surfing trip in Costa Rica. I’m lucky to have seen many of my other ’90 friends recently, including Dea Follmer and my husband, Tim Cleary.”\n\nKristin Jacobson writes, “I think two things that have not changed about me are perseverance and resilience. The perseverance was more obvious in college, the resilience maybe not so much because things probably appeared to come easily to me and many of my biggest challenges had yet to arrive. Then, on two days in the same week of February 2005, my oldest son was diagnosed with autism and my middle and youngest sons were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. It wasn’t something I thought I’d be able to survive, but my perseverance and resilience got me through. I learned the lesson that parents must make sure to take care of themselves so they can care for their kids (put your own oxygen mask on first), something I did not remember to do. But I am resilient and overcame that as well. And recently I’ve faced another set of very significant health challenges myself. In December I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, and my health hit rock bottom. It’s a long story, but—as was true of me in college—I persevered.”\n\nGary Katz writes, “For me I’d say, ‘loyalty to and focus on my friends and family,’ but how good can I be at judging myself?” Kate Burnaby Wright writes, “For me, the thing that immediately popped into mind was Noel Perrin’s distillation of me: ‘pragmatic idealist.’ Or more precisely, as he wrote: ‘Kate is an idealist, but a pragmatic one.’ I suspect my friends would agree. Shoutout to all the amazing professors (and coaches) who offered us so, so much!” Ted Carleton, my Hanover Middle School baseball teammate, writes exactly what we all expected him to write: “Handsome as ever—or should I say brilliant? So many choices….”\n\nAnd in other class news, Walter Palmer is getting his revenge on coaches who made him sleep in six-foot beds on road trips. Recently his name popped up in The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, which depicted him as an advisor to NCAA teams (including our beloved Big Green men’s basketball team) curious about unionizing. Keep making history, Walt!\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nMagical, unexpected, thrilling, poignant things happen at college reunions, but if you’re not there, you won’t experience them. So please come to our 35th reunion in Hanover, June 13-16! In anticipation of our reunion, I sent the following prompt to ’90s: “We have all changed a lot since we graduated from Dartmouth 35 years ago, but how have you not changed since 1990?” Below is Part One of your responses.\n\nFirst, the dancers: Basia Nikonorow writes, “I still love to dance! (Gleefully remembering the loud and sweaty midweek dance nights at Collis and, later, ambling home across the Green by moonlight.)”\n\nBaeth Davis (check out her website at www.yourpurpose.com—amazing stuff!) writes, “I’m still a weirdo who will dance just about anywhere. Also, I hope everyone has hobbies for when artificial intelligence-tech implodes. I suspect we are only going to Mars in our minds. Besides, who needs spaceships when you can communicate telepathically? See you in June!” Ute Otley writes, “I’m still competitive as hell and I still love to dance!” Jennie Wadsworth writes, “Actually, I don’t think I’ve changed at all. I’m still a spaz and spill stuff and knock into things. I’m still absurdly optimistic even in the face of grim reality and am on a continual path of self-improvement. I still love coffee, dancing, and plunging in cold water. I’m still generally introverted but get excited when I am around people. How have I changed would be the harder question.”\n\nNext, the music lovers: Michael Keller writes, “I still listen to a lot of Rush.” Adam Bookbinder writes, “I still like all of the bands I liked in the 1980s: Springsteen, REM, Jimmy Buffett, Joe Jackson, Guns ’n’ Roses, Second Hand Jam, etc.” Roth Herrlinger writes, “I still love playing piano and giving hugs to people I care about.”\n\nQuincy Vale writes, “Still a big, big fan of Jethro Tull.” Laura (Van Wie) McGrory writes, “A cappella music somehow still features prominently in my life. Since graduating as a Dodecaphonic I’ve sung with a women’s barbershop group and a vocal jazz ensemble. I married a member of a rival college’s a cappella group and we managed to produce two college a cappella offspring (one a Dartmouth ’22 Brovertone) and have traveled stupid distances to see their concerts. See you in Hanover soon!”\n\nAnd finally, the 6-footers and the blondes: Jennifer Lowry writes, “I’m still tall—not Walter Palmer tall, of course, but I can still justify being 6’2”—especially in my running shoes and when my daughter tries to tell me that she’s taller than I am!”\n\nPaul Haffner writes, “Well, in really good news, I’m still 6’1” and about 170 pounds (with most of my hair)!” Ali Long writes, “I’m still the unassuming, unpretentious, girl-next-door blonde from Ohio.” Elizabeth Uphoff Courtney writes, “I still like to play pickleball and make TikTok videos while I sip on my venti strawberry acai lemonade. Oh, wait: That’s not me. In any case, I am still tall and blonde, and the nicest people in my life tell me I haven’t changed a bit. I live in Southport, Connecticut, with my family and can’t wait to see everyone at reunion.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nOur 35th reunion will take place June 13-16—which is less than four months away. Because of that nasty pandemic, we didn’t get to have a 30th reunion, so this will be the first time we’ve all gotten together in 10 years! Of course Joel Newton’s and Chris Newton’s law of Dartmouth reunions states that the depth of joy experienced by reunion attendees is directly proportional to the number of alumni who show up—the more, the merrier! Thus, this month, I asked ’90s who have already decided to attend reunion to write messages to the rest of our class, encouraging them to register. Here are your messages. Dave “Danger” Sherwood writes, “By now I think everyone’s heard about blue zones—places where people live longer due to strong community and healthy diets. Strong community is one of the greatest predictors of our health and happiness as we get older. In a similar light, Dartmouth is a green zone for all of us—the community we forged in 1986 still nourishes us to this day and gathering as a community in June will serve to strengthen that community. Live longer. Be happier. Come to reunion! And green is way cooler than blue…or brown…or crimson.” Megan Hammond writes, “Come, because if Covid taught us anything, it is that our greatest treasure is having a sense of community with people that matter to us.” John Stouffer writes, “Pretty simple message to friends on the fence: I’ll go if you go!” Josh Vogel writes, “Going to our 20th and 25th reunions dramatically reduced the power of my recurring nightmares about my actual college days. Ever since attending, even when I have missed the entire class, it’s time for the final and I can’t even get to the room to take it. Thanks to reunions, now at least I usually have my clothes on, which is so much better! This could happen for you too! Come to reunions and exorcise your demons!” Rob Crawford writes, “Contrary to popular belief, I am an introvert, not an extrovert. I have a slight fear of large gatherings such as college reunions. However, my experience at our 25th reunion revealed to me how important it is to overcome ‘reunion hesitations.’ At the conclusion of our 25th reunion, as I began my drive back home, I started bawling like a baby. Deep sobs. Why? I suspect it’s because those two and a half days in Hanover helped me rediscover the greatest rewards of life: relationships with other humans and personal growth. Plus, seeing close friends and friends I’d lost touch with and spending time with people I hardly knew when I was at Dartmouth revealed to me just how much of who I am was shaped by my four and a half years at ‘the College on the Hill’ and just how much of my heart will always be in Hanover. I suddenly realized the truth expressed in the lyrics of two Dartmouth songs I’ve sung countless times: ‘Dear Old Dartmouth,’ ‘Though ’round the girdled earth they roam, her spell on them remains,’ and ‘Dartmouth Undying,’ ‘Dartmouth—the gleaming, dreaming walls of Dartmouth—miraculously builded in our hearts.’ So, if you’re on the fence about attending our 35th reunion, it’s time to come down, down to the river. See you there!”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “If the new president of Dartmouth College, Sian Leah Beilock, were to meet with you one-on-one and ask, What do I need to know about Dartmouth? what would you tell her?” Here are your responses. John Aronsohn writes, “I would tell President Beilock that it’s time for Dartmouth to truly ‘lead.’ The Call to Lead was all about raising money and obviously that’s important for the College’s ability to grow and to stay competitive but I’d like to see more of what Sian has already done on mental health, for example, where she pulled together a group of former surgeons general to move the national discussion forward. Secondarily, I’d like to see Dartmouth look beyond the Ivy League for best practices on everything from admissions to alumni management. I’m excited about the fresh perspective and approach that Sian is bringing to our college.” Jack McBride writes, “I would tell President Beilock, ‘We care.’ Every member of the Dartmouth community—students, faculty, alumni, parents—cares deeply about Dartmouth College. We view the College as a home, family, guide, caregiver. We care about Dartmouth and the people who are a part of Dartmouth. We care about the students and their need for both education and nurture. We care that Dartmouth College remains a vibrant and active place for learning and growth. I had the opportunity to listen to President Beilock speak in person three nights ago. I am pleased to report that she already understands my answer from her talks with other people and that she has taken to heart the special nature of our college.” Eric Spencer writes, “The next building project at Dartmouth has to be renovating undergraduate dorms.” Gary Katz writes, “Dartmouth is a place that is ‘becoming.’ For its first 200 years it was the greatest college in the world. For the last 25 years it has been in the process of ‘becoming’ a second-rate university. My hope for you is to prevail over the inertial forces pushing this great institution to grow to the point of its own incompetence and demonstrate the profound impact a truly outstanding (and focused) college can have on its students, faculty, and the world.” And here’s some class news: Matthew Kelley writes, “My 2-year-old loved her inaugural journey to a Dartmouth football home game with my wife and me in early October. Our little girl especially enjoyed the band and the cheerleading squad! What a pleasant surprise it was to bump into an old teammate, Jason Lichstenstein, outside of Lou’s the following Sunday morning. Jason looks great and is lucky enough to reside a mile from campus.” Congratulations to Julie Clugage,whose nonprofit, Team4Tech (team4tech.org), was awarded an AARP Purpose Prize. Team4Tech helps people in under-resourced contexts around the world build the skills they need for high-quality employment. During the last decade it has supported more than 50 nonprofits with $19 million in grants and pro bono consulting services. And congratulations to Mel (Schneeberger) Robbins, who was recently included on Forbes’ “50 Over 50” list. The Mel Robbins Podcast has reached listeners in 194 countries and averages 1.5 million weekly downloads. Her channel on YouTube receives some 800,000 viewing hours per month and reaches close to 2 million subscribers. Mel is also the founder of the production company 143 Studios, and her two bestselling books have been published in 41 languages.\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nRecently, I asked ’90s, “What book from your Dartmouth academic career comes to mind first?” Here is Part III your responses: Jeff Buchsbaum writes, “The first is The Iliad. I read this freshman fall in a required seminar with the title ‘Memories of War.’ The second is Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, juxtaposed in the same class. Our professor was amazing and the class was designed to push us to realize that writers had been trying to educate their audiences on the horror of war so that it would not be repeated. To this day I still think about those books and that class.” Heather Block writes, “Things Fall Apart—of course.” Karen Behling writes, “Things Fall Apart—of course.” Dan Fuchs writes, “The one and only Things Fall Apart! Wait—did we actually have to read the book for it to count?”\n\nWilliam Boulware writes, “I remember Things Fall Apart, the debut novel by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe. Of the books I read while at Dartmouth, Sojourner Truth: Ain’t I a Woman? is memorable, not necessarily for the content but for the version of the book we read in freshman English called Aren’t I a Woman? As a child of North Carolina, I was exposed to this book in my home. I slowly raised my hand to challenge the correction of the book’s title and was then compelled (asked) to read aloud with my Southern drawl. Ah, memories.” Jeff Bedell writes, “Paradise Lost—and falling asleep in Sanborn trying to keep up with the reading assignments.”\n\nScot Paterson writes, “Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe, which I read in the class ‘Rise of the Novel.” It’s a perfect example of the rise of the trashy novel, and it’s a page-turner.” Basia Nikonorow writes, “The Color Purple. I read this in an excellent, memorable literature class focused on Black female authors taught by the legendary Professor Cook. The movie never lived up to the book. In fact, it’s one of the few movies I’ve ever walked out of in my whole life.” Satin Mirchandani writes, “The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. It was released at the beginning of junior fall, and it ignited all kinds of controversy, including the fatwa by Khomeini. The printers of the book were in such a hurry, they shipped the books without trimming the edges. I called the bookstore and when they confirmed they had one last copy available, I asked the gentleman on the phone to kindly hold it for me. He asked me for my name. I spelled it out for him: S-A-T-I-N. Long pause…‘You’re kidding, right?’ ”\n\nAnn (McDevitt) Miller writes, “War and Peace from a Tolstoy class our Sophomore Summer.” Sebastian de Atucha writes, “Hard Times by Studs Terkel. I read it in a freshman seminar with Blanche Gelfant. She taught this book so well. It’s a long book about the Great Depression that obliged me and my classmates to spend hours buried in the stacks, living through those hard times. It was like a two-day silent meditation retreat focusing on how shitty things can be. Unexpectedly uplifting.”\n\nAnd finally, congratulations to Heidi Julavits on her most recent book, Directions to Myself: A Memoir of Four Years, which has received extremely positive reviews in numerous major newspapers and magazines.\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nRecently, I asked ’90s, “What book from your Dartmouth academic career comes to mind first?” Here is Part II your responses. Anne Sundberg writes, “I have so many that left a lasting impression on me: Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, The Tin Drum by Gunther Grass, Lillian Hellman’s Three, and of course Huis Clos, by Jean-Paul Sartre (thank you Julie Davis and Henry Todd). I was just up in Hanover with Ricki Stern ’87 for a screening at Dartmouth Film Society of a recent project of ours—we met with the Women in Media group—and I had a fun glimpse of Kate Harrison and Margaret McCrudden Rightmire ’92.” Quincy Vale writes, “Instantly I think of Things Fall Apart. First, it’s a great book; second, every time I hear the song Wild, Wild Life by the Talking Heads and the line where David Byrne sings, ‘Things fall apart, it’s scientific,’ I immediately flash back to that book and pre-freshman fall. And it is a wild, wild life, by the way.” Ashley Kaiser writes, “For me the most memorable book was Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales. It stands out because I thought it was going to be awful and difficult to read and instead was really fun to essentially learn a new language (Middle English) and to read it out loud and feel what it felt like to speak 700 years ago; it was funny to the point of making me laugh out loud (loudly) in Sanborn Library, which was embarrassing in a very delightful sort of way; and, despite being a great work of literature that’s entertaining and funny and has provided great insights into what life was like for normal people during those times, it’s one of the most banned books in history. I wanted to call attention to it here, given that we live in times when people are still banning books.” Tony Jones, whose email signature says “writer, theologian, outdoorsman” and whose essays can be accessed at https://jonestony.substack.com, writes, “A Canticle for Leibowitz, which I read in a class called ‘The Science Fiction Novel’ taught by the late Noel Perrin. That class launched a lifelong interest in science fiction, and I’ve read that novel several times since.” Lauren Kehoe writes, “I would say The Sky is Grey by Ernest Gaines because of how it made me look at simple things from the perspective of someone without my advantages in life. In these wacky times, I feel like it should be required reading.” Carrie (Cogswell) Connelly writes, “A number of history books from professor David Lagomarsino’s classes still line my shelves (many about the Armada!). However, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, with The Monkey Wrench Gang and multiple Tom Robbins novels close behind, first leapt to mind in response to your question. Clearly, my peers had as much, or more, influence over my reading choices as my professors! Thanks in particular to freshman-year partners in crime Deb Blunt, Tamar Schreibman, and Kasie (Henderson) Nolan!”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “What book from your Dartmouth academic career comes to mind first?” Here is Part I your responses. Jessica Silver writes, “Things Fall Apart, of course, because it was the first book I had to read for college and I was so nervous!” Kyrie Robinson writes, “Jews Without Money was the book for my freshman seminar. I was wholly unaware of the stereotypes about Jewish people and wealth. I had grown up singing along with Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof as pretty much my only entree into Jewish culture and stereotypes. I still remember the professor probing the class about the title of the book and having no earthly idea what she was talking about.” Michael Cohenuram writes, “The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test for Bruce Nelson’s freshman seminar, ‘The History of the 60s.’ ” Wendy Whitcomb writes, “Paradise Lost, from ‘English 5.’ This was the first time that I had to read something that felt completely over my head. And it was probably one of the few times that I had to resort to CliffsNotes to gain a minimal understanding of the material and scrape together a paper where I felt I had no idea what I was talking about—not a great feeling when you’re starting college and wondering if you belong there. I’m glad things got better the next semester.” Laurin Grollman writes, “I wish I could say something more erudite came to mind, but nope—the Over the Hill face book, which I still use as a reference.” Deborah Greene-LaRoche writes, “Definitely Don Quixote, parts 1 and 2 and the spurious sequel—all part of a memorable Cervantes course I took as part of my Spanish lit major. I especially loved the metafiction of Part 2.” Susan Hirt writes, “Professor Henricks’ new translation of the Tao Te Ching, which he taught to our class even before the book was officially released. Though I did not major in religion, I appreciated his elucidation of Taoism and its poetic foundation text. What a privilege to explore so many diverse topics and be guided by the best scholars in their fields.” Jonathan Weatherly writes, “El Principe Destronado (The Dethroned Prince) by Miguel Delibes, which I got to read during my language study abroad program in Granada, Spain. Such a cute story of a first child who is dethroned when his younger sibling comes along. By the way, my daughter, Madison ’19, tells me her reunion is the same time as ours, so I look forward to seeing you all then.” Mark Sternman writes, “Before exams in one of the freshman year semesters, I read the novel On the Beach by Nevil Shute. Greatly moved by the dramatization of life after nuclear war, I eventually pursued a master’s in international security policy and a career in arms control before moving to Boston and working on domestic policies.” Judi Cassel writes, “Pierre; or, the Ambiguities by Herman Melville. Instead, we should have read Moby Dick, which was a favorite pandemic read of mine. Tom Thompson, what do you think?” David Jacobs writes, “I still haven’t read Things Fall Apart.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nHere is Part II of your responses to the question, “What is something you didn’t get involved in or do at Dartmouth that, if you had a second chance, you would get involved in or do?”\n\nJosh Vogel writes, “I have two kids in college and think about this a lot. I wish I had gone to more plays, more musical performances, more dinners, more professors’ office hours, and more classes!” Parker Karnan writes, “I would have played more golf at the course and skied more at the Skiway. I’m really not sure if I have ever woken up before 8 a.m. in New Hampshire. Maybe I would do that a couple of times, as well.” Jeanhee Kim writes, “I have a 17-year-old daughter applying to colleges now. The funny thing is that I told her one of my regrets was I never tried to play water polo—something I saw students doing at Dartmouth—and somehow my speaking those words convinced her to try it! She was on the girls’ water polo team a few days later and played a whole season for the Chinese Swimming Club in Singapore, where we were living at the time, in 2020-21. A small regret, I know, but how satisfying it was to see my flesh and blood try it, enjoy it, and compete in it!” Karen Hartwig writes, “For the past 25 years I’ve hiked three to five days a week near my home in the Oakland Hills [California], usually with the two different pairs of dogs I’ve had during that time. I’ve thought often that I would have enjoyed being involved in the Dartmouth Outing Club.” Nina Kushner writes, “I took good advantage of the academic and extracurricular opportunities Dartmouth provided, but I do wish I had taken at least one economics course, really learned a second language, and learned to ski! I also wish I hadn’t taken calculus my freshman year. Math is not my strong suit. Add in dark, cold, winter mornings, and the class tanked my GPA.” Jenn Scott writes, “I knew nothing about camping, hiking, and kayaking, and I pretty much avoided anything that could be construed as exercise while at Dartmouth. I was always intrigued by the Dartmouth Outing Club, but I felt too intimidated to even investigate how to participate. If I could have a second chance, I’d definitely get involved in that! Now I enjoy those activities and regret I didn’t start sooner.” David Clark writes, “With the lifts and snow so accessible at Dartmouth, I should have learned how to ski and snowboard (which I have encouraged my kids to do). Growing up in Florida did not offer those opportunities. Buddy Teevens may not have agreed, but I should have taken advantage. Thanks for asking this question, as Nicole (Smith) ’89 and I reflect on it often.” And some news from John Christmas: “My thriller novel KGB Banker, cowritten with William Burton McCormick, won two awards in 2022. The book was inspired by my whistleblowing against a Kremlin money-laundering bank. The book was named ‘Best Conspiracy Thriller of 2022’ by Best Thrillers and won the Royal Dragonfly Award for best novel (across all genres) for 2022.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s: “What is something you didn’t get involved in or do at Dartmouth that, if you had a second chance, you would get involved in or do?” Here is Part I of your responses.\n\nAndra Bowditch writes, “After high school I did a gap year overseas and I literally did not get the memo about freshman trips. I wonder, in a parallel universe where I signed up for a trip, what I would have learned and what friends I would have made and how that would have changed the trajectory of the next four years and perhaps my whole life. (Although maybe I would’ve tripped over a tree root, gotten concussed, and flunked out freshman fall, so perhaps I actually dodged a bullet!)”\n\nWilliam Boulware writes, “Dartmouth track and field was my extended family. I opted to stay on campus and run rather than study Spanish in Spain and marine biology in Costa Rica. I have a great life and have had amazing experiences, but I wonder what other joys or traumas I could have endured had I pursued these two interests while at Dartmouth.”\n\nLauren (Waller) Smith writes, “I would take a gap year or two and grow up first. I went to college at 16, and I didn’t have the maturity or confidence to take full advantage of the opportunities Dartmouth offered. My 20-year-old daughter went to college at 18 instead of 16 and was one of the oldest kids in her class. Watching how the extra two years of emotional maturity allowed her to develop a firm sense of herself and how that has allowed her to maximize her college experience makes me wish I’d had those two extra years as well.”\n\nRoth Herrlinger writes, “I would get out into nature way, way more than I did the first time around. My inclination was to stick around campus when we were in school. Nowadays, I so appreciate time outdoors, solo or with family and friends.”\n\nBill Rexford writes, “Do I dare say more pong? We all have good friends who are now gone. If I could I would have lingered longer with them, looked them in the eye a little longer, and stretched those moments out now that I know how precious those moments were. I regret not spending more time with those who have passed and try to do better for those that are still here—so, more pong.”\n\nKyrie Robinson writes, “Dartmouth Outing Club no doubt. I have no idea why I didn’t get involved with it in the first place. I love to hike and camp.”\n\nBrad Drazen writes, “I took two fantastic art history classes during senior year and realized that I may have missed my calling. If I could do it over I would have majored in art history!”\n\nKyle Davis writes, “After traveling from L.A. (the ‘Big City’) to Hanover (the backwoods of New England) the thought of traveling abroad terrified me, so I didn’t do a language or foreign study abroad. It is the one regret I can point to in my entire life (not just at Dartmouth). As a consequence, however, both of my kids studied abroad and I got to live vicariously through them!”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “If you were asked to teach a master class on any topic of your choosing, what topic would you choose? Here are your responses. Kristin Jacobson writes, “My master class would be ‘Making Your Health Insurance Work for You, Especially for Mental Health.’ ” Ali Long writes, “ ‘Live Now, Give Now: How Giving Back Improves Your Life’ (intentional, personalized philanthropy).”\n\nMichael Keller writes, “ ‘Surviving and Thriving in the River Cluster: A Freshman’s Guide to Saving Up for Dorm Damage Fines.’ ” Bill Rexford writes, “I have acquired a lot of wisdom in areas I hope I have to never tap into again, from plumbing to electrical, but I think I have expertise in how to coach coed middle school flag football to nascent athletes. Happy to share this with any who may find themselves someday in such a situation. The wisdom was hard earned.”\n\nDavid Rosenberg writes, “ ‘Wine Tasting and Appreciation Without the Snob Factor.’ ” Scott Patterson writes, “ ‘How to Teach Young Kids Long-distance Running.’ RunClubMenloPark.org is the second nonprofit I’ve founded. Ruth Bossler is also on the board of directors.”\n\nMark Sternberg writes, “ ‘The Trudeau Trials: Views on Federal Electoral Politics in Canada from a Volunteer on the 2019 and 2021 Liberal Campaigns’ and ‘Ivy League Women’s Hockey: Obstacles and Opportunities to Winning the First National Championship since 1999.’ ” Lauren (Waller) Smith writes, “ ‘How Not to Date at 50-plus.’ ”\n\nJosh Wolf-Powers writes, “ ‘How to Create Problems—and Then How to Solve Them.’ ” Paul Haffner writes, “ ‘How to Handle Mercurial People’—I’ve been dealing with them in a variety of contexts all my life and, while exhausting at times, the success stories make it all worthwhile. I’m lucky to be married to a super-steady spouse who requires no handling whatsoever!”\n\nKathy Heafey writes, “The master class I am most qualified to teach is ‘Parenting—Transracial Adoption-Style!’ I am still learning, but there are many interesting chapters in the can!” Christopher Farrens writes, “ ‘Selective Small-plot Logging Using Low-impact Techniques’ and ‘Tax Consulting for Cross-border Transactions.’ ”\n\nHallie Brooks writes, “ ‘Horses: The Key to Personal Growth, Lifelong Friendships, and Financial Ruin.’ ” Ute (Bowman) Otley writes, “It’s a toss-up between ‘How to Destroy a 1-3-1 Zone Defense’ and ‘How to Annoy the Hell Out of Your Husband!’ ”\n\nKelin (Pickard) Colberg writes, “I would probably teach a master class on the fine art of procrastinating the start of your next career (I am very much in what-next mode now that the nest is officially empty)” and Stig Colberg will teach the embarrassing class titled, “How to Live in Alaska and Not Fly Fish for an Entire Season.”\n\nJohn Stouffer writes, “I’d like to teach a master class on surfing and, more specifically, reading the winds, swells, and tides to determine where and when to go surfing. I’ve been surfing since high school, did a bit of it in New Hampshire and Maine during college, then moved to southern California after college and have surfed regularly since. I live in Redondo Beach now and currently go three to four times a week, hitting a variety of spots in the L.A. area.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “What has that small voice in the back of your head been telling you over and over for years and years?” Here are your responses. Lauren Smith writes, “Sadly, that I, my daughter, and the other women in my life who I love will never have the same rights, privileges, and freedoms as the ones with which men get to walk through the world.” Michael Keller writes, “643-6135, 643-6135, 643-6135.”\n\nBill Wilson writes, “I’ve been hearing, ‘Go back to Hanover, it has been too long!’ I’ve missed the class reunions through the years, but I did get a chance to go to the 50th Black Alumni at Dartmouth Association reunion this past Memorial Day Weekend. I had a fantastic time and after 20 years it was great to be back on campus. While there I ran into Kelly Green Kahn, Brad Bennett, and Dan Patton.”\n\nKaren Behling writes, “With the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade I have been thinking about the first protest march I went to in D.C. in April of 1988. I remember Kathy Heafey marching with the ‘Catholics for Choice’ crew, and Jane Blum and Tom Thompson and I road-tripping together. The voice in my head has been telling me to keep up the fight. I protested in Raleigh, North Carolina, a few weeks ago and will keep fighting so all our daughters have the same rights we grew up with.”\n\nHallie Brooks writes, “Say ‘yes!’ As we enter middle age, our bodies aren’t getting any younger, and if someone gives you an opportunity to do something fun, say ‘yes!’ Hike Kilimanjaro (Rick Dunham and Rob Norris), meet up with your college buddies from across the country for a weekend getaway, try a new sport (I just tried eventing on a friend’s most wonderful horse loan). Carpe diem, friends!”\n\nSuzanne (Rathbun) Fetter writes, “ ‘Keep going,’ a lesson learned on my freshman year hiking trip at Dartmouth.” Roth Herrlinger writes, “The small voice in the back of my head has been saying, ‘Go to New Zealand. Find what’s there for you.’ I was going to go in 2020, but then…well, we all know what 2020 brought. So I’m going to head over later this year and explore!”\n\nKyrie Robinson writes, “My inner voice is largely critical and I spend three-quarters of my time telling her to shut up. But I do have another inner voice that tells me to join the Red Cross, Peace Corps, Feed America, travel the world, walk the Camino Trail, or bike across the United States. Basically, go on adventures, because I figure at 52, I’ve got about 25 years of great health before I start to slow down. I have another voice that says, ‘It’s been nine years, maybe you should get out and date again.’ But my twin boys are 19, still trying to launch, so I’m largely staying put until they are a bit more steady on their feet.” Kyle Davis writes, “ ‘This is not the dog talking to you…it’s also not God. Now stand up straight and you need to be better about remembering the names of people you meet and you need to call your mom once in a while.’ (My small voice is part Dale Carnegie and part Nigerian auntie.)”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nRecently, I asked ’90s, “Out of all the people whom you’ve never met (living or deceased), who has had the biggest positive influence on your life?” Here is Part II of your responses. Bradley Bennett writes, “That’s easy! Martin Luther King Jr.” Phil Privatera writes, “That’s easy: Jim Valvano. I never even knew who Jim Valvano was until Dick Vitale told me all about him and how he started the V Foundation before he died. From that moment I was hooked. Rarely a week will go by that I don’t watch a video of Jim Valvano speaking. My favorite is his 1987 presentation titled ‘Cutting Down the Nets’ (1987). I learn something new every time, and most of all I learn to never give up on myself or on anyone or anything.” Andy Affleck writes, “Carl Sagan.” Ed Callaway writes, “I have to go with New Yorker essayist John McPhee. Through a lifetime of reading his books, covering everything from a profile of Sierra Club president David Brower to the Swiss army to a massive survey of the nation’s geology as viewed from Interstate 80, McPhee has taught me to dig deep to appreciate the depth and humanity in a wide variety of seemingly obscure topics. My alternate pick is Aaron Lee Tasjan, a songwriter based in East Nashville. He is a relentlessly positive, empathetic, and insightful person who is a recurring inspiration though his songs, such as ‘Success’ and ‘Set You Free,’ and through his Twitter feed.” Peter Pasi writes, “I would say St. Teresa of Kolkata. (I guess she’s technically Saint Teresa of Calcutta.)” Chris McCabe writes, “Mick Jagger.” Josh Vogel writes, “Bjorn Borg, the great tennis player and rival of John McEnroe. As a kid watching them play against each other, I admired how Borg remained calm even in the face of Johnny Mac’s tantrums and I saw how it helped him succeed. I don’t think I was predisposed to be calm as a child, and I wasn’t growing up in a calm household, so I really think I took that from watching him. It has proven to be one of my most useful tools through every aspect of my life.” Bill Rexford writes, “Ken Kesey.” Rebecca Baggett writes, “Toni Morrison.” Scott Patterson sent a quotation from Mahatma Gandhi: “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” Ute (Bowman) Otley writes, “John Wooden is the most influential person I’ve never met. I picked up a copy of his Principles of Basketball when I got hired for my first coaching job in 1991, and I’ve gone back to it again and again during my 30-year coaching career. His commitment to doing things the right way with a mix of compassion and discipline has been a guiding force in my career as a teacher and a coach.” And congratulations to Walter Palmer, who was honored in March at the Ivy League Basketball Tournament in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as one of the Ivy League’s “legends.” Well deserved!\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “Out of all the people you’ve never met (living or deceased), who has had the biggest positive influence on your life?” Here is Part I of your responses.\n\nMarcus Weiss writes, “What a beautiful question. At this very moment Tony Robbins holds the top spot. In very recent times he helped empower me to pivot my whole life into conscious hope and positivity. (But I can think of an endless list of people, as everyone I come across has impacted me dearly!)” Michael Keller writes, “Neil Peart. If you just think he’s a rock drummer, you don’t know his story and who he was.” Mark Sternman writes, “Paul Farmer.” Lauren (Waller) Smith writes, “The person who first figured out how to make coffee.” Larry Specht writes, “Astronaut Chris Hadfield, author of An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth: What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything. A great book about taking every chance to learn a new trick.” Nancy Groth writes, “Paul McCartney and John Lennon.” Christian Henrich writes, “Christ.”\n\nJen Gittes writes, “This was a hard one, but it didn’t take long for me to decide: Dr./Dame Jane Goodall. Although I haven’t followed her closely or even read any of her books, every time I see, hear about, or am reminded of her I feel proud and hopeful. And it turns out that her latest book is indeed about hope. That one I plan to read as soon as possible. Jane Goodall has been true to herself and to her instincts and interests throughout her life. In the 1950s, while in her 20s, she left England for Africa and entered the male-dominated worlds of ethnology and anthropology with little preparation but with huge interest and dedication. She has experienced all of the joys and traumas life puts in one’s path, including love, marriage, motherhood, higher education, divorce, illness, real danger, criticism, humiliation, recognition, and mind-boggling awards. Through it all she has persevered and remained true to her integrity and to her North Star in her efforts to acknowledge, respect, and protect animals, the environment, and nature in general. She is truly an inspiration and a comfort.”\n\nScott Facher writes, “Always happy to see your name pop up in my email, Rob. Due to people like you, here’s my response: J.D. Salinger, because I chose to go to Dartmouth hoping I’d bump into him at Lou’s, which never happened. Instead I made friends who continue to bring the greatest joy and inspiration to my life.” Susan Domchek writes, “Rosalind Franklin.” Christopher Farrens writes, “Fred Pillsbury Carleton III. His turn of phrase, ‘The damage is the tradeoff for the fun,” has inspired generations. From raconteur to lonely goatherd, he’s been around!” David “Danger” Sherwood writes, “Bruce Springsteen.” Sam McLean writes, “At the moment I’ll go with Charles Darwin. His discovery of how enormously complex life forms evolve from simple processes both explains life on Earth and provides the conceptual scaffolding for much of what us medical researchers do.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nHere is Part IV of your answers to the question, “What’s your favorite album that was recorded after we graduated in 1990 or who’s your favorite musical artist whom you discovered after we graduated in 1990?”\n\nChris Marlow writes, “Nevermind by Nirvana. It is one of the few times in my life I can remember the moment I heard a song. Nothing special, just driving home to Alexandria from Washington, D.C. It was such a singular moment that I nearly stopped my car to listen to it. That album was so unique and entrancing. And Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morrisette had wonderful songs that slapped one in the face. This album was musically simple, tight, and personal. It expressed an angst, a pain all of us experience. It was raw, powerful, honest.”\n\nMarcus Weiss writes, “Hands-down my favorite album released after we graduated is October Road by James Taylor. I love it so much that I was singing the title song to my unborn first child in my wife’s belly! We have both continued to sing it to our two boys as a lullaby at bedtime to this day (they are 12 and 9).”\n\nCheryl Shepherd writes,“Coldplay, definitely, and then the Chainsmokers. (Oh, and there’s this guy my daughter likes too—Max Drazen—who may be going places.)” Tom Warren writes, “My favorite album would have to be Sonic Highways by Foo Fighters. The songs were all inspired by the musical traditions and histories of several music cities across the United States.”\n\nJonathan Sullivan writes, “I’m going to have to go with Dirt by Alice in Chains. It cemented them as one of my favorite bands of all time and though my musical tastes have evolved through time, I keep coming back to this album and this band.”\n\nKevin Stone writes,“I can’t explain why I am moved to respond, since I can’t remember if I ever contributed to the ’90 news. Lyle Lovett sits high on my list of artists discovered since graduation. His was one of the most enjoyable concerts I’ve attended: listening to Lyle and his Large Band, sitting in a field on a beautiful summer evening in central New York, watching a sunset. I’ve been enjoying his music ever since.”\n\nJim Wilhelm writes,“The National and their album Alligator. I saw them live for the first time in Seattle in the fall of 2006. A week later I asked my now wife if she wanted to take a road trip from Seattle to Portland [Oregon] to see them live. She said ‘yes’—it was our second date. We got engaged six months later. Since then we have seen them in N.Y.C., Seattle and most recently in Berkeley [California] back in 2019. I love their music and the fact that they are originally from Ohio, like most great things!”\n\nLaurin Grollman writes,“My favorite band since 1990 is Train.”\n\nPaul Haffner writes,“Black Crowes! They saved rock ’n’ roll after the rather hideous decade for pop music that was the 1980s. And Jack White is pretty damn good too.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nHere is Part III of your answers to, “What’s your favorite album that was recorded after we graduated in 1990 or who’s your favorite musical artist whom you discovered after we graduated in 1990?” Andy Affleck writes, “The album Laid by the British rock band James. It was produced by Brian Eno and has those ambient touches that make it haunting at times and beautiful at others. And it also slaps, as my daughter would say.” Adam Bookbinder writes,“A Rush of Blood to the Head by Coldplay and The King is Dead by The Decemberists.” Lauren Beiley writes,“Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Moby, and Beck.” Brad Drazen writes,“Solo artist: Hozier. Band: Jukebox the Ghost.” (But you all should keep an eye on Max Drazen, Brad’s son…he’s a future star.) David Greenberg writes,“In 2014 I read a little Wall Street Journal feature about a local N.Y.C. artist named Alynda Segarra who writes songs (that seem as though they’ve always existed out in the Americana ether) and sings for a group called Hurray for the Riff Raff. I’ve followed the band for years now and see them live whenever I can. I recommend their albums Small Town Heroes and The Navigator.” Kyle Davis writes,“The Roots, a.k.a. Questlove’s other gig!” Mary (Bachman) DeSilva writes,“I’m unabashedly a total crunchy folky hippy and delight in the album Stand by The Kennedys (not the dead ones).” Tracy Leavelle writes, “Wilco and their album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.” Michael Lindgren writes, “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by Wilco.” Michael Keller writes, “My favorite artist discovered post-college has to be Death Cab for Cutie. Dumb name but amazing band with thought-provoking lyrics. My favorite album by them is Plans.” Lou Mabley writes,“John Prine’s The Tree of Forgiveness and Jason Isbell’s Southeastern. These two guys were really good friends and influences on each other. Losing John to COVID-19 last year was a devastating blow.” Ali Long writes,“Rozzi Crane.” Kristin Jacobson writes, “No song favorites, but I had a big personal accomplishment earlier this summer. I and my two older boys (Connor and Finn) summited Half Dome. It was 13 hours, 21 miles, and 4,800 vertical feet. I am not sure I could have done it in my 40s (I had so many injuries), so I’m very proud to have made it in my 50s!” Hal Holway writes,“When I first heard Nirvana’s album Nevermind in 1992, my world was rocked. I don’t hear it much anymore, but it’s the first ‘new’ music I was into after college and, unlike some music that sort of blurs with ‘before or after Dartmouth,’ Nevermind is firmly on the soundtrack of a later, newly adult era of my life.” Andrew Latimer writes,“I have to say Cake is my favorite artist discovered since 1990. They’re almost too cool, but I just really like their beats and attitude, and I still enjoy their older stuff. (I also really love Bon Iver and Radiohead.)” Jenny (Goldberg) Wood writes,“Rani Arbo and Daisy Mayhem!”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nI recently asked ’90s, “What’s your favorite album that was recorded after we graduated in 1990 or who’s your favorite musical artist whom you discovered after we graduated in 1990?” Here is Part 2 of your answers. Allison Berger writes, “Radiohead. Hail to the Thief may be their best album.” Cristina (Infante) Smith writes, “The album that immediately comes to mind is Bruce Springsteen’s We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions. It is a family favorite, especially for long trips in the car. My husband and I heard it for the first time as we sat on my cousin’s porch drinking whiskey at ‘dusk,’ which I put in quotes because we were in Norway that summer for a family reunion and dusk was at 2 a.m. or so. The wonderful folk songs on that album have been the background music for so many of our family adventures. I just love it.” Derek Symer writes, “I’m a pretty big new music nerd and former AM 1340 DJ. I’m going to skip over the grunge bands of the ’90s and the Smashing Pumpkins, which get an honorable mention in my book. Recently I’ve been really grooving on Manchester Orchestra’s new LP The Million Masks of God. However, my vote goes to Jason Isbell. I admire his guitar mastery, lyrical genius, and songcraft almost as much as his dedication to his personal sobriety, justice, and equal rights.” Two days later Derek wrote me a second email: “I’m having my morning coffee and saying to myself, ugh, you idiot! Radiohead, of course. How could you forget Radiohead or Wilco?!” Quincy Vale writes, “One band that is absolutely fantastic is the Finnish progressive band, Nightwish. Their North American tour this fall will be the first live music I have seen since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.” Michelle Brownlee writes, “Maceo Parker. Before he became a solo artist, Maceo was James Brown’s saxophone player. His brother, Kellis Parker, was a professor at Columbia Law School, and I took a music contracts class with him. Kellis talked about Maceo all the time in class, but I didn’t think much of it until I finally had the chance to go see Maceo play a show. I’ve definitely seen him live more than any other artist, at least 10 times. The last time I went to see him, two or three years ago, he reminisced onstage about his law professor brother, Kellis, who died very young, a few years after I graduated law school. Maceo’s tribute to my professor made that show the best of all.” Ute Otley writes, “I am a huge Beyonce fan. Her Homecoming concert is the most entertaining thing I’ve seen or heard in music in a long time. The flirtatious girl power vibe is a winner! In other news, one of my CVU basketball players, Mekkena Boyd, will be playing at Dartmouth this year. I feel like a proud mom sending one of my basketball offspring to my alma mater!” Christian Henrich writes, “Stone Sour.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “What’s your favorite album that was recorded after we graduated in 1990—or who’s your favorite musical artist whom you discovered after we graduated in 1990?” I think I received more responses to this question than any other question I have posed, so it may take a few columns to get through them all. Here is Part 1. Kelin (Pickard) Colberg writes: “We, especially Stig Colberg, have become big fans of Slightly Stoopid. Other family favorites include G. Love & Special Sauce (they do some good stuff with Jack Johnson), The Cat Empire, Macklemore, Dispatch, Lumineers, Beyonce, Ali Farka Toure, Stick Figure, OAR, Doja Cat, and Alabama Shakes. Also, here’s a quick family update: Our eldest, a senior at the University of Vermont, is hoping to attend medical school; our middlest will be a freshman at Dartmouth; and I just took our youngest on her college trip. The nest is clearing out, and I’m not quite sure how I feel about that.” Rennolds Ostrom writes: “The Dave Matthews Band. This is literally the only music I listen to (much to the chagrin of my wife, I might add).” Jennifer (Huska) Merriman writes: “An album by Cowboy Junkies, 200 More Miles: Live Performances 1985-1994. I saw them live in graduate school and have loved them and that album ever since. My top-five favorite artists since 1990 would be Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga (who was on a Southwest flight with me from Oakland to L.A. before she became famous), Dave Matthews Band, Snow Patrol, and Imagine Dragons.” Chris McCabe writes: “Definitely Beck, perhaps because he works some Jagger chicken dance elements into his live performances.” Ramzi Nemo writes: “I can’t think of a band I like better than the too-conveniently-named Ivy, which released six albums from 1995 to 2011. The band’s founder, Adam Schlesinger, who was a year ahead of us at Williams, also played in Fountains of Wayne. With Ivy co-founder Andy Chase, he created the iconic theme song for the movie That Thing You Do. Very sadly, in April 2020 Covid-19 cut short his remarkably prolific career in pop, theater, and motion pictures.” Laura (Van Wie) McGrory writes: “I credit my kids for ensuring that my musical tastes didn’t stay stuck in the 1980s. Two of my favorite newer groups—which I like well enough to have seen them in concert multiple times—are Milky Chance and Cage the Elephant.” Mark Sternman writes: “As a lover of most things Canadian, I discovered The Tragically Hip long after graduation. Tight musically and interesting lyrically, the Hip, among its many other accomplishments, spotlighted the unimaginable horrors suffered by Indigenous populations in Canada, a history that sadly resonates for those of us who have lived our entire lives south of the 49th parallel.” Julie Urda writes: “Ben Folds.” Eric Hageman writes: “With apologies to great albums by Lauryn Hill, Nirvana, and Wilco, for my money, Frank Ocean’s Channel Orange is the best album since 1990.” Kerstin (Stanley) Clark writes: “Hi from Calgary (we moved here in 2017). I discovered Spearhead (Michael Franti) post-Dartmouth and make my kids listen to it on drives around the Canadian west.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nI asked ’90s, “In what way(s), big or small, has the pandemic changed you (or your outlook, or your habits, or your values, or your self-knowledge, etc.) forever?” Here is Part II of your answers. Deborah Cornavaca writes: “Working in state government throughout the pandemic, it has solidified my conviction to lead with empathy.” Scott Spring says: “Somebody said the pandemic is destined to turn each of us into ‘a hunk, a chunk, or a drunk.’ If I’m honest, I’ve been moderating between all three of these. One habit that’s been great for my mental and physical health is my daily GOOTH (get out of the house) for a 60-90-minute walk.” Christine Smith writes: “The downside: I have a permanent fear of opening my laptop to bad news, my wine habit is well over the CDC guidelines, and I’ve developed a much-lower threshold for tearful breakdowns. On the other hand, I’ve realized that I’m more determined to pursue my goals, virus be damned. Case in point: Early last March we were offered an opportunity to buy the house next door before it went on the market. We live on a lake and had always dreamed of expanding. I remember thinking that I wasn’t going to let some stinkin’ virus get in the way of our family’s hopes and plans. I channel this feeling now whenever I’m feeling blocked or overwhelmed by Covid-19.” Lauren (Waller) Smith writes: “I think the pandemic will cause me to be much more cautious about adding either things or people to my life. This has actually been a kind of nice time because I’ve spent it with the person I love most in a serene space without a lot of clutter. It really would have sucked to spend this much time surrounded by things or people (or both) that I didn’t enjoy.” Carrie Connelly writes: “Covid-19 has reminded me how much I prefer hosting one couple or a person, rather than an entire mob. In the future I’m going to try to stick with hosting intimate but more frequent dinners, where conversations have a beginning, a middle, and an end (and I hope at least some of those dinners will be indoors, and not all by the fire pit). Oh, and yoga—that’s been a healthy, calming addition to my workouts.” Mike Kennealy writes: “Here in Massachusetts I serve in Gov. Charlie Baker’s cabinet as the secretary of housing and economic development. Two conclusions that will always stay with me: the ability of so many actors (state government, local government, the healthcare system, the business community, non-profits, etc.) to mobilize and work together was inspiring to see and continues to this day; and the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on communities of color means that the pandemic has exposed serious inequities across our society in housing, healthcare, economic opportunity, and other areas. We have a lot of work to do.” Dana Weintraub writes: “I got a new job, engaging young girls from underserved neighborhoods and kids with disabilities with sports! Check it out: www.bawsi.org.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “In what way(s), big or small, has the pandemic changed you (or your outlook, or your habits, or your values, or your self-knowledge, etc.) forever?” Here is Part I of your answers. Greg Millett:“If anything, the Covid-19 pandemic is all too familiar. After Dartmouth I returned to N.Y.C., which was being ravaged by AIDS. I remember a botched government response, a city gripped by fear and anxiousness, and being 22 and already knowing 13 people who had died. For many of us in the gay community, Covid-19’s stigma, testing, denial, and politicization brought up so much of what we lived through in what we call ‘the plague years.’ It has not helped that five of my friends and work acquaintances lost their lives to Covid-19 in the past year. As an infectious disease epidemiologist who has had a career spanning the Centers for Disease Control to the Obama White House, I’m grateful for my experience in HIV to provide insight on surveillance and prevention measures—as well as the ability to contribute my published studies to the Covid-19 scientific literature. What I did not expect was our nation’s haphazard and half-hearted response to the pandemic. I hoped that, collectively, we would handle this pandemic better after the mistakes that were made 40 years earlier. Sadly, that has not been the case. What does that say about us?” Kimberly L. Robinson:“This pandemic hasn’t changed me forever. Adversity happens in life. I think people have been so thrown by this pandemic because they thought their comfortable lives couldn’t be shaken and that such a global catastrophe couldn’t happen in the 21st century. I’ve never been under any such illusion. In the short term, the pandemic prompted me to quit my job because I didn’t believe they could keep work conditions safe, plus I was unwilling to expose myself to public transportation twice a day to get back and forth. I was going to leave that job anyway; I just didn’t think it would be because of a pandemic. Now I’m going to try to do something where I can work from home. Of course, starting something new is always a little bit anxiety-producing, but I think I will be okay. I wouldn’t say that what I’m embarking on, in terms of career, will last forever, but I hope it will last a few years and be reasonably lucrative. The truth is that God has been looking out for me during this very trying year, so I don’t have to worry about what will happen tomorrow. This past year’s catastrophe is hardly the first I’ve been through in recent years and I’m still here, by God’s grace and provision. He has been looking out for me since I accepted Him, which was, not ironically, at Dartmouth. (I’ve always told people that Dartmouth is a place that will drive you to one side of the divine divide or the other.) So I just try to do my part each day and not worry about the rest.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nI recently asked ’90s, “What’s the best (or most impactful or memorable) book you’ve read during the last three years?” Here is Part II of your responses: William Boulware: “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is a phenomenal read.” Ute Bowman Otley: “Bridge of Clay by Markus Zusak, which I finished in the Williams College Bookstore while waiting for a basketball game between my daughter’s Tufts Jumbos and the Ephs. I found myself sobbing in public. It’s that good.” Julie Urda: “Alif the Unseen by G. Willow Wilson had an imaginative plot mixed with exciting storytelling. I was really impressed by how she intertwines the ancient with the contemporary. It introduced me to a new world of Middle Eastern mysticism.” Eric Wellons: Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment by Robert Wright. Kyle Davis: “In the Garden of Beasts by Erik Larson is the true story of William E. Dodd, the first American ambassador to Nazi Germany. It’s a great lesson on how ‘good’ Germans and the rest of the world watched while the Nazis became exterminators of ‘undesirables.’ ” Laurie Isbell Donaghu: “My favorite was The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson and my second favorite was The Overstory by Richard Powers.” Jen Gittes: “A Boy and His Dog at the End of the World by C.A. Fletcher was dystopian adventure with a satisfying twist. I loved it.” Tony Jones:“Deliverance by James Dickey. A friend recommended it and said it has some of the best hunting scenes ever written, which is true—even if the protagonist is on the hunt for a human. It’s a stunningly well-written book.” Peter Jennings: “Grant by Ron Chernow. I also listened to Chernow’s Alexander Hamilton, which was life-changing as well.” Gary Katz: “A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles had prose so good I held myself to 10 pages a day to savor it. It’s a must-read for anyone who took ‘Introduction to the Soviet Union.’ ” David Sherwood: “July 1914 by Sean McMeekin serves as a stark reminder that we should strive to ensure that our government is competent, transparent, and accountable; the failure to do so can lead to incalculable loss.” John Stouffer: “Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann was a really interesting, true murder story about the Osage tribe in Oklahoma and how the case helped develop the FBI.” Rob Harris: “A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles was beautifully written. Also Black is the Body by Emily Bernard, a collection of personal stories and anecdotes from a Black woman from Nashville. It teaches us much and opens our eyes without being preachy or handbook-ish.” David Janssen: “How Democracies Die by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt felt like an intervention or one of those old ‘this is your brain on drugs’ commercials in its context for our politics. But the analysis was somehow comforting. The first step to recovery is understanding the problem.” Mark Sternman:“Roger Kahn’s The Boys of Summer—it’s deep dives into baseball, newspapering, and urban living really resonated with me, as did the stories about visits to retired players, which illustrated the opportunities and perils of aging.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nI recently asked ’90s, “What’s the best (or most impactful or memorable) book you’ve read during the last three years?” Here is Part I of your responses. Lauren Waller Smith: “Florida by Lauren Groff.” Paul Haffner: “Last year I re-read Catch 22 by Joseph Heller, and it just blew me away. It’s a masterpiece (and funny as hell). Honorable mention goes to Grandma Gatewood’s Walk by Ben Montgomery—a true story of a grandmother who leaves home to walk the Appalachian Trail on her own with no one knowing—and in tennis shoes.”\n\nMike Lindgren: “The Doctor of Aleppo by my former roommate Dan Mayland was pretty durn good!” Deborah Cornavaca: “New Power by Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms, which I read as I began working for the governor of New Jersey. A great book is a great book. A really memorable book is a great book read at the right time.” Kyrie Robinson: “Nonfiction, The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson; fiction, A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles.” Heather Block: “Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Three times because you have to.” Jonathan Sullivan: “Most recently The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson, Educated by Tara Westover, Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance, and Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates are showing me how different the world looks when viewed through the eyes of Black people and the rural poor and helping me understand why we are in this moment as a society. The Three-Body Problem trilogy by Cixin Liu has been mind-expanding in completely different ways and a welcome escape when the day-to-day is too much.”\n\nAndrew Latimer: “The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. Although, annoyingly, I will also tell you the best-written book I have read during the last few years is Middlemarch by George Eliot—also the funniest! And the book that moved me the most was All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr.” Wendy Richmond: “Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, also Pachinko by Min Jin Lee.” Pamela Chandran: “Recently, during a hot, dry L.A. summer, I read The Overstory by Richard Powers (which is, to unfairly simplify it, about the interconnectedness of trees and humans and how humans need trees and how trees very much do not need humans). I would wake up very early and read the book outside on our front porch in the quiet and the growing light. While we have three lovely palms in the front, we do not have the broad-trunked, wide-canopied trees that undergird the book. The book left me with a feeling of an absence. I once again felt the regret of not spending enough time outdoors when I was at Dartmouth, and it only now occurs to me that the book may have played a subconscious role in our decision to move to the Pacific Northwest next month.” Michael Keller: “Telegraph Road by Michael Chabon. Nobody writes like he does. His storytelling is not always perfect, but his use of language is sublime.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nBack in late April I asked ’90s, “Please tell us one positive thing that’s come out of the Covid-19 pandemic for you or a member of your family.” Here are the responses I couldn’t fit into previous columns. They will remind you of what life was like back when the pandemic was young. Sarah Lennon: “My family of four’s crazy-busy schedules of music rehearsals, softball practices, board meetings, and other volunteer work have fallen by the wayside, which was disappointing at first. But now we eat dinner together every night, I cook and bake with my daughter, and we play cards and other board games. I’ve traded my 2.5 hours of commuting to D.C. each day for extra workouts. Perhaps best of all is that we’ve introduced the kids to The West Wing and watch it almost every evening.” David Jacobs:“One good thing has been more family time, especially with my oldest daughter, who’s going off to college at Washington University in the fall. Lunch every day together, family walks on the beach, poker night, movie night, creative cooking and baking (you haven’t lived until you’ve had banana mush with chocolate), sitting around the family room while my 16-year-old daughter serenades us on her ukulele—there’s certainly been a silver lining.” Liz Edgar:“I’m realizing I must have made a good choice in marrying James Edgar because we’re getting along fine together here in the house 24/7, teaching from home, just us and the dog. Good practice for retirement?” Kyrie Robinson:“One positive thing that will continue after the stay-at-home rules ease:With no income, I was forced to massively trim our family budget. One fallout is that my 16-year-old boys and I have started doing the yard work and I’m teaching them how to clean the house every two weeks. (I certainly didn’t grow up with gardeners and housekeepers, but as a single mom, I had come to rely on them. Now we all have plenty of time.)Another positive thing is that I reinstated my news diet. Starting two weeks ago, I now set a timer of 30 minutes to scan headlines and read maybe one or two articles. That’s it.” Sophia Neely: “I still love playing sports, so being unable to gather for practices and games of flag football, basketball, and baseball has been very sad for me, especially given my extroverted nature. I have always strongly preferred chasing a ball of some sort to working out at a gym. Yet I have developed a mild addiction to solo exercise at home with no special equipment. I press play nearly every day on a 30-minute ‘Daily Burn’ online workout, not because I love it but because I love having done it.” Phil Privatera: “I am grateful for all the time I have been able to spend with my children (17 and 19). Every night the kitchen turns into the dorm cluster social room, where everyone congregates after working or studying all day to unwind, have a snack, or watch some tube. It inevitably turns into an all-night laugh-a-thon with no one wanting to be the first one to go to bed.” Jessica Silver: “I finally have the time to foster newborn orphaned kittens from the no-kill shelter where I volunteer. They came to me the size of gerbils and needed bottle feeding every two hours around the clock. I am exhausted, but I feel like I am doing something worthwhile. They are adorable (2 weeks old now), and I know I will remember this experience for the rest of my life.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nBack in late April, way before our successful, awesome 30th reunion on Zoom in mid-June, I asked ’90s, “Please tell us one positive thing that’s come out of the Covid-19 pandemic for you or a member of your family.” Here is Part II. Ted Carleton: “First time in my life I’ve ever been deemed essential. So, like Carl Spackler, I’ve got that going for me.” Kim Lewis: “I’ve had 42 consecutive nights (and counting) of family dinner with all four of us (husband, son aged 21, daughter aged 18) in attendance, leisurely one- to two-hour dinners followed by all-family clean ups and movie or game nights. No one wanted this drastic change of pace, but Brent and I are cherishing it.” Mark Sternman: “I’ve gotten to grow my first beard since my Edinburgh foreign study program. On a more serious note, I’ve done multiple Zoom calls with Tor Blaisdell, Roth Herrlinger, Jamie Pringle, and Scott Spring. The old banter never fails to cheer me.” Josh Vogel: “Renewed family time has been an unexpected treat. I never expected to once again have us all together, with time to really connect. I find that my children have become mature, thoughtful, caring individuals whose company I really enjoy. Having a taste of retirement has been a nice treat as well. My wife and I haven’t spent this much time together since before we were married.” Quincy Vale: “The ability of humans to adapt to change is truly remarkable. I look at the wrenching change in lifestyles wrought by the global pandemic in a few short months and it makes me hopeful that the collective, global ‘we’ will be able to address climate change in a meaningful manner. The money can be found and invested. The laws and policies can be enacted. The technologies can be repurposed, developed, and deployed at scale. And we can do it quickly and efficiently in a way to minimize loss of life and our natural world. In short, one positive of all this is that it is a good dress rehearsal for what we all need to do during the coming 20 years to manage and mitigate the unintended impact we are having on our home planet. We can do it, and we will.” Jane Blum DeMarchi: “I have to admit I am enjoying spending so much time with my college-aged children. I thought they were gone for good and now I get to eat lunch with them!” Sue Domchek: “At the risk of sounding flippant, given that I work in a hospital and things have been stressful (and I fully realize that the following is a First World problem), I learned how to color my own hair. However, I have no intention of continuing this newfound skill on the other side.” Brad Drazen: “The five of us have really enjoyed reconnecting as a family unit. It’s been a decade since we sat down at the dinner table consistently, and we’ve found a great sense of comfort in being together. I believe one of the positive, long-lasting results of the pandemic will be that nuclear families will remain stronger and more cohesive for years to come.” Gary Katz: “The one positive thing that has come out of the Covid-19 shelter-in-place orders are the Wednesday night ‘virtual house meetings’ we have been having on Zoom with the Sigma Nu ’90s, including Bruce Sacerdote, Quincy Vale, Todd Eagle, Brian Mittman, Rob Fasciano, Bob Galindo, Chris Farrens, Jon Ezrow, Mike Kanarick, and Matt Hemry. I’m embarrassed to admit, though, that given our age we have adjusted the start time from 10 p.m. to 8 p.m.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “Please tell us one positive thing that’s come out of the Covid-19 pandemic for you or a member of your family or one life-adjustment or habit change you have made that you expect will continue as we all ease into the new normal.” Many of you responded; here is Part I. Michelle Brownlee: “The big plus for me has been connecting with old friends via Zoom or FaceTime. I’ve had get-togethers with friends from college, high school, and the town I grew up in. Also, I’ve been leading an effort for several years to get our school district to move to a later start time for the high school, which starts classes at 7:20 a.m. When online learning started up, they scheduled high school classes to start at noon. My two high school students are loving their new schedule!” John Banks: “Since our son and daughter have had their senior spring on campus in Hanover canceled, it’s been wonderful for my wife and me to have them home with us before they start their next chapters in other cities after graduation.” Ute Bowman Utley: “The best thing to come out of this pandemic is that we have had an unexpected seven weeks of having all three of my college-aged children under the same roof again. We’ve become puzzle masters, played a ton of cribbage, and watched all kinds of shows on Netflix and Prime. Added bonus: I’ve upped my tech game by 1,000 percent with this shift to online learning. Teaching high school government over a computer is a challenge, but I’ll be better for it once we get back into the classroom.” John Kornet: “Our daughter, Rachel, is home from college. I’ve wished for this since the day she left two Septembers ago, but not like this. Her brother graduates tomorrow from University of Michigan and, alas, we will not be there. No hugs of congratulation, no senior art exhibition, no ceremony, no dinner out. They will find another time to do it but I keep thinking about our own 1990 graduation and what it would have been like to be ripped from the campus two months before. I had enough trouble leaving when we were supposed to leave! Highway robbery.” Amit Malholtra: “I’m here in Washington, D.C. with Jane Varner Malhotra, where I can report that in a world that has been so up-ended that a negative (test result) is a positive, we’re doing well. After steadily sending one child after another off to college for the last few years, we suddenly find our house full again with almost all of them. Everyone is either working or learning at home, but fortunately all are holding up. We’re also cooking a great deal more together, and I’ve already run through my repertoire a few times during the past few weeks.” John Sucke: “My partner, Peggy, and I have had a chance to try out new recipes during the pandemic. For example, polenta with chicken broth and cheddar cheese or rice porridge with black rice, dates, and bananas. Perhaps Covid-19 will unleash a new generation of chefs for the 2020s!” David Clark: “A habit that I will hold onto will be doing and appreciating the little things that you do with your family. Now that my kids are older, they are busy with work, college, and their social lives, but we have managed to do more family puzzles, workouts, walks, bike rides, games, cooking, do-it-yourself projects, movie nights, etc. I pray that all of our classmates, their families, and friends are safe and have a successful opening of their cities. I’m hoping we will be able to return to the Big D in 2021 to celebrate our 30th reunion. Stay blessed!”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nWith our 30th reunion just around the corner (June 18-21—go register now at d90reunion.org!), I asked ’90s to contemplate the following question: “What’s something on your bucket list that you’re at least 50 percent committed to achieving or experiencing or what’s a challenging goal you’re currently pursuing?” Here are your responses. Jennifer (Huska) Merriman: “At age 50 I decided to embark on a new career in wildlife medicine! I am back in school studying to be a veterinary technician and at the same time volunteering and doing internships caring for native wildlife in northern California.” Lauren Kehoe: “I’m committing to travel more, but less for ‘enrichment’ than just stuff that makes me happy. In October I went to Las Vegas to see Billy Idol’s show at the Palms, ride the roller coaster around the New York New York hotel, and eat soufflé in the bar at the Paris hotel while watching the fountain show at the Bellagio out its windows. My next planned bit of happiness travel is to see the Stanley Cup at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto!” Michael Keller: “Sky-diving. Have been on the tarmac when a flight got canceled for weather, so hoping to get back to it before I start daisy-pushing!” Robin Plager Lapre: “My major ambition is to reduce animal shelter overcrowding by improving access to low-cost spay and neuter surgery in Tennessee. Having spent two years volunteering in rural shelters, I reached the conclusion that the solution to the surplus animal population requires education, incentives, and affordable access to low-cost sterilization. Please consider adopting your next pet. And if you want to save 1,000 future dogs or cats, just spay or neuter the ones you have!” Paul Hill: “I am somewhat more than 50 percent committed to hiking 50 separate peaks with 50 different people in my 50s. I’ve done eight so far. Todd Thayer and I did Hunter Mountain to the fire tower last October. The best part (besides the obvious of getting outside) is catching up with friends and family from different parts of my life, often in a place I’ve never been!” David Greenberg: “For many years I’ve wanted to compete at the World Masters (over age 40) Track and Field Championship, but never have. Wearing a Team USA uniform and competing against the world’s best has a strong appeal to me. But for years the meet has been in faraway places, so I’ve had to skip it. This year the meet is in Toronto, and I’m more than likely going to compete. Just to make my ‘challenging goal’ even more challenging, I’m doubling down by learning a new event: the 3,000-meter steeplechase. The final is August 1.” Bernadine Wu:“I have a ton of bucket list items that involve family and travel and selling my company and living a meaningful, powerful, extraordinary life, but the one real goal I’m out for is this: simplifying!” Jonathan Sullivan: “I am 100 percent committed to drastically reducing my consumption of meat, poultry, and fish this year in an effort to live more sustainably. So far, I’m making good progress. I’m less committed, but still trying, to simultaneously reduce my sugar intake, just because. I’ve been less successful on that front.” Julie Urda: “I am pursuing a lifelong acting dream. I’m taking classes and doing improv. I’ve been in two local children’s plays and I just recorded a voiceover demo. Hoping to turn the latter into an avocation. Stay tuned.” Baeth Davis: “A goal we’re striving for here at our company is 200 new people in our business mentoring program in 2020 with a percentage of the proceeds going to the charities we support.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nI asked ’90s, “What is your best memory (from your Dartmouth career) of something that took place outside of Hanover?” Here is Part III. Bradley Bennett: “It was the fall term of my sophomore year, on my language study abroad in Granada, Spain. I remember how nice the people were, how much fun it was to sip full-liter bottles of cerveza on the sidewalk with my new Spanish friends, the beer liberating me to probably speak the best Spanish of my life. I remember being introduced to mayonnaise on French fries and walking to class on cobblestone streets. I remember the wine, the food, the siestas, the beautiful Alhambra palace and the fabulous Generalife garden. I mean, aside from mayonnaise on fries, what’s not to love about Spain?” Lauren Kehoe: “I loved my foreign study program in Toulouse, France, the spring before my Sophomore Summer in Hanover. Some of my favorite memories were of an ongoing culture battle I had with my host father. Early on, I watched Lethal Weapon on TV and told him it was weird because it’s impossible to sound truly pissed off in French. We threatened each other with foods the other found disgusting: He would threaten to bring home escargot, and I would retort that I’d only eat them if he ate some peanut butter. He was unfortunately working at home one day when I walked in the door after an hour-long ride on a hot, smelly bus that crawled all the way to my stop behind demonstrators marching in the streets. When he asked me what was wrong, I told him that in America, we support free speech and the right to assemble, but that if you exercised those rights when people just wanted to go home, they would run you over!”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nHey ’90s, our 30th reunion is June 18-21. We don’t have endless reunions, you know; they’re rare events—so register today!\n\nRecently, I asked ’90s, “What is your best memory (from your Dartmouth career) of something that took place outside of Hanover?” Here is Part II. Kyrie Robinson:“I’m in Toulouse with my foreign study abroad crew and it’s raining (France in spring sounded like a glorious idea) and we are all sitting there glumly in our raincoats on a bench, with hours to kill on some field trip or another, and Mary Vogrin says, ‘Qu’est-ce que f**k are we gonna faire?’ and we all completely cracked up. (Mary almost never swore.) I still mutter that phrase to myself when the weather seems challenging.” Parker Karnan: “When Margie Worthington, Colin Tucker, Mike Uram, Matt Greene, and I all piled into Matt’s Cherokee and spontaneously drove to Boston to buy tickets from a scalper for the U2 Joshua Tree Tour concert. We got stuck in traffic and couldn’t find parking, so we arrived just as the concert was letting out. We all bought concert T’s to fake we attended and then drove back to Hanover. Best five hours ever!”\n\nJen Gittes: “Hiking down the wrong side of a mountain (not the side we had hiked up all day) in Spain, with Kristin Young. Thankfully, by dusk we managed to hitch a ride in a van transporting vegetables back to the safety of our cozy hostel in the tiny, medieval town of La Alberca, where we enjoyed a most satisfying meal of juicy lechon and roasted potatoes.” Cat Shrier: “At the London School of Economics and Political Science I signed up for the debating society—and quickly learned that parliamentarian debate is very different from American forensics. If you’ve ever seen movies in which members of England’s houses of Parliament get up and talk trash about their opponents to the cheers and jeers of their colleagues, that’s basically what it was like. Oh my God it was so much fun!” Cheryl Shepherd: “Freshman summer, July 4th celebration at the U.S. embassy in China. They flew in McDonald’s from Hong Kong because there was no Western anything in the People’s Republic in 1987—it tasted so good! If I recall correctly, members of our Dartmouth crew took on the Marines in a chug-off.”\n\nMichael Keller: “The 1990 Glee Club spring tour took us across Texas on our way to California. Our budget always had us staying with generous alumni or finding appropriate ‘budget accommodations.’ In this particular instance, we found ourselves staying for the night in a set of abandoned and condemned dormitories at the Texas Military Institute (let your imagination run wild and you will be close). Despite being the perfect setting for a prototypical horror-slasher movie, no lives were lost, but it was certainly a fun (in retrospect) and memorable experience with many Dartmouth friends far from campus.” Jay Davis: “One of many wonderful memories outside of Dartmouth was arriving with 30 other ’90s in Long Island Sound during senior spring, after paddling 200 miles on the Connecticut River from Ledyard on Trip to the Sea. Not so great for my thesis, due eight days after we arrived at the ocean, but I have never regretted it.” Jane Demarchi: “Foreign study program in Beijing in the summer of 1988. China was so different then! Nate Emerson, Sue Mooney, John Sun, and I all missed our Sophomore Summer in Hanover. It was a life-changing experience for me and led to my living in Asia for another six years in the 1990s and early 2000s.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nWith just more than seven months ’til our 30th reunion (June 18-21), I encourage all of you to return to Hanover for this milestone weekend. I was surprised at how meaningful it was to attend our 25th, and I sense that our future Dartmouth reunions will follow suit. Take a leap and register!\n\nRecently I asked ’90s, “What is your best memory (from your Dartmouth career) of something that took place outside of Hanover?” Here is Part I. Andrew Backer: “During Sophomore Summer Mike Sullivan led Psi U brethren on field trips to various New England locales. One trip, we headed to the coast of New Hampshire, where we went to a…water park. Among the fleet of cars was Dave Yaccino’s silver 1970s-era boat of a Cadillac sedan which, miraculously, sat eight on its leather bench seating. Afterwards a few brothers decided that, being on the coast and so close to Maine, we should go in search of lobster. (Several young men from land-locked states had never had a lobster.) Our idea was to purchase lobsters, then transport them back to Hanover and cook them there. I called my grandparents, who lived close by, and when my grandmother heard the plan, she realized its stupidity and invited our whole crew over. The years obscure my memory of all participants, but in addition to Mike and Dave, Aidan O’Connell, Jimmy Yu, Jon Nordmeyer, Shailan Shah, John Burke,and I(among others) arrived on my grandparents’ doorstep, where we were greeted by my grandfather, Malcolm Tucke Curtiss, Harvard class of ’33, singing ‘Dartmouth’s in town again, run, girls, run!’ My grandfather served the still-bathing-suit-clad Dartmouth boys cocktails, then took everyone out to dinner at the local lobster shack. My grandmother, a matriarch of New England, patiently showed Yaccino, a son of Pittsburgh, how to eat his first lobster; as I recall, she recommended he eat lobster rolls in the future.” Laura Van Wie McGrory: “Sleeping under the stars on a mesa in the Samburu District of Kenya during the Environmental Studies FSP with Dartmouth friends scattered nearby, knowing (or at least imagining) that wild animals were roaming the plains below.” Scott Reed: “During our foreign study program in Berlin, John Luedke and I did 120 mph across the Autobahn in our host mother’s BMW to visit the sea lions frolicking off the island of Sylt, the northernmost point in Germany.” Kim Lewis: “Wonderful friendships forged in the special city of Siena, Italy. I returned to Siena this year with my family and walked up to the front door of my host family’s house. (Unfortunately, they were not home.)”\n\nAnd in classmate news: Rachael Winfree, a professor in the department of ecology, evolution, and natural resources at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, is one of 21 female scientists in the world (out of 184 scientists total) who made the list of “the most influential scientific minds” in the field of environment and ecology for the decade 2008-18. This list identifies the scientists with the greatest number of publications in the top 1 percent of all papers in their field, based on how often their papers have been cited.\n\nPriya (Venkatesan) Hays, who was elected to the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American College of Medical Genetics, recently published a book titled, Advancing Healthcare Through Personalized Medicine. The book, Priya’s third,provides a unique perspective on the biomedical and societal implications of personalized medicine and how it will help mitigate the healthcare crisis and rein in ever-growing expenditures.\n\nAnd Emily Hill was recently appointed by Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly to the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System Board of Trustees. Emily is executive director for the Hill Group at Morgan Stanley in Lawrence, Kansas.\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nRecently, I asked ’90s, “Looking back at your Dartmouth years, when (or with whom or with what group of people) did you feel the greatest sense of belonging?” Here is Part II.\n\nJohn Kornet: “When I was sung out of my freshman room by a bunch of Glee Clubbers as a way of telling me I had passed the audition. They are lifelong friends, five of whom I just saw last weekend, not to mention the one I married!” Catherine (Youssef) Kassenoff: “Although my philosophy foreign study program trip to Scotland ranks high on my list of ‘belongings,’ I have to say it was being a River Clusterian. Outcasts on the central campus, we River people had our own brand of fun, from jumping in the Connecticut River on icy Hanover evenings to sharing the same rickety old bicycles to get us to the farthest reaches of campus.”\n\nLaurin Grollman: “My small freshman dorm, North Fayerweather, was amazing. We were an eclectic bunch, but we were tight and appreciated each other’s idiosyncrasies. In addition to my roommates Jane Bieneman and Julie Warren, we adopted Pam Behne (who had a single because her roommate decided last-minute not to show) as a fourth, and then spent a lot of time hanging out with Darwin Brown, Ron Phillips, Ted O’Donoghue, Dave Yaccino, John Kelly,John Kornet, Steve Huang, Tom Stone, Mike Bersick, John Stouffer, Kelin Pickard, Julie Alperin, and others who made the transition into the Dartmouth community seamless and fun. Though we mostly dispersed after freshman year, that group made me feel at home pretty much from day one.”\n\nAlan Ellis: “I felt the greatest sense of belonging at Phi Tau. Like any group of people, we experienced conflict, but I felt a strong and enduring sense of acceptance as a human being.” Chris Henrich: “Dartmouth rugby football club, 60 minutes into any match with Harvard, because you knew they were about to crack wide open.” Phil Privatera: “My freshman trip. Not being an outdoorsman, I signed up for hiking level 3 (or maybe lower; it may have been a negative number). The whole time, Lori Graham had me thinking we would be attacked by bears or something. Well, we never hiked. In fact, we hooked up with a fishing trip and never fished. Essentially, we played hearts for three straight days. I can still see everyone’s faces: Sandy Yusen, Richie Mazzola, Lissa Kane, John Carrol, Rick Muise,and others. Who’d have thought we could make so much happiness doing nothing in the middle of nowhere?”\n\nAnd in classmate news, I’m pleased to announce two new books by ’90 authors. Benjamin Kwakye’s new novel, Obsessions of Paradise, “chronicles the oft-dehumanizing odyssey of migrants in search of hope and is a tender story of insecure but compelling love.” Kirkus Reviews wrote, “Kwakye’s prose finds the tension in the strangeness of place…a bubbling mysteriousness rooted in desire and longing will propel readers ever deeper into this idiosyncratic story. An oddly compelling tale of two connected couples separated by geography and culture.”\n\nAnd Marjorie Worthington,a professor of English at Eastern Illinois University, recently published The Story of “Me”: Contemporary American Autofiction. (Autofiction is fictional autobiography.) One reviewer called the book “consistently intriguing and elegantly constructed.”\n\nThis past April three Dartmouth alumni were elected to town meeting in Milton, Massachusetts, including our own Angela McConney Scheepers.\n\nAnd keep your eye out for Melanie (Schneeberger) Robbins’ new TV show, The Mel Robbins Show, which premieres on September 16. Mel (a best-selling author and highly successful speaker) may have millions of fans, but her ’90 classmates were her first fans!\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nThis month I asked ’90s, “Looking back at your Dartmouth years, when (or with whom or with what group of people) did you feel the greatest sense of belonging?” Here is Part I.\n\nScott Patterson: “I have a very special affinity for the people I met on the Dartmouth College computing network, specifically on the XYZ chat. They still hold a special place in my heart. We have a Facebook group too: facebook.com/groups/dartmouthxyz.” Ed Callaway: “That’s easy: playing music in Deacon’s Close with Flagg Miller ’91, Kelley Bishop ’86, Jim DiCarlo ’91, Jeff Garneau ’88, and P.K. Suk on Tuesday nights at Café Buon Gustaio. Dinner and beer on the house made us ‘professional’ musicians!” David Clark: “No question, walking into a football locker room and getting ready for football practice or a game gave me a sense of place and infused camaraderie that can only be understood when you are on a team and you depend on one another for success. Coach Teevens did a nice job setting expectations for us as teammates and demanding that we respect one another as a unit. That collaboration and connection with one another made me feel that my teammates were like my brothers. We were family! The second is the relationship developed with classmates Rob Summers and Eugene Sims. On gloomy days and nights on the ‘hill,’ having friends to talk to and support me through bad games, a poor grade on a test, or a difficult relationship may seem very trivial but it helped the ‘Florida boy’ through some depressing days. Even though we did not play together, we supported each other through our seasons and remained close friends after Dartmouth. This fall we are planning a visit to Miami for the Dolphins-Redskins game. We are lifelong friends, and this is what I envisioned would happen at a school such as Dartmouth.” Mike Keller: “I can’t give just one response to this question. Equally important to my overall Dartmouth experience were the Glee Club, my fraternity (Sig Epsilon), and my River Cluster family from my freshman year in French Hall (with football, freshman trips, and some specific academic class communities following closely behind). The diversity of these groups was a big part of what made my Dartmouth experience so special. I can’t imagine what it might have been like without any of them.” Mark Sternman: “Taking tea at Sanborn, running the goat trail, or playing in the Marching Band with five people who became lifelong friends (Tor Blaisdell, Roth Herrlinger, Jamie Pringle, Scott Spring, and Marilyn Cummings ’92).” Christine Smith: “My strongest memories of belonging to Dartmouth date back to freshman year and even before. First, when I got in early decision in December 1985 (seriously, ’85?), eager to bolt out of high school, I felt instantly connected as a new member of the ‘Dartmouth family’—whatever that was. And Freshman Week we all belonged. Smart kids with bad 1980s haircuts and high SAT scores and all of us members of the freshman class. Differentiation came later, but at that point we were all one highly charged teenage mass. Many pockets of belonging since then, which include all of the dear friends I’ve kept to date, but those two are the ones that have stuck with me.” Gregg DiPietro: “I felt the greatest sense of belonging around the people with whom I spent a lot of time outside the classroom—the crew team—both men and women. Within that group, ‘the boys in the boat’ (Lou Mabley, Mark Riddell, Karl Benedict, Chris Schmidt, and non-rower Rob Crawford, my Theta Epsilon Alpha house roommates) will always be like family.”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nFirst, a shout-out to Mike Kennealy, whom Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker recently named secretary of housing and economic development! Next, here is Part IV of your responses to the question, “What are your salient memories of your freshman trip?” Jane Blum Demarchi: “Although I can’t remember our group number or a lot of names, I do remember that Karen Behling was the first person I met at Dartmouth, and I still treasure our friendship.”\n\nLaura Van Wie McGrory: “Senior year, Bonnie Dickson convinced me to co-lead a hiking trip of ’93s. We volunteered for the easiest hiking level, not realizing that would guarantee us the least-experienced (and least-enthusiastic) hikers, coupled with still-challenging terrain. Add to that our inexperience reading hiking maps, and you had a recipe for missed turns and backtracking, 5-foot-3-inch Bonnie carrying a 6-foot freshman boy’s backpack in addition to her own, and a late-night arrival at our cabin with no water. I can still see our whole group standing in a circle and staring at the jug of stream water, counting the minutes for the iodine to finish doing its thing. I also admit that when a freshman girl screamed in the night that there was a mouse caught in her hair, I responded with no pity: ‘At least it’s not a skunk!’ ”\n\nCheryl Shepherd: “We were sick of eating the food in our packs and, contemplating the ‘Sticky Stew’ for dinner, a few in our group (I think Mark Campo and Richard Morris) left us on some country roadside and hitchhiked to a town. We dined on hot dogs and M&Ms that night and ate so much we felt ill. Another night we slept in a cabin above a field with cows. Kevin Luensmann, who hailed from Iowa, convinced the city slickers that you can cow tip, so we all snuck down to the field after dark. The ensuing chaos was hysterical (in retrospect). Someone shined a flashlight in the direction of a group of cows and we realized they were wide awake and tracking our approach. That was the fastest we climbed a hill the entire trip!”\n\nKyle Davis: “I recall the story of Ol’ Doc Benton, having green eggs and ham for breakfast, and meeting my first real New Englandah. I literally followed her around to listen to an accent that I’d only ever heard in movies and on TV shows.” Timothy Douros: “I shared a canoe with Mason Sandell and gradually realized I had made a friend for life.”\n\nJulia Weil Lazarus: “Preparing to be independent in college, I went to pick out hiking boots on my own, and I purchased a pair of gray boots that were cute, cheap—and woefully inadequate. I waited nervously for the bus in N.Y.C., unsure how to break the ice with all these sporty looking folks. Then, lo and behold, there was someone with the exact same boots! And that’s how I met Julie Tomasz, one of my dearest lifelong friends. We both got lots of blisters on that trip, but making a best buddy made it worth it. Our two leaders, Boomer and Phil, carried watermelons in their backpacks so we could have a cool treat. We made instant pudding cheesecake in an icy stream. There wasn’t enough room in a shelter, so Julie and I braved the tent with a few other intrepid hikers (fun!), and I recall writing an ode to our leaders to the tune of the marching song from The Bridge on the River Kwai. This non-hiker will always be extraordinarily grateful for a perfect start to my Dartmouth experience!”\n\n—Rob Crawford, 22 Black Oak Road, Weston, MA 02493; crawdaddy37@gmail.com\n\nOn the Saturday night of Homecoming Weekend, about 40 ’90s and several spouses gathered at the Hanover Inn for ’tails and dinner to celebrate our 50th birthdays. Highlights included a brief performance by Noah Drazen ’21 and his fellow Dartmouth Aires—and, because Noah’s daddy Brad Drazen and I made it a condition of the gig, we got to perform with them! (Cue Glory Days.) During the dinner Cheryl Shepherd and Brad (who co-organized the event) delivered an informal speech on what turning 50 means to all of us. At times hilarious and poignant, they brilliantly captured our collective mindset at this juncture in our lives—gratitude for joyful moments and relationships that have endured, sorrow for dreams and loved ones lost, the evolution of our definition of “success"
