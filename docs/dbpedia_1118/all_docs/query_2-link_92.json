        "text": "Famous people, for all the money and cars and clothes they possess, like to claim to really want one thing above all else: privacy. Even in a world where ubiquity has more staying power than mystery, even in a world where a meddling publicist may leak a client’s whereabouts to the paparazzi, there are still stars who project an urgent need for discretion, as though they think we might like them less if we knew they crave the attention.\n\nBut rarely does this desire for privacy come out of actual shyness; the prospect of a shy pop star — even more than their TV and movie counterparts — is sort of incongruous. Unless the star is Janet Jackson.\n\nOn the release of “Unbreakable,” her 11th album and first in seven years, this may be her most striking characteristic, one that runs counter to the let-it-all-hang-out social-media mandates weighing on young pop stars today (and Janet seems forever young). When she married Wissam Al Mana, a Qatari businessman, in 2012, few but her most dedicated fans even knew they were dating. (A previous marriage, to the Mexican music video director Rene Elizado Jr., was kept secret for eight years.) Her preference for concealment even extends to her clothing: Her Unbreakable Tour costumes have caused a small uproar on Twitter, not for how much they revealed, but how little. She has been covered from ankle to wrist, appearing in white drop-crotch pants and a long-sleeved top; the days of that fabled 1993 Rolling Stone cover, on which she appeared topless save for a pair of anonymous hands, or the Super Bowl performance, in which Justin Timberlake exposed her breast due to a “wardrobe malfunction,” are long gone.\n\nJackson grew up in the public eye, but she developed her career steadily and gingerly. Famous at the age of 10, the mystery shrouding her personal life is even starker in contrast to the hyperpublic life she previously lived as the youngest child of pop music’s first family and the even more public lives that she watched her brothers endure. As her father’s alleged abuse of his children became widely known, Jackson’s resolve for independence seemed to redouble. Her breakout album, “Control,” centered on themes of self-reliance (“What Have You Done for Me Lately?”), power (“Nasty”) and individuality (“The Pleasure Principle”). It was a gateway to feminism even for those of us who were children during its ascent up the pop charts. “Got my own mind/I wanna make my own decisions,” she declared in “Control” — a thesis of autonomy that set the mood for her whole career and a generation that followed.\n\nJackson’s identity has been relatively consistent through her entire career, even when her contemporaries (Madonna springs to mind) and family members have spent decades in endless cycles of reinvention. She has never had to explain her intent outside of her music: Take one look at how she attacks her choreography with that iconic furrowed brow or how she delivers her more aggressive songs with steely eyes and an actor’s sensibility for expression, and it’s clear enough. Even her sex-symbol status, defined in part by a girl-next-door niceness, emanates strength in its expression in the way that her songs have always put her own agency at their locus. Songs from “Funny How Time Flies” in 1986 to “No Sleeep” in 2015 are sexy because her desire is unmistakably her desire: lust mitigated by a full spectrum of emotion, an aspect of her music but not its defining point. In lieu of a personal brand, that must-have in 2015, Jackson commands a personal empire built on what looks, from the outside at least, like simply being herself.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
