        "text": "On charts throughout the music world, it’s all about the top 40. Once a single or an album passes that threshold, it has reached a certain level of success, and while hitting the top ten or even number one is of course much more sought after, the top 40 is a great place for a piece of music to begin.\n\nNow, having a top 40 hit is great, but what about ending the year as one of the top forty biggest songs? That’s an entirely different level of success. The Official Charts Company—the United Kingdom’s Billboard, essentially—just recently revealed the country’s top forty hits of 2015. Mark Ronson’s unstoppable “Uptown Funk!” is officially the biggest song of 2015 in the UK , followed by OMI’s breakout hit “Cheerleader”. While it may have been released the year prior, Irish rocker Hozier’s worldwide debut “Take Me To Church” comes in at number three, while soundtrack cuts by Ellie Goulding (“Love Me Like You Do”) and Wiz Khalifa (“See You Again”) round out the top five.\n\nWhile there are plenty of songs that were also commercial winners in this part of the world, there are some tracks that never made it to America on this top forty list. For example, James Bay’s “Hold Back The River”, which places at number eight on the year-end ranking, was a big number one in the UK, but it never made it never made much of an impact here in the States. The same can be said for the handful of hits by British pop acts like Jess Glynne and Years & Years, as well as one-offs by Lost Frequencies, Little Mix, Philip George, and several others. While the two countries may share a lot of culture, there is still quite a bit of music that only gets heard by one side of the ocean.\n\nHere is the full list of the top 40 songs in the UK last year :\n\n1.
