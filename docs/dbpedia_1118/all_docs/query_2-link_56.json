        "text": "Tomorrow’s Grammy Awards could prove to be another good night for the Brits. Soul singer Sam Smith has six nominations and could potentially be our biggest winner since Adele in 2012 (although he will have to see off Pharrell Williams and Beyoncé). Whenever a British pop star does well in the US there is a tendency for the UK media to get (over) excited. If one success is heralded as a triumphant vindication of the special Anglo-American pop relationship, two immediately starts talk of yet another British invasion.\n\nAmerica is still the biggest global music market that at the best of times seems impenetrable and impervious to the rest of the world. The Grammy nominations suggest that British pop has become a solidly successful export to the US over the last six years since Amy Winehouse won five awards in 2008. Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have multiple nominations, Charlie XCX, alt-J, Disclosure, Bastille, Basement Jaxx, Aphex Twin, Arctic Monkeys and Motörhead are all in with a shout. Smith and Sheeran will be performing at the ceremony in Los Angeles tomorrow night, along with Annie Lennox, Jessie J and Tom Jones. And young hip-hop fans confused about the identity of the wrinkled old white guy strumming acoustic guitar behind Kanye West and Rihanna might be interested to learn Sir Paul McCartney’s former beat combo kicked off the original British pop invasion back in 1964.\n\nFor one week in January, there were four acts in the US top five that Britain could claim as its own: Sheeran, Smith, Hozier (an Irishman but one signed and developed in Britain) and Mark Ronson (although I suspect even most British people think the New York-based Londoner is American). It reflects confidence about British music back home, where all top 10 bestselling albums last year were by homegrown names. And there is something else at work, because you can certainly see a connection between Smith, Sheeran and Hozier. They all make music that has an organic, analogue feel, using traditional instruments (pianos and guitars rather than synths and samples) and relying on strong, meaningful lyrics and soulful vocals. And none of them conform to the usual pin-up standards of appearance.\n\nIn a typical outburst on his radio show, US shock jock Howard Stern described Smith as “an ugly mother------.” This was apparently intended as a compliment, with Stern adding “he’s fat and he’s gay and little girls worship him. That’s when you know you have a good song and a good voice.” Despite the offensive tone, it raises the intriguing notion that British artists embody a quality of authenticity otherwise missing from American mainstream pop and embodied by previous Grammy winners like Adele and Mumford & Sons. Americans may see us as ugly, but (to paraphrase Leonard Cohen) we have the music.\n\nA vox pop survey of 27 American high school students from Pittsburgh uncovered interesting notions of transatlantic differences, with themes of “sophistication” and “romance” emerging prominently. “American pop centres around the degrading or dirty, British pop goes above,” as one girl put it. Yet only a third of the girls actually knew Smith was British (24 identified Sheeran as British while just four could say the same about Ronson). “The internet and social media make cultural sharing easier between English-speaking countries, so the lines are blurring,” one student noted.\n\n“People in the US are more global in their thinking than they ever have been,” according to music business analyst Jay Frank. Success breeds success, and US record companies have begun paying close attention to BBC Radio One, “which clearly does a great job of identifying new British talent that can then potentially get exported around the world”. Frank specifically identifies the growth of streaming service Spotify, with its global playlists, as being hugely influential, with European acts like Hozier registering months before their music is released in America. “It is just not cool to be closed-minded about borders anymore. The typical teenager and twentysomething in the US wants to be seen as knowledgeable about everything going on around the world. It’s a badge of honour to like British artists.”"
