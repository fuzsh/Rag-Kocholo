        "meta_description": "Second Encounter by Christian Frentzen, released 17 March 2023\n\n1. Familiar Feelings (feat. Nir Felder)\n2. Say It Like You Mean It (feat. Andy Haderer &amp; Paul heller)\n3. Find Another You (feat. Dannielle De Andrea)\n4. Freedom Song\n5. Without A Doubt (feat. Norbert Scholly)\n6. Interludio\n7. Piece For Esbjoern Svensson (feat. Norbert Scholly)\n8. Hot Summer Blues\n9. Outlines (feat. Menzel Mutzke)\n10. Spirit Lead The Way (feat. Alana Alexander)\n\nSecond Encounter is a collection of songs I wrote during the pandemic. Rather a collage of musical styles I like listening to, it’s anything but a concept album. Each song came from a different place, whatever musical territory I was exploring at that time. It very much resembles a playlist of music, so to speak. From jazz influences to blues, folk, Americana and world music: I could never submit myself to one genre only. What’s more, I started writing vocal songs with lyrics, which I recorded and sang as demos and then decided to incorporate them on the album. Luckily I know some of the finest singers who helped make these songs sound even better than I could imagine. \r\nThe recording process then was split into several recording sessions, starting out with a few instrumental sessions in a trio/quartet formation, mostly recorded at Hansahaus Studios, Bonn (with mastermind Klaus Genuit). At that time masks and corona test results determined our get-togethers. I then edited the tracks and recorded other parts as overdubs in various studios. Many of those songs were written with feature guests in my mind and to my surprise they all agreed and joined in. Apart from many talented musicians from Cologne, Germany, I was thrilled to have a few American artists as special guests: thank you Nir Felder, Dannielle De Andrea and Alana Alexander - your musical gift is very special!",
