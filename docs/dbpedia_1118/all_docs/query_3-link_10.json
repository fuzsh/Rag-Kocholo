It is part of the Masked Singer franchise which began in South Korea and features celebrities singing songs while wearing head-to-toe costumes and face masks concealing their identities. Hosted by Matthias Opdenhövel, the program employs panelists who guess the celebrities' identities by interpreting clues provided to them throughout each season. Since the tenth season, Palina Rojinski and Rick Kavanian are the main panelists. Other panelists from previous seasons include Collien Ulmen-Fernandes, Max Giesinger, Bülent Ceylan, Sonja Zietlow, Rea Garvey, Álvaro Soler and Ruth Moschner. The audience vote for their favorite singer after all perform. The least popular is eliminated, taking off their mask to reveal their identity.[1][2]\n\nThe broadcast format started in South Korea in 2015 as King of Mask Singer. After further offshoots in Asia and the United States in January 2019, the show was announced in March 2019 to begin in Germany and made its debut in June 2019 on ProSieben.[3] On 24 April 2020, ProSieben announced the third season, which began airing on 20 October 2020.[4] The fourth season, which was announced shortly after, began airing on 16 February 2021.[5][6] The fifth season was announced on 18 March 2021 and began airing on 16 October 2021.[7]\n\nDuring the fifth season, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a sixth season, which premiered on 19 March 2022. On the second episode of the sixth season, Matthias Opdenhövel announced the seventh season of the show, which premiered on 1 October 2022.\n\nIn each live episode, celebrities such as singers, actors or athletes compete against each other in a singing competition anonymously in costumes. The voices of the celebrities are distorted beyond recognition outside of singing.\n\nIn the first season, viewers voted by Televoting after each Duel or Truel, since the second season voting took place exclusively via the ProSieben-app.[8] The winners may keep the mask on and participate in the next episode. With repeated or without repeated singing, the losers have to wait for the final vote of the respective show. The singer with the fewest votes has to take off his or her mask and leave the show. The others continue to participate.\n\nIn seasons 1 and 3, in the final of the last five there was a vote after the vocal performances, after which the person with the fewest votes was eliminated and unmasked. This was followed by two semi-final duels, the losers of which had to reveal themselves and the winners of which competed in the final duel. Finally, their identity was also revealed. In season 2 and since season 4, there is a final four. After each round of performing, one contestant has to leave and take off his or her mask. After the final duel, the winner of the season is revealed. In season 10, there were only three contestants in the final. After the first round the first mask fell. The last two contestants competed in the second and the third round.\n\nIn the second season, contestant Angelo Kelly left the competition voluntarily in episode 3 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' distorted voices. The panelists are given time to speculate the identity of the singer after the performance and ask them a single question to try to determine their identity.\n\nThe opening theme is \"Who Are You\" by The Who.\n\nAfter each appearance, the two panelist members – three during the first season – and a guest member of the advice team who changes from episode to episode express their guess as to who is under the mask. The panelist team also asks a question to almost every singer, who only answers vaguely or evasively. Before making any decision, the panelist team makes an assumption after the voting has ended, for whom it will be tight or who will be eliminated. Before unmasking, the celebrities are once more asked to give their final guess about who is beneath the mask.\n\nThe show has an 'extreme security protocol' in effect both during and after filming to protect the celebrity's identities from leaking. Everyone involved in the show signed a non-disclosure agreement which prevented anyone from revealing any information about the shooting dates, costumes or identities of the masks episode until its broadcast. The celebrities who appear on the show are only allowed to inform their spouse about their participation, who must also sign one.\n\nDue to the show's security, celebrities said they never encountered another masked participant on set, or if they did, could not speak to them. They are only allowed to communicate with those who wear a special cloth on the back of their clothing which is changed each season to prevent replication or those who wear a shirt with the words \"Talk to Me\". To do so, they use a portable voice changer or write on a whiteboard.\n\nThe costumes worn by the celebrity contestants were designed by Marina Toybina, a four-time Emmy Award winner and by Alexandra Brander. Each costume costs on average between 15,000 and 20,000 Euros and takes around 300 hours of manual labor.[9]\n\nFilming of the show took place at MMC Studios in Cologne. The Masked Singer Austria and The Masked Singer Switzerland are produced in the same studio as the German version.[10]\n\nOn 12 March 2020 in the second season of the show, ProSieben announced that, as a precautionary measure against the spread of the coronavirus, all shows, including The Masked Singer, would be producing without a studio audience until further notice.[11] On 29 March 2020, ProSieben announced that it would interrupt the show due to two COVID-19 infections within the team and the show continued from 14 April 2020.[12]\n\nProSieben announced that the third season of the show, would be again produced with audience. On 30 October 2020, after the second episode, ProSieben announced that it would once again be producing without a studio audience until further notice.[13]\n\nThe fourth season, produced again without audience.\n\nAfter a year and a half of a pandemic-related break, the fifth season was seen a live audience in the studio for the first time.[14]\n\nSince the first season, host of the show is Matthias Opdenhövel.[15] In the first two seasons, the permanent panel has consisted of TV presenter Ruth Moschner. In the first season, the other two panelists were actor Collien Ulmen-Fernandes and singer Max Giesinger.[16] In the second season, singer Rea Garvey, replaced Ulmen-Fernandes and Giesinger.[17] In the third season the panelists included comedian Bülent Ceylan and TV presenter Sonja Zietlow.[18] In the fourth season, Moschner and Garvey returned to the panel.[19] The fifth season, Moschner was her fourth time and Garvey was his third time, as the main panelists.[20][21] Also in the sixth season, Moschner and Garvey were the main panelists.[22] Thore Schölermann acted as guest host for the first episode of the sixth season after Opdenhövel tested positive for COVID-19.[23] In the seventh season, Moschner was only the main panelist and in the eighth season, Garvey returned as main panelist alongside Moschner. In the ninth season, Moschner returned as main panelist, with Álvaro Soler (episodes 1-3) and Rick Kavanian (episodes 4-6) as new main panelists, replacing Garvey.[24][25] In the tenth season, Kavanian returned as main panelist, with new member Palina Rojinski.[26]\n\nCast timeline Cast Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Host Matthias Opdenhövel Main Thore Schölermann Does not appear Mask Does not appear Guest Does not appear Panelists Ruth Moschner Main Guest Main Does not appear Collien Ulmen-Fernandes Main Does not appear Max Giesinger Main Does not appear Guest Rea Garvey Guest Main Guest Main Guest Main Guest Does not appear Bülent Ceylan Mask Guest Main Does not appear Sonja Zietlow Does not appear Mask Main Does not appear Álvaro Soler Does not appear Guest Does not appear Main Does not appear Rick Kavanian Does not appear Mask Guest Main Palina Rojinski Does not appear Main\n\nContestants\n\nResults Stage name Celebrity Notability Live Episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 A B C Astronaut Max Mutzke Singer WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN SAFE WIN WINNER Grashüpfer \"Grasshopper\" Gil Ofarim Singer RISK WIN WIN WIN RISK SAFE WIN RUNNER-UP Engel \"Angel\" Bülent Ceylan Comedian WIN WIN RISK RISK WIN SAFE OUT Monster Susi Kentikian Boxer RISK WIN WIN WIN RISK SAFE OUT Kudu Daniel Aminati Presenter WIN WIN WIN RISK WIN OUT Panther Stefanie Hertel Singer WIN RISK RISK WIN OUT Eichhörnchen \"Squirrel\" Marcus Schenkenberg Model WIN RISK RISK OUT Kakadu \"Cockatoo\" Heinz Hoenig Actor RISK RISK OUT Schmetterling \"Butterfly\" Susan Sideropoulos Actress RISK OUT Oktopus \"Octopus\" Lucy Diakovska Singer OUT\n\nThe masked singer won their face-off and remained in the competition.\n\nThe masked singer lost their face-off and was in the bottom five/four/three/two, but was not eliminated.\n\nThe masked singer was safe from elimination.\n\nThe masked singer was eliminated from the competition and unmasked upon their elimination.\n\nEpisodes\n\nPerformances on the first live episode[27] #
