        "text": "The English language is no superior to any other language and we've seen Eurovision artists performing in Spanish, French, tiny bits of German or other languages despite their countries' official languages being completely different ones. I don't see the harm and we all have to make do of this situation somehow. Also, we sometimes see artists representing countries in Eurovision without having any ties to them, e.g. Eleni (Cyprus), Victor (Estonia), San Marino's entrants (minus Valentina) to some extent even Ben Dolic, etc.\n\nI think it's a lovely and refreshing idea which is clearly targeted at a German/Swiss/Austrian audience but given the fact that other artists might not be able to travel to FESC's location, I think it's the best way to make sure that each artist have the \"same chances\".\n\nAlso, Germany is one of the most culturally/ethnically diverse countries in Europe and Eurovision should unite people from different countries, cultures and backgrounds and I applaud Raab/Pro7 for showcasing Germany's diversity and talents in a unique way which hasn't been done before.\n\nOf course, I would have preferred a Eurovision 2.0 but it's simply not possible at this time/stage/under these circumstances.\n\nThey should try to bring Capital Bra for - I hate him/his \"music\" but Pro7 really needs to go all in to attract all non-hardcore Eurovision fans because I guess that most of us will watch Europe Shine a Light at ARD's show instead.\n\nRight I heard about the contest but I don't know whats happening?\n\nFrom what I have seen on here it will be German singers who have roots in other countries taking part. So its basically Eurovision but with only German singers? All performing songs. Voting. Results?\n\nSounds a lot better than the crap the EBU have put together: \"Eurovision: Here's what you could have had\"\n\nYes, it's indeed happening: Conchita Wurst will be one of the hosts, we will see 15 different countries (or more) being represented by German artists or (artists based in Germany/Austria/Switerland?). The German/Swiss/Austrian viewers will actually cast their votes via calls whilst the other 12 countries (or more) will vote via juries.\n\nIt sounds promising but given the fact that I do not really like \"German Pop/Rap/Rock\", it can go either way....\n\nMy guesses:\n\nLucy Diakovska (No Angels)\n\nVanessa Mai\n\nStefan Raab\n\nMaite/Patricia Kelly (ex Kelly Family member)\n\nGil Ofarim\n\nGiovanni Zarrella (Bro'Sis, quite popular Schlager artist)\n\nErwin Kintop\n\nIlse DeLange\n\nMark Foster\n\nAlvaro Soler / Nico Santos\n\nStefanie Heinzmann\n\nElif\n\nHurts\n\nActually, I don't know any artists with ties to living/residing/being based in Germany.\n\nWhen I think of , Andreas Gabalier comes into my mind but there's no way he will be part of this.\n\nStefanie Heinzmann won Raab's talent show and he's been a radio darling ever since. I think she's set.\n\nIt has been announced that 2 former Eurovision participatns are involved: Lucy (Germany 2008 as part of the No Angels) is basically set, she's the only known Bulgarian artist in Germany (I think) and she has strong ties to German media.\n\nThe other might be Ilse DeLange (The Commeont Linnets, The Netherlands 2014) - She's currently part of another German TV show (Sing meinen Song), has collaborated with the BossHoss and has ties with private broadcasters in Germany. She's currently released a song with Michael Schulte. This would be a GREAT boost for her career in Germany and it seems that her management is trying to achieve this.\n\nErwin Kintop (finalist of The Voice of Germany this year)'s father is from Kazakhstan, I think he's on lock as well.\n\nVanessa Mai would be huge, her father is from Croatia and she's like the biggest female artist in Germany right now (minus Helene Fischer).\n\nI know that Hurts for is a bold guess but actually, they are about to drop a comeback single THIS FRIDAY (\"Voices\") and they have uploaded several cryptic messages on their social media accounts and apparently, they say that a \"live performance\" follows \"very soon\". Hurts' biggest market is the German one: They have kicked off their entire career in Germarny (recording their album, music video, live performances) and they are more successful in Germany (than anywhere else) - I don't know if it's possible for them to come to Germany but if I were their management, I would try to get them to Cologne to take part in the Free European Song Contest ASAF!\n\nSome might now Elif (Turkish/German singer) due to WorldVision.\n\nGil Ofarim would be my guess for - He's quite known and just released a comeback album 3 months ago (which reached the German Top 5!)\n\nSome might now Elif (Turkish/German singer) due to WorldVision.\n\nAnd don't forget her successful participation in FSC\n\nI know that Hurts for is a bold guess but actually, they are about to drop a comeback single THIS FRIDAY (\"Voices\") and they have uploaded several cryptic messages on their social media accounts and apparently, they say that a \"live performance\" follows \"very soon\". Hurts' biggest market is the German one: They have kicked off their entire career in Germarny (recording their album, music video, live performances) and they are more successful in Germany (than anywhere else) - I don't know if it's possible for them to come to Germany but if I were their management, I would try to get them to Cologne to take part in the Free European Song Contest ASAF!\n\nDidn't know they're living in Germany. Are you sure they fulfill the criteria?\n\nAbout the rest. It seems legit, even though there's one former eurovision entrant too many Then again Raab mentioned the former eurovision stars to be successful and we all remember what happened to Lucy^^\n\nIt can be that Raab just wants to play cat & mouse and the public can't actually believe it's him. Then again it sounded like the german singer never was in Eurovision before. I could also see Max Mutzke going for it. Anyway, the german entry remains the biggest mysterium for me. Could be any artist to me.\n\nI bet against Maite/Patricia Kelly for Ireland. Not against the Kelly Family. Just against them. I'd still go for Michael Patrick (The Voice coach, host of Sing Meinen Song, one of the most professional musicians of the family still). The rest went more for entertainment auditions. Not that this show wouldn't fit them, but I'd go more for the music.\n\nI'm tired of Zarella being part of any TV show. Ofarim, Forster, Kintop & Mai would be those artists I struggle with to see. But I guess two of them are set at least. I wonder if Ofarim and Kintop can speak any word of \"their\" countries language, wouldn't rule it out. Just curious. If Forster something polish would be cool. Same goes for Mai and croatian.\n\nRest of the list would be fine for me.\n\nidk why ppl compare this to the actual ESC show, yes when comparing them it makes no sense.\n\nAside from that, it seems like a fun lil' project, especially for German ESC fans to spend their evening with.\n\nWell, it's called ESC and it's held at the same night. And in today's press conference they said they want to do it every year, get more broadcasters involved and potentially keep it on ESC night. I don't think it will be a big thing across Europe but Raab is still relevant in Germany and his format could be a \"threat\" to the actual competition, given that it is struggling in Germany already.\n\nHowever, the contestants are exactly what I was expecting (like Sarah Lombardi for Italy lol) and very similar to the BuViSoCo contestants. And that was cancelled for a reason..."
