Will they be nice or standoffish? These unknowns always make me a little nervous. It was no different when I sat down to talk to The Voice’s Jessie Pitts, but I realized pretty quickly that this hometown beauty isn’t your run of the mill pop star.\n\nJessie, whose first single comes out this summer, is a graduate of Hoover’s Spain Park. She competed on The Voice in 2014, making it to the top 12. I could go on and on about her stage presence and vocal range, but what makes this girl one to watch has nothing to do with her singing ability. What makes Jessie amazing is what she wants to do with her talent and the impact that she wants to make on society.\n\nWe, of course, talked about The Voice, her upcoming shows, and her new song, but the thing that Jessie talked about that really stuck with me is how she wants to be a positive role model for girls. She wants her fans to see her become successful without wearing skimpy clothes or riddling her songs with vulgar lyrics. She wants them to know that they should stand up for themselves and embrace their uniqueness, because it is what makes them wonderful.\n\nIt is absolutely refreshing to find Jessie Pitts in this world of Mileys, Kardashians, and Iggy Azaleas. She is a reminder that there are performers out there who want to succeed because of their talent and not because of their scandalous behavior or raunchy clothing. It is wonderful to know that, even at her young age, Jessie knows that she wants to be a positive influence on our girls and teach them what it means to be a lady. Our world needs more people like this Alabama girl!"
