The actor was flying high thanks to movies like “The Godfather,” “Dog Day Afternoon” and “Serpico” and the singer was laying low, taking a break from recording so he could spend time with wife Yoko and young son Sean.\n\n“I saw him and we smiled at each other,” recalls Pacino, 74. “He lived at the Dakota and I didn’t live far from there. It was nice. I was just so pleased, flattered that he recognized me.”\n\nJohn Lennon has been on Pacino’s mind quite a bit lately thanks to “Danny Collins,” a new comedy which uses a letter from the former Beatle as a major plot point.\n\nIn the movie, which opens April 3, Pacino plays the title character, a one-time “new Dylan” who, following a sophomore slump, morphs into a cheesy pop star. Out of the blue, his manager (Christopher Plummer) discovers a decades-old undelivered letter written to him by John Lennon, urging Danny to stay true to his art.\n\nThe letter gives Danny the impetus to change course. He sets out to reconnect with his son (Bobby Cannavale) and daughter-in-law (Jennifer Garner) and takes a shine to a substantial woman (Annette Bening) he meets along the way.\n\nDanny Collins might be a bit of a mess when the movie begins but Pacino sees him as the ultimate survivor.\n\n“He’s at this point in his life where a letter from John Lennon that was sent 30 years ago is kind of a good catalyst,” says the actor. “Maybe ten years earlier, he wouldn’t have done anything about it. But the fact that he uses that letter shows that he’s a survivor because he’s at the end of the line.\n\n“It was one of the things that got me going, [the chance] to play someone who’s a survivor, who’s got a certain energy, a certain pace. I was happy that those were some of the keys.”\n\nWhile figuring out how to bring Danny to life, Pacino began looking at rock stars of a certain age.\n\n“The best thing an actor can get is [the idea of] someone real for who you’re playing,” says Pacino. “That way you’ve got a model … The early instincts are the ones you stay with. And I had the instinct that [Danny] was a cross between Barry Manilow and Rod Stewart. I thought of [Danny] as the love child of those two.”\n\nFor the younger Danny, Pacino imagined a folk-rocker in the tradition of Leonard Cohen, Paul Simon and Dylan.\n\n“[There’s] a lot of Bob Dylan in the younger Danny [so I put him] in my head too but I didn’t mimic any of them. I didn’t think about them much except in the way I formulated certain things.\n\n“The movie is the story of this kid who’s touted as the next Dylan. He first comes along and he writes this song, and he’s a superstar, and then comes the fall right afterward.”\n\nPacino admired Danny’s determination to keep reinventing himself for an ever-changing marketplace.\n\n“In a way, he didn’t recover and, in a way, he did. The way he recovered is that he went to other attributes he had, like he can dance. There was a certain look he had. He was also a bit of a charmer. He could put over a song. He didn’t have a great voice, but … he’s a survivor.”\n\nAnother aspect of the movie which fascinated Pacino was the degree to which Danny is worn out by his penchant for hard-living.\n\n“He’s got [this] ravaged life, with the dope and the alcohol and the women and the wives he can’t even remember, and the lifestyle and the loneliness and the isolation of it all,” notes the actor. “It’s sad. And yet at the same time a lot of us can identify with it. You don’t have to be a rock star. So I liked that. “\n\nThrough the years, Pacino has met many of the rock stars who are namechecked in “Danny Collins.”\n\n“I knew Bob Dylan,” he says. “I spent time with Bob Dylan. That was in the seventies, which I don’t remember. I can’t even tell you what we talked about. I know some rockers. I know Jay Z. I know Mick Jagger. You run into people. I’ve been around so long. “\n\nThe Bronx-born Pacino has, in fact, been acting since he was barely out of high school.\n\n“I was acting since I was really young, in school plays, and then I went to the Village, and we did plays,” he recalls. “I did 16 shows a week. We used to pass the basket at the end of the show. That’s how we lived. So, that was my life.\n\n“I was doing a lot of different things. I was doing revues. I was doing comedy. I was doing it to eat, and it was a game to me.”\n\nIn his early 20s, Pacino began taking on more challenging assignments and, almost instantly, he knew he’d found his place in the world.\n\n“It wasn’t until I started to really delve into roles that demanded more of me that I realized I was going [to act] for the rest of my life,” says Pacino. “It opened me up to another world. I mean, the great classics, like Strindberg, O’Neill, Shakespeare, Chekhov.\n\n“I had this bit of a seminal moment … when I was about 21, 22, and I knew that I could exist in the [acting world]. I knew then that I was … going to be OK. “\n\nWhen he was 26, Pacino was accepted into the prestigious Actors Studio, where he studied under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg, the creator of the Method Approach to performing.\n\nNot long afterwards, Francis Ford Coppola spotted Pacino in a play and decided he was the right actor to play Michael Corleone in “The Godfather” even though Paramount preferred a big box-office draw like Ryan O’Neal, Robert Redford or Warren Beatty.\n\n“[Coppola] and I had known each other for a year, and he’d wanted me for another movie which never got made, so I spent almost a week with him in San Francisco and then I didn’t hear from him for a year,” says Pacino.\n\n“I guess that was a very valuable week because we re-connected, and then he saw me in that part of Michael, and nobody could shake him from it, and everybody wanted to too, including me at one point. But he stayed with it and that turned out to be extremely fortuitous and lucky for me.”\n\n“The Godfather” was not only an enormous box-office hit but it netted Pacino a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Through the years, Pacino has created a panoply of indelible characters in movies as wide-ranging as “Scarface,” “Dick Tracy,” “Glengarry Glen Ross,” “Heat,” “The Insider” and last year’s “The Humbling.”\n\nHe’s been nominated for eight Oscars and won once for “Scent Of A Woman.” On TV, he’s enjoyed critical acclaim for playing Roy Cohn, Jack Kevorkian and Phil Spector.\n\nUnlike Danny Collins, Pacino has tried to follow his own path.\n\n“My own art? Yeah, I think I did [stay true to my art]. I have to say, as modestly as I can say it, that I think I’ve done that,” says the never-married actor, who is the father of three children – Julie, 26 (with acting coach Jan Tarrant), and twins Olivia and Anton, 14 (with actress Beverly D’Angelo.)\n\n“And I was reminded by people who I loved, and who supported me all my life that, ‘Al, remember the theater.’ My dear mentor and friend Lee Strasberg was one of those people who kept talking to me about going back to where I came from, which is theater. And it was a constant reminder. I went off the track, of course, like anybody would, but I had help and support going back on.”\n\nOriginally Published: April 2, 2015 at 11:09 p.m."
