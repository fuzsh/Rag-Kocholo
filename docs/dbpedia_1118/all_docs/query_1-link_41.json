        "text": "David Holler, originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has been living in Zürich for over 25 years, making a name for himself in the Swiss music scene as a renowned singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and music producer. His father, Dick Holler, is celebrated for writing iconic songs for artists such as Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Cher, Whitney Houston, and Bob Dylan, with his work also featured in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nIn the 2000s, David co-wrote songs for some of Switzerland’s most iconic artists before shifting his focus to his own music. His critically acclaimed 2012 song \"Odeon\" has been a staple on Radio Swiss Jazz for over a decade. His 2017 album Offline Friends enjoyed success, with five tracks receiving significant radio airplay.\n\nIn 2020, David served as the personal vocal coach for Roger Federer and his nine choir singers for the popular \"Sunrise We\" commercial.\n\nIn 2023, David released his fourth single, \"A Mountain on the Moon,\" co-written with the legendary Lobo (Kent Lavoie), whose iconic hit \"I’d Love You to Want Me\" reached #2 on the Billboard Charts in the USA and held the #1 spot on the Official German Charts for 13 weeks.\n\nIn 2024, David’s new single, \"One Kiss, Two Hearts, One Love,\" is a romantic ballad written for a special couple who discovered true love later in life. David debuted the song at the couple's wedding, set in the picturesque, tree-lined alleys of the Enea Tree Museum in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland, near Lake Zürich.\n\nCurrently, David spends most of his time writing and producing his own music at his studio in Seebach. Alongside his creative work, he serves as a songwriting and vocal coach at instrumentor.ch. Happily married and living in Zürich, David remains active as a performer, entertaining audiences with his original songs, playing piano, and singing at both private and public events.\n\nFor more information, interviews, or media inquiries, please contact:\n\nDavid Holler\n\nBirchstrasse 414\n\n8052 Zürich\n\nTel: +41 79 704 7424\n\nEmail: hollerdavid@yahoo.com\n\nWebsite: davidholler.com"
