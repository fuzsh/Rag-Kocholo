        "text": "When\n\nWhere\n\nMemories\n\nMay 1 Wyoming/Casper\n\n(Events Center) Best Show Ever! Because it was all the good ol' songs of Barry's. The Intro song with the lights, the stage, was just THE BEST!! You felt as though you were going down memory Lane! Of all the concerts I've attended, Barry still does the BEST!! - Daren Collins (Mesa, AZ) (8/18/98)\n\nIt was the first time I got to know who Barry was. I was fifteen and supposed to like anyone who was popular, but no! My friend and I showed all of our Jr. High who Mr. Barry Manilow was and is! It was really fun!! - Mindy Sterner (Casper, WY) (3/1/2001)\n\nMay 2 Montana/Billings\n\n(MetraPark) May 4 North Dakota/Bismarck\n\n(Civic Center) I got 3rd row center seats! The show started with \"Ready to Take a Chance Again.\" The stage was dark with just enough light to see Barry's silhouette standing on the top of a set of steps behind a curtain. He started the concert by walking down the steps singing. This was the 2nd time I saw him. I never thought I would see him once - I have since seen him a total of six times! - Lisa Rinehart (Fargo, North Dakota) (12/14/2013) May 5 Minnesota/Mankato\n\n(Civic Center) First Show Memory: \"We were so far back and could hardly see him at all, but oh, could we hear him! Wonderful. There were two women sitting beside us who...claimed they only came to see the Mass choir and were really not Barry fans. However, they knew EVERY word to EVERY song!!\" - Jude and KT (6/24/97)\n\nFavorite Show: Barry sang a lot of big band songs and his slower more romantic songs which he does so well. The atmosphere and mood was great and so was he!! - Mardi Milostan (Rochester, MN) (12/4/98)\n\nTickets to the concert in Rochester was a wonderful gift. I believe this had more Big Band hits in it. It was great. - Melinda (of Rochester, MN) (3/2/2008)\n\nFirst Show - Mike Willaert (Mankato, Minnesota) (1/26/2015)\n\nHighlights: Wild Places / New York City Rhythm / Weekend In New England / Looks Like We Made It / Some Kind Of Friend / Moonlight Serenade / Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree / Don't Get Around Much Anymore / And The Angels Sing / I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time / I'll Never Smile Again / Chattanooga Choo Choo / Could It Be Magic (ballad + dance version) / One Voice\n\nMay 6 Illinois/Moline\n\n(The Mark) Best Show Memory: I had gotten away from Barry's music for quite a while and when I \"rediscovered\" him I realized how much I had missed him! This was my first concert in about 13 years! - Terri Wise (9/6/97) May 8 Colorado/Denver\n\n(Temple Buell Theatre) Barry was doing the \"Big Bands\" tour that year and hearing the 'stars in the windows' story made for a precious experience. I had tears streaming through that whole segment! I love it when Barry shares his discoveries with us. Of course any enclosed theater really enhances Barry's performance and we all enjoy the intimacy with him! - Marian Schramm (Seattle, WA) (9/11/98)\n\nFavorite Show: I went to Denver to visit a friend and take him out for his 40th birthday ... we were lucky enough to get front row seats directly in front of the piano. I hate to admit it, but I actually \"heckled\" Barry. He said he was too hip for his own band as he started singing \"Im to sexy for my shirt...Heck, I'm too sexy for my underwear!\" I couldn't help it (must've been the wine at dinner) I yelled \"I'll take 'em!\" Well, Barry bent over laughing, then wagged a finger at me. The rest of the evening he kept playing to us and aiming those CIBM thrusts my way. It was a very fun evening! - Jackie Desposito (of New York) (2/11/99)\n\nFavorite concert: My husband surprised me with the tickets (which were in the 6th row). Barry knocked it out the ballpark that night. Love ya, Barry! You had me at \"Mandy\" and you've never let go of my heart!! - Janetta Messmer (of Kansas) (5/21/2012)\n\nHighlights: Wild Places / New York City Rhythm / Some Kind Of Friend / Could It Be Magic (dance version)\n\nMay 9 Colorado/Denver\n\n(Temple Buell Theatre) This was the best concert I've ever been to. Even though I didn't get to go up on stage and sing wit him, this was the best because it was SO intimate. We were 4 rows back and it was like having my own personal Barry Manilow concert. I laughed, I cried, I loved it. Thanks Barry! - Cindy Raasch (Denver, CO) (11/25/98)\n\nMy husband and I always try to take my mom to see Barry in concert whenever possible. May 9th, 1995 would have been my parents 43rd anniversary, however, my dad passed away the previous December. Mom and Dad saw Barry numerous times in Las Vegas, and in Ft. Worth. Whenever I hear \"I Write the Songs,\" I can hear my dad at the top of his lungs singing right along. I was worried about taking my mom to this concert, because I knew it would be a tough day for her, but she was a trooper and said \"let's go.\" The concert was fabulous! Barry never slowed down. At the end of the concert, I looked at Mom pulling the confetti from her hair (we had great seats), and she stated \"I'm exhausted!\" I know that May 9th will always have a special meaning for her, obviously, but May 9th, 1995, was [extra] special, thanks to Barry. - Carole Fleming (South Fork, CO) (10/22/2001)\n\nHighlights: Wild Places / Weekend In New England / Some Kind Of Friend / Could It Be Magic (dance version)\n\nMay 11 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) I have seen many entertainers live, but my heart has never been as full as when I see Barry. It is not hard, after experiencing one of his concerts, to see how easily a person could fall head over heels in love with him, to see someone so dedicated and committed! His sense of humor, kindness and compassion all come through. He doesn't just sing. His vibrance radiates through all the fluff and hype of being such a tremendously HUGE star, and the real, legitimate musician beams for all to see, and we are able to be part of him through his music. Anyone who has ever been to one of the shows can testify to the unexplainable magic that the entire audience shares with Barry. - Kristen Knight (Las Vegas, NV) (3/10/2002)\n\nMay 14: I travelled three hours by car to Spokane, WA, then flew Southwest Airlines with a sinus head cold. I landed with the most severe earache of my life! My taxi driver would not take a credit card so I had to literally fly through the hotel lobby to find an ATM! The staff at the hotel was awesome, and with two hours to show time, I finally would see Barry's show. I arrived to purchase my ticket [at the box office] but they were SOLD OUT! A beautiful, very classy lady though let go of her ticket. She said she had seen his show all week [already, so] I got her seat!! I wore white; did not know I would 'glow in the dark' in a room full of sequins and black suits! Show time!! Barry wore my favourite suit: BLUE! His show was phenomenal. Magical! I bent down under the table to hide my coughing. Barry said to 'look up' (to the audience) and when I looked up I saw all this awesome confetti and ticker tape falling from the ceiling. It was SO fiesta! The acoustics were amazing and Barry sounded great. Time stood still! I felt like this show was for me. I am sure everyone felt this way. This was also Mother's Day, his first since his mom's passing... - Melody Clark-Marlow (Peace River, Alberta, Canada) (8/1/2011)\n\nMay 11 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / Brooklyn Blues / Mandy / Wild Places / City Rhythm Medley: New York City Rhythm/Avenue C/Jumpin' At The Woodside/Bandstand Boogie / Weekend In New England / Deja Vu/I'll Never Love This Way Again (with Debra Byrd) / Copacabana (At The Copa) / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment: Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree, Don't Get Around Much Anymore, And The Angels Sing, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, I'll Never Smile Again, Chattanooga Choo Choo, Moonlight Serenade (Reprise) / Could It Be Magic (Slow Version)/Could It Be Magic (Dance Version) + encore / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nMay 12 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / I'm Hip / Brooklyn Blues / Memory / Wild Places / City Rhythm Medley / Weekend In New England / Deja Vu/I'll Never Love This Way Again (with Debra Byrd) / Copacabana (At The Copa) / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment / Could It Be Magic (Slow Version)/Could It Be Magic (Dance Version) + encore / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nMay 13 Highlights: It's A Miracle / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / I'm Hip / Brooklyn Blues / If Tomorrow Never Comes / Wild Places / City Rhythm Medley / Weekend In New England / Deja Vu/I'll Never Love This Way Again (Debra Byrd)...\n\nMay 12 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) May 13 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) May 14 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) May 15 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) May 16 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) May 18 Arizona/Phoenix\n\n(Desert Sky Pavilion) First Show memory: It was a Mother's Day present from my husband and kids. The Big Bands Show was awesome! I was sitting in the back, but they had big screens so we could see Barry and hear his every note with such feeling. My first concert was a total shock, but it was a wonderful night. - Susan (7/23/97) May 19 Texas/El Paso\n\n(Convention Center) May 20 Texas/Midland\n\n(Chaparral Center) Favorite Show: He was here in my town. I had seen him many times before and was always bragging that he is the best live performer around. Finally, all my family and friends got to see why I an such an avid fan of the man. A lot of respect was earned for him, and for me for my good taste. He said he would come back. Midland is an odd town and doesn't always respond to performers, but he won the hearts of all in that large room on that very special night. - Dianne Garrett (Midland, TX) (4/30/99)\n\nI had moved from Austin, a big city, to Sweetwater, which is in the middle of nowhere in West Texas. I thought I would never see Barry again. But just a couple of years later, he came to Midland, which was only about an hour away! That concert is most memorable (out of my personal total of 18 times seeing Barry) as not only does he not mind playing to smaller crowds and venues, but he blew me away doing \"Moonlight Seranade\" and the uptempo \"Could It Be Magic\"! And to top himself he did \"One Voice\" with no music!! - Cindy Bentley (Sweetwater, TX) (5/12/2009)\n\nReady To Take A Chance Again, Daybreak, Somewhere In The Night, Can't Smile Without You, The Old Songs/Memory, Beautiful Music/Somewhere Down The Road, Brooklyn Blues, New York City Rhythm/Jumpin' At The Woodside/Bandstand Boogie, Weekend In New England, I Made It Through The Rain - intermission - Copacabana (At The Copa), Looks Like We Made It, Deja Vu/I'll Never Love This Way Again (with Debra Byrd), Could It Be Magic (uptempo), Big Bands Segment (Singin' With The Big Bands, Moonlight Serenade, Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree, Don't Get Around Much Anymore (Debra Byrd), And The Angels Sing, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, I'll Never Smile Again, Chattanooga Choo Choo, Moonlight Serenade (Reprise)), Mandy/Could It Be Magic, I Write The Songs, It's A Miracle\n\n[ Manilow.TV Episode #13 aired October 2010 ]\n\nMay 22 Louisiana/Baton Rouge\n\n(LSU Assembly Center) This is the first time I had front row seats. The Big Band concert was much more than I ever could have expected. The music and performance was superb and very touching. Barry even threw in a bit of history about World War II. During one song I grabbed my husband and danced with him for a few seconds in front of the whole theatre while Barry sang and had dancers on stage, and on his last song, \"It's a Miracle,\" Barry motioned to me to come to the edge of the stage and grabbed my hand and danced with me for a few seconds. What a great concert! I had a lot of fun that night. - Judy McCloskey (New Orleans, LA) (1/29/2003)\n\nFirst Show - Carolyn Chehardy (New Orleans, LA) (6/27/2004)\n\nMay 23 Louisiana/Lafayette During the song \"Mandy\" my (then) boyfriend turned to me and asked me to marry him. It was a really great ending to a very wonderful night. - Carrie Lasseigne (New Iberia, LA) (7/6/2000)\n\nThis was the one and only time I've seen Barry Manilow in concert. My friend and I were in college and we were so excited that he had come to a venue close enough for us to go to! We had seats towards the back, but as we were walking around, a staff member gave us tickets down front! We were so thrilled! Barry Manilow spoiled me for any other concert. He is such an awesome entertainer in addition to having a magnificent voice. I hope to see him again soon. I'm raising a new generation of little \"Fanilows\"! - Kelli Royer (Lake Charles, Louisiana) (4/13/2012)\n\nMay 24 Texas/San Antonio\n\n(Maybee Center) May 26 Texas/Houston\n\n(The Woodlands) This was the first Barry concert I attended WITH my husband. He's not a huge fan, but he enjoyed the show almost as much as I did! - Kelly Martin (Houston, TX) (3/10/2003)\n\nBarry, of course, was great! Seats amazing, 2nd row center pit. I went with two friends, one not a Fanilow. Left her in the seat while I walked to check out programs. After the show I went with a large group to the bar at the hotel and my non-Fanilow friend said she has a story about the show. While I was away from the seats someone sat on the other side of her and asked if she was in the fan club (keep in mind she was very uncomfortable being in the great seats not being a big fan), so she said \"no, I'm not\" and turned away to discourage further conversation. The seat mate continued \"then, how did you get these seats?\" My friend quickly responded \"Because I'm Barry's sister.\" She said \"I shut her up and she didn't talk to me anymore.\" So she's telling me this at the bar and I start laughing pretty hard and she couldn't understand why I was cracking up. So I replied, \"Barry DOESN'T HAVE a sister, no wonder she quit talking to you!\" - Cheryl Riecke (New Orleans, Louisiana) (11/10/2015)\n\nMay 31 California/\n\nThousand Oaks\n\n(Civic Arts Plaza) Favorite Show (June 2): I was always teased at a young age for liking Barry Manilow (I'm 26 now). When I met my best friend in High School, we knew it was fate. She was also a very big fan (She's 24). We attended the show in Thousand Oaks and I swear we were the youngest in the crowd. We had the best time of our lives. I think people thought we were nuts which made it even more fun. We sat 7th row. Nothing in my life will ever top this! - Stephanie Lever (6/12/98)\n\nHighlights (June 2): Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs / Memory / Beautiful Music / If Tomorrow Never Comes / Brooklyn Blues / New York City Rhythm / Avenue C /Jumpin' At The Woodside/Bandstand Boogie / Weekend In New England / I Made It Through The Rain / Some Kind Of Friend / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment (Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree/Don't Get Around Much Anymore/And The Angels Sing/I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time/I'll Never Smile Again/Chattanooga Choo Choo/Moonlight Serenade (Reprise)) / Could It Be Magic / Mandy/Could It Be Magic / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle / One Voice\n\nJune 1 California/\n\nThousand Oaks\n\n(Civic Arts Plaza) June 2 California/\n\nThousand Oaks\n\n(Civic Arts Plaza) June 8 Mexico/Mexico City\n\n(Auditorio Nacional) \"From Manilow To Mexico\"\n\nFirst Show (June 8) - Odetta Guerrero (of Mexico City) (1/14/99)\n\nFirst Show (June 8): First concert ever, after a long life as a fan, I really loved it. This concert was part of the Greatest Hits tour. Quite a performance. I went with my sister and it was an amazing night. Barry sounded terrific and was in a great mood. He sounded at his best and he looked great. I think he was everything I ever expected ...and more! The most remembered part? Barry spoke Spanish very well!! He read some notes he kept on the piano and got help from there... Everything was perfect: the lights, the sound, and of course, the music. I am sure that the most special song for most was \"Brooklyn Blues\". We kept flashing lighters as he got through \"I've sung love songs to a princess...\" Even he loved it! Then a huge standing ovation for \"Even Now\". My favorite moment was when he sang \"I Made It Through The Rain\" and of course, the whole swing number. He said exactly what I felt, \"How can I tell you what's in my heart...?\" Dearest Barry, thanks for the memory. - Sandra Caballero (Mexico City, Mexico) (5/10/99, 6/22/2010)\n\nFirst and Favorite Show - Eugenia Peralta (Mexico City, Mexico) (7/11/99)\n\nFirst Show: I like all the Barry Manilow concerts! - Aurora (of Mexico) (4/6/2001)\n\nFirst Show (June 8): I was at all the concerts in Mexico City and they were wonderful. Please, Barry, come to Mexico [again] as soon as possible!! - Carmen Garcia (Mexico City, Mexico) (9/8/2002)\n\nFirst Show (Auditorio Nacional): [What I liked about this show was] Everything! I hope I can see Barry again!! - Lourdes Arce (of Mexico) (10/15/2002)\n\nFirst Show - Sergio Barrera (Mexico City, Mexico) (3/21/2003)\n\nFirst/Favorite Show - Monica (of Mexico City, Mexico) (8/3/2004)\n\nFirst/Favorite Show: I think Barry is the BEST! And all his shows are great. Thank you! - Susana Haro (of Mexico City) (4/10/2006)\n\nBarry gave us the honor by coming to Mexico and performing here in this wonderful City that LOVES Barry Manilow. - Miriam Rosenberg (Mexico, City, Mexico) (2/27/2008)\n\nFavorite Show: [What I liked about this show was] EVERYTHING! Barry is just AMAZING!! - MariLuz Perez de Leon (Mexico City, Mexico) (9/5/2010)\n\nHighlights (June 8): Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs / This One's For You / Memory / Somewhere Down The Road / Brooklyn Blues / New York City Rhythm / Avenue C / Jumpin At The Woodside / Bandstand Boogie / Weekend In New England / I Made It Through The Rain / Copacabana (At The Copa) / Even Now / Deja Vu/I'll Never Love This Way Again (with Debra Byrd) / Hey Mambo / Moonlight Serenade / Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree / Chattannooga Choo Choo / Could It Be Magic / Mandy / Could It Be Magic (reprise) / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle / One Voice (a cappella)\n\n[ Manilow TV Episode #103 (June 8, 1995) aired July 2018 ]\n\nJune 9 Mexico/Mexico City\n\n(Auditorio Nacional) June 11 Mexico/Monterrey\n\n(Teatro Fundidora) June 13 Mexico/Mexico City\n\n(Auditorio Nacional) \"From Manilow To Mexico\" August 1 Massachusetts/Boston\n\n(Harborlights) August 1: [My daughter] accompanied [my husband and me] to Barry's concert when we moved to New England. It was magnificent to turn around and see the lights of the city of Boston and hear Barry's wonderful voice filling the air. It was a magical evening. - Elena Abbene (Bedford, NH) (12/1/2001)\n\nFirst/Favorite Show: I sat in the first row, center stage. When Barry Manilow came out he started to sing \"Could It Be Magic.\" I was lost in his eyes as he was singing. I will never forget that special moment. [It was] like he was singing that song to me. I felt him looking right at me! What a great feeling that was!! - Mary Franklin (Boston, MA) (11/26/2002, 4/1/2003)\n\nAugust 2 Massachusetts/Boston\n\n(Harborlights) August 4 Pennsylvania/Pittsburgh\n\n(I.C. Light Amphitheatre) First Show - Diane G. Curfman (1/19/98)\n\nFavorite Show: Front row, right seats! At the end of the concert I was standing at the corner of the stage with a sign. Barry smiled, waved and spoke to me!! Well, he really mouthed a comment to me but in my mind he spoke to me. I'm so glad my friends were standing behind me to verify this was happening! - Suzanne McHenry (Pittsburgh, PA) (12/4/98)\n\nFavorite Show: I was only six rows from stage - got the feeling that his eyes focused on my sister and me while he was singing. When it came to \"Can't Smile\", I tried to get closer, but then a girl came pushing through to sing with him. When that happened, Barry looked down and said, \"Sorry...\". - Cheryl Duttine (Pittsburgh, PA) (8/8/99)\n\nFirst Show - Donna Radmanich (Glenshaw, PA) (1/26/2002)\n\nFirst Show - Jo-Ann Gajewski (Baltimore, Maryland) (8/9/2013)\n\nHightlights: Somewhere In The Night / New York City Rhythm / Avenue C / Weekend In New England / I Made It Through The Rain / Some Kind Of Friend / Could It Be Magic (dance version)\n\nAugust 5 Ohio/Cuyahoga Falls\n\n(Blossom Music Center) Seeing Barry in concert at all is an experience in itself, but lying on the grass under a sky full of stars makes it really great. He's such a great performer!! - Christy Hughes (Streetsboro, OH) (8/26/98)\n\nThis concert was a 4-day belated birthday gift from my late husband. - Laura Scott (Las Vegas, NV [originally from Ohio]) (1/1/2009)\n\nHighlights: Somewhere In The Night / The Best Of Me / Wild Places / New York City Rhythm / Weekend In New England / Looks Like We Made It / Some Kind Of Friend / Could It Be Magic (dance version) / One Voice\n\nAugust 6 Virginia/Vienna\n\n(Wolftrap) First Show Memory: \"When I got there I spent a fortune on souvenirs, but it was all worth it. Next thing I knew the concert was starting. When he started to sing 'Ready To Take A Chance Again' I was sure I was going to pass out. I was amazed - he was Right There! During 'Could It Be Magic' I got so excited I ripped the seat up out of the concrete! When I realized what I had done I quickly sat down (I didn't want to pay for it).\" - Sarah Ingles\n\nBest Show Memory: It was the closest I ever sat (4th row) in front of the piano. I could swear when Barry sang \"One Voice\", it was just me and him. Still get goose bumps! - Barbara Joe Parker (7/11/97)\n\nFirst Show - Beth (of San Francisco, CA) (3/29/99)\n\nI'd been to many concerts before and always dreamed of being picked to go on stage with Barry to sing \"Can't Smile Without You.\" At this concert, I was seated quite far in the back. The worst seat I'd ever had for a concert. To my amazement when it came for that part of the show, I started jumping up and down, waving my hands in the air and Barry said, \"You back there in the pink outfit.\" My friend said, \"It's you, it's you.\" I ran down to the stage and was so out of breath when I got there. But that didn't stop my from jumping into Barry's arms and wrapping my legs around his waist (To this day, I wonder if that was the start of his hip problems!). Needless to say it was the concert I'll never forget. Holding Barry's hand, having a little dance across the stage and watching him hop up on the piano and pulling me over in front of him. This time he wrapped his legs around me. I sang pretty well through the whole song until the last note. I'm sure dogs were howling all over the county! Thanks, Barry, for giving me such a special memory and thanks for the video. It's been viewed by hundreds of people. I'll remember that night in 1995 forever. - Linda Boyle (Columbia, Maryland) (3/23/2012)\n\nFirst Show - Jennifer Ann Holt (Gaithersburg, Maryland) (6/17/2013)\n\nAugust 8 Ontario/Toronto\n\n(Molson Amphitheatre) Favorite Show: Had 3rd row seats. Barry made eye contact with me. - Marcy Binsky (4/19/98)\n\nI was all by myself, but determined to see Barry perform. I was not disappointed! The show was fabulous! I had been down and depressed (had recently lost my job) and I came out of the concert feeling [great]. Barry is a great showman. The crowd was terrific. He also attracts nice people. Fun evening. Enjoyed every minute of it. - M. Young (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (8/27/2000)\n\nAugust 9 New York/Rochester This concert was exciting because my son was in the back-up chorus on stage. Seeing my two favorite singers on stage together was something I will never forget. This was my 4th concert and I hope to see many more. Barry's music knows how to hit the soul, and in person it is electrifying. - L. Colburn (Monticello, IN) (8/6/2000) August 10 New Jersey/Camden\n\n(Blockbuster) I hate to say that I have a \"favorite show\" because ALL of them tend to be a favorite. But THIS show passes my lips as favorite when I talk about it to friends... Our local fan club decorated Barry's dressing room and it was just so very special to be part of it. We made a \"special\" request for him to sing \"Wild Places\" by placing signs in his bathroom. Like \"Take us to Wild Places\" and \"please\" placed very strategically by the toilet. To top all of this off, we had front row center PIT seats. He sang ALL the songs we wanted to hear (\"Keep Each Other Warm\", \"The Best Of Me\", etc.). At first we didn't think he was going to do \"Wild Places\", then he surprised us. It was an exhilirating moment - especially since he walked by us and shaked his finger at us (we had the same signs we used in his bathroom) and mentioned he had a \"special\" request for that song that evening. It was one fun night I'll never forget, and being in the presence of my friends made it even more so special! - Christina Cotsifas (10/17/98) August 12 Michigan/Rochester\n\n(Meadowbrook Theatre) First Show - Marilynn Dowdy (of Michigan) (6/7/2021) August 13 Ohio/Kettering\n\n(Fraze Pavilion) Favorite Show: My friend and I were sitting on the lawn, DEPRESSED, because we were SOOOO far from the stage. Then the unbelievable happened...We got the SINATRA SEATS!! When we went down to the center front row, I almost pee'd my pants. The entire concert was like a dream and I will never forget it!! - Wendy Heinzman-Johnson (Grove City, OH) (8/27/99)\n\nI ran down the aisle to take some pictures of Barry sitting on a stool on stage singing. I had to get up the nerve to do that, and with my girlfriend from work egg'ing me on I did it! I got some really good pictures to cherish all these years! - Karen Dahlinghaus (Kettering, Ohio) (4/20/2012)\n\nAugust 14 Wisconsin/Milwaukee\n\n(Marcus Amphitheatre) August 16 Utah/Salt Lake City\n\n(Symphony Hall) This concert would have to be my all-time favorite as I was able to actually be on stage as Barry gave his usual musically brilliant performance. The University of Utah Acappella choir, of which I was a member at the time, was asked to participate in a small portion of the concert. To be a part of this wonderful musical experience will forever be one of the highlights of my life. The Big Band album is definitely one of my favorites, and it was my privilege to be involved in the concert, and to rehearse with someone I respect so much as a musician and artist. - Andrea Richardson (Salt Lake City, UT) (8/19/98)\n\nMy favorite concert, Barry, is when you did the Big Band tour and came to Salt Lake City at the Delta Center. I went, as always, with my best friend (Pam Smith), her mother and her grandmother. We loved the music, but her grandmother was so moved. She had lived through those times. I also loved when you sang the song for Elizabeth Smart. Your music has carried me through so many good times, as well as some not so good times. - Patty (of Salt Lake City, UT) (1/28/2011)\n\nBarry is an amazing performer. I love his music. It has always been music I can relate to. It's the kind of music you never get tired of hearing. I LOVE BARRY MANILOW! - Ann Kahananui (Independence, Missouri) (3/30/2011)\n\nBarry's music touches me in such a way I can't describe. I feel like he's singing to me only, instead of an audience of many. I get emotional when a certain song he sings. Gives me goosebumps! I love his music and always will! - Deana Blake (Santee, California) (4/6/2011)\n\nAugust 18 Nevada/Lake Tahoe\n\n(Caesar's) August 20: Best concert Barry has ever given. The big band, the singers, the stage set and Barry made a night to remember. I still get goosebumps just thinking about it! Thanks for the wonderful memories Barry! - Laura Youngblood (of California) (11/20/98)\n\nFavorite Show (August 18): Everything about the concert was wonderful. It was the Big Band theme. The music, the performers, and the settings for each scene were fantastic! I especially loved the scene with the performers in their military uniforms. This was my second concert and the closest I have been to the stage. I have been an fan since the early 70's. Thanks for a great concert, Barry. - Alyce Cloutier (Carson City, NV) (9/5/99)\n\nFirst Show: My husband, two daughters and I attended the show and loved everything about it. - Shirl (of California) (10/26/2000)\n\nFavorite Show: Please come back to Lake Tahoe! - Karen Gonzales (Fresno, CA) (5/19/2002)\n\nAugust 20: It was a more intimate setting. Barry was in a wonderful mood and it showed. I would love to see that show again (on Manilow.TV)! - Stephanie P. Cohen (Fernley, Nevada) (5/30/2011)\n\nHighlights (August 19): Looks Like We Made It / Moonlight Serenade / Could It Be Magic (dance version)\n\nAugust 19-E Nevada/Lake Tahoe\n\n(Caesar's) August 19-L Nevada/Lake Tahoe\n\n(Caesar's) August 20 Nevada/Lake Tahoe\n\n(Caesar's) August 22 California/San Diego\n\n(Summer Pops Bowl)\n\nHighlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again (Intro) / It's A Miracle / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs / Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again / The Best Of Me / Brooklyn Blues / New York City Rhythm / Avenue C / Jumpin' At The Woodside / Bandstand Boogie / Weekend In New England / Keep Each Other Warm / Medley (Deja Vu/I'll Never Love This Way Again featuring Debra Byrd)) / Copacabana (At The Copa) / Moonlight Serenade / Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree / Chattanooga Choo Choo / Could It Be Magic (Uptempo) + Encore / Mandy / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise) / One Voice\n\nAugust 24 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) Favorite Show (August 24): I was seated in the front row and got to shake his hand! It was my first time seeing him so close up. What a thrill! I'll NEVER FORGET IT!! - Mildred Blackwell (Spring Hill, FL) (2/17/99, 3/7/99)\n\nFirst/Favorite Show (August 24): I came to this concert because my wife has been an ardent fan of Barry's forever and this was the night that I became a fan of Barry's also. Our seats were in the front row, and he shook both of our hands - which made me respect him so much. His music and his personality were unbelievable! I have been a big fan of his ever since, and now I see what my wife has seen for all of these years. This common bond has brought us together so much closer. - Edwin Blackwell (Spring Hill, FL) (3/7/99)\n\nAugust 24: My first Vegas show. What a town, what a hotel, what a guy! Loved the multi-colored \"Manilow\" curtain. I had a feeling I'd come back here LOTS of times!! - Passy Schuld (Antwerp, Belgium) (9/12/2003)\n\nFavorite show was when he sang \"I'll Be Here With You\" (\"good night, don't be afraid...\"). Wish someday he would put it on a CD or DVD! - Felicia Marks (Houston, TX) (8/31/2009)\n\nI SANG WITH BARRY ON MY HONEYMOON! I had been trying for 20 years to meet Barry and it finally happened! It was a DREAM come true! It was a moment that I will NEVER forget and I am so grateful to be able to share this moment with all my music students to inspire them to follow their dreams. It was AWESOME!! ... and The KISS!! - Jennifer Johns English (Lansing, MI) (12/24/2009, 8/21/2010, 8/6/2013)\n\nAugust 24 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again (Reprise) / It's A Miracle (from Boston to Vegas) / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You (with bride Jennifer) / The Best Of Me (this one's for Jennifer & Jim) / The Old Songs/Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again / Wild Places / City Rhythm Medley (New York City Rhythm/Avenue C/Jumpin' At The Woodside/Bandstand Boogie) / Weekend In New England / Copacabana (At The Copa) / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment (Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree, Don't Get Around Much Anymore (Debra Byrd), And The Angels Sing, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, I'll Never Smile Again, Chattanooga Choo Choo, Moonlight Serenade (Reprise)) / Could It Be Magic (Uptempo) + Encore / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nAugust 25 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / Why Don't We Live Together / I Am Your Child / Ships / Fools Get Lucky / Wild Places / City Rhythm Medley / Weekend In New England / Copacabana / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment / Could It Be Magic (Uptempo) / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nAugust 26 Highlights: It's A Miracle (instrumental) / I Wanna Do It With You / Let's Hang On / I Don't Want To Walk Without You / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs/Even Now / Just Remember / The Best Of Me / Wild Places / City Rhythm Medley / Weekend In New England / Copacabana / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment / Could It Be Magic (Uptempo) / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise) / I'll Be Here With You\n\nAugust 27 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again (Reprise) / It's A Miracle (from Boston to Vegas) / Daybreak / Stay / Can't Smile Without You / Looks Like We Made It / Keep Each Other Warm / Brooklyn Blues / City Rhythm Medley / Bermuda Triangle / Weekend In New England / Copacabana / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment / Could It Be Magic (Uptempo) / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nAugust 28 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs/Memory / Just Remember / When October Goes / Brooklyn Blues / City Rhythm Medley / Weekend In New England / Copacabana / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment / Could It Be Magic (Uptempo) / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nAugust 29 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / Why Don't We Live Together / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs/Even Now / Wild Places / City Rhythm Medley / Weekend In New England / Moonlight Serenade / Big Bands Segment / Could It Be Magic (Uptempo) + encore / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nAugust 25 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) August 26 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) August 27 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) August 28 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) August 29 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) September 4 Arkansas/Little Rock I got to hear songs live that I never thought I would! Thanks so much, Barry. You are the bomb! - Viki Protheroe (Russellville, AR) (10/26/99) October 10 Illinois/Peoria\n\n(Civic Center Arena) Favorite Show: My husband and I celebrated our 9th anniversary that night we spent with Barry. With him we always fall in love with each other over and over and over. The one thing that really makes Barry's concerts [better than] all the others that I have seen is his true appreciation for his fans, whether you are once-in-awhile concert-goers or the lucky ones who can follow him night after night. Barry is a truly blessed gentleman and my husband and I only wish him the best. Hopefully when he returns to our area we will have the money and a babysitter to go and fall in love again and again and again! - Georgia (of Illinois) (4/19/99)\n\nThis was my fourth time for the Greatest Hits Tour and each one was different. Barry was just fantastic (as always) and I loved the way he presented the Big Band songs. Debra Byrd did some great things too. But the highlight for me was when Barry came back on stage, all alone, and sang \"One Voice\" a capella. My heart stopped! - Norma Swenson (Little York, IL) (7/16/99)\n\nIt was my first and only time ever seeing Barry in person. I almost fainted! My favorite moment of the whole concert was when he sang \"One Voice.\" It was so beautiful, I bawled my eyes out. He has the most wonderful voice God ever created and I hope I get to see him again someday. - Dawn Marx (Peoria, IL) (3/23/2003)\n\nOctober 12 Illinois/Chicago\n\n(Rosemont) First Show (October 13): The concert was UNBELIEVABLE!! Favorite Show: I had a chance to see him in concert with my mother, my sister and my aunt! The best part of his concert was when he pulled someone from the audience to sing with him on stage (\"Can't Smile Without You\"). I thought my sister was going to die. How she would have loved to be up on the stage with him singing because that is her favorite song! My sister and I have been fans for a long time (since my childhood). My mother played his records while we cleaned the house - sounds like fun doesn't it? - Jennifer Kalinka (Palos Hills, IL) (11/15/98, 11/18/98, 8/12/99)\n\nI am 36 and have been a supporter of Barry for over 20 years. I needed a major surgery at the age of 13 and through his music I am happy to say it all went well. My dream in life is to meet with him someday and be able to sing with him. I am a musician/singer as well and have been doing this for 14 years for a living. The way Barry treats his audience is a feeling I will never forget. He is truly one of a kind! - Kevin Kamin (Kenosha, WI) (2/4/2000)\n\nFavorite Show (October 12): My sisters bought me the ticket for my 25th birthday. This is a birthday I will never forget. Because of Barry Manilow, I met my best friend in college. Everytime I hear his music I feel close to her. She lives in Pennsylvania and I live in Illinois. Some day I hope for the two of us to go to one of his concerts together. - Paulette Petracco (Westchester, IL) (4/1/2000)\n\nFavorite Show (October 13): It was the best concert I have ever been too. The energy in the theatre that night was electric. Everyone was dancing in the aisles. I have never again felt that much energy in one space or had such a great evening. Words cannot explain how great this one show could be! - Anita Sanders (Chicago, IL) (6/16/2000)\n\nFirst Show (October 15) - Mary Catherine Berent (Chicago, IL) (7/12/2002)\n\nFirst Show - Leah Fallico (Chicago, IL) (6/17/2007)\n\nFirst Show (October 14): Barry, there is a phrase in Italian that translates as \"being struck by lightning.\" Yes, that is how seeing you in concert for the first time affected me! Little did I realize at the time that I had actually been \"Manilowed!\" You left my musical appetite wanting more than just that show, and before I knew it I was booked to Las Vegas to see you again! I sat mesmerized by you and your Beautiful Music, and your kindness to your audiences and fans. - Lynda Garbutt (Chicago, IL) (5/12/2009)\n\nFirst Show - Peggy Wilson (Chicago, IL) (6/11/2010)\n\nOctober 13: It was my night to sing \"Cant Smile Without You\" with Barry. Such a story to tell! Since Barry was the first performer at this venue, I had never been there before. After picking up my best \"fanilow\" friend I got lost on the way there! Somehow we got to the parking lot, ran in, down the aisle to the fifth row just in time for Barry to turn my way and say \"YOU!\" I had just put down my camera and purse and picked up my sign! I scurried to the first row, as there were no stairs that night, and saw an empty seat which I climbed up on to get to the stage where Barry was reaching out his hand for me. He said \"My kind of woman...on her knees!\" The whole thing happened so fast! My throat was so dry, but the notes came out any way! It was magical! And at the end of the song after I was back to my seat we waved to each other and he said, \"Alyson, I love you!\" How special he made me feel! It was a night I will never forget! And I feel like it was last week, not 15 years ago! Thank you so much, Barry for all the years! - Alyson Sterzinger (Lake in the Hills, Illinois) (11/30/2011)\n\nOctober 12: Saw Barry at the premiere opening of the Rosemont Theatre! - Timothy Adornetto (Chicago, Illinois) (4/18/2012)\n\nOctober 13 Illinois/Chicago\n\n(Rosemont) October 14 Illinois/Chicago\n\n(Rosemont) October 15 Illinois/Chicago\n\n(Rosemont) October 17 New York/Elmira\n\n(Clemens Center) Thanks Susan for the update! - 8/5/99\n\nOctober 18 (Poughkeepsie): Barry performed in an auditorium-type venue! I had taken my mom who was in a wheelchair at the time recovering from a heart surgery. I don't know who was more excited to see him... her or me!? We had front row handicapped seats and the whole show was beautiful, cozy and warm. [Debra Byrd] sang alone and with Barry. It was just beautiful. [Seeing] Barry in this smaller environment was wonderful. Words cannot describe the feeling my mom and I both had for days after the show. Barry is a blessing in our lives! - Judy Scioli (New Milford, NJ) (4/20/2010)\n\nOctober 18 New York/Poughkeepsie\n\n(Hudson Civic Center) October 19 Pennsylvania/Bethlehem\n\n(Stabler Arena) (Thanks Christina for the update! - 10/17/98) October 21 Massachusetts/Amherst\n\n(Mullins Center) (Thanks for the info, Pat! - 3/23/98)\n\nFirst/Favorite Show: The Barry Manilow concert was a very powerful, emotional experience for me. My one true wish was to see him in person. All I ask is that he come and do it again SOON!! I would LOVE to see him again (with better seats!). - Katie (of Massachusetts) (11/16/98)\n\nI have been a Manilow fan for most of his career, and as I sat there in the audience, I realized that his music has been a part of every phase of my life. From when I first fell in love to all these years later... Barry's music is with me deep in my soul. Thank You, Barry, for sharing your talents. My life has been enriched by your music and by your joy and love of music. - Ann Marie (DeCasse) Richard (Springfield, MA) (2/19/2000)\n\nI was lucky enough to get front row center tickets (just by calling TicketMaster, no less!). I was jazzed! No matter how incredible you think Barry is, he is so much MORE AMAZING from the front row! At the end of the concert, we got right up against the stage. I put my hand out to touch him, but he went to the right and the left of the stage before finally coming to the front ... My sister was screaming \"Touch Missy!\" at the top of her lungs, and finally, FINALLY he reached out and took my hand. I thought I would die! It was amazing - all I could do was stand there and cry. When the show ended, all I could say for 45 minutes was \"I touched HIM!\" I am 26 and have been listening to Barry, literally, all of my life. This was a dream come true. I am still shocked and amazed that I was able to be that close! - Melissa (of Brockton, MA) (6/5/2000)\n\nI had butterflies seeing Barry. It was such a great experience. I sat in the first row and WOW! When Barry came out on stage, it sure was an out-of-body experience for me. I will never forget that night! - Mary Franklin (Boston, MA) (7/14/2009)\n\nOctober 22 Connecticut/New Haven (Palace Theater) Favorite Show - Charles Cromwell (3/31/98)\n\nFirst and Favorite Show - Shannon (of West Haven, CT) (7/15/99)\n\nFavorite Show: This was a very small venue. Old-time theater. Barry was very \"up\" that night. There seemed to be many fans there also. I felt like we were sitting around the table just talking. Someone would say something and he would answer. The show itself was no different than what I had been seeing. It was just the feeling in the room that night, enough to make someone think about this show for a long time after. - Donna Kelly (Peekskill, NY) (7/20/99)\n\nFavorite Show: Barry always puts 110% of himself into all of his shows, so it's hard to pick just one. The concert in New Haven was fantastic. There was so much emotion and feeling in that show. I loved the segment on the Big Bands. \"Could It Be Magic\" was the best that I ever saw him perform. Barry had everyone on their feet. New Haven will always stand out in my mind as one of the best. - Joanne Magnani (Vernon, CT) (9/29/99)\n\nOctober 24 Pennsylvania/Wilkes-Barre (Kirby Center) First Show (October 24) - My two older sons surprised me and bought me tickets to see Barry! - Deb Bobyak (3/11/98)\n\nWonderful show! We had great seats. The only thing that would have been better is if I had been picked to sing with Barry. My husband is a convert. He thinks Barry's shows are very well-produced. He doesn't mind coming to the shows with me. We must have been to about 10 shows so far. - Donna (of Pennsylvania) (9/28/2000)\n\nOctober 25 Pennsylvania/Wilkes-Barre (Kirby Center) November Georgia/Atlanta (Lakewood Amphitheatre) Favorite Show: I had been a fan for many, many years. I had been very sick over the years and Barry's music would help me through the pain. It still does. I was so excited about his coming and my getting to see him in person for the first time. My husband went with me, not by choice. When Barry stepped out I burst into tears, and so did my husband (he had never seen me so happy). He has listened to his music since, and he now understands why when I am in extreme pain, I put on my headphones and let Barry take me away. - Lori King (3/13/98) November Alabama/Mobile I was hooked on Barry after seeing him in Pensacola (in December 1993). He is a true entertainer. What really makes me believe this is when I attended the concert in Mobile, Alabama, during his Big Band Tour and the gentleman beside me was crying during one of the songs! He was a war vet! - Lisa Guerra (Fort Walton Beach, FL) (9/26/98)\n\nFavorite Show: We were so close to the stage!! The concert seemed so personal and was a great combination of new and old! - Alta Wood (Pascagoula, MS) (1/16/2000)\n\nWhat I liked best about the concert: Mr. Manilow took the time to meet me prior to the show. At the time I was a Blue Angel and presented him a Lithograph of the Blues with his name on it. That was without question, the best day of my life. His assistant told me that he rarely does that, which really made me feel great. Just to shake his hand was enough to last a lifetime.\n\nI have been listening to his music for over 20 years and many of his songs and the power in his voice contribute not only to my success in the Navy, but his voice and music are a way of life for me. I am a Chief and made it pretty fast. Throughout my Naval career (almost 12 years) his music has brightened my every day through three deployments to the Western Pacific Oceans and Mediterranean Sea which included Operation Desert Shield/Storm and Persian Gulf/Red Sea Operations. I worked in the Pentagon and of course the World Famous Blue Angels. I am currently stationed in San Diego onboard the Guided Missile Cruiser - USS COWPENS and am enroute to work for an Admiral in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nI am telling you all of this because I want you to know how much pride I have for our country and that Barry's voice gives me a sense of control and stability contributing to my successes so far, and that I will always know, I am not just one to get an autograph and say I met him. The best part is that I know and again, without question, that he will not forget getting that picture from me. That is all that really matters to me. - Chris Adams (Elkader, IA) (10/28/99)\n\nNovember 11 Tennessee/Memphis\n\n(Orpheum Theatre) November 14 Florida/Tampa Bay\n\n(Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center) Brian & Dawn Kuttig's first Barry Manilow concert!\n\nFirst Show - Jessica Whitlock (Sarasota, FL) (8/4/98)\n\nNovember 15 Florida/Tampa Bay\n\n(Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center) November 18 Florida/Orlando\n\n(Bob Carr Performing Arts Center) First/Favorite Show - Michael (of Philadelphia, PA) (6/18/2005) November 19 Florida/Orlando (Bob Carr Performing Arts Center) November 24 Florida/Ft. Lauderdale (Sunrise Musical Theatre) Best Show: The show from the Big Bands had the best storyline of all his concerts. It touched the heart and let folks know the meaning behind some of the older songs. Before that concert, I had no idea of the background of those songs. I'm 39 and the older people in my life never talk about that time. Now I have the insight and I enjoy those songs even more. - Terry Zugajewicz (12/24/97)\n\nFirst Show - Judy Fabiano (Vero Beach, Florida) (12/17/2019)\n\nHighlights (11/25/1995): Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / I'll Be Good For You / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs / Mandy / Memory / If Tomorrow Never Comes / Brooklyn Blues / Cloudburst / Avenue C / Jumpin' At The Woodside / William Tell Overture / Weekend In New England / I Made It Through The Rain / Copacabana (At The Copa) / Looks Like We Made It / New York City Rhythm / Moonlight Serenade / Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree / And The Angels Sing / I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time / I'll Never Smile Again / Chattanooga Choo Choo / Moonlight Serenade (reprise) / Could It Be Magic (dance version) (+ encore) / Forever And A Day / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (reprise)\n\n[ Manilow TV Episode #156 aired May 2023 ]\n\nNovember 25 November 30 Nevada/Las Vegas\n\n(The Mirage) Dec 2/3: The Mirage Hotel was a beautiful and intimate setting. Barry sang songs, both old and new. He was so accessible! I traveled to Las Vegas just to see him. My only regret is that I only attended two shows! His music has been a great comfort over the years. I just wish he toured all the time but realize he must have a life! Go Barry! - Valerie Kilian (Burnsville, MN) (12/17/98)\n\nNovember 30: I sang with Barry on opening night in Las Vegas. It was a magical Manilow moment to sing with someone I respect so much! I still watch the video he gave me all these years later and get chills every time! Thank you, Barry for making a dream come true! You are awesome! - Sharon King (West Chester, Pennsylvania) (8/1/2007, 6/4/2012)\n\nNovember 30 Highlights: This One's For You/Where Or When/This One's For You (Reprise) / Daybreak / Somewhere In The Night / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs / Mandy / Memory / Brooklyn Blues / Cloudburst / Avenue C / Jumpin' At The Woodside / William Tell Overture / Weekend In New England / Do You Wanna Dance (Jason Bowen - uptempo) / Do You Wanna Dance (ballad - Debra Byrd) / Copacabana / Moonlight Serenade / Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree / Don't Get Around Much Anymore / And The Angels Sing / I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time / I'll Never Smile Again / Chattanooga Choo Choo / Moonlight Serenade (reprise) / Could It Be Magic (uptempo) / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nDecember 1 Highlights: I'll Be Good For You / Looks Like We Made It / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs/Mandy/Memory / If Tomorrow Never Comes / Wild Places / New York City Rhythm / Avenue C/Jumpin' At The Woodside/William Tell Overture / I Made It Through The Rain / Blue/I'll Never Love This Way Again / Do You Wanna Dance (uptempo, then slow) / Copacabana / [audience request] The Best Of Me / Could It Be Magic (uptempo) + encore / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nDecember 2 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / Why Don't We Live Together / Can't Smile Without You / Suicide Medley: I've Never Been So Low On Love/Mandy/Even Now / Brooklyn Blues / Medley: Cloudburst/Avenue C/Jumpin' At The Woodside/William Tell Overture (with Jason, Gina, Debra) / Weekend In New England / Blue/I'll Never Love This Way Again/Do You Wanna Dance (uptempo w/Jason)/Do You Wanna Dance (slow w/Debra) / Copacabana (At The Copa) / Moonlight Serenade / Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree / Chattanooga Choo Choo / Could It Be Magic (Dance Version) + encore / FOREVER AND A DAY / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nDecember 3 Highlights: Ready To Take A Chance Again / Daybreak / I'll Be Good For You / Looks Like We Made It / Can't Smile Without You (with 'Oh, Julie') / The Old Songs/Mandy/Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again / Brooklyn Blues / Medley: Cloudburst/Avenue C/Jumpin' At The Woodside/William Tell Overture / Keep Each Other Warm / Blue/I'll Never Love This Way Again/Do You Wanna Dance (uptempo w/Jason)/Do You Wanna Dance (slow w/Debra) / Copacabana (At The Copa) / I'll Be Here With You / Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree / Chattanooga Choo Choo / Could It Be Magic (Dance Version) + encore / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nDecember 4 Highlights: It's A Miracle (Instrumental) / I Wanna Do It With You/Let's Hang On / Daybreak / I'll Be Good For You / Looks Like We Made It / Can't Smile Without You / The Old Songs/Mandy/Even Now / Wild Places / City Rhythm Medley (New York City Rhythm/Avenue C/Jumpin' At The Woodside/William Tell Overture) / Weekend In New England / Blue/I'll Never Love This Way Again/Do You Wanna Dance (uptempo w/Jason)/Do You Wanna Dance (slow w/Debra) / Copacabana (At The Copa) / If We Only Have Love / Could It Be Magic (Dance Version) + encore / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nDecember 5 Highlights: I'll Be Good For You / Looks Like We Made It / The Old Songs/Mandy/Memory / Brooklyn Blues / Avenue C/Jumpin' At The Woodside/William Tell Overture / Bermuda Triangle / Weekend In New England / Blue/I'll Never Love This Way Again / Do You Wanna Dance (uptempo - Jason, then slow - Debra) / Copacabana / Somewhere Down The Road / Could It Be Magic (dance/uptempo version) + encore / Forever And A Day / I Write The Songs / It's A Miracle (Reprise)\n\nDecember 1 December 2 December 3 December 4"
