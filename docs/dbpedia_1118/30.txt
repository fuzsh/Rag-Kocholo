Suddenly she's just standing there, as if she were the friend next door. In the middle of the store at MÃ¼llerstrasse 57, where Christoph Soltmannowski runs his Studio 57. She is smaller than I imagined her to be. And more delicate. Hello, she says and puts down her big bag. She is a little tired, but that doesn't matter, she says with a smile. Without make-up and as stylish as ever, Stefanie Heinzmann sits down opposite me, the microphones are just set up, the last camera settings are checked and then it starts. Without any shyness, she tells of her beginnings as a naive 18-year-old schoolgirl who signed up for Stefan Raab's casting show. And. Bam, she wins and a storm passes over her that she would never have thought possible.

But what am I writing, take a look and experience this great woman, who after 13 years in showbiz feels pudelwohl in her skin.
