With a growing population, a changing climate, and increased resource constraints, there has never been a greater need to produce more with less.

The California Bountiful Foundation presents a unique opportunity to address those challenges head-on by supporting research studies on climate-smart agriculture, farming technology, forest management, and water and economic security.

“Our goal is to create a program that provides the farmers and ranchers of California with the most recent science and research while influencing policy to benefit the state’s agriculture. We aim to be a one-stop shop for the agricultural community as a place to get science and research done.”
