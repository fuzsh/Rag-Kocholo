California Bound: Opening the West—1840 to 1846

The Saratoga Historical Foundation invites the public to hear Robert Keahey on the topic California Bound: Opening the West — 1840 to 1846. The lecture takes place at the Saratoga Foothill Club at 7:00 PM on June 25. The Saratoga Foothill Club is located at 20399 Park Place in Saratoga. Members are free and nonmembers pay $5.00.

The westward migration to California is the largest in US history, with over w250,000 people making the journey across the Great American Desert between 1840 and 1870.

The Donner Party, the California Gold Rush, and the intercontinental Railroad are indelibly etched in the annals of western history. But before the Donners, the Fort-Niners and the golden Spike there were the Bidwells, Bartlesons, Walkers and Murphys who blazed a 2000 mile trail across the rugged western plains and mountains to California.

Starting with a discussion of the Oregon and Santa Fe Trails, key aspects of the development of the California Trail are examined — the drivers, the elements of a wagon train, and the people who migrated during 1840 to 1846. What was the impact of these early pioneers on the Westward migration?

The Saratoga Historical Foundation is located at 20450 Saratoga-Los Gators Road in Saratoga.
