The Problem

How to Identify

Go down into the crawl space – the area between the first floor and the foundation – to find out if your house is bolted to its foundation.

Look for the heads of anchor bolts that fasten the sill plate – the wooden board that sits directly on top of the foundation – securely to the foundation. (See Drawings A & B below)

You should be able to see the large nuts, washers, and anchor bolts, installed at least every 4 to 6 feet along the sill plate. Steel plates are sometimes used instead of anchor bolts. (See Drawing B below)

Remember

It is very expensive to lift a house, and place it back on its foundation.

Homes moving off their foundations can cause gas lines to rupture, which in turn can result in fires.

Note

If your home has no foundation, or an old concrete foundation, see Other Foundation Issues.

The Solution

How-to Resources

Detailed information for do-it-yourselfers or engineers can be found in the International Existing Building Code, published by the International Code Council.

NOTE: Slab Foundations

Some homes are built directly on concrete slabs. These houses do not have crawl spaces and cripple walls.

Nearly all homes with slab foundations that were originally built to code will have anchor bolts or straps. However, if the house is not bolted to the slab, you have an earthquake weakness.

Newer homes generally have anchor bolts or straps. If you have an unfinished garage, you may be able to see the anchor bolts.

You are not required to remove siding, drywall or plaster to determine if your house has anchor bolts.
