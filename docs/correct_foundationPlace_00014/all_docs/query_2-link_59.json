        "text": "Historically, the areas of present day Los Angeles was home to the Chumash and Tongva Native American tribes. On September 4, 1781 a group of settlers consisting of 14 families numbering 44 individuals of Native American, African and European heritage journeyed more than one-thousand miles across the desert from present-day northern Mexico and established a farming community in the area naming it \"El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula\" which in English translated to \"The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels of Porciúncula\". Over time this community would grow under the flags of Spain, Mexico and eventually the United States to become one of the largest metropolitan cities in the world, the City of Los Angeles.\n\nToday, the original pueblo is commemorated as a Los Angeles Historical Monument. The El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument is a living museum that continues to fulfill its unique role as the historic and symbolic heart of the City, reflecting the Native American, African American, Spanish, Anglo, Mexican, Chinese, Italian and French cultures that contributed to its early history. Of the monument’s twenty-seven historic buildings, eleven are open to the public as businesses or have been restored as museums. Visit http://elpueblo.lacity.org for more information on the area and how to plan a visit."
