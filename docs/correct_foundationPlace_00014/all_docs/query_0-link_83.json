        "text": "The Avalos Foundation hopes to support and inspire the next generation of leaders to help make our state, country, and communities a better place. The Avalos Foundation understands education is the greatest equalizer providing social and economic upward mobility and this is why Avalos Foundation exists. Education with the support of many people changed Arnoldo and Almaâs lives forever and therefore it is our purpose and dream to help as many young people from the Upper Sacramento Valley receive their college degrees and reinvest their time and resources back into this local community in the future.\n\nThe Avalos Foundation launched on December 12th, 2012 and since its inception, it has focused on providing scholarships to low-income high school students from the Upper Sacramento Valley who are attending a University of California and Ivy League universities, or Stanford, Georgetown & University of Southern California. Our geographic area of focus is any student attending high school or community college in Butte, Glenn, Tehama, Yuba, Sutter, and Colusa Counties. To date, Avalos Foundation has sponsored 150 students attending the University of California Berkeley, Los Angeles, Davis, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Irvine, and San Diego as well as Harvard, Columbia, Pennsylvania, USC, and Georgetown. The majority of our students have a family income less than $70k and are of a variety of ethnic backgrounds representing small communities of Chico, Colusa, Yuba City, Marysville, Orland, Biggs, Red Bluff, Corning, Willows, Los Molinos, Gridley, Oroville, Las Plumas, Hamilton City, Arbuckle, Williams, Paradise, and Wheatland!\n\nAvalos Foundation is more than a scholarship program; we provide mentorship, career guidance, and overall a support network as we see our students as family. In fact, our 1st Avalos Foundation Scholar just completed his computer science degree from the University of Davis, and now he has successfully transitioned to a career in the Silicon Valley. We have students who are now working professionals in corporate America, and others who are in medical, pharmacy, post graduate, and law universities."
