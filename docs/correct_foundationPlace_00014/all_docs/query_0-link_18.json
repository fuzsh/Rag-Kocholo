Chang, MPH, Foundation president & CEO\n\nWhat We Do\n\nWell-being for California communities\n\n80% of health outcomes are not tied to health care — which is why we target root causes in our work to promote health equity and end domestic violence. We have carefully honed our strategies to focus on the following three areas:\n\nStrengthen economic security and mobility\n\nBreak the cycle of domestic violence\n\nAlign systems with community priorities"
