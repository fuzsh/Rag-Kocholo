We were founded on the idea that the California Community Colleges change lives by providing access to affordable, quality education and training.\n\nBy making education more affordable and accessible, the California Community Colleges help improve the quality of life for those who face barriers to higher education—including first-generation college students, students in low-income families, rural residents, inner city residents, foster youth, military veterans, and immigrants.\n\nAdditionally, the California Community Colleges are the largest system of higher education in the nation, with 116 colleges and 73 self-governing districts.
