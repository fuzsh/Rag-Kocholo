        "text": "The Hellman Foundation was established in 2011 and is rooted in the legacy of Warren and Chris Hellman, who modeled an approach to philanthropy based on curiosity, respect, and partnership with local communities. The foundation is committed to building equity and opportunity in the San Francisco Bay Area by investing in community-led initiatives through cross-sector collaboration. To date, the Foundation has awarded nearly $200 million in grants.\n\nWe are committed to supporting positive change and see the pressing needs that exist now. These needs are the reason we’re changing our funding approach. We have decided to accelerate our giving in the near term, spend all funding and close the foundation’s doors by the end of 2034.\n\nThis approach will meet urgent community needs, lay the groundwork for systemic change and make it possible for communities in the Bay Area to live fuller lives with access to an abundance of opportunities. Although the Hellman Foundation will close by 2034, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass will continue. Please see the FAQ about our spend-down decision."
