Rest easy. Expert emergency care is close by. Select your arrival time and wait from the comfort of your home.\n\nProject Impact: New Patient Tower Opening 2024\n\nCalifornia Hospital is building a new patient tower and investing in the future of healthcare in our community. Together, we can ensure that we become the hospital that our city needs us to be.\n\nImportant information about your Medi-Cal coverage\n\nDue to a recent federal law, continuous Medi-Cal enrollment ended on March 31, 2023, so you need to take steps to ensure your health insurance coverage will continue if you are eligible."
