        "text": "One Napa Valley Initiative: Celebrating 2,388 New U.S. Citizens\n\nSince its launch in 2013, our One Napa Valley Initiative (ONVI) has profoundly transformed the Napa Valley community, turning the dream of U.S. citizenship into a tangible reality for thousands. Spearheaded by Napa Valley Community Foundation, this program is a testament to the power of collaboration among four key nonprofit partners: Immigration Institute of the Bay Area, On the Move, Puertas Abiertas Community Resource Center, and UpValley Family Centers. Together, these organizations have crafted a seamless approach to navigating the complexities of naturalization.\n\nMore than 2,388 hardworking community members have gained citizenship through ONVI, and with a remarkable success rate of 98 percent, the collaborative approach to assisting lawful permanent residents (also known as “green card” holders) in becoming U.S. citizens is a model for other communities.\n\nRead More\n\nThe ADU Center Expands to Marin County\n\nWhen we launched the Napa Sonoma ADU Center in 2020, it was a significant undertaking — the recent wildfires had severely impacted an already tight housing market, and we believed that Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) had the potential to become a bigger part of the solution.\n\nNow, we are excited to share The ADU Center’s rebranding and expansion into other North Bay counties, starting with Marin County. The newly renamed ADU Center’s next phase is fueled by a significant investment from the County of Marin, which recognizes how the ADU Center’s efforts can help local communities achieve their housing goals.\n\n“Expanding our services to Marin County marks a milestone in our work,” shares Scott Johnson, Director of the ADU Center. “We’re here to support Marin residents every step of the way, from dreaming about an ADU to turning those dreams into reality.”\n\nExpanding Access to The ADU Center: From Napa and Sonoma to Marin County\n\nOur May Town Hall Event: California Forever?\n\nOn Wednesday, May 16, 2024 join Napa Valley Community Foundation (NVCF) for a thought-provoking Town Hall event, “California Forever?,” featuring Conor Dougherty, a distinguished New York Times reporter renowned for his in-depth coverage of housing and urban development.\n\nConor brought the ambitious California Forever project into the national spotlight when he broke news about the eye-popping proposal and its until-then secret backers.\n\nThis event will delve into Conor’s groundbreaking and comprehensive reporting on the Solano County mega-project and explore, more broadly, the challenges and opportunities of creating more housing in California.\n\nRSVP for the Event"
