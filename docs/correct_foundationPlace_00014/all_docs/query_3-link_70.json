        "text": "About Good Neighbor Next Door\n\nLaw enforcement officers, teachers (pre-Kindergarten through 12th grade) firefighters and emergency medical technicians can contribute to community revitalization while becoming homeowners through HUD's Good Neighbor Next Door Sales Program. HUD offers a substantial incentive in the form of a discount of 50% from the list price of the home. In return, an eligible buyer must commit to live in the property for 36 months as his/her principal residence.\n\nHow the Program Works\n\nEligible Single Family homes located in revitalization areas are listed exclusively for sale through the Good Neighbor Next Door Sales program. Properties are available for purchase through the program for seven days.\n\nHow to Participate in Good Neighbor Next Door\n\nCheck the listings for your state. Follow the instructions to submit your interest in purchasing a specific home. If more than one person submits an offer on a single home a selection will be made by random lottery. You must meet the requirements for a law enforcement officer, teacher, firefighter or emergency medical technician and comply with HUD's regulations for the program.\n\nHUD requires that you sign a second mortgage and note for the discount amount. No interest or payments are required on this \"silent second\" provided that you fulfill the three-year occupancy requirement.\n\nThe number of properties available is limited and the list of available properties changes weekly."
