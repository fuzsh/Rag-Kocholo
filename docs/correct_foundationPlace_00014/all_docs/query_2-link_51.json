        "text": "Gordon Samuel Watkins was named UC Riverside's first provost in 1949 - a position he held until his retirement in 1956.\n\nHe was recalled to serve on the UC Santa Barbara campus as dean of the School of Education after that and died in 1970.\n\nGordon Watkins\n\nProvost, 1949-1956\n\nHerman Theodore Spieth was chief campus officer at the Riverside campus during a period of transition when the small liberal arts college was moving toward full university status.\n\nHe was named provost in 1956 and held this title until the Regents designated Riverside a general campus in 1958 and his title was changed to chancellor. He served as chancellor until 1964 when he transferred to UC Davis as a professor of zoology. He died in 1988.\n\nHerman Spieth\n\nProvost, 1950 to 1958, Chancellor 1958 to June 1964\n\nIvan Hinderaker was UCR's longest-serving chancellor.
