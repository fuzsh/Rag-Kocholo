        "text": "From 2000 to 2005, OGALS administered approximately $2 billion in local park construction projects funded by Proposition 12 (2000 Bond Act) and Proposition 40 (2002 Bond Act). Through discussions at project site inspections, OGALS began to discover differences between how some projects were designed and the value of asking neighborhood residents for park design input before projects were built. Engaging residents in park design increased care for the park and decreased vandalism. OGALS learned from various community groups the importance of creating a sense of ownership, and its powerful impact on a park's long term success.\n\nDuring this period, OGALS started introducing competitive grant program criteria to evaluate whether a project's design included a \"significant,\" \"average,\" or \"minimal\" range of ideas from neighborhood residents. Grant applicants often asked what was needed to include a \"significant\" range of residents' ideas. However, specific goals and technical assistance for community-based planning were not available for competitive grant applicants during this timeframe.\n\nDuring this early era, the department also learned of challenges with using traditional council, board and commission meetings as park design sessions due to the following reasons:\n\nTime: Meetings held during daytime work hours were difficult to access for working adults and parents.\n\nLocation: Meetings outside project neighborhoods were difficult for seniors, youth, and economically disadvantaged residents to access due to a lack of private transportation and practical public transportation options.\n\nFacilitation: Council and commission meeting agendas generally include other local government topics that differ from a park design workshop format.\n\nThe passage of Proposition 84 (2006) Bond Act and Assembly Bill 31 (2008) created the SPP. SPP statute is found in California Public Resources Code §§5640 through 5653. SPP provides funds for land acquisition and development to create, expand, and improve parks in underserved communities. It also gives priority to \"project applicants that actively involve the public and community-based groups in the selection and planning of the project.\"\n\nThe passage of these measures presented an opportunity to develop and introduce a new strategy for crafting a community-based planning formula with clear and specific goals. In 2008/2009 when the new strategy was introduced to focus groups and at public hearings, there was some public resistance. Some potential applicants shared the following concerns:\n\n\"We have had meetings in the past and no one shows up.\" \"We do not have a meeting space in the project area.\" \"The public are not park designers.\"\n\nBecause of the initial concerns presented from the public, the SPP Team challenged hundreds of park professionals at thirty statewide focus groups and public hearings to offer solutions and feedback on the proposed community-based planning goals. Solutions were added to a technical assistance section for grant applicants within the SPP Application Guide. The final guidelines were adopted, and SPP served as an effective touchpoint for residents, local government agencies and community organizations to collaborate in park design efforts that embraced the spirit, needs and culture of communities statewide.\n\nAccording to residents, park design meetings held in their neighborhoods helped them develop personal connections with their local government and neighbors. Park directors, staff, and city managers shared their satisfaction with working with their constituents and how residents' ideas contributed to the better project design. This process encourages a thoughtful exchange of knowledge by professional project managers who offer technical expertise, and neighborhood residents, who offer insight about their community's needs based on their daily life experiences.\n\nDefining Core Terms\n\nClarity and guidance are crucial for the success of the collaborative process. Having universal terms allows for consistency and promotes participant creativity. In this model, three core definitions are: \"residents,\" \"broad representation,\" and \"meetings.\" In summary, these definitions guide planners to meet with a representative cross-section of groups surrounding the project. These definitions also encourage dynamic park design discussions resulting in popular parks that serve multiple generations.\n\n\"Residents\" is defined as \"the population living within a half-mile of the project site including youth, families, and seniors.\"\n\nWhat is the intent behind this definition?\n\nDefining 'Residents' guides park planners to focus their engagement on those who live within walking distance of the project and are most likely to be affected by the benefits and potential challenges of living close to public spaces. Engaging residents has proven to be critical for these reasons:\n\nStudies have shown that people use the parks closest to their homes more frequently; and,\n\nPeople who live in neighborhoods nearest to the project site are experts about what the community needs, including ideas for safe public use; and,\n\nResidents living within walking distance may feel a sense of ownership over the park, and are more likely to actively monitor and contribute to the upkeep and safety of the facilities.\n\nEncourage engagement of all age groups to design a park that serves multiple interests in the community.\n\n\"Broad Representation\" is defined \"inclusion of design ideas from residents that may have different recreational needs, including youth, seniors, and families. Inclusion of people with disabilities, single adults, and immigrants is also encouraged. The sole involvement of an advocacy group or league likely to promote a specific recreation feature does not meet this intent.\"\n\nWhat is the intent behind this definition?\n\nThis definition guides park planners to encourage a dynamic discussion that considers the varied interests of the community. Park designs that incorporate various interests and meet a wide range of needs will likely be more popular and heavily used.\n\n\"Meeting\" is defined as \"residents working together as a group in person with the applicant or with the applicant's partnering community-based organization(s) to design the park. This type of meeting can be creative, cost-effective, and non-traditional. Formal public hearings are not required.\"\n\nWhat is the intent behind this definition?\n\nThis definition guides park planners to encourage brainstorming and group thinking. By supporting dynamic group discussions, residents will often build off of each other's ideas; resulting in project designs that more accurately reflect their collective vision. Things to consider:\n\nIf an organization lacks experience in organizing community focused meetings they may consider partnering with community-based organizations to assist with engaging residents.\n\nConsider innovative approaches to make park design meetings with residents interactive and dynamic.\n\nTo increase participation, it is important to schedule meetings close to the project area's neighborhood residents. Also consider residents' work or family schedules. This section provides detailed guidance on how to make meetings accessible for residents.\n\nFrom the SPP Application Guide:\n\n\"The applicant or partners facilitated at least five meetings, between June 5, 2018, and the application deadline, to obtain ideas from the residents.\"\n\nWhy five meetings?\n\nDuring SPP focus groups and public hearings, participants indicated that five meetings were a reasonable amount to accommodate the needs of residents with various employment schedules. Participants also felt that meetings should be relatively recent to ensure that recommendations meet the needs of current residents.\n\nLocation Access: Meeting locations should occur, if possible, at the project site or within the project site's half-mile radius. By listening to the residents who live nearest to the project site, and incorporating their ideas, a sense of ownership is fostered which can strengthen the project's long-term success. Scheduling accessible meeting locations is also critical for increasing residents' participation. Meetings held outside the project area require additional transportation resources and travel time, which can make it more challenging for residents to access.\n\nThe phrase \"or within a convenient distance\" allows for some flexibility in rural areas in cases where there are no neighborhoods within a half-mile walking distance of the project site. If, however, a neighborhood or school exists within the project area's half-mile radius, every effort should be made to schedule meetings close to the project site. When facilities are available, conducting meetings outside of the project area should require substantial justification.\n\nFrom the SPP Application Guide:\n\n\"The meetings were located within the critically underserved community, or within a convenient distance for residents without private transportation.\"\n\n\"At least two of the meetings occurred on a weekend or in the evening.\"\n\nDates and Time Access: Providing five meeting opportunities for people with varying work or family schedules is challenging, but essential. Schedule at least two of the meetings during evenings or weekends. Please read the guidance below to learn about scheduling meetings on a weekend or in the evening.\n\n\"In the evening\": Weekdays helps to reach working people who may not be able to meet from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. A 6 p.m. or later start time may accommodate people who are commuting from work and picking up children on their way back to their neighborhood. Meetings with students at school or from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. after school may be ideal for youth. A morning to midday meeting might work well for elders.\n\n\"On a weekend\": Weekend meetings target all groups and allow for multi-generational work sessions.\n\nApplication Tip: Scheduling meetings well in advance of an application deadline, will likely strengthen your application, since the content of your application will be rooted from a community-based process. Places to meet: Community leaders or residents might help identify the best meeting locations and times. Cost-effective strategies for meeting locations, dates, and times include:\n\nSidewalk meetings at the proposed project site are an effective way to have a meeting within walking distance for the residents. Applicants or a partnering community group can set up a banner, easels, and tables on a weekend morning. Applicants can canvas neighborhoods in advance and on the day of the meeting to invite residents to attend. Organizers should go door-to-door inviting residents to walk to the site and join their neighbors to discuss park design ideas.\n\nCommunity-based organizations, schools, libraries, faith-based organizations, and restaurants, such as pizza parlors, may agree to provide meeting space.\n\nGo to where people meet: Take meetings to where people are already congregating. Examples of taking meetings to residents include:\n\nCollaborating with a school to schedule a meeting with classes.\n\nAdding to the agendas of neighborhood/community-based organization meetings where residents will be available.\n\nIf there is a 55+ neighborhood area, try scheduling a meeting there. Or, try collaborating with a Senior Nutrition Program.\n\nEvent Participation: Engaging residents at community festivals, shopping centers, farmers' markets, and other events are useful, especially if the event is within walking distance of the project site. While this method should not be the only modality utilized for gathering community input, it can be used to get feedback on ideas that may be generated from previous community meetings. In these types of settings residents typically approach event booths one at a time. It is, therefore, important to be creative in your booth design to allow residents an opportunity to provide input that continues to clarify the collective desires of the community.\n\nSurvey: A survey may be used during the process but is not a \"meeting\" by itself. In other words, it can be a tool for gathering data but does not replace the value of brainstorming together, where insight shared by one participant can spark additional ideas and contributions from others.\n\nAfter scheduling meeting locations and times, the second step is to reach a Broad Representation of Residents. Inviting a Broad Representation of Residents is essential for attendance as well as ensuring diverse input. This section explains how to notify and invite a broad representation of residents to participate in the meetings.\n\nFrom the SPP Application Guide: \"For the combined set of meetings, at least three methods were used to invite a Broad Representation of Residents.\" Guidance for inviting different age groups of residents are listed on the next page.\n\nFrom the SPP Application Guide: \"The number and general description of the Residents who participated in the combined set of meetings consisted of a Broad Representation of the critically underserved community.\"\n\nThis step encourages applicants to engage all age groups, including youth, seniors, and families within the project area. The goal is to get perspectives so the park is designed to meet a broad range of needs.\n\nA reasonable number of residents in the project area should participate in the meetings. However, in heavily urbanized communities, over 20,000 people may live within the project's half-mile radius, while in rural areas, 100 people may live in a half-mile radius of the project.\n\nWhat is an appropriate number of meeting participants? In general, past SPP applicants engaged approximately 30 to 300 residents between five meetings.\n\nSuccessful outreach requires thoughtful planning. To increase participation, residents should be contacted at least one week prior to a meeting. Successful outreach should help lead to a Broad Representation of Residents.\n\nPark Design Goal 1 – Designing Recreation Features (Process)\n\nAfter selecting the highest priority features for the park, it's time to gather design ideas for those features.\n\nFrom the SPP Application Guide:\n\n\"Describe how the Residents were enabled to provide design ideas for the selected recreation feature(s). The goal is to ask Residents for detailed design ideas of the features, after the features are selected.\"\n\nAsk for detailed design ideas to enhance a recreation feature's function, materials, themes, color, size, shape, etc. Methods may include:\n\nUse photos as a starting point.\n\nProvide paper and pens for residents to sketch ideas.\n\nCreate a brainstorming list and then gather feedback or vote on favorite ideas.\n\nRemember, not all recreation features are built alike. The design details can enhance the use and quality of a recreational feature.\n\nDesign detail examples of play areas, basketball courts, and soccer fields are shown on the following pages.\n\nPark Design Goal 1 – List of Design Ideas for the Recreation Features (Outcome)\n\nFinalizing a list of design ideas for the recreation features completes the step above.\n\nFrom the SPP Application Guide:\n\n\"List the residents' ideas that will be included in the design of the recreation feature(s). Avoid listing ideas that will not be included.\"\n\nThroughout the meetings, maintaining a list of accepted design ideas for the recreation features is helpful. Eventually, the list will be incorporated in bid packages and construction documents. For this reason, only the final accepted ideas should be on the list. The list for the design of the selected recreation features should represent detailed design ideas, such as function, materials, theme, color, size, shape, and number.\n\nExamples of design details can be found on the next three pages.\n\nExamples of Design Details\n\nAre All Playgrounds Alike?\n\nThese are examples of different playground \"design details\" that enrich park use.\n\nPark Design Goal 3 – Process to ask for ideas about safe public use and park beautification\n\n\"The enjoyment of scenery employs the mind without fatigue and yet exercises it; tranquilizes it and yet enlivens it; and thus, through the influence of the mind over the body gives the effect of refreshing rest and reinvigoration to the whole system.\" Frederick Law Olmsted in 1848\n\nFrom the SPP Application Guide:\n\n\"Describe the process that enabled Residents to provide park design ideas for safe public use and park beautification.\"\n\nThis third goal for the park's design seeks residents' ideas about safe public use and beautification. Both safety and beautification are critical to a park's success.\n\nSafe public use: If residents do not feel safe, they will be less likely to use the park.\n\nAsk how the park design can incorporate safe public use. Consider lighting throughout the park or other things to assist police and minimize hiding areas for illegal activity.\n\nOnce the general ideas of park safety are established, the discussion can move to specific features.\n\nInviting the local police and fire departments to participate may help build connections and provide design insight for safe public use.\n\nRemember that neighbors who live near the project site often have first-hand knowledge of problems in the area and may also have suggestions to improve safe public use.\n\nPark Beautification:\n\nThe community's physical environment and mental health of residents can be improved through a scenically pleasing park. This final design goal involves landscaping or public art.\n\nExplain to residents that this goal is to make their park beautiful!\n\nArt to beautify the park:\n\nThis may involve public art themes that are important to the residents. Explain that art such as mosaics, tiles, murals, and sculptures can be developed to beautify the park.\n\nResidents may offer art concepts to capture the project site's history, or the community's cultural or natural history, or other recreation themes. Cultural conditions can be improved through public art in parks that reflect and celebrate the history and diverse cultures of surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nExamples seen in SPP projects included handprints by local neighborhood children added to wall tiles or pathways, tiles created by a nearby school's art class, murals to beautify a structure, or sculpture. A school art class and artists can suggest design, placement, installation, and maintenance.\n\nLandscaping to beautify the park:\n\nFor landscaping ideas, photos of trees and plants can help start the discussion.\n\nSPP encourages the use of native, drought-tolerant plants, trees, and flowers to create a \"sense of place\" in the park.\n\nUrban farms, fruit, vegetable, and herb gardens can add beauty while celebrating the residents' culture. These gardens can bring together all ages to learn about their own and other's heritage.\n\nGardens can also provide an area for quiet reflection.\n\nExamples of park beautification are below.\n\nPark Design Goal 3 – Create a list of safe public use ideas that will be included in the project\n\nFrom the SPP Application Guide:\n\n\"List the Residents' (safe public use) ideas that will be included in the proposed project. Avoid listing ideas that will not be included.\"\n\nThroughout the meetings, maintaining a list of accepted design ideas for safe public use is helpful. Eventually, the list will be incorporated in bid packages and construction documents. For this reason, only the final accepted ideas should be in the list.\n\n\"I think the most significant benefit (and somewhat unexpected as well) is that the community engagement process truly did result in a better park design for both the community and the County! The community came up with ideas beyond what Parks and Recreation staff had discussed. Community ideas allowed the project to progress and garner wide-range support. For instance, one of the neighbors near Walnut Park was very concerned about the park going in next to her mother's home. She was actively against the projectvinitially, but as she joined one of the groups at a community engagement event and began to discuss her concerns, she changed her mind on the project. She alone came up with the idea of having a sheriff's office on the site to help with possible crime and vandalism. That idea was adopted by all the groups. It was her input that helped create a better park design and a better 'fit' in the neighborhood by addressing ongoing neighborhood concerns. In the end, she was one of the biggest proponents of the project.\"\n\nTodd Schmit | Section Head for Landscape Architecture and Design, Planning and Development Agency, County of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\nBuilding Social Capital, Cohesion, and Capacity\n\nThe SPP community-based planning process produces unexpected benefits. Conducting in-person meetings with a broad representation of residents creates a sense of place. By giving communities a voice in park design, there is a synergy that develops leading to building community capacity.\n\nState Parks emphasized how park development projects improve the physical environment of communities. During conversations with Round 3 SPP applicants throughout California, an interesting and unexpected statewide pattern about this process began to emerge:\n\nBy designing a park, SPP community-based planning also builds \"social capital!\"\n\nAs defined by Oxford Dictionary, \"Social Capital\" means:\n\n\"The networks of relationships among people who live and work in a particular society, enabling that society to function effectively.\"\n\nDesigning a park is a catalyst that brings residents, local agencies, and community organizations together to serve their community. When residents work together to transform an area into a vibrant park, it becomes a symbol of community pride.\n\nThe following pages provide quotes from communities about how this process strengthened relationships between local government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and neighborhood residents.\n\nFinding Talent in Residents During the Community Planning Process\n\nWhen residents are empowered to work together with local government or non-profit organizations, some may show a natural ability to inspire community-driven efforts. Enthusiastic and talented resident leaders discovered through the process have been recruited to join an organization's or agency's workforce. Here's an example!\n\n\"My name is Kimberly McCoy and I am from Fresno, California. In 2012, I was frustrated with local political decisions affecting my family. I was looking for a way to get involved in my community and volunteered. I received training on how to connect with other neighbors and be civically involved, which I enjoyed. I became a team leader and led door-to-door and phone banking campaigns throughout the Central Valley to connect everyday people to decision-making processes and help them understand how to engage in issues they care about. In 2014, I was promoted to a community organizer. I conducted one-on-one visits and led house meetings with residents in communities that wanted to create change.\n\nI learned about the importance of:\n\nEmpowering people by removing barriers that often prevent them from engaging civically – from scheduling meetings during community-friendly hours to ensuring that interpreter and childcare services are available.\n\nIdentifying community strengths and assets and building on those.\n\nThe power of relationships. Social capital is one of the most overlooked assets in many communities. In order to be successful on any issue or campaign, relationships must be nurtured, and people must feel like they are active decision makers. That is why I begin by meeting people where they live to understand what issues are important to them.\n\nIn 2018, I was hired as Project Director for Fresno Building Healthy Communities and led signature gathering efforts to advance local measures such as Measure P on the November 2018 ballot for parks, arts, and trails in the City of Fresno. I continue to support community groups in identifying, planning, and implementing strategies to advance a common agenda of community health. In 2019, I was selected to be a voice for the community on the AB 617 Community Air Protection Program Steering Committee, to elevate community priorities and emission reduction opportunities in Fresno's most impacted communities.\n\nI have enjoyed being able to connect and build relationships with residents, shaping decision-making processes and supporting my neighbors to leverage their power by using their voice. That is how we will continue to build healthy communities with authentic community engagement. I hope my story can inspire other residents to become a leader for their community. Thank you.\"\n\nKimberly McCoy | Project Director, Fresno Building Healthy Communities\n\nFuture Planning Efforts\n\nEncouraging community-based planning in grant programs is founded on this basic question: For community parks, should the state prioritize one type of recreation facility over another, based on national, state, or regional surveys?\n\nHistorically, in competitive programs, grant writers and even grant guidelines cited national, state, or regional surveys to determine what types of recreation facilities should be in a community park. For example, the results of regional or statewide surveys were used to prioritize which type of facility ranked higher in California's competitive Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) applications. A picnic area ranked higher than a playground, a baseball field ranked higher than a soccer field, and a tennis court higher than a basketball court.\n\nDuring application workshops of prior grant programs, however, local government applicants frequently reported that their community's needs were different from the statewide or regional survey results. National, state, or regional surveys may not capture the priorities of cities, and even more specifically, of neighborhoods within different areas of the same cities. Community parks provide close-to-home park access, particularly for seniors and children. Each community has unique unmet recreation needs for park access and infrastructure.\n\nFor these reasons, SPP prioritizes new park access while encouraging flexibility in park design responsive to each community's unique recreation needs. Due to the recent 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, new community-based planning methods following health guidelines will be tested for the next round of SPP grant funding. To inform future planning efforts over the next five years, State Parks' CED will continue to share successful methods learned through the SPP model.\n\nPlease find both inspiration and confidence to use this model.\n\nBy doing so, you will design a vibrant park reflecting the community's unique needs and identity. Further, it fosters an added benefit by bringing together neighbors, local government, and community organizations. Using the SPP model builds social capital when participants realize their common goals.\n\nEngaging neighbors to plan a park for all to use can be a life-changing experience.\n\nEnjoy the journey!"
