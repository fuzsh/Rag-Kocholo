        "text": "Under a California law created more than 50 years ago, housing projects large and small across the state have been required to undergo environmental review.\n\nThe process outlined by the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (widely known as CEQA) is intended to push developers to mitigate potential environmental harms. It can also delay projects for years, cost developers millions of dollars and even kill projects in wealthy neighborhoods that rarely build new housing.\n\nNow, an independent state agency is recommending that lawmakers broadly exempt new urban housing from these reviews in the interest of moving the needle on the state’s intractable housing crisis.\n\n“California will never achieve its housing goals as long as CEQA has the potential to turn housing development into something akin to urban warfare — contested block by block, building by building,” concludes the report, published last week by the Little Hoover Commission.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe report, one year in the making, finds that CEQA has in many ways made good on its intent to protect California’s environment. For example, it’s been instrumental in blocking oil wells in residential areas and protecting old-growth redwoods in Northern California.\n\nAt the same time, the authors found the law is most often used to challenge new housing — often apartment buildings located in already developed urban areas, known as “infill” housing. Those challenges make up about 25% of all CEQA lawsuits.\n\n“The commission was motivated by a belief that California needs to do something to address housing,” said Ethan Rarick, the commission’s executive director. “Infill housing is the kind of housing that will most allow the state to meet its environmental goals.”\n\nElected officials around the state are under pressure to greatly accelerate the pace of new housing. In the city of L.A. alone, officials must plan for close to half a million new homes by 2029 under state law. So far L.A. and many other cities are far off that pace, hobbled by high costs and numerous hurdles, including environmental challenges and pushback from existing residents.\n\nWhen housing is constrained in the cities where people work and hope to live, the report notes, developers will instead build housing in exurban areas, forcing Californians into long, polluting commutes and placing new homes at heightened risk of wildfires.\n\nThat’s motivated state officials to take steps to encourage more housing in existing urban cores. They’ve already exempted certain housing projects from environmental review, they’ve slashed parking requirements near public transit hubs and they’ve cracked down on cities attempting to limit new construction. In Southern California, planning officials have shifted the burden of new housing production goals away from the Inland Empire and toward coastal areas.\n\nA broad definition of environmental harm\n\nDespite these steps, L.A. housing developers continue to face environmental challenges that can be expensive and time consuming.\n\nLAist recently covered a case where an environmental challenge delayed an 100% affordable housing project in L.A.’s Sawtelle neighborhood for months, despite the city’s assurances that such projects were not subject to CEQA. The opponent who filed the challenge told LAist he did not think the project would worsen air pollution, but did think it would harm the value of his property next door.\n\nRarick noted that expensive land and construction costs would be huge constraints no matter what, so it’s not fair to blame the state’s lack of affordable housing entirely on CEQA. But he said the law does allow pretty much anyone to fight new housing for a wide range of reasons.\n\n“The law specifies the kinds of environmental harm that can be considered under CEQA to include things like aesthetics, views, noise,” Rarick said. “Sometimes there are CEQA cases that many people might not consider to be related to traditional environmental concerns, even if legally, the case can proceed.”\n\nCurrent CEQA process\n\nPushback to change cites environmental injustice\n\nOn top of broadly exempting housing in existing urban areas from environmental reviews, the commission’s report recommends limiting who can file a CEQA lawsuit to those able to articulate how a project would cause environmental, rather than purely economic, harm.\n\nDefenders of the current process under CEQA say the law offers disadvantaged Californians one of the few avenues for challenging large projects in already crowded neighborhoods experiencing environmental injustice.\n\nJennifer Ganata, the legal department co-director for Communities for a Better Environment, said, “There's a difference when you're talking about somebody who's a NIMBY somewhere in Calabasas or Malibu versus somebody who has been organizing in their community, whether that's in Chinatown or Southeast L.A.”\n\nGanata said residents in these areas should be able to push for thorough environmental reviews of new housing. Developers should have to answer questions from residents about the steps they’re taking to ensure that housing located near existing or former industrial sites is not exposing communities to pollution, she said.\n\n“For us, CEQA is like a deep democracy tool. We are trying to tell our members, ‘You have a seat at the table, and you're able to actually discuss real community planning solutions,’” Ganata said. “The recommendations provided in the report don't really think about that. It's more like, how do we just get these units built and not really think about it.”\n\nReport points to model in Washington state\n\nEfforts to reform CEQA have so far been piecemeal. Lawmakers have carved out exemptions for specific types of housing, such as deed-restricted affordable housing on church land and projects meeting certain requirements in dense commercial corridors.\n\nBut more sweeping reforms have run into dead ends. CEQA is used not only by neighborhood groups who oppose apartments in wealthy communities, but also by powerful labor unions and competing businesses. Former state senator Darrell Steinberg jokingly referred to his failed 2013 CEQA reform bill as the “How to Make No Friends Act.”\n\nThe Little Hoover Commission report identifies one potential model for California lawmakers interested in taking up the gauntlet. Washington state lawmakers recently voted to exempt projects from environmental review if they’re located inside urban growth areas.\n\nThe report says, bluntly, “California should follow this example.”\n\nHow to watchdog government\n\nThe next hearing of the Little Hoover Commission is scheduled for Thursday, May 23 at 10 a.m.\n\nAgenda: Artificial Intelligence and State Government\n\nNote: 30 minutes of public comment is planned, 3 minute limit per speaker\n\nTo join virtually:\n\nURL: https://bit.ly/4buNXmu\n\nWebinar ID: 991 4704 6765\n\nPasscode: 472052\n\nPhone: (888) 788 0099\n\nIf you care about local housing affordability"
