        "text": "Inspiring The Scientists of Tomorrow\n\nCommitment to Science Education\n\nThe Amgen Foundation is guided by the belief that everyone needs science, and science needs everyone. We believe that understanding the fundamentals of science is as critical as reading and writing. Our goal is to ensure that location and financial status are no longer barriers to high-quality science education. By broadening access to engaging and inspiring science programs, we are equipping future generations with the essential skills needed to thrive in our increasingly complex world.\n\nFor more than 30 years, the Amgen Foundation has focused on​ developing future scientists, raising scientific literacy and empowering tomorrow’s problem solvers. We have​ already invested over $270 million to re-imagine science education and provide best-in-class science education at no cost to students. In 2023 alone, we reached 25 million students and educators worldwide, through our four science education programs.\n\nOur commitment is to inspire the next generation of scientists and future problem solvers — wherever they are.\n\nStrengthening communities\n\nThe Foundation, established in 1990, is an integral component of Amgen's commitment to dramatically improve people's lives and the principal channel for Amgen’s corporate philanthropy. In addition to its primary focus on science education, the Foundation has committed an additional $180 million to local, regional and international nonprofit organizations that reflect Amgen’s core values and complement the company’s dedication to impacting lives in inspiring and innovative ways."
