        "text": "It’s been a long time coming but the long-awaited Northern California Backcountry Discovery Route (CABDR-North) is finally debuting February 17th, 2024. Part of the reason for the delay has been the need for numerous re-routes due to devastating forest fires in the region but, based on the highlights the BDR has released, the wait will be well worth it.\n\nUnlike the arguably more challenging Southern California BDR, the NorCal main route has been developed with beginner riders in mind. That doesn’t mean the route is without its challenges. If you want to turn the level of difficulty up several notches, its optional advanced sections will deviate from the main route for miles and offer some of the longest, sustained technical terrain on any BDR.\n\nWith a 70/30 dirt to pavement ratio, off-road fans will have plenty of tracks to take on but the BDR says the pavement sections shine too with the best peg scraping twisties in the state. And in case you were wondering, the route has virtually no sand, unless you want to challenge your skills on the many optional advanced sections.\n\n“The NorCal route is one that seasoned riders can invite their “new to BDR” friends or family to; and have a wonderful time on its flowing two track roads and gravel tracks through dense pine forests and burned sections that are eerily majestic,” explains the non-profit organization.\n\nExplore relics of mining towns of the past, delve into California history and geologic wonders and ascend countless peaks to fire lookouts with endless views of the route below. Many dirt and gravel roads on the route are ones on which to relax and take in the incredible views.\n\nLike all previous BDRs, the CABDR-North will include free GPS tracks, travel resources, a Butler Motorcycle Map, and an expedition documentary film.\n\nPhotos by Backcountry Discovery Routes"
