        "text": "Junipero Serra\n\nAlthough Spain claimed California as its territory in 1542, Spaniards didn’t try to occupy the land until the late 1700s.\n\nAround the time of the first missions, Spain had a considerable presence in Mexico. In 1769, the Spanish king ordered land and sea expeditions to depart from Mexico to California. He also sent military troops and Franciscan missionaries to the new land.\n\nFranciscan priest Father Junipero Serra founded the first mission in 1769. This was known as Mission San Diego de Alcalá and was located in present-day San Diego.\n\nSan Diego Mission\n\nThe native Indians who occupied the region were initially resistant to the mission. In 1775, hundreds of local Tipai-Ipai Indians attacked and burned the San Diego Mission, killing three men, including Father Luis Jayme. The missionaries rebuilt the mission as an army fort.\n\nJunipero Serra went on to establish eight more missions before his death in 1784.\n\nGoals of the Missions\n\nThe main goal of the California missions was to convert Native Americans into devoted Christians and Spanish citizens.\n\nSpain used mission work to influence the natives with cultural and religious instruction.\n\nAnother motivation for the missions was to ensure that rival countries, such as Russia and Great Britain, didn’t try to occupy the California region first.\n\nCalifornia Missions List\n\nThe 21 California missions, listed in the order they were founded, are:\n\n1. (1769) Mission San Diego de Alcalá\n\n2. (1770) Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo\n\n3. (1771) Mission San Antonio de Padua\n\n4. (1771) Mission San Gabriel\n\n5. (1772) Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa\n\n6. (1776) Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores)\n\n7. (1776) Mission San Juan Capistrano\n\n8. (1777) Mission Santa Clara de Asís\n\n9. (1782) Mission San Buenaventura\n\n10. (1786) Mission Santa Barbara\n\n11. (1787) Mission La Purísima Concepción\n\n12. (1791) Mission Santa Cruz\n\n13. (1791) Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad\n\n14. (1797) Mission San José\n\n15. (1797) Mission San Juan Bautista\n\n16. (1797) Mission San Miguel Arcángel\n\n17. (1797) Mission San Fernando Rey de España\n\n18. (1798) Mission San Luis Rey de Francia\n\n19. (1804) Mission Santa Inés\n\n20. (1817) Mission San Rafael Arcángel\n\n21. (1823) Mission San Francisco Solano\n\nLife in the Mission\n\nThe missions created new communities where the Native Americans received religious education and instruction. The Spanish established pueblos (towns) and presidios (forts) for protection.\n\nThe natives lived in the missions until their religious training was complete. Then, they would move to homes outside of the missions.\n\nOnce the natives converted to Christianity, the missionaries would move on to new locations, and the existing missions served as churches.\n\nThe native converts were known as “neophytes.” After they were baptized, they were expected to perform labor. Typically, men worked in the fields, and women cooked. Both learned Spanish and attended church.\n\nFarming was an especially important job in the mission community. Wheat, barley and maize were some of the staple crops that were grown. The Spanish missionaries also brought fruits from Europe, such as apples, peaches and pears.\n\nOther jobs included carpentry, building, weaving and leather-working.\n\nPadres, or religious leaders, oversaw the mission. They were assigned six soldiers to protect them and the mission properties.\n\nMission Architecture\n\nThe mission period greatly influenced architecture in California. Many of the buildings, houses and churches still exist today.\n\nNative Americans used all-natural materials, such as stone, timber, mud brick, adobe and tile to build mission structures. Typically, buildings had large courtyards with tall adobe walls. Missions were built around patios that contained fountains and a garden.\n\nThe buildings of this period are sometimes labeled as “mission style” to describe the signature design and craftsmanship.\n\nEnd of the Mission System\n\nBy 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain. For several years, there was debate about what to do with the mission system.\n\nIn 1833, the Mexican government passed a law that secularized and ended missions. California was part of Mexico during this time.\n\nSome of the mission land and buildings were turned over to the Mexican government. While much of the property was intended to be given back to the natives, private owners ended up with the majority of land.\n\nLater, missions were used as U.S. military bases in the 1846 war with Mexico.\n\nAfter gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill in 1848, Americans began to migrate by the masses to California. In 1850, California officially became a state.\n\nAbraham Lincoln granted the Catholic Church ownership of some of the California missions in 1865.\n\nToday, many of the missions are tourist attractions with their own museums.\n\nImpact of the Missions\n\nThe California missions, which stretched from San Diego to Sonoma, had a significant impact on the Native Californians.\n\nThe mission era influenced culture, religion, architecture, art, language and economy in the region.\n\nBut, the missions also impacted California Indian cultures in negative ways. Europeans forced the natives to change their civilization to match the modern world. In the process, local traditions, cultures and customs were lost.\n\nSome critics have charged that the Spanish mission system forced Native Americans into slavery and prostitution, comparing the missions to “concentration camps.”\n\nAdditionally, Spanish missionaries brought diseases with them that killed untold thousands of natives.\n\nPrior to the California missions, there were about 300,000 Native Californians. By 1834, scholars believe there were only about 20,000 remaining.\n\nSources"
