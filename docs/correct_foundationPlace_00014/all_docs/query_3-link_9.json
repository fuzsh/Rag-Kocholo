        "text": "California needs more middle-income jobs. The NCCÂ has a 15-Point Plan for Economic Competitiveness\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n1. Develop a comprehensive economic development strategy for California.\n\n2. Identify and develop top high-opportunity industry sectors.\n\n3. Set goals for small business growth focused on women, Latino, Black, Native American, Asian entrepreneurs.\n\n4. Increase the Stateâs small business procurement goal from 25% to 50%.\n\nRETENTION AND GROWTH\n\n5. Double Californiaâs economic development portfolio & budget\n\n6. Secure federal/state infrastructure and CHIP semi-conductor funding\n\n7. Provide higher incentives for technologies that are manufactured in California.\n\n8. Nurture and retain large employers.\n\n9. Align CAâs K-16 system with economic development goals.\n\nCREATING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD\n\n10. Require state government comply with rules or mandates placed on business.\n\n11. Streamline and modernize the regulatory system, including CEQA and PAGA.\n\n12. Make California competitive with other states by reducing tax burden, cost of living, cost of energy and water and providing regulatory relief.\n\nUNDERSTANDING IMPEDIMENTS TO GROWTHâ\n\n13. Track and annually report the number of lawsuits filed under CEQA and PAGA.\n\n14. Monitor job gains and losses by congressional and state legislative districts.\n\n15. Surveys of businesses that relocate to California or leave to ascertain why.\n\nCalifornia does not have a comprehensive economic development strategy â\n\nFor decades, California has focused on environmental sustainability and social equity but has not attached comparable importance to inclusive economic growth.\n\nThe Result Has Been:Â\n\nâ¢ Regional economic inequality.\n\nâ¢ Some of the worst income inequality in the nation.\n\nâ¢ The highest rate of cost-adjusted poverty in the nation\n\nDisproportionate Impacts To:Â\n\nâ¢ People of color\n\nâ¢ Inland communities\n\nâ¢ Service providers, even in the most affluent communities\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nâ¢ Other states aggressively target California businesses\n\nâ¢ Policies that drive economic growth outside of the stateâs borders often run in direct opposition to the stateâs climate goals\n\nâ\n\nEconomic development strategy must consider regional differences\n\nCalifornia is a nation-state â not one economy but a tapestry of very different regional economies. One size does not fit all. Economic strategy must be tailored to fit each regionâs strengths.\n\nâ¢ Governor Newsomâs Community Economic Revitalization Fund offers a promising first step toward creation of regional economic development strategies.\n\nâ¢ The State needs a more robust capacity to partner with regional economic development organizations to develop goals, strategies and accountability metrics that ensure statewide competitiveness.\n\nâ¢ The State needs a more robust capacity to partner with regional economic development organizations to develop goals, strategies and accountability metrics that ensure statewide competitiveness.\n\nâ\n\nHigh Volume, High Opportunity Industry Sectors\n\n- Agricultural technology\n\n- Creative industries, including movie and other content creation\n\n- Life Sciences\n\n- Managed health care\n\n- Individual, Senior, and Family Services\n\n- Professional and Technical Services\n\n- Clean Energy Products & Services\n\n- ManufacturingAutomotive\n\n- Defense, aerospace, space and missile technology\n\n- Computer hardware\n\n- Software/AI\n\n- Machining and fabrication\n\n- Medical devices\n\n- Logistics and Distribution\n\nâ\n\nFueling the Engine:Â Small business job growth\n\nSmall businesses are the backbone of California's economy, and NCC needs to actively support their growth and success.\n\nNCC should encourage public-private partnerships that provide access to capital, training, and mentorship to help small businesses expand and create jobs, with a special focus on women, Latino, Black, Native American, and Asian entrepreneurs.\n\nâ\n\nThe State should increase the goal for small business procurement goal from 25% to 50%.\n\nâ\n\nAdditionally, NCC should promote policies that reduce regulatory burdens, streamline licensing and permitting processes, and provide tax incentives to support small business growth.\n\nâ\n\nOptions to expand California economic development\n\nOption 1\n\nExpand the scope and budget of the Go-Biz organization, remaining as part of the governorâs office.\n\nâ\n\nOption 2\n\nCreate an Economic Development Corporation to work alongside GO-Biz, funded separately, to provide the personalized relationships with target companies to help them define how they can best take advantage of the stateâs resources.\n\nâ\n\nOption 3\n\nMake GO-Biz a cabinet level agency with oversight responsibility for all state programs that help create, attract and retain jobs\n\nâ\n\nTop Recommendation:Â Create a Public-Private Economic Development Corporation to work alongside Go-Biz\n\nâ¢ This model is used by the most effective economic development states (#1 Utah) and nations (Singapore, Costa Rica). California is a nation-state â not one economy but a tapestry of very different regional economies. One size does not fit all.\n\nâ¢ The State needs a more robust capacity to partner with regional economic development organizations.\n\nâ¢ Regional economic goals, strategies and accountability metrics that collectively ensure statewide competitiveness.\n\nâ¢ Seamless state-local coordination to attract, retain and grow medium-and-high-wage employment.\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Industry clusters that connect small companies (99% of all CA companies employ less than 50 employees), large companies (employ 50% of all CA workers), local education and workforce development programs.\n\nâ¢ Governance: Independent public-private board includes representation from Go-Biz and local economic development corporations in all thirteen CERF regions.\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Funding: 80% from the state, 20% regional match.\n\nâ\n\nDouble the state economic development budget\n\nâ¢ With sufficient resources, California could help regions throughout the state to fend off aggressive efforts to poach our companies to other states and retain employers.\n\nâ¢ Patterned after a federal effort authorizing steep funding increases for certain federal research agencies deemed central to long-term U.S. economic competitiveness, this proposal would provide funding increases to targeted state programs supporting Californiaâs economy and businesses.\n\nâ¢ As the state of California is preparing for potential federal funding from Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, it is vital that GO-Biz coordinate its efforts with private sector and industry leaders.\n\nâ\n\nMission of an expanded Economic Development Organization\n\nâ¢ Make it a cabinet level agency with oversight responsibility for all state programs that help create, attract and retain jobs\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Providing oversight for economic development strategy, with particular emphasis on key industry sectors\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Ensuring that inclusive economic prosperity is taken into consideration on all state policy\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Helping to create an investment climate that provides inclusive prosperity opportunities for Californians in every region of the State\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Acting as an integrator of State government services to support business investors\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Proposing policy prescriptions that will enhance Californiaâs economic competitiveness\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Providing leadership on California trade policy; and\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ Providing a one-stop-shop\n\nSecure Federal CHIPS Act Funding:Â The semiconductor industry is critical to California's economy, but it is facing\n\nsignificant challenges due to supply chain disruptions and global competition.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is critical to California's economy, but it is facing significant challenges due to supply chain disruptions and global competition.\n\nTo address these challenges, NCC needs to organize to secure at least $10 billion dollars in federal CHIP semi-conductor funding.\n\nTo recover market share, which has declined from 44% to less than 5%, California must reform CEQA, ensure a reliable supply of water and energy, and offer incentives to attract investors.\n\nSupport manufacturing for climate change industries\n\nâ¢ California has long been a leader in green technology and clean energy. This foothold and expertise must be leveraged.\n\nâ¢ California should provide higher incentives for companies that manufacture green technologies in state versus those manufactured elsewhere.\n\nâ¢ Additionally, California should massively invest in research and development to further advance green technology and create new opportunities for California businesses\n\nNurture and retain large employers\n\nâ¢ Industry generally operates in clusters. Big businesses create demand for products and services that are often best met by local suppliers.\n\nâ¢ Californiaâs economic prosperity is heavily dependent on large businesses as customers for its ecosystem of small and medium sized entrepreneurial businesses\n\nâ¢ California must address the root causes for the exodus of so many large companies.\n\nCreating a level playing field:Â Requiring state and local governments to comply with their own rules\n\nOften state or local governments will pass new laws or regulations on businesses but do not apply those same rules to themselves.\n\nIn cases where a state or local government has comparable operations, it should seek to comply with laws it has applied to the business community. This will ensure that Government\n\nworks hand in hand with the business community to address societal needs.\n\nStreamline & Modernize\n\nCEQA is a critical environmental law, but it is ridiculously cumbersome and sabotages the approval process for manufacturing and infrastructure as well as key water supply and environmental projects.\n\nCEQA also adds substantial cost and delay to housing production, making it difficult for employers to attract workers.\n\nThe Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) has become a cottage industry for lawyers to extort settlements from companies. California can protect workers rights without making itself unattractive to investors.\n\nAction on both fronts will substantially help California businesses and industries compete in a global economy.\n\nKEY GOALS\n\nFour key objectives that, if achieved, would serve to supercharge the California economy and distribute widespread opportunity throughout the state.\n\n1. Conforming Californiaâs capital gains tax with the federal government.\n\n2. Reduce Californiaâs cost of living in order to attract and retain workers.\n\n3. Ensure that businesses have a reliable and affordable source energy and water.\n\n4. Streamline and modernize Californiaâs regulatory system (e.g. CEQA and PAGA) and allow more land zoning for industrial and commercial activity\n\nProgress and Accountability:Â Monitor job gains/losses by legislative districts\n\nâ\n\nâ¢ To ensure that our economic development strategies are working, we need to monitor job gains and losses by Congressional and state legislative districts.\n\nâ¢ This will help us identify areas of success and failure and hold policymakers accountable in areas that need more attention.\n\nâ¢ By tracking job gains and losses, we can adjust our strategies and investments to maximize economic growth and the production of middle-income jobs.\n\nâRebuild California\n\n$180 billion over the next ten years are earmarked for California in federal /state funding for infrastructure projects in clean energy, roads, bridges, public transit, water storage and conveyance, and broadband.\n\nThe Governorâs 2023-24 budget cut timelines by more than three years, reduces approval documents by hundreds of thousands of pages, and saves hundreds of millions of dollars\n\nThese investments will generate more than 400,000 well-paying jobs.â\n\nLobby the Governor, the Congressional Delegation, and the US Secretary of Commerce\n\nTo implement key economic development strategies, we need more active support and involvement of key state and federal policymakers, namely the Governor, the Congressional delegation, and the US Secretary of Commerce\n\nThey provide unique political will, resources, and expertise to help California achieve significant economic development, manufacturing and infrastructure goals\n\nConclusion"
