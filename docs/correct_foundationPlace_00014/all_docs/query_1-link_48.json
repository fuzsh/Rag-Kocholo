        "text": "California Bound: Opening the West—1840 to 1846\n\nThe Saratoga Historical Foundation invites the public to hear Robert Keahey on the topic California Bound: Opening the West — 1840 to 1846. The lecture takes place at the Saratoga Foothill Club at 7:00 PM on June 25. The Saratoga Foothill Club is located at 20399 Park Place in Saratoga. Members are free and nonmembers pay $5.00.\n\nThe westward migration to California is the largest in US history, with over w250,000 people making the journey across the Great American Desert between 1840 and 1870.\n\nThe Donner Party, the California Gold Rush, and the intercontinental Railroad are indelibly etched in the annals of western history. But before the Donners, the Fort-Niners and the golden Spike there were the Bidwells, Bartlesons, Walkers and Murphys who blazed a 2000 mile trail across the rugged western plains and mountains to California.\n\nStarting with a discussion of the Oregon and Santa Fe Trails, key aspects of the development of the California Trail are examined — the drivers, the elements of a wagon train, and the people who migrated during 1840 to 1846. What was the impact of these early pioneers on the Westward migration?\n\nThe Saratoga Historical Foundation is located at 20450 Saratoga-Los Gators Road in Saratoga.\n\nFor more information: 408-867-4311 or www.saratogahistory.com\n\nTake A Moment Out and Read About the History of Saratoga Blacksmiths!\n\nThe attached presentation gives a quick overview on the roles of a blacksmith in 1850 as well as the blacksmiths that once worked in Saratoga. The information was given in a presentation to the Saratoga Foothill Club as well as was part of a display in the Saratoga Library lobby.\n\nClick here for the presentation: The History of Saratoga Blacksmiths"
