As the fiscal manager for CDE, we manage private donations to invest directly in a public education system that serves nearly 6 million students. Our team supports the CDE mission to provide a world-class education for all students, from early childhood to adulthood. The Department of Education serves our state by innovating and collaborating with educators, schools, parents, and community partners. Together, as a team, we prepare students to live, work, and thrive in a multicultural, multilingual, and highly connected world. State Superintendent Tony Thurmond and his team have set forward a bold vision, and we are honored to partner with them.\n\nTogether, letâ€™s advance educational equity in California. Our team believes that educational equity is the practice of ensuring that each child has access to an educational experience that prepares them for success. The CDE Foundation is committed to creating fundamental systemic change that supports all children, teachers, administrators, and anyone participating in education on their journey to achievement and well-being, regardless of race, class, sexual orientation, immigration status, gender, gender identity, ability, religion, and ethnicity.\n\ni"
