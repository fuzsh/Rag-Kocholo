        "text": "NCG’s community of advocates, dreamers, and believers are transforming philanthropy. To support this transformation, we choose to lean into impact, which comes from directly inspiring, mobilizing, and supporting philanthropy to shift practice. Together, our community is advancing collective impact that far exceeds what we can do alone. In 2023, the NCG organism grew. Our membership grew, we expanded our offerings, and created new opportunities for collective transformation. We have gathered stories and data to highlight what we’re made of and how we moved philanthropy to action.\n\nWe started as the “Lunch Bunch” in the 1960s, a group of philanthropic leaders committed to growing together. We formalized ourselves in the 1980s as Northern California Grantmakers with the goal of supporting a base of philanthropic members. Currently, we have more than 220 institutional members and over 4,000 individual members. For the past forty years, we have been working to gather, mobilize, and transform philanthropy.\n\nWe have been working hard for the past year to create a website that reflects our current evolution. You'll find that we've updated our brand—and it's not just about changing logos or colors. We've taken a deeper look at how we communicate our values through our new design and our refreshed mission and vision statement."
