        "text": "Candidate placement and fieldwork locations are important factors in preparing candidates for the CalTPA or CalAPA. Executive Director Mary Sandy has authored a letter to help district and county office personnel understand their role in this preparation, through initial partnerships and ongoing relationships with initial preparation programs. This letter is being provided for programs to download and distribute to all district and county offices with whom their candidates work during their preliminary programs as they continue to partner together for candidate success. The letter can also be found on the Commission's TPA webpage.\n\nThe CTC is pleased to sponsor five one-day regional workshops for practitioners who prepare and support preliminary educators. Workshops will be facilitated by practitioners; participants will gain a deeper understanding of the performance expectations measured in the CalTPA and CalAPA. Scheduled to be held at numerous locations, the CTC encourages faculty to attend a workshop close to their institution. Mileage to the workshop will be reimbursed; additional travel support is available for extraordinary travel needs; for specific information, email CalTPA@ctc.ca.gov or CalAPA@ctc.ca.gov. Registration will be from 8:30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and the workshops will be held from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. A continental breakfast and lunch will be provided. Registration is currently open.\n\nRegister for the CalTPA workshops here .\n\nRegister for the CalAPA workshops here .\n\nInstitutions are encouraged to bring small teams that will 1) serve as a leadership team who will be able to take information back to additional faculty and personnel and 2) allow all programs in the geographic region to attend.\n\nGeographic RegionLocationCalTPA DateCalAPA Date Northern CaliforniaEvaluation Systems Offices, NatomasNovember 13thNovember 14th Orange CountyConcordia, IrvineDecember 11thDecember 12th Bay AreaSanta Clara COEJanuary 29thJanuary 28th San Diego areaNational University, Clairemont-Mesa campusMarch 11th March 10th Inland Empire areaSan Bernardino County, West EndApril 7thApril 8th\n\nBeginning with the 2018–2019 year, for CalTPA Multiple Subject submissions, no translation is required if the language of instruction is Spanish.
