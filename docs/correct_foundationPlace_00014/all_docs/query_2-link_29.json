        "text": "The State Water Project is an aquatic lifeline for California because of its vital role in bringing water to cities and farms. Without it, California would never have developed into the economic powerhouse it is.\n\nThe Project diverts water from the Feather River to the Central Valley, South Bay Area and Southern California. Its key feature is the 444-mile-long California Aqueduct seen along Interstate 5.\n\nToday, an average of 34 percent of Project water supplies agriculture, mostly in the San Joaquin Valley, and 66 percent goes to homes and businesses, mainly in Southern California but also in the Bay Area.\n\nOverview\n\nBuilt and operated by the California Department of Water Resources, the State Water Project is the largest state-financed water project ever built.\n\nProject achievements include:\n\nFueling Southern California’s population and economic growth\n\nSupplying Silicon Valley with reliable, high-quality water vital to high-tech manufacturing\n\nBoosting California’s agricultural industry to be among the global leaders\n\nHelping manage floods in the Sacramento Valley\n\nProviding recreation at many of its reservoirs\n\nCreating the Project took many decades and considerable political and engineering effort.\n\nTake an aerial tour of the State Water Project.\n\nBackground\n\nProposals similar to the Project date back to the 1880s, but the political and financial support for construction was not secured until the late 1950s. Even then, the Project faced formidable engineering obstacles, including the highest water lift in the world over the Tehachapi Mountains south of Bakersfield.\n\nThe Project originally was conceived as a much larger water delivery system, but only its first phase was completed.\n\nLearn more about the history of the State Water Project.\n\nFuture\n\nContractors who buy Project water generally favor delivery of all the water the system was designed to handle. Others argue that operating at full capacity will further harm the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ecosystem.\n\nThe State Water Project and federal Central Valley Project export water from the south Delta. Government protections of some fish species limit pumping at certain times of the year. In addition, scientists say there is a major threat of Delta levee failure from an earthquake or flooding, which could severely impair Project operations and California’s water supply.\n\nIn 2007, the state shut down exports after more than 200 delt smelt were killed at the south Delta pumps. The tiny native fish is federally recognized as an endangered species and an indicator of the Delta’s overall environmental health. Protections for declining populations of Chinook salmon and Central Valley steelhead also limit water exports.\n\nWith these issues in mind, officials are seeking a permanent solution to the water export/endangered species conflict through the Bay Delta Conservation Plan, a collaborative effort by state, federal and local agencies and environmental organizations. Possibilities include alternative means of water transport and fish habitat restoration.\n\nThe Project faces financial challenges as its aging facilities require increasing maintenance and upgrades to maintain reliability.\n\nDemand for its water is expected to increase to meet the needs of California’s growing population, which is forecast to approach 50 million by 2025.\n\nFacts and Figures"
