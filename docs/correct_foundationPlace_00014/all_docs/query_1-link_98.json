        "text": "The Problem\n\nHow to Identify\n\nGo down into the crawl space – the area between the first floor and the foundation – to find out if your house is bolted to its foundation.\n\nLook for the heads of anchor bolts that fasten the sill plate – the wooden board that sits directly on top of the foundation – securely to the foundation. (See Drawings A & B below)\n\nYou should be able to see the large nuts, washers, and anchor bolts, installed at least every 4 to 6 feet along the sill plate. Steel plates are sometimes used instead of anchor bolts. (See Drawing B below)\n\nRemember\n\nIt is very expensive to lift a house, and place it back on its foundation.\n\nHomes moving off their foundations can cause gas lines to rupture, which in turn can result in fires.\n\nNote\n\nIf your home has no foundation, or an old concrete foundation, see Other Foundation Issues.\n\nThe Solution\n\nHow-to Resources\n\nDetailed information for do-it-yourselfers or engineers can be found in the International Existing Building Code, published by the International Code Council.\n\nPublication: How You Can Strengthen Your Home for the Next Big Earthquake in the Los Angeles Area, City of Los Angeles, Department of Building & Safety, October 2001.\n\nNOTE: Slab Foundations\n\nSome homes are built directly on concrete slabs. These houses do not have crawl spaces and cripple walls.\n\nNearly all homes with slab foundations that were originally built to code will have anchor bolts or straps. However, if the house is not bolted to the slab, you have an earthquake weakness.\n\nNewer homes generally have anchor bolts or straps. If you have an unfinished garage, you may be able to see the anchor bolts.\n\nYou are not required to remove siding, drywall or plaster to determine if your house has anchor bolts."
