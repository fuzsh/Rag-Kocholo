        "text": "The California Firefighters Memorial in Sacramento’s Historic Capitol Park is a unique and stunning tribute to the more than 1,500 firefighters who have died in the line of duty since California became a state in 1850. Yet, the sad reality is that every year, we lose more and more of our bravest and most dedicated individuals while on the job and we have run out of room to honor and remember them.\n\nIn recent years, The California Fire Foundation has committed itself to the expansion of the Memorial to ensure more room can be added for the fallen and to allow for a sacred place for families to gather and honor their loved ones and keep the memories of our brothers and sisters alive for future generations to come.\n\nEvery dollar raised goes directly towards the California Firefighters Memorial Expansion and making the significant improvements needed to continue honoring California's fallen firefighters and their families. And now, with any gift of $125 or more, you'll receive a special, limited edition California Firefighters Memorial Expansion Challenge Coin.\n\nShow your support for firefighters and families of the fallen with a special, limited edition Memorial Expansion Challenge Coin.\n\nThe Memorial was built and is maintained entirely through private fundraising — much of it coming from firefighters themselves. We welcome donations large and small to keep this most fitting of tributes as a legacy for our brave fallen brothers and sisters."
