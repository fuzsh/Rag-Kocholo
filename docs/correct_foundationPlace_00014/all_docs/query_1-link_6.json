We focus especially on making sure the system works for Californians with low incomes and for communities who have traditionally faced the greatest barriers to care.\n\nWe partner with leaders across the health care safety net to ensure they have the data and resources to make care more just and to drive improvement in a complex system. Dive deeper into Our Approach where we define our four annual priorities. These priorities are determined based upon our Goals & Strategy, which has been influenced by learning and assessing our impact."
