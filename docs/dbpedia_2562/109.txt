Known as Alaska’s Playground, the Kenai Peninsula is one of the state’s most beautiful and accessible areas. A wealth of roads and trails offers the potential for amazing wildlife viewing: birds, seabirds, whales, bears, moose, and caribou are all here. Of course, these critters don’t just magically appear when you walk by. So we consulted longtime wildlife biologists to put together an audio guide to three dozen hot spots that offer the best chance of spotting wildlife. We’ll take you to specific points—everywhere from the highway to backcountry trails—and give you detailed advice on where to look and what to listen for. This tour vastly increases your chances of seeing the Kenai Peninsula’s unique wildlife. Don’t go to the Kenai without it!
