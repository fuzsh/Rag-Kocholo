Anglers have reported catches throughout the Slough at both the upper and lower boat launches.\n\nSockeye salmon continue to enter into Eshamy Creek, and counts are above average. The run typically peaks in the next two weeks and fishing should be good. Milling sockeye may be available at the mouth of the creek and in Eshamy Lagoon.\n\nCutthroat Trout/Dolly Varden\n\nCutthroat trout fishing has been good to excellent in lakes throughout Prince William Sound. Cutthroat can be found at the mouth of streams or the outlets of lakes feeding on salmon fry.\n\nDolly Varden has been reported from multiple streams in Prince William Sound. Creeks may be high throughout Prince William Sound, which may make Dolly Varden fishing slow.\n\nHalibut\n\nHalibut are well-distributed throughout Prince William Sound and fishing has been good. Try fishing at the entrances of a bay at depths of 150-300’ with a jig tipped with herring.\n\nHalibut fishing has been good to excellent in the outside waters of the sound when weather has been good. Anglers are reporting limits of small to medium-sized halibut. Anglers have been successful by setting a chum bag and fishing a large herring on a circle hook.\n\nLingcod\n\nAnglers continue to catch legal-sized lingcod by jigging over rocky pinnacles in the outside water of Prince William Sound, but fishing is slowing down compared to early July. Keep your jig or bait a few feet off the bottom to reduce rockfish catches.\n\nRockfish\n\nRockfish fishing has been excellent throughout Prince William Sound and anglers have been finding schools of pelagic rockfish near the entrances to Prince William Sound.\n\nOther Finfish\n\nFishing for Pacific (gray) cod continues to be excellent throughout Prince William Sound, but may be slower than earlier in the Summer. Anglers have no trouble catching cod while targeting other saltwater species.\n\nSalmon\n\nShore fishing for pink salmon in Valdez has slowed down and the quality of fish has decreased significantly.\n\nKing salmon fishing in Prince William Sound has been fair to good. Anglers are having better success inside Prince William Sound near Glacier Island. King salmon catch rates have been very good with many good-sized fish returning to port. Try trolling a herring behind a medium-sized flasher.\n\nThere have been a few scattered reports of coho (silver) salmon. Fishing was good near Glacier, but off to a slow start for other parts of Prince William Sound. Anglers are picking up some fish near Crafton and Naked Islands, and in the southwest portion of Prince William Sound.\n\nThere have been no reports of coho (silver) salmon at Fleming Spit or the Cordova area yet, but they should start arriving in the next few weeks.\n\nLocal Lakes\n\nBlueberry and Thompson have been great for lake fishing. Fishing for rainbow trout in both lakes has been good to excellent. Anglers may also find lake trout in Blueberry and Arctic grayling in Thompson.\n\nRuth Pond (Valdez area) has also been stocked and fishing has been fair to good but will slow down as more fish are taken out.\n\nSpecial Species Information\n\nShrimp\n\nShrimpers are reporting good catches in Northern Prince William Sound while setting pots at depths around 300-400’.\n\nEmergency Orders\n\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-RS-6-35-24 increases the sockeye salmon bag and possession limit to 12 fish per day, 24 in possession in the Coghill River drainage. Additionally, this emergency order reduces the area closed to fishing adjacent to the Coghill River weir to 50 feet.\n\nEmergency Order 2-SHR-6-03-24 reduced the number of shrimp pots allowed to harvest shrimp in the Prince William Sound noncommercial shrimp fishery. The pot limit per person and per vessel has been reduced to three pots; however, of those three pots only two pots can be set in areas of historical high effort including areas near the Port of Valdez, near the Port of Whittier, and in portions of Port Wells and Culross Passage.\n\nEmergency Order 2-RF-6-04-24 reduces the rockfish bag and possession limits in Prince William Sound to three per day and six in possession of which only one per day, one in possession can be nonpelagic. In addition, from April 1 through June 30, 2023, yelloweye rockfish may not be retained.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2024 sport fishing license and king stamp!
