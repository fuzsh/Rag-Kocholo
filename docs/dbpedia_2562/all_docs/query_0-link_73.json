        "text": "CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - City of Charleston officials are continuing to evaluate flooding and storm precautions as Tropical Storm Debby hangs around.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday evening, Mayor William Cogswell said the curfew that was put in place Monday night will remain in effect through 7 a.m. Wednesday morning. At that time, leaders will assess flooding and make a decision on whether or not to lift the curfew.\n\nCogswell also announced additional pumps have been added to mitigate flood waters. He said resources from the U.S. National Guard were set to arrive Tuesday.\n\nThe mayor remained optimistic as the projected rain totals are slightly lower than what was predicted for the area even though more than 11 inches of rain has fallen in Charleston since Monday morning.\n\n“Look I don’t want to have this in place any longer than we have to. I promise you that the purpose of this curfew is not to be annoying, it is not to hurt businesses, it is to keep people off the roads and prioritize the safety of our residents and our first responders while we still have a tropical storm sitting right off of our coast,” Cogswell said during the news conference. “This is a decision that I assure you I do not take lightly, but I do stand by my decision.”\n\nCogswell said he is communicating with the chief of police and fire chief to make these decisions.\n\n“I know that this has not been easy, but when this is all over, I strongly encourage all residents to go out and support your local restaurant, your local boutique, and yes-- your local bar. And I hope to have a toast to the long goodbye of Debby,” Cogswell said.\n\nPolice Chief Chito Walker thanked the residents who have listened to the warnings from weather officials and the curfew established by the city.\n\n“We are in a state of emergency, and your adherence to the curfew and enabled us to focus on the critical issues at hand,” Walker said.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Cogswell announced that the curfew put in place Monday night would be extended through 7 a.m. Wednesday morning and urged residents to stay home and stay inside as rain hammered the South Carolina coast.\n\n“Our emergency crews and city staff are working around the clock to keep our residents safe. We owe it to them to stay off of the roads,” Cogswell said. The mayor said there were no rescues overnight and no injuries to city personnel because people did their part and stayed home.\n\nWalker said the curfew is not about unnecessary restrictions but rather about maintaining safety.\n\n“By stepping up and ensuring guidance, we aim to keep everyone safe,” Walker said. “We know it works because the vast majority of the public has adhered to the warnings, and we need all of you to continue to make it work and to keep our city safe.”\n\nStory continues below video...\n\n“The curfew is crucial to keep people off the street to ensure their safety and the safety of our first responders,” Fire Chief Dan Curia said. “We know the curfew worked because our call volume dramatically decreased overnight. We are so thankful for the residents and the staff of the city for adhering to the guidance.”\n\nCity officials said they would reassess the curfew during the 7 a.m. briefing Wednesday.\n\nCogswell said no rescues occurred Monday night while acknowledging that some residents would find the decision frustrating.\n\nStill, city officials said rescue crews were available and prepared for high water and swift water rescues with both police and fire working with increased staffing.\n\nAdditional pumps to deal with the influx of water and National Guard resources were set to arrive Tuesday, Cogswell said.\n\nCogswell announced the curfew Monday night from 11 p.m. with roads leading onto the peninsula being closed. The Charleston Police Department began closing some of those roads around 8 p.m. Monday.\n\nCity officials said main thoroughfares leading into the peninsula will be closed, and police will put up a total of 170 barricades on vulnerable streets. The following roads will be impacted:\n\nFrom Mount Pleasant:\n\nHighway 17 and East Bay Street\n\nHighway 17 and Meeting Street\n\nHighway 17 and Crosstown\n\nFrom Interstate 26:\n\nI-26 and Mount Pleasant Street\n\nI-26 and Rutledge Avenue\n\nI-26 and Crosstown\n\nFrom West Ashley:\n\nSavannah Highway and Lockwood\n\nSavannah Highway and Crosstown\n\nFrom James Island:\n\nSC-30 and Calhoun Street\n\nFrom North Charleston:\n\nMeeting Street Extension\n\nKing Street Extension\n\nCogswell declared a State of Emergency for the city over the weekend ahead of Debby’s arrival because of the possibility of “historic levels of rain” to the area.\n\nThe Citizens Services Desk will operate 24 hours a day starting Tuesday. Residents can call or email with non-emergency questions or requests at 843-724-7311 or citizenservices@charleston-sc.gov. Spanish-speaking services are available through Charleston County Government at 843-746-3909."
