        "text": "There are 18 species of snake found in Michigan and only one of them is venomous.\n\nThe Eastern massasauga rattlesnake is Michigan’s only venomous snake. They are shy and try to avoid humans whenever possible.\n\nMichigan’s largest snake is the gray rat snake, which can grow more than 8 feet long. They are the largest snakes in the Great Lakes region.\n\nI think Michigan’s coolest snake is the Eastern hog-nosed snake. When threatened, this snake will pretend to be a cobra. If that fails, it will actually play dead by rolling onto its back, sticking its tongue out of its mouth and producing a foul smell.\n\nWant to help snakes? Snake fungal disease is an infectious disease found in numerous species of snakes and is caused by the fungus Ophidiomyces ophidiicola. Symptoms include localized thickening or crusting of the skin, ulcerated skin, abnormal bumps under the skin, abnormal molting, opaque cloudiness of the eyes and facial disfiguration.
