        "meta_description": "Wisconsin’s Lost Missionary: the Mystery of Father René Ménard:  The author describes his library research and personal travels as he attempted to determine the exact location where the first French missionary to Wisconsin, Fr. René Ménard (1605-1661), died in 1661.  He first gives an overview of the life of Fr. Ménard and then challenges prior claims about the exact point of “Ménard’s Rapids.” Rejecting the conclusions of Henry Colin Campbell (1862-?) and Louise Phelps Kellogg (1862-1942), he argues that “Ménard’s Falls” were a rapids just below the Dells on the Rib River, near Goodrich, in Taylor County.
