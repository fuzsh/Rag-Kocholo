Anyone observed engaging in this behavior will be immediately removed from the park.\n\nThanks for your understanding and support in keeping Little Island a welcoming space for all visitors.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nFounded in 2021, Little Island is an award-winning public park primarily funded by the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation, located in Hudson River Park. In 2013, Barry Diller, in partnership with Hudson River Park Trust leadership, embarked on the unique opportunity to envision a solution for the repair and reactivation of Pier 54, which had been badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy. The park was designed as an entirely new type of public space for New York, one that would create an immersive experience with nature and art. Born from a collaboration of the UK-based Heatherwick Studio and the New York-based landscape architecture firm MNLA, led by Signe Nielsen, the park’s imaginative design offers all New Yorkers and visitors a public space that is whimsical, captivating and restorative.\n\nBuilt upon 132 concrete ‘Tulip pots’, Little Island features a captivating four-season landscape, meandering pathways and lush lawns. The park also features The Amph, a 700-seat amphitheater; The Glade, an intimate stage for 200 visitors; and The Play Ground, an open plaza and gathering space—all designed to host a range of dance, theater, music, opera, educational programs, food and drinks.\n\nLittle Island is operated by a dedicated team of 50 year-round staff.\n\nLittle Island is located at Pier 55, between 13th and 14th Street in Hudson River Park.\n\nNo, Little Island does not have any dedicated parking areas. The nearest public paid parking garage is located at 450 West 17th St between 9th and 10th Avenues.\n\nLittle Island opened on May 21, 2021. The park was conceived in 2013 and construction began in 2016.\n\nLittle Island sits between the remnants of Pier 54 and Pier 56, the first ports in New York City. In the early 1900s, they were operated by the British Cunard-White Star line where commercial cruises departed and returned, including the voyage that safely returned survivors of the Titanic disaster, and the departure of the RMS Lusitania. From the 1970s to the early 80s, the piers became a safe space for New York City’s growing LGBTQ community to gather. The steel archway at Little Island’s South Bridge entrance remains from the Cunard-White Star building. To discover more about Little Island’s history, click here, or immerse yourself in the history of the iconic Meatpacking District and Hudson River waterfront by listening to Little Island’s History Audio Tour: The Story of Our Pier and Neighborhood Narrated by Tony Award Winner André De Shields.\n\nLittle Island is an initiative of The Diller – von Furstenberg Family Foundation (DVFFF), whose considerable philanthropic history extends to several other New York City parks and arts organizations including The Shed, Signature Theatre, Carnegie Hall Society, and the Central Park Conservancy. The foundation was an early and ongoing supporter of The High Line and Diane von Furstenberg led the fundraising effort for the new Statue of Liberty Museum and the continued beautification of Liberty Island.\n\nThe Diller – von Furstenberg family has been committed to strengthening the communities of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District for many decades and have directly contributed to the long-term development and economic impact of the neighborhood. The creation and operation of Little Island continues this tradition.\n\nVisiting and Using the Park\n\nLittle Island opens at 6:00 am, 365 days a year unless weather conditions dictate otherwise.
