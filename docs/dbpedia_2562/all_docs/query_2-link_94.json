        "text": "In the ski-bum brain, the chance to ski with a magus like Andrew McLean is the equivalent of an invitation for a night on the town with Don Juan. The allure is great, but there’s always a possibility that the excursion will not end well. McLean is a ski mountaineer; he climbs mountains and then skis down them. He is especially fond of skiing chutes—steep, narrow flumes of snow that plunge like elevator shafts through otherwise impassable terrain. Last fall, before he and I met, he’d sent me a copy of “The Chuting Gallery,” his self-published guide to the chutes in his home range, the Wasatch Mountains, which are just east of Salt Lake City. He had inscribed it: “I’m looking forward to skiing with you this winter. If you die skiing one of these, I promise it will be renamed in your honor!” I can’t say that the prospect hadn’t crossed my mind.\n\nMcLean has a bit of a history. One of the runs described in “The Chuting Gallery” is named Roman’s, after McLean’s friend Roman Latta, who, on an outing with him there in 1993, set off an avalanche in which he was buried and killed. Latta was the first of four men who have died while climbing or skiing with McLean. The most famous was Alex Lowe, who was considered by many to be the best mountaineer in the world; Lowe disappeared in a giant avalanche on Shishapangma, in Tibet, in 1999, when he and McLean and others were attempting to become the first Americans to ski a peak higher than eight thousand metres. In all, McLean has lost more than a dozen friends to the mountains—“lost to the mountains” being a locution favored by alpinists, as though skiing or climbing were a sacrificial rite, instead of a voluntary act.\n\nMy family has a bit of history, too. My father’s father, Harald, was a devoted alpinist, as well as a ski racer and jumper who competed for Austria in the 1928 and 1932 Winter Olympics. After the 1932 Games, in Lake Placid, he stayed in America. He briefly held a job at a bank in New York (the story goes that on his lunch breaks he’d head out to Central Park, remove his suit, hang it on a tree, and go running in his underwear) before deciding that the office life was not for him. He moved to New England to teach skiing, which is how he met my grandmother, a Philadelphia society girl who was among the early wave of modish flatlanders to take up the sport under the tutelage of the Austrians. In the summers, my grandfather went on expeditions to the Fairweather Range, in Alaska. He lived in Philadelphia during the war, but afterward he began spending his winters in St. Anton, in Austria, in order to ski. He was killed in an avalanche there in 1952, when my father, the youngest of five children, was six. Twenty years later, one of my father’s sisters died in an avalanche while skiing. She had two children, ages seven and three. Since then, there have been a few other incidents. My father was nearly killed in an avalanche while I was skiing with him, and between us we have witnessed a fair number of slides. There was also a disturbing encounter with a crevasse—a snow bridge gave way, and I fell in. I hung by my arms over a void until two guides pulled me out.\n\nFriends and relatives treat this high incidence of snow trouble as evidence of a family curse, or plain idiocy. The weight of these opinions is such that every time I head out on a trip that involves the kind of skiing that can lead to trouble—glaciers, powder fields, steeps—a certain premonitory queasiness sneaks up on me. The anxiety that comes of tempting fate, especially in pursuit of such an indulgence, helps generate dreams of death by suffocation or falling. But in daylight disquiet gives way to delight, and I find myself doing things that may or may not be dangerous, half aware that at any second my situation, as well as that of my wife and children, could dramatically change. It’s a fraught kind of bliss.\n\nA year and a half ago, I read a story in the magazine Skiing entitled “11 Excuses for not Skiing with Andrew McLean.” One was “He’ll dust you.” Another was “Tragedy dogs him.” Perhaps with that in mind, I found myself, within minutes of meeting McLean, telling him about my family, under the guise of trying to persuade him to take it easy on me. (A more direct approach had failed. “Don’t know what you think you signed up for here, Nick. You’re with the wrong guy.”) He seemed to home in on the infatuation, rather than on its consequences. “Sounds like you’ve got skiing in the blood,” he said. But later, when I passed along the additional piece of information that my great-aunt—my grandfather’s sister—a world-champion racer and fervent mountain girl, had been crippled in the fifties by a runaway ski, he said, “Maybe I should be a little concerned about skiing with you.”\n\nMcLean’s approach to peril is to see humor in it. Certainly, close calls can be comic, and McLean can laugh, in the way of soldiers and crooks, over many of his near-misses. There was the time he cartwheeled down five hundred vertical feet of cliffs, only to land upright on his skis, unaccountably alive and intact, or the time a boulder fell and pulverized itself on a ledge just above his head. Although there isn’t really anything funny about avalanches, his manner of survival, in a few of the half dozen or so that he has been caught in—clinging to the trunk of an aspen tree, high above the ground, or buried upside down, with his legs sticking straight out of the snow—can sound cartoonish. The only thing that spoils the Wile E. Coyote effect (he is forty-three years old, yet he has never so much as broken a bone while skiing) is that a number of his narrow escapes have coincided with the deaths of other people. This is something he doesn’t much like to discuss.\n\nIn “The Chuting Gallery,” McLean inventories the hazards of his favorite routes with a cheek that, in the solemn and superstitious realm of mountain chronicles, borders on blasphemy. In some quarters, it is considered an irresponsible book, as appropriate as a guide to robbing banks. The northeast couloir of a peak called the Pfeifferhorn, McLean writes, is “more fun than running with scissors, sticking paperclips into electrical sockets or taping firecrackers to a cat’s tail.” Of Hellgate Couloir, a run that involves rappelling down two cliffs, he writes, “Short, stout, steep and scary. What more could you ask for?”\n\n“The Chuting Gallery” begins with a disclaimer, from McLean’s mother: “The fact that this is a ‘guidebook’ does not mean that you, the reader, should take it seriously. Obviously, no one in their right mind would ski this stuff—and you shouldn’t either.” By “this stuff,” she means terrain that is challenging enough to fit under the standard definition of extreme skiing, first codified by the American steep-skiing pioneer Chris Landry: “If you fall, you die.” McLean ascends quickly, sometimes with the aid of ropes, ice axes, and crampons. And he descends carefully. He is not a hot dog. What he’s after is an elusive blend of anxiety and exhilaration—a level of difficulty that requires physical and analytical prowess, as well as self-discipline and imagination. He also wants to be first. It’s the adventurer’s injunction: do it before anyone else does, or at least do it differently. His calling takes him to such remote places as Antarctica and the Himalayas. He goes on two big expeditions a year. This month, McLean and three friends are going to Alaska for four weeks in an effort to become the first people ever to ski the Archangel Ridge of Mt. Foraker, a sister peak of Mt. McKinley. It is a gruesome and isolated route, eleven thousand vertical feet—dark, cold, high, scary. It has been climbed only twice before. What’s more, to reach Foraker the group will have to climb up and ski down another difficult peak, in order to avoid sixteen river crossings, not to mention bears.\n\nThere are, of course, many extreme skiers in the world, and many mountain climbers, and quite a few who combine the skills of both. The game has changed since my grandfather’s day. The vogue is to refer to them as “adventure athletes.” They star in films, have sponsorships, and market themselves aggressively, inspiring an ever-growing array of imitators who fan out into the hills and devour fresh terrain, like so many Scrubbing Bubbles. McLean, however, is a true shellback. He is as hungry for accomplishment as the rest, yet he has learned to balance the ragtag joys of wandering the mountains with the requirements of making a living at it. He’d be doing what he’s doing even if nobody was watching. In some respects, he is not an extreme athlete at all but just a lucid and devoted rambler, with high standards and a low pulse—a descendant as much of Kit Carson as of Harry Houdini.\n\nOn my first morning in Utah, I met McLean in a parking lot at the base of Little Cottonwood Canyon, which cuts east into the Wasatch, about a half hour south of Salt Lake City. Little Cottonwood is home to the Snowbird and Alta ski areas and the gateway to a vast array of backcountry terrain. It is known for having the best powder snow in the world.\n\nMcLean has the trim and sinewy build of a Sherpa (he is five feet ten and weighs a hundred and forty-five pounds) and a rubbery, slightly hunched posture, but his bright-blue eyes, bobblehead proportions, and anachronistic helmet of light-brown hair give him an impish appearance. In warmer months, he likes to ride a unicycle on mountain trails. There is relish in his smile; he likes to say, in jest, “It isn’t fun until someone gets hurt,” and he enjoys watching lesser men attempt to keep up with him. He once wrote, “There is nothing finer in life than enjoying a chilled tin of congealed octopus while listening to the moans and groans of fellow human beings . . . as they struggle on a slick 45-degree track.” The sado-stoicism is not bigheaded or bullying; it’s how he conveys to his partners his own particular blend of enthusiasm and forbearance. It is a more garrulous version of the ethic you come across in the classic mountaineering tales of Chris Bonnington, in which the climbers, many of them former British military men, invariably respond to serious trouble—storms, avalanches, broken bones—by brewing up a pot of tea.\n\nMcLean was accompanied by Polly Samuels, his fiancée; they were to be married in two months. Samuels, thirty-five years old and a lawyer in the Utah attorney general’s office, has red hair and an aspect of seriousness. She has become a formidable skier in her own right; last year, she was the North American women’s champion in randonee racing—long slogs up and down mountains in touring gear. (Among the men, McLean usually finishes in the top three or four.) McLean drove. As he navigated the winding road up the canyon, he craned his neck and pointed out some favorite chutes, which coursed through the cliffs on either side like waterfalls. They were avalanche paths, basically, but if you have a taste for such things you begin to view all terrain in terms of what is plausible and you imagine leaving tracks everywhere—on distant peaks or a neighbor’s snowy lawn—much as fishermen cannot regard a body of water without thinking of casting a line.\n\nThat morning, we took it easy: we started at the Alta ski area, where in order to gain altitude we took a chairlift, and to warm up we did two intermediate runs on machine-groomed snow. McLean, an advocate of leg power, doesn’t often consent to such indignities. But after a couple of hours we ventured into more McLeanian terrain—Main Baldy Chute, a long, regal cataract that, being avalanche-prone, is rarely open. It happened also to be the site of his conversion to chuting, fourteen years earlier. The run required a half-hour hike and several dozen compact turns on old chalky snow, the joy deriving, in part, from the sensation of simultaneously resisting and submitting to gravity. McLean’s skiing style was tight and neat, but deliberately functional and in no obvious way vain. At the bottom, McLean called out, “Main Baldy—check!” as though he were planning to have me ski every chute in his book.\n\nWe went to the base of the mountain and retrieved more gear. We were using randonee equipment, which weighs less than standard alpine equipment and is designed for going uphill as well as down. For the ascent, the heel of the binding detaches from the ski, as with a cross-country or telemark ski, and you stick a climbing skin, which is a reusable adhesive strip with mohair or nylon on one side, to the base of each ski (people used to use real seal skins); the grain prevents you from sliding backward. To descend, you peel off the skins and lock down the heel. Each of us wore an avalanche beacon—a transceiver about the size of a Walkman, which sends out a signal in case of burial—and a pack that contained a probe and a shovel, for locating and digging out a buried companion.\n\nWe left Alta and hiked up a ridge for a half hour or so to a place called Wolverine Cirque, an amphitheatre of chutes guarded by cornices. McLean dropped into one called the Scythe. He jumped up and down on a pillow of snow near the top, to see that it was stable, then hopped back and forth down the slope before skirting under an outcropping, in case the next skier, me, set off a slide. I did not. The snow was deep and a little windblown: not bad. After another pitch, the chute opened onto a bowl that looked like a place where you didn’t want to hang around. It was where Roman Latta, among others over the years, had been buried. We crossed a basin, skinned up for forty-five minutes, then skied down to Alta.\n\nBack at my desk five days later, I got an e-mail from McLean: “Utah had its first avalanche fatality the day after you left”—the first, that is, of the season. It had occurred at Wolverine. He sent a photograph of the accident site, with a diagram of our route and the victim’s. They weren’t far apart. “It turns out there was one other fatality, two other people missing, and one person who was buried and dug out.” Also, he said, a place called the Meadow Chutes, where we had spent my last morning, going up and down, rapturously, during a snowstorm, had avalanched—“ripped out wall to wall”—right after we were there.\n\nMy aunt, whose name was Meta Burden, was skiing alone when she died. She had had an argument, so she did a rash thing. She skied into Cristy Gully, which in 1972 lay outside the area boundary at Aspen Mountain. Half a foot of new snow had fallen atop ten inches of two-day-old snow, and apparently there had been a great deal of avalanche activity in the area that morning. But she was a headstrong woman, confident in her abilities. She had lived in Aspen for four years, and was intermittently deranged by anger over the encroachment of more and more people into terrain that she liked to consider her own.\n\nThat evening, her husband reported her missing, and at half past six ski patrollers began a search in the dark. They followed her tracks into Cristy Gully. There is an account of the search in “The Snowy Torrents,” a volume assembled by government avalanche forecasters, with evaluations of avalanche accidents in the United States. The rescuers, it says,\n\nprobed and scuffed in the runout zone, and within 45 minutes they found one ski and one pole. Coleman lanterns were set up at the points where Burden’s tracks ended and where the clues were found. . . . At 2230 hours, Burden was found on the first pass of the probe line 60 feet above her ski and pole. Efforts at resuscitation and heart massage were unsuccessful. Her body was buried in 3 feet of snow.\n\nIt appeared that she had died of suffocation. The report noted that she was an experienced skier, and concluded, “Burden knew the dangers involved and ignored them.”\n\nThe novelist James Salter wrote about my aunt’s death, some years ago, in an essay called “The Skiing Life.” Like many men, he seems to have been somewhat smitten by her. He called her a “goddess.” “There was a woman I knew who used to ski every day, all season long, whatever the weather, whatever the conditions,” he wrote. “Later someone told me that she died on the very same day her father had, years before. I never bothered to confirm it, but I think it must be true; I think it was part of the pact.” It was not true. The pact, though, I could understand.\n\nHer father had died while skiing alone, too. The night before, he had remarked to his sister that he’d witnessed a lot of avalanches that afternoon and that he’d have to be careful. (His family was back home in Philadelphia; he had wanted Meta and her twin sister to cut school and spend the winter with him in Austria, but my grandmother had said no.) Still, the next afternoon, after a day out with a friend, my grandfather decided to take one last run by himself. An avalanche caught him in a gully between the Osthang and the old Kandahar downhill course; when rescuers found his body, they concluded, from the tranquil look on his face, that he had broken his neck.\n\nThis winter, I stumbled on a third account of my aunt’s accident, a 1987 poem called “The Death of Meta Burden in an Avalanche,” by Frederick Seidel. It is a difficult poem, as impenetrable as “The Snowy Torrents” is precise. “You are reborn flying to outski / The first avalanche each spring, / And buried alive.” Seidel, who, it turns out, also met and admired my aunt, seems to imagine what it feels like to be entombed in snow: “I cannot see. / I will not wake though it’s a dream. / I move my head from side to side. / I cannot move.” Later, he writes, “Everything fits my body perfectly now that I’m about to disappear.”\n\nIt is, not surprisingly, a grim way to go. If you trigger an avalanche, there are measures you can take to avoid burial, or at least to improve the odds of surviving. The first thing to do is attempt to ski out of it, although as the slab of snow breaks from the layer beneath it and begins to move, accelerating down the mountain face like a book sliding off a tilted table, it becomes impossible for a skier to generate enough speed or change direction. Within seconds, the slab degenerates into a whirlwind. The snow has astonishing power, and as it rips off your gear and throws you into a tumble you should thrash and swim, in order to stay near the surface. Any attempt to get one good last breath will likely result in a mouthful of snow. Snow crams into your ears and under your eyelids. You may be dashed into a tree or a rock, but the force of the snow alone can break your leg or neck. As the slide slows, you are supposed to cup your hands in front of your mouth to create a pocket of air. Your chances improve if you are head up and face up—and if some part of you is visible to others, if there are others—but this choice is not yours. As the snow comes to a stop, it is like cement. The weight of it can press your last breath out of you, like a python. Your little breathing pocket, if you have one, will soon become carbon dioxide or a block of ice. After five minutes, the odds of survival drop swiftly. You pray that someone digs you out.\n\nEvery year nearly two hundred people are caught in avalanches in the United States. On average, about thirty of them die. The fatality rate has risen steadily since 1991. An increasing percentage of the victims are snowmobilers, who engage in a practice called high-marking, competing to see who can cut a track highest on a steep slope. Still, with improvements in gear and a trend toward backcountry exploration, more and more skiers and snowboarders are venturing out into terrain where survival depends, to a certain degree, on luck.\n\n“Nobody goes out to die,” Jill Fredston, an avalanche specialist in Alaska, told me. “Everyone goes out in pursuit of life. We make a ton of mistakes, but we usually get away with them. Luck is negative reinforcement. And you have probability and complacency working against you.”\n\nLast winter, Mike Elggren, a forty-one-year-old friend of McLean’s, was caught in a slide while backcountry skiing in British Columbia. He was skinning up a slope with ten friends and three guides. At one point, one of the guides decided that she didn’t like where they were. She took two steps, and the whole slope jigsawed above them—a molten acre. Elggren was shoved forward and sucked downhill, head first. His skis pulled him deeper. “I looked up to see where I was, and the lights went out,” Elggren told me. “I got crushed. The pressure was tremendous. As the snow stopped, it made a real squeaky sound.” His hand was in front of his face, but he couldn’t see it. His nose and mouth were choked with snow. He was indignant at first, incredulous that this should happen to him. “That gave way to utter panic. I was screaming. I remember not being embarrassed to be screaming like a little girl. I wanted to flail, but I was pinned.” After a moment, he regained some composure. “My brain wouldn’t allow me to have any hope, the situation was so dire. I was rebreathing my carbon dioxide. My diaphragm and lungs were crushed. And then I started going away. I made my peace with the world. I was sad for the people up top and for my family. I was thinking of my parents and my brother and sisters, and my dog. Then I just went away. It felt like fading into black velvet.”\n\nElggren’s friends, some of whom had been partially buried and had dug themselves out, picked up his beacon signal. They were extraordinarily efficient, taking turns digging, but he was buried head down, six feet deep. When they got to him, ten minutes had passed, and he wasn’t breathing. It took twenty minutes to resuscitate him by mouth-to-mouth. He remembers coming to and wondering why everyone was making such a fuss. They built a sled out of their backpacks, and towed him a mile or so back to a hut, where a helicopter was waiting. Aside from ligament damage to both knees, he seems to be fine. He has gone backcountry skiing regularly this winter (although not with McLean: “Andrew’s on a different plane. He’s so damn badass”). After the accident, Elggren’s mother pleaded with him to give up backcountry skiing, but, he said, “Luckily, she came around to a more rational point of view.” A few weeks ago, he returned to British Columbia to repeat last year’s trip—same guide, same friends, same hut.\n\nOne spring day, when I was eleven, my father and I were skiing off-piste (off the marked trails) in Verbier, Switzerland. The conditions were exquisite but dodgy—a half metre of fresh snow warming in the sun—and my father, realizing abruptly that we were in a place we shouldn’t have been (always this belated moment of recognition), decided that we would traverse, one at a time, to more moderately pitched terrain. I stayed behind on a ridge, as he started across the top of a gully. Then the whole slope seemed to explode, and he disappeared. In those days, I had no experience with avalanches, only a dim sense that they killed Paumgartens, so I failed to keep an eye on him or to take any precautions of my own. Avalanche-safety equipment wasn’t widely used back then; anyway, we didn’t have any. For several minutes, I assumed that he was gone (it seemed fitting that he would be) and sat crying in the snow until I heard him calling my name. I made it down in time to see a snow-splattered ghoul stumbling out of a vast field of debris. The avalanche had carried him a few hundred yards, and then, as it slowed, poured over a bump in the terrain, which caused him to pop up to the surface. The slide was a big one: he was lucky; we were lucky. He was beaten up but all right. When Meta’s twin heard about the accident, she wrote him an angry letter. Except for my father, my mother—whose feelings about all this are rather complicated—and their two sons, the family had quit this kind of skiing. My uncle, for example, tends to ski in bluejeans and stick to marked trails. (“I like the groomed part, the avenues,” he says.) But my father did not give it up, although he did resolve always to hire a guide if he was going to ski off-piste. In the years since, I have been more than happy to accompany him.\n\nSkiing, McLean wrote me once, “is like some form of religious practice or martial arts discipline.” Years of devotion lead to proficiency, which yields a sense of ease and a chance at transcendence. McLean started on the path at Alta; he was born in Salt Lake City. One of his earliest ski memories is of a man breaking his femur on the rope tow at the Alta Lodge. In his recollection, the bone ripped through the man’s pant leg, but he was laughing, because he was drunk. McLean’s father was an ophthalmologist and a devoted sailor, and the family spent several years trying to find a town where he could both practice medicine and get out on the water. Salt Lake was not the place. They moved around for a few years—Vermont, Connecticut, Florida, Haiti—and then settled in Seattle. McLean’s mother taught skiing nearby, at Alpental, in the Cascades. McLean quickly progressed to a point where she had to make a deal with him: she’d buy him a season pass if he promised to ski one run with her a year. He tended to wait until the last day.\n\nAs a kid, McLean was an experimental prankster, a troublemaker of the promising kind. He owned a welding torch and used it both to build go-carts and to fill bread bags with oxyacetylene gas, which he and his younger brother would then place in mailboxes and blow up using fuses made of paper. “We eventually worked our way up to Hefty trash bags, which were deafening,” he recalled. “Come to think of it, that might be a good idea for do-it-yourself backcountry avalanche bombs.” (Explosives are commonly used at ski areas to set off controlled avalanches.)\n\nHe went to the Rhode Island School of Design, where he studied to become an industrial designer. His roommate there happened to be an avid rock climber from Oregon, who began teaching McLean how to climb. Rhode Island is not known for its mountains, but the two of them made the most of the available terrain. On one occasion, they were arrested for trespassing when the police found them dangling from a rope on an abandoned railroad bridge. On another occasion, campus police caught McLean on the roof of the museum (“It had this perfect chimney”) and mistook his bag of climbing chalk for cocaine. While at risd, he fashioned a device that he called the Talon, a three-pronged steel-plated climbing aid, which he eventually sold to Black Diamond, a climbing-equipment company. Six years later, after jobs designing medical equipment and boats, he was hired by Black Diamond, and he moved back to Salt Lake, where the company was based, and began designing technical gear—cams, carabiners, crampons, ice axes. Many of his inventions, including the Talon, are still widely used.\n\nMcLean left Black Diamond a few years ago in order to focus on skiing—a job does get in the way—but he still designs equipment for a number of companies on a freelance basis. When I visited him, he was working on avalanche-safety products and ice-climbing equipment; he was also helping a friend design giant dish antennas for the military. Then there’s the money he gets from speeches and from writing for climbing and skiing magazines. Last year, he worked as an avalanche forecaster for the Forest Service but found the job constricting. His superiors disapproved of steep skiing, and he felt called upon to preach a gospel of caution that he did not wholeheartedly subscribe to. Now he pursues what he calls a “low-cost life style.” He said, “I haven’t heard of any other professional ski mountaineers.”\n\nBlack Diamond, in the early nineties, was a breeding ground for amateur ski mountaineers, foremost among them Alex Lowe. It was Lowe who introduced McLean to a mode of skiing that employed the tools and techniques of climbing, as European alpinists had been doing for decades. “More than anyone, he opened my eyes to what was possible on skis,” McLean said. Their first outing together was to Main Baldy Chute, before Alta opened for the year. They started out at 5 a.m. and descended at dawn, in thigh-deep powder. When they were done, they were set upon by ski patrolmen on snowmobiles, who informed them that the patrol was bombing the chute that morning, to make it slide, and that Lowe and Mclean were lucky not to have been blown to pieces by a Howitzer shell. McLean was hooked.\n\nIn a foreword to “The Chuting Gallery,” Lowe describes “a loose group of twisted individuals” who several days a week would convene in his kitchen at three in the morning and, to his wife’s dismay (“Is this normal!!?”), head off to climb a chute or a peak, then ski down at sunrise and go to work, glowing with accomplishment and stinking of sweat. This regimen, which McLean still adheres to (minus the going-to-work part), was known as dawn patrol.\n\n“You could always spot another chute or two in the distance that needed to be skied,” McLean said. “I kept at it for a few years, thinking that I had almost ticked them all off, before realizing that there was no end to them. Some were bigger, steeper, or more classic than others, but there were hundreds of them in the Wasatch and then a few million more around the world.”\n\n“The skiing consumed us,” Mark Holbrook, a former Black Diamond engineer, told me. “That maybe led to our divorces.” (McLean’s first marriage, to a graphic designer from Long Island whom he met at risd, ended eight years ago.)\n\nMcLean would like, on his deathbed, to be able to look at a globe and know that he had been everywhere. “It’s getting harder and harder to find big classic lines that haven’t been skied,” he said. “They’re a precious commodity.” The conquest game can get competitive. Exotic places—the Kamchatka peninsula or Ellesmere Island—catch on, and the athletes pour in. It is difficult to stay ahead of the Scrubbing Bubbles. Sometimes a team spends years planning an expedition to an obscure peak, only to find another team there upon arrival. When I was in Utah, McLean said that he and a nineteen-year-old acolyte named Dylan Freed had recently found a chute in the Wasatch that had never been skied. They had christened it Project Schnozzle. He revealed the location to no one, not even to Polly Samuels. “It takes four hours to get there, and it’s only five hundred feet of vertical,” he said. “You’ve got to really want it.” Last month, McLean went and did it by himself. “The Schnozzle has fallen,” he wrote me.\n\nIn 2002, McLean and a Black Diamond sales rep named Brad Barlage journeyed to Baffin Island, west of Greenland, on a hunch that there were chutes there. McLean had built giant kites, based on a Dutch modification of nasa technology (he’d come across some kiting Dutchmen in Antarctica). McLean and Barlage used the kites to sail across the frozen fjords—at speeds of up to forty miles an hour, on skis, towing gear-laden sleds. They discovered soaring chutes everywhere. McLean told me, “We ticked off nineteen first descents, of which ten were the best lines I’ve ever been in—three-thousand-to-five-thousand-foot screamers that came straight out of the frozen sea ice, surrounded by monstrous walls, stable creamy powder, wolf tracks, twenty-four hours of daylight, and surreal scenery.” The skiing magazines took note, and the athletes poured into Baffin.\n\nOn a trip like that one, the salient requirements, besides being first and having fun, are imagination and ingenuity, as opposed purely to danger and death-defiance. McLean has learned, he told me, that “fatalities are always a good way to ruin a trip.” Holbrook said, “We’ve toned things down a little. That’s a good thing for him, with the problems we’ve had in the past, with the deaths.”\n\nClearly, the deaths have weighed on McLean. “You go to a funeral,” he told me. “You know these people as ski buddies, and you see they have moms and dads and fiancées. It gives it all a human face.” And it can give him pause. Thus the toning down. “I’m more conservative, in terms of risking big falls. No more cliff hucking”—skiing off cliffs. “I give avalanches a lot more leeway than I used to,” he said. “On the other hand, each thing you ski tends to be a little bit harder. The ambitions keep getting bigger. Foraker may be as hard as anything I’ve ever done.”\n\nOn my second morning in Utah, I met McLean in the Little Cottonwood parking lot. He had his pickup truck, on which he had rearranged the lettering of “Toyota” to read “Otto,” in honor of his late Bernese mountain dog. He was accompanied by Dylan Freed. McLean had considered taking Freed on the Alaska trip to climb Mt. Foraker, but Freed’s uncle, Mark Twight, one of the world’s top mountaineers, told McLean, “If anything happens to him and you survive, I’ll hunt you down and kill you.” (“This kind of raises the question as to why people would get their kids into skiing and the mountains in the first place if they really wanted them to be safe,” McLean told me. “Darts might be a better activity.”)\n\nOn the way up the canyon, we picked up another friend, Lorne Glick, an accomplished ski mountaineer. Glick lives in a sparsely furnished room (ice axes, topographical maps, banjo) inside a small hydroelectric plant just off the Little Cottonwood road. The generators outside the room roar day and night. For money, Glick occasionally drives a Sno-Cat at Alta or works as a guide, and recently, at the age of forty-one, he got a license to be a helicopter pilot.\n\nOur plan was to hike up Mt. Superior, a peak rising three thousand feet above Little Cottonwood Canyon, and ski down the south face, which, viewed from Alta and Snowbird, seemed to be a sheer white wall, studded with cliffs. On earlier trips, I had occasionally seen tracks etched on it and been half glad that they weren’t mine. “With slides that cover the road 10-20’ deep, Superior should be treated with the utmost respect,” McLean writes in “The Chuting Gallery.” “Because of the road below, keep in mind that you are endangering others by attempting to ski it in less than ideal conditions.” On this particular day, conditions were close to ideal—four inches or so of fresh snow atop a firm, older layer. I decided not to worry about endangering others.\n\nThe trail began at Alta, behind the Our Lady of the Snows chapel, an avalanche-proof box of reinforced concrete and plate glass that was built in 1993, ten years after the original chapel, made of wood, was destroyed by a slide. McLean handed me a pair of Whippet Self-Arrest poles, which he designed. They are regular ski poles with a steel ice-axe blade fixed to each handle. You appear to be skiing with two stubby handsaws. In the event of a fall on a steep slope, you jab the blades into the snow to stop yourself from sliding. The climb was gradual at first, but it took just three minutes for me to fall well behind. The track was slick. My technique was poor. The air was thin. I huffed my way uphill, doing my best to look around and remind myself that there was no place I’d rather be. The panorama was dazzling in the morning light, like the inside of a diamond; unbroken fields of snow stretched in all directions.\n\nAfter an hour or so, I rejoined the others at Cardiff Pass, and we started up Superior. Here the skinning got more technical: a winding trail through the trees requiring awkward maneuvers. Again, I lagged; after a while, McLean skied back down to check on me—humbling enough, though he seemed glad for the exercise. After another hour, it was time to remove the skis, strap them to our packs, and start climbing up a narrow ridge leading to the summit. The trail was variable; stretches of thigh-deep drifted snow gave way to wind-cleared rock. Occasionally, there was climbing to do, on all fours; the Whippet blades helped me gain purchase. On my left, there were cliffs, and, on the right, snow-loaded chutes. In places, it was clear that a fall to either side would be highly problematic. The wind had kicked up, and through breaks in a cloud that seemed to have come out of nowhere I got vertiginous glimpses of the valley floor.\n\nMcLean, by this point, was waiting for me at the top of each pitch, to make sure that I was all right and to take some delight in the extent to which I wasn’t. “You’re still smiling,” he’d say, to my grimace. After one stretch, when I crawled up onto a narrow shelf and collapsed at his feet, he said, “Nick, does your wife know you’re doing this?”\n\nAnd then we were on top, the slope below us dropping off into a foggy void. Freed and Glick were long gone. They had decided to ski the north side, which looked bright, powdery, and benign. We bundled up, drank water, ate chocolate, and prepared for the ski down. “There’s more snow up here than I thought,” McLean said. “I think we’ll do the chute on the left. Wait up here until I call up to you.” He dropped in, traversing back and forth a few times to test the snow—ski cutting, it’s called—and then making a series of blocky turns, his wide stance and cautious pace indicating to me that this was no place to make a mistake. And then he disappeared.\n\nI waited awhile in the wind but couldn’t hear a thing. Bits of cloud blew past. Rock, cornice, cloud. Probability, complacency, luck. I decided not to wait any longer. I hopped into the wind-whipped snow on the upper face, then chopped my way into a steep, icy trough, intermittently jump-turning and side-slipping, chunks of snow and ice clattering around me like broken glass. When I found McLean, he was hiding behind a rock, a big grin on his face. “Isn’t this great?” he said. It was. The pitch eased, and we were making turn after turn in powder. After a while, McLean stopped and pointed up at a steep east-facing shaft. “That’s Suicide,” he said. He wondered whether I had enough left for one more. The answer, that morning, was no.\n\nDawn patrol: I met McLean and Brad Barlage in the parking lot at 5 a.m. the following day. We drove up to the White Pine trailhead, donned headlamps, and started skinning up through the woods, a damp malevolent wind howling in the aspen trees. McLean had mercifully assented to a compromise: instead of going all the way up to White Pine, we’d climb for an hour to Pink Pine. The name suggested achievability. We reached the top before first light. Snow had started to fall, spinning in the beams of our headlamps. We skied a run in the trees in darkness—a curious experience. Not feeling right, I continued down alone, while they went up for more.\n\nThat evening, I had dinner with McLean and Samuels. They live at the top of a rise in a modest development outside Park City, on the east slope of the Wasatch, giving them a view through fir trees of the Uinta Mountains. The house is compact but spacious—three stories. McLean poured two glasses of Scotch and showed me around. The ground floor is dominated by his workshop. It contains twenty-three pairs of skis, as well as climbing skins, boots, bicycles, unicycles, and various heavy mechanical saws and drills. In a closet, neatly arranged, were twenty ice axes and an assortment of helmets and backpacks. Shovels, carabiners, headlamps. Next to the workshop is a sewing room, where he assembles his giant kites. Upstairs, he has an office full of maps and adventure books. He reads a lot; on expeditions, when the weather goes bad, he said, “you end up tearing paperbacks into chapters and passing them around to be read out of order.”\n\nWhen Samuels returned home from work, I remarked upon the neatness of the place. “Did you expect him to be living in some cave?” she asked. She and McLean met in the Little Cottonwood parking lot, when he made a comment about a bumper sticker on her car for a ski-mountaineering mecca in France called La Grave. She loves skiing and understands that he does, too, and so she tolerates the long absences, as well as the risks, though when he talks about them—when, for example, he enumerated some of the obstacles on Mt. Foraker—she laid a hand on his leg, as if to keep him near.\n\nFor dinner, McLean made cheese fondue. As he cooked, he talked about some of his avalanche encounters over the years. He told the one about being out on avalanche patrol for the Forest Service, early in the season, and getting caught in a slow slide on a seemingly harmless pitch that buried him head down, so that he couldn’t move or breathe. There were incidents in which he was buried up to the waist or thrown up against a tree. “I’m having second thoughts about skiing, suddenly,” McLean said, laying the fondue pot on the table.\n\n“I’ve never heard these stories,” Samuels said.\n\n“You haven’t?”\n\n“I guess I never asked.”\n\nThe more you learn about snow, the clearer it becomes that skiing—in the backcountry, on glaciers, in deep snow, on extreme steeps—is more dangerous than most people who regularly do it acknowledge. The capriciousness of the snow is hard to figure. And, whether it’s because of hubris or probability, the victims tend to be those who know their way around the mountains, or believe they do.\n\n“Many people think that the way they do it is safe but that the way others do it isn’t,” McLean told me. “The only truly safe way of doing it is to stop doing it, which I don’t want to do.” McLean is not superstitious; he doesn’t believe that this frank assessment inoculates him against trouble. But it does enable him to evaluate the risks more soberly. For all his seeming recklessness, he is a compulsive planner and a meticulous performer—a mountain scientist. He admits to having “nighttime fears” and “trip anxiety,” but in the end such sensations manifest themselves in preparation and a fixation on gear. (Carabiners “are all about semi-intangible subtleties.”) And, where acumen comes up short, he resorts, as most mountain men do, to a kind of fatalism. “I often torment myself with a theoretical question,” he said. “What if you knew how and when you were going to die? If it was an avalanche or falling to your death, then you’d have to keep skiing, as you’ve already seen the end. If it was in your sleep at a ripe old age, then you’d have to keep skiing as well, since you’d know you were safe. The end result is the same: keep making turns.” He does have his limits: a few years ago, he took up parapenting—jumping off mountains with a parachute—and decided it was too dangerous.\n\nWhat suits McLean may not suit others. “People get in trouble trying to be their hero,” Bruce Tremper, the director of the Forest Service’s avalanche center in Utah, told me. “People got hurt or killed trying to be Alex Lowe. Andrew McLean has taken over that mantle. A lot of people are trying to be Andrew McLean now, and they’re getting hurt or killed, because they don’t have his talent or experience. Life gives us cheap lessons sometimes.”\n\nMcLean and Samuels’s wedding was held in February at Our Lady of the Snows and presided over by Lou Dawson, a pioneer of North American ski mountaineering and a longtime mentor to McLean. He had managed to get an ordination over the Internet for the occasion. (Dawson, it turns out, knew my aunt Meta, and he himself barely survived a big avalanche behind Aspen Highlands, in 1982.) Many congregants were wearing touring boots and ski clothes. One friend had skinned over from Big Cottonwood Canyon with a tuxedo rolled in his pack. The skiers, bright-eyed, shaggy, ruddy, and lean, stood out among the many guests who had come from New York. They made me think of my grandfather and his fellow-Skilehrers, surrounded by Ivy League boys and débutantes. Samuels was brought up in Manhattan; she went to Brearley and Penn; her father, a prominent tax attorney, served as an assistant Treasury secretary in the Clinton Administration, and her mother is a residential real-estate broker. Eager to partake of the mountain life, Samuels moved out to Salt Lake City in 2000 and insinuated herself into the area’s clique of élite outdoorsmen and women by undertaking feats of courage and endurance. (In a toast at the wedding, one of these women said, “We think you have earned the right to marry the icon of the Wasatch.”) Also present was Polly’s older brother, Colin, who has himself become an avid backcountry skier and climber. He lives in La Grave. Two years ago, his fiancée was killed when she fell down a slope in Norway into a frozen hole. “Polly’s parents don’t understand it,” McLean said. “Colin has moved to one of the centers of alpinism, and Polly is marrying an alpine geek. They’re probably not thrilled by it.”\n\nMcLean and Samuels left the church under an arch of ski poles held aloft by their guests, then put on boots and skis so that they could ski a celebratory run in wedding attire. They took a chairlift, his morning coat and her wedding dress apparently triggering another exemption to the leg-power rule. Afterward, they joined the reception, at a big hotel at Snowbird. The mountain men were scattered about, stooping to stay clear of the potted palms. Bob Athey, the saltiest of them all, sat by the door in his ski gear. He had a rusty beard and a grand frizz of hair, and he smelled of tobacco and sweat. From the way people lined up to talk to him, it was clear that he had not been observed indoors in some time. (“Bob, I haven’t seen you since we scattered Alan’s ashes,” one woman said.) Athey told me, “I figure I got another twenty years of this, before I die in an avalanche.”\n\nMcLean sidled up. The morning coat looked big on him, as though he were a boy in a man’s suit. He had a fixed smile that thinly disguised a groom’s simmering embarrassment. “So, Bob, how was the skiing today?”\n\n“It was great.”\n\n“Where did you go?”\n\nAthey mentioned some backcountry spots.\n\n“How was the snow?”\n\n“Crusty.”\n\nMcLean nodded and looked thoughtful for a moment, before his father-in-law came by to suggest that he start herding the guests in to dinner.\n\nAfter dinner and a short slate of toasts (“And that’s how my brother ended up in the position he’s in now, with . . . no job!”), it was time for “Hava Nagila.” Samuels and McLean were hoisted up and borne onto the dance floor. This being Utah, a good portion of the people holding the bride and groom aloft did not have a great deal of experience with this particular number, and it was hard not to notice, as the tempo sped up and McLean, lurching to and fro, gripped the sides of his chair, that the expression on his face contained an unfamiliar ingredient that you might call worry.\n\nTwenty-four hours after the wedding, I talked to McLean on the phone. I was at Alta, he was at home. (The honeymoon, a trip with friends to a backcountry lodge in British Columbia, would come a few weeks later.) McLean invited me to accompany him and his new brother-in-law on an outing the next morning to the Y Couloir, a three-thousand-foot chute that you walk up in your boots, with crampons and an ice axe. (“The Chuting Gallery”: “You will be exposed to avalanche hazards 100 per cent of the time and getting caught in even a minor slide here could be fatal.”) I recalled that earlier in the winter McLean had told me that the only expeditions he has ever regretted were the ones he pulled out of: “Whenever I get invited on a trip, I remember a fortune cookie that said, ‘Practice saying yes.’ ” To the Y Couloir invitation, however, I said something about not having the gear and having a plane to catch. McLean told me he had gear for me, and that we’d make it down by noon. “Come on, Nick. You’ll love it!” I hung up and talked it over with my wife, with whom I was supposed to ski the following day. The consensus was that the answer should be no. I called McLean back. I told him that it was snowing at Alta, and he remarked that, if more than four or five inches accumulated, the Y Couloir would be too dangerous to ski. Later that evening, I stepped outside and noted, with more than the usual elation, that six inches had fallen. And it was still dumping. I called McLean and gave him my report; the Y Couloir would have to wait.\n\nThe next day was a powder day. At Alta, the Scrubbing Bubbles were out in force, devouring the new snow in less than an hour. Riding up the chairlift, I looked back hungrily across the canyon, at the vast untracked south face of Superior, and then followed the ridgeline east, until I saw a lone figure ascending a pristine snowfield. The skin track looked steep, the pace brisk. Ten minutes later, I saw the figure, a tiny speck, reach a peak called Flagstaff. My cell phone rang, and it was McLean, calling from the top to gloat. “Are you lonely?” I asked him.\n\n“It is really good, Nick,” he said. “And I have it all to myself.” After a moment, he dropped off the backside, out of sight. ♦"
