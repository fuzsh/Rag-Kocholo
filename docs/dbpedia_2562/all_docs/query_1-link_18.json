        "text": "Hello\n\nI may have been at this subject before. I need to cut my water level along the BIG circle but simply cant. I obtained it by “intersect with model” of my rather large building.\n\nI can’t have the water show through the building!\n\nBecause when I want to chose the face/space within the circle I can’t select it at all.\n\nOk there were columns and glass walls all around.\n\nI erased it all one by one. I can cut a small circle around my tiny cross lines that tell me where\n\nthe center is.\n\nI have cleaned out I HOPE 100% of anything that was left of any kind of many an edges.\n\nStill I can’t delete the big water circle.\n\nI can do any other circle within it …but that won’t help me. I have tried to cut out like a pizza in half and sliced NOTHING will divide the space from the entire lake surface.\n\nI just remain baffled of how stupid this makes me feel after so many years on SKU.\n\nIgnore any shapes/ line at the bottom of this water 7m deep it’s like a pool/lake\n\nI have these bi city panoramas around the lake. They are imported the wall is 100% vertical\n\nfrom a pulled up square and still when I export to Lumion10 parts of the pic disappear\n\nnow at a late stage before I never had an issue. But the file seems to be like possessed\n\nby dividing the picture into triangles across the while width. Sometimes two or more so I select all of them and make the picture into group, Never had that issues before trying to divide the model\n\nTo make sure it’s vertical I slide up the screen along 4 square columns at the corner and give the picture back glass and then another wall of glass 10 cm away\n\nI have made this a separate file, like a darkroom to import again with the water\n\nas my water that never was an issue since day one showed these huge sways of\n\nblack shadows in the rendering. Although I have no waves, the water has always been\n\nclear pool water as flat as possible even in the render.\n\nI have been blocked now for over a month. I have a new PC with 128GB of RAM but the same graphic card.\n\nThis resolved the issue on stalling with a “mip error” but since then my file import\n\nin FBX ended up disastrous. Always some panorama missing, many wrong materials,\n\none time metal just like leaked across about many glass materials in the entire game building\n\nI keep going back and forth.\n\nDividing, re-importing, reassembling takes so muc time and only then at the end I always to find something off odd or missing that looked perfect in SKU… Lately like a miracle the side walks of parts of my streets above turned transparent\n\nletting the day light into the underground what I do not want.\n\nSo I switched back to COLLADA format but still get mistakes.\n\nIt’s been a month from hell on how to get my file to display for render and movies as well as it did before I always ended up ecstatic especially about the Lumion10 water outcome now its a big\n\nissue that I actually want to import the water only separately but for that is need to slide around the building and not flood the center .\n\nSo now I separated ALL actors people, plants and the volume cut our of the land\n\nwith the hope to import the building naked from all what slows down a file to load like (700 people + cars trees rocks fountains\n\nBut to export to UE 54 I need FBX files I started to import FBX into UE and gosh knows where\n\nthey stand up vertical and won’t let me select them to rotate them parallel to the ground\n\nand I did NO click on triangulate all files and did NO check “FORCE X to the front”\n\nThe only time (the first time) I managed to import horizontal to unite floor and square I would not let me chose the two items and move them into position it’s like they were poison to my mouse? Can[t get the gyzmo or pivot to make the actors move accordingly.\n\nThank you so much to the good souls who understand the frustration of being alone in front of a project and no one to talk to. Merci, Muchas Gracias always gratfull\n\nI am really VERY bad at the hardware. My SO installed it all I just want to know anyone\n\nwould a better graphic card help my bizarre issues.\n\nBefore I only have loading issues with this PC SKU19 seems to have issues\n\nexporting\n\nthe files as they are? Could it be the GPU?\n\nBut I don’t know will another Graphic card fit this PC we are on a serious budget!\n\nThank you very much… for not “telling me off”\n\nI will try once more to extrapolate my water square.\n\nI am just so scared not to be able to reset it 100% exact into position.\n\nYou are so lucky to have a live connection to the render.\n\nWith SKU19 (that I keep due to budget) I can’t get the “Datasmith live bridge”\n\nto work with UE therefor I can’t just make all show up in there.\n\nThat would be a dream, but I need to get into UE for the final target\n\nto make it into a VR game on Steam. ( one can have a dream ?\n\nI have test walked some areas already\n\nI the moment my model is already like a the main cabinet\n\nwith the water area and surrounding frame that holds it pulled out like a drawer\n\nnow I will pull out part of the drawer.\n\nDo you recommend my water to have a thickness?\n\nMy water is only once face to which I apply water material top and bottom.\n\nI so appreciate you not sending me grazing (like we say in French)\n\nThank you so much\n\nI never had issues with water. In the center of the circle I actually have another water body.\n\nthat holds a promenade around it and a tropical aquarium with simulated corals elevator\n\nand swimming fish.\n\nIt’s all super complicated to divide.\n\nYes the “intersect” left a army of edges of the support structures. I thought I have cleaned up most if not all.\n\nDoes the circle have to be totally void 100% of any of these possible tiny remnants?\n\nI try to keep the center point at least with a tiny circle to recreate the big one again.\n\nThat worked for most of the small circles.\n\nIf you look at the 8 smaller circles to the right I had no issues but with the one at 9pm position\n\nalthough three others had exact the same layout left over.\n\nThey are the intersections of a the engine of a ROCKET standing in the lake.1\n\nIt’s so nice to always being helped by helpers like yourself.\n\nThank you again. I really appreciate it.\n\nRegards\n\nVic\n\nThank you for taking the time to write your advise.\n\nI have posted many times here and always got help. Sorry for the lengthy post I just get carried away late a night. I have several people who did help me resolving several issues at the same time I am very confident about the support of this Forum for many years\n\nI guess you may see that I do quite OK with SU for decades (but I stay with SU19)\n\nIt depends what and how one works. I worked as professional interiors and fashion designer for over 30 years then 17 years ago I fell in love with 3D. I create as I go like a painting.\n\nAnd yes, I here I got here several slaps on my mouse for having a model that is nearly 2GB. haha. But I can’t go back and planning things I didn’t know I was going to create.\n\nCurrently I am working on, dismantling my as advised, it into more easier manageable parts because SK19 and UE does not work with the live “Datasmith” to migrate to UE.\n\n(A very steep learning curve)\n\nDuring this process I hit roadblocks that I are just tricky as this circle problem that won’t open as I need it to.\n\n“Nesting” I will try to read about it\n\nI am in this active plane I just wonder why for example the y circles to the right were easy to delete of water and the one at “9pm” positions would not although others looked exact the same\n\nThere isn’t much that stops me but there are sometimes these situations that arise that’s when I ask for help.\n\nI NEED to work/ learn UE because my building need to become a space for a game. It’s a simple as that. If I had known years ago what I was going to do now I would have started with UE at that time.\n\nI never had water issues before as I explained. I have designed many landscapes and pools (actually one of my favorite subjects) but I never had to cut a huge hole into my water surface.\n\nHere is just one finished example of loads of pools ponds and water that I entered into an international design contest for “render of non build projects” just for my satisfaction as it was my Covid project.\n\nMy model is way to big to upload here and I have been working on it for two + years to create a VR game. I test walked with VR VIVE many areas already.\n\nI simply just can’t give away my model for anyone to take it.\n\n(It’s my baby destined for a potential Steam release)\n\nOK I am not the youngest and have ADHD (under med control), but the older I get sometimes I just loose the north. That’s when I come cry for help.\n\nThank you again cheers\n\nVic\n\nPS: Very nice backyard and deck designs!\n\nYou may be interested to look at\n\n#polycam https://poly.cam/\n\nA very affordable 3D scanning app for phones so you can scan the existing structures with your phone and import to your computer to work with.\n\nIt works very nicely with hard structures, foliage etc\n\nYou are welcome and I’m glad you were able to figure it out.\n\nThanks for the tips on scanning and also happy you like my deck design.\n\nRegarding your initial problem, I’m guessing there may have either been hidden geometry, lines out of plane, or lines not connecting leaving open loops due to the intersect command not executing properly, preventing you from modeling things the way you wanted.\n\nI’ve noticed the intersect command does not do well with highly oblique angled faces as well as small detailed geometry which many times does not create a clean intersections forcing me to clean things up manually, or as I mentioned, just modeling the result directly without using the intersect command.\n\nOne trick that might help in the future, is to scale up the geometry 100x… do the intersection and then scale back down 0.01x. I noticed this trick also helps with small objects with circles and arcs, where SketchUp claims the geometry is too small to draw the arc or circle in the first place with the number of segments selected. This trick also works with components, where you can have the small component placed correctly, and then off to the side, you have the same component scaled up 10x or 100x, where you can do whatever you need to do to it, which updates the correctly scaled smaller version of the component without any problems.\n\nGood luck with your Steam project. It looks pretty cool overall.\n\nHello.\n\nThank you for your concern, very kind of you.\n\nMy game is NOT based on speed at all. There will be no shooting no killing\n\nIt’s a very intricate world for guest/gamers to move about to find and meet in special ways.\n\nloads of tight spaces stairs elevators etc.\n\nI can fly through it in SketchUP no problem what so ever at the roll of my wheel mouse\n\nI can dive in around and out and above also in Lumion the render.\n\nI only encounter major problems with the FBX files\n\nchanging/switching or omitting x faces\n\nI only can get it to UE as FBX even divided in pieces\n\nI just don’t know why the arrive with the XYZ being horizontal\n\nand I can’t move, rotate they are like frozen at arrival\n\nI never ever had or look or save my model in that position. NEVER EVER\n\nand I have NOT forced the Y forward in the FBX options.\n\nMy Lumion only gets slower with all the people, cars, plants, trees and\n\nmany custom graphics\n\nBut I do have a clean version with no props and actors as at the end\n\nthe gamers are supposed to fill the space\n\nHere is my items slowing down the Lumion but they are NOT inside SketchUP\n\nThank you very much"
