        "text": "Prior to 2015, aircraft used ground-based radar navigation for the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) established air traffic routes and published procedures. Technological limitations, mainly the lack of precision required to separate and direct aircraft traffic, resulted in multitudes of flight paths in the sky. Today these paths have become one-lane highways. That’s because to increase airspace capacity, reduce delays, and improve safety, the FAA modernized Bay Area flight routes using satellite-based navigation. This made the routes more precise and therefore, more concentrated. This overhaul of flight patterns is referred to as the Northern California Metroplex, which is part of the FAA’s Next Generation air traffic system called NextGen. People who live in neighborhoods under these major flight routes have experienced an increase in air traffic since 2015. That means more noise.\n\nView our major aircraft routes\n\nSFO is a committed partner in reducing airport noise. Learn more about our Noise Action Plan at Making SFO Quieter.\n\nThe ideal situation is for all pilots to adhere to published flight procedures but this doesn't always happen due to inclement weather, runway usage, type of aircraft, number of aircraft, engine performance characteristics, relative distance from the airport, and pilot discretion. Ultimately, the FAA or Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel has sole authority and responsibility for routing aircraft throughout the National Airspace System. ATC's top priorities are always safety and efficiency.\n\nThe Bay Area’s airspace is relatively small and congested. Remember that SFO shares its airspace with two other major airports, Oakland International Airport (OAK) and San Jose International Airport (SJC), so there's a chance that the plane over your home is traveling to or from another airport. We also share our skies with military aircraft, planes from smaller local airports, and helicopter traffic associated with air medical services or news media events. In SFO's airspace, there could be domestic and international long-haul flights traveling at very high altitudes. You can investigate a specific flight, on our Flight Noise Tracker.\n\nNo. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) designs air travel routes and procedures and determines aircraft movement in the air and on the ground. SFO is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco, in service to our communities; we hold leases with tenants including airlines, concessions, and airport-related businesses. From a noise abatement perspective, this means that SFO can regulate activities such as airlines’ engine maintenance run-ups by controlling where they take place and instituting certain restrictions at night. We advocate for specific flight paths to reduce noise, but these must be approved by the FAA. We also actively encourage the FAA and Congress to provide noise mitigation funds, and to create and enforce stricter noise abatement standards for aircraft manufacturers. In April 2020, the Noise Office launched its Noise Action Plan, a five-year strategy to help curb aircraft noise exposure in the community. In this document, our team delves deeper into the question of when and where flights are allowed to operate. While SFO does not have the regulatory authority to issue fines to airlines, we do offer incentives to airlines who fly during daylight hours as opposed to nighttime. We also install and oversee a broad system of noise monitors throughout the Peninsula in order to understand aircraft noise levels, trends, and changes.\n\nLearn more about our Noise Action Plan.\n\nYes, SFO was the first airport in the United States to establish a Noise Insulation Program, which provides partial soundproofing to Bay Area homes, schools, libraries, and places of worship that are exposed to high levels of aircraft noise. Each year, SFO allots $1 million of its own funding to install double pane/high-performance glazed windows, doors, and ventilation systems to eligible properties located inside SFO’s noise contour. The noise contour is an area shown on a noise exposure map where the average daily aircraft noise level is equal to or greater than 65 decibels (CNEL Community Noise Equivalent Level) as designated by the FAA. Together, SFO and the FAA have funded the program since 1983, spending more than $192 million to insulate over 15,200 buildings.\n\nLearn more about our Noise Insulation Program\n\nSFO also advocates for aircraft to fly over water rather than land at night. Fewer than two dozen flights happen between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. which tend to be cargo flights. We are currently exploring ways to alleviate this issue in our Noise Action Plan. SFO is the seventh-largest airport in the U.S. by passenger volume and the 23rd largest by cargo tonnage.\n\nWe’ve developed voluntary preferred nighttime aircraft procedures in collaboration with the FAA, airlines, and community representatives so that pilots avoid populated residential areas and fly instead over the San Francisco Bay.\n\nOnce you submit your application, our Team will confirm that your property falls within the program’s noise contour. If your property is within the contour and eligible, you will be assigned a priority number. Applications are reviewed on a first-come, first-serve basis. Our Team will notify you when your priority number is being addressed.\n\nParticipating houses are grouped and treated in cycles. Depending on your assigned initiative, it may take 12-18 months for our Team to process your application, confirm your eligibility, conduct a home inspection, and prepare for construction. Once started, actual construction will take approximately 10-15 calendar days.\n\nLearn more about our Noise Insulation Program to see if your property is eligible and better understand the processes for the two initiatives under the Noise Insulation Program: the Second Chance Initiative and the Replacement Initiative.\n\nWe understand your concerns. After the implementation of NextGen’s Metroplex in 2015, the Noise Office experienced an exponential rise in the number of complaints regarding aircraft noise. We’re constantly trying to brainstorm news ways to help reduce noise exposure in the communities that we serve. Whether it’s bolstering our relationship with the FAA to examine which flight paths we can shift to fly over water rather than land, or how to incentivize airlines to avoid flying at nighttime, we are trying. In the past, we worked with governmental agencies to keep the area along the shoreline north of the airport slated as an industrial zone. This way, fewer people will experience quality of life issues associated with living under a flight path. We installed our first noise monitoring system in 1975 and now oversee 37 permanent and portable monitors strategically placed throughout the Bay Area. These monitors enable us to track trends in noise exposure levels and validate the 65 decibel noise impact contour which, in turn, allows us access to FAA funding for sound insulation initiatives.\n\nPerspective: Back in 1976, more than 35,000 people lived within SFO’s high noise impact boundary or 65 decibel CNEL contour. Today despite population and airport operations growth, statistics show that the number of people impacted within the noise contour in 2014 fell to 11,294 and impacted acreage to 7,063.\n\nThe airport is now quieter than it was prior to the mid 1970s. Why? Mainly because of improvements in the way airplanes were made. The federal government required airplane fleets to transition to newer generation aircraft that produce significantly less noise. Most of the gains from quieter aircraft were achieved by 2000. As an industry leader, SFO took the initiative and formed its own program to phase out older and louder aircraft. SFO’s Noise Insulation Program has also been groundbreaking; reducing aircraft noise in more than 15,200 homes, schools, libraries, and places of worship.\n\nView Aircraft Effective Perceived Noise in Decibels\n\nSource: Federal Aviation Administration, Aircraft Noise Issues.\n\nSubmit a Noise Report. Yes, it does make a difference! The information we gather from noise monitors and computer models are just a couple of ways for us to see aircraft noise exposure levels in the community. But noise is subjective. What annoys one person, may not phase another. So, we do need your input. By tracking the number of reports by location, date, and time, we can better understand patterns and trends. This way, we can see what areas need the most work and focus our energy on trying to solve the problem with our partners: the FAA, airlines, and you.\n\nSubmit a Noise Report\n\nWe take every noise report seriously, we review and import each one into our database. Monthly totals are analyzed and presented in the monthly Airport Director’s Report.\n\nYou can Contact Us to reach out to our SFO Noise Office for any additional questions or requests. You can also contact your local elected officials to discuss any concerns you have and join our SFO Airport Community Roundtable which meets bi-monthly in Millbrae. Our Airport Director attends these meetings, as well as our Noise Office Team and members of the FAA and airlines representatives. This is your chance to meet us in person to share your ideas and feedback on what’s working and what needs improvement.\n\nSFO Airport Community Roundtable:\n\nDavid Chetcuti Community Room- Millbrae City Hall\n\n450 Poplar Avenue, Millbrae, CA 94030\n\nPlease check the Roundtable’s website for updated meeting dates and times.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 91.119 states that, except when necessary for departure or landing, the minimum altitude over urban areas is 1,000 feet and 500 feet over rural areas. Helicopters may fly below minimum altitude requirements if they’re not a danger to people or property on the ground. Local and state authorities do not have jurisdiction over airspace regulations and, therefore, cannot mandate that aircraft and/or helicopters fly at higher altitudes.\n\nAircraft operating under visual flight rules outside or beneath the FAA controlled airspace are not required to use Air Traffic Control's services and can fly unrestricted. A pilot can freely select his or her route and altitude with no restrictions other than those flight rules establishing minimum altitudes for flights over populated residential areas and required separation distances from clouds, terrain, and other aircraft.\n\nYes, weather impacts SFO’s flight operations. The primary factor in determining which runway to use for arrivals and departures is wind speed and direction. For safety reasons, aircraft takeoff and land into the wind. More than 95% of the time, winds blow from the west. This means planes have to arrive and land facing west. This is called the West Plan. Less than 5% of the time, aircraft at SFO switch to the Southeast Plan where planes take off to the east and land facing south. This typically happens during adverse weather conditions when prevailing winds shift and blow from the south-southeast. Therefore, planes may appear above neighborhoods where they normally aren’t. During fair weather, about 60 planes arrive each hour at SFO. When there is inclement weather, the arrival rate is reduced by half to 30 or less per hour. This causes delays throughout the day, pushing flight activities into late night hours.\n\nLearn more about SFO's flight patterns and operations.\n\nHelicopters typically circle the skies for news events which include political marches, traffic accidents, disasters, and crime scenes. Law enforcement, hospitals, and the U.S. Coast Guard may also deploy flights. For example, if you spot an orange helicopter flying out to San Francisco’s Ocean Beach, it’s probably the U.S. Coast Guard performing a rescue operation or training exercise. Most helicopter operations are not based at SFO but other local airports. Helicopters do not need approval prior to operation unlike scheduled air carriers, therefore, SFO often does not receive communication about such flights until after the overflight has happened. Helicopters are not required to maintain any particular altitude; they may fly below minimum altitude requirements if the operation is conducted without hazard to people or property on the ground.\n\nFor additional information please refer to our helicopter operations page.\n\nSFO’s Noise Office Team has installed 29 permanent noise monitors in neighborhoods ranging north from San Francisco’s Pacific Heights area, down south to Redwood City, and east from Foster City west to Pacifica. These sites, which are acoustic microphones mounted on tall poles, measure noise and transmit data 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to our computerized noise monitoring and flight tracking system located at the Airport. The high level of accuracy is attained through the use of precision noise measurement equipment, electronic calibration checks, and annual laboratory certification of the field calibration equipment. We also have eight portable noise monitors which we rotate throughout the Bay Area based on requests from the community. Portable sites range as far south as Santa Cruz and as far north as Tiburon. We also have three monitors located on our airfield which provide us with valuable data on noise levels generated by airlines performing engine ground run ups for aircraft maintenance.\n\nIt depends on the aircraft type - meaning what kind of engine the plane has and its size, and whether the aircraft is taxiing on the airfield, landing, or taking off. Current versions of Stage 3 aircraft tend to be the quietest aircraft in the fleet. Older aircraft with Stage 3 \"hush kitted\" engines tend to be the loudest. Departures tend to be louder than arrivals since the pilot is using take-off and then climb power to achieve lift.\n\nWe are continually working with airline carriers to invest in new, quieter, and more fuel-efficient aircraft. Older Stage 2 aircraft, which include members of the Airbus 320 family, are louder than Stage 3. That’s why SFO has launched a campaign to urge airlines to retrofit A320s with tiny devices called airflow deflectors, which make the aircraft operate more quietly. German researchers developed the small aluminum device which diverts wind from vents on the underside of the plane’s wings, reducing the high-pitched howling or whining sound you hear just before the landing gear and flaps are deployed for landing. The A320’s noise is similar to the sound you make when blowing across the mouth of a soda pop bottle. At a cost of roughly $3000 to retrofit one aircraft, we believe this investment in noise abatement is smart, cost-effective, and a win-win for our neighbors and the Airport community. Learn more about the progress of our airflow deflector retrofit initiative.\n\nSFO accepts all noise reports and provides various ways you can submit them. There no time reporting restrictions. If possible, report events immediately so that we can provide the community with an accurate and timely representation of these noise reports.\n\nTo enhance the accuracy and efficiency of your reports, we do require specific dates and times be given for each disturbance. We recommend that you submit one report for each disturbance and that every report contains the following information: first and last name, address, email address and telephone number, date and time of the noise event.\n\nIf you’d like to report multiple noise events and wish them to be registered, these noise reports should be made using separate online form submissions or emails.\n\nWhile we understand your frustration, we will not respond to abusive or threatening language. If necessary, such noise reports will be turned over to law enforcement for investigation.\n\nSubmit a Noise Report\n\nIf you are considering buying or renting a home near SFO or on the San Francisco Peninsula and are interested in learning about established flight paths in a particular neighborhood, please let us know. Our Noise Office Staff can walk you through the process and provide overflight information relative to your potential property. We want to help you better understand what to expect when living near a busy metropolitan airport. Our main goal is to minimize the number of people who are living with aircraft noise on a daily basis. Remember, not everyone is affected by noise in the same way as noise is truly subjective. To gauge how aircraft noise could personally affect you, complete this brief survey .\n\nAre you sensitive to noise?\n\nAre you a light sleeper or do you wake up often?\n\nIs the home in a relatively quiet area, away from major traffic and other noises that could potentially mask aircraft noise?\n\nIs the home close to the Airport or directly below regular aircraft flight paths?\n\nIs the home poorly insulated from noise?\n\nAre you usually at home during the day?\n\nDo you regularly entertain outside?\n\nDo you usually sleep with the bedroom windows open?\n\nIf you answered yes to a number of these questions, then you are more likely to be disrupted by aircraft noise."
