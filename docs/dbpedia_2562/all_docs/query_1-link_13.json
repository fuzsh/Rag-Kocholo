Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn, Midnight Sun #1 – #5 by Stephenie Meyer. Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Paranormal, Vampires, Fiction. First Published 2006.\n\nAccording to Goodreads, Twilight is, “Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.” This fictional saga takes the reader on a journey where monsters and romance intertwine against a very authentic backdrop. The dense rain forest, the sandy ocean beaches of the Quileute tribal lands, and the small town feel of Forks, Washington were the inspiration for Meyer’s perfect setting.
