        "meta_description": "Stop for a moment at the t-junction of the two paths. \r\n\r\nHave a look at the structure on your right.\r\n\r\nThis is the Temple of the Frescos, or Templo de las Pinturas in Spanish. It is one of the best preserved structures here. It's also of major interest in the ancient city for its iconography. It is dated Late Post-Classic, which is the period between 1400-1550.\r\n\r\nTake a look at its architecture.\r\n\r\nIt includes a niche on the top of the building in which the figure of a deity or lord is shown. Mythological themes on its murals represented death, the underworld and re-birth. Venus and the sun play key roles in defining characteristics of both art and architecture of the city. The sacred and the profane were intertwined at Tulum, due to its importance as a predominant trade center, and a major ceremonial city.\r\n \r\nLike other structures, it's made of a number of structural add-ons that evolved over time. It initially began as a simple building. Later additions include the column gallery you see surrounding the initial structure, the second floor, the buttress in the back to support the second floor and the low rear stepped platform. They answered religious and ceremonial needs that evolved through time. \r\n\r\nLook at the three niches at the front facade with the Descending God in the center and other figures with feathers on each side. \r\n\r\nHave a look to the front wall on the second floor. \r\n\r\nCan you see some red human hands are stamped on it?\r\n\r\nThese are probably the authors of the artistic design present on this building, but also probably the hands of later evidence of pre-Hispanic vandalism. Stamping hands wasn’t unusual in Maya art, but the odd location of these makes one wonder don’t you think?\r\n\r\nLet's go over to have a look at the main entrance of the building. Facing the building, it will be on the left side of it, next to the small grass hut structure.\r\n\r\n[5 SECOND PAUSE]\r\n\r\nThe paintings on the stucco covered stelae were made using a blue-green color against a black background, as was the back of the stelae in front of the building’s main entrance. \r\n\r\nThe front of the stelae showed eroded remains of glyphs. The paintings are those of the omni-present gods. The figures shown are individuals offering or receiving gifts of maize rituals, such as planting or harvesting; while female deities are shown grounding maize on a metate, or grinding stone. \r\n\r\nLook inside the building through the second doorway from the left. \r\n\r\nYou can see what’s probably the most interesting, and somewhat well preserved paintings, inside on the wall of the inner temple. \r\n\r\n[4 SECOND PAUSE]\r\n\r\nThe paintings display scenes of abundant flowers, fruits and ears of corn representative of fertility. The upper and lower interlaced design knots, are the Pop, the word for mat in Maya. It's associated with Nah or house and underlines the concept of community. The Maya also called their ruling Lord Ah Pop, “he of the mat”, a term synonymous with Ahau or lord, associated with the highest religious authority, and kingship. \r\n\r\nNow, walk back a little and facing the front of the building, pay attention to the corners at either end. \r\n\r\nYou’ll see on one side, the left hand side of a face, and on the other, the right hand side of a face. \r\n\r\nIf you move around to the gable end of either side, you can see the other side of the face. \r\n\r\nThese elements seem to guard the North-east and South-east corners of the building. East is the direction you're facing, towards the sea, and north is on your left. Very little is known about these two guardians, but they seem to represent the patron god of the city. \r\n\r\nNow turn around to the opposite building behind you.\r\n\r\n[5 SECOND PAUSE]\r\n\r\nThis is the house of the Chultun. \r\n\r\nBeyond the two columns you see in the entrance; is a large closed area with a small sanctuary, and a room that was added at a later date. The roof of the structure, now gone, was flat and built on wood beams covered inside-out with lime concrete. \r\n\r\nOver the main and secondary doorways were niches with the stucco figures of the descending god, seen in most buildings at Tulum. The walls inside were painted with mythological figures; black and red color remains were found in it. \r\n\r\nA chultun is a deposit for rain water and this structure receives its name due to the chultun found in its premises.\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to move on, turn so the Temple of the Frescoes is on your right hand side and the House of the Chultun on your left, then walk down the path.",
