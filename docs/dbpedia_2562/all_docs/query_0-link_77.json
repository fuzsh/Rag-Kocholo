It has since weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nLandfall was near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It’s not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.\n\nWHAT DAMAGE IS EXPECTED?\n\nRecord-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding, with up to 30 inches possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. The potential for high water threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Up to 18 inches was forecast in central and north Florida.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because the storm is moving into Georgia, it doesn’t mean the state won’t continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” he said during an afternoon briefing at the state’s emergency operations center. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.”\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE CAROLINAS?\n\nSome of the heaviest rains could come along the Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville, Florida, through coastal regions of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\n“We could see a stall or a meandering motion around coastal portions of the southeastern United States,” National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said in a Saturday briefing. “So that’s going to exacerbate not just the rainfall risk, but also the potential for storm surge and some strong winds.”\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n“We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,” Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nWHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT IN VIRGINIA?\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wakefield reports that impacts from Tropical Storm Debby could be seen in Virginia as early as Wednesday, potentially continuing into the weekend.\n\nThe weather service’s most recent briefing stated uncertainty remains about what those impacts may look like. Heavy rainfall and flooding are likely primary threats. Additional potential impacts include increased chances for rip currents and gusty winds later this week, but it’s too soon for specific timing. Current estimates have the storm’s intensity at about 69 mph.\n\nHow strong Debby will get depends on how far over the Atlantic Ocean the system moves, and how long it remains over water.\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin posted on social media Monday: \"As Tropical Storm Debby brings powerful wind and rain, I encourage all Virginians to be prepared for incoming weather & exercise caution. And THANK YOU to Virginia Task Force 1 & 2 who are answering the call to assist neighboring states. Together, we can weather this storm.\"\n\nThe weather service is forecasting showers likely Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nThe Associated Press and The Virginian-Pilot contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
