        "text": "An audiogram is a graph that displays the results of your hearing test. Initially, it might look like a bunch of indecipherable lines and symbols. But once you learn how to read and interpret your audiogram, you will better understand your hearing loss. Even more importantly, your hearing care professional will use the results to help determine the best type of hearing aid for you.\n\nThis page explores:\n\nWhat an audiogram measures\n\nHow to read an audiogram\n\nCommon symbols and what they mean\n\nMeasuring normal hearing for kids and adults\n\nDegrees of hearing loss mapped on an audiogram\n\nWhen hearing aids are recommended\n\nExamples of audiograms for different hearing loss types\n\nAdditional details sometimes included on audiograms\n\nWhere to find a hearing care provider\n\nAn audiogram measures your hearing ability\n\nThe goal of audiometric testing is to measure your hearing ability across a range of frequencies in each ear independently. This testing produces a chart called an audiogram.\n\nHearing threshhold\n\nThe audiogram plots your hearing thresholds across various frequencies, or pitches, in a quiet listening environment. A hearing threshold is defined as the softest sound you are able to detect about 50 percent of the time. So don't be surprised if you feel like you \"missed\" some of the beeps.\n\nAn important thing to remember is that the audiogram is quantitative, not qualitative. It uses a specific numerical system to measure residual hearing ability in quiet rooms; it doesn't subjectively describe the quality of your hearing ability.\n\nHow to read an audiogram\n\nLooking at the audiogram graph, you will see two axes:\n\nThe horizontal axis (x-axis) represents frequency (pitch) from lowest to highest.\n\nYou can think of the frequency axis like the keys on a piano where the sounds become higher pitched as you progress from left to right. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). The lowest frequency tested is usually 250 Hz, and the highest is usually 8000 Hz. Most speech falls into the 250 to 6000 Hz range. Vowel sounds are lower-pitched and consonants such as S, F, SH, CH, H, TH, T and K sounds are higher. (Some audiograms have a banana-shaped zone overlaid on top to indicate the sound/pitch areas of most human speech, known as the \"speech banana.\")\n\nThe vertical axis (y-axis) of the audiogram represents the intensity (loudness) of sound.\n\nThe volume of sound is measured in decibels (dB). The lowest (quietest) levels start at the top of the graph. Although the top left of the chart is labeled -10 dB or 0 dB, that does not mean the absence of sound. Zero decibels actually represents the softest level of sound that the average person with normal hearing will hear, for any given frequency. (It's actually a normative curve that has been straightened out!)\n\nAs a reference point, a person with normal hearing will be able to hear very quiet sounds across all pitches, such as humming, leaves rustling, a faucet dripping, and birds chirping in the distance.\n\nWhat do the symbols on an audiogram mean?\n\nThere are several different symbols used to indicate thresholds on an audiogram, depending on the specific testing conditions.\n\nAir conduction\n\nTesting with headphones is called air conduction testing because the sound must travel through the empty space of the ear canal to reach the inner ear.\n\na red \"o\" marks the air conduction results for the right ear\n\na blue \"x\" marks the air conduction results for the left ear\n\nEach symbol on the chart represents your threshold for a given frequency. In the example above, the individual's threshold for 2000 Hz was 50 dB in each ear. Once all of the thresholds are measured and plotted on the graph, they are connected to form easy-to-read lines for the left and right ears.\n\nIf the two lines are essentially overlapping, your hearing loss is considered symmetrical, or the same in both ears. If the lines are not overlapping your hearing loss is considered asymmetrical, meaning your ears have differing degrees of hearing loss.\n\nBone conduction testing\n\nDuring this test, a device is placed behind the ear in order to transmit sound through the vibration of the mastoid bone. It is marked with a “[“ or a “<” symbol. Bone conduction testing is used to detect conductive hearing loss, when there may be a physical obstruction or other problem physically blocking sound from entering the ear. This is different from the more common type of hearing loss, sensorineural, which means a problem with the sensory or nerve cells.\n\nWhat is normal hearing on an audiogram?\n\nAdults: Looking at the above audiogram, normal hearing ability for adults is represented in the blue shaded area above the 25-dB line that crosses the graph from left to right.\n\nChildren: Because children have more sensitive hearing, a child is considered to have normal hearing ability if their hearing test indicates they can hear sounds as soft as 0 to 15 dB across the frequency range.\n\nNote that audiograms are not a good way to measure hidden hearing loss or auditory processing disorder. These hearing loss conditions originate in the brain, not the ear. For either condition, you may be told your audiogram is normal but you may still struggle to make sense of sound.\n\nClassifying the degree of hearing loss\n\nYour hearing care professional will classify the severity of your hearing loss, or degree of hearing loss, by where the symbols fall on the graph. Hearing loss is often classified as slight, mild, moderate, moderate-to-severe, severe or profound. They will also describe the pattern of your loss, generally as flat, sloping or rising.\n\nThe space between the normal hearing area and your threshold symbols represents all of the sounds you’re missing because of your hearing loss. The bigger the space, the more sounds you’re not hearing.\n\nWhen are hearing aids recommended?\n\nEven mild hearing loss can cause communication difficulties. For this reason, hearing aids are often recommended for any degree of hearing loss. The good news? Your hearing care provider can adjust the amplification specific to your audiogram. They also can adjust hearing aid settings to account for tinnitus or special hearing situations.\n\nExamples of audiograms for different hearing loss types\n\nHearing loss is highly unique. Audiogram results can vary widely and reveal different types of hearing loss.\n\nFor example, this audiogram indicates a type of hearing loss that makes it harder to hear low-pitched sounds:\n\nAnd this audiogram reveals \"cookie bite\" hearing loss, in which middle pitches are harder to hear:\n\nWhy does my audiogram have more symbols and abbreviations on it?\n\nThe examples we've included here are simplified to make them easier to understand. Your audiogram may include a lot more information, such as:\n\nSpeech recognition thresholds (SRT)\n\nWord recognition scores (WR)\n\nMost comfortable level (MCL)\n\nUncomfortable level (UCL)\n\nSpeech in noise/Hearing in noise testing (SIN/HINT)\n\nMore: Hearing loss glossary\n\nAfter your visit to a hearing center, they should provide you with a report of your visit. If not included with the report, request a copy of your audiometric test results. Not only will these results serve as a prescription for you, but it will serve as a baseline for you and your hearing care professional to monitor any changes in your hearing down the road.\n\nFind a hearing care provider near you"
