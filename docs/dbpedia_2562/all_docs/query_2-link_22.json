        "text": "In BiblioCommons, click the “Help” link in the upper-right corner of the screen. Use the menu options to select the topic you need help with.\n\nThe Classic Catalog comes with online help you can look at by clicking on the “Search Help” button in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nThe “Broaden Search” button appears in BiblioCommons after performing a search. In the Classic Catalog the “Show Similar” button appears on the detail page only after you’ve performed a keyword search. When you click on either button, another keyword search is performed to find subjects close to your original search.\n\nFor example, if you did a keyword search in the Classic Catalog on Columbus, and on the results page, you clicked the “Where is it?” link for the first item, a book called Christopher Columbus: To the New World, you would get a detail page that has a “Show Similar” button at the top. If you click on that button, it will do a search for subjects related to Columbus. The results list will show books about other explorers, such as Captain John Smith or Hernando de Soto. If you click on the “Where is it?” link for one of those items and scroll down, you’ll see the subjects that the “Show Similar” button searched for highlighted in red.\n\nWhen you check either of these boxes in BiblioCommons or the Classic Catalog and perform a search, the catalog will only display items that are actually in a library and on the shelf or waiting to be shelved.\n\nIn BiblioCommons you can limit the search to one, multiple or all library branches. In the Classic Catalog you must also limit to a specific location. Please note that doing both at the same time may limit the results that you will see.\n\nWhen you click on Catalog or Search Catalog, you will see a drop-down menu to choose to search by Keyword (default), Title, Author, or Subject. Select one and type your search term(s) into the second box. Optionally, you can use the third box to limit your search to a specific library or Adult, Teen, or Children’s materials. You can also check the box below the Search button to limit your search to in-stock items only.\n\nYou can use Advanced Search if you want to use multiple search terms, such as title and author, or if you want to limit your search to a specific library, location, type of material, language, publisher, or year.\n\nIn BiblioCommons, there are summaries and reviews (if any) within the item record details. You can find “Opinions” towards the bottom of the page from the Critics (official reviews) and from the Community (other library users).\n\nIn the Classic Catalog, perform your search and go to the detail page for the item you are interested in. Look for the “Reviews & More” button near the bottom of the page. Clicking this provides any available reviews, summaries, and additional content information.\n\nIn BiblioCommons, you can add items to a “For Later”, “In Progress” or “Completed” shelf. This allows you to keep track of items you may, are currently or finished reading, listening to, or watching.\n\nIn the Classic Catalog, you can save a list from your search results by clicking “Add to Book Bag” next to the items you want to add to your list. Once you have added items to your Book Bag, you can click the “View Book Bag” button (above the search options) to see your list. From there, you may save or send your list, or place holds on the items.\n\nWhen viewing your Book Bag, click “Save Book Bag” to select formatting and sending options. If you choose to email your list, enter an email address into the “Mail To:” box, change the subject if you wish, and click the “Submit” button.\n\nSearch for the item you want by typing a title, keyword, or author name in the search box and click on “Search”. This will produce a “Search Results” page. (For example, if you search for an author, you will first get a list of authors to choose from. When you click on an author’s name, you will get the “Search Results” page.) From the “Search Results” page, simply click on a title or cover art (if shown) and you will see the detail page for that item, including holdings. If there are more than 10 copies, click on the button “View additional copies or search for specific copy/volume” and all copies will be displayed.\n\nAll nine public library jurisdictions in the Peninsula Library System consortium share several eBook resources including the popular Peninsula Digital Library eBook collection. These titles are available to anyone who has a card from any library in the Peninsula Library System. When using the online catalog, any eBook title that is available to all will say, “Connect to this resource online.”\n\nIn addition to this shared collection, there are eBooks in the library catalog that are only available to cardholders from the library that purchased the eBook. Publishers and Digital Rights Management prevent the loan of these titles outside the specific library’s boundaries. When using the online catalog these titles will say, for example, “San Mateo County Library Cardholders (card begins with 29041) Click Here to download this eBook.” See the information at https://plsinfo.org/emedia to learn more about e-Resources.\n\nYour Personal Identification Number (PIN) helps to protect your library account from being used by others. The PIN consists of four digits. The default PIN may be the last four digits of the telephone number you provided when you applied for a library card. When you try to login and cannot access your library account, your address and/or telephone number may be out of date in our records. Please bring photo identification and proof of your current home address in to one of our libraries to have this information updated for you.\n\nIf you wish to update or change your PIN via BiblioCommons, go to “My Settings” and find the PIN setting under Account Information.\n\nIf you wish to update or change your PIN via the Classic Catalog, you can!\n\nGo to https://catalog.plsinfo.org/search.\n\nClick on the “My Library Account” link in the yellow bar.\n\nLog in using your library account number and your current PIN.\n\nClick on “Modify PIN” located on the right side of the screen.\n\nYou will be asked to enter your old PIN followed by the new 4-digit PIN you want to use.\n\nAfter entering the new PIN and verifying it, click on “Submit”.\n\nIn BiblioCommons, click on the “Log In” link in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. You will be asked for your 14-digit library card number or username and PIN. If you have not set up a username for the account, you will be prompted to do so. When you are finished checking your account, remember to log out so that others will not be able to access it.\n\nIn the Classic Catalog at https://catalog.plsinfo.org/search, click the “My Library Account” link in the yellow bar toward the top of the screen. You will be asked for your 14-digit library card number and PIN. When you are finished checking your account, remember to log out so that others will not be able to access it.\n\nIn OneSearch, login using the “Sign in” link in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Select the appropriate login for Community Members or SMCCD Students, Faculty and Staff.\n\nCommunity members, including members of the Peninsula Library System, who have OneSearch accounts login with their OneSearch account credentials and password, which may be set to include any of the following, according to your preferences when you create your account: OneSearch account number (everyone will be assigned one of these by default), PLS Library card number, or other user name or ID. Please note that the password is unique to your OneSearch account and is not necessarily the same as your PLS account.\n\nCurrent students, faculty, and staff of one of the colleges or the college district login using their single sign on college credentials used for all OneLogin accounts, including Canvas, Zoom, etc.\n\nThe Peninsula Library System will automatically renew eligible items two days before the due date. The new due dates will be based on the original due dates. You will receive notification two days in advance of the due date alerting you which items have been renewed and which items cannot be renewed. Items with holds/reserves or that have reached the maximum renewal limit will not renew. Your library account must be current and have a balance of fifteen dollars ($15) or less for automatic renewals to work.\n\nOther ways to renew:\n\nBiblioCommons – renew through the My Borrowing menu item. From the “Checked Out” tab, select the items you wish to renew and click “Renew”. A new due date will appear indicating a successful renewal.\n\nClassic Catalog – renew through either the “Renew Items” link or the “My Library Account” link. Login to the catalog with your library card number and PIN to access your account. If the center of the screen does not show the “# of Items Checked Out” and the title list, locate the link to “# of Items Checked Out” on the right side of the screen. The list of items you currently have checked out (“Items Currently Checked Out”) displays to the bottom of the screen. You may choose to renew everything checked out by clicking “Renew All” or you can choose which items to renew by checking the check box to the left of each item you want to renew. Click the “Renew Marked” button to renew only those items you selected.\n\nText – renew through SMS text message via Shoutbomb. Go to https://plsinfo.org/texturlib for instruction on how to register for text message alerts and renew your items.\n\nTelephone – renew through telephone prompts can be done by calling (650) 638-0399.\n\nApp – renew through mobile app from either the Apple Store or Google Play. Search for “Peninsula Library System” and choose your home library app.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact your local library.\n\nThe most likely reasons for not receiving an email notification from us is that our emails may have been routed to your spam or junk email folder, or the email address in your account is incorrect.\n\nLog into your account and check your email address. Look carefully for spelling and/or punctuation errors to fix.\n\nCheck your spam or junk folders. You can mark our emails as “not spam”, or similar terminology, so that our email goes straight into your inbox rather than your junk or spam folder. Check with your email provider on how to whitelist a sender or prevent emails from going to the spam/junk folder. You may also consider getting into the habit of checking your spam/junk folders periodically.\n\nMany fees are non-refundable. Since policies vary at PLS libraries, contact your local library before paying any fees. They can explain the fines and fees that appear on your account. If you have a question about a payment do the following:\n\nCheck to see if the fee/fine still shows in your account. If it still shows there, your payment didn’t go through.\n\nCheck in your credit card statement to see if the payment appears.\n\nCheck your confirmation email.\n\nPlease have a copy of your statement and confirmation email when you contact your local library. If you find a charge on your credit card that needs to be disputed, your credit card company will help you with the proper procedure."
