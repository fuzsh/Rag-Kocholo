FOX News continues on the hour.\n\nFCC filings indicate WDMJ recently returned to its full daytime power of 5kW, with 140 Watts at night. WMIQ transmits with 1kW day and night.\n\nRadio Results Network continues to program a News/Talk format on WCHT/600 (Escanaba) and W228DQ/93.5 (Escanaba). WCHT delivers a fringe daytime signal to Iron Mountain and Marquette, which have no other News/Talk stations.\n\nThe imaging on WDMJ includes an occasional announcement that listeners can find their favorite talk shows on WCHT’s website:"
