        "text": "Pacific salmon and steelhead have a dynamic life cycle that includes time in fresh and saltwater habitats. These fish are born in freshwater streams and rivers, migrate to coastal estuaries, then enter the ocean where they mature. They usually return as adults to the same streams where they were born to spawn and begin the cycle again.\n\nNOAA Fisheries manages and protects several species of fish in the Salmonidae family in both the Atlantic and Pacific. Some are threatened or endangered and protected under the Endangered Species Act. Others are targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries and are managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act to maintain healthy, sustainable population levels.\n\nPacific salmon and steelhead include the following species:\n\nChinook Salmon\n\nESA-protected Chinook salmon\n\nMSA-managed Chinook salmon fisheries\n\nChum Salmon\n\nESA-protected chum salmon\n\nMSA-managed chum salmon fisheries\n\nCoho Salmon\n\nESA-protected coho salmon\n\nMSA-managed coho salmon fisheries\n\nSockeye Salmon\n\nESA protected sockeye salmon\n\nMSA-managed sockeye salmon fisheries\n\nPink Salmon\n\nMSA-managed pink salmon fisheries\n\nSteelhead Trout\n\nESA-protected steelhead trout\n\nLearn about our work to manage and protect salmon and steelhead in the Pacific Northwest:\n\nNOAA Fisheries has listed 28 population groups of salmon and steelhead on the West Coast as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Primary listing and recovery responsibilities for salmon and steelhead belong to NOAA Fisheries. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, other federal and state agencies, and tribal governments also play important roles in recovery.\n\nLearn about the conservation and management of these species\n\nWhat We Do\n\nOur West Coast Region works with partners to protect, conserve, and recover salmon and steelhead by addressing the threats these animals face and by restoring the habitat on which they depend.\n\nRecovery Planning and Implementation\n\nThe ESA requires us to develop and implement recovery plans for salmon and steelhead listed under the ESA. Recovery plans identify actions needed to restore threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead to the point that they are again viable and a functional element of their ecosystems and no longer need protection. Although recovery plans are guidance, not regulatory documents, the ESA envisions recovery plans as the central organizing tool for guiding and coordinating recovery efforts across a wide spectrum of federal, state, tribal, local, and private entities. Recovery planning is an opportunity to find common ground among diverse interests, obtain needed protection and restoration for salmonids and their habitat, and secure the economic and cultural benefits of healthy watersheds and rivers. Recovery planning is a collaborative effort that draws on the collective knowledge, expertise, and actions of communities and partnerships.\n\nFind recovery plans for West Coast salmon and steelhead\n\nHabitat Restoration\n\nThrough habitat restoration, we work to undo the damages done to coastal wetlands and salmon-bearing streams. Nearly half of historic tidal wetlands have disappeared from Oregon's coastal estuaries; while in Puget Sound more than 80 percent of tidal wetlands have been lost and vast areas of floodplain wetlands have been cut off from rivers by levees or filled for development. In California, nearly 90 percent of the wetlands have been lost from habitat destruction mainly spurred by a booming population and economic development. We work with our partners to reconnect these marshes and floodplains to tidal or riparian waters and to restore habitat. We restore spawning and rearing habitats for fish, including salmon and steelhead, and improve fish passage by removing dams or replacing undersized culverts.\n\nLearn more about the restoration of salmon and steelhead habitat\n\nHatchery Programs\n\nHabitat alterations, hydroelectric development, and consumptive fisheries have impacted most of the salmon and steelhead populations in the Pacific Northwest. Hatcheries, or artificial propagation, are one tool to help support wild populations and provide fish for harvest.\n\nLearn about salmon and steelhead hatcheries on the West Coast\n\nUpstream and Downstream Passage\n\nDams change the way rivers function, and may interfere with the life cycles of salmon, steelhead, and other animals. They are barriers to juvenile salmon migrating to the ocean, and obstacles as adult fish return to their natal streams to spawn. Dams also affect the way water moves down a river, by changing the amount and timing of flow, as well as its temperature and chemical characteristics.\n\nFor salmon to thrive, it is important to provide safe, swift passage for juveniles traveling to the ocean and for adults migrating back to their spawning grounds. There are many types of passage infrastructure in use at and around dams, depending on factors such as a dam's age, size, location, and purpose. Sometimes passage facilities are added many years after a dam is built.\n\nFish passage solutions\n\nJuvenile downstream passage\n\nAdult upstream passage\n\nHydropower project reviews in Alaska\n\nHydropower project reviews on the West Coast\n\nReintroduction Efforts\n\nBecause of habitat destruction and hydropower dams on migratory rivers, many salmon and steelhead species no longer occupy their historical habitats. Reintroducing a species into its historical range is often critical to its recovery.\n\nThe ESA provides an important tool to facilitate the reintroduction of threatened and endangered species such as salmon. Section 10(j) of the ESA provides NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service authority to designate populations of listed species as \"experimental.\" This designation allows us to reestablish self-sustaining populations in regions that are outside the species' current range when doing so fosters its conservation and recovery.\n\nLearn more about species reintroductions\n\nProtected Salmon & Steelhead\n\nChinook Salmon\n\nNine evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) of Chinook salmon are protected under the ESA:\n\nUpper Willamette River Chinook Salmon\n\nSnake River Spring/Summer-run Chinook Salmon\n\nSnake River Fall-run Chinook Salmon\n\nPuget Sound Chinook Salmon\n\nLower Columbia River Chinook Salmon\n\nSacramento River Winter-run Chinook Salmon\n\nCentral Valley Spring-run Chinook Salmon\n\nCalifornia Coastal Chinook Salmon\n\nUpper Columbia River Spring-run Chinook Salmon\n\nChum Salmon\n\nTwo ESUs of chum salmon are protected under the ESA:\n\nHood Canal Summer-run Chum Salmon\n\nColumbia River Chum Salmon\n\nCoho Salmon\n\nFour ESUs of coho salmon are protected under the ESA:\n\nSouthern Oregon/Northern California Coast Coho Salmon\n\nOregon Coast Coho Salmon\n\nLower Columbia River Coho Salmon\n\nCentral California Coast Coho Salmon\n\nSockeye Salmon\n\nTwo ESUs of sockeye salmon are protected under the ESA:\n\nSnake River Sockeye Salmon\n\nOzette Lake Sockeye Salmon\n\nSteelhead\n\nEleven distinct population segments of steelhead are protected under the ESA:\n\nLower Columbia River Steelhead\n\nCalifornia Central Valley Steelhead\n\nMiddle Columbia River Steelhead\n\nUpper Willamette River Steelhead\n\nCentral California Coast Steelhead\n\nNorthern California Coast Steelhead\n\nPuget Sound Steelhead\n\nUpper Columbia River Steelhead\n\nSnake River Basin Steelhead\n\nSouth-Central California Coast Steelhead\n\nSouthern California Coast Steelhead"
