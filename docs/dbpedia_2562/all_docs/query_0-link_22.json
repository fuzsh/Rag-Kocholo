        "text": "With Peninsula Corridor now getting attention from the preservation crew, I gathered up most of the main issues/bugs I have with this route.\n\nNO WATER NEAR BAYSHORE\n\nThis has been an issue for consoles for a very long period of time. There is no water in the bay between Bayshore and South San Francisco. It is just a dry waterbed.\n\nCROSSING BETWEEN HAYWARD PARK AND HILLSDALE HAS ITS GATES UP\n\nThere is a crossing between Hayward Park and Hillsdale that has its gates up, and no flashing lights.\n\nWEIRD BLUE TEXTURE BUG\n\nEver since Peninsula Corridor got moved to preserved collection, there has been a blue and strange texture bug on various textures. The most notable one being the desk on the MP36. You can find this texture bug on various parts of the route. This issue is a lot more common in darker conditions such as nighttime and rain.\n\nAUDIO MIXING\n\nJust like lots of other preserved routes, this route has lots of audio mixing issues. The audio looping bug is the main issue. In terms of mixing, horns are way too quiet inside the cab with the window open, and specific sounds don't play at times. Audio desperately needs improvement on this route.\n\nLAG\n\nThis is probably the laggiest route in TSW2. Most of the lag is coming from trains. When in areas with lots of trains such as San Francisco, San Jose Diridon, and the CEMOF, frames drop a lot. Even when passing other trains frame drops do happen. The lag is the worst when around the CEMOF. There are times where my game freezes for split seconds when passing it. The trains on this route need optimizations badly.\n\nRENDRING\n\nRendering is very poor on this route. There are objects that are rendering only a couple hundred feet away from the train, things that can be seen from far distances are very poor quality. Rendering has improved a lot since TSW2 and this route could definitely use some improvements.\n\nSPECIAL SERVICE STUCK BEHIND LIMITED STOP SERVICE\n\nThe special service from San Francisco-CEMOF is one of the most frustrating and unfun timetables on the route. When you start the service, you are waiting for a green signal to proceed. There is 1 or 2 inbound trains that you have to wait for. Nothing too different or out of the ordinary. Once they pass, you would think that you would be cleared to proceed. However, a limited stop service using an MP36 gets to depart before you. This timetable starts 10 minutes after the special service starts. You are now stuck behind this train all the way to the CEMOF. Instead of the service taking less than an hour with little to no traffic, you are stuck behind a service stopping at every stop after Redwood City, taking almost 2 HOURS TO COMPLETE. It is one of the most boring and most tedious timetables ever, and this train needs to depart before the limited stop service to make it much more enjoyable .\n\nYOU CAN'T SELECT MP36, COACHES AND CAB CAR CUSTOM LIVERIES\n\nJust like the bug that occurred with East Coastway where you could not choose your custom liveries and use them in timetable mode, this route suffers the same issue, and it still has not been fixed. This bug makes it so that you cannot select your custom liveries for them to be used in timetable mode.\n\nAdditional bugs I have reported:\n\nAI TRAINS DO NOT TURN THEIR HEADLIGHTS OFF WHEN CHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nLet's say an AI train reaches San Francisco while you are in San Jose. The AI train then starts a service a few minutes later to go to San Jose. When the AI train changes directions, it DOES NOT turn off the headlights in the trailing unit. So referring back to my example, when changing directions at San Francisco, the cab car does not turn its headlights off. Coming back to the service you are driving, when you pass this service that didn't turn its headlights off, you are completely blinded by the headlights at the rear of the train.\n\nFLOATING CARS\n\nAs seen in some other routes, AI cars are floating a foot over the road.\n\nPOOR CLOUD QUALITY\n\nJust like most preserved routes, the quality of clouds is atrocious. It is all pixilated and just overall looks terrible. Hopefully this gets fixed as LIRR is getting this fix within its preservation update.\n\nSOME PLATFORMS AT SAN JOSE REQUIRE YOU TO SLOW TO 10MPH WHILE OTHERS KEEP YOU AT 20MPH\n\nNow I'm not sure if this is what actually happens in real life. When entering San Jose Diridon on the left-most platforms, you get to stay at 20mph when approaching the station. When entering the right-most platforms, you are required to slow down to 10mph. I highly doubt this is realistic. I would assume that all platforms would have a limit of 10mph.\n\nSOME SERVICES AT SAN FRANCISCO REQUIRE YOU TO OPEN THE WRONG DOORS\n\nSome services going out of San Francisco force you to open the wrong doors to load passengers. Luckily this isn't an issue with any other stations.\n\nUNDERPASSES AT SAN FRANCISCO ARE CONSIDERED TUNNELS, MEANING THAT YOU WILL BE FORCED INTO CAB VIEW AS IF YOU WERE ENTERING A TUNNEL\n\nWhen TSW2 was released, you are now no longer able to be in exterior view when entering tunnels. Outside of San Francisco station, you are going underneath some large overpasses. However, the game considers these as tunnels and you are forced to be in the cab. Same applies when you go to 22nd Street Station. You are unable to get out of cab view, yet there is no actual tunnel.\n\nTRAIN HORNS ARE WAY TOO QUIET WHEN FAR AWAY\n\nThis is a common issue on most American routes. In real life, you can hear American trains from a long distance away. In Peninsula Corridor however, you just begin to hear the horn when you are maybe 300 yards from the camera. Whatever distance it is, it is way too close. You begin to hear the horn maybe 100-200 yards after passing an X sign. Sand Patch Grade is the only route in TSW that gets this right. You can hear the horn from a very decent distance away. This needs to be fixed on Peninsula Corridor.\n\nSOME TIMETABLES THAT HAVE GO VIA LOCATION TASKS HAVE THE NEXT SIGNAL RED UNTIL YOU PASS THE GO VIA\n\nThis is seen mostly on timetables for the GP38 and MP15. When you are asked to go via a location, the signal after it is red until you pass the go via. This will confuse many drivers as they think they will need to stop for the next signal, only to find out that they didn't have to stop.\n\nUNION PACIFIC GP38 HORN BUG\n\nThis doesn't happen as often on TSW2, but at completely random times, the horn suddenly stops sounding. The horn drops a note down and slowly fades out. After a while, you hear the horn suddenly fade in. Then it fades out again. This repeatedly happens. To fix this, you have to save the game and rejoin the service. Still, this bug is super annoying.\n\nHORN COOLDOWN IS TOO LONG ON THE MP36\n\nThe cooldown for sounding the horn when turning it on and off is way too long. It is impossible to do quick horn blasts. The cooldown needs to be shortened.\n\nHORN ECHOS IN TUNNELS AND UNDERPASSES DISAPPEARED AFTER TSW2 RELEASED\n\nIn TSW2020, the horn echoing in the F40ph was perfect. The other trains were a bit too quiet however. When TSW2 came around, the horn echoing was completely removed. If horn echoing for tunnels and underpasses got re-added, that would be great.\n\nDEFAULT INTERIOR CAMERA OCCASIONALLY CRASHES GAME AND SHUTS OFF DEVICE\n\nI just discovered this bug. Occasionally when clicking the default interior camera option when youre a distance away from your train, the game occasionally crashes and shut off my Xbox. Default interior camera needs fixes badly.\n\nABNORMAL LOADING TIMES\n\nEver since the MP36 became livery designer compatible, the load times for Peninsula corridor have been terrible. They usually take 5-7 minutes for the route to load.\n\nThese are some of the main issues I have with this route. If there are any more issues or bugs you have with this route, please post a reply down below.\n\nWow you are on the ball :P (that's not criticism)"
