This social media platform helps people share biodiversity information with each other and learn more about the places they’re visiting. You can record your observations, help others identify species, and view other users’ identifications. When you record a species at a TNC nature preserve in Michigan, your finding will appear in our TNC Michigan Preserves & Reserves project within the iNaturalist system.\n\n2. Visit a TNC Nature Preserve in Michigan\n\nTNC’s preserves across the state don’t just protect Michigan’s natural heritage; they also protect the important benefits to physical, spiritual and mental wellness that nature provides people. With the help of our enthusiastic volunteers, we maintain these preserves for their ecological health and work to make them accessible to as many people as possible, through field trips, audio tours and more. After you visit a preserve, make sure to leave us a Google review to let us know about your experience.\n\n3. Deepen Your Connection to Nature with Audio Tours\n\nTake a tour through floodplain forests, wetlands, bluffs and marshes right from the palm of your hand. Our guided audio tours—provided via Travelstorys—include stories, fun facts, historical notes and natural sounds to deepen your connection to nature. You can access the tour from the comfort of your home or from your phone as you hike. If you’re accessing it from a mobile device, make sure you follow the instructions below before you head to the trail.\n\n5. Share Your Photos of Nature\n\nWhat does Michigan look like through your lens? We are always looking for photos that help represent Michigan’s natural beauty. Become a preserve photo ambassador to help us highlight the amazing views and local species our state has to offer. Participating in TNC’s yearly photo contest is another great way to get involved with conservation and showcase your best images. We also love to see your photos on social media. As you visit a preserve, tag us in your adventures using #TNCMichigan.\n\n6. Treasure Hunt with Geocaching\n\nGeocaching is an exciting way to explore the landscape, to discover something new and share special places with outdoor enthusiasts. Players seek to locate hidden containers, called geocaches or earthcaches, using a smartphone or GPS. It gets the whole family outside to explore the natural world and teaches kids about navigation with the fun reward of finding real hidden “treasure.” Geocaching is a regulated activity at TNC. In order to protect sensitive habitats and maintain a fun and safe activity, anyone wishing to place a geocache within our preserves must complete a permit application first.\n\n10. Prepare to Go “Offline”\n\nSome TNC-Michigan preserves are found in remote areas with minimal or no cellular data service, which can make navigating to them (and surrounding areas) difficult. Fortunately, you can take a section of Google Maps “offline” to allow full navigation even without any cellular connectivity.\n\nBy following the steps below, you can open the Google Maps app and access the downloaded offline map when you’re in an area with no internet service. You’ll be able to view the map, search for locations and get directions within the downloaded area.\n\nPlease note that offline maps do have some limitations: They don’t provide real-time traffic information or the ability to search for places outside the downloaded area. Additionally, the offline maps are only valid for a limited period, usually around 30 days, after which they need to be updated. To update your offline maps, simply connect to the internet and follow the same steps to download the updated version."
