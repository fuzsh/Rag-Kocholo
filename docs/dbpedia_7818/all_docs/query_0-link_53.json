Bordini's oddball rhythms are added to the ever-changing keyboards, and the result is a work with an Italian flavor that sounds like EL&P, Banco, and Metamorphosis all rolled into one. The new version of \"NATIVITA\" and two other songs by Rustichelli & Bordini are also worth listening to.\n\nDe Rossi E Bordini Collection List\n\nWe sell Japanese rare records , CDs.
