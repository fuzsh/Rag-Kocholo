        "text": "For prog rock people, it was always about the UK bands. I mean, the whole prog scene developed in England starting in 1969 or so, right? Well yes, that historically is the commonly held view for most fans in the States and the UK, and much of the continent of Europe. But dipping into the south of Europe, say Italy, you will find that view is not necessarily in favor. For Italy delivered a mother-lode of progressive bands in the early 70’s (1971-1975 in particular) that not only would boggle the mind, it is an equally startling amount of high end prog bands that not only rivals the famed UK scene, but outstrips it in many instances in both talent and sheer numbers. Heresy? Let’s take a look.\n\nMy original prog collection, circa summer after 12th grade\n\nFor my part, I started off like many of the era did: everyone had Yes and Jethro Tull albums, some of the more adventurous had ELP, King Crimson and Genesis albums too. The really freaky kids might have a Focus album or maybe Gentle Giant Live on top of the big five. But beyond that, prog on the higher level of UK bands and even more obscure, European bands, was hard to come by. It took real digging to find out about Hawkwind, Hatfield and the North, Gong, Magma, Can, Tangerine Dream, the Nice, Caravan, Gryphon, Soft Machine and their ilk in the pre-internet days. But Italian bands? Other than PFM Cook being ubiquitous in every record store’s cutout bins for $2.99, Italian rock was definitely hard to come by. Even Photos of Ghosts by PFM on ELP’s US Manticore label wasn’t exactly easy to find, even back in the late 70’s. Back then I didn’t give it much thought. The perceptions of the Italian fashion scene ebbed and flowed, but the opinion in the States was that the Italian music and film scene were generally cheesy and inferior to UK and US output, not really serious or informed enough to be in consideration in any discussion. Of course we now know that those perceptions were skewed by several broken lenses. Before we go further, we will need a short brain rewiring….\n\nThe only two Italian prog albums you’d ever see in record stores, 1977-1981\n\nDeprogramming\n\nNow close your eyes, we need to get some preconceptions out before properly proceeding deeper into the tale of Italian rock. Unfair perceptions ran rampant in the UK and US 60’s era that Italian stuff wasn’t quite first world, that they imitated everything from the UK and American culture. (ironic considering Rome was already 2,500 years old when America was founded). So let’s first eject that idea from any preconceptions many (even me back in the day) might be lugging around. Italian prog rock is a journey into an area closer to stepping through the back of the wardrobe and entering Narnia-except in this case, most of us didn’t even know this wardrobe was even here. However, there might be some warning signs that a jump into the deep waters of this scene might not be for all.\n\nFor many, the vocals can be a sticking point. First, they are in Italian, which some people never get past. (for many the Italian vocals are an integral element, an extra instrument that functions more than a traditional rock singer-Demetrio Stratos is the best example, but we are getting far ahead of ourselves) But Italian vocalists can tend towards the the gruff and raw, combined with an emotional delivery that just cannot be ignored. One thing many have in common though, and often heard in many corners is that so many people who are fans of the scene say ‘it doesn’t matter if I don’t speak Italian, I love the vocals’ (I also agree with this statement wholeheartedly, it honestly doesn’t matter). However, if you don’t like the vocal angst of Peter Hammill, you should probably look away. If you don’t like Jethro Tull or ELP, look away. If you like pastoral early 1970-71 era Genesis, King Crimson, Gentle Giant? Come right in. If you like raw kickass rawk I will hold the door for you. If you are one of those 70’s proto math-prog guys who count out 13/8 but still complain the ‘contrapuntal accents didn’t fare well in mixylodian mode’, you still might want to look in. You like the reckless abandon of that freaky Aphrodite’s Child double lp? You’re already initiated. Italian bands don’t really pull any punches, rarely have gentle understated vocals so common in 2nd division Brit prog bands-it’s always right there on the table for good or ill, but cannot be ignored.\n\nHow different is this from the nearly non existent American prog scene (more consumers than creators) and the big daddy UK prog scene? Picture 100 Jethro Tull cover bands suddenly breaking out into original compositions and playing live in a country only half the size of Texas. Picture another 40 or so ELP cover bands going original at the same time. Add in a hundred Genesis cover bands and a dozen King Crimsons doing the same and stir the pot and get all of them signed to either a major label or a larger indie label in a five year span and you are beginning to see how unprecedented this all was. Let that sink in for a minute. 300 bands criss-crossing the country incubating a new hermetic version of what they’d absorbed. It’s funny that Italy of all places beamed onto the UK bands that toured the country in 1971-1972 so fully: Genesis and Van der Graaf Generator were huge in Italy before they were in the UK (VDGG said that they couldn’t walk the streets of Italy without being swarmed by huge crowds of fans). Gentle Giant and Amon Duul 2 also had big tours in the formative years. Now you’re beginning to get just how unprecedented this movement was. Sure the Brits and the Yanks invented the garage rock era, the British invasion, keyboard heavy overamplified rock, formative progressive rock-but these guys took the ball and locked themselves up in the laboratory and exploded with a tsunami of Mediterranean vaguely UK prog jazz folk wtf music that is the most spirited projection of human soul into music I’ve encountered in my long years of listening to rock music. If you are still on board, let’s proceed…\n\nRoots\n\nThe roots of the scene are heavily embedded in the somewhat known Italian ‘beat’ scene. Like many countries in Europe, rock n roll blew up big in Italy in the early to mid 60’s. Literally hundreds of bands popped up mimicking the styles of American and British bands of the same era- The Sonics, The Troggs, Question Mark and the Mysterians, the Animals, Hendrix, the Kinks…Italy went far deeper into the garage rock and later psych rock hole than most countries did (Brazil is another location that had a similar explosion). The youth scene had poked its head into the mainstream, and a large cultural shift was underway propelled by cheap electric guitars and fuzzy Farfisas. TV, regional song festivals, and youth clubs spread the word and Italy had a vibrant, albeit derivative, burgeoning 60’s rock scene. I Corvi, I Ribelli, I Giganti, I Dik Dik, Equipe 84, I Nomadi were some of the better known of the hundreds of bands formed….they all followed a similar high spirited sonic pop path. This set the stage for the next steps.\n\nThe Birth of RPI\n\nMany refer to Italian progressive rock as RPI, or Rock Progressivo Italiano. This term is more recent and collects all of the various Italian bands into its own niche of a sub-genre of progressive rock. Although it is generally used to describe 1970’s era Italian prog, it also is applied to more recent bands that keep this sound alive in Italy.\n\nWhere Do I Start? part 1: Proto Prog Explodes\n\nFlea on the Honey Panna Fredda Blocco Mentale The Trip\n\nThe first bands to dip their toes into prog rock still were firmly recognizable rock bands with heavy psych roots. Synths hadn’t yet shown up on the scene, so the blueprint of the Italian sound was initially developed with many bands adopting flute as one of the main instruments. Styles varied from UK influenced organ bands like Atomic Rooster, Deep Purple and Uriah Heep to heavy psych with an edge, like the Trip. Flea on the Honey kept up an honest English flower power vibe as did Blocco Mentale. Panna Fredda (Uno), Delirium (Dolce Acqua), Osanna (L’Uomo) are all variants of this early sound-some loose folk, some heavy acid guitar Tull influenced arrangements, some acoustic guitars predominant. Flute starting to become integral to the sound. Delirium was a good example of a band that broke out from the underground through the San Remo Song Festival with an unexpected Godspell tinged monster hit, Jesahel\n\nThough there are many essential bands in the ‘proto prog’ era of 1970-1971, those just getting started should actually start with the Big Three….\n\nThe Big Three-Everyone Should Start Here\n\nFor many just getting started in Italian prog, the Big Three are the only bands anyone knows about: PFM (Premiata Forneria Marconi), Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso and Le Orme. It is no coincidence these three bands are some of the only ones to put out more than a handful of albums and were still extant into the millenium. But these three bands are not only the cream of the Italian prog scene, they are three of the better bands in all of prog rock in the 1970’s.\n\nPFM are the widest known in the States, with multiple releases in the UK and America. Banco was also on the Manticore label like PFM and saw two releases in America. Le Orme didn’t get much exposure outside of Italy, but due to longevity they are always included in the Big 3. PFM are the easiest to find, and will bring the richest rewards, exemplifying perfectly the Italian sound-flute, violin, Moog synth (they owned the very first Moog sold in Italy) slashing electric guitars, gentle classical guitars, furious drumming-this band was the quickest to assimilate their influences and forge their own sound over a five year period from 1971-1976. Everyone should have their early releases, especially the seminal debut, Storia di Un Minuto, an album for fans of early Trespass-Foxtrot Genesis. I’d had Cook as one of my first 40 albums back in the day, but seeing them live last year in Italy was revelatory-they are able to play still to this day with a precision that no survivors of the UK prog scene can come close to. (Yes being unable to play their own material anymore comes to mind.)\n\nEveryone should get these on top of the two pictured earlier-Live ‘Cook’ and Photos of Ghosts for a total of six essential albums. Celebration (e Festa in Italian original) is perhaps their best known song, their ‘Freebird’ or ‘Stairway to Heaven’ if you will. Most in Italy are familiar with this tune. It is a whirling dervish tarantella infused dance of pure joy-E Festa!\n\nNote: the La Carozza di Hans/Impressioni di Settembre single (1971) is something hardcore PFM fans should try to find, their first 45 contains early and different versions of two songs later recorded on their debut. The earliest known recording of PFM. Why these have never been on a cd or box set is mystifying. Worth looking for.\n\nBanco del Mutuo Soccorso is the band that Italians lean towards when asked about the essential premier Italian prog bands. Driven by dual keyboardist brothers Vittorio and Gianni Nocenzi, their sound is closer to an Italian ELP, with the powerful vocalist Francesco di Giacomo (pictured below). Their first US and UK release, the 4th lp entitled simply ‘Banco’ is the best place to start for newcomers, but their first four are absolutely essential listening. Their debut album is thought of by many Italians as the best release in all of Italian prog. I’d be hard pressed to disagree.\n\nHere is a taste of the ELP influenced Banco with one of the better songs from their 4th album:\n\nThe last of the big three is Le Orme, who were one of the first bands to successfully transition from psych to prog when they ditched their 60’s era psychedelic trappings of Ad Gloriam to adopt a sound heavily influenced by the Nice and ELP in 1971 with one of the first examples of genuine Italian prog, the groundbreaking album Collage. The follow up in 1972 , L’Uomo di Pezza brought them deeper in their own sound, but it was 1973’s Felona e Serona that gave them international exposure. Charisma Records in the UK issued this album with English lyrics written by Peter Hammill-this is one of the top albums of Italian prog, and the Italian version is even more powerful. (I did drive around a lot in the 80’s in my car to an Italian cassette of Collage for a while there.)\n\nAll four of these are highly recommended, especially the fourth one Contrappunti from 1974, one of my personal favorites-newcomers might want to try this one to start. Here is a taste:\n\nWhere Do I Go Next?\n\nOnce you get past the Big 3 and still want more, there are some seminal bands that rival anything the UK had to offer:\n\nArea\n\nFirst stop should definitely be this band. Active from 1972-1979, Area were a unique band in the Italian prog scene-a perfect fusion of jazz, anarchy, prog and middle eastern scales blend to create something distinctly unique in the scene. For many they stand head and shoulders ahead of the pack. Led by the pyrotechnic vocalist Demetrio Stratos (who passed away in 1979 at his peak) they have always been one of my favorite Italian bands over the last thirty years. Insanely influential and highly recommended. These below are the ones you should get immediately. Start with the live album Areazione.\n\nSome of my favorite Italian albums to this day\n\nMuseo Rosenbach\n\nUsually sits atop everyone’s list of ‘best ever Italian prog’ albums, this is a very rare one and done band that delivered a masterpiece of Italian prog in 1973, and then disappeared. Heavier than many of their contemporaries, not for fans of Barclay James Harvest or similar lightweight UK prog bands. Highly recommended but getting really hard to find-vinyl copies fetch over $1,000 and later reissues now can go for nearly $200. Hard to compare these guys to anybody? Jethro Tull overachieving in UK progressive riffland comes close. A must for RPI fans.\n\nNew Trolls\n\nThis is the band people usually quickly discover after the Big 3. They are another band that transitioned from the beat era (originally the Trolls-they opened for the Beatles on their final tour) The New Trolls Concerto Grosso from 1971 is one of the biggest selling prog albums in Italian rock history, still in print to this day. They were able to mix symphonic themes with dirty electric guitars in a way none of their contemporaries were able to. The band split in half after their masterful Ut album, with keyboardist Vittorio De Scalzi taking the symphonic with him into the N.T. Atomic System, and guitarist Nico di Palo taking the whole rest of the band with him to form a band known as ‘?’ due to the band leaders fighting over who legally owned the name. If you like a bit of raw rock inside your prog-Ut will be your place to start. Everyone however should own Concerto Grosso per i New Trolls-often considered a masterpiece of prog. Think of a schizophrenic symphonic Jethro Tull with Tony Iommi as guitarist. Great band.\n\nGoblin\n\nThis is a band that was unknown outside of Italy (or horror film fans) until recently when they did several tours in the US and UK. Kind of unique in sound, Goblin are hard to categorize-sometimes veering close to cheesy-they usually maintain a solid creepy instrument prog vibe that is bolstered by some impressive musicianship. Their heyday was 1975-1977. I’d discovered them in the early 80’s and I’ve seen them live several times since 2012 when they became suddenly in vogue with hipsters. Every time though? They never failed to amaze. They are most famous for their soundtrack to Suspiria. Beginners should seek their greatest hits, which covers a large chunk of their better stuff. If you like that? Here are a few more to dig into. Roller is their studio album while most of their LPs are film soundtracks. Very distinct in style, they are similar to a possessed Mike Oldfield. Look for their precursor band Cherry Five, who sound more like a Yes tinged version of Goblin, with English lyrics.\n\nOsanna\n\nOsanna are another band that few outside of Italy have heard of, despite a couple of album releases in the States. Their third album, Palepoli from 1973, is a masterpiece of not only Italian prog, but the whole progressive rock scene itself. They opened for Genesis in 1971 on their first tour, and it’s hard to imagine what Peter Gabriel thought of these theatrical and make up clad madmen, but shortly after that tour, Peter starting wearing make up and elaborate stage costumes hmmm. Their first album (L’Uomo) might be too raw for symphonic prog fans, as it veers heavily into second album Hawkwind territory, but their third and fourth album (Palepoli and Landscape of Life) are essential to any Italian prog collection. If you like out of control King Crimson and Van der Graaf Generator with a touch of Hawkwind acid madness, this is up your alley.\n\nIl Balletto di Bronzo\n\nTheir second album, Ys, from 1972 is another album that is often seen in the top three best Italian prog album lists. I tend to agree-one of the earliest and best synthesis of symphonic and genuine rock stylings. This shares a common motif with many of the better albums of this era, the album is essentially one song spread over two sides (think Thick as a Brick). This is a band I wish I’d encountered a long time ago. A bit of Van der Graaf, but overall this is one of the more frightening takes on symphonic prog in the Italian scene, and I do agree this is one of the best releases in RPI. Not for the faint of heart, but a killer album nonetheless.\n\nDelirium\n\nLike the New Trolls, this is another band that many encounter early on in their expanding RPI search. They are really a tale of two bands-the first with frontman Ivano Fossati on their four singles and debut lp Dolce Acqua, and then post Fossati when they lost a bit of their charisma but became more traditionally prog sounding. Jesahel (video above) is what they are known for, but many in the States have heard a bit of this band. Though I’ve managed to find all of the albums in this whole article on vinyl, their double CD anthology is highly recommended as it contains all three of their albums and all four of their hard to find 45s. I honestly prefer the Fossati era as his vocals and flute playing made the band what they are-an acoustic guitar based Italian powerhouse, but others are drawn to the second and third albums from 1973 and 1974 which are more UK prog influenced-a bit of King Crimson and Van der Graaf derived.\n\nFossati era 45’s 1971-1972, all non LP tracks\n\nOnly Dolce Acqua has Ivano Fossati\n\nThis is the collection that has everything they did on 2 CDs\n\nFurther Down the Rabbit Hole Sound Good?\n\nIf the dozen or so albums above have only whet your appetite for more, here are some fantastic albums that I’d consider essential to a larger RPI collection:\n\nMetamorfosi\n\nA great ELP influenced album from 1973 with a touch of PFM included. Two side long songs based on Dante’s Inferno. Great moog work-little to no guitars. Italian vocals but overall has a sound easily recognizable by UK prog fans. Vocalist Jimmy Spitaleri has an operatic touch.\n\nArti e Mestieri\n\nThis album is a great hybrid of RPI and jazz rock-amazing instrumental prowess is on display including the drumming of Furio Chirico, one of the busiest drummers in rock history-this guy would give Bruford a run for his money. Minimal vocals, blistering guitar runs. I’d owned a poorly recorded 1974 concert CD in the early 90’s and didn’t really get what they were up to, but this crisply recorded album is excellent-one of my favorite albums in RPI. Sounds a bit like top flight Jean-Luc Ponty taken for a ride by PFM. Their second album, Giro di Valzi per Domani, while not quite as good as Tilt, is worth picking up too.\n\nMaxophone\n\nThis album came out late in the prog scene, 1975, and didn’t really get the attention they deserved. This album also exists in an English language version as well as the original Italian version, so there were obvious plans to break them internationally. One of the more UK traditional prog sounding bands, they can effortlessly slip from ELP to Genesis to King Crimson to PFM, sometimes in a single song. Good one for prog newcomers to RPI.\n\nJumbo\n\nLed by the very distinctly Italian vocalist Alvaro Fella who sounds like he gargles with gravel and brings new meaning to the phrase ‘world weary’. Very Jethro Tull influenced with strong flute passages, second album DNA in 1972 was an exponential leap from their debut. The third album, Veitato Ai Minori di 18 Anni? is more daring, with elements of Amon Duul 2, King Crimson and PFM flowing through a very complex album that veers into a bit of experimental stuff bordering on Faust. Some is similar to 1970-1972 Genesis (albeit with a surly Italian madman confronting you personally instead of Gabriel). Great stuff.\n\nLocanda delle Fate\n\nThis album from 1977 came out far too late (in the changing tastes of European rock as punk was starting to rear its head everywhere) to get the attention it clearly deserved. Their only album, Forse Le Lucciole Non Si Amano Piu, is one that I’ve seen at the top of the list of best Italian prog albums. I’d not go that far, but this one is highly recommended for UK prog fans-deft classical passages from this highly talented 7 piece band has all the pieces prog fans will love=two Moog players, flute, acoustic and electric guitars, Hammond, vibraphone…maybe a little too polite for fans leaning more to the mayhem end of rock, but still one hell of an album that is essential to any RPI collection.\n\nCampo di Marte\n\nReleased in 1973, this album is the only release from this band. Influenced by PFM (much like many Italian bands of the class of 1973) and a bit of Tull, they are capable of some heavy rocking guitar sections, but also gentle pastoral sections similar to Quella Vecchia Locanda (think early Genesis). A clever synthesis of styles-Deep Purple, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull all swirled into a fairly original result.\n\nBiglietto per L’inferno\n\nThis band released this masterpiece hampered only by being recorded in a low end studio. Baffo Banfi, later more well known as a kosmische German synth guy in the vein of Klaus Schulze came from this band. Very dense and very Italian-they know how to rock out in their complex arrangements. Elements of early proto prog like Uriah Heep and Deep Purple mix with PFM and Jethro Tull stylings, but overall they are pretty original. Can be jarring for fans of pure pastoral symphonic prog, but one of my absolute favorite Italian bands. Singer Claudio Canali was know for spontaneously jumping in the air during peaks of live performances, pictured on the album cover. They did record a second album that didn’t get released until decades later. Look for that one if you dig this.\n\nIl Rovescio Della Medaglia\n\nThey shortened the name to RDM for the US release of the above album- called Contamination in that release. Get this one in Italian if you can, their third album. It boasts better sonics and is a crisper recording. Their first two lps are guitar heavy Zeppelin-esque proto prog workouts. They added a keyboardist for Contaminazione and delivered one of the best prog albums of the era. Known for being the loudest band in Italy (the only band in Italy to own a full size USA stadium deafening PA), these guys got derailed when all their equipment was stolen out of their truck and never recovered. Also known for having a large cast bronze medallion (medaglia) as part of their second album cover, now an insanely rare collectible.\n\nL’Uovo Di Colombo\n\nThis album was the band’s only release in the magic year of 1973. A great band that is one of the better ‘one and done’ outfits in Italian prog rock. Tony Tartarini was the singer in Cherry Five, and they can be thought of as a more sprightly version of Le Orme. ELP is also a reference point, but it is one of my top ten RPI albums. Excellent musicianship throughout.\n\nAlphataurus\n\nSimilar to Campo Di Marte, excellent organ, guitar, flute and especially dexterous Moog runs create one of the better RPI albums. It is widely ranging and would definitely appeal to prog fans unfamiliar with Italian stuff. Complex drumming and organ arrangements. Bits of Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, Trick of the Tail era Genesis and of course, PFM run through this little known masterpiece, their only release. It also came out in the magic year of 1973.\n\nQuella Vecchia Locanda\n\nFor some reason, these guys get overlooked on many lists. Their first two albums are essential to any RPI collection. A little early Genesis, some early King Crimson, some PFM, both the album above, Il Tempo Della Gioia, and their self titled first album took a while before they both grew on me as fairly mind blowing. It took many listenings, so if they don’t grab you instantly, there is a subtlety you will find later.\n\nRocky’s Filj\n\nAnother one and done band, this is a masterpiece of jazz tinged prog rock. Led by madman, saxophonist and lead vocalist Rocky Rossi this album from 1973 is one the better prog albums from any county, not just Italy. Gentle Giant complexities filtered through Soft Machine and Van der Graaf Generator and King Crimson make this mini masterpiece an essential stop for those delving deeper into RPI.\n\nLatte e Miele\n\nA trio that is very in the ELP mould like Le Orme’s early work, they put out two fairly essential albums, Passio secundum Mattheum, an album that essentially sets church themes to a progressive rock background. (they played this album live to the Pope in 1972 (!) in St Peters Square). The follow up, Papillon, is a concept album that ditches the religious trappings and rocks a bit more. Both are worthy. There’s a third lp that is more traditional prog with a new line up that followed in 1975.\n\nSemiramis\n\nA nearly perfect album in the RPI field-it has everything. It is hard to believe this was recorded by teenagers it is so sophisticated. It is also yet another one and done band. Unlike many of their contemporaries, these guys disappeared from the music scene after delivering this masterpiece in 1973. Elements of Jethro Tull, Yes, Banco run through. Dedicato a Franz is amazing, it has complicated and evolving-sections flowing easily and they don’t clutter things up with excessive soloing. From 1973.\n\nNuova Idea\n\nOne of the first proto prog bands in 1971, they arguably started a format that many Italian bands to come followed: one side long song that is their proggiest, with side two showcasing three songs that are more pop oriented. It is astounding how many bands followed this rigid format in the next two years. The side long song on the first album was Come Come Come, oddly based on Macbeth, that introduced listeners to the side long song format, mainstreaming it to a certain extent. This song gained them a bit of popularity across the country, while the follow ups Mr E Jones and Clowns rounded out their solid three album arc.\n\nDenouement-the Jazz Rock Era\n\nLike much of the prog rock ,movement in England, as 1973 ticked into 1974, many bands turned towards jazz rock or fusion. A dedicated few started out in this mode, some bands were thrown together from different disbanded outfits. For some bands they really hit their stride once they shifted, for others it signaled the end of something special and the beginning of a decline into facelessness and generic instrumental workouts. Even PFM was bitten by this bug on 1977’s Jet Lag. Some of these are fantastic, rivaling Soft Machine in originality, some are a bit soporific. Here is a sampling:\n\nPFM-Jet Lag (1977) Their album when they moved to LA and went jazz rock at the advice of their label. Shows signs of LA slickness that infected the music industry in the late 70’s. Still flashes of greatness, but this is usually the last one anyone buys.\n\nCincinnato-Cincinnato (1974) A great mostly instrumental album with a side long suite that straddles the line between jazz and intricate instrumental 90’s jam band brilliance with great guitar runs.\n\nDedalus-Dedalus (1973) Very Soft Machine influenced masterpiece. A little Hatfield and the North, a little Weather Report, and a lot of brilliant technique. Electric guitar, sax, Fender Rhodes, and electric cello set these guys apart.\n\nNova-Blink (1975) A super group with members of Cervello, Osanna and Circus 2000 made several fusion albums, of which this is the best. Their next album, Vimana, was a collaboration with most of Brand X.\n\nPerigeo-La Valle Dei Templi (1975) One of the best jazz fusion bands to come out of Italy, and this is probably their best album. The band were all jazz trained musicians in the 60’s, which gave Perigeo an authenticity in delivery other similar pure fusion bands lacked. They have several excellent albums that hold their own with the best of the top tier UK and US fusion bands.\n\nDuello Madre-Duello Madre (1973) Another supergroup with members of Il Volo, Osage Tribe, Nuovo Idea, Circus 2000. An example of something that on paper should be brilliant but ends up with less than inspired jazz rock jams.\n\nIl Baricentro – sconcerto (1976) This is another band that on paper should have been amazing, coming out of the ashes of the highly underrated band, Festa Mobile, who put out a single little known progressive rock classic in 1973. But here, they have degenerated into a faceless jazz fusion band that borders on the soporific. Their second album is slightly better.\n\nThe Essential 100 Album List\n\nthese albums would be the starting point for a solid Italian prog collection. Some are easier to find than others. While some can still be found as original vinyl pressings without spending a month’s rent, some original pressings here run well into the thousands of dollars. Most have been reissued in the last 25 years on vinyl and cd. Luckily, everything is out there to listen to online if you poke around. If there is a choice between and English and Italian language version, grab the Italian one.\n\nAcqua Fragile-Acqua Fragile (1973)\n\nAcqua Fragile-Mass Media Stars (1974) PFM’s vocalist from Chocolate Kings came from here, a must for Chocolate Kings fans.

All of these I have tracked down on vinyl, and 50 or so as an original Italian release, prima stampa. But one thing-take a look at how many albums came out in 1973- (26 lps) that is a ton of top shelf prog to come out in a single year. To be in Italy in 1972 or 1973? Woah.\n\nWhat’s In A Name?\n\nItalian prog bands have some of the longest band names in the history of rock. Why? Nobody is sure. Raccomandata Con Ricevuta Di Ritorno (registered letter with notice of receipt), Locanda Delle Fate, Quella Vecchia Locanda, Reale Accademia di Musica, Rovescio Della Medaglia….At least two of those bands had the good sense to choose to abbreviate their name-RDM for US consumption and RRR because even Italians had problems with that name.\n\nA quick dip into things I found funny as I got deeper into RPI. For those who speak only English, the band names in Italian prog can be bewildering and sound mysterious. But upon translation……\n\nPremiata Forneria Marconi -who knew it meant ‘Award Winning Marconi Bakery’? Not me.\n\nArti e Mestieri – art and mystery? Nope, it means arts and crafts\n\nBanco Del Mutuo Soccorso- a guy in a record store in Italy corrected the common translation of ‘bank of mutual assistance’ to a simpler one: ‘pawnshop’\n\nLe Orme – always thought this was a medieval term for ‘the worm’. Nope, it means ‘footsteps’\n\nLatte e Miele – had some great cool guesses. It actually means milk and honey\n\nMost of the time, I liked the mystery better I think.\n\nItalian Vinyl\n\nSome have kept repeating through the decades that Italian vinyl pressings are not great quality. While that can be true for some of the tinier labels, most larger Italian labels have immaculate pressings-sonically vibrant in a way that the re=pressings of the post 2000’s era can’t really capture.\n\nThere was also an attention to detail in Italian album covers that US and UK releases rarely saw. Gimmick die cut covers were rare in the the UK and US, but shaped covers, elaborate cut outs, foldout pieces revealing things underneath, metal medallions, 3D effects, paper slide out additions, gold foil covers…various textured covers were the order of the day in Italy. Genuine artistic elements were a strong part of many albums in the 1971-1974 era.\n\nIn terms of collectibility, Italian prog vinyl from the 70’s can be daunting in price. At least fifteen of the albums on the top 100 list above trade in the $1,000-$3,000 range, and another dozen grab $200-$400 regularly in their original pressings. You don’t get these kind of rarities in UK or US prog outside of little known private pressings.\n\n60,000 gathered in Milan for a multi band tribute to Demetrio Stratos-1979\n\nConclusions\n\nSo we have reached the end. It is difficult to disagree with the conclusion many have finally arrived at in the 2000’s: Italy had the best progressive rock scene on the planet, and produced a field that not only rivals, but exceeds their UK founding fathers in many ways. Something so inherently different that comparisons to UK prog bands can be difficult and many Italian bands are almost only categorizable in comparison to each other. This is an important point. The Italian prog scene is often dismissed in comparison to the UK prog scene, but what’s not discussed is that these guys created a whole new sound, uniquely distinct from any British music, however influenced to start. Jethro Tull, ELP, Genesis, Van der Graaf Generator and King Crimson put a heavy stamp on the Italian psyche in 1969-1972 that launched a country wide turn to progressive rock that is hard to imagine as Americans or Brits-it was everywhere. But somehow the message never really escaped the Italian shores. Let’s fix that."
