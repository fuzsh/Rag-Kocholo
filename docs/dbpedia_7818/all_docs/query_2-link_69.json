        "text": "Artist - Title PandorasBox vinyl-list 06-2006 Year of recording Label / Country Style Price No. Country of origin 3SPEED AUTOMATIC 2004 Nasoni / GER Psych Rock 16,00 € LP - VILLA ROCKA - (black) NR 031 bl NL 3piece band from The Netherlands with a pretty intense brew of stoner rock, raunchy wah-wah propelled biker rock, sleazy hard rock and psychedelics. The B-side features the exclusively recorded soundtrack of the Dutch cult movie 'Horizonica'... heavy soundscapes, accentuated by some flamenco-blend accoustic guitars, organ and spaced-out effects which brings Groep 1850's \"Agemo's trip to mother earth\" in mind. Black vinyl edition limited to 400 copies 3SPEED AUTOMATIC LP - VILLA ROCKA - (coloured) Coloured vinyl edition limited to 100 copies 2004 Nasoni / GER Psych Rock 19,00 € NR 031 col NL A-CADS 1966 Thorns / EEC 60's Beat 17,90 € LP - Hungry for love Thorns 6011 ZA Excellent GARAGE/BEAT album from '66 by South African band 'A-CADS'. Their influence was evident as they had 2 immigrants from the UK in the band. ABDUL-MALIK, AHMED 1960 RCA / US Jazz World 15,00 € LP - EAST MEETS WEST - (180G) RCAH 2015 USA US pressing. RCA, 1960. A brilliant mix of jazz and world music! Abdul-Malik was the legendary bass player from the fifties who mixed straight jazz playing with traditional Middle Eastern rhythms -- and although he most famously recorded albums with Monk as a regular bassist, his albums on his own are amazing blends of jazz and world music, done years before anyone else had contemplated doing so! This album is similar to Abdul-Malik's Jazz Sahara album, in which he plays quite a bit on the Oud -- but in this one the ensemble is much more jazz-oriented, and features Lee Morgan, Curtis Fuller, Benny Golson, and Johnny Griffin. The Oud holds center stage on most tracks, but then it drops out, and Morgan and Griffin come wailing in on solos that will rip your socks off! Titles include \"Rooh\", \"La Ibky\", \"Takseem\", \"Searchin\", and \"El Ghada\". ACTION, The 1965-6 Circle Records / UK 60's Beat Psych 24,90 € LP - UPTIGHT AND OUTASIGHT CPWL 105 UK Limited Numbered Edition of 1000 only worldwide! From it's inauguration as an exclusive and elitist clique centered in London and it's immediate suburbs, the mod movement had by the early 60's germinated to a point where British groups were flourishing to entertain it's growing legions.The mods' original musical palette oozed black soul and rhythm and blues and since in the less cosmopolitan world of the time it's perpetrators rarely ventured beyond their home base of the U.S.A, a blossoming of indigenous talent to sate the demand for live R&B and soul was inevitable. The mod riots, 'Ready Steady Go' and the emergence of Tamla Motown as a commercially successful force exasperated the phenomenon and expanded mod into a national and indeed mercantile culture, which ignited a further engendering of mod or mod styled groups. Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds and Long John Baldry's Hoochie Coochie Men to name but a few had paved the way but in 1965,a genus of more visually appealing bands had or were achieving a profile. Despite their mostly manufactured mod image the Who were the movement's most distinctive standard bearers but from the ranks of mod itself there emerged two bands in particular who for many of their own and subsequent generations, defined and epitomized the British mod group - The Small Faces and The Action.
