        "text": "See what you think. No comparison, IMO. The original RCA CD clearly had tapes good tapes in this case, and probably flat transferred them.\n\nVersion 1:\n\nRCA Italy (ND 71781)\n\nhttp://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=download&ufid=D83AA73F0FE94B7B\n\nVersion 2:\n\nVictor Japan K2 mini lp CD (VICP-62744)\n\nhttp://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=download&ufid=24DEB4A73873172E\n\nVersion 3:\n\nVictor Japan K2 HD mini lp (VICP-63230)\n\nhttp://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=download&ufid=53266331291256F3\n\nThere are two other versions that I am aware of. The 24-bit RCA Gold CD from Italy, and the 24-bit BMG Japan mini lp. The RCA Gold was okay, from what I remember, the BMG Japan is a hard limited mess.\n\nI don't know the source of the RCA CD. None of those old RCA pressings have any info. Some were needle drops with treble cut!! But that doesn't seem to be the case here. They had tapes and I suspect this album was made with Dolby A, so it isn't all that hissy.\n\nIsn't it funny comparing version 2 and 3? I mean, Victor Japan is charging more for this so-called K2 \"High Definition\" 24-bit mastering, and it's actually a downgrade to my ears.\n\nI have versions 1 and 2, and have been looking for the Gold digipak version for a while for comparisions sake.\n\nPFM were great! \"Per Un Amico\" was their best, IMO. Great stuff!\n\nBtw, what's with that cover for \"Chocolate Kings?\" Is that the grossest photo ever or what? I much prefer the US cover to that Italian one.\n\nDid you try here? if it's not listed you could still ask them if there are any out there somewhere.\n\nhttp://www.btf.it/\n\nJeff,\n\ncan you, please, repost the samples? The links do not work anymore.\n\nWhat kind of mess did you get with the BMG Japan CDs?\n\nDoes anyone have a sample of the RCA Gold CD?\n\nThanks,\n\nAl\n\nAl, forget the samples, just get the original RCA CD #ND 71781. It is easy to find and may still be in print. This is the best version of Chocolate Kings on CD.\n\nHmm, I bought both the JVC K2 and the RCA CDs.\n\nLanzetti's voice and Mussida's guitar are much more realistic on the JVC CD.\n\nIt seems that the original \"noise\" has been reduced too much on the the RCA CD\n\nAl\n\nNo, my guess is that the noise is increased on the K2 because of either a different source tape and/or compression, not \"reduced\" on the RCA. The RCA is a much better sounding disc, IMO. Very natural without the goosed up bottom end.\n\nNice packaging on the K2, though.\n\nSpeaking as one who mostly prefers original release cds that haven't been messed with, I have the RCA original cd and the BMG 24 bit gold version, remastered by Antonio La Rosa at Profile Studios Milan, and I prefer it over the original, I don't hear a 'boosted' bottom end, just more overall clarity.\n\nUnfortunately I've not seen the K2 version with better artwork.\n\nThis may be of interest:-\n\nhttp://www.italianprog.com/ + click PFM text.\n\nI am trying to find Antonio's Chocolate Kings but it seems impossible to find it new.\n\nI loved his work with Jet Lag, Storia di un minuto, Per un amico, and L'isola di niente. The best versions to my ears.\n\nAny idea where I could find a good used copy of Antonio's remastered Chocolate Kings?\n\nBTW, did Antonio La Rosa remaster other PFM CDs other those mentioned above?\n\nThanks,\n\nAl"
