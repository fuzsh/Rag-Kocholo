De Rossi E Bordini

Description:

Drummer Carlo Bordini, famous for his participation in the Cherry Five, Rustichelli & Bordini, and other great Italian symphonic albums of the 1970s, teams up with keyboardist Gianluca De Rossi, his partner since the reunion of the Cherry Five, for this latest release. Bordini's oddball rhythms are added to the ever-changing keyboards, and the result is a work with an Italian flavor that sounds like EL&P, Banco, and Metamorphosis all rolled into one. The new version of "NATIVITA" and two other songs by Rustichelli & Bordini are also worth listening to.
