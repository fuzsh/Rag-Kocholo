Mel Torme, a singer considered by many to have the smoothest voice in popular music, died Saturday.

Torme had suffered a stroke in 1996. He was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital at 1 a.m. Saturday and died of complications from that stroke shortly after.

Torme's nickname was "The Velvet Fog," and he had a reputation as a crooner of smooth tunes. However, he never liked the nickname and preferred to be considered a jazz singer.

He began his showbiz career at the age of four. He sang with the Coon-Sanders Orchestra in 1929 and with Buddy Rogers in the early 1930s. He made many film appearances, most of them in the 1940s.
