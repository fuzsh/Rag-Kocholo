        "text": "I listen to a fair amount of rock music (as well as some country, folk, pop, electronica), but the majority of the time I listen to classical and jazz. I rarely buy new classical albums, as I have my favorites and very little modern classical appeals to me.\n\nBut I am constantly listening to new jazz releases, sometimes several a day. Yet, despite that, it seems as if I barely scratched the surface, as 2023 saw numerous exceptional releases. Here are my favorites.’But I am constantly listening to new jazz releases, sometimes several a day.\n\nYet, despite that, it seems as if I barely scratched the surface, as 2023 saw numerous exceptional releases. Here are my favorites.\n\n• Shuteen Erendenbaater—Rising Sun. Born in Mongolia, this 25-year-old composer, pianist and arranger has quietly (or so it appears to me) produced one of the finest debut albums in jazz in recent years. It is, in a word, impeccable. If that sounds too clinical, add lyrical, melodic, captivating, brilliant, and really, really great.\n\nErendenbaater certainly has “chops,” but what’s most impressive here is the songwriting and ensemble playing; she is obviously a mature and confident band leader. Anton Mangold, who plays soprano and alto saxophones and flute, is very much a co-star; his playing is perfectly suited to the songs and provides an edge and rawness that mixes sublimely with Erendenbaater’s elegant, beautiful lines. Yes, impeccable and impressive. The opening song, “In a Time Warp,” is a great place to start; here it is being performed live for Bavarian National Radio.\n\n• Veronica Swift—Veronica Swift. It’s a real shame that the other Swift gets all the attention and fame, because this Swift has all the talent, versatility, and real swagger. Her 2019 album Confessions was top-notch and her 2021 Bitter Earth was brilliant and stunning. This self-titled album is eclectic, sophisticated, cocky, wild, and often startling; while not as poignant or emotionally wrenching as the edgy Bitter Earth, this is a chance for Swift to have some fun and to show that she can sing—well, let’s see—jazz (of course), rock, hard rock, pop, punk, R&B, Broadway, opera, and whatever else.\n\nIn fact, the idea behind the album is to rework songs in a style far removed from their original character. So, for example, the raw (okay, vulgar) Nine Inch Nails song “Closer” gets turned into a (PG-rated) face-melting funk/R&B tune with a scorching section of scatting (Swift is the finest scat singer around today and I think she rivals the great, including Ella and Mel Tormé). The Broadway tune “I Am What I Am” is reworked into a swinging jazz song that also features scatting—including a minutes of so of Swift scatting Bach. A favorite of mine is “Don’t Rain on My Parade”, from the 1964 musical Funny Girl and famously performed by a young Barbra Streisand, which Swift morphs into a Green Day-ish punk tune that is both smirky and joyous.\n\nThe presence of Freddie Mercury can be felt throughout, as two songs are Queen hits—”The Show Must Go On” and “Keep Yourself Alive”—reimagined, respectively, as a bossa nova-meets-Tin Alley tune and a bombastic blues number. Mercury would amused, I think, and impressed. I know that I am.\n\n• Espen Ericksen Trio and Andy Shepperd—As Good As It Gets. The 2018 collaboration of the stellar Norwegian jazz trio and UK sax giant Andy Sheppard, titled Perfectly Unhappy, was a gorgeous, haunting work. This new release continues the Scandinavian-meets-Britain brilliance, with a strong fire underneath the inherent melancholy. In many ways, this reminds me of the great Keith Jarrett European group with Jan Garbarek: the shimmering piano work undergirds the longing saxophone journeys, everything propelled by a certain leisurely restlessness that is distinctly Nordic in tone and British in character.\n\n• Benjamin Lackner—Last Decade. The legendary label ECM is both quite eclectic and yet almost immediately identifiable in terms of sound and aesthetic. The Germain-American pianist Lackner, joined by the fine Norwegian trumpet player Mathias Eick, has created a quintessential ECM album: slightly dark and pensive, perfectly played and with lots of space, featuring melodies that unfold with calm sureness. Lackner and Eick converse with attentive respect, like old friends discussing the mysteries of life, the songs expanding like sunlight slowing breaking through clouds, with moments of thoughtful intensity. One of the most beautiful albums of the year.\n\n• Joe Locke—Makram. The vibraphonist Locke has long established himself as one of the finest players around. I’ve enjoyed many of his albums, but this is surely my favorite. The compositions are consistently great, the playing is the same, and the production is 10/10; the detail in each tune is impressive and captures the richness of the playing. A reader on Locke’s Bandcamp page says that the album “is almost overwhelming in its multitude of colors, moods and sheer energy. The joy of playing music on a very high level with virtuosic musical excursions by all musicians of this coherent band is exciting and just infectious.” Perfectly stated. A underrated jazz gem for 2023.\n\n• Mohini Dey—Mohini Day. The Indian bass virtuoso, now in her late twenties, has been performing professionally since the age of 10. Little wonder: her technique, feel, playing, and musicality are simply stunning. She has played with a wide range of jazz, fusion, rock, funk, and world music groups, and seems to absorb and produce ideas and music like most people breathe air. Her debut album is, well, quite stunning. There is (of course) jazz, fusion, rock, funk, and world music. There is lots of energy (this is not background music); there are really good songs—this isn’t just a jam album. And the guest artists are of the highest order with, for example, Simon Phillips on drums and Guthrie Govan on guitar. There isn’t a dull or ordinary moment to be found.\n\nAlso recommended:\n\n• Kurt Rosenwinkel—Undercover (Live at the Village Vanguard)\n\n• Tingvall Trio—Birds\n\n• Emil Brandqvist Trio—Layers of Life\n\n• Joey Alexander—Continuance\n\n• Yussef Dayes—Black Classical Music\n\n• Jeremy Pelt—The Art of Intimacy, Vol 2: His Muse\n\n• Walter Smith III—return to casual\n\n• Kurt Elling and Charlie Hunter—SuperBlue: The Iridescent Spree\n\n• Pat Metheny—Dream Box\n\n• Affinity Trio—Hindsight\n\n• Eric Alexander—A New Beginning: Alto Saxophone with Strings\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n• Dimash Qudaibergen—Anything and Everything. This is the first time that the work of my favorite artist of a particular year is nearly impossible to find and buy. Good luck being able to track down CDs or even downloads. The reason for this strange situation highlights one of the many admirable and impressive qualities of this 30-year-old singer, performer, composer, multi-instrumentalist, and actor from Kazakhstan: he is fiercely independent and will not let himself be controlled by the usual powers in the music industry. Which means, in short, that Dimash (for the most part) has to be heard and viewed via YouTube and other online media (or, if you are able, in concert).\n\nMy introduction to Dimash came in early January 2023, when I watched this video of the then 22-year-old singer giving his first performance, of the French song “S.O.S d’un terrien en détresse”, on the popular Chinese show “I Am a Singer”. Like countless others, I was stunned, then transfixed, then ready for more (and, thankfully, there is much more).\n\nDimash has (depending on the source) a six or seven octave range, can sing in a variety of styles—operatic, popular, traditional, more—and usually does so in the course of a single song (and also sings in over a dozen languages). An exceptional example of this is the ambitious and powerful song “The Story of One Sky,” which Dimash wrote and performed, while also acting in the 12-minute-long video that came out in September 2022.\n\nAlthough Dimash has had several successful concerts in North America, he is, as far as I can tell, mostly ignored by the American media. Meanwhile, the banal and brain-numbingly boring muzak of Taylor Swift has turned her into a sort of singer/songwriter goddess here in the United States. Neither fact is surprising. That said, those who have never heard Dimash before will, I am certain, be stunned, transfixed, and ready for more.\n\n• The Warning—Error. This trio from Monterrey, Mexico consists of the three Villarreal Vélez sisters: Daniela (guitar, lead and backing vocals, piano), Paulina (drums, lead and backing vocals, piano), and Alejandra (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals). Now in their late teens and early twenties, the trio has been performing together for over a decade and has released three studio albums.\n\nError was released in 2022, but I include it here because, well, it’s so good and I first heard The Warning a few months ago. My first impression of these dynamic ladies was that they reminded me, in many ways, of Muse; it turns out that they have toured with Muse. Many of the same elements are there in abundance: great musicianship, exceptional hard rock songs that contain elements of metal and punk, fabulous vocals and harmonies, and lots of energy. Their August 2022 concert at “Teatro Metropólitan” is a perfect place to start, as The Warning is a captivating, well-honed live band. Favorites include “Disciple,” “Choke,” and “Money,” and their new single “More”.\n\nBut every song by the band is excellent, and many are great; there are clearly many hours of practice and work involved, and interviews reveal just how seriously the sisters take their craft. Lyrically, also, these three ladies are several cuts above, with an intriguing mixture of raw, cryptic, and even existential that belies their youth. A band to watch now and for years to come.\n\n• Van Morrison—Accentuate the Positive. The timeless Irish singer and songwriter, now 78 years young, continues a pace of recording that would put most young artists to shame (he now has 45 studio albums, with several live albums). His 2022 release What’s It Going to Take? was widely blasted by the usual suspects for its strong pushback against government overreach and media-induced hysteria during the height of COVID, but I thought the album (featuring all original songs) was solid. But there certainly was a dark and even dour aspect to it (how could there now be?) that is nowhere to be found on Morrison’s two 2023 releases, which consist of mostly covers of skiffle songs (Moving On Skiffle) and of rock and roll, R&B, and country favorites (Accentuate the Positive).\n\nThe latter is one of my favorites of the year; it is crisp, warm, energetic, and playful. Morrison’s voice is in great form, with a sinewy strength and casual slyness backed up by strong arrangements and adept, in-the-pocket playing. While projects like this can easily veer into nostalgic excess, there is an immediacy and lean focus here that avoids such dangers with ease. Besides, Morrison’s music has always looked back—there’s a reason he refers to “Jelly Roll” on his classic 1970 album Moondance—while pushing forward with creative restlessness, and that loving tension makes for another excellent addition to an already staggeringly great catalog.\n\n• Bruce Soord—Luminescence. This is perhaps the most surprising pop/rock album of the year for me: a set of beautiful, contemplative songs that are sung and played with masterful control and understatement by the leader of the prog-rock group Pineapple Thief.\n\nI’ve enjoyed Soord’s fine work over the years, but this release really grabbed me from the first listen. There is a rather timeless mixture of heaviness and lightness here—both lyrically and musically—that is easy to underestimate. But numerous listens prove that this is a keeper, an album that I’ll be listening to for years to come.\n\nI say more about it in this recent Spirit of Cecilia discussion.\n\n• Greta van Fleet—Starcatcher. The Michigan band’s 2021 The Battle at Garden’s Gate won me over, as their mix of classic rock, prog, folk, and more found its stride, with a number of well-written and attractive tunes.\n\nStarcatcher builds on that success, but eschews a more commercial direction (certainly a temptation, I would think) for a more raw, semi-prog, and expansive course. The musicianship and vocal prowess continue to grow, and that means there are subtleties and layers here that reward multiple listens.\n\nWhile the Led Zep comparisons will continue, it’s obvious to me that GVF is a band that has absorbed a wide range of influences (band members cite their love of jazz, Motown, world music, etc) and will continue to experiment and expand their musical and lyrical palette. To my ears, there is as much early Rush (and perhaps even early Queen) in the mix as Plant and Page. A strong release with many sonic pleasures contained within.\n\n• Steven Wilson—The Harmony Codex. Speaking of sonic pleasures, this is one of the best-sounding releases of 2023, which comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with the many talents of Wilson, who is almost as famous for his mixing and producing as he is for his writing and playing.\n\nI know that a fair number of Wilson/Porcupine Tree fans have strong (and even harsh) debates over the merits of respective Wilson albums, but I don’t have the time or energy for those squabbles. I simply enjoyed listening to this album many times after it was released, without any expectations or many comparisons.\n\nThe 11-minute prog-jazz-electronica-fest “Impossible Tightrope” is a favorite, perhaps because I listen to a fair amount of fusion-y, electronica-tinged jazz, or because I like strange rock-ish music that refuses to go where you expect it to go. This is an aural adventure, and as such, it delivers.\n\nAlso recommended:\n\n• Soen—Memorial\n\n• Extreme—Six\n\n• Mystery—Redemption\n\n• Big Wreck—Pages\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSeal’s debut album, featuring the hit “Crazy”, was released on May 24, 1991. I first heard it in early September 1991, having just moved to Portland, Oregon. I was living with my cousin and his wife, who had the CD, probably because of “Crazy”. I still recall seeing it and, being curious and alone in the house, turning it on and turning it up (they had a nice stereo system). The funky groove of “The Beginning” was compelling out of the gate, but it That Voice—that’s what got my attention immediately. “Who the heck is this guy?” I thought. I was hooked. Turns out the album was produced by Trevor Horn (who I knew from my interest in Yes), who also produced “Seal” (1994) and “Human Being” (1998). Those three albums, for me, are about as perfect of a popular music trio as one will find. (Seal’s 1991 debut, for the record, has sold over 5 million copies.)\n\nWhile Seal remains in very fine singing form (and has some fun moment’s as a coach on Australia’s “The Voice”), his material since 2000 has not, in my opinion, lived up to the heights set by those three first releases; there have certainly been strong moments, but a lack of consistency.\n\nAll of which is a preface to one of my favorite releases of 2022: the 45-song Seal Deluxe 1991. I wanted to splurge on the 4 CD, 2 vinyl set, but I instead opted for the less expensive digital download. There is much here for the devoted and casual fan. First, the album is immaculately produced and recorded; it is an aural treasure, with a really stunning mixture of electronic and acoustic sound. Secondly, That Voice. Seal is one of the finest pop vocalists of the past 30 years, able to navigate rock, funk, dance, soul, R&B, jazz, folk, and just about everything else. (He is also a great songwriter, as Rick Beato explains in detail here.) Third, the album is remixed (disc 1), there are acoustic versions and remasters of premixes of the album (disc 2), a wide range of remastered special remixes (disc 3), and a fascinating early live set from late 1991, in Dublin (disc 4).\n\nThe latter has excellent sound, catching Seal in a bit more raw form than his later (and also exceptional) 2005 live set from Paris and showing his willingness to experiment with different approaches. (I’m not sure of the personnel, but the drummer is on fire.) My wife and I saw Seal in concert on November 30, 1994, at the Schnitzer in Portland, and it was one of the finest live shows I’ve seen. The only complaint was that he played only uptempo tunes, foregoing crowd favorites such as “Violet”, which is a stunning piece of jazz-pop-folk. But when it comes to this exceptional set, I have no complaints at all. Is it possible that a similar compilation is in the works for “Seal” (1994)? One can dream (in metaphors or otherwise).\n\nI know that I’d heard of o.R.k. in recent years, but I also know that “Screamnasium” is the first album I’ve heard by the band. Which is surprising, because this is the fourth release by the supergroup, which is fronted by Italian singer/all-around-creative-force LEF (short for Lorenzo Esposito Fornasari), the legendary Pat Mastelotto (King Crimson, Mr. Mister) on drums, Colin Edwin (Porcupine Tree) on bass, and Carmelo Pipitone (Marta sui Tubi) on guitar. This is not prog, although there are plenty of weird notes and chords and song structures. Imagine a crazy but cohesive love child of Soundgarden, Jeff Buckley, King Crimson, Muse, and … other stuff. The playing, singing, and writing is dynamic, powerful, and melodic. Like Soundgarden, the songs are both dark and oddly upbeat (the band insists the album is a work of optimism, which comes through more like flashes of light rather than via upbeat tunes). Pipitone lays down both wonderful, angular riffs and broad atmospherics, and the Edwin/Mastelotto rhythm section is supple, strong, and never simple. And the vocal performances by LEF are, at times, startling in their power, precision, clarity, and range. This is a keeper.\n\nSpeaking of Porcupine Tree, HeWhoPlaysAndWritesAndProducesEverything Steven Wilson regrouped with keyboardist Richard Barbieri and drummer Gavin Harrison for a somewhat surprising and completely stellar outing titled Closure/Continuation. It’s all there: the surging guitars, electronic swells, dynamic changes, warm production, distinctive vocals, perfect drumming. “Dignity” is a personal favorite, but every song here is above average. I’ve long appreciated Wilson’s special brand of genre-blurring genius, but this recent interview with Rick Beato took it to another level; it’s a must view for anyone with interest in music and creativity.\n\nThe Mars Volta is a group that has been rather maddening to me: some of their songs resonate immediately and deeply (“The Widow” for example, from Frances The Mute), but I’ve struggled with entire albums. There was something about frenetic approach that exhausted me, even while I was always impressed by the remarkable playing and singing. They won me over with “The Mars Volta”, which I suspect has polarized hardcore fans, as it is (gasp) very much a pop album. But, of course, a most distinctive one, as one would expect from guitarist/producer Omar Rodríguez-López and vocalist/lyricist Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocals, lyrics). The songs are short and mostly “normal” in structure; there aren’t any wild guitar out bursts or dissonance. Instead, there is a restrained, focused artistry at work, with subtle (but often complex) rhythms, lovely soundscapes, a wealth of textures, and a distinct thread of Latin beats and sounds (and lyrics, from the multi-lingual Bixler-Zavala). “Vigil” is a personal favorite: it seems rather slight at first, but builds a gorgeous melody that is then punctuated by short bursts of guitar and a simple but very effective bridge. A remarkable example of a band achieving greater emotional power by focusing on the basics.\n\nThe last time King’s X put out an album, I was in my thirties and singer/bassist dUg Pinnock was in his late fifties (he’s now 72); that was 14 years ago. I’ve been a big fan of the band since I first heard “Gretchen Goes to Nebraska” in 1989. Their 1990 release “faith hope love” remains one of my favorite rock albums; it is, arguably, the creative high point for the band. But there have been plenty of highlights, even if Pinnock, guitarist Ty Tabor and drummer Jerry Gaskill have never received the recognition they deserved. “Three Sides of One” sounds both fresh and distinctly King’s X—the vocals and harmonies are fully intact and right up front; Tabor’s riffs and solos are strong and crisp, and the bottom end is as funky and robust as ever. There are a couple of so-so moments song-wise, but there are also very strong, peak moments, notably “Give It Up” and “All God’s Children”. Definitely one of the best musical surprises of 2022.\n\n“Will of the People”, Muse’s 2022 follow-up to 2018’s “Simulation Theory” still has plenty of electronic “stuff” going on, but it feels decidedly warmer and more human than its predecessor, which veered into self-parody territory. Part of the warmth and immediacy is due to two simple but gripping ballads, “Ghosts (How Can I Move On?)” and “Verona”. (The official video for the latter is worth watching.) Of course, there are the big anthems—”Will of the People” and “Won’t Stand Down”—but they are also more immediate, with classic Muse riffs that morph into heavy metal and industrial sounds to great effect. Matt Bellamy’s vocals continue to amaze; yes, the range and power, but also the vulnerable ache and pull. The 2006 album “Black Holes and Revelations” remains my personal favorite, but this is a very solid album with several exceptional moments.\n\nThe Norwegian rock quintet Maraton somehow came onto my radar this year with “Unseen Color,” which has elements of Leprous and Gazpacho. Whereas Muse has, I think, struggled at times to use electronic beats and sounds in an organic fashion, Maraton uses them to powerful effect, blending guitar and heavy electronic soundscapes with near perfection. The songs are uniformly strong and often unusual, with lyrics touching on existential literature (Kafka!) and mathematics, carried by the exceptional vocals of Fredrik Bergersen Klemp. While the parallel is not immediately obvious, the production and melding of vocals and electronica reminds me of trip hop/drum and bass duo Lamb. Worth checking out!\n\nAlter Bridge, which rose out (in part) of the ashes of Creed, is one of finest hard rock bands around, featuring the A-list vocals (and backing guitar) of Myles Kennedy, whose resume includes fusion jazz, singing lead for a guy named Slash, and a couple of great solo albums. Pawns & Kings is another notable release; in fact, it might be the band’s best, a perfect example of a band at the height of powers, confident in their identity and letting it fly. I think this is their most eclectic release, with the 8:22 cut “Fable of the Silent Son” demonstrating the full range of the band’s sonic mastery. Mark Tremonti, having released the best Sinatra tribute album in recent memory (more on that in my “favorite jazz of 2022” post, coming soon), shows that his guitar skills have not wavered and that his commitment to heaviness is, if anything, stronger than ever. As Rich Hobson of Classic Rock rightly sums it up: “Make no mistake about it – this is the Rolls-Royce of Alter Bridge records, and a high-water mark to which all rock hopefuls should aspire.”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is sad news (via Rolling Stone):\n\n“Robby Steinhardt, violinist and co-lead vocalist of the rock outfit Kansas, died Saturday, July 17th. He was 71.\n\n“Steinhardt’s wife, Cindy Steinhardt, confirmed his death on Facebook. Cindy said Steinhardt was admitted to the hospital with acute pancreatitis in May. Not long after, he went into acute septic shock and was placed on life support, and although the outlook was ‘very grave’ at the time, he managed to recover. However, several months later, just as he was about to be released from medical care and moved to a rehab center, Steinhardt suffered another sepsis.”\n\nSteinhart had suffered a massive and near fatal heart attack back in 2013 (which he discussed here, in a video well worth viewing), but eventually recovered. He was apparently finishing up recording on a new album at the time of his death.\n\nI rarely agree with Rolling Stone magazine on anything (politically or musically), but this is absolutely on the mark: “Steinhardt shared vocal duties with Walsh, with the pair switching between backup and lead; but it was Steinhardt’s violin that helped distinguish Kansas’ sound from other bands.”\n\nOf course, great bands, such as Kansas, are really bands; they are great because they are a marriage of many impressive talents. Phil Ehart is one of the most underrated drummers in rock history; Dave Hope was also underappreciated for his stellar bass play; Kerry Livgren is a musical genius; Steve Walsh, in his prime, was a searing vocalist. But Kansas would not have been Kansas without Steinhardt’s precise, emotive, classically-trained, American-drenched, haunting violin. It is what caught my ear when I first heard Kansas as a young teen. It was never a gimmick or an “add-on”; it was central to the band’s sound, as you can easily hear in all of the albums from the 1970s.\n\nOf those albums, my favorite (as hard as it is to choose) is 1975’s Song For America, which is a stunning brew of rooted rock, prog grandeur, spiritual restlessness (“Incomudro-Hymn to the Atman”!), and existential longing. Steinhardt’s playing is essential to the entire mix.\n\nTo be honest, I probably never appreciated Steinhardt enough as a vocalist as I should. His lead vocals, on songs such as “Lighting’s Hand” (on 1977’s classic Point of Know Return), are fantastic, with a rocking edge that contrasts with his pure (although often driving) violin-playing. His harmonies were also exceptional; he and Morse (the two band members not from Topeka, interestingly enough) melded together effortlessly, with perfect pitch, their tones and phrasing were key to that immediately recognizable Kansas sound.\n\nI do hope we will eventually be able to hear the album that Steinhardt was working on at the end. Outside of true-blue fans, he will likely never get his proper due. Kerry Livgren, in a 1992 interview, summed it up very well: “Robby had a totally unique function as a violinist, second vocalist, and MC in a live situation. Robby was the link between the band on the stage and the audience.”\n\nRest in peace, Robby.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLast week I put forth my favorite 20 jazz albums of 2020. Here are my favorite 20 albums of everything else: rock, country, prog, and, yes, sacred music.\n\n• “Companion” by Sainte Olympia: I’m biased here, as the singer, pianist, and songwriter here is my younger sister. Regardless, this is the anti-2020 album: contemplative, deceptively simply, deep, and rich with lyrical and melodic mystery. I’m both proud and moved by this release.\n\n• “The Nashville Songbook” by Mandy Barnett: Now in her forties, Barnett’s magical voice has become even more magnificent over time. This lush and often hair-raising record reveals that Barnett is also a top tier interpreter of classic songs. Magical!\n\n• “No One Sings Like You Anymore” by Chris Cornell: This was actually recorded in 2016, not long before his death. Cornell was multi-talented; what comes through here is, of course, that voice–but also a unique approach to interpreting songs, as all ten cuts are covers. ELO’s “Showdown” is a favorite.\n\n• “Italian Ice” by Nicole Atkins: Speaking of voices, this New Jersey native has one of the finest pop/rock voices around and her music is always compelling. Ranging from atmospheric to anthemic, edgy to heart-breaking, this is perhaps Atkins’ best album, which is saying something.\n\n• “Rise Radiant” by Caligula’s Horse: The talented Aussie prog-rockers never disappoint, as the Jim Grey (singer) and Sam Vallen (lead guitarist)-led unit is dynamic, soulful, restless, and intense. And, as always, featuring perfect production. Hard but melodic prog at its best.\n\n• “La Vita Nuova” by Maria McKee: The former Lone Justice singer is now in her 50s and has made some major changes in her life, but the unreal voice and the stunning writing are still there. In fact, this is her best overall album since 1996’s “Life is Sweet”. Challenging and most rewarding. One of the very best of 2020.\n\n• “The Women Who Raised Me” by Kandace Springs: The incredibly talented Nashville singer and keyboardist (she’s also a mechanic and visual artist) navigates the famous songs here with relaxed confidence and soulful, jazzy verve. Like fine wine. Impressive.\n\n• “En Español” by The Mavericks: It’s entirely in Spanish, but the language barrier (for me, at least) disappears quickly as Raul Malo and Company bring an immediacy and intimacy that cannot be denied. The opening track “La Sitiera” grabs you from the first notes and the album never relents.\n\n• “Nice ‘n’ Easy (2020 Mix)” by Frank Sinatra: Originally released in 1960, this #1 album captured Sinatra at the peak of his powers. The remaster brings a noticeable new clarity and definition, and highlights the many subtle aspects of a classic album. The 2020 release “Reprise Rarities” is also worth seeking out, although the material is not as consistently brilliant.\n\n• “The Absence of Presence” by Kansas: My all-time favorite prog band does it again, following up 2016’s terrific “The Prelude Implicit” with another set of superbly crafted American prog. The longevity and quality of these Midwestern rockers continue to amaze.\n\n• “Through Shaded Woods” by Lunatic Soul: A surprise for me, as the more electronica-oriented LS albums were enjoyable, but this driving, acoustic-based album is a revelation in urgency, mystery, and dusky beauty. Both lovely and a bit unsettling.\n\n• “Color of Noize” by Derrick Hodge: Pure aural jazz-soul-R&B-electronica candy–but with plenty of musical meat and potatoes. Incredible playing and superb production. This is why headphones were invented.\n\n• “Keaggy, Blazier, & Lunn” (An American Garage Band)” by Phil Keaggy. This was recorded years ago by Keaggy and drummer Bobby Blazier in a jam session, with bass by Gary Lunn dubbed in later. Yet it sounds completely organic and warm, a sophisticated jam session by one of the most eclectic and tasteful guitarists of all time.\n\n• “Monovision” by Ray Lamontagne: I do like some of Lamontagne’s more experimental albums (“Ouroboros”!), but this is the sweet spot for me: the gentle, backwoods vibe that marries Americana and folk with early 1970s Van Morrison. This is fine whisky in musical form.\n\n• “Revisiting This Planet” by Kevin Max: I was never a big Larry Norman fan (his voice bugs me), but Max wins me over with this modern, punchy, and on-point rendering of several Norman songs. Max is true to the music, but also makes the songs his own. Great stuff.\n\n• “Panther” by Pain of Salvation: Daniel Gildenlöw has gone through a lot in recent years (nearly dying in 2017) and so this is a welcome return to full-blown form for the Swedish musician and crew. This is a prog diamond: hard, clear, and multi-faceted, featuring one of the best rock singers out there.\n\n• “Inescapable” by Godsticks: Previous albums were good, but a bit repetitious. Not so here. Vocalist and guitarist Darran Charles has expanded his range, the songwriting is equally expansive, and the band is tight. A deeply personal and powerful album.\n\n• “Fireworker” by Gazpacho: Arguably the most remarkable prog album of year. Huge, intimate, byzantine, beautiful, and never predictable. Those who think prog is about long solos and wonkiness need to listen to this masterpiece. Spellbinding.\n\n• “Terminal Velocity” by John Petrucci: Fantastic instrumental album from Dream Theater legend. Yes, he’s a technical wizard, but Petrucci’s mastery of mood and attitude is at the forefront here. And it’s fun without ever being silly or derivative.\n\n• “Liturgy by Saint John Chrysostom” by Benedict Sheehan: Glorious, glorious, glorious. Enough said. Just listen.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI read three jazz magazines—Downbeat, Jazzwise, and JAZZIZ—every month and visit a number of jazz-oriented sites on a regular basis, and I am happy to report that jazz is not only alive, it is vibrant, diverse, and abundant. Even better, the quantity of releases is matched by the amazing quality of countless releases. I listened to dozens—perhaps 200 or more—releases in in the past year, and time and again I was floored by the talent and creativity coming from musicians young and old, from all corners of the world.\n\nThis list could be much, much longer. (And I actually list 13 albums, if you keep count.) But in the interest of appealing to readers who likely aren’t as “into” jazz I am, I’ve kept it short and sweet. I think all of these albums are worth hearing and buying.\n\nLove Stone by J.D. Allen. Some ballad albums drag, and others slip into sentimentality. Allen not only avoids those traps, he makes every single note count in such a way that there is a perfect marriage of warmth and anticipation throughout this remarkable, gorgeous album. There is not a hint of showmanship here, but the playing is otherworldly. Stunning.\n\nThe Future is Female by Roxy Coss. With song titles such as “Females are Strong as Hell,” “#MeToo”, and “Nasty Women Grab Back,” you might expect anger and heaps of spoken word lectures. Instead, you are treated to a brilliant, modern hard-bop session with sophisticated writing and beautiful playing. Coss and I likely differ on more than a few political fronts, but I have no reservations at all about this confident, engaging, and—again—beautiful set. Highly recommended.\n\nThe Other Side by Tord Gustavsen Trio. Gustavsen has been producing melodic, melancholy Nordic jazz for nearly two decades now, and he once again delivers a magical, dusky collection. This one has an overtly spiritual quality to it—Gustavsen’s “The Other Side” and Bach’s “Jesu Meine Freude/Jesus, Det Eneste” are examples—but there is a deep, pulsating restlessness that bubbles up from time to time. Recommended listening for late night, with a good bourbon in hand.\n\nFlight by James Francies. He’s barely into his 20s, but Francies has already made his mark as a sideman in a wide range of settings, not just within jazz but also in pop, hip-hop, and R&B. That eclecticism is evident here, with modern production and stellar chops at the service of an impressive and cohesive artistic vision. There is certainly a strong nod, to my ears, to Robert Glasper, another Houston native, but Francies is his own man, and his restless, inventive approach is an indication that jazz is in good hands.\n\nLittle Big by Aaron Parks. His 2008 album Invisible Cinema remains one of my all-time favorite piano-driven jazz albums, and he never predictable or dull. There is a decidedly “rock” feel to this album, but this is ultimately an organic synthesis based in creativity and trust, full of both energy and melodic focus. Like his decade-old classic, this presents and sustains an aural world, from beginning to end.\n\nAfter Bach and Seymour Reads the Constitution by Brad Mehldau/Brad Mehldau Trio. How many artists can release a solo album of Bach and Bach-inspired improvisations and a trio album bursting with freshness and mind-boggling skill? But we’ve come to expect this sort of thing from Mehldau, who can play anything and play it with an immediately recognizable sound and quality. The Bach album is respectful but often surprising, while the trio engagement is a deep dive into twists and turns that are as assured as they breathtaking. Artistry in spades.\n\nConcentric Circles by Kenny Barron Quintet. Barron is fine wine—he is now 75, and he is, if anything, better than ever. Which is saying something. This has the feel and approach of 1960s Blue Note classic (think Herbie Hancock or Andrew Hill), but with a clear contemporary quality. Relaxed and crisp, warm and sharp, detailed and accessible—this is small ensemble playing at its finest, headed by a generous, joyful leader.\n\nLive by Marcin Wasilewski Trio. This veteran Polish group has been a natural fit for the ECM label, with a melancholy and melodic style that reminds me at times of the Gustavsen trio. But this live set finds the trio in an energetic, even exultant, mood, with plenty of sparks flying, notably on the Police classic “Message in the Bottle” and Herbie Hancock’s “Actual Proof”, but also in the other cuts, all originals.\n\nAhlam by NES. This is perhaps the most unusual entry in this list, as it is sung in a variety of languages and has a strong “world music” flavor. Singer/cellist Nesrine Belmokh, who has a stunning voice, has roots in classical music (she’s worked with Lorin Maazel and Daniel Barenboim), but she effortlessly combines that background with jazz, pop, and traditional Arabic music, resulting in a deceptively simple and achingly beautiful album. Dreamlike in feel, which is fitting, as “Ahlam” means “dream” in Arabic.\n\nSonic Creed by Stefon Harris & Blackout. This has long been a favorite group, led by one of the finest vibrophonists today, and this long-awaited album, the follow-up to 2009’s “Urbanus”, does not disappoint. This is a sophisticated but immediately engaging collection, with a subtle funkiness and chamber-music quality that sets it apart, especially with the vibrophones in the mix. Rewards multiple listens!\n\nHeaven & Earth by Kamasi Washington. How do you follow up a massive hit album titled The Epic (2016)? You go even more epic! Washington is one those rare artists (in any genre) who lives up the hype, marrying audaciousness with a focused vision, complete with choral parts and otherworldly sonic landscapes. The contributions of pianist Cameron Graves are worthy of note, as they ground the entire two-disc affair, from simple melodic lines to cascading walls of keyboard brilliance. Hard to describe, but has to be heard.\n\n13th Floor by Eric Harland/Voyager. This ensemble lacks nothing in talent, with the prolific Harland on drums, Taylor Eigsti on piano, Walter Smith on sax, Harish Raghavan on bass, and Julian Lage and Nir Felder on guitar. It also lacks nothing in writing and cohesion; each cut is a perfectly realized gem, undergirded by Harland’s astounding time-keeping and driven by Eigsti’s often rhapsodic playing. This is not a “blowing session”, but a fully realized work of cerebral, muscular jazz.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
