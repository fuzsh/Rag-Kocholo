        "text": "Mel Torme, the versatile jazz and pop singer and songwriter whose silky-smooth crooning earned him the nickname “The Velvet Fog,” died yesterday at age 73.\n\nTorme died from complications of a stroke he suffered in August 1996, his publicist Rob Wilcox said.\n\nThe singer’s fourth wife Ali and five children were by his side at UCLA Medical Center when he died at 1:45 a.m., Wilcox said.\n\n“He was a very special talent, one of the most talented individuals in our business,” said singer Vic Damone. “A composer-musician-arranger. He was so very bright.”\n\nTorme was mourned by friends including Jerry Lewis, Charlton Heston and Hugh Hefner.\n\n“I’ve lost a wonderful friend,” Lewis said. “There could never be anyone to replace Mel, not only as a singer but as a dear friend.”\n\nTorme began his career at age 4 – and was a regular performer at Carnegie Hall and Michael’s Pub in New York until the stroke.\n\nBorn in Chicago in 1925 to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, Melvin Howard Torme toured with comedian-turned-bandleader Chico Marx.\n\nHis creamy baritone led him to an early solo career as a romantic crooner – but he yearned to be a jazz artist.\n\n“For a long period I was singing mushy, sentimental songs. I began to be called the Velvet Fog. I never liked it,” he said.\n\nHe was nudged back on the jazz track in 1955 by a record exec and became one of the style’s most respected performers.\n\nThe multi-talented Torme played piano and drums, arranged most of his own music, appeared in more than 20 movies and was nominated for an Emmy in 1956 for a supporting role in “The Comedian.”\n\nHe won three Grammy Awards – best male vocalist in 1983, best male jazz vocalist in 1984 and a lifetime achievement award this year.\n\nTorme was able to move easily between the jazz and pop worlds. He penned more than 300 songs – including “The Christmas Song.”\n\nIt was a sweltering summer day when Torme started jotting down thoughts to make him cool: “Chestnuts roasting … Jack Frost nipping …” The song was written in 40 minutes."
