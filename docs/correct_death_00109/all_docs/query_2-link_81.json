        "text": "Mel Tormé (1925–1999)\n\nBorn: September 13, 1925 in Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nDied: June 5, 1999 (age 73) in Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nMarried to:\n\nAli Severson (30 October 1984 – 5 June 1999) (his death)\n\nJanette Scott (20 May 1966 – 26 May 1977) (divorced) (2 children)\n\nPhyllis Arlene Miles (31 October 1956 – 9 November 1965) (divorced) (1 child)\n\nCandy Toxton (11 February 1949 – 15 February 1956) (divorced) (2 children)\n\nOne of the joys of a jazz singer is to try to keep a dimension of constant improvisation in relation to what he sings. But–and it’s a big but–only if you never lose sight of the original musical value which the composer put in it. And above all, if you don’t sacrifice the most important element of a popular song: the words."
