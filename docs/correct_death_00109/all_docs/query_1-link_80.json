        "text": "There are singers, there are musicians, and there are standard bearers.Mel Torme was all of these.Like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, Torme was one of the prime interpreters of American popular song, and not just because he seemed to know most of them by his own heart. Torme, who died June 5 in Los Angeles at age 73, knew 5,000 songs well enough to sing them from the inside out. He wrote another 300, including one certifiable classic, \"The Christmas Song.\"Don\\'t recognize the title? Torme always laughed when folks scratched their heads over that one. Then he\\'d start the lyrics &#151; \"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire/ Jack Frost nipping at your nose\" &#151; and impishly await the shock of recognition. \"The Christmas Song,\" written in 1946 when he was 21 and immortalized by Nat \"King\" Cole, became one of the most recorded songs in history, with dozens of new versions released every year. \"My annuity,\" Torme called it.Torme\\'s career began at age 4 &#151; he was on the radio before he was in kindergarten &#151; and continued with little downtime until he suffered a stroke three years ago.Until then Torme was doing 200 shows a year, from prestigious club dates and jazz festivals to guest appearances with symphony orchestras. It always appeared that singing was for Torme the easiest thing &#151; and perhaps the only thing that mattered. With few exceptions, older singers struggle with their craft, yet even after nearly seven decades of singing, Torme\\'s control, intonation and diction remained virtually perfect. Like Fitzgerald in her final years, Torme\\'s voice was still pliant, his phrasing imaginative, his articulation impeccable, and his enthusiasm undiminished. A lifelong assurance was matched with richer emotional sensitivity.\"I\\'m still learning how to sing, how to stretch out,\" Torme said a decade ago during one of his frequent Washington stopovers.While the arc of Torme\\'s long professional career reflected the inevitable fluctuations of public taste, the constancy of his craftsmanship was inviolate. It was also deceptive: The smooth silken baritone that led to Torme being dubbed \"the Velvet Fog\" &#151; a name he hated and at one point contractually banned from advertising and promotion &#151; was clearly a grand instrument. But the singer\\'s seemingly effortless delivery and cool precision masked the complexity of his art.A crooner who evolved into a jazz singer, Torme rarely veered far from the beat, never betrayed a lyric. Yet he could also construct complex medleys whose disparate elements were bridged by melody or rhythm or simply an amusing thematic notion. Particularly in his latter collaborations with pianist George Shearing, Torme loved to spice his performances with clever musical quotations and references that probably flew over the heads of most listeners but which clearly kept him interested and alert. The classic musician\\'s musician, Torme could spin out gossamer whispered ballads like Ben Webster or conjure the virility of Coleman Hawkins on up-tempo cuts that inevitably ended up in those spry scats.\"Keep it fresh, sing with interest,\" he counseled while preaching the three C\\'s &#151; \"consistency, concentration and credibility.\" His live show changed every night, and Torme insisted he never sang a song the same way twice, even such songs as \"The Folks Who Live on the Hill,\" \"Mountain Greenery\" and \"Lulu\\'s Back in Town,\" all of which stayed in his songbook for decades.By the age of 18 he\\'d formed Mel Torme and the Mel-Tones. It sounded like a vocal swing band, thanks to Torme\\'s patterning the vocals like the saxophone section of a big band. Torme was a fine pianist, an outstanding drummer and a sharp arranger.By 1946, Torme was ready to embark on a solo career. His soft, husky voice &#151; which the singer attributed to an imperfect tonsillectomy &#151; turned him into a bobby-soxer idol-complete with his own fan clubs &#151; though Torme never had the looks of a matinee idol.He left the Capitol label in 1955 after years of battling over material and creative freedom, signing with the small jazz label Bethlehem.\"If you\\'re going to fail, do it with style,\" Torme joked of his transition, but while the sales numbers might have been downsized his opportunities expanded dramatically.By the late \\'70s, Torme seemed more popular than ever. His voice matured and darkened, taking on new luster and depth. He began working with Shearing, an elegant collaboration that seemed to bring out the best in each of them &#151; and earned them several Grammys. \"We have a genuine friendship, and I think it absolutely transmits itself on the stage and beyond the music,\" Torme explained in 1984.Because he made so much music so well, and for so long, it was easy to overlook Torme\\'s other accomplishments. In 1951 he hosted the first afternoon talk show on television. He wrote six books, including the 1970 bestseller The Other Side of the Rainbow (an incisive behind-the-scenes chronicle of Torme\\'s year as musical director for Judy Garland\\'s prime-time variety show); several novels; the 1988 autobiography It Wasn\\'t All Velvet; Traps: the Drum Wonder, a biography of his lifelong friend, drummer Buddy Rich; and 1994\\'s My Singing Teachers, honoring his influences.There were 20 (mostly forgettable) films early in his career and a lot of television, from an Emmy-nominated \"Playhouse 90\" role in 1957 to appearances on \"Night Court,\" \"Seinfeld\" and MTV\\'s \"Beach House.\" The silver-haired songster even starred in a Mountain Dew commercial a few years back.But if Torme poked fun at his image, he never trifled with his gifts or compromised his material. And he never rested. \"When you rest, you rust\" was a mantra for Torme. To the end, he regarded his career as a work in progress. In My Singing Teachers, he wrote, \"I am going to keep on doing it \\'til I get it right.\""
