        "text": "Mel Torme, the fluent pop-jazz singer who earned the nickname the Velvet Fog for his smooth, soft vocal timbre, died Saturday of complications from a stroke he suffered in 1996. He was 73 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nMr. Torme was rushed early Saturday from his home to the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, said his publicist, Rob Wilcox.\n\nA supreme vocal technician whose style encompassed everything from intimate pop crooning to jet-propelled scat improvisations, Mr. Torme was rivaled in virtuosity only by Ella Fitzgerald, who moved between the worlds of pop and jazz with a similar ease. An innate classicist who approached popular songs with an analytic sense of balance and proportion, Mr. Torme infused everything he sang with a geniality that seemed ingrained in a voice that was incapable of making an unpleasant sound.\n\nMr. Torme was also a prolific songwriter, drummer, pianist, musical arranger, actor and author. His most famous composition, The Christmas Song (also known as Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire), written with the lyricist Robert Wells, became one of the most beloved of seasonal standards after it was recorded by Nat \"King\" Cole in 1946.\n\nMr. Torme liked to recall that the song was written in just 40 minutes on a sweltering July afternoon in Los Angeles and that it had subsequently been recorded in 1,734 versions.\n\nThe singer's several books included The Other Side of the Rainbow (1970), an account of his experiences working as the musical adviser to Judy Garland on her television shows in the 1960s, a novel, Wynner (1978), and an autobiography, It Wasn't All Velvet, published in 1988. The Garland book, with its portrait of the troubled singer, won critical praise but earned the wrath of her family, who unsuccessfully sued Mr. Torme.\n\nBut it was as a singer that Mr. Torme made his deepest mark. The critic Will Friedwald, in his book Jazz Singing, cited Mr. Torme as a pioneer of the \"cool jazz\" approach, spun off from the pop crooning of the day.\n\n\"Torme works with the most beautiful voice a man is allowed to have, and he combines it with a flawless sense of pitch,\" Friedwald wrote. \"As an improviser he shames all but two or three other scat singers and quite a few horn players as well.\"\n\nHis standards included Blue Moon, It Might as Well Be Spring, Oh, You Beautiful Doll and Mountain Greenery.\n\nMelvin Howard Torme was born on the South Side of Chicago on Sept. 13, 1925, to a working-class Jewish family. His parents were immigrants whose name had been changed from Torma to Torme by an immigration agent. He was a musical prodigy who sang professionally at age 4 with the Coon-Sanders Orchestra, singing You're Driving Me Crazy, at the Blackhawk restaurant in Chicago for $15 a session, and he was also a busy child actor on radio serials, appearing from 1933 to 1941 on such network programs as The Romance of Helen Trent and Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy.\n\nHe started writing songs at 13 and was only 16 when Harry James scored a hit with his song Lament to Love. While still a teenager, he toured as a singer, arranger and drummer in a band led by Chico Marx of the Marx Brothers.\n\nIn 1943, he made his movie debut in the musical Higher and Higher, playing a supporting role to Frank Sinatra, who was also making his film debut.\n\nThe same year he formed the vocal group Mel Torme and His Mel-Tones. After his appearance in the 1947 musical Good News made Mr. Torme a bobby-soxer idol, the Mel-Tones slipped increasingly into the background.\n\nHe was only 21 when he appeared as a soloist at the Copacabana in New York, and Fred Robbins, a local disk jockey, gave him the nickname Velvet Fog, a sobriquet he detested. In 1949, he moved to Capitol, where his first recording for the label, Careless Hands, became his only No. 1 hit.\n\nMr. Torme was 30 when he met Red Clyde, the jazz producer who founded Bethlehem Records, and decided to switch gears and move toward jazz. From 1955 to 1957, he recorded seven albums for the label.\n\n\"I wanted to embed in the minds of the public at large, particularly jazz fans, that this syrupy, creamy bobby-sox sensation was taking the musical bull by the horns and singing the kind of music he wanted to sing,\" Mr. Torme later recalled.\n\nBut artistic integrity did not breed commercial success. Soon Mr. Torme found himself eking out a living playing out-of-the-way clubs.\n\nHis reputation as a jazz singer continued to grow, based on his live performances. In 1976 he won an Edison Award (the Dutch equivalent of the Grammy) for best male singer, and a Downbeat award for best male jazz singer.\n\nThe ground swell of recognition accelerated after a triumphant 1977 Carnegie Hall concert with George Shearing and Gerry Mulligan, which Mr. Torme viewed as a turning point in his career. He later recorded five albums with Shearing, whose cool, romantic pianism perfectly complimented Mr. Torme's serene vocal style.\n\n\"It is impossible to imagine a more compatible musical partner,\" Shearing said after hearing of Mr. Torme's death. \"I humbly put forth that Mel and I had the best musical marriage in many a year. We literally breathed together during our countless performances. As Mel put it, we were two bodies of one musical mind.\"\n\nIn 1982, Mr. Torme finally found a stable recording base in Concord Jazz Records, for whom he made a succession of albums that established him as an articulate custodian of a broad pop-jazz-swing tradition that encompassed Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and the Gershwins.\n\nMr. Torme's career also got a lift in the 1980s through the TV series Night Court, in which Harry Anderson's character, Judge Harry Stone, was an unabashed fan.\n\nMr. Torme was married four times. His first three marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Ali; five children, Steve, Melissa, Tracy, Daisy and James Torme, all of Los Angeles, and two stepchildren, Carrie Torme and Kurt Goldsmith.\n\nCareer highlights\n\nSingles:\n\nWhere Or When with the Mel-Tones, 1944\n\nCareless Hands, 1949\n\nBlue Moon, 1949\n\nAgain, 1949\n\nMountain Greenery, 1954\n\nComin' Home Baby, 1962\n\nSunday in New York, 1963\n\nThe Christmas Song various recordings\n\nAlbums:\n\nMel Torme's California Suite, 1950\n\nMel Torme at the Crescendo, 1954\n\nIt's a Blue World, 1955\n\nMel Torme and the Marty Paich Dek-Tette, 1957\n\nMel Torme Goes South of the Border With Billy May, 1959\n\nMel Torme Swings Shubert Alley, 1960\n\nBroadway Right Now! 1961\n\nMel Torme at the Red Hill, 1962\n\nMel Torme Sings Sunday in New York and Other Songs\n\nabout New York, 1963\n\nMel Torme Right Now, 1966\n\nA Lush Romantic Album: That's All, 1965\n\nLive at the Maisonette, 1975\n\nMel Torme and Buddy Rich: Together Again for the First\n\nTime, 1977\n\nMel Torme and Friends, 1981\n\nAn Evening With George Shearing and Mel Torme, 1982\n\nTop Drawer, 1983\n\nAn Evening at Charlie's, 1984\n\nA Vintage Year, 1987\n\nReunion (with Marty Paich Dek-Tette), 1988\n\nSING!
