        "text": "A consummate jazz singer and prolific songwriter, Mel Tormé only improved with age. He was originally dubbed “The Velvet Fog”; later his voice matured and deepened, while retaining its unique sound and inflections. His first notable recordings were made in the 1960s, but in partnership with George Shearing and in reunions with Marty Paich he reached a new creative peak in the 80s. Whitney Balliett noted:”His songs seem to overflow, to surge out of him uncontrollably, as if singing were the easiest thing in the world for him.”\n\nPride of place here probably goes to Swings Shubert Alley, with skilled accompaniment and scoring by Paich and short but memorable contributions from Porcino, Pepper, Williamson, Hood, Perkins and Rosolino. Paich recalled: “When we picked the tunes we chose those geared not only to serve Mel as a vocalist but to serve instrumentally as well”. He handles the materials with imagination and wit (updating the lyrics of “All I Need Is the Girl”), and putting his imprimatur on “Sleepin’ Bee”, “Just In Time” and “Lola”.\n\nThe earlier Marty Paich Dek-tette date proved a happy collaboration with some then prominent West Coasters including Shank and Envoldsen. Try “Lulu”, “Lady Is a Tramp”, “Carioca” and “Lullaby of Birdland”. The lesser-known Mel Tormé Vol 1 rivals Schubert Alley in quality, but with slower tempos. “Old Feeling”, “Gloomy Sunday”, “Body and Soul”, and “‘Round Midnight” substantiate the point. A retitled “I Dig the Duke/I Dig the Count”, arranged and conducted by Johnny Mandel (but with incomplete and inaccurate personnel listings) is faster-paced and Mel clearly relishes the jazz potential of these compositions. An ebullient “Down for Double”, a scatting “Sent for You Yesterday” and an intriguing “Reminiscing in Tempo” (lyrics by Tormé) are among the highlights of a superlative session.\n\nLeonard Feather remarks: “The honesty and conviction of the singing on these sides, the delightful premise of the album and the expert manner in which the routines were devised, made the happy outcome inevitable”. Four very tasty puddings."
