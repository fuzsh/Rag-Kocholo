        "text": "Jazz Profiles from NPR\n\nMel Tormé\n\nThe son of Russian immigrants, Melvin Howard Tormé was born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 13, 1925, and grew up on the city's south side. In 1929, at the age of four, he began his singing career with the Coon-Sanders Orchestra, which led to a role on the popular radio program, \"Jack Armstrong, The All-American Boy.\"\n\nIn high school, Mel's attention had turned to jazz, particularly the music of Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Artie Shaw. He played drums and piano and also began to explore his lyrical skills. One of the tunes he penned at this time, \"Lament to Love,\" was recorded by Harry James and played on The Hit Parade.\n\nThe Mel-Tones became a success and Tormé quickly found himself recording with his boyhood idols Bing Crosby and Artie Shaw. It was during this period that Tormé met and began to write with Robert Wells.\n\nOf over 300 compositions written by Tormé, nearly half share writing credits with Wells, including \"Born To Be Blue\" and \"Willow Road.\" In 1946, the duo took just half-an-hour to write \"Christmas Song,\" which was made a classic by the great Nat King Cole.\n\nIn the 1940s Mel's manager, Carlos Gastel, encouraged him to sing in a light, wispy style. The approach earned him the adoration of thousands of young women along with an unforgettable nickname, \"The Velvet Fog.\"\n\nBy 1947, Tormé had left the Mel-tones, and his solo work with Capitol had generated a number of hit records. He was performing at the nation's premier nightclubs and appearing in films, including Words and Music with Frank Sinatra and Mickey Rooney. The movie produced Tormé's hit tune, \"Blue Moon.\"\n\nIn 1949, he recorded Capitol's first 12\" LP, California Suite. The album earned rave reviews and proved a financial success for both the label and the artist. But at the peak of his popularity, Tormé wanted a change.\n\nIn 1952, Tormé left Capitol and signed with the small jazz label, Bethlehem Records. The label's owner, Red Clyde firmly believed in giving total creative control to his artists. Tormé began working with arranger Marty Paich and his 10-piece band, \"The Dek-tette.\"\n\nWhile signed on Bethlehem, Tormé began experimenting with scatting and chromatic vamping approaches, as exemplified in \"Lulu's Back In Town.\" This rich era ended in 1957 when the popularity of rock-n-roll forced Bethlehem to close its doors.\n\nThe late 1950's and early 1960's found Tormé wandering from label to label and in 1961, he experienced what can only be described as an artistic nightmare. He signed to Atlantic Records, and the famous Ertegun brothers encouraged him to try his hand at rock-n-roll.\n\nThe Atlantic Records sessions were disastrous, but Tormé quickly adapted, moving on to become musical director for the Judy Garland Television Show. He wrote for magazines and penned books on Garland and Buddy Rich. He went back to acting and eventually earned an Emmy nomination for his work in The Comedian.\n\nThe 1970s saw Tormé experience a revival of his singing career. His voice had gained a deeper, fuller range and he worked on an extended Gershwin medley for his live performances, earning him a Grammy nomination for arrangement.\n\nWhen Tormé died in June 1999, he had clearly established himself not only as one of the greatest jazz singers of all time, but as a great all-around entertainer as well."
