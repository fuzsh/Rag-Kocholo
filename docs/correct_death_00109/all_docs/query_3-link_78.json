        "text": "2-5-23: Our little man has arrived! He is healthy and thriving, and momma Kari Wahlgren is recovering nicely—even after those 18 hours of labor and nearly 4 hours of hard pushing! Sleep has been at a premium lately, of course, but we don’t care. We are both over the moon about our new addition.\n\nIt has been an exceedingly emotional time for me. I get choked up over my little man at least once a day. Perhaps it’s a deeper sense of wonder, sentiment, and appreciation that accompanies my older age. Perhaps it's a taste of resolution to the profound pain of loss I’ve endured through these past three decades. Maybe both. But I’m already telling my boy that he has a “sensitive” papa. Hopefully, I won’t embarrass him too much in the years ahead!\n\nTo scope out a bunch more details, check out this weekend’s edition of the Bobby Rock Newsletter here:\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n1-2-23: After our 2022/2023 New Year's Eve set with Lita Ford at a show in Cincinnati, I was soaking wet, as usual. But I had to step shirtless into the cold night air, en route to the tour bus, which was our backstage area for the evening. Immediately, steam started rising thick off my skin! It was trippy. Photos and vids were taken to document this phenomenon!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n12-3-22: This week marks two years since our official pre-launch of Dragon Dirt. We'll do a bit more about this on the official two-year anniversary in January, but for now... I just ran across this “thank you” video I shot in commemoration of last year’s pre-launch anniversary, and it still feels relevant, in terms of how this whole thing came to be, how we continue to do things, etc. Scope it… and thanks, everybody!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n9-22-22: The Blog has arrived: Italy Excursion 2022 - https://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/italy-excursion-2022\n\nEarly in 2022, it was decided that my girl, Kari, and I would take a ten-day trip to Italy. I have obviously played there through the years, but with the exception of a \"writer's retreat\" I took to Rome in 2017 (where I did get a chance to see some of the city's spectacular staple sights), it's always been the usual European tour protocol there: flight/ground transport, to hotel, to venue, to hotel, to flight/ground transport, to the next city. Criminal, I know, given all there is to see on that majestic continent. And where Italy is concerned? Double-criminal, considering that both of my mother's parent's families came over to the US from Italy at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nStill, I don’t recall ever taking ten days in a row of downtime like this, so I wasn’t sure how I would manage when we left in early May. Well… I managed just fine, let me tell you! The trip was beyond magnificent: super-dense with incredible beauty, great food, and memorable life experiences at every turn. Truly, it was a trip of a lifetime.\n\nI’ve always loved capturing key trips and tours in blog form, especially since this format allows for the use of multiple mediums (writing, photos, and videos) to convey the unique particulars of each adventure. The challenge, for me, has always been to find that balance between what I'm personally hoping to memorialize about a trip vs. what I’m hoping my dear readers might find engaging. It can be tricky… especially when and if the trip was life-altering on a personal level.\n\nThis 2022 Italy excursion would fall firmly in the life-altering category (more details on that soon) and so, I found myself having trouble deciphering between the above two points of challenge: what was important to me vs. what might be interesting to you! I’m sure it’s leaning heavily in the former, but I hope there’s enough of the latter.\n\nThat said, this blog is likely my most extensive to date—a true labor of love to put together—with tons of beautiful pics, detailed itinerary info, food “captures” of the infamous cuisine over there and, of course, several scenic running videos around Tuscany, Florence, and Sorrento.\n\nEnjoy:\n\nhttps://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/italy-excursion-2022\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n9-21-22: (High school pic: close to three years of sobriety...and more hair than will fit in the frame!)\n\nStoked to celebrate 46 years of sobriety last week, but didn’t get around to posting about it…. not sure why. But I did write about it extensively in my latest Newsletter (Issue #76). Scope it here\n\nIn this issue, I also offered up some Buddha wisdom and discussed the first album I ever bought. Be sure and sign up for my weekly Newsletter in the upper right-hand corner of the page at the above link. I crank out a new one EVERY Saturday.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n8-24-22: How I Quit Smoking (and what my first “real” drum kit had to do with the decision…)\n\nHere’s an excerpt from a recent edition of the Bobby Rock Newsletter. I crank one out every week. Be sure and sign up for free in the upper right-hand corner of any page at www.bobbyrock.com.\n\n+ + + + + +\n\nI just celebrated 43 years of no smoking earlier this month on August 8th, so I figured I would give you guys the quick (and rather unusual) background on how this unlikely landmark came to be.\n\nIn my extensive blog about my sobriety journey (catch the link on the original posting), I had mentioned that, when I first started attending a rehab program at 13, the counselor urged my parents to allow me to smoke in front of them as sort of an olive-branch move that he could leverage against me agreeing to a 30-day commitment to the program. My folks were not so keen on this idea, but if it meant there might be a better chance of me letting go of the weed and alcohol, they were agreeable. Sure enough, it proved to be an effective “goodwill” tactic for me to try the program in earnest, and I would never touch weed, alcohol, or any other kind of drug from that day forward (9-14-76).\n\nAs for smoking, well, let’s just say that for every 20 kids in the program that gave up getting stoned, 19 of us smoked like a plastic factory. And I would continue my pack-and-a-half-a-day habit, right along with both of my parents, each of whom smoked about as much. (Can you imagine what our 2000 sq. ft. home in Houston must’ve fucking smelled like back then? God bless the seventies…)\n\nOver the next several years, my dad and I would arbitrarily enter into a half-hearted attempt to quit together… with specific stakes that we would outline in a one-page, handwritten contract: If I started up again first, I would have to pay him some sizable chunk of change—like, say, $1000—by my 18th birthday which, presumably, would require some kind of monthly installment program from the various odd jobs I would sustain, especially through the summer. But, if he started up first, he would have to buy me a brand new, Pearl Octaplus-style kit with a full array of concert toms. We would shake on it and then have a final smoke together. But then, in a desperate moment of weakness over the next several days, one of us would propose that we renege on the deal, tear up the contract, and return to our pack-and-a-half-a day habit. There was never much resistance offered up from the one who did NOT suggest the cancellation, and cigarettes would be lit up within five minutes.\n\nFinally, at 16, it was time to take the plunge on that big-ass Pearl kit. None of us had that kind of money lying around, so my dad agreed to finance the kit with a two-year deal via a bank loan… with the understanding that I would be responsible for making the payment every month. I agreed and got a job at a local car wash. Six weeks later, I was the proud owner of a beautiful 13-piece Pearl kit with a chrome finish. It was slammin’!\n\nLife was grand… except for one issue: the car wash job required an “unreasonable” amount of time: several three-hour shifts after school during the week, plus eight to ten-hour shifts on both Saturday and Sunday. This new job was seriously cutting into my valuable practice time! What the fuck was the point of having this kick-ass kit if I was stuck at work all the time, I reasoned?\n\nAnd so, three or four months into our new arrangement, I approached my dad with a slight variation on our normal quit-smoking agreement…\n\nCatch the rest of the article here:\n\nhttps://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/the-bobby-rock-newsletter-71-8-13-22-how-i-quit-smoking\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n7-26-22: Last week’s run in PA… or was it NY?\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n7-22-22: I’ve been a DW guy for ages now, so we always do a backline request for DWs for all shows where I’m not able to bring my own kit (which is more common than not these days). Sometimes, if the backline co can’t meet my specs in a DW kit, we have to use another brand (like Yamaha, Tama, etc). And if it doesn’t at least involve DW hardware, it can be a long night for my tech, Jesse, because I’m generally pretty tough on cymbal stands.\n\nBut the upside is, I get to play a wide variety of cool drums throughout the year. And on occasions where you walk into a gig (like today) where they have a full DW kit with the added variety of three Black Beauties - one 5.5” as a second snare (more like a timbale) and two 6.5” for my main snare (one for back-up), you know it’s gonna be a great show! Thanks to Dan at Bam Backline and More for the killer kit tonight…\n\nWith Lita Ford:\n\nJuly 22 - Horseheads, NY - The L\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n7-21-22: End-of-show salutations from a hit in the midwest last week.

I’ve had a practice for many years and I’ve been using this Calm app for the past few, which is cool because it keeps track of the days and times. Certainly, not every “medi” is a transcendent experience... but neither is every workout or practice session. But I do believe there is something about just showing up every day that's much better than NOT showing up every day. I find that structure in a meditation practice can be just as beneficial as structure in any other endeavor, like practicing, running, hitting the weights, or writing.\n\nAnd, just like anything else we practice, we’re gonna see improvements. To that end, I’ve always thought of meditation like weightlifting for your brain. Little by little, you strengthen your mind and are able to bring a lot more intentionality into your life, as far as: controlling what kinds of thoughts and inner dialogues you let linger in your mind and which ones you gently escort the hell out, how quickly you tend to react to “unfavorable” happenings, and how effectively you can mitigate the inner-chatter, especially when it’s time to concentrate—like during a medi session. I find all of these skills to be quite useful!\n\nFor the full report, check out my article, “This Is Your Brain On Meditation” at:\n\nhttps://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/this-is-your-brain-on-meditation\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n7-11-22: Hangin’ with the “Rockett Man” for a hot second after the Lita Ford set the other night at the Appalachian Wireless Arena in Kentucky, opening for Poison.

Rikki…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n6-9-22: Here’s another solo clip I just stumbled across in the archives from a Lita Ford run through Sweden and Norway a few years back.

It’s been 34 years since we first started working together way back in the Vinnie Vincent Invasion days. However, Cubby finally went into “semi-retirement” from the road a couple years ago, bringing in my new guy, Jesse Davidson, as something of a permanent sub. But with Jesse not being able to make it this weekend, it’s now the legendary Cub-Man doing the subbing for the youngster. Full-circling this bitch, for sure!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n6-2-22: What you see vs. what I see (from last week in OK).

Scope out that battered bag of Dirt!\n\nThe high-octane superfood smoothie has been a part of my DAILY routine since 1993. This includes when I travel, when things are hectic, when I’m on vacation, and when I’m someplace where the voltage is different than home.\n\nIn the states, I travel with a NutriBullet. But over in Europe—as was recently the case—I travel with a special blender (compatible with their voltage situation) that I bought over there years ago.\n\nThe two main reasons I recommend shooting for a daily dose of this kind of superfood powder is:\n\n1. When traveling or super busy, and it’s less convenient to fuck with preparing your smoothie, that’s probably when it’s most important to have it! You are likely stressed, or at the very least, eating a lot of quick, but unhealthy food. The superfood smoothie provides an important foundation until you can get back on track with your normal regimen.\n\n2. Many superfood ingredients—particularly adaptogens like herbs, spices, and mushrooms—have medicinal properties. But just like over-the-counter meds, you’ve gotta take them regularly to reap the full effects.\n\nAnd again, you don’t have to use my shit. But I do recommend that whatever concoction you prefer includes full serving sizes of the various ingredients (which, unfortunately, is difficult to find in the marketplace).\n\nScope more about the Dirt here: www.drinkthedirt.com\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-30-22: Post-show celebration from the Lita Ford hit on Saturday at the Buffalo Run Casino (with Dokken and George Lynch). It was our first show with bassist Marten Andersson, who stepped up to the plate and absolutely crushed the gig; and also our first show without our beloved tour manager/soundman/everything-guy George Marshall who, as many of you know, passed unexpectedly earlier in the week.\n\nHigh praise to our road family members Jarod Woznik and Debi Meullier Johnson for rising mightily to the occasion and taking care of business. It was a super-pro and ultra-smooth outing amidst a very emotional time. We know “St. George” was hanging around and pleased with how everything went down…\n\nPic by Teddy Allison\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-26-22: We are all still processing the unexpected passing of our main man, George Marshall: tour manager, sound engineer extraordinaire, ringleader, sounding board, voice-of-reason (and much humor), glue-gun to the Lita Ford organization, and, of course, loyal brother to us all.\n\nPic: George to the right there, with Patrick, Marty, and me, in a cargo elevator on the road.\n\nFor the past six years, he’s been the guy behind the curtain, juggling his ass off around the clock, and keeping everything moving forward. And then this past Tuesday, while asleep at home in the early morning hours, he simply slipped off to his next adventure.\n\nGeorgie had a storied career—with a million stories—traversing the globe with Twisted Sister (and many others) for years before he did the same with us. He was also an accomplished guitarist and studio engineer, and a devout family man. But mostly, he was a warm, friendly character who left smiles and good vibes in his wake wherever he went: Truly beloved by so many.\n\nAnd now, we will all get on a plane and head out to Oklahoma to play a show this weekend, because that’s what we do—and we know George wouldn’t hear of any other option. He was a “show must go on” kinda guy if ever there was one. And with that in mind, we will figure out how to “go on,” moving forward…\n\nBlessings, my brother. “Who loves ya, Holmes?”\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-23-22: Introducing: New Lita Ford Bassist…Marten Andersson!\n\nYes, friends, there has been a personnel change in the Lita Ford line-up: we are proud to announce the addition of the one-and-only, Marten Andersson on bass. Many of you may know Marten from his work with George Lynch, Lizzy Borden and, for the past six years or so, Steelheart. He is definitely a bad mo-fo, and we had a blast rehearsing with him last week as we prepared for a full summer (and beyond), rockin’ a ton of dates.\n\nMeanwhile, our bro-for-life, Marty O’Brien, has found a new home with Daughtry and has already been touring with them for several weeks. We are sad to see him go after nearly 10 years on the gig, but hey—the Daughtry gig was a GREAT opportunity, and for that reason, we’re thrilled for him.\n\nPlus, I just have to say, the Marty-to-Marten transition that has occurred over the past 6 weeks or so could not have been more amicable, harmonious, or professional—on all fronts. No drama, no weirdness, just the breathing in and breathing out of reinvention and evolution. It’s a beautiful thing… and, ultimately, it’s an inevitable thing. This is simply life doing what life does.\n\nOnward!\n\nYou can catch the “new guy” with Lita Ford, starting this weekend in OK:\n\n5-28-22 - Miami, OK - Buffalo Run Casino & Resort (+ Dokken and George Lynch)\n\nClick here for a continually updated tour itinerary:\n\nhttps://www.bobbyrock.com/tour-dates\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-20-22: Here’s a practice room vid that’s part of a series I recorded late one night awhile back, focusing on the “timbale side” of kit. I was attempting to work on some improvisational skills within the confines of using just that part of the kit. Here’s yet another pass at it.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-17-22: Happy Birthday to this guy, Patrick Kennison, my partner in crime in Lita Ford. They even got me a couple vegan cakes so I could partake in the celebration today… from rehearsals in LA.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-16-22: Back in rehearsals with Lita Ford this week. Lotsa shows coming up!\n\nPic by Teddy Allison\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-13-22: Best vegan pizza EVER, compliments of pizza master Mr. Benito, from Hotel Mediterraneo in Sorrento. The master has been crafting incredible pizzas at this hotel for 45 years and is well known throughout the region. This mixed-veggie masterpiece was a life-altering experience! Thank you, sir…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-11-22: Sorrento, Italy… early morning run. Breathtaking views and crisp, clean ocean air. Definitely worth getting up early to experience!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-8-22: Hangin’ in Capri for a couple days. “Breakfast of Champions” this morning: vegan pancakes with vegan Nutella… among a few other things. The food has been insane here in Italy this week, no surprise there…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-7-22: Early morning run in Florence today. Insane beauty abounds! Wound up doing a seven-miler because I kept getting lost.. which is not unusual for me in European cities. But Florence sure is a special place!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-6-22: Finally caught “The David” today here in Florence. Wow… absolutely stunning to see in person. This damn thing has quite an aura, for real!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-5-22: From this morning’s run in Tuscany (the Chianti region). Enjoying a little decompression time in Italy this week. Beauty everywhere you look… plus cool peeps and plenty of incredible vegan food. Florence tomorrow, then the Amalfi Coast. Life is good!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-3-22: Post-show farewells from the other night in Minnesota with Lita Ford. Killer crowd, super-pro staff. Always a great gig at the Medina Entertainment Center…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-29-22: Flashing it back to ’78. I’d already been sober a couple years by this point, but still: this was not a popular look to run around with back in Texas at that time! But hey… I knew I was going to play drums for a living, so what did I care what my beloved redneck brethren had to say?\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-28-22: Soundcheck in a hockey rink with Lita Ford and co… from a couple weeks back. Hitting at the Medina Entertainment Center near Minneapolis this Saturday, with Jack Russell’s Great White also onboard. See ya there…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-27-22: New article this week: Ya gotta Get Those Greens if you wanna enjoy superior health. Here are a few ways to do it…\n\nPic: We always request lots of greens on the Lita Ford rider on the road. This is Jennifer Murphy— from Kewadin Casinos and Convention Center—kicking ass with a shit-ton of kale and spinach!\n\nGet Those Greens\n\nI’ve always maintained that healthy blood is the number one determinant for overall health and wellness, and super greens are at the top of the list for maintaining healthy blood—given their extreme micronutrient density and high fiber content, as well as the overall alkalizing and anti-inflammatory effects they produce. This should make super greens a top priority food for all humans. However, humans these days tend to not consume them so often. This is a trend I aspire to reverse when possible, given the unparalleled health benefits of greens.\n\n“Smoothie\" Greens vs. \"Grocery Store\" Greens\n\nMy big-picture distinction for super greens is twofold: what I call “smoothie” greens and “grocery store” greens. Both are great and, in a perfect world, we would get a hefty serving of each every day.\n\n“Smoothie” greens are those superfoods that are either exclusively—or more commonly—available in powder form and, therefore, easy to add to a smoothie: spirulina, chlorella, wheatgrass juice powder, moringa leaf, barley grass, etc. These are among the most nutritionally potent foods on the planet and, essentially, offer a more concentrated dosage of everything we love about leafy greens from the store. This is why I’ve always given them top priority in my regimen and have, to date, hardly missed a single day without my heavy-greens, superfood smoothie since 1993. (That’s literally over 10,000 smoothies, for those counting!)\n\n\"Grocery store” greens include kale, spinach, collards, romaine, arugula, and Swiss chard—all of which are available at most any market. These can take a bit more effort to include in a steady regimen, and yet, getting more of these leafy greens is the number one thing I recommend to those who are doing a daily high-greens smoothie, and who still want to take their routine to the next level. Again, the one-two punch of having this variety of greens as many days per week as possible is, in my opinion, the number one thing you can do to up your nutrition game (with the addition of eating beans daily. More on that later.).\n\nCatch the full article here: https://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/get-those-greens\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-26-22: Yet another clip from the “private practice room” archives, and something never meant to see the light of day. Working on a little improv that features a lot of double-stroke combinations, utilizing the full range of sound sources in the Alphabet kit.

It’s a standard end-of-solo shred... but we'll spare you the headbanging part at the very end for now! (We posted Parts One and Two over the last week or so.)\n\nThis date was in a smaller hall than normal, but the place was packed out… and the show turned out to be a sentimental favorite in a way, just based on the energy in the room, and the unwavering presence of the audience. What a vibe. So many great memories from that run…\n\nFor the detailed report of the entire tour (with a shit-ton of vids and pics) check out the blog here: https://bobbyrock.wordpress.com/2019/08/27/china-2019-the-solo-drumming-tour/\n\nFor some follow-up reflections on this tour, catch my Bobby Rock Newsletter Issue #22 here: https://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/the-bobby-rock-newsletter-22-8-25-2021-solo-drumming-in-china-2019-observations-and-reflections\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-20-22: It all started with this guy right here: my first drum instructor, Randy May. When I was first starting out back in Houston, my mom used to drive me across town to study with Randy, because he was the best around. In the years since, Randy has become an industry legend, known for a variety of patented innovations, including the May internal miking system, Pearl Vari-Pitch drums, and much more. (Scope it out at Randall May International.)

When considering a new opportunity or activity that will be occupying future space on our already jammed-up calendars, our decision shouldn’t be a matter of simply yes or no. It should be a “Fuck Yes!” or “no.\" If it’s “no,” fair enough. You’ve saved yourself a lot of potential agony in the future regretting why you ever said yes! But if it’s yes, it should be an undeniable “Fuck Yes,” as opposed to the lukewarm “yes\" that many of us talk ourselves into because something looks good on paper at first glance.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nIt’s About Time: Time is among our most valuable commodities. Everything we say “yes\" to invariably takes way more time than we anticipated. So if you’re gonna be adding something, make it a “Fuck Yes!” addition that will bring you joy… or say “No” so that you’ll have the extra space available later to say “Fuck Yes!” when the joyous option inevitably presents itself.\n\nExperience vs. Execution: When we’re younger, “yes” is one of our most important words because getting better at things requires experience, and experience requires the investment of time… which means we have to say “yes” to almost anything that gives us experience. (Every pro musician will reflect fondly on this idea!) But as we get older, “no” becomes one of our most important words because, now that we’ve paid the piper for all of this valuable experience, we’re also dealing with a more finite amount of time, so we must be more selective about how we spend it… as in, what we say “yes\" to. Therefore, I say, every “yes“ must be unequivocal.\n\nCatch the full article here: https://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/fuck-yes\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-17-22: “Gotta Let Go,” our show-opener the other night at the Iron Trail Motors Event Center with Lita Ford.

Such are the ebb and flow extremes of the music biz, and if you stay in the game long enough, you will likely experience plenty of both. On the ebb side, 2008 was shaping up to be another rough year. Work had been “intermittent\" for awhile, resources were exhausted, and I really needed a gig—preferably in some kind of touring situation.\n\nA certain lead singer was about to jump out on a solo club tour and was looking for a drummer. (Serendipity!) I had a couple of colleagues close to the situation who, fingers crossed, could possibly just slide me right into the gig. And for as modest of an opportunity as it probably was, at the time, it seemed like a sparkling oasis in the middle of the Sahara: a real game-changer, given all I had been going through. Plus, it felt like a meant-to-be win-win, as well, where maybe my skills, experience, and lineage could, in turn, bring real value to him and his band. The stars had apparently aligned.\n\nAnd yet… it was not to be. We were able to get a couple messages to the guy on the eve of some kind of audition/rehearsal day, but we never heard back from him. Not sure why. (Actually, when things don’t work out, you seldom ever hear why!) BUT… at least I got the following poem out of the deal.\n\nBTW, I rarely write poetry in the traditional, simplistic form of rhyming phrases. But that’s how this one came out (in about 10 minutes flat), and I thought it worked. I just recently rediscovered this piece in the “vault,” and I shared it with my Newsletter audience a few months back, Thought you guys might enjoy it, as well.\n\nCatch the poem in the full original issue here:\n\nhttps://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/the-bobby-rock-newsletter-18-7-28-2021-the-guy-in-ratt\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-6-22: From the archives - One of life’s great joys… blasting a little double-bass warm-up through full PA at soundcheck, even if the execution gets a little iffy here and there.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-5-22: From this afternoon’s run: On days this perfect, it’s easy to forget about all the drawbacks to living in LA!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-4-22: Hittin’ with the Queen!

His work as a sideman reads like a who’s who of jazz greats, and his legacy as a drumming bandleader remains unparalleled in volume and scope.\n\nBut he was also a huge personality, to say the least, and there are a million stories about him. Here’s one of my faves, because it speaks to the notion that, when the “Universe” really wants to get you a message, it will find a not-so-subtle way to do so! I will recount the story here, which I first read in Mel Tormé’s excellent bio on Buddy, “Traps the Drum Wonder:”\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\nEarly in 1960, Buddy Rich was just 42, but had already been hospitalized twice for heart troubles. After that second visit, doctors warned him that he would most certainly suffer a heart attack if he continued to play drums. So, since he had shown some aptitude as a singer, he decided to shift gears in his career and have his agent start booking him as a lead vocalist. His first show was at a small jazz club in NYC.\n\nAmong the guests that night was legendary jazz vocalist Mel Tormé (a longtime friend of Buddy’s who also happened to be a decent drummer). Buddy’s set was, by Mel's account, “a pleasant evening of music,” suggesting that it was a good show, but not a remarkable one. It seemed that the disparity between Buddy’s abilities as a singer versus a drummer was, not surprisingly, quite evident\n\nAfter the show, Mel and Buddy took a quiet, somewhat reflective walk around 52nd St., heading toward the mecca of jazz clubs for which it was famous. Finally, Rich broke the silence.\n\n“Well, what did you think?” he asked.\n\n“Let me put it this way,” Mel replied. “I’m not your favorite drummer, and you’re not my favorite singer.”\n\nBuddy nodded.\n\nMel continued with a bit of cautiously optimistic encouragement, but it was clear that reality was starting to set in for the lifelong drummer.\n\n“Nah,” Buddy interrupted. “I like to sing but singing isn’t my thing.\"\n\nThey eventually wandered onto “Swing Street,” which was nearly deserted by this time. But the two heard music coming from a small club, so they stepped in and grabbed a couple seats. Pianist Allen Eager’s band was mid-set, with none other than the legendary Max Roach on drums. Buddy slouched down in his chair, now feeling depressed. This singing thing wasn’t looking good. What would he do now?\n\nBetween songs, Eager spotted Buddy and, with a touch of sarcasm, announced to the few patrons there that “the world’s greatest drummer” was in their midst. He then began to goad Buddy into joining them onstage to sit in on a tune. Buddy initially dismissed the invite with a wave of his hand, but Eager was relentless with his invite. Even Max Roach began to beckon Buddy, offering up his drum sticks in a closed fist. (Ironically, these two had just recorded a drum battle-themed record together the year before entitled Rich vs Roach.)\n\nBuddy wanted to play, but he turned to Mel for a yea or nay. Mel, although concerned for his friend's health, opted to encourage Buddy to “Show ‘em how it’s done.” That was all Buddy needed to hear. He hit the stage, grabbed the sticks from Max, then lowered himself behind the kit. And then Eager counted off a jazz standard (“I Found a New Baby”) at an impossibly fast tempo, apparently looking to fluster Buddy. Instead, Buddy—highly adept to sizzling fast tempos—was off to the races, and the band started cookin.’\n\nCatch the full issue and the rest of this story (with pics) here: https://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/the-bobby-rock-newsletter-52-4-2-2022-the-richest-man-in-showbiz-35-years-gone\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-1-22: Flashin’ it back to ’79 with Tour de Force, my main band from high school. I was 16 here, and we had just finished a show, which were typically parties back then. That’s Watson Davis on the left (guitar) and Gary Pinkstaff (bass) in the center, my brothers for life. We never had a singer, so we started out doing instrumental versions of hard rock standards (“Tie Your Mother Down,” “Highway Star,” etc), but then transitioned into a Rush-inspired progressive rock band, doing some fairly sophisticated shit by my senior year. I really got lucky being able to play with musicians of this caliber as a youngster.\n\nPS. The playing-shirtless thing was something that started early on, partially because Tommy Aldridge always went shirtless, but also out of practicality: I’ve always sweat my ass off behind the kit. (Dig those pants!)\n\nPSS. Gary’s shirt says, “I’d Rather Eat Barbwire Than Listen To Disco.” This was a typical expression of disdain that we rockers felt back then for this unwelcome new form of music!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n3-30-22: Trying to throw it down a little during a solo spot in Sydney, on a scaled-down kit!

Jones—front-man extraordinaire and one of the kinder souls you might encounter. I have maintained for decades that I owe a huge part of my career to this guy, and I said as much in my last book. Joey and I were basically just colleagues in the mid-80s, working the same club circuit, but in different bands. And yet, he went above and beyond to connect me with (Sweet Savage EP producer) Dana Strum… who agreed to let me drive out to LA from Houston and audition for Vinnie Vincent Invasion, due largely to Joey’s endorsement. This changed my life.\n\nBut, of course, helping me out is just a minor footnote in the large life this guy lived. I’ve always considered Joey part of that unique, post-David Lee Roth era of “bold, brash, and blond” front-men from the 80s. But unlike Vince, Bret, or a shortlist of others, Joey never got his due—at least not in the way I always felt he should’ve… although it wasn’t for a lack of talent, drive, or determination.\n\nHis work with Sweet Savage in the mid-80s was a study in front-man mastery. That band created a packed-house frenzy everywhere they played, and Joey was their irreverent ringleader, captivating every crowd before him with his signature swagger and searing pop-metal vocals. He simply owned the room. And while his banter and musicality had clearly been honed through the rigors of the road, his magnetic stage presence was not something that could be manufactured. What you saw was authentically who he was. Undoubtedly, he was placed on this earth to do what he did.\n\nAlthough the Sweet Savage EP remains something of a cult classic among hard rock aficionados, Joey would prove to be quite prolific through the years, consistently reinventing himself—and his sound. Holding roots in Dallas with different incarnations of his vision, Joey’s body of live and recorded work includes (from the top of my head) memorable stints with Pal Joey, Shock Tu, Joey C. Jones and the Glory Hounds, and the Joey C. Jones Band. The guy never seemed to stop creating… or improving. Hell, he just sent me some new shit sometime in the past year or so and I thought it was some of his best yet.\n\nI knew Joey had been struggling with cancer over these past few years, beating it once and putting up a hell of a fight this last time. But I wasn’t ready for that text from Strum yesterday, letting me know about Joey’s passing. I realize it’s probably a blessing that he transitioned to his next adventure, now liberated from the pain and struggle he had been enduring. But man… a strange depression has clouded over me in the past 24 hours. I’m sure many of you who knew him can relate.\n\nJoey… peace to you, my brother, and well-done! You brought a lot of light to this place with your artistry, your spirit, and your kindness. We love you.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n3-14-22: Still enjoying these various weight-training environments that are at least partially outdoors (here at one of the LA-area gyms I go to, but also at my home gym). This is a trend I’ve seen a lot more of in the COVID era… let’s hope it sticks. I’ve always loved to lift outside.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n3-12-22: The Lita Ford summer itinerary is filling up nicely. Looking forward to more of these kinds of frolicking, post-soundcheck moments! See you guys out there…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n3-10-22: Throwing it back to 1998 and the release of this 2-CD set, “Snap, Crackle, and Pop… Live!” This record was the result of a 140-city tour I did with Neil Zaza and Bill “The Buddha” Dickens throughout most of ’97 and, more specifically, the last 20 shows, which we recorded via 24 channels of ADAT. The result was a spirited representation of what this trio was like live and, as always, a joy to be able to birth into the world.\n\nBut there was also a heavy toll to pay for an impossibly-ambitious and extensive creative endeavor that cost much, much more than it earned. (And I’m talking about both the tour and this record!)\n\nMy next book, “Will Drum For Food,” goes deep into the solo artist/drum clinician period of my career throughout the 90s, and this week’s issue of the Bobby Rock Newsletter offers a bit of existential insight into this idea of “The Struggle Behind the Scenes”… specifically as it relates to this record.

But when we’re near LA, or out on a bus tour run, it’s always great to play my own kit! PS. You'll notice that the rack is actually three separate pieces, which are connected together by two thick chains.\n\nFor more on this kit—or for more of this kind of thing in general—check out the Drum Vid Vault at bobbyrock.com right HERE.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n3-8-22: New Article - Your \"Mega Memory.\"\n\nContinuing on with our 21st-Century Mind theme—and this idea of upleveling our brainpower so that we can better assimilate the technological onslaught of which we are all now a part—here’s a cool “feat of memory” exercise that will help lead us down that path.\n\nIt comes from a home-study course I grabbed off of a TV infomercial back in 1990 called “Mega Memory” by Kevin Trudeau. Hokey as fuck, sure… BUT, the techniques work, so long as you put in the time and practice a bit. The one I wanted to pass along today is called “The Tree List,” and it’s based on a centuries-old memorization technique.\n\nImagine this scenario: You’re hanging with a friend. You hand her a notepad and a pen. You instruct her to jot down a list of 20 random things: household or grocery items, a city or country, a type of animal, a celebrity, an instrument or tool, etc. It is essentially a list of 20 nouns. You then ask her to number the list, 1 through 20, but not show it to you.\n\nNow, with the list still out of your eyeshot—and obviously without you writing anything down—you ask her to slowly read the list back to you like so:\n\n\"Number one is Coke bottle,” (pause)\n\n\"Number two is squirrel,” (pause)\n\n“Number three is Clint Eastwood,” (pause),\n\n\"Number four is Jello,\" (pause) etc.\n\nOnce she makes it through all 20 items, the fun begins. First, you recite all 20 items back to her from memory, in order. And then, you invite her to say any number, 1 through 20, and you will tell her what list item was represented by that number. For an encore, you can even recite the list backwards… all with 95 to 100% accuracy (after just a bit of practice). Enjoy her bemusement… and get ready for the “how did you do that?” questions to commence.\n\nNo, this isn’t a magic trick. This is pure memory, \"total recall,” if you will. And with a little effort, anyone can do it.\n\nBUT, the catch is, the technique involved is basically the exact opposite of how we learned to memorize things. It’s way more effective and efficient because it uses both sides of your brain—a 21st Century Mind tactic, for sure—and, therefore, includes real visual association, as opposed to the typical attempt at forced linear memorization through repetition. (Good luck with that one, especially in this kind of abbreviated time-frame.)\n\nThis type of technique is commonly used among memory experts. It has to do with “pegging\" the new list item to an existing item, on an existing list that’s already locked into your long-term memory. BUT, you must make the connection in a way that is unforgettably visual. It has to be fairly outrageous… outlandish, unusual, violent, even sexual. For real, anything goes. I know it might sound whacked, but you will find that you’re not likely to forget some of the outrageous shit your imagination can cook up as you quickly link the two words together.\n\nScope the full article here: https://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/your-mega-memory\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n3-7-22: Killer Content Every Week!

These vids were obviously recorded for my own reference (so I could recall these various ideas later), but I've decided to share some of these here and in my Drum Vid Vault, just to offer a bit of insight into my process. I refer to this particular thing as \"sweeps\"... which are, in my mind, a drummer's version of those dense clusters of notes you hear on guitar or saxophone that sound cool when played really fast. To me, they have more of a wall-of-sound “color” kind of vibe, which is nice to have in the toolbox for special solo riff or drum fill occasions.

They're great for developing your chest, shoulders, and triceps, and can even strengthen your back and core when performed with strict form. And while they don't tend to build muscle size and super strength in the same way certain free-weight movements will, they can be an excellent addition to your training regimen.\n\nConsider pushups for any of the following circumstances:\n\n1. You are looking for a convenient way to integrate some resistance exercise into your workout routine, but you're not into weight training or joining a gym.\n\n2. Your normal facilities aren't available, but you still need to grab a workout, and pushups can be done anywhere... even in jail!\n\n3. You find yourself training in a facility that only has lighter weights (like many hotel workout rooms, for example), so you do a set of pushups right before each set with the lighter weights and—presto—the lighter weights suddenly don't feel so light! (And you can actually get in a decent workout.)\n\n4. You are looking for more intensity out of your current routine, so you add a few sets of pushups at the end of your usual workout for even greater levels of deep muscle burn and conditioning.\n\nTo scope the entire article—including pics and explanation on proper form, as well as a few other tips regarding the how and how often—click HERE:\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n3-1-22: While soloing is often about notes, notes, and more notes, playing with a band is ultimately about space, space, and more space. A drummer’s “sound”—and, in fact, the overall feel of the music—is largely governed by the space you maintain between the notes. I always try to let that shit breathe when I'm looking to pound out a heavy groove.

(Link at bottom.) Here are a few excerpts:\n\nOne of my favorite things about Thay (his beloved nickname—pronounced “Tie”—which means teacher in Vietnamese) was his ability to convey and illuminate the deepest spiritual philosophies in ways that were simple, memorable, and practical. He essentially showed the world how to operationalize higher consciousness, and he did this, decade after decade, through his writing, speaking, and perhaps most importantly, the trademark calm and mindful presence he displayed in, quite literally, everything he did. If anyone ever walked the talk… it was this guy.\n\nOn a Personal Note: In 1993, I went through an unspeakable tragedy and was just trying to survive day-to-day life. It’s always tough to lose a loved one. But losing your beloved, so young (and with child), under extremely senseless and violent circumstances... well, that's a notch or two beyond just tough, no doubt.\n\nThis is where Thay's book, “Peace Is Every Step”—and the practice of mindfulness— comes in. And it became a huge breakthrough tool for me, right when I needed it most. Thay's teachings were all about mindfulness as a fundamental lifestyle philosophy, as opposed to just being a practice we drop in and out of.\n\nIn fact, this, along with many of Thay's other philosophies, became foundational to a personal ethos centered around the daily practice of detachment from outcome and material possessions, nonjudgment, and the expression of nonviolence and compassion to humans AND animals. (Always a moment-to-moment work in progress, of course!)\n\nThich Nhat Hanh was one extraordinary human who impacted millions of lives in profound ways. He will be missed by so many of us…\n\nScope the entire article (with pics and vid) HERE.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n2-22-22: From a solo drumming tour of China in 2019, at a smaller master class: Here’s a multi-foot pedal demonstration I did, where my feet are playing four different rhythms—on four different sound sources simultaneously—while my hands do some basic improvisation. Again, this class was mainly for more advanced players, and yet, I got the impression that they hadn’t seen much of this kind of thing before. Note: right foot plays two different rhythms on the bass drum and distortion hats; left foot plays two different rhythms on the main hi-hat and cowbell pedal (with the cowbell part doing a lightly randomized “&2&” / “&4&” rhythm; hands do some basic solo stuff around the kit.\n\nTo see the full clip with explanation (vid #8), or to scope more of this kind of thing, check out the Drum Vid Vault: https://www.bobbyrock.com/pages/drum-vid-vault-4\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n2-12-22: In the spirit of trying to archive more of my “secret” videos that I have amassed in embarrassing quantities through the years, here’s a solo excerpt from a rowdy Lita Ford show, somewhere in Norway.

Cardio work is not only essential for our overall state of health and wellness, but also for “going the distance” in virtually any kind of arduous performing or training environment, including weightlifting.\n\nCardio training involves those aerobic activities that condition the heart, lungs, and circulatory system. These include running, cycling, swimming, kickboxing, brisk walking, and pretty much any other activity that jacks up your heart rate, including the use of classic cardio equipment like the treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike, and Stairmaster. You can either engage a single, preferred cardio exercise for every workout or switch it up each time. The only real guidelines are that you do some cardio work at least three times a week, for a minimum 30 minutes per session, and that your heart rate stays consistently elevated throughout the workout.\n\nClick HERE to scope the rest of the article.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n2-10-22: Throwin’ it back to 2020 and the last cruise I did with Lita Ford and co.

Here’s what I mean:\n\nWe have dragged into the present era, a brain that has been developed and conditioned to learn, read, study, discern, memorize, and archive a somewhat finite amount of readily accessible “content\"—as well as navigate a finite amount of outside stimuli and distraction—into an age of an incomprehensible degree of technology and access, where content, outside stimuli, and distraction are now infinite.\n\nYes, that’s one long-ass sentence! But think about it. The one-dimensional, linear way of thinking and learning that most of us grew up on in a 20th century classroom just ain’t gonna cut it these days if we truly wish to maximize the opportunities for expanded growth at hand. Simply put, we have immediate access to virtually anything and everything we need, related to any form of expansion and evolution, both personally and professionally… and we are carrying around the “keys to the castle” in our back pockets (hello smartphone). Such was not remotely the case in the 70s, 80s, or even the 90s.\n\nSo, I’ve been spending some extra time lately revisiting a lot of old books, courses, and personal writings that encourage a more creative, expansive way of thinking and learning. It’s real work... kind of like going to the gym for your brain. But again, it’s essential if we want to stay afloat in the tsunami of content and stimuli that washes over us daily.\n\nCatch the full article HERE.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n2-5-22: Killer Content Every Week!\n\nJust celebrated our One-Year Anniversary of doing this Newsletter.

I was a Sonor artist at the time, and they had just sent me one of their coveted Signature Series, 8” x 14” solid bronze snares—an instrument of unparalleled beauty and craftsmanship. It weighed in at an ungodly 32 pounds and, as you might imagine, sounded like a fucking cannon going off.\n\nIt was my go-to snare for years, during the entire Nelson era and throughout all of those early clinic tours. And after a brief hiatus during the Peavey Radial Bridge hey-day—where I was using an equally-killer-but-in-different-ways custom-made 7” x 13” Bobby Rock model snare—this Sonor snare has been a part of the arsenal again since 2000. So I have three decades and counting with this instrument… but this was day one.\n\nToday, the “Bronze Bitch” (as my tech Cubby and I have always referred to it) is one of two primary snares in my current “Alpha Kit,” along with that original BR snare: truly, the best of both worlds.\n\nScope the BLOG POST for more pics, including one of the original Sonor ads.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n2-1-22: Here's yet another practice room vid that was never intended for public consumption.

This is me with my little partner, Colin, shortly after he arrived at the farm. This baby goat was found wandering around an LA-area canyon, obviously lost, and in pretty bad shape. His ears had just been cut off (we never found out who did it or why), so he was taken in for treatment, stitched up, then brought to the Acres as our newest and youngest.\n\nThe downside of all my time volunteering there was seeing so many examples of the worst of humanity being inflicted upon animals. Tough to take. But the upside was seeing the animal’s resilience, their willingness to forgive, and their ultimate recovery and liberation as they lived out the remainder of their days in an animal paradise.\n\nOf course, sometimes they came to us in such bad shape that their days were numbered. But that was the gig. Every rescuer knows about this. But hey… if they can go out in a safe, calm environment where they have a chance to live a bit of the good life before they bail… we have to be grateful to have been a part of that. And we have to be grateful that we got to know them before they moved on.\n\nRIP Colin - 4-9-06 to 5-09-06\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\nSome days, life happens and we don’t get around to our workout.

This is me and my grandfather headed out for a bite to eat in Houston, while I was on break from VVI after the Iron Maiden tour (circa ’87), getting ready to start on record #2.\n\nAs discussed in the book, I had just purchased this ’76 Vette and had it custom-painted black with a hot-pink pinstripe (seemed like the thing to do at the time!). However, there is a fairly agonizing backstory to all that went down with actually getting the damn thing painted!

But perhaps the most unusual one is what I wanted to mention here: blacklight posters.\n\nYes, kids, I have inextricably linked the electric glow of old-school blacklight posters to my earliest days of drumming and music. I was one of those kids who had a drum set near my bed, blacklight posters all over my walls, and Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, and Deep Purple records constantly spinning on the turntable. Of course, there would be marijuana and bourbon involved around this time, as well, but still: the joy of listening to “Paranoid,” “School's Out,” or “Made in Japan” while surrounded by that wall-to-wall explosion of color, was all somehow foundational to my experience.\n\nAnd so, about 12 years ago, during a period of relative disillusionment, I ran across a photo on eBay of one of the exact posters I had on my wall as a kid, and it all came hurtling back to me: the roots; the beginnings; the impetus… as initially experienced through a filter of innocence and pure desire—a lethal combination, to be sure. I kept staring at the poster. It stirred something in me… a primal exhilaration, I suppose. I liked the feeling. And then I thought, “Why stare at a poster on a screen? Why not just buy the motherfucker?” So I did.\n\nTo read the rest of the blog and see pics of some of my fave posters, click HERE:\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n1-10-22: Resistance. Every day.

With Lita Ford:\n\nJuly 31 - Beaver Dam, KY - Beaver Dam Amphitheater - Rock the Dam Fest (with Sebastian Bach)\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n(7-23-21) Grabbed a little audience footage the other night during the drum solo at the Mentor Civic Amphitheater. Two perspectives: Top frame (pic by Joe Merante) shows me filming… bottom frame shows what I filmed.

Got a ride to the gym, but then decided to run the 4 miles back to the hotel after my workout. Very few sidewalks and hardly any shoulder space to run on! Always an adventure when this happens with city running…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n(7-14-21) Killer crowd in Ashland last night! Pennsylvania and Ohio are next.

Indeed, it was a great day…\n\n(7-12-21) Finally hit that elusive milestone today: 365 consecutive days of meditation. I’ve had a practice for many years and I’ve been using this Calm app for the past few, mainly for my shorter medi sessions. It has this feature where it automatically tabulates how many days in a row you’ve meditated, for example: “10 Day Streak.” In the grand scheme of life, I doubt one’s “meditation streak” matters much. BUT - I figured it certainly couldn’t hurt to aspire to, say, a 365-day streak and see what might happen. And after a number of false starts, that magical 365-day moment arrived this AM.\n\nSure enough, I do believe the DAILY connection time has made a difference—even as the quality of each session can vary radically. How So? 1) My ability to drop into a focused state of concentration quickly has improved. 2) There appears to be a closer connection to that “space between thoughts” where new ideas and epiphanies bubble up. 3) My practice of the primary tenets of mindfulness (as I see them) seems sharper and more consistent: Awareness of the present moment through breath; the “observer’s” daily practice of non-judgment and non-attachment; the ongoing cultivation of the “gratitude filter,\" etc.\n\nTo be clear, the differences are subtle. But they're noteworthy enough for me to want to extend the streak to a second year. 730 days in a row? Let’s go…\n\nPS. I shudder to think what kind of medi streak a real-deal “cultivator” like my friend Rev. Heng Sure has going on now. I’m sure he would laugh at my piddly 365 days. (Actually, he probably wouldn’t laugh, because he probably wouldn’t judge!) Check out his page for a daily excursion into real mindfulness, especially as it relates to nature and animals. Love that guy...\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n7-11-21: Had a blast playing Leatherheads near Salt Lake last night with Lita Ford. We love playing these smaller places, as well. Tons of energy. After the set, I realized I had not packed a shirt in my change of clothes, so I had to take the short walk back to the hotel without one. First time for everything, I suppose. But I encountered these fine folks - Cathy Burgener & Dave Bahls - (and several others) en route. Back at it next week. Catch all tour dates here: https://www.bobbyrock.com/tour-dates\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n7-8-21: There will be more of this tonight in Streator, IL (near Chicago) with Lita Ford and co. (Enuff Z’Nuff also on the bill). Catch all tour dates here: https://www.bobbyrock.com/tour-dates (Pic by Gary Brown)\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n7-2-21: Late-night training in Indianapolis, after a Lita Ford show last night. The train rolls further east today.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n6-29-21: Friends… this man is a PROFESSIONAL! He is Clint Naughton of LKP Concert Productions, and he’s handled backline gear duties for Lita Ford the last couple times we played Tulsa. This past Saturday, when I walked in the IDL Ballroom for soundcheck, my drums were already set up just right, tuned to perfection, and ready to roll. Why? Because the first time around, Clint took vids and notes on my set-up in case we worked together again. Man, I love seeing someone take their job as seriously as I take mine. The man is a fucking beast!!!! Thanks, Clint. Catch you next time…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n6-27-21: Hittin’ the weights late-night after a fun show at the IDL Ballroom in Tulsa last night with Lita Ford. Did some chest and back supersets, along with plenty of agonizing “drumbell” movements, which I explain in the vid. It’s been a grind of a week, with no meaningful amount of sleep since Tuesday night. BUT - training hard under this kind of mental/physical duress can really help to maximize that conditioning. Lots more of this shit ahead in July!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n6-26-21: Had a blast hittin’ in the hometown last night at Warehouse Live. (Still a DW guy, but the backline co could only meet my specs with this Tama kit… so we make due.) Tulsa tonight! With Lita Ford:\n\nPhoto by David Castillo\n\n6-25-21 - Grabbed a quick shot of last night’s crowd during the drum solo. Headed back home to H-town for another show with Lita Ford tonight.\n\n6-24-21: Another great day for a rock show! Soundcheck view this AM for a Lita Ford hit tonight.\n\n6-11-21: Out for a workout and run this morning in Wisconsin. So great to be back out here doing this s**t! Hittin’ with Lita Ford tonight. See all of our upcoming dates HERE.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n6-6-21 - A shot from the office yesterday, mid-show in Sunbury, PA with Lita Ford. Good to see folks out scoping live music again. See all of our upcoming dates HERE:\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n6-5-21: Soundcheck view for today’s festival hit. We are back!\n\nWith Lita Ford:\n\nJune 5 - Sunbury, PA - Spyglass Ridge Winery - Live United Live Music Festival (with Dokken, Warrant, Jack Russell’s Great White, and George Lynch)\n\nJune 11 - Rice Lake, WI - Aquafest\n\nJune 24 - Brainerd, MN - Lakes Jam (with Ratt, Slaughter, Kip Winger, and Autograph\n\nJune 25 - Houston, TX - Warehouse Live - (with Warrant, Bulletboys, and John Corabi)\n\nJune 26 - Tulsa, OK - IDL Ballroom\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-26-21: Just finishing up Lita Ford rehearsals this week. It's been a minute, but it felt great to grind through the set, make some tweaks, and get the machine cranking again. First show back is in Sunbury, PA, first weekend of June. Catch all the dates HERE.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-23-21: Sad to report the passing of my Nelson bandmate, Joey Cathcart, this past week. The Nelson Bros. put together a nice tribute for him at Meethook Live, and they asked me to do a little vid for the occasion. Joey was a beautiful spirit and a hell of a musician. Still trying to process this one...\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-13-21: Throwin’ it back to a 2018 photo shoot for the back cover of my book, “The Boy Is Gonna Rock.” Longtime friend—and one of the best photographers I know—Mariana Tosca (Tosca Photography) asked me to bring over a bunch of personal memorabilia, pics, and “items of relevance,” based on the era of the book’s focus. I did, and she arranged it all like a collage for the back cover. But I had to poke my head in for a quick shot during the process… for posterity’s sake!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-10-21: I covered this in last week's Newsletter, but just wanted to link the blog post about it here:\n\nI wrote the following piece in ‘97. It’s a snapshot of tour life, featuring one of my dearest road warrior brethren: Ed “Munch” Miller… who we just lost last week. Munch and I started touring together way back in ’84, but our connection was rooted far beyond the “biz.” Munch was extended family… a fiercely loyal friend who I always remained in touch with and would often see during tour stops in his native Michigan through the years. He was also an insanely gifted sound engineer and quite the character, no doubt! We’ll miss you, brother…\n\nClick title for the blog: Lampposts in the Moonglow\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n5-1-21: California dreamin’ on my run today... on sabbatical, enjoying the remote farmlands of central Cali. Looking forward to a return to the road later this month with Lita Ford... and a return to running in unfamiliar places again!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-25-21: Artwork - by our very own bobbyrock.com member, Nash Bandit.\n\n“What if?” That is a question I posed in my last memoir, The Boy Is Gonna Rock, and this is a cool drawing by artist Nash Bandit that answers one very hypothetical outcome.\n\nIn her own words: \"So apparently, when Paul Stanley did his 1989 solo tour, (Bobby Rock) was recommended as a possible drummer, but was declined due to how recent the whole VVI thing was, and as such, Eric Singer was eventually chosen. But this brings a fun \"what if\" that Bobby himself has mentioned in not only his book, but also in an interview or two. What if he HAD been chosen for that drummer slot? Would he have been called in to fill in for Eric Carr? Would he be in Kiss nowadays? We'll never know the answer to that, BUT as an artist, I at least get to see (and also show you guys) how he could've looked in the Catman makeup! And it... actually turned out way better than I could've ever imagined! Kinda wish that \"what if\" had happened now that I'm seeing it to some extent lol, but hey, fate has its reasons!\"\n\nThis is true! Thanks, Bandit, for another killer drawing…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-23-12: Finally, after over a year of training exclusively in a home gym environment, it's nice to be back in the groove of the middle-of-the-night public gym workout... with hardly anyone else around! Of course, Planet Fitness isn't exactly the most \"gym rat\"-style option in LA, but it is open 24 hours and 1/2 mile from the crib, and I do find it functional. (I'm also a member of another, more free weight-centric gym—with a pool—that's also open 24 hours, but I haven't been back to that one yet.) Anyway... returning to normalcy a bit at a time, it seems.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-22-21: Throwin’ it back to 2013, warming up backstage at a Lita Ford/Molly Hatchet show at Sturgis... in one of the greenest green rooms ever. There will be plenty of this again starting in June!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-19-21: In this week’s Bobby Rock Newsletter, I write about the early days of... Drums! Black Sabbath! And…. blacklight posters? Yes, blacklight posters... and the unique role they continue to play in my life. Take a second and sign up for the Newsletter here:\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-9-21: Another kick-ass springtime training day here in LA. From today’s run...\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n4-2-21: It’s hard to believe that, on this day, 34 years ago, we lost Buddy Rich, one of the greatest drummers to ever roam the earth. I had the privilege of seeing him perform live on at least a dozen occasions, and I have amassed many of his recordings on vinyl, cassette, and CD, mostly as a solo artist, but also as a sideman. I can still remember the moment when I learned of Buddy’s passing… and the stinging emptiness I felt in the days after.\n\nHere’s a short memoir I recently wrote about finding what appeared to be the Holy Grail of rare Rich recordings at a Boston record shop, way back in ’81 when I was a student at the Berklee College of Music. I wrote this for a recent edition of my Newsletter (#6: 3-10-21) which I share in its entirety on the blog.\n\n3-18-21: \"Maximum bang for your nutritional buck.” That was what I wanted to offer folks when I decided to take Dragon Dirt, my very own custom superfood powder, public on January 1. I knew that if people would “knock back some dirt,” it would be a game-changer for their health and well-being. As it’s turning out, folks are doing more than just knocking it back. They are finding easy, tasty ways to mix it and are making it their new breakfast, lunch, or supper! And, they are feeling that “dirty” surge of clean nutritional energy that happens when you take in FULL SERVING SIZES of 18 of the world’s most acclaimed superfoods.\n\nThanks, everyone! Glad to hear so many are “digging the dirt.” Grab a bag HERE. More info HERE.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n2-16-21 - Folks seem to be digging the new Bobby Rock Newsletter! Issue #3 hits tomorrow. (This in-studio pic of Lita and I is from Issue #1, talking about the new Lita Ford record, FYI.) Just go to the upper right-hand corner of any page here at the site and sign up with your name/email/password. Only takes a minute.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n2-11-21: Here’s a throw-back “story-time” vid from just a few years ago around the release of my book, “The Boy Is Gonna Rock.” I read a brief excerpt that deals with “the moment” that one discovers their destiny—a common phenomenon among musicians. Special shout-outs to my brothers Cole Newbury and Jim Mooradian.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n2-6-21 - Hittin’ the weights. In a parking lot. 3:00 AM. Joy!!! Yes it is… but it also speaks to something of a “new normal” during Covid. I’ve had to arrange for no less than three different workout areas around my crib, this one sort of an indoor/outdoor vibe. I really enjoy lifting weights outside and getting some fresh air… (well, as fresh as you can expect from Los Angeles!). Sometimes I’ll roll a little vid footage to double-check my form. Thought this clip was kinda funny… talking to myself!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n1-30-21: Although superfood smoothies have been part of my daily routine since 1993, I started making my own superfood blends in 2015 after I couldn’t find any single product in the marketplace that had everything I was looking for. With my insane schedule and unique nutritional requirements, I needed to \"get it done\" in a single, all-in-one complete meal blend: a hefty serving of plant-based protein, high-fiber carbs, and healthy fats, and a crazy amount of super greens, high-antioxidant fruits, and medicinal herbs and mushrooms… all combining together for the healthiest, most consistent daily meal in my life. I was also cramming in full servings of beet juice powder and cordyceps mushroom, two of the most tested superfoods for jacking up athletic performance. It was an expensive but stout-ass blend. I jokingly referred to it as “dragon dirt” because of its otherworldly potency and, well, because it looked like dirt!\n\nThen late in 2019, I had my lightbulb moment: “If this product doesn’t exist in the world, I guess it will be up to me to bring it forth.” And so it was. Now, I’m thrilled that so many of you have been “drinking the dirt” and starting to experience the many benefits of extreme nutrient density. Scope the site for more info, or to try some for yourself: www.drinkthedirt.com\n\nHere’s to a healthier 2021\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n1-21-21: A memorable #TBT shot: Me and Peter Criss, “Somewhere in Time,” backstage at the Long Beach Arena during the Iron Maiden/Vinnie Vincent Invasion tour. It’s been a minute... (Photo by Mike Gibbens)\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n1-13-21: Ok, so I’m a little “hands on” with the Dirt... and I wouldn’t have it any other way. At the bottom of every bag, I personally sign my name and write down which blend is in it. (B7 = Blend 7.) I know where every single ingredient comes from and remain engaged with every facet of the acquisition/blending/packaging process, even as I’m building an extremely competent team. Some day soon I might have to rethink the way we do things around here. But for now, we will use this “hands-on” approach to keep bringing you the best superfood powder in the world. Thanks again, everyone!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n1-11-21: Trying to meditate every day for a year, and I’m right at the 1/2 way mark now. I’ve been using this Calm app for 2 or 3 years now, mainly for my shorter sessions, but I always fuck up and miss a day. Gotta make that full year! I think it’s helpful to bring real structure to the practice, just like we do for any other kind of training. Still tough to quiet the mind, though...\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n‪1-10-21 - Meet Summer. She’s what’s known as a Silkie—one of hundreds of different breeds of chickens. Her ancestors likely started out in China. But now, she finds herself living the life in my BFF’s backyard chicken nirvana with her roommate, Scarlett, who's also a Silkie. Yes, like dogs and cats, chickens also need to be rescued... to the tune of about 9 billion a year just in the US. But that’s another story…\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n1-5-21 - Thanks for the killer Dragon Dirt launch this weekend, everyone! So thrilled to hear about everyone “digging the dirt!” Scope out a bag here.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n1-1-21 -Thrilled to announce the official launch TODAY of my new superfood powder, Dragon Dirt. I chose January 1 to launch because it’s such a symbolic day... often the reboot of a healthier lifestyle for many. And I truly believe this stuff can be a game-changer for anyone who consistently uses it.\n\nWe’ve spent a ton of time over the holidays prepping for today and are now fully stocked up with Dirt! Grab a bag at the store.\n\nMuch love and appreciation to all of our early users for your positive feedback!\n\n12-22-20 - Here’s a backstage clip from a show last year, as Marty and Patrick “take 5\" during the drum solo. Notice the variety of fruits and veggies we typically have on hand—all of those phytonutrients and antioxidants are important to load up on when touring. Of course, we all have our own way of managing out there!\n\nLove and miss my road family: Lita Ford, Marty O’Brien, Patrick Kennison, George Marshall, and Jarod Woznic.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n12-18-20: Today marks four years since I lost my best bud, Barry. This kind of loss is not something you ever fully recover from. Around the time of his passing, I wrote this blog post about Barry, his life, and the excruciating circumstances around his departure. It’s still tough for me to read, but I’m glad this detailed account of his life and times is out there. This little guy was truly one-in-a-million…\n\nhttps://bobbyrock.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/barry-buddha-bigger-than-life/\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n12-10-20: Quick update for those following the storyline here. We are currently prepping for our 1-1-21 launch of my new superfood powder, Dragon Dirt. However, we will continue to do our best to keep the Dirt available in December for advanced purchases. At the moment, we are stocked-up and shipping, but it's hard to say how long that will be the case. Check status HERE.\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n12-4-20: Thank you, everybody! Should have more Dirt available next week. For everyone who ordered, everything has shipped! Appreciate the love...\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n12-2-20: Friends, I am super pumped to announce the January 2021 launch of my very own all-in-one meal replacement powder. I couldn’t find any single product in the market that had the kind of quality/quantity ratios of ingredients that I was looking for, so I created it myself. It’s called Dragon Dirt, and I truly believe it is the most potent superfood powder on the planet.\n\nThe “Dirt” contains a full meal’s worth of macronutrients (plant-based protein, high-fiber carbs, and healthy fats) plus a full range of micronutrients from various super greens and veggies, high-antioxidant fruits, and mushroom and herb adaptogens, for maximum energy, immunity, mind/body wellness, and sports performance. It’s also one of the few complete meal products in the world that features FULL SERVING SIZES of each of its 18 ingredients. And it’s all vegan with no added sugar, flavorings, or emulsifiers—just the 18 ingredients and nothing else.\n\nOrder here\n\nAlthough this post is my first official announcement of the powder, I’ve had it up on the site here for a couple months now so folks in my inner circle could access some sample bags in advance. But others are already finding it, trying it out and, thankfully, loving it!\n\nJust add 2 scoops of Dragon Dirt to a blender concoction (like a simple fruit smoothie) and that shake becomes the healthiest, most nutrient-dense meal of the day—period. Or, add 1 scoop to any shake you currently enjoy and jack up the overall nutritional firepower two or three-fold.\n\nAgain, the official launch will kick-off next month on 1-1-21, but we will be cranking out blends throughout the month of December. So, if you want to try some Dirt for yourself - or if you would like to “give the gift of health” to a loved one for Christmas this year - scope it out at the Bobby Rock Store. We’ve been turning orders around inside of 24 hours. (We’ve also been selling out almost every week, so if you see that we’re out of stock, check back the next day.)\n\nAll for now. Thanks, everyone…\n\nBR\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n11-28-20: Alphabet Drumming is something I've been secretly working on for years. Now, it's time to start posting some clips so you can get a vibe for what it sounds like. If you click on Drumming and scroll down to The Solo Artist section, you can read about how I am integrating the concept into my latest solo record. But for now, let me post a quick \"practice room vid\" - of which there are probably hundreds - just so you can hear something. This is me spelling out - in rhythm - the tail end of MLK's infamous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, which I recorded on his b-day last year.\n\nHere are my original notes, scribbled on the back of some random index card:\n\nMuch more to come...\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n11-27-20: My dad would've been 81 today. Damn. Been almost 7 years since he moved on to the Next Adventure. It's not something you ever get over. But I lucked out to have him for as long as I did. Always thought it was cool that he shared a birthday with Bruce Lee (1940) and Jimi Hendrix (1942)!\n\nHere's a blog post I wrote right after he passed. Hell of a human: The MAN – Reflections on a Life with the World’s Greatest Dad\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n11-26-20: This is Juju. Crazy to think that this girl spent the first 8+ years of her life as a street feral... when she is now pimpin' it as an indoor kitty. Life is good!\n\nNotice, by the way, that chunk of her right ear that's missing. This is a bit of \"collateral damage\" inherent to what we call TNR - Trap, Neuter, Return. Whenever you \"TNR\" a colony of feral cats, you trap each one, take them to the vet to be spay or neutered, then return them home to where you found them where, of course, you continue regularly feeding until they all eventually, naturally, pass on. TNR is absolutely critical, though! Otherwise, these motherfuckers will keep on procreating forever and ever!\n\nHowever, whenever you have a feral fixed, the vet will always perform this \"ear tipping\" thing (when the cat is under anesthesia for the procedure) - as you see here - so that if any other activist might trap a cat who's already been fixed, they can see the ear tip and let them out of the trap so they don't have to be brought into the vet again. But we always noticed that Juju had an exceedingly pronounced tipping... yet another thing that makes her special!\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n+ + + + + + +\n\n11-21-20: If this kit doesn’t drive the Cub-Man - my longtime drum tech - into retirement, nothing will! Been 32 years working together... and counting. He is the master, and we are in the midst of recording this beast of a kit for my next solo release: one of the main projects that has captured a lot of my time in 2020."
