        "text": "1927 Â· The World's Busiest Airport\n\n\"Originally named Chicago Air Park, Midway Airport was built with one cinder runway mainly for airmail flights. The city then leased the airport and named it the Chicago Municipal Airport. By 1928, the airport had twelve hangars and four runways, lit for night operations. In 1931 the airport claimed to be the \"\"World's Busiest\"\" with over 100,846 passengers on 60,947 flights each week. In July 1949 the airport was renamed after the Battle of Midway.\"\n\n1934 Â· Alcatraz Island Becomes Federal Penitentiary\n\nAlcatraz Island officially became Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary on August 11, 1934. The island is situated in the middle of frigid water and strong currents of the San Francisco Bay, which deemed it virtually inescapable. Alcatraz became known as the toughest prison in America and was seen as a âlast resort prison.â Therefore, Alcatraz housed some of Americaâs most notorious prisoners such as Al Capone and Robert Franklin Stroud. Due to the exorbitant cost of running the prison, and the deterioration of the buildings due to salt spray, Alcatraz Island closed as a penitentiary on March 21, 1963.Â\n\n1945 Â· Freedoms of the Air\n\nThe primary goal of Â the Chicago Convention was to establish the International Civil Aviation Organization. This organization establishes the rules of airspace, aircraft registration and safety, and details the rights of the signatories in relation to air travel. The Convention has since been revised eight times."
