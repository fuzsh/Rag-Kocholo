        "text": "Mel Torme, the fluent pop-jazz singer who earned the nickname the Velvet Fog for his smooth, soft vocal timbre, died Saturday of complications from a stroke he suffered in 1996. He was 73 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nTorme was rushed early Saturday from his home to the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, said his publicist, Rob Wilcox.A supreme vocal technician whose style encompassed everything from intimate pop crooning to jet-propelled scat improvisations, Torme was rivaled in virtuosity only by Ella Fitzgerald, who moved between the worlds of pop and jazz with a similar ease.\n\nTorme was also a prolific songwriter, drummer, pianist, musical arranger, actor and author. His most famous composition, ``The Christmas Song' (also known as ``Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire'), written with the lyricist Robert Wells, became one of the most beloved of seasonal standards after it was recorded by Nat King Cole in 1946.\n\nTorme liked to recall that the song was written in just 40 minutes on a sweltering July afternoon in Los Angeles and that it had subsequently been recorded in 1,734 versions. The singer's several books included ``The Other Side of the Rainbow' (1970), an account of his experiences working as the musical adviser to Judy Garland on her television shows in the 1960s, a novel, ``Wynner' (1978), and an autobiography, ``It Wasn't All Velvet,' published in 1988. The Garland book, with its portrait of the troubled singer, won critical praise but earned the wrath of her family, who unsuccessfully sued Torme. But it was as a singer that Torme made his deepest mark. Critic Will Friedwald, in his book ``Jazz Singing,' cited Torme as a pioneer of the ``cool jazz' approach, spun off from the pop crooning of the day.\n\n``Torme works with the most beautiful voice a man is allowed to have, and he combines it with a flawless sense of pitch,' Friedwald wrote. ``As an improviser he shames all but two or three other scat singers and quite a few horn players as well.'\n\nHis standards included ``Blue Moon,' ``It Might as Well Be Spring,' ``Oh, You Beautiful Doll' and ``Mountain Greenery.'\n\nTorme, who began his singing career on radio at age 4, preferred jazz singing to the crooning that brought him his nickname.\n\n``It really wasn't until the end of my high school days, in 1943, that I determined to be a jazz singer,' he says. ``Then I got sidetracked. (His manager) felt the way to the gold was for me to become a crooner.\n\n``For a long period I was singing mushy, sentimental songs. I began to be called the Velvet Fog. I never liked it.'\n\nHe said he was rescued by a recording executive who heard a bit of jazz in his style and urged him in that direction.\n\nHe saw his vocal career as a work in progress, ``a long learning curve.'\n\nListening to recordings in a box CD set on his career, he said: ``The early songs are kind of callow. I cringe a little bit at them.'\n\nHe was his own arranger for much of his career, played piano and other instruments, acted in a few Hollywood films, had a TV talk show for a while in the '50s, and had his occasional appearances on the NBC sitcom ``Night Court.'\n\nAt 70, he said he maintained his vocal strength by taking care of himself: no smoking, only an occasional glass of wine, careful avoidance of drafts.\n\n``Before I sing I force myself to have seven or eight hours of sleep. I can sing acceptably well on six hours. There is that little grade of difference between six hours and eight hours.'\n\nIn a 1994 concert at Carnegie Hall, he joked about his age. In ``You Make Me Feel So Young,' the 68-year-old Torme sang: ``You know that age is just a number,' then interjected ``If I could really believe that.'\n\nTorme is survived by his wife and five children - Steve, Melissa, Tracy, Daisy, and James.\n\nMemorial services were not immediately announced.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
