        "text": "Lewis Cleale, B.M. ’89, named University of Miami School of Music 2002 Distinguished Alumnus, is one of the most gifted musical actors on the stage today. He majored in finance at the University of Miami until he picked up a double major in music where he was encouraged to pursue a career in singing. His first big break came when he was cast in a European tour of Oklahoma! He made his Broadway debut in the 1995 Johnny Burke revue Swinging on a Star, for which he received a Drama Desk Award nomination as Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.\n\nMore recently, Cleale delighted and offended Broadway theatre-goers as Joseph Smith, the Mission President, and Jesus in The Book of Mormon. He was also heard as the voice of Cliff the Troll in Disney’s motion picture hit Frozen.\n\nBroadway audiences applauded Cleale in Spamalot as Sir Galahad, The Black Knight and other zany characters. His many roles on the stages include Michael in I DO! I DO!, James Lapine’s original Sondheim On Sondheim, Bick Benedict in the world premiere of Michael John LaChiusa’s Giant, Lancelot in Camelot, and El Gallo in the New York production of The Fantasticks. Cleale also appeared in Amour and Once Upon A Mattress.\n\nLewis Cleale has played leading roles in more that thirty regional productions, winning the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actor as Giorgio in Passion. He performed John Adams in the acclaimed production of 1776 at the Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C. and Alfie in the Burt Bacharach musical What The World Needs Now.\n\nCleale’s collection of recordings and albums include William Finn’s Infinite Joy, Adam Guettel’s Myths and Hymns, the RCA Victor anthology Great Musicals, and the original cast albums of Once Upon a Mattress, Swinging on a Star, Call Me Madam, and Amour.\n\nThe career of University of Miami Frost School of Music 1997 Distinguished Alumnus Curtis Rayam, B.M. ’73 has taken him through some of Europe’s most venerable opera houses. The American tenor rose to international prominence in 1984 when he substituted for the ailing Luciano Pavarotti and sang the title role of Mozart’s Idomeneo to critical acclaim.\n\nRayam made his professional debut with the Miami Opera in Puccini’s Manon Lescaut. He established a national reputation with the Houston Grand Opera in the role of Remus in Scott Joplin’s Treemonisha, which was recorded on Deutsche Grammophon. He went on to perform in ten HGO productions, including the award-winning tours of Porgy and Bess and Showboat. Rayam made his European debut at the Wexford Festival in Giovanna d’Arco by Verdi, returning as the Sultan in Mozart’s Zaide and as Wilhelm Meister in Thomas’ Mignon.\n\nRayam had further engagements at Salzburg, Paris, Frankfurt and Venice. In a 1986 PBS broadcast, he performed in Berlioz’ La damnation de Faust with the Philadelphia Opera. In 1992, celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall, the German Consulate invited Mr. Rayam as a guest soloist in Handel’s Messiah at the John F. Kennedy Center. For three decades, Mr. Rayam performed extensively in the United States, Germany, Austria, France, Israel, Vienna, and South Africa with major opera companies and symphony orchestras.\n\nRyam is currently on the faculty of Bethune-Cookman University as a voice lecturer. He is a member of the National Opera Association, completing two consecutive terms on their Board of Directors.\n\nMarvis Martin, B.M. ‘77, named University of Miami Frost School of Music 1987 Distinguished Alumna, is an African-American operatic soprano best known for her concert performances and recitals, including her renditions of Joseph Canteloube’s Chants d’Auvergne, and of Bess in Bobby McFerrin’s touring concert version of Porgy and Bess. Martin is acclaimed for her beauty of voice and sensitive communication, receiving awards, medals and glowing reviews as a song recitalist, concert singer, and opera performer.\n\nThe Florida native was hailed internationally in 1982 when she debuted with The Metropolitan Opera as Pamina in a touring production of The Magic Flute, a role she later reprised for The Greater Miami Opera. During her first season with The Metropolitan Opera, she performed Zenia in Boris Godunov, the Princess in Ravel’s L’Enfant et les Sortileges, and the Celestial Voice in Don Carlo. Seasons 1983-84 brought major debuts with Netherlands Opera as Ilia in Mozart’s Idomeneo, and a performance with the New York Philharmonic in Brahm’s Requiem.\n\nAs her career matured, Martin spent more time focusing on recitals and concert performances, including eight of Joseph Canteloube’s Chants d’Auvergne with the Allentown Symphony Orchestra, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra, Gustav Mahler’s Second Symphony with The Florida Orchestra, Brahms’s German Requiem with the New York Philharmonic, and on the stages of Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, and the Cabaret Corner of New York’s Russian Tea Room, to name a few.\n\nImpressaria Judy Drucker, B.M. ‘48 was named the University of Miami Frost School of Music 1986 Distinguished Alumna. She is responsible for establishing the Concert Association of Florida as one of the state’s most formidable artistic presenting organizations. For four decades under her leadership, the Concert Association of Florida never wavered in its mission to present world-class orchestras, classical artists, and dance in South Florida.\n\nDrucker founded the “Great Artists Series,” presenting a host of internationally eminent classical musicians that included Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo, José Carreras, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Zubin Mehta, Beverly Sills, Cecilia Bartoli, and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, among others. She brought in renowned orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, London Symphony Orchestra, Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops, and the Israel Philharmonic. A pioneer in bringing world-class dance companies to South Florida, Drucker presented the American Ballet Theatre, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre, The Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Bolshoi Ballet, The Royal Ballet of Covent Garden, and the Joffrey Ballet, among others.\n\nDrucker frequently arranged master classes and performances for young people in the community, working with such artists as Twyla Tharp, James Galway, Yo-Yo Ma, Wynton Marsalis, and André Watts. She joined the Florida Grand Opera in 2009 as Senior Artistic Advisor to present their Superstar Concert Series.\n\nDrucker is a recipient of the Governor’s Award for the Arts and serves on the Florida Fine Arts Council. A musician herself, she studied piano at the New York College of Music, as well as voice at The Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music. Drucker performed on Broadway and with the Greater Miami-Dade Opera (now Florida Grand Opera)."
