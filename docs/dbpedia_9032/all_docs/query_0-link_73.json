He is an actor, comedian , host, producer and writer. In July 1993, he legally changed his name to ANT from Anthony Steven Kalloniatis. The correct orthography is ANT, spelled in all caps.\n\nBorn to Greek immigrant parents (Lee and Maria - whom he talks about frequently in his stand-up routines), Ant was raised strict Greek Orthodox. As he entered adulthood he ventured away from strict Orthodoxy and studied many other religions including Taoism, Hinduism and even Scientology. ANT believes that he is just a spiritual being looking for answers.\n\nANT attended Londonderry High School and the University of New Hampshire where he was affectionately known as \"what's your name again?\" Inebriated at a bar one night, he got up on stage at a local talent contest and performed a crude stand-up routine for the first time. He lost. But a seed was planted and he knew comedy was his calling. College didn't seem to suit his growing fascination with stand-up comedy, and in 1986 he dropped out of college after only attending a single semester.\n\nIn 1993 he moved to Los Angeles and began performing comedy full time. It didn't take long for the networks to take notice of him and in 1994, starred in the Fox Television pilot, \"Howe High.\" From there he went on to a co-starring role as Barry Wallenstein on the WB series, \"Unhappily Ever After,\" (Created by Ron Leavitt of Married with Children).\n\nThroughout his career, ANT has appeared on many series and specials including the remake of To Tell The Truth where he replaced Paula Poundstone as a regular celebrity panelist. Other shows include; Tosh.0, America's Next Top Model, The Insider, Kathy Griffin: My life on the D list, The Jamie Foxx Show, For your love, Son of a beach, Gene Simmons: Family Jewels, Sweet Valley High, Queer as Folk, Weekends at the DL, Nightstand, The Dennis Miller Show, But Can They Sing, Steve Harvey's Big Time, The Tyra Banks show, Comics Unleashed and many others.\n\nHis big opportunity came with NBC's Last Comic Standing. A weekly reality show featuring stand-up comedians competing to be crowned the funniest comic in America. Over 10,000 comedians tried out. ANT advanced all the way to the semi-finals in Las Vegas but did not make it into the house. The second season, he made it into the house and was 6th runner up out of hundreds of thousands of comedians. Then NBC ordered a third season of LCS, and the format was changed slightly. Season one would do battle against season two in LCS: The Battle of the Best. With ANT's hilarious help season (2) easily bested season one and went on to win every head to head challenge and ultimately the competition.\n\nHe used that forward momentum parlaying it into a hosting job on the VH1 series, Celebrity Fit Club. He has been the host of the hit series for 6 of its 7 unprecedented seasons (no other VH1 series has gone on to 7 seasons). That year he also released his hit live performance DVD entitled, \"ANT: America's Ready\".\n\nIn 1997, ANT moved out of his comfort zone, becoming a celebrity participant on the VH1 series, CelebraCadabra (magic with the stars). There he revealed a deep rooted fear of clowns. He was eliminated 2nd when dressed as a grocery store candy aisle; he was mauled by a rambunctious group of 2nd graders all vying for something sweet. After his departure from the series, the ratings tumbled and VH1 brought ANT back in subsequent episodes to appease angry fans.\n\nOver his career, ANT has appeared on numerous occasions on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno (9 times), The Howard Stern Radio show, and garnered his own series on MTV Network's Logo Channel which bears his name: The U.S of ANT.\n\nIn features, he can be seen in Twin Falls, Idaho, I am Comic, Circuit, Angels Baby!, Another Gay Movie, National Lampoon's Totally Baked, The Underground Comedy Movie (with Michael Clarke Duncan), and Sister Mary.\n\nHe has 3 siblings, Andrea, Althea and Frank.

His blog, \"The ANT colony\" attracts millions of visitors each year and has enlightened millions more with it's unique mixture of spirituality and humor.\n\nB. R. (Bobby) Harwell was born in Nashville, Arkansas on August 22, 1931. His first real taste of adventure came when, at the age of 18, he and his brother Bill signed on a Swedish freighter heading for India. The ship was forced to stop in Bermuda when a smoldering fire was discovered in the hold where he and Bill participated in an attempt to save the life of their trapped First Mate. The two of them later signed off the ship in India without proper papers. Considered illegals and getting no help from the US Embassy, their problem was solved by a caring Brit who was an agent for the Swedish ship they had recently left. B.R.'s adventures continued in Korea where he served in a combat medical group similar to the unit portrayed in the hit movie and TV series MASH. After the military he used the GI Bill to graduate Cum Laude from the University of Arkansas. Having a free spirit, he became a peregrinating observer of life, tasting it through an eclectic potpourri that included such diverse jobs as commercial fishing, hanging draperies, driving cabs, working in a skid row blood bank and teaching elementary school in a Miami ghetto. In the early eighties B. R. did his first print modeling job. From there he moved up to TV commercials and small roles in TV and film. At the age of 78 he wrote \"Flawed\", his first novel, which describes the frivolity of Hollywood commingled with incest, murder and betrayal.\n\nCasper was born in Birkerød, Denmark in 1968. In 1987, he bought a tape Of American stand up comedian Steve Martin. Casper admired the Oscar-host to-be greatly. As did his co-workers on _Casper & Mandrilaftalen (1999)_, Frank Hvam, Lasse Rimmer and Lars Hjortshøj, Casper started out in stand-up comedy. His work in this business led to a deal with Danish TV-network DR, and Casper started doing a children's show called Hvaffor en hånd (1991). After doing a couple of shows for the young Danish people, Casper hit the big time with quiz show _\"Husk lige tandbørsten\" (1994)_, which he hosted, with help from Annette Toftgårdm whom he later married. _\"Husk lige tandbørsten\" (1994)_ had made Casper the darling of Danish television. A status which was jeopardized with Casper's follow-up: Safari (1996), which he made with his friend Lars Hjortshøj. All though the show was not a hit with the average Danish family, Casper wasn't any less enthusiastic about his career. He hosted the Danish grammys, but again the average Dane was outraged at Casper, as the public deemed certain jokes from the show too rough.\n\nThree years after breaking through with _\"Husk lige tandbørsten\" (1994)_, Casper teamed up with a few friends, and made Tæskeholdet (1997). Casper's sense of humor hadn't changed, but the Danish public was getting used to it, and the show, which aired both in the radio in the morning and on TV on late evenings was a major hit, and Casper was back on top. The show aired on DR, but the concept was bought by competing TV-station TV2. What came of this was Darios Joint (1998), which went down the same road as Safari (1996). At this point, Casper decided something that would mark a radical change in his career and a new start with a new attitude towards his status.\n\nCasper thought everything over, and he decided that he would no longer care about how many viewers he had on his shows. He would base his work around what he personally wanted to do, and what he personally thought was funny. He opted for a new start, and the TV-network was DR2. A small station, which agreed to give Casper the freedom to do exactly what he wanted to do. Casper gathered a team of fellow stand-up comedians, some of which Casper had worked with before. The team that was eventually put together consisted of: Lars Hjortshøj, Casper's co-star from Safari (1996), Frank Hvam, who had written for different TV-shows, and had caught Casper's attention and Lasse Rimmer, a rather new name on Danish TV. The project ended up as Casper & Mandrilaftalen (1999). It received cult status, and was to be re-run several times, each time with a growing number of viewers tuning in. Then in 2001, Casper and Frank Hvam wrote and starred in the first real Danish sitcom, Langt fra Las Vegas (2001).\n\nChip Carriere is an actor and Louisiana-native based out of the artistically-diverse New Orleans area.

Chip's unwavering passion for the realm of entertainment evolved rapidly. While maintaining his love of acting, Chip attended and graduated from the Acadiana Law Enforcement Training Academy, after which he worked as an officer to support himself through college at University of Louisiana- Lafayette.\n\nIt was in 2011, as the film and television industry began to bloom in Louisiana's market, that his drive for a creative career took full focus.

The Leo was 5'4\" and, during her first years on Laverne & Shirley (1976), weighed a dainty 105 lbs. The brown haired, blue-eyed female was born the daughter of Francesca Bellini and Beachard Williams. Her father was an electronic technician, and Cindy grew up in reduced circumstances. She had one sister, Carol Ann Williams, and an older half-brother, Jim from her mother's first marriage.\n\nAs a child, she dreamed of being an actress. She used to create and perform her own plays and, as she grew, she wished that one day, Debbie Reynolds would see her in one of those amateur shows and whisk her away and put her in a film. Another thing that brought show business into her life was her alcoholic father's imitations of comics like Jackie Gleason and Milton Berle. She worked as a waitress, while she auditioned for commercials, television guest spots, and feature films. Her first step to fame was a movie in which she tap danced with Gene Kelly. She stepped on Kelly's foot, leaving her \"really embarrassed\". She landed important film roles early in her career.\n\nFamed director George Cukor cast her in Reisen mit meiner Tante (1972). Her next big role was for George Lucas in American Graffiti (1973), as Ron Howard's girlfriend, for which she earned a BAFTA nomination as Best Supporting Actress. That led to Francis Ford Coppola casting her in Der Dialog (1974). The three instant-classic films should have propelled her into movie stardom, but her career inexplicably hit a lull. She couldn't go back to working as a waitress, because she was too well-known.\n\nShe was set up in a writing team with Penny Marshall and the girls were called by Penny's brother, Garry Marshall, to do a stint as two fast girls on Happy Days (1974). The public received them so warmly that Cindy and Penny soon got their own show and was referred to everywhere as \"Shirley Feeney\".\n\nShe earned a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress in 1978. She left the show in 1982, pregnant with daughter Emily. She was married to Bill Hudson, who had previously been married to actress Goldie Hawn. Williams later gave birth to a son, Zachary, in 1986. She went on to make a few movies and co-produced \"The Father Of The Bride\" movies with Hudson. They divorced in 2000.\n\nShe did Jenny Craig commercials and acted on guest spots on the TV show For Your Love (1998) and reunited with Penny Marshall several times on television. In 2015, her memoir, Shirley, I Jest! (co-written with Dave Smitherman), was published.\n\nCindy Williams died, aged 75, following a brief, undisclosed illness, in 2023."
