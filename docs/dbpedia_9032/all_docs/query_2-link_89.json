        "text": "Just keep in mind that a level 54 build isnât the same as a level 72 build. Those 18 points will complete Maya. Youâre also about to enter a difficult phase of the game. Iâm talking about the thing that happens when your level 50 top gear just doesnât cut it anymore. The gear you listed are excellent choices, but they will soon fall behind.\n\n@Worblehatâs build is one that Iâd use myself at this stage. It fits with several COMâs and pretty much any gear. A Bee isnât exactly the beefiest shield in the game, and the Sandhawk can handle itself without it most of the time. As long as itâs on par with your level, that is. I suggest getting a shield that offers better protection. Unless you have some Golden keys to spend, Iâd suggest you start using the items that drop. They will do the job!\n\nDerches twisted pimp build is amazing.\n\nMaya is love, Maya is life.\n\nOk thanks. Also my Max is 61 I still gotta buy UVHM pack 2\n\nIâll check that out thanks!\n\nOk thanks man and also my sand hawk is lvl 52 and Iâm 55 so itâs a bit off thatâs kinda why I use the bee. But Iâll check that build out. Ty!\n\nItâs more a system of prioritizing Mayaâs key skills at that level, as you donât have a 72 build yet. You want Ruin, Wreck, Converge,and Res if co-op. Other great skills like Foresight, Cloud Kill, Reaper and Chain Reaction are used to get to Ruin. Similarly to get to Converge, you have useful skills depending on your build, but Ward and Suspension are consistently good in the most situations. @Worblehat 's build uses these to put together a great build that will work well at that level. I would start filling up Inertia instead of Elated, but thatâs a small tweak."
