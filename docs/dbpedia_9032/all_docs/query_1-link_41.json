        "text": "Committed to bringing differentiated programming, Discovery Kids is delighted to present a fun filled three-dimensional (3D) animated adventure series – MAYA THE BEE. With a continuous presence on television since 1976, MAYA THE BEE has achieved cult status for over 30 years. Based on the book, Die Biene Maja by Waldermar Bonsels, the character, Maya, defies ordinary ways of living and abides by her adventurous ways when it comes to dealing with challenging situations.\n\nMAYA THE BEE will air every day at 9 AM and 12 noon on Discovery Kids.\n\nMaya is a young bee filled with curiosity who loves discovering the world through learning and understanding life. As Maya explores the meadow where she lives, she meets other insects, plays to her heart’s content and shares her joy with friends. If a leaf floats onto the pond, Maya sees a sailing adventure waiting to happen. If there’s a flower that blooms once a year on a lonely hill top, Maya embarks on an expedition to see it. Her adventures sometimes lead her into trouble, but fortunately she has Skip, an avuncular grasshopper and Willy her best friend to help her out.\n\nRahul Johri, Senior Vice President and General Manager – South Asia, Discovery Networks Asia-Pacific, said, “We are excited to bring the cult series – Maya the Bee which enjoys popularity across generations. The series focuses on overcoming the challenges with the power of self-belief and great determination which will motivate kids to explore their creative mind.”\n\nMAYA THE BEE will offer kids a rule-breaking, adventurous journey alongside her courageous friends through the amazing life of a bee."
