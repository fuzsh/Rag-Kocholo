        "text": "Story\n\nThrilled by the arrival of Spring, Maya (voice of Coco Jack Gillies) takes her friend, Willy (Benson Jack Anthony), to explore the new growth and blossoms. They rescue an ant from some menacing beetles. The ant entrusts Maya and Willy with a very special golden orb and asks them to take it to the Bonsai Mountains.\n\nAlong the way, the friends team up with two comic soldier ants, Arnie and Barnie (the Umbilical Brothers). They all soon discover that the orb contains an ant princess, whom they name Smoosh.\n\nLed by the egotistical Romulus, the beetles are determined not to let the princess reach her destined home. They set out to stop Maya and Willy. But Maya is determined to overcome all obstacles and reach their final goal.\n\nThemes\n\nMild predatory behaviour; creatures in mild peril\n\nViolence\n\nMaya The Bee 3: The Golden Orb has some violence. For example:\n\nA stone ornament falls onto Willy’s head and smashes into pieces.\n\nGlow-worms enter the beehive and knock into things. They create some havoc.\n\nThe beetles chase the bees and ants several times.\n\nA beetle catapults Maya into the air.\n\nThe beetles are about to attack Greenleaf and get rid of the ants when birds attack them.\n\nThere is also some comic violence in this movie. It includes characters falling over and knocking into each other.\n\nSexual references\n\nThere are no sexual references in Maya The Bee 3: The Golden Orb.\n\nAlcohol, drugs and other substances\n\nThere’s no use of substances in Maya The Bee 3: The Golden Orb.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nThere’s no nudity and sexual activity in Maya The Bee 3: The Golden Orb.\n\nProduct placement\n\nThere are no products displayed or used in Maya The Bee 3: The Golden Orb.\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere’s no coarse language in Maya The Bee 3: The Golden Orb.\n\nIdeas to discuss with your children\n\nMaya The Bee 3: The Golden Orb is an animated movie about a little girl bee named Maya, who’s headstrong, brave and determined. It’s a cute movie that shows that insects often compete for territory but concludes that it’s better to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThis movie is suitable for children aged over 2 years, but very young children might be concerned that Maya is often in peril. Therefore we recommend parental guidance for children aged 2-5 years.\n\nThe movie’s main messages are about finding ways to resolve conflict peacefully, rather than through conflict and competition.\n\nValues in this movie that you could reinforce with your children include:\n\nbravery and courage\n\nfemale strength and leadership\n\nkindness.\n\nforgiveness\n\nhelp for people in need, even your enemies\n\nrespect for others\n\nteamwork.\n\nThis movie could also give you the chance to talk with your children about real-life issues like:\n\nwhy the beetles want to stop Maya and Willy reaching their goal\n\nwhy it’s good to work with and help others. For example, Maya helps a beetle in danger. In return, the beetle persuades other beetles to stop attacking Maya and her friends and work with them instead."
