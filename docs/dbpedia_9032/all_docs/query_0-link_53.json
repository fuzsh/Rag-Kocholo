        "text": "It's cool that you like what you like, but I don't really agree with this apparent \"you disagree with us and you're the only one who thinks this way so GO AWAY\" mentality that's been on display for a few pages. For the record, he's not the only one who thinks this way. The only reason you don't hear more people complaining is because many of us who were even halfway excited about this series coming to the states have already jumped ship after seeing how it was being handled. And I don't even care about playing the blame game and figuring out which company did what or who made what decision because it doesn't really matter. Bottom line, Doraemon has been heavily altered for North American television to the point where the only thing that connects it to the original Japanese version anymore is that it sometimes features the same footage. While everyone will agree that some changes were necessary, the general consensus is that a lot of these things didn't have to be done. It's great that you can still enjoy it, but you can't just automatically expect people to do the same. Mandouga may be attacking the show, but I don't think you're helping the thread very much with some of your responses either.\n\nAnd I get that this is apparently a sensitive subject in this thread, so I'll stop because I feel like I'm dragging us off-topic. Regardless of what I think about the American adaption, I'm sad that it seems to be doing so poorly in the ratings and I'm sorry for the fans who have enjoyed its run so far. At the very least, I was hoping that an increase of awareness of the brand would help ensure future (hopefully better) dubs and releases of other Doraemon material. I hope that things improve for the show!\n\nI wouldn't mind if Mandouga was actually bring something new to the conversation but he's literally saying the same time each time, how the adaption is apparently a failure with \"unnecessary\" edits. He's said it enough times, so I think he should stop repeating himself. Just look at all his old posts here. They're pretty much the same thing.\n\nNo, I pretty much said the opposite of that. I said that the edits make the show nearly indistinguishable among the mass of by-the-numbers Disney comedy pablum already on their networks. They wouldn't care whether or not it's edited because they have no reason to care about the show period. If they did care about it being edited, it would actually be a good thing because it would mean they at least care enough to know the show exists.\n\nLet me ask you something. Do you really think the edits are really making that big of a difference in the show? Because I don't see how these edits are hurting the show at all. Changing things like a doll to a journal or even cultural things yen to dollars aren't taking anything out of the show because the story is still progressing in the same way despite that. People don't care about the edits because the edits hardly matter. Most of the edits so far are either barely noticeable to the viewer or go by in a few seconds. They're at least being applied consistently and accurate. The only reason they're being noticed is because people like you keep pointing them out and making a huge fuss over it.\n\nThis isn't Disney being xenophobic, the dub is just changing certain details to make the situation more understandable to American kids. While some objects may get localized like yen to dollars or chopsticks to forks, they still get across the same message of the original. Changing the cultural setting from Japanese to American isn't making that big of a difference because it's not that important to the story. You can take the premise of a robot cat with gadgets from the future and pretty much apply it to almost any setting you like because the setting doesn't dramatically affect the story. Yeah, not all the editing is necessary, I don't understand some of it myself, but still, who's going to care about something like if it was a doll or journal? The main point of the situation was that the kids were putting a personal belonging of theirs into a time capsule, so it doesn't matter which item it was. And even though they localized certain things, the dub still leaves in objects that are native to Japan, like sumo wrestlers, ninjas and samurais and even certain Japanese food. They even called dorayaki by its original name when it was first introduced.\n\nWith these ratings? Not likely. The show will likely be gone soon, and if it ever does get another shot in the US you'll likely see a more respectful dub, or at the very least one that retains more original humor.\n\nI don't know how if you know this, but it's not that simple to retain the same humor that the Japanese version has. They have to change certain lines because not everything that is funny to the Japanese is going to make sense to American audiences, and not only that, they have to make sure it fits with the characters' lip movements and sounds natural to the ear. So, sorry, but the dub can't simply keep the exact same sense of humor that the original had. It has to take its own liberties in some ways.\n\nI don't understand what you mean by \"standard Disney humor\", but I thought the humor suited the show just fine because the dialogue fit within the context of the situation and sounds very characteristic of what the person would say. While the dialogue may not be exactly the same as the original, it is at least getting across the same general message that the original was giving and not changing it completely by \"gag dubbing\" like certain other anime dubs. As far as I'm concerned, the humor that comes from all the crazy situations in the show is still there, and in my opinion, that's the most important element of the show's comedy. And with all the zany things that are already happening in the show, whatever humor the dub has only serves to supplement to that zaniness. You say that the dub is not respectful, but from what I've seen, it's taken more risks and is more accurately translated than other anime dubs for children.\n\nOkay, so... I thought I should touch upon my opinions of the dubs. As I said prior, I feel the dub is a mixture of emotions for me. In some ways, it does a really good job, in other ways, it does not.\n\nLet's talk about the good for new.\n\nFirst off, let's go over the adaptation, or rather, the good parts of it. For the most part, the voice acting presented in the dub is rather very good. Most of the voices fit the characters rather well. Although Johnny Yong Bosch as Nobita was an unusual casting decision, I feel he does a rather good job as him, without resorting to making him sound older than he actually is. Doraemon, himself, sounds really good and a good match up to his Japanese voice in my mind. Shizuka (or Sue) sounds rather young and comes across as an innocent, sweet girl. To me, this hits the right notes for what I expect for the character. Gian (or Big G) and Suneo (or Sneech) also fit rather well for the characters that they are supposed to represent. As for the others, everyone else seems to be casted well, and I don't have an issue with how the voices generally sound. The voice acting, generally speaking, is top notch.\n\nAs for the script, from what me and my friends have been able to determine, the script is fairly accurate to the original Japanese version. Sometimes a little too close for comfort, at that. Usually the script represents well to the original Japanese version, unless something has been altered culturally or has had changes made to the name or footage, otherwise it tends to try and stick close to the original version. I'm generally happy with how the script has turned out for it, which is much better than what one would expect from a dub of this nature. However, having said that, while all the above points are rather good in my mind, I am not happy with the other changes that have been applied to the show.\n\nLet's talk about the bad points in this dub. First off, let's talk about one of the biggest offenders, in my opinion, of this dub: The music. While the Japanese version was always a bit more whimsical in it's approach how it used the music, somethings a bit more spastic at times, it was always appropriate in nature. However, the American music reminds me of 4Kids musical scores... Which, to me, is a very bad thing. The dub music tends to be rather generic-synth, where it uses the usual style to \"admit emotion\" seen in 4Kids dubs. Though more often than not, it tends to just replace the music, rather than just play 24/7, which is probably the only good thing of this score. Personally, I find the score distracting. It doesn't feel \"in-place\", rather as a way to distract me more often than not what is going on in the scene. Where the original music, most the times, fits the scenes and doesn't offer that said distraction. It makes me feel emerged in the scene, where the dub music doesn't offer such a value to me. Also, the fact we also lost out in the Japanese Opening or the original Doraemon theme song from the 79 series that carried into this series, is hugely disappointing in my eyes.\n\nNow, as for the second biggest offense to this dub, is the culture change. In fact, I'd argue this bothers me more than the music change, but honestly it's not as distracting as it, so it's on a lesser offense.\n\nI'm a little less bothered by some of the name changes, though I do feel they are unneeded. The more curious one is the fact they felt the need to change Nobita's name, which to me doesn't make any sense. It's always a short, easy name to remember. For that matter, most of the characters names are generally easy to remember even. With Takeshi's nickname being Gian (short for Giant), Shizuka being a short name as well, the only name I feel that might pose a problem is Suneo, but again, it's generally a short name to remember. However, on one side, Americanizing names generally does help a kid whose language isn't Japanese, attach themselves to the characters better, so I generally allow these to slide. The thing, however, that bothers me more is the other changes of this nature. Not only are they completely removing the fact this show takes place in Japan, they've gone as far as to change even chopsticks to forks, which to me bothers me, especially since chop-sticks aren't just inherently Japanese and are used in other Asian cultures as food utensils. I don't think a kid seeing Japanese culture things will turn one off from the show: If anything, it would make the kid curious and ask their parents what they are if they don't know. To me, I find that more beneficial to keep a culture in tact in a show, as it allows a kid to learn more about where the show is from. With the fact they're trying to remove that, that minor educational value is gone.\n\nThere are also other changes I find that are unneeded, but I feel I probably could be on this for hours if I try to focus on every little thing that this show has altered, so I won't bother with this. Sadly, the worst part about all this, is even if Doraemon hadn't been forced to have these changes, the show would've never been released in dual audio, regardless. TV Asahi has made it so distribution of the Japanese audio is disallowed. This extends to the 79 series as well. However, broadcasts of the Japanese audio have been allowed, despite this. Not sure of the reason, but I realize it's probably been part of the reason Doraemon had not seen release to video here prior, as it's not a show that could survive on a dub only video release without TV exposure.\n\nHowever, despite my problems with the alterations made to the show, I feel ultimately that's not what's turning kids away from the show. It's probably two things: Kids just don't like the show, in general, or feel they have any attachment to the character, or the other side of the coin, the show's timeslot has been affecting people tuning into the show. It could also be both, really. I don't think the alterations are enough to turn kids away from the show, as generally speaking, the main plot lines haven't been altered, nor character personalities and the like.\n\nEither way, another problem I have with this dub, and I feel a bit strongly towards, is I do not want this dub to become the international standard. I know people who are fans of this show who are overseas buddies of mine. Especially in places like Spain and Portugal, where the Doraemon series is at the height of it's popularity, where I feel if this dub was introduced to those countries, it could actually hurt the brand.\n\nAt any rate, part of me wants this show to succeed, because it would allow for the network to invest interest in airing other dubs, but at the same time, my concern of this succeed could affect other markets and ultimately it's popularity, with changes to an already established market that could hurt the show in a long run. So I'm, generally speaking, mixed about this.\n\nAnd that, honestly, is my opinion of this as a whole."
