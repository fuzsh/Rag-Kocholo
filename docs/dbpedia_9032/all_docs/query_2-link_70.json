        "text": "Nippon Animation (日本アニメーション, Nippon Animēshon) is a Japanese animation studio.[1] The company is headquartered in Tokyo, with chief offices in the Ginza district of Chūō and production facilities in Tama City.\n\nNippon Animation is known for producing numerous anime series based on works of Western literature such as Anne of Green Gables and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, co-founders of Studio Ghibli, directed several episodes in the World Masterpiece Theater series.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWhat is now Nippon Animation is descended from Zuiyo Eizo (Zuiyo Enterprises), an animation studio that produced several popular series in the early and mid-1970s, including 1974's Heidi, Girl of the Alps, an adaptation of Johanna Spyri's popular children's book Heidi.[2] The Heidi anime was enormously popular in Japan (and later in Europe, and the feature-length edit of the TV series saw a U.S. VHS release in 1985). Zuiyo Eizo soon found itself in financial trouble because of the high production costs of a series (presumably Maya the Bee) it was attempting to sell to the European market.\n\nIn 1975, Zuiyo Eizo was split into two entities: Zuiyo, which absorbed the debt and the rights to the Heidi anime, and Nippon Animation, which was essentially Zuiyo Eizo's production staff (including Miyazaki and Takahata). Officially, Nippon Animation Co., Ltd. was established on 3 June 1975 by company president Kōichi Motohashi. The newly rechristened Nippon Animation found success right away with Maya the Bee and A Dog of Flanders (both of which began as Zuiyo Eizo productions), which became the first entry in the World Masterpiece Theater series to be produced under the Nippon Animation name. Hayao Miyazaki left Nippon Animation in 1979 in the middle of the production of Anne of Green Gables to make the Lupin III feature The Castle of Cagliostro.\n\nBody of work[]\n\nIn addition to the World Masterpiece Theater series, Nippon Animation has also produced many other series based on Western works of literature, as well as original works and adaptations of Japanese manga. Especially, until Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair (1992), its peak of productions based on Western works of literature. Many of these are included in the list of the studio's works below.\n\nOf the studio's productions not based on Western literature, the most popular is undoubtedly Chibi Maruko-chan (1990), based on the popular manga by Momoko Sakura. At its peak, this slice-of-life anime about an unusually intelligent elementary-school-aged girl and her family and friends managed an audience rating of nearly 40%, making it one of the highest-rated anime series ever (and the highest-rated anime program in Japanese history at the time).\n\nWorks adapted from Western literature[]\n\nWorld Masterpiece Theater series[]\n\nMain article: World Masterpiece Theater\n\nOther TV series[]\n\nVicky the Viking (小さなバイキング ビッケ?, Chiisana Viking Bikke) – 1974 (began as Zuiyo Eizo production)\n\nMaya the Honey Bee (みつばちマーヤの冒険, Mitsubachi Māya no Bōken) – 1975 (began as Zuiyo Eizo production)\n\nLaura, The Prairie Girl (草原の少女ローラ, Sōgen no shōjo Rōra (Laura, Girl of the Prairies)) – 1975\n\nArabian Nights: Sinbad's Adventures (Arabian Naitsu: Shinbaddo No Bôken) – 1975\n\nThe Adventures of Piccolino (Pikorīno no Bōken) – 1976\n\nLittle Lulu and Her Little Friends (Little Lulu to Chicchai Nakama) – 1976\n\nMonarch: The Big Bear of Tallac (Kuma no Ko Jacky) – 1977\n\nFuture Boy Conan (Mirai Shonen Conan) – 1978, a Hayao Miyazaki work\n\nBannertail: The Story of Gray Squirrel (Seton Dobutsuki Risu no Banner) – 1979\n\nRuy, the Little Cid (Little El Cid no Bouken) – 1980, co-production with BRB Internacional\n\nHeart (Cuore): An Italian Schoolboy's Journal (Ai no Gakko Cuore Monogatari) – 1981\n\nDogtanian and the Three Muskehounds (Wanwan Sanjushi, The Three Musketeers) – 1981; co-production with BRB Internacional (Madrid, Spain)\n\nThe New Adventures of Maya the Bee (Shin Mitsubachi Maaya no Boken) – 1982\n\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Fushigi no Kuni no Arisu) – 1983\n\nAround the World with Willy Fog (Anime 80 Sekai Isshu) – 1983 (In Spain), 1987 (In Japan); co-production with BRB Internacional\n\nManga Aesop's Fables – 1983\n\nBosco Adventure (Bosco Daiboken) – 1986\n\nGrimm's Fairy Tale Classics (Grimm Meisaku Gekijo/Shin Grimm Meisaku Gekijo) – 1987–1989\n\nJungle Book Shōnen Mowgli (2 October 1989 – 29 October 1990)\n\nJeanie with the Light Brown Hair (Kaze no Naka no Shojo Kinptasu no Jeannie) – 1992\n\nTV specials[]\n\nManxmouse (Tondemo Nezumi Daikatsuyaku) (30 June 1979)\n\nAnne's Diary: The Story of Anne Frank (Anne no Nikki: Anne Frank Monogatari) (28 September 1979)\n\nBack to the Forest (Nodoka Mori no Dobutsu Daisakusen, English titles: Peter of Placid Forest, Back to the Forest) (3 February 1980)\n\nThe Story of Fifteen Boys (Hitomi no Naka no Shonen Jugo Shonen Hyoryuki) (19 October 1987)\n\nOther works[]\n\nTV series[]\n\nDokaben (6 October 1976 – 26 December 1979)\n\nAttack on Tomorrow (4 April 1977 – 5 September 1977)\n\nBlocker Gundan 4 Machine Blaster – 1977 (co-production with Ashi Productions)\n\nGinguiser (Chogattai Majutsu Robot Ginguiser) (co-production with Ashi Productions) – 1977\n\nI'm Teppei (Ore wa Teppei) – 1977\n\nCharlotte (Wakakusa no Charlotte) – 1977\n\nThe Casebook of Charlotte Holmes (Angie Girl, Jouo Heika no Petite Angie) – 1977\n\nPoetry of the Baseball Enthusiasts (Yakyū-kyō no Uta) (23 December 1977 – 26 March 1979)\n\nHaikara-san ga Tōru (Smart-san, Mademoiselle Anne) – 1978\n\nHighschool Baseball Ninja (Ikkyu-san) – 1978\n\nMisha the Bear Cub (Koguma no Misha) – 1979\n\nSeton Dobutsuki Risu no Banner – 1979\n\nSanpei the Fisherman (Fisherman Sanpei) – 1980\n\nFootball in Action (Fútbol en acción) – 1981\n\nThe Many Dream Journeys of Meme – 1983\n\nNoozles (Fushigi na Koara Burinkii, Blinky and Printy) – 1984\n\nElves of the Forest (Mori no Tonto Tachi) – 1984 (co-production with Shaft)\n\nBumpety Boo (Hey!
