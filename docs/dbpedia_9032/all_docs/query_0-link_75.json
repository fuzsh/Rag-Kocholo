        "text": "Our bus pulled up to a small shopfront on a crowded street and we jumped out of the vehicle as fast as we could to maintain eyes on our bags. We pushed passed the barrage of people offering us a ride to our hotel in their tuk-tuk until we realized our “free hotel pick-up” wasn’t coming. We then loaded up in the back of the nearest tuk-tuk, having to pay a whopping $4 for the 10 minute ride to our hotel. The horror! Overpaying by $1 – $1.50! I think that’s really the first time we realized that Siem Reap, and largely populated Cambodia ran on the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe next clue we had was later that evening, once we had checked into our less-than-luxury hotel, cleaned up, and made a plan for the night, when we went to withdraw cash from a machine and our only option was to pull out USD vs. the Cambodian Riel. It was weird to hold our home currency again. No longer were these paper bills Monopoly money…\n\nOn our first night in Siem Reap, we were eager beavers to see what the new country had to offer, but we were also incredibly nervous. Not nervous about a language barrier or crime or anything like that… no… we were worried about getting food poisoning. If I had a dollar for every person we met on these travels who either had a horror story about food poisoning in Cambodia or who had a friend who had a horror story, I could probably buy like 50 Cambodian beers (OK, so they’re fairly cheap). Anyway, we were both overly conscious about food safety, so instead of “stumbling” across a dinner place or opting for street food like we often ended up doing in Thailand, we did research and planned to go to a restaurant that had good reviews.\n\nUnfortunately for us, apparently there is a huge foodie scene in Siem Reap (of all places!). There are tons of experiential restaurants, set menu places, and unbeknownst to us, many places that require a reservation. We were shocked to find this out! In the poorest country in SE Asia, we had troubling eating at “expensive” restaurants?! Wild.\n\nWe lucked out on the first evening as the restaurant we arrived at at around 6:30pm said they could squeeze us in at 9:30pm without a reservation. Satisfied with this, we put our name in and turned to find a bar to hang out at for awhile. A few doors down we saw a mostly empty open air joint with $1 drinks and a pool table. Yes please!\n\nA couple handfuls of mojitos (and some fries) later, we were shredding the pool table before the bartender himself put us both to shame. In between serving customers, he and Aaron played a rousing few games. Later in the evening we got to chatting with a few Aussie/New Zealand travelers who bought us each a beer and told us of their tales of Vietnam in exchange for our adventures in Thailand. Before we knew it, it was 9:45pm and we were running back toward our dinner reservation with grumbling stomachs.\n\nDinner was really good. I think we ended up with a curry that we dipped vegetables in, a pomelo salad, and some spring rolls. Everything was incredibly flavorful, spicy, fresh, and balanced. This was Cambodian fusion and it was pretty damn good. I think the damage for the bill that night was around $15, which is very expensive for SE Asia dining (and for our meals on that portion of the trip), but for the caliber of food and the dining experience that could rival any big city, it was a bargain.\n\nDay 2 – The Small Circuit\n\nBefore I dive deeper into some of the historical temples we visited, allow me to take a step back and educate you just a bit on Siem Reap and Angkor Wat, just in case you’re not familiar with why it’s important… because, full disclosure, before I got to Asia I didn’t really know what Angkor Wat was.\n\nAngkor is one of the most important and most well-known archaeological sites in SE Asia. It’s over 250 square miles and consists of many temples, ancient water structures, and communication routes. For centuries, Angkor was the center of the Khmer Kingdom. The site exemplifies cultural, religious, and symbolic values as well as containing high architectural and archaeological and artistic significance.\n\nThe temples within Angkor were built between 800AD and 1300AD, during which time over 27 different kings ruled the large territory. The temples are thought to have been abandoned around the 15th century, and many remain in a well-preserved state today.\n\nThe most well-known and notable (and best preserved) of these temples is Angkor Wat, the pride of the Cambodian people. It was originally constructed as a Hindu temple for the Khmer Empire at the beginning of the 12th century, but gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple toward the end of that century. It combines two types of Khmer temple architecture – the temple-mountain and the galleried temple. It was designed to represent Mount Meru, the home of the devas in Hindu mythology. Within a moat and an outer wall are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the center of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west, the significance is still disputed. Angkor Wat is celebrated for its grand architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs, and for the devatas adorning its walls.\n\nSo, you know, this place is old, grand, and historically significant. Sounds like a place people should visit!\n\nWe were far from the minority of people who thought this would be a cool place to visit. In fact, in 2014, Angkor Wat saw upwards of 2.4 million visitors. It’s a big deal! It also attracts people from all over the world with all manner of economic diversity… read: you have incredibly poor locals and travelers rubbing elbows with wealthy Australians, Chinese, Russians, Americans, and more. It’s actually quite an interesting collision of worlds.\n\nBecause the Angkor region is so vast, often visitors book tours, cars, or tuk-tuks to take them around each day between temples. You can definitely bike from temple to temple, but with the high heat, beating sun, and knowledge of the locals, it’s often more worthwhile to just book a fairly inexpensive driver for the day and be carted from place to place.\n\nWe awoke early that day. We had pre-booked our very own tuk-tuk driver to take us around to some of the temples, including Angkor Wat. Water in our bag, sunscreen on our faces, camera (phone) fully charged, we marched out of our hotel around 8:30am to meet your driver – Jim.\n\nJim loaded us into the back of this tuk-tuk, offered us some water, and then took off, heading north. Our first stop: to buy our tickets. Day tickets aren’t cheap at $20/person but when you consider that you’re gaining access to the entire Angkor region and over 20 different temples, I think it kind of evens out. There is one main road from Siem Reap to Angkor and as you can imagine in the mornings, it’s packed. Tour buses essentially parked, Toyota Corollas inching up the road, bikers pedaling with tunnel vision as fast as they can on the sides of the road, and then all the chariot-like tuk-tuks, awkwardly weaving through the traffic.\n\nIt became evident quickly that Jim knew what he was doing. He maneuvered through traffic effortlessly, yet drove in a manner that exuded control and safety. Plus he was wearing a helmet and jacket in the heat, which told me, he valued life. Ha!\n\nHe pulled off at the ticket station and the crowd was thick. We hopped out and followed signs to purchase our ‘one-day’ pass. You can buy multi-day passes at a discount but since we were only really there for two full days, we didn’t need a multi-day pass. Lucky for us, the one-day lines were the shortest. We only had to wait a few minutes before we stepped up, forked over $40 and had our photos taken. Less than a minute later, we were handed our passes with printed photos and we were on our way.\n\nWe dodged sweaty tourists waiting in their long lines for multi-day passes (thankful that wasn’t us) and went to find Jim. Hmm. Well, now that was dumb. When departing our tuk-tuk, we were so eager to get our tickets we didn’t think to find something recognizable about our driver or the vehicle. But now walking back out into a sea of helmeted drivers and tuk-tuks, it seemed like we had just come upon a group of Stormtroopers.\n\nThankfully, Jim found us. An impressive feat in a crowd of white people with similarly darting eyes.\n\nWe hopped aboard, Jim again expertly navigated traffic to get us out of the ticket area, and we were off. First stop… Angkor Wat.\n\nAs it was still morning and the temple faces west, unfortunately a lot of it was backlit. It’s annoying for photos and it actually impacted some of the views with our own eyes… it was a little hard to see some of the finer details of the temple from afar. But when entering the grounds, it became clear that this place was massive, in fantastic condition, and was quite an architectural feat.\n\nWe walked across the moat and entered the first building, which then led to the courtyard that boasted the best views of the five towers. We began our tour by walking through the galleries… long halls that framed in the inner courtyard and the towers. The gallery walls were each lined with fantastic reliefs, some in better shape than others. They told the stories of battle, but also incorporated religion and communication. They were massive and old and very cool to see.\n\nThe hallways and the ceiling structures were also something to see. The patchwork, how the stone had shifted over time, the precision cuts, the peek-a-boo views. The detail work on each wall, each pillar, each doorway was astonishing. This contrast of such a massive, grand structure with such attention to the tiniest detail was fascinating.\n\nThe only thing that really peeved us were the, what I would refer to as, graffiti, carved into some of the walls. Whether it was drawings or names, it seemed really unfathomable to deface such a piece of history. But as Aaron reminded me, who knows how long those carvings had been there, considering how old the structure was. Those could be historical in their own right.\n\nAfter getting our fill of the galleries, we decided it was time to enter the inner courtyard and check out the towers. As we entered, I noticed a long line winding around the courtyard and told Aaron to go figure out what it was for while I got in it. Turns out, it was to visit the inside of the central tower, so we maintained our position in the long queue.\n\nThere was a group of incredibly loud and rude tourists behind us, who spilled water on me twice and I remember being so enraged as we stood there in the heat, I kept telling Aaron “this better be worth it.” After about 35 minutes of being mentally accosted by my own annoyance, we were up next to climb the stairs and tour the central tower. We climbed the incredibly steep and slightly rickety stairs to the top, catching our breath before heading inside.\n\nThe stone work in central tower was similar to the galleries but there were also some small, really beautiful courtyards to explore. The killer part about the tower was the views of the grounds below. The Angkor Wat structures spread out in front of us, edged in by a green forest… in all directions. If you ignored the crowds and the water tower in the distance, it was easy to be transported back in history. This view really reminded me of just how old these structures really were. Well, kind of… I have a hard time fathoming ancient history or really anything before the 1700s, so………\n\nAngkor Wat = really quite amazing. It’s official!\n\nWe exited the maze of a property and found ourselves in a similar predicament as at the ticket station – trying to find Jim. There were suddenly hundreds of tuk-tuks, most were parked under the shade of what few trees there were. The drivers themselves were doing what they could to entertain themselves while their passengers toured. Some played cards or on their phone, others lounged in their friends’ trucks shooting the breeze, yet others strung up hammocks in the under cover portion of their tuk-tuks and napped. Genius!\n\nOut of nowhere, Jim popped out with the vehicle and we were on our way to the next stop, Angkor Thom. We stopped along the way, at Jim’s insistence, to take some photos at the entrance of the property. There was an old bridge with many decapitated sculptures that at one point in time, looked to be all connected either pulling or pushing on a rope, no doubt as a way to intimidate outsiders coming upon the temple. The entrance archway also presented a little preview of the temple we were about to visit, with a single face carved into the center of it.\n\nWe continued down the road, passing a few elephants (you know, because that’s normal), until we arrived at Angkor Thom.\n\nThis place was really awesome. It’s most grand temple – Bayon – was worn down, crumbling, but still maintained enough for us to imagine its original form.\n\nPlus, and this is something I found crazy at all the temples we visited, it was totally acceptable to walk and crawl all over the temple. We scaled ancient, steep, totally unsafe steps to get a different view of the place. A very cool experience.\n\nThe most recognizable trait of the Bayon temple in Angkor Thom is the structures with the faces, still incredibly well preserved. They were striking and a little haunting… echoing the reminder that these ancient ruins were once bursting with people.\n\nWe climbed up to the high, central tower and saw the degrading stone more close up. It felt very Tomb Raider-y or Indiana Jones-y.\n\nNext up, we walked over toward the nearby temple, Baphuon. We accessed Baphuon via its long catwalk – this temple was another crumbling beauty from afar. We didn’t waste much time in climbing a few sets of steep staircases to access the views from the top.\n\nWe walked around more of the Angkor Thom grounds after that, stumbling on the occasional temple or remote, crumbling structure. Tromping through ancient history, avoiding the occasional hawkers trying to tell us cold drinks, fruit, or a visit to an orphanage.\n\nJust before we connected back up with our driver, we came upon group of little souvenir stands. Behind the stands was a large trash pile, overflowing from a dumpster. I wouldn’t normally have thought anything of this, but I noticed a woman kneeling next to the trash pile, a camera pressed to her face. When we moved in a little closer, we saw movement. My first guess was rats… large rats.\n\nBut, it was not rats. It was monkeys! A family of them, picking through trash, trying to find discarded coconuts to munch on.\n\nI was delighted! I had never seen monkeys like this in the (semi) wild. To top it off, Aaron even pointed to one of the female monkeys and said, “do you see the baby.” OH MY GOD…the tiniest, cutest, brown little monkey was clinging to its mother, letting go only to shovel coconut into its mouth. I, for one, think basically all baby animals are pretty adorable. But this? This was another level of cuteness. Aaron basically had to drag me away from the trash pile and off to find lunch of our own.\n\nJim suggested a place for us to dine in the shade and under the breeze of a fan. Aaron and I ordered rice, greens, and meat, and dined while a local cat ‘meowed’ and begged for food from basically all the diners but us. Typical cat, avoiding the easy targets. But this cat did provide quite a bit of entertainment for us so we were sad when it scaled one of the pillars of the dining structure and disappeared above the tarpped ceiling. As we finished up our lunch and readied ourselves for the second half of the day, we noticed something in the corner of our eyes… movement from above. Just like that, the adorable little beggar cat had reappeared, balancing on a beam above us, only this time, she carried a tiny orange kitten in her mouth. Cuteness overload. On top of that, she then managed to get herself down from the beam, via clawing her way down a pillar, maintaining her grip on her kitten the entire time. It was hilarious to watch. She had mad skills.\n\nBack on the road, unfortunately without a new kitty or monkey friend securely in our possession, we exited Angkor Thom. We stopped by a few other, smaller temples including Chapel of the Hospital and Chau Say Tevoda, which were far less busy, smaller scale, but still incredibly beautiful.\n\nOur second-to-last stop of the day, and what turned out to be our favorite temple, was the crowd-pleaser Ta Prohm. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Ta Prohm was left in mostly the same condition that it was found. The result are grounds where ruins and trees have aged as one and fused into each other. Visiting was an earthy, eerie experience and it was as easy to photograph the trees as much as the structures.\n\nWhile many other temples bred a feeling of adventure and discovery for me, this one was a bit more mysterious and ghostly. The result of an abandon building with centuries for stories to tell, clamoring to whisper its history to visitors.\n\nTa Prohm was used as a location in the film Tomb Raider and I read that although the movie to many “visual liberties” with other Angkorian temples, the scenes of Ta Prohm were more or less true to the temple’s appearance, which is a testament to what this thing is like to experience.\n\nEven though we were tired and hot after a day of hiking over ruins, climbing stairs, and sweating under the sun, we spent quite a while wandering the property… and getting lost a few times.\n\nOur final (and shortest) stop of the day was Banteay Kdei. This temple was built in a similar style as Ta Prohm but felt far less preserved. When we entered one of the main rooms, a bald-headed woman – I’m not sure if she was actually a bhikkhuni (female Buddhist monk) – stood in the room with incense ready to offer up a blessing for some money. This wasn’t the first time we had encountered this, but for whatever reason, Aaron insisted I give her money and as I went to do it, he ran out of the room leaving me alone with the woman.\n\nI placed my dollar in the collection bowl and she handed me a lit stick of incense to stick in another bowl in a shrine, representing a sacred offering. She then performed baci, the tradition of tying a string around my wrist for good luck. It was a cool experience, although I’m not 100% how authentic the whole thing was.\n\nWe poked in and out of a few rooms after that, but decided that ultimately we were hot and tired and ready for some air conditioning.\n\nWe headed back to find Jim and trek back to our hotel. Because we had booked the tuk-tuk through the hotel owner, we weren’t sure how much of our actual ride fee was going to the driver, so we tipped Jim about $3 for his escorting service – he seemed really thrilled and thanked us. We told him we were still trying to decide what we wanted to do the next day but if we required a car, we would love to have him drive us again. We asked if he had a card or a way to get ahold of him but he said ‘no,’ but we could talk to him about it later that evening. At first we were a little puzzled until he explained that he also worked the night shift at our hotel’s reception. Ha!\n\nThat evening, Aaron and I ventured out for dinner with one first-choice restaurant in mind, and one backup, just in case we couldn’t get into our first choice. Wouldn’t you know it, they were both booked solid for the entire evening. WTF?! I guess that’s what you get when your town boasts really cool sights, attracting people at all different income levels… an awesome, unattainable food scene. We walked around the ‘backpacker’ part of town for awhile before deciding we really hated the scene – loud, drunk kids, copious bars, overpriced pizza joints, and insatiable peddlers – we quickly ate some sub-par food at one of the only Cambodian restaurants we could find, then opted to just head back to the hotel and rest up for the next day.\n\nDay 3 – New Year’s Eve in Siem Reap\n\nDecember 31 – New Year’s Eve – dawned a scorcher in Siem Reap. After we coughed down a grim breakfast in our hotel’s restaurant (also, for the record TripAdvisor recommended the Avallon Hotel, but it kinda blew), we caught up with Jim. After doing the quick math, we realized this guy had just driven us around from 8:30am – 3:00pm the previous day, had a few hours for a break (or maybe picking up a few rides in town), then came back and worked from 11pm – 7:00am, before picking us back up at 8:30am. Wow.\n\nHe greeted us with a big smile and this time a cooler full of cold water for our journey. The first stop of the day was Banteay Srei, but that required about a 45 minute tuk-tuk ride from our hotel to the temple. After another quick pit stop to retrieve our single-day tickets at the Angkor entrance, we set off.\n\nI kind of feel like the ride itself was worth the price of admission. We started off on familiar roads in the immediate Angkor complex, but soon we were out of civilization surrounded by open fields. Pastoral scenes mixed with quick blips through tiny towns whizzed past us in the backseat of our tuk-tuk. Out here, out in the farmland, it started to feel a bit like Siargao Island had. The abundance of banana and palm trees, the children playing the the street, the half-completed concrete structures, and, frankly, the poverty, was feet away from our moving vehicle.\n\nJim delivered us to Banteay Srei and we stepped out under the sun to a surprising amount of people. We had figured that since this temple was so far afield, it might be less populated than some of the popular ones so close to Siem Reap. We were wrong.\n\nThe temple remains themselves were small, but quite stunning. The amount of detail still visible on the old stone was surprising and just about every person there wanted individual photos with the grand, pink doorways.\n\nBanteay Srei is a 10th-century temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It’s built largely of red sandstone, lending itself to elaborate decorative carvings. The buildings are miniature in scale, compared to other Angkorian construction, and the temple is widely praised as a “precious gem” or the “jewel of Khmer art.”\n\nAfter walking through the temple ruins, we strolled around the grounds for a bit, which also played home to some wetlands. The surroundings were quite beautiful, as soft mountains rose in the distance. We bypassed the young kids trying to sell us postcards, questioning us “What is your name, where are you from, how long are you here?” before launching into their sales pitch. We were all too familiar with their strategy at this point.\n\nWe joined back up with Jim and hit the road back south. Jim had a few ideas of other places we should visit that day, so we were now at his mercy. And unfortunately, I cannot remember the names of any of the other temples we visited that day because I never looked them up on the map, so we’ll have to use the whole “Maya naming system” again.\n\nOur first stop on Jim’s Greatest Hits was the Elephant Temple, rightfully named after the four stone elephants that flanked the four corners of the outer wall. Aaron and I both really liked this temple and it wasn’t so crowded. It had well-preserved towers all over it, and one central tower taller than the others. We walked around the elevated platform for a bit before entering the central structure.\n\nInside was just a room about 7 feet by 7 feet in size and there was a temple guard who thrust a lit stick of incense in my hand as I entered, which I thought was unusual as she was not a religious figure. I stuck the stick in the proper place on the shrine and was then pestered about giving money before I could leave the room. Lovely. Aaron, once again, had just abandon ship. What a gentleman.\n\nAfter the Elephant Temple, Jim suggested we get some lunch and pointed out a good place to eat. There, we ordered as Jim lounged in a hammock nearby. We got to talking with him a bit and he soon joined us at the table as we waited for our food.\n\nIf I had to guess, Jim is probably 20 years old. He’s a skinny, shorter guy, with deep brown skin, jet-black hair, and dark eyes. His demeanor is quiet and unassuming, not aggressive like some of the other local men we had encountered. His English was limited but we were able to have a mostly-understandable conversation with him. In not long at all, we learned that he was engaged to be married, that he was working hard to be able to afford to pay his fiancee’s mother for her daughter’s hand in marriage ($3,000) and that he worked…. all.the.time.\n\nJim was originally from a very poor family north of the capital city of Phnom Penh. He moved to Siem Reap when he was a teenager to look for work and ended up working security for an Australian man’s business. At night, he started taking English-language classes and in only three months, had learned enough to have tangible conversations with people. We could hardly believe this because his English was so good.\n\nBefore the Australian’s business failed, he gave Jim a loan in order to buy his own tuk-tuk and essentially use it as a second income. Within the past few years, Jim had also met the owner of the hotel we were staying at and had gotten a job working reception. Jim told us that he worked every single day of the week and never took a day off. He worked the night shift at the hotel, and would leave early to take tourists up to Siem Reap to catch the sunrise. Many of his days were spent ferrying people around like he was doing for us, then he’d have a brief period in the afternoon to rest until he was back to work at the hotel. We had a hard time translating our pay structure question, but he said he was just paid monthly (vs. hourly) working for the hotel, which I can’t imagine was much of an income. This kid was completely charming and Aaron and I agreed he was probably one of the hardest working people we had ever met. I’m so happy we had this brief time to chat with him because it was really humbling.\n\nAfter lunch, we jumped back in our chariot and motored off to the next temple. This place I will call the Temple of Secrets. The ancient temple itself was maze-like and had incredible carvings in stone. But what was so cool was that the stones had settled and moved over centuries, giving the reliefs an abstract look. The rubble and stilts at this temple was especially funny, and we walked around in amazement.\n\nWhen we reached the back of the temple, we noticed a dirt path leading away toward an archway at the edge of the property, with a familiar face carved into the top. We decided to check it out, even though we had seen our fair share of these face carvings.\n\nAs soon as we passed through the archway that spit us out into a small courtyard on the other side, we knew why this archway was so special. Not visible from the front side was a massive tree whose roots were so tightly entwined with the stone it gave the illusion that 20 snakes were strangling the passageway. It was honestly so incredible to see in person. A poetic illustration of when nature meets man… and nature wins.\n\nAfter the Temple of Secrets, we headed to the Water Temple. To access the water temple, we had to walk on a very long, narrow wooden walkway, providing passage over a swampy, large waterway. The Water Temple was a quick stop as most of it is not accessible to guests but it was so different than the other temples we had visited that it was a nice way to break up the day.\n\nThe last temple of the day we’ll call the Temple of Ruins, for lack of a better name. It was a sprawling area that could have been the ancient stone family’s graveyard. Ceilings and walls that had caved in long ago lay in piles everywhere. Moss and lichen had began to encroach on the grey bricks still standing. Yet, tremendous arches still stood, and long hallways debuted vertigo-inducing views. Oh, and of course we found more trees growing into (or out of) walls, which we enjoyed.\n\nAfter our last temple of the day, we loaded back in the tuk-tuk and set a course back to the hotel. We were nearing the Angkor Wat temple as we noticed a few motorbikes pulled off to the side of the road. When we looked closer, we saw monkeys hanging out in the field next to the road. Jim pulled over and I eagerly hopped out. Both Jim and Aaron said they were a little afraid of them, but I decided I wanted to get a little closer and take a few photos.\n\nThese guys were very cute and fixated on eating. There was a group of guys on the side of the road who were feeding and selling seeds to feed the monkeys, but I wasn’t brave enough to partake in that. Instead, I watched them interact from a safe few feet away. There was an alpha male, an adolescent male, a pregnant female, and another female up in a small tree nearby, tending to her two adorable babies.\n\nAnother monkey was fixated on a Coke can in the field. He was sniffing and licking it until he finally realize he could extract a little bit more of the sugar water.\n\nWe watched these guys for a good 10 minutes before loading back up, just as one of the younger monkeys jumped in the arms of one of the seed vendors. The way they were playing and teasing each other, this appeared to be a daily ritual.\n\nIn the afternoon sun, as we came upon the crowded intersection outside of the Angkor Wat entrance, and we were both discussing how this would be far better lighting for photos than the backlit morning the day before. We asked if Jim wouldn’t mind if we ran in to take a photo and he obliged. We zipped from the tuk-tuk not wanting him to have to wait too long for us, we zoomed passed the crowds at the entrance and into the courtyard area.\n\nWow… proper lighting did this place justice. Now we could see the immaculate detail work from afar. The temple almost looked unreal.\n\nWe snapped a few photos next to a small pond just outside the gallery entrance, soaked in one last mental image, and then we bolted back in the sweltering heat to meet up with our vehicle.\n\nAfter two great days of sightseeing and a really genuine conversations with Jim, we decided to do something nice for him and tip him $20. When the hotel owner greeted us as we arrived, I told Aaron to do it stealthily, just so the owner didn’t see and either try to take a cut or dock any pay. Hopefully he wouldn’t have done such a thing, but you never know. Aaron said Jim refused to take the money and Aaron had to aggressively insist that he take it… as a “wedding present.” Jim was so thankful, and without meaning to, we secured ourselves top-notch service from him for the last 18 hours of our stay.\n\nWe rested up a bit in the cool air before starting our New Year’s Eve night early… around 6:00pm… always a mistake on NYE when you should start later than normal if you plan to stay out later. We had read good reviews about a BBQ place that grilled up some good beef. Unfortunately, the reviews were not totally accurate. The steak was incredibly tough and the side of fries had previously been frozen. But what are you gonna do about that?\n\nAfter dinner we walked the streets awhile until we found a place called The World Bar that was serving $0.50 draft beers. We parked ourselves, ordered some drinks, and did a little end-of-year reminiscing about the incredibly fortunate, adventurous, and most fun year ever.\n\nA few beers later, we paid our bill (a whopping $2) and headed down the street. Next up on the agenda for the evening was to graze the night market. Now, the night market in Siem Reap was about 1/10th the size of any of the night markets in Chiang Mai, but it did have a nice mix of both tourist tchotchkes and more crafty goods.\n\nWe walked around the brightly lit stalls, merchants left and right showing us prized possessions to buy. Slightly buzzed Aaron was a hoot to shop with that evening. His bargaining skills were (he’s going to hate that I’m about to say this) on-fleek, and we scored a couple fun things. We rewarded ourselves with a banana chocolate pancake (crepe), getting charged double what a local was charged. This happened to us quite a bit in Asia and I had to learn to stop getting irritated by it.\n\nWe ended up back at The World Bar and had a few more beers until around 11pm when we flagged down a tuk-tuk and headed back to the hotel. It’s safe to say that we shared our New Years kiss from bed while watching a movie and saw the fireworks from our balcony. A happy New Year, indeed.\n\nDay 4 – We’re on a boat\n\nThe alarm went off really early the next day. I think before 6am. We rolled ourselves out of bed, grabbed our pre-packed bags and headed downstairs to check-out. The lobby was dark and a young woman was sleeping soundly on the couch. It took awhile to shake her awake and when she was awake, her English was very limited. As she totalled up our bill, we told her we wanted to pay with card. As soon as we said that, she got on the phone, undoubtedly calling someone who knew how to run the card. We were kind of annoyed that the girl working the front desk couldn’t actually run a card, but tried to play it cool… it was early.\n\nAbout five minutes later who should tear into the lobby on his tuk-tuk but Jim. He came in and ran our card while we waited. He nodded to the girl we had woken up, saying “this is my fiance.” Then we got it. There’s “big” business in sunrise trips to Siem Reap so he seemingly left his fiancee to cover for him on certain early mornings while he drove people up and down from the temple. This man just had an insatiable work ethic.\n\nHe offered us food and water, which we declined, before our van came to pick us up (about half an hour late), then he loaded us into the van and we waved goodbye. Next stop, the speed boat we’d take down the canal from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh. Only, the speed boat wasn’t our next stop. After piling into one van, we were dropped off on a street corner about 10 minutes later. 15 minutes after that another, similar-sized van showed up, motioning for the 10 passengers to get in. The problem was this van was already full of people. We squished in, I was basically sitting on Aaron’s lap, and we trundled uncomfortably down the road until we arrived at a dock.\n\nWe all happily piled out of the van and were immediately ambushed by women selling bread, cookies, and drinks. These woman followed us from the parking lot, through a tiny terminal, through the ticketed gate, and onto our boat. We finally decided to purchase some bread and cheese from them and as soon as we expressed interest, they hiked the price.\n\nThe boat itself was very different that I imagined. Think of a yellow school bus but in the water. It was long, narrow, with plastic seats, and no luxury. But shortly after we left the dock (an hour and a half later than we were scheduled to leave), we realized the bonus of this vessel was to climb outside of the boat and hang out on the top of it, viewing the beautiful farmland all around.\n\nWe spent over half of the six hour ride napping, chatting, and just looking out from the roof. It ended up being a pretty nice ride and we got to see a lot of Cambodian countryside, including a floating village and school, hut housing along the canal, and rolling farmland.\n\nWhen we docked in Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital city, we ignored the hoards of men offering their taxi services to us and instead opted to flag down our own tuk-tuk a block away to avoid overpaying. Similar to the tuk-tuk drivers in Siem Reap, we were shocked at the driver’s lack of knowledge of the city. He didn’t know the name of our hotel and when he was looking at his own map for me to point out where we were going, he was reading it upside down. We essentially had to direct him to where we wanted to go.\n\nWe arrived our hotel – the Emerald Rose – and were so delighted to find that it was a really nice hotel. The deal I had booked through TripAdvisor had given us over half-off the usual stay price, and the place had a taste of luxury with a large, comfortable bed, clean bathroom with a proper shower stall, and central AC. Ah! As we were only there for one night, we had to soak it in.\n\nAfter showers, I made a game plan for how to spend the remaining afternoon we had in Cambodia. Initially I found a place for us to grab a late lunch, but upon arrival, the place was closed. Then we saw a popular-looking street food place but when we were handed a menu and looked at the raw meat, we decided to bail ASAP for health concerns. We finally decided we’d have an early dinner at an Indian place I had read was phenomenal. We arrived, ordered a ton of food (as one does at an Indian restaurant) and settled in to our feast. The food was far from good, unfortunately, but we ate like hungry dogs nonetheless.\n\nAfter lunch, we headed to the waterfront across the street to people watch. There was an eclectic mix of Cambodians playing Jianzi, people on evening runs, others on dates. We saw a mean old granny, in the business of collecting bottles, who had enlisted (or enslaved) her two grandsons to collect them for her. If they wouldn’t return to her fast enough or were fooling around too much, she’d scream at them or throw full water bottles at them as punishment. We were the most entranced by the fishing operations going on just below us. There were a couple men fishing with rods from the river bank, another had a net that kept getting tangled up and he had to dive into the murky waters to untangle it. Close by there was also a boat that was net fishing and who had quite the operation. They nearly pulled up a fish or two with every net throw.\n\nHaving this little glimpse into the local culture was cool, but certainly different from Western culture. I was extremely disturbed by the amount of trash on the streets and on the banks of the river – especially as this was where people were fishing and children were playing. The littering culture in Cambodia (and Vietnam) is hard to swallow. People just throw stuff on the ground – plastic bottles, food scraps, paper – it doesn’t go into the garbage, it goes on the ground for someone else to pick up or to stay. Shocking.\n\nAfter sitting and watching the world go by, we then walked along the banks for a while, popping into the occasional temple until we came upon the Royal Palace area. As it was dark, the palace was now closed but there was a large gathering in the park out in front of the palace and we hung out there for a bit. The area was really beautiful, backlit by a burgundy sunset.\n\nThen Aaron got pooped on by a bird. Funny.\n\nWe ended the evening walking through another park – watching skateboarders, kids playing soccer barefoot, and families picnicking in the warm evening air. New Year’s Day… everyone was out, active, and happy. It was really awesome to be a part of.\n\nFor the record, we both wished we could have spent longer in Phnom Penh, and really Cambodia. I think we both had preconceived notions of a poor, maybe dirty, and challenging country to visit. It was far from that. We found people incredibly welcoming, really lovely sights, and a strong, vibrant culture to experience.\n\nDay 5 – To Vietnam!\n\nThe next morning was another early one. We awoke, finished packing, and checked out of our hotel, only to have our van be 45 minutes late picking us up to take us to the bus station. But it eventually arrived and we rode it like 5 minutes before exiting. We reloaded on a big bus bound for Ho Chi Minh City and settled in for another 6 hour trek.\n\nAaron and I were at least seated together this time and could therefore nap on each other. We were in and out of sleep until we arrived at the Vietnam border. Unlike when we entered Cambodia via the bus from Thailand, I had read that this bus service will collect everyone’s passport and prep the visas for everyone as a big group free-of-charge, making the whole border crossing easier to navigate. I’m happy I had read to expect this – in fact, you pay a little more for the bus tickets because it’s a nicer service and they’ll take care of the border crossing details for you. Other people had apparently not read about this and refused to hand over their passports. They, in turn, had to navigate the whole experience on their own.\n\nBut for us it was a breeze. We exited the bus to retrieve our Cambodia exit stamps, then hopped back on the bus to drive a few hundred feet. Then, we jumped back off, grabbed all our luggage, and sat in customs until our names were called and we retrieved our passports, now stamped to enter Vietnam. Then we put our bags through an x-ray scanner and exited.\n\nJust like that, we were in Vietnam… the last country of our six-month adventure. And we officially had three weeks left before our flights back to the States. Wow!\n\nNext Up: We share a table and pho with Bill Clinton(‘s picture), our minds are blown by Vietnamese coffee (blown!!!), and we find ourselves crawling through a tiny, dark tunnel from the Vietnam war (and I don’t hyperventilate from claustrophobia!).\n\nAfter quaint, quiet Pai, then an overnight train with a snoring neighbor and lack of sleep, arriving in Bangkok felt like an overwhelming culture shock. The ride from the train station to our local subway stop was fine (like riding any city’s subway), then wandering around trying to find our Airbnb with poor directions from our host was also fine (albeit exhausting and sweaty), but it wasn’t until we had cleaned up, gotten our directions to the Vietnam embassy, and took the subway into downtown Bangkok that I started feeling overstimulated and fatigued.\n\nWe hadn’t been in a “big city” since Seoul, about seven weeks prior. Even though Chiang Mai is Thailand’s second largest city, after Bangkok, it’s quite small. There are no major infrastructure builds, no skyscrapers, no hoards of people. But Bangkok, Bangkok was certainly an international, dense, major city. I could tell that as soon as we exited at the Phrom Phong subway stop and walked our way up the hazy, loud, populated main artery road. Cars and motorbikes stood stagnant in the street, trying to cut through little holes in traffic to make it another three feet down the road. Hawkers had their goods set up on the sidewalk, eating into valuable walking space and crowding the masses. Tourists and locals bustled toward us and around us. Young Thai women in short, tight dresses and sky-high heels tried to coax white men through padded doors outlined in LED lights. My throat started to burn a bit with the exhaust and I finally began to envy the motorists who wore their colorful face masks as more than just a fashion statement. I was feeling agitated as we dodged barriers on our way toward the Vietnam embassy.\n\nDay 1 – Christmas Eve in Bangkok\n\nWe knew from the beginning of planning the SE Asia portion of the trip that we wanted Bangkok to be on the itinerary, but it became a necessity when we did a little more research on travel to Vietnam. As Americans, we need visas to visit Vietnam and the embassy is seated in the heart of Bangkok, Thailand. Not knowing exactly how long it would take to get the visas, we decided we’d better fill out our paperwork and submit it on our first day in Bangkok.\n\nBefore arriving at the embassy, we popped into a passport photo shop and had our visa photos taken, which ended up being a breeze. They were taken, photoshopped (!), printed, and cut for us in about 10 minutes while we sipped on Thai iced teas that were also for sale in the photo shop.\n\nPictures in hand, we headed to find the Vietnam embassy. After some incorrect directions from a local (thanks, man!), and corrections via Google Maps GPS, we found the nondescript door and entered through two more doors before we were in a tiny whitewashed room with fluorescent lights. We found visa forms (they were scattered all over the room), filled them out, and headed to the window. The gentleman behind the window wasn’t exactly what you’d call a peach. He gave us a scolding look when we hadn’t attached our passport photos to the paper forms yet (yes, because I always carry glue sticks in my purse) then said the visas would be ready in a week. A WEEK?! Mmm that wasn’t going to work. This was supposed to be a four-day turnaround, but I guess we didn’t account that weekends don’t count as ‘days’. We ended up having to pay to rush them but even then, we’d only be getting them after four days later.\n\nWe shoveled over a hefty amount of money for the visas with a lack of information about what time of day we could even pick them us, I was so pissed. I huffed for a few blocks after leaving the embassy before Aaron suggested we get some food into us.\n\nWe walked a few more blocks until we arrived at CentralWorld – a massive, fancy mall in the area – and went inside to see if they had a food court. They did not, but had other offerings including a chain ramen place we had eaten at in Japan a couple of times. Even though it was sweltering outside, some good ol’ fashioned comfort food was much needed that day. We sat at our air conditioned table, munched on our over-priced lunch, and nourished our way back to sanity.\n\nIt was December 24, Christmas Eve. We spent the afternoon walking through the department store and looking at the extravagant Christmas decorations. Though Christmas isn’t a “day-off-of-work, whole-city-shuts-down” kind of a holiday for Thais, they certainly decorated for the season. Poinsettia-lined hallways, sparkly Christmas trees, and the big thing was lights. So many sparkling Christmas lights, everywhere.\n\nI had read about a Christmas lights walking tour in Bangkok around the CentralWorld neighborhood, so we needed to kill some time in the late afternoon before dark. We spotted a big park on the map and decided to hang out there for awhile.\n\nEn route to Lumphini Park, we were walking down some side streets to avoid the loud traffic. On one side of us was a tall fence protecting a construction site. The other side was a little overflow canal full of murky, greenish water and garbage. Out of nowhere, I was something move in the water. It looked like a slithering motion. I stopped dead and tried to register what I was seeing. A snake? A tiny crocodile? A lizard? Ding, ding, ding! A Komodo Dragon… well, in Bangkok I think they’re referred to as Monitor Lizards. But it was huge!\n\nWe stopped and stared in awe. Even some of the locals came over to see what we were gaping at, and pointed in glee. The water creature slithered under a little bridge then pulled itself out of the water, introducing its true size before squeezing its body in a crack between the cement and the bridge… undoubtedly, its home. We were totally thrown off by this sighting and honestly, totally elated.\n\nWe chatted all about it the rest of the way to the park. Once there, we came upon a group of sweaty guys playing a popular SE Asia game, sepak takraw. Sepak Takraw, or kick volleyball, features teams on either side of a short net trying to get a rattan ball over the net to their opponents using their feet, knees, chest or head. Like volleyball, a team can touch the ball three times on each side of the net. Spikes are the most fun to watch and usually have playings doing roundhouse kicks and falling on their backs to get the ball back over the net.\n\nPeople of all ages were playing in the park and it was quite entertaining to watch as we befriended local park cats. We walked around the park a bit more after that, enjoying some of the large ponds in the area and taking in the Bangkok skyline before darkness began to fall.\n\nAs we did a victory lap through the park, checking out some of the community exercise groups getting their move on, we also noticed a few other things emerging from one of the ponds. More Monitor Lizards! We saw three more of them in the dim light and it was only until we were whistled at by one of the park security guards that we decided to back away from the lizards and be on our way.\n\nThe walk back up toward CentralWorld was ablaze with Christmas lights. Each hotel along the main drag was trying to outdo the others with large, fake tree displays, perfectly outlined palm trees, or just blanket lighting schemes. It was a colorful jaunt. At one point, we decided to climb the stairs and stroll with the crowds along the elevated walkway and get a better view of the excitement below. The elevated walkway was lined in its own neon rainbow lights and people were abuzz.\n\nWhen we finally made our way to CentralWorld, things were crazy. There was a massive lights display below us with a tall, twinkling tree that was surrounded by hundreds of pink flowers lit up at the tree’s base. There were holiday and winter characters set up for people to take pictures with and the whole scene was crawling with people – locals and travelers alike. We pushed our way through, ogling at the displays until we grabbed a seat on the outskirts to soak it all in.\n\nIt was both of our first Christmases away from family and friends. It was weird in that moment to feel surrounded by people and joy and light, but still feel alone and far away. I shed my traditional Christmas tears before Aaron grabbed my hand and pulled me toward one of the many beer gardens on the event space. Each garden had a major set up with an individual stage, a local beer sponsor, a band, and a sitting area packed with people. We chose one of the two Chang beer venues, found two empty spots at their bar, and threw back a few Christmas beers, having a great time. As hard as it was to be away from all the people we loved, we had each other and we knew we’d look back on this year fondly and remember “that one Christmas we spent in Bangkok.” Awesome.\n\nAfter our beers, we fought our way back into one of the malls and treated ourselves to a Christmas dinner at Din Tai Fung.\n\nDay 2 – Christmas Day Exploration\n\nWe enjoyed a lazy Christmas morning. I FaceTimed with my family for an hour or so while they prepped for their own Christmas Eve dinner, Aaron made me semi-ghetto-style French toast with hilarious gas station white bread and amazing homemade passion fruit jam (from our Airbnb host), and I trimmed Aaron’s wild beard. A Christmas morning for the books.\n\nIn the late morning, we emerged from our laziness and went trekking to find Bangkok’s massive Chinatown. The outskirts of Chinatown were rough. Dingy walls, dilapidated buildings, what few homeless people I ever saw in SE Asia were on the streets here, often missing one or more limbs. As we came across more and more street vendors selling talisman and undoubtedly stolen watches for cheap, I knew we must be getting closer to the main market area in the neighborhood.\n\nSure enough, another block or so up, we turned off the main street and began walking down a side street lined with colorful umbrellas shielding unnamable fruit, stinky squid, and random packaged goods. The road narrowed into the real, “undercover” market and we ducked inside. Within this protected road was a series of tiny pathways and bright storefronts everywhere we looked. The way it felt can only be described as an ant farm with random routes entwined with tiny stores, and just jam-packed with bustling people. The stores were all selling knock-off Disney items, cheap, plastic jewelry, and other … stuff. Stuff is just the best way to describe it. We inched our way along the packed corridors, dodging woman carrying large plastic bags full or recently purchased goods until I saw a light at the end of the road and flocked to it like me to a chocolate fountain. Back out on a road and in daylight, I breathed a sigh of relief at a stuffy 15 minute venture. This place was known for its cheap deals… but maybe the cheapness of it all was just the problem.\n\nInstead of doing any kind of bargain hunting, we decided to try and find some lunch, looking back at our short foray in Chinatown as a funny experience. But we found it hard to actually get out of Chinatown. Block after block we walked, and the storefronts turned from selling goods to selling auto and machine parts. Further we walked, getting a lot of stares as the only white people in the vicinity.\n\nAfter walking another hour, we were finally out of Chinatown and closer to the Grand Palace. We figured around there we could find some food and after a few more blocks, we finally found a road that looked like it had some restaurants… then it just came down to picking a good one.\n\nNo sooner had we turned onto the street, we heard a screech of tires and looked up just in time to see a motorist thrown from his motorbike. Another motorbike with a large transport attachment on the back looked as though it had totally cut the first biker off when taking a right turn, causing the guy to swerve and fall off his bike. The man only laid on the ground for a second in the street as we watched in horror. He then picked himself up, shaking his no-doubt scratched up hands, grabbed his bike, and said a few grumbly words to the other biker who had finally decided to get off his bike and see if the man he cut off was alright. He exchanged some words and some rapid pointing until they both got back on their bikes and rode off. All the while, traffic was just zooming by the accident, the only people who seemed to stop what they were doing were people on the sidewalk watching the scene unfold. It was just a different experience than anything in the U.S. It was hard to believe what we were seeing.\n\nWe ducked into a cafe not long after, deciding we needed hydration and AC ASAP. Our goal was to have an early dinner at a really famous pad thai place in town that opened at 5pm, so we only really had an hour and a half to kill until then. We ordered Thai iced teas and a fried rice to tide us over, which ended up being surprisingly tasty for the cafe’s appearances. We then headed back out into the heat and stopped by the Giant Swing in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Giant Swing was constructed in 1784 in front of the Devasathan shrine by King Rama I and was used in spiritual ceremonies. During the reign of King Rama II, the swing became structurally damaged by lightning, thus rendering it unsafe for further spiritual ceremonies. In 1920, it was renovated and moved to its current location in front of Wat Suthat where ceremonies were again performed up until 1935, when its use was again discontinued after several fatal accidents. The swing itself has since been removed, but the original pillars (in the shape of a torii) remain today.\n\nAfter walking around a bit more, checking out some Buddha manufacturers, and popping our heads into a few other temples, it was finally time to eat again. We had read that Thip Samai was the place to eat some bangin’ pad thai and when we arrived ten minutes after opening and just barely got a seat, we could see other people had read similar things.\n\nIn retrospect, I actually don’t think we ordered the right thing. I wanted plain egg pad thai but we ended up getting some with seafood by mistake, which I think ended up detracting from the overall flavor. The noodle dish arrived in a cocoon of scrambled eggs and we dug in. It was good, sweet, but the flavor tasted just a little off to me (hence, maybe the seafood). We also ordered giant, fresh mandarin juices, which were out of this world (but pricey). It was a fun experience sitting in the open-air dining room, knees pressed up against the underside of the short tables, and back grazing the people behind us. We left our Christmas dinner overly stuffed… it just felt right.\n\nThere were no subway stops near where we were so we relied on some knowledge Aaron had read online that Bangkok uses water taxis to move people around via canals in the city. He had an idea of where we might find one nearby, post dinner, and sure enough, when we arrived at the little concrete path to the canal, a big, long boat sat waiting. We jumped aboard hoping for the best and as soon as it had filled up a bit more, the captain started up the loud engine and we were off.\n\nThe captain’s first move? Getting this long boat turned around in a tiny space on the water. It was nearly an Austin Powers golf cart situation, but this guy knew what he was doing, whipping the boat around like it was nothing more than a jet ski. Once pointed in the right direction, we were off. And we were really going!\n\nZooming all around the narrow canals, we saw old, worn houses lining the waterfront, other boats narrowly missing us, and the boat’s wake slamming up against the sides of the concrete canal walls. It was honestly wild because the captain was so aggressive and we couldn’t help but laugh our way through the entire thing. Aaron gleefully took videos while the captain basically drifted around corners, ducked under bridges, and jammed the boat up against the side of the canal every so often for passengers to get on and off. But you’d better be quick exiting and entering the boat because the captain was not messing around with his timeline. The second the last foot exited the dock, he was on the gas, zooming off the the next stop.\n\nAlso, it was very cheap to take the canal boat. I think 9 baht a person, which is pennies USD. When we finally arrived at our stop, we were quick to disembark through the crowd of people before the captain was on the throttle again. Not a bad way to cap off an adventurous Xmas day.\n\nDay 3 – Attempting Temples\n\nThe next day we decided it was time to temple. We woke up at a decent time, we packed our day bag, planned our route and headed south. The morning commute included our 10 minute walk to the subway, a 30 minute subway ride, a 20 minute skytrain ride, followed up a 20 minute boat ride out toward the Grand Palace. It was quite the venture but was a beautiful journey nonetheless. The boat trip along Chao Phraya River was especially nice. It was a blue sky day and tall buildings and temples cropped up along the banks as boats of all shapes and sizes zig-zagged through the choppy water all around us.\n\nOur first temple of the day was Wat Arun – the Temple of the Dawn. We docked just across the water from the temple and before taking the 3 baht water taxi across the river to get to it, we decided we’d better find some nutrients first. We popped out of the undercover docking area to a walkway where there were a few food stands. We skipped the overpriced fruit and snack vendors, and opted for a little pop-up eating area. Taking our stooled seats, we ordered a late breakfast and sat in anticipation. The food was cooked in a giant wok on a glorified camp stove a few feet away. When it arrived, it was shockingly flavorful and fresh. Ah, I do love that about so much of the street food experience in SE Asia. It looks sketchy as hell and you weigh the odds of cleanliness before sitting or passing. But then the joy it is to order and be delivered a fantastic, cheap meal… yes, yes, yes!\n\nAfter breakfast, we cattle-style lined up to get on our water taxi and made the two minute boat ride across the busy river. Once there, we purchased our “foreigner” tickets – another thing that irks me to no end (basically if you’re not Asian, you have to pay a fee places certain places), I donned my always-fashionable scarf skirt, and we headed in to see the temple area. First up was a visit to the magnificent prang.\n\nThe temple itself derives its name from the Hindu god of Aruna, often personified as the rays of the rising sun. The main feature is the central prang (a tall tower) that is encrusted with porcelain. The tower is somewhere between 220 – 280 feet tall and is surrounded by four smaller prangs, decorated by seashells and porcelain, previously used as ballasts on boats coming to Bangkok from China.\n\nThe towers were spectacular. The intricate detail of each lain bowl or piece of porcelain into the wall, careful to keep the color and tone of the structure consistent, was perfection. From afar the prang was pearly white in the sun, up close it was multicolored, with rock carvings and designs adding to the allure of the art. And that’s what it was, a monumental piece of art. We walked up and down the steep steps to inspect the towers closer, dodging the blazing sun by keeping in the shadows.\n\nWhen we were pulled out of our porcelain trance, we headed into the temple building next door. This temple was embellished with gold everywhere you looked and almost appeared to have wall paper running up and down its exterior walls and pillars. It was gorgeous. Inside the temple was also amazing. Aside from the always-stunning Buddhist shrine at the end of the hall and the quiet monk blessing guests, the walls on the inside of the temple had brightly colored, intricate murals painted on them. The whole experience at this temple was great. It was very well taken care of, evidenced by the retouching of paint and sculpture work we stumbled onto at the back of the building. We left impressed (and crazy sweaty).\n\nOur next stop was Wat Pho, back across the water. But upon arrival, we realized it was a heftier entry fee than we had anticipated, so we opted to skip it and head directly to the Grand Palace. We accidentally took the long walk around the exterior of the palace so that when we finally entered the gates, we were overheated. I had my bag checked and tagged, was scolded for not putting my scarf on soon enough, and we continued deeper into the crowded grounds.\n\nNow, don’t worry. I’m not building up to give you another history lesson because before we could go any further, we saw the entry sign…. and the price for admission. I think it was around 500 baht for a ticket. We did not have that kind of money on us. We pulled over in the shade while I grumbled about the cost. But there was nothing we could do. Instead of dropping $30 on tickets, we instead attempted to catch a city bus (but failed), and walked all the way over to our favorite canal boats to hitch a ride home.\n\nWe rested that afternoon, snacking on pork buns and chilling in the air conditioning. We re-emerged after dark, hungry. We set out to find a restaurant our Airbnb hosts had recommended in our immediate neighborhood but after walking around for quite away, accepted defeat and opted to choose the next restaurant full of people we could find. We opted for an open-air joint full of locals. We sat down, fully anticipating a non-English menu, and we were correct. But, one of the guys working there politely asked if we spoke Thai and when we told him no, helped us navigate the menu as best he could. It was so nice!\n\nWe ended up ordering a bunch of food and Thai-style beer… AKA light beer served with a glass and a big ol’ bucket of ice. It’s a surprisingly awesome way to drink beer when it’s hot. The food was great and spicy and salty. The cold beer was incredibly necessary for our sad little American taste-buds. Basically, we tried not to embarrass ourselves sweating and panting among the locals all through dinner.\n\nDay 4 – A Taste of Local Culture\n\nWe had a lazy next morning and departed our Airbnb after noon to make the 40 minute trek to the Chatuchak weekend market. It’s the largest market in Thailand with more than 8,000 stalls separated into 27 different sections. The market has nine kinds of goods – plants, antiques, pets, food & drink, fresh & dry food, ceramics, furniture & home decor, clothes, and books (and really everything in between).\n\nWe took some back roads to get there, showing us a few quiet, more residential neighborhoods in Bangkok, before we arrived at the incredibly unassuming entrance to Chatuchak. Literally, it’s just a doorway in the midst of a fenced-off area. The only reason we recognized it as the entrance, despite the few people we saw ducking in, were that there were a few hawkers just out front and a few tuk-tuks strategically posted up.\n\nWe entered and were immediately shocked at the size and scale. There was a central undercover area, a maze of little shops setting all kinds of goods. We wove our way through there for a while, occasionally stopping to enjoy a shop’s AC or fan, before we made our way to the outdoor area. Outside there was basically a main road with little, undercover, makeshift stores lining the way. People were selling shirts, herbal remedies, leather goods, souvenirs, woven baskets, ceramic bowls, artwork, musical instruments, tea sets, seeds, hats… it felt like you could buy ANYTHING. And unlike any of the other markets we had been to, there were things of all levels of quality and individuality. Plus, the crowd was a mix of locals and tourists, something that other markets can lack. It was really cool. We wandered through stalls for hours and walked away with a few treasures of our own.\n\nAfter a late afternoon swim in our Airbnb building’s pool, we hit the streets once again just as it was getting dark. We had read about a street that was full of clubs and bars that was great for people watching, and decided to head in that direction. It was kind of in the middle of nowhere, so when we got off the subway, we still had a ways to walk. Just before we got to the street, we had to cross (no joke) a highway on foot that didn’t have a crosswalk/stoplight/anything. After 5 minutes of skittering across 8 lanes of traffic (thank god for a median!), we were on the other side of the highway and right in front of us was a park area full of repurposed shipping containers all strung up in lights.\n\nWe decided we could make a detour to check out what this was all about, and headed in. Beyond the rows of shipping containers that were full of boutique shops and food and drink, we found a clearing with a few food trucks, a stage with a band performing, and a giant Christmas tree-looking structure made out of a water tower. We parked ourselves on one of the picnic tables set up, grabbed two beers and some fried chicken and enjoyed the music. After the chicken was done, it became a competition about who could bring back the best food truck food.\n\nAaron settled on some BBQ sliders (random!) while I opted for a more traditional papaya salad. They were both great. Next up was more drinks. Aaron went for two beers and came back with… a bucket?! A booze bucket. We shared it, sipping the not-too-sweet concoction and chatting. We had stumbled upon a Christmas Fest that went from December 25-27 and we had come across it on the last night. We had a blast!\n\nAfter a while, we decided we’d better continue on our mission to find the street full of bars and we headed out. We found the street, we saw the clubs and bars, but for the most part on this Sunday night, the place was deserted! Now we were extra happy we had come upon Christmas Fest. We made our way back to the grounds after our failed bar scene venture, snagged two seats under the shadow of the Christmas tree, and split another bucket of booze.\n\nAwhile later we decided it was time to head home. Thinking we should try a different route back to the subway, we headed out on what turned out to be a little adventure in itself. Mostly it had us walking next to the freeway, down a dark dead-ended street, under a freeway ramp, across a random field, then down some dark roads before we recognized where we were again. The good news? No dogs attacked us en route.\n\nDay 5 – Prep for Cambodia\n\nOn our final day in Bangkok, we knew we needed to pick up our visas and prep for our trip across the Cambodian border the next day. We spent the morning planning the next leg of our trip, researching the border crossing, and making sure we had all of our ducks in a row to leave Thailand.\n\nIn the afternoon, we headed toward the Vietnam embassy early, making sure we had plenty of time in the area to pick up our passports, as there is only an hour-long window everyday where you can actually pick them up and we DID NOT want to miss it, seeing as we already had to extend our stay one extra day.\n\nWe took the subway and then the skytrain and arrived with plenty of time to kill. We decided to hang out at MBK Center for a while because we heard it was an electronics-lover’s paradise. Turns out it’s just multiple floors full of kiosks hawking used and likely stolen electronics along with cheap charging cords and accessories. Skippable, but an OK way to void some time. We were also in search of a place where we could exchange some Thai baht into USD to purchase our Cambodian visas and after being turned away from like 3 different exchange places, we finally found a kick-ass woman who understood exactly what we needed to do and made the process a breeze for us.\n\nUSD pocketed, we walked around town a bit more, stopping for some Thai iced tea at what was supposed to be the king of Thai iced teas (it was just alright) before we finally made our way to the embassy. Upon arrival, our passports were fished out of a basket full of other random passports (how secure!), each with a page filled with a Vietnamese visa. Even though the process wasn’t that big of a deal, I was happy it was done. Part of me was still irked that it took so long to do something so simple.\n\nWe rewarded ourselves with another meal at Din Tai Fung (the shame!) and it’s wondrous views of the city as the sun started to set. We figured it might be the last time we have more of a luxurious dining experience during the trip (and turns out that was basically right).\n\nDay 6 – To Cambodia!\n\nWe woke early on the 30th, finished packing, did a key exchange with our Airbnb hosts, and jumped into the tuk-tuk they had ordered for us at 7am. We needed to catch an 8:30am bus, but unfortunately we needed to be at the bus station an hour early to have them print off our tickets for us. The ride was about 20 minutes from our Airbnb by car, so we already felt like we were cutting things a little close with a 7am pick-up.\n\nWe jumped in the truck with our luggage and two other passengers and took off. When we arrived at the local subway station at the main street, the driver told us to get out. Frack. There must have been a misunderstanding with what our Airbnb host had booked. We had anticipated a ride to the bus station, this driver was going as far as the subway station. Slightly panicked, we jumped out. One of the girls who was riding with us must have been able to tell we were a little concerned because she asked what was up, where we were going then flagged down a taxi for us. I was flustered and a little confused if what she was doing had an angle (read, was this a legit taxi or did she want some money for helping us), but as the taxi driver pulled up, she told him where we were going, basically loaded us in the taxi and closed the door with a wave. She was so nice, I should have never doubted her.\n\nThen we were off. We hit some traffic a few minutes into the trip and the whole time I was just staring at the clock on my phone. In my head I was trying to comfort myself, saying that just because we’re not there an hour early, doesn’t mean they’re not going to issue us our tickets. But my deep hatred and anxiety of tardiness won out throughout the ride. Lucky for us, we arrived by 7:29am and ran inside to get our tickets printed. For the record, I’m pretty sure we would have been just fine arriving 15 minutes early, but … rules!\n\nWe loaded on the bus an hour later and said goodbye to each other, as we were not seated together. The ride from Bangkok across the border and to Siem Reap was about an eight hour trip. The bus was fine, clean, but we were bummed to be sitting apart.\n\nWhen the bus took off from the station, the driver’s first officer (I don’t know how else to describe this guy), came around and started passing out things to passengers. First he came around with water for everyone, then a juice box, then bottled coffee, then a breakfast box full of a tiny cake. I thought it was hilarious.\n\nI sat back, put my headphones in and began listening to This American Life, anticipating a relaxing ride when it happened. It still boils my blood thinking about it.\n\nThe Russian chick in front of me reclined her seat.\n\nAnd I’m not talking a plane recline, I’m talking a good 50+ degree recline. I couldn’t believe it… it was so far back! At one point I even made eye contact with her as she peeked over the seat turning over from one sleeping position to the other, about a foot away from my face. Aaron caught my eye after this offense and was shocked, then kind of laughed, because it was pretty comical if not completely annoying.\n\nWe stopped at a rest stop a few hours into the drive and after she got off, Aaron came back to me and put her seat up a few degrees. I spent the five-minute stop complaining and when we re-entered the bus, she seemed to not have noticed we moved her seat back up. That was until 10 minutes later when she reclined it even farther than the first time. She was literally in my lap. People all around me were looking at this girl like “WTF?!” It was like noon and she was the only one doing it (although her friend next to her was reclined pretty far too). Oh my god, I was so mad. I couldn’t even fit my legs in my own space… one had to lull awkwardly in the walkway.\n\nANYWAY.\n\nAs we rolled closer to the border, it became evident that our research about ‘what to expect when crossing the Cambodian border’ paid off. Just as we had read online, before we arrived at the border, someone from our bus service climbed aboard and basically told everyone they needed to fork over their passports and that the bus service would take care of the exit and entry process for a fee. They made it seem like that was the only option when that was completely untrue and a far more expensive option. Aaron told all who would listen that this was kind of a scam, as people looked around puzzled.\n\nJust like we had read, people bombarded the bus when we got off, telling us they would help us through the “difficult” visa process for just a “small fee.” NOPE!\n\nJust like we had read, after getting our Thailand exit stamps we made our way over to a nondescript building to retrieve our ‘visas on arrival” to Cambodia.\n\nJust like we had read, we paid for the visas in USD but paid the border guard’s ‘bribe’ in baht (yep, you bribe them). The visas were created in less than five minutes for both of us (SO TAKE THAT VIETNAM EMBASSY!!!) then we made our way to get our entry stamp into Cambodia.\n\nWe waited in a 30-minute-long-line for our stamps then returned to the bus. I napped and listened to podcasts cramped for the rest of the trip. And I swear to god if I ever see that girl again, I’m going to recline on her so hard…\n\nNext Up: We finally find $.25 beers, Angkor Wat is all it’s cracked up to be, monkeys drink Coca Cola, and Aaron gets pooped on by a bird. Hee hee.\n\nThe road was bumpy, I refused to look out the front window, and I was squished next to Aaron, our knees gently clanging into the seat in front of us. We were supposedly in the “death van” headed toward the Thailand-Burma border, on our way to Pai.\n\nWhy death van? What’s a death van? Well, the route taking tourists from Chiang Mai the three-hour journey to Pai has become quite popular. The easiest way to do the trip is to pile into 13-person vans that trek through the mountains to the valley the town of Pai is nestled into. The vans have a reputation for their crazy drivers… passing on blind corners, taking the hills at great speeds with no guard rails, weaving through traffic… there are horror stories of these trips all over the internets, but when it’s the easiest and cheapest way to do it, what choice does one have?\n\nSo, we piled into the white van, I buckled my lap belt that didn’t tighten, and just prepared for the insanity of it all. We were out $4 a ticket for this three-hour trip (considering we had just spent $6 on tuk-tuks to our dinner spot then home the night before, this felt like a steal). And you know what? It was totally fine! Although, like I said before, I basically refused to look out the front window, so… who really knows.\n\nAaron and I spent the short trip up to Pai catching up on our favorite podcast, Reply All (I know I’ve plugged it on the blog before, but that’s because it’s so good!). What was at the other end of this trip? Well, I had read that Pai was up in the mountains, with serene landscape, and an ultimate place to just hang out for a few days. It’s a popular place for travelers, especially backpackers, and we had spoke with many Pai-lovers during our time in Chiang Mai. They all described it the same way, a “hippie town.”\n\nAs the bus pulled into the tiny little bus station in town and we hopped out with our backpacks, it soon became evident why Pai has that reputation. It was crawling with white people… in dreads or barefoot or carrying a guitar, or wearing tie dye, or elephant pants, or crystals. All the restaurant and bar signs were in English, advertising vegetarian and vegan dishes, homemade kombucha, fresh juice, and yoga. Literally, it fulfilled every stereotype. And honestly, I was instantly annoyed. Where were my peaceful rolling hillsides, quirky locals, and street food?! Damn you ex-pats!\n\nWe knew where we were headed and made the 20 minute walk with our stuff from the bus station to our Airbnb, which ended up being up a hill, just outside of town. As soon as we were across a little bridge, I was relieved. Space, rice fields, cattle, and quiet came into view.\n\nWhile walking down a side road toward where we were staying, we came upon what looked like a hippie commune, advertising a music festival every night starting from that same evening up through the new year. Originally I thought that might be fun to hang at… but that thought soon came to bite me in the ass.\n\nWe arrived at our Airbnb, down a little side road in the middle of rice fields, there were little bungalows and huts everywhere we looked. We checked in, and navigated through the property to our personal bungalow. It was quaint and earthy. It had a nice wooden porch halfway around the outside with a chair and hammock. Inside the circular building was a large bed with a mosquito net and a bricked in outdoor bathroom off the back. The floor was up on stilts and made of wood, and between some of the boards cracks of light peeked through. We were doing this, nature-style. The porch overlooked a rice field and a cow grazed 50 feet away. Rolling hills with rounded peaks emerged behind the hut… up here it was peaceful and chill, a refuge from the antics back in town.\n\nWe dropped our stuff and decided to head back out to try and find a scooter or motorbike to rent. The first place we stopped offered us a raw deal (we did some research on what to expect price-wise before we headed out), so we continued on until we came upon a tourist-centric rental place with signs offering mopeds for ~$3/day. We jumped at that, rented our bike, put down our hefty deposit (instead of leaving our passports as collateral), and off we went… first stop the gas station. Aaron said after riding a geared bike, riding an automatic was kind of weird. And this bike was idiot proof… it wouldn’t start unless you had both brakes engaged and the kickstand up. But once we figured out all those little quirks with the help of some local boys, we were off!\n\nWe did a little mini-tour of the countryside that day before it got dark, just in our immediate area, and made note of where we wanted to explore further the next day. It was beautiful and unpopulated, but I’ll save more descriptions for later in the post, on our longer rides.\n\nThat evening, we took the bike back down into town, parked it, and decided to explore the little night market that was set up. It was like the night markets in Chiang Mai except 1/100th of the size. We strolled along the street, nabbing a few goodies to snack on before we sought out a bar. We ordered two beers and nibbled on our banana chocolate crepe while planning out what was on the agenda for the next day.\n\nTour de Pai: Part I\n\nThe next morning we woke up under our mosquito net shivering. Unlike in Chiang Mai, the temperature in Pai (given its altitude) drops at night. With an unsealed bungalow and no heat, we cowered under the blanket. Showering outside was also a frigid experience – balancing the fluctuating water temperature with the cool air made for a quick turn around. Once we were cleaned up and appropriately dressed, we hopped on the bike to head into town and find some breakfast. We ended up eating an over-priced, mediocre Western-style breakfast before regrouping about plans for the day on the porch of our bungalow.\n\nWe decided we’d take the bike out in the late morning, explore the countryside a bit more, and hit some of Pai’s highlights. Sitting in the midst of a tall hill opposite of our back porch sat a towering, pure-white seated Buddha. We thought finding the road to that landmark would be a good way to kick-off the day, so off we went.\n\nOne thing I should note is that in Thailand, people drive on the left side of the road (opposite from what we’re used to in the U.S.). So given that we were still green motor bikers plus Aaron had to constantly remember which side of the road to drive on, we made up a song whenever we got on the bike to remind us where to drive. It was simple… basically me singing “Stay on the right side of the road… of the road…” to the tune of “Let it Go” from Frozen. I blame my niece Avery for the Frozen influence.\n\nSong belting, the little bike zoomed around corners, passed vast open fields of green and brown, under a partially shaded roadway. The temperature was perfect on the bike with the wind in our faces. If I closed my eyes, it could be summer in Seattle, such a funny feeling. When we determined we could ride no further up to the Buddha, we parked the bike, looped our helmets around the handle bars, and started trekking up stairs. A lot of stairs.\n\nAt the top of the 200+ stairs, we found a shrine, a bell tower and an lookout spot. We walked around the corner of one of the buildings when the Buddha finally came into view. The catch? It was up another set of at least 100 stairs. Blergh.\n\nAs we climbed higher and higher, the view behind us grew more and more spectacular, overlooking the sleepy farmland below. The platform on which the Buddha was seated was nearly empty. We removed our shoes before stepping up the final step, and saw we were sharing this experience with one other traveler, a monk in orange, the monk’s friend, and handicapped boy sitting in the corner with a donation box.\n\nThe Buddha was massive but up-close not quite as pristine as it looked seated on the hillside from afar. It was white but weathered, a chunk of its headpiece had fallen off and was seated in the corner of the platform, the replacement piece didn’t quite match. But all the same, I have an affinity for the peace the seated Buddhas exude and enjoyed the visit.\n\nWe drank in the lovely view one last time before descending the stairs. Next stop, the bridge in town that was originally built during the Japanese occupation. We headed back down into the valley below, winding past a few elephant camps, luxury hotels, and homestays out in the countryside. We crossed the bridge built beside the Japanese bridge that vehicles use, pulled off to the side of the road that was lined with tourist vendors, and walked toward the wooden and metal structure. The view from the bridge was really nice – it overlooked soft-peaked hills, farmland, and a low-flowing river.\n\nWe watch cars fly by on the motor bridge and noticed that as we drove over the bridge, it was painted a nice white. But as we walked next to the motorist bridge, its sides facing away from drivers, were a mess of dripping dried paint. Someone didn’t think it was worth it to actually paint the whole bridge, just what drivers would see. Funny.\n\nAfter that, we headed to Pai Canyon. We had to take the highway to get there instead of the back roads and were instantly annoyed at all the drivers whizzing by us, passing other cars in a ludicrous fashion, and beeping their horns left and right.\n\nWe arrived and trekked up paved stairs and a ramp on a hillside until we reached kind of an entryway to the canyon. Even from here, less exposed, the view was a brilliant 360 degrees around. In the distance were hunter green velvet hills, below our feet, a brown dusty canyon unrolled itself. There were several paths from the top of the ramp, so we picked the one that looked like it went the furthest out in the canyon and headed off.\n\nFirst, we had to scramble down a few feet of packed dirt. This put us on a jutting pathway with dropoffs on both sides. At the other side of this pathway, we had to scramble back up a good fifty feet, using tree roots and plants to aid in getting us up the loose dirt.\n\nAtop this next peak, the real canyon came into view. Pai refers to this as “Thailand’s Grand Canyon,” and while it’s nothing of that magnitude, it was pretty awesome to experience. We were the only two people trekking along the ridges, every way we turned, farmland or mountainous scenery shifted into view.\n\nWe walked around for a bit until the sun reemerged from behind some clouds and we decided we should take cover. Scrambling the other way was probably a bit more challenging, but we utilized our rock climbing experience to descend and scale. After our little adventure, we headed back to Pai in search of some lunch. Knowing we wanted to avoid the overpriced Western food, we zigzagged back and forth on a few side streets until we found a little mom and pop shop that looked good.\n\nWe ordered pork, rice, and greens dishes and hoped for the best (often times these little joints can be hit or miss). To our utter delight, everything was fresh and flavorful… not to mention much less expensive than other fair in town. Following lunch, we returned to our stoop and relaxed in front of a beautiful pink sunset tucked behind the hills. Not soon after dark the hippie convent started up their music for the evening (they did this all three nights we stayed there). People were belting off-key renditions of Bob Marley and songs people “had written themselves.” The music went until after 1am each night. So much for my quiet evenings.\n\nWe dined on bad khao soi that evening and then walked through the night market again. One of our super mean but also very entertaining games we played while in Pai was ‘spot the worst motorbike injury.’ What do you get when you mix Westerners with little-to-no moped experience, cheap transportation, a busy city center, and rough roads? A lot of road rash, bandages, and the occasional sling or crutches. That evening, we mostly spotted leg bandages.\n\nTour de Pai: Part II\n\nI awoke early the next morning and instead of sitting in bed while Aaron slept, I stole away with a blanket and my computer and parked myself on the chair on the porch. There was a thick fog lying lazily over the fields in front of our bungalow. It was quiet, and introspective, and I quite enjoyed the bite in the fresh air. Aaron joined me an hour or so later and we packed up for the hike to a waterfall we had planned for that morning.\n\nWe drove in the opposite direction of town, down an old dirt road. When we reached the start of the hike, that’s when Aaron told me the hike would include switchbacks over the river. And from the looks of the start of the hike, there wouldn’t be a way to do it without getting wet. Grouchy, I did all matter of complaining until Aaron suggested that we just bag it and do something else.\n\nInstead of getting exercise, we opted to eat breakfast at a resort instead. From there, we decided to take a ride further afield and see more of the countryside. This turned out to be a great decision. The scenery up into the hills and through the valleys outside of Pai was stunning. Earthy, raw, light, and gritty. We passed tons of farms, livestock, modest homes, banana tree groves, and crisscrossed over the river, stopping to capture photos along the way.\n\nAt one point, we saw what we thought was signage to another waterfall, and followed the rough road up into the hills. For awhile, we thought we were completely off the beaten track. But as we came around few more blind corners on the narrow road, a few homestays came into view. Out of nowhere, a fifty-something year old woman came running toward us making the ‘smoking cigarette’ gesture and yelling “you smoke marijuana?”\n\nWe got a huge kick out of this, but knowing Thailand’s harsh drug policies, we obviously declined. When we finally came to the end of the road, we pulled our bike up next to about 25 others and made our way on foot down some muddy steps toward the river. There, we found our collection of waterfalls and a ton of people enjoying them. We scrambled up a boulder to get a better view and watch all the tourists in the chilly river use the worn rocks on one of the waterfalls as a slide that shot them into the deep pool below.\n\nAfter that, we headed back out on one of the main roads and followed signs to a viewpoint, which ended up being a giant field backed up to a little cliff that had a nice view of the mountains. We decided to skip paying the entry-fee (on principal), and instead scooted out in the middle of the field to relax for a bit. The field was fairly flat, made up of dried grass and dirt. As we took some pictures, including me pretending to man the helm of the bike, Aaron suggested this might be a good place to for me to practice captaining the moped. I was a little hesitant at first, but after some careful instruction from Aaron, I took ahold of the handlebars, swung my leg over, and gently hit the throttle of the surprisingly heavy vehicle.\n\nZoom, zoom, zoom! I was off. First I tried a straight line, then had Aaron turn the bike around for me, and off I went in the other direction. Then I tried riding the perimeter of the field. The throttle was a little tricky at first, but I started to get the hang of it. Everything was going great until I tried to make too tight of a turn at too slow of a speed and felt the bike tip.\n\nNow, the last time I rode a bike was over a year ago. It was the first time I was trying out a road bike (vs. a mountain bike) and I was trying clip-in shoes at Aaron’s insistence. I got all siked up for the ride, I clipped in, I rolled maybe six inches, then immediately fell over, shoes firmly attached to the pedals. As you can imagine, this scene ended in tears and me yelling at Aaron… then storming off, refusing to “get back on the horse,” with a bruised leg and ego.\n\nSo, when I felt the moped start to tip in the field in Pai, I had an immediate flashback to that bike moment. But in a split-second, I realized my feet needn’t stay in place. I basically bolted from the bike as it fell to the ground, unscathed. I was totally fine, in fact, I thought it was kind of funny. Aaron was immediately concerned and came sprinting toward me, helping me get the bike back up.\n\nHe asked if I wanted to take another ride so this wasn’t my last impression of the experience, but I decided against that, not wanting to be those people we were laughing at bandaged up the night before.\n\nFrom there, we finished our scenic drive and headed back to our lunch joint, from the day before, for some grub.\n\nWe reemerged that evening and found ourselves at Na’s, a Thai restaurant in town that’s very popular, and rightfully so. We ended up ordering a bunch of dishes (including the best pad see ew ever, Britta!), enjoyed the flavorful food, and soaked in our last night in northern Thailand.\n\nTravel Day(s)\n\nThe next morning, we awoke, packed, checked out of our Airbnb and snagged some tea and scones at a bakery in town. After breakfast, we returned our bike and loaded into our van to make the trek back to Chiang Mai.\n\nThe ride was pretty uneventful. Again, we mostly listened to podcasts as the van chugged up the steep curves, and flew down the other side of each hill. We were delivered to the bus station with about three hours of dead time until our train. With that, we found an air conditioned cafe and read our books for a few hours. Before we made it to the train station, we stopped in at a little cafe across the street. Not expecting much from the food, I ordered the dish I always order when I think the food will be mediocre, pad thai. I’ll be damned if that wasn’t the best pad thai I had during our entire stay in Thailand. It was sweet, sour, and saucy, topped with a plethora of bean sprouts. Heaven.\n\nA half hour before our train was scheduled to leave, we gathered up our bags and walked across the street to the station. We then entered what would be home for the next 14 hours… our sleeper train.\n\nI was a little unsure of the experience, but all in all, it was totally fine. In fact, the Thai sleeper trains are much, much nicer than the ones in Vietnam. Aaron and I had a bottom and top soft bunk booked, so we were able to hang out together on the bottom bunk together until we decided to go to sleep.\n\nAcross from us (sharing the 4-person alcove) was a Chinese man who had been traveling via ground transport from the middle of China to Bangkok for the past two days (he must have been exhausted) and a Thai who spent most of the waking time hanging out outside of the car.\n\nFor our part, Aaron worked on the project while I listened to podcasts and enjoyed the scenery until it grew too dark to see anything. At about 7:30pm, the Chinese man across the way had his bed made up and curtains drew all around him, banishing his seatmate to the top bunk early. Rough!\n\nI watched movies until we decided it was time to take our bunks. We made them up (clean bottom sheets and pillowcases were nicely folded on each bunk, and a fresh blanket was in a sealed plastic bag). We settled in, pulled our curtains and that’s when it started… the snoring. And not just casual, lying on your back or stuffy nose snoring, I mean you must have a sleep disorder and you’re keeping the entire train car awake kind of snoring.\n\nI had just fallen asleep when he started his 10 minute series of snoring (it was like 10 minutes on, 5 minutes off). I woke up annoyed, and put on a movie with headphones to try and drown it out, expecting to fall asleep a few minutes into the film. Fast forward to the credits rolling with my eyes still open and snores still happening… at 2:30am. I felt murderous!\n\nI fell asleep sometimes after that and the 5:30am shake was a rude wakeup call. But we were almost in Bangkok. The train ended up taking another hour and a half from that point in time to actually get to the train station because the traffic was so bad, but when we finally pulled up, grabbed our bags, and zombie walked-out of the station, we realized… it was Christmas Eve!\n\nUp Next: Bangkok does Christmas bigger than the U.S., Aaron squeals with glee on a canal boat commute, and Maya tries not to cry eating spicy food at an all-locals restaurant.\n\nTo properly recap our time in Chiang Mai, I must first start with our travels from the Philippines to Thailand. After spending two weeks on the beach on a remote island, Aaron and I found ourselves (dare I say it) beached-out! When our travel day finally came, we kissed our motorbike and surfboards goodbye and hopped on flight one of three that would take us to Thailand.\n\nA short stint in Singapore\n\nOur flight from Siargao to Cebu was fine… we were especially relieved when it left on-time as only one flight a day leaves Siargao, we had a tight layover in Cebu if there was any delay, our flights weren’t booked continuously, AND it was now the rainy season on the island bringing storms and flight cancellations to the little airport with a short runway. But, we left the island on schedule and landed in Cebu with plenty of time to spare. We re-entered the international terminal, picked up our SilkAir tickets, paid our hefty $15/a piece terminal fees (compare that to our ticket price to fly from Siargao to Cebu at ~$25), and we boarded the first jet plane in quite a while, bound for Singapore.\n\nWe arrived in Singapore at 8pm and were determined to not purchase a hotel room for the night. Having checked our backpacks through to Chiang Mai, we were traveling light in Singapore and were excited because we had read that the airport offers a free city tour that we wouldn’t need to leave security or customs to go on.\n\nWe had heard that the Singapore airport was pretty baller, but as soon as we arrived, we were still surprised. While the boarding areas and long hallways were pretty standard form for any airport, we also noticed huge, digital guides all over the place. At these large touchscreen kiosks, we could view all the food and shopping options, we could request a printout of suggested activities at the airport depending on our interests, and we could get a personalized WiFi access code…impressive. But we made a bee-line to the tour station only to have our hopes crushed as the last tour had left an hour ago and they no longer did night tours.\n\nI was disappointed. I was looking forward to getting out and about in the city (without a ton of effort), plus it would have helped kill time during our 13 hour layover. We recovered by walking around for a bit, checking out different things in our terminal. There was a koi pond, an orchid garden, an outside sunflower garden, a gaming room, a small movie theater, an indoor children’s play structure, free leg massagers, and great views of airplane traffic.\n\nAfter wandering around for a bit, we tried to find a quieter place to hang, eat the cheapest food we could find (food and drinks were CRAZY expensive in the airport) and watch a movie on our computers…\n\n9:00pm: Watching Star Wars on a set of uncomfortable chairs next to children’s play structure. Cold. Thunderstorms and heavy rain roll in, making it a show on the runways.\n\n10:30pm: Decided we’re tired and look for darker place to rest. Decide on the movie theater and finagle two seats.\n\n12:30am: Aaron wakes me up before the Spongebob movie comes on and looks to seek refuge elsewhere.\n\n12:45am: Walk around like zombies looking for a place to crash… all the obvious places are taken… bodies lay everywhere. Debate about just laying on the floor in a corner somewhere. Oh wait, that corner is taken up too.\n\n1:00am: Decide to follow a sign to a “refuge,” hoping beyond hope that it’s not “for-pay.” Curiosity is rewarded as reclined chairs come into view down a quieter terminal hall. Find seats next to each other (the only two left!) lay back and observe the more seasoned airport sleepers around us that have pillows, blankets, eye masks.\n\n4:30am: Too cold to continue sleeping, decide to reward ourselves with Starbucks and sit out in the humid sunflower garden to warm up as the sun starts to peek up over the horizon.\n\n6:00am: Share a banh mi sando (because it’s to expensive to purchase two).\n\n7:30am: Plane is fully boarded and takes off for Chiang Mai (finally!).\n\nArrival in Chiang Mai\n\nOur flight almost due-North from Singapore, over Malaysia and southern Thailand was full of pretty cool sights. I took a few pictures and videos including a timelapse of our descent and landing (be warned it was pretty bumpy going through the clouds).\n\nEntry into Thailand as Americans was super easy as we didn’t need visas. Basically, we just zipped through the line, had our photos taken at passport control, and went on our way. We took a cab into the city (luckily our Airbnb host had given us the lowdown on what to expect re: taking a taxi and the price) and we were whisked off to our Airbnb, which was a newly refurbished studio apartment about 15 minutes outside of the old city.\n\nFirst impressions of Chiang Mai was that it was a smaller city, with crowded streets full of motorbikes, tuk-tuks, transport vans, and cars. It was not a city made for walkers, with broken, crumbling sidewalks (when there were sidewalks), no crosswalks, and no culture of yielding to pedestrians. The air was full of fumes so much so that my throat would start to hurt walking down main roads in town. It was hot – a dry heat – and everything was concrete. But it was also totally awesome! People were friendly – many speaking a helpful amount of English – our first peeks at the temples looked amazing, and the food was pl"
