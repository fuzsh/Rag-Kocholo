Currently, more than 40 per cent of wild pollinator species are at risk of extinction.\n\nFor this reason, Briseño studies the ancient design of Maya beekeeping and dwellings and compares them to the Maya biocultural landscapes and experiences of today, showcasing how Maya beekeeping has been impacted, what lessons can be brought back from the ancestral past, and how this learning can help preserve Maya stingless beekeeping.\n\nFurthermore, native stingless bees, and Indigenous Maya traditional stingless beekeepers and peasants, are key to sustaining tropical forest, the last lungs of the world, …….\n\nTo read the complete article go to;\n\nHow Maya stingless beekeeping can help us become better stewards of culture, the environment | News | University of Calgary (ucalgary.ca)"
