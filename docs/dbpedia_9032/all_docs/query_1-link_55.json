        "text": "The television series has already enjoyed impressive ratings success in Spain, where more than 590,000 viewers tuned in to watch the first episode on CLAN TV in February 2013, and it ranked in the top four most watched series on the free digital platform. In France, the show is scheduled daily on TF1 reaching an average viewing share of 40%, and in Benelux, VTM Kazoom and Z@ppelin have reached a 38% and 47% viewing share respectively.\n\nFurther fuelling the global success of Maya, MTV Hungary has been broadcasting the classic 2D series twice a day since 12th February; in Turkey, the new CGI series has been airing twice a day since 18th February on TRT Coçuk, and it has been broadcasting on EBS in South Korea since 25th February. In Russia, Karusel will launch an extensive teaser campaign for the new Maya CGI series on 8th March for Women’s Day, and will air the first 30 episodes from May 2013.\n\nExtensive licensing programs are set to be launched between Q2 and Q4 2013 in all these countries. Coupled with comprehensive marketing plans for the year ahead across every touch point, Studio 100 is set for success with its 360 degree approach to the Maya brand. So much so that even Maya herself has been caught doing a celebratory dance: Maya – Harlem Shake!"
