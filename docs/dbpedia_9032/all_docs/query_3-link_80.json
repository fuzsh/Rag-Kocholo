During the quest, you have to help the other animals that have got in trouble because of the rain. All the familiar characters make an appearance: Maya, Willy, Ms. Cassandra, Grimelda, Flip the Grasshopper, the guards and many more.\n\nThe game is intended for children from three to six and consists of eight minigames linked by a plot. There are three difficulty levels and each game trains different aspects: memory, timing, hand-eye coordination, logic or ecology. The entire game is programmed in Macromedia Director and requires Quicktime for some animations."
