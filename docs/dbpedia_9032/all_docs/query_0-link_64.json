        "text": "My name is Pascal Wallisch, a professor of psychology\n\nand data science at NYU.\n\nI'm an expert in visual perception.\n\nI'm here to answer your questions from Twitter.\n\nThis is Optical Illusion Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAnn O'Malley, oh, nice username, at anomaly, asks,\n\nhave you seen the optical illusion where you stare\n\nat a spiral, then look away,\n\nand things appear to be crawling?\n\nYes, this is a very striking example.\n\nIt's called the motion after effect.\n\nWhen you take a look at this video here,\n\nif you look at the dot in the center, it's 10 seconds or so,\n\nand then look away, I recommend looking at your hand,\n\nthe hand will appear like it is crawling.\n\nAnd what's going on here?\n\nWe actually understand this very well.\n\nThere's been thousands of studies on this over the decades.\n\nWe know the neurons in your brain\n\nthat are underlying the perception of motion,\n\nonce they get active for a while, they get tired,\n\nthey fire at lower rate than they did before,\n\nand this is not, you know, anthropomorphizing that.\n\nYou can measure this with voltage\n\nin the brain, and we have.\n\nUser Espernyan asks,\n\nI was staring at the spinning dance illusion thing,\n\nand she started spinning backwards.\n\nThis goes viral on social media every so often,\n\nand let me be very clear early on.\n\nEvery time this does go viral, people say,\n\nOh, if you see it spinning clockwise or counterclockwise,\n\nthis will tell you whether you're\n\nlike a left brain or a right brain person,\n\nand I'm here to tell you no.\n\nThat has nothing to do with that.\n\nThat is literally fake news, that is not true.\n\nReasons you can tell that is not true is that if you look\n\nat this video, you might notice that midway looking at it,\n\nthe dancer changes the direction of motion.\n\nSo if I was clockwise before,\n\nnow it goes counterclockwise, and vice versa.\n\nObviously, nothing has changed.\n\nAnd similarly, if you watch this again,\n\nyou will have a different experience maybe.\n\nThe image itself is devoid of critical information,\n\nso the contour is just black, so it's unclear\n\nif this hand is in front or this hand is in front.\n\nSo whether the dancer will spin this way\n\nor that way will depend on your assumption\n\nif you see the front hand or the back hand, yes?\n\nAnd the way you can switch this,\n\nif you deliberately force yourself to perceive\n\nthat one arm is the front and one is the back.\n\nThis highlights two important things.\n\nOne, your perception of the world is an interpretation\n\nof the world, and that interpretation depends\n\non the assumptions that you make about the world\n\nif there's not enough information about the world.\n\nThis is a great one.\n\nSpyros Langkos asks, what is motion-induced blindness?\n\nMotion-induced blindness is a great example\n\nof like how important motion is.\n\nSo what you see in the video is\n\nif you focus on the dot in the middle,\n\nand there's three yellow dots that are always there,\n\nif you keep focusing it on the middle,\n\nthose dots in the periphery start to disappear.\n\nNow, I'm claiming that they're always there.\n\nThey never go away.\n\nYou can confirm that, and you can rewind the video\n\nby just by keeping looking at that.\n\nSo what's going on here?\n\nMotion is very, very strong.\n\nSo this is another example\n\nof how your perception is a best guess of the world.\n\nSo there's two competing models now.\n\nOne is that there's three dots and they're always there.\n\nAnd one is a rotating plane\n\nthat's kind of occluding those dots,\n\nand when in doubt, your brain will go\n\nto move, to motion, and I'm actually now gonna ruin magic\n\nfor you I guess, because most magic tricks rely on this.\n\nThe idea is if I create some distraction by, you know,\n\nmaking a lot of motion here,\n\nI can do literally anything else\n\nin plain sight and you will not see it.\n\nSass the Seabass asks can someone please explain\n\nthe difference between the phi phenomenon\n\nand beta motion to me?\n\nAnd I'm happy to help.\n\nBeta motion is happening right now.\n\nIf you're seeing this on a device,\n\nand this is a video of me talking, there is no motion.\n\nSo you see I'm moving right now, but there's no motion.\n\nYou see still images, something like 30 or 60,\n\nor whatever the frame rate of your monitor is, a second.\n\nYour brain is inferring the motion between that.\n\nSo basically if there's two objects,\n\nfirst one is an object here and then object is here,\n\nthe brain is filling in that something is moving.\n\nIf something is here and then disappears,\n\nand then something is here, the brain concludes, infers,\n\nthere's an unconscious inference, conclusion, it's a guess,\n\nit didn't just was here and then it disappeared\n\nand then was here.\n\nNo, it moved, that's the inference.\n\nAnd if you make this fast enough, 20 hertz or 30 hertz,\n\nit will appear like smooth motion.\n\nThat's the beta motion.\n\nWhat phi is, is you have the objects static,\n\nsometimes in a ring, and you have then\n\nsome shadowy thing occluding, it will appear\n\nlike a object is moving around them.\n\nThat's phi.\n\nThat's what phi motion is.\n\nColi Annn asks, how do mirages happen?\n\nSo weird.\n\nThat is a example of a genuine optical illusion.\n\nMost things that are called optic illusions are\n\nnot optical illusions.\n\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\nOptics means light, it's Greek for light.\n\nSo a mirage is an example of an actual optical illusion.\n\nIn contrast, most of the other things we'll see\n\ntoday are not optical illusions, they're visual illusions.\n\nThe difference is those are not in the light.\n\nThose are created by your brain.\n\nIt usually happens if there is, you know,\n\nair that's being heated by a surface, like for instance,\n\na road, and that is then hitting a layer of air above it\n\nthat's colder, and at that transition between the cold air\n\nwhich is denser, and the hot air which is less dense,\n\nlight will bend.\n\nThat's what creates mirage.\n\nNext question by Andres Gomez Emilsson, does it feel\n\nlike the dark parts are pushing brightness\n\nonto the center and the white is pushing out?\n\nFirst of all, this is called the Asahi illusion by Kitaoka.\n\nWhat I find is most striking\n\nabout this is that the center part here, right?\n\nDoes to me, and probably to you,\n\nalthough it depends on your screen, look brighter\n\nthan the background white in the background, right?\n\nCan you see that?\n\nAnd it's not, it's the exact same whiteness\n\nin the center than in the periphery, right?\n\nSo what is going on here is that the gradients of luminance\n\nthat are pushing into the center,\n\nas the poster asks, make you assume\n\nthat you're looking at something like the sun.\n\nThe size of your pupil is a reflex.\n\nIt dilates and constricts,\n\ndepends on how much light is coming in.\n\nSo if you look at a very bright light source\n\nlike I'm now looking at the studio lights,\n\nmy pupils will constrict.\n\nResearch shows that if you look at this illusion of an image\n\nthat's not brighter, you pupils will also constrict,\n\nwhich is quite striking, 'cause this is a reflex.\n\nIt's not under conscious control.\n\nJohn Teegarden asks, this is a pretty cool illusion.\n\nDoes the black hole look like it's expanding to you?\n\nAnd this was discovered this year in 2022,\n\nand what was discovered was two things, number one, seven\n\nout of eight people report that yes, the black hole look\n\nlike it's growing, it's expanding into the periphery.\n\nSecond of all, it's also been shown\n\nthat as if it was actually getting darker,\n\nyour pupil is dilating as if it was actually getting darker,\n\nso this is again stunning,\n\n'cause this is not under your conscious control.\n\nThis is a reflex, and it's responding\n\nto your perception of the image, not to the actual light.\n\nLisa Gatto2 asks, is there an explanation for the dress?\n\nI was late.\n\nNow Lisa, you are in luck.\n\nI have the actual dress.\n\nThe dress itself is unambiguously\n\nin bright light, black and blue.\n\nYes, we can all agree on that.\n\nIt looks black and blue.\n\nBut that's not what we were asking.\n\nWe were asking was, is the image of the dress\n\nblack and blue or white and gold?\n\nIf you ask that, most people will say, two thirds,\n\naccording to our research, will see this image\n\nas white and gold, so what's going on here?\n\nThe lighting information in this image is ambiguous,\n\nbecause it was taken inside, but it was overexposed\n\non a cell phone picture of a Samsung camera.\n\nSo in other words, it's unclear if this was\n\nartificial lighting or outside lighting,\n\nnatural lighting, yes?\n\nIf there's not enough information,\n\nour brains generally don't say I don't know.\n\nThey're very immodest.\n\nThey will fill in the missing information\n\nby making assumptions about the world.\n\nWhat assumptions you make about the lighting depends\n\non what experience of light you have.\n\nSo what we could show in our research is that\n\npeople who are morning people are more likely to see\n\nthe dress as white and gold,\n\nwhereas night owls are more like see it as black and blue.\n\nAnd the reason for that is they're assuming\n\nthat illumination that they have seen more\n\nof in their life, and mentally subtract that from the image.\n\nOriginally in 2015 when this came out,\n\ntwo thirds of the people saw it\n\nas white and gold and one third saw as black blue,\n\neven though in real life,\n\nit's unambiguously 100% black and blue.\n\nElizabeth Kropp asks\n\nhow did they make Tupac in hologram form?\n\nWell, there's two questions here.\n\nFirst question is, how do holograms work,\n\nand how did they do this specific one?\n\nHolograms work by having lasers,\n\ntwo lasers interfere with each other, and lasers by the way,\n\ndon't have, just have one wavelength.\n\nThey also have one phase, they're phase locked,\n\nso from that interference patterns,\n\nyou can then reconstruct the entire image.\n\nIn other words, a genuine hologram will look 3D\n\nfrom any perspective you look at it,\n\nbut it will be somewhat monochromatic.\n\nSo what it did in a Tupac case,\n\nit's actually not a hologram, just wanna be very clear.\n\nWhat they did is something else that's called,\n\nit's a version of Pepper's ghost where you have\n\na transparent screen at 45 degrees where you project\n\nprevious images or previous footage of Tupac onto it.\n\nThat's an illusion.\n\nIf you look out of that plane\n\nfrom a different perspective, from a different angle,\n\nit would not look 3D like a genuine hologram would.\n\nSo the Tupac hologram was not a hologram.\n\nBS Jeffrey asks,\n\nhas anyone experienced the wagon wheel effect\n\nwhen not watching TV or movies?\n\nSo first of all, what is the wagon wheel illusion?\n\nLet's say you watch a car, and their tire is spinning\n\nat a certain rate.\n\nThat interacts with the sampling rate of the camera.\n\nIf the frame rate of the wheels, of the spokes\n\nof the wheels of the car, rims I guess, is faster than that,\n\nwhat I call aliasing, it will actually look\n\nlike it's moving backwards.\n\nSo basically that's from the interaction between the frame\n\nin the video and in reality.\n\nSome people get that in reality without the camera,\n\nand this is, to be honest with you,\n\na very controversial subject, because the implication is\n\nthat your mind has a certain frame rate,\n\nand certain people might have a different frame rate\n\nthan other people,\n\nwhich is why some people might see it more than others.\n\nIt's as related to how tired you are,\n\nor how well rested you are.\n\nMight be also be an individual difference.\n\nBut the implications are profound, 'cause that means\n\nyour mind is running at a certain frame rate.\n\nAnd yeah, I think that is true.\n\nDifferent people's brains probably run\n\nat different frequencies.\n\nJarell Ebuka asks, in a world full of confusion,\n\ncan we really trust our eyes?\n\nAnd that's a wonderful question,\n\nand I'll try to give you a nuanced answer.\n\nYour brain does not live in the outside world.\n\nThe brain is encased fully in a bony shell.\n\nIn other words, it's extremely, completely dark.\n\nWhat your perception is\n\nof the world is ultimately just a guess.\n\nNow to be fair, that guess is usually a very good guess.\n\nAll of us got here without accidents,\n\nusually navigate the world fine, so in other words,\n\nusually your eyes are not lying to you.\n\nAnd the reason for that is that billion years\n\nof evolution made sure that if you're wrong by this case,\n\nthe punishment could be death.\n\nSo this has been debugged\n\nin a very relentless process over a billion years.\n\nOnly a stoner asks, how real is reality?\n\nOur eyes deceive us, our brains trick us into seeing faces.\n\nOur thoughts create themselves.\n\nAnd you think any drugs to make shirt trippy?\n\nUsername checks out.\n\nThat is a really good point.\n\nIt is the very existence of illusions that illustrates\n\nthe difference between what you perceive\n\nand what is out there, which makes it clear that\n\nwhat looks to us like reality is ultimately just a guess,\n\neven if the guess is pretty good.\n\nWhat illusions are is a, you know, a way\n\nfor psychologists to show people that there is a difference\n\nbetween what's out there and what your best guess is.\n\nI don't wanna freak anyone out.\n\nWhat this means is, and most people don't notice is that\n\nThe Matrix actually is a documentary.\n\nIt is your brain that creates this matrix for you.\n\nAgain, this can be very feel very, feel very claustrophobic,\n\nbecause you're like, Okay, what is really out there?\n\nYou will see motion when there's no motion.\n\nYou will see color and there's no color.\n\nYou will be confused about the spatial layout of things,\n\nand things like that.\n\nSo the question is, what actually is out there?\n\nChris Lintott asks,\n\nI've written often about the moon illusion,\n\nwhich makes the moon larger and close to the horizon.\n\nDoes anyone know if the Apollo astronauts experience\n\nan Earth illusion?\n\nFirst of all, great question.\n\nSo what the moon illusion is, as the poster asks is\n\nif you look at the moon on the horizon,\n\nit will look considerably larger\n\nthan if you look at it high up in the sky.\n\nIt's the same moon, so how is that possible?\n\nWhen I was in grad school a long time ago,\n\nI read a very thick book about 100 theories\n\nof why the moon illusion happens,\n\nso this is still unresolved.\n\nWhat I find most compelling is once the moon is\n\non the horizon, you have a local context.\n\nIn other words, if there is a hill, or a mountain,\n\nor a house even, it will make the moon look\n\nreally, really big, because you know that the house\n\nor the mountain is really, really big, yes?\n\nWhereas if it's high up in the sky,\n\nthen you have no reference point.\n\nSo it'll look like it actually is visually,\n\nactually very small.\n\nThe moon is only one degree of visual angle\n\nor something like that.\n\nWould you get that on the moon?\n\nAnd the answer is, to my knowledge,\n\nnobody saw the Earth that low.\n\nBut my prediction would be, yeah, if you go\n\nto a moon crater and look at the Earth\n\nfrom that vantage point, you would get an Earth illusion.\n\nDaniel Barker asks, Adelson's checker-shadow illusion hurts\n\nmy brain every time I look at it.\n\nWhy must you lie to me, eyes?\n\nOkay, as you can see here,\n\nI think we can all agree that the shade\n\nof gray in A looks different than the shade of gray B,\n\neven though I tell you\n\nthat they are the exact same shade of gray.\n\nBut even if you know that, you cannot see them like that.\n\nYou still will see B as lighter than A.\n\nWhat's going on is that your brain is taking\n\ninto account the shadow that's coming\n\noff the cylinder here, and is mentally subtracting that\n\nfrom the gray in B, which makes it look lighter.\n\nWhy must eyes lie?\n\nWell, the eyes must lie to you because the image\n\nthat the eye gets is actually a very poor image.\n\nThe optics are bad.\n\nThe brain has to like, kind of like enhance the image\n\nfor you to make sense of the world.\n\nSo appearances can be deceiving.\n\nRich Sweet asks is this Animal Collective album cover moving\n\nor my tripping out?\n\nAnd here it is.\n\nA good proportion of people will see motion here,\n\nbut there is no motion,\n\nand that's what makes it so trippy.\n\nYou know that there's no motion, and you can actually see\n\nthat if you look at something closely,\n\nbut you see things moving in the periphery.\n\nThis disconnect between your perception of motion\n\nand you know there's no motion creates this trippy feeling.\n\nTweetyaca asks does everyone else get\n\nthe Hermann grid illusion when using their Mac keyboard,\n\nor is it just me?\n\nThe Hermann grid is, people see dark spots,\n\nillusionary dark spots, where bright lines meet.\n\nAnd you can see that we have a Mac here.\n\nI see that right now.\n\nThere's bright lines, and in this intersection\n\nof those bright lines is a dark spot that's not there.\n\nThat's illusory, that's a Hermann grid.\n\nThis is an example of what's called ladder inhibition.\n\nThe idea is in the brain neurons that are next to each other\n\nthat process a certain region of space inhibit each other,\n\nand the more they're active,\n\nthe more strongly they inhibit their neighbor.\n\nNow, if you're very strongly inhibited\n\nby four strong active neighbors,\n\nyou're gonna be strongly inhibited.\n\nIt will appear darker,\n\n'cause it can inhibit the peripheral less.\n\nJessica Pin asks does anyone know what it means that I see\n\nthe lines as the same in the Muller Lyar illusion?\n\nHere is the Mullar Lyar illusion.\n\nAll of these lines in the center are the same length,\n\nbut most people will perceive this one\n\nin the middle as longer than this one,\n\nmost people, but not everybody sees that.\n\nThis actually happens to be what I'm interested in in my lab\n\nwhere we study individual differences in perception.\n\nWhat's going on here is that people take the context\n\ninto account when interpreting the scene.\n\nI would bet that you probably have experience\n\nwith like maybe you're like an artist\n\nor something like that.\n\nMaybe you can see through what the appearance is,\n\nand you can recover, like you can ignore the context.\n\nYou know what the length of lines is, so artists,\n\nfor instance, don't see the Muller Lyar illusion.\n\nSo people who have a lot of experience with actual drawings,\n\nthey will not be fooled by this.\n\nBreakdown Paradise asks, how do magic eye pictures work?\n\nSo this is an example of where people are inferring,\n\nor minds are inferring the third dimension\n\nfrom a two-dimensional image.\n\nThis is called stereopsis.\n\nThe two eyes see the image slightly differently,\n\nfrom slightly different perspectives,\n\nbut your brain knows that, so basically it can compute\n\nif you see the same image slightly differently,\n\nthat there's actually a three-dimensional depth to that.\n\nThis distance has to be reconstructed in your mind.\n\nElizasstuff asks how do 3D movies work?\n\nThe idea is that two images are presented.\n\nSo if you have like colored lenses,\n\nso let's say one lens is orange and one lens is blue.\n\nSo the red will get 3D orange lens,\n\nbut not the blue, that creates an offset,\n\nand this offset is the same idea.\n\nIt will then created a 3D effect.\n\nEnna Cooper asks, if you have a really long Ames room,\n\nis there any limit to the extent of illusion?\n\nCould you have to crawl on your hands and knees at one end\n\nof the room, yet slip through a gap\n\nin the skirting board at the other?\n\nSo here's the Ames room.\n\nSo you look at that through a peephole,\n\nand looks like a normal square room, but it's not.\n\nOne of those ends will be much farther than the other one,\n\nbut it looks like they're on the same distance away, right?\n\nBy inference, and if you think you know\n\nthey're the same distance way, the one\n\nthat is actually farther in reality will then look larger.\n\nSo the user asks a good question, how far can you push that?\n\nAnd I'll put that right back at the user.\n\nLet's find out, because in reality,\n\nwe haven't tried that big ones.\n\nThe biggest one was made in India in 2015\n\nthat's in the Guinness Book World Records,\n\nbut that was not that big, so why don't we make\n\na really big one to see when that breaks down?\n\nEventually, of course, the curvature\n\nof the Earth will swallow one of the people.\n\nLupin Chevalier asks what is forced perspective?\n\nOkay, great, so look at this.\n\nThis is is Ames window, not Ames room.\n\nThis appears to be a square window, yes?\n\nBut it's not.\n\nIt's a trapezoid in reality, so this actually is larger\n\nthan, this part is larger than this part.\n\nBut because you know how perspective works,\n\nyou will assume that this is far away, even though it's not.\n\nAll of this comes from the fact\n\nthat you do not have this third dimension available.\n\nYou have to reconstruct it in your mind,\n\nso it's ambiguous if this is far away, if this is far away,\n\nso you use your familiarity to resolve that.\n\nAnd you are familiar with perspective.\n\nEvery painting you look at\n\nsince the Renaissance uses this effect\n\nwhere you basically have a perspective.\n\nIt's a flat image which just looks far away\n\nif it's deeper in.\n\nJim Rose Circus asks, my niece asked me\n\nwhy is his body so little?\n\nAnd now I can't unsee it.\n\nYeah, that is a very good point.\n\nMost people, of course, don't look at logos that closely,\n\nbut I'm here to tell you\n\nthat there is a bear in the Toblerone logo.\n\nThere's an arrow in the FedEx logo.\n\nOnce you saw that, you cannot unsee that.\n\nSo until your dying day, you will see this little man here\n\non the body of the KFC logo, and it's not just KFC.\n\nI'm gonna ruin ducks for you forever.\n\nLook at this duck.\n\nAll ducks are wearing dog masks.\n\nNow that you saw that, you cannot unsee that.\n\nWhat this shows is that experience factors\n\ninto your perception, just like in a dress\n\nwhere like your prior experience\n\nwith a stimulus helps you resolve what you see.\n\nNoah Gerard asks I need to see the Penrose stairs in person.\n\nI can look at it a million times,\n\nand still not fully understand the physics of it.\n\nWell, there's a reason for that.\n\nThis was popularized by MC Escher,\n\nand this 3D reality, this does not exist.\n\nThe Penrose stairs are just one example\n\nof what Tara Aders asks, which is what is a blivet?\n\nA blivet is an impossible object,\n\nand they're quite a few of those.\n\nAnd the whole point of it is you can, so for instance,\n\nif someone asks, Hey, how many spikes are there?\n\nThree, there are three if you focus on this side,\n\nor four if you focus on this side.\n\nWho's right?\n\nWell, you're both wrong.\n\nThe same question you can ask is\n\nif I'm asking is this Slinky, by the way,\n\nit's always good you have a Slinky on hand.\n\nIs this a circle or is it a sign wave, yes?\n\nAnd the answer is the 3D reality is, Slinky is both,\n\ndepends on your perspective.\n\nSo your perspective also determines what you see,\n\nand in this case, the 3D reality transcends\n\nboth the circle or the spiral.\n\nEat Right Arizona asks have you ever heard\n\nof the age-old diet trick based on the Delboeuf illusion\n\nto use a smaller plate in order to trick the brain\n\ninto thinking you are eating more than you actually are?\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here.\n\nFirst of all, what is the Delboeuf illusion?\n\nThe answer is a circle surrounded by a larger circle,\n\nas you can see here in the image, will appear larger\n\nthan it actually is.\n\nThe answer is yes, you can use that,\n\nand yes, this does work.\n\nAnd as research shows, weight control is all about,\n\nit's not all, but it's in large part about portion control.\n\nAgain, when we go back to whether these illusions are good\n\nor bad for you, you can use these illusions\n\nfor good, absolutely.\n\nSusan Wardle asks why do we mistakenly see faces\n\nwhen there are none?\n\nThis is a condition that's called pareidolia.\n\nYes, it is true that most people see faces everywhere.\n\nMany people see that.\n\nPerception's a guess,\n\nand the guess was debugged by evolution,\n\nso if you're wrong, you die.\n\nIn other words, if there's actually someone out there\n\nwho's trying to get you, and you think there's nobody\n\nout to get you, you might die.\n\nIf there's no one, and you think there's someone,\n\nyou may get a little scared, but that's fine.\n\nThe payoff matrix is vastly in favor of false positives,\n\nmeaning thousands of false positives is okay,\n\nmeaning seeing face when there are no faces,\n\nbut if you miss one actual face, an enemy, you might die.\n\nSo the system is built to accept thousands\n\nof false positives for one false negative.\n\nAll right, that's it.\n\nThat's all the illusion we have time for.\n\nI hope you learned something useful.\n\nSee you next time."
