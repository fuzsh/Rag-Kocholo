        "text": "How old are the Mayan ruins in Mexico?\n\nGoogle lists several common questions for the Maya.\n\nThere are human settlements thousands of years before the Olmecs but the early settlements had no hieroglyphic writing nor monumental sculpture.\n\nThe Maya developed in many parts of southern Mexico and El Peten, Guatemala. It takes an entire dissertation or monograph to cover these early ruins, but already several hundred years BC there were pyramid-like structures, carved stone sculptures, and other aspects of Mayan civilization already well developed.\n\nThen the Teotihuacan civilization expanded from Central Mexico southward, circa AD 300 (check with recent monographs to get actual dates). For one or two generations Tikal, Uaxactun, Yaxha, Holmul and other Maya sites of Peten were under dominating Teotihuacan influence.\n\nGradually the Teotihuacan empire withered and during these same years local Maya groups re-asserted their own Mayan art. But then in during Tepeu 2 times, there was a resurgence in Classic Maya kings clearly showing Teotihuacan deities, showing their solders in pseudo-Teotihuacan military uniforms, etc. But by then Teotihuacan itself had been mostly abandoned.\n\nFor many decades scholars preferred to focus on the local Mayan achievements in Guatemala and not to admit to the strong Teotihuacan influence. The FLAAR Report on The Escuintla Hoards was one of the few publications which pointed out the substantial impact of Teotihuacan expansion into Guatemala.\n\nThere was also Toltec influence, and Aztec (Nahuatl) influence. The Cotzumalhuapa art style is pre-Aztec but has a lot of features of Mexican cultures (but not purely Teotihuacan; more a mixture). The ballgame yokes, ballgame hachas, and ballgame handstones used by both Cotzumalhuapa ballplayers and Copan Maya ballplayers come from a partially Mexican heritage (but more Classic El Tajin; since the Teotihuacans did not have the same kind of ballgame hachas, ballgame handstones, or carved ballgame yokes.\n\nAre the Mayans Mexican?\n\nA million or so Yucatec Maya people are Mexican citizens, as are the several hundred Lacandon Maya of lowland Chiapas. Plus there are other Mayan language groups in the highland mountains of Chiapas.\n\nBut there are also lots of Mayan people in the Chorti Mayan border area of Honduras (border with Chorti Mayan area of adjacent Guatemala). There are some Mayan related archaeological sites in El Salvador but only in a limited area bordering on Guatemala.\n\nLots of Q’eqchi’ Mayan people in Belize. And millions of Mayan people in Guatemala (potentially more than in southern Mexico). So, not all Mayans are Mexican (but a lot are). And, there are people in Guatemala who speak Xinca language (not a Mayan language). Plus the descendants of African people on the Caribbean coast of Guatemala.\n\nAre there Mayans still alive today?\n\nYes, there are several million Mayan speaking people still alive today, especially in Guatemala and the adjacent Yucatan peninsula (Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucatan itself).\n\nWhen we go on field trips into remote areas, we find villages where no Spanish is spoken: the villagers speak only Q’eqchi’ (K’ekchi’) Mayan language. We have three Q’eqchi’ Mayan speaking employees who go with us to visit the villages.\n\nSome of the dwellings in these villages have the type of beds used by the Maya a thousand years ago. Plus the way they build their thatched dwellings is also a thousand year old style. Of course most new houses are built with concrete block and tin roofs, but we have found some remote areas that still have original Maya style dwellings.\n\nWhy do we call our project MayanToons and not MayaToons?\n\nTo call anything related to animation Maya would be to suggest it is associated with Maya software. Yes, we use Maya software, but we have no relationship with Autodesk at present, so we felt it would not be appropriate to focus on Maya.\n\nThe second reason we call our project MayanToons is because the Mayan languages are the key to understanding Mayan culture. Plus I have been attempting to learn the Mayan Q’eqchi’ language for about 2 years.\n\nOur Mayan cartoons are not focused on the Mayan Calendar\n\nDuring the year 2012 end of the world via end of the Mayan calendar, we had a discussion of this, but did no Maya cartoons nor comic strips on the Mayan calender date of December 21, 2012 nor other end of the world cartoons nor apocalypse. We developed the concepts for our Mayan cartoon characters during 2013, 2014, and 2015, launching this MayanToons web site in December 2015."
