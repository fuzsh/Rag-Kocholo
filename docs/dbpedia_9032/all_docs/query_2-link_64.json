        "text": "A network of Mayan women produce melipona honey and protect biodiversity in Mexico\n\nIn the Mexican state of YucatÃ¡n, a group of Mayan women are the worldâs largest producers of rare melipona honey, produced by a genus of neotropical stingless bees unique to Latin America. The workers have organised themselves into a co-operative network to strengthen their capacities and jointly face entrepreneurship challenges as caretakers of these indigenous bees.\n\n\"Before, we didn't have much knowledge about meliponiculture. There are many things that we did not know, but through these trainings that we have taken, they have helped us a lot. We have changed our lives, because before we were only embroiderers. How much did we earn [back then]? Very little, there were no more resources. On the other hand, now I have changed a lot as a person\", remarked Fany ArgÃ¼elles Parra.\n\nShe and 96 other Mayan women are part of the Kuxtalil co-operative network, which represents 12 producerâs groups across nine locations in the YucatÃ¡n towns of ManÃ­, Dzan, Oxkutzcab, Teabo, ChacsinkÃ­n, and Tekax.\n\nThe melipona bee, or XunÃ¡n kab, as it is called in the Mayan language, produces a honey with medicinal properties that has been used since ancient times in the Mayan culture.\n\nItem 1 of 1\n\nGift of Life\n\nâThe bees have taught us a lot, because they always work as a team and achieve great things. We hope that by joining this network, we, as women, can achieve great things together as well,â noted Julia Daniela Ku Tzuc, from the Melipona bee colony in ManÃ­, YucatÃ¡n.\n\nAs women, they have often been excluded from development opportunities, so part of the network's efforts has focused on implementing informational workshops, on topics including human development, production, organisation, commercialisation, and administration. These efforts help build capacity, maintain production, bolster management, and engender a recognition among the women that they can serve as agents of change in their communities.\n\n\"Kuxtalil in maya means gift of life. Before we were just housewives. This network has opened the way for us. It is a way of seeing the world differently. At first, we only took care of the children, but thanks to the training â because they have the courage to talk about self-esteem â they have made us see that women can achieve many things.\"\n\nJulia Daniela Ku Tzuc\n\nPrecious bees\n\nUnlike the classic honey bee - Apis mellifera - the hives of the Melipona beecheii are placed in boxes or jobones - traditional Mayan log structures. Because the bees are stingless, the jobones can be installed near homes and in vacant lots. The presence of the bees provides multiple benefits, from traditional use of the honey for its medicinal properties, as well as a significant economic potential from its sale and export use, as melipona honey is less likely to crystallise than its better-known alternatives.\n\nâPersonally, the main benefit is independence. Before we were financially dependent on our husbands, but now we depend on ourselves and our children also depend on us.â\n\nLucelly GÃ³ngora Mis\n\nHoney heals\n\nIn addition to selling honey through the co-operativeâs Yaal-Kab brand, the members have developed personal hygiene and beauty products including soaps, body and facial creams, and shampoos.\n\nThe objective of the brand is to provide marketing opportunities to the subsidiary producers, since one of the main obstacles to selling melipona honey or its products is the lack of access to markets. For these women, establishing trust with customers is a priority in order to render this less-known specialty honey financially viable.\n\nThe production of melipona honey is significantly lower compared to the European bee, but with better perceived medicinal properties.

But thanks to the fact that we joined the network and got trained, we obtained eight hives.â\n\nSaudy Moo OrtegÃ³n\n\nLack of consumer familiarity with their products and the risks of counterfeit honey are not the only threats the women have faced.\n\nThe 2020 hurricane season in the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula brought tropical storms and torrential rains, generating temporary losses for nearly every network member. Soila Aquino says that of the 56 boxes they had before the floods, they were only able to rescue 17, a significant setback.\n\nSoila Aquino says that, of the 56 boxes they had before the floods, they were only able to rescue 17, losing almost all their progress.\n\nâBut thanks to the recovery project and the support from SGP, we have been able to move forward. With training we learned to divide hives and take full advantage of the honey, so now we have 26 jobones. Now we are ready, and we know where to put the bees in case a storm comes to avoid damage.â\n\nSoila Aquino\n\nPollinating Change\n\nIn Mexico, SGP promotes beekeeping and meliponiculture with a comprehensive approach that includes promoting biodiversity conservation in the landscape that provides nectar and pollen: the Mayan forest.\n\nFor 26 years, it has supported a network of 76 beekeeping projects with a territorial vision, through strategies that are designed by local communities themselves and promote mutual learning and scaling up.\n\nFor beekeeping, organic management and fair trade are supported to generate environmental and livelihood benefits.\n\nIn the case of meliponiculture, support for this sector offers new economic opportunities to more than 300 women and men, while rescuing a species threatened by environmental degradation and deforestation.\n\nIn both sectors, SGP also promotes fair value chains, which make it possible to connect producers with responsible consumers.\n\nThe products from the Yaal-Kab brand are the result of the work of over 90 empowered women who, in their quest for economic independence, have achieved a symbiotic relationship with their environment.\n\nThe bees not only benefit their protectors directly, but also generate better crops in the locations where their colonies are found, since their pollination promotes diversity among plants and improves the quality of the local fruits. In exchange, the women provide key habitat and protection for the rare indigenous bees.\n\nTeresita de JesÃºs Hau JimÃ©nez , a member of the network.
