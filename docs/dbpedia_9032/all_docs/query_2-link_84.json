        "text": "G'day Mate,\n\nBecause no one has posted to you yet, I thought I may try and help you.\n\nI looked up online how to attach a hair system using x gen, and this is what I found...\n\nIn the X Gen Editor, under Guide Animation, click Attach Hair System section. The selected output curves now drive the guide's animation.\n\nI found this from the below url. Please copy and paste into browser.\n\nhttps://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Maya/fil...\n\nI hope this helps you\n\nTim from Australia\n\nHi there,\n\nSo sorry I sent you a bad url.\n\nHere is the working url with steps. Please copy and paste again\n\nhttps://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Maya/fil...\n\nI want to help you even though I am not an expert in x gen, so I did some more searching on the internet and found out some facts that may help.....\n\nFor batch rendering, one additional step is necessary. The XGen collections used in your scene need to be exported to disk to ensure that mental raycan find them. To do so, click on File -> Export Patches for Batch Render in the XGen window:\n\nThis was found at the below url for someone else having the same problem with attaching hair to a bee. Please copy and paste.\n\nhttps://blog.mentalray.com/2015/03/31/troubleshooting-mental-ray-renders-of-maya-xgen/\n\nIn regards to a video, I could not find a video of a bee on the internet, but found a charcter moving with x gen hair attached to it. Please copy/paste\n\nhttps://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Creating-Cartoon-Hair-in-Maya-using-XGen-and-nHair/5638669...\n\nP.s. Here is the link I found with someone having the same problem as you. Thought you may want to have a look. Please copy and paste.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Maya/comments/4b414e/first_time_here_and_need_some_help_debugging_my/\n\nPPs Here are ten tips for using Xgen in regards to animation and simulation. Please copy/paste\n\nhttp://www.cgchannel.com/2015/06/10-tips-for-using-mayas-xgen-in-production/\n\nSorry if I could not be more help, but I have tried as much as possible without going too in depth.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nTim\n\nThanks for the documents. I actually found another way. I converted the xgen hairs to geometry. What I did was go to Modeling > Generate > Convert XGen Primitives to Polygons. The other method is Modify>New in Maya Extension 2, and that turns the hair to actual polygons as well but is the same thing. After that is a matter of attaching the hair where you want it and paint weight it so that it moves how you want it, which is in the stage I am now. I think I just needed to update Maya to Extension 2 and get those additional commands. I do appreciate the effort in helping though. Thanks again!\n\n-Dylan"
