        "meta_description": "Citizens and Permanent Residents of Canada: Quebec Residents To be considered a Quebec resident, students must meet all the criteria of one of the 14 situations outlined by the Quebec Government. Please note that only Canadian citizens (including Canadian First Nations) and permanent residents can apply for Quebec residency for the purposes of tuition fee assessment. All other categories of students (International, Refugee, Diplomat, Visitor's Visa, etc.) may not be considered as Quebec residents according to the Ministry of Education's directives. There are, however, certain fee exemptions for students of these categories that allow for tuition fee reductions; click here for more information. Important re Break in Enrolment: Note that if a student is absent (i.e. not enrolled) for more than 2 semesters (not counting the Summer term), it may be necessary to reprove their Quebec residency status. Please verify your legal and tuition fee status in Minerva (select the appropriate term) to confirm that the QC residency is still active. If not, please contact us. Applicants to Medicine: contact the Faculty of Medicine Admissions Office. A table of break in enrolment scenarios is available here.
