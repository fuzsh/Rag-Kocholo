        "text": "Rita M. Lemelin, 87, of Berlin passed away on Monday, November 11, 2019, at the St. Vincent de Paul Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center in Berlin. She was born in Cascade, Gorham NH, on July 7, 1932, the daughter of William and Desneige (Busque) St. Pierre and was a lifelong resident of the area. She was a member of Good Shepherd Parish, the Auxiliary to the VFW White Mountain Post 2520 in Berlin and the Fraternal Order of the Eagles.\n\nAs a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, sister, and friend, Rita ensured all around her felt loved and laughed throughout life. She loved all of her children and grandchildren equally and did everything she could to help all of them be successful and happy. She was the glue that kept the family together throughout the years. As a mother in the summer she would take the kids for outings for the day and Sylvio would join after work for an evening of swimming and picnicking. As a grandmother, she would cook huge Christmas meals and spoil all of the grandkids with lots of sweets and presents. She always kept the family together and made sure everyone had fun and food in their bellies.\n\nShe was always the wittiest one in the room and knew how to get a laugh. She and Sylvio enjoyed lots of fun times with friends, and have had many good stories to tell. They were always busy with the children, friends, and huge extended family gatherings, but Rita made sure that she and Sylvio made time for each other. Rita and Sylvio had a love that lasts a lifetime and will live on in their children, and their children's children, and for generations after that.\n\nMembers of the family include her husband of 67 years Sylvio P. Lemelin Jr. of Berlin; 2 daughters Linda Friend and husband Richard of Leominster, MA and Betty Dube of Dummer; 3 sons Mark Lemelin of Berlin, Michael Lemelin of Dover and Craig Lemelin and wife Amy of Rochester; 6 grandchildren; a brother Dick St. Pierre of Manchester; 2 sisters Jeanne Brien of North Andover, MA and Lorraine Martin and husband Roger of Salem; nieces, nephews and cousins. She was predeceased by a daughter Diane Lemelin, an infant grandson Joshua Dube, 3 brothers Henry, Norman and Pete St. Pierre; and by 2 sisters Doris Leubke and Lucille Eafrati.\n\nSERVICES: A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Friday November 15, 2019 at 10 AM at St. Anne Church of Good Shepherd Parish. Interment will be in the St. Kieran Cemetery. Relatives and friends may call at the Bryant Funeral Home, 180 Hillside Avenue, Berlin, NH on Thursday from 6:00 to 8:00 PM.
