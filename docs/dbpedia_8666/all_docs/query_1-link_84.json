Barb did not tell the family what model of car she was born in, but we suspect it was a Yellow Chevrolet Camaro Convertible.

Through that meeting, Barb was introduced to John’s son Roger and a whirl wind romance began. Roger and Barb were married on July 2, 1967. While living in Dickinson, they welcomed, a son, Gary in 1968 and a daughter, Melissa in 1969. They transferred the family to Miles City in 1970. While in Miles City they added two more children, a son, Brandon in 1979 and a daughter, Lindsey in 1981.While in Miles City, Barb worked at the Custer County Rest Home for several years before going to TLC Personal Care Home.
