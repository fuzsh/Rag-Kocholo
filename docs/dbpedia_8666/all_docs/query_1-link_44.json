His writing is characterized by empathy amid social and individual farce, and his paternalism in presenting his well-rounded characters established Lemelin as one of Canada's most acclaimed twentieth-century writers. He was a pioneer of social realism in French Canada.",

        "text": "Career\n\nRoger Lemelin was a journalist and a businessman with interests in advertising, food processing, and lumbering. In 1948-1952, he worked as a journalist for such magazines as Time, Life, and Fortune. In 1951, he began writing for television. In 1972, Lemelin became a president and publisher of LaPresse. He worked there until 1981.\n\nRoger Lemelin's writing reflects his life and complements his satire. His first two novels portrayed the period when he dropped out of high school to support the family. Anger over a more personal setback, however, fueled his writing. Lemelin, who in the early 1940s wanted to win the Canadian downhill skiing championships, broke his ankle in an accident. Confined to bed and forced to surrender his dream, he first wrote to channel his frustrations.\n\nAn pied de la pente douce is arguably his venting of anger over the skiing accident. Translated as The Town Below, Lemelin's first novel involves the frustration of young love, economic disparity, and a sentimentalized version of twentieth-century Canadian youth. The novel contrasts nineteenth-century simplicity with twentieth-century urbanization. Critics generally praised Lemelin's debut novel for his honesty and for avoiding clichés. Several critics also praised Lemelin's raw talent for style and description. Iris Barry of the New York Herald Tribune Weekly Book Report said Lemelin \"draws richly and arrestingly upon real-life material observed with rare compassion and tinctured with youthful bitterness, and its author's name is emphatically one to note for the future.\"\n\nLes Plouffe is considered Lemelin's masterpiece. Hailed as \"one of Canada's great comic novels\" by Allison Mitcham, Les Plouffe introduced Canada to the idiosyncrasies and laughable shortcomings of family life. Lemelin playfully introduces frailties and celebrates individual victories in making this family endearing. For example, the matriarch of the large family, Mme. Plouffe, a sixty-year-old robust housewife, absurdly compares her uninspiring life with that of legendary heroine Joan of Arc. In fact, every challenge, no matter how minute, overwhelms her. Both she and her husband, Théophile, intensely dislike the English, and much of their humorous political commentary and not-so-humorous conflicts evolve from their prejudices. Théophile dislikes the English so much he avidly roots for the Germans to defeat \"les Anglais\" during World War II. Lemelin leaves no family member unscathed as he plays with the peculiarities and insufficiencies of the Ploufife children, ranging from the youngest at nineteen to the oldest daughter who struggles as a middle-aged spinster.\n\nRoger Lemelin wrote two more novels and a variety of short stories, essays, and news articles. He returned from virtual hibernation in 1982, reintroducing the Plouffe family with Le crime d'Ovide Plouffe. Though his comedy was still strong, his novel writing evolved little over twenty-plus years. Still, the public was pleased to welcome back the Plouffes. In 1981, Lemelin collaborated with Gilles Carle to produce a screenplay based on Les Plouffe, and the family also enjoyed a run as the basis for a series on radio and television."
