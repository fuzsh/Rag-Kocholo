        "text": "11 Canadian Francophone Writings: Focus on Novel\n\nMr. Rindon Kundu\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrench-Canadian Novel Before 1837\n\nFrench-Canadian Literature from 1837 to 1900\n\nFrench-Canadian Literature from 1900 to 1948\n\nFrench-Canadian Literature from 1948 to 1968\n\nFrench-Canadian Literature from 1968 to present\n\nSummary\n\nThe year 1837 is important because of the famous historical event, the Rebellion of 1837. Following this there were two other major events that shaped the Québec consciousness – the Canada Act of 1840 and the British North American Act of 1867. But apart from these two other major events like, making of constitution and construction of railroads have not influenced the Québec literature. Around 1840s Francophone Canadian literature distanced itself from the mainstream Canadian literature and restricted itself within the bounds of Québec.7 These French-Canadians defined themselves a separate entity from both the British Canadians as well as the French of France.8 At that time very little fictions started to be published in newspaper columns. Stories of folklores, legends, oral tradition, ghosts, adventures etc started to appear in print mediums i.e., in the newspaper L’Ami du people, Georges Boucher de Boucherville published a short story, titled “La Tour de Trafalgar” [Trafalgar Tower] 1835, grotesquely quixotic, concerning a uncanny adventure on a tempestuous Montreal night.\n\nIn the year 1837, a French-Canadian writer Phillipe-Ignace François Aubert du Gaspé wrote a novel titled L’Influence d’un livre (The Influence of a Book). Although the book was not well received initially, it has come to be recognized as a major landmark in terms of Canadian literature especially Francophone Canadian Literature. It is the story of Charles Amand’s pursuit for gold. Between alchemy, the courtship of his daughter Amélie, the legend of Rose Latulipe and the assassination of the peddler Guilmette, there is a sardonic premise intended for spiritual dearth in Québec. The author himself wrote in the preface of the novel, “I offer to my country the first novel of Canadian life. The pure ways of life of our countryside are a vast mine to explore; perhaps I will have given birth, in some of my fellow citizens abler than am I, to the desire to enrich this country.” Though the author claims that this novel has been written after Balzac’s realism, the plot has nothing of that sort and it also lacks structure and verisimilitude. In 1840 Joseph Doutre wrote Les Fiancés de 1812 (The Fiancés of 1812), an adventure fiction which deals with the social issues like family, immigration but the book is condemned and considered immoral by the Catholic clergy. Critics have accused that his novel is rather poorly constructed, poorly written and poorly edited. Patrice Lacombe wrote a novel titled La Terre paternelle (published in 1846) which was more simple and realistic and voiced for the farmer’s right. Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau’s novel Charles Guérin (published in 1847) portraits young Québécois in the 1820s, who were disgusted with the rule of the English, and hungry for establishing autonomous society in the Eastern Townships. The style is very high, as is the language of the main characters. However, the author regularly speaks “inhabitants” with the local language, sometimes explaining certain expressions or deformations of popular words. Antoine Gérin-Lajoie novel in two parts: Jean Rivard le défricheur (Jean Rivard the Pioneer, 1862) and Jean Rivard l’économiste (Jean Rivard the Economist, 1864) depicts the overpopulation and lack of job opportunities for the new generation of French-Canadians. While the first draws a romantic, optimistic futurist vision and nostalgia for an idealised past as well as a glorified picture of French-English clashes in New France; the second tells an economic reality of the present day. There are a few novels that falls under the genre of “historical novel” like L’Intendant Bigot by Joseph Marmette and Thomas Chapais’s Le Marquis de Montcalm. Critics have commented that the trend of the French-Canadian fiction around the middle of the Nineteenth century was intransigent, conformist and utterly idealistic, historical and the urban life was completely absent whereas Québec was slowly transforming towards metro society.\n\nCritics have compartmentalized pre-1837 period as ‘pre-literary’, 19th C is an ‘affirmation of literary identity’, 20th C is the maturity period of Francophone Canadian literature. As nineteenth century French-Canadian literature has been seen as reactionary for its overdependence on idealism and romanticism, twentieth century French-Canadian literature is utterly cosmopolitan as Québec was becoming rapidly urbanized.13 At this outset, a group of poets formed L’École littéraire de Montréal (The Montreal Literary School) to meet and read their verse. Despite the rise of French-Canadian poetry, the twentieth century French- Canadian literature was marked by fiction, especially novel. It has seen in every corner of the world that the rise of novel is directly proportionate to the growth of the middle class and the same happened at Québec also. With this there was an increase of readership and the Catholic Church has started to influence the development of novel a great deal.\n\nLouis Hémon, a Frenchman who came to Québec, is the first author who has created a true picture of the Canadian countryside. His novel Maria Chapdelaine (1914) became hugely popular in international market. The theme of the novel is deeply regionalist, portraying a peasant literature depicting rural life. This novel has a major influence on Félix-Antoine Savard, a renowned Canadian folklorist, who has explored Charlevoix countryside and it became the setting of his most polular novel titled, Menaud, maître-draveur [Master of the River] (1937), a hallmark of Québec literature till date. Both Maria Chapdelaine and Menaud maître-draveur were immensely successful not only in terms of monetary but set an example of describing countryside, everyday life in village and picturesque setting. Claude-Henri Grignon, a contemporary novelist has declared, which can be seen as the manifesto of the time, “Notre culture sera absolument paysanne ou elle ne sera pas.” (“Ours will be an absolutely peasant culture, or it will not be.”).15 His novel La Scouine [The Scouine] (1918) painted an explicit image of rustic, pastoral lifestyle. Ringuet, the pseudonym for Philippe Panneton, another contemporary, maps out in his novel Trente arpents [Thirty Acres] (1938) the transformation of life of a French-Canadian native from rural richness to urban adversity in a New England milltown.16 Germaine Guèvremont, one of the prominent women writers of early twentieth century, published in 1945 her novel titled Le Survenant (The Outlander) which gives a balanced depiction of peasant life. The sequel titled Marie-Didace also explored marriage and the hardships of life in rural Québec, the death of loved ones and the comforts of religion and the formidable and sometimes terrifying power of nature.\n\n7. Summary\n\nIn conclusion, it could be argued that, modern Québec literature is a vibrant, diverse, innovative, experimental, creative literary corpus. We have dealt with the political, social and economical changes in Québec and informed the readers about the storytellers, writers and the cultural history of French-Canada. Finally, we have traced the development of French- Canadian literature with special focus on novel categorizing them in the blocks of time as they evolved.\n\nyou can view video on Canadian Francophone Writings: Focus on Novel\n\nReferences:"
