        "text": "An Island of Many Names\n\nLong before the arrival of Europeans, Île-d'Orléans (“Orleans Island”) was inhabited by indigenous peoples. The Wendat people called it Ahȣendoe, meaning \"island,\" or Laȣendaona Tiatoutarchi, meaning either \"island in the big river,\" \"hidden island\" or \"escape island\" (depending on the source). The Hurons called the island Minigo and the Algonquins called it Windigo, meaning \"bewitched.\"\n\nFrench explorer Jacques Cartier encountered the island and its inhabitants in 1535, during his second voyage to the New World. Accompanied by two indigenous interpreters, Cartier was welcomed by the inhabitants and was gifted fish, millet and melons. At the time, he called it Isle de Bascuz (Bacchus) because of the abundance of grape vines he saw there. Less than a year later, however, he referred to the island as Île-d'Orléans, in honour of Henri II of France, then Duke of Orleans.\n\nThe Hurons called the island Île-Sainte-Marie starting in 1651; that name was abandoned with their departure in 1656.\n\nIn 1675, the seigneurie on the island was ceded to François Berthelot under the name \"Île et comté de Saint-Laurent\" (island and county of Saint-Laurent). Called alternatively Île-d'Orléans and Île-Saint-Laurent, the latter name fell out of usage as of 1770.\n\nA New Home for European Settlers\n\nÎle-d'Orléans is fairly flat and shaped like an oblong, measuring 34 kilometres long and 8 kilometres wide at its broadest. Due to its geographic position just downstream from Québec City and its fertile soil, the island was one of the first areas to be settled in New France. A seigneurie covering the entire island was established in 1636. It was granted to eight partners by the Compagnie de la Nouvelle France. In typical seigniorial fashion, plots of land were laid out in long narrow strips, going from the edge of the St. Lawrence River to the middle of the island (evidence of this pattern can still be seen today). Settlers started to arrive in 1650 and soon some 2,000 inhabitants called the island home. Land clearing began in 1660.\n\nChased out of their previous territory (the Mission at Huronia) by the Haudenosaunee (then called the Iroquois), the Hurons sought refuge around Québec City and on Île-d'Orléans with the help of missionaries in 1651. Some 400 Hurons settled on the southwestern tip of the island (present-day Anse du Fort), where they constructed a fort guarded by cannons, and renamed the island Île-Sainte-Marie, in honour of their patron saint. They purchased land from Eléonore de Grandmaison, upon which they built cabins and planted corn crops. Unfortunately, their tranquil existence soon came to an end. The Iroquois tracked down the Hurons to their new home in 1654 and, under the guise of peace talks, arranged for several meetings with them and Governor d'Ailleboust. Negotiations took place over the next two years before peace was finally shattered in 1656. On the night of April 19th, under the cover of darkness, the Iroquois attacked the Hurons as they tended to their crops. Seventy-one Hurons were slaughtered or taken prisoner.\n\nThe next day, the Iroquois boldly paraded the prisoners at Québec. The governor chose not to intervene, as he didn't want to compromise the fate of the colony. Despite this massacre, the Hurons who remained on the island continued to negotiate with the Iroquois, who promised to spare them if they accepted to live among them. The majority of the Hurons left the island accompanied by the Iroquois, and the men were predictably murdered soon after. The women and children were spared, only to be distributed amongst the Iroquois as slaves. The handful of Hurons who were left on Île-d'Orléans eventually moved closer to Québec City.\n\nThe Iroquois didn't focus their aggression solely on rival indigenous nations, however. In 1661, they launched several attacks against French settlements, starting at Montréal, followed by Trois-Rivières, Tadoussac, Beaupré and Île-d'Orléans. Dozens of colonists from the island were either murdered or captured. The governor sent reinforcements from Québec, but they arrived too late. Nine-year-old Anne Baillargeon was one of the captives. She lived among the Iroquois for nine years. After Monsieur de Tracy negotiated the return of all French captives from the Iroquois, Anne reluctantly returned, even trying to escape and return to Iroquois country on one occasion. She was brought to the Ursuline nuns in order to “strengthen her Christian spirit.”\n\nPoitou, Normandy & Perche Roots\n\nBetween 1660 and 1670, many more land concessions were granted. Many of these settlers, mostly from Poitou, Perche and Normandy, had large families and are therefore the ancestors of many French Canadians. They include Jacques Asseline, Jean Baillargeon, Emery Bellouin (Blouin) dit Laviolette, Charles Allaire, Abel Turcot, Mathurin Chabot, Joseph Bonneau, David Estourneau (Létourneau), René Emond, Grégoire De Blois, Nicolas Godbout, Louis Martineau, François Marceau, Germain Lepage, Nicolas Odet dit Lapointe, Jacques Paradis, François Noël, Jean Prémon and Gabriel Royer.\n\nAs of 1666, Île-d'Orléans was inhabited from one end to the other. According to a census conducted that year, the population was 471, making it one of the most populated areas of New France. The island was divided into five main areas, which eventually became parishes: Sainte-Famille (founded in 1661), Saint-Pierre, Saint-François, Saint-Jean (all founded in 1679) and Saint-Laurent (founded in 1698). A sixth parish, Sainte-Pétronille, was founded in 1870. The island's first European inhabitants had to quickly adapt to the weather, new methods of building, and new methods of farming. A mill wasn't constructed until 1667, which meant that residents had to travel to Beaupré to grind their grain.\n\nThe 1681 census enumerated 1,080 people living on the island. By the end of the 17th century, there were as many people living on Île-d'Orléans as there were in Québec City. The island flourished thanks to a thriving agricultural sector. Though self-sufficient at first, the inhabitants eventually started selling their grain crops and fruit in neighbouring Québec. They grew wheat, oats, rye, potatoes, peas and tobacco, and even made high-quality cheese. Fishing was also an important trade: the St. Lawrence river was full of eels, salmon, sturgeon, muskellunge, sea bass and walleye. Inhabitants also hunted pigeons, geese and ducks.\n\nThe residents of Île-d'Orléans lived mostly in isolation. Island families intermarried and land was passed down from father to sons. This reality meant that traditions were passed down as well, contributing to the maintenance of ancient customs. In the latter half of the 17th century, the iconic house of Île-d'Orléans was born, with its triangular roof, its opening toward the sunlight and its south-facing orientation.\n\nThe English Conquest\n\nÎle-d'Orléans was one of the most devastated areas during the war of 1759. When the French learned that English ships were making their way up the St. Lawrence in May, all residents of Île-aux-Coudres and Île-d'Orléans were ordered to evacuate and relocate to Charlesbourg. They were forced to leave their homes, farm animals and crops. Many were ill prepared and hadn't brought enough food to sustain their families. Many died in the chaos. French troops attempted to fortify the island and prevent the English from disembarking but soon realized they were greatly outnumbered. They abandoned Île-d'Orléans in July and retreated to Beauport. As they feared, British ships soon landed on the island and General Wolfe made it his headquarters while he planned his attack. The southwestern tip of Île-d'Orléans offered the perfect vantage point to observe the military activity at Québec. On June 30th, British troops stationed themselves at Pointe-Lévis, across the water from Québec, and bombarded the town. On July 31st, they moved to L'Ange-Gardien and launched another attack on the French at Montmorency. The French troops were well prepared, however, and defeated the British, who retreated to Île-d'Orléans.\n\nFurious, Wolfe ordered the destruction of all villages in the countryside. Homes were gutted and burned, and Île-d'Orléans was not spared. Over 1,400 homes were pillaged, then destroyed. One of the few buildings left standing was the seignorial manor. A museum today, the Manoir Mauvide-Genest, was the home of naval surgeon Jean Mauvide. He had just purchased half of the island's seigneurie when the Seven Years' War erupted. Forced to flee with the rest of the inhabitants, he joined the French troops on the other side of the river. Working as a surgeon on the battlefield, he likely witnessed the destruction and fires on Île-d'Orléans. On the walls of his manor, located at Saint-Jean-de-l’Île-d’Orléans, traces of cannonballs are still visible today. Another building that survived the war was the Drouin house, built circa 1730, which also stands today (both are pictured below).\n\nA large shipbuilding construction site once existed at l'Anse du Fort. In 1824 and 1825, the ships Columbus and Baron of Renfrew, said to be the largest wooden ships built in the 19th century, were constructed for a Scottish merchant company. They were purposely built quite poorly, as the intent was to take them apart as soon as they docked in Europe so the owners could avoid paying duties on wood. Predictably, the ships did not fare well. After successfully crossing the ocean, the Columbus failed to make it back to North America, probably lost at sea. The Baron of Renfrew sustained major damage on the banks of the Thames and was deemed beyond repair.\n\nThe oldest and most populous of the parishes, Sainte-Famille is located on the north of Île-d'Orléans. The first entry to the parish's records is the 1666 baptism of Barthélémy Landry, son of Guillaume Landry and Gabrielle Barré. Until 1679, there existed only one set of parish books for the entire island. Sainte-Famille is first mentioned by name in a 1671 burial record; Saint-Pierre, Saint-Paul (Saint-Laurent) and Saint-Jean are first mentioned in 1675. The division of the island into parishes probably occurred at this time. Sainte-Famille's first church was erected in 1671. The construction of the existing church started in 1745 and was consecrated four years later.\n\nIn 1861, 888 people lived in the parish, most farming hay and raising cattle.\n\nSaint-Jean-de-l’Île-d’Orléans\n\nThe parish of Saint-Jean is located on the southern shores of the island. Construction began on the first parish church circa 1675, but as at 1683 it was still not completed. The start of construction on the current church is said to date from about 1735. It is the largest of the parish churches. In 1861, the village had a population of 1,433. Similar to Saint-Pierre, most heads of households were farmers. The rest were navigators and artisans. Saint-Jean was known for producing navigators, sailors and pilots. In 1830, the first school was established in the parish. In 1858, the village commissioned the building of a quay for the use of its residents. A steamboat service was established, with crossings three times per week."
