        "text": "Providence’s Wilbury Theatre Group has never avoided doing the controversial. Rhode Island Public Radio’s Bill Gale says their current play, “Straight White Men” definitely fits into that catalog.\n\nWant to see a play about the opportunities of white males in the U.S.A? Want to see the guys in middle age parade their power and their dopiness? Want to see them say nicely that they live lives that are aimed at doing well—for themselves, of course. And all the time see how they hide under an umbrella of living a helpful, moral life?\n\nWell then, hop on over to the Wilbury Group’s Broad Street performing place and have an hour and a half’s worth of power and pokiness, of raunchy humor and weeping, of a family loving and hating all at once. The play’s title is, you guessed it, “Straight White Men.”\n\nWritten by Young Jean Lee a middle-aged Korean-born woman who was brought to the U.S. at age two and is now the darling of the far out theater scene, “Straight White Men” is at once loud and argumentative, quiet and meaningful, filled with rough language and ever rougher happenings. It needs work, but an idea is there.\n\nIt begins when you arrive and are attacked with loud, raucous blasting hip-hop music, favored, if that’s the term, by raunchy lyrics sung by women. When that finally ends (yes, I was annoyed by it all, just what playwright Lee wanted) in walk three middle-aged guys and their their not-so-dear old Dad.\n\nIt’s Christmas Eve and the four, all either never married, divorced or widowed, have come together to “celebrate.” This immediately turns into a boy’s riot. The lads laugh and fight, find ways to dig at each other and, occasionally, show affection. The booze is freely enjoyed, it goes without saying.\n\nIn comes Dad, with the fake Christmas tree complete with lights that only work on half the branches, an appropriate posture without doubt.\n\nAt this point, Ms. Lee’s script seems to be a false premise. The riotous fighting and goofing around, the eating of Chinese takeout direct from the boxes, has become both over-bold and boring. “Straight White Men” seems headed for the “forgetaboutit” list.\n\nThe playwright has said she she first came up with the play by meeting with women, gay people and minorities and asking them what they thought about straight white men. They told her: they just wanted the guys to go away and leave them alone.\n\nAnd, in truth, much of this play meets that criteria. It is often both dull and overdone. Director Vince Petronio and actors Roger Lemelin, Gunner Manchester, David Rabinow, Josh Short and Daraja Hinds strive to make the work, well, work. But, really it is a good idea that is only a beginning as a play.\n\n“Straight White Men” certainly is worth looking into as the United States moves toward being a nation of color. It needs refinement, though, better choices of what is good and true, and what isn’t. Call it a work in progress. It’s an idea on the right trail, but with a way to go.\n\nStraight White Men continues at The Wilbury Group through December 22nd. It runs in rotation with “Die and Viv and Rose, a play concerning three women.” Bill Gale reviews the performing arts for Rhode Island Public Radio."
