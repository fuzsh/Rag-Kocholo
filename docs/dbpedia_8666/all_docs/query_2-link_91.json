        "text": "February's Millenium souvenir sheets continue the tribute to the wide range of Canadian people, events and institutions that have helped shape our nation. This third release - the second last in the series - presents such individuals as philosopher Northrop Frye and \"Plouffe Family\" author Roger Lemelin and celebrates the spirit and vision of Canadian philanthropy. Aboriginal contributions to peace, healing and sport are featured, as well as Canada's proud heritage in the theatre and popular literature.\n\nW.O. Mitchell is one of Canada's most celebrated writers. The Saskatchewan-born novelist and dramatist's carefully crafted prose - which include the classical Who Has Seen the Wind - reveal a gifted artist intrigued by the human experience."
