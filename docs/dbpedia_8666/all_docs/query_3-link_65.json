Such documents must be officially certified by a lawyer or notary. For example:\n\na declaration of celibacy;\n\na consent letter for children travelling abroad;\n\na baptismal certificate;\n\na power of attorney.\n\nYou must make sure that the notarized document and lawyer or notary’s official certificate are accompanied by a signature authentication issued by the professional association. Contact the Chambre des notaires du Québec or the Barreau du Québec .\n\nIMPORTANT: Québec does not issue apostilles for documents issued by a federal authority, a territory or another province. For more information, visit the Global Affairs Canada website.\n\nLanguage of documents\n\nA document written in a language other than French or English must be the subject of an official certificate produced by a lawyer or notary stating that they understand the document’s contents or that they have obtained a translation of the document made by a translator who is a member of the Ordre des traducteurs, terminologues et interprètes agréés du Québec (OTTIAQ).\n\nDocument translated into a language other than French or English at the request of the recipient country: Depending on the requirements of the recipient country, your apostille request may be for the document only, or for the document and its translation.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe recipient country requires a translation of your birth certificate, but only needs the certificate to be apostilled, not the translation. In this case, you will only need to request an apostille for one document, the birth certificate.\n\nThe recipient country requires that both your birth certificate and its translation be apostilled. In this case, you will need to request an apostille for both the birth certificate and the translation. The translation must be the subject of an official certificate by a lawyer or notary.\n\nYou must obtain the document from the body authorized to issue it.\n\nExamples of documents that can be authenticated and the bodies that issue them:\n\nDirecteur de l’état civil:\n\nBirth certificate\n\nMarriage certificate\n\nDeath certificate\n\nPersonal name change certificate\n\netc.\n\nYou must provide documents that have been issued within the last 5 years.\n\nRequest a certificate or a copy of an act\n\nRegistraire des entreprises du Québec:\n\nCertificate of regularity\n\nCompany name change certificate\n\nMerger certificate\n\netc.\n\nRequest a copy of a document or a Certificat d’attestation from the Registraire des Entreprises\n\nMinistère de l’Éducation du Québec:\n\nSecondary school diploma\n\nDiploma of Vocational Studies\n\netc.\n\nRequest a transcript or a certification document\n\nTranscript of grades and confirmation of school attendance (elementary or secondary):\n\nThe document must be requested from the school.\n\nYou can request an apostille for a document issued by a public or private educational institution recognized by the Ministère de l’Éducation.\n\nMinistère de l’Enseignement supérieur:\n\nDiploma of College Studies (DCS)\n\nRequest a certification of Diploma of College Studies awarded\n\nTranscript of college grades:\n\nThis must be requested from the college.\n\nYou can request an apostille for a document issued by a public or private college. If your document is issued by a private college that is non-subsidized or not recognized by the Ministère de l’Enseignement supérieur, it must be accompanied by a lawyer or notary’s official certificate.\n\nUniversity degree or certificate:\n\nThis must be requested from the university.\n\nChambre des notaires:\n\nWill search certificate\n\nProtection mandate search\n\netc.\n\nNotarial documents:\n\nMarriage contract\n\nLast will and testament\n\nSales contract\n\nHypothec on an immovable property\n\nGift\n\netc.\n\nThis must be requested from the notary who produced the original act. You must also obtain an authenticity certificate from the Chambre des notaires.\n\nLet’s say, for example, you need to have your marriage contract authenticated. First, get a certified true copy from the notary who produced the contract. Then obtain an authenticity certificate from the Chambre des notaires to certify that the notary is a member and signed the document.\n\nBarreau du Québec:\n\nAttestation of studies from the École du Barreau\n\nWill search certificate\n\nProtection mandate search\n\netc.\n\nVerifying the status of a lawyer\n\nMinistère de la Justice du Québec:\n\nA Court of Québec ruling\n\nA Superior Court ruling\n\nA Court of Appeal ruling\n\nDivorce certificate\n\netc.\n\nYou must contact the clerk’s office in the district where the ruling was handed down. If your recipient country requires a certificate of non-appeal along with the ruling, both documents will be attached and submitted as a single request for apostille.\n\nCertificate from the Register of personal and movable real rights\n\nContact the Registre des droits personnels et réels mobiliers (RDPRM)\n\nPolice documents:\n\nPolice verification for civil purposes (previously a certificate of good conduct)\n\nYou may request this from the police station in the municipality where the person named in the verification resides. If the municipality doesn’t offer this service, you may contact a firm certified by the RCMP.\n\nPolice record check – Sûreté du Québec\n\nYou must contact Global Affairs Canada if the document is issued by the RCMP.\n\nThe document must be accompanied by a lawyer or notary’s official certificate if it is issued by a private firm.\n\nOther documents:\n\nFor documents not listed above, refer to the apostille request form or contact customer service ."
