        "text": "The menu of Le Bastogne in the earliest years, 1951-1955, reflected, as did the décor, both Flemish and French influences. One press account is notable for its extended coverage and photo-illustrations, in La Revue Populaire, February 1953.\n\nThe article profiled Le Bastogne and other fashionable resorts in Quebec City. As described, they were mainly French-oriented, but also included an Italian restaurant, Marino, and a Chinese one, Nanking. At the latter a Laval University law student, Louise Galipeault, was pictured having tea with another student, Maria Phan Ti Tu from Vietnam.\n\nThe article is “Il N’est De Bon Bec Que De Quebec” by Madelaine T. Saint-Hilaire. The title means roughly, “The best eating is found in Quebec”. It was meant in playful reference to France as true lodestone of fine food. A guest is pictured from Paris, Hélène Robert, who said her meal at Bastogne could not be bettered in France – the ultimate accolade for a Quebec restaurant at the time.\n\nIn one picture appeared a young Roger Lemelin, the famous Quebec novelist, journalist, screenwriter, businessman. He was part of a group called “Les Vendredistes”, the Friday Klatch as it were, which met at a good local restaurant to jabber and divert themselves.\n\nLemelin was quoted on his food preferences – anything seafood – and drink, somewhat surprisingly here, “the good beer of Labatt”. As a chronicler of Quebec’s working people perhaps he was asserting class credentials, but the tone of the article suggests he might have had a sponsorship deal.*\n\nThe Belgian side of Le Bastogne’s menu from my review was still classical-type, illustrated by its signature dish kidneys flambéed in brandy (rognons à la liégeoise). Carbonades à la flamande, which it likely offered as well, similarly. The Flemish influence seems mainly to have been in décor and even there for the first incarnation of the restaurant, until 1955. The checked curtains and perhaps lamps and fireplace shown in the picture suggest a Flemish touch.\n\nOther Bastogne dishes mentioned were entrecôte chasseur, which took four hours to prepare, and a macedoine of fruits flavoured with Grand Marnier. Further noted was its filter-coffee made to order for each patron in a silver three-piece unit.\n\nThe Montreal Gazette account mentioned earlier cited caneton à l’orange, duckling in orange sauce, as emblematic of French restaurants in Quebec City. All these dishes are today perhaps stereotypical conceptions of French food, but made a sensation in 1950s Canada, including French Canada.\n\nThe Gazette writer contrasted the style of these restaurants (which could vary from chic to European rustic) with “stainless steel” American-style restaurants which had spread in Quebec as everywhere in North America.\n\nIn the Quebec context this “European” counter-reaction was especially admired for its re-assertion of francophone values, for standing against, that is, American, and therefore English-speaking, influence.\n\nLe Bastogne as pictured was the first location, 22 rue Couillard in a Vieux Quebec of old Norman acrhitecture and narrow streets. In 1955 Henderson & de Locht moved their establishment to much larger and more soigné premises adjoining the hotel-motel Des Laurentides outside the city, as mentioned earlier.\n\nThe French focus in cuisine continued, however, through the 1960s. In 1957 La Chaumière restaurant opened in the Couillard Street building formerly occupied by Le Bastogne. It too advertised French and Belgian food. It too continued for many years in business.\n\nSee its advert in Le Soleil, June 22, 1957, touting steak with wine merchant’s sauce, crêpes Suzette, lobster Bordeaux-style and sabayon, dishes probably of a piece with Bastogne’s gastronomy.\n\nWhether Henderson or de Locht was involved is unclear, but our focus remains Bastogne and Henderson’s role therein. I will add, it seems possible that from 1957 de Locht ran la Chaumière while Henderson had charge of Bastogne.\n\nCont’d. in Part III.\n\n…\n\n*Lemelin proved as much astute businessman as popular author, the result it seems of early business studies under Christian Fathers. He died at 72, victim of a lifelong smoking habit.\n\n**Our interpretation.\n\n© 2015-2024 Copyright of Gary M. Gillman. All Rights Reserved.

He was in his early 30s, having decided to emigrate to Quebec where he had heard there was a dearth of trained chefs.\n\nHenderson had studied at a hotel school in Liège, emerging after two years with “five hundred francs worth of knives”. From there he carved out, we can say, a Belgian career in haute cuisine, at one point serving as private chef for royalty including the Prince of Romania.\n\nAfter the war, he saw opportunities as mentioned overseas, and headed to French Canada where of course his French skills would assist him. Quite possibly he spoke English, after all he had a rather un-French, un-Flemish name. Henderson descended from a Scot who had soldiered at Waterloo and settled in Belgium.\n\nIt was an odd parallel to Quebec, in that numerous Scots and other Britons had settled in Quebec Province after 1759, when General Wolfe defeated General Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham. For this reason, among others, many French-speaking Quebec families have British or Irish surnames.\n\nPerhaps it is this background that impelled journalist Léa Pétrin, who profiled Henderson in 1957 in Quebec’s Le Soleil, to omit any explanation of his English surname. Other press accounts did explain it though, which is how I know.\n\nIn May 1951 Henderson opened the restaurant Le Bastogne (L’événement-journal, May 26, p. 5). That name is not explained either, maybe its resonance from the late war explained the choice. Henderson had a partner, another Belgian with a Flemish name this time, Louis de Locht.\n\nThey focused on French classic cuisine with some Belgian dishes, and the restaurant became a hit. One press account (Montreal Gazette, 1955) related that in the early days arrivals would request “hamburgers and beer”. Henderson asked them politely to leave, confiding to the journalist the “vulgarity”. This account by the way described him as “Charles Henderson”, an error as numerous accounts and in French, call him Fernand Henderson.\n\nLe Bastogne initially occupied a stone building in Quebec City’s Latin quarter. It later moved to a motel-hotel, as a certain type of accomodation was then termed, Des Laurentides, located in Beauport outside the city. There he was able to establish more expansive dining rooms overlooking the scenic St. Lawrence River.\n\nHenderson and de Locht worked hard, as all successful restaurateurs must. Le Bastogne became a destination for gourmets, powers-that-be (Quebec is a government town), tourists, and an in-crowd generally.\n\nIt may sound odd again that a French restaurant was novel in Quebec, but prior to the 1920s Quebec did not feature this genre of eating, not in any systematic way. Scholars of Quebec gastronomic history have identified different stages including early French arrivals and their rustic and old aristocratic cuisines, British influence from 1760, pervasive Americanisation, the plethora of ethnic cuisines: Italian, Jewish, Asian, etc., and formation of a distinct Quebec culinary culture.*\n\nTo be sure a Quebec home cuisine existed and still does, e.g., tourtière, cretons, ci-paille, bouillie, sugar pie, but in the 1950s these were not considered suitable for restaurant presentation.\n\nClassic French eating took its place in the chronology starting from the 1920s. Le Bastogne joined a small group of elect restaurants in Quebec City and Montreal specialising in this style. The main restaurant at Quebec City’s historic Chateau Frontenac Hotel was among these.**\n\nLe Bastogne is shown gleaming in the 1960s in a postcard listing at eBay. Other views can be found on auction sites, a testament to the many Americans who sampled its cuisine in the 1950s and ’60s.\n\nBy 1970 he appears to have sold the restaurant or his stake, as news ads in Quebec City, still vaunting his French classical skills, have him cooking at another establishment, the Auberge Neptune. Le Bastogne continued for some years yet but ceased to offer a classical French menu, by my review.\n\nHenderson died in 1976 at only 59. His obituary in Le Soleil (p. 15) pictured him in chef’s white toque, but did not otherwise refer to his restaurant career or significance he had in Quebec restaurant circles. Sad it is that so often in the wider community, an important figure in restaurant history is so soon forgotten. Anthony Bourdain made this point in a more general way in his justly lauded Kitchen Confidential.\n\nPétrin’s piece (1957) ends with a Henderson recipe for chicken Maryland. He had recalled serving the dish to the Romanian prince. I thought it unusual Henderson or Pétrin did not propose a classic French recipe, but perhaps Le Soleil had featured many of this type and was looking for a different angle to interest readers.\n\nThe recipe was still Escoffier’s, as Henderson told the journalist, so it had imprimatur in this sense, certainly. From Pétrin:\n\nLorsqu’il était à Bruxelles, monsieur Henderson avait pendant trois mois, eut charge de la préparation des repas du prince de Roumanie qui affectionnait particulièrement le poulet à la Maryland avec croquettes de maïs à la crème. Nous avons pensé, pour terminer ces propos de…vous donner la recette de ce poulet, une belle réussite d’Escoffier, digne d’un repas de . . . prince. Vous prenez un poulet de belle taille, et vous le découpez comme vous le faites quand vous le sautez. Vous assaisonnez les pièces de sel et de poivre. Vous passez ensuite les morceaux à la farine, puis à l’oeuf battu et à la mie de pain. Vous faites chauffer dans une poêle une bonne cuillérée de beurre, vous y rangez les morceaux de poulet que vous cuisez à feu doux pour obtenir qu’ils soient bien blondis sur les deux côtés. Vous dressez, ensuite sur un plat bien chaud, et vous disposez autour des beignets de maïs, des croquettes de pommes de terre, des tranches de bacon et des bananes frites au beurre. Vous pouvez accompagner d’une crème béchamel additionnée de raifort râpé ou d’une sauce tomate.\n\nPétrin noted in the article Henderson wanted to expand the range of personalized dishes offered at Le Bastogne. This showed he aspired to his own creative role in cookery, as all true chefs want. His suggestion was a steak sautéed with mushrooms, onions, white wine and tomato, à la Provençale, he said. And it does sound good. One hopes it finally reached the menu.\n\nUnusually at least two film records exist of the restaurant, one an amateur, short pan of the exterior, the other a professional, in-depth look. Both evoke their time perfectly. I will discuss these in a subsequent part.\n\nCont’d. in Part II.\n\n…\n\n*See e.g., the thesis (2020) “Histoire de la gastronomie québécoise: l’émergence d’une identité culinaire“, Priscilla Plamondon Lalancette, University of Quebec at Chicoutimi.\n\n**Generally credited as the first French gastronomic restauarant in Quebec City is Kerhulu, mentioned in numerous accounts cited in this series. Its menu from 1950, when Le Bastogne was in gestation, offers a snapshot of contemporary French dining in Quebec (eBay listing). Kerhulu deserves a separate look but from our review seems probably to have been the grandest mid-century French restaurant in Quebec City, known also for its pastry shop.\n\n© 2015-2024 Copyright of Gary M.

Ditto for what they later bottled as McSorley’s Ale.\n\nI could be wrong, of course. Maybe they brewed two ale streams, as the lingo goes in industrial brewing today – one for the Scotch Ale, one for McSorley’s Ale. Possibly even, the Scotch Ale adopted the Fidelio recipe, if that came along with the sale, it may not have of course, versus the brand name and associated goodwill.\n\nThe ultimate answer lies in a dusty archive somewhere, or old brewing journal. Maybe even at McSorley’s today they know, but this is old history…\n\nSo short of knowing the true answer, I’d infer the Liebmanns did what buyers of brands so often do: fill the new branded containers with their own similar brew. Why, also with America now embroiled in a second world war, would the Liebmanns go to the trouble of brewing another ale, with a different yeast?\n\nBreweries especially then were chary to introduce a foreign yeast in their environment. The true value of what they bought was the name and goodwill. To make real money on that they needed robust bottled sales. The war put a stop to that plan, by all evidence, although they did proceed with bottling after the war, in 1947.\n\nBy then I don’t think the environment was that encouraging. Into the 1930s one could market ales with a manifest British or old-fashioned American image. A good example results from the Indianapolis Times, December 24, 1934:\n\nBy the nifty, streamlined late ’40s and ’50s, this seems contrived, fusty, out of touch. It is not surprising the 1947 re-launch of Rheingold Scotch Ale had no lasting impact, from our examination.\n\nThey did try again as we saw in the late 1950s in the Scotch terrier ad. It was a good move, ahead of its time in many ways. Still though, little tangible result seems to have followed, even with a witty, updated approach.\n\nThe beer itself up to the time of James Robertson’s reviews seems to have been very good, a craft forerunner à la Ballantine India Pale Ale of New Jersey (originally), or Rainier Ale or the Anchor beers on the West Coast.\n\nMcSorley’s Ale, by the time modern beer writing caught up with it, was less intense (surely) than Fidelio’s product or the Liebmanns’ Scotch Ale whether Mark I or II.* So, it never got the “love” from craft historians as these others did, versus the tavern itself for its storied history and unique atmosphere.\n\nBear in mind during Prohibition the McSorley’s patrons drank something different again: strong home brew, at times mixed with near beer. So wrote Joseph Mitchell in his famous essay. Beer was important but McSorley’s was always bigger than just beer. The old boys at McSorley’s were hardly likely to complain the latest mugs slid down the bar were different. Maybe of course too, they were better.\n\nJames Robertson did write in 1978 that Rheingold Scotch Ale was “introduced” after the war using the McSorley’s recipe. Presumably he got the information from somewhere, but didn’t say where. And he may not have realized the Liebmanns had a Scotch Ale before World War II, with a history dating back to 1923; one can read his remarks that way.\n\nA few additional considerations. The Liebmanns had invested a lot of money in the 1920s Scotch Brew, and later Scotch Ale #1, later still Scotch Ale #2. I don’t think they would have thrown that away to adopt an ale with no previous connections to their brewery. While they could have made “two streams”, logic argued against that especially with a war on, as mentioned earlier.\n\nAlso, in 1947, when McSorley’s Ale was finally bottled, the Scotch Ale was discontinued. The reason given was limited bottle stock. But maybe another, or the real reason was the beer in both bottles would have been the same, and the market would have noticed. This goes against the two streams idea.\n\nSo we are back to Fidelio versus Liebmann’s Scotch Ale. At day’s end Occam’s razor suggests to me McSorley’s Ale from 1942 was Rheingold Scotch Ale. Especially with a captive market at McSorley’s Ale House, and beer being in high demand during the war, it was the path of least resistance.\n\nThe final answer lies out there somewhere.\n\nSeries concludes with Part VIII.\n\nNote: Image source is linked in the text.

As the draught at McSorley’s Ale House then, it was goodish but did not stand out as, say, Ballantine India Pale did, or the beers from Anchor Brewery in San Francisco.\n\n© 2015-2024 Copyright of Gary M.

First, what evidence is there the Liebmanns’ Scotch Ale was reformulated in 1936-1937, the same period their Rheingold Extra Dry Beer became the pale staple lager?\n\nSecond, when the Liebmanns bought the rights to produce McSorley’s Ale from New York’s Fidelio Brewery, by then renamed Greater New York Brewery, did they henceforth produce McSorley’s Ale with the Fidelio recipe, or their own Scotch Ale recipe?\n\nFidelio had made McSorley’s Ale for well-known McSorley’s Old Ale House on East 7th Avenue, and also bottled McSorley’s (1930s) for general sale.\n\nThe Day, April 13, 1935 advertised a number of beers from Fidelio including McSorley’s Heavy Cream Ale, and an Ale as such. The term heavy clearly meant McSorley’s Ale was stronger and bigger on palate than Fidelio’s regular, probably cream, ale. As it happens, next to this advert was a Liebmanns’ ad for Rheingold lager and the Scotch Ale.\n\nIn mid-1941, to be clear, a series of bottled beers bore the McSorley name. The Waterbury Democrat, May 27 that year advertised quite a range:\n\nI am concerned however with McSorley’s Ale, the basic product always associated with McSorley’s Old Ale House. I will lay out further references relevant to my two questions with minimal discussion, to be followed by a fuller commentary.\n\n“Exhibit” 1.\n\nAn ad of December 24, 1936 in the Miami Daily News (via Proquest) suggests the Liebmanns still made Scotch Ale under rights granted by James Aitken’s in Scotland:\n\nIt’s much less expensive to import the formula than import the ale itself. Scotch Thistle Brand Ale is made to an Old World Formula…\n\nThis is indirectly related to the second question, in my opinion.\n\n“Exhibit” 2.\n\nAn article in the same newspaper, November 11, 1936, stated that the “quality” of the Scotch Ale was “further improve[d]” when “a Scotch Ale brewmaster was engaged to perfect the formula”:\n\nOur reader Rob Sterowksi, who lives in Scotland, wrote this comment to our Part V post:\n\nThe Scottish ale expert might have been Archibald McKechnie who was head-hunted by Ballantine of Newark after the end of Prohibition to help reformulate their IPA. He never returned to the UK and died in New Jersey in 1940.\n\nHe may well be right in this.\n\n“Exhibits” 3, 4\n\nAn article of December 16, 1941 in New York Herald Tribune (via Proquest) announced the Liebmanns have taken over production of McSorley’s Ale. Note that Fidelio’s new persona, Greater New York Brewery, Inc., was a fusion of numerous breweries and continued to do business. (Its future course is beyond our scope here, and somewhat hazy, but some details appears from a Bay Bottles page).\n\nThe August 23, 1943 issue of Life magazine (Internet Archive) contains a sketch of McSorley’s during the war. Note especially the wood kegs delivered bv a truck bearing McSorley’s Cream Stock Ale livery, a name acquired by the Liebmanns in the sale. On the door of the truck is a sign for Rheingold beer. I can find no evidence that during the war the Liebmanns sold a branded Scotch Ale.\n\n“Exhibits” #4 and #5\n\nPer a 1948 issue of the journal Modern Packaging, McSorley’s Ale is now being bottled by the Liebmanns. The bottles depict the “trade character” of John McSorley, founder of McSorley’s Old Ale House, originally called the Old House at Home.\n\nFrom the February 24, 1947 New York Herald Tribune (via Proquest):\n\nIn fact Fidelio had used a similar image when bottling McSorley’s in the 1930s. Fidelio had “bought” the rights from McSorley’s in 1934, according to a famous essay on the tavern by Joseph Mitchell, collected in a 1943 volume.\n\nUntil this point, the Liebmanns made draught McSorley’s Ale. They had the right to bottle it, but did not until 1947. When they did, they stopped bottling their Scotch Ale, citing to the ad journal Tide (1947) that it would free bottles to bottle McSorley’s. Clearly a bottle shortage continued from the war. But was the assertion the whole story?\n\n“Exhibit” #6\n\nIn about the same period the Liebmanns released, as a new product, their Rheingold Ale, see e.g the impactful ad in the Meridien Record, March 15, 1949. So, by this time, the Scotch Ale is off the market at least in bottles. McSorley’s Ale is on the market in bottles (apparently still in 1949). Rheingold Ale is also on the market, clearly a different, lighter ale than the other two, probably an update of the 1930s Rheingold XXX Cream Ale I mentioned earlier.\n\n“Exhibit” #7\n\nMay 5, 1959, as advertised in The Day Rheingold re-launches its Scotch Ale (a “brawny brew and thrifty too”):\n\nThe bottled McSorley’s is now off the market, as far as I could tell.\n\n“Exhibit” #8\n\nA 1975 Village Voice article I discussed in a recent post stated McSorley’s Old Ale House dispensed “Rheingold Scotch Ale”. See also my comment to the post as follows, I was addressing our reader Arnold Moodenbaugh:\n\nThanks Arnold, very interesting. I am intrigued by the connections between McSorley’s Ale and Rheingold Scotch Ale. Jim Robertson’s 1984 The Connoisseur’s Guide to Beer states that:\n\n“In recent years, the brand [McSorley’s Cream Ale] was produced by Rheingold Breweries, Inc. until the acquisition of that firm by C. Schmidt & Sons, Inc., which sold the McSorley label to Ortlieb. In the post World War II period this brew was introduced as Rheingold Scotch Ale”.\n\nHe is saying McSorley Cream Ale was the recipe for Rheingold Scotch Ale. I think it was probably the reverse…Usually Robertson is very reliable but here I think he was erroneous…\n\nAs noted above I will offer soon further commentary, and specifically why I think it plausible the Liebmanns used their Scotch Ale recipe when henceforth making McSorley’s Ale.\n\nThe other possibilities are, the Liebmanns made two recipes, one for Scotch Ale, one for McSorley’s Ale, or as Robertson stated, the Scotch Ale adopted the Fidelio recipe.\n\n“Exhibit” #9\n\nJames D. Robertson reviewed bottled McSorley’s Ale as made by Liebmanns’/Rheingold Brewery before it closed (in 1976)*, in his 1978 The Great American Beer Book. He wrote, at p. 109:\n\nMcSorley Cream Ale – deep color, great malty hop aroma, full flavor without excessive bitterness, great balance. A fine ale.\n\nIn a later, 1984 book, The Connoisseur’s Guide to Beer, Robertson described the same beer as now made by Henry Ortlieb of Philadelphia. He wrote:\n\nMcSORLEY’S CREAM ALE—deep tawny brown color, tangy malty hop aroma, full-flavored, good balance, plenty of hops yet not overly bitter, a very fine ale at a reasonable price. Great with food. This brand was originally produced by the Fidelio Brewing Co. of New York City, founded in 1852, later by the Greater New York Brewing Co. (1939) for McSorley’s Ale House, an East Side New York pub that permitted only male patrons for over one hundred years. In recent years, the brand was produced by Rheingold Breweries, Inc. until the acquisition of that firm by C. Schmidt & Sons, Inc., which sold the McSorley label to Ortlieb. In the post World War II period this brew was introduced as Rheingold Scotch Ale.\n\nClearly “deep color” in the first review meant tawny brown. Arnold Moodenbaugh in our discussion felt Orltieb’s version and Rheingold’s were similar, I mean by his own taste recollection.\n\nSo these taste notes are very helpful, but what recipe did the beers descend from, the 1930s Liebmanns’ Scotch Ale #2 or Fidelio’s “wax-colored” ale as famously described by Joseph Mitchell?\n\n“Exhibit” #10\n\nAs general background, the McSorley’s Ale House website is always helpful, especially the history section, see here.**\n\n…\n\nThere is of course a plethora of writing on McSorley’s Ale House and McSorley’s Ale. I am familiar with a great deal of it, but as my inquiries are rather granular I limited my references to the above, and mainly my own research.\n\nContinued in Part VII.\n\nNote: Images sources are indicated in text. All intellectual property therein belongs solely to the lawful owner. Used for educational and research purposes. All feedback welcomed.\n\n…\n\n*January 1976 according to our research, but an associated plant in East Orange, NJ continued to produce Rheingold until 1980, see details here. That plant made the first beer James Robertson tasted discussed below, unless his taste notes predated 1976 (which is possible).\n\n*As this post swerves into some McSorley’s Ale House history, I take the opportunity to say it is a wonderful, evocative place, one of a kind is an understatement. I have been there many times. The current brews, a light and dark, are made by Pabst Brewery, by all reports. And while certainly enjoyable, I think most beer connoisseurs, at any rate, visit for the McSorley’s “experience”. Even in the heyday though, the beer rarely came in for comment in the general media. I have read dozens of accounts dating from 1919 and none inquire into the beer, apart mentioning usually it was “ale”, enough of a distinction at the time. Writer Joseph Mitchell was the first to inquire into its character and origins, as far as I have been able to tell.\n\n© 2015-2024 Copyright of Gary M. Gillman. All Rights Reserved.

Before Prohibition by my study, the Liebmanns did not market a Scotch Ale, or not so-termed.\n\nThe ad below is from the September 22, 1933 Plainfield Courier-News (via Proquest). (Women appeared regularly in the Liebmanns’, i.e., Rheingold’s ads from the 1930s on):\n\nFrom the December 20, 1933 Daily Boston Globe:\n\nA 1935 ad from a Liebmann distribution arm in New Jersey mentions the Scotch Ale along with a porter (The Daily Home News, March 24, 1935):\n\nThe ad states “Draught and Bottled”, so presumably some porter was bottled, although I can find no can or bottle stating “Rheingold Porter” or “Liebmann’s Porter”. If a reader knows of one feel free to comment.\n\nIn 1933 the Scotch Ale is termed Good Old Scotch Ale. Possibly this is what Scotland’s James Aitken & Co. licensed the Liebmanns in 1923, which they adapted for a near beer. The post-Repeal ads for their Scotch Ale do not mention James Aitken, but an ad December 24, 1936 in the Miami Daily News stated:\n\nIt’s much less expensive to import the formula than import the ale itself. Scotch Thistle Brand Ale is made to an Old World Formula…\n\nIn the mid-1930s and into the ’40s Liebmann’s Scotch Ale was sometimes termed Scotch Thistle Brand Ale.\n\nIn late 1936 and 1937 the Liebmanns apparently reformulated the Scotch Ale by engaging a Scottish ale expert (not named). I will give more information in the next Part.\n\nThe move occurred about the time Rainier Extra Dry was adopted, so possibly the Scotch Ale was lightened by a similar logic.* The ad below is from The Day, August 12, 1937, probably the new version is shown:\n\nFrom the Schenectady Gazette, September 9, 1938:\n\nHere we see a reference to the Scotch Ale being a “pale ale”. Interesting questions arise. Was the 1920s Liebmann Scotch Brew based on a James Aitken pale ale, or a dark one? Was the Rheingold Scotch Ale launched after Repeal in 1933 pale or dark? If dark, did this change in 1936-1937 when the Scotch Ale was reformulated?\n\nOne may note also in 1937 the Scotch Ale is advertised at height of a Northeast summer, which suggests it was not too rich or alcoholic. Taking all with all, and whatever the exact character of the 1933 and 1937 Scotch Ales, they had to be more impactful than Rheingold Extra Dry.\n\nIn part this is shown by the concurrent availability (1930s) of Rheingold XXX Cream Ale. See e.g., in the Lewiston Evening Journal, September 17, 1936. In other words, the Liebmann Scotch Ale(s) must have been “bigger” than the XXX Cream Ale and even more so than Rheingold Extra Dry.\n\nA reminder, this series does not purport to be an exhaustive brand history of Rheingold and other Liebmanns’ brands. It does however review significant episodes in that history, with a focus on less- or unexamined areas.\n\nNote: source of images are linked or stated in text.

For example, in the October 14, 1938 The Binghampton Press (via Fulton Newspapers), an ad featured both Rheingold Extra Dry Lager Beer and Rheingold Light Lager Beer, with Scotch Brand Ale being a third. The second beer was perhaps Rheingold Beer as released in 1933, itself the same or close to the pre-Prohibition Rheingold (pale) lager. It is possible dual Rheingold pale lagers were available into the late 1940s, when the photospread I mentioned earlier in a Will Anderson book was taken. I calculate that time from the number of “Miss Rheingolds” shown in as many cans on the left. The contest began about 1940. On the other hand, maybe the beer in both Rheingold cans was the same and the difference in branding, a matter of marketing. I incline to the former, though.\n\n© 2015-2024 Copyright of Gary M.

That would cover some ground, but I have not been able conveniently to obtain a copy.\n\nFor a good outline of Liebmann brewing and brand history, the Bay Bottles site is helpful, viz. an (uncredited) blog entry from 2016. The present and my next posts will focus on areas Bay Bottles does not address or in more depth, especially for Rheingold Scotch Ale.\n\nBay Bottles mentions a 1920s promotion for Scotch Brew, a non-alcohol product, but an (alcohol) Scotch Ale was also issued soon after Repeal, that claimed similarly a foreign lineage. Its future course had interesting twists, as I will discuss.\n\nFor a vue d’ensemble of Rheingold brands at mid-20th century, Will Anderson’s photo spread in another of his books, 1973’s The Beer Book: An Illustrated Guide to American Breweriana, is helpful, see p. 148. Pictured are Rheingold Extra Dry, Scotch Ale, Bock, Pale Double Bock, Export Lager, and Ale, all in cans.\n\nThere is also shown a Rheingold Beer. This was the name of the pale lager issued between 1933 and 1937, when a new lager was issued, Extra Dry.* On the matter of porter, I will return to this in a later post.\n\nBefore Prohibition, as Bay Bottles and other sources document, in addition to the standard Rheingold pale beer there was Teutonic Beer, formerly named Wuerzburger, also a present use ale, stock ale and porter. I found no examples of paper labels for the last three, so possibly they were draught-only unless issued in generic embossed bottles (before Prohibition).\n\nAlso, as noted by Bay Bottles and other sources Teutonic also came in a non-alcohol (“malt extract”) version, at least for a time.\n\nTherefore, the Liebmanns always made some characterful beer for the discerning drinker, if they cared to look for these. The main seller was always pale Rheingold beer, as noted called Extra Dry from 1937. Pale lager ensured the Liebmanns’ place among the major brewers of New York before and after Prohibition, but the family did offer other beers as well, a kind of caboose to the pale lager train that drove the business.\n\nThe 1920s Scotch Brew\n\nTo all appearances the Liebmanns did not field a scotch ale, or at least a beer by that name, before Prohibition. It seems they first decided to make a Scottish-type beverage during Prohibition, in 1923-1924, when ads first appear for Liebmanns’ Scotch Brew. Bay Bottles shows an ad featuring an endorsement from world-famous Scottish singer and comedian Harry Lauder.\n\nOther ads stated the Liebmanns obtained the formula for Scotch Brew from James Aitken & Co. of Falkirk, Scotland. Either Aitken’s licensed a non-alcohol malt drink, or a beer from their large range the Liebmanns turned into a near beer.\n\nThe ad below is from the July 28, 1924 New York Herald, New York Tribune (via Proquest):\n\nJames Aitken was a venerable Scottish brewer with a big export trade, which probably is how the Liebmanns learned of them. Aitken’s made a range of beers in numerous styles including pale ale. A sampling of Aitken’s 20th century brands is shown at the Brewery History site. See the page at Scottish Brewing Heritage for more information, especially regarding the export trade.\n\nWhat is especially interesting about the Liebmanns’ Scotch Ale released after Prohibition, which endured in the market into the 1970s, is that it had (direct) roots in a non-alcohol beer. Usually it’s the reverse, where a standard beer ends being supplemented by a N/A version, as termed today.\n\nThe next Part will look at the Scotch Ale Rheingold fielded by the Liebmanns in the 1930s, following Repeal. Two versions in fact, as I will discuss, were released before 1939.\n\nSeries continues in Part V.\n\nNote: Image source is indicated in text.

How would the beer scene look?\n\nIn earlier posts I discussed the broad range of imports available in large American cities in the 1950s-1970s. Here I consider an instance of select draft availability, domestic and imported beers, in a major market, New York, in 1975.\n\nAn article on July 15, 1975 in the Village Voice, by Howard Smith and Brian Van Der Horst, gives a good indication of the range and types of beers that might exist today, had craft never started.\n\n(If we set aside Anchor Brewery in San Francisco, the first modern craft brewery, New Albion, began in Sonoma Valley, California in 1976).\n\nThe survey’s value is enhanced in that numerous bars are represented, via a Manhattan pub crawl, in the era of KISS, and glitter, and rambling Catskill resorts, and all that.\n\nA few of the bars carry on, Heidelberg does in the old German section of Yorkville. The White Horse Tavern does, of Dylan Thomas fame.\n\nAnd of course McSorley’s Old Ale House on East 10th St. Note it offered a Rheingold Scotch Ale, and I will have more to say of this beer soon.\n\nBut all in all a pretty good survey, eh? True, no wheat beers or Trappist ale, but you could find that in bottled form in some retailers. A dedicated beer human could find much to enjoy in this panoply of pivo, speaking of pivo, there’s famous Pilsner Urquell on draft, at PRAHA (as spelled) uptown.\n\nSomeone should exhume that bar’s history. Czech-style bars were established in some other Western cities at that time, notably London.\n\nGerman bock, English Watney’s ale, Irish Guinness (bigger than ever today), Prior Double Dark, a Czech dark style but made in America, German Wurzburger and Dortmunder, etc. Toothsome.\n\nSome of the American drafts, in a period when American draft beer was unpasteurised, were probably excellent. I’d lay odds on Falstaff and Ballantine, especially.\n\nVery nice list. There was beer gourmandising then, and still today. Our choice is much larger, but they had it pretty good too. Not to mention the prices.\n\nYou wouldn’t have gone thirsty, or needed to glance at the budget before ordering another.\n\nNote: Image source is linked in text.

Mencken and beer concerns Labatt India Pale Ale. This is especially so since I have addressed parts of Labatt brewing history, particularly in Labatt and George Weatherall Smith, and I.P.A. in 1867 Canada, both from 2019.\n\nIn 1942 Mencken wrote a letter, reproduced in The Diary of H.L. Mencken (1989), recounting that a friend at Johns Hopkins University, German-born medical illustrator Max Brödel, was a dedicated homebrewer during Prohibition. He wrote Brödel had duplicated Labatt India Pale Ale by harvesting yeast from an empty bottle brought back from Canada.\n\nMencken clearly knew the Labatt’s beer. He had made several visits to Canada during Prohibition, in part to report on new liquor control systems that replaced earlier bans on liquor in some provinces.\n\nMencken wrote in his diary, February 5, 1942:\n\nAt the beginning of Prohibition I taught [Max] how to brew beer, and in a little while he was the best brewer in the club [Saturday Night Club, a meeting group of friends]. Once, coming home in his car from his place in Canada, he got a couple of empty bottles of Labatt’s famous ale across the border, and when he reached Baltimore cultivated yeast from the sludge still in them. From this yeast he made an ale that was identical with Labatt’s. Whenever he entertained the club he invited a few other guests, usually colleagues at the Johns Hopkins. More than once I have seen medical men of the highest eminence far gone at his table, for he believed that malt liquor that was too weak was not worth drinking.\n\nNow, it seems unlikely to me Labatt India Pale Ale was still bottle-conditioned (unfiltered) in the 1920s: there should have been no yeast in the bottle. But maybe there was, as these men of learned and homebrewing bent surely would not mistake on this point.\n\nAnother story of Mencken and Labatt involves Mencken more directly. Just after World War II he did a deal with a Canadian film production firm to adapt his famous bathtub story.\n\nAs compensation he was offered either a cash amount or a case per month – 12 quarts – of Labatt India Pale Ale for life. He took the beer. Betty Adler in her 1967 paper “Bibliographic Checklist“, published in the journal Menckeniana, included the following account, I believe from proceedings of a Mencken Society:\n\nFred Schmelz… gave us carefully preserved Labatt ale labels. What a story these labels recalled! On the 23d day of August, 1946, [H.L. Mencken] signed an agreement with Cinema (Canada) Pictures, Ltd., that in return for the movie rights to the bathtub hoax he would receive a case (12 quarts) of John Labatt ale every month for the rest of his life. Any possible disputes arising from said contract were to be arbitrated by Prince Mike Romanoff representing the Cinema, Donald Gordon, chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, for the brewery, while [Mencken] appointed the Governor of Maryland, “if he declines to serve or is insane then the Chief Justice of the United States.” [Mencken] suggested that the contract be adorned with poetical quotations and “if you decide to add illustrations then you must include a portrait of the late Bishop James Cannon, Jr., for long the commander-in-chief of the prohibitionists. Alas, he is now an angel in Heaven.” In April the first case arrived as a token option; back bounced an alarmed letter: “You are heading me for a long term in jail. There is a local law which forbids a citizen to import any foreign malt liquor without running it through a state wholesaler, and violations are punished with great ferocity.” That hurdle settled, the next shipment was ecstatically greeted: “One case has been enough to convert a despairing pessimist into the most roaring optimist since Harding.”\n\n(Full story in Montreal Standard, Feb. 1, 1947).\n\nRegarding Romanoff, see here. Mencken tended to deprecate English ales, as his German/Continental leanings predisposed him to good lager. In his (1919) collection Prejudices: a Selection, Mencken recalled enchanting drinking before Prohibition, wryly comparing ale and lager this way:\n\n….[there were] twenty or thirty Bass’ ale nights…. Five or six-hundred Pilsner nights….\n\nLabatt India Pale Ale seems to have been more to his liking. The Saturday Night Club probably would have given at least equal time to it with (Britain’s) Bass Pale Ale, except it wasn’t available in Baltimore, clearly.\n\nThe labels shown below are from a later period, probably early 1960s, via Wikipedia Commons. The annotation to the image refers to a 1956 slide as source. This must be incorrect unless a beer line still in planning was pictured, but I think probably the image was created later.*\n\nNote re image: Image source is linked in the text.

Mencken (1989), ed. Charles Fecher, Mencken’s June 26, 1945 entry reads in part:\n\nAfter the dinner George Newcomer introduced me to a lawyer who had come from Washington, and the three of us went to a place called the Cavalier, in St. Paul street, for a few beers. The only malt liquor available was Gunther’s, which is very bad, but we were so thirsty that we managed to get it down. I had never been in the Cavalier before. It turned out to be a very filthy bar, with [a] dismal looking eating room attached. While we sat at a table a drunk tried to horn in, but we brushed him off.\n\nI include his observations on the bar because the distaste echoes and reinforces his (contemporary) opinion of Gunther’s; the two went hand in hand.\n\nFrom having regaled himself at an illicit drinking event at Gunther’s Brewery during Prohibition, where he evidently liked the beer – a helles, he noted – he tells us 20 years later Gunther’s beer is “very bad”.\n\nHow to explain this? He wasn’t just being polite on the first occasion since he mentioned the Gunther’s frolic in a private letter to beery friend Philip Goodman.*\n\nHowever, we saw earlier that Gunther’s in 1937 issued a new version of its lager, advertised continually thenceforth as dry and non-sweet. Hoppy too, yes, but inferentially not as as rich as its lager sold between 1933 and 1936.\n\nSo, if the unsanctioned helles was this pre-1937 lager, by 1945 the Gunther beer had changed. Further, it very likely had no Bohemian hops, as advertised between 1937 and start of the war, due to the impossibility to obtain Czech or other European hops.\n\nThe brewery must have used some kind of American hop for aroma and flavour, which wasn’t as good. On top of all this Gunther’s wartime beer may have cut other corners, due to a nation-wide shortage of fermentable materials and other beer ingredients, and requirements of wartime regulatory bodies.\n\nNow, if the illicit helles was a cut above the 1933-1936 lager, even more so would the 1945 Gunther’s show poorly against it. So the change in Mencken’s opinion is probably explained in one of these ways.\n\nIn 1948 Mencken, who died in 1954, suffered a catastrophic stroke. He lost the ability to read or write but could converse and do other daily functions.\n\nHe still drank beer, often with his brother August, with whom he lived at the family home on Hollins Street, inherited on their parents’ death. Mencken had married in the 1930s and the couple lived in a separate household but his wife was in poor health and died within a few years – he returned to the family hearth to live with bachelor August (an engineer, if I recall correctly).\n\nIn Amy Davis’s Flickering Treasures: Rediscovering Baltimore’s Forgotten Movie Theatres (2017), Marty Hunovice recalled as a youth doing deliveries for his father’s package liquor store:\n\nWhen I was 11, I remember making deliveries to H.L. Mencken, who lived around the corner. This was about 1952, or 1953. I’d wheel around a case each of Arrow and Gunther beer, White Owl cigars, and some kind of whiskey in a brown bag. I didn’t know that much about Mencken, but he drank a lot of beer. He was kind of gruff, but I got a quarter tip. Afterwards I’d go to the movies…\n\nThe whiskey was probably Maryland straight rye, which Mencken liked of occasion. Arrow was from another Baltimore brewery. But why the Gunther’s now, after the clear disenchantment of 1945?\n\nDid the beer improve? Or was Mencken simply being nostalgic, preferring to recall gay nights in the Twenties at Gunther’s Brewery singing Lieder? As a dedicated beer man, who had made good money I should add from his professional career, he could have bought any beer he wanted. He chose Gunther’s alongside city stablemate Arrow.**\n\nWhat about Mencken’s ultimate Baltimore beer preference? Robert D. Reynolds, Jr. in his 1983 paper, “H.L. Mencken: Medical Champion and Human Body Pessimist”, quoted another Mencken letter, from 1933. Mencken wrote that National Premium’s beer, i.e., the famous National Bohemian (Natty Bo), was always the best in Baltimore.\n\nReynolds writes it was not Mencken’s favourite beer in America: Piels (New York), Hauck (Cincinnati) and Michelob (St. Louis) were among the beers holding that honour.\n\nMencken also approved good Canadian ale, as our next post shows.\n\n…\n\n*He later fell out with Goodman, who wanted him to denounce Hitlerism and the persecution of the Jews, which he never did (not publicly). His German ethnic origins, or something, seemed to hold him back. Mencken had complex feelings about Jews, but a rooted animus to them cannot be doubted, finally, when you read, not just passages in his posthumous diaries, but some writing published in his lifetime. Some consider he expressed typical feelings of the day, but Mencken went beyond that, at times sounding – before his stroke – like a street hoodlum. It’s one of those conundrums, especially considering so many of his associations, professional and social, were with Jews. They included his long-time publisher, Alfred Knopf in New York.\n\n**As to young Marty Hunovice thinking Mencken drank a lot of beer, perhaps he did, but also the beer served two palates, August’s was the other, which Hunovice may not have realised. By my reading Mencken was a lifelong dedicated but circumspect drinker; he wrote about this on a number of occasions. His complex character was informed by a streak of bourgeois propriety, evident in some ways and not others, and this was one.\n\n© 2015-2024 Copyright of Gary M. Gillman. All Rights Reserved.
