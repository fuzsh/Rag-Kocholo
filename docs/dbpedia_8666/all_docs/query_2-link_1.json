        "text": "Canadian ice hockey defenceman\n\nFor the novelist and television writer, see Roger Lemelin.\n\nIce hockey player\n\nRoger Marcel Lemelin (February 6, 1954 - September 17, 2023) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played 36 games in the National Hockey League for the Kansas City Scouts and the Colorado Rockies between 1974 and 1978. The rest of his career was spent in the minor leagues, mainly the American Hockey League (AHL).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLemelin was born in Iroquois Falls.[2] He played junior hockey with the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey Association for two seasons.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLemelin was selected by the Kansas City Scouts in the 1974 NHL amateur draft, and by the Toronto Toros of the World Hockey Association in the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft.[3]\n\nOpting to sign with the Scouts, Lemelin made his professional debut that year, though primarily played in the AHL. Over the next four seasons, he remained in the AHL, while briefly appearing for the Scouts and later Rockies, as the Scouts had moved in 1976 to Colorado. After 1978, Lemelin played a further three seasons in the minor leagues, and after two seasons away played one final season in 1983–84.[4]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1972–73 London Knights OHA 62 6 12 18 92 — — — — — 1973–74 London Knights OHA 48 10 30 40 100 — — — — — 1974–75 Kansas City Scouts NHL 8 0 1 1 6 — — — — — 1974–75 Baltimore Clippers AHL 36 1 13 14 59 — — — — — 1974–75 Springfield Indians AHL 23 1 3 4 24 17 2 2 4 36 1975–76 Kansas City Scouts NHL 11 0 0 0 0 — — — — — 1975–76 Springfield Indians NHL 53 4 14 18 83 — — — — — 1976–77 Colorado Rockies NHL 14 1 1 2 21 — — — — — 1976–77 Rhode Island Reds AHL 47 2 8 10 73 — — — — — 1977–78 Colorado Rockies NHL 3 0 0 0 0 — — — — — 1977–78 Phoenix Roadrunners CHL 27 1 5 6 72 — — — — — 1977–78 Hampton Gulls AHL 16 1 4 5 22 — — — — — 1977–78 Philadelphia Firebirds AHL 33 0 5 5 52 — — — — — 1978–79 Hampton Aces NEHL 38 4 12 16 109 — — — — — 1979–80 Hampton Aces EHL 5 0 1 1 20 — — — — — 1979–80 Hershey Bears AHL 3 0 1 1 2 15 0 1 1 62 1980–81 Hershey Bears AHL 12 0 2 2 14 — — — — — 1980–81 Oklahoma City Stars CHL 11 0 1 1 6 — — — — — 1980–81 Hampton Aces EHL 21 0 6 6 24 — — — — — 1983–84 Muskegon Mohawks IHL 57 3 13 16 65 — — — — — AHL totals 223 9 50 59 329 32 2 3 5 98 NHL totals 36 1 2 3 27 — — — — —\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
