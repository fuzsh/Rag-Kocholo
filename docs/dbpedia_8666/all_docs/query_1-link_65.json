        "text": "OTTAWA -- Hockey star Guy Lefleur, actor-broadcaster Don Harron, Montreal publisher-author Roger Lemelin and famed relief worker Dr. Lotta Hitschmanova were among 62 Canadians awarded the Order of Canada.\n\nGovernor General Edward Schreyer inducted the famous Canadians into the country's highest honor in a ceremony at his official residence Wednesday.\n\nLafleur, 29, who has won virtually all of the National Hockey League's awards since joining the Montreal Canadiens in 1971, was recognized by the Order for his charity work and involvement in Quebec's Society for Crippled Children.\n\nThe 56-year-old Harron, a Shakespearian actor better known for his comedy role of Charlie Farquharson, is the host of the CBC Radio's 'Morningside' program.\n\nLemelin, 61, publisher of Montreal LaPresse, was recognized for his outstanding career in letters. The creator of the popular 1950s Quebec TV comedy, 'The Plouffe Family' and author of the novel of the same name, Lemelin revolutionized Canadian literature.\n\nThe Czechoslovakian-born Hitschmanova, a Sorbonne University graduate, has operated the Unitarian Service Committee in Ottawa for the past 35 years.\n\nHonored by many foreign countries for her relief work, she was last awarded the Royal Bank of Canada's $50,000 prize for her 'outstanding contribution to human welfare and the common good.'"
