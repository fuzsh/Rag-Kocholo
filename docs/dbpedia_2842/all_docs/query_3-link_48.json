The lower two tiers are constructed of large stones in a square form. Above this are three base tiers formed of stamped zinc that also hold inscriptions. Above the base tiers are larger segments of stamped zinc panels forming the statue’s pedestal and holding inscriptions. A bust in relief of Robert E. Lee comprises the panel directly beneath the statue on the memorial’s front. The soldier is standing, looking straight ahead, with the proper left foot slightly forward. He is holding his weapon by the barrel with the butt resting on the ground. See \"Subject Notes\" below for several aspects of this monument that make it unique for a North Carolina Confederate memorial.\n\nInscription\n\nNorth, tablet: THIS MONUMENT / WAS / ERECTED BY THE / TYRRELL / MONUMENT ASSOCIATION, / A.D. 1902. / EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. / MARK MAJETTE, ABNER ALEXANDER, / THOMAS L.

Miss Lula Jones, daughter of a Confederate veteran, unveiled the monument.\n\nSubject Notes\n\nSeveral aspects of the Tyrrell County Confederate Monument make it stand out among Confederate memorials in the state. It is one of only four built before 1904 in public/civic spaces. Previously most of the monuments were located in cemeteries, typically marking mass graves of Confederate dead. It also is atypical in that it is made almost completely of stamped metal (see \"Materials & Techniques\".) Typically, only the statue would have been metal whereas the base and pedestal were stone. Two of the panels have inscriptions to women. Aside from two monuments dedicated specifically to women in Raleigh and Wadesboro few other monuments mention the contributions of women to the Confederate cause. The inscription on another panel is stamped “In Appreciation of Our Faithful Slaves.” To be clear, the \"faithful slave narrative\" was used before the Civil War by southern slave owners in their response to abolitionists and later was used by white supremacists. Micki McElya addresses this topic in her 2017 article The Faithful Slave, How Alex Tizon’s Essay Echoes a Trope with Deep Roots in American History: \"The faithful-slave trope was the ultimate example of southern paternalism that described the master-slave relationship as essentially familial, existing outside of market forces. Advocates proclaimed slavery to be morally superior to free labor, arguing that it was more truly humane, based on a lifetime of mutual care and obligation as well as natural racial hierarchies. By this logic, some were born to be slaves while others were born with the responsibility to manage, guide, and care for them. This was often summed up in the phrase that certain slaves (and later free domestic workers) were “like one of the family.” The word “like,” of course, glosses over American slavery’s endemic sexual exploitation and family destruction, as well as the fact that many enslaved people were their owners’ family.\"\n\nControversies\n\nFollowing the massacre of nine African Americans in a church in Charleston, South Carolina on June 17, 2015 by white supremacist Dylann Roof, Americans, especially southerners, have reflected on and argued over the historical legacy of slavery, the Civil War, the Confederacy, and white supremacy. Monuments have been a particular focus of these debates and controversies, especially after the death of a counter-protester, Heather Heyer, at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 and after President Donald Trump expressed his opposition to the removal of Confederate memorials. Despite laws in many southern states intended to prevent or impede the removal or relocation of historical monuments, protesters and local community leaders have removed or relocated controversial monuments associated with slavery, the Confederacy, and white supremacy. The pace of the removal of controversial monuments accelerated sharply in 2020, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Against the backdrop of protests against police brutality and white supremacy across the nation, local authorities in many communities in North Carolina removed and/or relocated monuments that were the focus of civil unrest.\n\nCalls in 2019 and 2020 for removal of the Tyrrell County monument came to naught with county manager David Clegg and the Tyrrell County Board of Commissioners Chairman Tommy Everett stating that state law prevented its relocation. Efforts to force its removal continue.\n\nLocation\n\nThe monument is located beside the Tyrrell County Courthouse at the southeast corner of Main Street and Broad Street. The Tyrrell County War Memorial stands on the east side of the courthouse building. The Tyrell County marker is situated at the left corner of the courthouse at the handicap ramp."
