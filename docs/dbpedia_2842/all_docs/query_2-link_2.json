        "text": "In accordance with the UDC standard monument dedication program, children performed the job of unveiling the monument. Historian Karen Cox notes that \"the Daughters envisioned each monument as a gift that connected past generations with future generations. It was culturally significant, therefore, that a child symbollically open the gift.\" At Monocacy, 13-year old Grafton Wallis and 9-year old John Wood did the honors. An honor court of girls accompanied the boys. Included in the court was 10-year old Eleanor Potts Williams, the grandniece of Confederate Capt. Alexander Young who was killed at Antietam.\n\nThe boys unveiled a rough cut block of granite set upon a smooth granite foundation with a bronze plaque embedded in the front. At approximately 12-feet tall the monument would have dominated the farm fields surrounding it. The bronze plaque read:\n\nThis boulder overlooks the Monocacy Battlefield and is in memory of the Southern soldiers who fell in the battle fought July 9, 1864 which resulted in a Confederate victory.\n\nErected July 9, 1914 by the Fitzhugh Lee chapter United Daughters of the Confederacy of Frederick, Maryland"
