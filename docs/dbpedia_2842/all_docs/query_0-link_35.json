        "text": "\"This excellent and well-written book illuminates the work of an important group in the South's Lost Cause movement.\"--American Historical Review\n\n\"[This] excellent study speaks to a significant gap in the literature of southern cultural memory, gender, and Reconstruction. Not only is it a must-read for anyone working in those areas, but it is a key contribution to the study of women and gender in this period.\"--Journal of American History\n\n\"[An] impressive book. . . . Highly recommended.\"--Choice\n\n\"Janney's fine monograph is grounded in an impressive body of archival material supported by a very strong command of a wide array of secondary source literature.\"--Southern Historian\n\n\"Janney's thoughtful study helps the Ladies to claim their rightful place in the history of Confederate memory making. Her lively stories of their hard-fought campaigns to build some of the most notable monuments of the state likewise make this an entertaining and valuable addition to the history of southern women's activism after the war.\"--Virginia Magazine"
