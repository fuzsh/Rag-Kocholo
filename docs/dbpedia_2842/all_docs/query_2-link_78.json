        "text": "At least one Confederate memorial in New York City has come down this summer: a plaque memorializing a tree that Robert E. Lee planted in Brooklyn. But several more monuments remain, and that is what inspired a protest yesterday at Fort Hamilton, a U.S. Army base located in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, which has a street called General Lee Avenue and a Stonewall Jackson Way. The protest, sponsored by Representative Yvette Clarke, happened because it’s harder to get rid of memorials to the Confederacy in New York than one might imagine.\n\n“When you think about the insult, when you think about the hypocrisy, where you have our Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out with statements in the wake of Charlottesville to say that they don’t tolerate racial bigotry,” Clarke said, at the midday event, “for them to have their bases named after Confederates, streets and their roadways named after Confederates, it sends an awfully mixed signal.”\n\nIn the case of street names that memorialize Confederates in New York, jurisdiction is an issue, especially on an Army base. The plaque that marked the Brooklyn tree planted by Lee was on private property: the lawn of a boarded-up Episcopal church. Its takedown was fairly straightforward; the local Episcopal bishop had the authority to remove it, and did so a few weeks after I called his office to ask about its status. A tree is still there, but it is not the same tree that Lee planted. It is a replacement tree, planted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, or U.D.C., the original installers of the plaque, which commemorated Lee’s attendance at the church. The U.D.C has deep roots in New York City, and has spent a century working to make the Confederate generals seem less like they were part of an armed white-secessionist movement and more like patriotic heroes of a civil, if not genteel, war.\n\nAs the rally took place yesterday, in a park adjacent to Fort Hamilton, city police guarded the base’s gate on the city side, blocking it with patrol cars, while the gate was guarded on the inside by Army personnel, standing, it appeared to me, very near another U.D.C. memorial to Robert E. Lee: a plaque on a boulder. That plaque offers details on Lee. “Then Captain, Corps of Engineers, U.S.A. resided on this site 1841-1846,” it says, adding, “Presented by New York Division United Daughters of the Confederacy.” Lee, a West Point-trained engineer, was assigned to the base in 1841, charged with improving its defenses. (He also designed the defenses for Fort Tompkins, across the Narrows, in Staten Island.) Stonewall Jackson arrived in 1848, just after Lee left to fight Mexico, in 1847.\n\nAt the beginning of the summer, Clarke wrote to the Secretary of the Army to ask that names of the streets be changed. The office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army wrote back to deny the request. “The great generals of the Civil War, Union and Confederate, are an inextricable part of our military history,” the office wrote. “The men in question were honored on Fort Hamilton as individuals, not as representatives of any particular cause or ideology. After over a century, any effort to rename memorializations on Fort Hamilton would be controversial and divisive. This is contrary to the Nation’s original intent in naming these streets, which was the spirit of reconciliation.”\n\nOf course, the Army wrote that letter before the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, this month, when the issue of de-memorialization was not quite so front and center. But the Army’s statement is complicated for other reasons, too. First of all, General Lee Avenue most likely has not been there for a full hundred years. It’s difficult to say when, precisely, the streets were named, but the base was remodelled after the Second World War, and again in the early nineteen-sixties, when Robert Moses built the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Around the time of the bridge’s construction, General Lee Avenue was extended. As for what the Army calls “the spirit of reconciliation” that it claims was “the Nation’s original intent,” note that the notion of “the spirit of reconciliation” is precisely the project of the U.D.C. and other neo-Confederate groups like it. The U.D.C., in particular, works quietly, billing itself as apolitical, according to its 1894 constitution: “The objects and purposes of the federation shall be social, literary, historical, monumental, benevolent and honorable in every degree, without any political signification whatever.”\n\nThe U.D.C. began in the eighteen-nineties. It was a consolidation of several women’s groups in the South, which began what they described as the motherly task of remembering and commemorating the men who had fought in the Civil War. They worked in a kind of feminine gray zone, pushing themselves as apolitical sisters and daughters. They began by memorializing Confederate soldiers, first in the South and then in the North, finding and restoring Confederate flags and gravesites, and slowly adding monuments, memorials, and hundreds of historical plaques like the one that, until this month, marked Robert E. Lee’s tree in Brooklyn and the one down the block that still stands at Fort Hamilton’s gate. Over the course of decades, the U.D.C. managed to construct a presence for its reimagined Confederacy in the American public space, celebrating it as a legitimate cause for “freedom” and states’ rights.\n\nU.D.C. memorialization began in Southern cities—U.D.C.’s headquarters today is in Richmond, Virginia, which was once the capital of the Confederacy—but pressed north: I’ve seen the group’s work as far north as Boston, in the East, and Wisconsin, in the Midwest, and as far west as Monterey, California. At one point, the U.D.C. was close to memorializing its version of the Confederacy on the National Mall with the infamous “mammy monument,” a memorial to what the group described as “the faithful slave mammies of the South.” (A bill to build the memorial was passed by the Senate in 1923, the same year that an anti-lynching bill failed.) When that bill was defeated, the U.D.C. redoubled its efforts. “After the mammy monument failed, the U.D.C. went to a fairly aggressive campaign to memorialize the Confederacy around the country,” the historian Craig Wilder, the author of the excellent “A Covenant with Color: Race and Social Power in Brooklyn 1636-1990,” told me. “And part of the effort was to nationalize the story of the Confederacy and to attach that narrative to the twentieth-century South, deeply rooted in a two-tier racial system and a hyper-exploitation of black labor.”\n\nTo argue that these U.D.C. memorials and monuments—and, indeed, the project of “reconciliation”—are apolitical and not racist, or even not controversial, is disingenuous, to put it mildly. On the other hand, to sell that argument successfully is stark proof of the success of the U.D.C.’s century of work: fifty-four per cent of Americans recently polled by Reuters were for keeping the Confederate monuments in place. Also disingenuous is the argument that New York City was an outlier for the Confederate cause. New York was known at the outbreak of the Civil War as the most Southern city outside of the South; in 1860, J. D. B. De Bow, a prominent Southern slavery apologist, described New York as “almost as dependent on Southern slavery as Charleston itself.” Among other things, it was the financial center of the slave trade in the U.S. After the war, the U.D.C. was known for throwing regular galas at places like the Waldorf-Astoria to honor, for example, Jefferson Davis’s widow."
