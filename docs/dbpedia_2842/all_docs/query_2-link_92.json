Many state-wide notables of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (U.D.C.) were in attendance along with members of the Daughters of the American Revolution and several African American citizens, whom the local newspaper account reported as a “body servants of famous people of the Confederacy”. The United States Army was represented by Brigadier General Manus McClosky of Fort Bragg.\n\nAn “Old South” atmosphere was present throughout the proceedings with Confederate flags scattered about the grounds and young women and U.D.C. members dressed in costumes of the Old South. Mrs. Mary Bennett Little, 27-year president of the Wadesboro chapter of the U.D.C., served as mistress of the ceremony. Following the reading of the inscription by a Mr. Marshall of the Frank Bennett Chapter, Children of the Confederacy performed a musical number entitled “The Homespun Dress.” Brigadier General Manus McClosky delivered a short speech, and the salute of the Flag followed. The band played the Star Spangled Banner, and the original flag of the Anson county guards was held aloft during the ceremony. A granite vase was presented by Mr. Scoggins of Scoggins Memorial Art Shops."
