        "text": "After being indoctrinated online into the world of white supremacy and inspired by a racist hate group, Dylann Roof told friends he wanted to start a “race war.” Someone had to take “drastic action” to take back America from “stupid and violent” African Americans, he wrote.\n\nThen, on June 17, 2015, he attended a Bible study meeting at the historic Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and murdered nine people, all of them black.\n\nThe act of terror shocked America with its chilling brutality.\n\nBut Roof did not spark a race war. Far from it.\n\nInstead, when photos surfaced depicting the 21-year-old white supremacist with the Confederate battle flag — including one in which he held the flag in one hand and a gun in the other — Roof ignited something else entirely: a grassroots movement to remove the flag from public spaces.\n\nIn what seemed like an instant, the South’s 150-year reverence for the Confederacy was shaken. Public officials responded to the national mourning and outcry by removing prominent public displays of its most recognizable symbol.\n\nIt became a moment of deep reflection for the nation — and particularly for a region where the Confederate flag is viewed by many white Southerners as an emblem of their heritage and regional pride despite its association with slavery, Jim Crow and the violent resistance to the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe moment came amid a period of growing alarm about the vast racial disparities in our country, seen most vividly in the deaths of unarmed African Americans at the hands of police.\n\nUnder intense pressure, South Carolina officials acted first, passing legislation to remove the Confederate flag from the State House grounds, where it had flown since 1961. In Montgomery, Alabama — a city known as the Cradle of the Confederacy — the governor acted summarily and without notice, ordering state workers to lower several versions of Confederate flags that flew alongside a towering Confederate monument just steps from the Capitol.\n\nThe movement quickly began to focus on symbols beyond the flag. In Memphis, the city council voted to remove a statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate general who oversaw the massacre of black Union soldiers and became a Ku Klux Klan leader after the Civil War. Months later, after a heated debate in December, the New Orleans City Council voted to remove three Confederate statues and another commemorating a bloody white supremacist rebellion against the city’s Reconstruction government in 1874.\n\nAcross the South, communities began taking a critical look at many other symbols honoring the Confederacy and its icons — statues and monuments; city seals; the names of streets, parks and schools; and even official state holidays.\n\nNow, three years after the Charleston massacre, more than 100 monuments and other symbols of the Confederacy have been removed. But far more remain. In this updated survey, the Southern Poverty Law Center identified 1,747 Confederate monuments, place names and other symbols still in public spaces, both in the South and across the nation.* These include:\n\n780 monuments, more than 300 of which are in Georgia, Virginia or North Carolina;\n\n103 public K-12 schools and three colleges named for Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis or other Confederate icons;\n\n80 counties and cities named for Confederates;\n\n9 observed state holidays in five states; and\n\n10 U.S. military bases.\n\nCritics may say removing a flag or monument, renaming a military base or school, or ending a state holiday is tantamount to “erasing history.” In fact, across the country but mostly in the South, Confederate flag supporters held more than 350 rallies in the six months after the Charleston attack. In Charlottesville, Virginia, the city council’s vote to remove statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson sparked several demonstrations, including the deadly protest on Aug. 11-12, 2017, one of the largest white supremacist rallies in decades.\n\nBut the argument that the Confederate flag and other displays represent “heritage, not hate” ignores the near-universal heritage of African Americans whose ancestors were enslaved by the millions in the South. It trivializes their pain, their history and their concerns about racism — whether it’s the racism of the past or that of today.\n\nAnd it conceals the true history of the Confederate States of America and the seven decades of Jim Crow segregation and oppression that followed the Reconstruction era.\n\nVideo of Whose Heritage? SPLC&#039;s Heidi Beirich and Lecia Brooks discuss Confederate symbols\n\nThere is no doubt among reputable historians that the Confederacy was established upon the premise of white supremacy and that the South fought the Civil War to preserve its slave labor. Its founding documents and its leaders were clear. “Our new government is founded upon … the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition,” declared Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens in his 1861 “Cornerstone speech.”\n\nIt’s also beyond question that the Confederate flag was used extensively by the Ku Klux Klan as it waged a campaign of terror against African Americans during the civil rights movement and that segregationists in positions of power raised it in defense of Jim Crow. George Wallace, Alabama’s governor, unfurled the flag above the state Capitol in 1963 shortly after vowing “segregation forever.” In many other cases, schools, parks and streets were named for Confederate icons during the era of white resistance to equality.\n\nDespite the well-documented history of the Civil War, legions of Southerners still cling to the myth of the Lost Cause as a noble endeavor fought to defend the region’s honor and its ability to govern itself in the face of Northern aggression. This deeply rooted but false narrative is the result of many decades of revisionism in the lore and even textbooks of the South that sought to create a more acceptable version of the region’s past. Confederate monuments and other symbols are very much a part of that effort.\n\nAs a consequence of the national reflection that began in Charleston, the myths and revisionist history surrounding the Confederacy may be losing their grip in the South.\n\nYet, for the most part, the symbols remain.\n\nThe effort to remove them is about more than symbolism. It’s about starting a conversation about the values and beliefs shared by a community.\n\nIt’s about understanding our history as a nation.\n\nAnd it’s about acknowledging the injustices of the past as we address those of today.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents\n\nIt’s difficult to live in the South without being reminded that its states once comprised a renegade nation known as the Confederate States of America. Schools, parks, streets, dams and other public works are named for its generals. Courthouses, capitols and public squares are adorned with resplendent statues of its heroes and towering memorials to the soldiers who died. U.S. military bases bear the names of its leaders. And, speckling the Southern landscape are thousands of Civil War markers and plaques.\n\nNote: The map below includes symbols and monuments that have been removed. To view only the active symbols, uncheck the \"Removed symbols\" box.\n\nView the full map.\n\nThe South even has its own version of Mount Rushmore — the Confederate Memorial Carving, a three-acre, high-relief sculpture depicting Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson on the face of Stone Mountain near Atlanta.\n\nThere is nothing remotely comparable in the North to honor the winning side of the Civil War.\n\nFor decades, those opposed to public displays honoring the Confederacy raised their objections, but with little success. A notable exception was a Southern Poverty Law Center suit that, relying on an obscure state law, led to the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the Alabama Capitol in 1993. Another was a 2000 compromise between South Carolina lawmakers and the NAACP that moved the flag from its perch above the Capitol dome to a monument on the State House grounds.\n\nBut everything changed on June 17, 2015 — just five days short of the 150th anniversary of the last shot of the Civil War.\n\nThat day in June, a white supremacist killed nine African-American parishioners at the “Mother Emanuel” church in Charleston, a place of worship renowned for its place in civil rights history.\n\nAs the nation recoiled in horror, photos showing the gunman with the Confederate flag were discovered online. Almost immediately, political leaders across the South were besieged with calls to remove the flag and other Confederate symbols from public spaces.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, it became clear that hundreds of public entities ranging from small towns to state governments across the South paid homage to the Confederacy in some way. But there was no comprehensive database of such symbols, leaving the extent of Confederate iconography supported by public institutions largely a mystery.\n\nIn an effort to assist the efforts of local communities to re-examine these symbols, the SPLC launched a study to catalog them. For the final tally, the researchers excluded thousands of monuments, markers or other tributes that were on or in battlefields, museums, cemeteries and other places that are largely historical in nature. In this second edition of the report, the SPLC has identified monuments and symbols not included in the first report and removed those reported erroneously.\n\nHere are the most salient findings:\n\n1. There are more than 1,700 symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces.\n\nThe study identified 1,747 publicly sponsored symbols honoring Confederate leaders, soldiers or the Confederate States of America in general. These include monuments and statues; flags; holidays and other observances; and the names of schools, highways, parks, bridges, counties, cities, lakes, dams, roads, military bases and other public works. Many of these are prominent displays in major cities and at state capitols; others, like the Stonewall Jackson Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department in Manassas, Virginia, are little known.\n\nAmong the approximately 184 individual Confederates* honored with monuments and place names, Robert E. Lee is by far the most prominent, with a total of 230. He’s followed by Jefferson Davis (152), Stonewall Jackson (112), P.G.T. Beauregard (57) and J.E.B. Stuart (49).\n\nSign our petition to tell lawmakers to remove symbols honoring Jefferson Davis from public spaces.\n\n2. There are 103 public K-12 schools and three colleges named after prominent Confederates.\n\nOf the 103 public schools and three colleges named for Confederates leaders, those honoring Robert E. Lee are the most numerous (42), followed by Stonewall Jackson (15), Jefferson Davis (11), Nathan Bedford Forrest (8) P.G.T. Beauregard (7) and John Reagan (6).\n\nAt least 34 of these schools/colleges were built or dedicated from 1950 to 1970, broadly encompassing the era of the modern civil rights movement.\n\nThe vast majority are in the states of the former Confederacy, though Robert E. Lee Elementary in East Wenatchee, Washington, is an interesting outlier. And, until their names were changed in 2016, two elementary schools in California (Long Beach and San Diego) were named for Lee. The Long Beach school was renamed in honor of a local labor activist.\n\n3. There are nearly 800 Confederate monuments and statues on public property throughout the country, the vast majority in the South.\n\nThe study identified 780 monuments at county courthouses, town squares, state capitols and other public venues. The majority (604) were dedicated before 1950. Twenty eight were dedicated between 1950 and 1970. Thirty-four were dedicated after 2000.\n\nMany of these are memorials to Confederate soldiers, typically inscribed with colorful language extolling their heroism and valor, or, sometimes, the details of particular battles or local units. Some go further, however, to glorify the Confederacy’s cause. For example, in Abbeville, South Carolina, a monument erected in 1906 is inscribed with a poem that reads, in part: “The world shall yet decide, in truth’s clear, far-off light, that the soldiers who wore the gray, and died with Lee, were in the right.”\n\nThree states stand out for having far more monuments than others: Georgia (114), Virginia (110) and North Carolina (97). But the other eight states that seceded from the Union have their fair share: Texas (68), Alabama (60), South Carolina (58), Mississippi (52), Tennessee (43), Arkansas (41), Louisiana (32) and Florida (26).\n\nThese monuments are found in a total of 23 states and the District of Columbia. Outside of the seceding states, the states with the most are Kentucky (24), Missouri (13) and West Virginia (9). Monuments are also found in states far from the Confederacy, including California (3) and Arizona (4). There was even a Confederate monument in Massachusetts, a stalwart of the Union during the Civil War, but it was removed from Georges Island in Boston Harbor in 2017.\n\n4. There were two major periods in which the dedication of Confederate monuments and other symbols spiked — the first two decades of the 20th century and during the civil rights movement.\n\nSoutherners began honoring the Confederacy with statues and other symbols almost immediately after the Civil War. The first Confederate Memorial Day, for example, was dreamed up by the wife of a Confederate soldier in 1866. That same year, Jefferson Davis laid the cornerstone of the Confederate Memorial Monument in a prominent spot on the state Capitol grounds in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nBut two distinct periods saw a significant rise in the dedication of monuments and other symbols.\n\nThe first began around 1900, amid the period in which states were enacting Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise the newly freed African Americans and re-segregate society. This spike lasted well into the 1920s, a period that saw a dramatic resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, which had been born in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War.\n\nThe second spike began in the early 1950s and lasted through the 1960s, as the civil rights movement led to a backlash against deseregationists.\n\n5. The Confederate flag maintains a publicly supported presence in at least five Southern states.\n\nIn 2015, Confederate flags were removed from the capitol grounds of South Carolina and Alabama following the Charleston church massacre. However, the survey identified seven public places in five former Confederate states where the flag still flies or is represented.\n\nThe most prominent is the Mississippi state flag, adopted amid the onset of Jim Crow in 1894. It conspicuously incorporates the Confederate battle flag into its design. In addition, emblems that adorn the uniforms of Alabama state troopers contain a likeness of the flag.\n\nAlso, there are four county courthouses where the flag still flies: Grady and Rabun counties in Georgia, Carroll County in Mississippi, and Walton County in Florida.\n\n6. Ten major U.S. military bases are named in honor of Confederate military leaders.\n\nAll of the 10 military bases named for Confederate leaders are located in the former states of the Confederacy. They are Fort Rucker (Gen. Edmund Rucker) in Alabama; Fort Benning (Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning) and Fort Gordon (Maj. Gen. John Brown Gordon) in Georgia; Camp Beauregard (Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard) and Fort Polk (Gen. Leonidas Polk) in Louisiana; Fort Bragg (Gen. Braxton Bragg) in North Carolina; Fort Hood (Gen. John Bell Hood) in Texas; and Fort A.P. Hill (Gen. A.P. Hill), Fort Lee (Gen. Charles Lee) and Fort Pickett (Gen. George Pickett) in Virginia.\n\n7. Eleven states have 23 Confederate holidays or observances in their state codes; nine of those were paid holidays in 2018.\n\nIn 11 states, 23 Confederate holidays or observances are written into the state code, but only nine of those holidays, in five states, are paid holidays for state employees.\n\nAlabama and Mississippi each have three Confederate holidays in which state employees are given a day off, though in some cases they are combined with other holidays (Lee’s birthday, for example, is celebrated on the same day as Martin Luther King Day).\n\nThe nine holidays officially observed in 2018 are: Alabama (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); Mississippi (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); South Carolina (Confederate Memorial Day); Texas (Confederate Heroes’ Day); Virginia (Lee-Jackson Day).\n\nThe other states that have Confederate holidays in their state codes are Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nGeorgia struck Lee’s birthday and Confederate Memorial Day from its official state calendar in August 2015 and replaced the names with the term “state holiday.” Arkansas in 2017 decoupled Robert E. Lee Day from Martin Luther King Day and made it a standalone, unpaid holiday marked with a gubernatorial proclamation.\n\nSign our petition to tell lawmakers to eliminate public holidays honoring Jefferson Davis.\n\n8. More than 100 monuments and other Confederate symbols have been removed in 22 states, including the District of Columbia, since June 2015.\n\nThe survey identified 114 Confederate symbols removed since the Charleston massacre, including 48 monuments and three flags, and name changes for 35 schools and one college, and 10 roads. Among them was the Confederate battle flag that had flown at the South Carolina State House grounds in Columbia for 54 years.\n\nTexas led the way (33), followed by Virginia (15), Florida (10), Tennessee (8), Georgia (6), Maryland (6), and North Carolina (4). Eighty-five removals were in former Confederate states.\n\nSome removals were highly contentious, like in New Orleans, where the city in 2017 removed three prominent statues honoring Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and P.G.T. Beauregard.\n\nSign our petition to tell lawmakers to remove symbols honoring Jefferson Davis from public spaces.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents\n\nThis report was compiled by using a variety of public and private datasets, as well as information submitted by the public, to identify monuments as well as place names and other symbols of the Confederacy found on public property or supported by public entities.\n\nPublic sources included the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Center for Education Statistics, the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places, and the Smithsonian Institution’s Art Inventory.\n\nThe researchers also reviewed news accounts and state and local government resources, such as state historical commissions and similar agencies. The information available through these sources was inconsistent across states. Some states, such as North Carolina, have comprehensive databases, while others, such as Louisiana, have very limited information.\n\nPrivate resources were used extensively for this edition. One of the most well-documented online sources of data on historical monuments is Waymarking, a membership-based database of locations in which members can post places and objects that they have visited. The public can search this database, and each entry includes a photograph and GPS coordinates. The Historical Marker Database is another source of information with entries submitted by the public and confirmed by an editor.\n\nExcluded from this count in this survey were thousands of monuments, markers, names or other tributes located on or within battlefields, museums, cemeteries or other places that are largely historical in nature. Markers that appeared to be approved by historical commissions were also excluded.\n\nAlthough some Confederate officers went on to have distinguished post-Civil War careers — including serving as governors and senators — monuments or other tributes that recognize their Confederate war service are included in the count. If the tribute specifically honors an aspect of their post-Civil War life, it is not included. Several tributes were dedicated before the Civil War; we decided to include them because the men they honor are known mostly today for their role in the Confederacy.\n\nSchool names\n\nSchool and school board websites were used to confirm the origins of school names (as were city and county websites to confirm those name origins). In a few instances, confirmation was not possible and schools were included or excluded based on the best evidence available. Schools were contacted directly by email or phone to confirm whether they had plans to change their name. In some instances, school boards had voted to change a name but had not set a date for the change. These schools were included. Finally, our findings on schools was cross-referenced with an April 2018 report by Education Week on schools named for Confederate leaders.\n\nRoadways\n\nThe locations of roadways were verified on Google maps. They were determined to be named for Confederates if a person’s full name was used, e.g. Jefferson Davis Avenue; if the last name or nickname matches a prominent Confederate hero and is not commonplace, e.g. Stonewall and Forrest; or if the name is non-distinct, e.g. Johnston and Hampton, but the street is part of a cluster of streets named for Confederates or abuts a parcel of land that contains a Confederate monument. In several instances, names spelled incorrectly, such as Forrest spelled as “Forest” and Stuart spelled as “Stewart,” were included because they were part of clusters.\n\nMonuments\n\nMonuments that were added to this edition of the report were discovered through crowd-sourcing, recent newspaper articles, new city and state surveys of monuments on public land, and private sources. The SPLC initiated an online call for submissions in April 2016 as a way of capturing symbols that were missed or reported in error in the first edition. Readers submitted 853 different entries through an online form (most of which were already in the first edition), as well as corrections for symbols that were erroneously included in the first edition.\n\nRemovals\n\nSince the 2015 Charleston church massacre, many communities have removed Confederate monuments or renamed schools bearing Confederate names. In this edition, researchers noted the year of such removals and name changes after confirming the change with at least one source. Also, in an attempt to create the most comprehensive dataset of current and past Confederate monuments, we included monuments and other symbols that were removed before 2015. A monument was only considered removed/name changed if the action had already been taken or if a firm date had been established.\n\nMarkers vs. Monuments\n\nIn this report there are 45 monuments with “marker” in their name. They are classified as monuments because they are stone objects that cannot be easily removed (they are not markers in the traditional sense, i.e. metal signs).\n\nSponsors\n\nThis edition includes information about the sponsor of each monument or other symbol, if it could be determined. This information is included in the aforementioned data sources.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents"
