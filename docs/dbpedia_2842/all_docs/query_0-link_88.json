        "text": "Abstract\n\nIexamine why Confederate monuments were built in public spaces in counties throughout the US South with particular attention to connections to race. I use event history analysis to examine the overall likelihood of erecting the first monument in a county while accounting for dimensions of time. The data include a comprehensive accounting of public Confederate monuments, covariates spanning 150 years, and several unique historical variables. This is the first study to assess competing explanations for the construction of Confederate monuments in a generalizable analysis. Results provide support for understanding Confederate monuments as part of a larger “memory movement.” Moreover, this movement was strongly related to the relationship between race and power within a county. However, my analyses offer limited support for viewing Confederate monuments as part of a countermovement in response to local racial tensions. Incorporating the nuances of how race relates to Confederate monuments will be valuable to future research as scholars develop an understanding of their links to contemporary society.\n\nThere are over 850 Confederate monuments located in public spaces throughout the US South. These monuments (and related public symbols, i.e., the Confederate battle flag) have occupied popular attention in the United States off and on since 2015. Scholars across a variety of disciplines have followed suit (e.g., O'Connell 2020; O'Connell and Forrest 2020; de Velasco 2019; Maxson 2020; Sheehan and Speights-Binet 2019; Simko, Cunningham, and Fox 2020; Strother, Piston, and Ogorzalek 2017; Wright and Esses 2017). However, research has yet to provide generalizable evidence to support the broad-sweeping claims regarding the factors involved in their construction, particularly the role of racialized dynamics. Are Confederate monuments a response to (Black) mobilization for equality, and/or are they a reflection of the privileged position of Whites to assert their perspective on the public landscape? I address limitations in the existing literature by examining the factors related to Confederate monument construction using an expansive, original dataset. My aim is to better understand the contexts motivating their existence, and I pay particular attention to the various ways in which race enters into this process.\n\nIt is common to hear debates on Confederate symbols framed around “heritage versus hate” (see, e.g., Strother, Piston, and Ogorzalek 2017; Wright and Esses 2017), but a close reading of Confederate monument research suggests that the linkages to race are more nuanced than a singular manifestation through “hate.” The evidence most consistent with Confederate monuments emerging from racism (i.e., “hate”) is based on the timing of monument construction, specifically the spike during the 1950s and 1960s, that overlaps with the Civil Rights movement (Southern Poverty Law Center [SPLC] 2016; Winberry 2015 [1983]). Historical research buttresses this evidence (e.g., Shackel 2003). However, there is also reason to believe that race is involved in Confederate monument construction through the local, racialized power structure (Davis and Gross 2012; O’Connell and Forrest 2020).\n\nUnderstanding the factors driving Confederate monument construction—particularly the nuances of racialized dynamics—is foundational to efforts aimed at understanding the social consequences of these public symbols (O’Connell 2020) and their removal (Simko, Cunningham, and Fox 2020). I focus on advancing research on racial inequality and the development of place. However, my results are relevant to broader discussions of social movements (e.g., Cunningham 2012; Ghoshal 2013; Oliver 2017) and can be used to consider additional political and economic consequences associated with these and similar public symbols.\n\nResults suggest that Confederate monuments remain relevant to understanding the contours of contemporary society through their connections to social movements. Critically, net of the capacity to support commemoration, I find that local manifestations of racial tensions were not a consistent motivating factor. Instead, the connections to race are primarily embedded within the institutions of the county. The racial hierarchy of a county is among the most dominant factors explaining Confederate monument construction. Understanding the complex ways in which Confederate monuments are linked to race will be critical to future research and public efforts aimed at disrupting systems of White dominance.\n\nConfederate Monuments and the Lost Cause\n\nConfederate memorialization began immediately following the end of the Civil War. However, it was not until the early 1900s that the bulk of monument construction moved to public spaces (e.g., county courthouse lawns) instead of cemeteries (Brundage 2005; Davis 1982; Foster 1987; Winberry 2015 [1983]). This transition coincides with greater visibility of the Lost Cause movement.\n\nThe goal of those who were driving the Lost Cause movement—including Women’s organizations, especially the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) (also see Cox 2003; Wheeler 1998)—was to embed a new perspective within public understandings of the Civil War (for a related discussion of the naming of the war see Foster 2018). The phrase “Lost Cause” refers to the notion that the Confederate defeat was the result of fate or overwhelming numbers. However, the movement developed around an effort to justify the South’s position, including the assertion that the motivation for the war was states’ rights rather than slavery (e.g., Blight 2001; Brundage 2005; Cox 2011; Foster 1987). Simultaneously, some members of the movement contributed to the maintenance of White advantage through the reassertion of White racial superiority and the “benign nature of slavery” (also see Mills and Simpson 2003; Shackel 2003). Social movement scholars would describe the Lost Cause movement as a “memory movement” because it was/is a sustained collective effort to change representations of the past (Ghoshal 2013; also see Daphi and Zamponi 2019).\n\nMonuments are an important piece of memory movements because they serve as symbols reflecting the sentiments and shared understandings of a particular person and/or event (Ladino 2019; Mayo 1988; White 1997). As part of a social movement, monuments gain enhanced relevance for studies of society. Moreover, the connections to social movements and memory make Confederate monuments particularly important to social scientists who aim to understand the development of places and local identities (see, e.g., Molotch, Freudenburg, and Paulsen 2000). Confederate monuments were a centerpiece of the Lost Cause movement and, therefore, may provide a valuable indicator of the success of that movement (also see Ghoshal 2013; Tomczuk 2016). However, in order to further develop their sociological relevance, we must first understand their origins.\n\nConfederate Monument Research\n\nThe Lost Cause Movement as a Response to Maintain White Dominance\n\nA commonly held belief about Confederate monuments is their connection to racial tensions. Theoretically, this explanation is linked to racial threat (e.g., Blalock 1967; Blumer 1958) and, more specifically, the idea of a countermovement. A countermovement is a movement that emerges in response to another movement (see, e.g., Andrews 2002). In this case, I ask: are local Confederate monuments a countermovement in response to movements aimed at reducing Black-White inequality (e.g., the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People [NAACP] and school desegregation)?\n\nThe primary evidence in support of a countermovement perspective is drawn from the timing of Confederate monument construction. The peak is in the early 1900s followed by a steady decline, but there is a second spike in the1950s and 1960s (SPLC 2016; Winberry 2015 [1983]). The second spike is often given more attention when discussing the importance of racism in Confederate monument construction, but both periods are associated with high levels of racial tension in the US South.\n\nHistorical case studies focusing on specific Confederate monuments provide some support for creators’ concerns about race (Cox 2003; Davis and Gross 2012; Mills and Simpson 2003; Shackel 2003; Wheeler 1998; Whites 2004). Racism was explicitly involved in the construction of some monuments—they were, in part, directed at shaping local and even national understandings of White superiority and Black inferiority (Mills and Simpson 2003; Shackel 2003). Shackel (2003) finds in his analysis of the Heyward Shepard memorial that “[s]outhern heritage groups realized that statues could be used to validate the continued subordination of blacks and justify their role in maintaining and fighting for slavery during the war” (77). This suggests that (some) Confederate monuments were part of a larger project aimed at protecting the racial order. Similar evidence is available from research on the Confederate battle flag (see, e.g., Lieb 2000). Research has yet to assess how widespread this motivation was and the extent to which it was connected to specific local movements that threatened White dominance. However, the countermovement perspective suggests a positive relationship between indicators of such events and monument construction (Hypothesis 1).\n\nPower and the Local Racial Hierarchy\n\nI consider a second way in which race is connected to Confederate monuments by asking: Does the racial hierarchy of a place (i.e., the relative privilege bestowed upon Whites) facilitate Confederate monument construction? This perspective stems from a critical read of the existing literature on Confederate monuments combined with theory on social movements.\n\nSome have raised questions about the countermovement explanation while suggesting race is still connected to Confederate monuments, just in different ways. O’Connell and Forrest (2020) use inductive content analysis to identify three distinct themes among Confederate monument inscriptions. In a temporal analysis of the different inscription themes, they find plain inscriptions—which are descriptive in nature as opposed to the more divisive Lost Cause inscriptions that glorify the Confederacy—dominated in the period associated with the Civil Rights Era (but not in the most contemporary period). This finding is in contrast to what we would expect from a countermovement perspective but could be due to the overlap between civil rights tensions and the Civil War centennial. They also find a higher concentration of monuments with a Lost Cause inscription in the Deep South and argue that this spatial pattern is indicative of their connection to racialized contexts, albeit ones not directly tied to Civil Rights activity. The level of detail of their analysis is insufficient for drawing clear conclusions regarding which factors are relevant to explaining monument construction, yet their findings suggest the need to more carefully consider the different ways in which race is involved.\n\nThis perspective is echoed in historical research on a Confederate monument centered on the Janney furnace, which is an artifact from the Civil War, but one of little significance since it was in service only briefly and had little impact on the war (Davis and Gross 2012). In their analysis, Davis and Gross (2012) find that maintaining White dominance is not expressed as a motivation for the memorial, but race is no less involved. First, public support of the monument is deeply divided along racialized lines resulting in a large percentage of (mostly Black) residents disagreeing with how public land and funds are ultimately used. Second, the authors emphasize how race is involved in what is commemorated in the first place (i.e., the selection of the inconsequential Janney furnace over the burning of a Freedom Rider bus that gained national attention during the Civil Rights era). Racialized dynamics may not have explicitly motivated the construction of this monument, but they shaped the success of local memory movements and subsequently altered the public landscape in a way that reflects and supports White dominance.\n\nThe findings of O’Connell and Forrest (2020) and Davis and Gross (2012) can both be explained by the connections among race, power, and social movements. This theoretical perspective is developed by Oliver (2017) in her analysis of the racial/ethnic dimensions of social movements. She argues that some movements make race an explicit focus, but all movements—regardless of their expressed objective—are shaped by racialized dynamics. Race influences the resources available to, the interpretation of, and subsequent success of a movement, including the likelihood of erecting a monument in a public space. Her theoretical development focuses on nation states, but I extend this perspective by marrying it with research on local variation in racialized dynamics tied to historical contexts (e.g., Curtis and O’Connell 2017). Differential local power structures related to race—or what I refer to as the racial hierarchy—may result in differential success of the Lost Cause movement because the movement was/is led by Whites. This perspective suggests that Confederate monuments will be more likely in places where the racial hierarchy favors Whites over Blacks to a greater extent than in other places (Hypothesis 2).\n\nCombined, previous research suggests that race is involved in the construction of Confederate monuments in a number of ways. However, existing evidence has yet to account for multiple factors simultaneously and is, therefore, unable to distinguish among the competing explanations. I aim to complement the existing body of work through an analysis of the various factors explaining Confederate monument construction, but with special attention to racialized countermovement dynamics and the local racial hierarchy. This research will provide new insight into these public symbols and, subsequently, advance the literatures on race, place, history, and social movements.\n\nData\n\nIn this analysis, I focus on monuments located in the census-defined South. This includes Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.1 I narrow my analysis to the southern United States because this is the area of the country with the majority of Confederate monuments and the best coverage in terms of data sources. Records of Confederate monuments in non-southern states are far less common and complete. There may be a similar concern regarding non-Confederate southern states (i.e., Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia), but I confirmed that results are unaffected by the inclusions of these states.\n\nI employ counties as my unit of analysis. All shapefiles are from the National Historic Geographic Information Systems (Manson et al. 2018). Conceivably, I could focus on more localized areas, such as cities and towns; however, that approach is logistically impractical. Foremost, data are unavailable at that scale for all points in time. Counties offer a reasonable alternative that also has the benefit of providing a sense of the broader racial/social/political context, beyond the immediate city/town borders.\n\nConfederate Monuments\n\nI define Confederate monuments as stand-alone structures that make direct reference to the Confederacy. This approach offers what may be considered a conservative count of monuments associated with the Lost Cause movement, but has the benefit of a clear topical focus without restricting the scope of the analysis to—for example—monuments built by the UDC (i.e., selecting on the independent variable). Moreover, I focus on monuments located in public spaces. This excludes monuments in cemeteries, museums, historical sites/battle grounds, and residential property. Public monuments are particularly important because they are seen as a reflection of local identity given the support—explicit or not—of the governing bodies and are, therefore, the most relevant for understanding the development of places.\n\nI built a unique dataset of public Confederate monuments located throughout the US South (as of 2017) using a variety of sources. I used the list from the Southern Poverty Law Center (2016) to start, but I improved it by using additional sources including: state-specific websites (e.g., http://docsouth.unc.edu/commland/) and books (Butler 2013; Civil War Centennial Commission of Tennessee 1963; Cohen 2003; Hagler 2014; Sedore 2011; Seigler 1997; Soderberg 1995; Widener 1982); an online database of historical markers (i.e., Historical Marker Database https://www.hmdb.org/); as well as Google maps and in person visits.\n\nThe final dataset includes 869 monuments, 856 of which include information on the year they were erected. Some counties have multiple monuments, but the bulk of counties that have a monument have only one (i.e., 76 percent). My analysis will focus on explaining the construction of the first public Confederate monument in a county, but I have conducted sensitivity analyses that include all monuments. Results are consistent with what is presented, which suggests that the added modeling complexity required to incorporate all monuments is not beneficial. I discuss this and related considerations further when describing the methods below.\n\nAlthough I have information on the specific year of a monument, I group monument construction by decade to facilitate analysis of the geographic and temporal patterns. I considered grouping years using major historical events instead. However, the result was longer periods, which risks masking important variation tied to racial tensions and political shifts—factors that vary substantially from decade to decade. Although not ideal, decades provide a clear point of reference and are short enough to capture the variation relevant to my analysis.2\n\nDistinguishing among the Ways in which Race Matters\n\nMy analysis includes time-constant and time-varying covariates. Time-constant covariates are observed at only one point, whereas time-varying covariates are observed at multiple points. The time-varying covariates have been gathered for all years/decades available starting in 1870 and ending in 2010.\n\nThe added temporal specificity of the time-varying covariates increases my ability to discern the timing of the underlying relationships. Specifically, I am able to focus on the instances of a variable that are temporally proximate to the construction of a given monument rather than all instances that precede or follow that event. This is particularly helpful when considering countermovement dynamics because there is an explicit expectation that a monument follows a clear manifestation of progress toward Black-White equality.\n\nRacial threat and the lost cause as a countermovement\n\nRacial threat is commonly measured using Blacks’ relative group size (e.g., Blalock 1967). However, I rely instead on variables related to the NAACP and school desegregation because these kinds of measures have been shown to be more effective and are most consistent with the countermovement perspective (e.g., Brown 2010; Cunningham 2012). I note that—by necessity—my variables focus on local manifestations of these movements and, therefore, do not capture the broader elements of racial threat/racism suggested by historical research (e.g., Mills and Simpson 2003; Shackel 2003).\n\nI retrieved the NAACP data through the Mapping American Social Movements Project (Gregory 2015). These data cover the 1910s through the 1960s. I code a county as one for each decade after the first NAACP chapter was established. Unfortunately, I cannot identify when or if a chapter was ever inactive during the period due to incomplete original records. As a result, a county that had an NAACP chapter in 1910, for example, remains coded as one for each subsequent decade. The value for this variable is zero for all counties prior to 1910.\n\nThe data on school desegregation—namely the timing of involuntary desegregation orders—are available starting in the 1950s. I retrieved the data from ProPublica (https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/school-desegregation-orders-data). The variable included in my analysis is a time-varying binary variable that is coded as one starting in the decade the desegregation order was placed for any school district in a county.3 The variable is reset to zero in the decade when the order is removed.4 Counties with an open desegregation order are coded as one through the most recent decade. The variable is zero for all counties in the decades prior to 1950.\n\nRacial hierarchy: the influence of White Dominance\n\nSlavery is the cornerstone of race and the racial hierarchy in the United States and was a key factor in the initiation of the Civil War. I use a time-constant measure of the concentration of enslaved people within the total population of a county in 1860 to estimate connections to the system of US slavery. A time-constant measure is unable to identify fluctuations in the extent of White dominance. However, more detailed measures of the contemporaneous position of Blacks and Whites are not consistently available across the examined decades. The original source of this variable is the 1860 US Census, but it has been adjusted subsequently to reflect contemporary county boundaries (O’Connell 2012; Reece and O’Connell 2016).\n\nThe local racial hierarchy is also visible through the level of extra-legal social control, which I capture using lynching estimates. Lynching, or the public murder of a (Black) person by a (White) mob, was a powerful form of social control in the US South used to maintain White dominance (Tolnay and Beck 1995; Tolnay, Deane, and Beck 1996). I employ a time-constant measure based on data compiled by the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) that cover lynchings from 1877 through 1950 (https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/explore). The EJI data have a wider temporal and geographic scope than other commonly used data, including data originally compiled by Beck and Tolnay (2004). Unfortunately, EJI does not identify the decade in which the lynchings associated with a particular county occurred despite the inclusion of specific dates on the EJI lynching memorial. The Beck and Tolnay (2004) data do include dates but only cover the 1880s through 1920s. Additional data collected by Seguin and Rigby (2019) cover a slightly wider temporal scope—up to 1941—and provide information on the year the event occurred. However, given the continued use of lynching as a form of racial terror well into the 1950s—with the most recent reported lynching occurring in 1981—I cannot use the decade-specific measures in my analysis because I would have to assume lynching ended after 1929 if I were to use the Beck–Tolnay data and after 1941 if I were to use the Seguin–Rigby data.\n\nBeyond Race(?)\n\nI account for additional variables in my analysis to better isolate the relationships characterized as explicitly “racial.” Drawing on social movement theory, I organize these variables around the concepts of “commemorative capacity” and “political capacity.” Commemorative capacity refers to the structure of a locality, and its ability to support monument construction (Ghoshal 2013). This is closely related to the concept of “mnemonic capacity” (Armstrong and Crage 2006) but refers to the capacity within places rather than the capacity of a movement. Historical research has primarily focused on the role of the UDC (see especially Cox 2003), but I expand this focus to include additional elements that may contribute to commemorative capacity (described below). Political capacity refers to the support available through political organizations. Historical research on Confederate monuments has been more concerned with political tensions—including the Populist movement during the late 1800s (Foster 1987; also see Winberry 2015 [1983])—but I provide a broader view of the political context in this analysis (described below).\n\nRace may still be considered a factor in each of these processes given the all-White composition of the UDC and the motivation to maintain racial divisions through politics. However, it is less centrally or at least differentially involved than when considering the countermovement and racial hierarchy hypotheses. Regardless of how they are conceived, accounting for these dynamics is critical to offering a comprehensive analysis of the processes underlying Confederate monument construction.\n\nCommemorative capacity\n\nThere are two key variables that relate to commemorative capacity. The first identifies the location of UDC chapters. The primary data source for identifying whether a county has a UDC chapter is the national UDC website (https://hqudc.org/divisions/). Some states were not linked through this website but current information could still be located online as of January 2019 (i.e., Arkansas, http://sites.rootsweb.com/&#x007E;arudc/Chapters.html; North Carolina, https://ncudc.org/blog/about/chapters/; and West Virginia, http://sites.rootsweb.com/&#x007E;wvudc/index.htm). Others did not offer current information publicly (i.e., Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia), but I used the most recently available division annual meeting minutes plus a book written on the history of the Georgia Division of the UDC (LaCavera 1995) to collect comparable data. The use of multiple sources provides complete coverage of the states/counties included in my analysis but has the limitation of reflecting chapters at different times.5 Despite their limitations, these are the best data available.\n\nThe second measure indicates whether or not a Civil War battle was fought within a county. The historical foundation associated with battles may increase the likelihood of residents erecting a public Confederate monument as a result of this history and other commemorative activities (e.g., museums) connected to the battle. I identified Civil War battles fought within a county’s boundaries using the following website: https://storymaps.esri.com/stories/civilwar/. The vast majority of counties had few if any Civil War battles. Ninety percent had zero, 6 percent had one, 3 percent had two, and 1 percent had three or more. I use a binary variable where counties that had no Civil War battles within their boundaries are coded as zero and all other counties are coded as one. Sensitivity analyses indicate that results are similar when using a continuous and categorical version of this variable.\n\nI considered including an estimate of the death toll or enlistment associated with a county, but such records—particularly ones that connect soldiers to their hometown—are notoriously incomplete for the Confederacy. The majority of estimates that have been generated are not available at the county-level (Hacker 2011), and those that have been cover only a subset of states (Larsen 2017). Fortunately, there is reason to expect that this variable would be positively correlated with the presence of a UDC chapter because the UDC was formed, in part, from Ladies Memorial Associations that were initiated in response to substantial local losses (Cox 2003; Foster 1987).\n\nPolitical capacity\n\nPolitical capacity reflects the political context in which social movements operate. This context will be relevant to the extent to which different political views shape the success of local movements to erect a Confederate monument. One way scholars characterize political capacity is by distinguishing among a stable, supportive context (i.e., the more conservative political party); a stable, unsupportive context; and instability that signals an opening for change (for a review see Tarrow 1988). I represent the variables on political capacity using a time-varying categorical variable indicating which counties were consistently “conservative” (reference) in a decade, consistently “liberal,” or “inconsistent.” Although not necessarily indicative of local political dynamics, I rely on presidential voting data to reflect dominant political trends. I employ a variety of data sources in order to cover all election years starting with 1872 and ending with 2008: ICPSR (Clubb, Flanigan, and Zingale 2006), the Atlas of US Presidential Elections (Leip n.d.), Polidata (Bensen 2005), CQ Press (http://library.cqpress.com/elections/), and the MIT Election Lab (https://electionlab.mit.edu/data). The “liberal” party is considered to be the Republican Party from 1872 until 1928 and the Democratic Party from 1932 onward. This temporal distinction in party alignment does not apply to local politics, particularly within the South, but is appropriate here since I focus on national elections.\n\nI identify consistently conservative counties as those with a majority of votes cast for the more conservative party in each of the presidential election years in a given decade (e.g., 1872 and 1876 comprise the years for the 1870s decade). Liberal counties are coded using the same logic but refer to places with a majority of votes in each election year for the more liberal party. Political instability, the inconsistent category, is reflected by any combination of majority conservative votes, majority liberal votes, and/or ties between the conservative and liberal parties across the election years for that decade. I also coded for counties that were consistently undecided (i.e., there was an even percentage of votes cast for the two major parties in all election years for that decade), but there is an insufficient number of instances to include it as a separate category. These cases are recoded as inconsistent.\n\nMethods\n\nDescriptive Analyses of Spatial and Temporal Variation\n\nPrevious research on Confederate monuments that employs largescale analyses has relied either on space or time separately (O’Connell and Forrest 2020; Winberry 2015 [1983]). I argue that both are necessary to accurately assess the underlying processes. I demonstrate this point while providing a foundation for the remainder of my analysis by presenting descriptive findings from a time trend, and a series of maps.\n\nEvent History Analysis\n\nEvent history analysis—also referred to as survival analysis, duration analysis, and hazard models—leverages temporal variation to offer better estimates of the relationships involved. In addition to allowing for the use of time-varying covariates, event history analysis provides estimates that are net of the broader time trend. This means that results are unaffected by the fact that an event is more likely to occur in one period than it is in another.\n\nEvent history analysis is relevant for answering any question related to the likelihood that an event occurs. In this case, I am asking whether a Confederate monument was erected in a public space in a county. I focus here on the dominant relationships that explain construction across the decades. Despite providing some tests of the extent to which processes differ in their relevance across the period (discussed further below), event history analysis primarily offers a summary of these relationships, thereby identifying the factors most consistently involved with the largest number of cases.\n\nAs noted previously, the presented results reflect relationships for the first monument in a county. The results are consistent when including all monuments in a model that accounts for the nested nature of the data (i.e., multiple monuments within a county); however, I conducted an additional test focusing solely on the second monument constructed in a county, conditional on there being one already. Those results offer additional insight into one key relationship, which I discuss in the results section. The remainder of the results is consistent with the presented model.\n\nThere are several different ways to construct event history models. I start by converting my data using the “stset” and “stsplit” commands in Stata. I then employ logistic regression to estimate a discrete-time event history model while controlling for the time dependence structure—which is essentially the overall likelihood of erecting a monument in a given decade—using a series of binary variables. All presented estimates are net of differences over time.\n\nOne key assumption of event history models is that the covariates in the model have the same relationship with the outcome over time (i.e., the proportional hazards assumption). Diagnostic tests indicate that proportion enslaved is the only variable that violates this assumption. I, therefore, interact slave concentration with time to better reflect its relationship with monument construction. Sensitivity analyses further assess differences in the observed relationships by separating the event history data into two periods—pre- and post-1950—indicate that the political context may have more explanatory power in the recent decades, but the relationship is not statistically different from what is observed in the earlier decades. The smaller number of monument construction events in the recent decades may explain why I find limited variation in some of the relationships when using a methodological approach that pools all observations into a single model, especially if the coefficients for the recent decades have large standard errors. I emphasize that my results provide but one view of these relationships and that future research should further consider the extent to which the identified dynamics differ across key historical periods.\n\nFor the event history analysis, I only include counties with constant boundaries between 1870 and 2010 (n = 559). This results in a substantial drop in the number of observations—a loss of 786 counties—yet it is necessary because event history analysis assumes that the observations are the same over time. I could have allowed new counties to enter in after the start of the observation period and others to drop out before 2017, but that would not address the issue of counties that exist throughout while changing size and therefore artificially affecting the values of variables. I considered using county clusters (i.e., aggregated units that reflect time-constant boundaries); however, they are unreasonably large in this case and would have little to no positive impact on the analysis. Fortunately, the distribution of the key variables is comparable across counties that did and did not experience boundary changes (available upon request). I identify counties with constant boundaries using a program described in Slez, O’Connell, and Curtis (2017).\n\nResults\n\nThere are 856 Confederate monuments located in public spaces (with information on the unveiling date), and they spread throughout the US South (see figure 1). The map presented in figure 1 shows the location of all the monuments that were standing as of 2017. The models presented below focus only on the first monument erected in a county, but I present all the monuments in the descriptive analysis for completeness. Each dot represents a distinct monument.\n\nThere is clear clustering in the states that line the East coast, namely Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. However, public Confederate monuments extend to the edge of nearly every border defining the US South. The top of Kentucky, and the tips of Florida and Texas are bare, but Delaware is the only southern state without a single public Confederate monument. The same can be said of Washington, DC.\n\nThe static picture presented in figure 1 provides valuable insight but masks variation over time. In figure 2, I display the number of monuments built in a given decade. The light gray bars indicate the total number of monuments, while the darker gray bars reflect the first monuments built in a county. The number of Confederate monuments erected in public spaces starts off small but increases dramatically around the turn of the century. During the 1870s—the first full decade when a monument could be erected—residents in 22 new counties erected a Confederate monument. Just 30 years later, during the early 1900s, 206 counties were added to the list of places with a public Confederate monument. This is the largest spike in a single decade. There is also a clear concentration of construction in the surrounding decades. However, I emphasize that it would be a mistake to assume that all the monuments shown in figure 1 were built in the same decade or even the same several decades.\n\nTo demonstrate this point further, I present maps from three distinct periods of monument construction, which I represent with the following decades: the 1900s, 1960s, and 2000s (see figures 3–5). Maps for additional decades are available upon request. In each decade, the spatial pattern of newly erected monuments—represented by the dark gray dots—is unique. There is broad coverage in the 1900s, such that there was a monument in every state except Delaware (see figure 3). This may be somewhat expected given the large number of monuments erected, but even this decade is not a random subset of the full distribution of monuments presented in figure 1. If that were the case, then there would be at least one monument in western Texas. Instead, that does not happen until the 1960s (see figure 4). In fact, all but two of the public monuments ever erected in western Texas are from the 1960s. Moreover, there are only 8 monuments—out of a total of 45—that were built in any state other than Texas in this decade. Finally, the 2000s suggest a spatial pattern similar to that of the early 1900s such that the distribution has broadened once again, but it is on a much smaller scale (see figure 5). Building from this understanding of the data, I leverage dimensions of both space and time in the following analysis to provide one test of the explanations for Confederate monument construction.\n\nWhat Explains Monument Construction?\n\nMy focus in the event history analysis is on identifying the factors that are related to the overall likelihood of erecting a Confederate monument in a public space. The presented coefficients refer to a unit increase in the log odds of erecting the first public Confederate monument in a county given a unit increase in the independent variable (see table 1). I note that all relationships are net of the broader time trend despite the exclusion of the corresponding coefficients from the presented table.\n\nIn contrast to the countermovement perspective, I do not find support for a (local) racial threat interpretation of monument construction. There is no relationship with the presence of an NAACP chapter or an active desegregation order (see table 1). Interestingly, the presence of an NAACP chapter evidences a significant, positive relationship when examining only the second monument erected in a county (available upon request). This suggests that when there was a second monument, it was more likely to be part of a reaction to local movements that threatened White dominance. I find no evidence of a separate, similar reaction to desegregation orders in this sensitivity analysis. An NAACP chapter may have been more visible and/or more threatening because it was a local development rather than an externally imposed order from the federal government.\n\nRace appears to be most broadly influential via the local power structure. The racial hierarchy of a county—as reflected in the legacy of slavery—is significantly, positively related to the construction of a public Confederate monument (see table 1). In fact, the concentration of enslaved people in 1860 is the strongest explanatory factor, second only to the presence of a UDC chapter (discussed below). However, there is a significant interaction with duration, which suggests this positive relationship weakens over time. The decline starts in the 1930s (4.51–3.89 = 0.62), but the relationship is not significantly weaker until the 1950s (4.51–7.41 = −2.90), 1990s (4.51–5.82 = −1.31), and 2000s (4.51–5.62 = −1.11). In contrast to my expectations, I do not find evidence that Confederate monuments are linked to lynching.\n\nCritically, this connection to racialized dynamics is net of other important factors that contributed to the establishment of Confederate monuments. Counties with a UDC chapter are more likely to have a public Confederate monument than counties without a UDC chapter (see table 1). The influence of the UDC is well documented by historical research (e.g., Cox 2003; Foster 1987), so the relationship is not surprising. However, it remains critical to understanding the social processes underlying Confederate monuments, including their role in a larger “memory movement” (Ghoshal 2013).\n\nInterestingly, there is no relationship between Civil War battles and having a public Confederate monument. This suggests that public monuments are largely unmotivated by active involvement in the Civil War. Other projects may have taken place—e.g., the establishment of a museum—but battles did not translate frequently into the kind of public recognition examined here.\n\nFinally, political capacity—as represented by trends in presidential voting—is far less relevant to monument construction than commemorative capacity (see table 1). Relative to counties where the majority of residents voted for the more conservative party’s candidate, majority liberal counties were less likely to construct a monument in that decade, but the relationship is imprecisely estimated (p < .10). Counties where voting patterns were inconsistent were no different in terms of their odds of erecting a monument. This is in contrast to some expectations (see, e.g., Foster 1987; Winberry 2015 [1983]), but it is consistent with Ghoshal’s (2013) assertion that memory movements are less influenced by political capacity than other types of social movements aimed more at political rather than cultural change.\n\nDiscussion\n\nConfederate monuments are the result of a larger memory movement aimed at altering perceptions of the Civil War, the South, and ultimately race. Historical research provides a foundation for understanding these connections (see especially Blight 2001; Brundage 2005; Cox 2003; Shackel 2003). However, my research adds new empirical evidence and a broader theoretical base to aid in developing how these divisive public symbols relate to contemporary society. Moreover, my results suggest a nuanced understanding of how race is involved that moves past the false dichotomy suggested by a “heritage versus hate” framing of the debate.\n\nI argue that Confederate monuments are socially—and not just historically—relevant because of their connections to public or collective memory (Brundage 2005; Cox 2011; Mills and Simpson 2003; Shackel 2003). The theoretical connection that I make here between Confederate monuments and memory movements is helpful in elaborating on this link because it elucidates how it is that collective memories associated with monuments become connected to local institutions—it is through the memory movement and its surrounding activities. Social movements are the mechanisms that draw monuments together with the (re)formation of social boundaries, policy changes, and ideological diffusion that ultimately affect places. The use of existing theory on path dependence and the development of place (Molotch et al. 2000) articulates how these historical actions become embedded in place and perpetuated over time. Monuments are not the only product of memory movements, but they are a strong indication of the success of a memory movement. In what follows, I elaborate on the specific connections to race to provide a clearer base from which to build theory on the racialized consequences of Confederate monuments.\n\nRace is tied to individual racism (i.e., “hate”), but also structural advantage that privileges Whites in the United States. My results suggest that local manifestations of threats to White dominance are minimally involved in understanding Confederate monument construction. They are only related to the construction of the second Confederate monument in a county. (White) Residents were more likely to erect a second Confederate monument after an NAACP chapter was established in a county. This is consistent with the larger countermovement literature, which suggests a (predominately) Black movement is frequently followed by a White countermovement (see, e.g., Andrews 2002), but it is in contrast to the broader narrative on Confederate monuments that suggests that racist countermovements are a dominant explanation.\n\nThat said, my results do not refute the importance of racism indicated by historical research (e.g., Mills and Simpson 2003; Shackel 2003). However, they do suggest that the majority of Confederate monuments were not built as part of a local countermovement in response to perceived racial threats (also see O’Connell and Forrest 2020). Extensions to this research should consider using case studies of monuments erected during the 1950s and 1960s to gather more direct evidence regarding the decision-making process. Moreover, quantitative methods could be used to focus on construction in specific decades to assess whether some processes—such as countermovement dynamics—were more or less relevant depending on the historical moment.\n\nInstead of framing (most) Confederate monuments as part of an anti-Black countermovement that responded to local manifestations of threat, my results suggest an emphasis on structural White advantage (also see Oliver 2017). I find that local variation in the racial hierarchy—namely the unequal access to power that privileges Whites as indicated by the legacy of slavery—is highly consequential. This is consistent with historical research demonstrating unequal support for White and Black memory movements (Blight 2001; Davis and Gross 2012; Roberts and Kytle 2012), and descriptive evidence indicating a higher concentration of monuments with Lost Cause inscriptions in the Deep South (O’Connell and Forrest 2020). Contexts where White dominance is more pronounced are more likely to support the construction of a symbol reflecting and reinforcing White dominance.\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of the ways in which race is involved has important implications for developing how Confederate monuments relate to contemporary society. The history of Confederate monuments and their connections to institutional racism suggest meaningful relationships between these divisive public symbols and racial inequality. Previous research examining Confederate monuments and contemporary Black–White poverty inequality supports this assertion (O’Connell 2020). With some qualifications, O’Connell (2020) finds that Black–White poverty inequality is higher in southern counties with a public Confederate monument. She states, “Confederate monuments may be related to aspects of racial inequality either through their influence on collective memories, or because of what they reflect about the history and institutions of a place” (O’Connell 2020: 462). My results provide generalizable support for this statement and reinforce the structural dimensions of why Confederate monuments are linked to contemporary Black–White inequality. By connecting previous research with the findings presented in this study, scholars can advance our understanding of the structural, deeply rooted causes of racial inequality.\n\nCoincidentally, my research also offers new insight into the literature on the legacy of slavery (e.g., Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen 2016; Kramer et al. 2017; O’Connell 2012; O’Connell, Curtis, and DeWaard 2020; Reece 2020; Reece and O’Connell 2016; Ruef and Fletcher 2003; Vandiver, Giacopassi, and Lofquist 2006). This literature focuses on the enduring influence of slavery after its abolition. My results are consistent with the findings of this literature but also suggest that the local connections between historical slavery and later outcomes have diminished over time. Scholars have argued that there are intervening mechanisms that facilitate or disrupt the transmission of historical legacies over time, which suggests the influence of specific economic, political, and demographic factors (Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen 2016; Gabriel and Tolnay 2017; O’Connell, Curtis, and DeWaard 2020; Petersen and Ward 2015). However, my results provide guidance for understanding the timing of when the local manifestation of the legacy of slavery began to weaken.\n\nI note that the contributions of this work are shaped by its limitations. I was unable to include a time-varying measure of lynching due to data limitations and ultimately find no evidence of a relationship with the construction of public Confederate monuments. However, I caution that this null relationship may not be characteristic of how the two correspond in specific periods. Future research should reassess this relationship by focusing on construction in early periods when decade-specific lynching data are available. Similarly, scholars could draw more attention to the political dynamics related to Confederate monument construction and consider alternative conceptualizations of the political context. For example, rather than framing the discussion around political capacity, future research may find that indicators of support for racialized policies (e.g., convict leasing, public segregation, restrictive voter registration) are more directly connected than is the broader political context.\n\nConfederate monuments are “just” symbols, but they are powerful symbols (also see Ladino 2019). My research suggests that they are intertwined with racialized social structures that advantage Whites. One might argue that Confederate monuments are merely a reflection of the local racial hierarchy. However, theoretical developments regarding how history constrains future choices and subsequently help to establish the character of a place (Molotch et al. 2000) suggest that the decision to support the placement of a monument to the Confederacy on public property could be consequential for a host of structural characteristics of a place (e.g., the location or existence of future/alternative monuments; local celebrations; educational exhibits). To the extent to which Confederate monuments reinforce the (racist) historical structure that supported their initial construction, we will be unable to address the inequality that stems from our history of supporting White dominance without first addressing the symbolic and material structures that support the false notion of White superiority. This understanding will be increasingly important as scholars continue studying the consequences of removing Confederate monuments from public spaces (e.g., de Velasco 2019; Maxson 2020; Sheehan and Speights-Binet 2019; Simko, Cunningham, and Fox 2020) and as we—as a society—continue to engage with the issue of how to address this history. The history behind Confederate monuments cannot be changed. However, the contemporary structures and memories that continue to support them—i.e., pro-White power structures and false understandings of the Civil War—can be.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHeather A.
