BOB BARR of georgia in the house of representatives Thursday, October 26, 2000 Mr. BARR of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the nation sits atop Myrtle Hill in Rome, Georgia, where the Etowah and Oostanaula rivers come together. The cemetery was opened in 1857 and is a National Register site. It is the resting place for more than 20,000 people who have shaped Georgia's history. The hill was purchased from Shorter College founder Alfred Shorter. The historic significance of the cemetery, combined with its beauty, makes it one of the most unique in the world. In one corner of the cemetery is a monument to General John Sevier, a Revolutionary War hero. During the Civil War almost 400 men were buried in the cemetery. Their graves, at the base of the hill near the entrance, are a silent tribute to the men, both Union and Confederate, who made the ultimate sacrifice. In 1901, the Xavier Chapter of the Daughters of American Revolution erected a monument in honor of General Sevier, and the marker is located in the southwest corner of the cemetery. A Confederate monument atop Myrtle Hill was erected by the Women of Rome as a memorial to the soldiers from Floyd County who lost their lives in defense of the Confederate States of America. A monument erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to the memory of General Nathan Forest for his bravery and valor in protecting the city from a siege by the Yankees also stands in the cemetery. There are 377 confederate soldiers, both from the north and south, who lost their lives while here or who were originally from Rome. Ellen Axon Wilson, first wife of President Woodrow Wilson, and who was a native of Rome is buried at Myrtle Hill. She is the only First Lady to be buried in the State of Georgia. After the First World War, Charles Graves, an infantryman from Rome, in the American Expeditionary Force, was killed near the French-German border. On October 15, 1918, he was given military honors and buried in France. I March 1922, his remains were returned to U.S. soil. The American people thought something should be done to prevent wars, and the notion of honoring an Unknown Soldier and a Known Soldier, was developed. An Unknown Soldier was selected in France, and his body was enshrined in Arlington National Cemetery in Washington in 1932. It was decided that one of the bodies from the final troopship would be selected as the Known Soldier. A sailor was blindfolded, asked to run his hand down a long roster of names and when his finger stopped on one name, that one would become America's Known Soldier of the World War. The moving finger stopped on the name of Charles W. Graves of Rome, Georgia. However, his mother preferred to have his remains brought home to Rome, rather than be interred at Arlington. Charles Graves' coffin was taken from the troopship with special care, covered with the American flag, and carefully placed on a special carriage drawn by six white horses. An honor guard, made up of U.S. Army generals, accompanied his coffin down the streets of New York City. Admirals of the Navy, Generals of the Marines, Governors from various U.S. States, five U.S. Senators, four Representatives of Congress, the Secretary of War, and the Mayor of New York, all watched as thousands of soldiers, veterans, dignitaries, and Gold Star mothers descended upon the city. When the coffin finally stopped, President Warren G. Harding spoke about Charles Graves and all the others who had paid the ultimate price for freedom. When the ceremonies were complete, the body of Charles Graves was loaded onto a southbound train and a day later it pulled into Rome. He was buried in a small cemetery outside of Rome. After his mother's death, the body was moved to Myrtle Hill Cemetery; where it has been to this day. Thirty-four magnolia trees were planted around the grave to [[Page 25348]] represent the 34 Floyd County residents who died during World War I. Every year since, the patriotic spirit of the citizens of Rome and Floyd County is displayed when families, loved ones, friends, and military veterans, make their ways to Myrtle Hill Cemetery on November 11th to honor America's fallen war heroes. This tradition has been passed from one generation to the next, and parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles are proud to bring young family members to Myrtle Hill, and to tell them the stories of the Known Soldier, Charles W. Graves, and those of others who fought for the freedom, and peace, we should cherish each and every day. ____________________"
