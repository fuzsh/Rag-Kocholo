        "text": "Summary+\n\nAs of May 2021, 736 physical monuments and over 1000 other state-sponsored memorials to the Confederate States of America remain in the United States. Most of these markers were built as terror tactics targeting Black Americans during the post-Reconstruction and Civil Rights Movement eras of the twentieth century, long after the end of the Civil War and the Confederacy. Some of the reasons why Confederate markers and support for them persist in the public square are general unfamiliarity with Civil War history, widespread negationist history narratives, and state laws prohibiting local governments from altering Confederate monuments. Although Confederate markers ostensibly memorialize the past, they inflict racialized harm in the present, including worse health among Black Americans, economic losses, funds for pro-Confederate organizations, and the attention of violent White supremacy. Leading practices for alleviating these consequences include proposals to relocate Confederate monuments to museum settings and protests calling for marker removal.\n\nKey Takeaways+\n\nOver 1,800 public Confederate markers remain in the United States, including 736 physical monuments.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of public Confederate markers were built during periods of reactionary White supremacy and anti-Black violence.\n\nGeneral unfamiliarity with Civil War history, widespread negationist narratives, and state laws forbidding marker alteration all contribute to the continued presence of and support for public Confederate markers in America.\n\nPublic Confederate markers have been connected to worse health, economic losses, and violent White supremacy.\n\nProtestors have called for governments to remove Confederate markers from public settings, and some advocates recommend relocating Confederate monuments to museums or similar institutions.\n\nImpact analysis is limited, and more research is needed about the consequences of public Confederate markers and the outcomes of efforts to remove them.\n\nKey Terms+\n\nAllostatic Load—“The cumulative wear and tear on the body’s systems owing to repeated adaptation to stressors,” or “the physiological burden imposed by stress.”1\n\nBlack–White Poverty Inequality—A measure of local income inequality between Blacks and Whites. Higher values represent greater Black disadvantage.2\n\nLost Cause—A negationist history of the Civil War and American South that portrays the Civil War as a “noble endeavor” fought primarily to defend states’ rights and Southern honor, denying the historical reality that Confederate secession was rooted in defending institutional slavery and Black–White inequality.3\n\nGross Domestic Product—The “total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period . . . it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given country’s economic health.”4\n\nMunicipal Government—An “urban unit of local government,” typically meaning a city government.5\n\nNegationist History—Distortion, falsification, or other misrepresentation of history.6 “Historical negationism” carries the same meaning.\n\nPublic Confederate Marker—Any public memorial to the Confederate States of America or to their cause, soldiers, or leaders. This description includes statues, monuments, parks, sites, Confederate flags, holidays, state songs, and namesakes, such as buildings, bases, schools, or streets named after Confederate themes or figures. “Symbol” or “memorial” conveys the same meaning.\n\nSons of Confederate Veterans—A men’s Confederate heritage group formed in the 1890s.7 Like the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Sons promoted Lost Cause negationism and venerated Confederate memory, though it never achieved the United Daughters’ level of success and prominence.8 The group is still active in the twenty-first century.9\n\nUnited Daughters of the Confederacy—A women’s Confederate heritage group “formed in 1894 to protect and venerate Confederate memory following the American Civil War” that, among other initiatives, fundraised, established, and maintained Confederate markers, such as monuments and museums, and promoted Lost Cause negationism as “correct” history.10 The group is still active in the twenty-first century.11\n\nFinally, there are also today still some who look to Confederate markers as heritage markers; recognizing that reality as part of people’s lived experience is relevant, as communities theoretically can imbue landscape features with meanings that may change over time.27 However, while some claim Confederate markers are non-racial emblems of Southern heritage, Black Americans do not share that interpretation; instead, Black Americans experience Confederate markers like the battle flag as racist symbols of prejudice.28 Black Americans report that Confederate markers are insulting, offensive, and embarrassing. In an instructive anecdote, a Black American observed that he received “surprised and confused looks” from neighbors when he moved onto a street with a statue of Robert E. Lee, a general of the Confederate army during the Civil War.29 In July 2020, a majority of Black American respondents in a nationwide poll agreed that public monuments linked to Confederate generals should be removed.30 Furthermore, Confederate markers’ implication in violent, White supremacist activity—such as the 2017 Unite the Right rally—casts further doubts on the supposed non-racial purpose of these markers (see Consequences: Attracting Violent White Supremacy below in this brief).31 Finally, modern research consistently connects public Confederate markers to ongoing harm against marginalized communities of color (see Consequences below in this brief).32 Acknowledging these realities is immensely important and provides cause for examining Confederate markers more closely.\n\nRemoval From the Public Square\n\nWidespread advocacy for the total removal of public Confederate markers from the public square has existed since 2015 but has especially gained strength since the summer of 2020 and the nationwide surge of Black Lives Matter protests.104 Since George Floyd’s death in May 2020, 168 public Confederate markers have been removed from the public square.105 This solution is premised on the idea that public markers exercise psychosocial power by virtue of their placement in public places of prominence.106 (For example, many public Confederate markers are statues in front of courthouses, monuments by major thoroughfares, and names of public buildings.107) Advocates assert that removing Confederate markers from public display will prevent them from inflicting stress on Black Americans as well as from signalling approval of racism to communities.108\n\nImpact\n\nCurrent evidence in support of relocation is anecdotal but points toward positive impacts, at least for individuals.119 However, without further assessment, the extent to which relocation would reverse public Confederate markers’ negative consequences remains theoretical. Some writers have anecdotally claimed that there is less racism in Europe and even attributed this to the public memorial landscape.120 For example, post–World War II German society physically “de-Nazified” the country by removing swastikas from public display, demolishing statues, and destroying flags.121 However, whether America is more or less racist than Europe remains a matter more of public perception than data (how one would comparatively measure is not clear, and some dispute the claim itself), and even if one assumes the claim is true, there is not clear data that isolates part of that difference to monument removal.122 Nevertheless, as one history professor observes, “if just removing statues and icons doesn’t force a change in outlook,” as with Germany and Nazi imagery, then “venerating and fetishizing them, and refusing to be honest about their meaning,” as with the United States and public Confederate markers, “almost ensures that the country won’t fully confront its past.”123 Therefore, the potential correlation between monument removal and alleviating the Consequences described in this brief remains worth considering.\n\nSecond, museums’ perceived authority may unintentionally reinvigorate Confederate markers as symbols, therefore subverting the attempt to disempower them through relocation. Patrons often look to museums as places of pride and honor, so instead of turning markers into artifacts, museum displays might make monuments into martyrs and museums into mourning grounds for neo-Confederates and other sympathizers.126 In this case, relocation would merely transplant Confederate markers without disempowering their racist messages.127 For example, in Memento Park, even in 2001, guests could buy T-shirts commemorating Nikita Khrushchev, former president of the Soviet Union.128 Such paraphernalia seems less like somber insight into a terrible history and more like kitschy nostalgia for a half-remembered past, and a scholar criticized the park for being more like a “tourist attraction” than a “professional exhibition.”129 This problem already seems to haunt heritage sites like Beauvoir (see Consequences: Financing Pro-Confederate and Negationist History Messages).130 Additionally, because American opinion on Confederate monuments and the Civil War itself remains polarized, attempts to recontextualize public Confederate markers may be especially prone to misuse.131 Maintaining a balance between using public Confederate markers as historical documents and repudiating Lost Cause–inspired negationist revivals of racist messages may be more precarious than would seem on the surface.\n\nAnother alternative is foregoing relocation and instead adding contextualizing signage, such as plaques describing the history of slavery and the Lost Cause. Advocates of this approach say signs can challenge the Lost Cause narrative which public Confederate markers communicate, weakening their psychosocial power.133 However, critics argue signage is insufficient to overcome public Confederate markers’ effects. Some markers, such as monuments, are too massive and too offensive for explanatory plaques to make a difference to the people who see them.134 However, many cities contend with repressive anti-removal laws that prohibit taking public Confederate markers out of the public square at all (see Contributing Factors: State Laws Prohibiting Marker Removal by Local Authorities).135 For municipal governments where removal is impossible, adding contextualizing signage may be the most viable option to lessen Confederate markers’ psychosocial effects.\n\nGaps\n\nBy Take ’Em Down NOLA’s own reporting, over 5 years it has seen the removal of less than half of its target statues, and none of its 70 target namesakes have had name changes.144 Compared to the over 1,800 public Confederate markers that remain in the United States, Take ’Em Down’s protest efforts seem ineffective at solving the broader social issue in the short term.145 Additionally, Take ’Em Down is intentionally local, meaning its efforts focus solely on New Orleans; spreading Take ’Em Down’s influence would require replication across many other cities. As for long-term change, it is too early to make a judgment on recent statue removal initiatives’ impacts or gaps, and more research and data are needed."
