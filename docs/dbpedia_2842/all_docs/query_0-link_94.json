J. K. Hillers.\"\n\nFollowing a series of national protests against police brutality and racism in policing in the summer of 2020, statues of Confederate generals throughout the United States were damaged or destroyed by protesters or removed by local officials. Though the Virginia Military Institute had long avoided calls to remove the statue, allegations of racial hostility and cultural insensitivity at the military college caused officials to rethink their positions. On December 7, 2020, the Stonewall Jackson statue was removed from VMI with plans to relocate to a local museum and battlefield site.\n\nThis primary source comes from the Records of the Bureau of Public Roads.\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 135804650\n\nFull Citation: 'Stonewall' Jackson Statue at Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, VA; 1912 (Photograph 1935); States - Virginia (continued); Historical Photograph Files, 1896 - 1963; Records of the Bureau of Public Roads, ; National Archives at College Park, College Park, MD.

In this bronze pedestrian statue, General Pike is shown in civilian dress and presented as a masonic leader rather than a militaryman. Pike stands 11 feet tall upon a high granite pedestal. Below his feet, about half way down the west face of the pedestal, sitting on a ledge is the allegorical Goddess of Masonry, holding the banner of the Scottish Rite. Pike holds a book in his left hand.\n\nPike was the only Confederate general to be so honored in Washington, DC. The statue stirred controversy since it was first installed. In 2020, protestors pulled down the Pike statue and set it on fire. The National Park Service later removed the statue, leaving the pedestal in place.\n\nThis photo and description are part of materials from the \"Civil War Monuments in Washington, DC\" registration form in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThis primary source comes from the Records of the National Park Service.\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 117692047\n\nFull Citation: Albert Pike Memorial, Washington, DC; 1901 (photo taken 1976); National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmarks Program Records: Washington, DC; National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmarks Program Records, 2013 - 2017; Records of the National Park Service, ; National Archives at College Park, College Park, MD.

However, after the prisoner exchange agreement between the North and South was ended in July 1863, Camp Chase began to be a permanent prison camp for military and political prisoners loyal to the Confederacy. By the end of the war, nearly 26,000 Confederate soldiers were housed in a prison designed for 8,000 men. Punitive practices (such as reduced rations) in retaliation for mistreatment of Union captives in Confederate prisons led to many soldiers suffering from malnutrition. Many died from smallpox, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and exposure to the elements. In all, 2,260 soldiers died at Camp Chase.\n\nA cemetery, established in 1863, is surrounded by a stone wall built in 1921. Within it are enclosed the graves of 2,199 Confederate soldiers who died while prisoners of war. A memorial arch of granite blocks, unveiled in 1902, spans a large boulder. Above the arch rests a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier facing south, and on the keystone of the arch is the inscription— AMERICANS.

The angel stands barefooted on a sphere. Her right arm is raised up and holds a wreath of victory, while her left hand is pointing down and holds atrumpet. She is wearing a victory wreath on her head and a long flowing robe on her body. The soldier is dressed in a Confederate uniform and carries a flagpole and flag in both hands.

He is standing in front of a broken wagon wheel.\n\nThe front of the base contains the inscription \"CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS OF ARKANSAS 1861 - 1865.\" The right side of the base is inscribed, \"Our furled banner wreathed with glory and though conquered we adore it. Weep for those who fell before it, pardon those who trail and tore it.\" On the left side of the base is inscribed, \"Arkansas remembers the faithfulness of her sons and commends their example to future generations.\"\n\nIn June 2020, following a series of national protests against police brutality and racism in policing, a petition to remove Confederate statues from the Arkansas State Capitol grounds to a more appropriate location was posted to Change.org.
