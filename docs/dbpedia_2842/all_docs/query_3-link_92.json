        "text": "North Carolina’s first Confederate monument was removed from a Fayetteville cemetery this week, more than 150 years after it was dedicated.\n\nThe monument in Cross Creek Cemetery No. 1 was taken down Tuesday at the owner’s request, according to Nacarla Webb, a city spokeswoman.\n\nThe monument was dedicated in December 1868, according to the National Register of Historic Places. The cemetery at Cool Spring and Grove streets is on the register.\n\nWebb said the monument is privately owned. She would not say who the owner is.\n\n“It’s also not appropriate to speak to why they removed the monument,” she said in an emailed response to questions about the removal. “That would be for them to respond.”\n\nThe city helped remove the monument at the private organization’s request, Webb said.\n\nThe removal comes as Confederate monuments across the country are facing scrutiny. Some statues and other markers have been taken down by protesters in recent weeks.\n\nA statue that was put up in 1902 in memory of Confederate soldiers from Cumberland County who were killed in the war was taken down June 27. It also is privately owned.\n\nThe monument that was in the cemetery differs from Confederate memorials that were placed in more public places, said W. Fitzhugh Brundage, the William B. Umstead Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“This is a memorial to the dead as opposed to a monument to the Confederacy,” he said. “This is a monument of mourning, as opposed to a monument of celebration. That’s a crucial distinction.”\n\nBrundage, who is working on a project intended to help people learn about monuments in North Carolina, said the monument was an early example of efforts by groups of women to give Confederate soldiers who died on battlefields a proper burial. The organizations had focused on making clothes and raising money for military supplies during the war, he said.\n\nThe monument was in the military section of the cemetery, which is known as the “Confederate Cemetery,” according to a nomination form on the National Register of Historic Places website.\n\n“Just after the close of the Civil War, a group of patriotic women in Fayetteville wished to honor the many soldiers who had been killed in battle and were buried in various locations or had died in hospitals in Fayetteville and were buried in Cross Creek Cemetery Number One,” the form said. “The bodies were reinterred in the eastern edge of the cemetery overlooking the Cross Creek.”\n\nThe women raised money for the monument by making a silk quilt and raffling it off, according to the form. The 10-foot monument was designed by George Lauder, a prominent Fayetteville stonecutter. It has a marble base and is topped with a cross, the form said.\n\nBrundage said a poem on the monument focuses on sacrifice. Most people would not know the monument is for Confederate soldiers just by looking at it, he said.\n\n“I think it would be a shame if Confederate graves and cemeteries started being desecrated,” he said."
