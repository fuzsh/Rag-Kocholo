Almost every family had a son, husband, sweetheart, brother, or father away at war. However, for those men and particularly women who remained behind, the Civil War made life more difficult and very different than they were used to.\n\nWith so many men at war, women began to take on more and more responsibility. In the South, rich women would often take charge of the plantations, serving as plantation masters and managing vast numbers of slaves while their husbands were away at war. Meanwhile, poor women took on the back-breaking strain of agricultural labor, often doing work that their husbands and sons would normally have done. In the North, women took over the brunt of manufacturing jobs and were vital to the success of the war effort to supply the Union army.\n\nFamilies on the home front faced shortages of every kind as both the Union and Confederate armies struggled to feed and outfit their troops. This was particularly severe in the South, as the Union navy blockaded the Southern states to prevent any sort of European goods from being imported to the South.\n\nOf course, those on the home front lived in a constant state of fear over the prospect that their loved ones away at war would be killed. Newspaper reading reached an all-time high as people scanned the newspapers every day for any scrap of news that might mention their loved ones or their regiment.\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War (apart from the brief period of “Reconstruction” in the South) things largely returned to normal. However, the taste of independence that women had during the Civil War would revitalize the suffragette (women’s right to vote) movement in the succeeding decades of the nineteenth century.\n\nSuggestions for Using Streaming Audio and Lyrics\n\nHave the students listen to and read the lyrics to some of Stephen Foster’s songs dealing with the concerns of home front life. Compare these songs to the Southern home front songs “The Homespun Dress” and “The Southern Soldier Boy.” Ask the students to consider the following questions while listening to/reading the songs:\n\nThink About Tone\n\nWhat is the mood of each song? Is it happy? Sad?\n\nIs the song fast or slow?\n\nHow does listening to/reading the lyrics of the song make you feel?\n\nThink About the Words\n\nWhat viewpoint is presented in each song?\n\nWhat concerns do the songs express?\n\nDo you think these are common concerns for the time?\n\nAre the verses long or short?\n\nIs there a chorus? If so, does it repeat? What point does the chorus try to make?\n\nThink About the Songs\n\nMany of these songs reflect concerns that family members have over those at war. What seems to be their attitude towards the war?\n\nIn the song “The Homespun Dress” the narrator turns a negative (the material shortages) into a positive (making her own clothes). Why do you think this was necessary?\n\nHow does the parent in “My Boy is Coming from the War” react to that news?\n\nHow do you think “The Southern Soldier Boy” could be used for propaganda purposes?\n\nSuggested Points for Discussion\n\nHow did life change for women during the Civil War?\n\nWhat were some of the unique challenges faced by those on the home front during the Civil War?\n\nDiscuss how the songs balanced the modern concepts of “supporting the troops” while calling for them to come home.\n\nDiscuss the difficulty of receiving current news during the Civil War era.\n\nCompare these songs to current songs about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (suggestions include “American Soldier” by Toby Keith, “10,000 Years (Peace is Now)” by Live, and “My City of Ruins” by Bruce Springsteen.\n\nHow does \"Across Five Aprils\" reflect the ideas discussed in this lesson plan?\n\nSuggested Assignments/Classroom Activities\n\nThinking Creatively About History: Have the students write their own stories, poems or songs written from the viewpoint of someone on the home front. Make sure they address some of the major topics (the new role of women, shortages, family members away at war) in their work.\n\nLinking the Past and Present: Have the students write a short essay comparing the home front during the “War on Terror” today and the home front during the Civil War as presented in the lesson plan.\n\nAnalyzing Primary Sources: Have each student choose one of the home front songs or assign one to each student and ask them analyze song, explaining both factual data about the song as well as evaluating the purpose of the song and whether or not they think the song would be successful in achieving its purpose.\n\nAnalyzing Primary Sources- Show students copies of the Lilly Martin Spencer's painting \"The War Spirit at Home: Celebrating Victory at Vicksburg” and Winslow Homer's “Our Watering Places-The Empty Sleeve at Newport.” Ask them to write a short essay analyzing what the artist was saying about the new roles women were taking. Why did they need to take more responsibility?\n\nCompare and Contrast: Have the students write a short essay comparing one of the Southern home front songs (“The Homespun Dress” or “The Southern Soldier Boy”) to one of the Northern home front songs. What concerns do they have in common? What are the differences between the two?\n\nSpecial Assignments/Activities for \"Across Five Aprils\""
