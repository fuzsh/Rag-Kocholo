        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe monument of a Confederate soldier was erected in 1906 at the main entrance to the University of Mississippi campus, beside its administration building.\n\nThe statue has become a focal point for numerous protests since the Civil Rights period. During the desegregation riot at the University in 1962, opponents of integration fled to the statue after U.S. Marshalls fired tear gas in an effort to disperse them. Several decades on, it became contested by students and faculty staff in 2014-2015, who felt aggrieved that the statue commemorated soldiers that fought to uphold American slavery during the Civil War of 1861-1865.\n\nAssessment of options\n\nA 2014 action plan put forward by the University had proposed to provide historical context to some of the University’s Confederate symbols throughout the campus. This had proposed to “offer more history, putting the past into context” and to do so “without attempts to erase history, even some difficult history.”\n\nFollowing ongoing pressure from students opposed to the statues, this then led to the installation of a contextual reinterpretation plaque in March 2016, written and commissioned by a small, private committee.\n\nCritics of the process, however, forced the administration to revise the plaque a few months later in June 2016. Later that same summer, a Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on History and Context was also established to recommend additional historic sites on campus that were in need of contextualisation and to oversee the design of reinterpretation content.\n\nThe committee was prohibited by the Chancellor from discussing the relocation of the statue, though this was not public information.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, new student campaigns then began for the relocation of the statue and steadily gained momentum, with calls to move the monument to a nearby Confederate cemetery, on a remote part of campus.\n\nMississippi Code 55-15-81, a law that state legislators passed with bi-partisan support in 2004, states that any monument honouring the “War Between the States” erected on public property cannot be “relocated, removed, disturbed, altered, renamed or rededicated.” However, it also states that “the governing body may move a memorial to a more suitable location if it is determined that the location is more appropriate to displaying the monument.” The Deputy Attorney General stated in 2017 that Confederate monuments could be relocated under the code as long as they remain on ‘similar public property’. These ambiguities were a central focus of debate, about which options were possible and lawful.\n\nThere was debate about which governing body or bodies had the authority to determine the outcome. An external body, the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL) claimed jurisdiction, so that relocation would be possible on their approval of proposals made by the Chancellor of the University. Some state legislators contested this claim, but this was the process that was followed.\n\nThis first plaque was commissioned and erected, during a spring break (2016), with little if any prior notice or communication. Quickly afterwards, there was criticism raised, in part highlighting imbalanced focus on events in 1962-63, rather than the erection of the monument itself in 1906. After criticism of the faculty and student protests, the University accepted that there had been little student or faculty awareness of the committee, insufficient opportunity for stakeholders to input on the text, and that the wording should be changed.\n\nAcademics at the University of Mississippi undertook new detailed research over the next two months, which uncovered new sources and material, particularly about the motives and public arguments of those who put the statue up in 1906. The new Chancellor of the University then commissioned a new, second plaque in June 2016.\n\nWording of the second plaque:\n\nIn March 2019, the Associated Student Body voted unanimously for the relocation of the monument, to a less prominent location on campus, the Confederate cemetery.\n\nThis led the Graduate Student Council, the Staff Council and the Faculty Senate to pass similar resolutions. “I know there have been lots of questions about whether we are trying to erase history, and that is simply not our goal. Our goal is to move history to a place where it is contextually appropriate so that we can begin to have conversations without yelling at each other and (without) having this beacon of conflict in the center of our campus”, said one of the proponents of relocation.\n\nState politicians were actively involved, from opposing perspectives.\n\nBetween April and August 2019 the University engaged with the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, securing a permit for the proposed relocation plan. But in January 2020, the IHL sought to postpone a decision, seeking more information on broader contextualisation efforts, and recommending plans be expanded to develop the cemetery, for example by paving a walkway to the graveyard, creating a memorial to Black soldiers that served in the Civil War and, most importantly, installing new headstones for fallen Confederate servicepeople.\n\nNo decision had been made when the COVID pandemic began, reducing the focus on the empty campus. However, in May 2020, the murder of George Floyd and the protests that followed, coupled with criticism about the plans to aggrandise the Confederate cemetery, led the University authorities to move the decision up the agenda. This directly led to the vote taken by the IHL and the subsequent relocation of the statue in July 2020, along with its 2016 reinterpretation plaque.\n\nPublic response\n\nCampaigns and counter-campaigns about the statue reflect a polarisation of views. This was made more challenging by a strong consensus on campus, for reinterpretation and relocation, but also a much more contested debate in wider state politics and public discourse, which was open to reinterpretation but sceptical about relocation. The University rapidly accepted criticism of the absence of a process of consultation about the March 2016 plaque. There was greater engagement with the second, redrafted plaque erected in June. However, the reinterpretation did not address the primary focus of challenges to the statue, which were based on its size and the prominence of its location.\n\nIn February 2019, there were protests by pro-Confederacy groups, Confederate 901 and the Hiwaymen, marching to the statue, with banners saying ‘Protect Our Heritage’. These were met by a large counter-protest, whose signs included ‘A Change is Gonna Come’. This was tense, with concerns about safety and violence, but passed peacefully. The University’s men’s basketball team ‘took the knee’ during the national anthem at a game as a direct response to the pro-Confederate protest, which increased awareness of the campaign for relocation and mobilised wider support from University students."
