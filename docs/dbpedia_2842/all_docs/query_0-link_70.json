        "text": "The Confederate monument outside the Wilson County Courthouse has been the source of many years of controversy. After decades of residing there, the county removed it just weeks after people protested and asked for its removal.\n\nThe monument was commissioned by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1926.\n\nLeslie Jones has lived in the City of Wilson for years and has a rich past.\n\n\"I am a Vietnam Veteran,\" Jones said.\n\nWRAL asked him what he thought about the removal of the Confederate monument.\n\n\"I'm elated,\" he said. \"I think it should have been removed.\"\n\nFor Jones, the Confederate flag embossed on the monument felt personal.\n\n\"These same people fought for my ancestors to stay in slavery,\" Jones said.\n\nAfter months of discussion, Wilson County issued a statement last week announcing its decision to remove the monument. Its removal cost about $13,000.\n\n\"The Wilson County Board of Commissioners has been researching and studying issues related to the memorial fountain on the grounds of the Wilson County Courthouse for many months,\" Chairman Rob Boyette said. \"Historically, the segregated memorial fountain has been offensive to some of our citizens. Through consultation with our legal counsel, our board has reached a consensus that the time has come for moving the memorial fountain and for it to be stored in order to preserve and protect it.\"\n\nA county spokesperson said state law requires its preservation but did not mention where the monument is being kept.\n\nDaniel Graham said he can only think of one place where the monument should reside.\n\n\"It should be like in a museum or something. That is the only place I could see it. In a museum, people can come by and see it and understand the history of it,\" Graham said.\n\nWRAL spoke with another person outside the courthouse who said they felt it was an important piece of history, and it did not need to be removed from where it sat for so long.\n\nGraham tells us he used the monument to educate his children when they would walk by.\n\n\"They ask me what it stands for,\" he said. \"They have to understand what it stands for.\"\n\nGraham said he feels proud that the county chose to remove it.\n\nWRAL asked the county about plans to relocate the monument, but they did not provide any information."
