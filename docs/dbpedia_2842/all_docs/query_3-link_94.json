        "text": "Instead of watching the latest City Council meetings about whether to remove a Women of the Confederacy monument from Springfield Park, I decided to go back in time — back 100 years to when this and other similar monuments were erected across the South.\n\nAt some point during the current debate, it began to feel like we were going around in circles, with the same statements being made again and again from council members, from those citizens who want to Take ‘Em Down to those who want to Keep ‘Em Up.\n\nI wondered what those who Put ‘Em Up said at the time.\n\nMore: Jacksonville City Council members line up against moving Confederate monument from park\n\nNate Monroe: City Council, choosing ignorance, moves to keep Confederate monument on display\n\nSo I went to a time machine — OK, the microfilm at the University of North Florida library, and the online database of newspapers.com.\n\nThe full City Council will vote Tuesday on approving $1.3 million for removal of this monument. Judging from the non-binding votes in three recent committee meetings — 10 members against the mayor's request for removal, only four supporting it — the monument will stay where it has stood since 1915.\n\nThis frequently has been framed as a matter of preserving history, of not erasing pieces of the past just because we don't like it. But in many ways, that already has been done.\n\nIt's worth going back to 1915 — 50 years after the end of the Civil War — and getting some more of the history, directly from the mouths and pens of those who put up the monuments of that era.\n\n'It tells for all time to come the deathless love of Dixie’s veterans for Dixie’s matchless women'\n\nOn the Sunday before the dedication, the front page of the local section of the Times-Union included seven stories about plans for Tuesday, Oct. 26, 1915.\n\n“Great Throng to Attend the Unveiling of Memorial to the Women of the Confederacy,” the top headline said.\n\nMayor J.E.T. Bowden declared it a city holiday, giving government employees the afternoon off and requesting that businesses keep their doors closed during the unveiling. Plans for a parade were announced. A women’s committee asked for the use of automobiles. A letter from a veteran to the City Council implored Jacksonville citizens to show up for the event.\n\nThe board of trustees of the Women’s Monument, from the Florida division of the United Confederate Veterans, gave a statement about what people would see when the monument was unveiled.\n\n“No state of the Southern Confederacy can point to its equal in grandeur of proportions, or chastity in artistic design,” it said. “Mute but eloquent, it tells for all time to come the deathless love of Dixie’s veterans for Dixie’s matchless women.”\n\n‘Lasting significance of this memorial &mldr; the memories it keeps fresh’\n\nThe Wednesday edition of the Times-Union devoted several pages to coverage of the dedication of the monument.\n\nIt described the parade as “one of the most pleasing features of the unveiling ceremonies” — with “the machines” gathering at the corner of Laura and Monroe streets, and then making their way from Hemming Park (now James Weldon Johnson Park) to Confederate Park (now Springfield Park).\n\n“When the signal was given, a squad of police led the way down Laura Street,” the story said. “The veterans were loudly cheered along the line of march and especially at the park where the parade ended.”\n\nMore: City Council renames Hemming Park after James Weldon Johnson\n\nMore: Confederate statue removed from Hemming Park. Curry says others in Jacksonville will also be removed.\n\nThe coverage said that between 5,000 to 7,000 people gathered in the park — and that they remained mostly quiet until Miss Jessie Palmer Patridge pulled a lanyard, dropping the veil from the figures on the monument.\n\n“Amid the yells could be distinctly heard the cheer of the veterans, whose years had not dulled the clear sound of the famous rebel yell, which during the war wrought tingles of dismayed fear up and down the spines of many a Union soldier,” the story said.\n\nSen. Duncan Fletcher, who had become a U.S. Senator after serving as Jacksonville’s mayor during the Great Fire of 1901, gave one of the day’s speeches.\n\n“My friends,” he began, “this occasion calls to mind all the sweetest, noblest and highest qualities of human character and that they were illustrated by the women of the Confederacy.”\n\nHe went on to say of the monument: “The deep and lasting significance of this memorial is not found in its beauty, attractive as that is, nor in the material, costly or otherwise, composing it, but in the spirit and sentiment back of it all; in the memories it keeps fresh, the lessons it will teach, the principles it will inspire and the ideals it interprets.”\n\n‘Far more indestructible than polished stone or tempered bronze’\n\nTheo T. Turnbull delivered the “Oration of the Day.” Turnbull, whose family owned a large cotton plantation near Tallahassee, began by explaining why he was invited to speak.\n\nAs a state representative, he helped secure funding for the monument — even additional money when the monument’s organizers came up short.\n\nThe United Confederate Veterans initially proposed a $10,000 monument, asking the state to pay half. That sum, Turnbull said, was “most readily appropriated.”\n\nThe UCV members then decided they “could not express their appreciation for such a cause” with $10,000. They came up with a new design, with a price tag of $24,000 and asked the state to pay for half of it. State legislators again agreed.\n\nWhen the monument was completed, the UCV committee was unable to pay its half. So members went before the legislature in 1915 and asked for taxpayers to pay the balance due on the monument.\n\nTurnbull said he and his peers gladly agreed. So there he was, giving the oration of the day.\n\n“Far more indestructible than polished stone or tempered bronze is the memory of those whose lives we here commemorate,” he said. “These are our heroes.”\n\n'A beautiful monument commemorating the fidelity of the slaves'\n\nSimilar monuments went up around the South in this time period, with similar events and similar speeches.\n\nMost of the coverage of these events does not include the words of a large portion of citizens.\n\nDuring the Civil War, nearly half of Florida’s 140,000 residents were enslaved African Americans. Fifty years later, formerly enslaved and their descendants still made up a sizable portion of the population. While they weren’t quoted in coverage about monuments and memorials, they certainly were a part of it.\n\nSeveral papers wrote about a unique collection of monuments in South Carolina.\n\n“There is at Fort Mill, in this State, a beautiful monument commemorating the fidelity of the slaves during the war,” said an op-ed in the Columbia Record.\n\nThis was added to three other monuments in the park — for the Confederate soldier, the women of the Confederacy and the Catawba Indians.\n\n“It was quite an occasion when the monument to the ex-slaves was unveiled,” the editorial said. “It was reared by a Confederate soldier who loved his slaves and saw they were comfortable in after life. He endeavored to make the inscription on the bas-relief scenes as delicate and yet as significant as possible, and yet the younger negroes did not seem at the time to care much for it.”\n\nThe editorial concluded by saying the 15th Amendment, which passed in 1870 and in theory (but not necessarily reality) gave Black men the right to vote, was a mistake.\n\n“We believe that if it had not been for the enacting prematurely of the 15th amendment there would have been no sordidness among the negroes, and their condition today would have been better, but for the terrible wrong in giving them political authority or even political rights,” it said. “Citizenship is too high a right to be trifled with.”\n\n‘The South ... has no apology to make’\n\nIn Alabama, the Prattville Progress described a Memorial Day gathering at a Confederate monument, with the oration delivered by H.S. Doster.\n\nIt included this perspective on history:\n\n“While some of the slaves were mistreated and were in unworthy hands, a majority of them fared better than they do to-day,” he said. “They were better cared for and were healthier. &mldr; The negro race could not have possibly reached the high state of civilization in freedom as they did in slavery. Their years of slavery advanced them in civilization more than hundreds of years of freedom. I contend that the negro as a physical being was superior in slavery to the free negro and that along that line he is retrograding. The South, therefore, as a whole has no apology to make of its treatment of the negro as a slave.”\n\nThis speech was reprinted in the paper, it said, “at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.”\n\n‘Thank God it was Southern slavery — Christian slavery’\n\nIn North Carolina, the Gastonia Gazette published the winning entry in the local Daughters of the Confederacy high school essay contest.\n\nMiss Rebeka McLean wrote a tribute largely to the Confederate woman. In it, she described a vision for a fitting monument.\n\n“Let the vision rest on the broad granite foundation of truth,” she wrote. “Let the first picture be a scroll, the constitution of the United States, held in the unsullied hands of the great Jefferson Davis as he walks out from the United States Court, again, a free man. &mldr; Let the artist next put on the monument the old negro ‘mammy’ holding the child of her mistress in her arms.”\n\nFrom there, she said, the artist should add more memories of grateful slaves alongside their caring masters; of children in the cornfields, singing cheerful songs.\n\n“Let that picture tell to all the generations the story of slavery,” she wrote. “We had slavery, but thank God it was Southern slavery — Christian slavery.”\n\nThis award-winning essay, the newspaper said, was read at high school commencement.\n\n‘What shall we do as a symbol of our regard for them?’\n\nEach year the Daughters of the Confederacy held another essay contest, open to all of its members.\n\nThis essay contest was created in 1913 by Mrs. S.E.F. Rose of Mississippi “for the purpose of advancing interest in the study of Southern history.” The winner received the Rose Loving Cup.\n\nIn 1915, it went to Mrs. J.T. Sifford of Arkansas for her essay titled: “The Necessity of the Ku Klux Klan as an Organized Force After the War Between the States.”\n\nThis was a popular topic in 1915. It was the year that “The Birth of a Nation” (originally titled “The Clansman”) came out, portraying Klansmen as heroic figures, riding in to save the South from Black rule. It was the year that the Klan was reborn atop Stone Mountain in Georgia. It led to a period of growth for the Klan, a rise in lynchings across the South, and a series of racial massacres in Florida. Ocoee in 1920, Perry in 1922, Rosewood in 1923.\n\nThe Daughters of the Confederacy, which had unanimously endorsed a book devoted to the KKK at its 1913 national convention, continued to quote from it in material years later: “To the Ku Klux Klan is due the establishment of Anglo-Saxon supremacy forever. All honor to those brave heroes who rode side-by-side with death during Reconstruction in defense of their own, their native land.”\n\nI found Mrs. Sifford’s winning essay about “the necessity of the Klan” published in several newspapers in 1915. I also found the essay that won the previous Rose Loving Cup. The Nashville Tennessean said it was quite the competition, but the grand prize went to Mrs. Eleanor Molloy Gillespie.\n\nHer essay was devoted to the Women of the Confederacy.\n\nShe described them as self-reliant, modest, full of virtue and manners, mistresses of the art of conversation and doers of the daily duties, capable of weathering anything — even America’s deadliest war.\n\nOne section of her essay was devoted to what she said led to the Civil War: the Tenet of States Rights.\n\n“Women shared the growing hatred of the abolitionists,” she wrote. “They were intolerant of the northerners who came south as missionaries of freedom to the slaves. Reared close to the glory of the pioneer days, imbued with pride and reverence for the fathers of our country, these women held the tenet of states’ rights as sacred. &mldr; They bitterly resented Yankee interference with their goods and chattels.”\n\nShe added: “The negro slaves had been taught and clothed by these women and nursed by them in sickness. The negroes were brought to the south as savages, and the ancestors of these women had given the slaves civilization, a language, a creed.”\n\nMrs. Gillespie went on to say how the women of the Confederacy had valiantly endured unparalleled hardship with grace and dignity. And she concluded her award-winning 1914 essay, published at the start of 1915, with a question.\n\n“These women of the Confederacy are passing from us,” she wrote. “What shall we do as a symbol of our regard for them?”\n\nAcross the South, including in Jacksonville, the answer was to build monuments to them, hold parades, give speeches saying that these stone structures would still be standing in 100 years, preserving history.\n\nmwoods@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4212"
