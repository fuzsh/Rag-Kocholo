        "text": "The mountain is engraved with a sculpture of well-known people from the Confederacy: Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate states, and generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Many Georgians recognize the Stone Mountain carving, but few know the full story of its origin.\n\nThe effort to create a Confederate monument on Stone Mountain began in the 1910s. Yet, the monument was only completed in 1972. Spanning multiple efforts across more than 50 years, the carving’s history is full of twists and turns.\n\nToday, the mountain and surrounding park remain a large tourist and recreational attraction featuring hiking trails, restaurants, campgrounds, a museum, and occasionally a laser show with the carving as the backdrop.\n\nAtlanta History Center staff have been engaged with the history of the Stone Mountain carving for many years. Over the past year, the institution worked with experts and those closest to the issue to explore the history of the Stone Mountain carving from various perspectives for a documentary. The result of this work is Monument, a documentary film that delves into the controversial history of Stone Mountain, including the origin of the carving and the complicated relationships between historical events and key players who established the monument.\n\nThe Laws\n\nIn 1958, the State of Georgia purchased Stone Mountain and adopted the Stone Mountain Memorial Association Act. This law established the Stone Mountain Memorial Association (SMMA) to oversee the completion of the carving and govern the park. The carving was finished 14 years later in 1972. Over time, amendments to the original law, 12-3-190 came to include 12-3-192.1. Georgia Code 12-3-192.1 mandates that the SMMA must “maintain an appropriate and suitable memorial for the Confederacy.”\n\nIn 2001, Governor Roy Barnes began efforts to change the state flag, which had featured a Confederate battle emblem since 1956. As a part of the compromise with state legislators to remove the Confederate Battle emblem, the legislature amended Georgia Code 50-3-1 (c) to include protection for the Stone Mountain carving specifically. This law also includes text which references Lost Cause mythology.\n\nIn this section of Georgia code, which defines terms used throughout the entirety of the section of Georgia code that governs Stone Mountain park, the term “project” is defined to mean the operation of Stone Mountain as “a Confederate memorial and public recreation area.”\n\nPanel. Discussion.\n\nRelated. Stories.\n\nJohn Temple Graves was a New South orator, newspaper editor, and political figure, known for his influence on racial issues in the late 19th and early 20th century. His newspaper, the Atlanta Georgian, played a significant role in inflaming racial tensions that led to the 1906 Atlanta Race Massacre. He was also one of the earliest proponents of carving the likeness of Robert E. Lee into the side of Stone Mountain as a memorial to the Confederacy.\n\nHow did the world’s largest Confederate monument end up outside of Atlanta? What should be done, if anything, with it? With these questions in mind, Atlanta History Center explores the controversial history through online resources and an upcoming documentary.\n\nThe Birth of a Nation’s success and wide distribution increased national interest in the post-Civil War Klan. In Atlanta, the film served as an inspiration and a guide for the leaders of two early 20th-century Atlanta organizations with close connections to Stone Mountain—the modern Ku Klux Klan and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nOriginally published in 2017, this document explores the history of the Stone Mountain carving.\n\nTimeline\n\nArchival. Images.\n\nFAQ\n\nIn 1915, sculptor Gutzon Borglum envisioned a large group of Confederate soldiers in bas relief (cut out of surrounding stone) marching across the face of the mountain, led by their generals on horseback. By 1923, when carving began, Borglum’s design depicted Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in profile on horseback. Two years later, Borglum completed the head of Lee. After Borglum’s dismissal from the project in 1925, sculptor Augustus Lukeman retained Borglum’s basic design, but on a smaller scale. The Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Association blasted Borglum’s head of Lee off the mountain. Lukeman roughed in the three generals and the upper parts of the horses before his work was stopped in 1928 due to a lack of funds. In 1958, the state of Georgia purchased Stone Mountain with the intention of restarting the carving. Atlanta sculptor Julian Harris proposed finishing the work rather than adopting a completely new design. Ultimately, sculptor Walter Hancock and chief carver Roy Faulkner retained the basic Borglum-Lukeman design but adjusted it for scale.\n\nDefeat in the Civil War came as a shock to many white Southerners. About one-fifth of all white men of military age in the South died because of the war. Richmond newspaper editor Edward J. Pollard coined the phrase “The Lost Cause” in his 1866 book by the same title. Other southern writers, veterans, and women’s memorial organizations soon adopted the term. They explained military defeat as a moral victory because they believed the Confederacy had fought nobly for noble ideals. Some of the key ideas of the Lost Cause are:\n\nThe Civil War was fought over state’s rights and economic factors, such as tariffs\n\nSlavery was not the cause of the Civil War\n\nEnslaved people benefitted from their condition\n\nThe Confederacy lost only because it did not have enough resources and soldiers\n\nThis way of thinking had widespread appeal and popularity among white people in the South and nationally well into the 20th century and even into the present. Historical evidence shows though that the Lost Cause version of the Civil War is inaccurate. Slavery was the primary cause of the Civil War.\n\nIt took 58 years for the monument to be completed, though actual carving activity took about thirteen years total, occurring between 1923 to 1928 and 1964 to 1972. In 1914, John Temple Graves of the New York American newspaper proposed that a Confederate monument be carved into the face of Stone Mountain. Rock was first actually chiseled beginning in 1923. However, due largely to internal disputes and lack of funding, the project ground to a halt in 1928. Efforts to revive the project continued unsuccessfully through the Great Depression and World War II. In 1958 the state of Georgia purchased the mountain with the intention of resuming the carving. Carving got underway again in 1964. The monument as we see it today was dedicated in 1970 and officially completed in 1972.\n\nThe State of Georgia owns Stone Mountain and the surrounding park, totaling some 3,200 acres. The state purchased this land beginning in 1958 in keeping with Governor Marvin Griffin’s 1954 campaign promise to complete the carving. Prior to that time, Samuel H. Venable and his family owned the land. They leased it to the Stone Mountain Confederate Monument Association between 1916 and 1928 during the initial carving effort.\n\nThe two big efforts to carve the Stone Mountain monument happened during important moments in the larger movement for (and by others, against) civil rights for Black and other Americans.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan became a national political force in opposing civil rights for Blacks, immigrants, Catholics, and Jewish people. United Daughters of the Confederacy president Helen Plane, leader of the movement to create the monument and inspired by the film The Birth of a Nation, even proposed that Klansmen be featured in the carving. They were not, but the Klan used Stone Mountain itself as a rally and meeting site through the 1950s and the area surrounding the park for years beyond that.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education declared school segregation illegal. This landmark ruling fueled the civil rights movement as Black Americans and allies fought for social integration and equality under the law. Feeling threatened, many white Southerners launched a countermovement often known as “Massive Resistance.” They used Confederate flags and monuments to symbolize their commitment to the “way of life” of racial segregation and white supremacy. Georgia governor Marvin Griffin, who vowed to uphold segregation at all costs, made a campaign promise in 1954, 57 days after Brown vs. Board of Education, to complete the carving of the three Confederate generals on Stone Mountain.\n\nAtlanta History Center is trying to enhance awareness of the history of Stone Mountain Park by providing relevant historical evidence, context, and perspective. The facts behind past events do not change, but the way we find out about them and talk about them does change. For the film, we consulted with subject matter experts with a variety of backgrounds to provide as much clarity as possible on historical facts. Atlanta History Center’s mission is to connect people, history, and culture. We understand that this history can be complicated, challenging, and difficult. We also understand that talking about complex history with empathy and respect for all points of view is the only way to move forward with present-day challenges.\n\nAtlanta History Center does not advocate for any specific policy changes. Stone Mountain is owned by the State of Georgia and belongs to the people of Georgia, so changes (if any) are determined by the state government and the democratic process. We hope this documentary will provide a tool to better understand the history and personal feelings associated with the carving. According to the laws of the State of Georgia, Stone Mountain Park is a Confederate memorial, and the carving of Davis, Lee, and Jackson cannot be altered, removed, or obscured in any way. Two laws governing Stone Mountain Park are GA Code § 50-3-1 and GA Code § 12-3-192.1.\n\nAtlanta History Center has provided a full suite of resources on this webpage, including further reading, citations, and historical documents.\n\nFilm.
