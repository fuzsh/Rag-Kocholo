        "text": "UNC (Chapel Hill) [Removed]\n\nNickname: Silent Sam, originally brought about due to the statue's lack of ammunition which would cause him to be unable to fire his weapon.\n\nDedication date: 6/2/1913\n\nCreator: John Wilson, Sculptor Gorham Manufacturing Company, Foundry\n\nSponsor: North Carolina Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and University of North Carolina Alumni\n\nCost: $7500\n\nUnveiling & Dedication: Julian Carr spoke at the dedication of the monument in 1913. His speech recounted the heroic efforts of the men the monument honored as well as the women on the home front. The speech also spoke to the racialized nature of the commemoration as Carr tells this story: \"100 yards from where we stand, less than 90 days perhaps after my return from Appomattox, I horse-whipped a negro wench, until her skirts hung in shreds, because upon the streets of this quiet village she had publicly insulted and maligned a Southern lady.\"\n\nFollowing a white supremacy rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017, during which a counter-protestor was killed by a white supremacist, activists began a sustained campaign for the removal of the Confederate Memorial from public display on the university campus. The protests included extended vigils at the monument, campaigns to raise public awareness about the monumentsâ€™ origins, and public calls for its removal. While Gov. Roy Cooper publicly endorsed removing the monument, university leaders insisted that the 2015 Heritage Protection Act prevented the university from removing the monument without legislative approval. Throughout the academic year of 2017-2018 the monument remained the focus of protest, but no meaningful steps, other than a few public forums, were taken to reinterpret the monument or to petition the legislature for its removal. On the evening of August 20, 2018, an estimated 250 protesters gathered around the monument, and despite the presence of campus police, toppled it. The monument subsequently was moved to an undisclosed location by campus authorities. The future disposition of the monument remains unclear. University authorities have pledged to prosecute those responsible for toppling the monument.\n\nLocation: The statue faced north as if to defend the Confederate South from the armies of the United States.\n\nLandscape: The monument sat at the center of McCorkle place on the UNC Campus. It was surrounded by campus buildings as well as a number of other monuments. The monument is currently in the custody of UNC-Chapel Hill and in storage.\n\nCity: Chapel Hill\n\nCounty: Orange"
