        "text": "Frank Lloyd Wright was born June 8th, 1867 in rural Richland Center, Wisconsin. He was the greatest American architect. Just ask him! Except he’d tell you he’s the greatest architect from anywhere… ever!\n\nFrank made Richard Wagner look humble. His life was a grand soap opera on a roller coaster and it went on for 91 years if you don’t count the fact that somebody had one of his houses built in Ireland a couple years ago or that he was buried twice. Wright promoted organic architecture and is known for his Usonian house concept and his Prairie School movement. Wright’s buildings speak for themselves, but a viewing of Ken Burn’s documentary is a big help."
