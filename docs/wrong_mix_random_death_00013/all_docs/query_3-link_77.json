        "text": "popular name: Oscar Levant\n\ndate_of_death: August 14, 1972\n\nage: 65\n\ncause_of_death: Heart attack\n\nclaim_to_fame: Artists\n\nbest_know_for: Oscar Levant was a brilliant composer and pianist who originally studied seriously with Zygmunt Stojowski and later with Arnold Schoenberg. After New York he moved to Los Angeles where he met and befriended George Gershwin. From 1929 to 1948 he composed the music for more than twenty movies and began making the rounds on TV games shows and quickly gained notorioty for his acerbic \"wit.\" When Greshwin passed away Levant became the leading interpreter and virtuoso performer of the Gershwin catalog. Appearing in films (such as American in Paris; usually as himself or as the host pianist) he could always be counted on for his stoic and sarcastic on-screen persona. In later years he became increasing dependent on alcohol, chain smoking and prescription drugs so much so he was committed multiple times to a mental institution.\n\npopular name: Gustave Caillebotte\n\ndate_of_death: February 21, 1894\n\nage: 45\n\ncause_of_death: Stroke\n\nclaim_to_fame: Artists\n\nbest_know_for: Gustave Caillebotte was a French painter who was a member and patron of the Impressionists, although he painted in a more realistic manner than many others in the group. He was noted for his early interest in photography as an art form, and is best known for his paintings of urban Paris, such as The Europe Bridge (Le Pont de l'Europe) (1876), and Paris Street; Rainy Day (Rue de Paris; temps de pluie, also known as La Place de l'Europe, temps de pluie) (1877). Born in Paris in 1848, Caillebotte studied law and engineering before fighting in the Franco–Prussian War from 1870 to 1871. After the war’s end, he studied at the studio of Léon Bonnat and later at the École des Beaux Arts. Upon meeting Edgar Degas, Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet, Caillebotte experimented further with capturing the changing face of everyday Parisian life. Caillebotte made his debut in the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876, showing eight paintings, including Les raboteurs de parquet (The Floor Scrapers) (1875), his earliest masterpiece. Cropping and \"zooming-in\", techniques that commonly are found in Caillebotte's oeuvre, may also be the result of his interest in photography, but may just as likely be derived from his intense interest in perspective effects. A large number of Caillebotte's works also employ a very high vantage point, including View of Rooftops (Snow) (Vue de toits (Effet de neige)) (1878), Boulevard Seen from Above (Boulevard vu d'en haut) (1880), and A Traffic Island (Un refuge, boulevard Haussmann) (1880).\n\npopular name: Nusch Éluard\n\ndate_of_death: November 28, 1946\n\nage: 40\n\ncause_of_death: Stroke\n\nclaim_to_fame: Artists\n\nbest_know_for: Nicknamed “Nusch” by artist Max Bill, she was a French performer, model and surrealist artist. In 1930 she met the poet Paul Éluard working as a model. They married him in 1934. She produced surrealist photomontage and other works, and is the subject of “Facile,” a collection of Éluard’s poetry published as a photogravure book, illustrated with Man Ray’s nude photographs of her. Later she was the subject of several cubist portraits and sketches by Pablo Picasso in the late 1930s with whom she had an affair. Nusch worked for the French Resistance during the Nazi occupation of France during World War II and died suddenly in 1946 in Paris, collapsing in the street due to a massive stroke."
