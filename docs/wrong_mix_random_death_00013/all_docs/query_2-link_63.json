Wright believed in designing structures which were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by his design for Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\".[1] Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.\n\nHis work includes original and innovative examples of many different building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums. Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass. Wright authored 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio. Already well known during his lifetime, Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as \"the greatest American architect of all time.\"\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was married three times and fathered seven children, four sons and three daughters. He also adopted Svetlana Milanoff, the daughter of his third wife, Olgivanna Lloyd Wright.[77]\n\nHis wives were:\n\nCatherine \"Kitty\" (Tobin) Wright (1871–1959); social worker, socialite (married in June 1889; divorced November 1922)\n\nMaude \"Miriam\" (Noel) Wright (1869–1930), artist (married in November 1923; divorced August 1927)\n\nOlga Ivanovna \"Olgivanna\" (Lazovich Milanoff) Lloyd Wright (1897–1985), dancer and writer (married in August 1928)\n\nOne of Wright's sons, Frank Lloyd Wright, Jr., known as Lloyd Wright, was also a notable architect in Los Angeles. Lloyd Wright's son (and Wright's grandson), Eric Lloyd Wright, is currently an architect in Malibu, California, where he has a practice of mostly residences, but also civic and commercial buildings.\n\nAnother son and architect, John Lloyd Wright, invented Lincoln Logs in 1918, and practiced extensively in the San Diego area. John's daughter, Elizabeth Wright Ingraham, was an architect in Colorado Springs, Colorado and died September 15, 2013 of congestive heart failure. She is the mother of Christine, an interior designer in Connecticut, and Catherine, an architecture professor at the Pratt Institute.[78]\n\nWright designed a house for David Samuel Wright, his son by his first marriage to Catherine, and David's wife, Gladys.[79][80]\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress Anne Baxter was Wright's granddaughter. Baxter was the daughter of Catherine Baxter, a child born of Wright's first marriage. Baxter's daughter, Melissa Galt, currently lives and works in Atlanta as an interior designer.[78]\n\nHis step-daughter Svetlana (daughter of Olgivanna) and her son Daniel died in an automobile accident in 1946. Her widower, William Wesley Peters, was later briefly married to Svetlana Alliluyeva, the youngest child and only daughter of Joseph Stalin. They divorced after she could not adjust to the communal lifestyle of the Wright communities, which she compared to life in the Soviet Union under her father, and because of the constant interference of Wright's widow. Peters served as Chairman of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation from 1985 to 1991.\n\nA great-grandson of Wright, S. Lloyd Natof, currently lives and works in Chicago as a master woodworker who specializes in the design and creation of custom wood furniture.[81]\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born in 1867 in Richland Center, Wisconsin, the son of William Carey Wright (1825 - 1904) and Anna Lloyd (Jones) Wright (1838 - 1923).\n\nFrank married first Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" (Tobin) Wright (1871-1959) on 1 Jun 1889 in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois.[1] Their children were:\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright, Jr. (1890–1978)\n\nJohn Lloyd Wright (1892–1972)\n\nCatherine Dorothy Wright (1894–1979)\n\nDavid Samuel Wright (1896–1997)\n\nFrances Lloyd Wright (1898–1959)\n\nRobert Llewellyn Wright (1903–1986)\n\nFrank married second Maude Miriam (Hicks) Wright (1869-1930) on 19 November 1923 in Illinois. They had no children.\n\nFrank married third Olga Ivanovna (Lloyd) Wright (1898-1985) on 25 Aug 1929. Their children were:\n\nSvetlanna Hinzenberg Wright (1917–1946)\n\nPrivate\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright died in 1959 in Phoenix, Arizona and was buried at Taliesin West, Scottsdale, Maricopa County, Arizona.[2][3]\n\nNotes\n\nNotable architect. He designed office, hotel and museum buildings, as well as dwellings for rich and poor, that were constructed across America and internationally, some of which were controversial and impractical (such as New York's Guggenheim Museum, which because of its futuristic design of curves and sweeps does not allow for space to exhibit paintings). The main concentration of his structures are located in Oak Park, Illinois, while other commissions were completed years after his death such as the stunning lakefront Monono Terrace Community and Convention Center located in Madison, Wisconsin. Born in Richland Center, Wisconsin, his father deserted the family and left them to fend for themselves much as Frank himself did when he simply abandoned his first wife and four children and moved in with his neighbor Margaret (Mamah) Cheney. She became the tragedy of his life when murdered along with her two children and two others by the family servant at his residence, who then set fire to the dwelling in a dispute over his salary. He resided summers in Wisconsin and winters at his estate in Arizona. In the Spring of 1959, intestinal blockage surgery failed and Frank Lloyd Wright died at the age of ninety-one. The body was returned to his 1,600 acre estate at Spring Green, Wisconsin. After a service, a horse and wagon carried his body from Unity Chapel to where the graves of many members of the Wright family (his mother, his mistress Mamah and her two children) are interred. His first wife, Kitty had died at age 92 a few weeks before. However, after the death of Olgivanna Wright, his last wife, his body was disinterred, his remains cremated and his ashes mixed with Olivanna's and then divided: some spread over the Arizona desert and the rest interred on the Wright estate. (bio by: Donald Greyfield)\n\nIn 1987 a biographer of Wright suggested that he may have been christened as \"Frank Lincoln Wright\" or \"Franklin Lincoln Wright\" but these assertions were not supported by any evidence.[4]\n\nWhen the government wanted to sell Ellis Island, there were many different ideas on what to do with it. Frank had a grand plan to make it into a futuristic city.\n\nCensus\n\nW. C. Wright 54 yrs, music teacher, wife Anna L. 40 yrs, George 22 yrs, Frank 13 yrs, Jennie 11 yrs, Margret 3 yrs, Jenny L.
