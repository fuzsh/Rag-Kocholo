        "text": "Profession: Architect\n\nBiography: Frank Lloyd Wright was an American architect, interior designer, writer, and educator, who developed a series of highly original styles of architecture. He spent more than 70 years creating designs that revolutionized the art of architecture. His vision was to create architecture that was in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture.\n\nWright's most iconic design is the house known as Fallingwater, constructed in the 1930s. Built over a natural waterfall in the Pennsylvania woods, it exemplifies his concept of organic architecture: the harmonious union of art and nature. Another significant contribution of Wright's is the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, with its spiraling, continuous space disrupting traditional museum layout.\n\nWright was not just an architect, but also an educator. He established an apprenticeship program at his studio, Taliesin, in Wisconsin. Known as the Taliesin Fellowship, it combined hands-on architectural work with a curriculum that included design, history, and other related subjects. Many of his apprentices went on to have successful careers of their own, helping to extend Wright's architectural philosophy into the 21st century.\n\nBorn: June 8, 1867\n\nBirthplace: Richland Center, Wisconsin, USA\n\nStar Sign: Gemini"
