        "text": "One of the world's best known architects was born on this day (June 8). Frank Lloyd Wright had a major role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects throughout the world. Wright was born in rural Wisconsin in 1867 and lived to be 91 years old. Of the following four statements about Frank Lloyd Wright, which are true? (1.) Wright had a studio in Chicago. (2.) He designed hundreds of structures. (3.) \"Fallingwater\" is the name of a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. (4.) There are no buildings designed by Wright in Missouri.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDid Frank Lloyd Wright have a studio in Chicago? Indeed he did. It's in Oak Park, Illinois, and the building was also his home for many years. It was completed in 1896 and added to over the years. And it's open to visitors. Statement two says Wright designed hundreds of structures. Wright's last design, a massive house in the Arizona desert, was done shortly before his death in 1959. He'd been designing buildings for 70 years, and yes, he designed hundreds of structures, actually more than thousand.\n\nStatement three says Fallingwater was a Wright-designed house. Wright was a pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School Movement of architecture. He believed in designing in harmony with the environment. Wright called it organic architecture. That philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater, a design from 1935 that's been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\". And Fallingwater is a house, so statement three is also true. The structure was recently ranked the most loved building in the United States in a new study by Buildworld. The Empire State Building came in second. Fallingwater, at Mill Run, Pennsylvania, was constructed over a 30-foot waterfall to put the occupants close to the area's natural surroundings. It features a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces.\n\nMany of Wright's buildings are in the Chicago area and the Upper Midwest. Statement four says there are no buildings in Missouri that were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. And that is false. There are five of them, four houses, two in the St. Louis area (on Masonridge Road and on North Ballas Road), two in Kansas City (on Bellview Avenue and NW Briarcliff Road), and Community Christian Church near Kansas City's Country Club Plaza.\n\nWright designed hundreds of residential homes and many houses of worship. He designed very few skyscrapers. One of the few is the Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Wright was praised for his design of the S.C. Johnson Wax headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin. One of Wright's most famous buildings is the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. It's been called his most recognized masterpiece. The unique design allows visitors to experience the building's art collection by taking an elevator to the top level and viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending central spiral ramp."
