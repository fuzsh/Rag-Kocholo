        "text": "Russel Wright is an American industrial designer and architect that lived during the early to mid twentieth century. Many of Wright’s ideas and designs were considered to modern at time, drawing influences from not only ingenious designers like Frank Lloyd Wright but nature as well. Wright’s influences would lead him to create a design style unlike any at the time; a style that would eventually become almost standard in many homes in the United States. The designer Russel Wright and his wife, Mary Wright together published a guidebook known as Guide to Easier Living. In it contains numerous suggestions and thoughts on home architecture, interior design, as well as product design. Many of the thoughts and suggestions conveyed in the book can be seen in present-day design and architecture. Wright’s book also laid the groundwork for his home, Dragon Rock, which of itself possesses elements of design that are seen in today’s homes. Russel Wright’s Guide to Easier Living is clearly a response to interior design at the time; containing numerous design ideas, Wrights guide influences Wright’s own future works.\n\nWithout a doubt, Frank Lloyd Wright was one of the greatest architects in American history and the greatest architect of the 20th century. Nature was his muse and his architectural structures embodied organic qualities. He took full advantage of the technological advances of the 20th century but redirecting the concept of space and employing new techniques; Wright was known for his modern and innovative designs. He believed that, “architecture was not just about buildings, it was about nourishing the lives of those sheltered within them”. Wright is not only one of the most well known architects in America but he is also thought of as one of the most influential architects in the world.\n\nFrank Wright (1867-1959), is an American architect born on June 8th in Richland Center, Wisconsin (Biography.com n.d.). A modern design, he produced an organic and clear American style (Architectural Digest n.d.). Wright founded his own firm and developed the Prairie School- single-story homes with low, slanted roofs and extended rows on the windowpane, using the available materials from local business and clean and not painted wood (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica 2017). The Robie House (Figure 1) located in Chicago and Unity Temple placed in Oak Park (Biography.com n.d.). Wright was known mainly in Europe but not in the United States. In 1913, Wright designed his home on his maternal ancestors land in Spring Green, Wisconsin (Architectural Digest n.d.). This home was named Taliesin, sadly it got burnt down twice and he still remodeled it again (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica 2017). Wright wrote two books in 1932: “An Autobiography” and “The Disappearing City,” both are known as architectural literature (Biography.com n.d.). In addition, to publishing the two books, he\n\nThe building selected for this project is the Fisher House In Philadelphia By Louis I. Kahn. It took Kahn seven years and many different designs to complete this work starting from 1960. Though the Fisher House is one of the few private residences designed by Kahn that came to completion, it serves as a great instance of his architectural achievements through the underlying stylistic forms and philosophical values. For various reasons such as the recession caused by the second World War and stylistic differences of his Beaux Arts training, Kahn struggled to find commissions until two decade before his death in 1974. The projects completed during this period however are of great importance since Kahn was finally able to incorporate his\n\nThe piece is actually a home that was initially supposed to just have a view of a water fall. However he went above and beyond that and put house on top of the water fall . He created it this way so that the sound of the water became a very significant part of the Kaufmann family whom he created the beautiful home for. The location which the house was constructed is beautiful I would love to do work in such a beautiful place. The best part of the piece for me was that it can be lived in. It’s not just a painting that can be looked at but pieces that you can hear, see, touch, feel and live within. Both inside and outside is beautiful on the outer part of the house he used rocks that are in the surrounding of those to create unity between nature and the house. He had a very great sense for texture and materials that were native to the surroundings. He was very careful about building this house and didn’t harm the environment it is interesting because the house looks like he built around trees because you can see trees between walls. His caution and love of nature was shown through the piece that gives it a great meaning and. The inside the house his artistic genius his most defiantly shown. The House has a open plan and the rooms pour into each other. This shows his willingness to take risk because this was not a very used or popular technique used in the\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt was born January 30, 1882 in New York. He was born into a wealthy family and was the only child his parents, James and Sara Ann Roosevelt, would have. Franklin grew up with a sense of self-importance and his entire household revolved around him. He was educated by private tutors until the age of 14. In 1856, he attended Groton School for Boys, a prestigious Episcopal preparatory school in Massachusetts. Franklin struggled while attending Groton because he did not fit in well because most of the boys excelled in athletics and Franklin did not. He was more interested in pleasing the adults and took to heart the words his headmaster had told the students, urging them to help the less fortunate through charity.\n\nMany of those buildings were being developed in his mind while he was growing up and spending summers on his uncle’s farm. It was during this time that he developed his love for Nature, to be a part of it. His love for Nature is dominant in his earlier works dubbed the “Prairie Houses”, but can also been seen in his later works such as Johnson Wax and the Guggenheim Museum. When Frank Lloyd Wright was just sixty-eight years old, he was commissioned to design a house for Edgar Kaufmann. Wright and Kaufmann went to the property to survey the location for the house. Kaufmann liked to spend time at the water falls on his land so that is where Wright decided to build it. Wright figured if Nature could place the boulders over a waterfall, than he could build a house over one. It took Wright only three hours to draw the plans for the house. The house consists basically of concrete slabs balanced on the boulders above the stream, and the walls are slabs of the natural rock surrounding the house. The house includes a pool that is built under the house and is fed by the passing stream. Every aspect of the house embraces the Nature that it co-exists with, and the house appears to fade into its surroundings.\n\nThe speech was given in 1901 in the “Hull House” in Chicago to the Chicago Arts and Crafts Society, it was aimed into convincing the people who were involved with construction to create a community to sustain the sacred idea that the architects of the time called art (Patenting, 1). The speech was shown and given by Frank Lloyd Wright in the building, he was a major visionary and architect at the time so many looked up to him. He made the speech to explain his philosophy on the creation of his works and how he obtains the motivation and will to do so, he also wanted the community to understand the machine and how it was different from art.\n\nOne of the most influential and well-known architectural engineers in America during the twentieth century has got to be Frank Lloyd Wright. He’s created and designed many creative and functional buildings for most of his career which spanned to about seventy years. His futuristic and modern designs were unique and creative, yet they were still functional for one to live in them. His eccentric thinking has brought about and greatly influenced the image of twentieth century architecture. His works have paved the way to the designs and structures of the civil engineers and architects that we have today in the twenty-first century.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright is one of the most important architects of the twentieth century; with his buildings and his ideals of an organic architecture, he got to be known by everyone. Who does not know about the Fallingwater? This building is considered his masterpiece and represents all his principles. For him, organic architecture was designing by integrating a building to its site and context, and he was able to achieve it with most of his projects. However, Wright’s career did not started like this; he went through a lot of complex periods that ended consolidating his ideals as an architect. Moreover, each of these phases had different kind of influences that Wright took and learned from. Therefore, it’s important to acknowledge how outside architecture and social factors influenced his “Organic” idea.\n\nDifferent architects have different styles because they are trying to get at different things. Architecture is not just about making something beautiful anymore, it is about trying to get across a set of ideas about how we inhabit space. Two of the most famous architects of the twentieth century, one from each side, the early part and the later part up until today each designed a museum with money donated by the Guggenheim foundation. One of these is in New York City, it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The other is in bilbao, Spain, and it was designed by Frank Geary. My purpose of this paper is to interrogate each of these buildings, glorious for different reasons, to show how each architect was expressing their own style."
