        "text": "Oscar Stonorov (1905-1970) was a German-born American architect and sculptor. He was known as a modernist. Architects who worked in this style wanted to break with architectural tradition and design simple, unornamented buildings. Glass, concrete, and steel were common construction materials. Floor plans were functional and logical.\n\nStonorov set sail for America in 1929 and found work with a New York architectural firm before migrating to Philadelphia where he opened his own architectural office.\n\nBy 1931, Stonorov and his architectural partner Alfred Kastner (included in this topic) had received second prize in the Palace of the Soviets international competition. The two subsequently designed one of the very first union workers’ housing blocks in the U.S.—Philadelphia’s Carl Mackley Houses (1932-1935).\n\nIn the early 1930s, Stonorov and Kastner were eager to work on model housing for African Americans. Through Howard University’s president they met prominent Black architect Hilyard Robinson in 1932. The three developed a proposal for “Howard City” in Washington, D.C., to the federal government to finance a mixed-use, mixed-income housing program south of Howard’s campus. Unfortunately, the proposal failed because a local banker absconded with funds for the parcels of land.\n\nA partnership between Stonorov and Louis Kahn during the 1940s resulted in scores of modernist public housing projects, many influenced by the pair’s shared European immigrant experience. Together the two architects authored influential books and papers on neighborhood planning and citizen involvement.\n\nStonorov conceived the idea for the Better Philadelphia Exhibition which ran from September 8 to October 15, 1947 at Gimbels department store. The exhibit showcased new ideas for revitalizing Philadelphia after years of depression and war. Stonorov recruited assistance from urban planner Edmund Bacon and others.\n\nThe Gimbel family of Philadelphia commissioned Stonorov in 1949 to design an exhibit on the work of prominent architect Frank Lloyd Wright. This exhibit, “Sixty Years of Living Architecture,” was the largest showing of Wright’s work ever mounted. It premiered January 1951 in Philadelphia at Gimbel’s Department Store. Stonorov traveled with the exhibit during its entire three-year international tour.\n\nStonorov spent the final 15 years of his career in partnership with J. Frank Haws. Stonorov was killed in a private plane crash in 1970 in Pellston, Michigan, on his way to inspect the construction progress of a new educational center he designed in Black Lake, Michigan. The center opened just weeks after his death, and is known today as the Black Lake Conference Center."
