        "text": "Fallingwater - A Frank Lloyd Wright Masterpiece\n\nIn 1935, the Kaufmann family commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design a summer home. The house was to be built along Bear Run, a favorite swimming spot of the Kaufmann family and escape from the hustle and bustle of Pittsburgh.\n\nCompleted in 1937, Fallingwater blends seamlessly with the landscape and waterfall, fully expressing Wright’s concept of “organic architecture.” Fallingwater seemingly suspends in mid-air above the shimmering cascade, creating the dramatically elegant home.\n\nFallingwater, a National Historic Landmark and one of 24 UNESCO World Heritage sites in the U.S. and is listed along attractions including the Pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal, is open for the 61st tour season with a variety of experiences for visitors to gain insights into Wright’s organic architecture and design philosophy, and discover the beauty of Fallingwater and its natural landscape.\n\nGate open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily\n\nClosed Wednesdays\n\nBook online below or call 724-329-8501\n\nVisitors should bring this information, along with personal identification, to present to Fallingwater staff at the entry gate.\n\nKentuck Knob - A Mountaintop Gem\n\nLess than ten miles from Fallingwater sits Frank Lloyd Wright’s mountain house, Kentuck Knob. Built in the early fifties on a bluff 2,050 feet above sea level, the home stands just below the crest of the mountain that it was named after. This one story Usonian home was designed on a hexagonal module. It blends almost seamlessly into the dramatic and serene scenery, appearing to be part of the hillside itself.\n\nBuilt with only two right angles, this unique home also features an extensive art collection, including the sculpture garden on the grounds. Just beyond the home’s back terrace, visitors can take in the incredible panoramic view along of the Youghiogheny River gorge and the surrounding towering trees.\n\nKentuck Knob is open for tours March through December, but hours vary depending on the time of year. Advance ticket purchase is required for all tours.\n\nDuncan House - A Treasure Perfect for a Wright Overnight\n\nThe Duncan House, built in 1957 for Donald and Elizabeth Duncan, was painstakingly and lovingly disassembled in 2004, moved from its original location in Lisle, IL, to its present site at Frank Lloyd Wright at Polymath Park in Acme, PA. The home was reopened in 2007 and has since become one of few Wright homes available for overnight rentals.\n\nAnother example of Wright's Usonian style, Duncan House is one of 60 similar designs he built in the mid-to-late fifties. Also on property at Frank Lloyd Wright at Polymath Park is Balter House and Blum House, designed by Wright’s apprentice, Peter Berndtson. In addition to tours, Polymath Park offers delicious cuisine at the Wright-inspired restaurant, TreeTops, onsite, creating the perfect Wright experience.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright at Polymath Park is open March through December (closed Wednesdays) and offers house tours, overnight stays, delicious dining and more. All Wright at Polymath Park tours are purchased through Fallingwater. Advance ticket purchase is required for all tours.\n\nMäntylä - Finnish for \"Under the Pines\"\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright at Polymath Park and their talented crew brought new life to Frank Lloyd Wright's Mäntylä. The Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, McKinney (Lindholm) family and Usonian Preservation Inc. worked together to accurately and effectively relocate the house from Cloquet, MN and preserve the property for future generations."
