The all-day architectural experience is held in the historic Chicago suburb of Oak Park, home to more Wright buildings than anywhere in the world.\n\nFor one day only, homeowners invite guests into their private living spaces, which retain the original exterior features while the interiors have been transformed to suit their individual tastes and lifestyles. Guides will be on hand to enhance the interior tours with details about the history and the beautiful architectural elements that give each home its unique character.\n\nTour the homes and enjoy an informative, fun and idea-filled day, described as \"the pinnacle of housewalks.\"\n\nWright Plus proceeds support the restoration, preservation and education programs of the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust."
