        "text": "Exploring the Legacy of Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biographical Journey\n\nWorks of Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nAsk the average citizen to name a famous American architect, and you can bet their answer will be Frank Lloyd Wright. For a good reason, Wright gained such cultural importance: he changed how we build and live. Designing 1,114 architectural works of all types — 532 of which were realized — created some of the most innovative spaces in the United States.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was a pioneer in American architecture and design, known for his innovative and creative approach to building design. He believed in the harmonious integration of buildings with the surrounding environment and human beings, a philosophy he referred to as “organic architecture.” This concept emphasized the importance of considering the natural setting, the human experience, and the purpose of the building as integral components of the design process. One of the most famous examples of this philosophy in action is Wright’s masterpiece, Fallingwater (1935). This iconic building, which sits perched atop a waterfall in Pennsylvania, seamlessly blends into its natural surroundings and remains a testament to Wright’s commitment to designing in harmony with humanity and the environment.\n\nWright played a key role in the twentieth century’s architectural movements, influencing generations of architects worldwide through his works. With a career that spanned seven decades before his death in 1959.\n\nWright wrote several books and articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe. He was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as “the greatest American architect of all time.” In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. His colorful personal life made headlines: leaving his first wife, Catherine Tobin, for Mamah Cheney in 1909, the murders at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife, Miriam Noel, in 1923, and his relationship with Olgivanna Lazović, whom he married in 1928.\n\nThe mission of an architect is to help people understand how to make life more beautiful, the world a better one for living in, and to give reason, rhyme, and meaning to life.\n\nEarly Life of Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born in Richland Center, Wis., on June 8, 1867, the son of William Carey Wright, a preacher, and a musician, and Anna Lloyd Jones, a teacher whose large Welsh family had settled the valley area near Spring Green, Wisconsin. His early childhood was nomadic as his father traveled from one ministry position to another in Rhode Island, Iowa, and Massachusetts, before settling in Madison, Wis., in 1878. Wright’s parents divorced in 1885, making financial circumstances even more challenging. To help support the family, 18-year-old Frank Lloyd Wright worked for the dean of the University of Wisconsin’s engineering department while also studying there. But he knew he wanted to be an architect. In 1887, he left Madison for Chicago.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright’s early career saw him work for multiple architecture firms before Adler and Sullivan’s prestigious partnership hired him. During his time there, he worked directly under the renowned architect Louis Sullivan for six years, gaining valuable experience and honing his skills. In 1893, Wright established his own successful practice in Chicago and opened a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His first independent commission, the William H. Winslow House, showcased his signature style that was simple and elegant yet captivating.\n\nThe Prairie Style Years\n\nWright was determined to create an architecture that was uniquely American and reflected the spirit of the country. This led to the development of the Prairie Style, a style characterized by low-pitched roofs, deep overhangs, no attics or basements, and long rows of casement windows that emphasized the horizontal lines of the buildings. Over the next sixteen years, he set the standards for this style and established himself as one of the most influential architects of his time.\n\nIn a Prairie house, “the essential nature of the box could be eliminated,” Wright explained. Interior walls were minimized to emphasize openness and community. “The relationship of inhabitants to the outside became more intimate; landscape and building became one, more harmonious; and instead of a separate thing set up independently of landscape and site, the building with landscape and site became inevitably one.”\n\nSome of Wright’s most important residential works of the time are the Darwin D. Martin House in Buffalo, New York (1903), the Avery Coonley House in Riverside, Illinois (1907), and the Frederick C. Robie House in Chicago (1908). Important public commissions included the Larkin Company Administration Building in Buffalo (1903, demolished 1950) and Unity Temple in Oak Park (1905).\n\nNotable public works (1900–1917)\n\nCreatively exhausted and emotionally restless, late in 1909, Wright left his family for an extended stay in Europe with Mamah Borthwick (Cheney), a client he had been in love with for several years. Wright hoped he could escape the weariness and discontent that now governed both his professional and domestic life. During this European hiatus, Wright worked on two publications of his work, published by Ernst Wasmuth, one of the Wasmuth Portfolio drawings, Ausgeführte Bauten und Entwürfe von Frank Lloyd Wright, and one of the photographs, Ausgeführte Bauten, both released in 1911.\n\nThese publications brought international recognition to his work and greatly influenced other architects. The same year, Wright and Mamah returned to the States and, unwelcome in Chicago social circles, began constructing Taliesin near Spring Green as their home and refuge. There he also resumed his architectural practice and received two important public commissions over the next several years: the first in 1913 for an entertainment center called Midway Gardens in Chicago; the second, in 1916, for the new Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nIn August 1914, Wright’s life with Mamah was tragically closed as she, her two children, and four others were killed in a brutal attack and fire intentionally started by an angry Taliesin domestic employee. Emotionally and spiritually devastated by the tragedy, Wright could find solace only in work, and he began to rebuild Taliesin in Mamah’s memory. Once completed, he effectively abandoned it for nearly a decade. He pursued major work in Tokyo with the Imperial Hotel, which was demolished in 1968, and in Los Angeles with the Hollyhock House and Olive Hill for oil heiress Aline Barnsdall.\n\nDesigning in Japan (1917–1922)\n\nThe years between 1922 and 1934 were both architecturally creative and fiscally catastrophic. Wright had established an office in Los Angeles, but following his return from Japan in 1922, commissions were scarce, except for the four textile block houses of 1923–1924 (Millard, Storer, Freeman, and Ennis). He soon abandoned the West Coast and returned to Taliesin. While only a few projects went into construction, this decade was one of Wright’s great design innovations. Among the unbuilt commissions were the National Life Insurance Building (Chicago, 1924), the Gordon Strong Automobile Objective (Sugarloaf Mountain, Maryland, 1925), San Marcos-in-the-Desert resort (Chandler, Arizona, 1928), and St. Mark’s-in-the-Bowerie apartment towers (New York City, 1928).\n\nWith few architectural commissions coming his way, Wright turned to writing and lecturing, which introduced him to a larger national audience. Two important publications came out in 1932: An Autobiography and The Disappearing City. The first received widespread critical acclaim and would continue to inspire generations of young architects. The second introduced Wright’s scheme for Broadacre City, a utopian vision for decentralization that moved the city into the country. Although it received little serious consideration at the time, it would influence community development in unforeseen ways in the decades to come. At about this same time, Wright and Olgivanna founded an architectural school at Taliesin, the “Taliesin Fellowship,” an apprenticeship program to provide a total learning environment, integrating not only architecture and construction but also farming, gardening, and cooking, and the study of nature, music, art, and dance.\n\nLater career\n\nIn 1936, Wright worked on several important commissions, including the S.C. Johnson and Son Company Administration Building in Racine, Wisconsin; Fallingwater, the country house for Edgar Kaufmann in rural Pennsylvania; Herbert Jacobs House (the first executed “Usonian” house) in Madison.\n\nAt this same time, Wright decided he wanted a more permanent winter residence in Arizona, and he acquired some acreage of the raw, rugged desert in the foothills of the McDowell Mountains in Scottsdale. Here he and the Taliesin Fellowship began constructing Taliesin West as a winter camp, a bold new endeavor for desert living where he tested design innovations, structural ideas, and building details that responded to the dramatic desert setting. Wright and the fellowship established migration patterns between Wisconsin and Arizona, which the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture continues to this day.\n\nAcknowledging Wright’s stunning reentry into the architectural spotlight, the Museum of Modern Art in New York staged a comprehensive retrospective exhibition that opened in 1940. In June 1943, undeterred by a world at war, Wright received a letter that initiated his most important and most challenging commission during his late career. Baroness Hilla von Rebay wrote asking him to design a building to house the Solomon R. Guggenheim collection of non-objective paintings. Wright responded enthusiastically, never anticipating the tremendous amount of time and energy this project would consume before its completion sixteen years later.\n\nHe was still actively involved with all aspects of work, including frequent trips to New York to oversee the Guggenheim Museum’s construction. In April of 1959, he was suddenly stricken by an illness that forced his hospitalization. He died on April 9, two months shy of his ninety-second birthday.\n\nWright devoted his life to promoting architecture as “the great mother art, behind which all others are definitely, distinctly and inevitably related.” Seeking a consistent expression of underlying unity, he drew inspiration from the Japanese idea of a culture in which every object, every human, and every action were integrated to make an entire civilization a work of art. Above all else, Wright’s vision served beauty. He believed that every man, woman, and child had the right to live a beautiful life in beautiful circumstances. He sought to create affordable architecture that served that aspiration.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright Bibliography – Recommended Books\n\nThis bibliography consists of a selective list of books relating to the architects’ Architecture.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright Designs: The Sketches, Plans, and Drawings\n\nAuthor: Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation\n\nHardcover: 420 pages\n\nPublisher: Rizzoli; 1st edition (October 4, 2011)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nDescription by publisher: Frank Lloyd Wright Designs is the most important and comprehensive book to be published on the drawings, designs, conceptual sketches, elevations, and plans of Wright, emphasizing the development of certain important projects.
