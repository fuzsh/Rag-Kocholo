He later changed it to Lloyd, adopting his mother’s maiden name as a way to honor her.\n\n🌀He never graduated high school and attended one semester of college in engineering at the University of Wisconsin before working for Chicago architect John Selby.\n\n🌀He disliked NYC, criticizing its skyscrapers. He agreed to design the Guggenheim only if it bordered nature, hence its location next to Central Park.\n\n🌀He initially named the Guggenheim “Archeseum,” his term for “Architecture Museum.” This name appears on his construction drawings, specifications, and correspondence until 1956.\n___\n📷 : Frank Lloyd Wright on balcony of Guggenheim, 1959.
