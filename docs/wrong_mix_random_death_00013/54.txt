Frank Lloyd Wright continues to be one of the most influential architects today. But much of the architect’s design ethos was shaped by the great Louis Sullivan, who is often known as the “Father of Modernism.”

Yet the work of Sullivan was also shaped by another architect: Frank Furness of Philadelphia. At the early age of 17, Sullivan took on an apprenticeship at the office of Furness & Hewitt. Though brief, Furness managed to leave a lasting impression on the young designer, who would go onto describe Furness as someone who “made buildings out of his head.”

Furness, born on November 12, 1839, was a prolific architect. It’s estimated that he designed nearly 200 buildings, residences, churches, banks, and more between 1878 and 1906, but many of them have since met the wrecking ball or have been altered beyond recognition. Still, many of his showstoppers still remain in Philadelphia and the surrounding region, including these 10 fantastical works below.

This is by no means a complete list of Furness’s existing works, but they offer some of the best examples of his ornamental and whimsical style, plus evolution as a designer over the years. They’re listed in order of the date they were designed and built.

If you’re eager to check out more Frank Furness works, read about the massive, 42-room mansion he designed, which was put up for auction last year, or the brownstone that’s being redeveloped into multi-million-dollar condos.

Designed in 1871 and built five years later, the Historic Landmark Building at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is considered the first building that put Furness on the map, so to speak. Furness won the competition along with his partner George Hewitt to design the academy’s art museum and school building. Furness took a leaf from the industrial boom of Philadelphia at the time, taking groundbreaking measures to create a modern building with features like skylights, sandblasted ornamental designs inside and out, and steel and iron construction. The historic building continues to be used as a gallery and studios to this day and has undergone at least two major restorations.

The blocky building at 22 South 40th Street may not be the most historic, nor the most heralded building on this list, but in a time when so many of Furness’s works are getting—or already have been—torn down around the city, it’s important to note the ones that still have some life ahead. This place definitely falls into that category. Designed in 1874, this three-story building is the subject of an upcoming $2.5 million restoration by U3 Ventures, which bought the place last year. They plan to restore the building, which is currently covered in tin siding, to its early 20th century glory. When it’s finished, the interior should be something pretty spectacular—it already has columns and 17 foot high ceilings on the first floor.

Toward the later end of Furness’s career, Philly began to see a more reserved and conservative version of the architect’s work. Take the Girard Trust Bank building, for example, which Furness designed in 1905 as an ode to the Pantheon in Rome. Fun fact, though: Next door to the domed building used to be home to a 12-story Furness high-rise, the headquarters of West End Trust and Safe Deposit Company. You can see a portion of it in the photo below, before it was razed. Today, it’s home to the Girard Building, which is now the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
