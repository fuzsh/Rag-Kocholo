        "text": "Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.\n\nDo not travel to Russia due to the consequences of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces. U.S. citizens may face harassment or detention by Russian security officials, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, limited flights into and out of Russia, and the possibility of terrorism. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia. The Department has determined that there is a continued risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by Russian authorities. U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should leave immediately.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy is operating with reduced staffing, and the Russian government has restricted travel for embassy personnel. Furthermore, all U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services.\n\nThere have been reports of drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine as well as in Moscow, Kazan, and St. Petersburg. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.\n\nRussia may refuse to recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship. Russia has denied consular officers visits to detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens. The Russian government has forced citizens with dual nationality to join the Russian military and prevented them from leaving the country. In 2022, the Russian government mobilized citizens for its invasion of Ukraine. Military conscription continues.\n\nIn Russia, the rights to peaceful assembly and free speech are not always protected. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who joined protests. Moreover, there are many reports of Russians being detained for social media posts.\n\nU.S. citizens should know that U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the U.S. to Russia is nearly impossible.\n\nCommercial flight options are minimal and are often unavailable on short notice. If you wish to depart Russia, you should make independent arrangements. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in leaving the country, and transportation options may suddenly become even more restricted.\n\nClick here for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.\n\nU.S. Embassy staff generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns. Recently, the FAA downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2. Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights in some Russian areas, including the Moscow Flight Information Region (FIR), the Samara FIR (UWWW), and the Rostov-na-Donu (URRV) FIR within 160NM of the boundaries of the Dnipro (UKDV) Flight Information Regions. Check the FAA's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices for more information.\n\nCountry Summary:\n\nRussian officials have interrogated and threatened U.S. citizens without cause. This includes former and current U.S. government and military personnel and private U.S. citizens engaged in business. U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.\n\nRussian authorities may not notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen and may delay U.S. consular assistance. Russian security services also target foreign and international organizations they consider “undesirable.”\n\nRussian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges, denied them fair treatment, and convicted them without credible evidence. Furthermore, Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to Russia.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar. Under martial law, authorities can set curfews, seize property, and restrict movement. The Russian government may detain foreigners, forcibly relocate residents, and limit public gatherings. U.S. citizens should avoid all travel to these areas.\n\nRussian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for “acting against Russia's interests.” Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting \"anti-Russian\" groups and punished individuals for criticizing the government or military. The Russian government's current \"LGBT propaganda\" law bans discussion of LGBTQI+ related topics. In November 2023, the Supreme Court labeled the so-called \"international LGBT movement\" as extremist. This decision effectively made it a crime to support the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons in Russia.\n\nTerrorists continue to plan attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident proved they can strike suddenly. Terrorists may target tourist areas, transport hubs, and markets. They may also target government buildings, hotels, clubs, restaurants, and places of worship. Parks, events, schools, and airports are also potential targets. U.S. government employees under Embassy (Chief of Mission) security responsibility are not permitted to travel to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to those areas.\n\nThe international community does not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea and does not acknowledge Russia’s purported annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea and there is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas. There is intense fighting across these regions and Russian authorities there have abused both foreigners and locals. Authorities have specifically targeted individuals who are seen as challenging Russia’s authority.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv administers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the conflict limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to Russia.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Russia:\n\nRead the information on what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency overseas.\n\nConsider the risks involved in having dual U.S.- Russian nationality.\n\nHave a contingency plan in place that does not rely on U.S. government help. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nFollow news for any important events and update your plans based on the new information.\n\nEnsure travel documents are valid and easily accessible.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). This will allow you to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Russia.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nBefore traveling to Russia, consider the current Travel Advisory.\n\nThe Travel Advisory for Russia is Level 4, Do Not Travel. The Department of State recommends U.S. citizens do not travel to Russia due to the consequences of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces. U.S. citizens may face harassment or detention by Russian security officials, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, limited flights into and out of Russia, and the possibility of terrorism. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia. The Department has determined that there is a continued risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by Russian authorities. U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should leave immediately.\n\nRussian authorities strictly enforce all visa and immigration laws. The Embassy of the Russian Federation website provides the most up to date information regarding visa regulations. In accordance with Russia’s Entry-Exit Law, Russian authorities may deny entry or reentry into Russia for five years or more and cancel the visas of foreigners who have committed two administrative violations within the past three years. Activities that are not specifically covered by the traveler’s visa may result in an administrative violation and deportation.\n\nUnder a bilateral agreement signed in 2012, qualified U.S. applicants for humanitarian, private, tourist, and business visas may request and receive multiple-entry visas with a validity of three years or a single entry, three-month validity visa. (Please note that other types of visas are not part of the agreement, and those visa holders should pay close attention to the terms of their visas.) You cannot enter Russia prior to the date on your visa, and you must exit Russia before your visa expires.

Do not attempt to enter Russia before the date shown on your visa. If you are staying in Russia for more than seven days, you must register your visa and migration card with the General Administration for Migration Issues of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nStudents and English teachers should be certain that their activities are in strict keeping with their visa type. U.S. travelers in Russia on a student visa are prohibited by Russian law from teaching or coaching English for pay or as an unpaid volunteer.. It is a visa violation that may subject you to detention and deportation.\n\nTransit visas: We recommend that all passengers transiting through Russia obtain a Russian transit visa.\n\nWith the exceptions noted below, travelers are not required to have a transit visa if they are transiting through an international airport in Russia, do not leave the Customs zone, and depart from the same airport within 24 hours.\n\nTravelers must have a Russian transit visa if they plan to transit through Russia by land in route to a third country or if they transfer to another airport.\n\nTravelers must possess a Russian transit visa in addition to a Belarusian visa if their travel route either to or from Belarus goes through Russia.\n\nDual Nationals: Anyone entering Russia who has claim to Russian citizenship, regardless of any other citizenship they hold, is subject to Russian law and accountable to Russian authorities for all obligations of a Russian citizen, including required military service. Russia may refuse to recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship. Russia has denied consular officers visits to detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.\n\nU.S.-Russian dual nationals and Russian citizens who are Legal Permanent residents of the United States must register their dual nationality/foreign residency. Registration forms and further information (in Russian only) can be found on the website of the General Administration for Migration Issues of the Interior Ministry of Russia. Dual U.S.-Russian citizens who have not registered have been arrested.\n\nU.S.-Russian dual nationals must both enter and exit on a Russian passport. You will not be permitted to depart on an expired passport. Applying for a passport can take several months.\n\nU.S.-Russian dual nationals who return to Russia on a “Repatriation Certificate” are only permitted to enter Russia and will not be permitted to depart Russia until they obtain a valid Russian passport.\n\nMinors who also have Russian citizenship and are traveling alone or in the company of adults who are not their parents, must carry a Russian passport as well as their parents’ notarized consent for the trip. Parents can contact, a Russian embassy or consulate or a U.S. notary public to notarize a letter of consent. If you use a U.S. notary public, then the notarized document must be apostilled (authenticated), translated into Russian, and properly affixed. Russian authorities will prevent Russian citizen minors from entering or leaving Russia if they cannot present a properly notarized consent letter.\n\nCrimea: Follow the guidance in the Department’s Travel Advisory for Ukraine and do not travel to the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nDocumentary Requirements for obtaining a Russian visa: Consult with the Embassy of the Russian Federation for detailed explanations of documentary requirements.\n\nHIV/AIDS Entry Restrictions: Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to, and foreign residents of, Russia. Applicants for longer-term tourist and work visas or residence permits are required to undergo an HIV/AIDS test.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nTerrorism: Terrorist groups, transnational and local terrorist organizations, and lone actors inspired by extremist ideology and messaging continue plotting possible attacks in Russia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning. They may target tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.\n\nTerrorists have carried out attacks in Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, and bomb threats against public venues are common. If you are at a location that receives a bomb threat, follow all instructions from the local police and security services.\n\nNorth Caucasus Region: A risk of civil and political unrest continues throughout the North Caucasus region including Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Stavropol, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, and Kabardino-Balkariya. Local criminal gangs have kidnapped foreigners, including U.S. citizens, for ransom. In the Republic of Chechnya, local authorities may harbor particular hostility towards U.S. travelers.\n\nDo not travel to Chechnya or any other areas in the North Caucasus region.\n\nIf you reside in these areas, depart immediately.\n\nU.S. government employees under Embassy (Chief of Mission) security responsibility are prohibited from traveling to the region, due to ongoing security concerns.\n\nThe U.S. government has no ability to assist U.S. citizens in the North Caucasus Region.\n\nMt. Elbrus:\n\nDo not attempt to climb Mt. Elbrus, as individuals must pass close to volatile and insecure areas of the North Caucasus region.\n\nCrimea:\n\nDo not travel to this Russian occupied territory of Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Crimea. Contact the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv for questions regarding consular services.\n\nU.S. government employees under Embassy (Chief of Mission) security responsibility are prohibited from traveling to Crimea. See the Department’s Travel Advisory for Ukraine.\n\nHarassment: Harassment of U.S.-based religious and student groups can take place in Russia, and you should be aware of the possibility of anti-U.S. sentiment or harassment. U.S. citizens, including current and former U.S. government and military personnel, may be subject to additional scrutiny by Russian security services. Remain alert, avoid any protests or demonstrations, and use discretion when commenting publicly on political developments.

Please comply with the requests of local law enforcement officials.\n\nReport harassment or crimes to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.\n\nDemonstrations:\n\nAvoid public demonstrations. U.S. citizens who have participated in demonstrations have been arrested by the Russian authorities.\n\nCrime: Crimes against tourists do occur at popular tourist sites and on public transportation. U.S. citizens have been victims of serious crimes when visiting Russia. Russian authorities are not always willing to investigate crimes impartially and thoroughly.\n\nBe cautious and aware of your surroundings.\n\nExercise caution in the vicinity of large crowds.\n\nDo not leave bags unattended.\n\nNever leave your drink unattended in a bar or club. Alcohol was a significant factor in most criminal activity reported by foreign visitors.\n\nReport Credit card or ATM card theft to the credit card company or issuing bank immediately.\n\nAvoid carrying large sums of cash.\n\nCybercrime: Cybercrime is a major issue in Russia. Hackers and organized crime groups collaborate, especially targeting the financial sector. They use malware, spam, spear phishing, and social engineering to infect, steal, or compromise personal information. Therefore, U.S. citizens and companies must be alert and use cyber security measures to lower their risks.\n\nU.S. citizens have no reasonable expectation of privacy in Russia. Telephone and electronic communications are subject to surveillance at any time and without advisory, which may compromise sensitive information. The Russian System for Operational-Investigative Activities (SORM) legally permits authorities to monitor and record all data that traverses Russia’s networks.\n\nSee the Department of State and the FBI pages for additional information on scams.\n\nVictims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 02 or 102, or 112 if using a mobile phone, and the U.S. Embassy at +7 495 728-5000.\n\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. U.S. law enforcement agencies generally do not have jurisdiction to investigate crimes against U.S. citizens that occur on Russian territory.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical needs\n\nSupport in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport.\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections of equipment and facilities are infrequent Hazardous areas may lack proper signage, and construction or maintenance staff are often uncertified. In case of injury, medical care is mainly available in major cities. First responders are usually unable to reach areas outside of major cities quickly. U.S. citizens are advised to get medical evacuation insurance.\n\nArrest Notification: Russia routinely fails to meet its obligation to inform the U.S. Embassy of arrests of U.S. citizens. If you are detained, ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. If you are a U.S.-Russian dual citizen, the police or prison officials may refuse to contact the U.S. Embassy on your behalf. Your U.S. passport does not protect you from arrest or prosecution. See our for further information.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to all Russian laws while in Russia. If you violate these laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, fined, imprisoned, or expelled, and may be banned from re-entering Russia.\n\nSome acts committed outside the United States are prosecutable as crimes in the United StatesFor examples, see crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nYou can be arrested, detained, fined, deported, and banned for five years or more if you are found to have violated Russian immigration law.\n\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Russia are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\n\nYou can be detained for not carrying your passport with you.\n\nYou can be jailed immediately for driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\nIt is illegal to pay for goods and services in U.S. dollars, except at authorized retail establishments.\n\nYou can be arrested for attempting to leave the country with antiques, even if they were legally purchased from licensed vendors.

You may obtain certificates from the Russian Ministry of Culture.\n\nRetain all receipts for high-value items, including caviar.\n\nYou must have advance approval to bring satellite telephones to Russia.\n\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) and other radio electronic devices, and their use, are subject to special rules and regulations in Russia. Contact the Russian Customs Service for required permissions.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: Russian authorities have arrested, fined, and even deported travelers for religious activities. The Russian government recognizes four religions: Orthodox Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. There are strict regulations on religious missionary work of any kind. To engage in missionary work, travelers must obtain authorization from a recognized religious group. Proselytizing outside of a registered place of worship is illegal. U.S. citizens have been detained for religious activities not allowed on tourist or humanitarian visas. See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report.\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: Russian law bans distributing \"LGBT propaganda,” and the Russian Supreme Court has declared the so-called “international LGBT movement” an extremist organization, effectively prohibiting all expression related to LGBTQI+ issues.\n\nDiscrimination based on sexual orientation is widespread in Russia. Acts of violence and harassment targeting LGBTQI+ individuals occur.\n\nGovernment officials have made derogatory comments about LGBTQI+ persons and violence against the LGBTQI+ community continues.\n\nThere have been credible reports of arrest, torture, and extrajudicial killing of LGBTQI+ persons in Chechnya allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.\n\nSee our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Getting around in Russia is often difficult for persons with mobility issues. In general, public transportation is not accommodating to people with disabilities. The Moscow Metro, though extremely safe and efficient in other areas, is generally not accessible to persons with disabilities.\n\nSidewalks are narrow and uneven.\n\nMobility is usually easier in major cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nCrossing streets in large cities can be difficult, since it usually requires the use of a pedestrian underpass. These underpasses include stairs, steep ramps, and no elevators.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers."
