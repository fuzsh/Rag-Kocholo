        "text": "Over the past two decades, Russia’s political regime has become a personalized form of a consolidated autocracy that is firmly tied to President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDomestically, this regime is characterized by:\n\n• the fact that the president and his inner circle make all strategic decisions with no accountability to the legislative and judiciary branches of power;\n\n• the exceptional role played by the presidential administration (also referred to as the Presidential Executive Office of Russia) in determining the national agenda, both in domestic and foreign policy;\n\n• an even more pronounced decision-making role for the “siloviki” (representatives of security agencies and the Ministry of Interior);\n\n• the excessive centralization of the relationship between Moscow and the regions and the dominance of vertical over horizontal decision-making;\n\n• the prevalence of serious restrictions being placed on political competition and pluralism, as evinced by the introduction of several laws that have restricted media and civil society independence.\n\nIn foreign policy, Russia promotes multipolarity and exceptionalism among great powers such as China and the United States. The Kremlin’s overt hostility toward the United States and EU nations became evident as Russia sought to exert political influence abroad through a blend of state-sponsored propaganda, the backing of fringe parties and through illegal cyber activities.\n\nMany of Russia’s leaders hold a firm belief that their country, as the largest in the world, must maintain its status as a great power and not be subservient to any other state or union. Consequently, they have consistently asserted that the European Union and the United States have disregarded Russia’s national security interests.\n\nRussia, therefore, decided to prioritize its security interests by trying to build buffer zones along its western and certain southern borders. These interests, deemed vital by Russian leadership and backed by the majority of the Russian people, are considered more important than the imperatives of economic development. Instead of embracing modernization, the Russian leadership has chosen to pursue its interpretation of national greatness by seeking to incorporate an independent Ukraine, seemingly disregarding the potential consequences of reduced international competitiveness and potential marginalization in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe initiation of the conflict with Ukraine in February 2022 further solidified President Putin’s regime of personal rule. In Russia, the war is officially labeled a “special military operation,” a term endorsed by both houses of the Russian parliament, various political parties, and the majority of the country’s population. Protests against the war and partial mobilization have been met with harsh state suppression, and dissenting perspectives on the war are officially branded as “betrayals of national interests.”\n\nA late 2022 presidential decree mandated an increase in the size of the Russian army to 1.5 million personnel. To rally society under wartime conditions, the Russian leadership implemented measures to reduce pluralism and imposed stricter penalties for dissent through a comprehensive set of federal laws and presidential decrees. Independent media outlets and civil society structures with political agendas were systematically dismantled, and numerous foreign missions were shuttered during the early stages of the conflict. Russia’s membership in the Council of Europe was terminated.\n\nIn response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, the West has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia. By early 2023, the European Union had enacted ten packages of sanctions. While the Russian government has managed to mitigate some of the adverse effects of these sanctions thus far, it is unclear how long this will continue.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia emerged as an independent nation, still possessing vast territory and diversity but in dire need of profound political and economic transformation. The country’s elites were deeply divided and lacked consensus on a reform strategy. This division was primarily between the supporters of President Boris Yeltsin, known as democrats, and those aligned with the Supreme Soviet, who leaned conservative. The Federal Treaty of 1992 played a crucial role in preventing the territorial disintegration of Russia, similar to what had occurred during the Soviet Union.\n\nIn December 1993, a new Russian constitution was ratified through a public referendum following the violent dissolution of parliament in October – an act viewed by many as unconstitutional. This constitution maintained a political balance that favored a strong executive, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nUnder President Yeltsin, the discrepancies between constitutional provisions and political reality remained substantial. The transition from a planned to a market economy led to hyperinflation and severe economic hardships for many Russians. Simultaneously, the Yeltsin administration created an environment in which actors like oligarchs, who lacked democratic legitimacy but possessed enormous wealth, wielded significant influence over political decision-making.\n\nPolitical and economic transformation in Russia was initiated but remained incomplete, particularly in terms of democratization. The push to transition toward a market economy gained traction once President Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin as prime minister in 1999 and later as his successor following Putin’s presidential election victory in 2000. This transfer of power coincided with Russia’s growing financial power due to surging oil and raw material prices. President Putin enjoyed sustained support from a majority of voters throughout most of his first two presidential terms (from 2000 to 2008) and subsequent election wins in 2012 and 2018.\n\nStability, achieved through a “strong state,” became the primary goal, often at the expense of democratic principles. Press freedoms were curtailed, NGOs faced harassment, and severe human rights violations occurred during the second Chechen War.\n\nWhereas authoritarian tendencies have characterized the political transformation of Russia under President Putin throughout his tenure, economic policy was initially dominated by liberal ideas and only gave way during his second term to an increased focus on gaining control over “strategic” economic sectors (aimed in part to enrich Putin’s entourage and himself). Driven by rising global oil prices, Russia enjoyed a decade of robust economic growth, with GDP increasing by an average of 6.9% annually until 2008.\n\nAlthough the government has invested heavily in various large-scale social projects, socioeconomic development has been slowed by widespread corruption, an extensive shadow economy, and the executive branch’s manipulation of the judiciary. At the end of his second presidential term, Putin accepted a constitutional limit of two consecutive presidential terms. He hand-picked Dmitry Medvedev as his successor, who then appointed Putin as prime minister, confirming suspicions of Putin’s continued influence.\n\nDuring Medvedev’s presidency, some steps were envisioned to modernize and liberalize the country. These included a “reset” in relations with the United States, the signing of a new START agreement, and proposals for a new security architecture in Europe. A “Partnership for Modernization” initiative with the European Union was also agreed upon, and political freedoms increased.\n\nHowever, a few months before the next presidential election, Putin and Medvedev announced their intention to swap roles. Massively falsified Duma elections and the subsequent protests in urban centers, especially Moscow. This prompted the Kremlin to launch a propaganda campaign portraying the West, particularly the United States, as a threat to Russian state media, using the so-called color revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia as examples of how the West was undermining Russia’s security.\n\nThe state media machinery, developed in the 2000s and further streamlined later, proved highly effective in promoting this narrative. The massive propaganda effort, along with improved government performance, greatly contributed to an increased level of support for the state in Russian society. This support is focused primarily on Russia’s role in the world and less on domestic politics. Russians remained critical of the political elite, with the exception of the institution of the president.\n\nRussia’s foreign policy, touted as a series of successes, has become a key instrument of domestic consolidation. A particular focus was placed on neighboring Ukraine, which culminated in the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and fostered unrest in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn 2016, the presidential party, United Russia, decisively won parliamentary elections. Putin secured his fourth six-year presidential term in 2018, and the constitutional reform of 2020 has made it possible for him to remain in power until 2036. The 2021 Duma election has once again sealed United Russia’s dominance in the country’s party landscape.\n\nRussia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic came rather late. Russia did not declare a “state of emergency,” and Moscow shifted blame for unpopular measures during the crisis to regional authorities. Modest additional measures of social support implemented in 2020 were primarily attributable to the federal center. Both federal and regional authorities concealed and falsified information about infection rates and mortality from the virus during the pandemic.\n\nRussia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, which has continued for over a year, can be seen as a natural progression of Putin’s regime of personal rule. Public dissent is rare and found mostly among the highly educated, many of whom have emigrated. Critical voices within the presidential administration and the government are almost nonexistent. The leadership’s current political trajectory contradicts years of reform efforts and threatens to drive the country into an abyss.\n\nThe state is mainly secular. According to the constitution, there is a separation of church and state. However, religious dogmas and, notably, the Russian Orthodox Church wield significant influence over legal and political institutions. This influence has grown stronger, especially since around 2013, as the regime has increasingly emphasized “traditional values” as a central tenet of its ideology.\n\nSome government officials openly express their religious preferences, and the church frequently intervenes in cultural matters. The Kremlin administration has utilized traditional Russian Orthodox and so-called family values to shape a new ideological identity, which has gained prominence in the lead-up to the war. The Russian Orthodox Church has long advocated for stricter abortion laws, and in 2021, Russia, a country with a historically high abortion rate, implemented new restrictions, including mandatory waiting periods and counseling.\n\nThe country’s law on religion recognizes Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism as the four “traditional” religions, with a special role attributed to the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). The government provides the ROC with tax exemptions and access to state resources. It also financially supports the construction of new churches, the restoration of religious historical sites, and the production of religious literature. Additionally, the ROC is involved in shaping religious education curricula in schools. Since 2014, Russia has had a law that criminalizes insults to religious believers, which has been used to prosecute critics of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nIn September 2022, Patriarch Kyril offered forgiveness of sins to all those who died in the war against Ukraine. The Orthodox Church publicly consecrates various types of weapons, including rockets, bombs, tanks and military vehicles.\n\nMoscow’s chief rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, refused to support the war and was compelled to leave Russia in March 2022. In December, he urged Jews to depart from Russia as soon as possible.\n\nThe constitution guarantees judicial independence. In practice, judicial independence is heavily impaired by undue government control, high levels of corruption and political trials in which courts follow direct orders from the executive at the national and regional levels. The Constitutional Court of Russia tends to consistently rule in favor of the executive branch, and the higher the political stakes, the more intense the pressure, including directives from top state officials.\n\nAlthough the law provides for a fair and public trial, executive interference and judicial corruption undermine this right, leading to many trials with predetermined outcomes and extremely low acquittal rates. For instance, in 2020, courts acquitted only 0.34% of all defendants.\n\nIn Russia, judges of the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court and Supreme Arbitration Court are appointed by the Federation Council upon nomination by the president of the Russian Federation. Other federal judges are appointed by the president based on recommendations from the relevant qualification collegiums. District court judges are appointed directly by the president. Candidates are required to be at least 25 years old, possess a higher legal education (typically a specialist degree), have at least five years of legal experience, and pass an examination administered by the Ministry of Justice. The quality of legal education is generally low, especially outside of major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, and the legal education system is considered to be riddled with corruption.\n\nIn the past, some degree of judicial independence was maintained through international influence, but this has changed over time. The 2020 constitutional reform explicitly established the primacy of national constitutional norms over international law as a constitutional norm.\n\nThe war in Ukraine prompted Russia to distance itself further from international organizations that had compelled it to abide by international law. On March 15, 2022, Russia initiated the process of withdrawing from the Council of Europe (CoE), and the following day, the CoE Committee of Ministers decided to expel Russia from the organization immediately.\n\nCivil rights in Russia are systematically violated. There are no mechanisms or institutions to protect residents. Both the state and businesses, particularly those connected to the state, engage in widespread violations. These violations encompass a range of civil rights, including the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, freedom of speech, religion, press and assembly, the right to petition, and the right to be free from sexual discrimination.\n\nHuman rights activists regularly document instances of discrimination in Russia based on factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion and political preference. This discrimination extends to the treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals, with laws against “gay propaganda” and numerous reports of violence. Ethnic and religious minorities, including the Tatars, Chechens and Jehovah’s Witnesses, have also faced discrimination. In addition to this, political discrimination is prevalent, with government critics experiencing harassment, arrest and imprisonment.\n\nElections in Russia have not been free or fair for several years. Following the commencement of the war against Ukraine, the authorities initiated a comprehensive crackdown on independent media and NGOs, including restrictions on access to popular media outlet websites. In 2022, significant human rights organizations like Memorial ceased their activities or were liquidated.\n\nState prosecution has launched biased and selective investigations against many politicians, independent journalists and NGOs. Harassment of minorities and LGBTQ+ activists has become commonplace, with high-ranking Russian officials even supporting extremely negative media coverage. In 2021/2022, NGOs advocating for LGBTQ+ community rights in Russia were classified as “foreign agents,” and media outlets and internet resources were blocked and fined for “LGBTQ+ propaganda.” Police often refuse to accept complaints from victims of violence due to homophobia. Incidents of detentions, abductions, torture and murders have been documented in the North Caucasus regions.\n\nReligious groups and human rights NGOs have reported ongoing investigations, detentions, arrests, imprisonment, torture and physical abuse of individuals based on their religious beliefs or affiliations. Authorities often accuse religious minority groups of extremism and terrorism. Furthermore, by law, the government can designate international religious-affiliated organizations or foreign religious groups as “undesirable.”\n\nWhile Russia has laws aimed at protecting individual privacy, such as personal data protection and privacy in communication, concerns have grown over government surveillance and censorship that curtails freedom of expression online.\n\nRussia’s landscape of interest groups is notably limited, and crucial social interests are often under-represented, a situation that has further deteriorated since February 2022. Only a handful of groups wield significant influence, primarily comprising lobbyist organizations that advocate for business interests.\n\nTrade unions and NGOs in Russia are weak and are subject to numerous restrictions when expressing criticism of the government’s policies. Since 2012, politically active foreign-funded NGOs have been compelled by law to register as “foreign agents,” a designation that has been significantly expanded to encompass any unwelcome media outlets and individuals with no foreign connections whatsoever.\n\nNGOs focusing on social issues and charitable activities continue to operate, and the authorities extend “presidential grants” to NGOs and business associations that do not challenge the government’s agenda. Additionally, numerous state-sponsored civil organizations exist.\n\nThe Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP) stands out as a powerful economic lobbyist group that actively engages with the state. However, it does not effectively represent broader societal interests. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, many RSPP members found themselves subject to Western sanctions, leading some to retire or leave the country. The Union has attempted to adapt, and, concerning mobilization for the war, it has proposed a new system of criteria for exceptions to retain highly trained and valuable personnel.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church plays a distinctive and pivotal role in supporting officialdom, despite the constitutional separation of church and state. In practice, the Russian Orthodox Church enjoys privileged status within the state and in comparison to other religions. The Kremlin administration has utilized traditional Russian Orthodox and so-called family values to construct a new ideological identity.\n\nFor years, the Russian population has regarded the Orthodox Church as one of the most trusted institutions in the country. From 2015 to 2022, these sentiments were increasingly expressed in state-controlled media outlets and influenced cultural and educational policies, notably shaping the foundation of Russian identity.\n\nPublic approval of democracy and its norms and procedures, as indicated by public polls, is generally low. However, society tends to perceive the current Russian political regime as a form of democracy. When asked about democratic principles, including democratic elections, accountability and civil rights, most of the population does not view any of these principles as essential. There appears to be a passive acceptance of democratic norms but no principled opposition to violations of these norms.\n\nBased on polls conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM) and the Levada Center, it can be estimated that around 10% of the population are fervent supporters of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. On the opposite end of the spectrum, approximately a quarter of the population openly opposes Western-style liberal democracy, often preferring models that emphasize a strong government with flexible state institutions not constrained by public influence. There is minimal trust in democratic institutions such as parliament, political parties or the press.\n\nAll polls consistently demonstrate that among young people aged 14 to 29, support for democracy is slightly higher. They desire greater opportunities for youth involvement in politics. However, they, too, have limited trust in democratic institutions like political parties or parliament.\n\nOne institution that has consistently received high approval ratings over the years is that of the president. In December 2022, according to the Levada Center, approximately 80% of respondents expressed approval of President Putin’s policies.\n\nPublic attitudes regarding the war in Ukraine offer insights into the level of approval for democratic norms. Opinion polls conducted by both official and independent institutions indicate that 70% to 80% of respondents in Russia support the so-called special military operation in Ukraine. These numbers remained relatively unchanged throughout 2022. Additionally, about 60% of respondents believed that they were not morally responsible for the events unfolding in Ukraine.\n\nThe level of trust among the population remains low. The few remaining autonomous, self-organized groups are often of a spontaneous and temporary nature. The COVID-19 pandemic has further eroded the already low levels of interpersonal trust and trust in societal institutions. Currently, there is insufficient reliable data to assess the impact of the war on trust.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation in 2021, 48% of Russians (and 56% of young people) exhibit initial distrust toward strangers. If someone they know disappoints or lets them down, 36% of Russians indicate that they would permanently lose trust in that individual.\n\nOn March 16, 2022, Putin publicly called for the “self-purification” of society from “national traitors,” while his deputy at the Security Council, Dmitri Medvedev, labeled criticism of the Russian authorities during the war in Ukraine as “traitorous.” The state apparatus initiated “purges,” a term historically associated with the deadly policy under Stalin in the mid-1930s against any form of opposition.\n\nIn November 2022, Putin signed a decree titled “On Approval of the Fundamentals of State Policy to Preserve and Strengthen Russia’s Traditional Spiritual and Moral Values.” This decree aims to shield Russia from “sociocultural threats” and allocate state budget funds to efforts aimed at bolstering “traditional values,” which are defined by the state rather than society. There is growing concern among the populace about with whom they can freely engage in conversation.\n\nThe most recent Human Capital Index from the World Bank, evaluated for 2020, places Russia at a value of 0.6. Russia ranks among the top 10 countries globally that have improved their human capital over the past decade, along with Türkiye and Ukraine. Nonetheless, the military aggression is expected to have a profoundly negative impact on this development.\n\nPoverty in Russia is less prevalent than extensive inequality. Russia is often named as one of the world’s most unequal countries. In 2021, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reported that Russia’s financial elite, consisting of approximately 500 wealthiest individuals, controlled 40% of the country’s entire household wealth. The Gini index value for Russia, estimated by the World Bank, was 36.0 as of 2020, down from 37.7 in 2019 and 42.3 in 2007.\n\nKey indicators reflect a relatively high level of socioeconomic development in Russia. According to the 2021/2022 Human Development Index (HDI) report, Russia ranks 52, placing it in the category of “very high human development,” alongside countries like Romania and Brunei.\n\nThere is no evidence of significant social exclusion based on poverty, education or gender. The 2021 UNDP Gender Inequality Index indicates a steady improvement for Russia, with a score of 0.203. The World Bank reported a gradual decline in the official poverty rate in Russia before the war in Ukraine, decreasing from 12.6% in 2018 to 11.4% in 2021. However, real disposable income has remained stagnant or declined for five consecutive years. The World Bank attributes this economic outlook to the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, particularly in the medium and long term.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a drop in real disposable income and an increase in unemployment, benefiting the country’s wealthiest individuals while negatively affecting the living standards of the poorest.\n\nSocioeconomic disparities are significant across different regions of Russia. Large cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg have achieved development levels close to those of middle-income European countries. Some regions have shown improvement, such as the resource-rich Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District. However, the vast rural periphery, especially in the North Caucasus, experiences very low levels of development.\n\nData published by the Russian Ministry of Finance for the period from 2019 to 2025 reveal a notable increase in spending on national defense and security in 2022. This growth is expected to continue in subsequent years, funded by cuts in education and health care.\n\nForeign trade follows nondiscrimination principles in form but is significantly distorted by state interference, special rules, tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Russia’s economic integration into the world market is selective, and in the 2021 Competitiveness Report by the Institute for Management Development (IMD), Russia was ranked 45th out of 65 countries.\n\nHowever, significant barriers to free trade emerged following Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Western economic sanctions have been imposed, and the Russian authorities have retaliated with a wide range of counter-sanctions targeting “unfriendly” countries, including the United States, the European Union and several others. The Russian central bank reported a 9% decline in imports in 2022, although imports from countries like China and Türkiye increased considerably.\n\nThe Russian government often claims that these sanctions promote import substitution and help revitalize domestic production. The scope of sanctions continued to expand throughout 2022 and early 2023. Major Russian banks, such as VTB and Sberbank, were disconnected from the SWIFT payment system, and MasterCard and Visa payment systems were suspended in Russia. Conversely, the Russian MIR Card was suspended in most other countries, including Eurasian Economic Union member states. The assets of the Russian central bank and several individuals, including politicians, were frozen. The sale, delivery or transfer of aircraft, spare parts, equipment, software and electronic gear to Russia was banned.\n\nThe United States and other countries of the “collective West” decided to terminate trade relations with Russia and Belarus and imposed a gradual ban on energy imports from Russia. EU countries also imposed an embargo on Russian coal imports and expressed their readiness to completely eliminate oil and gas imports from Russia.\n\nIn response to Western sanctions, Russia issued a decree titled “On the Application of Special Economic Measures in Connection with Unfriendly Actions of the United States and Their Adjoining Countries.” This decree prohibits Russian residents from obtaining foreign loans in a foreign currency and depositing foreign currencies in bank accounts outside Russia. Exporters are required to sell 80% of their foreign currency earnings to protect the exchange rate of the ruble.\n\nRussia is a driving force behind the Eurasian Economic Union, which has a single market of approximately 180 million people. Together with its members Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, this customs union has implemented standard tariffs and removed many customs duties and trade barriers, with exceptions for protective measures to prevent price dumping.\n\nMonetary stability has been an important and broadly shared economic policy objective. While the monetary authority is theoretically independent, it is not entirely detached from the demands and uncertainties of the autocratic regime, a fact that became evident in the wake of the war and its detrimental impact on Russia’s economy.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Federal Reserve, the real effective exchange rate of the ruble was 75.07 (Index 2010: 100) in February 2022. The value of the dollar against the ruble surged dramatically after the outbreak of the war, reaching as high as RUB 120 per dollar (up from the usual range of RUB 70 to RUB 80) in early March. Following this peak, the dollar’s value gradually declined, hovering around RUB 60 per dollar until the end of November. This represented the strongest performance of the ruble in years, though it still had limited convertibility. Bloomberg Economics predicts a 15% to 20% depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar in 2023.\n\nThis turnaround was made possible by the central bank’s draconian measures, including a rapid increase in the bank interest rate from 9.5% to 20% shortly after the invasion, gradually decreasing to 7.5% in 2022. The surge in energy prices also contributed to the ruble’s strength, as these revenues were settled in rubles starting in April 2022.\n\nIn December 2022, the ruble began to fall, which was noticeable not only in the exchange rate against the dollar but also against other currencies like the Kazakh tenge. This decline was linked to the European Union’s imposition of a cap on oil prices, essentially a means to reduce the inflow of foreign currency into Russia through oil and gas revenues, which constitute a significant portion of exports.\n\nConsumer price inflation followed a similar trajectory. In 2021, the World Bank reported an average consumer price index inflation of 6.7%. According to Statista, by January 2023, the inflation rate in Russia had risen to nearly 11.8% compared to the same month the previous year. This figure represented a decrease from the almost 18% inflation rate recorded in April 2022 and seemed to align more with inflation trends in most OECD countries. Furthermore, official figures indicated a continued downward trend in inflation.\n\nThe government’s budgetary policies generally promote fiscal stability but lack institutional safeguards, making them susceptible to ad hoc policy changes. Over the past two decades, Russia has consistently followed an austerity policy, resulting in budget surpluses and the accumulation of substantial macroeconomic reserves. As a result, its fiscal position has proved resilient, enabling it to withstand not only the pandemic but also the unprecedented wave of sanctions, at least until now.\n\nBefore Russia initiated its invasion of Ukraine, the government had set a target of achieving a state budget surplus of 1% of GDP for 2022. However, the budget deficit eventually reached RUB 3.3 trillion, equivalent to 2.3% of GDP, according to the finance minister. This shift into negative territory toward the end of 2022 can be attributed to declining revenues from energy exports and the growing financial strain of the Ukraine war on state finances.\n\nIn 2022, Russia’s public debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 17%, slightly higher than the average of the past decade. The proportion of external debt within the overall structure is decreasing, while internal debt is on the rise. Specifically, in 2022, external debt accounted for 18% of the total, with internal debt making up the remaining 82%.\n\nOfficial figures show that Russia’s GDP contracted by 2.2% in 2022, which was less severe than initially anticipated. However, considering the strong 4.7% growth recorded in 2021 (according to the World Bank) and the originally expected GDP growth of at least 3% in 2022, this decline is still significant when measured against potential growth. Moreover, it remains uncertain whether the exceedingly optimistic IMF forecast of 0.3% GDP growth in 2023 will materialize. In any case, a substantial portion of this projected growth is expected to come from the burgeoning industrial military sector, which may not provide a comprehensive picture of the Russian economy’s sustainability and development prospects.\n\nIn 2021, according to the central bank, capital outflow from Russia amounted to $74 billion. In 2022, the central bank initially projected a capital outflow of $246 billion but later revised it to $251 billion in October. For 2023, the central bank anticipates a capital outflow of $124 billion.\n\nProperty rights and the regulation of property acquisition are defined by law. Except for the sale of farmland, legal provisions are in place. However, these legal provisions are not consistently enforced or adequately protected, particularly from interference by government entities, influential bureaucrats or well-connected business figures. This situation has remained unchanged during the reporting period, as evident from Russia’s rankings in the International Property Rights Index, where it placed 81st out of 129 countries in 2021 and 85th in the 2022 ranking.\n\nMoreover, in strategic sectors such as the oil and gas industry, the state has systematically diminished the role of private ownership through various means. These include administrative pressures that have resulted in confiscations or negotiated sales. Despite announcements of privatizing state assets over many years, little progress has been made in this regard.\n\nAs of 2022, foreign companies seeking to exit the Russian market and sell their assets require approval from the highest authorities to do so. The proceeds from their businesses are frozen if they originate from “unfriendly countries,” and shareholder rights are suspended.\n\nCertain property rights, especially those related to copyrights and intellectual property, are routinely disregarded. On March 6, 2022, the Russian government issued a decree mandating that patent owners from “unfriendly countries,” such as the United States and the EU, would be paid a compulsory license fee of 0% for the use of their patents. Additionally, another government decree from 2022 authorized Russian companies to import goods without the brand owner’s permission, creating a thriving gray market for goods in which countries like Türkiye, China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan played particularly prominent roles in 2022.\n\nPrivate companies are viewed institutionally as important engines of economic development but are insufficiently protected by existing legal safeguards. Historically, the privatization of state-owned enterprises primarily served clientelist interests. In the 1990s, Russia’s initial privatization efforts resulted in the transfer of significant wealth to a relatively small group of business oligarchs, particularly bankers and executives in the natural gas and oil sectors (the first generation of oligarchs). Additionally, some “strategic” assets, including a substantial portion of Russia’s defense industry, remained under state ownership and were not privatized.\n\nDuring President Putin’s tenure, a second generation of oligarchs has emerged that benefit from their close ties to the president. They have established a network of corrupt banks, notably Bank Rossiya, and companies, particularly in the construction sector. Some of them also assumed leadership positions in state-run entities, especially in the energy sector (e.g., Gazprom and Rosneft) and military industries. All of this was to the personal advantage of the incumbent president.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government did not opt for nationalizing companies or taking equity stakes in struggling firms. The proportion of small and medium-sized businesses in the economy is currently only around 16%, and this figure is on the decline. The insufficient protection of property rights presents a significant obstacle to the vibrancy of the private sector, particularly for SMEs. Following the conflict in Ukraine, it has also become a hindrance to foreign businesses. This is not only due to the deliberate withdrawal of many foreign companies but also because of prohibitive conditions for their sale and instances of de facto expropriation.\n\nIn numerous cases, well-connected individuals from the business world or civil service have managed to strip successful private entrepreneurs of their assets with the assistance of law enforcement agencies, tax authorities and health inspectors. The leadership is well aware of these corporate raids, and President Putin has raised the issue multiple times. However, these concerns have not yielded tangible results, giving the impression of being mere superficial gestures.\n\nSocial safety nets in Russia are relatively well developed, but they do not cover all risks for every segment of the population. A significant portion of the population remains vulnerable to poverty. The percentage of people with incomes below the official poverty line (approximately $14 per day) is expected to increase from 11.4% in 2021 to 12.8% in 2022, representing an increase of 2.6 million people.\n\nRussia has a comprehensive bureaucratic system for social security. However, in practice, bureaucratic efficiency is hampered by widespread red tape and corruption. Special government programs aimed at improving health care and addressing rural poverty have achieved limited success, primarily due to the sheer magnitude of the issues at hand.\n\nThe Russian Federation offers its citizens basic medical insurance, known as OMC (free universal health care). While citizens have the option to purchase privately owned insurance or DMC, only around 5% of the population has it. People covered by OMC do not receive coverage for many essential treatments, which are only available at commercial facilities where patients must pay out of pocket. Moreover, a significant number of imported medicines disappeared from Russian pharmacies after the outbreak of the war in 2022. Due to growing budget constraints, the government plans to reduce health care expenditures. In 2022, health care expenditures amounted to 5.3% of GDP.\n\nUnemployment benefits in Russia are quite low and are designed not to exceed the previous year’s minimum wage level. In 2022, actual unemployment benefits ranged from RUB 1,500 to RUB 12,792 per month. For reference, the average monthly salary in Russia in 2022 was approximately RUB 57,244 (around $1,000).\n\nSince the onset of the war, the government has provided financial assistance to individuals drafted into the Russian army. These benefits encompass free travel, the provision of food and clothing, and compulsory state insurance. Social support measures also include extensions for loan repayments and exemptions from late payment fees.\n\nRussia’s economic performance is poor. Following a notable recovery from the COVID-induced downturn in 2021, the Russian economy faced unprecedented Western sanctions in 2022, leading to a significant negative impact on most fronts. The increasing burden of the ongoing war, extending into 2023, which was unforeseen in its scope and intensity, has exacerbated the country’s economic woes.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the IMF estimated that Russia’s GDP (in current prices) was $2,140 billion or $14,700 per capita. Initially, the Russian government had projected a GDP decline of at least 3% for 2022, but the actual contraction turned out to be 2.2%. In the same year, the federal budget of the Russian Federation showed a deficit of RUB 3.3 trillion, equivalent to 2.3% of GDP, as reported by the finance minister.\n\nSome indicators suggest that the macroeconomic situation may be more challenging than is officially reported. For instance, Russia’s car production plummeted by 67% in 2022, reaching only 450,000 passenger cars, marking the industry’s worst performance since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Retail sales in Russia declined by 6.6% year-on-year in January 2023. The air travel sector was severely impacted due to the closure of airspace and the ban on Western-made aircraft. Several respected economists have raised doubts about the accuracy of the officially reported macroeconomic figures.\n\nAccording to the Russian president, the unemployment rate in Russia in 2022 stood at 3.7%. The previous year, it was approximately 5%, down from 5.6% in 2020. However, this achievement largely reflects the common practice of unpaid or partially paid leave. In 2022, Rosstat estimated inflation at 11.94%, following a 2021 rate of 8.4%.\n\nAs of February 27, 2022, Russia’s credit ratings were at BB according to S&P, but they declined to CC by March 17, 2022. In 2021, the country saw an inflow of FDI amounting to around $38 billion and an outflow of $64 billion. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 further exacerbated the challenging investment climate, resulting in over 1,000 Western companies either ceasing or significantly reducing their operations in Russia. The pressure to disengage from Russia remains substantial in Western countries.\n\nRussia’s industrial sector has witnessed a significant rise in capacity utilization, reaching its highest level since the early 1990s, estimated at 78.5% in October 2022 by the Gaidar Institute. This increase is attributed to the departure of some foreign suppliers, import substitution efforts, and, most notably, the expansion of military production. Military expenditure is expected to surpass five percent of GDP, marking the first time since the Soviet Union’s collapse.\n\nEducation policy ensures a nationwide system of sound education and training, and the research and technology sector is relatively advanced. Investment in education and training is below 4% (2020) of GDP, and investment in research and development is below 1.5% of GDP (2020).\n\nAt the beginning of the 2021/2022 school year, over 8.2 million students were enrolled in basic general education, encompassing grades five to nine, in Russia. The total number of general education students in the country reached approximately 17.3 million. As of 2023, the literacy rate in Russia stands at an impressive 99.72%.\n\nRussia boasts one of the highest tertiary attainment rates globally, with 63% of 25- to 34-year-olds holding tertiary qualifications, compared to the OECD average of 44%.\n\nThe Russian government has designated education as a top priority and one of the four “national projects” to receive significant funding. According to the World Bank, Russia is among the top 10 countries globally in terms of improving human capital development over the past decade, leading to a U.N. Education Index score of 0.823.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, most schools and universities were temporarily closed, and few institutions were adequately prepared for e-learning. The conflict in Ukraine has had significant implications for both secondary and higher education. In the early days of the war, Russian schools received guidelines for teaching students in grades 7 to 11 about the conflict in Ukraine, presenting the official perspective on the reasons for the “special military operation” and alleged NATO threats.\n\nThe administrations of major Russian universities and the Academy of Sciences openly supported the “special military operation.” On March 4, 2022, an open letter from the Russian Union of Rectors expressing support for the invasion was published. In some universities, students were compelled to organize rallies in support of the war.\n\nOn December 20, 2022, the agreement between the Russian government and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine for the mutual recognition of educational diplomas and academic titles was terminated.\n\nAdditionally, on April 11, 2022, the Bologna Group announced its decision to cease the representation of Russia and Belarus in all structures of the Bologna Process. This followed Russia’s announcement of its withdrawal from the Bologna education system and represents a broader severing of ties between the West and Russia in the fields of science and education.\n\nThe structural constraints on governance in Russia are relatively low, and key indicators have shown a relatively high level of socioeconomic development in recent years. However, the ongoing war against Ukraine may jeopardize this development.\n\nRussia’s vast landmass, diverse physical geography and challenging climatic conditions do present infrastructure challenges, primarily due to the extensive permafrost covering over one-third of the country’s territory. The majority of the population is concentrated in the more hospitable western and southern regions, leaving large areas with sparse populations. Russia has yet to establish high-speed transcontinental rail connections and a modern highway system.\n\nAnother governance challenge is the competition between urban and peripheral Russia. Twelve cities with populations of one million or more, along with two others in proximity, are home to over 21% of the country’s population. These cities are undergoing post-industrial transformations that are altering employment structures, with an increasing share of skilled white-collar workers and employment in small businesses. Large cities also host the majority of internet users and the Russian middle class.\n\nThe quality of governance in Russia is a limiting factor in national competitiveness, which is increasingly vital in a globalized world. The combination of over-centralization and suboptimal national governance leads to an unequal distribution of regional economic competitiveness, providing significant advantages to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and the oil and gas-producing areas.\n\nFurthermore, Russia’s educated workforce is shrinking by approximately 0.7 to 0.8 million people annually due to demographic shifts. Health standards are declining, alcoholism rates remain high, and the population is aging, creating serious demographic challenges. Russia’s population has decreased from 147 million in 2000 to an estimated 145.8 million, partly attributed to the excess death rate during the COVID-19 pandemic, which claimed nearly 400,000 lives, according to the official website of the Pandemic Operations Headquarters.\n\nConflict intensity in Russia is relatively low, despite the ongoing war against Ukraine. Although there are significant political, social, ethnic or religious differences within the country, political actors have limited opportunities to exploit these divisions for polarization. Incidents of violence within Russia itself are rare. However, in the annexed regions of Ukraine, conflict intensity is very high.\n\nThere is no visible fragmentation among Russian elite groups, as they are largely united around Vladimir Putin. Even the Chechen Republic, which was highly unstable in the 1990s, has become one of the most loyal regions to Putin’s regime. The governor of Chechnya has even called for the revival of Stalinist terms like “enemies of the people” and “national traitors” to describe those who criticize the war against Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s most prominent opposition activist, Aleksey Navalny, was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2021, leading to protests in support of him, with more than 10,000 people detained. Interestingly, there is a highly unequal distribution of urban protest activity across the country, with significant variation in the number of protesters among regional capitals.\n\nAfter the war against Ukraine began, protests continued for several months and included various forms such as solitary pickets, mass marches and other forms of protest. These protests lasted until around June. In September 2022, when mobilization was announced, protests erupted in over 30 Russian cities, resulting in approximately 800 people being detained each time. The total number of detentions during actions against the war and mobilization reached 19,478.\n\nTwo waves of mass migration occurred at the outset of the war in February and during mobilization in September 2022, totaling around 800,000 people. This migration can also be seen as a form of protest or a means to alleviate pressure, which may explain why borders have remained open despite the economic cost.\n\nIn 2021/2022, several organizations advocating for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in Russia were labeled as “foreign agents.” Media outlets and internet resources were periodically blocked and fined for “LGBTQ+ propaganda.” There have been documented cases of unlawful detentions, abductions, arrests, torture, and murders of LGBTQ+ individuals in the North Caucasus, often involving security forces.\n\nAccording to a September 2021 Levada Center poll, 87% of respondents claimed not to know any LGBTQ+ individuals personally, 38% viewed them with “disgust or fear,” and 42% believed they should not have the same rights as other social groups.\n\nDuring 2021/2022, no major religious conflicts were reported in Russia.\n\nThe government’s approach to setting strategic priorities lacks consistency, often giving way to short-term political bargaining and rent-seeking interests. Policy measures are rarely organized and prioritized effectively. Russia’s priorities are not significantly influenced or constrained by external actors such as parliament, political parties, unions, civil society, oligarchs, regional elites or foreign actors.\n\nIn contrast to the turbulent 1990s, subsequent presidents, including Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, have attempted to articulate more precise and comprehensive long-term priorities. However, the implementation of these long-term goals has been sporadic and often at odds with the broader objectives of establishing democracy, pluralism, the rule of law and a market economy anchored in principles of social justice.\n\nTo bolster the government’s strategic capacity, the Center for Strategic Research was established as a think tank tasked with developing long-term growth strategies for the country. Additionally, Russia enacted a law on regulatory impact assessment, requiring an analysis of the economic, social and environmental effects of new regulations. Strategic planning units were also established in various ministries and agencies to formulate long-term plans and strategies in their respective areas and oversee their implementation. These initiatives aimed to improve policymaking and implementation in Russia.\n\nHowever, it remains evident that the preservation of President Putin’s power remains the primary and highest priority for Russia’s executive branch. While the government may set and maintain other strategic priorities, its political will and capacity to implement policy measures are limited. Strategic initiatives in areas like health care, welfare provision, education and corruption control, which require support from state administration across regions, have not been successfully executed. This failure has been publicly acknowledged by the president on numerous occasions.\n\nSince the Ukraine crisis of 2014, the balance of power has shifted toward the “siloviki,” who advocate for a more assertive Russia in international affairs and have limited faith in cooperation with the European Union and the United States. Since the beginning of the war against Ukraine, strategic decisions have primarily been made by the “siloviki,” and their focus is primarily on one goal – defeating Ukraine.\n\nThe government demonstrates little willingness and ability to engage in policy learning, maintaining rigid enforcement of policies and lacking the flexibility to adopt innovative approaches. The decision to initiate a war against an independent neighboring state appears to be a self-harming and potentially self-defeating policy choice.\n\nEvaluating the innovativeness and adaptability of the Russian government requires taking into account the country’s size and regional disparities. The central government bureaucracy is generally of higher quality than its regional counterparts. Corruption and over-centralization stand out as the primary impediments to learning and the dissemination of best practices across the nation. Moreover, there is little incentive for politicians and bureaucrats to embrace best practices, as they often lack accountability.\n\nFollowing the annexation of Crimea in 2014, international cooperation, consultancy and expertise in Russia dwindled, contributing less to the learning process. The war against Ukraine in 2022 brought such interactions to a complete halt.\n\nPrior to 2022, there were opportunities for international partners and expert groups to evaluate, monitor and share good practices in Russia. For instance, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has been collaborating with Russia since the early 1990s to support economic and social reforms. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) also worked with the Russian government on various issues, including governance, social inclusion and sustainable development. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) regularly conducted reviews of Russia’s economic policies, offering recommendations for improvements.\n\nWhat remains are annual international conferences and forums, such as those in St. Petersburg and Vladivostok, where experts from around the world convene to exchange best practices and experiences. However, since 2022, these gatherings have seen limited participation from representatives of the so-called “unfriendly countries.”\n\nThe government often fails to coordinate between conflicting objectives. Different parts of the government tend to compete among each other, and some policies have counter-productive effects on other policies.\n\nDue to the increasingly central role of the president and his inner circle in Russia’s political system, policy coordination is predominantly hierarchical and at the discretion of the president and his apparatus. At the same time, the “system” only works with personal connections. Therefore, the president makes use of presidential commissions that are composed of government ministers, advisers and presidential appointees, rarely involving elected deputies from the federal or regional level.\n\nMeaningful “responsible” decentralization, which would establish local self-government with legal and financial autonomy, supported by mechanisms for public oversight of local administration activities, remains limited.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lack of trust between different elite groups, making coordination among them too politically risky, as it could jeopardize their own survival. This is also generally true for the regional tier of government.\n\nThe decision to engage in the war against Ukraine appears to align with the interests of the “siloviki” but contradicts the interests of moderate economists within the government. These conflicting interests are counter-productive and have the potential to harm both the economic and political well-being of the country.\n\nDespite Russia having a comprehensive legal framework, the enforcement of anti-corruption measures is inconsistent, and there have been numerous reports of government corruption during 2021/2022.\n\nThe government has failed to take adequate steps to identify, investigate, prosecute or punish most officials involved in corruption, leading to a prevailing sense of impunity. Systemic root causes of corruption have not been addressed, and politicians often lack accountability to voters. Courts, especially when politics are involved, are frequently perceived as corrupt. Civil society is too weak and passive to exert meaningful influence, while media outlets and NGOs are either discouraged by legal restrictions or compelled by force to refrain from addressing alleged corruption cases and matters of public integrity.\n\nAuditors possess relative competence but lack the authority to enforce their findings. Financial disclosure laws that apply to government officials are inconsistently enforced, if at all, and violations are seldom addressed. In some cases, these laws have been officially suspended during the course of the war against Ukraine.\n\nFor instance, on December 29, 2022, President Putin issued a decree exempting individuals involved in war efforts from the obligation to disclose information about their incomes and expenses. In March 2023, Russia declared Transparency International an ‘undesirable’ organization, effectively prohibiting its operations within the country. The Russian prosecutor’s office alleged that, while ostensibly functioning as an anti-corruption organization globally, it interfered in Russia’s internal affairs and posed a threat to the nation’s constitutional order and security.\n\nWhile public procurement processes remain susceptible to manipulation, the introduction of mandatory tenders has contributed to enhancing the regulation and transparency of these procedures.\n\nOnly a few major political actors in Russia are committed to establishing democracy, characterized by the rule of law, free and fair elections, and freedom of information. However, their already limited influence on political affairs has been further diminished by the war against Ukraine.\n\nDespite the continued inclusion of democratic ideals in official rhetoric, the primary consensus among Russia’s major political players has revolved around the concept of stability, which is understood as the preservation of the existing authoritarian control model. Accordingly, democracy is perceived as a long-term objective to be achieved gradually through evolution rather than revolution.\n\nThe official argument posits that only the current elite possesses the capability to guide the country through challenging times, ensuring stability, security and prosperity. Opposition groups advocating for democracy, such as the political parties Yabloko and PARNAS, have been marginalized and consistently restricted from participating in public discourse. They are not permitted to have deputies in the national parliament.\n\nEven during the pandemic in 2020, there was no noticeable increase in divisions among different groups, and this trend has persisted since the onset of the war. On November 17, 2022, Putin approved the new composition of the Presidential Council for Civil Society Development and Human Rights. Most of the prominent members either resigned or were not reappointed.\n\nWhile Russia’s key political actors do not formally challenge the fundamental principles of a market economy, these principles are often disregarded in practice. There exists an elite consensus that favors a controlled market economy, ostensibly to ensure both economic and political stability. The fear is that granting too much economic freedom could potentially lead to political opposition. Consequently, market regulations are sometimes bent to favor state enterprises.\n\nGiven the significance of the economy as a pillar of global power, reformers within state institutions and the government wielded some influence over anti-democratic factions, at least until the outbreak of the war. The conflict highlighted the inherent contradiction between maintaining an open economy and engaging in a military conflict. While some prominent figures in economic management, and even more so the core representatives of the regime, are pro-market, their stance is not necessarily aligned with pro-democracy views. In fact, the opposite is the case, as the Russian ruling elite no longer pretends to follow the West or cherish its declared values.\n\nThroughout Russia’s history as a sovereign state, addressing past injustices has never been a priority for the political class. Public discussions about Soviet human rights abuses were hindered by government policies that sought to emphasize Soviet achievements, particularly the victory in World War II.\n\nThe Soviet triumph over Germany remained a central aspect of Russian identity, and its significance continued to grow. However, prior to the war, there were publications that examined the Soviet Union’s history of repression, including the purges and the Gulag system. In 2017, President Putin personally inaugurated a monument in Moscow commemorating the victims of Stalin’s mass repressions.\n\nOfficial and public discussions about the Soviet and Stalinist past were marked by ambivalence. This ambivalence came to an end in December 2021 with the closure of the Russian branch of Memorial, a historical and educational society that had been studying Soviet repression since 1987, as well as the closure of the human rights center bearing the same name, both ordered by the court.\n\nThe war against Ukraine resulted in changes to the school literature program. In 2023, works by Soviet authors that promote patriotism were reintroduced into the curriculum. In addition, works that are deemed to have not withstood the test of time or to not align with the current reality, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s “Gulag Archipelago,” will be excluded from the school curriculum.\n\nThe political leadership in Russia tends to view international assistance as an opportunity for rent-seeking or as a short-term strategy rather than as a long-term development strategy. Since Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency in 2000, there has been a noticeable shift toward Russia positioning itself as a role model and suggesting that it does not require international assistance.\n\nStarting around 2007, and with a brief interruption during Dmitry Medvedev’s presidency from 2008 to 2012, Russian authorities increasingly interpreted international assistance as unwanted interference in Russian affairs. In fact, Russia began interfering in the domestic politics of other countries by supporting Russia-friendly actors in those regions.\n\nRussia started drawing a distinction between maintaining economic cooperation with the West and preventing Western influence on its political processes, as well as in the post-Soviet region. The notion of needing assistance was largely discarded, and the modernization partnership with the EU, initiated during Medvedev’s presidency, was abandoned. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 marked a turning point in Russia’s relationship with the West, leading to a deterioration of ties. Russia began to perceive the West as a foe whose only aim was to interfere in Russia’s domestic affairs and weaken the country, supposedly a long-standing Western objective.\n\nThe risk of isolation in the international arena drove Russia to seek closer relations with China and other Southeast Asian countries. In 2014, Russia announced a “pivot to the East.” Moscow viewed its partnership with China as strategic, primarily as a means of balancing Western influence. However, this relationship with Beijing was not without risks, especially considering the growing economic disparity in China’s favor.\n\nNevertheless, Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine significantly altered its relationship with the West. Dissociation and divestment from Western partners became more prominent, and this process is ongoing. In this context, it became even more crucial for Russia to strengthen cooperation with what has been referred to as the “global majority,” including countries like Brazil, India, Iran and especially China. While Chinese authorities speak of cooperation and even friendship with Russia in rhetoric, their approach in practice is cautious. Nonetheless, China is poised to become Russia’s top trade partner, with trade exceeding $136 billion as of November 2022.\n\nThe war against Ukraine has arguably caused the most significant erosion of international trust in Russia and its policies. Post-colonial in character and in massive violation of international law, the war has triggered a series of strong international responses. Over 50 countries have imposed massive economic sanctions against Russia, and the United Nations General Assembly passed multiple resolutions condemning Russia’s actions with overwhelming support. On March 16, 2022, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe made the unprecedented decision to expel Russia from the organization. These developments indicate that Russia’s decision to wage war against Ukraine has severely diminished its global influence, both economically and politically.\n\nPrior to the war, Russia’s ambitions to assert itself as a “great power” had already damaged its credibility in the international arena. Russia regarded the post-Soviet region as its exclusive sphere of interest and responded assertively to conflicts it deemed threats to its security. Additionally, Russia’s leadership was unapologetically dishonest, even when caught in the act.\n\nRussia’s leadership viewed all aspects of domestic policy, including human rights, as matters exclusively under its jurisdiction, shielded from foreign involvement. This approach resulted in low compliance with international standards. The 2020 constitutional reform solidified this practice by establishing the primacy of national constitutional norms over international law as a constitutional norm.\n\nRussia also engaged in problematic activities by supporting right-wing populist movements in Western countries. It leveraged its permanent seat at the U.N. Security Council and its close relationships with states facing international pressure, such as Iran and Syria, to obstruct international conflict resolution efforts.\n\nFurthermore, the war against Ukraine undermined Russia’s already modest commitments to climate protection. Prior to the conflict, Russia had made significant climate pledges, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 70% of their 1990 level by 2030 and further reducing emissions to 20% of the 1990 level by 2050 through a government decree. Currently, there has been little to no progress toward achieving these policy goals. Moreover, in March 2022, Russia’s Ministry of Energy stated that Western sanctions related to Ukraine would hinder the country’s ability to meet its emissions reduction targets by 2050.\n\nThe annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the military aggression against Ukraine in 2022 have severely damaged Russia’s reputation as a reliable and trustworthy regional partner.\n\nBefore 2014, Moscow pursued a strategy of “soft dominance” toward neighboring post-Soviet countries. Russia generally respected the national sovereignty of these nations, providing political incumbents with a mix of incentives and pressures without overtly encroaching on their integrity and sovereignty. During this time, there were no legal changes to post-Soviet borders. However, smaller post-Soviet countries had limited confidence in Russia and actively sought relations with other major powers. The prevailing belief was that Russia would not cross the threshold of violating interstate borders. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 shattered this belief.\n\nThe annexation of Crimea heightened the fears of smaller post-Soviet states regarding Moscow. It demonstrated that post-Soviet borders were not fixed and that Russia could use military force to annex neighboring regions at any time. Post-Soviet nations had to adjust their calculations, as Russia’s actions indicated that it did not feel constrained by international rules and prior commitments in pursuing its foreign policy goals.\n\nDuring the period in question, especially in 2022, the Kremlin’s primary objective in promoting regional cooperation was to demonstrate that Russia was not isolated on the international stage. Russia intensified efforts to organize summit meetings with neighboring states, particularly Belarus, and participated in multilateral forums. In September 2022, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit was held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. In October 2022, Astana, Kazakhstan, hosted the “Central Asia-Russia” summit. In December 2022, the summit of the Eurasian Economic Union took place in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan and an informal summit of CIS leaders was held in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Moscow initiated these summits, with personal attendance by President Putin.\n\nRussia’s break with the West due to its war in Ukraine accelerated its pivot toward China and, to some extent, India. 20 days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping signed a declaration proclaiming a “no limits” Sino-Russian strategic partnership. However, Russia’s position as China’s junior partner could complicate its efforts to maintain a partnership with India, given India’s complex relationship with China. As Russia envisions aligning with a “global majority,” it seeks to shift its previous East-West foreign policy axis toward a North-South gradient. Russia is actively courting Asian, African and Latin American states, though it faces limitations in terms of resources and capabilities for this endeavor.\n\nDuring the period under review, Russia’s political system continued its long-standing trend of degenerating from electoral authoritarianism into an autocratic regime characterized by President Putin’s personal rule. Putin’s overwhelming victories in the 2012 and 2018 presidential elections were followed by numerous legislative changes that increased state control and further restricted freedoms of assembly and the press. In the summer of 2020, constitutional amendments, approved through a popular vote, allowed Putin to extend his presidency beyond 2024. Following Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine in 2022, a series of federal laws were swiftly enacted, severely curtailing freedom of speech, association and assembly.\n\nRussia’s aggression against Ukraine in 2022 has brought significant changes to its domestic development and international standing. Domestically, Putin’s policies have garnered support from key actors within the Russian political system, including both houses of parliament, political parties, regional governors and the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church. The majority of the population has continued to express confidence in Putin and his policies. A comprehensive propaganda machine has been utilized to shape public perception, targeting not only adults but also young people in schools and children in kindergartens.\n\nWhile there have been anti-war protests, the government’s policies and actions generally enjoy broad public support. The decision to keep borders open led to a mass exodus of dissenters who had previously been part of the protest movement within the country. Domestically, the Russian leadership framed the war in Ukraine as a “holy war” against those perceived as an existential threat to Russia – the “collective West.”\n\nDespite the rising costs of the war, it is unlikely that the Russian economy will collapse, and there are no signs of an imminent regime change resulting from elite divisions or a Moscow coup d’état. However, if the Russian state fails to meet its social obligations to the population, increasing military losses and war expenses could fuel social discontent in the country’s regions. In response, the Russian state is likely to rely even more on repression.\n\nIn 2023, Vladimir Putin faces a significant decision regarding his political future. He must choose whether to run for re-election in 2024 or designate a successor. His intentions remain uncertain. Removing Putin from power would probably lead to a less aggressive foreign policy until a new leader consolidates domestic control and stabilizes the economy. However, it is more likely that Putin will secure “re-election” in 2024 and remain in power for at least another decade without initiating significant reforms or changes in foreign policy, including relations with neighboring countries and the EU.\n\nRussia’s political relations with Western countries have not only been severely damaged but have effectively come to a complete halt. This also holds true for cultural, scientific and economic cooperation, which has dwindled. While the Russian leadership may strengthen ties with China, numerous factors limit the extent of cooperation beyond joint efforts to counterbalance the United States.\n\nRussia is likely to seek stronger relations with neighboring authoritarian regimes, such as Belarus and certain Central Asian countries, while deepening ties with Türkiye and Iran. Post-Soviet cooperation is expected to continue without major breakthroughs due to a lack of trust in Russia. Additionally, Russia may continue efforts to undermine the unity of the European Union and NATO through manipulation and political subversion tactics. However, economic sanctions and other diplomatic measures are unlikely to end the war soon but will significantly constrain Moscow’s ability to sustain large-scale aggression."
