And in the constitutions the borders are spelled out within the confines of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions — at the time when they were part of Ukraine,” Putin said.\n\nAt the same time, Putin underscored that territorial disputes between the D/LNR and Ukraine should be resolved through negotiations.\n\nIn addition, Putin said that just because the Federation Council gave permission for the deployment of Russian troops to the Donbas this doesn’t mean that they will be sent there now.\n\nread more\n\nTerritorial claims Putin has recognized the breakaway ‘republics’ in eastern Ukraine. But what does Moscow consider their ‘borders’?\n\nread more\n\nTerritorial claims Putin has recognized the breakaway ‘republics’ in eastern Ukraine. But what does Moscow consider their ‘borders’?\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a break in diplomatic ties between Russia and Ukraine would only create additional problems. Relations with Ukraine “need to be improved at some point,” Peskov told reporters.\n\nEarlier today, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he is considering breaking off diplomatic relations with Russia.\n\nThe LNR’s de facto leader Leonid Pasechnik estimates that rebuilding the “republics” will cost 1.5 trillion rubles (that’s almost $19 billion).\n\nNotably, the cooperation treaties Russia signed with the DNR and LNR state that Moscow will take steps to maintain the breakaway regions’ financial and banking systems, based on the fact that they use the Russian ruble.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that the UK will impose sanctions on five Russian banks and three individuals close to Vladimir Putin — Gennady Timchenko and brothers Boris and Igor Rotenberg.\n\n“This is the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do,” Johnson told parliament on Tuesday.\n\nThese three “high-net worth individuals” will banned from travelling to the UK and any assets they hold there will be frozen. The sanctioned banks are Promsvyazbank, Rossiya Bank, Industrial Savings Bank, General Bank, and Black Sea Bank.\n\nDuring speeches made by members of Russia’s Federation Council, multiple senators described purported horrors perpetrated by the Ukrainian government against the residents of the breakaway “republics.” For example, Defense and Security Committee chairman Viktor Bondarev said, “Citizens of the republics are tired of the constant bombings in which women and children are killed.”\n\nLater, Senator Andrey Klishas argued that the two breakaway statelets were formed in accordance with international law following the illegal coup that unseated Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.\n\nDeputy Chairman Konstantin Kosachev then took the podium and railed against the “radical nationalists who gunned down people at Maidan Square and burned them up in Odessa” (referring to the Trade Unions House fire in May 2014).\n\nCiting Russia’s recognition of eastern Ukraine’s two breakaway “republics,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has ordered the withdrawal of a key document needed for the certification of Nord Stream 2, killing Germany’s support for a key and nearly complete gas pipeline that Russia hoped to use as an alternate route for its energy products to the European market.\n\nIn a briefing with journalists on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov fielded questions about where Moscow recognizes the borders of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic. Peskov said Russia accepts the two breakaway groups as they see their own borders, but he declined to comment specifically about cities that the separatists claim as their own that currently remain under the Ukrainian government’s control:\n\nCNN: Regarding the recognition of the sovereignty of the DNR and LNR, tell me, are we talking about recognizing them in their current, de facto borders or within the borders of the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions? As we understand it, these are a bit different.\n\nDmitry Peskov: Within the borders that they have proclaimed themselves.\n\nCNN: Proclaimed at what point?\n\nDmitry Peskov: Well, when these two republics were proclaimed.\n\nBloomberg: Can you elaborate on this issue?\n\nDmitry Peskov: No, I have nothing to add.\n\nEkho Moskvy: Do these borders include Mariupol, for example?\n\nDmitry Peskov: I have nothing to add to this. Within the borders in which they exist and have been proclaimed.\n\nEkho Moskvy: In which they exist or were proclaimed?\n\nDmitry Peskov: Well, in which they were proclaimed and exist.\n\nEkho Moskvy: Meaning, within the current borders?\n\nDmitry Peskov: I have nothing to add to this.\n\nBBC News: Can you clarify? I don’t quite understand: Will the recognition of the people’s republics mean the borders that exist now or those that they’ve proclaimed themselves?\n\nDmitry Peskov: Within the borders in which these republics were proclaimed.\n\nBBC News: In 2014? Meaning, the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions?\n\nDmitry Peskov: In this case, I’ve said everything I can on this subject."
