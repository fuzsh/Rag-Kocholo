Not blindly believe the one written by a bunch of hypocrites of the MSM.\n\nThere would be all the links to how the EU continued buying gas from Russia, the US buying uranium and fertilizers and what not, well more than one month into Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nShe would read some really informative posts by unbiased BHPians about geopolitics, the atrocities carried out by Russia and the double standards of the west.\n\nAgreed completely.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by TROOPER\n\nAll I hope and pray the kid doesn't have to end up reading, is the current situation spiralling out of control and something even more unimaginable happening.\n\nNot with this one though. I am now convinced that Putin is not going to stop with Ukraine. Like others have mentioned he has been planning this for years. Don't see why he would stop with just Phase 1.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Foxbat\n\nBlackwater (Fancy name of US Mercenaries operating in Iraq, not even American soldiers) shot dead 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad in 2007. Not one was punished for this daylight murder.\n\nActually as far as I remember four of the contractors were actually prosecuted and convicted for the Nisour Square massacre. They were rotting in jail till Trump pardoned them (https://www.theguardian.com/world/20...iraq-civilians).\n\nYou might have missed that in case you were following propaganda from certain sources (after all Mr. Trump was their prodigal son).\n\nIt was definitely not enough but imagine the Russian government bringing charges against the Wagner group for the atrocities they have committed (like the U.S federal government actually did). Yeah, I am not holding my breath on that one.\n\nAlso, guys you don't have to spend even a minute of effort to convince me that Ukrainians are murdering Russians in cold blood. In fact, I don't even need to see a video, I will straight up believe you. Do I think this is wrong? Yep. But like I said in this thread before it's:\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by JithinR\n\n.. (not because of the Geneva convention...don't really think the Americans/Russians/Ukrainians actually care for that). But simply because this would cause long term animosity between people that share borders and culture.\n\nNothing like the amount of effort taken to convince some members here that Russians were murdering civilians (even satellite footage was barely enough and it was still met with what-about-itsm).\n\nMy point was simply to the fact that this thread reports Russians being murdered much more than Ukrainians. Almost to the point where one would feel that it was Ukraine who was the aggressor in this war (which I guess a lot of Indians feel like it is...I can see a lot of 'they deserved it' attitude amongst Indians on Social Media).\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2007\n\nLocation: San Jose USA, Panaji, Goa\n\nPosts: 91\n\nThanked: 352 Times\n\nRe: Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war\n\nIf true, then it must obviously be condemned. But it could also just be fake. The Russians are pros at creating fake news, just as they did to influence the 2016 US elections to help Trump. There are some videos of so called executions in which the alleged executions by the Ukranians have their flags on their uniforms upside down! It simply does not make sense for the Ukranians to be filming the executions and sending it out to the media.\n\nThe bottom line is that Russia started the war and has unified NATO like never before, with even historically neutral countries like Finland, Sweden and even Switzerland supporting Russia. Until recently, Germany was a Russian puppet, with a puny military budget, and with its ex-chancellor Schroeder even being on the board of Gazprom.\n\nHowever, the unification of NATO against Russia may not matter to Putin. He is a sharp guy. The US and the European allies are doing the bare minimum to support Ukraine. If Russia gains control on the east and the southern coasts of Ukraine, it will gain access to Europe's largest oil and gas reserves and the ports to export it. This will be worth trillions and more than make up for the military losses and loss of trade with the west. That is why Russia continues to pound these areas, even though they have a large number of ethnic Russians. It was never about the ethnic Russians or the fake non existing Ukrainian Nazis. It was always about Russia getting access to their natural resources. In WW2 the, the German invasion of the east was all about resources. Putin's war is more of the same. If Russia can consolidate these areas, it will be a victory of sorts for Russia.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Foxbat\n\nThese war crimes by Ukrainians are so wide spread that now even Main stream Western Media(NYTimes) is reporting it:\n\nAttachment 2293911\n\nSource: https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04...raine-executed\n\nIt seems they are completely insane to commit these crimes and then record and share it to the world. Amazing how these \"impartial\" and \"free\" news outlets use the words \"Appears to show\" even when the execution of prisoners is clearly shown on the videos. However for Russians they are guilty without any proof.\n\nThese are not even humans, a Ukrainian soldier says in the video as he walks among the wrecked vehicles, adding that two Russian lieutenants had been taken prisoner.\n\nThe Ukrainian soldiers are identifiable by their flag patches and blue arm bands and repeat glory to Ukraine multiple times.\n\nNo difference from the Nazis of WWII, even the badges worn by some of the Ukrainian military units are the same.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2010\n\nLocation: -\n\nPosts: 1,155\n\nThanked: 1,166 Times\n\nRe: Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war\n\nThis war will also have a bearing on USD dominance in international trade.

India abstains. The west will be pleased as abstentions will not be counted for the 2/3rd majority.\n\nNotice the stark contrast from the list of nations who voted for and against the resolution. Abstentions worked against Russia. Russia would have preferred India to vote against the resolution. China, surprisingly, voted against the resolution, in favor of Russia.\n\nSanctions won't resolve this conflict. Nor will violence or a nuclear deterrent. Only talks across the table can work. Russia and Ukraine need to sit with each other and work out a mutually workable solution. They are the ones who are bearing the brunt. US and China need to be kept out of this. Probably, India can mediate.\n\nThis conflict is insane. This has to be brought to a halt by the international community. So many lives are lost. Families destroyed. Unthinkable in the modern era and yet its happening right in front of us. Tomorrow it could be our country in this same horrendous predicament.\n\nThe west aka USA is stoking Ukraine's ego and China is doing the same with Russia. This is absolutely mind numbing. Millions of people are being uprooted and their lives destroyed. This sets a very scary template for years to follow as the repercussions will be deep rooted and far reaching.\n\nAgonizing\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2010\n\nLocation: India\n\nPosts: 478\n\nThanked: 1,041 Times\n\nRe: Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war\n\nJust wanted to share an interview of the leader on the Donbas side.\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world...war/ar-AAVX5dW\n\nExcerpts :\n\nIndia Today: What is the ground situation? How much of Ukrainian territory is under the control of the Donetsk People's Militia (the DPR)?\n\nEduard Basurin: Almost 65% of our territory (Donetsk Oblast) is controlled by us and 35% is under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The main control is in the south of the Republic (what they call Donetsk People's Republic, now recognised by Russia as an independent state), northern and southern parts are under the control of the Ukrainian fighters.\n\nEB: The main problem is not that they are better supplied. The problem is that the Ukrainian Army is not returning (withdrawing). The most equipped forces of Ukraine are here in the south of Donbas.There are about 1,00,000 soldiers, a full range of weaponry, but no aviation. The supply of weapons committed by Europe is for Ukrainian territories, such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa. Weapons are not sent to us.\n\nIT: There are accusations of war crimes by the Donetsk and Russian forces against civilians. What is your response?\n\nEB: War crimes started in 2014. Everyone has heard about it. I am not just talking of the summer of 2014 when whole cities were shelled by Ukraine. Nobody from Ukraine called that a war crime — not the UN, not human rights, not even other international organisations or foreign journalists.\n\nSuddenly in 2022, war crimes against civilians are making headlines.\n\nEB: Our objectives are set — to liberate the territories of Donetsk and to save as many lives as possible. People in Donetsk Oblast region are our people. We are fighting for them.\n\nApart from the military objectives, there is the psychological strategy. Mariupol is proof that shows the Ukrainian forces as well as the Nato that no matter how they train the [Ukrainian] soldiers, we will beat them. That is why the rest of the Ukrainian formations should be encircled from the north where the Russian Federation will help and from the south together by Russian forces and Donetsk People's Militia.\n\nWe can then dictate the rules. The most important priority is to save lives. Mariupol demonstrates what happens to you when you resist. You have no support from Ukraine. You (Ukrainians) will all be killed here.\n\nLast edited by vishnurp99 : 8th April 2022 at 10:03.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2007\n\nLocation: San Jose USA, Panaji, Goa\n\nPosts: 91\n\nThanked: 352 Times\n\nRe: Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war\n\nThe dollar dominance is not going to end anytime soon. If some have distrust of the Dollar (or its partner currencies like the Euro, Yen or Pound), they have even less trust of the Yuan or the Ruble. Would Russia accept Yuan from India, or would China accept Rupees from Russia, or Riyals from India? No. For all the problems with the US and the dollar, there are even more issues with the other said currencies as those countries have even more weaknesses. All of them have pseudo dictatorships, whose leaders are not bound by any laws and can change them on the whim without any debate. Some like Saudi and Russia have backward commodity based economies, the tide of which can change any time (they are having good times now... but wait for the next recession). India has a 4 billion dollar deficit with Russia and around a $70B with China. Will those countries hold that surplus in Rupees? Nope.\n\nFinally, the biggest trading blocks are China, Europe, USA and Japan. None of them will trade in Yuan and Rubles between then. China has around 15% share of world trade, but yet, only 1% of it is in Yuan. The trade between Russia and China is insignificant. Russia has a small economy that is the size of Italy. The Russian/Chinese apologists here may make a lot of noise about it, but it really is a non-event. Countries have been talking about replacing the dollar for decades. It is not happening anytime soon.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by download2live\n\nThis war will also have a bearing on USD dominance in international trade.

Moscow is offering rupee-ruble payments to Indian oil buyers, while Saudi Arabia is in talks with Beijing to price some of its crude in yuan.\"\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2021\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 30\n\nThanked: 84 Times\n\nRe: Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Aloneatma\n\nRussia evicted from the UNHRC.

Nor will violence or a nuclear deterrent. Only talks across the table can work. Russia and Ukraine need to sit with each other and work out a mutually workable solution. They are the ones who are bearing the brunt. US and China need to be kept out of this. Probably, India can mediate.\n\nAgonizing\n\nThe outcome of the invasion is more or less now settled there are no winners in this particular scenario, both Russia and Ukraine are now tired. Russia didn't expect a fierce resistance and Ukraine overestimated the support from Nato and EU.\n\nZelensky should now try to push for a settlement with Russia, Ukranians are pushing for a better outcome than what was agreed in the earlier negotiations, Putin is probably looking for a decent exit route with minimal damage to his reputation. On the other hand US seem to be eager to keep the conflict long enough to inflict irreparable damage to Russia they are least bothered about Ukranians, sooner Zelensky accepts this better for all parties involved.\n\nUS has never been anybody's friend I hope this conflict inflicts some damage on the US hegemony and result in a multipolar world for the sake of everyone\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2011\n\nLocation: 3rdRockFmTheSun\n\nPosts: 1,224\n\nThanked: 2,820 Times\n\nRe: Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by AltoLXI\n\nTreatment of refugees. Some are more equal than others...\n\nContrary to popular and righteous belief, I actually find differentiation in refugees quite understandable.\n\nOn one side of the balancing scale is the humanitarian side, on the other the practical side. The practical side would include how the decision would influence citizens of that country in the short and long run. We can see issues with lack of mixing of populations and how long term demographic change affects things. More polarisation and right wing politics tends to come up. France and Le Penn can be seen as examples. Poland and Hungary too, based on their decisions to avoid such in the past.\n\nWhile I do appreciate humanitarian gestures, I would not judge a country solely on that.\n\nLast edited by Poitive : 9th April 2022 at 00:31.
