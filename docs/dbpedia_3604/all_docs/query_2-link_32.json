Technical Officer Grade 2‚Ä¶\n\nDECOLONISING YOUR OWN EDUCATION: How many have read this book? A mere 745 pages in translation of a Mughal emperors diary. Not the easiest of reads. Certainly needed stamina to plough through the language. But a good time to read about governance of the sub-continent by one of us. Jahangir known today mostly for his tomb in Lahore, his wife Noor Jahan and son Shah Jahan. Often we are caught in the glamour of woke titles of governance from a western-centric lens with flashy book jackets. But, given the collapse of capitalism, democracy, the first world order and what one might have thought was reasonable rhetoric a few decades ago, this is an opportunity to learn about us, written by us, our ancestors. A hidden authentic , culturally, geographically and climatically appropriate history of power & governance. The best time to start consciously decolonise one‚Äôs thought process, not looking west for answers but creating imaginative solutions to regional problems by going back to our own regional roots.\n\nüìåToday's Public Lecture: \"Turbulent Time: Public Value Accountability, Ethical Standard, and Activation of Educators‚Äô Human Resources for Sustainable Learning Process in the World and Africa. üìÜDay: 30/01/2024 üìçWhere: Belgium ‚è∞Time: 08:00 -09_00 AM (Berlin Time) üü©Rationale: Even though teachers are important resources, especially for children who are the first generation receiving education in their families and heavily rely on teachers to acquire basic literacy, critical, and transferable skills. A rapid increase in enrollments has caused a shortage of trained teachers. The shortage of experienced teachers may result in low-qualified teachers, lack of public value accountability and integrity, unethical behaviour, and corruption that requires policy adjustments. üü©The context, content, and learning outcome of this public lecture improved the education stakeholders/policymakers/Civil Society, etc. actors and institutions' representative education policy decision-making process, design, implementation, governance, administration, management, and professional development for Teachers in connection with on/offline and hybrid classes in the real world and African education and learning agenda settings for our common good. ‚ö†Ô∏èSlide 1 indicates my End and Take away message ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† For your individual and institutional/university participation in my (on/ofline and Hybrid) research training, mentoring guidance, and (external) supervision possibilities.

This is really important as there are many areas where instruction, guidance, and governance is needed across a sector where there are many areas needing improvement and evidence to apply in a critical and thoughtful manner. For all these calls I've seen they require applicants to be employed (full time) in a university. This is missing those who are part time; consultants and coaches; independent scholars; or who undertake academic practices (e.g. research) in non-university settings. This feels limiting to me, it misses so many core skills that practitioner researchers, indie academics, or consultants have. It seems wrong that someone with a moderate amount of skills from a university can apply, while a highly experienced person who works across multiple universities, or even is advising universities on how to improve their practices would not be eligible. How might we change this frustrating and limiting approach?\n\nReading comprehension is a skill and not one that everyone possesses in equal measure. Literacy rates are topping out near 100 per cent in many parts of the world. But this apparent progress masks a hidden problem. Like many things, literacy is a spectrum. Experts have identified six literacy levels, which they‚Äôve labelled 0 to 5. Level 3 is considered the minimum competency needed for everyday functioning. So we‚Äôd expect most people to have a literacy level of 3 or higher, right? Wrong. According to the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies, 52 per cent of adults in the United States have a literacy level of 0, 1 or 2. They might struggle to follow recipes and other instructions; apply for jobs or unemployment benefit; write emails; pass the written portion of a driving test; understand medical charts, lease agreements and household bills, let alone vote; post on social media; decipher think pieces and academic articles; read the latest Booker Prize winner; or make sense of this sentence. What‚Äôs going on? The reasons are too complex to properly disambiguate here, but suffice it to say that having a low literacy level does not mean someone is stupid or lazy. Everything from neurological makeup to quality of schooling to socioeconomic status and socialisation to nonnative status can impede acquisition and retention of these skills. Moreover, learning how to read is not like learning to ride a bike. It‚Äôs more comparable to complex maths. Without practice, one‚Äôs literacy level will decline over time.
