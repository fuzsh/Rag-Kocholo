        "text": "The period extended between the end of the fourth millennium BC, i.e. Chalcolithic Age, and the beginning of the third millennium BC, i.e. Early Bronze Age, was characterized by the existence of a transition phase that did not exceed five hundred years. That period called Ninevite 5 and it lasted from 3000 to 2500 BC. Radical changes had happened during that period before the shifting to build the big cities and the establishment of the Akkadian Empire around 2500 BC. After the settlement expansion across the last stage of the fourth millennium that named LC 5 \"Late Chalcolithic 5\" territories that extended from the south of Iraq to the north of the Syrian Jazireh, we notice that, at the end of the fourth millennium and the beginning of the third one, a recess had occurred to that expansion and the number of inhabited sites, which were dwelled in high population density, had drastically decreased to only reach 30%. Except of some small rural sites in north of Iraq and Khabour Basin in the northeast of Syrian Jazireh, this period was marked _ although it lasted for a short time _ by several features, at top of it all, is its unique and distinguished pottery that it had not been found anywhere before Ninevite 5 and which characterized by its shape, color and decoration. Distinctive pottery is not the only feature that characterized this period but also work specialization in Khabour Basin sites where the Upper Khabour Basin specialized in rain-fed agriculture to grow grains and then transfer them to the Middle Khabour Basin where they used to be cleaned processed and stored in specific facilities. These stored grains used to be either shipped to other sites along the Khabour river, like Mari, or be consumed locally by residents of the sites in Khabour Basin or served as fodder for animals.\n\nThis paper presents major trends in pottery development in the final Ninevite 5 period, which corresponds to the final EJZ 2 period in the Syrian Jezirah. This discussion is based primarily on a pottery assemblage from Tell Arbid, a site in northeast Syria. The pottery was recovered from a dwelling quarter (Area D), where both final Ninevite 5 (final EJZ 2) and post-Ninevite 5 (EZJ 3) occupation were recognized. Excavations at Tell Arbid have provided new data regarding the late Ninevite 5 pottery repertoire and its internal development. Morphological types of vessels and their technology are discussed at length. Major traits of the final Ninevite 5 pottery are recognized and defined, including pottery \" index fossils \" as well as some less distinct pottery types. Chronological variability of pottery types has also been traced, special attention being given to continuity and changes in pottery production between final Ninevite 5 and post-Ninevite 5 (EJZ 3) periods. A trend toward standardization visible in the final Ninevite 5 pottery development is related to political and economic factors in the Syrian Jezirah at this time.\n\nThis article presents a preliminary study of the pottery collected during the 2012 and 2013 campaigns of the Land of Nineveh Archaeological Project (University of Udine, Italy) in Iraqi Kurdistan. The report examines the morphology, distribution and relative implications of a wide spectrum of ceramic types, whose chronological range spans from the Early Pottery Neolithic to the Sasanian period. In particular, it focuses on the local aspects of the material culture - as well as on regional and trans-regional connections - and thus aims at placing the pottery assemblages in the broader perspective of Upper Mesopotamia's diverse ceramic traditions. Despite its preliminary nature, this report embodies a substantial overview of the ceramics surveyed, which will serve as a departure point for future inquiries and more detailed analyses of the ceramic traditions of the Upper Tigris region between the 7th mill. BC and the 7th century AD.\n\nThe end of the third millennium BC in Southern Mesopotamia is characterized by a series of political events that, apparently, determined marked changes in the social structure of the area. Archaeologically, this period is still poorly represented, and a general reassessment of the available data is necessary. In the present paper, the pottery repertoire is taken as a case study for the identification of chronological markers of this period. The analysis of key pottery sequences allowed the identification of a homogenous ceramic horizon that characterized the timespan between the late Akkadian to the end of the Ur III periods. Two sub-phases are well distinguished by the presence/absence of types. The cross-dating between southern contexts and the well-know Syrian Jazirah helped in the better definition of the chronological limits of the two sub-phases and the general pottery phase as a whole. Nippur, Tell Asmar, Tell Brak and Tell Mozan have been used as key-sites.\n\nThe paper presents new information about the distribution of pottery dated to the first half of the third millennium BC, Ninevite 5 pottery in particular, in the Upper Khabur region. It is the result of a preliminary study of pottery deriving from Khabur Basin Project surveys performed by Yale University under the direction of Prof. Frank Hole in the 1980s and 1990s. The area under consideration encompasses the surroundings of the Jebel Abd al-Aziz mountains west of the Khabur river, and sites located in the north-eastern part of Upper Khabur region. The main goal of this presentation is to add data on Early Jezireh 0–3 periods settlement in areas located far from the Khabur river, as well as supplement the existing data on the settlement of the Khabur Basin."
