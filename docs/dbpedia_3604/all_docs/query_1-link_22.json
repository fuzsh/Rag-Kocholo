        "text": "Since Kazakhstan achieved independence, it has become necessary to reconsider the national history. Historians have been charged by the government with revising the history from ancient times up to independence. The problem is that the many modern history books overwhelm readers with bare statistics such as dates and numbers, without significantly increasing their level of substantive knowledge. In this respect history should not be limited to the presentation of dry facts concerning historical events, but should also inform the reader about the ethnos' world-view; it should be regarded as a course, diachronically observing and showing the development of ethnos mentality. The purpose of this qualitative study is to develop additional systematically selected information about mental peculiarities of Turkic people and show its historical development through analysing the functionality of place names in ancient Turkic period. The linguistic and general scientific methods (comparative, descriptive, component analysis, etymological analysis) we have applied gave us: 1) the comprehension of the ancient Turks' mentality, world-view through the prism of place names in which they put the important information; 2) the picture of historical events linked with the given place names. The sources (Orkhon-Yenisei written monuments, historic, linguistic, ethnographic, geographic works and scientific literature on toponyms) we used are completely related to the content of the given research. This research can be useful for the group of scholars developing new historian books and contribute to the further study on the ancient Turkic place names.\n\nA group of Turkic tribes populated the area between the Dnieper and Don Rivers from the beginning of the 5th mill. BC., have become the creators of the Corded Ware culture (CWC) which has been widespread in Europe from the Volga to the Rhine Rivers and from southern Scandinavia to the Carpathians. Most of them were assimilated among the various peoples of Europe, but those who inhabited Western Ukraine kept their language and ethnicity and in the first millennium BC re-settled in the wider area of Central and Eastern Europe. They became known in history as the Scythians, and their heirs became the ancient Bulgars, on the basis of which the modern Chuvash nation developed. Thus, the Chuvash language retained the main features of the Proto-Turkic language.\n\nThere is a notion, in popular beliefs as well as in academic works by histo- rians and anthropologists, that Turkic peoples had in their common past a developed religion with an established pantheon, along with cosmogonic and cosmological concepts. This article is an attempt to address this problem from an etymological point of view: what common concepts and themes can be reconstructed for the Proto-Turkic language, using the lexical data of Turkic languages and written monuments?"
