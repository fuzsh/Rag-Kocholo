        "text": ".\n\n● Gen 30:19-20a . .When Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son, Leah\n\nsaid: God has given me a choice gift; this time my husband will exalt me, for I have\n\nborne him six sons.\n\nSo far, Leah is the only woman in the house calling Jacob \"my husband\"; and from\n\none night to the other, she never really knew where he'd be-- with her, one of the\n\nmaids, or with Rachel. Jacob probably had a toothbrush and shaving gear in every\n\none of their bathrooms.\n\nWell . . Leah wanted her husband to live at home with her, not with one of the\n\nother women. Sleeping with the others was just a fact of life around there and she\n\nwas getting used to it. Leah could deal with that. But when he was done fooling\n\naround with the others, she wanted him to come home to her, not stay overnight\n\nwith one of them. Since God had blessed her with the most boys, and the most\n\nchildren, it only seemed right in Leah's mind that she had more claim on Jacob than\n\nanybody else and he really should be bonded to her more than the others.\n\n● Gen 30:20b . . So she named him Zebulun.\n\nZebulun's name basically means habitation. Synonyms for habitation are:\n\noccupancy, residence, domicile, and home. In other words, Zebulun is where a man\n\nhangs his hat.\n\n● Gen 30:21 . . Last, she bore him a daughter, and named her Dinah.\n\nDinah's name basically means judgment, justice. and/or fair play.\n\nYou can bet Dinah was an instant hit with the women. Now they had someone to\n\nmake dolls for, and cute little dresses, and tiny little knickers. And they could show\n\nher how to paint her fingernails, perm her hair, and put on make-up and eye\n\nshadow. I would guess that Dinah did more to help the women forget their\n\ndifferences and become friends than anything else around there.\n\nAnd Jacob no doubt liked her immensely. It is just about impossible for a normal\n\nman to resist the charms of a bouncy little cherub. I've seen the toughest blue\n\ncollar beasts you can imagine become mushy morons around little girls. When one\n\nof those teensy sweethearts puts her chubby little arms around a man's neck and\n\nsays \"Daddy, I love you\" it's all over but the burial. If sons were indeed prized in\n\nthose days, then the daughters were icing on the cake.\n\nNOTE: Dinah is the very first girl on record born to the people of Israel.\n\n● Gen 30:22a . . Now God remembered Rachel;\n\nDoes that mean the omniscient Almighty had somehow forgotten all about her?\n\n(chuckle) No. God's memory works just fine. I think the best way to treat this is\n\nsimply to say that God now turned His full attention to Rachel whereas before He\n\nwas totally devoted to Leah's concerns.\n\n● Gen 30:22b . . God heeded her and opened her womb.\n\nDoes the word \"heeded\" mean Rachel finally decided to pray for a baby? I think so.\n\nSome people are driven to drink by the problems of everyday life. God's people are\n\noften driven to their knees.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 30:23 . . She conceived and bore a son, and said: God has taken away my\n\nhumiliation.\n\nIt's one thing to adopt children, or take in foster kids, or become a step-parent. But\n\nnothing can take the place of having your very own. Rachel possessed two legal\n\nchildren by her maid Bilhah. But those were really and truly Bilhah's babies, not\n\nRachel's. Until she had her very own, Rachel remained low on the totem pole of\n\nfeminine esteem.\n\nMen just can't appreciate how important babies are to (normal) women. Even tough\n\nwomen don't really feel like real women until they have a child. I worked as a\n\nvacuum cleaner salesman many years ago when I was very young. The owner of\n\nthe business was married to a successful woman in her mid forties who had no\n\nchildren of her own; and actually, never wanted any.\n\nBut whenever she was in the presence of moms, they made her feel like a loser\n\nbecause in her mind, moms were the real women. In other words: she was a freak\n\nof nature born without a mother's heart; and that is a fatal flaw in any woman's\n\ncharacter: business or otherwise.\n\nThat woman's confession amazed me because hers was a strong, assertive, self\n\nconfident kind of personality with scratch-proof, dent-proof hide like depleted\n\nuranium armor plating. But every suit of armor has a chink in it somewhere and\n\nthat was hers.\n\n\"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord; the fruit of the womb is a reward. Like\n\narrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth.\" (Ps 127:3-4)\n\nArrows are not only weapons of war, but also tools of readiness, strength, and\n\ndefense. In Rachel's day, children were old age security. They still are for many\n\npeople in third world countries; and for those of us who face retirement on fixed\n\nincomes. When my wife and I finally wax old and feeble, we hope our son will care\n\nenough about us to make sure we don't die hungry and poverty-stricken.\n\n● Gen 30:24 . . So she named him Joseph, which is to say: May The Lord add\n\nanother son for me.\n\nJoseph's name is from Yowceph (yo-safe') which basically means: let him add (or\n\nperhaps simply the active participle: adding)\n\nYowceph is the future tense of yacaph (yaw-saf') which means: to add or augment\n\n(often adverbial, to continue to do a thing) So in a manner of speaking maybe\n\nRachel was really saying: Yeah! Keep 'em comin'.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 30:25-26 . . After Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban: Give me\n\nleave to go back to my own homeland. Give me my wives and my children, for\n\nwhom I have served you, that I may go; for well you know what services I have\n\nrendered you.\n\nJacob had agreed to remain with Laban for fourteen years. Well, time's up, and\n\nLaban had no further moral or legal claim either upon Jacob or upon his family.\n\n● Gen 30:27 . . But Laban said to him: If you will indulge me, I have learned by\n\ndivination that The Lord has blessed me on your account.\n\nThe divination that Laban was talking about was a dark art. The Hebrew word\n\nbasically means to hiss, i.e. whisper a (magic) spell; generally, to prognosticate.\n\nDivination was one of the sinful practices that God condemned in the Canaanite\n\npeoples. (Deut 18:9-14)\n\nApparently, somewhere along the line, Laban became very puzzled how Jacob was\n\ndoing so well in animal husbandry. In the fourteen years that Jacob worked for him,\n\nhis flocks not only increased; but they increased beyond reason.\n\nSo he consulted with a mystic, seeking to find out the secret of Jacob's success. Lo\n\nand behold, the diviner discovered Jacob really had no trade secrets to hide at all.\n\nHe was actually under Yahweh's auspices-- Abraham's deity --whom Laban didn't\n\nworship himself but at least recognized as an option.\n\nLaban was justifiably reluctant to let Jacob go. He prospered greatly because of\n\nJacob's abilities and because of his faithfulness; and especially because of his\n\nconnection to Abraham's deity. He was willing to strike almost any bargain that\n\nwould keep Jacob on the job working for him. Once before he had gotten the better\n\npart of the bargain by letting Jacob name his price; so now he made the same\n\nproposition again.\n\n● Gen 30:28 . . And he said: Specify your wage to me and I will give it.\n\n● Gen 30:29-30a . . But he said: You know well how I have served you and how\n\nyour livestock has fared with me. For the little you had before I came has grown to\n\nmuch, since The Lord has blessed you wherever I turned.\n\nYes, Laban knew very well how fortunate he was to have Jacob working on his\n\nranch. But Jacob just wanted to be sure his uncle Laban didn't think Jacob was too\n\nstupid to know it. Jacob rarely stood up for himself. But this time the circumstances\n\nrequired him to be firm.\n\n● Gen 30:30b . . And now, when shall I make provision for my own household?\n\nJacob spent fourteen years of his life making another man rich. Well, it was high\n\ntime he did himself some good for a change.\n\n● Gen 30:31-34 . . He said: What shall I pay you? And Jacob said: Pay me nothing!\n\nIf you will do this thing for me: I will again pasture and keep your flocks: let me\n\npass through your whole flock today, removing from there every speckled and\n\nspotted animal-- every dark-colored sheep and every spotted and speckled goat.\n\nSuch shall be my wages.\n\n. . . In the future when you go over my wages, let my honesty toward you testify\n\nfor me: if there are among my goats any that are not speckled or spotted or any\n\nsheep that are not dark-colored, they got there by theft. And Laban said: Very well,\n\nlet it be as you say.\n\nJacob was supposed to do the culling. But Laban apparently didn't trust him so took\n\nit upon himself to cull out all the mixed breeds and then hide them three days\n\ndistance in who knows what direction. So if Jacob was going to acquire any sheep\n\nand cattle, he was going to have to get them from the flocks of pure breeds;\n\nmaking it even more difficult for him to build a herd of his own. I'm sure Laban\n\nfigured that he would be able to hang on to Jacob many, many years while the poor\n\nslob languished away waiting for the blue ribbon flocks to produce mixed breed\n\nanimals.\n\nLaban really did have a criminal mind. He was incredibly unscrupulous, greedy,\n\nselfish, and dishonest; and a very heartless man to boot. It's difficult to digest he\n\nwas really related to Abraham.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 30:35-36 . . But that same day he removed the streaked and spotted he\n\ngoats and all the speckled and spotted she-goats-- every one that had white on it -\n\nand all the dark-colored sheep, and left them in the charge of his sons. And he put\n\na distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was\n\npasturing the rest of Laban's flock.\n\nBy keeping the mixed breeds so far away from the blue ribbon flocks, there was no\n\nchance Jacob might sneak around and put them together for mating when Laban\n\nwasn't looking. Although there is no record of Jacob ever cheating Laban, the old\n\nman surely remembered that Jacob wasn't totally honest. He stole his brother's\n\nblessing, and tricked his dad. If Jacob would scam his own close family, then he\n\ncould sure do the same thing to outsiders. You can hardly blame Laban for not\n\ntrusting Jacob when the chips were down.\n\n● Gen 30:37-39 . .Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane\n\ntrees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.\n\nAnd he set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, even\n\nin the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they became hot\n\nwhen they came to drink. So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought\n\nforth striped, speckled, and spotted.\n\nTo the modern mind, what Jacob did was purely superstition; but in that day, it\n\nwasn't. Jacob was experienced at animal husbandry. He had tended flocks for\n\nseveral decades; beginning with his dad Isaac's, and then with his uncle Laban's.\n\nJacob wouldn't have tried the striped-rods trick if he hadn't seen it work already\n\nbefore.\n\nJacob didn't use the striped-rods trick to produce multicolored animals, but rather\n\nas a visual aphrodisiac to stimulate the parents to mate more often than usual;\n\nthus increasing his chances of producing the kind of animals he wanted for himself.\n\nWhen Laban's flocks saw the stripes on the sticks, they went into what animal\n\nhusbandry calls heat. From thence, Jacob counted on recessive genes to do their\n\nwork. Even though he never studied Mendelian genetics, Jacob knew from\n\nexperience that even blue-blooded animals produce \"black sheep\" once in a while.\n\nLeaving nature to its course, it could have been many years before Laban's flock of\n\nblue-bloods produced enough culls for Jacob to move away anytime soon. But up\n\nahead we'll see that he had the advantage of a higher power.\n\n● Gen 30:40a . . And Jacob culled the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the\n\nstriped and all the black in the flock of Laban;\n\nThat trick was expected to have the same effect as looking at striped rods.\n\n● Gen 30:40b-43 . . and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with\n\nLaban's flock. Moreover, it came about whenever the stronger of the flock were\n\nmating, that Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the water\n\ntroughs, so that they might mate by the rods; but when the flock was feeble, he did\n\nnot put them in; so the feebler were Laban's and the stronger Jacob's. So the man\n\nbecame exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male\n\nservants and camels and donkeys.\n\nJacob's second strategy was to divide Laban's herd into two groups: the best ones\n\nby themselves, and the inferior ones by themselves, so that he had better control\n\nover the breeding process to his own advantage. Normally, Jacob's husbandry tricks\n\nwould have worked more to Laban's advantage than Jacob's because statistically,\n\nthe majority of the lambs born would have been Laban's had not God intervened.\n\nApparently Jacob's strategy was so successful that he was able to invest in other\n\nkinds of capital too; viz: slaves, camels, and donkeys. You know what? Jacob's\n\ntroupe was beginning to look like that of a sheik; and before long; he's going to\n\nstart acting like one too. The worm is beginning to turn.\n\n● Gen 31:1 . . Now he heard the things that Laban's sons were saying: Jacob has\n\ntaken all that was our father's, and from that which was our father's he has built up\n\nall this wealth.\n\nPeople have a habit of using the \"all\" word just a little to the extreme. Jacob\n\ncertainly didn't take all of Laban's flock; only the lambs that were born\n\nmulticolored. However, what had seemed like a good bargain at the time their dad\n\nmade it, took a most unexpected, and distressing downturn.\n\nSomehow Jacob's flock of cross-breeds was increasing at an alarming rate and\n\nLaban's boys were seeing money on the hoof going to an outsider that should have\n\nbeen theirs. Laban, who before was pleased as punch when Jacob agreed to stay\n\non, must now be wishing with all his heart that he would leave. But the old boy\n\ncouldn't get out of the contract without losing face.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:2 . . Jacob also saw that Laban's manner toward him was not as it had\n\nbeen in the past.\n\nYou can usually tell when people hate your guts. Often they speak away, in another\n\ndirection, while you stand there talking to the side of their face, and sometimes\n\neven to the back of their head. They are so overcome with malice that they cannot\n\neven stand to look directly at you. And when they do look, it's with narrowed,\n\nbeady eyes; squinting, as if into the sun.\n\n● Gen 31:3 . .Then the Lord said to Jacob: Return to the land of your fathers where\n\nyou were born, and I will be with you.\n\nSome people interpret that to read: And I will be waiting for you. They see it that\n\nway because they insist that Jews can't be blessed when they're out of the place of\n\nblessing; viz: out of Eretz Israel. But that's nonsense in Jacob's case. God promised\n\nHe to be with him and protect him wherever he went. (Gen 28:15)\n\nTime to go; and the timing couldn't be better. Laban really loathed Jacob by now\n\nand I'm sure he didn't want his nephew working on the ranch any longer. A falling\n\nout isn't necessarily a bad thing. I often take one as a nudge that God wants me\n\nelsewhere. Sometimes you have to burn one bridge before crossing another.\n\n● Gen 31:4 . . Jacob had Rachel and Leah called to the field, where his flock was,\n\nThis next conversation was for the sisters' ears only so Jacob sprung an\n\nunannounced briefing out in the pastures where no one would overhear and go\n\ntattle to Laban. Jacob wants his wives' support for his next move; and he needs to\n\nfind out how they feel about their dad and if they are ready to leave home and go\n\nout on their own. Rachel and Leah had never been away from Haran, nor away\n\nfrom their dad's influence before now; nor has anyone till now given them a say in\n\ntheir destiny.\n\n● Gen 31:5-7 . . and said to them: I see that your father's manner toward me is\n\nnot as it has been in the past. But the God of my father has been with me. As you\n\nknow, I have served your father with all my might; but your father has cheated me,\n\nchanging my wages time and again. God, however, would not let him do me harm.\n\nNo matter what Laban did in his nefarious efforts to thwart Jacob's prosperity, God\n\nwould turn it to Jacob's advantage. He was indeed bullet proof and it must have\n\nfrustrated his father-in-law to no end.\n\n● Gen 31:8-9 . . If he said thus \"The speckled shall be your wages\" then all the\n\nflocks would drop speckled young. And if he said thus: \"The streaked shall be your\n\nwages\" then all the flocks would drop streaked young. God has taken away your\n\nfather's livestock and given it to me.\n\nLaban's blatant lack of scruples is beyond belief. He and Jacob had agreed that all\n\nthe multicolored animals would be Jacob's. But whenever the purebred flock began\n\nproducing too much of a certain strain-- say, the streaked ones --then Laban would\n\nchange his mind and say that Jacob could only keep the spotted ones.\n\nWell, then God made the herd produce more spotted ones. And when Laban would\n\nchange the arrangement yet again and say that Jacob couldn't have any more\n\nspotted ones and could only have the ones that were striped; then God would see\n\nto it that striped babies were born. So, no matter which way Laban went, Jacob\n\nalways won.\n\n● Gen 31:10-12 . . Once, at the mating time of the flocks, I had a dream in which I\n\nsaw that the he-goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled, and mottled.\n\nAnd in the dream an angel of God said to me: Jacob! Here; I answered. And he\n\nsaid: Note well that all the he-goats which are mating with the flock are streaked,\n\nspeckled, and mottled; for I have noted all that Laban has been doing to you.\n\nThere weren't really any streaked or speckled or mottled rams mating with the\n\newes because Laban's animals were all blue ribbon. But people in those days didn't\n\nknow about recessive genes like we know about them today. So God showed Jacob,\n\nin a way that he could understand, that the animals doing the mating were the\n\nheterozygous ones. God, who can see past outside colors, and deep into genetic\n\ncode, made sure the right ones were mating so Jacob's herd would increase to his\n\nadvantage in spite of Laban's interference. (chuckle) Talk about a stacked deck!\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:13 . . I am the God of Beth-el, where you anointed a pillar and where you\n\nmade a vow to me. Now, arise and leave this land and return to your native land.\n\nI wonder if Jacob could have used that as an excuse to depart; viz: tell Laban that\n\nGod appeared and ordered him to return to Canaan and make good on his vow?\n\nMoses tried something like that with Pharaoh (Ex 3:18). But Pharaoh still wouldn't\n\nlet them go, so God had to destroy Egypt to make him comply.\n\nI seriously doubt that Laban would've ever let Jacob go on religious grounds. It's\n\npossible that's why Jacob sneaked away: to avoid a violent confrontation with his\n\nfather-in-law that could lead to Laban's death. Leah and Rachel might have\n\ndifficulty with that. Though the man was a weasel, he was still their dad.\n\n● Gen 31:14-15 . .Then Rachel and Leah replied and said to him: Have we then still\n\na share and an inheritance in our father's house? Are we not considered by him as\n\nstrangers? For he has sold us and even totally consumed our money!\n\nNow the truth comes out. All along the girls had resented the calculating, business\n\nlike way that their dad sold them into marriage; like they were commodities: not\n\neven caring how they might feel about living with Jacob; and especially how the\n\nsisters might feel about sharing the same husband.\n\nAnd what an incredible louse! The girls were each supposed to get a dowry, but\n\nLaban kept it back and then, of all things, spent their dowries on himself; or, worse\n\nyet, on himself and on the girls' brothers; which reminds me of one of my favorite\n\nbumper stickers:\n\nMEN ARE NOT PIGS\n\nPigs are gentle, intelligent animals.\n\nLaban was obviously some sort of maladjusted sociopath with one of those\n\n\"borderline\" personality disorders. I don't know what happened to him in life to\n\nmake him that way, but something was very wrong with that man. The attitude he\n\ndisplayed toward his little girls was absolutely abnormal. It was just as abnormal as\n\nany of the psycho dads in the news from time to time who get prosecuted for\n\nabusing their own little flesh and blood daughters.\n\n● Gen 31:16 . .Truly, all the wealth that God has taken away from our father\n\nbelongs to us and to our children. Now then, do just as God has told you.\n\nYaaaaaay! (cheering section activity) That's it! We're out of here. The girls are\n\ngrown women with kids now and have to be thinking about their future. Leah and\n\nRachel are ready to leave home and kiss Haran good-bye forever.\n\nThank God that Rachel, Leah, and Dinah knew a man like Jacob or they might have\n\nbeen poisoned on men all their lives. He wasn't perfect, yes that is true. But Jacob\n\nwas an excellent family man. For twenty years Rachel and Leah observed and\n\ncompared their brothers and their dad to Jacob. And guess what. They much\n\npreferred to live with Jacob. He was fair, sensitive, caring, accommodating, and\n\nalways looking out for their best interests and letting them have their own way\n\nwhenever possible.\n\n* You know, Jacob didn't have to sleep with the maids. He could have put his foot\n\ndown and refused. But he did it to soothe his wives. I'm sure he was aware of their\n\nrivalry amongst themselves and tried to help keep the peace as best as he could.\n\nLife wasn't easy for Jacob; having to live with two miserable women.\n\nBut he was willing to go the extra mile; and even let the girls have a say in big\n\ndecisions effecting the family's future. In the culture of that day, he really didn't\n\nhave to. Do you think Laban or his boys would have been concerned about how the\n\ngirls might feel about moving away to a new land? No way. Their dad and brothers\n\nwere nothing like that. They would have just simply marched in and barked an\n\nannouncement: Okay everybody; start packing! We leave for California in two days!\n\n● Gen 31:17-18 . .Thereupon Jacob put his children and wives on camels; and he\n\ndrove off all his livestock and all the wealth that he had amassed, the livestock in\n\nhis possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the\n\nland of Canaan.\n\nThat must have been quite a sight. Camels and people and supplies, dust billowing\n\neverywhere, with Jacob's drovers moving the herds, followed by a remuda of burros\n\nbringing up the rear. It was a real old fashion trail drive, kind of like an 1840's\n\nwagon train. The girls must have been very excited to be making their very first\n\nlong-distance trek away from home. Rueben and his brothers of course saw it as\n\none big adventure. Yahoooooo! Move 'em out! Beer-sheba or bust!\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:19 . . Meanwhile Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her\n\nfather's household idols.\n\nLabans's household gods may have corresponded to ILANI-- family gods of the Nuzi\n\nhousehold, and to the Roman's penates --household gods who were thought to\n\nprotect food supplies and assure the general well-being of the family.\n\nSince Laban was known for divination, some have suggested that Rachel may have\n\nstolen his gods in order to prevent him from discovering Jacob's whereabouts.\n\nMaybe, but I think Rachel just wanted those gods for their potential access to\n\nprovidence.\n\n● Gen 31:20-21 . . Jacob kept Laban the Aramean in the dark, not telling him that\n\nhe was fleeing, and fled with all that he had. Soon he was across the Euphrates and\n\nheading toward the hill country of Gilead.\n\nThe precise route Jacob took to go home is uncertain. It's hard to believe that he\n\ncame directly south through the Syrian Desert on the back side of Mt. Hermon.\n\nMaybe he did, I don't really know; but it sure looks that way\n\nThe region of Gilead is on the east side of the Jordan Valley in between Yam\n\nKinneret (the Sea of Galilee) and the Dead Sea. Why Jacob didn't proceed down\n\nthrough Lebanon and the West Bank I'm not sure; except maybe he was in a very\n\nbig hurry to get away from Laban and back on relatively safer home turf. The\n\nGilead route would eventually take him into the Jordan Valley, one of the best\n\nsources of water and pasture for his animals. In Abraham's day, the Jordan Valley\n\nwas well watered everywhere, like the garden of God. It was probably still in pretty\n\ngood shape yet in Jacob's.\n\nNowadays, usually all that travelers really need are gas stations and motels. But in\n\nthat day, the selection of a route was always dictated by the need of water and\n\npasture for the animals; not only the herds, but also the ones people rode upon.\n\nThe Jordan Valley was a relatively hazardous route because lions lived in that area\n\nback in Jacob's day; so his drovers would have to guard the livestock day and night\n\nto protect them from predators.\n\n● Gen 31:22 . . On the third day, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.\n\nLaban was off some distance from home shearing his sheep, which usually included\n\na festival of some sort. The messengers probably waited till the shearing was done,\n\nand the party was over, before laying the bad news on ol' Laban.\n\nI'd imagine he must have been absolutely livid with rage; and probably got so\n\nworked up he actually turned red and began perspiring. Defeat is one thing. But to\n\nbe beaten by kin, by a nephew no less, was unbearable.\n\n● Gen 31:23 . . So he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of\n\nseven days, catching up with him in the hill country of Gilead.\n\nIt took Jacob ten days to go the same distance Laban covered in seven-- that is if\n\nLaban departed right away without delay; which he probably didn't. It would take at\n\nleast a day or two to round up all his relatives and prepare for the journey. Laban's\n\ncontingent had an advantage though. They weren't encumbered by herds and\n\nwomen and children, so they could cover a whole lot more ground in one day than\n\nJacob's troupe.\n\n● Gen 31:24 . . But God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and\n\nsaid to him: Beware of attempting anything with Jacob, good or bad.\n\nThe Stone Tanach reads: Beware lest you speak with Jacob either good or bad.\n\nBut if God meant for Laban to stay completely away from Jacob and not say a\n\nsingle word to him, Laban would have gone home right then and there because he\n\nknew better than to mess with Jacob's god. Maybe Laban didn't worship Yahweh,\n\nbut did at least fear Him. The book of Revelation tells of people who are absolutely\n\nterrified of God, but yet still refuse to submit. (Rev 6:12-17, Rev 16:10-11)\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:25 . . Laban overtook Jacob. Jacob had pitched his tent on the Height,\n\nand Laban with his kinsmen encamped in the hill country of Gilead.\n\nOnce Laban's scouts located Jacob's troupe, his contingent made camp for the night\n\nand moved on up the next day; probably very early before Jacob's caravan could\n\nget up and moving again.\n\nWhat a chore that must have been. First everyone had to be fed breakfast, which\n\nmeant a whole lot of cooking. Somebody had to round up firewood for the portable\n\novens. Then the women prepared the meals, which must have been work itself\n\nsince no one had packaged foods in those days. Then they had to do the dishes,\n\nrepack, dismantle the tents, and load everything back on to the camels and\n\ndonkeys. Meanwhile the drovers were out tightening up the herds and rounding up\n\nstrays.\n\nInto this busy scene rode MadDog Laban and his trigger-happy posse.\n\n● Gen 31:26-27a . . And Laban said to Jacob: What did you mean by keeping me in\n\nthe dark and carrying off my daughters like captives of the sword? Why did you flee\n\nin secrecy and mislead me and not tell me?\n\nDuh. Like he really didn't know? Laban's kind are all alike. In my 70+ years, I've\n\nseen enough of them to know. Jerks like him are never in the wrong about\n\nanything; ever. And they always attempt to throw suspicion off themselves by\n\ntrumping up a hollow charge against the very people they wronged. One of their\n\nfavorite demands is: What's the matter with you; why are you acting like that?\n\nThey are so aggravating with their perpetual habit of feigning a pious ignorance of\n\ntheir own self-generated bad circumstances.\n\nLike captives of the sword? What does that imply-- that Jacob kidnapped Rachel\n\nand Leah and made slaves out of them? What utter nonsense! They were his wives\n\nas Laban very well knew!\n\nAnd did he insinuate that Jacob dragged the girls (excuse me; the full-grown\n\nmarried women) away from Haran against their will? Laban himself was likely wont\n\nto drag a spouse around the whole world regardless of how she might feel about it.\n\nWhy would it be wrong for Jacob to do it but not wrong for Laban? And that is\n\nanother of his kind's traits. They are so quick to take the high moral ground and\n\nmake the rules for everyone else to follow while at the same time fully exempting\n\nthemselves from the very same standards.\n\nNOTE: It's very interesting that Laban never even dreamed that Jacob consulted\n\nwith Rachel and Leah first prior to departing for Isaac's turf. No doubt because that\n\nwas something he would never do himself.\n\n● Gen 31:27b . . I would have sent you off with festive music, with timbrel and lyre.\n\nWhat a bare-faced lie. The only music Laban would have arranged for is some to\n\naccompany himself while he danced on Jacob's grave.\n\n● Gen 31:28a . .You did not even let me kiss my sons and daughters good-bye!\n\nLaban probably never kissed them before anyway, so why should Jacob think he\n\nwould want to do it now? Didn't it ever occur to Laban's enormous conceit that\n\nmaybe his kin might all be glad to be rid of him?\n\n● Gen 31:28b-29a . . It was a foolish thing for you to do. I have it in my power to\n\ndo you harm;\n\nJacob's uncle is the king of meddlers. In Laban's imperialistic mind, Jacob deserved\n\npunishment for failing to consult with His Lordship before pulling up stakes and\n\nheading south. But Jacob has done nothing truly reprehensible. He's a grown man\n\nwith a right to his own destiny. Jacob owes his uncle nothing; not even an\n\nexplanation because the man is nothing less than a demon's seed; and on top of\n\nthat a thoughtless bully and a stupendous bigot.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:29b . . but the god of your father\n\nThe \"god of your father\" is all the same as saying your family's god. There's a\n\nhumorous difference between Jacob's family god singular and Laban's family gods\n\nplural-- Jacob's can't be kidnapped and carried around in a saddle bag.\n\n● Gen 31:29c . . said to me last night: Beware of attempting anything with Jacob,\n\ngood or bad.\n\nThat was a no idle threat and I think the man knew it. If Laban tried to persuade\n\nJacob to return to Paddan-aram; he would die. If he harmed Jacob; he would die. If\n\nhe attempted to take the girls, the grandkids, and all the flocks; he would die.\n\nIn other words, God told that man not to interfere with Jacob's life in any way at all\n\nor He would give him good reason to regret it. From now on, Jacob, and all that\n\npertained to him, was off limits-- including Laban's former daughters, who were\n\nboth married women; old enough to be on their own, and completely out their dad's\n\njurisdiction. When they were girls living at home under their father's roof; then\n\ntheir dad could rule them, but marriage supersedes a woman's association with her\n\nfather.\n\n\"This one shall be called Woman, for from Man was she taken. Hence a man leaves\n\nhis father and mother and clings to his wife, so that they become one flesh.\" (Gen\n\n2:23)\n\n● Gen 31:30a . .Very well, you had to leave because you were longing for your\n\nfather's house.\n\nJacob had to leave because God issued him marching orders. And Jacob really\n\nneeded to go anyway. Life with uncle Laban had become unbearable. It was\n\nhumiliating, and it was suffocating. Jacob could never achieve his greatest potential\n\nwith a man like that always controlling his destiny.\n\nLeaving Laban's ranch was in truth, an act of self defense; not just for Jacob, but\n\nfor Leah and Rachel too. Their dad ruled them from the day they were born. That's\n\nokay for minor children, but it is not an okay thing for married women. Married\n\nwomen need to be royalty in a home of their own, and be allowed to do their own\n\nthinking and to make their own decisions-- Princesses Of Quite A Lot, and Queens\n\nOf Everything.\n\n* I've heard it said that no one is truly a failure when they can always serve as a\n\nbad example. (chuckle) Sort of like ex drunks, smokers, and drug addicts. Well . . a\n\nman like Laban is a perfect example of a parent from hell. He's probably the worst\n\ncase scenario there is. Hopefully most of us will never have to deal with an in-law\n\nlike him.\n\nBut there are only two ways to deal with parents and in-laws from Hell: 1) stand up\n\nfor your rights, and 2) get as far away as possible where their meddling tendrils\n\ncan't mess up your life. Jacob and the girls did both; and The Lord's providence was\n\nright there at hand to make sure they succeeded.\n\n● Gen 31:30b . . but why did you steal my gods?\n\nLaban accused Jacob of taking the gods without even first inquiring if he actually\n\ndid. In the American system of criminal justice, a person is assumed innocent until\n\nproven guilty; and the burden of proof is upon the accuser. Not only is that a very\n\ngood principle of civic government, but it is also an excellent social skill and will go\n\na long way towards nurturing friendships.\n\n● Gen 31:31 . . Jacob answered Laban, saying: I was afraid because I thought you\n\nwould take your daughters from me by force.\n\nJacob was probably right about that. He worked for Laban twenty years and\n\nsuspected the old boy would never let Jacob take the girls away from Paddan-aram.\n\nLaban was definitely one of those over-my-dead-body kinds of people. With them;\n\nit's not a matter of doing what's right and fair all around; it's always a matter of\n\nwho's going to win. But it's doubtful Laban would've traveled all that way just to\n\nretrieve his daughters or his gods: I've no doubt that what he really wanted was\n\nJacob's livestock.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:32 . . But anyone with whom you find your gods shall not remain alive! In\n\nthe presence of our kinsmen, point out what I have of yours and take it. Jacob, of\n\ncourse, did not know that Rachel had stolen them.\n\nIt might appear that Jacob spoke rashly. But in that day, the code of Hammurabi\n\nstipulated that the theft of temple gods was a death offense. Apparently, it was\n\ntruly a very serious crime in the culture of that day to steal household gods as well.\n\nNOTE: The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC. Precisely when Jacob\n\nwas born has not yet been accurately established. Some feel his birth took place\n\nsometime between 2000 and 1700 BC.\n\nAnyway; if Laban had been disposed to honor Hammurabi's code, then he wouldn't\n\nhave been so quick to condemn Jacob. But the man was a code unto himself; which\n\nhas been pretty obvious all along.\n\n● Gen 31:33-35 . . So Laban went into Jacob's tent and Leah's tent and the tents of\n\nthe two maidservants; but he did not find them. Leaving Leah's tent, he entered\n\nRachel's tent.\n\n. . . Rachel, meanwhile, had taken the idols and placed them in the camel cushion\n\nand sat on them; and Laban rummaged through the tent without finding them. For\n\nshe said to her father: Let not my lord take it amiss that I cannot rise before you,\n\nfor the custom of women is upon me. Thus he searched, but could not find the\n\nhousehold idols.\n\n* I tend to think that if Rachel was strong enough to travel across country on the\n\nback of a jostling camel, then she was certainly strong enough to stand for a\n\nmoment or two.\n\nIt's likely that Rachel's choice of words was a subtle indication to her dad that she\n\nhad better sense than to plunk her derriere down on something as sacred as the\n\nhousehold gods where there would be a chance of desecrating them by contact with\n\nsomething yucky; especially in a day when the sciences of feminine hygiene and\n\nsanitation weren't all that advanced.\n\nShe may indeed have actually been in her period at the time. If not, then Jacob\n\nhimself would have suspected she was concealing something. You've got to hand it\n\nto Rachel. Considering the stakes, she was one cool lady under fire. Well; that was\n\nindeed one time that what some women deem \"the curse\" came in very handy.\n\n● Gen 31:36-37 . . Now Jacob became incensed and took up his grievance with\n\nLaban. Jacob spoke up and said to Laban: What is my crime, what is my guilt that\n\nyou should pursue me? You rummaged through all my things; what have you found\n\nof all your household objects? Set it here, before my kin and yours, and let them\n\ndecide between us two.\n\nIt's a pity Jacob didn't have a force of armed men at his disposal like grandpa\n\nAbraham did at one time. Jacob and his ranch hands were pastoral men, totally\n\nuntrained for war, and certainly not prepared to deal with a bully like Laban. When\n\npeople are unarmed, and unskilled in warfare, they are easy prey, and might just\n\nas well kiss their human rights good-bye. There are those who yearn for peace at\n\nany price. But freedom is not free. In this evil world; freedom is a priceless treasure\n\nretained only by those with enough mettle to defend it.\n\nJacob endured countless indignities at the hands of his father-in-law, which he\n\nsuffered in silence for many years. All the pent up emotion which he restrained for\n\nso long finally poured out in an unfettered tirade. Jacob demanded, in the witness\n\nof the kin they both had in common, to justify such a hot pursuit to catch him\n\nbefore he reached home with what was, in every way, rightfully his own private\n\nproperty. Laban could only maintain an embarrassed silence as Jacob spoke.\n\n● Gen 31:38a . .These twenty years I have spent in your service, your ewes and\n\nshe-goats never miscarried,\n\nThat is an incredible record. A certain number of still births are to be expected in\n\nany herd. But they never occurred because Jacob was gentle: he never whipped the\n\nanimals, nor drove and fatigued Laban's herds like some overly zealous, insensitive\n\nshepherds might do; especially with flocks that belong to someone else and are not\n\ntheir own. And plus, Laban knew very well himself from divination, that Jacob's god\n\never watched over the pregnant animals so Laban could prosper under Jacob's care.\n\n● Gen 31:38b . . nor did I feast on rams from your flock.\n\nIt was a shepherd's right to feed himself with meat from a flock he was hired to\n\ntend. But Jacob never exercised that right.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:39 . .That which was torn by beasts I never brought to you; I myself\n\nmade good the loss; you exacted it of me, whether snatched by day or snatched by\n\nnight.\n\nIf Jacob had but brought the remains in to show Laban, it would have would cleared\n\nhim of any suspicion of negligence in guarding the herds from predators. But by not\n\nbringing them in, he automatically took the blame for their loss and paid for them\n\nout of his own pocket rather than make Laban absorb the loss. Why Jacob did that I\n\ndon't know because he sure didn't have to. All he had to do to prove to Laban that\n\nhe was there on the job guarding the herd from predators, was to demonstrate that\n\nhe drove them away before they could finish eating their prey. Only a man truly\n\nlooking out for the best interests of his master would ever do what Jacob did.\n\n● Gen 31:40 . . Often, scorching heat ravaged me by day and frost by night; and\n\nsleep fled from my eyes.\n\nPastoral life takes its toll on men. Just look at some who have been ranching and\n\nfarming for a number of years. They are old way before their time. The sun and the\n\nelements give them shoe leather faces lined with deep creases. Jacob, by the way,\n\nwas at least 95 at this time and probably looked 150 after all those years out on\n\nthe range with his father Isaac's herds, and later; his uncle Laban's.\n\n● Gen 31:41 . . Of the twenty years that I spent in your household, I served you\n\nfourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flocks; and you\n\nchanged my wages time and again.\n\nJacob reminded Laban of his service of twenty years, fourteen of which had been\n\nsimply for the privilege of marrying his daughters. He didn't mention Laban's\n\ndeception (probably for Leah's sake), which had doubled the length of his service in\n\nreturn for a woman he didn't want in the first place.\n\nIn spite of all the good, of all his conscientious service, and of all the charity that\n\nJacob had lavished undeserving upon Laban, the man revised his agreement with\n\nJacob ten times in an evil-minded attempt to garner all the gains for himself and to\n\nprevent his own nephew from prospering. The man sure knew how to repay loyalty.\n\nYeah-- right in the teeth. And in the end, he fully intended to send his nephew\n\naway totally empty handed-- if indeed he would even spare Jacob's life.\n\nIt would require a college degree in criminal psychology to understand what makes\n\na man like Laban tick. He was really too messed up to comprehend. But it's obvious\n\nthat Laban so hated Jacob that he couldn't stand letting him keep a single thing\n\nthat once belonged to himself. You know, even if there were no hell, one would\n\nhave to be constructed to quarantine people like Laban because there is nowhere\n\nelse for them to go. The kingdom of God is a place of peace and kindness. If certain\n\nundesirables like Laban were allowed in the kingdom of God; in short order they'd\n\nturn it into another kingdom of men.\n\n● Gen 31:42 . . Had not the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of\n\nIsaac, been with me, you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God took\n\nnotice of my plight and the toil of my hands, and He gave judgment last night.\n\nAnyone there that day, who had the slightest conscience at all, must have looked\n\nupon Laban as one would look upon the most crooked, and upon the most\n\ndishonest, unscrupulous, and unthankful of men with utter disgust. Jacob told it like\n\nit was, and no one objected; and no one stood up to speak in Laban's defense.\n\n● Gen 31:43a . .Then Laban spoke up and said to Jacob: The daughters are my\n\ndaughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks; all that you\n\nsee is mine.\n\nOh, give it up already!! Someone really needed to teach that communistic crumb\n\nsome principles related to the transfer of property. The girls were no longer his\n\ndaughters. They were married women: one flesh with a man who worked very hard\n\nto both earn them and deserve them. The children were fathered by Jacob, not by\n\nLaban. And the flocks were Jacob's by right, not by loan nor by theft, nor by gift,\n\nnor by fraud. They were his honest compensation; the very wages that Laban\n\nhimself had agreed upon.\n\nEverything on that mountain pertaining to Jacob was personal property and Laban\n\nhad no right to lay claim to any of it. He was just very lucky that Jacob was not of\n\nthe kind to show him the business end of a shotgun and point him north, back the\n\nway he came.\n\nWhen Laban finally had an opportunity to respond to Jacob's outburst, he couldn't\n\nsay anything at all by way of denial to Jacob's claims and charges. Instead; he tried\n\nto divert attention away from the embarrassing facts by changing the subject.\n\nThough even himself knew very well he was in the wrong; a conceited man like\n\nLaban just can't bring himself to make public acknowledgement of his guilt.\n\nPeople like him typically try whatever means they can muster to shift the blame\n\naway from themselves; or at least shift the attention away from their own\n\nculpability to whatever real or imagined grievances they can find in others.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:43b . .Yet what can I do now about my daughters or the children they\n\nhave borne?\n\nHis question was just a smoke screen. Laban as much as said: It would be contrary\n\nto all human sensibilities to do anything to bring grief to my own flesh and blood.\n\nHow could you possibly think I am capable of such a thing?\n\nLaban's lack of integrity is almost beyond belief. He followed Jacob for seven days\n\nand at least three hundred miles for the specific purpose of murdering him and\n\ntaking all the herds and all the people back to Paddan-aram. That wouldn't have\n\ncaused his kin grief? --to murder his grandkids' dad, and to murder Leah's and\n\nRachel's husband?\n\n● Gen 31:44 . . Come, then, let us make a pact, you and I, that there may be a\n\nwitness between you and me.\n\nInstead of ending Jacob's life, which was no doubt his original intent, Laban now\n\nproposes a very noble settlement-- a gentleman's non-aggression pact between\n\nhimself and Jacob.\n\n● Gen 31:45-46 . .Thereupon Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. And Jacob\n\nsaid to his kinsmen: Gather stones. So they took stones and made a mound; and\n\nthey partook of a meal there by the mound.\n\nPillars were common in those days as watchers-- gods who intervene in the affairs\n\nof men. (cf. Gen 28:22, Dan 4:17)\n\n● Gen 31:47a . . Laban named it Yegar-sahadutha,\n\nYegar-sahadutha is Aramaic, Laban's tongue, and means: heap of the testimony, or\n\ncairn of witness.\n\n● Gen 31:47b . . but Jacob named it Gal-ed.\n\nGal-ed is Hebrew and means pretty much the same thing.\n\n● Gen 31:48-49 . . And Laban declared: This mound is a witness between you and\n\nme this day. That is why it was named Gal-ed; And [it was called] Mizpah, because\n\nhe said: May the Lord watch between you and me, when we are out of sight of each\n\nother.\n\nMizpah means watchtower. Laban wasn't the one who called it Mizpah. It went on\n\nto become known as that because of his pronouncement.\n\nDid Laban mean to imply that Jacob needed watching? During those twenty years in\n\nLaban's employ, what had Jacob ever done on the sly to harm his uncle? Jacob's\n\nsterling employment record was certainly sufficient to recommend him to any\n\nnormal person; but his uncle just can't stop himself from denigrating Jacob right up\n\nto the bitter end of their association.\n\nNOTE: All those years working on Laban's ranch, and all the time living with with\n\nfour women and a posse of kids, had made Jacob a better man; while the same\n\ntime forged his uncle into something worse than he was to begin with.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:50 . . If you ill-treat my daughters or take other wives besides my\n\ndaughters-- though no one else be about, remember, God Himself will be witness\n\nbetween you and me.\n\nThat was just paternal bombast. Had Jacob ever ill treated Rachel and Leah all\n\nthose years in Laban's employ? When had the girls ever complained to their dad\n\nabout Jacob's behavior? Was it really reasonable to assume he would ever abuse\n\nthem some day? No it wasn't. Jacob had always treated the girls with kindness and\n\nconsideration, and Laban had neither cause nor reason to think Jacob would ever\n\ndo otherwise. And since when did Laban really care about Rachel and Leah anyway?\n\nHe sold them like livestock, and spent their dowry on himself.\n\nMarry other women? Jacob wasn't a womanizer; nor had he ever been a\n\nwomanizer. He had only wanted just one in the first place; but was tricked by\n\nLaban himself into a bigamous marriage with two sisters that Israel's covenanted\n\nlaw would later forbid. But still, as a grown man, in the culture of that day, Jacob\n\nhad every right to a harem while Laban had no right whatsoever to impose limits on\n\nthe size and/or the nature of Jacob's family relations.\n\nLaban intended for the stone pile to be a boundary between himself and Jacob so\n\nthat Jacob would not come past it later on for revenge after God made him strong\n\nenough to whup Laban. But that was another evidence of his poor judgment of\n\nJacob's character.\n\nJacob was definitely not a war-faring man; anybody could see that. He was just like\n\nhis dad Isaac; who was also a peaceable man, satisfied to simply stop the strife\n\nbetween himself and his enemies. No way would Jacob ever seek revenge. It just\n\nwasn't in his nature to do that. But Laban had a wicked conscience. It wasn't\n\nbeyond him to project his own base motives upon others and assume they would do\n\nthe very same things he himself would do in their place.\n\nNOTE: There are people in politics that are so Machiavellian that if they can't find\n\nany dirt on you, they'll contrive some and throw it at their opponent in hopes it\n\nsticks in the public's thinking; which it often does.\n\nIn return, Laban would promise to not come past the monument to cause Jacob any\n\nharm; which he no doubt would if God hadn't intervened to prevent it. What a\n\nhollow covenant. All Laban did that day was put up an appearance of nobility and\n\ntry his best to save face in an otherwise very embarrassing situation. And the\n\nmeanwhile heaping additional indignities upon Jacob, and slurring the reputation of\n\na very decent man.\n\nNOTE: Bethuel's blood produced three really good women: Rebecca, Leah, and\n\nRachel. You gotta wonder what happened to the men. Why were they all such\n\nmisfires? Families like that are a genetic mystery. Just look at Cain and Abel-- two\n\nbrothers from the very same parents; yet one was a good man and the other not.\n\nGo figure.\n\n● Gen 31:51 . . And Laban said to Jacob: Here is this mound and here the pillar\n\nwhich I have set up between you and me:\n\nLaban didn't set up anything. He only participated in dedicating the pillar. Jacob and\n\nhis sons set it up with their own hands. And it was all their own idea, not Laban's.\n\nLaban likely reasoned that seeing as how he outranked his son-in-law in the social\n\norder, then whatever they did together should be reckoned to Laban's credit; sort\n\nof like the Pharaohs taking credit for their pyramids when it was others who did the\n\nactual construction. (cf. Ecc 2;4-6 & Dan 4:30)\n\n● Gen 31:52 . . this mound shall be witness and this pillar shall be witness that I\n\nam not to cross to you past this mound, and that you are not to cross to me past\n\nthis mound and this pillar, with hostile intent.\n\nI think Laban was beginning to become just a little bit nervous because there was\n\nsomething different about Jacob. He wasn't acting like the quiet, humble, hard\n\nworking hired hand Laban knew up in Paddan-aram. Jacob was acting more like a\n\nsheik. And I think Laban was just a little unraveled by that. He wasn't accustomed\n\nto that kind of a Jacob. And he knew it would be impossible to defeat Jacob while\n\nJacob's god watched over him. And I think he was afraid that if Jacob ever did come\n\nup against him, Yhvh would make sure he won.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 31:53a . . May the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor-- their ancestral\n\ndeities --judge between us.\n\nLaban equated Abraham's God with Nahor's gods. Big mistake. Not all gods are\n\nequal. But to a man like Laban, one is as good as another.\n\n● Gen 31:53b . . And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.\n\nNo way was Jacob going to honor Nahor's gods with an oath. And speaking of that:\n\nHere in America, the US Constitution protects religious liberty. However, the\n\nConstitution does not require American citizens to respect all religions equally. In\n\nour mind's eye, burning a holy book such as the Koran is no more destructive than\n\nburning yesterday's newspaper; and the First Amendment grants us the right to say\n\nso.\n\nThe US Government accommodates Arab feelings about Islam and the Koran\n\nbecause it is in the USA's national interests to do so. But I'm not a politician, nor do\n\nI desire to be one if it means compromising Christ's feelings about religions that\n\npropagate teachings different than his. (cf. 1Cor 10:25-31, 1Cor 16:22, and Gal\n\n1:8-9)\n\nAnyway, that ended the meeting and Laban went back to his own camp for the\n\nnight.\n\n● Gen 31:54 . . Jacob then offered up a sacrifice on the Height, and invited his\n\nkinsmen to partake of the meal. After the meal, they spent the night on the Height.\n\nJacob's sacrifice wasn't an 'olah (o-law') which is incinerated to ashes. It was a\n\nzebach (zeh'-bakh); which more resembles Passover, where the lamb is both an\n\noffering and a meal. So then, a biblical sacrifice isn't eo ipso something given up or\n\ndestroyed, but essentially pertains to something dedicated; in this case: a festive\n\ndinner in Yahweh's honor.\n\nYou can bet that was a very happy occasion. Jacob's family was finally going to be\n\nrid of ol' MadDog Laban once and for all; and without violence too. Since a good\n\npart of the day was wrecked already, they stayed and planned on leaving the next\n\nday after an impromptu Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n● Gen 32:1 . . Early in the morning, Laban kissed his sons and daughters and bade\n\nthem good-bye; then Laban left on his journey homeward.\n\nNo further mention is made of Laban nor his sons in the Bible. He has the\n\ndistinction of being one of Scripture's most outstanding examples of a worldly, man;\n\ngrossly infected with an acute case of unbridled avarice, and completely void of\n\ngenuine faith in the one true deity.\n\nHe knew about Yahweh, and he was certainly given a thorough enough witness up\n\nat his ranch, and in his dreams. He had seen the reality of God in Jacob's life, along\n\nwith the power of God in His blessings and protections of Jacob all those years.\n\nLaban himself had, as a consequence of associating with Jacob, enjoyed The Lord's\n\nprovidence, and became wealthy on account of having God's man working for him\n\non his ranch.\n\nNevertheless, Rebecca's brother remained a hard-core pagan; seeking material gain\n\nfor himself to the exclusion of all other considerations. Rather than seeking to\n\nfollow only The Lord, and gain the light of life, he merely envied, and resented, the\n\nblessings that God bestowed upon his son-in-law. Laban finally ended up with\n\nneither light nor blessings. Thus, Jacob and his community remained in association\n\nwith The Light, while Laban and his clan melted into the darkness.\n\nNext hurtle: Big Red, a.k.a. Mr. Esau ben Isaac.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 32:2 . . Jacob went on his way, and angels of God encountered him.\n\nSince the angels had nothing to say to Jacob, they obviously weren't there as\n\nmessengers. I believe the angels came for an \"effect\". Here's what I mean.\n\nJacob's primary concern during his trip back to Canaan wasn't really his father-in\n\nlaw's pursuit. His real concern was the inevitable confrontation with his brother\n\nEsau. The appearance of those angels very likely boosted Jacob's courage, and\n\nassured him God was still in the area and still looking out for his safety and making\n\ngood on the promise at Gen 28:15.\n\nToday, in our time, it's very unlikely to encounter celestial beings. But the\n\nmessages we hear in church or in synagogue can do the job of boosting courage\n\njust the same if we but hear those messages through an ear of faith. Here's a good\n\nexample.\n\nIn the third chapter of Isaiah, God predicted, through preaching, that terrible things\n\nwere in store for Jerusalem. I mean really terrible things that would give you a bad\n\ncase of butterflies in your stomach. You can imagine the effect that had on those\n\nwho heeded what the prophet was saying. Well, God didn't want His believing\n\nfollowers worrying themselves that the impending doom was evident that God had\n\ntossed them aside, so this is what He said to them; through the preacher:\n\n\"Hail the just man, for he shall fare well; he shall eat the fruit of his works.\" (Isa\n\n3:10)\n\nGod wanted His believing followers to know that although they would have to live\n\nthrough all those horrible judgments, it didn't mean they had lost His favor; they\n\nwould just be collateral damage, so to speak. Well, Jacob can't escape his brother,\n\nbut regardless of how it turned out; God would still be on his side.\n\n* Webster's defines \"courage\" as: mental or moral strength to venture, persevere,\n\nand withstand danger, fear, or difficulty. Courage is an excellent virtue; and it's\n\ninteresting who has it and who doesn't.\n\nFearless people aren't courageous. Scaredy cats facing their fears are the ones with\n\ncourage. Fearless people are too often reckless and take foolish chances; whereas\n\nscaredy cats tread lightly. They're the ones with true valor; which Webster's defines\n\nas strength of mind or spirit that enables a person to encounter danger with\n\nfirmness; viz: personal bravery.\n\nFearless people haven't a clue what bravery is. They wade into life afraid of\n\nnothing. Fearless people have nerves of steel; whereas those who face life with\n\nbravery, courage, and valor possess a different kind of mettle. They don't have\n\nnerves of steel; instead: they have resolve.\n\nWell, Jacob was very nervous about meeting with his brother. His next adventure\n\nwould take all the courage, and the valor, and the bravery he could muster. The\n\nappearance of those angels must have gone a long way towards beefing up his\n\ndetermination to see it through.\n\n● Gen 32:3 . .When he saw them, Jacob said: This is God's camp. So he named\n\nthat place Mahanaim.\n\nSpirit beings exist in a sphere that's beyond the spectrum of visible light, so that\n\nJacob wouldn't have seen them without some sort of optical aid. (cf. 2Kings 6:17)\n\nThe word \"Mahanaim\" is from Machanayim (makh-an-ah'-yim) which means:\n\ndouble camp and/or two camps. One camp was Jacob's and the other was God's.\n\nMan and God, in friendly proximity, united in a common purpose. Too cool.\n\n● Gen 32:4 . . Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir,\n\nthe country of Edom,\n\nThe Hebrew word for \"messengers\" is the same word often translated angels. Since\n\nthat word has such wide application, some have proposed that Jacob dispatched the\n\nholy angels on ahead to meet with Esau for him. Well, I think that might be\n\nstretching the imagination just a little too far. Jacob was in charge of his own camp,\n\nnot God's, and there's no textual evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\nJacob had learned where Esau lived, and could have avoided contact with him if he\n\nwanted to. Esau's land was pretty far out of the way. His haunts were way down in\n\nSeir, a mountainous tract which runs along the eastern side of the Araba, once\n\noccupied by the ancient cave dwelling Horites.\n\nIf there's a map handy; the location is in between the southern end of the Dead\n\nSea and the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba. Jacob's destination was Shechem, in\n\nthe vicinity of modern day Nabulus, up in the West Bank about 80 miles northwest\n\nof the tip of the Red Sea; as the crow flies.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 32:5a . . and instructed them as follows: Thus shall you say to my lord Esau:\n\nThus says your servant Jacob:\n\nJacob instructed his servants to acknowledge Esau as Jacob's superior. It's true the\n\npatriarchy passed to Jacob, but he must have felt it was expedient to set that aside\n\nfor now and approach his brother from the standpoint of their natural birth rank.\n\nJacob never really desired to lord it over his brother, and there was certainly no\n\nreason to assert his patriarchal rank at this time[ most especially for the purpose of\n\nthis particular reunion; which was to make amends for past grievances and to set\n\nthe stage for Jacob's peaceable return to the neighborhood.\n\nThis show-down was a necessity. Jacob couldn't very well be looking over his\n\nshoulder all the time, wondering if Esau was around somewhere nearby drawing a\n\nbead on him. They had to get their differences smoothed out now before Jacob\n\nsettled his family in Canaan. And this meeting was going to be difficult enough\n\nwithout invoking the prerogatives of royalty. No; it was better that Jacob met with\n\nEsau as his younger brother, and then go from there and see what happens.\n\n● Gen 32:5b-6 . . I stayed with Laban and remained until now; I have acquired\n\ncattle, donkeys, sheep, and male and female slaves; and I send this message to my\n\nlord in the hope of gaining your favor.\n\nThe delegation's mission was merely to inform Esau that Jacob was back in town;\n\nand to make sure Esau knew that Jacob was not here for a fight. He was in fact\n\ninclined to seek Esau's good graces. Esau's initial reaction was probably an\n\ninstinctive posture of self defense. Since it was predicted that the younger would\n\nrule the older, it may have appeared to Esau that Jacob was returning from\n\nPaddan-aram with a large body of fighting men to claim the covenanted\n\nboundaries, and to subjugate Esau under patriarchal rule as predicted in Gen\n\n25:23.\n\n● Gen 32:7-9 . .The messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to your\n\nbrother Esau; he himself is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men\n\nwith him. Jacob was greatly frightened; in his anxiety, he divided the people with\n\nhim, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps, thinking: If Esau comes\n\nto the one camp and attacks it, the other camp may yet escape.\n\nJacob quite naturally jumped to the conclusion that Esau still sought his death.\n\nFrom all appearances, it sure looked that way. So he followed a typical caravan\n\ntactic of dividing his troupe so that if Esau should attack the lead group, the one\n\nfollowing would have a chance to escape while Esau was busy with the first. It\n\nwould have been wiser to take up positions and wait for Esau to come to Jacob. But\n\napparently, the local terrain wouldn't permit Jacob's assembly to scatter all over the\n\nplace and thereby make it difficult for Esau to attack everyone at once.\n\n● Gen 32:10 . .Then Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham and God of my father\n\nIsaac, O Lord, who said to me; Return to your native land and I will deal bountifully\n\nwith you!\n\nOne can't help but admire Jacob's praying style. It's so practical-- no bombast, no\n\npious rhetoric, no platitudes, no rote, and no siddur --just down to business, and\n\nright from the heart.\n\nBut what I really love most about his style is the appeal he makes to certain\n\npromises that God made to him. Jacob came to the point in his walk of faith where\n\nhe realized that if God planned to make good on those promises, then He has to\n\nkeep Jacob alive to do it; just like Abraham reasoned that God had to raise Isaac\n\nfrom the dead in order to keep the promises he made concerning him (cf. Heb\n\n11:17-19) promises which, in reality, made Jacob just as bullet proof as they had\n\nmade Abraham and Isaac.\n\n● Gen 32:11-13 . . I am unworthy of all the kindness that You have so steadfastly\n\nshown Your servant: with my staff alone I crossed this Jordan, and now I have\n\nbecome two camps. Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the\n\nhand of Esau; else, I fear, he may come and strike me down, mothers and children\n\nalike. Yet You have said; I will deal bountifully with you and make your offspring as\n\nthe sands of the sea, which are too numerous to count.\n\nJacob was given a promise, and he held God to it. It takes real spiritual fortitude to\n\ndo that. In court, we commonly make people take an oath to tell the truth and then\n\nhold them to their word. And we notarize our legal documents so they become\n\nbinding and carry some weight. So why don't we do the very same thing with God?\n\nWould He be insulted? No way! If only more people would hold God to his word like\n\nJacob did. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. As the writer of the book of\n\nHebrews said; reliance upon God's testimony provides one with encouragement,\n\nand an anchor for the soul. (Heb 6:16-19)\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 32:14a . . After spending the night there,\n\nNo one knows yet just exactly where Mahanaim was located. According to a\n\nJordanian tourism web site, it was north of the river W. Zarqa (N. Yaboq) up in\n\nsome elevated ground a few miles east of Deir Alla. If your map doesn't show Deir\n\nAlla; then from 'Amman Jordan look northward to the W. Zarqa river and follow it\n\nwest to its junction with the Jordan River. Deir 'Alla is about 3 or 4 miles northwest\n\nof the point where the W. Zarqa river meets the Jordan.\n\n● Gen 32:14b-16 . . he selected from what was at hand these presents for his\n\nbrother Esau: 200 she-goats and 20 he-goats; 200 ewes and 20 rams; 30 milch\n\ncamels with their colts; 40 cows and 10 bulls; 20 jenny donkeys and 10 jack\n\ndonkeys.\n\nThat's a total of 580 animals altogether. I don't know what each of those species\n\nare worth on the hoof at today's prices, but all combined; it has to be a heck of a\n\nlot of money. Especially for the camels. In Birqash Egypt, prices for camels vary\n\nfrom 100 to 1,200 US dollars. Jacob sent Esau 30 females with their calves. Even in\n\nthe median price range, that's about 16,500 US dollars worth of dromedaries.\n\nNOTE: Milch camels are the equivalent of dairy cows. Camel's milk is much more\n\nnutritious than that from a cow. It's lower in fat and lactose, and higher in\n\npotassium, iron and Vitamin C. It's normally drunk fresh, and the warm frothy\n\nliquid, heavy and sweet, is usually an acquired taste for the Western palate. Most\n\nSaudi Arabian camels are females reared for their milk in dairy herds.\n\n● Gen 32:17-21a . .These he put in the charge of his servants, drove by drove,\n\nand he told his servants: Go on ahead, and keep a distance between droves. He\n\ninstructed the one in front as follows: When my brother Esau meets you and asks\n\n\"Whose man are you? Where are you going? And whose [animals] are these ahead\n\nof you?\" you shall answer: Your servant Jacob's; they are a gift sent to my lord\n\nEsau; and [Jacob] himself is right behind us.\n\n. . . He gave similar instructions to the second one, and the third, and all the others\n\nwho followed the droves, namely: Thus and so shall you say to Esau when you\n\nreach him. And you shall add: And your servant Jacob himself is right behind us.\n\nSome people have proposed that Jacob's tactic was an evidence of a lack of faith in\n\nGod's providence. I don't accept that theory for one second! Here's a better way to\n\nlook at it.\n\nSupposing you were a university student with poor grades. So one night, in\n\ndesperation, you pray and ask God to help you pass the finals. After prayers, you\n\ngo to bed with all the confidence in the world that God will somehow pack all the\n\ninformation you need to pass the test into your brain cells while you're asleep. Next\n\nday you fail the test. You know why? Duh! You didn't prepare for it.\n\nWhen men praise the Lord in battle, they should also pass the ammunition; and\n\nwhen a farmer prays for a good crop, he should say amen with a hoe; and when\n\npeople pray for a safe trip to grandma's house, they should put gas in the tank and\n\ncheck the oil, the water, and the tires, and fasten all the seat belts.\n\nNever pray for success without taking some initiative to make all the sensible\n\npreparations in your power that are necessary to get it. If you do your part to the\n\nbest of your ability; the odds are in your favor that God will do His part too-- if He\n\nfeels like it. Please don't ever take God for granted; that's just plain bad manners.\n\n● Gen 32:21b . . For he reasoned: If I propitiate him with presents in advance, and\n\nthen face him, perhaps he will show me favor. And so the gift went on ahead, while\n\nhe remained in camp that night.\n\nThe phrase \"propitiate him\" is from kaphar (kaw-far') which means: to cover\n\n(specifically with bitumen); figuratively, to expiate or condone, to placate or cancel.\n\nThat is a very common word for atonement, and that is exactly what Jacob had in\n\nmind: to show his brother that he wished to reconcile their differences. (cf. 1John\n\n2:2)\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 32:22 . .That same night he arose, and taking his two wives, his two\n\nmaidservants, and his eleven children, he crossed the ford of the Jabbok.\n\nThe Jabbok is in the country of Jordan and is a very loopy stream. It's path traces\n\nout a huge fish hook beginning in the hills near Amman; then goes about 7½ miles\n\nnortheast to Az Zarqa. From there it goes about 6½ miles north to As Sukhnah,\n\nthen about 7¼ miles northwest; passing by Al Qunayyah. From there it goes sort of\n\nwest, drawing a pair of camel humps for about 10½ miles to a lake near Jarash.\n\nFrom there it goes dead west for about 11 miles before turning southwest for ten\n\nmiles to its junction with the Jordan River.\n\nI'm sure Jacob's decision was mostly a security measure. If he waited till daylight to\n\nget his family across, Esau might show up unexpected while they were crossing and\n\nhave the camp at a disadvantage. It was to Jacob's credit that he distanced himself\n\nfrom the women and children. If Esau and his men were coming for Jacob's blood,\n\nthe mothers and their children would very likely get hurt in the fracas if Jacob were\n\namong them.\n\n● Gen 32:23-24a . . After taking them across the stream, he sent across all his\n\npossessions. Jacob was left alone.\n\nAfter helping his family to cross over, Jacob took some help and returned to the\n\nother side to gather up all their stuff. He stayed while they went on back over with\n\neverything and underwent a very strange close encounter of a third kind.\n\n● Gen 32:24b . . And a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.\n\nThere's been some speculation regarding not only the identity of this man but also\n\nhis species. Hosea can help settle this.\n\n\"The Lord once indicted Judah, and punished Jacob for his conduct, requited him for\n\nhis deeds. In the womb he tried to supplant his brother; grown to manhood, he\n\nstrove with a divine being, he strove with an angel and prevailed-- the other had to\n\nweep and implore him. At Bethel [Jacob] would meet him, there to commune with\n\nhim.\" (Hos 12:3-5)\n\nThere can be no doubt who Jacob communed with at Bethel. Jacob met Jehovah\n\nthere on his way north when he left home. And he met Jehovah there again in\n\nBethel after returning.\n\nFAQ: Jesus said that no man has seen God at any time. So then how was this man\n\nJehovah?\n\nREPLY: I think we can safely assume the man wasn't God in His true form because\n\nJesus said God is spirit, which is non-material. Theologically, this kind of\n\nappearance is called a theophany. See also Ex 24:9-11, the 18th chapter of\n\nGenesis, and John 1:1-3 + John 1:14 for additional appearances of deity in human\n\nform.\n\nAnyway; this conflict shouldn't be construed as some sort of combat or an athletic\n\nevent. It wasn't that at all. When Jacob perceived that the man was divine, he\n\nclutched and hung on; refusing to let the man get away.\n\nWhen my boy was little, sometimes he would cling to my ankles like a little boa\n\nconstrictor and I would have to drag him around the room for a while before he'd\n\nlet go. Well, that's what Jacob did. No one since has ever been so dogged\n\ndetermined with God like that. I believe the man held back blessing Jacob for good\n\nreason: so Bible students could see just how much Jacob really valued spiritual\n\nthings. It's easy to see now why God wanted the patriarchy for him instead of his\n\nbrother Esau.\n\nFrom the little we know about Jacob, I'm guessing that the one thing he valued\n\nmost about God more than anything else was providence. We got a glimpse of that\n\nback in chapter 28 when Jacob said: \"If God will be with me and will keep me in\n\nthis way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, so that I\n\ncome again to my father's house in peace, then Jehovah shall be my God\"\n\nJuxtapose Jacob with Cain; the man who walked out on God. Well; not only did\n\nJacob not walk out on God, but he refused to let God walk out on him. Jacob was a\n\npretty amazing guy. Compare the doggedly lady at Matt 15:21-18 plus the\n\n\"persistence\" parables at Luke 11:5-10 and Luke 18:2-8.\n\nMany years prior to where we are now in Genesis, Jacob had a dream. He saw a3\n\nstaircase with Jehovah, as a man, standing at the top. At the time, Jacob just\n\ngawked in awe; but were he to have that same dream at this point in his life, Jacob\n\nwould have run up those stairs and tackled Jehovah before He could get away. The\n\nman coming back down from the north isn't the same man that ran away from\n\nhome. He's different.\n\n_\n\n.\n\n● Gen 32:25 . .When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he wrenched\n\nJacob's hip at its socket, so that the socket of his hip was strained as he wrestled\n\nwith him.\n\nIn spite of the injury, Jacob still hung on and refused to let go. The injury served a\n\npurpose. It wasn't to make Jacob let go; after all, the angel could just as easily\n\nbroken both of Jacob's arms. The injury served to handicap Jacob, and force him to\n\ndepend even more upon God's providence; and less upon himself.\n\n● Gen 32:26a . .Then he said: Let me go, for dawn is breaking.\n\nTime is of the essence for Jacob to get ready for his brother. Dawn wasn't a\n\nproblem for the man. His carriage wasn't going to turn back into a pumpkin or\n\nanything like that nor was he going to burn up in the sunlight like a vampire.\n\n● Gen 32:26b . . But he answered: I will not let you go, unless you bless me.\n\nJacob risked giving Esau an advantage by staying too long; but this is one guy not\n\nto squander an opportunity with God.\n\n● Gen 32:27a . . Said the other: What is your name?\n\nLike he didn't know already? Of course he knew it. But the man's question is a type\n\nof question we call leading. You could restate it like this: And what *strategic\n\npause* is your name?\n\n● Gen 32:27b . . He replied: Jacob.\n\nHis name was actually Ya'aqob (yah-ak-obe') which means: heel-catcher (i.e.\n\nsupplanter). But that is all over now. From this point on; it won't be necessary for\n\nJacob to supplant somebody in order to gain the advantage.\n\n● Gen 32:28a . . Said he: Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel\n\n\"Israel\" is from Yisra'el (yis-raw-ale') which means: he will rule as God. We might\n\ncall Jacob's new name his spiritual name and it's very curious. It doesn't mean rule\n\nlike God; but rather: in God's stead. (cf. Hag 2:23)\n\nNOTE: If we take Jacob's new name literally (I think we can) then what we're\n\nlooking at is 110% prophetic of a reality. (cf. Ps 110:1 and Ps 45:6-7)\n\nAlthough Jacob was a patriarch, and a great sheik, he was never a conqueror.\n\nThere's a huge difference between ruling as God and ruling as a conqueror.\n\nConquerors typically rule for their own profit, making slaves out of their subjects\n\nand exacting taxes and tributes. But God always rules for man's benefit; helping\n\nhim achieve his greatest potential from within a peaceful environment.\n\nThrough the ages, God has used Jacob's spiritual name to identify the nation that\n\nsprang from him. True, Jacob's progeny has not always ruled as God. But his\n\nultimate progeny, Messiah, certainly will. No question about it.\n\n\"In that day The Lord will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is\n\nfeeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like\n\nGod, like the angel of The Lord before them.\" (Zech 12:8)\n\n● Gen 32:28b . . for you have striven with beings divine and human, and have\n\nprevailed.\n\nThe Hebrew word for \"beings divine\" is a nondescript label for all manner of deities:\n\nthe true and the false, the real and the imagined, the genuine and the imitation,\n\nand the gold and the tin.\n\n● Gen 32:29a . .Then Jacob inquired, and he said: Divulge, if you please, your\n\nname. And he said: Why then do you inquire of my name?\n\nProbably by now Jacob suspected that this man was a theophany, but Jacob\n\nappears unaware that theophanies don't have individual names, viz: the name of\n\nevery theophany is the same, to wit: Yahweh, a.k.a. Jehovah. The one lone\n\nexception is Jesus (Matt 1:21 & Luke 1:31)\n\n● Gen 32:29b-30 . . and He blessed him there. So Jacob called the name of the\n\nplace Peniel-- For I have seen the Divine face to face, yet my life was spared.\n\nIt's true Jacob didn't actually see The Almighty God in His actual form; but what he\n\nsaw and touched was pretty close enough.\n\nNOTE: Theophanies are for mankind's sake. It's just too dangerous to be in the\n\npresence of the actual supreme of all that is. (Ex 33:20 & 1Tim 6:15-16)\n\n_"
