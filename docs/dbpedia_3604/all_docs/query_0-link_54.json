Aquintis and Ben are quick to start cracking jokes while Cameron and Jett let Erica know that they want to find true love in their own individual way. Jonell, Marteese and Tyzee tell Erica, each, a story about their past. Cameron and Taylor bond over having abusive exes (which are stories they both tell to Erica respectively) while Quentin and Terry bond over their dislike of the other guys. Darrell, Liam and Toby are, notably, quiet and don't engage with Erica (which Jett points out to them) while Isaac R., Jing and Qu'wan all bond and hope to all move forward in the competition together. It is notable that the most friendly people in this episode are Cameron, Jett and Taylor, which leads to Cameron receiving the First Impression Rose. At the rose ceremony, Aaron, Adam, Carson, Christopher, Darrell, Isaac W., Liam, Patrick, Qu'wan, Paul, Toby and Zuberi (a record total of 12) are all sent home.\n\n•EPISODE 2: Quentin is, notably, quiet around the house while Cameron and Marteese crack jokes.

At the rose ceremony, Jing and Quentin are sent home.\n\n•EPISODE 3: On Day 8, Erica surprises everybody by revealing that Aaron Foster and Qu'wan Hampton, who both went home on Day 1, are re-entering as she felt like, in hindsight, they deserved a spot more than the two who went home last night. While the other men understand at first, Aaron decides to sabotage the house (with a plan to get under everybody's skin so they would start fighting, go home and he would be the last one standing). He takes all of the food out of the fridge, places it everywhere, then hides the cushions of the couch and throws everybody's stuff out of their drawers while everybody is outside. However, Brodie comes in, notices, and tells everybody else what happened. They all come to the conclusion that Aaron did it as he was the only one NOT outside and it becomes Aquintis, Ben, Brodie, Marteese, Qu'wan, and Tyzee versus Aaron with Qu'wan, especially, upset as Erica gave him and Aaron second chances. At the group date (Aaron, Aquintis, Isaac, Jett, Jonell, Marteese and Qu'wan), all but Aaron tell Erica some personal stories about their lives while Aaron tries to hint at Erica that he is horny. Erica is not impressed. As the group date continues, Aquintis, Isaac, Jonell and Qu'wan all tell Erica about what Aaron did.

They, later, get really drunk and make people laugh. however, their shenanigans annoy Cameron and Qu'wan. Later, when Erica is at the house for the evening, Aquintis tells her a personal story ... but then tries to take her from the other men throughout the evening, leading to a confrontation between Aquintis vs Jett and Marteese. Aquintis argues that it is a competition and he will do what it takes to win over her heart and he wouldn't share her outside of the show either. Cameron, later, makes fake roasts about everybody while they are drinking but takes the joke towards Brodie and Taylor a bit too far. He refuses to apologize and states that his were more harsh as they are the fakest people in the house. In a private chat, Erica is wondering where this side of Cameron is coming from. Cameron states that he is super frustrated with the amount of ass kissing going on, especially from Aquintis, Brodie and Taylor. For the group date, Erica invites Brodie, Cameron, Jett and Qu'wan. Cameron's constant shit talk starts to annoy Erica and she feels like it isn't going to work with him and sends him home. As the date goes on, Brodie and Jett share personal stories (Brodie coming out as bisexual and Jett not getting along with his siblings respectively) while Qu'wan admits that he is more focused on the house drama than her at the moment, which shocks Erica.

Back at the mansion, Jonell, Taylor and Tyzee start engaging in arguments about the tiniest things with all three of them even admitting that they don't like each-other and find each-other annoying. Isaac, however, is worried how Erica thinks of him but doesn't share this with anybody. At the rose ceremony, Jonell is sent home with Erica saying that she sees them as friends and she hopes he can find somebody much better for him compared to his ex. They hug and he leaves.\n\n•EPISODE 6: Jett and Tyzee start to disagree on things around the house, including each-other's behaviour but the others feel like they just see each-other as their biggest competition, which they both, privately, confess to. Everybody is split into two group dates (Aquintis, Brodie and Isaac are Group 1 while Jett, Marteese, Taylor and Tyzee are Group 2). Isaac shares a story about his struggles with his parents' fighting growing up, Marteese shares a funny story about how he found out he was bisexual during a trip to Ireland and Aquintis shares a story about growing up in a racist neighbourhood.

Marteese gets the first (of 3) one-on-one dates. He makes her laugh and smile with his travel stories to Greece and France. Aquintis gets the second (of three) one-on-one dates. However, they both admit that they aren't feeling anything towards each-other and he is sent home. Jett gets the third and final one-on-one date. He opens up his struggles in high school. The next day, Erica shows up to spend time with all five guys. Brodie and Isaac really make her laugh. At the rose ceremony, she sends Tyzee home, saying that his feelings towards Jett and how he has acted are not what she is looking for in a guy.\n\n•EPISODE 8: It is time for the family visits. All four go well! Yay! Back at the mansion, Isaac shares another story about himself while Brodie makes her laugh. Erica is so conflicted over who should go that she decides that nobody will go home at the rose ceremony.\n\n•EPISODE 9: With Marteese's humour and Jett's heartwarming personal stories winning over Erica's hearts, Brodie Sharpe and Isaac Rich are sent home in a very heartbreaking rose ceremony."
