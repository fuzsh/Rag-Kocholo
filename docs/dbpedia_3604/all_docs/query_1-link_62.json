First and foremost I would like to express my sincere thanks to my good friends at the board of the Graduate Society Foundation ( Jame eh-ye Daneshvaran) of Los Angeles. As part of their commitment to research, documentation and publication related to the history and cultural heritage of Iranian Jewry, they provided me with a generous grant which assisted me in collecting and studying the sources that are being presented here to the reader. I was fortunate to enjoy their trust and support at every stage of the preparation and publication of this work. A large number of archives, libraries and research institutes in the U.S.A., Europe, Israel and elsewhere kindly provided me with access to their collections and resources. While I wish to thank each and every one of them, I regard it as a particular debt as well as a pleasant duty to express my appreciation to the relevant officials and librarians at the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Union Theological Seminary, and Columbia University’s Department of Rare Books and Collections, in New York; Archives of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, Paris; Manuscripts Department of University College, London; Special Collections and Manuscripts of Bodleian Library, University of Oxford; Library and Archival Collection of the Ben-Zvi Institute, and the Manuscripts Department of the Jewish National and University Library, in Jerusalem. I want to thank Mr. Azaria Levy, scholar of Jewish communities of Iran, who kindly permitted me to include in this book my translated and annotated version of his Hebrew article on the Jewish Community of Yazd in the Nineteenth Century (the article, which appeared originally in the Hebrew journal Ma alot, year 13, September 1981, pp. 31–40, is reproduced and discussed as source no. 27 in our book, below). Ms. Mohtaram Joseph (Shams) of Los Angeles kindly allowed me access to her family collection of Judeo-Persian manuscripts and drew my attention to a rare document on the effects of the Great Famine of 1871–2 in the Jewish community of Kashan (presented and discussed below as source no. 30).\n\nxiv\n\nacknowledgments\n\nI would further like to express my appreciation to several colleagues and friends who read parts or the entire text of the book and shared with me their thoughts and comments. Special thanks are due to Professor David S. Katz, Department of History, Tel-Aviv University, who reviewed the draft of this work and recommended that it be accepted for publication by Brill of Leiden, the Netherlands. My friend and colleague Professor David Menashri, Director of the Center for Iranian Studies at Tel-Aviv University, read the manuscript and made valuable suggestions with respect to its final form and content. Ms. Rachel Kantz, a colleague and research fellow at the Center for Iranian Studies at Tel-Aviv University, did not spare time and skillfully helped preparing the manuscript for publication. The present work naturally makes use of the contributions of a long list of researchers and authors whose scholarship, progressively ever since the 1820’s, form the foundations of our knowledge and understanding with regard to diverse aspects of history, community, religion and culture of Iranian Jews. Leading and most distinguished among the scholars of Iranian Jewry over the last four decades was the late Professor Amnon Netzer of the Department of Iranian Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The passing away of this remarkable individual and scholar in February 2008 is deeply felt and lamented by many of his colleagues, students and friends. My own indebtedness to Professor Netzer’s scholarship and insights is duly reflected and acknowledged in the different sections and pages of this book. Sadly, my wish, that the present book would one day be presented to him as a token of my gratitude and profound affection for him, will remain unfulfilled. Last but not least, I want to thank my wife, Judith Moss Yeroushalmi. Her unfailing support and her genuine interest and investment in the book turned the entire process of research, writing and publication of the book into a gratifying experience.

Diacritical marks are omitted. The silent h in Arabic is represented by a while in Persian it is ordinarily represented by a and sometimes by ah. In the Hebrew translation, too, preference has been given to simplicity. As such, diacritical marks have also been omitted. For famous places, proper names and terms, the common English forms are used, while less familiar ones are transliterated. Dates in Islamic lunar (Qamari ) calendar are indicated by Q. Those with no lunar signifier are in the Persian solar (Shamsi ) calendar. All Islamic and Hebrew dates, however, are given with their Christian (Gregorian) equivalents. Iran and Iranian are used instead of Persia and Persian.

Sources and Issues Related to the Study of Iranian Jews in the Nineteenth Century Both on a symbolic level as well as in practical terms, the launching of the first Alliance school in the Jewish quarter of Tehran on February 22, 1898 marks a major turning point in the history of Iranian Jews in recent generations. In light of the considerable importance and high hopes that the Chief Rabbi and the heads of the community in the capital city attached to the establishment of this first new school under European Jewish protection, the occasion was set and celebrated deliberately on the first day of the Jewish festive month of Adar (the month of the Purim festivities and merrymaking) in the Hebrew year of 5658.1 The latter school, initially for boys and later on also for girls, was soon followed by the establishment of similar modern-oriented and primarily secular schools under the directorship and patronage of the Alliance Israélite Universelle Organization of France. Thus, Alliance schools were soon founded in Iran’s other larger Jewish communities, among them those in the cities of Hamadan (in 1900), Isfahan (in 1901), Shiraz (in 1903), Sanandaj (in 1903), and Kermanshah (in 1904). In the course of the following years, prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, additional schools were founded, with the active financial and administrative support and supervision of the Alliance, also in the smaller communities in the towns and cities of Tuyserkan and Nahavand (in 1906), Kashan (in 1911) and Gulpaygan (in 1914).2\n\n1 For an eyewitness description of this occasion, see the report of the Persian Jew turned-Christian missionary Mirza Nurullah Hakim, who during this time conducted welfare and evangelistic activities in the Jewish quarter of Tehran, in JMI, July 1898, pp. 107–108. Additional and more detailed and informative reports on the official inauguration of this first Alliance school on April 15, 1898 in Tehran, as well as reports on the activity of the Alliance emissaries in Tehran and in some of the other Jewish communities of Iran during this year are found in BAIU, Deuxième Serie, No. 23, 1er et 2e semestres 1898, pp. 63–71, and in BMAIU, No. 11, Novembre 1898, pp. 194–195. 2 Cf.

The increasingly rapid pace of the legal, social, economic and religio-cultural reforms and changes under the Pahlavi regime (1925–1979) were particularly felt in Iran’s larger cities and towns where the large majority of Iran’s Jewish citizens lived. The latter forces and developments during more than five decades of a secular, Western-oriented and nationalistic Iranian monarchy transformed beyond recognition most (if not all) aspects and patterns of individual and collective lives that had formed over centuries and characterized the lives of Iranian Jews ever since Iran’s Arab-Islamic conquest (in the mid-7th century) and particularly ever since the establishment of the Safavid state in 1501. Among the observers and students of Iranian Jewish history in the 19th–20th centuries there is a common tendency to regard the establishment of the Alliance schools at the turn of the 19th century and onward as the beginning of the “new” or “modern” era in the lives of Iran’s Jewish minority3. Unfortunately, however, no attempt has so far been made to examine and clarify critically the validity and suitability of terms and notions such as “modern,” and “modern era,” as well as “new,” “Western,” “traditional,” “Oriental,” etc., as tools of research and means of historical periodization and analysis required for a better understanding of Iran’s Jewish communities and settlements in the course of the last two centuries. Moreover, in the available body of studies and publications that deal with the history and heritage of\n\n3 See, e.g., Ezra Sion Melammed “Ha-Yehudim be-Faras lifney Shishim Shanah,” [The Jews in Persia Sixty Years Ago], Sinai, year 14, vol. 29, issue 7–8, Jerusalem, 1951, pp. 364–365; Hanina Mizrahi, “Minhagim u-Masorot,” [Customs and Traditions], in Edoth, 3 (1947–8), numbers 1–2, pp. 88–89; Habib Levi, Tarikh-i Yahud-i Iran, 3 vols., Tehran, 1334–1339/1956–1960, vol. 3, pp. 776–782, and more recently, A.

The latter historical conditions and developments, chief among them the increasing exposure of Qajar Iran to the agents and forces of Western and European influence and penetration on the one hand and the growing contacts and relations between the Jews of Iran and their coreligionists in Western Europe and in the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the nineteenth century on the other hand, led, albeit gradually, to the infusion of Western-oriented notions and ideas into the social, religious and cultural outlook of community heads, rabbis and the wealthier strata of the Jewish population who lived in Iran’s larger urban communities. Reinforced by the growing political, economic and cultural contacts between Iran and the diverse agents and channels of European and Western influence in Iran, the latter forces and ideas in Iran’s larger Jewish communities during the 1820s–1890s led, among other results, to the early educational, social and occupational reform in Iran’s larger communities during the 1900s–1910s and onward.4 Moreover, while the increasing exposure and weakness of the Qajar state vis-à-vis the strategic, military, and technological threats and challenges of the European (chiefly British and Russian) powers contained within them the seeds of diverse pressures, dislocations and upheavals for Iran’s general population, the growing political, diplomatic and economic presence of Western and European states in 19th century Iran provided the Jews of Iran with opportunities to seek foreign-European and particularly Jewish-European support and protection. For the Jewish communities and settlements of 19th century Iran, which due to a variety of historical and local conditions (among them vast geographical distances, scarcity of paved and secure roads, and the nature of pre-modern means of communication and transportation) were highly scattered and maintained little connections with each other and with the outside world, the formation and subsequent growth of contacts with European 4 For a preliminary discussion of some of the better known agents and channels of Western influence among the heads of the larger Jewish communities in 19th century Iran, see my article “ Al Amadot u-Teguvot shel Rabbanim ve-Rashey Qahal be-Iran kelapey ha-Hashpa ah ha-Ma aravit ba-Me ah ha-19,” [On Positions and Responses of Rabbis and Communal Leaders in Iran toward the Western Influence in the 19th Century], forthcoming in the collection The Jews of Iran, eds.

Furthermore, all the available sources of information reveal that the goal and motivation of Iranian Jews to seek foreign support and protection in the course of the 19th century derived first and foremost from their profound sense of helplessness and with a view to confront or mitigate a host of existential hardships, physical insecurities and entrenched legal, social and occupational discriminations and disabilities. The latter plights and hazards were for the most part rooted in the long-established status of Jews as an unequal, inferior and widely despised religious minority within Iran’s Shi ite-dominated state, society and general culture. Despite the considerable importance of the 19th century as an interim period of continuity as well as a century of gradual and continuous change in the lives of Iranian Jews, however, most areas of the general history, culture and communal lives of Iranian Jews in the 19th century still await systematic research, data collection and balanced and unbiased examination. Yet, the study of Iranian Jews in the 19th century in the broader context of Iranian history on the one hand and in the context of their emerging relations with the foreign powers and with the Jews outside Iran on the other hand confronts the researcher with many objective limitations as well as subjective tests and challenges. While the choice of specific areas and topics that have to do with the lives of Iranian Jews during this period results ultimately from the researcher’s own choice and deliberation, there exist numerous objective and serious difficulties that are independent of the researcher’s individual approach, method or level of scholarship. Broadly speaking, the objective difficulties and obstacles that stand on the way towards a well-informed and balanced study of Iranian Jews in the 19th century (and earlier) belong to three separate, though closely related, areas. The first, and by far the most serious and consequential among these, lies in the relative scantiness of primary sources in the various relevant languages. In this regard, the observation made some four decades ago by the late Itzhak Ben-Zvi, the scholar of Jewish communities in the East, is still valid. In his words, which were written in connection with the comparative state of research and source materials relevant to the recent history of the Jewish communities in the Muslim countries of the Middle East and North Africa:\n\nintroduction and background\n\nxxiii\n\nOur scanty knowledge about the lives of the Jews in Iran requires us to dig deeply into the sources and rely on the kind of information which had they been from other communities it is doubtful whether we would attach to them importance. The scarcity of the material turns every piece of information and every detail about the Jews of Iran into something valuable to their history, and thus we are commanded to consider most carefully any such information, of which even a tiny bit can teach us a lot about this Jewry.5\n\nSecond, and hand in hand with the limited body of available primary and authentic sources, the student of the 18th and 19th century Iranian Jewry is faced with a very limited body of scholarly and solid research and publications related to the various aspects of Jewish life and history in Iran during this period. Although the studies and publications that have been conducted over the last six or seven decades (in European languages, in Persian and mainly in Hebrew) have added much to our knowledge and understanding with regard to various aspects of social, communal, material as well as cultural and religious lives in Iran’s highly scattered Jewish communities, nevertheless many fundamental and in some cases the most elementary aspects and patterns of Jewish life in 19th century Iran have received no comprehensive treatment whatsoever.6 These areas and disciplines, which in the case of the Jewish communities of North Africa, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and the Ottoman Empire have formed the subjects of far more extensive and systematic studies, include the areas of demography (including emigration and migration), economic and material lives, social institutions and communal organization, education, relations with Iran’s I.

Among the scholars and researchers of Iranian Jewry who have contributed to the documentation and investigation of the history of Iranian Jews in the 19th century, mention should be made particularly (according to the chronological order in which their work appeared) of the late Professor Walter J. Fischel, Itzhak (Isaac) Ben-Zvi, Professor Ezra Sion Melammed, Mr. Hanina Mizrahi, Dr. Habib Levi, and Professor Amnon Netzer, and may they long live, Mr. Azaria Levy, Dr. Avraham Cohen, Dr. Giora Fuzailov, Ms. Haideh Sahim and Dr. Daniel Tsadik.

The absence of solid and systematic groundwork in these and other closely related areas and topics severely impedes the knowledge and the perspective required for a balanced understanding of Iranian Jews and the conditions and forces that shaped their lives in the course of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century. The third major obstacle that still restricts our ability to form a clear and coherent picture of Iranian Jewry in the course of the 19th century lies in the disjointed and highly scattered nature of the available sources of information. The latter sources of information and data are highly fragmented and found in small, incomplete and out of context fashion in hundreds if not thousands of diverse and mostly unrelated primary and secondary sources and documents. Broadly speaking, these sources and scattered references consist of: 1. Reports and writings of European (mainly British and French) consuls, agents and diplomatic officials. 2. Accounts and reports of Christian missionaries who conducted missionary and related welfare activities among the Jews of Iran during the 1820s–1910s. 3. Travel-books, memoirs and accounts of European (and some Middle Eastern) travelers, professionals and scholars, who traveled or lived and worked in Iran. 4. Reports and articles on the Jews of Iran in the growing body of 19th century Jewish press of Europe, North America and the Ottoman Empire, as well as in the publications of Jewish communal and cultural associations, mostly those based in Europe, and published in Hebrew and in the main languages of Europe. 5. Accounts and testimonies of Jewish religious emissaries (in Hebrew shadarim, literally, emissaries on behalf of rabbis), who were sent by rabbis and institutions of charity and religious learning in Ottoman Palestine in order to collect donations and provide religious\n\nintroduction and background\n\nxxv\n\nservices in the Jewish communities scattered in Iran and in the region. 6. Historical sources, documents and writings produced by the Qajar state and administration as well as by some educated members of the Iranian state and society, including the writings of some of the members of the Shi ite clerical establishment. 7. Last but not least, sources, writings and records (both private as well as family and community related) in Judeo-Persian, Hebrew and Persian, left to us by the Iranian Jews who lived in the different communities across Iran. Two broad observations should be made with respect to this rather large and for the most part dispersed and incongruous body of 19th century historical sources of information. First, they can be divided into those that were produced by the Iranian Jews themselves (in Judeo-Persian, Hebrew and Persian), and those that were produced, recorded or transmitted by other individuals, among them non-Jewish Iranians, Middle Eastern and Ottoman subjects and officials, and particularly European and Western (both Jewish and non-Jewish) individuals, professionals and officials. The second observation that emerges from an overview of this diverse and variegated historical material is that both the quantity and the informative value and accuracy of the material grow steadily and increasingly during the second half of the 19th century and onward. The bulk of the European sources related to the Jews and the Jewish communities of Iran in the 19th century (particularly those belonging to the British Foreign Office and to the Jewish organizations and publications of Britain, France and Germany) reflect and document in detail the formation and the continuous growth of contacts and relations between the Iranian Jews and diverse European subjects, officials and organizations during the last four decades of the 19th century. More importantly, the examination of the available material, including the large body of Judeo-Persian manuscripts that were produced and mostly copied in the course of the 19th century, reveals that both because of centuries-old practices as well as by consequence of stagnation and gradual decline in the general condition of Iran’s Jewish communities in the course of the 17th–19th centuries, most of the day-to-day and customary religious and communal activities and functions in the various communities were not recorded. The regrettable absence of this kind of religious, communal, legal and personal records, chief among them community registers and records, deliberations and decisions of\n\nxxvi\n\nintroduction and background\n\nrabbinic courts, as well as works and writings of rabbis, judges, communal functionaries and educated individuals in the various communities, deprives us of a most valuable body of firsthand and authentic source material for the study of Iran’s Jewish communities in the course of the 18th–19th centuries and earlier. The rather poor and limited character of the historical sources and documents left to us by Iranian Jews is further aggravated by the lack of any known chronicles or semi-historical writings relating to any given community or geographical area. So far, the students, researchers and bibliographers in the field have not come across any works (including personal diaries or periodic recordings) which provide a descriptive and chronological account of daily lives and events in any of Iran’s larger and smaller communities in the course of the 19th century. The absence of such sources and documents is far more evident and consequential in the case of the medium-sized and smaller communities and settlements, most of which were situated in the north-west, center and southern regions and provinces of Iran. Thus, for example, in the communities of Salmas and Mianduab, both in Western Azarbaijan; Garrus and Saqqez, in Iranian Kurdistan; Nahvand, in the province of Hamadan; Gulpaygan, Khunsar and Borujerd, in Eraq-e Ajam, or central Iran, and Zarqan, Jahrom, and Firuzabad, in Fars, and in a dozen of other similar communities, there lived an average of 200 to 300 souls during the 3rd quarter of the 19th century. According to all the available evidence, the communal organization and the number of communal bodies and functions in these and in many other similar Jewish settlements across Iran were very meager. Moreover, the vast majority of the routine religious, communal and interpersonal activities and transactions in these and in many of the larger urban communities were conducted only in an oral fashion. As a result of the latter conditions and practices, the amount of documents and written records produced by the heads and literate members of those communities was accordingly very limited. It is worth noting that of Iran’s estimated Jewish population of some 20 to 25 thousand souls in the mid 19th century and some 40–45 thousand during the turn of that century, an estimated 30 to 35% lived in the latter category of medium-sized and smaller communities in towns and provincial districts.7\n\n7 For the estimated make-up of Iran’s Jewish population during the second half of the 19th century and the relative share of those who lived in the country’s larger cities,\n\nintroduction and background\n\nxxvii\n\nThe communal and socio-cultural factors and shortcomings that account for the limited volume of source material in the medium-sized communities seem to have affected much more the situation in the smaller settlements in the remote provincial and rural districts, and particularly those that were situated in Western Azarbaijan, Iranian Kurdistan and in the southern province of Fars. In many of the latter settlements we learn of 15–20 Jewish families, and at times as few as 5–10 individuals, living in the midst or by side of the local Muslim population throughout the 19th century. The amount of historical sources and documents produced in the latter small settlements throughout the 19th century and earlier appear to have been minimal and thus whatever information and knowledge we possess about the lots and living conditions of the Jews in them is extremely limited and relies mostly on hearsay or on partial and incidental testimonies provided by outside visitors and travelers. Finally, because of a variety of events, upheavals and hardships that affected or disrupted the lives of the various communities, among them attacks and pogroms perpetrated against some of the communities, partial or total destruction and disappearance of some other communities and settlements, periods of famine, epidemics and other natural disasters, and particularly because of the continuous occurrences and conditions of internal migration as well as emigration to other countries and territories throughout the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century, (as a result of the latter occurrences and conditions) whatever written records and documents were in the possession of those communities and their members suffered from various degrees of damage, neglect or loss. According to all indications, a significant, though unknown, portion of these Judeo-Persian, Hebrew and some Persian historical sources and documents have either perished, or else kept as memorable sentimental items by community and family members. Some others are known (or assumed) to be in the possession of private collectors, brokers and antique dealers. These facts further deprive us of some of the firsthand body of evidence which would otherwise increase our knowledge and understanding with respect to diverse aspects of history, society, religion and culture in those little known communities and settlements.\n\ntowns and provincial and rural settlements, see in our book, below, sources no. 10, 11, and 12.\n\nxxviii\n\nintroduction and background 2. General Background\n\nWithin the broader context of Jewish history in Iran ever since Iran’s Arab-Muslim conquest in the mid-seventh century C.E., the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century represent a particularly bleak and trouble-ridden period. Indeed, contrary to the observation made by some scholars of Iranian history,8 the available body of evidence and the research conducted so far demonstrate that some broad processes of marginalization, isolation and demographic decline had shaped and determined the lives of Iranian Jews ever since the 16th and 17th centuries. Hand in hand with other historical forces and conditions, which were related to Iran’s internal bloody wars and chaotic affairs and to its external relations and increasingly diminished regional position in the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the latter processes and forces of isolation and repression reached their peak and exercised their full negative effect on Iran’s Jewish communities and settlements during the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries. Furthermore, the processes and forces of social and occupational marginalization and religio-cultural decline, which had been set in motion particularly with the advent of the Safavid dynasty in 1501 (see below), did not reach their final and clear end in the course of the 19th century. Neither did most years and decades of the 19th century constitute a consistent and uninterrupted course of improvement and strengthening in the overall position, security and welfare of Iran’s Jewish minority. Different forms and varying degrees of individual and communal plights and distresses, among them entrenched civil and legal inequalities and discriminations and a host of religious, social, occupational and cultural restrictions and disabilities in the course of the 18th and most years of the following century were among the everyday conditions under which the vast\n\n8 See, e.g., Professor Hamid Algar’s assertion in his “Religious Forces in Eighteenthand Nineteenth-Century Iran,” in Cambridge History of Iran, vol. VII, ed. P. Avery et al., Cambridge 1991, p. 731: “Jews and Zoroastrians also benefited from an outside interest in their welfare. The Alliance Israélite Universelle constructed schools for the Jews in Tehran, Hamadān and elsewhere, and despite losses to both Baha ism and Christianity, the Jewish community of Iran strengthened its position throughout the 19th century.” On the establishment of Alliance schools, the first of which was founded only in the spring of 1898, see in our book, above.

Forming an era of transition in the history of the Middle East at large and in the internal and external affairs of Iran, however, the decades of the 19th century also served as a bridge between the old and the new. These were indeed years in which long-established institutions, traditions and practices which had evolved over centuries and had shaped and governed the lives of Iran’s Jewish minority were coming into increasing contact with new and hitherto unknown sources of influence. These new forces, whose main origins derived from Iran’s growing exposure to the physical presence as well as the economic and cultural penetration and dominance of European and Western Powers and their affiliated agencies in Iran and the region, were bound to affect and in the long run erode, reshape or completely eliminate many of the old traditions, institutions and practices which had characterized the lives of the Iranian Jews over many centuries. As a meeting ground for diverse historical, socio-cultural and material forces and developments in the history of Iranian Jews, the course of the 19th century provides the researcher and the interested reader with a unique and stimulating area of research and investigation. The study of diverse, though closely related aspects of life and activity among the Jews of Iran in the course of the 19th century does not merely clarify the circumstances and the historical dynamics that ultimately transformed them from a fundamentally oppressed, marginalized and threatened minority (particularly in the course of the 17th–19th centuries) into an increasingly active, enterprising and resourceful segment of the Iranian state, economy and society (particularly as of the beginning of the 20th century and the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–6). The study of Iran’s Jewish communities and settlements in the organic context of Iran’s local conditions and developments in the course of the 19th century and in the broader context of their growing contacts and relations with the Western Powers and with their coreligionists abroad, equally shed light on some of the dominant characteristics and patterns of individual and communal lives among the Iranian Jews prior to their rapid modernization in the course of the 20th century. Within the longer continuum of Jewish life in Iran ever since the advent of Islam, however, the period that proves to have been by far more important and historically consequential with regard to the overall condition of Iranian Jews in the course of the 18th–19th centuries was\n\nxxx\n\nintroduction and background\n\nthe Safavid period (1501–1736).9 The latter dynastic era introduced and consolidated a lasting revolution in the lives of Iran’s vast population, divided along numerous ethnic, linguistic, religious and factional lines. It also laid the foundations for a new socio-religious order that had direct and for the most part detrimental effect on the legal position as well as the general condition of Iran’s religious minorities in the course of the 16th–19th centuries.10 The kings and the leading figures of the Safavid monarchy, chief among them the founder of the dynasty Shah Isma il (r. 1501. 1524) and the competent and powerful monarch Shah Abbas the Great (r. 1588–1629), brought about the establishment and consolidation of a strong and proud Persian-Islamic monarchy for the first time ever since the downfall of Iran’s pre-Islamic Sasanian Empire (222–632) and the subsequent annexation of its vast territories and populations to the Arab-Islamic Caliphate in the mid-7th century. As a central component of their dynastic identity and ideology, however, the Safavid monarchs introduced and energetically enforced the Shi ite Twelver (Ar. Ithna Ashari) or Imami Creed as the state religion of Iran. The introduction and progressive spread and consolidation of the Imami Shi ite dogma and traditions, which upheld the spiritual authority and infallibility of the fourth Islamic Caliph Ali11 and his eleven descendants (or Imams) as the sole rightful successors of the Prophet Muhammad, provided Iran’s majority Shi ite population with 9 For a general discussion of the Safavid dynasty and its role in Iranian history, see, among other sources and publications, R.

The same features of the Safavid state and institutions, however, contained within them the seeds of what were to become (particularly during the 18th and 19th centuries) growing exclusion, segregation and ill-treatment of non-Shi ites (including Sunni Muslims) within the diverse spheres and institutions of the Iranian state, society, economy and general culture.12 The latter discriminatory and increasingly negative and hostile attitudes towards non-Shi ites (i.e. attitudes and notions that were embraced and promoted by the Safavid theocratic state and its affiliated clerical, administrative, military and public arms) struck roots in the course of the 16th–17th centuries and became internalized and widespread among broad sections and institutions of the Iranian state and society in the course of the 18th and 19th centuries.13 The fundamentally negative and discriminatory notions, laws, and practices concerning the non-Shi ites were to have harsh and debilitating effects on the overall standing and welfare of most of the religious minorities in Iran already in the course of the 16th–17th centuries and particularly ever since the demise of the Safavid monarchy following Iran’s invasion by Afghan tribes in 1722.14 Indeed, ever since the establishment of the Safavid state, and much through the end of the 19th century, the overall condition, security and welfare of Iran’s religious minorities depended largely on the relative ability and resources of each of them to withstand or invariably repel, mitigate or manipulate the lasting effects of the profound socio-religious and institutional revolution that had been introduced by the founders of the Safavid state.

Out of Iran’s three major groups of recognized religious minorities during the period under discussion, i.e. Christians of various denominations, and mainly Armenians and Nestorians, Jews, and Zoroastrians, it was the Christians, and particularly the Armenians, who due to a variety of political, regional and commercial factors enjoyed the protection and support of various powerful Christian states and their commercial and religious establishments both inside Iran and outside its borders.15 Lacking any tangible political, economic and military leverage inside Iran, and deprived of any significant foreign connections and relations with European and regional states and governments through the first decades of the 19th century, Iran’s Jewish and Zoroastrian minorities were as a rule less protected and considerably weaker.16 As such, they were subjected to a host of physical pressures and insecurities as well as numerous legal and socio-economic restrictions and disabilities which were imposed on them within the dominant Iranian-Shi ite state and society in the course of the 16th–19th centuries. As far as Iran’s nonShi ite population in general and its religious minorities ever since the rise of the Safavid dynasty are concerned, by far the most debilitating element in the general approach of the Imami Shi ite law consisted of the notion that non-Shi ites (including the followers of the monotheistic religions) were inherently and ritually impure.

In the words of the eminent scholar of Jewish communities of the East, the late Professor Walter J. Fischel, who among his many studies devoted to the Jews of Iran also investigated the general position of Iranian Jews following the establishment of the Safavid state: The Safavid rulers introduced into Persia Shi a Islam as a state religion and allowed a hierarchy of clergy to rule with almost unlimited power and influence over every sphere of public life. The cornerstone of the inter-confessional relationship towards the non-Muslims was based on the concept of the ritual uncleanliness of Jews, Christians and others alike.17\n\nFurthermore, in Professor Fischel’s historical assessment, which was written some seven decades ago and which is largely supported by the various sources and studies that are available to us now: Even though the promulgation of the Shi ite religion by the Safavid monarch Shah Isma il was first and foremost a political act that was directed at the Ottoman Empire, which adhered to the Sunni branch of Islam, it changed the attitude of the state towards its religious minorities, and in the course of time it led to a special Shi ite concept in the arrangement of the inter-religious relations. This concept, which regarded the unbelievers as ritually impure, determined the fate of the Jews of Iran until this day. Just as the declaration of Islam as the state religion [of Iran] following the fall of the Sasanian dynasty in the 7th century C.E. determined the fate of the Jewish population in the land, so did the declaration of the Shi ite Islam as [Iran’s] state religion in the 16th century inaugurated a new era in the history of the Jewish diaspora in Iran.18\n\nThe introduction and gradual consolidation of the Imami Shi ite tenets, which emphasized the categorical inferiority of the non-Shi ites and the potential physical and spiritual threat and harm that they presented to the community of Shi ite believers, constituted a significant departure from the old-established and generally more tolerant theological, legal and societal principles and concepts that had shaped the common\n\nW.J.

During the interim period that came between the Afghan invasion of 1722 and the rise of the Qajar dynasty in 1794, we know of two failed attempts by Iran’s contemporary rulers to change and ameliorate the lower position of Iran’s Jewish minority. The first of the two initiatives, both of which were a by-product and integral part of the internal power struggles in Iran following the fall of the Safavids, was initiated by the Sunni Afghan invader and ruler Ashraf (r. 1725–1730). A cousin and successor to the Afghan tribal leader Mahmud (r. 1722–1725), who invaded Iran in 1722 and spurred the fall of the Safavid dynasty, Ashraf was resolved to suppress and to downgrade Iran’s majority Shi ite population and thus indirectly promote the country’s Sunni and non-Shi ite population, and Jews among them. Thus, upon his succession to the throne in 1725, he issued a royal edict in which he ranked Iran’s various religious and ethnic groups. According to the latter decree, the first rank was assigned to the Afghans, the conquerors of Iran; the second to the Armenians; the third to a Sunni tribal ally of the Afghan invaders known as Dergesins; the fourth rank went to the Hindu Banians; the 19 The legal position and general standing of dhimmi or protected religious minorities in early Islamic history and in the Sunni-dominated states and societies in premodern times have been extensively treated.

Nadir Shah’s attitude towards the various religious groups of the empire, especially towards Christians and Jews, was as remarkable.24 Among his other actions in support of Iran’s Christians and Jews he went as far as settling a considerable number of Jews and Christians in the city of Mashhad, the holiest 20 See Judasz Tadeusz Krusinski, The History of the Late Revolutions of Persia: Taken from the Memoirs of Father Krusinski, trans. into English by Father Du Cerceau, 2 vols., 2nd ed., London 1740, vol. 2, pp. 196–198.

It was in this context that, shortly after his successful invasion of India in 1740, he commanded to translate into Persian the Hebrew Biblical books of the Pentateuch (Tawr at) and the Psalms (Zabur), as well as the Christian Gospels (Ingil ) and the holy Qur an.26 This interfaith project, which was carried out in Isfahan in close collaboration between Muslim, Jewish and Christian religious scholars and translators, began in May 1740 and was completed in June 1741.27 Nadir Shah’s religious positions at large and his generally more tolerant and supportive actions concerning Iran’s Jewish minority aroused high hopes among the Jews. Among other responses of Iranian Jews during this period we learn of messianic yearnings which Nadir Shah’s personal attention to rabbis and Jewish scholars of Isfahan, Kashan, Yazd and Qazvin had aroused. The extant Judeo-Persian manuscripts dating from this period, which contain the translated texts of the Biblical Psalms ordered by Nadir Shah as well as historical and biographical information related to rabbis who took part in this project, provide revealing evidence about the psychological condition of Iranian Jews during this period and the extent of hope and expectations that they attached to Nadir Shah’s supportive attitudes towards his Jewish subjects. In one of these manuscripts, which according to the information contained in it was copied in 1760 by one of the rabbis who was closely involved in the translation project, we read: Upon the completion of the translation, Nadir Shah presented the sages of Israel with robes of honor and gifts and, thereafter, he dismissed them.\n\n25 W.J.

He had sworn saying: ‘I will take Russia, I will rebuild Jerusalem, and I will gather all the Children of Israel together.’ However, death overtook him and did not allow him to do so.”29\n\nWith Nadir Shah’s assassination on June 20, 1747, his kingdom disintegrated. As far as the position and general state of Iran’s Jewish minority is concerned, neither the attempts of the Afghan invaders nor the ambitions of Nadir Shah at introducing a new socio-religious order in Iran met with any success. The implementation of such a profound revision in the political and socio-religious institutions of the post-Safavid state would possibly have affected or to some degree improved the official and actual position of Iran’s Jewish minority. However, the force and considerable tenacity of the Shi ite institutions, beliefs and practices, which had been promoted and strengthened by the Safavids, outweighed the constellation of personal ambitions and political interests of the Afghan invaders and particularly those of Nadir Shah to establish a new and more inclusive order. Shi ism had become firmly established as the religion of the majority in most of the provinces of Iran under the Safavids and thus the innovations of the Afghan invaders and the rite which Nadir Shah attempted to introduce had no widespread appeal and did not take root.30 This historical reality had major ramifications for diverse areas and aspects of life in Iran during the 18th century and onward. With its broader implications for Iran’s Shi ite majority population, it largely determined the position and lot of Iran’s religious minorities and Jews among them. Despite significant developments and changes which took place in Iran’s internal affairs and institutions in the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the fact remains that following the reign of Nadir Shah, and much through the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–6, the primary political traditions, religious institutions and social norms that constituted the foundations of the Iranian state, society and general culture in the course of the 18th–19th centuries, 28 Regarding this important clerical office among the other institutions of the Safavid state, see V. Minorsky, Tadhkirat al-Muluk, op. cit., pp. 41–42. 29 See in the introduction to the Judeo-Persian translation of the Hebrew Psalms, attributed to Baba i Ben Nuri el of Isfahan, in Ms. Heb. 8º 3068, in the possession of the Jewish National and University Library, Jerusalem, f. 4a–4b. 30 Z.

Despite significant differences discerned in the religious views and policies of dynasties and individual rulers that controlled Iran ever since the fall of Nadir Shah until the emergence of the Constitutional Movement towards the end of the 19th century, Iran’s rulers during the period accepted and endorsed the Shi ite religion and tradition as Iran’s state religion and as the principle source of the country’s collective identity and cohesion. This reality had major repercussions on Iran’s religious minorities at large and on the country’s extensively diffused and poorly- protected Jewish minority in particular. First, the legal and civil position of the Jews as well as the definition of their rights and obligations (which directly regulated and affected their daily lives within the Shi ite-Iranian state and society) derived predominantly from the codes and precedents of Imami Shi ite law and jurisprudence. The latter body of law, as well as the theological and doctrinal concepts that stood at its basis, had profound biases to the detriment of Iran’s non- Shi ite denominations.31 Second, as a result of the considerable weakness of the central government and administration during the second half of the 18th century and during most years and decades of the 19th century, the Iranian state was constrained in its ability and resources to provide physical and legal protection to Jews as well as to many other weak and disadvantaged segments of the general population. This state of affairs had harsh effects particularly on Jewish communities and settlements which were situated far away from the capital and from the administrative and military headquarters in the various provinces and districts. Not least, the combination of inadequate state protection and the growing spread and strength of popular Shi ite beliefs and practices concerning the non-Shi ites ever since the end of the 17th century32 exposed the\n\n31 See D.

Having defeated the other contestants for power in 1176 Q./1762, Karim Khan (r. 1750–1779) pacified most of western Iran, from the Caspian littoral and Azarbaijan in the north and northwest to Kirman and Lar to the south and southeast. He took up residence in Shiraz (in July 21, 1765) until his death on March 1, 1779.35 Karim Khan, the founder of the new Zand dynasty, refused to adopt the title of Shah and called himself “wakil al-ra aya,” or “representative of the people.”36 He did not attempt to recover the northeastern and eastern provinces of Iran, but devoted his efforts to providing security, reviving trade, agriculture and handicraft in the province of Fars and in western Iran.\n\n33 For detailed description of such acts of discrimination and persecution perpetrated against the Zoroastrians in the city of Kirman as late as 1888, see J.

However, as regards the state religion of Iran, upon which the broad legal, civil and societal definitions and attitudes concerning Iran’s religious minorities were based, Karim Khan endorsed the Twelver (Ithna Ashari) Shi a and thus established anew the unrevised Shi ism as Iran’s state religion. Each of the twelve districts of Shiraz, his seat of government, was held to be under the patronage of one of the Twelve Imams. Coins were struck in the names of the Imams and the Friday sermon (khutba) began with the invocations of blessings upon them.41 With the death of Karim Khan, in 1779, the Zand ruling family became torn by fierce and ruthless internal divisions and rivalries. Within a period of fifteen years, which ended with the ascent to power of a new tribal leader in 1794, the territories and provinces of the Zand state were ruled by no less than six different members of the Zand ruling clan.42 The relentless power struggles among the members of the dynasty, which involved repeated killings and other atrocities perpetrated against each other, were further accompanied by anarchy and ongoing battles between the rulers of the Zand dynasty and their tribal and factional allies on the one hand and the members of the ascending Qajar tribe\n\nK.

These wars and regional conflicts, similar to those which had preceded them during the Afghan invasion and the reign of Nadir Shah in the first half of the 18th century, had devastating effects on the lives of Iran’s settled population in many of the cities and rural areas across the country. The capital city of Shiraz as well as numerous towns and settlements in the north center and south of Iran (among them the larger cities of Hamadan, Qazvin, Isfahan, Yazd, Kirman and the smaller towns of Kazerun, Zarqan and others in the south), in which Jews and other religious minorities had continuously lived ever since the Safavid period and earlier, suffered from anarchy and lawlessness, periods of siege, hunger, massacre, looting and extensive damage to public and private property.43 As far as the overall condition of Iran’s Jewish communities and settlements during the reign of Karim Khan and his successors is concerned, lack of information and documentation as well as absence of research on the subject limit our ability to form a clear and balanced picture. Nevertheless, the partial and disjointed pieces of information and evidence point to diverse hardships, insecurities and persecutions to which the Jews in various locations in western and southern Iran were subjected. These hardships resulted in part from the general conditions of political instability, breakdown of public order and diverse material distresses and dislocations which equally affected the lives of Iran’s general population before and after the death of Karim Khan. However, according to the available information (i.e. mostly oral testimonies provided by Iranian Jews and recorded during the first and second halves of the 19th century), the additional plights and distresses of Iranian Jews during the period were to a large extent a consequence of the generally low and degraded status of Jews as well as a result of their poorly protected physical and communal position in several localities across Iran.44 43 Regarding the dislocations and sufferings of the population in these and other cities, towns and settlements of central and southern Iran following the death of Karim Khan, see Hasan-i Fasa i’s Farsnama-yi Nasiri, trans. into English by H.

Al-Khalil) in Ottoman Palestine to the Jewish communities of Baghdad and Basra in 1773. Arriving in Basra in the fall of that year, he was unable to leave the city during the next four turbulent years and served as an eyewitness to the 13 months-long siege of Basra by 30,000 soldiers of Karim Khan and the hardships and sufferings of the city’s population during the siege and the occupation that followed it. Entitled Megillat Paras (literally “The Scroll of Persia”), and written in rhymed verse, Rabbi Elyahsar’s chronicle documented in detail the brutal treatment of Basra’s well-established and prosperous Jewish community of merchants at the hand of the Iranian soldiers and commanders of Karim Khan, led by his brother Sadiq Khan.48 Among other information related to the fate of the community under the Zand control, the chronicle documents the looting of Jewish property, rape of Jewish women, imprisonment, torture and deportation of the wealthy members of the community (chief among them the influential head\n\nSee, e.g., A.

While this chronicle and other Jewish sources related to it49 provide valuable information on the condition of the Jewish community of Basra under the occupation of the Zand rulers, one cannot derive from them any conclusive evidence pointing to the particular approach and attitude of the Zand dynasty toward Jews. The harsh treatment of Basra’s general population and Jews among them have to be viewed and understood in the context of the contemporary practices and norms which characterized the attitude of invaders and occupiers toward occupied settlements and populations. As far as the overall condition of Iranian Jews during the reign of the Zand dynasty is concerned, however, the importance of the chronicle lies in the manner in which it juxtaposes the protected status of Jews under Ottoman control with the fundamentally weak and precarious condition of Iran’s scattered Jews. The considerable economic power, political connections and inter-communal relations of the Jewish elite in Basra, Baghdad and other Ottoman provinces, as evidenced in great detail in the chronicle and in other Jewish sources of the period, stand in sharp contrast to the generally oppressed and highly isolated condition of Iran’s Jewish communities and settlements under the rule of the Zand dynasty and much during the last decade of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Indeed, the overall impression that emerges with regard to the generally poor, downtrodden and insecure condition of Iran’s scattered Jews during the reign of Karim Khan and his successors is strengthened by contemporary accounts and testimonies left to us by foreign travelers and visitors. Even in the capital city of Shiraz, where Jews were comparatively more protected, we are told of diverse disabilities, plights and degradations to which the Jews in the city were subjected. Thus, for example, the Dutch traveler and explorer Carsten Niebuhr, who visited the towns and settlements of southern Iran during the reign of Karim Khan, recorded his impressions of the region and the current condition of its population and institutions. Visiting the capital city of Shiraz in the spring of 1765, and commenting on the\n\n49 Regarding these sources, see A.

In his words: The Jews of Shirauz [sic] have a quarter of the city allotted to themselves, for which they pay a considerable tax to government, and are obliged to make frequent presents: These people are more odious to the Persians than those of any other faith; and every opportunity is taken to oppress and extort money from them; the very boys in the street being accustomed to beat and insult them, of which treatment they dare not complain.51\n\nTestimonies provided by native Jews of Shiraz and other towns and settlements of southern Iran in the 1820s point to numerous hardships and pressures to which Jews in those localities had been subjected during the last quarter of the 18th century. Physical violence, high taxes and diverse forms of extortion committed by local Muslim residents and officials in these localities had led to the flight and emigration of Iranian Jews to the more protected towns and cities of Bushihr (in the Persian Gulf ), Basra and Baghdad during the last decade of the 18th century and the first years of the 19th century. In the city of Shiraz itself, evidently under the weight of the pressures and inducements to which the Jews during these years were exposed, a substantial portion of the Jewish community in the city (i.e. about 100 families out of the community’s total of 300 families) had converted to Shi ite Islam. Rev. Joseph Wolff of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews, who conducted missionary work among the Jews of Bushihr, Kazerun and Shiraz in the winter of 1824–5, recorded the testimony of the heads of the community of Shiraz regarding these converts. In his words, which were written down in December 1824 in Shiraz:\n\nC. Niebuhr, Voyage en Arabie et en d’autres pays circonvoisins, 2 vols., Amsterdam 1776–1780, vol. 2, p. 139. 51 W.

The defeat of the last Zand ruler Lutf Ali Khan at the hand of Iran’s next monarch Aqa Muhammad Khan of the Qajar tribe in October 1794 marks the beginning of a new and comparatively more stable period in the history of post-Safavid Iran. With the fall of the southeastern city of Kirman, which had been among the last pockets of the Zand resistance to the ascending power of Iran’s next ruling dynasty, Lutf Ali Khan was brought before the country’s new ruler Aqa Muhammad Khan. The latter had him deprived of his sight and sent him to Tehran, where, upon arrival, he was put to death according to Aqa Muhammad Khan’s order.54 Like many other Turkic and Turkoman tribes, the Qajars, who also consisted of several clans, had migrated from Central Asia into the Middle East during the 14th century. However, they did not make their appearance in the political and military arena of Iran until the 16th\n\n52 See the detailed account of Rev.

They were among the nine Turkoman tribes who assisted the founder of the Safavid kingdom Shah Isma il (r. 1501–1524) in his rise to power,55 and allying with other Turkic and Shi ite tribes, known as the Qizilbash (or Red Heads), they had assisted the Safavids in establishing their authority across Iran and in effecting their far-reaching transformation of the land and its religion and institutions. Yet, despite the fact that the Safavid rulers regarded the Qajars as their political allies and invited their leading chiefs into the royal court, they took precautionary measures by dispersing their tribes.56 Under Shah Abbas the Great, in 1587, some of the Qajars were transferred from the northwestern provinces of Ganja (in Azarbaijan) and Erivan (in Armenia) to the Caspian provinces of Mazandaran and Gurgan for the purpose of defending those territories from the raids of local Turkoman tribes.57 Some others were sent to Georgia to protect the kingdom’s northwestern border, while others were stationed in Khurasan (in the northeast) to fight the Tartars. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, however, the Qajar tribal chiefs held important offices and assignments, particularly as military chieftains, commanders and governors of several provinces, districts and cities.58 They were particularly active and prominent in military campaigns along Iran’s northwestern frontiers in Caucasia (mainly Georgia, Armenia and Azarbaijan) and in the Caspian provinces of Mazandaran and Gurgan, and Khurasan.59 By the end of the 17th century and on the eve of the Afghan invasion in 1722, however, the main concentration of the Qajars appears to have been in Astarabad (i.e. Gurgan), where they played an important part in the struggles for power in northern Iran following the fall of the Safavid kingdom. The protracted period of anarchy, destruction and bloodshed following the collapse of the Safavids, which together with other negative factors contributed considerably to the hardship and demographic decline of Iran’s Jewish communities and settlements, continued well into the last decade of the 18th century, when Aqa Muhammad Khan,\n\nV.

Escaping from the Zand court in Shiraz, Aqa Muhammad Khan eliminated his family rivals in Mazandaran, ironed out differences with other leading Qajar clans and forged alliances not only with neighboring Turkomans and Kurds in the north, but also with tribes of central Iran as well as some powerful notables of southern Iran who had been in the service of the Zand dynasty in Shiraz.60 With the help of the latter allies, Aqa Muhammad Khan captured Shiraz (in 1793), defeated the Zands, and, bringing much of southern Iran under his control, he turned his attention to the north. In a series of military campaigns he succeeded in establishing his hold over extensive territories stretching from Azarbaijan and Georgia in the northwest (in 1794–1795) to the Province of Khurasan in the northeast (in 1796).61 Having moved the capital city to Tehran, at the time an obscure and insignificant town near the main concentration of Qajar troops in the Caspian province of Astarabad, Aqa Muhammad Khan was finally coronated in Tehran in the spring of 1796.62 While he was about to invade Bukhara (in the present-day Republic of Uzbekistan) and Balkh (in northern Afghanistan) in November 1796, his attention was diverted to Georgia, where some 80,000 Russian troops and heavy artillery units, instructed by the Russian Empress Catherine II, were on their way to recapture Georgia and invade Azarbaijan.63 Aqa Muhammad Khan mustered a large expeditionary force to repel the Russian threat. However, while leading his army into Georgia he was assassinated, on June 17th, 1797, by two of his servants.64 The assassination of Aqa Muhammad Khan did not put an end to the rule of the newly-founded dynasty. Over the entire course of the 19th century, and until the official abdication of the last Qajar monarch Ahmad Shah in October 1925, the Qajar kings and the members of their extensive family managed to ensure the continuation of their dynastic, though highly tenuous rule over Iran. Due to their tribal history and outlook as a major ally of the Shi ite-Safavid state, and as a result of their limited and shaky hold over Iran’s extensive territories and varied demographic groups, the Qajars did not challenge but largely\n\n60 61 62 63 64\n\nE.

Aqa Muhammad Khan’s nephew and successor Fath Ali Shah (r. 1797–1834) was in turn followed by the latter king’s grandson Muhammad Shah (r. 1934–1848), who was succeeded by his son Nasir al-Din Shah. The latter resourceful monarch, whose long but fundamentally embattled and controversial reign spanned nearly the entire second half of the 19th century (1848–1896), was assassinated in May 1896, and upon his death he was succeeded by his physically frail and poorly-suited son Muzaffar al-Din Shah (r. 1896–1907). However, while the Qajar dynasty was preserved, the style of their rule changed considerably during the course of the 19th century. While Aqa Muhammad Khan, the founder of the dynasty, had been first and foremost a tribal leader who obtained and consolidated his power through tribal networks and tribal conquests and alliances, his nineteenth-century successors discarded the tribal style in favor of courtly and increasingly extravagant and costly ceremonial conduct and rituals. Moreover, throughout the 19th century, the Qajar monarchs tried to routinize and enhance their power and leverage vis-à-vis Iran’s diverse social and demographic groups by creating statewide bureaucracy and by establishing an effective standing army.
