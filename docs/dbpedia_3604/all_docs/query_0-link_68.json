        "text": "The Science and Culture textbook is unlike any other on the market. The authors wanted to write a book accessible for the general educated reader with no background in the sciences. At the same time they wanted to inspire passion for science, and its history. The key mission from the start though was not just to tell the big story of science. Historians today well know that science is not isolated from culture. Neither is our culture isolated from science. Therefore the authors’ central goal was to discuss the “reciprocity” between science and culture. In this textbook they attempt to tell the biggest story possible, the history of science and culture, and the reciprocal relationship between them, from the Ancient Greeks to the present in a global perspective. This plan is what separates the Science and Culture textbook from other history of science textbooks (though there are few). • There are textbooks that focus on a specific period of time such as this one that concentrations of the history of science from the Scientific Revolution to the present: Bowler, Peter J., and Iwan Rhys Morus. Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005. • There are other history of science books that focus on a specific discipline or place: Kevles, Daniel J. The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America. Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]: Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. • Some history of science books focus much more heavily on the science, and miss key cultural questions like the relationship between gender and science, or religion and science: Cohen, I. Bernhard. Revolution in Science. Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]: Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press, 1995. Bynum, W. F. A Little History of Science. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012. • And other books focus more on the cultural aspects of science exclusively, for example the gender issues in science or the relationship between religion and science: Rossiter, Margaret W. Women Scientists in America: Struggles and Strategies to 1940. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982. Brooke, John Hedley, and Ronald L. Numbers. Science and Religion Around the World. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. Though these are important works of scholarship, the goal of Science and Culture was to draw upon the above these contributions (and many more) and tell the co-equal stories of science and culture over time. The authors justify it like this in their opening paragraphs: Students often express the sentiment, “Why learn about science and culture?” This is actually a very good and important question. One reason to study this subject is that it enables us to examine the most significant questions that humans have ever asked and to look at how those answers have changed over time. These questions often include: Where did life originate? How is the universe structured? What is the makeup of all matter? When did the Earth form? There are many other “big questions” echoing throughout our culture, and you can substitute your own where, how, what, and when inquiries. Just as science is important for studying these vast theoretical questions, remarkably it also has applied value in our daily lives. Look around the room you are in right now and observe the numerous electronic devices that surround you. Perhaps you are eating some genetically engineered food that you prepared in a microwave oven. You may be taking an antibiotic to overcome an infection. For any of these to exist someone in the past had to achieve an important scientific discovery. The result is that the products of science play an essential role in defining our material culture today. You may still be asking yourself, “Why should I study science and culture?” Looking at this issue from a global perspective, we can see that science is what keeps nations and individuals competitive and prosperous. Science is no longer the luxury it once was, but it is now an essential requirement to promote a strong quality of life. With science being an important indicator of success in the future global economy, it is important to learn more about the scientific culture that surrounds you (Paulson, 2007). Before we start our journey into science and culture, we need to take a step back. We need to explore some fundamental questions: What is science? What is culture? How do science and culture interact and influence each other? Along with the intellectual merits and uniqueness of this textbook, Kendall Hunt Publishing has also contributed to its significance for the mobile student in a digital classroom. Unlike most eBooks available through other publishers, Kendall Hunt’s publications, including our Science & Culture textbook, are created initially as a digital textbook rather than a simple pdf version of a print textbook. By designing the material as a digital product first, it enables Kendall Hunt to utilize the benefits of the digital environment. For example, embedded links at the end of most chapters add a level of interactivity. These links, can be embedded directly into the framework of the text, to include video, speeches, activities, audio, etc. Kendall Hunt encourages customization of its material. Customization ranges from removing a chapter to requesting new content to enhance a particular area of interest. All of Kendall Hunt’s library, including our textbook, may be accessed in a multitude of formats (electronic, digital, mobile, pdf, or epub) through Vital Source."
