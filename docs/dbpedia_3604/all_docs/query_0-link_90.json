To the sound of music played by the tuxedoed musicians of the Prince Aly Khan Orchestra, women in gleaming and flowing attire, men wearing elaborate headgear and playful children awaited in trepidation on the stands. At last a controlled commotion in the middle of the pitch signalled the beginning of the extraordinary ceremony that the joyful crowd had come to witness. High dignitaries in their fineries carrying the Holy Qur’an, the ceremonial sword of justice and other insignia flanked and followed a handsome young man as he made his way towards the centre of the pitch where a pulpit had been built for the occasion. Walking by the young man’s left side was a statuesque woman, with her head uncovered, wearing a stunning white sari, which further enhanced her mature beauty. The young man climbed alone to the top of the pulpit and, with great composure, reached its centre. A high dignitary presented him with the copy of the Holy Qur’an, thus marking the formal beginning of the ceremony. As the Holy Book was handed over, all those present lowered their heads and covered their faces at once: the women concealed their gaze under the most ornate veils, the men shadowed their faces with garlands made of flowers and coloured paper. Then, the young man on the pulpit stood up, donned the robe that had been worn by his grandfather and finally sat on a throne-like chair, basking in the admiration of those tens of thousands of people around him. The formal ceremony over, the stadium resounded again to the music of a Scottish bagpipe band while the young man, followed by the dignitaries, made his way out of the stadium escorted by the same woman who had accompanied him at the start of the event.\n\nCortese_00_Prelims\n\n10\n\n8/22/06, 9:42 AM\n\nPreface\n\n[ xi\n\nThe young man was Prince Karim and the event formally celebrated his appointment as the fourth Aga Khan, the spiritual leader of some 15 million Shi‘a Imami IsmaÆili Muslims worldwide who believe him to be the 49th imam in a direct line of descent originating with ÆAli b. Abi Talib, cousin and son-inlaw of the Prophet Muhammad. His Highness Shah Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan’s succession to the imamate followed the death, on 11 July 1957, of his grandfather Muhammad Shah Aga Khan III. The Karachi event was but one of several accession ceremonies that, between the autumn of 1957 and the spring of 1958, IsmaÆilis of East Africa and of the Indian Subcontinent staged in their regions to salute the new IsmaÆili spiritual leader. These events celebrated the transfer of spiritual leadership from one of the most influential Muslim men of our time to another; however, our interest here is on the stunning woman who so prominently figured throughout the ceremonial. She was known as Princess Taj al-Dawla and was the mother of H. H. Karim Aga Khan IV. A great beauty of her day, she was born Joan Barbara Yarde-Buller, eldest daughter of Lord and Lady Churston. After a first marriage to a member of the Guinness banking family, in 1936 she wedded Prince ÆAli, son of the third Aga Khan. Her knowledge of nursing practice inspired her father-in-law to appoint her, in 1944, health and education commissioner for the benefit of his followers in East Africa. After her divorce from Prince ÆAli, Joan based herself in London where she was to be a renowned hostess of socialites, intellectuals, politicians and diplomats. In the aftermath of her son’s accession to the imamate, she played an important part in assisting him in the numerous demanding engagements that came with his new role. Late in life Joan married once more, thus becoming Joan Lady Camrose, and she dedicated herself to the patronage of the arts and of healthcare projects, engagements that she passionately cultivated until her death in 1997. The discreet, but nonetheless significant, mark that Princess Taj al-Dawla left in recent IsmaÆili dynastic history was matched by that of a number of other glamorous women who joined the family, among them Begum Aga Khan III, known as Umm Habiba and honoured as Mata Salamat. Born Yvette Blanche Labrousse in 1906 in France, her background could not have been more different than Joan’s. Daughter of a tram conductor and a seamstress, Yvette became a beauty queen in 1930, and in 1944, in Switzerland, became the fourth and last wife of the elderly Aga Khan III. The enduring love and devotion that Yvette showed to Muhammad Shah became the stuff of legend. Once widowed, she never re-married and, until her own death on 1 July 2000, she ensured that every day a fresh red rose would be placed on his immaculate white Carrara marble tomb, housed in a mausoleum overlooking the Nile in Aswan. Through her husband, Yvette had been introduced to Islam, a religion she came to genuinely and profoundly love and embrace and, like Joan, she also distinguished herself as an accomplished connoisseur of\n\nCortese_00_Prelims\n\n11\n\n8/22/06, 9:42 AM\n\nxii ]\n\nPreface\n\nthe arts, a generous patron of charities and a most exquisite hostess. Joan’s and Yvette’s backgrounds, their eventful lives and the extraordinary lifestyle that both enjoyed, respectively as mother and wife of imams, mirror in many ways those of the many influential women in the history of the IsmaÆilis who had preceded them almost a thousand years earlier. Those were the women who lived in the period which came to be known as the ‘golden age’ of IsmaÆili history, the age of the Fatimids (297–567/909–1171). Those women belonged or were linked to the Fatimid dynasty and its courts and it is on their identities, roles, influence and achievements that the present work is focused. The first comprehensive study so far on women and the Fatimids, spanning areas as diverse as North Africa, Egypt and the Yemen, it addresses neglected aspects of the social and dynastic Fatimid history, thus enriching our knowledge of one of the most fascinating periods in the history of Islam as a whole.\n\nCortese_00_Prelims\n\n12\n\n8/22/06, 9:42 AM\n\n1 acknowledgements\n\nWe are very grateful to Professor Yaacov Lev (Bar Ilan University, Israel), Professor Michael Brett (Hemeritus Reader, SOAS, London) and Professor Heinz Halm (Tubingen University), who have over the years generously and patiently given us academic advice, encouragement and spent much time reading our numerous drafts. Their insightful and inspirational scholarly comments and feedback have always been greatly appreciated and have influenced in many ways the present work. Of course, we are solely responsible for any inaccuracies this book may contain. In researching this book, we spent a great deal of the last eleven years at the Institute of Ismaili Studies, London, where we were privileged to meet many members of staff and students, who have always followed the progress of our research with great interest and warmth. In particular, we would like to give our special thanks to the Associate Director of the Institute and Head of the Department of Academic Research and Publications, Dr Farhad Daftary, for personally endorsing this project and for his constant support. Also we thank Hamid Haji for his precious advice on bibliographic and editorial matters. Throughout our research work, we have greatly benefited from the efficiency and the help of all past and present staff in the Library of the Institute. In particular, we are grateful to the former Head Librarian, Dr Duncan Haldane, and the senior Librarian and Keeper of the Ismaili Collection, Alnoor Merchant, for facilitating our access to essential printed and manuscript material. An affectionate thank-you goes to Mrs Khadija Lalani-Pardhan, without whose presence the Library would not be the pleasant place that it is. We also benefited from accessing the collections and using the facilities of several libraries in the UK and abroad, particularly the Library of the School of\n\nCortese_00_Prelims\n\n13\n\n8/22/06, 9:42 AM\n\nxiv ]\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nOriental and African Studies, University of London, where we are indebted to Peter Colvin, the Languages and Cultures Faculty Librarian, Islamic Middle East Section, for his assistance. We would also like to acknowledge Dr ÆAbd Allah al-ÆUdhari in assisting us with the poetry featured in this text. The staff of Edinburgh University Press deserve to be credited for their assistance in this project, and our gratitude goes in particular to Nicola Carr for her constant backing and the help she gave us. Delia would like to express her gratitude to the Dipartimento di Studi e Ricerche sull’Africa ed i Paesi Arabi of the Istituto Universitario Orientale, Napoli (now Università degli Studi di Napoli “L’Orientale”) for awarding her in 1996– 97 a two-year post-doctoral fellowship to sponsor this research project in its initial phase. In particular, she would like to thank Professor Carmela Baffioni, whose academic endorsement of this project was instrumental in Delia obtaining the award. She would also like to acknowledge the overall support received from her colleagues in the School of Arts, Middlesex University, London. On a personal note … over the last decade Delia’s life, with its many joys and a few sorrows, has been almost as adventurous – but not as financially rewarding – as that of the women featured in this book. Delia therefore wishes to pay tribute to family and friends for sharing the fun with her and for their unstinting love and support in less happy days. In particular, Delia’s warmest thanks go to her partner, Chris Hill, for patiently reading and acutely commenting upon some chapters of this book but, above all, for all his love and for taking her to the most beautiful parts of the world. Simonetta would like to show her appreciation to the Arts and Humanities Research Board for awarding her a Research Grant to cover research leave in 2004. This grant was matched by periods of research leave from Roehampton University, London, where a special thanks is due to the Head of the School of Arts, Dr Lyndie Brimstone, for her strong support for maintaining the practice of research sabbaticals. Simonetta would also like to thank colleagues and students at Roehampton. Her everlasting gratefulness goes to her husband Piers for his stoic patience. Not only did he accept his fate by proofreading all the drafts of this book and making intelligent remarks, he also survived a decade of evenings, weekends and months looking after the children while his spouse was occupied pursuing her projects. Finally, thank you Clementina and Violetta for bearing with a mamma busy writing about the ‘Fatimids’ instead of spending time playing with you or taking you to the park. You remain the most precious of princesses. Finally, a big thank you, to all our friends in Italy, the UK, the Middle East and the rest of the world.

Studying Women and the Fatimids: the Sources, the Methods and the State of Studies The Fatimid period is one of the best-documented in medieval Islamic history. A considerable number of medieval non-IsmaÆili literary works, as well as documentary, epigraphic, artistic and archaeological sources, shed light on most aspects relating to the history of the Fatimid dynasty and of the societies in those areas under Fatimid rule or influence. Complementing this body of sources are the few historical works written by IsmaÆili authors and the historical references contained in the extensive IsmaÆili doctrinal literature. IsmaÆili and non-IsmaÆili primary sources represent the core material on which the contents of this book are based. Most of these sources have been discussed, explained and classified by Paul E. Walker in his Exploring an Islamic Empire: Fatimid History and its Sources (2001) and, more broadly, by F. Daftary, Ismaili Literature: A Bibliography of Sources and Studies (2004). In the present book the data drawn from a vast selection of primary sources are approached and interpreted through the methods of textual, socio-historical and contextual analyses. As is the case with the overwhelming majority of medieval sources, none of the primary literature used here was written by women and, as a whole, none of the male writers dealt with women as their primary concern. Mediated, as they are, through the male voices, the references to women found in these sources may be said to a large extent to be more revealing about men’s perceptions of women than the women themselves. In particular, they uncover the manner in which male writers, but also the male protagonists they wrote about, viewed women and what, on the basis of their world-outlook, backgrounds and aims, [1]\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n1\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n2]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nmen thought it relevant to report. As a result, for a comprehensive and sound interpretation of the data on women in IsmaÆili and non-IsmaÆili sources, special attention has been devoted throughout this book, to the inference of the social, political and cultural contexts, which informed the writer’s perspectives. Hence, the historical analysis of data is never too far removed from contemporary or subsequent social, political and doctrinal perceptions about women and their formulation through literary figures and topoi. In the course of the present book, the merits, limits and complexities arising from the use of these sources will be discussed when piecing together information about, and attitudes towards, the women of the Fatimid dynasty and the women living under Fatimid rule. The relative abundance of primary sources, the increasing availability in print of IsmaÆili literature and the greater accessibility to IsmaÆili manuscripts have made the study of Fatimid history, and of IsmaÆilism during that period, the most widely covered area of research in the field of IsmaÆili studies. While contemporary aspects of IsmaÆili women’s participation in social, educational and ritual activities have been the subject of a number of recent studies, little attention has hitherto been devoted to the study of women in the Fatimid period. This lacuna is particularly noticeable when considering that the growth of interest in the academic study of the IsmaÆilis in general, and the Fatimids in particular, coincided with the flourishing of studies on the position of women in Islam, past and present. The aim of the present work is above all to unearth references to women so as to re-inscribe their role in the social history of the Fatimid era. This research is informed by an inclusive methodological stance, which results from the use of a variety of scholarly approaches to the study of women and Islam. We have resorted particularly to textual analysis and criticism, to the contextual and literary reading of historical records, as well as to the critical use of anecdotal material. In some, yet rare, cases we have been able to release from those narratives the voices of the women themselves. While seeking to pave the way to the development of additional perspectives and avenues of investigation in the study of medieval Islam and its women, this book also pays tribute to past and present landmark studies on women in the Islamic world and on gender and Islam. The first studies on women in Islam by modern Muslim and non-Muslim scholars were to varying degrees informed by the debate on women’s rights prevailing within not only European and American but also Egyptian and Turkish intellectual circles. Among these studies were, in the early 1940s, the groundbreaking articles and books by Nabia Abbott (1897–1981). Abbott’s work was to inaugurate a type of research on the women of the early history of Islam which combined two approaches: the exegetical analysis of religious and\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n2\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n[3\n\nlegal statements about women in the sacred texts and the theological literature of Islam; and the contextual historical research of accounts about (in fact, references to) famous and influential women throughout Islamic history, such as the Prophet’s wives and the ‘queens of Baghdad’. Notwithstanding its limitations, Abbott’s work was an eye-opener, especially with regard to source criticism, the use of which method was to be intensified and broadened from the 1980s onwards by a number of scholars. Among them, Fatima Mernissi focused her textual criticism upon misogynistic ˙adÈths, Rifaat Hassan applied feminist reading to selected Qur’anic verses and Barbara Stowasser researched female figures in the Qur’an and non-Qur’anic literature. Through their works, these researchers, and those who follow in their footsteps, have raised awareness of the masculine bias of writers, historians and scholars in their readings and uses of sacred texts. Within the field of social anthropology, since the late 1970s an increasing number of scholars devoted their studies to women in contemporary Islamic societies, with a focus on rural women. Although the contents of these studies are of limited applicability to research on women in medieval Islamic societies, the methods used to compile them are instrumental in further stimulating academic awareness of issues relating to the researcher’s perspective. Scholars like Elizabeth Fernea and Nikki Keddie, by letting their ‘informants’ speak for themselves, aimed at overcoming the pitfalls of imposing Western or Westerninspired intellectual constructs on those women who were the subjects of their study. The publication in 1992 of Leila Ahmed’s Women and Gender in Islam constituted a major breakthrough in the history of gender studies in Islam, thanks to the author’s aim to conceptualise women’s history and issues of gender as discourse by identifying and exploring ‘the way in which gender is 1 articulated socially, institutionally, and verbally’ in Islamic societies past and present. Ahmed argued that it was in the early history of Islam that the principal terms of the core religious discourses were founded. One was the dominant ‘voice’ of hierarchical and ‘establishment’ Islam, which, Ahmed contends, elaborated a meaning of gender, an expression of which was the legal, social and economic subordination and marginalisation of women. The other was the ‘ethical voice’, stressing the moral and spiritual equality of all human beings, which, Ahmed continues, was emphasised by marginal groups that challenged the dominant political order and its interpretation of Islam, including its conception of gender. Among these anti-establishment groups she includes the Qarmatians, an early IsmaÆili movement, which will be extensively dealt with in the course of the present book. Although based on a questionable selection of hostile primary sources, and a few, clearly outdated studies, Ahmed’s reference to the Qarmatians nevertheless serves the purpose of\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n3\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n4]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nillustrating a dissenting meaning of gender within a given medieval Islamic society.2 When studying IsmaÆili movements, the applicability of Ahmed’s use of discourse stretches beyond the Qarmatians. To cite but one example, what Ahmed defines as the ‘ethical’ voice can be also ‘heard’ in the Fatimid sources covering the missionary activities of the early IsmaÆili and Fatimid propagandists, where the inclusion of gender-related narratives served a politicodynastic discourse. The analysis of sources as literature, and of literature as a source, represents yet another method of research, which can help to provide a fuller picture of the perception held by a particular society of the status and expected roles of its women. Scholars such as Fadwa Malti-Douglas and Nadia El-Cheikh make use of adab literature as source to identify conventions in representing women, which reflect not only the writer’s but also his society’s understanding of gender roles. They contend that, unlike doctrinal and historical sources, literary texts are neither prescriptive nor professedly ideological and, even though repetitive and full of literary conventions, can still provide insights into shared social 3 attitudes, which go beyond the ‘official’ records. Most of the sources on which the present book is based, be they historical or doctrinal, do intersperse factual and interpretative accounts with anecdotal and clearly fictional ones. Rarely do the writers expressly introduce anecdotes as anecdotes, leaving it to the skills of the reader to distinguish between fact and fiction. The issue of literary conventions and how to interpret anecdotal stories come particularly to the fore in the chapters of this book that deal with court life and women’s power. The overwhelming majority of past and present monographs on women in classical and medieval Islam have focused on women in the Prophet’s household and on women who belonged to Sunni dynasties, such as the ÆAbbasids, the Saljuqs, the Mamluks and the Ottomans. As for women in ShiÆism, while there are a number of publications on contemporary issues relating to Twelvers, as well as to women in IsmaÆili denominations such as the Druze, the Khoja and the Bohra, extensive studies on women in pre-modern ShiÆism in general, and in Fatimid IsmaÆilism in particular, are indeed rare. In 1931 Husayn al-Hamdani published in the Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society an article on the life and times of the eleventh- and twelfth-century pro-Fatimid queen Arwa in the Yemen. Al-Hamdani’s article was to be the first and, for long time, the only academic study specifically devoted to a female personality of the Fatimid period. With his publication in 1962 of La Berbérie Orientale sous les ZÈrÈdes, Hady Roger Idris provided the most comprehensive coverage to date on the women of the Zirids, the Fatimids’ vassals in North Africa. However, a specific academic interest on prominent women of the Fatimid dynasty did not really start until the 1980s. In 1987, Yaacov Lev published in the Journal of Semitic Studies an article on the Fatimid princess Sitt al-Mulk that was to be the first\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n4\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n[5\n\npublication exclusively devoted to a woman of the Fatimid dynasty. In the 1990s aspects of Sitt al-Mulk’s life were further discussed by Heinz Halm in a handful of short articles while other scholars published a few more studies on queen Arwa. The single monograph to have ever appeared thus far on the subject of women in Fatimid Egypt is al-Mar’a fÈ Mißr fÈ ’l-Æaßr al-FÅ†imÈ (The Woman in Egypt in the Fatimid Period), a book in Arabic by Nuriman ÆAbd alKarim Ahmad, published in Cairo in 1993. In contributing, through a study on women and the Fatimids, to bridging a gap in the field of IsmaÆili studies, this book builds on the limited but nonetheless highly significant scholarly contributions just mentioned. No study of this kind would be comprehensive without an overview of IsmaÆili perspectives on some of the female figures from the early history of Islam, whose mention frequently recurs in Fatimid and IsmaÆili post-Fatimid sources, where they are invested with numerous functions, the foremost being that of role model: the mother, the wife, the daughter, the supporter, the fighter for her own rights. 2. Medieval IsmaÆÆili Perspectives on the Women of the Prophet Muhammad’s Household: Fatima and Khadija Of the women of the Prophet Muhammad’s family, ShiÆi and especially IsmaÆili writers focus on the figure of the Prophet’s daughter Fatima, who is praised above all other women of his household, including his wives. The Qur’anic verses 33.32–3 on the privileged position of the ‘women of the Prophet’ (nisÅ’ al-nabÈ), traditionally interpreted by all Sunni exegetes as referring to Muhammad’s wives, are thus understood by ShiÆis as indicating the female descendants of the Prophet, particularly Fatima, her daughters and granddaughters. Early IsmaÆili writers claimed that blood ties, rather than ties acquired through marriage, were to be regarded as the strongest and most pure expression of the Prophet’s family unit. Such an interpretative key clearly served the genealogical, political and religious claims of the Fatimids, thus named after Fatima. The dynasty did not utilise the term ‘Fatimid’ to refer to itself until the second half of the eleventh century, by which time its rule in Egypt had already been consolidated for almost a century while the doctrinal and philosophical system on which it based its right to rule had reached a high level of elaboration.4 The most prominent Fatimid authors re-interpreted narratives relating to female role models in Islam, such as Fatima and other important female figures, to reflect a religio-political discourse ultimately aimed at backing the Fatimids’ dynastic claims. Indeed, throughout Islamic history, female role models have often been used as powerful advertisements to serve a range of aims: to state dynastic identity and legitimacy, to keep social stability by defining the ideal\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n5\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n6]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nroles Muslim women ought to conform to, and even to stir up support and activism among Muslim women during particular periods of political ferment. One of the most important female figures and role models for Muslims of yesterday and today, Fatima, known as al-ZahrÅ’ (the Radiant) and al-BatËl (the Virgin), was the daughter of Muhammad and his first wife Khadija, presumably born around 604 CE. Besides epitomising the role of the devout and obedient daughter of the Prophet, the one who nurtured him during his illness and eventual death, and who died, distraught, only a few months after her father, Fatima also embodies the role of the suffering wife of ÆAli b. Abi Talib, who strives to make ends meet, and of the mother who has premonitions about the tragic fate of her two sons. Our knowledge of Fatima’s biography relies on an extensive body of narratives, legends and hagiographical reconstructions, where the prominent role she plays appears to rest more on her links to the men of her family than on her own merits. When aiming at supporting descent claims, the narrator emphasises Fatima’s blood links to her father; when the purpose is to praise the virtues of her husband ÆAli in support for his succession rights, precedence is given to her role as wife; finally, when upholding the issue of the descent of the imamate, she is presented as the suffering mother of al-Hasan and al-Husayn. However, in a number of accounts included in popular and mystical works, Fatima does take centre stage and her personal virtues are praised when she is lauded for her roles as pious intercessor and ascetic believer. Sunni as well as ShiÆi writers remark on her being the Prophet’s most beloved and the most pious of his daughters. Nevertheless, it is her marriage to her paternal cousin ÆAli which brings her to the fore. Several ShiÆi and IsmaÆili narratives describe their marriage as being made in heaven. One of them is included in Shar˙ al-akhbÅr, a compendium of traditions on the virtues of the members of the Ahl al-Bayt (‘the People of the Prophet’s House’, typically Muhammad, Fatima, ÆAli, and their sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn) by the most authoritative Fatimid jurist and chief missionary al-Qadi al-NuÆman (d. 363/ 974). There al-Nuæman reports a number of hagiographical stories that describe Fatima and ÆAli’s marriage as being the result of a revelation to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. The marriage contract, witnessed by thousands of praising angels, was sealed in heaven before it could be signed on earth. Hence, their union was divinely ordained, and her excellence linked to 5 the excellence of her husband, ÆAli, and reflected in their progeny. The marriage itself, though blessed by the birth of children, was reportedly not without difficulties. Some Sunni ˙adÈths mention disagreements between the spouses and the recourse to the Prophet for counselling. Even in ShiÆi ˙adÈths there is the occasional reference to ÆAli wanting to take another wife, whether or not this implied divorcing Fatima, but in the end all things are resolved either\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n6\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n[7\n\nthanks to the direct intervention of Muhammad, or by resorting to the Prophet’s statement that ‘Fatima is a part of me, whoever harms her, harms me’.6 What ShiÆi, as well as Sunni, narrators agree upon is that Fatima and ÆAli lived a harsh, not comfortable life. With the aim of praising the generosity of both spouses, they state that the couple went for up to three days without food and that Fatima, embarrassed to receive her father at home without anything to offer him, prayed so intensely that, in answer to her prayers, a bowl of hot soup materialised and the whole family, including the two little children, could enjoy the meal.7 These hagiographical accounts are but an expression of a broader doctrinal and genealogical ShiÆi discourse identifying Fatima as the initiator of the legitimate line of descendants from the Prophet. According to ShiÆi thought, she is a member – the only female member – of the Ahl al-Bayt. When, during the ninth and tenth centuries, ShiÆi and Sunni disputes over political and doctrinal issues intensified, Shiæi ˙adÈths circulated about the members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their qualities, such as infallibility, purity and ability to intercede. In these ˙adÈths, Fatima is hailed as infallible and as cleansed from the physical impurities of her gender: menstruation and post-partum bleeding. Like Mary, the mother of Jesus, she is called batËl and one tradition tells us that al-Hasan and al-Husayn were born out of her thigh. It is perhaps particularly in relation to her purity, and her other qualities, that one tradition identifies her as being the only woman to have been created equal to man. Further glorifying epithets are to be found in the work of the fifteenth-century Tayyibi IsmaÆili scholar Idris 8 ÆImad al-Din. Al-Qadi al-Nuæman reports a number of ˙adÈths to illustrate Fatima’s position of excellence among believers. In them, it is the Prophet himself who names Fatima as ‘the foremost lady of the whole community of believers’ or ‘the first lady of the worlds’, or even ‘the first of the women of Paradise’.9 She is indeed deemed superior to Mary, who in turn is described as the first lady only among the women of her own time. In Paradise, Fatima sits, a splendid image bearing a crown, on a throne and, on the Day of Resurrection, those who loved her and, through her, loved Muhammad, will be greeted by him in Paradise.10 The ascription to Fatima of an eschatological role as intercessor was not the exclusive domain of speculations by medieval ShiÆi and Fatimid scholars but extended to popular religious expressions. To this day her intermediation is sought by Twelver ShiÆis, as shown at passion plays (taÆziya) in praise of Fatima 11 and her progeny. An additional interpretative key to the roles ascribed to Fatima is presented in ShiÆi and IsmaÆili gnostic literature, where the Qur’anic verse of the Light is reinterpreted as referring to Fatima being the mother of imams, the lamp which contains the light of al-Husayn. She is thus further 12 invested with a universal creative power by means of her shining light. The affirmation of Fatima’s primacy and the bestowal upon her of supernatural\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n7\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n8]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nqualities were essential components of the doctrinal backdrop that Fatimid scholars elaborated to validate genealogical claims centred around her spouse and their progeny. Early Fatimid scholars argued that, as daughter, Fatima held a position of precedence in relation to the Prophet’s wives, because, unlike them, her link to the Prophet was direct, through blood. Her family ties were made even stronger when she married the Prophet’s cousin, ÆAli. Their claim of Fatima’s superior status served a clear purpose. By emphasising the superiority of blood ties over ties by marriage, these Fatimid scholars not only defended their support for ÆAli’s succession over that of Abu Bakr, who was linked to Muhammad through the marriage of his daughter ÆA’isha, but also justified the legitimacy of any further succession claims by ÆAli and Fatima’s progeny. Two episodes in Fatima’s life are particularly significant in the way they were reinterpreted to support succession claims based on the ‘blood ties’ argument as elaborated by the ShiÆis. Both are presented as exemplifying her role as fighter for her own and her family’s rights. One is the so-called Saqifa affair. In the immediate aftermath of Muhammad’s death, while, according to tradition, preparation was still underway for the Prophet’s funeral, some notable members of the community gathered at Saqifat Bani SaÆida to discuss the issue of succession, the outcome of which would be the nomination of Abu Bakr as caliph. What ensued was a conflict between ÆAli and Abu Bakr. Even though in Sunni sources this episode is played down, one can still infer that, in the midst of this dispute, Fatima suffered threats in her own house. ShiÆi sources, instead, cover the incident in much greater detail and describe a direct physical confrontation in which Fatima defended ÆAli against Abu Bakr and his 13 supporters. ShiÆi commentators used Fatima’s predicament to pass judgement on their opponents by denouncing their loss of respect towards the Prophet, his mourning daughter and the rest of his family, thus further highlighting the injustice perpetrated against ÆAli’s rights, which they saw as legitimate. The second of these episodes refers to the debate over Fatima’s inheritance rights. In the ShiÆi accounts that cover it, she is portrayed as the main protagonist. The debate centred on whether the Prophet’s property, that is, what he had acquired as a result of booty or treatises, was to be considered private or public, and, as a consequence, whether Fatima had the right to inherit her father’s property, which consisted of an oasis, named Fadak, and its surroundings. Abu Bakr firmly dismissed Fatima’s claims, arguing that a prophet cannot leave inheritance. The dispute on this matter between the first caliphs on the one side and ÆAli and his supporters on the other remained unresolved until 211/826, when the ÆAbbasid caliph al-Ma’mun at last granted Fadak to Fatima’s descendants. Sunni and ShiÆi sources sharply differed on the interpretation of relevant Qur’anic passages and ˙adÈths. The Sunnis held that a\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n8\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n[9\n\nprophet’s property was not personal and could be inherited only by the community through its leaders, who would administer it. For the ShiÆis, who also adduced evidence from additional sources such as Fatima’s khu†ba (Fatima’s Speech), Fadak was the Prophet’s own and therefore Fatima’s claims to inheritance were legitimate. IsmaÆili and Fatimid writers extensively refer to this episode and lament Fatima being stripped of her rights. In varying degrees of pathos, Fatimid sources show Fatima as a woman with no protectors, who can only use her dialectic and oratory gift displayed in her well-known Speech, but to no avail. Al-Qadi alNuÆman, for example, reports large extracts of the Speech in his Shar˙ al-akhbÅr, where he adds his allegorical interpretation of the passages. Overall, al-Qadi alNuÆman argues that Fatima’s Speech was not specifically about Fadak and its 14 environs, but about ‘the imamate from her and the progeny of the Prophet’. This interpretative key is one which several medieval as well as contemporary 15 ShiÆi scholars endorse. The episode of Fatima’s inheritance was widely used by the IsmaÆilis for propagandist and other purposes. Claims of succession and the respect of Fatima’s status became intertwined. In this vein, the tenth-century North African IsmaÆili missionary Ibn al-Haytham could state that the two major sins of ÆAli’s opponents were ‘claiming the imamate and leadership ahead of God’s 16 friends [that is, the rightful imams] and taking away the veil of Fatima’. Moreover, Fatima’s right to inherit, and to inherit land, from her father had a considerable impact, as a legal precedent, on Fatimid inheritance law, as will be explained later on in the book. According to al-Qadi al-NuÆman, the denial of her inheritance left a bitterness from which Fatima was relieved only by her death. She organised her own funeral and asked to be buried at night, with only ÆAli in attendance, so that ‘the enemies of the Prophet’s family’ would not be 17 able to recite the funerary prayers over her. Fatima has remained a reference figure throughout the Fatimid period and beyond. Her name, or her titles, are found in coins and talismans and were reportedly mentioned in the blessings on the Ahl al-Bayt that were included in 18 the khu†ba upon the Fatimid conquest of Egypt. The Fatimids celebrated her birthday and made it into a holiday, when gifts were exchanged among the palace people. A rosary-like prayer known as TasbÈ˙ FÅ†ima (Fatima’s glorification of God), is reported by Fatimid writers as consisting of three sections of thirty-three blessings or formulae, which, added to the shahÅda, invoke the name of God one hundred times, for which Allah will grant benefits equivalent 19 to 1,000 good deeds. After the Fatimids, and particularly since the sixteenth century, with the establishment of the Safavid dynasty in Persia and the proclamation of Twelver ShiÆism as its official religion, popular accounts on Fatima have been revived among ShiÆis and enacted in the passion plays, where\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n9\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n10 ]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nshe is portrayed as the suffering mother and the victim of injustice. Against the political background and ideological mobilisation that lead to the 1979 Iranian revolution, to her roles has been added that of the exemplary female activist. The social reformer and scholar ÆAli ShariÆati (d. 1977) presented Fatima as a role model for contemporary ShiÆi women who, while maintaining their traditional values of modesty, obedience and piety, are aware of social and 20 political issues and fight for them. It is outside the scope of the present work to investigate how far the praise of such female activism was in fact used by Iranian ideologues to encourage women’s support for the Islamic revolution. In its aftermath, such praise was no longer forthcoming at a time when a call for the return to the traditional female domestic roles was implemented by the new regime in more ways than one. Beside Fatima, the other woman in Muhammad’s household who receives ample coverage in IsmaÆili and Fatimid literature is his wife Khadija. Among the Prophet’s wives she is portrayed as being the most important and the most noble, not only because she was his first wife, the first woman the Prophet knew, the one who supported him emotionally and financially and who believed in the divine origin of his call, but also because she was the wife who was blessed with bearing his children. Motherhood is interpreted as a sign of her virtue and purity. It is indeed motherhood that ultimately distinguishes her 21 because, by being Fatima’s mother, ‘she gave birth to the imams’. She therefore cannot even remotely be compared to any of Muhammad’s other wives, the 22 only fitting comparison being with Mary. Through al-Qadi al-NuÆman’s extolling of her virtues, Khadija comes across as the perfect Muslim woman: the devout wife, the quintessential mother, the first woman to have answered the call of Islam, whose daughter was to marry the first man to convert to Islam, the generous sponsor for the sake of Allah. Like Fatima, she is one of the women of Paradise, who, on earth, was endowed with foreknowledge: she knew that Muhammad was to be a prophet and was waiting for the signs to appear.23 She is portrayed as pre-destined to be the consoling and supportive wife as evidenced by the supernatural knowledge she was granted as a divine gift. Some IsmaÆili authors provide an allegorical interpretation of the roles and status of both Fatima and Khadija. In explaining the inner meaning of Fatima’s Speech, al-Qadi al-NuÆman had linked the inheritance issue to that of the succession of the imamate and concluded that Fatima had acted as a witness (˙ujja, lit. ‘proof’) to her contemporaries. This aspect of al-Nuæman’s argument was to be upheld and elaborated upon to a greater extent by the Yemeni IsmaÆili author Ibrahim b. al-Husayn al-Hamidi (d. 557/1162) in his KitÅb Kanz alwalad. Beyond Fatima, al-Hamidi reinterpreted allegorically the roles of other female figures within the context of his explanation of the spiritual cosmology that underpinned the Tayyibi formulation of Ismaæili doctrine. Echoing Neo-\n\nCortese_01_Intro\n\n10\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n[ 11\n\nplatonic cosmology, he interpreted Eve’s coming into being from Adam’s rib as symbolic of the cosmic emanation of the Universal Soul from the First Intellect. Eve’s esoteric role is that of being Adam’s ˙ujja, who embodies the esoteric interpretation of his prophet-hood.24 Similarly, al-Hamidi identified Khadija as Muhammad’s ˙ujja. By marrying her both exoterically and esoterically, Muhammad received from her both the ranks of prophet and messenger (nubuwwa and risÅla). As his ˙ujja, Khadija is made responsible for his ‘educational training’ as imam or ‘Master of the time’, for elevating his status and explaining his rank. Echoing traditional Muslim accounts of her seniority to Muhammad, al-Hamidi invested her with an almost ‘maternal’ role, which could explain his statement that she was ‘the high Mary’. Khadija is also presented as being the trustee of Muhammad’s appointment of ÆAli as ‘his waßÈ, 25 the heir of his knowledge and he who gathers in himself all the ranks’. AlHamidi applied a similar interpretation to Fatima, whom he saw as the first of the most perfect figures (atimmÅ’) of the age of Muhammad, the one who inaugurated a spiritual line of descent which, through her sons al-Hasan and al26 Husayn, reached its first perfection in Muhammad b. IsmaÆil. This figure was the one the IsmaÆilis identified as their seventh imam, who inaugurated a period of concealment that, according to one group, was to come to an end with the establishment of the Fatimid caliphate. The structure of this volume is topical and the roles and contribution of women are analysed first within the context of IsmaÆili dynastic and political propaganda in support of the spiritual leader: the imam. Having established the place of women in IsmaÆili and Fatimid genealogical history, their status and influence are assessed within the courts in their roles as mothers, courtesans, wives and daughters, as well as workers and servants. We examine the case studies of women whose political influence and power left a mark in the history of the Fatimid dynasty. Moreover, the finances of court women of substance are scrutinised against broader economic and legal contexts. Finally, an evaluation of aspects of the daily life of non-court women is offered. Throughout the book comparison is drawn with the status and roles of women in earlier, contemporary and subsequent Islamic as well as non-Islamic courts.

The DaÆÆ wa: A Historical Overview In mid-eighth-century Baghdad, the Sunni ÆAbbasid caliphs had just undertaken the spiritual and secular leadership of the Muslim community when religiouspolitical activists in Iraq and beyond began to challenge their right to rule. The ÆAbbasids rose to prominence by exploiting the sentiments of those who upheld the rights of the Prophet Muhammad’s descendants to guide the Muslim community, only to ignore these ideals once in power and proceed to curb all dissenting groups. However, one of these groups – the ShiÆis – defied the ÆAbbasids’ right to rule, with militant and spiritual action inspired by a conception of a divinely designed authority that led them to recognise Muhammad’s descendants – via his cousin and son-in-law ÆAli – as their spiritual and secular leaders or imams. ShiÆis credit JaÆfar al-Sadiq (d. 148/765), acknowledged as the fifth imam to descend from ÆAli, with having formulated a full-blown doctrine of imamate; a doctrine that was to be at the heart of all ShiÆi teachings to come. The ShiÆi linking of the principle of authority to genealogy inevitably caused ShiÆi activists to split into groups, each aiming at affirming its own particular vision of spiritual and secular rule by defending the rights of its chosen candidate to the imamate. Among them, a group from Kufa, in southern Iraq, distiguished itself in supporting the imamate of IsmaÆil, who was JaÆfar alSadiq’s son, thus directly challenging the claims of their ShiÆi rivals who backed IsmaÆil’s brother, Musa al-Kazim. It is to the activities of these supporters of IsmaÆil that the IsmaÆilis trace their ancestry. As it transpires from the sources, early IsmaÆilism was far from being a homogeneous and unified movement. It consisted of a number of splinter groups [ 14 ]\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n14\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nWorking the Propaganda Spindle\n\n[ 15\n\nentangled in debates and rivalries over religious-political leadership and messianic expectations. In time, one faction succeded in polarising ideas and energies towards the belief that IsmaÆil’s son and successor, Muhammad, had not actually died but, rather, had gone into physical and spiritual occultation (ghayba) as a safety measure to escape from his opponents. Muhammad’s followers awaited his return as a messianic figure (al-mahdÈ) who, one day, would usher an era of freedom and justice. While waiting, they developed the belief in the existence of a line of hidden imams who, though concealed, would exercise on his behalf both spiritual and secular authority. According to the IsmaÆili tradition, by the middle of the ninth century, the activities of this faction had evolved into a daÆwa (missionary movement or propaganda) operating in areas as diverse as Central Asia, Persia, Yemen and Syria. Towards the end of that century, the Syrian town of Salamiyya came to be identified as the centre of a covert IsmaÆili religious-political propaganda furthering the cause of the hidden imams, and poised at challenging the ÆAbbasids and all other claimants to the leadership of the Muslim community. There is, however, disagreement among scholars about the extent to which this version of the development of the early daÆwa is an accurate rendering of historical reality. What is argued is that, like the IsmaÆili movement as a whole, its daÆwa activities were, for the early centuries, far from being coherent and centralised. It would take two more centuries for a daÆwa structure as such to be clearly identifiable. Fluid as it might have been, this mission was initially carried out by dÅÆÈs (missionaries, propagandists) who swore loyalty to the leadership of a certain ÆAbd Allah the Elder, possibly a Persian from Ahwaz. The IsmaÆili tradition regards him as the first of three hidden imams who escaped ‘Abbasid persecution and settled in Salamiyya. By the last quarter of the ninth century, ‘cells’ were operating in western Persia and southern Iraq. The dÅÆÈ Hamdan Qarmat and his brother-in-law, ÆAbdan, were successful in attracting a significant number of supporters in Kufa, who were to become known as Qarmatians. Near this town, in 277/890, Hamdan Qarmat built the dÅr al-hijra (The Abode of Migration), an operational base for anti-ÆAbbasid activities and a welfare centre for Qarmatian men and women. From Kufa, Hamdan and ÆAbdan eventually sent the dÅÆÈ Abu SaÆid al-Jannabi (d. 301/913) to canvass in Bahrayn. Meanwhile, one of ÆAbdan’s Kufan supporters, Ibn Hawshab (d. 302/914), better known as Mansur al-Yaman (henceforth), arrived in Yemen. There, Mansur alYaman preached publicly and dispatched his relative, al-Haytham, to operate in north-west India. To the west, in 280/893, Mansur al-Yaman sent a fellow Kufan, Abu ÆAbd Allah al-ShiÆi (d. 298/910–11), to preach among the Kutama Berbers in North Africa. This was broadly the state of affairs until the end of the ninth century, when, having settled in Salamiyya, another ÆAbd Allah took the\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n15\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n16 ]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nleadership of the daÆwa and forever changed it by openly claiming the imamate for himself. ÆAbd Allah’s claim caused a split between those dÅÆÈs who continued to believe in the messianic return of Muhammad b. IsmaÆil and those who accepted ÆAbd Allah as the imam of the time. By refusing to acknowledge ÆAbd Allah, Hamdan Qarmat was ‘spirited away’ and ÆAbdan was murdered by Zakarawayh, a former associate in Iraq. This Zakarawayh had initially pledged allegiance to ÆAbd Allah but subsequently started a campaign of self-promotion among the Bedouins of the Syrian–Iraqi desert, lasting until his death in 294/ 907 at the hand of the ÆAbbasids. In Bahrayn, Abu SaÆid al-Jannabi took over the Qarmatian leadership following the death of ÆAbdan. In Yemen, on the other hand, Mansur al-Yaman endorsed ÆAbd Allah’s claim, thus provoking the opposition of his former ally, Ibn al-Fadl. In 289/902, ÆAbd Allah fled Salamiyya either to escape from Zakarawayh’s supporters or the ÆAbbasids, or indeed both. On fleeing Syria, ÆAbd Allah had two options as to where to seek refuge and fulfil his messianic mission. He could have gone to Yemen. There, he had the support of Mansur al-Yaman, but dissent was creeping in among the dÅÆÈs over ÆAbd Allah’s claims. Instead, ÆAbd Allah headed for North Africa, which indeed proved to be the safest and – with hindsight – the best choice. There, the dÅÆÈ Abu ÆAbd Allah al-ShiÆi had already successfully established over a period of ten years an ostensibly ‘unified’ IsmaÆili propaganda network. Allegedly Abu ÆAbd Allah al-ShiÆi had been converted in Kufa by the prominent dÅÆÈ Abu ÆAli and sworn in by another dÅÆÈ, Firuz, who then dispatched him to Yemen to join Mansur al-Yaman. In turn, Abu ÆAli and Abu ÆAbd Allah’s brother were sent to Egypt. On Mansur al-Yaman’s instructions, Abu ÆAbd Allah al-ShiÆi reached Mila (eastern Algeria), having joined a caravan of Kutama Berbers returning home from their pilgrimage to Makka. Once settled in North Africa, Abu ÆAbd Allah made Tazrut the daÆwa base for at least a decade. There, he succeeded in converting the bulk of the Kutama tribesmen and built a dÅr al-hijra for the benefit of the converts, even though there is reason to believe that their understanding of IsmaÆili doctrines remained superficial. On his part, Abu ÆAbd Allah did his best to enforce the sharÈÆa, to give lectures to the Kutama converts and to instruct subordinate dÅÆÈs to hold similar sessions in the areas under their sphere of activities. His endeavours brought long-lasting rewards in that the IsmaÆili cause was to greatly benefit from the Kutama loyalty and amazing warfaring skills. In 290/903, Abu ÆAbd Allah al-ShiÆi begun the military conquest of Ifriqiya, launching offensives on major towns. A year later, accompanied by Firuz, ÆAbd Allah arrived in Egypt, in the city of Fustat, were he was welcomed by dÅÆÈs who had been active there for some time. However, in the same year, Firuz deserted\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n16\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nWorking the Propaganda Spindle\n\n[ 17\n\nÆAbd Allah to join the dissident Ibn al-Fadl in Yemen. Feeling unsafe, in 292/ 905, ÆAbd Allah left Fustat typically disguised as a merchant and with Kutama support he eventually reached Sijilmasa, where he settled for four years. By 296/ 908, the ongoing victories of Abu ÆAbd Allah al-ShiÆi signalled the incipient fall of Qayrawan, near Raqqada, the royal city of the Aghlabids, who were the ruling dynasty in the region at the time. In the following year, the Aghlabid palace in the royal city fell, and by the summer of 296/909 Abu ÆAbd Allah and the Kutama took Sijilmasa. Initially, ÆAbd Allah was acclaimed as caliph and towards the end of the year, upon arriving in Raqqada, ÆAbd Allah’s mahdÈ-ship was publicly announced and he was welcomed as ruler. ÆAbd Allah al-Mahdi (henceforth al-Mahdi) became the first of a dynasty of imam-caliphs, thus inaugurating the so-called ‘golden age’ of IsmaÆilism and a splendid period in Islamic history, art, intellectual and court life, which saw women as participants to an extent rarely found in other domains of the medieval Islamic world. The public appearance of ÆAbd Allah in Sijilmasa and his proclamation as al-Mahdi in Raqqada mark the beginning of the North African phase of Fatimid history, to be distinguished from the pre-dynastic period of IsmaÆilism. The periodisation of Fatimid history into pre-dynastic, North African and Egyptian phases will be adopted throughout this book. The dynasty eventually became famous under the name of ‘Fatimid’ through Fatima, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad and wife of his cousin ÆAli, who is believed by all ShiÆis to have been the first imam, while his wife Fatima, as the bearer of the next generation of imams, has often been hailed as ‘the mother of the imams’. Within a year of his reign, al-Mahdi, fearing dissent at home, began a purge within his entourage. In 298/911, claiming the discovery of a conspiracy, alMahdi ordered the execution of its alledged instigators: Abu ÆAbd Allah alShiÆi, his brother and a number of Kutama chiefs. Like any other confident ruler, al-Mahdi set about building his capital, al-Mahdiyya, on the coast of what is today Tunisia, finally settling there in 308/920–1. Elsewhere, a mahdÈ frenzy flared up within the broader ‘IsmaÆili/Qarmatian’ movement. In the Yemen, Ibn al-Fadl claimed the mahdÈ-ship for himself, as in Bahrayn apparently did Abu SaÆid al-Jannabi. But while Ibn al-Fadl’s venture ended with his death in 303/915, the Qarmatians of Bahrayn continued to be a cause of concern for the Fatimids and the ÆAbbasids alike. In fact, their messianic aspirations escalated to the point that first, in 317/930, they snatched the Black Stone from the KaÆba in Makka and, second, the following year, they announced the appearance of the ‘god incarnate’ in the figure of a certain Abu al-Fadl. The Bahrayni strand of the Qarmatian movement survived until 470/ 1077, despite frustration and hindered messianic expectations. In 322/934, al-Mahdi died and was succeeded by his son, who took the dynastic name of al-Qa’im (d. 334/946). Al-Qa’im’s intention to continue his\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n17\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n18 ]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nfather’s political and religious programme was hindered by a prolonged antiFatimid revolt instigated by the Berber Zenata leader, Abu Yazid. According to a Fatimid, and therefore possibly biased source, Abu Yazid’s plan to eliminate political-religious adversaries involved also the imprisonment, rape and killing 1 of their women and children. The revolt was eventually crushed in 336/947 by al-Qa’im’s successor, al-Mansur. This imam-caliph brought Sicily under Fatimid influence, founded a new capital, al-Mansuriyya, and reinforced the bond between the operations of daÆwa and the judiciary as exemplified by the offices held by the Fatimid jurist and dÅÆÈ, al-Qadi al-NuÆman. Al-Mansur was also involved in negotiations with the Qarmatians for the return of the Black Stone to Makka, which they finally gave back in 339/950. Under his reign, lectures on IsmaÆili jurisprudence were delivered to the general public in the Great Mosque of Qayrawan and, later, in the main mosque of al-Mansuriyya. The so-called Sessions of Wisdom (majÅlis al-˙ikma), restricted to initiates, were held instead in a special room of the caliphal palace in al-Mansuriyya. Al-Mansur died prematurely in 341/953 and was succeeded by his son, al-MuÆizz (d. 365/975). Al-MuÆizz is credited with transforming the Fatimid caliphate from a regional power into one of imperial proportions. Having inherited a region pacified by his father, al-MuÆizz favoured the intensification of the daÆwa activities outside the Fatimid dominions, seeking a rapprochement with the Qarmatians as well as other IsmaÆili communities in Persia and Central Asia. He was responsible for the promulgation and implementation of a distinctive IsmaÆili law, mainly formulated by al-Qadi al-NuÆman, which aimed at imprinting with an IsmaÆili character every aspect of life. Finally, al-MuÆizz could concentrate on territorial expansion to the detriment of the Fatimids’ illustrious rivals, that is, the Umayyads of Spain, the Byzantines of Constantinople and above all the ÆAbbasids of Baghdad. In 358/969, this expansion culminated in the conquest of Egypt masterminded by the general Jawhar and the foundation of a new Fatimid capital, al-Qahira (literally ‘the Victorious’, henceforth Cairo). Having left the vassal Zirid dynasty to act as Fatimid lieutenants in Ifriqiya, in 362/973 al-MuÆizz moved the headquarters of the caliphate to the new capital, with the intention of extending the Fatimid influence over the eastern Mediterranean region. Under al-MuÆizz’s son and successor, al-ÆAziz (d. 386/996), court life flourished and the Fatimid dynasty (dawla) reached its political, territorial and economic zenith. As for the daÆwa organisation, it evolved into a core institution of the Fatimid regime. By al-ÆAziz’s time, the dÅÆÈs came to be formally organised into a complex hierarchical structure headed by a chief dÅÆÈ. From Cairo, the imam-caliph seconded dÅÆÈs to covertly set up new ‘cells’ in regions outside Fatimid control, as well as to overtly run the existing ‘cells’\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n18\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nWorking the Propaganda Spindle\n\n[ 19\n\nscattered around Fatimid domains. From the provinces, the dÅÆÈs would return to Cairo for instructions but also to deliver to the imam-caliph the dues, no matter 2 how small, collected in his name. By the end of al-ÆAziz’s caliphate, Fatimid sovereignty and IsmaÆili daÆwa activities extended from North Africa and Sicily to Palestine and parts of Syria, as well as parts of the Hijaz and the Yemen. In theory, it was the imam-caliph who would ultimately determine the rank each missionary would be allocated on the basis of the level of his esoteric spiritual attainment, scholarly credentials and seniority, as well as political and managerial skills. These were indeed the criteria drawn in the rare references in early IsmaÆili literature to the training and the ideal qualities of the dÅÆÈs. In practice, and especially in outposts away from the heart of the dawla, the management of the distribution of ranks was deputised to the local chief dÅÆÈ, who was de facto in charge of particular areas of operation or ‘islands’ (jazÅ’ir). Following al-ÆAziz’s death, the reign of his son, al-Hakim (d. 411/1021), was marred by political, doctrinal and economic turmoil. The imam-caliph alHakim addressed these crises by resorting to a series of controversial measures, many of which affected the life of women (see Chapter 6). Al-Hakim’s seemingly irrational behaviour came to be seen by many as a sign of questionable sanity and yet it would appear to others as a sign of his supernatural powers. In 408/1017, activists preached belief in al-Hakim’s divinity, a move that mobilised the daÆwa leadership to counteract the spreading of such doctrines. Known as the Druzes, after their founder, al-Darzi, the movement experienced persecution at the hands of al-Hakim’s son and successor, al-Zahir (d. 427/ 1036) and, once banished from Egypt, its members resettled in Syria and Lebanon, where small communities exist to this day. The problems that affected al-Hakim’s reign were inherited and temporarily resolved by al-Zahir. It was, however, during the long reign of al-Mustansir (r. 427–87/1036–1094) that major political, institutional and economic upheavals signalled the start of the dynasty’s irretrievable decline. On the international front, the Fatimids lost control over important territories. In Ifriqiya, after over seventy years of loyalty, in 440/1048 the Zirids, under al-MuÆizz b. Badis, switched their allegiance to the ÆAbbasids; eventually, the Fatimids regained control of the area but did not secure it. Al-Mustansir witnessed with concern the rise in the east of a new powerful dynasty, the Saljuq Turks of Persia. It was, however, during his reign that, in 450/1058, the Fatimids’ sovereignty was formally acknowledged, albeit briefly, in Baghdad. Nevertheless, after decades of tenuous hold, Syria and Palestine were finally lost to the ÆAbbasids and the Saljuqs. Finally, Sicily came under Norman rule in 463/1070–1. On the domestic front, the reoccurence of devastating famines and epidemics, which intermittently hit Egypt during the eleventh century, highlighted a state of social, political and adminstrative collapse. We are told that women of\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n19\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n20 ]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nthe harem were forced to beg in the streets, that plump-legged women were eaten alive, and that women exchanged their finest jewellery for a handful of flour. Exaggerated as they may seem, these accounts show that chroniclers measured the index of efficacy of the dynasty by the scale of the predicaments affecting its subjects, including women.. Politically speaking, the growing power of the viziers reduced that of the caliph to be merely nominal, with consequences also for the prestige of the daÆwa. Moreover, signs of tension between powerful viziers and influential dÅÆÈs are reflected in the uneasy relationship between the vizier al-Yazuri (d. 450/1058) and the most prominent dÅÆÈ of the time, al-Mu’ayyad fi’l-Din al-Shirazi (d. 470/1078). It was, however, the arrival in Cairo in 466/1074 of the powerful Armenian vizier Badr al-Jamali that marked the defining moment in the transference of effective power to the vizier. Beyond the political sphere, this change would affect a broad range of domains including genealogical issues, dynastic marriage patterns, the influence of the harem, the female use of wealth and the landscaping of Cairo. In the Fatimid capital, the functions and activities of the daÆwa became significantly reduced, so much so that, after al-Mu’ayyad, no major dÅÆÈ figure can be found operating from the Cairo headquarters for the duration of the dynasty until its end in 567/ 1171. On the other hand, at the periphery of the empire and in neighbouring regions, such as the Yemen, Syria and Persia, propaganda activites increasingly flourished in the aftermath of dynastic succession disputes that led to the emergence of varied branches within IsmaÆilism. In the Yemen, the Sulayhid dynasty ruled on behalf of the Fatimids from 439/1047–8 to 532/1138. Its founder was ÆAli b. Muhammad al-Sulayhi (d. 459/1067), a ShafiÆi convert to IsmaÆilism who had brought the whole of the Yemen south of SanÆa’ under his control after a series of successful military campaigns. Following ÆAli’s murder, his son alMukarram (d. 477/1084) succeeded him; but, due to his illness, it was his wife, Arwa, who de facto held the reins of power till the end of the Sulayhid dynasty (see Chapter 4). Following the death of al-Mustansir in 487/1094, a succession dispute brought about a major political and doctrinal split within IsmaÆilism. Al-Mustansir had appointed his eldest son, Abu Mansur Nizar, to succeed him as imam-caliph. However, al-Afdal, who succeded his father Badr al-Jamali as vizier and commander of the army, sought to manipulate the issue of accession to the caliphate to secure his hold on power and his control over the palace. By backing the succession of Abu’l-Qasim Ahmad, who was Nizar’s younger brother, alAfdal overruled Nizar’s designation on the ground that a subsequent appointment had been made in favour of Abu’l-Qasim. By doing so, al-Afdal succeeded in placing his protégé on the Fatimid throne, with the dynastic name of alMustaÆli (d. 495/1101). Nizar’s attempts to challenge his brother by staging a\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n20\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nWorking the Propaganda Spindle\n\n[ 21\n\nresistance in Alexandria came to nothing and he finally died in 488/1095. In time, the IsmaÆilis of Persia, Syria and Central Asia came to uphold Nizar’s imamate and that of his successors. Under the leadership of the Persian Hasan-i Sabbah (d. 518/1124) and the Syrian Rashid al-Din Sinan, the Nizaris gave shape to a distinctive brand of IsmaÆilism (daÆwa jadÈda) that was doctrinally, organisationally and politically independent from Cairo. From Crusaders’ accounts, the Nizaris became known in the West as ‘the Assassins’ because of the practice attributed to them of murdering their enemies, allegedly under the effect of drugs. Despite suffering near-extinction at the hands of the Mongols by the mid thirteenth century, the Nizari tradition survived and has prospered to this day, as witnessed by the Shiæa Imami IsmaÆili community, whose spiritual leader is H. H. Karim Aga Khan IV. By contrast, the IsmaÆilis of Egypt, the Yemen and western India acknowledged al-MustaÆli’s imamate. In 495/1101, al-MustaÆli was succeeded by his five-year-old son al-Amir, with al-Afdal effectively acting as regent. Following the death of al-Afdal in 515/1121, al-Amir regained power and, under his rule, the daÆwa activities focused on the refutation of the Nizari claims. His efforts, however, backfired as in 524/1130 the Nizaris assassinated him. The succession disputes that followed brought about yet another major spilt in the daÆwa. One group – the ÓÅfiΩiyya – supported the succession of al-Amir’s cousin, who eventually adopted the dynastic name of al-Hafiz (d. 544/1149). The other group – the Êayyibiyya – upheld the rights of al-Tayyib, a presumed infant son of al-Amir, as the rightful successor. The Tayyibi cause found its main supporters in the IsmaÆili Sulayhid dynasty in the Yemen, under the leadership of queen Arwa, and the Tayyibis prospered both in the Yemen and India. Today, the mainly India-based Da’udi Bohras perpetuate their tradition. The Hafizis instead lost all impetus. With al-Hafiz’s successors al-Zafir (d. 549/1154), alFa’iz (d. 555/1160) and al-ÆAdid (d. 567/1171) little more than puppets in the hands of powerful and scheming viziers, the Hafizi tradition effectively ended in 567/1171, with the demise of the Fatimid regime at the hands of the famous Saladdin. 2. Women and DaÆÆ wa in the Pre-Fatimid Period There are still many conflicting arguments as to the organisation, the aims and extent of formalisation of the IsmaÆili daÆwa. While IsmaÆili sources devote limited space to the practical working of the daÆwa and of its ranks, there is abundant literature dealing with its metaphysical and philosophical dimensions. There is no doubt, however, that both the structure of the daÆwa and the modus operandi of its dÅÆÈs developed over time and varied according to historical, doctrinal and geographical context. An awareness of such a\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n21\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n22 ]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\ndevelopment provides us with the rationale for subdividing the coverage of the link between the daÆwa and women into three main sections. These correspond to the three main phases in the history of the Fatimid period already mentioned.. By and large, the daÆwa was and remained a male domain, and it is only through a careful sifting of the sources that a thus-far-overlooked female contribution to its activities can at last be brought to light. a. Trade and Family IsmaÆili sources dealing with the activities of the early IsmaÆili propagandists highlight the secret and clandestine character of their mission, thus leading us to perceive the dÅÆÈs as private and reserved persons, who lived constantly on guard. According to these sources, the dÅÆÈs were instructed to carefully scrutinise prospective followers, to resort to religious dissimulation (taqiyya), reveal inner doctrines to none but a selected few and to disclose the identity of the imam only after securing a sincere and full commitment to the mission on the part of the initiate. A high degree of caution on their part was indeed justifiable, as persecution and repression of their cause came from many sides. The ÆAbbasids sought to curb any group that challenged their authority as spiritual and secular leaders of the Muslim community, while within the IsmaÆili movement itself, doctrinal disputes among groups raged with predictable consequences. Yet, against all the odds, the dÅÆÈs carried out their mission, often eluding their enemies by leading a conventional lifestyle and, ostensibly, observing the law of the land they lived in. To be successful, a missionary needed to have insider knowledge of the territory in which he operated, of its citizens and their likelihood to convert. This entailed not only long periods of residence, but also a continuous exposure to a wide spectrum of people. Under these circumstances, the leading of a ‘normal’ lifestyle provided the dÅÆÈ with the best camouflage for his propaganda activities; it is as part of this unconspicuous lifestyle that women played an important, albeit mainly passive, role as companions, audience, helpers and role models in the service of the early daÆwa. The modus vivendi and operandi of a dÅÆÈ, not unlike that of other individuals, revolved around two poles: work and family. Sources point to the fact that, from the onset of the propaganda campaign, trading was the most common profession of those who operated underground in the name of the IsmaÆili cause. The Fatimid IsmaÆili tradition portrays ÆAbd Allah the Elder, reputedly the first of the ‘hidden’ imams, as being ‘in appearance … an ordinary merchant’ in 3 Salamiyya. Moreover, al-Husayn, identified by the IsmaÆili tradition as alMahdi’s father, is mentioned as circulating (as a trader) among the women of 4 Salamiyya. In turn, al-Mahdi is reported to have worked as a cloth merchant in Syria and to have carried on this profession until his enthronement as the first\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n22\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nWorking the Propaganda Spindle\n\n[ 23\n\nFatimid imam-caliph in Ifriqiya. Similarly, in ninth-century Persia, the dÅÆÈ Khalaf was reportedly an expert embroiderer who succeeded in converting a 5 number of men and women. Likewise, in Bahrayn, the dÅÆÈ Abu SaÆid alJannabi earned a living as a merchant. Through trade, dÅÆÈs had an identifiable role within the community, they could easily mingle with people, attract converts and, while earning a living, were able to carry out intelligence work. Trade represents a useful domain where one can seek to appraise women’s involvement in the early daÆwa activities, for these merchant-dÅÆÈs women were the first point of contact as potential customers, as local informants and as audience for their propaganda. With reference to the beginning of the IsmaÆili daÆwa, the late tenth–early eleventh-century Persian Fatimid dÅÆÈ al-Nisaburi retrospectively states: ‘They [the dÅÆÈs] travelled … carrying with them on their donkeys different wares, such as pepper, aromatic plants, spindles, mirrors, frankincense, and different kinds of millinery that find demand among women’.6 Women (but also men) who frequented markets and attended typically female gathering places were also likely sources of local news and gossip, thus lending themselves – perhaps unwittingly – to be perceived as useful informants by the dÅÆÈs. Al-Nisaburi continues, ‘Whenever children and women came around them [the dÅÆÈs], they would ask these whether there was in their locality a person 7 answering such-and-such description.’ Indeed, according to IsmaÆili tradition, when, in Syria, the dÅÆÈs went searching for ÆAbd Allah the Elder, who was hiding from his enemies, it was a woman who informed them of his whereabouts. Along with work, the other domain in the life of the dÅÆÈ, which allowed him to carry out his mission while conducting a normal life, was the family. Early IsmaÆili books of guidance on the ideal qualities of the dÅÆÈ recommend that his wives and daughters should act as models of virtue and piety for the community, thus leading us to infer that the women in his household played an important role with regard to the image the dÅÆÈ projected of himself. Indeed, to educate his family and instil in its members moral values and good manners were two among the duties the IsmaÆili missionary was expected to comply with. Also, in order not to make himself and his family conspicuous, the dÅÆÈ was advised to ensure that all family members were up-to-date with the payment of the prescribed alms-giving tax (zakÅt). On their part, the women of the household were expected to be trustworthy and show loyalty to the IsmaÆili cause. Ideally, the dÅÆÈ’s house was meant to be a safe haven, a port of call and a meeting place for his associates, their wives and their children. Accordingly, to complete this image of respectability and trustworthiness, IsmaÆili guidance books stress the importance for a dÅÆÈ to be surrounded by honourable staff and house personnel, typically including a secretary, a chamberlain and a doorkeeper (bawÅb). This was deemed necessary not only because in his house the dÅÆÈ would discuss secret doctrinal matters that should not be divulged to the\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n23\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n24 ]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\nnon-initiate, but also to ensure that women and children attending his house felt safe from harassment.8 As for the women the dÅÆÈ should employ in his house, beside his wives, they should either be relatives whom he would commit to marry according to sharÈÆa rulings or be his slaves’ wives. b. Marrying into the Mission In keeping with both past and present Muslim social conventions, an unmarried man was perceived as an oddity. In the specific case of a missionary, to be celibate would undoubtedly make him conspicuous, with negative consequences for an effective running of his daÆwa activities. For instance, the fact that Abu ÆAbd Allah al-ShiÆi had remained unmarried for a long time puzzled a great deal the Kutama tribesmen that he was trying to convert, so much so that he gave in to pressure and took as a companion a slave-girl who formerly 9 belonged to the harem of the chief of the Mazata Berbers. Marriage served as a bonding agent between missionaries who were active in distant outposts and to build unity across the daÆwa ‘cells’, while also strengthening trade links. According to Idris ÆImad al-Din, ÆAbd Allah the Elder, before moving to Salamiyya, was an activist living in Chalus, on the southern shore of 10 the Caspian Sea, where he had a consort. The same source states that Mansur 11 al-Yaman married the daughter of another dÅÆÈ, Ahmad b. al-KhaliÆ. He is also reported to have married in SanÆa’ the orphaned daughter of a ShiÆi rebel and to 12 have won the entire family over to the daÆwa. The dÅÆÈ al-Haytham, whom Mansur al-Yaman sent to north-west India, is said to have been the cousin of one of Mansur’s wives. The daughter of the prominent dÅÆÈ Firuz, called Umm Abi’l13 Husayn, married Muhammad, the son of the important dÅÆÈ Abu ÆAli. Following a practice going back to the time of the prophet Muhammad, marriages served the purpose of forging tribal or family alliances and, therefore, gaining converts. Marriage alliances proved particularly effective among the Qarmatians. ÆAbdan himself was either married to Hamdan Qarmat’s sister or Qarmat was married to the sister of ÆAbdan. The case is widely reported of Abu SaÆid al-Jannabi having become a Qarmatian as a result of his marriage in Kufa to a woman of a Qarmatian family, the Bani al-Qassar. Similarly, the marriage of al-Jannabi’s daughter with a member of the Bani Zarqan helped to consolidate Qarmatian political and military alliances. In Bahrayn, al-Jannabi formed marriage alliances with the Ibn Sanbar brothers, who were among his first followers.14 Marrying into the daÆwa brought a dÅÆÈ’s wife honours, financial benefits and recognition but it could also entail risks in that she shared her husband’s misfortune. For instance, Mu’mina, the dÅÆÈ Zakarawayh’s wife, was publically humiliated by the victorious ÆAbbasids by being paraded in Madina, dressed in a\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n24\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nWorking the Propaganda Spindle\n\n[ 25\n\nsilken attire and wrap, in front of her husband’s corpse, in retaliation for the role that she had played in supporting her husband’s missionary activities.15 c. Female Loyalty and Guile IsmaÆili literature apologetically praises the bravery of some women in the entourage of ÆAbd Allah, the future al-Mahdi. Whilst hiding in Syria, because of persecution by the ÆAbbasids and Zakarawayh, al-Mahdi was able to maintain contacts with the outside world thanks to the loyalty and efforts of a number of trustworthy persons at his service, some of them women. One such woman was Umm ÆAli al-Qahramana (lit. the housekeeper), who, loyal to her master, embarked, with another woman, on a potentially perilous journey from Salamiyya to Ramla to take care of al-Mahdi’s child, Abu’l-Qasim (the future imamcaliphal-Qa’im). She was originally a Christian who had converted to Islam, and the wife of Abu YaÆqub, also a slave of al-Mahdi. She died in al-Mahdiyya and her grandson was to become head chef at the court of al-ÆAziz. When alMahdi’s enemies reached Ramla, they went looking for another woman at his service, LaÆb. As al-Mahdi’s chief servant, LaÆb knew more than anybody else where her master was and, more importantly, where his fortunes were being kept. Having served al-Mahdi for some time as well as, before him, his uncle or guardian, Muhammad b. Ahmad, La‘b refused to collaborate with the enemies 16 and she paid for her loyalty with her life and those of her children. Women also showed their loyalty to the IsmaÆili mission in other ways. For example, Qarmatian women, like men, contributed to the financing of the daÆwa. It is reported that, during ÆAbdan’s time, both men and women used to pay a tax called qu†ra, amounting to one dirham. Eventually both men and women were required to give a fifth of their possessions and women, specifically, would 17 contribute by giving a fifth of carded wool. Anecdotes reflecting women’s dedication and loyalty to the daÆwa, along with their guile, are occasionally found in anti-IsmaÆili sources, included in narratives featuring factional disputes within early IsmaÆilism. References to women served as a narrative device either to pass a comment on the male protagonist of the story or to fill a gap in the sequence of the events recounted. In his coverage of the origins of the Qarmatians, the famous tenth-century historian al-Tabari resorts, in one of his narratives, to the inclusion of a female character in order to explain the roots of certain beliefs ascribed to this group. Al-Tabari explains that some Qarmatians believed that their founder, Karmita, had miraculously been taken to heaven. The story goes that Karmita was inviting people to pray 50 times a day. Fearing that his preaching would disrupt the work of the farmers labouring in his estates, a certain al-Haysam locked Karmita in a room of his house with the intention of killing him. However, al-Haysam got\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n25\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\n26 ]\n\nWomen and the Fatimids in the World of Islam\n\ndrunk and fell asleep. At this point a maidservant, who was a sympathiser of the preacher, fooled her master by stealing the room’s key, thus freeing the preacher and then replacing the key in its original place. When al-Haysam went to open the room the next day, he found it empty. As a result, the rumour spread that Karmita had been raised to heaven. Another instance of the ‘woman’s clever ploy’ motif emerges from another story also reported by al-Tabari. Around 286/ 899, the dÅÆÈ Zakarawayh was persecuted by the ÆAbbasids, as well as the Qarmatians, because of his initial support for al-Mahdi’s cause. To abscond from his enemies, the dÅÆÈ hid in the house of his brother-in-law, where a woman would cleverly place a movable furnace in front of the entrance to Zakarawayh’s hiding place every time his persecutors came searching for him. The ruse was so successful that, according to the brother-in-law’s testimony, Zakarawayh 18 remained hidden in this way for as long as four years. In Bahrayn, following the death of the dÅÆÈ al-Jannabi around 300/912–13,, the Qarmatian leadership was taken over by his sons, the youngest of whom, Abu Tahir Sulayman (d. 332/944) declared a young Persian man, Abu’l-Fadl alIsfahani, to be the ‘god incarnate’. In the coverage of this curious episode in Qarmatian history, ample space is given to the role that women played in ‘resolving’ the controversy that followed Abu Tahir’s declaration. In fact, whether factual or anecdotal, what transpires from the narrative covering the events surrounding the demise of Abu’l-Fadl, is that it was essentially down to a woman, Abu Tahir’s mother, to expose the gullability of the Qarmatian leaders and to have the courage to do something about it. According to a number of accounts, this Abu’l-Fadl had disposed of several leading representatives of the Qarmatian daÆwa, including the husband of Zaynab, sister of Abu Tahir Sulayman. Having done that, Abu’l-Fadl took Zaynab as his wife and killed her son. At this point, the mother of Abu Tahir, Farha, with the backing of an old dÅÆÈ, took the initiative to test Abu’l-Fadl’s claim of divinity and to have him killed should he prove not to be the ‘god incarnate’. Apparently, Farha faked her death and her son was dispatched to ask Abu’l-Fadl for a miracle to bring her back to life. As he refused or could not perform the miracle, Abu’l-Fadl was exposed as a conman and Abu Tahir was ordered to kill him. However, Abu Tahir refused, fearing that Abu’l-Fadl would use his powers to transform him into something else. In the end, it was SaÆid, Abu Tahir’s brother, who killed the ‘god incarnate’. Once the people were satisfied that Abu’l-Fadl was really dead, Zaynab is reported to have cut his body open, ripped out his liver and ate it.19 The whole episode resulted in a massive embarassment for the Qarmatian leadership. The overall scarcity of sources providing historical information on the inner workings of the various strands of the early, pre-Fatimid daÆwa prevents us from forming a more comprehensive picture of specific active roles that dÅÆÈs, let\n\nCortese_02_Ch1\n\n26\n\n8/22/06, 9:49 AM\n\nWorking the Propaganda Spindle\n\n[ 27\n\nalone women, might have played. As shown above, most of the data on women available for this period are derived from later sources and refer primarily to the activities of the Qarmatians, thus giving the impression that Qarmatian women, more than others, were active participants within their group. However, their portrayal, coming as it did from hostile sources, was overall a negative one. AlTabari reports that Qarmatian women took part in raids against Makkan pilgrim caravans. After the attacks, accompanied by their children, they would deceptively offer water to the moribund pilgrims, only to finish them off if they 20 showed any sign of life. These and other accounts fuelled the imagination of medieval anti-IsmaÆili writers, who conjured up images of furious orgies, wife-swapping, incest and illicit births taking place among the Qarmatians. Suffice here to report the accusation that the Qarmatians of Bahrayn celebrated a night called imÅmiyya, during which men exchanged wives and the children conceived as a result were 21 called ‘the brethren’s children’. In fact, contrary to this perceived licenciousness, the text of the Qarmatian oath of allegiance points to moral rectitude in marital affairs by including an injunction to the adept to remain with his spouse till death, thus discouraging the practice of divorce.22 In keeping with the stereotypical portrayal of antinomian movements, hostile writers often accused IsmaÆili activists of breaking away from the prescriptions of Islamic law. The fourteenth-century Yemeni ShafiÆi jurist and historian al-Janadi colourfully reports that when al-Mahdi’s former associate Ibn al-Fadl entered SanÆa’ in 299/ 911, he blocked all the rain-flow channels and flooded the main mosque. He then ordered the captured women to be taken there ‘unveiled and naked’. Looking down from the minaret, he chose the ones he liked and dishonoured them. According to al-Janadi, Ibn al-Fadl also captured a huge number of women in Zabid and eventually ordered his troops to kill them, fearing that the women would entice the soldiers and divert them from fighting their war. AlJanadi sums Ibn al-Fadl up by saying that he legalised things prohibited and describes scenes of an orgy where, in the dark, men could take any woman, older or younger, irrespective of the Qur’anic prohibitions. Sardonically, al-Janadi hints that not all women resented the ordeal, and he refers to an old woman who would not let go of her younger man after their encounter!23"
