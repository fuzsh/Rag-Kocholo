        "text": "As a PR, nothing beats the satisfaction of seeing your hard work appreciated and executed flawlessly. I prepared a speech for YBM Gobind, Minister of Digital, this time it's for the DE Rantau Elevate 2024 event, and it was read word for word. Not forgetting the speech for our very own MDEC Chairman, YB Syed Ibrahim Syed Noh too. YBM announced major updates to the DE Rantau programme, further cementing Malaysia's position as a top destination for digital nomads. Here are the key highlights: 🌟 The DE Rantau Nomad Pass is now expanded to include a diverse range of professionals beyond the IT and digital sectors. Founders, CEOs, COOs, tax accountants, legal counsels, technical writers, business development managers, public relations professionals, and other related roles, whether they are digital freelancers or remote workers, can now apply. 🌟 The minimum income requirement for these non-IT/digital talents is set at USD60,000 per year or USD5,000 per month. 🌟 In a family-friendly move, parents of the main applicant can now be dependents. This initiative is a significant step towards making Malaysia a hub for global digital talent, fostering an inclusive and dynamic digital economy. Yeap, extracted these pointers from the speeches. Kudos to everyone involved in making DE Rantau Elevate 2024 a success! #DERantau #DigitalNomads #MDEC #MalaysiaDigital #RemoteWork #DigitalEconomy #PRLife #nationbuilding\n\nI am deeply grateful for the recent media coverage by PR INDONESIA Group that spotlighted my career journey. Having my professional trajectory highlighted in such a manner truly serves as a recognition of the collective efforts and experiences that have shaped my path —from the aviation & aerospace🛩️, logistics & material handling automation 🏗️, to financial technology 📲 The opportunity to share my story with the #PRIndonesia audience allows me to reflect on the challenges overcome, the lessons learned, and the unwavering support from mentors, coworkers, and friends. This coverage not only acknowledges personal achievements and my versatility working in #communication in various industries, but also underscores the importance of perseverance, humility, and continuous growth📈 I extend my appreciation to Ratna Kartika muhamad yamin for recognizing and amplifying the story as well as the warm welcome and conversation we had in Jakarta. This coverage reinforces the belief that everyone’s journey is unique, takes (a long!) detours and is full of surprises. By sharing my story, I contribute to a more inclusive storyline within the communication professional communities. I look forward to the continued exchange of ideas and experiences, learning constantly from others, and fostering a supportive environment for all those, particularly the younglings, pursuing their career aspirations 🤝🏼 Care to read?

It isn't just a policy shift; it's a cultural and economic catalyst. For digital nomads, it's a chance to experience the unique blend of modernity and tradition that Malaysia offers. For Johor Bahru, and specifically for Quayside JBCC, it's an opportunity to shine as a beacon of cosmopolitan living and a global community hub. This influx of digital nomads is set to invigorate the local economy, boosting demand for real estate, retail, and services. For investors and businesses at Quayside JBCC and beyond, this represents a unique opportunity to tap into a growing market of international professionals seeking quality, convenience, and community. Quayside JBCC is being designed from the ground up to offer a 'home away from home' experience, making it the perfect mid-term or even long term stay in the very heart of Johor Bahru's central business district and minutes away from the Woodlands Checkpoint. Offering new beginnings and endless possibilities to these professionals. #DeRantauProgram #DigitalNomad #JohorBahru #QuaysideJBCC #Singapore #Malaysia #RealEstate #Innovation #GlobalCommunity #WorkFromAnywhere https://lnkd.in/gUgxz7J4\n\n𝐈 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲, 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩: 𝐀 𝐋𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐖𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 Last Thursday night, I learned a valuable lesson in prioritizing what truly matters to me. I was supposed to board the last bus from Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur at 11.30pm to meet three incredible ladies for an International Women's Day gathering and to discuss the launch of our Xiao Hong Shu community. However, I made a #mistake. I did not purchase a bus ticket in advance and assumed I could easily get one upon arrival at the station. To my dismay, the bus tickets were sold out, and a man attempted to sell me a scalped ticket at a 25% markup. I hesitated for a moment, weighing my options. After some reflection, I decided to say \"NO\" to the scalper and instead called a GrabCar to return home. I promptly informed the ladies about my situation, and we agreed that I would join the gathering online. While they enjoyed their time together in Kuala Lumpur, I savoured a relaxing evening at a cozy cafe in Johor Bahru. This experience reminded me of the importance of valuing my money, time, and #friendships. By making a wise choice, I was able to save #money, avoid unnecessary stress, and still nurture the #connections that matter most to me. Stay tuned for more updates for my Xiao Hong Shu community, and remember to prioritize what truly matters in your own life. ⭐ Sometimes, the best choices are the ones that allow us to live in harmony with our values and maintain a sense of #balance. #ChrisAnyaTan #Connector #Business #SaveTimeAndMoney #MakingDecisions\n\n#commonsense #industry #maang #practical #wellwisher People say why dont' you go to this & that (Insert your dream MNC among MAANG) ? My simple question is that, those orgs that interview for 5 + rounds for ICT/IC or equivalent roles, do you think they will decrease the entrance bar for anyone ? They have to eventually share their profit, right ? Even if I go there how can you as a discrete or swarm entity, be assured that you can convince them or equivalent to make you part of it Who are you talking with ? Are they among the board of directors of that organization ? They will say, why ? In the best case, they will say - We will give these people entry by acquiring you, rest should be laid off. It means that If they acquire someone as an organization then they will set the same guidelines for everyone who is part of it, right? Because if they normalize entry for even a single one, rest will take an example and demand an entry ticket. Hence,I am trying to be practical in my approaches so that the people who desire such, first establish the first feasible collaboration and then incrementally prove their worth to have further. Dont' get me wrong please, I have talked with many people during these two years of my unemployment and simply know who is bluffing others and who is guiding others towards a practical way. Kindly let me know if i am wrong and I would love to be correct and eventually correct those who shared this information with me.\n\nI am very glad to have met Pak Herwan Ng yesterday. Our conversation started back in early May when I reached out to him to arrange a meetup for a sharing session. That plan finally materialized yesterday. I have grown fond of his writing and his extensive experience in the industry. Pak Herwan Ng is currently an advisor for many public listed companies and AC Ventures, among others. I learned a lot from Pak Herwan. We talked about the market, the executive search industry in Indonesia, and much more. What interested me most was our discussion about the importance of process. Everything takes time, and we must have a great vision, mission, and a strategic mindset to achieve our goals. Our current journey is based on the processes we followed in the past. We spend our lives, sacrifice our hours, and undergo long processes to be where we are now. Just like in our personal lives, we apply this to our work experiences, businesses, and even our hobbies (like running a marathon). All of these endeavors require a process. What kind of process are you aiming for? What goals do you want to achieve? For example, in business, we aim for profitability; in our careers, we strive to have a bigger impact and leave a legacy by becoming C-level executives or directors; in sports, we aim to win and stay healthy. The end goal is very important. Overall, I learned about the importance of strategic thinking, process, integrity, and networking. That two-hour lunch turned out to be one of the best meetings I've had. Thank you, Pak Herwan! #networkisnetworth #networking #founders #process\n\nHello Modern Trade People's Lets Join Us at Modern Trade Connection Indonesia Monthly Casual Gathering # July Edition The Power of Having Professional Communities \"People often ignore the power of communities, until they join one.\" In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to overlook the immense value that communities bring into our lives—both personally and professionally.

But before we dive into the specifics, let's clarify: what exactly is a COP? Think of a COP as a collaborative hub. It brings together individuals across departments and roles, fostering knowledge exchange and best practices. For the first COP session, our focus was on the crucial \"MANCARLI\" strategy - ensuring Safe (Aman), Smooth (Lancar), and Controlled (Terkendali) operations during the upcoming Pemilu 2024 elections. Last week, we had the chance to have an amazing session with the Security Department, a Subject Matter Expert from the National Police, and last but not least is Security Champion from the Station Department. The energy in the room was palpable. Each speaker and participant brimming with experience and insights, actively engaged in a rich exchange of knowledge and best practices. We delved into potential challenges and collectively strategized mitigation measures. Yet we also managed to insert music performances and have quiz sessions to get the excitement of offline and online participants getting chances to bring home vouchers. So, why is a COP like this so valuable? Consider this: 1. Sharing the Secrets: COPs become knowledge treasure troves. Cross-department, brimming with experience, shared insights on potential challenges from managing increased passenger flow to security coordination. This cross-pollination of ideas helped us craft effective mitigation strategies. 2. United We Stand: COPs offer a powerful platform for collaborative problem-solving. Diverse perspectives were brought together, allowing us to collectively identify potential disruptions and brainstorm solutions. This ensures comprehensive and well-rounded approaches to tackling complex challenges. 3. Continuous Improvement: COPs foster a culture of learning and growth. By regularly sharing experiences and successes, we can identify areas for improvement and implement changes. This iterative process ensures our operations are constantly evolving and adapting. 4. Unlocking Employee Potential: COPs empower the team by giving them a voice and a platform to contribute. This sense of ownership and involvement boosts morale and engagement, leading to a more motivated and productive workforce. Now, back to \"MANCARLI\" and Pemilu 2024! By leveraging the collective knowledge and experience shared through the COP, the station department is well-equipped to navigate the upcoming elections with confidence. Commuter safety and smooth travel remain top priorities, and the collaborative strategies developed will be instrumental in achieving just that. #MRTJakarta #UbahJakarta Check my tips for job seeker https://lnkd.in/gyv5PVtz How i got accepted by MRT Jakarta https://lnkd.in/gqktuED5 Get connected and like my post if it brings you more insight or inspiration.
