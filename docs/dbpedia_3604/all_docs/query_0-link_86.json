Written in an elegant hand by a professional scribe and provided with ﬁfty-two line drawings, the manuscript described a four-year trip from Venice to Goa and back again during the seventeenth century. (The manuscript’s provenance is brieﬂy presented in the Introduction.) The Travels and Journal of Ambrosio Bembo remained nearly unknown until 1973, however, when a single drawing, which had been produced for Bembo’s manuscript by the French artist G. J. Grélot, was examined in a book by Anthony Welch published by the Asia Society.1 In the following year, Grélot’s drawings of the great seventeenth-century plaza, the Naqsh-i Jahan (Image of the World) in Isfahan, Iran, were shown in a ﬁlm commissioned by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Harvard University Museums. At that time, Clara Bargellini and Anthony Welch, believing that Bembo’s story deserved to be well known, began a collaborative eﬀort to publish an English-language translation of the text in a fully annotated and illustrated edition that would make Bembo’s text available to an international audience. A few words about transliteration are in order. Bembo tried carefully to render words and names in his native Italian. Rather than convert his transliterations from Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, or other languages into\n\n1.

Both Anthony Welch and Clara Bargellini wish to acknowledge the patient enthusiasm for this project from Jack Parker and Carol Unger of the Bell Library. Likewise, we are grateful for support from our respective academic institutions: Anthony Welch from the University of Victoria, Canada, and Clara Bargellini from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. We are very pleased to acknowledge the early sharp-eyed attention to this project from Stanley Holwitz of the University of California Press, who immediately understood the signiﬁcance of Bembo’s work and its implications for a greater understanding of the relationship between western Europe and the Islamic world in the seventeenth century. More recently, we were fortunate to have skilled editorial attention from Randy Heyman, Suzanne Knott, and Suzanne Copenhagen. Huge gratitude goes to Professor Howard Crane at Ohio State University for his exacting perusal of Bembo’s travels through the Ottoman Empire and for his catching errors both large and small: thanks to his generous gift of time and expertise, this is a better book. Most of all we thank our spouses, HyeSoon and Gabriel, to whom we dedicate this book. As we worked on the project, they learned more about Bembo than they ever dreamed they would. Fortunately, they seem to have appreciated him as much as we have.\n\nxii\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nn ins\n\nula\n\nZante Kíthira\n\ne d S\n\nVenice to India.\n\nRe\n\n0 200 400 600 km\n\n.\n\nArabia\n\nia\n\nQishn\n\nu lf\n\nCape Musandum Oman\n\nnG\n\nHormuz\n\nDiu Surat Daman Bassein Mumbai\n\nMughal Empire\n\nN\n\nSri Lanka\n\nColombo\n\nCalicut\n\nDeccan\n\nMahim\n\nCambay\n\nGoa\n\nKutch\n\nR. us\n\nCentral Asia\n\nAr a b ia n Sea\n\nBirecik Diyarbakir Hasankeyf Izmir Iskenderun Tig Cizre ri Mosul Nicosia Aleppo Samarra Crete Baghdad Eu Safavi Empire Cyprus ph Larnaca s Basra R.

Without the books of the thirteenth-century Venetian Marco Polo or his seventeenth-century compatriot Pietro della Valle, our knowledge of historic West and South Asia would be far poorer. Even in the seventeenth century, extended travel outside one’s own linguistic and cultural milieu was far from commonplace, although knowledge gained from travel was increasingly recognized as a valuable commodity. Travelers such as Sir John Chardin or Jean-Baptiste Tavernier were primarily merchants trying to expand commercial ties with Iran and India; they were also keen and critical observers who took the time to write lengthy and detailed accounts of their travels after they returned home.1 Emissaries such as English diplomats Sir Thomas Herbert and Thomas Roe wrote memoirs that recorded their observations and some of their oﬃcial dealings,2 whereas members of Christian religious orders such as the learned Capuchin father Raphaël du Mans in Iran\n\n1.

The literate public in contemporary Europe appears to have had a pronounced interest in the great Islamic monarchies to the east.4 A few individuals also appear to have traveled solely for personal ediﬁcation. Pietro della Valle left Venice in June 1614 on a journey that would take him across the eastern Mediterranean to the Syrian coast, overland to Iraq, by sea to the western coast of India, and then back again, although on his return journey he chose to travel overland through Iran to Baghdad. He spent some seven years in Iran and did not reach home again until April 1626. His Viaggi, a voluminous account of his journey written in the form of letters to a learned friend, was published in Italian between 1650 and 1658 and subsequently translated into French, Dutch, and German. Despite its verbosity, both Goethe and Gibbon praised it.5 It also awakened the interest of Ambrosio Bembo, a young Venetian who decided to broaden his own knowledge of the world through travel. On August 8, 1671, Bembo set out on a trip that almost exactly followed della Valle’s route but brought him home sooner, some three years, eight months, and a week later, on April 15, 1675. Not too long after his return, Bembo used notes, drawings, and memory to compose an account of his travels, but it was never published, despite 3.

Holod (Boston: Society for Iranian Studies, 1974), vol. 7, 421–57. 5. The Viaggi has never been completely translated into English. Della Valle’s travels in India were published in 1892 by the Hakluyt Society. A highly readable account of his travels is Wilfrid Blunt, Pietro’s Pilgrimage (London: James Barrie, 1953). A recent edition and study of part of his travels is Antonio Invernizzi, ed., “Pietro della Valle,” in Viaggio per l’Oriente (Torino: Edizioni dell’ Orso, 2001).

J. Grélot, a French artist and Bembo’s traveling companion on his return voyage from Iran to Venice in 1674. As a result, the Travels and Journal through Part of Asia during about Four Years, Undertaken by Me, Ambrosio Bembo, Venetian Noble, is a new document of European perceptions of western and southern Asia that is now fortunately emerging from three centuries of obscurity.6 Bembo realized that his journal could not compete with the travel memoirs of other Venetians such as Marco Polo and della Valle, and he recognized his own and his journal’s deﬁciencies with honest humility: “One should realize, too, that this account might be as boring (if not more so), because it is less distinguished than others. In addition, my youth and inexperience did not permit me to weave an ornamented and ordered story of so many kingdoms and of such great countries. Nevertheless, this diary will be the truthful account of the voyage.” Bembo was born on March 10, 1652, in Venice. He belonged to one of Venice’s most distinguished families and was connected to several other powerful families. The great Renaissance scholar and cardinal Pietro Bembo (1470–1547) was the most famous family member, but other Bembos were also highly placed.7 His uncle Marco, a distinguished military commander, was Venetian consul in Aleppo, the great commercial center of northern Syria, and Orazio Bembo was consul in Cairo. His father was Francesco, and his mother, Caterina, was from the Cornaro family, whose relation had been queen of Cyprus from 1474 to 1489, when she was advised by a previous Marco Bembo. Ambrosio was also related to the Morosini family, who likewise supplied admirals and consuls to the Venetian state. Bembos, Cornaros, and Morosinis, like other leading families in Venice, were deeply involved in the politics and commerce of the eastern Mediterranean and were no strangers to the power and prestige of the Ottoman sultanate, on whose trade much of their own prosperity depended. Although Ambrosio\n\n6. See Anthony Welch, “Safavi Iran as Seen through Venetian Eyes,” in Society and Culture in the Early Modern Middle East, Studies on Iran in the Safavid Period, ed.

The widely used Bembo typeface bears the family name. It was designed about 1495 by the celebrated goldsmith and engraver Francesco Griﬀo for the Venetian publisher and printer Aldus Manutius. Introduction\n\n3\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nBembo was proud of his family, his Travels and Journal seldom refers to them. He seems to have been an open and polite young man, conscious of his social position and its responsibilities but not particularly given to haughtiness. He speaks only once of his upbringing and education, when, near the end of his book, he refers to the new Venetian consul in Aleppo, who succeeded his uncle in 1675: Francesco Foscari, “my friend, fellow student, and older companion in the School of the Somaschi Fathers.”8 Otherwise, his aristocratic family and friends are mentioned only in the ﬁnal pages, when he carefully lists the people who welcomed him on his homecoming. Bembo was enrolled in the Venetian navy when he was very young. At the age of seventeen he took part in the Venetian republic’s conﬂict with the Ottoman sultanate in the last year of the 1648–1669 War of Candia; he was steersman on a galley, the Fontana d’Oro, in the service of a squadron commander. He was young but evidently anxious to distinguish himself in a military post of this sort, and his appointment suggests that he was talented in addition to being well connected. The naval forces were under the command of Taddeo Morosini, whom he calls “the lord of our house and Captain of the Navy.” The Venetian army in Crete was led by Francesco Morosini. During this initial period of service to the republic, Venice suﬀered defeat in 1669 when it withdrew its forces from Crete. Ambrosio’s Morosini relatives continued to assist him during and after his travels. The Venetian ship Conﬁdenza, captained by Taddeo Morosini, took him on the ﬁrst leg of his journey east, and after his return he served under Francesco Morosini in the republic’s 1686–1687 Peloponnesian campaign. But in 1671, with the War of Candia behind him, Ambrosio Bembo was clearly bored. He was too young to enter the Grand Council of Venice, the assembly of the nobility, and he did not want to wait until he was twenty-ﬁve, when he could assume his rightful place there. When his uncle Marco was appointed consul in Aleppo, he invited Ambrosio to accompany him, aware of his nephew’s frustration. They left Venice on August 8, 1671. For Ambrosio it was the beginning of a voyage far longer than he anticipated, and even though his introduction to the Travels and Journal glowingly asserts that\n\n8. A charitable religious organization principally dedicated to education, the Order of the Somaschi Fathers was founded in the sixteenth century by St. Jerome Edmiliani. Prior to the French Revolution, it operated 119 colleges in Rome, Lombardy, Venice, and France. 4\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 5\n\ntravel is edifying and broadening, it seems likely that his original intent was to stay in Aleppo: “The world is a great book, which, when perused attentively, proﬀers teachings and delights with its variety. True, one must tolerate expense, discomfort, and danger, but the eﬀort, if blessed by fortune, brings its reward. Idleness eats away at all virtue and is the worst companion for youth.” Bembo’s Journey\n\nThey arrived in the Levantine port of Tripoli on September 21 and proceeded to Aleppo, which they reached on October 29. Ambrosio remained in Aleppo for ﬁfteen months, until January 1673, and studied the city and its society well enough that his account of these months is a very valuable source of information about the ancient city. Among the illustrations to his book are a splendid panorama of Aleppo and a drawing of the city’s Great Mosque. Bembo provided the names, titles, and responsibilities of the Ottoman oﬃcials, and he obviously found amusing the struggles over precedence and protocol that occupied the lives of the diplomatic corps. He paid particular attention to architecture, carefully describing the city’s gates, walls, doors, bathhouses, and bazaars and reporting that the city had about three hundred mosques. But Bembo grew bored once more, and, excited by the stories about India told him by a visiting Portuguese Franciscan traveling back to Goa, the capital of Portuguese India, he decided to set out for points farther east. Well supplied with money, equipment, letters of credit to merchants and to Capuchin and Carmelite missionaries along the way, Ambrosio left the security of his uncle’s residence in Aleppo for what he knew would be a dangerous journey. “Thus I courageously left the sight of Aleppo and began my trip.” He had good reason to be apprehensive. On January 3, 1673, he set out with a large caravan from Aleppo through southern Turkey to Diyarbakır. From there, he descended the Tigris on a river raft, called a kalak, to Baghdad. Bembo, an experienced sailor, was fascinated by its construction. The wooden frame rested on three goatskins ﬁlled with air; it ﬂoated eﬀectively, if somewhat precariously, on the fastmoving river. In Baghdad the raft was taken apart and sold for its wood. Bembo reported that the famous metropolis of Baghdad had ﬁve city gates and that it took about two and a half hours to walk around the outer walls. He found the streets to be narrow and dirty but praised the large, solidly built bazaars. He was also very impressed with the city’s mosques and their Introduction\n\n5\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 6\n\ncolorful glazed tiles. He resided at the Capuchin mission, and his reliance on the Christian orders and their mission houses continued throughout his trip; in Iraq, Iran, and India he mostly stayed with Capuchins, Augustinians, Theatines, Franciscans, Dominicans, or Carmelites, who were sustaining a Catholic presence and laying the groundwork for subsequent European colonial expansion. After a few days in the city he hired another river raft to take him south to Basra on the Persian/Arabian Gulf. He was very impressed with the high level of commercial activity and with Basra’s diverse population: Arabs, Turks, Indians, Jews, Armenians, Jacobites, and European merchants (Italians, French, English, Dutch, and Portuguese) who came to Basra with spices and jewels from ports in South and Southeast Asia. In Basra he booked passage on a ship that took him to the port of Bandar-i Kong in southeastern Iran, where he was able to ﬁnd another ship that took him to western India, which he reached in April 1673. With the exception of a brief visit to Mumbai (Bombay), he spent more than a year in the various Portuguese colonies on India’s west coast and resided most of the time in Christian mission houses in Daman, Surat, Mumbai, and Goa. He was intrigued by the European strongholds in or adjacent to Gujarat, and he presented an encapsulated history of Gujarat and the great commercial center of Cambai. His source must have been one of the Christian fathers who knew the 1611–1612 Mir’at Sikandar ibn Muhammad, one of the key histories of the region. Like della Valle before him, Bembo chose not to visit the great cities of the Mughal Empire. He was well aware of the military struggle between the emperor Awrangzeb and Shivaji, the brilliant leader of the western India Maratha rebellion against the Mughals; and he may have concluded that inland travel was unsafe. On May 11 in Daman he witnessed the arrival of an ambassador from the Mughal emperor, and on May 12 a rival envoy from Shivaji, the great opponent of Awrangzeb, also came there. The Portuguese were anxious to keep their distance from the conﬂict. So, too, was Bembo, and on May 13 he left for the major commercial entrepôt of Surat, the richest city in India and one of the world’s most active commercial centers. He was keenly interested in the organization of the French, English, and Dutch trading companies and noted that they maintained large fortiﬁed houses for their goods and their citizens. The city’s diversity fascinated him, and he remarked on people who came from several European countries, the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia, and Africa. He was deeply curious about religious doctrines, and he outlined the Hindu caste system and described sadhus and their practices. Everywhere in 6\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nthe city he saw Parsees: “When the Arabs conquered Iran in the seventh century, they ﬂed to India. They worship ﬁre, the sun, and the moon and maintain a constantly burning ﬁre.” Elephants he saw for the ﬁrst time and noted their importance in daily life and in warfare. After a brief stay in Bassein, Bembo went to Mumbai, only recently established by the English East India Company. The port’s size, security, and beauty impressed him enormously, and he correctly assumed that Mumbai and the English would soon become a threat to the Portuguese control of trade with India. After a few days in Mumbai he proceeded to Goa. The Portuguese colony’s Christian missions were rich and powerful, but, he noted, the missionaries were conspicuously inattentive to the poverty of the people and the run-down condition of the city. He stayed in Goa for a number of months, and his book provides detailed information on customs, produce, religious sects, and the activities of the Inquisition. Bembo generally disliked the Portuguese, and he faulted them for racism and intolerance. He seems to have had no regrets when in February 1674 he sailed back across the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf to Bandar-i Kong, which he reached on May 19. The trip across the Arabian Sea was overlong and ﬁlled with apprehension about naval attacks from Oman. Although he knew it would take longer and would be more dangerous, he chose not to return to Basra by ship but to follow della Valle’s example and travel overland from Bandar-i Kong in southern Iran to Shiraz and Isfahan, the capital of the Safavi Empire. His observations on Iran and the Iranians are among the most interesting and important in his book. In Shiraz he remarked on the beauty of the principal mosque but described the appearance of houses and of the main bazaar at greater length: Most of the bazaars are large, beautiful, and majestic, covered by vaults of baked bricks. The houses are low, and from the outside they seem to be poor, because they have earthen walls and no windows along the road. But inside they are of baked bricks and are similar in structure to those of Turkey and Europe. In addition, they are decorated and ornamented with various works in low relief on colored and gilt plaster. The beams, too, are sculptured and painted with much gold. Some also have the walls covered with porcelains.\n\nHe particularly noted the kilometer-long avenue that extended from the city center to the Royal Garden (Bagh-i Shah). One of the traditional centers of Iranian culture, the city had about Introduction\n\n7\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 8\n\n40,000 Muslim households, but Bembo noted that there were also households of other persuasions, notably Armenians, Jews, Nestorians, and other Christians. He praised Shirazis for their love of learning and the arts, and he even commented that their knowledge of the sciences was based upon ancient authors rather than contemporary ones. The city’s steel mirrors and glassware pleased him, and he liked Shirazi perfume so much that he took some back with him to Venice. He also appreciated the good food available in the city: Among all the bazaars the best organized was the bazaar of sweets. They make many of these, and they are of good quality, the equal of our Italian ones. I walked through the bazaar of foods, where they sell all sorts of cooked foods. . . . The bread is rather good and white. They make it in large ﬂat cakes with fennel. The wine is the best in all of Persia. They make a lot of it. Even the present king drinks a lot of it, although it is strictly forbidden to his subjects. All the countries provide themselves with wine for their armies here. They ship it to India. Thus the French, Dutch, English, and Portuguese have a license to buy what they need, as well as an agent who keeps it, and every country has a house where he lives; they keep it well furnished so that it also serves for the lodging of [members of ] their company when they happen to be in that city. The Armenian Giovanni Belli had the commission for the Portuguese. At the proper time he takes the wine to Kong at his expense in cases of ten ﬂasks, each one of which contains a pound and a quarter of wine. The superintendent pays him twenty-ﬁve ‘abbasi per case. He then sells it for double that price to the ﬂeet, and the earnings are for him. However, when the Armenian brings him more, the superintendent is obliged to sell it at ﬁfty ‘abbasi to anyone, and the earnings from that go to the Armenians.\n\nOn July 3, after a week and a half, he left Shiraz and traveled north toward Isfahan with several companions. On the second day they turned oﬀ the Isfahan road to visit the great Achaemenid site of Persepolis, which he described in detail and which Grélot drew. In the façade are two stairways to go up, one from the south and one from the north. They end on a small square level area which is the width of the same stairs. At that point both stairways continue to climb in the opposite direction. . . . In the mountain face abutting the plain and in the middle of the natural crevices there are two structures at some distance from one another. . . . carved in low relief in the mountain itself, . . . various tombs that are commonly called the tombs of Darius. 8\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nHe also visited the nearby Achaemenid and Sasanian site of Naqsh-i Rustam. His journey north from Persepolis was diﬃcult. On July 14 he and his companions stopped for the day at the mountain town of Yazd-i Khvast: “because of the narrowness of the place [it] has houses one on top of the other.” Two days later they reached the extensive ruins of Qumisheh, and his account is particularly valuable since scarcely any of the ancient city is extant today: It was, in eﬀect, a city in ancient times. There are vestiges of many tombs in the form of towers, where one sees many stone lions. There are also remains of many bazaars and caravanserais, of which ten still stand. I went to most of them. . . . I found many kinds of fruit, particularly some very good melons. I saw many ruins of ancient houses and buildings.\n\nHe reached the capital city of Isfahan on July 18 and was immensely impressed by the appearance and wealth of the metropolis early in the reign of Shah Sulayman. I entered a very great plain and saw Isfahan at a distance. It seems rather a delightful wood because of the multitude of trees that obstruct the view of the buildings . . . Before entering the city, I passed a large and very long street, similar to that of Shiraz . . . Along its sides, however, are the walls of the orchards, and along the road itself many trees are distributed in an orderly manner. Water ﬂows on both sides and makes that passage delightful. At the end of this street I crossed a bridge that the Europeans called the Bridge of Shiraz . . . It is all made of ﬁne bricks with twenty-seven small arches. . . . Above the arches there is a very beautiful cornice of porcelain of various design in very ﬁne work.\n\nHe went immediately to the Carmelite mission, which he described as “rather comfortable, with a lower cloister with twelve rooms and with a good dormitory above.” And like other travelers, he referred to Shah ‘Abbas I’s interest in printed books that the Carmelites tried to encourage: “There is a room that served as a printing shop. It was unique in those parts and had been introduced to please the Shah ‘Abbas, who had wanted it. They gave him a printed book of the Four Gospels and an Arabic alphabet, but at present the press is all ruined.” Shortly afterward, he met the aﬀable scholar and Capuchin father Raphaël du Mans, whom Bembo, like the Isfahanis, admired for his knowlIntroduction\n\n9\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nedge of mathematics and of the Persian language. Apparently Bembo did not know that only fourteen years earlier du Mans had been commissioned by the French government to undertake an encyclopedic study of Iran, Estat de la Perse en 1660. In addition to du Mans, there were many other Europeans in the city, among them merchants and artisans. Bembo met some French goldsmiths and watchmakers working for Shah Sulayman: They have their shops near the royal palace. They are much esteemed by the king and well treated. Besides giving them houses and money, he provides them with monthly provisions of every sort of food of the country. The provisions are very abundant, and he also gives them more for every new piece of work that they do. They are at liberty to work for other individuals, whom they charge considerably, when they are not working for the king.\n\nHe also met and took an instant dislike to the merchant and diplomat Jean Chardin, whose manners and deviousness held no appeal for him. Bembo noted that Chardin was well supplied with cash and had already published a book on the coronation of Shah Sulayman. Chardin made no attempt to conceal his maltreatment of G. J. Grélot, a modestly talented French artist whom he had hired to illustrate his own voyages. Because Chardin refused to pay him, Grélot was penniless and could not leave his service and return to Europe. Bembo, who saw the utility of acquiring both a traveling companion who could cook and an artist who could document his journey, oﬀered him a job. Grélot jumped at the chance and joined Bembo with his drawings and talent, leaving Chardin, who was not at all pleased. As a result, only seven of Grélot’s drawings illustrate the Anglo-French traveler’s Voyages, those Chardin presumably held onto after the artist abandoned him. Bembo’s book contains ﬁfty-one Grélot illustrations, including those printed by Chardin. Bembo was enormously impressed with Isfahan’s size, diversity, and architecture. This city is large in itself and also very big due to the three citadels, or suburbs, that are about a mile from the city and can really be called contiguous and united, because they continue the gardens of the city itself. . . . Besides the Persian natives of the city, there are many from subject countries, and there are 12,000 Indians, partly Muslims and partly Gentiles, all rich merchants. . . . In addition to these, Arabs and Turks from many places are engaged in business there. Also from Europe there are Muscovites, Poles, French, English, Portuguese, and Dutch. . . . 10\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nThere are, however, many buildings of good architecture, among which are the caravanserais, which are many, and three hundred baths and quantities of bazaars with large stone arches, arranged in good order. . . . Their main streets are long and beautiful to look at, but the other streets are terrible, since they are not only narrow but also full of refuse and sewage. . . . Another day I went to see the maydan of the Shah . . . This maydan is the King’s Plaza, and it is the principal one in the whole city. For size and beauty it surpasses many of the most beautiful in Europe . . . All around, it is surrounded by a building of equal arches in a double order, one above the other. The arches of the upper level have very beautiful openings with imaginative ornaments of the same material. The [upper] arches serve as dwelling places for merchants, and the lower arches as porticoes under which are bazaars with shops on one side and the other. . . . Near these porticoes runs a stream of water that surrounds the entire plaza. . . . About two-thirds of the way along one of the long sides there is a façade with a gate to the palace of the king, which is not too big in its perimeter, being a little more than a mile. . . . On top of the whole construction there is a very large hall or loggia, open on three sides . . . in it the king gives public audiences to ambassadors and other people, and he banquets there publicly. . . . On the other side of the plaza and facing the palace of the king there is a mosque with dome and façade in ﬁne polychrome porcelain. At both ends of the Square there is a beautiful fountain, and at the side that is closest to the palace there is the royal mosque . . . On the other side there is a large and majestic arch through which one passes to other bazaars. . . . A very beautiful apartment of the king’s that is called Bab-i Bulbul is . . . open on three sides with arches and colonnades that are covered with sheets of Venetian mirrors. . . . The broad road called Ciahar Bagh ends in a beautiful bridge, commonly called the Bridge of Julfa.\n\nBembo described goods, customs, and clothing, and he was fascinated by the doctrinal diﬀerences among the Muslim and Christian populations of Isfahan. He also provided an abridged history of the Safavi dynasty that he presumably learned from du Mans. After more than two months in Isfahan, Bembo, accompanied by Grélot, joined a large caravan and left the city on September 22, traveling toward northwestern Iran. On October 7 they stayed in Kangavar and spent a day wandering around the second- and third-century ruins, which Bembo compared favorably with Persepolis. On October 10 his group lingered at Bisitun, where Bembo admired the rock relief of Darius’s victory over Gaumata. Grélot drew the whole pictorial scene as well as a copy of some Introduction\n\n11\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nof the trilingual inscriptions. On the following day they reached the great Sasanian site of Taq-i Bustan. Bembo was fascinated by the friezes cut into the stone of the two rock grottoes, described them at great length, and helped Grélot produce ﬁve drawings. His detailed account is the earliest illustrated European record of the artistic remains there. Bembo and Grélot were able to join a caravan heading toward Hamadan and Baghdad, and they spent enough time in Baghdad for Grélot to produce a panoramic view of the city. But they were anxious to get back to Aleppo. Marco Bembo’s term as consul was all but over, and Ambrosio did not want to miss the opportunity of traveling home with his uncle. Despite the very real danger of Bedouin attack, Bembo, Grélot, and a single guide decided to ride overland from Baghdad, for the most part along the Euphrates River. They reached Aleppo without incident on November 22, where they were gratefully welcomed by Marco Bembo. They need not have proceeded in such haste after all, however, for the new consul had not yet arrived. Some two months later, once more a member of his uncle’s entourage, Ambrosio left Aleppo on January 30, 1675. The land and sea journey, much of which Grélot rendered in drawings, lasted two and a half months, and they arrived in Venice on April 15, 1674. Bembo changed out of his Turkish clothes, shaved his beard, and was joyfully welcomed home by family and friends. He was twenty-three years old and a world traveler like few others. Two years later he entered the Grand Council of State and subsequently served as a naval oﬃcer in the republic’s military campaigns against the Ottomans. On July 4, 1680, he was appointed commander of a ship, and in 1683 he was promoted to governor of the Adriatic Sea, with the primary charge of keeping out the Barbary pirates. In May 1685 he led a convoy of twenty-two ships to Corfu in support of an army under the command of his relative Francesco Morosini, and in 1686 he was appointed commander in Corfu. It was not a happy post, for in April 1687 he had to defend himself against a charge of abuse of power. Ten years later he was elected superintendent of arms in Venice, and in 1703 superintendent of the arsenal. His health may have suﬀered from these many naval campaigns, for he died in 1705 at the age of ﬁfty-three. He was buried in the Church of San Salvador. His journal is the primary source of information about his life and allows us to glimpse the personality that supported this distinguished, although not atypical, Venetian aristocratic career. His passion for archaeology continued after his journey to the\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nMiddle East and India and was recognized by Bartolomeo Dotti in a sonnet that he dedicated to Bembo.9 The Travels and Journal was composed not long after his return, although he gives no clear indication of exactly when he wrote down his impressions. But after leaving Bembo’s service, Grélot traveled to Constantinople and prepared text and drawings for his own important book on the great city, Relation nouvelle d’un voyage de Constantinople, published in Paris in 1680.10 In discussing the successes of the Venetians against the Ottomans he oﬀers some remarks about the Bembo family: I am the more obliged to make the Relation, as being engag’d in my acknowledgments to those two illustrious Persons to whose kindnesses and company in my Travels I was so peculiarly bound, as being highly honoured in their aﬀection. These were the Lords Mark and Ambrose Bembo, both Gentlemen of Venice, who have always performed great Exploits, and daily add to the Fame and Splendour of the noble and ancient Family of the Bembos. The ﬁrst of these two noble Venetians was General of the Gallies11 of the Commonwealth of Venice in this Expedition. The second is a young Gentleman his Nephew, who at the Age of eighteen years, perceiving that the leisure of the Republic in Peace could not aﬀord him matter suﬃcient to exercise his active Courage, generously quitted the pleasures of a sedentary Life, and betook himself to ﬁve or six years travel over the Eastern World. And in these perils and dangers he the more readily engag’d himself, to the end, that upon his return to his Country with mature Age and well-purchas’d Experience, he might render himself the ﬁtter for such Employments which the Senate might deem worthy his merit. I had the happiness to meet him at Hispahan, returning from the Indies, whence I also had the honour to enjoy his Company all the way into Europe. In pursuance of which Journey, we came ﬁrst into Syria to his most illustrious Uncle Mark Bembo’s Residence, then Embassadour for the Republic, and so at length ariv’d at Venice, where I was shew’d in the Palace of the Bembos the whole Expedition of the\n\n9.

From his own remarks it seems that Ambrosio reread the Viaggi of Pietro della Valle before he even started writing his own account, and he modestly indicated that he was writing for the ediﬁcation of those who might some day want to make a similar trip; for that reason he even appended a detailed expense account so that future travelers would be aware of how much money and what equipment they would need. Knowing that other travel memoirs had been published, he probably had the intention of seeing his own book in print, but he evidently did not pursue this ambition, even though his family’s wealth and status would surely have made it easily within his reach. His book remained in manuscript form, copied in an excellent hand by an unidentiﬁed scribe (ﬁg. 1); some marginal notes, as well as the expense account, in less accomplished penmanship, were presumably Bembo’s own additions. There appear to have been two manuscript copies of Bembo’s book. One passed into the possession of the Gradenigo family in Venice, where it was studied by Iacopo Morelli, who privately printed some remarks about it in 1820.14 In his remarks Morelli noted that there were two copies of Bembo’s manuscript, the one that he examined, which belonged to Joseph Gradenigo, [Fig.1abouthere.]\n\n12.

For a brief discussion of Morelli’s remarks on Bembo’s book, see Maria Francesca Tiepolo, La Persia e la Repubblica di Venezia, no. 134, 59. The Gradenigo copy of Bembo’s book is referred to in the\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nFigure 1. Folio 1 of text.\n\nand a second, apparently abridged, version in the possession of Abbé Celotti. The Gradenigo manuscript with its ﬁfty-two line drawings was examined by M. A. Langlès, whose praise in a letter addressed to the abbé is now bound with the volume. Langlès regretted that he had not been able\n\nentry on Ambrosio Bembo in the Enciclopedia Italiana (Rome: Instituto Giovanni Treccani, 1930) and is clearly to be identiﬁed with our volume.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nto consult it when he was preparing his own edition of Chardin’s travels.15 The Gradenigo manuscript left Paris in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, for its ornate, gold-stamped brown morocco binding is English of that date and bears the inscription “Drawings by Grélot” on the spine. The manuscript’s 316 pages are gilt edged, ruled, and margined; they measure 38 centimeters by 27.5 centimeters. The text is written thirty-two lines to the page, and the paper is ﬁne and heavy, lightly brown in color. Marginal notes include dates of entries and subject indicators to aid the reader. The volume was purchased in 1964 by the James Ford Bell Library of the University of Minnesota from Frank Hammond, Bookseller, Sutton Coldﬁeld near Birmingham, England. The second copy, which belonged to Abbé Celotti, has only recently been rediscovered. History\n\nThe Venice that Ambrosio Bembo knew was a major Mediterranean power, struggling with the Ottomans for empire and control of trade. Its history during the seventeenth century is marked by notable failures, such as the War of Candia, and by equally notable successes, such as the campaigns in Dalmatia and in the Peloponnesos. If war characterized one part of the relationship between Venice and the Ottomans, peace, prosperity, and mutually beneﬁcial commerce deﬁned another. With its Mediterranean maritime presence and its commercial links to western Europe, Venice was dependent upon the Ottoman Empire’s domination of the western terminus of overland trade routes from eastern and southern Asia and from eastern Africa. Ottoman armies or their surrogates controlled Anatolia, Syria, the Levant, Iraq, Arabia, and Egypt, and ﬂeets of the Ottomans or their Arab allies in Oman patrolled the Red Sea, the Persian/Arabian Gulf, and the Arabian Sea. But the days of Ottoman and Arab supremacy over this vital and valuable trade link were numbered. Although Vasco da Gama’s navigation around Africa in 1498 did not engender an immediate commercial revolution, it did lead to the establishment of a string of Portuguese forts and trading settlements on the eastern coast of Africa, and Portuguese colonies such as Sofala, Mozambique, 15. This ten-volume publication (Paris, 1811) was the ﬁrst complete edition of Chardin’s travels and included a volume of plates. 16\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nMombasa, and Malinde challenged long-established Arab mercantile communities in Lamu and Kilwa. It also quickly led to the development of equally valuable Portuguese settlements, such as Diu, Daman, and Goa, along the west coast of India. During the second half of the seventeenth century, this Portuguese expansion was contested by the sultans of Oman, who, supported by the Ottomans, also tried to dominate politics and commerce on the east African coast, for across the Arabian Sea was the west coast of India and, via the Maldive Islands and Sri Lanka, the more-distant routes to eastern India, Southeast Asia, and China. The prize was control over the immensely lucrative spice trade, as well as commerce in many other resources and manufactures, such as ceramics, silk, and textiles. The possible loss of Arab power over this trade was a direct and potentially devastating threat to the Ottomans, whose economy signiﬁcantly depended upon the maritime route that made their lands the transit routes for goods. Thus Ottoman and Arab ﬂeets operated in the Persian/Arabian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, and even the Indian Ocean to counter the expansion and consolidation of Portuguese power. Bembo was well aware of this conﬂict, as well as newer ones with other European powers anxious to take over what the Portuguese had seized. Portugal’s maritime success and its immediate cultural rewards aroused envy and competition. The Dutch were among the most active, but in 1672, shortly before Bembo’s visit, the English East India Company established a permanent military and commercial presence in Mumbai. Although Venice was still an important Mediterranean naval power, it was not an active player in this wider game; it did not have the resources or the population to support a signiﬁcant role beyond the Mediterranean. The young Venetian traveler was therefore recording a period of great political change with long-range implications, but during a time of transition in which Venice now played a lesser part. Bembo was an educated observer, but we cannot reasonably expect someone so young to be a profound or incisive thinker about politics on a grand scale, and like most individuals in a time of change, he did not perceive that it was going on. He did not seem personally aﬀected by or even aware of the enormous long-term damage to Venice’s wealth and to its position as middleman that was occasioned by the western European takeover of commerce and shipping in the Indian Ocean from Ottoman, Arab, and Indian merchants. Although he knew that the Ottomans viewed the erosion of their role in the Indian Ocean as a major threat, he did not realize the impact that this loss to the Ottoman Empire would have on Venice, culturally tied to western Europe but economically Introduction\n\n17\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nlinked with the Ottomans. What Ambrosio Bembo recorded was the aftermath of earlier European victories and European consolidation and expansion of power in India and farther east to the detriment not just of the Ottomans but also of Venice. In this sense he did not recognize that an era had ended and that, as Venice’s role in world trade and politics rapidly drew to a close, he was one of the last of the great Venetian travelers. From the vantage point of the early twenty-ﬁrst century, it is also clear that it was a period of imminent decline for all three great Islamic empires, as well as for Venice. Western and central Europe indulged in a notably romantic mystique about Safavi Iran and Mughal India in the seventeenth century. They were less inclined to do so with the Ottomans, who were more familiar, too close for comfort, and an ongoing military threat. Carpets, ceramics, and luxury textiles were imported from Iran; spices, jewels, and textiles were favored goods from India. Both the Safavi and Mughal empires were perceived in Europe in terms of wealth and absolute power, images that appealed to European royalty. August the Strong of Saxony (1694–1733), for instance, commissioned, at very great expense, a miniature procession of his contemporary, the emperor Awrangzeb (r. 1658–1707), complete with courtiers, soldiers, and elephants, numbering many dozens of enameled and bejeweled ﬁgurines. Mughal miniatures were used to decorate the walls of a gallery in the Viennese palace of Schönbrunn; Rembrandt was fascinated by Mughal drawings and paintings; and European aristocracy commissioned from Iran so-called Polonaise carpets with their own coats of arms in the center. Christian missionaries and Christian merchants expanded their activities in the Safavi and Mughal states. Bembo accompanied Franciscans who were traveling to India, stayed with Capuchins, Franciscans, Augustinians, Theatines, Dominicans, and Discalced Carmelites in Iran and India, and observed the power of the Jesuits in Portuguese India. Shah ‘Abbas in Iran (1587–1629) was notably friendly toward emissaries of Christian states whose aid he sought against the Ottomans, and he encouraged the indigenous Christian Armenian community of Iran to serve as commercial intermediaries with European merchants. Prints by European artists including Albrecht Dürer were admired in Iran and India, and illustrated Bibles were shown to both the Safavi shah ‘Abbas and the Mughal emperor Akbar (1556–1605), who discussed religious issues with visiting Jesuits and accepted a copy of the illustrated Royal Polyglot Bible of 1568–1573, printed by Christopher Plantin in Antwerp. These illustrations, along with others by European artists, exerted a substantial inﬂuence on the work of Safavi and Mughal artists. Christian missions also served other important roles. Some of their residents, 18\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nsuch as Father Raphaël du Mans, were trusted sources of information for governments at home and were instrumental in the development of European academic expertise about Islamic societies. Mission houses served as post oﬃces for traveling Europeans, and it was through their good oﬃces that Bembo was sometimes able to use his letters of credit to get funds on his journey. They were also hostels where visitors could ﬁnd safe and somewhat familiar accommodation, speak their own language, pick up mail and news from home, get locally useful advice, and meet other Europeans. Without them it would not have been possible for so many adventurous Europeans to travel in Turkey, Iran, and India. Bembo’s bitterly critical remarks about the Jesuits in Goa indicate that he recognized the missions were also instruments of European colonial expansion and exploitation, and his journal demonstrates in very tangible ways how important they were to colonialism. Bembo described how the networks of the missions provided him with specialized news about the rest of the world while he was in Isfahan. I had much other news and was surprised at the diﬀerences in the news coming from Europe. The news comes through the Capuchin fathers, the Jesuits, and others, besides through letters of various individuals . . . To the Augustinians and Carmelites comes all the news from the East Indies and from Portugal. The Carmelites also get news from Turkey which arrives from their missions in those parts; they also get the reports and councils of Venice. . . . These things got communicated from one to another, and many of the Persians themselves, curious about happenings in Europe, go to interrogate those fathers in their convents. The fathers explain everything to them in Persian, and in return the Persians tell them what is new in the country. Thus, although late and with some alterations, European accounts reach Isfahan, as does news of all the world.\n\nSeventeenth-century Islam was no more a political or religious unity than was Christendom. The Ottoman Empire (1281–1924) was strongly Sunni and persecuted Shi‘i Muslims. It was a huge, highly centralized state that encompassed Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Albanians, and Slavs, among others, with much of its still very formidable military power dependent upon the janissary corps, soldiers who by the middle of the seventeenth century were recruited from free-born Muslims and were often unruly and sometimes unreliable. The Ottomans’ great opponent to the east was the Safavi Empire (1501– 1722). With Sunni states to the west, north, and east, Iran was stridently Shi‘i, and its shah was recognized as head of the Safavi mystical Shi‘i religious Introduction\n\n19\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 20\n\norder. As centralized as the Ottoman state, Safavi Iran was a land-based empire with no signiﬁcant naval forces. Safavi commercial policy favored traditional overland trade routes, and enormous sums were spent on building impressive caravan inns (caravanserais), which Bembo much admired, to protect merchants and their goods and to serve as entrepôts where they could sell their goods. Iran therefore posed no threat to Europe’s maritime expansion, and it oﬀered the possibility of military alliances against the Ottomans. The Safavis needed to cooperate with European powers. Thus, despite occasional friction, the Portuguese maintained small trading settlements along Iran’s southern coast, such as Bandar-i Kong, where Bembo stayed before embarking for India. Bembo enjoyed Iran far more than he did Turkey, perhaps because they had a common enemy. He also admired the safety of Iranian roads and the oﬃcial protection given to travelers. Muslim invaders founded the ﬁrst Islamic sultanate in northern India in 1192, and although Muslims remained a minority in predominantly Hindu India, rulers in the Delhi sultanate and in other sultanates in northern and central India expanded Islam’s role and power in India over more than three centuries. Like their predecessors, the Mughal dynasty (1526–1858) fostered a system of cooperation between the Hindu and Muslim aristocracies; this system was most eﬃcacious under the emperors Akbar and Jahangir (1605–1627), who encouraged toleration between the various religious communities and supported a centralized and expansionist state. Under Awrangzeb the system broke down, and major rebellions broke out in central and western India, particularly in Maharastra, where the Maratha leader Shivaji contested Mughal authority and occasionally threatened European interests. Because the Portuguese settlements occupied only a thin strip of coastal lands otherwise surrounded by Shivaji’s domains, these political and military uncertainties may have been behind Bembo’s cautious visit to India. Like Pietro della Valle before him, he remained in the Portuguese settlements on the western coast and had no direct contact with either the Marathas or the Mughals. He chose not to travel inland to the great Mughal cities of Agra and Delhi, though many of his contemporaries, such as Tavernier, did. Perhaps he was exhausted or had seen enough of the world and wished to remain in somewhat familiar surroundings. Personality\n\nAmbrosio Bembo was a keen traveler whose excellent powers of observation became more developed as he traveled. He carefully described land20\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nscape, cities, architecture, food, shipping, oﬃcialdom, coinage, costumes, and customs, and he must have kept notes, for he recorded exact dates and times of day when certain events took place. He was proud of the knowledge gained from his arduous travels. In discussing earlier views about India, its heat, and its summer monsoon he observed: “But the conclusions reached through theories by those seated at their desks who travel only in their thoughts, which seem at ﬁrst sight self-evident and necessary, are discovered false in practice. Those who personally travel to those countries discover the opposite to be true.” He also had a very retentive memory and relied on the observations of others to supplement what he recalled. Thus in Surat on May 17, 1673, he recorded: “Since there are many idolaters in this city and in the kingdom of Cambay or Gujarat, it seems to me appropriate to tell here with some clarity what I can about the various rites and superstitions that they have, without obliging myself to put them in order, however, but only putting down what I remember of what I saw or of what I was told by those who stayed a long time in those parts and who observed more carefully.” Unlike many other travelers, then as now, he was careful to cite his sources, particularly referring on several occasions to his Venetian predecessor della Valle. Only occasionally did he refer to his own journey in the past tense. On his return trip through Baghdad, he mentioned a future event: “However, sometime after I left they built a new bazaar for dealing in textiles imported from India.” He was proud of his aristocratic family connections, and he instructed Grélot to show the family coat of arms in several of the drawings in his Journal and Travels. He surely found this assertion of status to be ﬁtting and instructive rather than obtrusive.16 Grélot also included what must be portraits of Bembo in a number of drawings, as well as some representations of himself.17 Bembo’s trip took him out of cosmopolitan Catholic Venice into a world of much greater religious diversity, and he was fascinated by it. Though he makes obligatory remarks about Muslims being schismatics and followers\n\n16. The frontispiece, folios 8–9, 10–11, 222–223, and the ﬁnal drawing of a ship breaking up in a storm. 17. It is likely that Bembo appears in folios 10–11, 94–95, 220–221, 260–261, and 312 #3. Grélot appears to have represented himself in folios 10–11 and 260; in both drawings he also includes his tools. Introduction\n\n21\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nof “their false prophet” Muhammad, he was obviously and genuinely fascinated by Islam. He set out the months of the Muslim year and discussed the times of daily prayer, the yearly fast of Ramadan, the major festivals, and the pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. That Muslims venerate Mary and Jesus was, of course, appealing to him. He was well aware that Shi‘i Iranians followed a diﬀerent kind of Islam, that they held Muhammad’s son-in-law ‘Ali in special veneration, that their chief martyrs’ shrines were in Kerbala and Najaf, and that they believed in a messiah, the Mahdi. He was also intrigued by the varieties of Christian belief he found, though he also dismissed them as “schismatics.” Adherents of the Syrian Catholic Church he mistakenly referred to as Nestorians. But he also mentioned on several occasions actual followers of Nestorian doctrine, particularly when he discussed the Chaldeans of Anatolia and of the island of Socotra. Their patriarch resided in Baghdad and, according to Bembo, there were seven Nestorian archdioceses and seven dioceses. In the city of Diyarbakır in southeastern Anatolia he found “ten diﬀerent rites, ﬁve of inﬁdels and ﬁve of baptized persons. These latter are Armenians, Greeks, Nestorians, Jacobites, and Shiamsi, who were, and still are, worshippers of the sun.” In India he found the Christians of St. Thomas and asserted that they had been converted by St. Thomas after the saint had left Anatolia. Their tortuous internal politics fascinated him. He found Jews in Syria, Iraq, and Iran, and he described their costume, customs, and occupations. In India he made no distinction between Jains and the diﬀerent types of Hindus, and he referred to all non-Muslim and non-Christian Indians as Gentiles, to whose clothing he paid more attention than to their religious beliefs. In the Portuguese Indian city of Daman he saw Parsees and identiﬁed them as Iranians who had “ﬂed from Persia at the time when that kingdom became Moslem. They adore ﬁre, the sun, and the moon. They keep a ﬁre lit all the time as the Vestals did in Rome.” Bembo was a remarkably open-minded and decent person. He respected those missionaries who were ﬁne human beings, and he did not conceal his dislike of those he considered untrustworthy, overbearing, or obnoxious. He could be sarcastic about their pretensions: before leaving the southern Iranian port of Bandar-i Kong for India he noted that “the Carmelites . . . , like all religious, were at the best hostel.” Bembo intensely disliked Father Giovanni Seabra, the Franciscan who had initially enticed him to travel from Aleppo to India, and he took real pleasure in seeing the diﬃculties that befell him. For the Jesuits in Goa he had no general aﬀection, and he identiﬁed their prevalent racism with obvious distaste: “Since, as is often 22\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 23\n\ntrue of the Portuguese, some [Jesuits] were too rigid and not fond of those people [the Indians of Goa], because of their dark color, and since they despised them and maltreated them, the [Indians] could not support their dominion, even if only spiritual.” The actions of the Inquisition in Goa appalled him, not only by its famous brutalities but also by its inequities, and he noted that erring Portuguese “rarely reach such extremes” of punishment as the indigenous Indians. His active social conscience is reﬂected in other observations. In Goa he remarked that the Christian missionary communities lived very well in the midst of general squalor: The Augustinians have [a school] attached to the monastery and thus occupy a good part of that hill, which is the best location in the city for air. At the foot of that hill there is a convent of nuns, unique in the city, subordinate to the archbishop, but administered in temporal and spiritual aﬀairs by the Augustinians, since it is of the same order. It is quite rich and ample. Usually there are about eighty nuns of the most noble families. They are served by many native women and Moorish women from Africa, who stay there with them. All the monasteries are big and magniﬁcent, and they continue to grow. The clergy buy ruined places near them, or they receive property in inheritance, since the Portuguese want to give much to monasteries when they die. These latter get bigger, and the clerics live splendidly without reﬂecting about the rest of the city, which is deteriorating, nor about the poor beggars who die of hunger.\n\nTo his credit, this cultured, worldly, urbane, and generally tolerant young man was not himself given to such self-indulgent excesses and was sensitive to the plight of those less fortunate. He was also aware that his own cultural and religious background was not necessarily the only valid one. With an appealing mixture of humor and objectivity, he acknowledged that the Indians “make fun of our ceremonies as much as we do of theirs.” He was interested in languages and in Diyarbakır worked to learn Turkish. There is some evidence in his text that at some point he studied Arabic, and during his stay in Isfahan he learned some Persian. He wore Turkish clothing for much of his trip, but in Iran he dressed as a Persian. He contrasted Turks and Turkish manners and customs most unfavorably with those of Iranians, whose kindliness and courtliness he much admired. About the Arabs of Syria and Iraq he had almost nothing good to say. Like a good Venetian, he paid careful attention to every kind of ship on which he journeyed; whether river raft or ocean-going vessel, he noted how it was made, how much it could hold, how well it handled. He was Introduction\n\n23\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nproud of his own rational approach and coolly dismissed the habit he observed among the Portuguese of hanging saints’ images upside down when they were seeking a favor. He had a good sense of humor that must have served him well during his diﬃcult travels. On his arrival in Baghdad after a diﬃcult journey down the Tigris, he was warmly welcomed by the Capuchins, who put him up in their mission house. “Since I was very tired,” he wrote, “I went immediately to rest. I did not want to use the sheets, though, so as not to lose the habit of diﬃculty and suﬀering all at once.” He reported on his experiences with masseuses in Goa with a mixture of detached commentary and wry personal involvement: [T]hey have themselves massaged to make it easier for them to sleep. The men do the same. It is impossible for them to sleep without these things. Not all do it in the same way. Some have their whole bodies rubbed, others have their joints moved, others have their bodies pinched; and others have themselves tickled and slightly scratched all over. Still others have their feet scratched. Since this is women’s work, they pass easily from these to other, greater conﬁdences and freedom. I tried this custom of theirs because they insisted. At ﬁrst, it kept me from sleeping and bothered me, but after a few times I enjoyed it.\n\nHe enjoyed bathhouse massages in Bandar-i Kong considerably less, for his modesty was oﬀended. After the bath, “they have one lie down on the ﬂoor, and the employees of the bathhouse wash one in a very improper way. They climb on one and rub the whole body indiscreetly; as a result, during the whole time I was in Persia, I did not want to go into their baths anymore.” Food was important, particularly when it was awful or impressive. He was a normal twenty-year-old in this regard, and perhaps in later life he may have been something of a gourmand. He recorded remarkably few instances of food poisoning or of ill health (in one instance a persistent headache lasting for several days; in another, a fever that did not abate for several weeks), and he seemed to have sustained himself well during his travels. He was a person of generosity and courage and was only occasionally discouraged, and then as much by the foibles of fellow travelers as by the rigors of travel. That he attracted loyalty and aﬀection from most of those with whom he was associated suggests that he was a good-natured, decent, and appealing individual. Bembo had a well-developed aesthetic sense that expressed itself in his 24\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nadmiration, sometimes of landscape but more often of architecture, both monumental and utilitarian. He was also attentive to detail, whether in food, wine, commerce, architecture, or the arts. He admired Shirazi arts, architecture, and urban design, though he noted failed upkeep and maintenance. The palace in the Royal Garden was half in ruins, and its gardens were rented out by the king. Outside the city was the Bagh-i Firdaus, its buildings run down but its garden still productive. Bembo was keenly interested in technical achievements, whether in the ships he traveled on or in buildings or utilitarian structures, such as the great cisterns of Lar in southern Iran and of the Portuguese colonies in western India. And he greatly esteemed the many solid and secure caravanserais available for travelers along Iran’s main trade routes and compared them favorably to their meager counterparts in Ottoman Mesopotamia. Bembo was not haughty, but he was conscious of his noble antecedents and upbringing and expected to be received with appropriate protocol. Thus he was extraordinarily pleased by the attention granted to him by the president of the English East India Company in Mumbai: I saw at the end of the hall a majestic chair from which rose the President. He came toward me and greeted me with kindness. He had me sit at his right on a chair diﬀerent from all the others with a green velvet cushion, like the one that he had on his own chair. With his good manners he kept me in conversation about my trip as well as about several things to do with Venice. He then passed to talk of India and told me that his company was no longer ﬁnding there the earnings that it had at ﬁrst, when they were earning ﬁfteen and twenty for one. Now the Dutch had taken some of the proﬁt. His name was Gerard Aungier, a rather civil man of good height. He wore a wig and black clothing and had velvet slippers embroidered in gold on his feet and a sword at his belt.\n\nBembo was very attentive to material culture, particularly when it reﬂected rank and privilege. After seeing the tableware of the Portuguese governor of Goa, he could not help noting in his journal that there was nothing extraordinary about it: “In one of the rooms there was a window that looked into a smaller room that had the silverware of the viceroy on display. This consisted of a good set for the table and some bowls. I did not stop to comment about them for fear that they should think I had not seen things like them in our country, where, in fact, such items would have been ordinary.” Despite his laudable open-mindedness, he rarely missed an Introduction\n\n25\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 26\n\nopportunity to draw a favorable comparison between Venice and other European states. Though he was acutely aware of his own personal expenses, he reﬂected only obliquely on the physical impediments the Portuguese faced in India. He did not seem to take into account the fact that they operated under diﬃcult circumstances, far from home, and that maintaining the culture of the homeland was costly and imperfect at such a distance and in the midst of a vibrant and attractive south Indian culture. Grélot and His Drawings\n\nFifty-one of the ﬁfty-two line drawings that illustrate The Travels and Journal are the work of Guillaume Joseph Grélot, a French artist, who was born about 1630. Twenty-ﬁve of these drawings bear the artist’s signature,18 and sixteen are dated. He lived in Constantinople for six years, from 1665 to 1671, where he met the Anglo-French jeweler and traveler Jean Chardin. Nothing if not shrewd in his business relations, Chardin planned to write and publish an account of his travels in Iran, and he knew that attractive illustrations would signiﬁcantly increase his sales. Grélot must have fallen on hard times, for he accepted the highly disadvantageous contract that Chardin oﬀered him: all of his drawings were to belong to Chardin, who would not pay him until they returned together to Paris, where the jeweler might also give Grélot a bonus if he chose. Were Grélot to leave Chardin’s company at any point along the way or to produce a single drawing for anyone else he would forfeit all of his pay. Grélot essentially put himself at Chardin’s mercy and was to suﬀer for this unwise agreement. The two men set out together for Iran on July 17, 1671, and remained there until September 1674, when Bembo, staying at the Carmelite mission in Isfahan, was introduced to Grélot by the Carmelite father Giacomo. Grélot was desperate to leave Chardin’s employ but had no funds for the expensive trip back to Europe. Bembo seems to have seen at once that here was a great opportunity: “Advised of this and thinking that through him I would be able to make a good number of drawings of the curious things\n\n18. The signed drawings are folios 10–11, 60–61, 94, 220, 230, 234, 238, 240 (# 1, 2, 3, 4,), 244, 246, 260, 263, 263 (#2), 266, 266 (#2), 272, 274, 310, 312, 312 (#2), 312 (#3), and 314. Folios 234, 238, 240 #1, 240 #2, 244, 263 #1, 263 #2, 266 #1, 266 #2, 272, and 274 are dated 1674. Folios 10–11, 60–61 (initially dated 1674 and subsequently corrected to 1675), 310, 312 #1, and 312 #2 are dated 1675. 26\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 27\n\nthat I had seen and that I would see (which I had always wanted to do, since it is very appropriate for an itinerary to be illustrated), I proposed my companionship to him with the promise to take him to Europe with me.” They apparently took to each other and quickly came to an agreement about their travel together. Before they left the city, they worked together, using Bembo’s memory and Grélot’s sketches, to prepare drawings of Isfahan and of other places, such as Persepolis, that they both had seen. Grélot also drew three illustrations for Bembo’s entries on India, even though he had never been there. On September 21, 1674, they set out from Isfahan, and during the ensuing eight months Grélot drew dozens of sites, buildings, and landscapes for Bembo, who presumably looked on and oﬀered suggestions. With Bembo’s advice, Grélot produced startlingly accurate renderings of the Sasanian rock reliefs at Taq-i Bustan and the great Achaemenid relief. Perhaps because of his higher social status, the twenty-two-year-old Bembo describes Grélot as a youth, even though the artist was twice his age: Yet this Grélot was a very discreet young man of great goodness and modesty. In addition to his own French, he also understood many languages, such as Latin, Spanish, literary Greek, Arabic, and Persian, if not perfectly, then at least well enough to be able to get along. During the trip he applied himself to everything with great amiability and without ulterior motives. Often he would have us enjoy very good food that he had prepared. Since he and I had still fresh in our memories some of the things we had seen, he made various drawings before we left Isfahan with the help of some sketches that he had, most particularly of the city and important places in it.\n\nAfter their return to Venice, Grélot stayed for some time with the Bembo family and visited the family estate, which he drew as a frontispiece for the manuscript. It seems that another artist drew the picture of a storm-tossed ship that concludes the book. Grélot may have subsequently gone to Paris, where in 1680 his other major documentary study, Relation nouvelle d’un voyage de Constantinople, was published. This book was much admired by François Bernier, a French physician who was at the Mughal court from 1656 to 1668 and who in 1709–1710 published his account of the Mughal Empire as he saw it. Bernier’s praise is recorded in the preface to Grélot’s book: It were to be wished that all who had travelled into foreign countries had made as good use of their time as Monsieur Grélot, the designs which he has made publick in this book and others which he has shewed me of other parts Introduction\n\n27\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 28\n\nwhere I have been, suﬃciently demonstrate what an exact observer he has been of things most worthy [of ] remark; such as are the platforms and delineations of those places to which it is no easy thing to get access. And therefore, believing myself obliged to do him that justice which he deserves, I do assure the world, that all the representations of the draughts which he has made are all exactly conformable to what I remember of the places themselves.19\n\nThe ﬁfty-two drawings are not works of great artistic ﬁnish or merit. Only the dramatic ﬁnal drawing of a storm-battered naval vessel is reasonably well turned out, and it bears no direct relationship to Bembo’s text. It is also unlikely that it is Grélot’s work. Bembo was educated enough to know that, and Grélot seems to have been both modest and talented enough to share that view. His illustrations in Chardin’s Voyages and in his own Relation nouvelle are far more distinctive and polished. They reveal an artist who was thoroughly skilled in perspective, capable of excellent, detailed renderings of architecture, and accustomed to close observation of people and their dress. One presumes that his ﬁfty-one illustrations to Bembo’s Travels and Journal are more in the nature of preparatory sketches that would have been corrected and more deliberately worked as they were made into copper plates for publication. But he clearly responded to the interests of his patron, who rarely devoted any of the written text to descriptions of plant or animal life, so Grélot’s illustrations accordingly focus almost entirely on landscape, buildings, ships and rafts, rock reliefs, ruins, and costume. In concluding his observations of the Sasanian rock reliefs at Taq-i Bustan, Bembo indicated that he closely supervised the drawing process. Some, though by no means all of them, bear signature and date, such as G. I. Grélot delineavit 1674. They are of diverse size. The majority are single sheets, but a number are double pages; and a few, notably the views of the cities of Aleppo, Baghdad, and Isfahan and the archaeological site of 19. W. J. Grélot, “Attestations to the Reader,” in A Late Voyage to Constantinople (London: John Playford, 1683), pp. 13–14. In his Voyages de Corneille Le Brun par la Móscovie, en Perse, et aux Indes Orientales (Amsterdam, 1718), vol. 2, 437–452, the French traveler Corneille Le Brun criticizes the accuracy of some of Grélot’s drawings published in Chardin’s Voyages. L. Langlès’s 1811 edition of Chardin’s Voyages rejects this criticism and also repeats the account that Grélot left Chardin’s service to work for Bembo. 28\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 29\n\nPersepolis, are panoramas spread as foldouts over several pages. Most are rendered in brown ink, though Grélot sometimes combines brown with black ink on the same page. A few sketches are wholly in black (view of Taq-i Bustan). There are several explicit references to Bembo’s identity through the inclusion of the family coat of arms and, in particular, the frontispiece, which depicts the Bembo villa outside Venice. The device appears in the picture of the entry of the consuls into Aleppo, the subsequent view of the city itself, the panorama of Persepolis, and the upper right of a Persepolis tomb. Bembo seemed proud to show how far he had carried the family name. Grélot also drew at least three portraits of Bembo. We can safely assume that we see Bembo’s face as the bearded bust in the lower right of the rendering of Persepolis. His portrait sits on top of the family coat of arms and sports a Turkish turban. We also see him sitting next to Grélot in the view of the city of Canea. In ﬁg. 16 Bembo is shown in European clothing being carried on his palanquin in India. Grélot also incorporated four self-portraits into the drawings, presumably with Bembo’s approval. In all of them we see him from the back. In the view of Aleppo on folios 10–11 he is dressed in Italian clothing, and next to him rest the perspective box, compass, and rulers that demonstrate he is a skilled and well-trained artist. Folios 200 and 312 show him in Turkish attire, and folio 260 shows him in Iranian dress outside the Iranian town of Respè. Not all of the drawings record sober details of the trip. In a view of the ﬁne caravanserai at Missian (fols. 258–259), we see a rider who is being abruptly thrown from his horse. Bembo does not mention such an incident in his text, and we should probably assume that Grélot included it to add some liveliness to the drawing. Likewise, Grélot included a number of passing riders in the representation of Bisitun (fol. 260), and he took pains to show us details of the campsite at the ferry station of Beherus, where he and Bembo crossed the Diyala River (fols. 274–275). Bembo was not shy about giving Grélot speciﬁc instructions. The caravanserai at Maidast (fol. 268), for instance, was to show the interior, and he worked with Grélot the whole day of October 13, 1674, to successfully ﬁnish the drawings of Taq-i Bustan. His description of the rock reliefs is full and exacting, and, according to his own remarks, he supervised Grélot’s drawings carefully: “On the 13th I was able to ﬁnish the drawings as I liked.” Given this close involvement, it is simply astounding to look at the renderings of Isfahan, a city that both Grélot and Bembo knew well. When Bembo hired him, Grélot had already lived in the city for many months. Introduction\n\n29\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 30\n\nApart from three bridges, none of the structures in the foldout panorama is clearly identiﬁable, with the possible exception of the early seventeenthcentury Mosque of the Imam across the river from the middle bridge. Neither the medieval jami‘ mosque nor the central quadrangle (the maydan) is evident. Instead, the drawing gives an overall impression of woods and palaces, very much in keeping with Bembo’s verbal description. Surprisingly, all of the minarets and domes are Ottoman in style, though both Bembo and Grélot must have been thoroughly familiar with the distinctive Safavi minarets and domes that are so much a part of the glory of the city. In the great maydan the minarets of the Shaykh Lotfallah mosque on the east side and the Mosque of the Imam on the south side have been transformed from Safavi to Ottoman style, and the ogive arches of the arcades that enclose the quadrangle have been transformed and made round. These mistakes are extremely puzzling, particularly when other drawings, such as the interior of the Ayineh Khaneh (fols. 246–247) and the caravanserai at Missian (fols. 258–259), are drawn correctly with pointed arches. According to Bembo, the two men worked together in Isfahan on drawings of the notable monuments, and each was a practiced observer. Did Grélot rework the drawings after their return to Venice and fall prey to his memories of Constantinople? And did Bembo, who prided himself on his memory, unaccountably forget what the minars and arches of Isfahan really looked like? Were these drawings, in fact, only sketches that the two men intended to correct once they prepared the book for publication?20 The latter seems likely, particularly when we compare Grélot’s drawings for Bembo’s memoirs with his far more ﬁnished illustrations in his own book on Constantinople, which are accurate and suitably professional. Presumably, the illustrations to Bembo’s Journal would have been much more polished had the book been published. In any case, the errors and discrepancies indicate that we must proceed with appropriate caution in using the drawings as historical evidence. Another instance in which we are faced with the mystery that Bembo’s text is sometimes more accurate than the drawings involves Bembo’s visit to the\n\n20. Note that the illustrations to Chardin’s 1711 edition are more accurate: the minars are Safavi, the arches are ogive. Chardin uses the same format of foldouts to show the maydan in Isfahan. Although Grélot worked for him for some time, the pictures in Chardin’s book bear various other names and later dates—Fonbonne, 1701; Fonbonne, 1710; and L. Sur, n.d. 30\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 31\n\nRoyal Zoo in Isfahan, where he was suitably impressed, particularly with the Indian rhinoceros that had been presented to the shah by the Uzbek khan. I went one morning to see the enclosure of the lions and the dogs, which are very ﬁerce and of extraordinary size. They serve as night guards for the king, as is the custom here. In another half-destroyed place I saw two elephants, rather old and very tame. While I was present, I had the pleasure of seeing them take food with their trunks with which they also defend themselves and eat everything. In the same place there was a rhinoceros tied with a heavy chain on his feet. It is a very ﬁerce and ugly animal, as can be seen in the drawing [ﬁg. 29, page 347]. It is taller than a buﬀalo and twice as broad, and it has short, thick legs with three nails on each foot. In the head it is little diﬀerent from a buﬀalo, but on its nose it has a horn similar to a sugar cake, with which it ﬁghts, particularly with elephants, toward which it has great antipathy. It vanquishes them when it can wound them in their lower parts with its horn. Its skin is very thick and resists the shots from arquebusses. It is scaly and bumpy, and in some places it is doubled, so that the head and the feet seem to come out of it like a turtle’s. It was given to the king by the Great Khan of the Tartars.\n\nGrélot’s picture of this Indian rhinoceros is signed and bears the notation that it was “drawn from life” (ad vivum) in 1674. The animal is represented in proﬁle and facing to the right. It stands in a landscape that is barren except for two plants in the foreground and, in the far right, a distant village with a distinctly Ottoman single-domed mosque and minaret. One presumes that Grélot was so assertive about his drawing being “from life” to emphasize that he did not copy Dürer’s well-known drawing of a rhinoceros, which was, of course, exactly what he did.21 (In his introduction to his own book on Constantinople, Grélot pronounced his personal abhorrence of plagiarism.) But the inclusion of an Ottoman building as a set piece in a scene from Iran once again calls into question Grélot’s accuracy, as well as the thoroughness of Bembo’s supervision. It is intriguing that all of these odd and egregious mistakes are centered on architectural representations.\n\n21. For his 1515 woodcut of an Indian rhinoceros, Dürer relied entirely on written descriptions of the animal. See K. A. Schröder and M. L. Sternath, Albrecht Dürer, catalog of an exhibition at the Albertina, Vienna, 2003, ﬁgure 3, pp. 51–52.

The Safavi palace of the Ayineh Khaneh (Palace of Mirrors, fols. 246–247) was destroyed in the nineteenth century, and Grélot presents us with the only known view of its interior. The caravanserai at Maidast (Mahidasht, fols. 268–269) that impressed Bembo is now a police station, and the drawings of Bisitun (fol. 260) and Taq-i Bustan (fols. 264–265) are the earliest known European renderings of these major archaeological sites. Though Chardin only cursorily refers to Persepolis, Grélot’s drawings of the great Achaemenid site are detailed and informative. Despite their errors, the drawings convey a sense of immediacy and oﬀer personal impressions, such as the portraits of the author and the artist. Bembo did not claim to be a scholar or describe himself as a seasoned traveler with a wealth of experience and information. He never claimed to be other than a young man with an abiding interest in other peoples and other cultures. He traveled not to proselytize, spy, or sell but simply to see and learn as much as he could. Because he was not representing Venice in any oﬃcial capacity, he did not associate with royal courts, or ﬁll his book with the gossip and intrigues that make those of Chardin and Tavernier such fascinating reading. Instead, Bembo informs us about a humbler way of travel, and we are presented with the sorts of obstacles and frustrations that an unoﬃcial traveler faced. He struggled with the importunities of petty oﬃcials and complained about their injustices; he suﬀered cold, wet weather and meager or very bad food. His detailed expense account makes abundantly clear how closely he had to watch his costs. Like all travelers, he was sometimes ill, and he was grateful for small and large kindnesses. He spent much of his time in European circles, doubtless for a greater sense of security so far from home and with so few resources. Already experienced in war, he had a high sense of adventure and curiosity, but when he set out on his long and risky journey, he must have known that his odds for surviving it were not overwhelming. His book is as valuable a view of the network of Christian mission houses in the Near East and India as it is of the countries themselves, but most of all it is an appealing self-portrait of a bright, decent, remarkably tolerant, and thoroughly likable traveler who was a good observer and a lively writer. His trip obviously aﬀected him deeply and probably ﬁlled his conversation with anecdotes for the rest of his life. We are in his debt that he took the trouble to leave us this record of it.\n\n32\n\nIntroduction\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 33\n\nprologue\n\nThe desire to know is innate and natural to the spirit of mankind, whose special gift is the intellect, the sense that is always most eager to feed itself with knowledge. Many things are learned through theory, and more through practice. The world is a great book, which, when perused attentively, proﬀers teachings and delights with its variety. True, one must tolerate expense, discomfort, and danger, but the eﬀort, if blessed by fortune, brings its reward. Idleness eats away at all virtue and is the worst companion for youth; a source of vices, it perverts the inclination of the good, weakens the courage of the strong, and withers every laurel of glory. In the ﬂower of my youth I was taken from the study of letters for the honor of public service during the last two years of the famous War of Candia.1 At the end of that struggle, after having spent some time with the\n\n1. A Muslim Arab force invaded Crete in a.d. 827 and established an initial base at Candia on the site of ancient Heraklion, from which Arab authority spread rapidly over the whole island. Cretan Arabs were a major maritime force in the eastern Mediterranean until the recapture of Crete by the Byzantine Empire between 960 and 972. Taken by the Crusaders in 1204, the island came under Venetian control in 1207. In 1645 Maltese corsairs based in Crete captured an Ottoman ﬂeet on the way to Mecca with pilgrims, including several of Sultan Ibrahim’s wives, and the ensuing war lasted twenty-ﬁve years. Under Ottoman siege from 1648 to 1669, the port city of Candia was well supplied by the Venetian ﬂeet and supported in part by seven thousand French troops sent by Louis XIV. When the French force was withdrawn in 1669, the Venetian general Francesco Morosini surrendered, and Crete came under Ottoman control. Bembo was later to accompany Francesco Morosini in his 1686–1687 Peloponnesian campaign. 33\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 34\n\nGreat Fleet with the nobleman Taddeo Morosini,2 the lord of our house and Captain of the Navy and with whom I had gone to the Levant and been treated with all generosity and splendor, and after having directed the Public Ship, the Fontana d’Oro, with the title of Governor (under the authorization of the General Captain Francesco Morosini, Cavalier and Procurator of S. Marco), I found myself after the peace without opportunity to work at sea or in arms. At nineteen I was too young, according to the laws of the country, to enter the Grand Council3 or to take up any other position or public oﬃce. Since I would be unable to ascend to public service until my twenty-ﬁfth year and unhappy at the prospect of having to spend more than ﬁve years in a position of uselessness, I embraced with ready obedience the opportunity given me to fulﬁll my obligations toward the nobleman Marco Bembo, my paternal uncle. A long time previously, he had been assigned as the replacement for the nobleman Francesco Erizzo in the consulate of Aleppo. The deliberations of the Senate, however, had delayed his voyage due to the ﬁerce war that had arisen between the Republic and the Ottomans, which had resulted in the interruption of commerce with all the ports of that Empire. When peace with free passage was established after twenty-ﬁve years, and former traﬃc was reestablished, my uncle was once again conﬁrmed as consul of Aleppo. In the meantime he had served in many capacities, among them that of Captain of Ships and General Provider of the armed forces in Candia. Wishing to travel in various foreign countries, I accompanied him.4\n\n2. The Morosinis had been one of Venice’s major families since the twelfth century, and this statement indicates that they were closely related to the aristocratic Bembos. Several generations of a family might live together in the same palace. 3. Maggior Consiglio. 4. It was a common practice for a senior Venetian oﬃcial to take a young son or nephew with him to a new post so that he could begin to learn how to represent Venice eﬀectively.\n\n34\n\nPrologue\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 35\n\none\n\nFrom Venice to Aleppo\n\n[August 1671] We embarked on August 8, 1671, on the ship Conﬁdenza, leased with cargo but a large vessel furnished with many cannons that had already served the public in the preceding years of war. That which transpired from my leaving the port until my return to my country—a period of almost four years—I have wanted to set down in these pages in a smooth and easy narrative so that the bother that I suﬀered alone during long wanderings, attempted by few and to few granted, may bring pleasure to all those who, during the leisure of domestic tranquility, may want to spend only a little time in reading them. I have described all that I thought worthwhile and suﬃcient to give an idea of the places I saw. As for the material part of this work, I took advantage as best I could and at no little expense of the services of an ingenious Frenchman who traveled with me and provided many drawings of towns, costumes, and other famous memorabilia or rarities. Thus I am able to provide more pleasure.1 It is unfortunate if this sort of itinerary should seem a bit dry for the delicate tastes of modern minds, since it is the same that was undertaken by Marco Polo, also one of us Venetians, and by almost all the others who underwent similar troubles. One should realize, too, that this account might be as boring (if not more so), because it is less distinguished than oth-\n\n1. Guillaume Joseph Grélot was born about 1630 and lived in Constantinople, where he met the Anglo-French jeweler and traveler Jean Chardin. They set out together for Iran on July 17, 1671. After his return to Paris Grélot published in 1680 an important illustrated study of Constantinople, Relation nouvelle d’un voyage de Constantinople. 35\n\nUC-Bembo.qxd\n\n6/15/07\n\n6:04 PM\n\nPage 36\n\ners. In addition, my youth and inexperience did not permit me to weave an ornamented and ordered story of so many kingdoms and of such great countries. Nevertheless, this diary will be the truthful account of the voyage that began under the auspices of the Virgin Mother of God on the 15th of August at dawn, which was also a Saturday.2 We left Malamocco with four other merchant vessels, on one of which was the nobleman Alvise Cornaro who was also going as a consul, but to Cairo.3 Since much of the voyage the ships would be together, the command of the group of vessels was given to my uncle. As captain of our ship itself was Pietro Melle, whom I had known well while in the armed forces and who had served in the same oﬃce and on the same ship then. The voyage was troubled not only by contrary winds but also by many periods of calm. The resulting tedium was relieved by the varied company. On the ship were the nobleman Giovanni Antonio Soderini, who was on his way to the Holy Land and surrounding areas, merchants going to Aleppo, and many ministers necessary for the operations of the consulate.4 Besides these, the consul of Cyprus, Giovanni Antonio Santonini, was also on board with many merchants going to that island.5 My uncle was honored by the presence of the consul and of the noble Soderini at his table. Many members of religious orders had also taken advantage of the voyage. Among them were four Discalced Carmelites going to Goa. One of these was a Visitatore by the name of Father Valerio, from whom I was to receive many favors while in India.6 Without him I would have found myself in many troubles, as I will recount at the appropriate time.\n\n2. Bembo refers to their setting out a week earlier, on August 8, the date that they left the city of Venice itself to proceed to the port of Malamocco on the lagoon. 3. Alvise Cornaro was presumably a relative, as Bembo’s mother was a member of the Cornaro family. 4. Syria and Palestine had been under Ottoman authority since the defeat of the Mam"
