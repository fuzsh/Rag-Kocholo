        "text": "Three years after the proclamation of the \"Islamic State\" (IS), the militants of al-Baghdadi have been driven back from most of the territories they conquered in Iraq. Tikrit, Sinjar, Ramadi, Fallujah and Mosul, once strongholds of the “caliphate”, have been liberated and the group appears unable to keep faith with its motto: baqiya wa tatamaddad (remaining and expanding). Mosul has become the symbol of the rise of the \"Islamic state\" and its fall could represent a real turning point for the land of the two rivers. But several crucial questions remain unanswered: once the auto-proclaimed Islamic State is defeated, what will be the fate of the liberated territories? And the destiny of the so-called disputed areas? Is it possible to fully eradicate IS from the country or is Iraq destined to fight an insurgency for years to come? If Iraq has to remain a “single, independent federal state with full sovereignty”, as indicated in art. 1 of the Iraqi Constitution, how it will be possible to reassemble the pieces of its complex mosaic and to counter the heightening polarization that is threatening the very foundations of its diverse community? What visions of the future have been exhibited by Iraq’s main socio-political actors? What are the interests and agendas of the main regional and international players and how can they influence the future of the country? The volume intends to respond to these questions through a multi-pronged approach presenting the complexity of the Iraqi scenario and the influence exerted over it by a broad array of actors operating at the local, regional and international levels. The first chapter written by Ibrahim al-Marashi set the stage of the debate. The author delineates the main challenges affecting the Iraqi State, focusing on the complexity and fluidity of its inter and intra ethno-sectarian dynamics, as well as on the problems the government has to face at the socio-political, financial, administrative, security and international levels. Giovanni Parigi focuses its analysis on the multiple souls of the Iraqi Shi‘a community, presenting its main socio-political actors, their different agendas, the relations they established with key regional and international players and the the fragility of Shi’a political block much more fragmented than generally assumed. The future of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (KRI) is the subject of the chapter written by Ofra Bengio. The author presents the factors that allowed Erbil to strengthen enormously its autonomy vis a vis Baghdad at the same time underlining the fractures affecting the “other” Iraq. The author examines also the elements supporting the KRI potential bid for independence, presenting also the factors playing against it and the strategies adopted by the main Kurdish socio-political players. Myriam Benraad takes in exam the crisis that invested the Iraqi Sunni community as well as its fractured socio-political spectrum, presenting challenges and opportunities of a community whose marginalization contributed dramatically to IS successes. Marina Calculli focuses instead on the competing Iranian, Turkish and Saudi agendas in Iraq, as well on the potential and the limits of US influence on Baghdad. The chapter presents the strategies adopted by these different players and the patron-client networks they established in the land of the two rivers, underlining the risk stemming from an escalation of the current competition. The last section of the volume deals with the fate of the “Islamic State” in Iraq. After delineating the evolution of the movement and the reasons that allowed it to re-emerge from its ashes in 2010, Andrea Plebani examines IS unique selling points and the strategy it adopted in the region. The last part of the chapter focuses on the possible options IS has at it disposal in Iraq, delineating the status of its remaining strongholds, the important operational capabilities it still retains and the challenges related to its eradication.\n\nThis paper will mainly analyze Ottoman politics of tribe in the province of Baghdad during the nineteenth century, a period in which the tribal organizations began to be incorporated into the modern state mechanisms. It aims to explore the place of the state with particular emphasis on diverse forms of appropriation of political power and center-periphery nexus with the context of tribal structure in Ottoman Iraq. The Ottoman centralization in Iraq aimed to de-construct the tribal structure of the country, because the strong tribal organization was considered as the most significant obstacle for the implementation of the reforms. However, the issue of how to control the disruptive tribes plagued every governor in Baghdad. The policies followed by Ottoman governors against the Iraqi tribes can be summarized as carrot or stick game and they varied considerably from granting favors to certain tribes, creating inter-tribal frictions, recognizing a rival chieftain within a given tribe, the use of military force, incorporation of the tribal structures into the provincial political mechanism, and settlement of the tribal confederations. Taking a close relative (usually the son) of a sheikh into custody in the provincial center was also a policy applied frequently for managing a particular tribe. The stick, in other words, the use of military force came usually when all other methods of “politics of tribe” failed."
