        "text": "Reporting by PMOI/MEK\n\nIran, February 16, 2020—As the mullahs launched pro-regime rallies to portray a popular image of their rule on the 41st anniversary of Iran’s 1979 Revolution, Iranian Resistance Units, a network of activists linked to the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), marked the event with anti-regime activities.\n\nWith their activities, the Resistance Units reflect the will and desire of the Iranian people to overthrow the rule of the mullahs and live in freedom.\n\nIn Karaj, Resistance Units installed a poster of Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), which read: “The regime can’t stop the uprising with killings and arrest.” The slogan is a reference to 1,500 protesters killed by the regime during the November uprisings. The regime’s security forces have also arrested thousands of demonstrators and are torturing them in prisons to intimidate the public and discourage future protests.\n\nElsewhere in Karaj, another Resistance Unit installed a poster of Iranian opposition leader Massoud Rajavi marked with the slogan, “Death to [regime supreme leader Ali] Khamenei, viva Rajavi.”\n\nIn Tehran, Shariati Street, a banner of Massoud and Maryam Rajavi read, “Viva the Mojahedin, death to tyrants, be they the Shah or the supreme leader. My vote is the overthrow of the regime.”\n\nThe latter is a reference to the upcoming parliamentary elections of Iran, which has caused much turmoil in the regime. Khamenei and his cohorts are trying to force the public to come to the ballot boxes and vote. Meanwhile, the people of Iran are making it known that they will boycott the regime and will only vote for regime change.\n\nOther banners installed in Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, and Tabriz, reiterated that the people’s vote is to overthrow the regime.\n\nAt the same time, the rebellious youth of Tehran torched the entrance of the regime’s court in district 7, in Takht Tavoos Street. The regime’s judiciary is much hated across Iran, especially as it continues to hold and torture thousands of protesters who were arrested in the November protests. The head of the judiciary, Ebrahmi Raisi, has a notorious background in killing opposition members and played a pivotal role in the massacre of 30,000 political prisoners during the 1988 massacre.\n\nRebellious youth set fire to the regime's court-Feb 11, 2020\n\nThis is one of several attacks on the regime judiciary system and other regime centers in Tehran and other cities in the past weeks.\n\nIn Isfahan, the rebellious youth set fire to the entrance of a regime center for the fundamentalist education and provision of repressive forces.\n\nAnother explosion, this time in Shiraz, rocked a Revolutionary Guards’ (IRGC) base. The IRGC, a terrorist-designated entity, was the main tool for the repression of protests in November and January, and has been squandering the resources of the Iranian people on developing ballistic missiles and terrorist activities in countries of the Middle East.\n\nRebellious youth attack the regime centers-Isfahan practical training compound and IRGC base-Feb 10, 2020\n\nIn Tabriz, the rebellious youth set fire to a large banner of Qassem Soleimani, the now-dead chief terrorist of the Iranian regime and the former commander of the Quds Force, the foreign terrorism arm of the IRGC. Suleimani was killed in a U.S. drone attack in Iraq, while he was busy planning terrorist attacks against American troops and organizing the repression of popular nationwide protests in the country.\n\nSince Soleimani’s death, the Iranian regime has tried to glorify him and portray him as a national hero by installing his picture across the country and staging expensive ceremonies to commemorate him. In response, the rebellious people of Iran have been tearing down and burning his pictures across the country.\n\nPictures of Soleimani, Khamenei and regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini were torched in Kermanshah, Ahvaz, Behbehan, Semnan, Zarqan, and Kashan. The youth also tore down the regime’s propaganda banners on the occasion of the anniversary of the revolution.\n\nIn Isfahan, the youth set fire to the entrance billboard of a bassij base. The bassij is a subsidiary of the IRGC that is actively involved in the suppression of the people.\n\nRebellious youth torch banners of Soleimani and Khamenei-Feb 10, 2020"
