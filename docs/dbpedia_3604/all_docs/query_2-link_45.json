        "text": "Perisa\n\nBy the 1850’s there were few who disputed that the regional power in the middle east was the Persian Empire and its ruler Shah Karim II. Mohammad Karim Ali Khan Zand. Since defeating the Ottomans in the 1830’s Shah Karim II had used his partners in the Palmetto Trading Company to turn Perisa into a not only a unified nation but he had kicked off an Industrial Revolution that over the last decade had propelled Perisa from a backwards nation into a modern Industrialized nation. With the Perian Palmetto Railway having spawned several offshoot industries in other areas of manufacturing and mining vital to industrial development and defense. Chief among these are the Persian Palmetto Iron Corporation, The Persian Palmetto Mining Corporation, and the Royal Naval Yards at Basrah and Bandar Abbas\n\nMilitary wise the Persians used the 1840’s to completely requip their army with the .56-50 caliber Palmetto trapdoor rifles. They were looking into buying a repeating rifle but having just paid off the bill of buying 600,000 trapdoor rifles and tooling up their new arsenal in Shiraz meant that there was little money in the budget for starting all over again now in the 1850’s. Manpower wise the Imperial Persian Amry consisted of 500,000 officers and enlisted men. Divided up into 5 armies These were the Northwestern Army commanded by Arteshbod (1) Mehran Taheri stationed along the northwestern frontier, the Northeastern Army commanded by Arteshbod Esmaeel Zarqan stationed along the northeastern frontier, the Eastern Army commanded by Aryabod(2) Prince Tahmasp Rouhani Zand placed along the eastern frontier with Afghanistan, the Western Army commanded by Arteshbod Jaffar Frootan and finally the Imperial Guards Army commanded by the Shah himself. To support these armies Perisa had a mandatory conscription law; under this law all men regardless of status of birth had to serve a 3 year term of service upon reaching the age of 15 years old. And learning the example of many countries over the years in 1841 the Shah issued the Imperial Officers Training Law. This mandated that all new officers attend a three year course in military training and tactics at one of the three Imperial Military academies or be able to provide proof of attendance and completion of a military academy in a forgien country. The Eastern and Northeastern Armies would see the most action of any of these armies in the 1840-1860’s, thanks to the near constant raids by Afghan Raiding parties.\n\nThe 1850’s would see the founding of the modern Persian Imperial Navy with the construction of six Ironclad Rams. while nothing revolutionary about being wooden hulled ships with Iron plating bolted on. The Ships carried three guns, a massive muzzle loading 11 inch Smoothbore Randolph guns imported from the Commonwealth of American States mounted on a pivot in the forecastle with five gun ports allowing for 190 degree fring arch. This was supported by two smaller 6.5 inch muzzle loading rifled guns also imported from the Federal Republic of America. Mounted in a small casemate just aft of the mast. The existence of these six ships would tilt the balance of power in the Persian Gulf as the British Persian Gulf Squadron based at Qatar consisted of 30 mostly small wooden ships with its largest ship being the 40 gunned Frigate HMS Marathon.\n\nArteshbod equals full general in western armies\n\nAryabod is equivalent to Field Marshal.\n\nThailand\n\nFor the Siamese the 1850’s were a decade of integration, and consolidation. The Siamese had taken the Malaysian Peninsula from the British and their puppets except for the Island of Singapore where the British had hung on and were now in the process of Fortifying. The Siamese Maylan Railroad was created shortly after the war to collect the patchwork of Railroads the British had started constructing and create a single line to connect Pensular to the Siamese homeland.\n\nThe Siamese Army would spend the 1850’s constructing massive fortification across from British Singapore in what American Newspapers would come to call the Battle of the Fortresses in the south however in the west of the they would become engaged in a ever escalating border war with the Kingdom of Burma a client state of the British Empire. This border War would become so hot by the end of the decade that many leading Siamese officials were talking of possibly invading Burma soon just to put an end to the constant border skirmishes. The Thai Army would convert its Rifled Muskets into Trapdoor Breech Loaders in the 1850’s as well, giving them a semi modern long arm and the Thai Navy would small Casemate Ironclads towards the end of the decade.\n\nThe Empire of Japan\n\nThe 1850s in Japan were a hard time. The nation was struggling to rebuild after the War of Imperial Restoration and the Shogunate leadership took the nation's treasury with it when it fled. This was compiled by the Army and Navy squabbling over what funding there was to modernize in the case of the Army and Rebuild in the case of the navy. In the end the Emperor would choose to put an end to the feuding between the two services by uniting all of the Armed forces into a single organization, the Imperial Japanese Defense Services. The New IJDS would be headed by the Emperor himself; at the top level was the Emperor, the Imperial Defense Minister, and the Samurai Council which would consist of the commanders of the Imperial Ground forces and Naval Forces. The Imperial Ground Forces would be commanded by the Grand Marshal of the Japanese Empire, while the Imperial Navy would be commanded by the Grand Admiral of the Imperial Fleet. The Emperor would hold the Ranks of Lord High Admiral of the Japanese Empire and Imperial Commander General of the Japanese Empire. Making himself the true commander of both services.\n\nThe Japanese economic problems would find an unexpected fix in the winter of 1857 when the British Ambassador paid a visit to the Emperor with a representative from the Imperial Foriegn Exchange Bank. The British were willing to give the Japanese a series of low interest loans so that they could continue their Industrialization, and military expansion programs. The Condition of these loans was that Britain gained favored nation status when it came to Importing goods into Japan. The Emperor was already an Anglophile and agreed to the British terms. The Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty would be signed in the Spring of 1858. By the summer British Gold was paying for new factories, Railroads, and Shipyards to be established in Japan. The Imperial Arsenals in Edo began constructing the Type 15 breech loading Rifle (based upon the Springfield-Sharps Rifle) while in Britain three Ironclads began construction that would become the first ships of the new Japanese Navy. As the Decade ended Emperor Toshihito could finally see a light at the end of the tunnel for his tormented country and he and his military leaders began planning future wars beginning with the invasion of The Republic of Ezo.\n\nThe Heavenly Kingdom Falls from Heaven.\n\nOn October 1, 1852 the Leaders of the Divine Heavenly Kingdom did the most boneheaded thing that could be imagined: they declared war on the 2nd Ming Empire. Had the DHK not spent the last 20 years killing off anyone including military officers who didn’t agree with them or spent even a little bit of money on the means to defend the nation's borders this might not have been suicide; The DHK was twice the size of the 2nd Ming Empire and cold in theory field larger armies. To the North, the Declaration of War suited Emperor Zhu Xiuxiang just fine, his armies were modern well trained and battle hardened from his sack of the Qing Empire, just five years before. He would dispatch a young and coming General named Chen Xuhan south with an army of 125,000 men supported by 36 batteries of field guns.\n\nOn October 24, 1852 Chen Xuhan’s army would run into a DHK Army of 160,000 men was his army was crossing the Shushui River. Chen Xuhan was forced into a defensive battle with his back to a River and the Larger Ganjiang River on his left flank. However what looked like a massive victory in the making for the Divine Army would turn to ashes as their men were cut down by the Muzzle loading Rifled Muskets and Rifled Muzzle loading artillery guns of the Ming Army. the Divine army being armed with Brown Bess Muskets and pitchforks for the most part with only a few outdated small cannons. The Battle of Shushui Crossing would turn into a very lopsided victory with Chen Xuhan’s army managing to not only counter attack and drive the Divine Army off of the field but managed to take some 40,000 prisoners to boot. Having been forced onto the defensive the Divine Army would make its next stand along the Suichuan River. The Battle of the Suichuan would make the Ming army bleed but after two days of fighting would cross the river in three places forcing the Divine Army to abandon its line. Over the course of the next month Chen Xuhan’s army would force the Divine Army back though the rough country between the Suichuan River and the City of Ganzhou which was also the capital of the DHK.\n\nThe Collapse of the Divine Army would cause the British to enact their contingency plans and British troops began moving out of the British occupied ports and seizing control of the countryside. While in Nanjing the British Ambassador would begin working on a treaty with the 2nd Ming Empire. On December 23, 1852 the Treaty of Nanjing would be signed. Under this treaty the British were given control of large areas of the Coast and southern parts of the Divine Heavenly Kingdom. In exchange the British returned the Concession port of Hangzhou to the 2nd Ming Empire, recognized it as the rightful ruler of the rest of the DHK and agreed to pay the 2nd Ming Empire 2.6 million gold pounds for the territory that the British were taking.\n\nFinally on December 7,1852 the Capital would be besieged by Chen Xuhan’s. The Defenders of Ganzhou would hold out until June 12,1853 before they finally surrendered to Chen Xuhan’s Army. Most importantly the Government of the DHK was captured with the city. The Treaty of Ganzhou would be signed the same day. This treaty saw the Annexation of all DHK lands not occupied by the British by the 2nd Ming Empire.\n\nPrussia\n\nFor the Republic of Prussia the 1850s would be a contentious decade for the young republic, In 1852 President Eckhard Kaiser would win his third presidential election however his election was a close won thing as he defeated Frederick von Bismarck by just 6% of the vote 53% to Bismarck’s 47%. For the next two years the Plebeians kept the republic running on its progressive platform passing the national minimum wage, the 60 hour working week and the national pension system for all prussians. These were paid for by taxing the industrialists and nobility.\n\nYet there was a large portion of the population who were not happy with the lack of military development. Indead the Plebeian government had not give the reformed army or the newly created navy much of a budget at all; this was because the Republic had enough money coming in to do either the social programs they wanted to get in place or fund the military so the military was the redheaded stepchild of the Plebeian run government. This would lead to the formation of the Prussian Veterans Party (PVP) in 1852 by Alios Horn following the presidential election. This party was made up of the veterans of the War of Spanish Succession and members of the Military who had been forced out of the service due to the downsizing of the army. The PVP exploded onto the Prussian political world, stealing members away from all but the most left wing of the parties already in existence. By the summer of 1853 without even standing in an election they were the 3rd largest party in the House of Commons and the Senate, thanks to seated members defecting to the party. The Election of 1854 would see the PVP take seats away from the PPP and the PRP almost knocking the latter out of the Senate. The PVP would end up with 30 senate seats, the PPP would hold on to 20 of its seats the Junkers of the Aragrain League kept their guaranteed 25 seats the Adler party would take 15 seats in its first senate election the PFP kept its 5 seats and the PRP was reduced to just 1 seat. Gunther Marx of Berlin would become the Senate Consul as the seanor member of the PPP. Meanwhile in the House of Commons the Adler Party would come in first with 160 seats, the PvP would come in second with 133 seats. The PPP wound up in third with 100 seats The smaller parties came in to round out the house. This meant that the House of Commons and the Senate were held by two different parties with similar but not quite the same goals. The Adler Party would name Theodoric Fischer as the new Prime Minister of Prussia. For President Eckhard Kaiser it was a major defeat despite all his party had done for the Prussian People, the military mentality that the Kasiers had instilled into the people had carried the day. His party was still very much a player being the third most powerful in the House of Commons and second most in the senate but their allies had been so trounced that they could not hope to contest much.\n\nThe PVP and the Adler Party leadership would meet in February of 1855 and work out an agenda that both parties could work toward. For the Adler Party their dreams of restoring the Kaiser in some form were quickly shot down by Alios Horn and the rest of the PVP were firmly anti Kaiser who they viewed as leading Prussia into a pointless war and then running away when shit hit the fan. So the 1855-1859 Parliament would pass a succession of Military acts with the goal to make Prussia once again a military with a nation. This included funding the microscopic Prussian Navy. For his part President Eckhard Kaiser tried to stop it but the two parties could override his veto. It was not surprising that Eckhard Kaiser chose not to run for a 4th term in 1856. That Presidential Election would pit the PVP’s Alios Horn against Frederick von Bismarck of the Adler Party with former Prime Minister Poldi Falk representing the PPP. Falk would carry 23% of the vote, Bismark would carry 37% of the vote, Horn however would win with 39% of the vote. With Eckhard Kaiser out of the Presidency the rearmament of Prussia continued. The in 1858 venerable Needle gun would be Retired in favor of the a Bolt Action designed by Alwin Schröder the Schröder Model 58 would fire an 11mm brass cartridge and had a tubular magazine that held 6 rounds. The 1859 election would simply return the same House of Commons to the Parliament save for the Adler Party losing six seats to the PPP. By the end of the 1850’s Prussia had fully rearmed and was also the first nation in the world with what could be called a modern workplace and social safety nets established.\n\n1849 Prussian House of Commons 375 seats\n\nPrussian Plebeian Party 150 seats\n\nAdler Party 110 seats\n\nPrussian Republican Party 50 seats\n\nAgrarian League 25 seats\n\nPrussian Franciscanist Party 20 seats\n\nMonarchist Party: 15 seats\n\nIndependent: 5 seats\n\n1853 Prussian House of Commons 375 seats\n\nPrussian Plebeian Party 130 seats\n\nAdler Party 110 seats\n\nPrussian Veterans Party 43 seats\n\nPrussian Republican Party 30 seats\n\nAgrarian League 25 seats\n\nPrussian Franciscanist Party 20 seats\n\nMonarchist Party: 15 seats\n\nIndependent: 5 seats\n\n1854 Prussian House of Commons 375 seats\n\nAdler Party 160 seats\n\nPrussian Veterans Party 133 seats\n\nPrussian Plebeian Party 100 seats\n\nPrussian Franciscanist Party 20 seats\n\nAgrarian League 15 seats\n\nMonarchist Party: 10 seats\n\nPrussian Republican Party 5 seats\n\nIndependent: 5 seats\n\n1859 Prussian House of Commons 375 seats\n\nAdler Party 154 seats\n\nPrussian Veterans Party 133 seats\n\nPrussian Plebeian Party 106 seats\n\nPrussian Franciscanist Party 20 seats\n\nAgrarian League 15 seats\n\nMonarchist Party: 10 seats\n\nPrussian Republican Party 5 seats\n\nIndependent: 5 seats\n\n1844 Prussian Senate 100 seats\n\nPrussian Plebeian Party 40 seats\n\nAgrarian League 25 seats\n\nPrussian Veterans Party 20\n\nPrussian Republican Party 10 seats\n\nPrussian Franciscanist Party: 5 seats\n\n1853 Prussian Senate 100 seats\n\nPrussian Plebeian Party 40 seats\n\nAgrarian League 25 seats\n\nPrussian Veterans Party 20\n\nPrussian Republican Party 10 seats\n\nPrussian Franciscanist Party: 5 seats\n\n1854 Prussian Senate 100 seats\n\nPrussian Veterans Party 35 seats\n\nPrussian Plebeian Party 20 seats\n\nAgrarian League 25 seats\n\nAdler Party 13 seats\n\nPrussian Franciscanist Party: 5 seats\n\nPrussian Republican Party 2 seats\n\nPresidents of the Republic of Prussia\n\nEckhard Kaiser (PPP) 1844-1856\n\nAlios Horn (PVP) 186-present\n\nBavaria\n\nTo the South of the Prussian Republic was the Kingdom of Saxony. This Kingdom was a land where 75% of its population had never wanted it to exist; they viewed themselves as Prussians and longed to reunite their lands with Prussia; this meant that the Kingdom of Saxony was a land on the verge of open revolution. The Government of the Kingdom of Saxony was its parliament however that parliament was little more than a rubber stamp for Royal edicts that came From Munich. The Spark that blew up the powder keg that was the Kingdom of Saxony would be lit on October 2, 1854 when the Bavarian garrison executed eight leaders of a pro Prussian newspaper Saxony erupted into open rebellion. In Dresden the Parliament fled the city as rioters set fire to the palace where they met. By October 28, 1854 the Kingdom of Saxony had all but collapsed. Yet the Rebels were not united enough to try and establish a new national identity, indeed many didn’t want their to be a national identity at all they wanted to return to Prussia. And thus the Kingdom of Saxony devolved into a series of feuding city states.\n\nIn Munich King Karl was not taking this lying down. He assembled an Army of 250,000 men supported by artillery and cavalry to restore order in Saxony. He appointed Major General Reinhard Brauer as the commander of the army and Military Governor of Saxony The Army would arrive in Saxony on November 2nd and by the end of the month Saxony was officially back under Bavarian control. Yet, all was not calm, the kingdom was rife with dissent and rebellion so that Bavaria had to keep a standing army in Saxony to Keep order. In an effort to keep order General Brauer would import the Guillotine from France and then start mass production of what he called Klinge des Verräters (the traitor’s blade) For the rest of the decade the Kingdom of Saxony would run red with blood. Then In 1858 Karl gave up on attempting to reinstate a government in Dresden and instead officially annexed Saxony into Bavaria. This caused a great uproar in the Prussian Republic and relations between the two German states already grew arctic in nature by the start of the 1860’s.\n\nThe 1850’s would see the Bavarians modernize their rifled muskets into the Buglarian designed The Laskarili Rifle rifle. The Single shot breech loading rifle was not what many of the military leaders wanted but due to the cost of putting down the ongoing Saxon Ulcer they had to accept a less than modern rifle design that was cheaper to make.\n\nThe Union of German Republics\n\nTo the North of the blood shed and west of the hunger for revenge was the peaceful Union of German Republics which had not only avoided the Bloody Decade but had thanks to is addition of the 2nd Dutch Republic larger. For the dutch the 1850’s offered a chance to use the resources of the UGR to rebuild their trade fleets which is just what they set out to do. It was at the dutch instance that the tiny Volksmarine was transformed into a much larger force now called the Unionsmarine. The newly well funded navy would be built in all of the states that had a seaboard but the two biggest benefactors were Hamburg and the Dutch yards. The Volksarmee would also see the adoption of the Hungarian State Rifle as the Gewehr 1859. All in All the 1850’s were a peaceful time in the UGR but the leaders in Kessel could see the storm clouds building in the east and to the south. Many newspapers in several of the republics were publishing headlines calling for the Union to step in and unite the rest of Germany under the Eagle flag."
