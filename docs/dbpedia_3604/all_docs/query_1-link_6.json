        "text": "We are entering the last lap of the discussions on the Wikimedia 2030 strategic recommendations. Until next Friday, February 21, you can share your feedback, questions, concerns, and other comments.\n\nIn my last 2 messages on this village pump, I described how the recommendations were created, the role of your input, and the next steps. This time, let me describe just one selected recommendation, one that sounds to be particularly close to the activities on wiki: 'Improve User Experience'.\n\nIt states that anyone, irrespectively from their gender, culture, technological background, or physical and mental abilities, should enjoy a fluid, effective, and positive experience during both the consultation and contribution to knowledge. This recommendation is, among others, about the design improvements, user interface, but also training and support programsdedicated resources for newcomers, and, what I personally find especially interesting, mechanisms that allow finding peers with specific interests, roles, and objectives along with communication channels to interact and collaborate.\n\nPlease comment on the recommendations' talk pages. What do you think about this and other recommendations? Should some points be improved, removed, or added?\n\nIf something is not clear, please ping me. I will write back as soon as I can.\n\nSGrabarczuk (WMF) (talk)\n\nI made a clumsy visual representation of the connections between the recommendations (data taken from the sections called Connection to other recommendations). I didn't take into account the cases when a recommendation is connected to all the others. Anyway, I leave making the conclusions to you. In addition, I'm sharing a cloud with the most frequently used words in the recommendations. SGrabarczuk (WMF) (talk)\n\nSorry to be blunt but a link to a specific page that contains information rather than market-speak would be helpful. I can't tell what it's all about. There are glorious sentiments such as \"So that everyone – those already within our movement and anyone who wishes to join – can play an effective role in capturing, sharing, and enabling access to free knowledge.\" However, having everyone join would give very bad results—Wikipedia already has too many people dedicated to pushing their favorite topic such as anti-science nonsense, nationalistic POV pushing, and righting-great-wrongs advocacy. I don't see anything showing an understanding of what actually happens when articles are edited. Johnuniq (talk)\n\n@Johnuniq: that page does contain information :) I think it's just challenging to write complex and abstract thoughts in an accessible style, especially when you have an international team where most of its members prefer to communicate using well-defined, specific terms. SGrabarczuk (WMF) (talk)\n\n@Johnuniq: - given that one of the most raised issues with the consultations has been an inability to comprehend the recommendations due to the level of complexity, coupled with a very abstract level of recommendation (plus the other wikis have translation on top of that), it's not a unique problem. Quite a few of us had asked that the consultation be extended/tolled until they'd been rewritten, but that seems to have been ignored. Nosebagbear (talk)\n\nAnd the bits that are understandable or concrete are too often wrong or misguided. I don't really get how, after two years of writing, rewriting, consultations, group meetings in Tunis, ... we still get things[1] like \"Even if Wikipedia remains relevant as a text-based repository, we have the opportunity to serve knowledge consumers better if we widen our scope and diversify by offering different types of free knowledge. These could include a recombination of audiovisual and textual content, dimensional and geospatial content, augmented reality in context, computer-generated avatars, procedures for the user to test their knowledge acquisition, simulation scenarios, or so-called serious games as new project formats compatible with peer curation workflows\" (emphasis mine). Since when are \"computer generated avatars\" a type of knowledge?Reading this recommendation, the conclusion seems to be \"by 2030, text-based Wikipedia will probably no longer be relevant, but who cares, we will have computer-generated avatars and 'dimensional content' (sic)\". Fram (talk)\n\nI guess, compare, Computer generated imagery, with Social constructionism (or, \"Socratic method\" in text, with computer generated Socratic method [2].) Alanscottwalker (talk)\n\nLeigh Rayment's peerage pages (and MP pages, and various other pages) are widely used as a source in related parts of Wikipedia, see Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating a Leigh Rayment's Peerage Pages template. I learn from this discussion that Mr Rayment died a year ago, and that his website is scheduled to go the same way later this month. We probably need to do something... Chuntuk (talk)\n\n@Chuntuk: As one of the participants in that discussion mentions, much of his site has been archived by the Wayback Machine. See WP:Citing sources#Preventing and repairing dead links for information on how to make use of that resource for our references. — Aᴋʀᴀʙʙıᴍ talk\n\nYou could also try reaching out to the community at WP:WikiProject Peerage and Baronetage. — Aᴋʀᴀʙʙıᴍ talk\n\nIn some situations, a {{Citation needed}} → [citation needed] tag can be unreasonably disruptive to appearance. I know the idea is to draw attention, but sometimes it's just excessive, like in table cells that cause a whole column to stretch. Does anyone know of an abbreviated form that accomplishes the same thing but maybe appear something like this:[CN!]?\n\nAlternatively, how about doing something like this:<ref>{{Citation needed}}</ref> , which puts the [citation needed] in the references list instead,similar to what we do with {{Dead link}}? —[AlanM1(talk)]—\n\nI agree we should have something of this sort. Perhaps a question mark would work.[?] Would an abbreviation be less understandable or would readers be quick to figure it out?[cn] Placing the tags in the reflist would make it difficult to see which statements are unsourced.[🤔] – Thjarkur (talk)\n\nThe real solution is to put the citation that's needed. Headbomb {t · c · p · b}\n\n^^^This. I don't think obscuring a problem is a good idea. Also this would be equivalent to prominent display of tags at the top of articles which the community equally rejected calls to move them to talk pages, when similar argument as yours were brought on various occasions in the past. – Ammarpad (talk)\n\nHello. Russian tax code contains a tax deduction allowing natural persons to reduce their taxable income by the total amount they donated to nonprofit organizations including educational ones (more precisely, this means they can refund themselves up to 25 % of the tax their employers and other Russian-based tax agents paid for them in the year when they made the donations).\n\nI'm thinking about suggesting in my Russophone Wikimedia community that a page be created on the Wikimedia Russia website with information about the said tax deduction. So, what I want to ask is would such a page be acceptable at all under the Wikimedia-wide legal disclaimer and if yes, what it appropriate format could be (e. g. one paragraph with short information about the deduction, and another with a phrase containing a link to the Legal disclaimer and an advice to contact the Russian tax service for any inquiries, and possibly the latter's hotline for taxpayers which is toll-free when called from any Russian phone number)?\n\nWikimedia Russia has been refusing foreign donations to avoid being classified as a foreign agent after Russia enacted that law in 2012. Since the chances of it reversing its position or the law being repealed are pretty low, I think that a page about the tax deduction could be an incentive potentially increasing donations from Russian citizens to the chapter. P.S. Sorry for being too wordy. --Синкретик (talk)\n\n@Синкретик: I suggest you contact the WMF meta:Legal for this question, it is not something that the English Wikipedia editors would be best at answering for you. — xaosflux Talk\n\nSorry if this isn't the right place to ask, but this didn't seem like a question that would fit in with the WP:HD or WP:RD. Wikipedia.com states that the English Wikipedia has 5,994,000+ articles and since it's been a while since the six millionth article was reached, I was wondering if there's any available information on how often this is updated? I usually type in wikipedia.org and see the article-counter on the main page. I'm asking this question out of curiousity. Clovermoss (talk)\n\n@Clovermoss: wikipedia.com is a redirect to wikipedia.org. It gets updates usually every few weeks see also phab:T128546. — xaosflux Talk\n\nI have put in a request for a local banner notice for the New York metropolitan area to share the numerous Women's History Month / Art+Feminism events in March at m:CentralNotice/Request/Women's History Month and Art+Feminism NYC 2020.--Pharos (talk)\n\nHi, I hope that I posted at the right place (I am usually more active on wikidata or the french wikipedia). For french speaking folks, there was a article a few days ago titled \"Sur Wikipédia, les vies rêvées de Juan Branco\" (\"On Wikipedia, the dreamed lives of Juan Franco\"), in Le Figaro on the Juan Branco page. The french community have been discussing that on the talk page of the article among others, and a warning was placed on the english talk page. While self promotion is nothing new, that has been going on since a long time, with sock puppets allegations, repeated edit warring, push to create page since years, and even a story of email to a employer to get a contributor fired. So we figured this would warrant a more visible communication to the community as well, since the english and spanish Wikipedias were also impacted. If people can't access the article, we have a dedicated page for that fr:WP:ASPP, so folks should be able to contact someone who has. Also, my spanish skills are not good enough to write in spanish, but if someone could relay the info on es:Wikipedia:Café, that would be appreciated. --Misc (talk)\n\n@Misc: I copied most of your message above to the conflict of interest noticeboard. - Bri.public (talk)\n\nHello, I feel happy to announce on behalf of the Urdu Wikipedia community that we have today launched our social media handles for the betterment of Wikipedia. We shall work on these platforms to promote the ethos of Wikipedia. I request the Wikipedia brethren to help Urdu Wikipedia by following us on social platforms.\n\nUrdu Wikipedia on Facebook\n\nUrdu Wikipedia on Twitter\n\nUrdu Wikipedia on Instagram\n\nAaqib Anjum Aafī (talk)\n\nthat is great news. Thank you for letting us know. Congratulations!! Welcome!!\n\nبڑی خوشخبری ہے۔ ہمیں بتانے کا شکریہ۔ مبارک ہو !! خوش آمدید!!\n\nthanks! --Sm8900 (talk)\n\nThis is so nice of you. Aaqib Anjum Aafī (talk)\n\nIt seems that FAQ sections are added on a case-by-case basis for questions or topics that are constantly recurring in talk pages. I'd like to learn how to add a fair, productive FAQ section for a topic and understand what the community thinking is on this.\n\nWhat's the best way of contacting people who've done this before?\n\n--ProbablyAndrewKuznetsov (talk)\n\nProbablyAndrewKuznetsov, I don't know if it's the best way, but you could check the edit history of talk pages with FAQ:s, figure out who added/contributed to the FAQ, and talk to them at their talk page if they are still around. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk)\n\nMaybe Talk:Chemtrail_conspiracy_theory#Draft_FAQ can give you a little inspiration. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk)\n\nOn mobile, that draft FAQ collapsible box gets shoved into a separate “about this page” view. Pelagic (talk)\n\nWhen making talk page archives, do I need to put in things like a GOCE newsletter or the signpost, or just the main stuff? Is there a policy page for making talk page archives? Emicho's Avenger (talk)\n\n@Emicho's Avenger: so policy-wise, unless you are making your archives by \"moving\" your talk page to a subpage you don't have to put anything at all in there. The standard convention is that if you use an archive page by copying your text to it, you keep all the discussions that include a real person - so it is safe to leave out anything that is bot-only like a newsletter if you want. — xaosflux Talk\n\nHello. Is there a place or a way I can upload a 1 Gb PDF released under the CC NC 1.0 license on a Wiki-related website? I cannot upload it on Commons since the license is non-commercial only, and Wikipedia is limited to files of max. 100MB. Veverve (talk)\n\nDear Veverve, the CC NC licence is non-free, so such files are not allowed in the Wikimedia projects. You should better use another website to publish the file. --NaBUru38 (talk)\n\nVeverve: The non-profit Internet Archive (upload page: https://archive.org/create/) would be a good fit, I'd say. Their mission is educational, and their licensing requirement boils down to things \"you have the right to share\", for which CC-NC should do just fine. —{{u|Goldenshimmer}} (they/them)｜Talk｜Contributions\n\nWe may have until March 6, 2020 to respond to this: m:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2018-20/Reports/Summary of Movement Conversations 2020. George Ho (talk)\n\nWhere do we respond? Please provide a link. Blueboar (talk)\n\nIn the meantime... could someone explain what a “shareholder” is? I assume they are not using the term in its financial sense... Is it just a fancy way of saying “editors”? Blueboar (talk)\n\nThe term \"shareholder\" does not appear in the document? --Yair rand (talk)\n\nPerhaps \"stakeholder\" was the intended term. – Teratix ₵\n\nYes... sorry... stakeholder. Whatvis a “steakholder”... This seems to be jargon. Are they referring to what we call Editors? Someone else? Blueboar (talk)\n\nPeter, I think you accidentally self-reverted your comments about \"stakeholder\", explained in the Glossary. The string of symbols, which you intended to remove, were already removed (or self-reverted). -- George Ho (talk)\n\nLink: m:Talk:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2018-20/Reports/Summary of Movement Conversations 2020. --George Ho (talk)\n\nThanks George Ho. Something very odd happened there, but I don't know exactly what it was. It all looked right on the page after my last edit. Cheers, · · · Peter Southwood (talk):\n\nI suspect that you hit the 'Back' button in your browser window. If you're not using the 2017 wikitext editor (VisualEditor's wikitext mode; because it loads pages differently), then it appears that the edit-conflict software will effectively produce a self-revert. Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nHi, I recently found my user page appearing in a Google search via \"en.wikiredia.com/wiki/...\" (with an \"r\" instead of the \"p\"). I can't find anything about this site online and thought user pages should not appear in web searches. I'd be grateful for any further information please. Thanks. ~ RLO1729💬\n\n@RLO1729: As far as I can see, it's not only \"r\" but also the domain suffix \".com\" instead of \".org\" in the URL you gave. --CiaPan (talk)\n\nTrue. You seem to be there too: add your user name to \"https://en.wikiredia.com/wiki/User:\". Is it an unauthorised mirror site and what can be done about restricting access to user pages? Or do we just put notices on the genuine pages? ~ RLO1729💬\n\nI've just been reading Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks and will add the site to the list. But do other mirror sites also mirror user pages? ~ RLO1729💬\n\nThere is certainly no reason why they shouldn't, as long as the attribution requirements of our licence are met. User page content is released under the same terms as article content. At the bottom of every editing window are the words, \"By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use, and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 3.0 License and the GFDL. You agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution under the Creative Commons license.\" Phil Bridger (talk)\n\nThanks Phil, I guess my concern/surprise is more at seeing my user page in Google results when Wikipedia sets user pages by default to \"no indexing\" by search engines. ~ RLO1729💬\n\nAnd there is no attribution at all on this mirror site, it seems to be a remote loading site. ~ RLO1729💬\n\nYes, I see. That site just seems to copy Wikipedia pages without providing any of the required attribution, and messing up the format while doing so. I doubt that there is in practice much that you can do about it, but you could try the procedures outlined at Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks. Phil Bridger (talk)\n\nIt seems everyone's user pages are being mirrored. I've added the site to the list of mirrors but there doesn't seem to be a way to contact the owner directly. Unfortunately I don't have the technical skills to take it any further. ~ RLO1729💬\n\n{{userpage}} can be a useful addition to your user page. That way, those viewing your page at mirror sites will at least know they're doing so.

Federal Register. 19 February 2020. Please note the bolded portions below for instructions on the deadline, email address, and question/answer format in which comments are requested.\n\nFor those who are in the US, the Office of Science and Technology Policy is taking public comment on making unclassified published research, digital scientific data, and code supported by the U.S. Government open to the public. Email to comment please. This aligns with our mission. GMGtalk\n\nThis is profoundly important, so I am quoting the (public domain US federal) solicitation in full:\n\n“ Request for Information: Public Access to Peer-Reviewed Scholarly Publications, Data, and Code Resulting From Federally Funded Research\n\nA Notice by the Science and Technology Policy Office on 02/19/2020\n\nDOCUMENT DETAILS Printed version: PDF Publication Date: 02/19/2020 Agency: Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Document Citation: 85 FR 9488 Page: 9488-9489 (2 pages) Document Number: 2020-03189 DOCUMENT STATISTICS Page views: 8,397 as of 03/02/2020 at 4:15 am EST\n\nACTION: Notice of request for information (RFI).\n\nSUMMARY: OSTP, and the National Science and Technology Council's (NSTC) Subcommittee on Open Science (SOS), are engaged in ongoing efforts to facilitate implementation and compliance with the 2013 memorandum Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research [1] and to address recommended actions made by the Government Accountability Office in a November 2019 report.[2] OSTP and the SOS continue to explore opportunities to increase access to unclassified published research, digital scientific data, and code supported by the U.S. Government. This RFI aims to provide all interested individuals and organizations with the opportunity to provide recommendations on approaches for ensuring broad public access to the peer-reviewed scholarly publications, data, and code that result from federally funded scientific research.\n\nDATES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments on or before 5:00 p.m. ET on March 16, 2020.\n\nADDRESSES: Comments submitted in response to this notice may be submitted online to Lisa Nichols, Assistant Director for Academic Engagement, OSTP, at publicaccess@ostp.eop.gov. Email submissions should be machine-readable [pdf, doc, txt] and not copy-protected. Submissions should include “RFI Response: Public Access” in the subject line of the message.\n\nInstructions: Response to this RFI is voluntary. Each individual or institution is requested to submit only one response. Submission must not exceed 5 pages in 12 points or larger font, with a page number provided on each page. Responses should include the name of the person(s) or organization(s) filing the comment. Comments containing references, studies, research, and other empirical data that are not widely published should include copies or electronic links of the referenced materials. No business proprietary information, copyrighted information, or personally identifiable information should be submitted in response to this RFI.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For additional information, please direct your questions to Lisa Nichols at publicaccess@ostp.eop.gov.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In February of 2013, OSTP issued the memorandum Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research. The memorandum directed Federal agencies with more than $100M in research and development (R&D) expenditures to develop plans to make the results of federally funded unclassified research that are published in peer-reviewed publications, and digitally formatted scientific data, publicly available. The federal agency plans required that published work be made available following a twelve-month post-publication embargo period.\n\nOSTP and the NSTC SOS continue to explore opportunities to make the knowledge, information and data generated by federally funded research more readily accessible to students, clinicians, businesses, entrepreneurs, researchers, technologists, and the general public who support these investments as a means to accelerate knowledge and innovation. Over the course of the last two years, OSTP has had nearly 100 meetings with stakeholders on open science, the current policy on public access to the results of federally funded research, the evolution of scholarly communications, and access to data and code associated with published results. This RFI aims to expand on these consultations and provide all interested individuals and organizations with the opportunity to provide recommendations on approaches for ensuring broad public access to the peer-reviewed scholarly publications, data, and code that result from federally funded scientific research. OSTP is interested in perspectives on the following topics:\n\nWhat current limitations exist to the effective communication of research outputs (publications, data, and code) and how might communications evolve to accelerate public access while advancing the quality of scientific research? What are the barriers to and opportunities for change? What more can Federal agencies do to make tax-payer funded research results, including peer-reviewed author manuscripts, data, and code funded by the Federal Government, freely and publicly accessible in a way that minimizes delay, maximizes access, and enhances usability? How can the Federal Government engage with other sectors to achieve these goals? How would American science leadership and American competitiveness benefit from immediate access to these resources? What are the potential challenges and effective approaches for overcoming them? Analyses that weigh the trade-offs of different approaches and models, especially those that provide data, will be particularly helpful.

EllenCT (talk)\n\n@Doc James: is there any way to get the Wikimedia Foundation and/or board to make an official comment (ideally in support)? — Wug·a·po·des​\n\nSending responses as individual Wikipedians I believe would be helpful as well. User:Katherine (WMF) would be the one to make the call on it from a WMF perspective. Doc James (talk · contribs · email)\n\nI'll be the no-fun brigade here, but two points:\n\nI question how much this will matter. I suppose if nobody comments at all, that'd be bad, but we shouldn't delude ourselves these requests for comment are susceptible to such campaigns. See the 2017 Net Neutrality debate with the FCC for example: https://www.wired.com/story/bots-broke-fcc-public-comment-system/ , where the site crashed with legitimate complaints from people who watched John Oliver, as well as having a ton of bot and bot-aided comments. None of it mattered, Ajit Pai & co. smashed up net neutrality anyway.\n\nWith the current administration... be careful what you wish for. See the article Attorney General of Virginia's climate science investigation for a taste of what this proposal is actually likely to accomplish (usual disclaimer: some Wikipedians may be happy with an outcome like this, of course). If this proposal does go through, I'd fully expect that it'll be less about funding scientists to help them post data in easily accessible web databases, and more about threatening to defund any federal research that doesn't send over every single email sent ever so that the most embarrassing / blunt ones can be sent over to the Washington Examiner and made into tabloidy headlines about how scientists are biased and making up a climate change hoax.\n\nI would be happy to be wrong on both counts, of course, but realistically the prospect of the above two scenarios should be considered - your emails might be ignored, and if they aren't and succeed, they might not have the impact you're expecting.

Viruscorona2020 (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nI have an idea for a new article. I would like to see a single article outlining the different lessons medical practitioners and the system have learned during the COVID-19 outbreak with sections for each affected country and region where information is available. This could include hospital triage systems, unique practices (like drive-thru testing in South Korea), and country-specific medical research on vaccines, etc. For example, BBC has good coverage on South Korea: At least two patients died waiting for a hospital bed in Daegu, the worst affected city. The initial reaction was to quarantine everyone infected with the virus in a hospital bed, but now the doctors have learned to treat those with mild symptoms in residential centres and leave the clinical beds for those needing critical care.\n\nI propose one distinct article for this because:\n\nThe main article on the outbreak will get too long if all this detailed information is included there.\n\nThe medical advances are in and of themselves, notable and interest worthy.\n\nThe country-specific articles are full of statistics and someone would have to click on each article to compare and contrast.\n\nThe article would make a good addition to the template we have at the bottom of all COVID-19-related articles.\n\n2607:FEA8:1DDF:FEE1:81AE:8E3C:BF30:D275 (talk)\n\nAnyone can start a new article at anytime. There's no requirement to propose it first. I'd advise you to make use of WP:YFA and start a draft, or you can request it at Wikipedia:Requested articles if you prefer someone else to write it. The latter way is notably slower though. – Ammarpad (talk)\n\n@2607:FEA8:1DDF:FEE1:81AE:8E3C:BF30:D275: - I'd suggest asking at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine - medical articles have extra rules, and many of the pros at handling them can be found there. Nosebagbear (talk)\n\nHi, could the current coronavirus map in the main page (File:COVID-19 Outbreak World Map.svg) be replaced for now by File:COVID-19 Outbreak World Map (33).svg or any version suitable? File:COVID-19 Outbreak World Map.svg is cascade protected by the main page, and it is affecting users at Commons who want to update the map. Thanks, Pandakekok9 (talk)\n\nMap image on main page has been switched so the protections can be removed. --Masem (t)\n\nPandakekok9 In the future, this kind of request is suitable for Talk:Main page and WP:AN. --Izno (talk)\n\nThanks, noted just in case I need to start a request like this again. :) Pandakekok9 (talk)\n\n@Pandakekok9: Is there a centralized discussion on Commons about this?

If it has, then you can run a pretty easy query to extract the information. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThere's a historical photo I want to use that's on another website. I don't know the exact date, but I'm guessing it's not old enough to be PD yet, so I can't upload it to Commons, and for the sake of argument, I'm going to assume it wouldn't pass the WP:FAIRUSE requirements. Is there any reason I can't link to it in a footnote, and discuss it in the text of the article. Any stylistic recommendations for how one would phrase that? The goal is to support the statement, The area to the west of the press building, along Tiffany Street and Garrison Avenue, originally had manicured lawns, a curved driveway, and a pedestrian walk flanked by lampposts. The lawns have since been turned into a paved parking lot -- RoySmith (talk)\n\nSee Template:External media as an option. As Template:External media/doc#Where to use says, \"This template is normally placed in the main body of the article, in the same place that you would normally have placed the image\". Zzyzx11 (talk)\n\nYeah, that's what I had in mind. Unfortunately, reading the docs, I've come to the conclusion that this would probably violate WP:ELNEVER. -- RoySmith (talk)\n\nI don't see why WP:ELNEVER would be a problem, although some like to remove all possible external links. However, that image cannot be used to verify the statement in the OP. Johnuniq (talk)\n\nELNEVER would be a problem if the other website doesn't have a license to post the copyrighted material. WP:LINKVIO is banned on all pages, including this one. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nAs a rule, I never post messages here, at the Village Pump, as I am mostly active on the French WP. However, I felt appropriate to mourn here the death of Robert Ferrieux, a long-standing and notable French WP editor, holder of an Agrégation degree in English, and who, as such, contributed to many featured articles on English litterature on the French WP.\n\nRobert died day before yesterday in Perpignan, aged 89. We had first met on WP some twelve years ago, when trying to improve the article about Robert Browning. He had been married for some sixty years to Helen, his British wife. Many years ago, he had been a French resident at Eton College, and retained an interest for all things British ever since. Beyond his deep knowledge of British litterature, Robert was warm and friendly, always ready to help along.\n\nWe mourn for him, Cédric Boissière, Eymery, myself, and many others on the French WP; we will never forget our happy collaboration for all these years. Azurfrog (talk)\n\nWhile editing Orgasm, I noticed EISP somehow redicts to it. I can understand why it would do so, historically, because there they were probably talking about exercise induced orgasm in females, at one time. Fine. But however it may lie, the current redirection structure is not conducive to a readable encyclopedia. EISP in that sense is peripheral enough to not even warrant its own Wikipedia page under a different name, yet now for some reason the page on The Big O—of all things, amongst us sexually reproducing animals, motivated by the very thing—brings in disambiguation words relating to English International School Prague.\n\nPlease somebody mop up that mess, because I don't know how. While disambiguation with regard to \"orgasm\" is probably going to be necessary till the end of days, it's completely frivolous and counter-productive wrt \"EISP\" in the orgasmic context. Decoy (talk)\n\nIt would be enough to change a redirect to the school and move the explaining {{redirect}} there to expand EISP and link to the article about orgasm. --CiaPan (talk)\n\nIt's being discussed at Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2020 March 16#EISP. --CiaPan (talk)\n\nToday's NY Times Crossword. 50A clue: \"Dispute between Wikipedia page updaters\". -- RoySmith (talk)\n\nFour letters, starts with L? – Teratix ₵\n\nWikipedia:The impending doom of Wikipedia GMGtalk\n\nPlease note that Betty Williams died on 18 march according to sources. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.185.175.84 (talk)\n\nHer death is already in Betty Williams (Nobel laureate).

And I saw a mention that \"MediaWiki 1.35\" is supposed to be rolled out over the next week. I do not follow the tech news so this is the first I have heard about it. Where can I learn more about this? Is it a minor tweak or a whole new editing system? Will we be able to revert to the current system if we don’t like it? Sorry if failure to know about this make me out to be a clueless luddite, but there are lot of us out here. And I have been through times before when the WMF suddenly imposed a change that only the technically tuned-in knew was coming. What’s it about? -- MelanieN (talk)\n\n​Wikipedia has been on 1.35 since October, there were very few user facing changes. There's a minor update published almost every week, the update Tech News is referring to (\"1.35.0-wmf.25\") doesn't yet have a changelog as far as I can tell, but it's usually just various tweaks. – Thjarkur (talk)\n\nThanks for the helpful reply, Thjarkur. -- MelanieN (talk)\n\nThese are all the same kinds of changes that happen almost every WP:THURSDAY year-round.

Cheers, Ocaasi t | c\n\nI sent the complete list of Census URLs (from every wiki language including wikidata and commons) to archive.today and they have been slowly archiving them so we will have them captured, assuming their batch job completes. The Census JavaScript is FUBAR so Wayback won't save the page correctly most of the time, but archive.today saves them OK. -- GreenC\n\nMore from IA (see above comment, he's the source):\n\nWe know about this and have worked a long time on it. We roped in a couple programmers to help out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:US_Census_Migration. Problem is that the census site is so deeply problematic we may only be able to switch the links to archive versions, and only to archive.today as Wayback doesn't really capture the pages due to US Census messed up JS code. We sent the complete list of every URL from every wiki language to archive.today and they were slowing archiving them but have not checked in recently to check on status. Ocaasi t | c\n\nThe batch save at archive.today is done, about 54k links. Now working to update the IABot database. -- GreenC\n\nI've been looking at the large number of RFCs about COVID-19. There seems to be some confusion about the Wikipedia:Requests for comment process, in ways that paralleled the large number of RFCs about e-cigarettes. I therefore offer the following reminders:\n\nAn RFC is a way to request comments, not votes. If the result you want is a binding vote, then you're in the wrong place entirely.\n\nDon't be fooled by the popularity of a ===Survey=== section among inexperienced editors: what matters is the quality of the discussion, not the word at the start of each comment. (Also, see Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Example formatting if you want to figure out which format you ought to use for your question.)\n\nAn RFC is a way to request comments from outside editors. If the people already on the page can settle the question without an RFC, then please don't spam a bunch of uninvolved editors.\n\nAn RFC is a resource-intensive method of holding a discussion. RFCs use a lot of other editors' time, energy, and attention. Unnecessary RFCs waste those precious resources. Please don't start an RFC until you've actually tried to answer the question.\n\nIf someone starts an RFC every time editors want a decision made, or if you're personally starting more than two or three RFCs per month, then you are screwing up.\n\nIf your real problem is that you can't figure out what the Wikipedia:Consensus is in a discussion unless you can count up \"support\" and \"oppose\" words and assume that the consensus is the same as a majority vote, then ask just an editor with more experience (e.g., almost any admin) to summarize the result for you.\n\nIf you have questions about the RFC process, then please feel free to ask those questions at WT:RFC, or to ping me (or any of the long-time editors on that page) to any discussion. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nIf anything can be said to be widespread at enwiki, it's the use of the Survey format to clarify editors' positions. It's incorrect to say it's used among inexperienced editors, implying that experienced editors know better. What's wrong, per Wikipedia-is-not-a-democracy, is to vote without an argument; that's why the now-ubiquitous term !vote (not-vote) was coined. ―Mandruss ☎\n\nI find that some less experienced editors gravitate towards the ===Survey=== format, possibly because they saw someone else do it (and therefore thought that was the \"right\" or more \"official\" way to do it), possibly because they struggle to interpret consensus in a discussion if the comments don't come with a label (this was likely the case in many of the ecig RFCs), or possibly because they actually want a majority vote instead of a discussion. I find that more experienced editors use a variety of formats, depending upon the nature of the question they're asking, the number of responses they expect, and the result they're hoping to produce (sometimes including, in the case of some of the ecig RFCs, an easily counted super-majority vote whose main purpose was to convince one particular editor that the consensus achieved in the prior discussion really did disagree with that editor's beliefs).\n\nAs for it being \"widespread\", I just looked at 30 current RFCs. Only three (10%) had a ===Survey=== section heading, and three others had something similar (including one that said ===Comments===, which mightn't be considered entirely similar, depending upon your POV). That means that 80% of RFCs don't use it. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nNot sure where I should post this, so I'm posting it here.\n\nI just noticed that a number of images AbysinniaGuard uploaded to Commons but are used here on en.wikipedia have been nominated for deletion there because they violate their rules for inclusion. (Yes, this is another iteration in an ongoing saga.) Some, however, don't violate our rules, & had they been uploaded for use solely on en.wikipedia probably would not be at risk of deletion under our rules -- I'm thinking specifically of examples like File:West Gojjam.png. Rather than arguing over there to keep them -- honestly, if Commons doesn't want to store files for some reason, what should it matter to us? -- it might make better sense to simply avoid uploading files to Common in the first place & keep them here. Or instead of arguing with the folks at Commons, move such files over here, thus keeping the peace between the projects.\n\nBut to the immediate problem. Is there a way to download that portion to our space in one action, versus doing it one at a time, while worrying about keeping the chain of authorship intact? (Someone tries to do a good deed & ends up running afoul of our sometimes arcane & confusing rules. As if this has never happened before.) This appears to be the issue with these files over there, & in the case of maps like the example I provided any problem can be solved by either WP:FAIRUSE or WP:IAR. -- llywrch (talk)\n\nAFAIK there isn't really one beyond downloading the Commos file and reuploading it locally with appropriate information. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk)\n\nAt a quick glance at c:Commons:Deletion requests/Files uploaded by AbysinniaGuard and c:User talk:AbysinniaGuard, it looks like the \"their rules for inclusion\" in question are \"accurately reflects the source and license of the work\". We have that rule too. For WP:FAIRUSE to apply, you'd need to include the original source of the images rather than the seemingly-bogus \"own work\" used on all of them. And if you want to apply WP:IAR to ignore rules about copyright and media attribution, you'll need an extremely convincing argument. Anomie⚔\n\nYeah, the issue is that the uploader at commons is \"license washing\" which is no way acceptable. The West Gojjam image, if it was created by a Wikepdian and uploaded otherwise appropriately, would be fine both here and commons. This is not a discontinuity issue between media aspects here. --Masem (t)\n\n(edit conflict) For the maps in particular, the ones I looked at seem extremely similar to File:Ethiopia zones.png or File:Ethiopia districts.png, slightly altered and with the relevant zone colored in red. Commons would likely be happy to keep such images if they were correctly attributed with the source of the base map. You might want to talk to WikiProject Maps about recreating them, particularly whether they have a better SVG source to derive from instead of coloring in PNGs. Anomie⚔\n\nWe all know that newbie & less devoted contributors have a problem understanding copyright & Wikipedia processes: it is not special pleading to assume that in this case a mistake was made. Further, having stared at more than my share of maps, I can attest that most details on maps are fungible -- especially administrative boundaries, which is this case. About the only way one can prove a given map has been plagiarized is by identifying errors, either accidental or intentional. Maps are composed of facts, & facts cannot be copyrighted. My assertion that there is a difference in policy between en.wikipedia & Commons is based on the goals of the two projects: Commons is a repository of free (as in speech) files, so the burden of proof that a given file is not unfree lies on the contributor; in contrast, Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, where the goal is to provide information that is free, but to do so we sometimes must compromise by using non-free files. (This should not come as a surprise to anyone.) Where Commons think it a good thing to check & double-check every qualification for inclusion, Wikipedia is willing to be less strict; there was a case a few years back that led to much disagreement over how strict to be on this point, which emphasizes that the community's consensus on creating an encyclopedia is stronger than the consensus on ideological purity. (I admit there were other factors involved, but they effected the passion of the disagreement, not its fundamental points.) Further, people who engage in this double-checking are often perceived to be wasting time that should be spent on improving content. (IMHO, in some cases they are.) Hence my assertion of a disagreement, & the corollary that sometimes even with free files, we should not unthinkingly upload them to Commons. By keeping those cases over here, friction between projects is reduced & we have more time to focus on our core mission - writing an encyclopedia. -- llywrch (talk)\n\nHi!

She's been adding recently a lot of links in Chinese zodiac related articles about peoples and celebrities born under each zodiac sign. Some of those celebrities are mentioned in correct articles but there's also plenty of those that are not. Because of this I warned her not once but twice about her edits in those articles. She didn't listen and instead of doing something for it she removed my second warning from her talk page. What do you think we should do with this situation? Santtu37 (talk)\n\nSanttu37, those articles seem to contain a lot of unsourced WP:BLPs' names. As zodiac stuff is quasi-religious/superstition, that probably counts as \"contentious matter\" under the BLP policy. I suggest that you ask for help at WP:BLPN.\n\nOn a side note, I wonder whether a Wikidata query might not be a suitable replacement. An external link to \"List of Wikipedia articles about people born in this year\" sounds feasible. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThis behavior is inappropriate. The Chinese zodiac is also trivially derived from the year, meaning it is duplicate information. I would recommend reverting and warning the user. If, as you say, she's been warned, you need to go to WP:ANI for help. --Izno (talk)\n\nGiven the unfolding global events, the Wikimedia Foundations feels it is important to reassure readers across the globe.\n\nWe'll be displaying a short message at the top of the projects reaffirming our commitment to keep Wikipedia and the Wikimedia projects online, open and free for all.

It is a bit unusual that this was forced out without even participating in our discussion to add this as a site notice (c.f. current discussions at Wikipedia talk:In the news) and that while it is sending thanks to the \"contributors\" it is hidden from logged in editors as well.

Phil Bridger (talk)\n\nSee also current move discussions at Talk:Uruchcha (Minsk Metro), Talk:Park Chalyuskintsaw (Minsk Metro), Talk:Barysaŭski trakt and possibly others. A centralized discussion might be a better idea. In fact, User:Phil Bridger (above) has proposed having a single discussion at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Cyrillic)#Problem with transliteration of Belarusian geographical names. EdJohnston (talk)\n\nAll names should be moved according to Instruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script as it's the only system in use for now. System is in use [5], [6] on official level so all road signs and maps are made according to this instruction. --Red Winged Duck (talk)\n\nWe have an article at Instruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script but that is an instruction from the Belarusian government, not from Wikipedia. The closest thing we have to a Wikipedia convention is what is written at WP:Naming conventions (Cyrillic). Take a look at the section on Belarusian. It is common for languages to have more than one Latin script. For example see Romanization of Greek. EdJohnston (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Naming conventions (Cyrillic) says \"This proposal has become dormant through lack of discussion by the community\", so it cannot be used as reference. If we look one level up at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) for Belarus it says: \"Major cities (voblast capitals) are named according to the most common English usage. All other settlements are named according to national rules (exceptions may be discussed case by case)\". And the only national system for now is Instruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script. I think new guidelines for Belarusian should be discussed and accepted. --Red Winged Duck (talk)\n\nYes, and, as you have taken part in the discussion you must be aware, discussion of changes has been proposed at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#I am fed up with edit-warring against consensus in Eastern European articles and should be taken forward by an interested party in the form of a neutrally-worded RFC.

So, just because you don't see the page in your search results doesn't mean Google hasn't indexed it. You can always use the \"site:\" modifier to narrow down your search to just a specific wiki, or even a specific article, as I've done with this search. -- RoySmith (talk)\n\nI'm posting here to acknowledge the amazing effort put in by User:GreenC to avoid a major case of bit-rot.

Quiddity (WMF) (talk)\n\nGreetings, Wikipedians! I hope this finds you well, despite our challenging circumstances. My name is Nathaniel James, and I’m researching and writing a book that I hope will be of interest to the community and which will require some participation by lots of community members to be a success.\n\nThe working title for my book is How to Build a Fact: The Wikipedia Paradox and the Perilous Future of Knowledge. Is it a book about Wikipedia? I prefer to say that Wikipedia is a central character (or even setting) in a story I want to tell about the history of factual knowledge going back to The Enlightenment; how we produce, distribute, and protect factual knowledge now; and the multiple crises and opportunities factual knowledge faces as we march towards the future. The first part will be about the French Encyclopédie of the period leading up to their Revolution; the second will look closely at Wikipedia, with a special emphasis on the Global Warming article (and now, likely, COVID-19 related articles); and the final part will look at Wikidata and efforts like MIT’s Knowledge Futures Group, contrasting them with corporate initiatives like Google’s Knowledge Graph and others.\n\nWhile I’m very likely to request interviews with some of the publicly known figures of the movement, I think the book will be most successful when it gives readers a really solid snapshot of the community, so I want to privilege the stories of more “everyday” contributors as much as possible.\n\nIf you have experience/expertise with any of the broad areas outlined above and want to be in touch early, I’ll be keeping an eye on this Village Pump thread, and you can also reach out to me on the user page I set up for this project. I will do my very best to be responsive; please just know that I’m doing this on top of paid work, and each stage of the project will require a different particular focus.\n\nI am in the proposal writing stage, which means two things. 1) I’m at the “framing the narrative arc” level of research, rather drilling into details (more on those details below). 2) For my first sample chapter for the proposal, I am drilling into the details on the effort to put a copy of English Wikipedia on the Moon. I believe that story will capture the imagination of a broad audience and allow me to touch on all or most of the major themes I’m developing. I may use it as a prologue.\n\nFYI, my intention for now is to go the traditional agent-publishing house route.\n\nOver time, I will be reaching out to editor groups via talk pages on the Global Warming, Encyclopédie, and COVID-19 (once they are less slammed) articles, and I suspect I’ll come back to Village Pump with more specific requests for comment over time.\n\nIf all goes very, very well (fingers crossed), it’s possible this book could come out as Wikipedia turns twenty next year. While I will do my best to represent criticism and concerns (which is made easier by how transparent and frank Wikipedians are about the project’s challenges), I expect to show Wikipedia in a very strong light, providing context that places Wikipedia at the heart our global civilization’s attempt to preserve the best of the Enlightenment project in the face of uncertain futures. Wikipedia is already in the spotlight now because of coronavirus (here’s Wired’s article, and more recently Haaretz’s, if you haven’t seen them), and it would be really meaningful to me personally to be part of the storytelling wave I expect next year.\n\nA little about me: I've been working in the do gooder tech space most of my career, including national-international tech policy work and with groups like IEEE, Black Girls CODE, Mozilla, and also recently The Wikimedia Foundation (a very brief writing contract). I wrote my master's thesis on the social networks of Wikipedia talk pages back in 2006, so I've been tracking the project for a while. I also find the Wikimedia universe so vast that it forces me into beginner's mind whenever I dive into it. I hope that balance of knowledge and humility makes me an interesting guide for audiences that use Wikipedia but don’t think about its inner workings much. I live in Seattle, though for now I’m spending most of my days social distancing in a cabin well outside Bellingham, Washington, USA.\n\nThanks for reading this far, and I look forward to learning and connecting with you over the course of this project.\n\nCheers,\n\nNJ — Preceding unsigned comment added by HowtoBuildaFact (talk • contribs)\n\nHello.

Considering that some of us are working at home for the first time and had recently being provided with the means to contact and coordinate coworkers were once one usually spoke directly to them, had meetings, telephoned and emailed then I was reading out of curiosity Slack and specially collaborative software. The later, besides being too broad in its definition, makes its confusing in services and software like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Workplace by Facebook, Flock, Mattermost, Chanty, Zulip, Fleep, HipChat, and the now deleted Rocket.Chat to be considered as or categorized collaborative given this ambiguous broad definition. A good example of this is the even more confusing List of collaborative software in the examples of software that it provides.\n\nI think there is difference between Slack et al that are more like Collaborative working environment with social interaction tools and that can aggregate application tools, with other softwares and services like the electronic mailing list, wiki, bulletin board, Internet forum, instant messaging, Lotus Notes, Wrike and various others that are more stand alone collaborating project management and document editing tools. I also considered Discord, that is more like Twitch in its purpose, in a different league.\n\nJust some thoughts, regards, --JorgeGG (talk)\n\nHi @JorgeGG: - your discussion might be worth having, but you probably won't have much luck here: it's relatively rarely viewed, but more critically, you really want to discuss it with those with the most interest in the field.

(see Phabricator for technical details, thanks Kaldari) Flickr is a great resource with freely licensed material and importing media from there is now easier than ever!\n\nHere are a few pointers to help you add useful images to articles:\n\nGo to Flickr.com and search for your subject. The images you now see you probably can't import. Go to the drop-down menu that says \"any license\" and pick \"Commercial use & mods allowed\". The page will reload and you'll see, in this example, free images of marathons. These images you can import.\n\nIf you scroll down a bit on the image page, you'll often see \"This photo is in x album(s)\". If you copy-paste the album link into the Upload Wizard, you can upload up to 4 images from that album at once.\n\nBe aware of the various Commons policies. In particular:\n\nFreedom of panorama: not every country, in particular the US, has it. A photograph of a non-antique statue in the US is typically not allowed. (upload it locally as fair use instead if applicable)\n\nDerivative works: a photo of a magazine cover, packaging that includes a photo of the product or other non-utilitarian design or a photo of a big screen at a live concert includes the work of another and is thus a derivative work. Unless that other work is also freely licensed or out of copyright, don't upload it.\n\nThat's probably the most important stuff to remember. You may want to browse Category:Wikipedia requested images by subject for a bit. - Alexis Jazz\n\nI wonder why do we have a \"Page Title\" option in visual editor when it is not used in any article. It rather ruins the layout of an article, especially the table of content. Why don't we delete this option from wikipedia? Lightbluerain (talk)\n\nThe item labeled \"Page Title\" creates a =Level 1 section heading=. The feature exists in the visual editor because it exists in wikitext, and the visual editor is supposed to be able to do nearly any edit that can be done in wikitext. This is not commonly used in articles, but you will find it on some other pages. c:Commons:Village pump might be the most famous use of it; all sections are organized by date, and each date is marked as a level 1 section heading, e.g., =May 9=.

I did not think there would be a need for a request as I didn't think the move would be controversial. Per WP:MOVE I thought it was more fit for the draftspace. FlalfTalk\n\nPlease provide a link to your discussion about what to do with the article. What part of WP:MOVE do you think covers this type of move? -- PBS (talk)\n\nPBS, WP:MOVE is not a policy nor guideline; it's a how-to guide per the template at the top of the page. I'm not sure why Flalf cited that as a reason to move a page; perhaps they meant another page that does describe page move policy.\n\nCurrent consensus allows editors to move articles to draftspace if they feel it's not ready to be allowed to remain in mainspace. The reasoning behind this is that the alternative is frequently deletion, which is even more confronting. I dream of horses (talk page) (Contribs) Remember to notify me after replying off my talk page.\n\n@User:I dream of horses It is not good practice to link from article space into other spaces (such as user space or draft space). I mentioned WP:MOVE only because User:flalf stated \"Per WP:MOVE I thought it was more fit for the draftspace\". I think that WP:EDIT is a relevant policy. -- PBS (talk)\n\nPBS, if moving articles into draftspace helps us comply with the spirit of don't bite the newcomers and other civility policies by avoiding a deletion discussion, but the letter of WP:EDIT prevents us from doing so, then \"ignore all rules\" would apply.\n\nBut, then again, \"This article is imperfect!\" isn't what motivates me to move an article into draftspace. It's \"This article has at least a minute amount of potential (that is, speedy deletion isn't advisable), but it absolutely shouldn't remain in mainspace\". The alternative is often an AfD discussion. An imperfect, \"mainspacable\" article might get some cleanup, or otherwise get cleanup templates, and possibly a stub tag. A \"perfect\" article, for lack of a better term, gets a nomination at autopatrolled. I personally don't expect a new article to be perfect; therefore, I believe my new page patrolling is WP:EDIT complaint. I dream of horses (talk page) (Contribs) Remember to notify me after replying off my talk page.\n\nWP:Drafts#During new page review and WP:Drafts#Requirements for page movers make interesting reading. I haven't looked at the page in question here, but my experience has been that new page patrollers, who are often less acquainted with Wikipedia norms than the people who have written the articles that they are passing judgement on, frequently move pages to draft space and refuse to move them back in defiance of those sections. The claim made at WP:Drafts#Moving articles to draft space that moving to draft space is not a backdoor route to deletion is clearly false, given that drafts get deleted after 6 months without proper checking if they are about notable topics. Phil Bridger (talk)\n\nIf an article is moved to draft without a RM and someone objects to the move, then AFAICT they can are free to move it back under the WP:RMUM process (a process designed to prevent move wars and first move advantage). -- PBS (talk)\n\nThe move was improper since draftifying is really only for brand new articles with severe problems. I do have some concerns about the lack of oversight when it comes to draftifications, I would encourage admins to take a look at the articles in question before deleting the leftover redirects. I have on several occasions (usually by chance) come across draftifications of ten year old articles, where a relatively new editor has just assumed that imperfect articles need to be moved to drafts. – Thjarkur (talk)\n\nI apologize if it was improper. At the time I didn't think the article belonged in mainspace. If that was a mistake, then I'm sorry. I made an error in judgement and I won't do it again. I'm so sorry. FlalfTalk\n\nInviting DGG into this conversation, as he and I both occasionally move mainspace pages to draftspace for repair. BD2412 T\n\nHowdy hello folks! Flalf is one of my adoptees, and asked if I could take a look here, they were understandably stressed about being the subject of a VP discussion. If I'm reading things right, this is more of a general policy discussion, and less of a contributor discussion, correct? Flalf's actions seem merely to have been the catalyst of a policy question, which is why I assume its at the pump. Otherwise, I would expect that this would have been discussed with Flalf on their talk, or at ANI, am I right? CaptainEek Edits Ho Cap'n!⚓\n\nYes, the broad question is, \"when is it appropriate to move an article to draft space?\" BD2412 T\n\nIndeed, sorry to see this disussion presented this way, Flalf, and I hope I didn't sound like I was scolding you.\n\nI once ran a Quarry query to find draftifications of old articles, there was an improper one about every other day. All were meant in good faith, but could have lead to unintentional loss of content since nobody noticed them. (This is the Quarry query, for some reason it's timing out for me now, maybe someone can see what I'm doing wrong). Maybe we should consider an editfilter warning for when old articles are being moved into other namespaces, that would also catch all these student editors moving established articles into their userspace to work on them. – Thjarkur (talk)\n\nHere you go. —Cryptic\n\n@User:flalf and User:CaptainEek as User:BD2412 and User:Þjarkur imply I started the conversation here is to review this area in general and more specifically to review my actions rather than flalf's. I am a very experianced editor, but this is the first time I have reverted such a move. If found during this conversation that I was in breach of some guidence somewhere, then I would revert my revert, and then ask if that guidence was sensible. As an administrator I could have removed the link left behind in article space and I would have done so if I could have found guidance on that (it may exist for all I know) and then started this conversation.\n\nflalf my reason for asking you how you came to your decision is not to criticise you, but to try to understand how you came to the decision to move this article into draft space.\n\nI would also like so someone with more familiarity with this area to explain what is usually done with the redirects left behind after such a move and if is it documented.\n\n-- PBS (talk)\n\nAnother area that needs thinking about which is thrown up by this particular article (Baron Cobham), is that moving an article with an edit history to drafts name space may inadvertently create a copy violation as happens with cut and past moves. This article was moved to drafts on 26 April 2019 and deleted on 27 October 2019 (six months and a day later) with the comment \"Abandoned draft or Articles for Creation submission – to retrieve it, see WP:REFUND/G13\" it had an edit history of 151 edits. Meanwhile on 27 July 2019‎ the article was recreated in article space with the comment \"It's restoration of the page data\" diffing the restored version against the now deleted history in drafts shows it is a copy (with minor changes) of the last non soc version on 25 April 2019 by user:Favonian with an edit comment of \"rv sock of User:G.-M. Cupertino\". -- PBS (talk)\n\nRe the idea that things \"incubate in draft space\". It was a great theory that things would improve in a less deletionist environment, but the place where we actually get collaborative editing is in mainspace. OK I fix a few typos in draftspace, but I'm an exception, for the most part it is a place where reviewers say what would be needed to get an article to the standard that they work to, and some newbies persist in trying to attain that standard - often a far higher standard than NPP or even AFD. If you move existing articles to draftspace it takes them out of the category system that some editors work through, out of people's mainspace searches and hides them from readers. Worse it puts them on a conveyor belt to deletion, even if they would have survived AFD. I'm OK with really spammy stuff being moved from mainspace to draft, but I don't see the case for it otherwise except as an AFD outcome. ϢereSpielChequers\n\nIt is 100% inappropriate to move an article that has existed in mainspace for nearly a year to the draft space except as an outcome of AFD. Any article outside the NPP queue even, I think it is entirely inappropriate and the correct approach would be one of the existing deletion mechanisms. (I might be even more to the point that anything which has managed to survive in article space for greater than 30 days probably also should use an appropriate deletion mechanism for removal.) --Izno (talk)\n\nWe don't have good documentation in this area, so what happens seems to depend upon personal preferences/philosophy: Alice says that this is a notable subject that will m:eventually turn into a decent article, and moves it into mainspace, and Bob says the page looks \"embarrassing\" and moves it back to Draft: space to hide it from readers. If it weren't for our usual rules against edit warring, they could keep doing this all day long, and each would believe that they're \"right\" and that \"the community\" does it their way and \"the rules\" say that the page should be in the place of their choice.\n\nFor people who are doing this, I think that a long look at the very short WP:AFCPURPOSE might be useful. That's what it takes (or what it's supposed to take) to get an article out of draftspace via the AFC process. So if you look that over, and you decide that the page in question meets AFC's standard for moving a page out of draftspace, then you shouldn't move the page into draftspace in the first place. Similarly, if you find something in the mainspace that doesn't meet AFC's one-important-question standard, then you get to decide whether to have its failings settled in draftspace (where it will probably get neglected and deleted in a few months) or at WP:AFD (where it will probably get neglected and deleted next week).\n\nMore generally, I think we need to have a few large-scale discussions about what should be done, and whether we're willing to make both Alice and Bob follow the standards that we settle on, including, if truly necessary, topic bans. I have been thinking about two areas for discussion:\n\nWikipedia's goal is to make knowledge available. Moving pages out of the mainspace hides that knowledge. Is it more important to provide knowledge – including knowledge on incomplete, \"embarrassing\" pages – or more important to protect our reputation? This is a \"spectrum\" question: you might say that you were 60% this and 40% that.\n\nShould drafts on possibly non-notable subjects be handled at WP:AFD (which is where the notability experts are), or should they continue to be held at WP:MFD (which is mostly intended for Wikipedia's internal pages), or should they be moved to their own page (\"WP:DFD\")? Choosing the venue does not increase or decrease the amount of work involved, but it does partially determine who's involved in the discussion. Similarly, should there be a limit to the number of times AFC and NPP can reject a page before they have to hand it over to the larger community for a notability-related discussion? The general theme here is \"Are drafts (sort of) articles, whose existence depends upon notability rather than quality, or are they something else?\" WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nSo that there is no question about the copy right of the article, I have restored the previous history which was lost when the article was first moved to draft space and then six months later deleted while simultaneously existing as a cut and past move into article space. -- PBS (talk)\n\nI don't really know where this should go so let me just drop it here anyway I'm not Wiki-Wizard like most of the registered users here I know how to edit but that's it so could someone create new article for me if I provide all the little informations there is about 1 musical artist who's not so well known thanks — Preceding unsigned comment added by Wiki-Tieto (talk • contribs)\n\nWiki-Tieto, English Wikipedia has notability criteria for musicians. \"not so well known\" can mean different things, but I would guess that this musical artist won't meet the criteria. —⁠andrybak (talk)\n\nWiki-Tieto, if you go to the box in the top right-hand corner of Wikipedia page (the one that says \"Search Wikipedia\") and type in the name of an article you want to create, you will find that you will get the name of an article in red letters, which means that Wikipedia does not currently have an article on that subject. Click on the red letters, and you will be able to start an article. Vorbee (talk)\n\nPlease note that Wajid Khan died on 1 june according to Google news. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.185.175.84 (talk)\n\nThank you. I see that our article Sajid–Wajid has been updated. Phil Bridger (talk)\n\nHi! Climate change will kill us and our planet, that much is certain. Unless we do something about it, but it only happens half-heartedly. In order to make people more environmentally conscious, I propose one working day a year on which we all stay at home, on which we do not consume, do not travel, do not drive, do not go to work, nothing except emergency services and so on.\n\nIn my opinion, Wednesday would be the most suitable day for this. For example, it could be called »clean day«, »clean wednesday« or »climate day« etc.\n\nOn this day, the environment is advertised in the media, suggestions are made about what we humans can do about the climate crisis. This day, which should be an official, worldwide public holiday, not an unofficial strike. However, it would make sense to always organize this day off on a Wednesday in order not to initiate a weekend extension. Perhaps it would be possible to launch this as an official Wikipedia initiative. What do you think?Enbua8 (talk)\n\n@Enbua8: That's not really what this site"
