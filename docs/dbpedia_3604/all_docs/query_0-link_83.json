First and foremost are the staff of the Research Department and Library at the Baha’i World Centre in Haifa. Hoda Mahmoudi, Janet Khan, Vahid Rafati, Siyamak Zabihi-Moqaddam, Parvine Foroughi and many others were extremely helpful in various ways, and without their assistance it would have been extremely difficult to complete this work. Special thanks should go to Gad Gilbar, my colleague at the Department of Middle Eastern History and at the Ezri Center for Iran and Persian Gulf Studies (both at the University of Haifa). It is to him and his encouragement, as well as the support of Hoda Mahmoudi and Janet Khan, that I owe the existence of this book. It is my great pleasure to also thank Meir Ezri whose unequivocal support and interest in Iranian studies in general and my own research in particular have encouraged me in this and in many other Iran-related research projects. To Janet Afary, Dominic Parviz Brookshaw, Farhad Kazemi, and to my colleagues at the University of Haifa, Butrus Abu Manneh and Gad Gilbar, I owe my deepest gratitude for their patient and thorough reading of this manuscript and for making valuable comments. My gratitude is also given to Boris Morozov, from the Ezri Center, for the translation of the Russian documents; to my editors; and to Carolann Martin from Edinburgh, UK, for the typesetting. A number of other people have also helped, whether directly or indirectly, by providing information, advice or insight. These include Firuz Kazemzadeh, Amin Banani and Sattareh Farman Farmaian, from California; Roger Dahl, from the USNBA in Wilmette, Illinois; Shapour Rassekh, from Geneva; and H. Ashraf, from Vancouver, Canada. Many people at the University of Haifa were extremely helpful as well. These include people such as the staff of the University Library, who being always ready left no stone unturned to get relevant material for me; the members of the Research Committee of the Faculty of Humanities and those of the Research Authority, for their financial help and support; and my colleagues at the Department of Middle Eastern History for their general support and encouragement.\n\nxiv\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nA generous research grant from the Ezri Center for Iran and Persian Gulf Studies was useful in bringing this research to successful completion. My sincere thanks go to the members of the Academic Committee of that centre. If there is any apology to be made, then surely it has to go to my own family: my dear wife Shirin and my three little and beloved children – Romie, Yasmin and Yehonatan. I apologize for the long hours that I had to be absent from home, and thank them for their understanding, love and moral support, which eased my path in this endeavour. Responsibility for any mistakes is, of course, entirely mine.\n\nPREFACE\n\nxv\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis book is about the Baha’i schools in Iran. The term ‘Baha’i schools’ means ‘schools owned, established and run by Baha’is’. Unlike the schools of other religious minorities in Iran, the Baha’i schools did not include in their curriculum any religious studies; religion was taught separately to Baha’i students on Fridays, either in the schools (when they were in recess), or in other buildings and institutions elsewhere in the Baha’i community. In terms of time, the book focuses on the late Qajar and early Pahlavi period (1899– 1934). In this study I have endeavoured to answer three fundamental questions: first, why did Muzaffar al-Din Shah – who was known to be a devoted Shi‘i, and whose father, especially after an assassination attempt in 1852, had persecuted Babis and Baha’is since the mid-nineteenth century – permit the opening, in 1899, of the first Baha’i school in Tehran, followed later by many other schools throughout Iran? What made him and his government potentially place their own rule in severe danger by risking their relations with the conservative Shi‘i ‘ulama’ (religious scholars and teachers) and the masses who followed them, who regarded the Babis-Baha’is as apostates (and therefore persecuted them)? Secondly, what possible reasons did the nationalist, pro-modern, pro-secular and anticlerical Riza Shah Pahlavi, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, have for closing those schools in 1934? And third, what role did the Baha’i schools play in the advent of modern education in Iran? This study attempts to answer these and other related questions mainly through examining the personalities of Muzaffar al-Din Shah Qajar and Riza Shah Pahlavi; their policies; the existing socio-economic, political, religious and intellectual forces and pressures; the domestic, regional and international circumstances of the period under study; and to do so through the prism of the Baha’i faith, the importance which it attaches to education, and the characteristics of the Baha’i schools, which not only educated Baha’is, but also many non-Baha’is. These schools helped to promote modern education in Iran, but also were important for the global spread of the Baha’i faith. It is argued here that although many factors could have been at work, the decision to permit the opening of Baha’i schools in Iran was above all due to the need to meet the growing demand for modern education, a demand which the Qajar state (and probably also the first Pahlavi state, at least during its earlier years) found difficult and even impossible to meet. The higher standard of education in the Baha’i schools, which opened\n\nxvi\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nfirst in Tehran and later in other cities, towns and villages where there were relatively large Baha’i communities, soon drew people from non-Baha’i families to send their children to these schools. In general, most of these non-Baha’i families were Shi‘i; but in certain towns and cities – such as Hamadan, Kashan and Yazd – most non-Baha’i students seem to have come from non-Shi‘i families, with Jewish students coming mainly from the former two cities, and Zoroastrian students mainly from the latter. Thus, the desire for modern education surpassed the prevalent hatred towards the Baha’is among large sections of the population. The Baha’i schools flourished throughout Iran. Their reputation for excellence brought many influential and important Iranian families, including the Pahlavi family, to send some of their children to study at the Baha’i schools. In addition, varying numbers of non-Baha’i families from the middle and lower classes and areas in which these schools operated sent their children to the Baha’i schools, mainly because compared with the other local schools – whether run by clerics, the state, or other religious minorities and even foreigners – they generally provided a better education. Yet, in December 1934, Riza Shah Pahlavi decided to close all Baha’i schools. Here it is argued that although a number of factors could have been involved, the main reason for this was probably that Riza Shah regarded the Iranian Baha’is as a group of disloyal citizens, whose loyalty was given not to the nation-state, but rather to a supranational organization and leadership. Through the study of the Baha’i schools – the year founded, the identity of the founder/s, the staff employed therein, the type of school (boys/girls, elementary/ intermediate/high), the location and size, the total number of students and the number of non-Baha’i students, as well as the curriculum, teaching accessories, learning facilities, examinations and other details – the book aims to provide a database: first, to understand what led these schools to be known, if not as the best, then at least as among the best schools in Iran at the time of their operation; second, to analyse the role of these schools in the advent of modern education in Iran; and third, to provide data for future studies. SOURCES AND METHODOLOGY A wide range of sources has been consulted in the writing of this book. Generally, these sources can be categorized as primary and secondary, and characterized as Baha’i and nonBaha’i sources. Most of the Baha’i sources were found in the archives and library of the Baha’i World Centre (BWC) in Haifa, and some others were located at the US National Baha’i Archives (USNBA) in Wilmette, Illinois. Along with other Baha’i primary sources (such as private papers, memoirs, newspapers, chronicles, books, etc.), they provide not only a unique window into the fascinating history of the Baha’is of Iran and adjacent areas, but also a fresh look at a variety of issues in the modern history of Iran. Thus, while the Baha’i primary sources offer a mass of fascinating and novel information and data concerning the Baha’i schools, their staff, students, curriculum, and so on, at the same time they throw new light on a variety of topics, including (among others) the attitudes of the state, the Shi‘i clergy and the majority Shi‘i populations towards questions of modernization, education and religious minorities; the relations between the state and the Shi‘i clergy, and between both of these and the Baha’i community; the competition between the various minority and private schools in Iran over modern education; and the\n\nPREFACE\n\nxvii\n\nextent of Baha’i influence (both by individuals and by ideas) within Iranian society and its contribution to the process of the modernization of Iran (particularly modern thought and education). The continued lack of official recognition and the antagonism shown by the Iranian state and the Shi‘i clerics and people towards the Babis and Baha’is since the inception of the Babi-Baha’i1 faith in the mid-1840s, have produced an abnormal situation as far as the non-Baha’i historiography of the Baha’i faith and community in Iran is concerned. The Iranian state has either totally disregarded this community in the official documentation, or has prevented access to documents in which reference is made to them. Furthermore, the continued uncompromising and intolerant attitude of successive Iranian governments towards the Babis and Baha’is since the middle of the nineteenth century seems to have discouraged not only scholars in Iran, but also the great majority of those outside it, from undertaking research on the Iranian Baha’is, not to mention any positive role Baha’is might have played in the modern history of Iran, or any aspect of it, such as modern education. As a result, Baha’i sources and scholars are the main sources for the study of Baha’i history in Iran. However, for foreign concerns, especially the British and Russian governments, the Babi-Baha’i faith and community in Iran (and the adjacent areas) was an interesting phenomenon about which they knew very little and therefore aspired to know more. Being fully aware of the sensitivities of the Iranian state, and of the Shi‘i clergy and people towards the Babis-Baha’is on the one hand, and the growing spread and influence of Babis and Baha’is in all levels of Iranian society on the other, they ordered their representatives in Iran and the adjacent areas to carefully (and cautiously) collect information about this community and faith. Thus, some important Baha’i-related documents were found in the National Archives of the United Kingdom, and in a number of archives in Russia (the Arkhiv Rossiiskoi Akademii Nauk and Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Istoricheskii Arkhiv in St Petersburg, and the Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Voenno-Istoricheskii Arkhiv and Rossisskii Gosudarstvennyi Arkhiv Sovremennoi Politicheskoi Istorii in Moscow). A major difference between the Baha’i and non-Baha’i primary sources is that while the former category of sources makes a clear distinction between Babis and Baha’is, the non-Baha’i primary sources usually fail to do so. Despite the fact that by the late 1860s the vast majority of the Babis accepted the Baha’i faith (and thus became Baha’is), these sources continued to refer to both groups as ‘Babis’ well into the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.2 Given this fact, this study regards any mention of ‘Babi’ in the non-Baha’i primary sources during the period under study to mean ‘Baha’i’, unless it is clearly understood from the context that the reference was to ‘Babi’ (or ‘Azali’), in which case the latter term is used. As far as the general literature on modern education in Iran is concerned, up to the present the overwhelming majority of academically authored books and articles have failed even to acknowledge the fact that there were any Baha’i schools in Iran, let alone to study them. It is this fact that brought me to label the Baha’i schools in Iran as ‘the Forgotten Schools’, for their existence has been invisible not only in Iranian official publications, but also in almost all the studies written by non-Baha’is, leaving only a limited number of short studies and memoirs written by Baha’is to record their existence. A survey of the book literature on modern education in Iran during the nineteenth and\n\nxviii\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\ntwentieth centuries basically reveals only four studies – three in English and one in Persian. As far as the three in English are concerned, one was written by Reza Arasteh (1969),3 and the other two were by David Menashri (1992)4 and Monica Ringer (2001).5 However, in none of these studies – which cover either the entire period (Arasteh and Menashri) or the earlier part of the period (Ringer) under study in this book – is there any reference whatsoever to Baha’i schools. The first of the three, by Arasteh, is a general study of education in Iran and spans just over a century (1850–1960). In this work Arasteh follows the main developments in the different categories of education (primary, secondary, higher, vocational, physical, etc.) in Iran, and also provides a short survey of the missionary educational activity therein; but there is no mention of Baha’i schools. The same is true of Ringer’s study. Although it makes a very brief mention of Madrasih-yi Tarbiyat (the Tarbiyat School)6 – the leading Baha’i school in Tehran, and one of the best modern schools in the capital and in all of Iran at the time – it provides no data about this school, nor does it identify it as Baha’i. The main focus of Menashri’s book is on the higher education level in Iran, a level at which no Baha’i institutions existed since it was at the pre-school, elementary, intermediate and, to a much lesser extent, secondary levels of education that the Baha’is established schools. However, no mention of Baha’i schools is made in his coverage of pre-academic schooling during the later Qajar and early Pahlavi periods.7 As for the book written in Persian by Huma Natiq,8 its main concern is modern foreign schools, particularly the French ones, and it too fails to mention the existence of any Baha’i schools in its discussion of minority schools in Iran. A wider search on modern education in Iran reveals a few more studies, and on more specific subjects. These include either a short survey of education in Iran,9 or detailed studies either on specific schools,10 specific programmes,11 or specific aspects of modern education,12 or on its social and cultural effects,13 but none of them concerns or even touches upon the Baha’i schools. This is also the case with the very detailed entry on ‘education’ in Encyclopedia Iranica, with contributions from a long list of scholars.14 Surprisingly, a collection of documents on girls’ schools in Iran from the Constitutional to the Pahlavi period, edited by Suhayla Turabi Farsani,15 does mention the names of a few Baha’i schools,16 and even provides some very basic and inadequate data, but still fails to identify them as Baha’i schools. However, given that Turabi Farsani’s study was published in Iran in 1999 by the Records Research Centre of the Iran National Archives Organization (Pazhuhishkadih-yi Asnad-i Saziman-i Asnad-i Milli-yi Iran), and given the open and public anti-Baha’i policies of the clerical regime in Iran, this failure is ‘understandable’. In other words, in the circumstances that have prevailed in Iran since the establishment of an Islamic Republic in 1979, it is most unlikely that either the editor or the publisher of this book would have mentioned the names of those Baha’i schools, even if they had been aware of any historic indication that this is what they actually were. The same explanation would also apply to the book written by Huma Natiq, or any book or article published in Iran. Given the almost total absence of studies on the subject and the failure of the few existing studies to mention the existence of Baha’i schools in Iran, it seems that one could have become aware of their existence only by knowing about the religious affiliation of the people involved, and/or through consulting Baha’i material. However, even an indication or a mention of those Baha’i schools in Iranian official documents, like those collected by Turabi Farsani, is ample proof that Baha’i schools did\n\nPREFACE\n\nxix\n\nexist in Iran, and that they were officially recognized by the state, although not as Baha’i schools. This failure to acknowledge the schools is probably an attempt by successive Iranian governments from the mid-nineteenth century onwards to downplay and even erase the role played by the Baha’i community, whether in education or any other field. In Iran, as in other Islamic countries, Baha’is have faced many hardships that are a direct result of their religious beliefs. From an Islamic point of view the Baha’is could not be recognized as ‘People of the Book’ simply because it would mean that the Prophet Muhammad could not be the ‘Seal of the Prophets’ (Khatim al-Anbiya’).17 As a result, no Islamic country or leader, no matter how strong or liberal, has dared to recognize them officially; and this is particularly true in Shi‘i Iran, where anti-Baha’i feelings were often expressed in the form of harsh persecutions and massacres, led by both the state and the ‘ulama’. Thus, as far as Iranian official studies on the Baha’i faith and community are concerned, this intentional oversight can be understood, especially in light of the political atmosphere in Iran since 1979. But one then needs to explain this oversight in the academic and non-official literature on modern education in Iran. After all, how can any study on modern education in Iran, which, among other things, concerns the modern schools established by the religious minorities in Iran, fail to mention those of the biggest religious minority in Iran, namely the Baha’is? Were the authors, in their discussion of the educational systems run by the other religious minorities, not concerned with the question of where Baha’i children studied? In order to answer these questions one needs to speculate, and a few possible explanations come to mind. The first possible explanation, to which brief reference has already been made, may be related to the openly declared anti-Baha’i policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the autocratic and undemocratic nature of the regime. Scholars living in Iran could endanger their livelihoods (or even their lives) were they to publish anything positive (or that could be interpreted as positive) about the Baha’is. As far as the Pahlavi period is concerned, it seems that despite the improved circumstances for the Iranian Baha’is compared with the pre- and post-Pahlavi periods, as well as the secular, nationalist and modernist policies of the Pahlavis and their antagonism towards the clerical establishment, the Pahlavis were still unable to act to give official recognition to the Baha’i faith as a legitimate religion. Such an act would have had disastrous repercussions for them, for it would have conveyed implicit acknowledgement of the legitimacy of Baha’u’llah’s prophetic claim. It would thereby have challenged the accepted position of the Prophet Muhammad as the ‘Seal of the Prophets’, and consequently, in the eyes of the Shi‘i clerics and believers, would have undermined the legitimate right of the Pahlavis to rule over them as Shi‘i kings. Thus, it seems that the Pahlavis preferred unofficially to allow the Baha’is to live their lives in relative freedom, although officially they adopted a policy of ignoring them and the role they played in different areas.18 If the Pahlavis had such a policy of ignoring the Baha’is, the clerical regime that ended monarchical rule in Iran went even further, attempting to diminish their presence, particularly because of the regime’s vigorous anti-Baha’i agenda and renewed persecution. If writing objectively about Baha’is was considered uncomfortable under the Pahlavis, under the Islamic Republic of Iran the cost could be extremely high. Naturally, this fact has discouraged non-Baha’i scholars living in Iran, or with family and relatives there, from undertaking objective research on the Baha’is.\n\nxx\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nAs for scholars who live outside Iran, the cost for them could mean either being prevented from accessing research material in Iran, or even being totally barred from entry into Iran or from cooperation with academic institutions there. With such heavy consequences at stake, it seems that the majority of non-Baha’i scholars tend to diminish, minimize or totally disregard the Baha’i element in any relevant study, and if they do mention it, they usually tend to limit themselves to brief repetitions of already-known facts concerning the emergence of the Babi movement, and the persecution of Babis and Baha’is in Iran.19 Firuz Kazemzadeh, the renowned Baha’i scholar of Iran and Russia, has recently expounded on this issue. He claims that in serving the shah and the Shi‘i clerical establishment, nineteenth-century official Iranian historians laid the foundations of many misrepresentations concerning the Babis and Baha’is that were to be endlessly repeated by others, including Western scholars such as Edward G. Browne, whose studies on the Babis-Baha’is have been used by many scholars after him writing on the subject.20 Secondly, since Iranian official documents do not specify the religious affiliation of the Baha’i schools, there would be no reason to assume that they were Baha’i. It seems that only by asking ‘what about the schools of the Baha’is in Iran?’ and then consulting Baha’i sources – exactly as has been done in this study – is there a chance of arriving at a sound conclusion about the communal affiliations of those schools, and of gathering information about them. Because of systematic official disregard most of the Baha’i schools that operated in Iran between 1899 and 1934 were not mentioned at all, while the very few that were mentioned were left without their religious affiliation.21 Thus, this intentional official disregard creates a large gap in the research material, which can to a large extent be covered by using Baha’i sources, and to a lesser extent by using other sources. Even so, in many places no source material was found to answer certain questions, thus leaving no alternative other than to speculate or provide circumstantial evidence. Indeed, one of the major contributions of this study lies not only in bringing to light the existence of Baha’i schools in Iran and providing information, data and analysis concerning them, but also in raising legitimate questions. I believe that in time, as more source material (either Baha’i or other) is located, such questions, or at least some of them, will be answered without doubt or speculation. Third, there is to a large extent a lack of awareness as to the possible contribution of Baha’i sources to the study of modern Iran. Apart from a few Baha’i scholars of Iran who make use of that material, it seems that it has become an accepted practice for most nonBaha’i scholars not to use Baha’i sources,22 in spite of the fact that they are written mostly in Persian and contain information not only on the Baha’i faith and community in Iran, but also on various aspects of Iran’s modern history.23 However, one has to admit that Baha’i primary sources, especially those in the BWC archives and library in Haifa, are not easily accessible to all, although a special effort is being made by the BWC and by Baha’i scholars worldwide to make more Baha’i sources, both primary and secondary, available online.24 The question of the possible contribution of Baha’i sources to the study of modern Iran also raises another question, this time concerning the Baha’i community in Iran in general: how can the history of a country like Iran, or the history of any particular aspect of it – be it education, economy, culture, etc. – be told, studied and analysed without the slightest mention of the Baha’is, some of whom played important roles in those fields?25 After all, Babis and Baha’is, unlike Jews and Christians, could be found (at least up to\n\nPREFACE\n\nxxi\n\nthe establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran) in positions of authority in such areas as public administration and bureaucracy, education, media, commerce, etc. 26 Furthermore, and in spite of their most advanced reformist thought, none of the early leaders of the Baha’i faith have been mentioned as intellectuals anywhere in studies on the intellectual history of modern Iran. It is a fact that in mid-nineteenth century Iran and the Middle East they were already expressing such advanced ideas as globalization, collective security, etc. – ideas that only began to be discussed and implemented much later, in the twentieth century. As far as the literature written by Baha’is on the Baha’i schools is concerned, up to the late 1980s it was limited mainly to the memoirs of Baha’is who had either studied or taught at these schools.27 However, more recent academic studies on the subject written by Baha’i scholars28 have attempted to dig deeper in order to collect more material on the schools – who founded them, when and where they were founded, what was included in their curricula, who taught and who studied in them, and so on. Even so, no systematic and comprehensive attempt has yet been made to place them in the general Iranian (rather than mainly Baha’i) historical context; to analyse the role played by the Baha’i schools in the process of reform in Iran in general, and modern education in particular; or to study the range of the likely reasons for allowing such schools to open at all (in the late nineteenth/ early twentieth centuries) and then to close (in December 1934). The aim of this book is to try to bridge this gap and ameliorate this unsatisfactory situation in the study of modern education in Iran, in order to contribute to the better understanding of the role played by the Baha’i community in Iran towards its modernization and progress. The scarcity of non-Baha’i sources on the Baha’is of Iran was the first major obstacle in writing a history of the Baha’i schools in Iran. In this category of sources, only bits and pieces were found concerning the Baha’is, with much of the scant information being essentially repetitive. This necessitated speculation, raising possibilities and suggesting probable explanations when attempting to analyse and look into the causes of Baha’irelated issues when non-Baha’is were concerned. This lack of non-Baha’i sources meant that a considerable part of the source material had to be located, gathered and/or generated from a new category of sources, namely Baha’i sources that were quite new to me, as I believe they are to many other scholars on modern Iran. Finding and locating such sources was the second major obstacle, and success in overcoming it served only to create the third problem, namely becoming familiar with an entirely new set of terms and vocabulary. Another obstacle was to find a proper narrative structure into which all the scattered information, once gathered, could be placed, while the compilation of data for the various tables was extremely timeconsuming. None of these and other obstacles could have been overcome without the generous assistance of the staff of the BWC in Haifa. STRUCTURE AND SUMMARY OF CONTENTS This book is intended to concentrate on what has been overlooked in the existing research on modern education and schools in Iran. Thus, except for a survey of education in Iran in general, and of modern schools therein in particular, the main focus of this study is the background to, and causes for, the establishment of modern Baha’i schools in Iran as\n\nxxii\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nwell as their closure. Thus, for example, no general theories of education have been discussed in this study because this has already been widely discussed elsewhere.29 Likewise, I consciously refrained from entering into theories of modernization, westernization, etc., nor did I choose to discuss the ‘modernization dilemma’ in Iran, namely how to use Western institutions as models for Iranian modernization while guarding against loss of culture, authenticity and identity.30 In the Introduction I have attempted to provide a concise historical background of Iran during the Qajar period, characterizing the whole period as one of change and transformation. Two separate movements were among the core elements that justify such a characterization. These were the Babi movement, out of which developed the Baha’i faith, and the movement for reform. Although seemingly separate, these two movements had much in common in terms of promoting reform and modernization. One major common ground was education. Thus, while providing a short sketch of these two movements, the Introduction aims to explain how they helped shape the development of modern education and schools in Qajar Iran. Another major focus of the Introduction is the role of education in the reformist thought of secular Iranians such as Malkum Khan, Talibuf Tabrizi and many others, as well as in the thought of their contemporary Baha’i intellectuals, namely Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha – the early leaders of the Baha’i faith. Their ideas had much in common with the ideas of the secular reformers, and it could be that they nourished and influenced each other in spite of their differences: one group was secular and concerned with Iran, while the other was religious and concerned with the world and mankind. It should be noted that as far as the period under study is concerned, the largest Baha’i community was still in Iran. The decision to characterize Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha as ‘intellectuals’ is entirely mine, and it is solely due to their innovative, progressive and reformist ideas and from the point of view of a non-Baha’i. Since the Baha’i faith was not recognized in Iran, and neither Baha’u’llah as a messenger of God nor ‘Abdu’l-Baha as his successor, then I believe that they should have been categorized by their own Iranian contemporaries (mainly the educated, the reformists and the intellectuals), and later, by scholars of modern Iran, at least as ‘intellectuals’. Surely, in the context of nineteenth-century Iran, the Middle East and the Islamic world (and to some extent even Europe) they were expressing advanced and progressive ideas, written in Persian and Arabic – ideas which, even if not accepted by nonBaha’is as ‘heavenly messages’, surely should have been recognized as ‘modernist’, ‘novel’ and ‘reformist’. Compared to secular Iranian intellectuals of the time, such as Malkum Khan and Akhundzadih, the ideas of Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha were much more advanced and progressive. As far as Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha are concerned, the fact that they did not publicly define themselves as intellectuals does not necessarily mean that they did not see themselves as such – apart, of course, from their main role as religious leaders. There is no doubt, however, that in the religious context, Baha’is follow their instructions because they believe Baha’u’llah to be a messenger from God (and therefore consider his writings the Word of God), and his son ‘Abdu’l-Baha to be his successor, as he was appointed leader of the Baha’i community by Baha’u’llah himself. Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha saw themselves first and foremost as religious leaders; and the Baha’is see it a religious duty to act according to their teachings and pronouncements.\n\nPREFACE\n\nxxiii\n\nChapter One sketches the development of education in Iran from earliest times to the end of the nineteenth century, which is the beginning of the period discussed in this book. It contrasts traditional schools with modern schools, religious schools with secular schools, and state schools with private schools. It also delves into the development of the foreign schools opened in Iran by various religious and cultural concerns (such as the Christian missions, the Alliance Française [AF] and the Alliance Israélite Universelle [AIU]) as well as those operated by the local recognized religious minorities (namely Christians – Armenian and Assyrian – as well as Zoroastrians and Jews). Early Baha’i attempts in the field of education are also discussed, as well as attempts by Shi‘i individuals to introduce modern schools into the country. Thus, Chapters One and Two provide the historical, social, intellectual, religious, economic and cultural background necessary to understand why Baha’i schools fitted so well into Shi‘i Iran at the end of the nineteenth century, and why, in the mid-1930s, from the state’s point of view, they did not. Chapter Two attempts to look into the possible reasons why a Shi‘i monarch (Muzaffar al-Din Shah) was prepared to allow members of the most hated and persecuted minority in Iran at the time (namely, the Baha’is) to open schools, in spite of the obvious and open clerical and popular hatred towards them. In other words, what benefit could Baha’i schools have had for the new Qajar shah and his government, that it surpassed the dangers of a strong opposition to the regime? On the other hand, this chapter also looks into the likely reasons that brought the Baha’is themselves to endeavour to open modern schools at the turn of the century; in other words, why did the Baha’is believe that the circumstances were ripe for such an attempt, while being fully aware of the prevailing high level of anti-Baha’i feelings, sensitivities and prejudice among the local population? Chapter Three is mainly concerned with portraying the high standards of education which Baha’i and other students received at the Baha’i schools they attended. Although it was expected that Baha’i children would attend the Baha’i schools, this chapter tries to explain what exactly it was that made these schools so attractive to some non-Baha’i families, many of whom were very influential and prominent, that they decided to send their children to study in them, notwithstanding the popular anti-Baha’i feelings current at the time. By providing a panorama of cases in which opposition to the Baha’i schools was vociferously and bluntly expressed, Chapter Four attempts to describe the depth and extent of anti-Baha’i feelings in general, and towards the Baha’i schools in particular, feelings which were still current within Iranian society during the late Qajar and early Pahlavi periods. Even so, no matter how harsh and vocal, it was not the popular and usually clerical-led opposition that brought about the closure of the Baha’i schools; rather, it was the state. The possible reasons that led a secular, anticlerical, reformist and modernizing monarch such as Riza Shah, who seemingly had much in common with some of the core principles of the Baha’i faith, to be the one who issued the order to close all Baha’i schools in Iran, are examined in Chapter Five. The chapter also tries to explain why – despite Riza Shah’s uncompromising character and his resolve to crush those who did not abide by his policies of centralization and obedience to the state, and notwithstanding the fragile position of the Baha’is in Iran – the Baha’is finally chose to disregard previous warnings and to close their schools on a day not officially declared by the state as a\n\nxxiv\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nholiday, thereby giving the first Pahlavi state a reason to close them. The chapter attempts to answer these and other questions through the domestic, regional and international prisms. The concluding chapter endeavours to explain the paradoxical situation in which it was a religious Shi‘i monarch who had allowed Baha’is to establish schools in Iran, while it was a secular and anticlerical monarch – whose ideas of reform and modernization plans were supported, in principle, by the Baha’is – who ordered their closure. The Appendix contains a number of tables aimed at providing the reader with various data on the Baha’i schools. Table 1 forms a database for the dozens of Baha’i schools known to have been established in Iran. The data comprises varied information about the schools, including name, identity of founder/s, year founded, staff, gender and number of students, grades, tuition, curriculum, teaching accessories, learning facilities, exams, etc. Table 2 provides similar data concerning a handful of Baha’i kindergartens. The main aim of Table 3 is to give an insight into the kind of non-Baha’i families who chose to send their children (or at least some of them) to Baha’i schools rather than to any other modern school, whether foreign or local. Part of the data and information on the Baha’i schools in these tables is based on the testimonies of a number of surviving former students, who were interviewed either by the author or by others.31 Although most valuable, these testimonies could contain some measure of inaccuracy given the advanced age and lapses in memory of the respondent. In relation to the photographs, the copyright of which is held by the BWC, the information that accompanies them comes from individual donors. The titles of the primary and secondary sources which are not in either English or French are translated in the bibliography. *** My interest in the Iranian Baha’i community was aroused after attending the First International Conference on Modern Religions and Religious Movements in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the Babi and Baha’i Faiths, which was held in Jerusalem in December 2000. Learning that the next conference would be in 2002 in Landegg, Switzerland, with education as its main theme, I decided to participate. I chose the Baha’i schools in Iran as the topic of my lecture. That presentation has since developed into the present book as well as a number of other presentations on a variety of relevant aspects which I have given in Israel and abroad, the last being the 2006 International Society for Iranian Studies Conference in London. As a historian of the Middle East in general and of modern Iran in particular, who carries out research on various subjects, I have encountered a number of studies in a variety of fields and on various topics in which Baha’is were quite extensively involved, but in these studies their role was unfortunately neglected.32 The field of modern education and schools is only one of those cases. This phenomenon, which is unique to Iran and the Middle East, has led me to start looking more deeply into the history of the Baha’i faith in Iran. When an opportunity arose for me to do research at the BWC, I took it. As a historian I was more interested in the historical aspects of the Baha’i faith, namely the history of the Baha’i community in Iran, than in its theological positions. I began to grow curious about the fact that the study of the Baha’i faith and the Baha’i communities throughout the Middle East in general, and\n\nPREFACE\n\nxxv\n\nin particular in Iran, is still in its infancy, is almost exclusively written by Baha’i scholars, and deals mainly with theological aspects. A basic question started to bother me: how can one study modern Iranian history (or major aspects of it) without even referring to the Baha’is – the largest religious minority in Iran – or without looking at any Baha’i material at all? The more Baha’i sources I consulted, the more I learned about modern Iranian history and was able better to understand what I already knew about it. This persuaded me to open a new field of interest and research. I hope that the present study will help others understand the richness of the Baha’i sources and their valuable contribution to the study of modern Iran, as well as the important role played by the Baha’i community and Baha’i individuals in the development and progress of modern Iran.\n\nxxvi\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: EDUCATION IN THE REFORMIST THOUGHT OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY IRANIANS\n\nREFORM IN QAJAR IRAN The ascendance of the Qajars to the Iranian throne in 1796 marked the end of a long period of political instability that had characterized eighteenth-century Iran, and the beginning of a new era that was marked by change and transformation. This new era began with a shock: the military clashes with – and defeats by – Russia, one of the two Western powers bordering Iran, in 1804–13 and 1826–8. These early military defeats had an enduring humiliating effect in the shape of the treaties that formally ended them – those of Gulistan (1813) and Turkmanchai (1828) – and put in motion the process of change in Iran, which, in spite of periodic setbacks, generally moved forward during the nineteenth century. These defeats shocked the Iranians, mainly because they constituted Iran’s first full and lengthy confrontation with the West. Through these conflicts, Iran’s rulers and subjects alike experienced the West’s power and might, and began gradually to comprehend the huge gap that had grown up between their country and the Western world over centuries of the most limited contact. The military defeats by Russia shook the self-confidence of Iranian rulers (who regarded themselves as Zillullah ‘ala al-Arz, or the ‘Shadow of God on Earth’), and it was further shaken by more defeats at the hands of Iran’s other neighbouring European power, British India, either indirectly (through British support of the Afghans in the first Herat Crisis in the mid-1830s), or directly (through British defeat of the Iranian army in the Anglo-Iranian War, 1856–7). These defeats by heretics also shook the belief and confidence that the Iranians had invested in their kings since pre-Islamic times (as possessing ‘Heavenly Splendour’ or Farr-i Izadi), and in their ‘ulama’, who represented God, the Prophet Muhammad and the Imams. It was the ‘ulama’s declaration of jihad (holy war) against the enemies of Islam that caused people to enlist in the war effort in order to protect Islam; but the repeated failure of jihad created doubts, and with those doubts appeared cracks in the strong trust and blind belief that people had in their political and religious leaders and in their faith. It was not a widespread phenomenon yet, for most of the people were illiterate and superstitious, and thus could be easily\n\n2\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nmanipulated by their leaders. Still, a small group of literate people began to question and doubt, though their number grew very slowly, in direct relation to the number of educated people. It was this depressing situation that partly encouraged more Shi‘i Iranians to await even more earnestly the return of the Twelfth Imam (or the Mahdi), a millennium after his disappearance (AH 260/873–4), and to welcome the coming of Sayyid Ali-Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab (whom they believed to be the gate to the Mahdi or the Mahdi himself) and his movement in AH 1260/1844. The pressures for change from the outside were generated by the rise of industrial Europe, the thirst for new markets (from which raw materials could be imported and to which finished goods could be exported), and the struggle for mastery in Europe. These were, in turn, the result and by-products of the process of modernization in the West, which itself was the result of a new historiosophical movement at the end of the medieval period. This movement soon produced new developments in political, economic, social and cultural thought, represented by the theories of leading philosophers, such as David Hume (1711– 1776), Adam Smith (1723–1790), Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), Jeremy Bentham (1748– 1832), Charles Darwin (1809–1882), Thomas Henry Huxley (1825–1895) and many others. They produced new notions in different fields, such as humanism (which became the centre of gravity for modernization); capitalism (in economy); the acknowledgement of cultural negligence and the need to reform it; as well as ‘bourgeoisie’ (in sociology); and ‘legitimate rule’ based on notions such as ‘the will of the people’, ‘national agreement’, ‘social charter’, ‘human rights’, etc. (in politics) – notions that are meaningless outside the context of modernity. These philosophies and notions were instrumental in the modernization of the West, but at the same time it was this very modernization that also produced nationalism, industrialization, economic competition and imperialism.1 By the mid-nineteenth century, the significant achievements of Europe in the areas of science and technology, capitalism and positivism had brought it to the enjoyment of a golden era. This European advancement triggered many non-Western reformers and reformist intellectuals to call for the imitation of the European model, and to equate ‘civilization’ with ‘Western civilization.’ In the Middle East, and due to the military defeats, reform was implemented first in the very area where that defeat was most felt, namely the army, but soon it moved into other fields, covering even the ‘unthinkable’ ones, such as religion (by producing reformist Islamic thought, and religious movements such as Mahdism in the Sudan and the Babi-Baha’i movement in Iran) and politics (by producing pro-constitutional and anti-despotic movements, such as in the Ottoman Empire and Iran).2 At first, Iran came to know the more negative and aggressive side of Western modernism. It was under the umbrella of the civilizing, developing and modernizing of traditional and premodern societies (while in reality the West sought to extend its imperialistic rule over the very same societies), that Iran encountered the West, became one of its markets and soon found itself in the midst of the European great power rivalry which spilled over into the Middle East. As already noted, this encounter was in its most violent form – war – as a result of which Iran gradually became another market for Western economic benefit, and a pawn in European strategic rivalries. It was after this violent encounter that Iran came to witness the more positive and moderate side of Western modernism. It actually started by people asking ‘what needs to\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nbe done?’ – a question that was especially asked between and after the two wars and defeats at the hands of the Russians. The reality was extremely bitter for people such as ‘Abbas Mirza, Nayib al-Saltanih (1799–1833), the Iranian crown prince and governor of Azerbaijan, who, as the person responsible for the defence of Iran’s northern borders, closely witnessed and experienced the progress of Russia as well as the backwardness of Iran. It was these feelings that brought him to initiate reforms, and thus to begin the reformist period in Qajar Iran. Although ‘Abbas Mirza’s reforms were aimed mostly at bridging the gap in military might between Iran and Europe, they were not limited to the military, and some of the reforms had a major and fundamental effect on the modernization of Iran. For example, the foundry that he built for military purposes was soon used for civil purposes as well; his idea of encouraging foreign subjects to migrate to Iran had more than just military thinking behind it; and his decision to send students to study abroad had far greater aims, results and repercussions than those limited to the military field.3 As his historian, ‘Abd al-Razzaq Maftun Dunbuli, put it, ‘Abbas Mirza envisioned an Iran in which its inhabitants ‘would not be in need of other countries in their affairs, its intelligent masters and craftsmen would not look up to foreign countries, and would produce what they needed in this country [Iran].’4 Through the sending of students to Europe, first by ‘Abbas Mirza and intermittently by others after him, Iranians were gradually introduced to Western civilization, culture, society, economy and politics, as well as thought (especially reformist thought), habits, languages, etc. The pressures for change steadily intensified with the loss of territory, human life and revenues, and with a stream of refugees; through the humiliation resulting from the penetration and growing influence of Western powers (an indication of the weakness of the central government); through royal and provincial absolutism; through the insecurity of the populace, subjected to forced conscription into a heavily corrupted army for its adventurous military campaigns, as well as suffering frequent incursions upon villages by frontier nomads (mainly the Turkmen from the north-east), violence committed by brigands and tribes in and between cities, and more frequent outbreaks of cholera and other pandemics that left massive fatalities; through economic pressures caused by a series of capitulatory concessions with enduring effects, growing foreign imports, European customs privileges and decline in the commercial significance of the Persian Gulf as well as in cottage industries; and with the growing burden of tax increases, which was one of the major expressions of injustice, tyranny, extortion and dispossession prevailing in Iran at the time. The more the contact with the West varied and intensified, the more the pressure for change increased in other fields. Thus, what was limited at first to the military/strategic realm soon entered also into the commercial, cultural, ideological, social and political spheres, affecting the various aspects of daily life in Iran. Modern Western technologies (such as steam and the telegraph) clipped geographical and time distances thus bringing Iran closer to Europe, and this meant that more Iranians gradually came to know more about Europe and the Europeans (and vice versa) in a much shorter time. Western manpower – for purposes of military training, diplomatic missions, commercial and other concessions, and education – poured into Iran, training local cadres, employing them, teaching local people in modern schools and in general dealing with the native population in various ways.\n\n4\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nConcurrently, groups of students continued to be sent intermittently to Europe to acquire the skills and knowledge of the new world, something that the state regarded as necessary to keep the country moving forward and enable it to better meet the challenges set by the West. On their return, those students imported into Iran a new vocabulary and culture, as well as innovative ideas, values and concepts.5 This was augmented by a similar contribution on the part of Iranian tujjar (big merchants). Involved in local, regional and international business, they soon adopted Western business techniques, such as banking and means of communication, which rapidly enabled them to increase their import-export businesses. On their return to Iran from Western or Western-style reforming countries, and in similar fashion to the Iranian students, these merchants, along with Iranian diplomats and other travellers, imported their share of Western terminology, culture, ideas, etc. Owing to extensive interactions with populations on the other side of the border, certain areas (such as the south, bordering British India, and the north-west, adjoining the Caucasus), and certain minorities (such as the Zoroastrian community in Iran with their brethren in British India), also formed channels for the dissemination of Western culture and ideas into Iran.6 Pressure for change was also coming from religious, social and ideological movements. American Presbyterian missionaries began missionary activity in Iran in the mid-1830s through the introduction of modern education, as well as by providing modern medical services and some social work. They were soon followed by French, British and many other Western missionaries. Although initially restricted to the Christian communities, later in the nineteenth century their activities gradually spread into non-Christian communities in Iran as well, thereby propagating not only the Christian religion and its values, but also a new culture. In the mid-1840s the Babi movement and later, in the mid-1860s, the Baha’i faith, were introducing not only a new faith or religion, but also rationalism, social reformism and modernization. Their appeal was strong because their origins were generally rooted in Shi‘ism and Shaykhism. The Shi‘i religion and culture formed one of the two pillars of identity among the vast majority of Iranians (the other being the Iranian/pre-Islamic pillar of identity). The Shaykhi school of thought maintained that the Twelfth Imam, during his occultation, guided the Shi‘i community through a ‘perfect Shi‘i’, who acted as a bab (gate) between the Imam and his community. The prevailing atmosphere of despair, humiliation, injustice, violence and insecurity, combined with the fact that Shaykhism gained a wide following in Iran (as well as among the Shi‘a of Iraq), both amongst the ‘ulama’ and their lay followers, and also with the fact that messianic expectations assumed an even more millennial character one thousand years after the disappearance of the Twelfth Imam, led many Shaykhis (as well as other Shi‘is) to expect that the return of the Mahdi was near. It was therefore necessary to prepare the ground for the widespread response to the Bab’s declaration in 1844/AH 1260, among the Shi‘i community in general, and the Shaykhis in particular.7 The idea of renewal, as expressed in the new Babi dispensation, was indigenous to Iran’s non-conformist religious environment. The social and political crisis of the period broadened its appeal to the dissidents among the lower ranks of the ‘ulama’, as well as to younger merchants, artisans, and men and women critical of the clergy’s excesses, government ineptitude, antiquated social and moral mores, and the outside economic\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nforces that threatened the very foundation of the social order.8 Thus, the Babi movement gradually became the first manifestation of popular protest in modern Iran to challenge, theoretically and in practice, the legitimacy of the Shi’i establishment and the Qajar monarchy.9 The Bab’s open announcement, made in July 1848 in Tabriz before a religious tribunal and in the presence of the crown prince, claiming to be the returning Imam Mahdi indeed had revolutionary implications: it marked the era of resurrection (qiyama) and represented a challenge to the entire social order, including both secular and religious authorities, both of whom had a lot to lose if the Bab was recognized as the Mahdi he claimed to be.10 But it soon became clear that the Bab was not just the Mahdi, but was a new point of revelation, presenting a new religious framework entirely different from that of Islam, and introducing a new doctrine and concept: since God is inaccessible to the human creation who has to love Him, God reveals himself through a succession of manifestations, starting with Adam and continuing through Moses, Jesus and Muhammad to the Bab (whom the Baha’is believe to be the Qa’im, ‘the one who will arise’ from the family of Prophet Muhammad, or the very same Mahdi), and in future to ‘Him whom God shall make manifest’ (Man yuzhiruhu Allah) (namely, Baha’u’llah, whom the Baha’is believe to be the return of Christ), and so on indefinitely. Each manifestation (mazhar-i ilahi) gives a more comprehensive and developed expression of the divine teaching, encompassing all previous manifestations.11 The Bab also introduced distinctive forms of ritual prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, tithing, etc. He even allowed merchants to charge interest, in sharp contrast to Islamic law.12 As the new movement spread, it posed a greater danger for both the clergy and state. In a series of bloody confrontations between 1848 and 1852, the Qajar government managed to eliminate most of the movement’s leadership, with the Bab himself executed in 1850. The failed attempt in 1852 on the life of Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1848–96) caused more Babis and suspected Babis to be arrested, tortured and killed,13 and forced the movement in Iran to go underground, while many fled the country altogether. In 1863 (19 years after the declaration of the Bab in 1844)14 Baha’u’llah, who was in Baghdad, informed a number of close followers that he was ‘He whom God shall make manifest’, or the messianic figure promised by the Bab. This was a private declaration. The more public one was in 1867 in Edirne, when he broke all ties with his half-brother, Mirza Yahya Nuri Azal. It was after this event that the vast majority of the Babis accepted his claims, his teachings, and the new faith – the Baha’i faith – which put strong emphasis on kindness, education and science, just rule and protection of subjects from oppression and injustice, political quietism, loyalty to the state, and much more.15 The Baha’i faith thus became a source of religious, moral and social modernism in Qajar Iran, and drew many converts not only from the Babi community, but also from the majority Shi‘i population, as well as from the other religious minorities, especially Zoroastrians (mainly in Yazd)16 and Jews (mainly in Kashan and Hamadan).17 By the end of the nineteenth century the Baha’i community in Iran numbered some 100,000 people, who came from all levels and sectors of Iranian society, and included villagers, artisans, merchants, landlords, courtiers, intellectuals and even clerics, as well as converts from the religious minorities. Thus, these ideas were not limited to only one segment of the population, but found their way into all levels of Iranian society.\n\n6\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nBeginning in the early nineteenth century, but increasingly after the mid-1850s, calls for reform were also coming from intellectual circles in Iran. One of the most outstanding among those figures was Mirza Malkum Khan Nazim al-Daulih, but others, either before, during his time or after him, such as Abu-Talib Isfahani, Mirza Salih Shirazi, Mustafa Khan Afshar, Abu-Talib Bihbihani, Hajj Zayn al-‘Abidin Maraghih’i, ‘Abd al-Rahim Talibuf Tabrizi, Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani,18 Mirza Fath-‘Ali Akhundzadih,19 Mirza Yusuf Khan Mustashar al-Daulih,20 Muhammad Shafi‘ Qazvini21 and many more, supported extensive reforms in general, and educational reform in particular.22 Such reformist ideas and thoughts were expressed by individual intellectuals, but their appeal was mostly limited to a small milieu of court officials and Western-educated Iranians, and at times those ideas also found expression in the shape of certain groupings or societies, such as the local Freemason-modelled Faramush-khanih (lit., ‘House of Forgetfulness’) (1858–61), and the various anjumans (societies) which began to mushroom at the end of the nineteenth and in the early twentieth centuries. It is quite difficult to measure which of these two – the Baha’i or the non-Baha’i reformist thought – had greater impact in Iran; but it would be quite reasonable to state, at the very least, that the reformist ideas of the Baha’i faith played some role in the propagation of reform and modernization in Iran. Thus, towards the end of the nineteenth century, reformist ideas and issues such as opposition to tyranny, the need for justice and order, the advent of modern education, etc., were advocated not only in the works of Iranian secular thinkers and imported Persian newspapers such as Akhtar, (‘Star’), Sur-i Israfil, (‘The Trumpet of Gabriel’), Thurayya, (‘Pleiades’), Habl al-Matin, (‘The Firm Rope’), etc., but also in the writings of Babi and Baha’i leaders, who, in many cases, called for even more extreme reformist measures than the non-Baha’i thinkers (as in the case of the rights of women and minorities).23 Thus, if not one of the prime sources of reformist ideas in Iran, the Baha’i faith and community were probably one of the major catalysts for the spread of reform in general, and of educational reform in particular.24 Certainly, through the practice of their beliefs, the Baha’is in Iran, with their broad representation in Iranian society, helped to disseminate such ideas as reform, modernization, science, technology, modern education, etc., which are fundamental to the Baha’i teachings. The various groups in Iranian society reacted differently to the pressures for reform and to the issue of the collision between tradition and modernity that reverberated through, and was felt by, all levels and sectors. The majority – composed of the decisive majority of the ‘ulama’, the people who followed them, and their traditional allies (traditionalist courtiers, bazaris, landowners, etc.) – still believed that native traditional values, manners and customs had to be preserved and secured from any foreign influence. The advent of change and reform, as well as the importation of each and every new element that originated in a foreign culture, into the decisively traditional Shi‘i society of Iran, was regarded by these traditional forces as a threat to their own position in the society, and a serious blow to native religious and traditional values, and was thus a source for fomenting chaos. This group, led by the almost independent Shi‘i clerical class, with the ‘ulama’ at the top, presided not only over the mosques and the religious endowments but also over the judiciary and educational institutions. They thus succeeded in strengthening their social status and religious authority to such an extent that they were\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nable to confront the Qajar kings, and even to ‘twist their arms’ in a number of instances. What was initially a minor but influential group composed of reformist thinkers, intellectuals, some officials, and members of the Babi and Baha’i communities, gradually grew in number. Unlike the traditionalists, they believed that the adoption of Western techniques and models was the only way to pull Iran out of its dire situation and enable the country to advance and progress like Europe. Naturally, they were hated by the traditionalists, who saw them as enemies, and the existence of the Babis and Baha’is in this second group inflamed the clerics’ hatred still further, often giving them ammunition with which to attack the secular thinkers and accuse them of being Babis and Baha’is. A third group – composed mainly of the shah and his government, who were under pressure from Russia and Britain, as well as from the two groups discussed above – tried to adopt a median path as a compromise between the traditionalists and modernists, both of whom they desired to pacify. Although willing to introduce reforms, they were unwilling to destroy the fabric of their society, with the result that the traditional was preserved alongside the modern. It was this third group, partially backed by the shah, that implemented the reforms. Among them could be seen reform-minded royal princes (such as ‘Abbas Mirza Nayib al-Saltanih),25 prime ministers (such as Mirza Abu al-Qasim Qa’imMaqam,26 Mirza Taqi Khan Farahani Amir Kabir,27 Haji Mirza Husayn Khan Qazvini Mushir al-Daulih28 or Mirza ‘Ali Khan Amin al-Daulih),29 and other ministers and high officials (such as ‘Ali-Quli Mirza I‘tizad al-Saltanih,30 Muhammad Khan Majd al-Mulk,31 Mirza Muhammad-Husayn Khan Farahani Dabir al-Mulk32 and Mirza Yusuf Khan Mustashar al-Daulih). The rivalry between these groups, and especially between the supporters and opponents of reform, kept the society in a constant state of relative tension. As long as the traditional groups in the Iranian society remained united, they could contain the extent of change in the country and keep it minimized. But internal conflicts (such as those between the predominant Usulis and the lesser Akhbaris), combined with social, religious and economic developments, were increasingly challenging the traditionalists’ ascendancy and united stand. In the nineteenth century these developments resulted in fundamental changes within the culture of Iranian society. This, combined with cold and tense relations between the clerical establishment (or at least some leading ‘ulama’) and the state on the one hand, and, on the other, between the state and the merchant and intellectual classes (mainly because of the state’s absolutism and corruption), resulted in some of the ‘ulama’, the merchants and intellectuals shifting towards each other. This trend, combined with periodic waves of reform and modernization, internal chaos, and continued absolutism, led finally to the creation of a wide and popular antiabsolutist and pro-reform movement that was now pushing for genuine reform, not only in the ‘old’ fields of military and administration, but also in new ones such as the educational and political systems, while demanding civil rights and security. One of the cultural results of this movement, which in a relatively short period and in spite of strong opposition and many obstacles managed to leave an important mark on the pillars of social life in Iran, was the establishment of modern schools whose social aim was completely at odds with the old maktab-khanihs and madrasas.33\n\n8\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nSome of the pressures for change and reform were unique to Iran, but some were part of a wider phenomenon, shared by other peoples and countries in the Middle East or in other Eastern lands, namely the clash of East and West, and of the traditional with the modern. These ‘shared pressures’ produced similar results in other parts of the Orient, the Islamic world and the Middle East, and were shaped, in each place, by the prevailing local and unique circumstances. In the Far East, for example, Japan emerged from the world of the past into the modern world with the inauguration of the Meiji (‘enlightened rule’) period (1868–1912). Realizing that Japan must play an international role in the world, the Meiji emperor and his ministers were united in looking towards the West. They hoped and endeavoured to adapt Western ideas while retaining the values of the East; or as one of their spiritual predecessors, the Japanese scholar Sakuma Shozan, wrote: ‘eastern ethics and western science.’ Shozan saw clearly that purity of spirit alone would not defeat Western military might. There was a growing perception that unless some careful modernization was undertaken, the tranquil life of the isolated island empire would be endangered. All efforts were thus directed towards improving the economy of the country and building up its military strength. Foreign experts in transportation, defence, agriculture and industry were employed and their progressive methods carefully studied and adopted. A programme of social reform was put into motion, and a constitution was drawn up. All these and other reforms became the secret of Japan’s victory over Russia in the 1904–5 Russo-Japanese War. Education stood at the heart of these reforms. It was made compulsory and, by the end of the Meiji period, attendance in schools stood at 98 per cent.34 Having received the charter granting the right to trade in India from Queen Elizabeth I (1600), the British, through the East India Company, started first to penetrate, and later to solidify their position in, India. From the late eighteenth century they managed, through occupation and alliances, to strengthen their hold on the country and to turn it into one of the most prestigious colonies in the British Empire. They introduced many reforms into India, which not only served the British, but also had some benefit for the local population. Modern irrigation, transport, communication, administrative, educational and other systems were introduced, which not only modernized the country, but also helped to form the Indian national movement that finally forced the British out of the country.35 In the Middle East, Iran was following rather than leading the ideas for, and attempts at reform, which were expressed and implemented throughout the neighbouring Ottoman Empire and more distant Egypt. While Europe had emerged out of medieval times to undergo the Renaissance, the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution in rapid succession, the countries of the Middle East, including Iran, were still deep in their dreams of Islamic superiority over the Christian world, living with pride in their material and spiritual accomplishments, and believing that they were among the greatest powers in terms of military might and civilization. Although these dreams might have been justified in the early centuries of Islam, they proved untenable in later centuries. After reaching the gates of Vienna for the second time in 1683, the Ottoman Empire, which, under the command of its sultans, controlled a considerable part of the Middle East, began to suffer defeat after defeat at the hands of European armies. It was these defeats, the humiliation of the treaties of Karlowitz (1699) and Passarowitz (1718), and the territorial losses, that brought the Ottomans to acknowledge the superiority of the West,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nand consequently stimulated the desire and drive to adopt Western methods. These became known as the Tanzimat (arrangements, regulations) and formed a major channel through which Western culture, values and technology, along with influence and pressure, were introduced to the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. The outside pressures for change and reform accelerated the pressures inside the Ottoman Empire. As early as the seventeenth century, Ottoman reformers were sponsoring systematic attempts at reform within the Empire, but such ideas were premature for the contemporary circumstances; they had to await the further demonstration of European superiority during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in order to make an impact. The reforms did indeed come, and from above. It was during the reign of Sultan Selim III (r. 1789–1807) that the first comprehensive reform programme, called the Nizam-i Jedid (New Organization), was drawn up. It introduced major changes, mainly in the military field (such as the formation of a modern army corps), but also in education (such as the establishment of technical schools to train cadres) and administration (such as increased taxation). This reform programme continued under Mahmud II (r. 1807–39), but with a much stronger Western orientation and a more radical concept of a centralized state that aimed to revive the absolute authority of the Ottoman rulers, supported by new, technically proficient and entirely devoted elites. This first phase of reform was followed later by the more extensive Tanzimat (Reorganization) reform period (1839–76), through the Gülhane Rescript of 1839, the Hatt-i Humayun of 1856, and the 1876 Constitution. In this period the reform programme was extended from the military, administrative and education fields to economic, social and religious affairs as the result of an Ottoman understanding that radical changes in society were needed to support a centralized state. Later cycles of reform continued with the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, and on down to the creation of the modern nation-state of Turkey and the introduction of more extensive reforms under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.36 Reform in education began with the establishment of professional schools (naval, military engineering, medical, music, military and language schools), and the despatch of students abroad (from 1827), and continued with the creation of a new system of elementary and secondary schools to prepare students for higher technical education. Even so, primary and secondary education remained considerably religious in content until the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1847 the Ottoman Ministry of Education was founded, and began to organize middle schools (rushdiyyih), while the army created a parallel system of secondary schools. These reformist measures continued after the Crimean War (1853–6) with both the ministry and the army introducing arithmetic, geography and Ottoman history to the curriculum. However, despite the good intentions of the Ottoman reformers, the achievements of the Tanzimat in the sphere of education were limited. Elementary education remained very much in the hands of the various religious communities. Progress at the secondary level was slow, but eventually secondary schools were established in all provincial capitals and other large towns. In 1870, a programme was outlined for the foundation of a university, but much of that plan remained in abeyance until the beginning of the twentieth century.37 The three years of the French occupation of Egypt (1798–1801) put in motion a long process of transforming that country from a traditionalist backwater into a modern\n\n10\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nnation. Planning for a permanent occupation, Napoleon Bonaparte had brought with him a flood of engineers, doctors, archaeologists and other scientists to advise him on ways to consolidate French rule over Egypt, exploit its resources and help propagate French culture among the natives. Modern workshops in various fields were set up, and through them modern technology and ideas found their way into Egypt. This intensive period of reform and modernization was followed by more reforms that were introduced by Muhammad ‘Ali (1769–1849), the new ruler of Egypt (r. 1805–49), and by the successive rulers in the dynasty he established in the country.38 Muhammad ‘Ali planned a far-reaching reorganization of the Egyptian state and society. He built a new army and devised a new tax system, in the process breaking all other political forces, destroying Mamluk households, and replacing the old tax-farming arrangements, as well as confiscating the ‘ulama’s tax farms and awqaf (endowments; pl. of waqf). In order to support the state apparatus, he totally reorganized the administration and economy of the country. These and other initial reforms were extended by his descendant, Isma‘il (1863–79), during whose reign Egypt acquired the infrastructure of cultural modernity. The reforms in these various fields required trained cadres, which in turn necessitated the founding of a new school system to train such cadres. Since such a system required much time to establish, and since the need was urgent, Muhammad ‘Ali found it expedient to send students to Europe to acquire skills that they could teach on their return to Egypt. Concurrently, Muhammad ‘Ali established a small number of institutions which offered a modern curriculum to the elite who were needed for the army and the administration. Primary education was virtually neglected under Muhammad ‘Ali and his successors, with the emphasis continuing to be on secondary or higher education in Europe and in the foreign schools established in Egypt, of which there were 146 by 1878. A modern teacher-training college was opened in 1873, but traditional Islamic instruction continued to be the main channel of education.39 EDUCATION IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY IRAN In Iran, as elsewhere, education was one of the most important fields into which major and cardinal changes were introduced. Changing things meant that the new had to be taught. But education – i.e., the teaching staff and schools – was one of the power bases of the Shi‘i clerics in Iran, over which they had almost monopolist control at both elementary and secondary levels. Because the vast majority of clerics opposed reforms, this meant not only that new instructors had to be recruited (at first mainly from outside the country), but also that new schools were needed, since the clerical establishment controlled the traditional maktabs and madrasas. Therefore, reform in education raised the fiercest opposition on the part of the ‘ulama’, for it was regarded by them as a major threat to their high position and status in Iran. Education also plays a central role in the Baha’i faith, for it is the basic precondition for both spiritual and material progress, and it is through education that the Baha’i believer can study and learn, practise and implement the Baha’i teachings. The fact that the Baha’i faith is a cleric-free religion makes it the duty of the Baha’i believer to strive to study the faith, and this would be impossible without education. Thus, education and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nthe need for reform in education became one of the focal points of conflict between traditionalists and modernists, between the anti- and pro-reform factions, and between the anti-Baha’i and Baha’i camps in Iran. Thus, the introduction of modern schools, which in content and in methods of teaching are very different from traditional ones, followed a very difficult and tortuous path. During the nineteenth century in Iran, education gradually turned into one of the main arenas of reform. In the first half of that century, reform in education was to all intents and purposes exclusive and particular to the military (or military-related areas). Thus, Iranian students were mostly sent abroad to study, European instructors were brought to Iran to instruct Iranians, and European military textbooks were translated into Persian, all with the intention of training Iranians in European military-related skills. All this educational activity was largely the result of an initial understanding that Iran’s defeat in two wars against Russia (in 1804–13 and 1826–8), was the result of the superiority of modern European armies over its own traditional forces, and that this superiority could be balanced by introducing European-modelled reform into the Iranian army. This conclusion might appear, in retrospect, to have been somewhat naive, but at the time it seemed logical; after all, other Muslim countries (particularly the Ottoman Empire) whose armies had been also defeated by European powers (particularly Russia), had already taken similar measures and introduced similar reforms in their military forces. But with defeats (such as the Ottoman defeat by Russia in 1828–9, and the Iranian defeat by the British in 1856–7) continuing to occur even after the introduction of military reforms, a deeper and more thorough understanding was beginning to emerge. The realization that the secret of the Europeans’ military superiority lay not only in their military power, but in other fields as well, was understood not only by a few individual reformers, but particularly by an emerging group of intellectuals, some of whom had graduated from European universities, and were thus able to witness the progress made by their host countries in other arenas as well as the military. From their own experience as students as well as observers, they began to look into the reasons for Iran’s backwardness, and sought ways to amend the situation. By publishing their recollections, thoughts and ideas, for example in the form of memoirs of their periods of study, or their true or imaginary travelogues, or their translations of European books into Persian, they brought the reform-seeking movement in Iran into being. Compared to earlier reformers, however, these intellectuals were not advocating the adoption and blind imitation of external or formal reforms, but were calling for the establishment of an extensive and fundamental infrastructure in which education was a major component – a approach that would actually mean slowing the process of reform. In other words, if Iran’s backwardness was regarded as an illness, then the cure had to be applied to its roots; but if the problem lay with the roots themselves – i.e., the existing traditional forms of thought in Iranian society – then those traditional ideas themselves had to be uprooted and replaced by reformist-modernist thought. This could only be achieved through education. The intellectuals and reformists concluded therefore that the key to European superiority was education, and that any real and meaningful progress could be made only through reform in the traditional educational system. In Europe, after all, education had turned unqualified students into qualified cadres, whose expertise had\n\n12\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\ncreated the gap between the West and the East. As a result, educational reform, namely the adoption of Western educational methods and contents, became a central focus within the broader context of the modernization process in Iran as it did elsewhere in Islamic and Eastern lands. This notion of the need for reform in education was supported by a growing number of local intellectuals in the Ottoman Empire, Egypt and Qajar Iran, and gradually influenced reform-minded officials in those countries to initiate and implement reforms in education. In the Ottoman Empire the initiative came mainly from people such as Sadiq Rif’at Pasha and Sayyid Mustafa Sami (in the 1840s) and the Young Ottomans (in the 1860s and 1870s);40 and in Egypt from Rifa‘a Rafi‘ al-Tahtawi (in the 1840s), Muhammad ‘Abduh and Lutfi al-Sayyid (towards the end of the nineteenth century).41 EDUCATION AND THE SECULAR INTELLECTUALS The need for reform in education had already been raised by a few Iranians earlier in the nineteenth century. For example, in their safarnamihs (travel books) both Mirza Salih Shirazi (mainly in England in the 1810s) and Mirza Mustafa Afshar (in Russia in the 1820s) recognized the importance of education in the progress of the country, as well as its key role in the reform process and as one of the basic causes of European strength.42 Ja‘far ibn Ishaq, another writer from the same period (mid-1820s), regarded ‘knowledge’ as being ‘more vital than worship’, and believed that ‘learned people’ (ahl-i danish) were ‘God’s superior creatures.’43 However, such early voices did not carry the necessary weight to bring about a major change in Iran’s educational system, which remained mostly traditional. Change occurred only intermittently and mainly in relation to military or military-related disciplines, either through students being sent abroad or through the bringing in of foreign military tutors. The shift began to be felt later in the century, and was marked mainly by the opening in 1851 of the Dar al-Funun (lit., House of Arts). This was the first state-sponsored, European-style educational institution in Iran, and the graduation of its first class in 1858,44 and the removal of the prime minister of the time, Mirza Aqa Khan Nuri I‘timad al-Daulih (1851–8), occurred in the same year.45 The Dar al-Funun, which produced modern-educated cadres for the Iranian bureaucracy, administration, military, etc., was not only the first polytechnic in Iran, but was also a hub for producing local intellectuals from among its students and staff. One of the first locally employed staff at the school was Mirza Malkum Khan (1833–1908)46 – an Iranian Armenian who had converted to Islam. He studied in Paris (1843–52) and lived for many years in Europe, and thus became well acquainted with Europe and a European lifestyle and thought. Through this experience and exposure Malkum became aware that the superiority of Europe was not just military, but in many others areas, and this understanding led him to promote a broad process of modernization that included the large-scale adoption of European institutions, technology and education. Malkum was vocal in putting forward his ideas to the shah, his government, and the upper (and influential) circles of Iranian society, as well as to the students at the Dar alFunun, and as part of his efforts to promote reform, he managed in 1860 to establish the Faramush-khanih,47 of which some of the above-mentioned students, members of the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nelite, and even ‘ulama’ became members. But his main contribution towards the development of the reform movement in Iran seems to have been in his theories of reform, which he put in writing. These theories were apparently influenced by theories prevalent at the time in Europe, which Malkum attempted to extract from their European context and tailor – using Persian terms with similar meanings – to the Iranian context. Malkum Khan regarded education, or the acquisition of knowledge (‘ilm), as a precondition for people to rise above the animal stage to that of humanism,48 and for societies to reach the highest level of civilization.49 He believed that learning and the acquisition of knowledge alone made human life meaningful, and that civilizations progressed only with the advancement of education.50 Although similar theories prevailed in Europe at the time (such as those of Charles Darwin and Immanuel Kant), there existed some comparable ideas in the Islamic world (such as those expressed by Ibn Khaldun).51 At any rate, whether or not they were affected by those of Malkum, similar notions were expressed by others such as Mirza Nasrullah Bihishti Malik al-Mutakalimin,52 I‘tizad alSaltanih (in his Falak al-Sa‘ada, or ‘Orbit of Happiness’), and Taqi Khan Ansari (in his Janvar-namih, or ‘Book of Zoology’).53 In his writings, which generally advocated comprehensive reform and the adoption of the European model, Malkum Khan laid great emphasis on the complete overhaul and comprehensive change of the educational system in Iran, giving preference to the education of the people (millat) over that of the government (daulat). According to Malkum, education was not only necessary for learning modern technologies, skills and professions but was also very important in nation-building; he firmly believed that the Iranian nation should be taught to know their rights.54 As for the rulers, Malkum was of the opinion that while it was not necessary for them to be highly educated, it was vital for the development of the educational system that they should recognize the importance of education.55 In his first treatise, Malkum drew up a detailed programme for national educational reform in Iran that included three levels of education (elementary, secondary and higher), the necessary European-style curriculum, and the subjects of study for each level; he also outlined provisions for specialized training schools. 56 And whereas prevailing circumstances confined education to a very small and privileged segment of the Iranian population, Malkum Khan believed in universal literacy, and was the first to advocate it. He also felt that the difficulty of the Arabic alphabet, used in Iran (and in the Ottoman Empire) for teaching and writing the vernacular, inhibited the attainment of universal literacy and the spread of modern sciences, and was thus partly responsible for the low status of Muslims. Therefore the Arabic alphabet should be simplified or changed, and this would bring about the spread of education and increase national unity and power.57 The idea of universal literacy or mass education was voiced by other intellectuals as well. In a mostly traditional and illiterate society like that of nineteenth-century Iran, mass education was regarded by these intellectuals as a precondition not only for the advancement of the individual, but also of the society; they also believed that the state should play a central role in such education. The author of Tarbiyat (‘Education’, the first private newspaper in Iran), for example, saw education as ‘the principal cause of progress,’ and argued that it was the ‘duty’ of every government to oblige parents to send their children to school for the benefit ‘of the state and the people.’58\n\n14\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS\n\nAnother intellectual, Mirza Yusif Khan Mustashar al-Daulih, supported and promoted similar ideas, namely the adoption of a state-run compulsory education system in Iran, free for those unable to pay for it.59 Indeed, payment for schooling was a major factor preventing the impoverished masses in Iranian society from obtaining an education. AbuTalib Bihbihani60 saw freedom as the source of Western strength, and universal education as the precondition for that freedom,61 and ‘Ali-Bakhsh Qajar62 advocated a nationwide system of state-run schools.63 Similar ideas were also voiced by Malik al-Mutikallimin,64 who believed that ‘only through knowledge can mankind achieve the highest peaks of progress . . . establish justice, and bring redemption to the world’, thereby achieving freedom and equality. He called modern schools ‘human-producing factories’ (karkhanihyi adam-sazi), and saw knowledge as the sole cornerstone on which depended the destiny of the world, the fate of the nation and the future of the people.65 According to ‘Abd al-Rahim Talibuf (Talibzadih) Tabrizi,66 one of the leading intellectuals of the Qajar period, it was the duty of the state to provide schooling and the duty of the parents to send their children to school. He attempted to develop public support and interest in modern schools, maintaining that education promoted social and occupational mobility,67 and that ‘lack of knowledge and spiritual poverty’ were the ‘enemies of freedom’.68 Probably influenced by Adam Smith, Talibuf regarded a constitution as the precondition for the possession of wealth, order and independence, while education was the main means of cultivating ‘human talent’ (isti‘dad), which equalled ‘economic wealth’.69 Similar views concerning a constitutional regime were voiced by Mirza Yusif Khan Mustashar al-Daulih, who believed that such a regime was closely connected with education: while a constitutional regime was a prerequisite for the spread of education, without education such a regime could not survive, nor could national unity be achieved.70 Hajj Zayn al-‘Abidin Maraghih’i71 also stressed the importance of education and constitution, seeing them as interrelated and crucial for national advancement, progress and prosperity.72 One of the controversial aspects of the need for reform in education was the question of education for women. Some of the intellectuals noted above, along with reformminded officials, had supported women’s education within their call for universal education. This, too, was because of the increasing multifaceted interaction with Europe. However, within the very traditional Iranian society it became a separate issue only at the beginning of the twentieth century, when the Constitutional movement was reaching its peak, and even then it was not because of feminist ideas.
