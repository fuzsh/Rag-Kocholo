        "text": "📢🌍📚 Exciting Announcement: Our New Research Article 'Foreign‐educated academics: Assessing teaching quality and exploring teaching‐related challenges' 🎓🌟 🌐 https://lnkd.in/gxnphu66 In the ever-evolving landscape of higher education, the presence of foreign-educated academics, particularly those who have earned their doctorates abroad, is a dynamic and growing phenomenon, especially in developing countries. While these academics are often seen as a valuable resource for producing quality academic outcomes, it's crucial to understand the nuances of their teaching quality and the unique challenges they face in their home country context. Key Highlights from Our Study: 🔹 We conducted an explanatory sequential embedded mixed-methods study in the context of public sector universities in Punjab, Pakistan. 🔹 Our research involved 814 students and six academics from top- and medium-ranked higher education institutions. 🔹 We developed two research instruments to assess teaching quality and gather qualitative insights. Our Findings: 🔸 Returnee academics demonstrated strengths in areas such as interpersonal behavior, subject mastery, instruction, and learning resources. 🔸 Teaching performance varied by discipline and was influenced by university ranking. 🔸 We identified and explored returnee academics' various academic challenges, offering insights and solutions across different levels. This research is valuable to understanding teaching quality and academic challenges and aligns with Bronfenbrenner's system theory, addressing microsystem, exosystem, and macrosystem levels. Our hope is that this research will serve as a catalyst for higher education authorities and universities to take proactive measures in addressing these challenges. By doing so, we aim to facilitate the smooth and professional reintegration of returnee academics into the local educational system, ultimately enhancing teaching performance and the overall quality of education. I want to extend my gratitude to the dedicated team of researchers who tirelessly worked on this study, and I invite all education enthusiasts, researchers, and policymakers to read, share, and engage with our article. Let's continue working together to improve the landscape of higher education in a globalized world. 🤝💡 #HigherEducation #TeachingQuality #ResearchArticle #DiversityInAcademia #EducationInsights #PakistanEducation Thank you for your support, and I look forward to your valuable insights and feedback on our latest research endeavor! 🌟📚\n\nAchievement Unlocked!🎉 Amid tragic times in my country and the region, I still have the energy to share a major milestone for my upcoming book project. I officially submitted my chapter contribution last night! 🙌 🌟 Dedicated to all the hardworking scholars and educators striving for excellence despite challenging circumstances, our book, \"Preparing Students for the Future Educational Paradigm,\" is a testament to resilience and determination. 📖 🌍 About the Book The future educational ecosystem is rapidly transforming in an era of new technology, globalized markets, and evolving employment needs. This transformation presents both opportunities and challenges for students. The question arises: How can educators strategically adapt and enhance learning ecosystems to prepare students effectively for the ever-evolving educational landscape and future workforce?

The book ‘Start Your University Journey With the End in Mind: A Must-Have Practical Guidebook From Your First Year At University’ is a resource that every undergraduate student needs. It will help undergraduate students to think strategically and to align their resources and decision making with their desired strategic outcome. The book (and Alumni Connect’s Thrive Programme) will equip them to apply strategic planning and execution techniques; personal growth and self-leadership to define and steer themselves to the future they desire.

As part of the OECD conference \"Learning in a Changing World\" on June 18 and 19 in Paris, the OECD's Directorate for Education and Skills, in collaboration with the Yidan Prize Foundation, presented the third volume of the PISA results 2022. In the third volume, the OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) examines for the first time the creative thinking skills of 15-year-old students from 64 countries. The PISA data measure students' skills in four different competency areas: creative writing, visual expression, scientific and social problem solving. The publication shows the differences in performance between different countries, genders, socioeconomic circumstances and school environments. In addition, the PISA results present the strengths and weaknesses of creative thinking and the attitudes of students and teaching staff towards creative thinking. In their speeches at the OECD conference, the head of the Directorate for Education and Skills, Andreas Schleicher, and the founder of the Yidan Prize Foundation, Dr. Charles Chen Yidan, emphasize the importance of creative skills in an age of constant change and innovation. The PISA results on students' creative thinking are intended to help create an evidence base on the state of creative skills in order to develop a support approach for the development of students' creative potential.

Learners must engage with the world and find coherence between the world they experience in school and the world we all wish to build outside school.\" As we continue to actively come up with learning strategies that align with the fast-paced world, we cannot forget to talk about our Kenyan education system as it gradually embraces the competency-based curriculums. It is crucial for institutions of higher learning to consider, evaluate and create new ways for the coming generations to prosper in their own unique worlds. To build these conducive environments for now and our future, we not only need to be highly informed, but also need to learn how to listen, understand, empathize, connect, engage, collaborate, and be active in solving complex problems. Join us in our upcoming Multidisciplinary Conference & Innovation Week (2-5 April) as we delve into Transformative Education and other important sub-themes. This year's core theme is 'From Ideas to Impact: Igniting Cross-Sector Innovation to Shape a Sustainable Future.' #technicaluniversityofmombasa #multidisciplinaryconference #innovationweek #tummultidisciplinaryconference #innovation #sustainablefuture #academia #transformativeeducation #research #researchpapers #contemporarysciences #foodsecurity #blueeconomy #technology #digitalsocieties #scholars #maritimeaffairs #abstracts\n\nAre you interested in thinking about how we can use research well in the education setting? This Discussion Paper from Monash University Mark Rickinson, Lucas Walsh, Jo Gleeson, Blake Cutler and Genevieve Hall examines how using research well can be supported at the system level. Lots of insights and thought provoking points that are drawn from survey, interview and co-design responses from Australian educators and system actors. The paper identifies six system enablers of using research well that cut across three different system levels – actions that support educators as individuals, schools as organisations, and system actors as leaders. This is certainly worth finding time to read.\n\nComplexity as a challenge in teaching sustainable development issues: an exploration of teachers’ beliefs Dorothea Taube Pages: 1-16 | DOI: 10.1080/13504622.2023.2255393 Abstract This article reports the results of an empirical investigation on teachers’ beliefs about teaching and learning and the globalised world as a teaching subject. Following a qualitative reconstructive approach, the study investigated how teachers’ beliefs and the way teachers address the complexity of sustainability issues relate to each other. Based on 17 narrative interviews with secondary school teachers in Germany, the study reveals patterns of how teachers address the complexity of sustainability issues and how these patterns become visible in the way teachers construct the interconnectedness of the world and in their understanding of teaching and learning. Three abstracted ways were reconstructed from the empirical material: (1) promoting an authentic perspective in teacher-led approaches, (2) focusing on multiple perspectives in fact-based approaches and (3) emphasising reflexivity in addition to multiple perspectives on global issues in student-centred approaches. The article discusses the findings in terms of their relevance to current knowledge about students’ learning processes. #complexity #teaching #educationforsustainabledevelopment #authenticity #reflexivity #values #SDG4 https://lnkd.in/gR8e7839"
