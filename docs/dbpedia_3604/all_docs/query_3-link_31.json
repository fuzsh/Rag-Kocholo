        "text": "Background\n\nCardiac disease covers a range of cardiac conditions, including heart attacks and coronary artery disease [1]. Heart disease is sometimes considered a male illness, but the fact that women die of heart disease at the same rate as men each year contradicts this notion [2]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 56% of women recognize that heart disease is their leading cause of death [3]. Heart disease was reported to be the primary cause of death among women in the United States in 2020 [4]. For more precise results, it has been found that the most prevalent form of heart disease, coronary heart disease, affects approximately 1 in 16 (6.2%) women aged 20 years and older [5]. Recent data indicate a stall in the declines in coronary heart disease incidence and mortality, especially in younger women aged <55 years [6]. Furthermore, new issues had emerged in transitional countries as a result of globalization, which increased risk factors and sedentary lifestyle adoption, having sharply increased cardiovascular mortality rates [7].\n\nSex chromosomes alter gene expression, which may then be further altered by sex-specific hormonal variations, resulting in sex-specific cardiovascular gene expression and function [6]. These differences result in variations in the prevalence and manifestation of cardiovascular disorders, including those related to autonomic regulation, hypertension, diabetes, and vascular and cardiac remodeling [8].\n\nAge, smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, pulse, mean arterial pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, poor diet, and lack of physical activity are the primary risk factors for heart disease [9]. Many clinical examinations are available to diagnose coronary heart disease, including electrocardiography, cardiac enzyme assays, x-ray imaging, and angiography [10]. The data stored in the electronic health system of a health care organization generates a vast amount of unanalyzed raw data that aid in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [11].\n\nCurrently, machine learning algorithms (MLAs), as a specific artificial intelligence modality, are playing an important role in the field of disease prediction including cardiology mortality prediction, big data storage, acquisition, and recovery as primary prevention strategies [12,13]. A widespread MLA data set is used to predict mortality among women—through what is known as data mining—to determine significant features of variables that assist in detecting the main causes of mortality in this target group of the population since such risk prediction is an integral aspect according to the international guidelines of primary prevention of heart disease [14,15]. Thus, understanding the unique aspects of predicting mortality due to heart disease in women, including a lower incidence of heart disease due to a later age of heart disease occurrence, development of new prediction models, and differences in the effects of laboratory data—known as biomarkers—are critical factors in predicting mortality due to heart disease. However, there is a scarcity of studies that effectively predict mortality caused by heart disease among women. Hence, this study aims to effectively predict heart disease among women, using the MLA data set.\n\nPredictive Model\n\nThe CHAID model demonstrates the most accurate model, out of 9 models, to predict death versus life status among women with heart disease, with an overall accuracy of 93.25% and AUC of 82.5% ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nModelOverall accuracy (%)Area under the curveCHAIDa93.250.825C593.090.500Quest93.090.500C&Rb tree93.090.500Discriminant75.350.733Decision list46.790.699Bayesian network17.850.657Neural network17.260.534Logistic regression16.960.481\n\nThe CHAID model helps in analyzing the given data to understand the main characteristics that are mostly associated with a given outcome or being a member of a target group. The results of the CHAID model are presented skillfully for interpretation as a decision tree graph [18]. The CHAID model merges the values of the target variable that is deemed to be statistically homogeneous while retaining all heterogeneous values. The first branch of the decision tree is then constructed using the best predictor, with each child node containing a set of uniform values from the selected field. The statistical test that is used depends on the target field's level of measurement, and this process is repeated until the tree is fully developed [19]. In addition, this model is similar to the other MLA as it divides the sample data into 70% (testing data set) and 30% (training data set) to determine whether the model generates reliable results.\n\nThe 17-node model was created using the SPSS Modeler. Multimedia Appendix 1 shows that the graph of the study, as produced by the interactive CHAID tree's beginning node, branched to 4 nodes (nodes 1-4) based on tissue oxygenation (measured with pulse oximetry) with a cutoff value of 93% since women who had an oxygen saturation of ≤93% were at a high risk of death caused by heart disease (n=34, 27.87%). In node 2, women who had an oxygen saturation of 93% and 95% had a mortality rate of 4.3%, node 3 shows that women who with an oxygen saturation of 95% and 96% had a death rate of 27.1%, and node 4 shows that women who had an oxygen saturation of >96% had the lowest mortality rates (12.9%; χ23=140.7; P<.001).\n\nFurther, in the model, node 1 was split into 2 nodes, nodes 5 and 6, based on the pulse rate with a cutoff value of 97 beats per minute. Women who had a pulse rate of >97 beats per minute were at a higher risk of death (n=1257.14%; χ21=10.8; P=.19). Node 2 split into 3 nodes based on age: nodes 7-9. Women who were older than 72 years were at a higher risk of death (n=45, 10.0%; χ23=56.4; P<.001). Node 7 split into 2 nodes, nodes 12 and 13, based on SBP with a cutoff value of >187 mm Hg and a mortality rate of 8.5% (χ21=23.4; P<.001). Node 4 split into 2 nodes, nodes 10 and 11, based on the pulse rate (heart rate) with a cutoff value of 97 beats per minute. Women with a pulse rate of >97 beats per minute had a higher mortality rate (n=8, 38.1%; χ21=13.7; P=.004).\n\nNode 9 split into 2 nodes based on medical diagnosis: nodes 14 and 15. Women diagnosed with congestive heart failure were at a higher risk of death (n=31,16.58%) than those with angina pectoris (n=14, 5.32%; χ21=15.4; P<.001). Moreover, node 14 split into 2 nodes, nodes 16 and 17, based on pulse pressure with a cutoff value of 98 mm Hg. Women who had a pulse pressure of >98 mm Hg had a higher mortality rate (19.4%; χ21=13.7; P=.002).\n\nPrincipal Findings\n\nSeveral independent variables emerged as predictors of mortality caused by heart disease among the study participants, using the decision tree approach of the CHAID model. The CHAID model is a data mining technique that highly facilitates graphical presentation that provides an easy way for data interpretation in the medical field, with notable advantages over other models such as logistic regression analysis. In addition, it provides the ability to deal with multiple nodes, since it emerges all variables in a given data set [20].\n\nRetrospective data were extracted from the EHRs and used to effectively predict death versus life status among Jordanian women who had heart disease. The built model predicts several predictor variables to identify women with heart disease who were at a high risk of death.\n\nThis study concluded that oxygen saturation (measured with pulse oximetry) is the most important predictor of death versus life status among female patients. We found that women with low tissue oxygen saturation had higher mortality rates than those with normal oxygen saturation. This finding is consistent with that of Cahyati et al [21] since they mentioned that lack of oxygenated blood in the myocardium is caused by atherosclerosis or plaque formation that blocks blood supply to the heart muscle. In turn, this leads to the formation of blood clots in the narrowing arteries, thus preventing blood flow to the cardiac system. This blockage can disrupt oxygen supply throughout the body, and the patient experiences shortness of breath, which, in turn, reduces oxygen saturation.\n\nSecond, pulse rate (heart rate) is the leading factor driving an increase in mortality among women. We found that women with a heart rate of >97 beats per minute are at a high risk of death. Many studies reported that heart rate is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death [22,23]. Another large follow-up study and meta-analysis conducted by Tadic et al [24] supported the relationship between heart rate and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among the general population; they reported that heart rate has a negative effect on both cardio- and cerebrovascular mortality, and that it is recommended to reduce the heart rate among these populations in order to prevent the primary and secondary effect of cardiac events.\n\nThe third factor was related to aging, which increases the risk of death, particularly among women. This result is consistent with those of other studies that explored the association between the aging process and the risk of death caused by cardiovascular disease. Rodgers et al [25] and Woodward [26] reported that age is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular events owing to corresponding reductions in sex hormones (primarily estrogen), which plays an important role in protecting against heart disease.\n\nSystolic blood pressure is the fourth leading cause of the increased risk of mortality among women. Our results show that any woman who has an SBP of >187 mm Hg was at a high risk of death due to heart disease. This finding paralleled that of Razo et al [27], who reported the substantial causal relationship between SBP and the development of ischemic heart disease at a cutoff point of 165 mm Hg. This finding could be attributed to the aging process that is associated with many devastating lifestyle changes such as increased sodium intake, decreased intake of fruits and vegetables, increase cholesterol level, and decreased physical activity, which lead to a substantial increase in SBP.\n\nThe fifth-ranking predictor, medical diagnosis of women, contributed as a risk factor of death since we found that women who had congestive heart failure were at higher risk of death than those who had coronary heart diseases such as angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction. Many previous studies verified that female patients with heart failure experience persistent death and high mortality due to a reduced ejection fraction [28]. The statistical analysis conducted by the American Heart Association reported that heart attacks and coronary heart diseases were the main causes of death among individuals with cardiovascular disease [29].\n\nAs the sixth-ranking predictor of mortality risk among women, pulse pressure was the last factor in this study in the built model. Our model predicted that a pulse pressure of >98 mm Hg increased the risk of death among women. Previous reports have shown that pulse pressure is an important determinant of, and greatly influences, the development of heart diseases since it increases arterial stiffness resulting from the loss of elastin and collagen, leading to increases in the SBP and pulse pressure velocity [30,31]."
