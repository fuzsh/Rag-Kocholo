        "text": "Judy Garland, mainly known for her role in the 1939 Wizard of Oz film, was an actress as well as a singer who did a variety of roles. She was known internationally for her acting and singing but she was first spotted when she did a vaudeville show with her 2 sisters. From there she went on to working for Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer, where she met her Vincente Minnelli.\n\nOn June 15th 1945, Judy Garland married her 2nd husband, director Vincente Minnelli. While Garland had been working on the film Meet Me in St. Louis, she had met Vincente Minnelli, the director of that film. While filming they began to date.\n\nSix years after their marriage and five years after having daughter Liza Minnelli, they divorced. The marriage was full of problems seeing as how Judy had fallen into postpartum depression after having Liza and then followed that with an affair and hallucinations. They tried to save their marriage, but her mental health would not allow it to work in the long run."
