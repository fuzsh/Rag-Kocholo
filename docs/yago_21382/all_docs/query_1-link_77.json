        "text": "David Gest, the reality TV star and former husband of Liza Minnelli, has been found dead in a five-star London hotel in \"unexplained\" circumstances.\n\nThe 62-year-old music producer's body was discovered at the luxury Four Seasons hotel, in Canary Wharf, on Tuesday morning.\n\nScotland Yard said the death of the star - who was due to begin a UK tour of a musical called David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul this summer - is \"unexplained\" and a post-mortem examination will be carried out.\n\nPolice were called to the hotel, in Westferry Circus, at about 10.15am.\n\nParamedics were called, but Gest was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nIt is believed that Gest's death is not being treated as suspicious and detectives are understood not to have found any obvious causes at the scene.\n\nThe former Celebrity Big Brother star was married to Minnelli from 2002-2003, but they only officially divorced in 2007.\n\nGest was also known for being a close friend of the late Michael Jackson.\n\nThe TV personality was a familiar face on British TV, appearing in I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2006 and in Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year, which he exited after only 13 days due to ill health. He also appeared on ITV's Grease Is The Word.\n\nFriend Imad Handi said: \"It is with great sadness that I can confirm that David Gest has died today.\n\n\"David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.\n\nMr Handi added: \"I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.\n\n\"If I may steal the words of one eminent critic, David was a natural star and a genuine celebrity. I will miss him desperately.\"\n\nGest married Minnelli in March 2002 in a star-studded ceremony with Michael Jackson as best man and Elizabeth Taylor as maid of honour.\n\nBefore filing for divorce, Gest sued Minnelli for assault, claiming that she had beaten him so badly during alcoholic rages that she caused him nerve damage and caused him to be treated in hospital for five days.\n\nGest grew up with Jackson and his brothers in California, and was close friends with the family.\n\nHe was a successful producer and in 2001 his television special on the 30th anniversary of the launch of Jackson's solo career was the highest rated in history.\n\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, ahead of one of his shows in Eastbourne, he spoke frankly about not wanting to be famous while he was married to Minnelli.\n\nHe said: \"There's a part of me that never wanted to be quote 'a celebrity' when I was married - I can't remember the woman's name.\"\n\nPrompted by the interviewer that it was Minnelli, he responded: \"I knew it was Elizabeth. I never wanted to be in the public eye. It's very hard when you wake up each day and there's press outside your house.\n\n\"I would never want to live that type of life, I live a very simple life.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Gest spoke to The Grimsby Telegraph about where he wanted to be buried.\n\nHe said: \"I will never go back to LA; I will die here and want to be buried in York. I love this country much more than my own.\"\n\nFellow Celebrity Big Brother housemate Danniella Westbrook said: \"David Gest was a beautiful soul and I will miss him dearly.\n\n\"David was like a father to me in the Celebrity Big Brother house. He told me I should be proud of who I am and I was Danniella Westbrook and that was ok.\n\n\"He gave me strength every day, he got me and I will never forget him. A shining star who will live in my heart forever.\"\n\nNancy Dell'Olio, who also appeared on Celebrity Big Brother, said: \"I am very shocked. I can't believe it. I spoke to him just a few weeks ago. I felt that something was not right the last time I saw him. It's very sad news indeed, he will be sorely missed.\"\n\nScotland Yard statement on star's death\n\nA Scotland Yard spokesman said: \"Police were called at 10.17am on Tuesday 12 April to the Four Seasons hotel, in Westferry Circus, E14, to reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s.\"\n\nThey added: \"London Ambulance Service were called to the scene. Life was pronounced extinct at the hotel.\n\n\"A post-mortem will be held in due course. Next of kin are in the process of being informed.\"\n\nHow show title David Gest Is Not Dead was created\n\nThe name for Gest's upcoming tour was inspired by an incident in the Celebrity Big Brother House in January when American reality star Tiffany Pollard mistakenly believed Mr Gest had died rather than David Bowie.\n\nSpeaking to the Hull Daily Mail to promote the tour, Gest said: \"Tiffany was told 'David is dead' and thought it was me. There was an uproar because I'd been ill.\n\n\"Darren Day pulled back the covers and said 'are you alive?' - I said 'As far as I know I am'.\n\n\"It became a sensation all over the country that David Gest is alive and not dead.\""
