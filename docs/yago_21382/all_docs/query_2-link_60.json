        "text": "I think this is one of the most delightful Liza Minnelli interviews I’ve ever seen!\n\nMaybe Liza was at her best and feeling dishy because she was sitting down with fellow 60-something force of nature Joy Behar on her HLN talk show.\n\nJoy very candidly started asking Liza about her extravagant wedding to creepy David Gest and I’m so glad that Liza has a great sense of humor about that trainwreck time in her life.\n\nWe all remember how Gest, who later alleged on Dateline NBC that our Liza beat him during the marriage, rammed his tongue down Liza’s throat at the wedding. She looked embarrassed at the time and now reveals that she was thinking: “WTF?”\n\nMichael Jackson was best man at the wedding, Elizabeth Taylor the maid of honor.\n\nYears later, Liza asked Michael: “Why did you let me marry that IDIOT?”\n\nMichael: “I thought you liked him! You looked so happy!”"
