        "text": "Unsurprisingly, the best live coverage of the wedding came from an uninvited Michael Musto watching from across Fifth Avenue:\n\nExtra Item: Here’s more about Liza Minnelli and David Gest‘s wedding at Marble Collegiate Church, as glamorously seen from across the street. The A-list (the bridal party and other superstars) were ushered in through the side entrance, while the B-list (forgotten movie and TV stars) went in the main way, so you know where I was positioned. In this prime spot, I was mostly bombarded with the sight of people you didn’t know were still alive (My Little Margie‘s Gale Storm, Mildred Pierce‘s Ann Blyth—basically all the same folks who were at Mama’s weddings). Little Mickey Rooney showed up around the same time as diminutive Paul Williams, so we got to see for all time that Rooney’s way shorter. Sixties legend Petula Clark got no applause of recognition from the crowd, while David Hasselhoff was greeted with a rousing ovation. And Dominick Dunne turned up, cementing one’s suspicion that this was a crime scene. I kept scrutizing the arrivals from the (David) Gest list to see if he’s indeed a friend of Dorothy, but whatever the case, there were tons of gays running around—and this on Fifth Avenue, the same day as the St. Patrick’s Day Parade! That redeemed the whole mummified circus, which one sardonic onlooker compared to the card party in Sunset Boulevard, though he stayed for hours. Not me—I left when Joan Collins arrived with her young beau and said she hopes Liza and David will be as happy as they are.\n\nFurthermore: As she reminded us on Wednesday night’s Larry King Live, Liza is an old-school pro who always gives the impression that everything’s completely peachy while not offering any concrete information about anything. To lovable Liza, wedding no-shows like her half-sister Lorna Luft and singer Whitney Houston are simply close friends who were understandably busy. And Liza was all goo-goo-eyed about the wedding itself, expressing amazement that it seemed to spontaneously bloom into a gigantic expression of joy (though it was planned as a star-laden spectacle and flogged to death for months). Asked if the affair was too hyped, Liza looked dumbfounded and said, “For who?” Cutest of all, she said it was sort of an offering to New York in the wake of 9-11 and the after-party on Wall Street was hubby David Gest’s nice gesture to a hard-hit area!\n\nLarry alternated between gushing over how happy Liza looked and going in for the kill with questions about whether she’s just repeating Mamma’s bad patterns (which Liza just evaded, naturally). Finally, Gest came out—I mean emerged—and told a mean story about how he met Liza when he thought she was overweight and off-key, and he had to audition her to be on that Michael Jackson freakshow tribute he produced! Asked about the gay rumors, Gest simply said that he and Liza have their own world and “I know who I am and she knows who she is.” But does she know who he is?\n\nLiz wore slippers with her dress and was very late. Held up the whole affair. That I remember. A delayed party and honeymoon for The Guests.\n\nJoy Behar joked about this wedding - which she attended. All kinds of folk were invited. Joy never even met Liza except for once on The View.\n\nThe important thing to remember, is that it was a Good Time. A Party. The BEST time.\n\nFor a few months, Liza was her version of sober. Even longer she was on a strict diet. David was a brutal task MASTER. Lisa loves KINK. She was able to return to singing badly again, with more than a bit of talent peaking through. Vanity Fair did a big piece and lots of photos on her comeback and none of it was kind. At least Liza and David had great sex! Not as good as she enjoys with Feinstein!\n\nOkay. Jesus. I was at the wedding so I saw it all. Liz Taylor said to me later that the man with me was a fag and I said, \"Well, at least I didn't marry one\", pointing my champagne glass at Liza and David. Liz laughed loud and hard and reminded me that she had only ever taken straight dick. I also was wondering where Lucille Ball was but Gary talked her out of attending. That was too bad. I wanted to sing but for some reason they all said NO. Well, that was then and this is now.\n\nI slapped the shit out of that cunt Lisa Mordente for insulting Liza with cheap lesbo jokes (she is NOT one of them!) And if I Ever see that fag cunt Lizsha again (She avoided me like The Plague all evening), I will slap the shit out of her so hard she will land in the valley of the dolls. What a cunt.\n\nL\n\nLiz was gross. Just because you once were beautiful is no reason to bother the world forever with your shrieking voice, simpering \"femininity\" and indomitable, very EXPENSIVE spirit. Liz Taylor was a greedy and self indulgent old MOVIE STAR. She didn't show up for anything, including a very well paid movie role without daily gifts of JEWELS and compliments. Hours late.\n\nI wouldn't call her a whore, because she was more some sad old flap of immaturity in need of constant attention, gifts and praise. The most spoiled woman on earth. For no good reason. She was all too briefly beautiful. The roles and husbands stop coming after a while - so she took up a charity! And plug your F R A G R A N C E while raising money for the dead. She probably was an OK broad. Nothing like an actual human being though. She and Michael were born to be friends. They showed up about twice a year, after months of negotiations and bribes.\n\nI find wet brain stupidity hard to take. Liz, Liza and a few other hard core addicts were praised for NOTHING but breathing for the last 20 years of their life.\n\nDavid Gest was a suitable husband for Liza. Did she ever hit these notes again? Would she have lived as long without him. No & No.\n\n[quote] Michael Jackson’s genius, other than his musicianship, is his emotional intelligence.\n\nHe didn't have ANY \"intelligence\", emotional or otherwise. He was shrewd though, and manipulative. He knew if he made a big show of fawning over people like Liz Taylor (he also wooed her with expensive jewels, which of course won her over completely) and Liza Minnelli and Marlon Brando they would befriend him. He did the same trick with the parents of the little boys he wanted to have sex with; won them over by being generous and attentive. He knew they were thrilled to be in his company and in the company of other celebrities. He made them believe he was just a harmless child man who loved little children. IT was all deception. He wasn't \"intelligent.\" He was a snake.\n\nFrom the Observer:\n\nRe Liza: Here’s another good bit of dish. Apparently, before her wedding, Liza recklessly chucked out all her old Halston-designed furniture. Who knew there was such a thing? Anyway, it seems that deco-lovin’ David wasn’t digging Liza’s ultrahip, Ultrasuede chairs and Lucite tables and arranged to have them all dumped on the sidewalk. A pal tipped off Liza as to the value of her discards. Hysterical, the couple of the moment flew downstairs, only to find that some enterprising picker-who more than likely now has a store on Lafayette Street-had snagged the lot.\n\nHow come this missing cache of 1970’s relics is not on America’s Most Wanted ? If John Walsh won’t do anything about this situation, then I will. Information about the whereabouts of this furniture should be e-mailed to me at simonsays@observer.com.\n\nLet’s find Liza’s furniture and get some closure for this right-thinkin’ family.\n\nI've mentioned this before, but the gayest evening of my life was when I went to see Minnelli on Minnelli at the Palace Theater in December 1999, I was seated in an aisle seat three rows behind Angela Lansbury, who was being chatted up by Harvey Fierstein (standing in the aisle) shortly before the curtain went up. Liza later called Angela out from the stage and mentioned the films Angela had worked on with Vincent Minnelli (no mention of the movies she made with Judy - but then the show was meant to focus on the work of Vincent Minnelli.). Later, the show went into Peak Gay Mode when Liza began singing The Trolley Car Song along with Judy while the Trolley Car scene from Meet Me in St. Louis was being projected on a huge film screen behind her.\n\nI guess today they would do a hologram.\n\nIt's called a sober coach R463. That was not gonna do it for Liza. She needed to be in LOVE. She may be a sweet woman but by all accounts she is close to moronic and self involved to the point of not being able to hold a conversation that doesn't center around her. LIGHT ME!\n\nI think David Gest deserves a medal to get that bloated lateral lisping broken down 56 year old crooked hip sad woman close to up on her feet again. She only really cared about her career and he wanted some credit for making her almost presentable. Nothing wrong with that. Read the stories. She was DEAD. But she need to believe that \"David\" loved her to even attempt to obey him. You can pay someone to tell you what to eat and do 24 hours a day - but you can't pay someone to love you and listen. Gest probably thought she WAS a great star who could be rejuvenated. With all the things Liza did in her life, it is impossible to be \"naive.\" She was sensationally debauched. These people are pretend helpless. Liza is a manipulator with little shame. Yes, she has a disease. About 23 of them.\n\nYou're nuts R483. She's not high there and she's been fatter -but her voice was limited to a few notes and they were raspy. She couldn't keep up with the song. Never mind hit the notes. Liza making arm movements and grand gestures to cover up for bad singing on BIG songs has been going on for many, many years. But it doesn't all leave in a day and sometimes it comes back. No different from Judy, Aretha or Whitney. They declined incrementally, but occasionally rose from the dead and amazed.\n\nLiza loves singing Some People and her gestures are always the same. She had the energy and a lot more voice to go with it. I said she should have been given the chance to play Mama Rose on the BIG screen. She was so dynamic. And fucked up and specific as she is - Liza is a pretty good actress too."
