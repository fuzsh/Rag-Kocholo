        "text": "David Gest – who was 61 when he was found dead Tuesday in London – had a history in showbiz long before his marriage to Liza Minnelli crumbled into tabloid fodder and he found fame in reality TV.\n\nA Los Angeles native, Gest was born on May 11, 1953. Growing up, he was a close friend of Michael Jackson and his brother Tito.\n\nWorking in the entertainment industry, the producer achieved his biggest career feat in 2001, producing the highest-rating musical television special in history: Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration, about his longtime childhood friend.\n\nWhile the Jackson special amped his acclaim, he also met his first and only wife, Liza Minnelli, working on it.\n\n\"I remember what a gentleman he was and how attractive I thought he was,\" Minnelli told PEOPLE in 2001 of the first time she met Gest. \"I have never had anyone take care of me before. I must say, it is an amazing feeling.\"\n\nAfter helping the actress-singer lose nearly 50 pounds, Gest and Minnelli said ''I do'' in a star-studded 2002 ceremony, where Jackson stood as his best man and Elizabeth Taylor her matron of honor.\n\n\"I have a man who loves me. I thrive on it. I am alive,\" Minnelli told PEOPLE ahead of their nuptials.\n\nBut alas, their love wasn't meant to last.\n\nThe couple split after less than a year. As Minnelli's pal, New York Post veteran gossip columnist Cindy Adams told PEOPLE at the time: \"They were never going to celebrate a gold wedding anniversary ... This was not what you call [a match] made in heaven. This was showbiz glitz.\"\n\nTheir divorce proceedings quickly turned into tabloid fuel. Months after their split was announced, Gest sued Minnelli for $10 million, claiming he was a victim of domestic violence. Weeks later, Minnelli hit back, suing him for $2 million and alleging he failed her as an agent. (Gest's suit was thrown out, but the exes didn't settle their divorce until 2007.)\n\nRELATED: David Gest: Life in Pictures"
