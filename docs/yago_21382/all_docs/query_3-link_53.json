        "text": "Liza Minnelli plays herself in the tenth episode of the second season, The Surprise Party. Minnelli performs A Love Letter From the Times for Ivy Lynn after being asked to by Tom, due to the fact Tom forgot Ivy Lynn's birthday it was his way to make it up to her.\n\nLiza May Minnelli (born March 12, 1946) is an American actress, singer and dancer. She is the daughter of singer and actress Judy Garland and film director Vincente Minnelli.\n\nAlready established as a nightclub singer and musical theatre actress, she first attracted critical acclaim for her dramatic performances in the movies The Sterile Cuckoo (1969), and Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon (1970); Minnelli then rose to international stardom for her appearance as Sally Bowles in the Cabaret 1972 film of the Broadway musical Cabaret, for which she won the Academy Award for Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She later co-starred in Arthur (1981), starring with Dudley Moore (in the title role) and Sir John Gielgud.\n\nWhile film projects such as Lucky Lady, A Matter of Time and New York, New York were less favorably received than her stage roles, Minnelli became an entertainer in television, beginning with Liza with a Z in 1972, and on stage in the Broadway productions of Flora the Red Menace, The Act and The Rink. Minnelli also toured internationally and did shows such as Liza Minnelli: At Carnegie Hall, Frank, Liza & Sammy: The Ultimate Event, and Liza Live from Radio City Music Hall.\n\nShe starred in Liza's Back in 2002. She had guest appearances in the sitcom Arrested Development and had a small role in the movie The OH in Ohio, while continuing to tour internationally. In 2008/2009, she performed the Broadway show Liza's at The Palace...! which earned a Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Eve.[1]\n\nMinnelli has won a total of four Tony Awards, including a Special Tony Award.[2] She has also won an Academy Award, an Emmy Award, two Golden Globes and a Grammy Legend Award for her contributions and influence in the recording field, along with many other honors and awards. She is mistakenly thought to be among the few entertainers List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|who have won an Oscar, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Award, however, she was given a Grammy Living Legend Award and her Grammy was not earned in a competitive category. In 2000, Minnelli was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fam.[3]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nMinnelli was born on March 12, 1946 in Hollywood, California, to Vincente Minnelli and Judy Garland.[4] She attended New York City's High School of Performing Arts and Chadwick School.[5] Her first performing experience on film was at age three where she appeared in the final scene of the 1949 musical In the Good Old Summertime. The film starred Garland and Van Johnson.\n\nMinnelli has a half-sister and half-brother from Garland's marriage to Sid Luft named Lorna Luft and Joey Luft. She also has another half-sister, Christiane Nina Minnelli (nicknamed Tina Nina), from her father's second marriage.[6] Minnelli's godparents were Kay Thompson and Ira Gershwin. Her parents named her after Ira Gershwin's song \"Liza (All the Clouds'll Roll Away)\". Kay Thompson was most notable as author of the Eloise book series for children, which was partly inspired by the antics of Minnelli when she was young. The character of Eloise was illustrated by Hilary Knight.[7]\n\nCareer[]\n\nTheatre[]\n\nDuring 1961, Minnelli was an apprentice at the Cape Cod Melody Tent, Hyannis, Massachusetts. She appeared in the chorus of Flower Drum Song and played the part of Muriel in Take Me Along. Minnelli began performing professionally at age 17, in 1963, in an Off-Broadway revival of the musical Best Foot Forward, for which she received the Theatre World Award. The next year, her mother invited Minnelli to perform with her at the London Palladium. She attended Scarsdale High School for one year, starring in a production of \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" which then went to Israel on tour. She turned to Broadway at 19, and in 1965 she became the youngest woman ever to win a leading actress Tony Award for Flora the Red Menace. It was the first time she worked with the musical duo John Kander and Fred Ebb.\n\nMusic[]\n\nMinnelli began as a nightclub singer as an adolescent, making her professional nightclub debut at the age of 19 at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C.. She later appeared in other clubs and on stage in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and New York City. Her success as a live performer led to her recording several albums at Capitol Records: Liza! Liza! (1964), It Amazes Me (1965), and There Is a Time (1966). In her early years, she recorded traditional pop standards as well as show tunes from various musicals in which she starred. Because of this fact, William Ruhlmann named her “Barbra Streisand's little sister”.[8] The Capitol albums Liza! Liza!, It Amazes Me, and There Is A Time were reissued on the two-CD compilation The Capitol Years in 2001, in their entirety.\n\nFrom 1968 to the 1970s, she also recorded her albums Liza Minnelli (1968), Come Saturday Morning and New Feelin' (both 1970) from A&M Records. She released The Singer (1973) and Tropical Nights (1977) from Columbia Records.\n\nIn 1989 Minnelli collaborated with Pet Shop Boys on Results, an electronic dance-style album. The release hit the top 10 in the UK and also charted in the US, spawning four singles: Losing My Mind; Don't Drop Bombs; So Sorry, I Said; and Love Pains. Initially released on VHS titled Visible Results, the clips were later issued on a bonus DVD included in the 2005 remastered and expanded edition of the album. Later that year she performed Losing My Mind live at the Grammys ceremony before receiving a Grammy Legend Award (the first Grammy Legend Awards were issued in 1990 to Minnelli, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Smokey Robinson and Willie Nelson). With this award, she became one of only 12 other entertainers – in a list that includes Whoopi Goldberg, Barbra Streisand and Mel Brooks among others – to win an Emmy, Grammy, Tony Award and Academy Award.[9]\n\nIn April 1992, Minnelli appeared at the tribute concert to her late friend Freddie Mercury, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with the surviving members of the rock band Queen at Wembley Stadium, London.[10]\n\nIn 1996, Minnelli released a new studio album titled Gently. It was a recording of jazz standards and also included some contemporary songs such as the cover of Does He Love You which she performed as a duet with Donna Summer. This album brought her a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance. Minnelli was nominated in 2009 for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for her studio recording Liza's at the Palace...!, based on her hit Broadway show.\n\nIn May 2010, Playbill.com reported Minnelli would be releasing an album on the Decca Records label entitled Confessions, which was released on September 21, 2010.[11]\n\nIn 2006, Minnelli appeared on My Chemical Romance's album The Black Parade, providing backing vocals and singing a solo part with Gerard Way on the track \"Mama.\"\n\nFilm[]\n\nHer first appearance on film is as the baby in the very last shot of her mother's film, In the Good Old Summertime (1949). Her first credited film role was as the love-interest in Albert Finney's only film as director and star, Charlie Bubbles (1967), although four years later she did voice-over work for the animated film Journey Back to Oz, a sequel to the 1939 MGM film The Wizard of Oz. Minnelli was the voice of Dorothy (a character played in the earlier film by her mother Judy Garland) in what would have been her first major role had it been released as originally scheduled in 1964—the Filmation production took eight years to finish due to financial difficulties and would be ultimately be released between 1972 and 1974.\n\nIn 1969 she appeared in Alan J. Pakula's first feature film, The Sterile Cuckoo (1969), as “Pookie Adams”, a needy, eccentric teenager. Her performance won her her first Academy Award nomination. She played another eccentric character the following year in Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon, directed by Otto Preminger.\n\nIn 1972, Minnelli appeared in perhaps her best-known film role, as Sally Bowles in the movie version of Cabaret. She said that one of the things she did to prepare was to study photographs of classic actresses Louise Glaum and Louise Brooks and the dark-haired ladies of that time.[12] Minnelli won the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance, along with a Golden Globe Award.\n\nFollowing the success of Cabaret, Bob Fosse and Minnelli teamed up for Liza with a ‘Z’. A Concert for Television, a made-for-television special. The program aired two times on TV and was not seen again until a DVD release in 2006.\n\nMinnelli worked with her father in the 1976 A Matter of Time, co-starring Ingrid Bergman. After severe editing and cutting, done by the studio, with no input from Vincente, the film was neither a commercial nor a critical success Template:Citation needed . Her appearance opposite Robert De Niro in the 1977 musical drama film, New York, New York, however, gave Minnelli her best known signature song. Frank Sinatra released a successful cover version (for his Trilogy: Past Present Future album) two years later and used it as his signature song as well, sometimes even duetting with Minnelli live on stage.\n\nAfter her performance as leading woman to Dudley Moore in 1981's hit film Arthur, Minnelli made fewer film appearances although she returned to the big screen in 1988 for Arthur 2: On the Rocks and in 1991 for Stepping Out, a musical dramedy.\n\nMost recently she made an appearance in the movie Sex and the City 2 (2010) as herself.\n\nTelevision[]\n\nDuring the early days of television in the 1950s Minnelli appeared as a child guest on Art Linkletter's show and in 1959 sang and danced with Gene Kelly on his first television special. She was a guest star in one episode of the popular Ben Casey television series starring Vince Edwards and was a frequent guest on chat shows of the day including numerous appearances on shows hosted by Jack Paar, Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas, Joe Franklin, Dinah Shore and Johnny Carson. During the 1960s she made several guest appearances on Rowan & Martin's Laugh In as well as other variety shows including The Ed Sullivan Show, The Muppet Show, The Hollywood Palace, as well as The Judy Garland Show. In 1964 she appeared as Minnie in her first television dramatic role in the episode \"Nightingale for Sale\" on Craig Stevens's short-lived CBS series, Mr. Broadway.\n\nRecently, Minnelli has made guest appearances on such shows as Arrested Development, Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Drop Dead Diva. In the UK she has appeared on the Ruby Wax, Graham Norton and Jonathan Ross shows and in October 2006 participated in a comedy skit on the Charlotte Church Show and was featured on the Michael Parkinson Show. Set to be a guest judge on Australian Idol 2009 on the October 18, 2009. She appeared on The Joy Behar Show of September 1, 2010.\n\nIn November 2009, American Public Television aired \"Liza's at the Palace\", taped from September 30 – October 1, 2009 in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand's Hollywood Theatre.[13] The executive producers of the taping, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, previously were involved with the 2005 rerelease of 1972's Emmy and Peabody Award winning \"Liza with a 'Z'\".[14]\n\nIn 2013 she made guest appearance in the NBC series Smash. She sang a special song accompanied by character Tom to rising broadway star Ivy Lynn.\n\nLater career[]\n\nShe returned to Broadway in 1997, taking over the title role in the musical Victor/Victoria, replacing Julie Andrews. In his review, New York Times critic Ben Brantley commented, “her every stage appearance is perceived as a victory of show-business stamina over psychic frailty. She asks for love so nakedly and earnestly, it seems downright vicious not to respond.”Template:Citation needed\n\nIn 1995 Minnelli and long time collaborator Billy Stritch recorded a number of American standards \"unplugged\", and were coveted by many to be the Holy Grail of Minnelli's career, showing a sultrier and softer, more interpretive side to her artistry. The songs were later released in 2010, making the album \"Confessions\".\n\nAfter a serious case of viral encephalitis in 2000, doctors predicted that she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and would perhaps not even be able to speak again. However, she refused to accept this and with the help of vocal and dance lessons (most notably with Sam Harris, Ron Lewis, and Angela Bacari), which she still takes daily, managed to recover and returned to the stage in 2001 when asked by long-time friend Michael Jackson to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York City where she sang \"Never Never Land\" and the televised \"You Are Not Alone\" at the Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special concert produced by soon to be husband David Gest. Minnelli told reporters, \"I am stable as a table.\" Gest was so impressed with her stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in Liza's Back in spring 2002 performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. (Most noted in that tour was a tribute to her mother. After years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song, \"Over The Rainbow\", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's famous anthem, to an instant ovation.) Among performing her classic hits, other numbers unreleased in the album version included \"I Believe You\" by The Carpenters, a rap version of \"Liza With A 'Z'\", \"Yes\", and Mary J. Blige's \"Family Affair\", 2001.\n\nVH1 signed on Minnelli and Gest in 2002 to appear in a reality show entitled \"Liza & David\". The pilot episode was filmed following the couple around as they prepared for a party at their home, with a guest list including Ray Charles, Luther Vandross, Isaac Mizrahi, Anastacia, among many others. The show was cancelled shortly after the pilot episode was filmed due to a dispute between Gest and VH1, and never aired. Recordings of the pilot episode still exist.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005 she appeared as a recurring character on the critically acclaimed, Emmy Award-winning TV sitcom Arrested Development as “Lucille Austero”, the lover of both the sexually and socially awkward \"Buster\" Bluth and Buster's brother “GOB.”\n\nIn September 2006, she made a guest appearance on the long-running NBC drama Law & Order: Criminal Intent, in Masquerade, a Halloween-themed episode, broadcast on Tuesday, October 31, 2006.[15] She also completed guest vocals on My Chemical Romance's 2006 concept album The Black Parade, portraying “Mother War,” a dark conception of the main character's mother, in the song Mama.\n\nFor years, Minnelli had wanted to record a collection of songs that her godmother Kay Thompson had performed in her nightclub act.Template:Citation needed In 2007, she added some of Thompson's songs to her latest tour to introduce them to audiences.\n\nMinnelli returned to Broadway in a new solo concert at the Palace Theatre called Liza's at The Palace...! which ran from December 3, 2008, through January 4, 2009.[16][17] In her second act she performed a series of numbers created by Kay Thompson.[18] The reviews noted that while her voice was ragged at times, and her movements no longer elastic, the old magic was still very much present—from first to last, Minnelli had audiences cheering and applauding and begging for more. The show was subsequently staged at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on September 30 and October 1, 2009, at which time it was filmed for broadcast on public television and a February 2010 DVD and Blu-ray release.\n\nOn January 10, 2009, Minnelli made a rare live TV appearance in a surprise cameo on NBC's Saturday Night Live, playing the best friend of “Penelope” (Kristen Wiig). On January 26, 2009, she made an appearance on The View, singing \"I Would Never Leave You\" (written by Johnny Rodgers, Billy Stritch, and Brian Lane Green) from her new CD Liza's at The Palace...!. She was also interviewed by the cast of The View.\n\nShe was a character in the Australian musical The Boy from Oz starring Hugh Jackman. In the show's Broadway production, she was portrayed by Stephanie J. Block.\n\nIn October 2009, Minnelli toured Australia, and appeared on Australian Idol as a mentor and guest judge.\n\nIn February 2010, Minnelli appeared in a Snickers commercial along with Aretha Franklin and Betty White. Minnelli made a cameo appearance in the May 2010 release of Sex and the City 2, in which she covered Beyoncé's hit Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) and Cole Porter's Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye. She also made a starring appearance in December 2010 in NBC's The Apprentice.\n\nOn 14 June 2012 Liza headlined at Hampton Court Palace Festival, an annual event which takes place at Hampton Court Palace in Surrey, England.\n\nIn 2013, Liza returned as \"Lucille Austero\" for season 4 of Arrested Development.\n\nOn May 9, 2014, Minnelli had a guest appearance on Cher's Dressed to Kill Tour in Brooklyn, performing \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" alongside Cyndi Lauper and Rosie O'Donnell.[19]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nMinnelli speaks fluent French.\n\nMinnelli has long suffered from alcoholism, and has been addicted to prescription drugs, originating from a Valium prescription after her mother's death.[20] Minnelli left her 1984 musical The Rink to enter the Betty Ford Clinic.[21] Her use of recreational drugs in the 1970s was noted by Andy Warhol, who in a 1978 diary entry recalled Minnelli arriving at Halston's house and imploring the host to \"Give me every drug you've got.\"[20][22] Along with Warhol and Bianca Jagger, Minnelli made frequent appearances at New York City nightclubs during the late 1970s.\n\nMarriages[]\n\nMinnelli has been married (and divorced) four times.\n\nHer first marriage was to Peter Allen (full name Peter Richard Woolnough) on March 3, 1967.[23] Australian-born Allen was Judy Garland's protégé in the mid-1960s.[24] They divorced on July 24, 1974.[25] About her marriage to Peter Allen, Minnelli told The Advocate's Editor In Chief, Judy Wieder in September 1996, \"I married Peter and he didn't tell me he was gay. Everyone knew but me. And I found out...well, let me put it this way: I'll never surprise anybody coming home as long as I live. I call first!\" [26]\n\nLater that year, she married Jack Haley, Jr., a producer and director, on September 15, 1974.[27] His father, Jack Haley, was Garland's co-star in The Wizard of Oz. They divorced in April 1979.[28]\n\nMinnelli was married to Mark Gero, a sculptor and stage manager, from December 4, 1979 until their divorce in January 1992.[29]\n\nShe was married to David Gest, a concert promoter, from March 16, 2002, until they divorced in April 2007. (They separated in July 2003.)[30][31] In a 2003 lawsuit Gest alleged that Minnelli beat him in alcohol induced rages during their marriage.[32] Minnelli's attorneys said Gest tried to isolate the singer from her three siblings- Christiane Minnelli, Lorna and Joey Luft, and evict her step-mother Lee Anderson Minnelli from one of Minnelli's properties.\n\nMinnelli also had relationships with Rock Brynner, Desi Arnaz, Jr., Peter Sellers, and Martin Scorsese.[33][34]\n\nMinnelli has no children; one pregnancy left her with a hiatal hernia as a result of the medical steps taken to try to save the baby.[6]\n\nPhilanthropy[]\n\nMinnelli has, throughout her lifetime, served various charities and causes which she considers very important. She served on the board of directors of The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP) for 20 years, a nonprofit educational organization that introduces parents to the field of child brain development. In a 2006 interview with Randy Rice at Broadwayworld.com Minnelli said that she was the person who told Elizabeth Taylor about HIV/AIDS while talking about their mutual friend, Rock Hudson.[35] She has also dedicated much time to amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, which was co-founded by Taylor. In 2007, she stated in an interview with Palm Springs Life magazine, “AmfAR is important to me because I’ve lost so many friends that I knew [to AIDS]”.[36] In 1994, she recorded the Kander & Ebb tune \"The Day After That\" and donated the proceeds to AIDS research. That same year she performed the song in front of thousands in Central Park at the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nCinema[]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1949 In the Good Old Summertime Baby uncredited 1954 The Long, Long Trailer Wedding Guest scenes deleted 1967 Charlie Bubbles Eliza 1969 The Sterile Cuckoo 'Pookie' (Mary Ann) Adams David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actress\n\nKansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress\n\nMar del Plata Film Festival Award for Best Actress\n\nNominated — Academy Award for Best Actress\n\nNominated — BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles\n\nNominated — Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama 1970 Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon Junie Moon 1972 Cabaret Sally Bowles Academy Award for Best Actress\n\nBAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role\n\nDavid di Donatello for Best Foreign Actress\n\nGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\n\nSant Jordi Award for Best Performance in a Foreign Film 1974 Just One More Time Herself uncredited (short subject) That's Entertainment!
