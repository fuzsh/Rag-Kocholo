        "text": "Entertainer, producer, reality TV star, friend of Michael and Tito.\n\nDavid Gest, who was found dead in a London hotel Tuesday, was known as a lot of things. But as the BBC rightly pointed out, the 62-year-old impresario was “perhaps best known” for being the one-time husband of Liza Minnelli.\n\nGest and Minnelli began their made-for-the-tabloids marriage in 2002. It lasted just 16 months, though the two officially didn’t divorce until 2007.\n\nDuring their time as a curious media couple, they presented the world with the weird spectacle of their celebrity-strewn wedding, which featured Michael Jackson as best man and Elizabeth Taylor as matron of honor.\n\nTheir break-up came with sensational rumors of his-and-her plastic surgery, as well accusations of domestic violence, drug abuse and money grubbing.\n\nHere are top moments of their fabulous, scandalous life together.\n\nStar-crossed back stories: Minnelli was the daughter of tragic Hollywood icon Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli. Since winning her Best Actress Oscar for “Cabaret” in 1972, she had endured various career setbacks, alcoholism, two hip replacements and three marriages — the first of which ended when Minnelli learned the man was gay.\n\nLos Angeles native Gest was a childhood friend of Michael Jackson and his brother Tito, and achieved his greatest professional feat when he produced what People called the highest-rated musical TV special in history: “Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration.”\n\nMeet cute: Gest and Minnelli first became acquainted in the 1980s at a Frank Sinatra concert. They encountered each other again in June 2001, and Gest said he was immediately smitten, according to People. By December 2001, Gest proposed with a 3.5-carat Tiffany diamond ring. “I could see that there was a little girl who needed to be loved,” he told People. “I fell for her right away.”\n\nThe big day: The March 16, 2002 wedding took place at Manhattan’s Marble Collegiate Church, with more than 500 guests who included a mix of old Hollywood prima donnas, new money pop stars and general hangers-on, the Daily Mail reported. Minnelli, then 56, wore an ivory white Bob Mackie gown.\n\nThe 36-member wedding party consisted of the Jackson Five as groomsmen. Both Taylor and Michael Jackson arrived late to do their matron of honor/best man duties. Whitney Houston was supposed to sing at the ceremony but pulled out at the last minute and was replaced by Natalie Cole who sang — what else? — her late father Nat King Cole’s hit “Unforgettable.”\n\nA memorable moment came after a minister pronounced Gest and Minnelli husband and wife. They kissed for a full two minutes, with guest Joy Behar quipping that it looked like he was sucking “her lips right out of her face!”\n\nGround Zero reception locale: The reception took place at a hotel near the site of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The idea was to celebrate New York’s capacity for survival after tragedy — perhaps a metaphor for Minnelli’s own storied life?\n\nOther guests included Hollywood veterans Mickey Rooney, Kirk Douglas, Janet Leigh, Joan Collins, Esther Williams and Jane Russell as well as more contemporary stars, such as Sporty Spice Mel C, Queen guiatarist Brian May, Liam Neeson, Natasha Richardson, Anthony Hopkins and Mia Farrow.\n\nThe couple were reportedly paid 500,000 British pounds by OK! magazine for rights to cover the wedding. The couple told OK! that they planned to adopt four children. “Liza is going to be the greatest mother you have ever met,” Gest said.\n\nThank goodness, no kids: The union lasted a little over the year. Reports emerged that the couple postponed their first anniversary so Minnelli could go back to rehab.\n\nMinnelli also reportedly rebelled early on at her husband’s attempts to control her with a diet and to push her back onto the international concert circuit.\n\nThe mud-slinging: Starting in 2003, Gest began airing plenty of dirty laundry in court papers. He sued Minnelli for $10 million, claiming he feared he had been infected by her with herpes. He also accused her of drunken rages and domestic violence. She sued back for $2 million, saying he had failed her as a manager.\n\nThe aftermath: Gest’s suit was thrown out, but the exes didn’t settle their divorce until 2007.\n\nMinnelli got back to work, doing solo shows on Broadway and in Las Vegas, and doing guest turns on TV, including the critically acclaimed “Arrested Development.” She’s also devoted time to The Foundation for AIDS Research, which was co-founded by her friend Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nGest found fame on British reality TV, appearing on “I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!” This past year, he appeared on the U.K.’s “Celebrity Big Brother,” during which there was a mix-up when a fellow housemate mistakenly thought Gest — who was sick in bed — had died after hearing the news of David Bowie’s death.\n\nGest ended up leaving the show early, due to medical concerns.\n\nThe “Big Brother” mix up inspired the title of Gest’s final project, a tour set to kick off July 1, called “David Gest Is Not Dead But Alive With Soul.”"
