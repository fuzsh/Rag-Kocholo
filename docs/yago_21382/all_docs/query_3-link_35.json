        "text": "Liza Minnelli and her mother, Judy Garland, are among the most adored musical and silver screen figures in American history. Although Garland propelled young Liza into show business when she was just a toddler, Minnelli became a huge star in her own right, racking up awards throughout all tiers of the entertainment community over the course of her career, including winning her first Tony when she was still a teenager.\n\nBorn in 1946 to her famous mother and film director father, Vincente Minnelli, Liza's first stint in show business was on the stage. At the age of 19, she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance in Flora the Red Menace, making her the youngest actress to ever receive the award. She continued to perform in off-Broadway shows and nightclubs, until 1972 – the 26-year-old then cemented her place in musical history with Cabaret, the sensual, Bob Fosse-directed film about 1930s-era Berlin.\n\nBut, like her mother, Liza’s life was filled with hardships, tragedy, and devastating substance abuse. In addition to the decades-long pressure she faced to maintain her personal appearance, she spent multiple stints in rehab for addiction, and her personal relationships with men have publicly unraveled in humiliating ways. Liza Minnelli and David Gest’s relationship, in particular, became tabloid fodder and painted the actress as a mere caricature of her former self."
