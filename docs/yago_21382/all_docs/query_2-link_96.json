        "text": "David Gest\n\nProducer David Gest arrives for the European Premiere of \"Michael Jackson: The Life Of An Icon,\" at a central London cinema, Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2011.\n\n(Joel Ryan | Invision | AP)\n\nFamed TV producer David Gest has died according to multiple reports. He was 62.\n\nTMZ says Gest, an ex-husband of Liza Minnelli, was found dead Tuesday in the Four Seasons Hotel at the Canary Wharf in London. An autopsy will be performed to determine a cause of death, but police say circumstances appear to be \"non suspicious.\"\n\nGest was married to Minelli from 2002 to 2007. He famously sued the legendary singer-actress for $10 million, accusing her of physical abuse during their relationship.\n\nGest was a close friend of Michael Jackson and worked as a music and television producer for the 2001 TV special \"Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration: The Solo Years\" and the posthumous film, \"Michael Jackson: The Life Of An Icon.\" Gest also appeared on reality shows, including \"I'm a Celebrity\" and \"Celebrity Big Brother.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles native left the British edition of \"Celebrity Big Brother\" after just 13 days earlier this year due to illness. During his time on the show, Central New York native Tiffany \"New York\" Pollard had a breakdown when fellow cast member Angie Bowie, David Bowie's ex-wife, told her \"David\" had died on January 10.\n\nShe ran around the house in hysterics before finding Gest in his bed.\n\n\"David, she just told me that you're dead!\" Pollard exclaimed. \"Why the f--- would she say that?\"\n\nPollard, a graduate of Thomas R. Proctor High School in Utica, thought Angie was talking about Gest but it was singer David Bowie who had died. The former \"I Love New York\" and \"Flavor of Love\" star later apologized, explaining that she didn't think cast members could learn about outside news during filming, but producers made an exception due to Bowie's relationship.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports the controversy inspired Gest to have fun with it, booking a \"David Gest Is Not Dead But Alive With Soul\" tour of UK theaters beginning in July. Scheduled performers included Dina Carroll, The Stylistics lead singer Russell Allen Thompkins Jr., Deniece Williams (\"Let's Hear It for the Boy\"), Rose Royce (\"Car Wash\") and Peabo Bryson (\"A Whole New World\").\n\nPollard herself also tried to capitalize on the moment by selling \"David is dead\" t-shirts. Her management announced Tuesday that they are being pulled from her fashion line, though Pollard was not yet aware of Gest's death.\n\nScotland Yard spokesman said next of kin are in the process of being notified about Gest's death.\n\nHis granddaughter, actress Stephanie Davis, said on Twitter she was \"gutted\" by her the death of her \"granddad.\""
