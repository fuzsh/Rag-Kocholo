        "text": "The sad news just broke that David Gest, the ex-husband of Liza Minnelli, passed away earlier today in London. And while the 62-year-old was becoming quite the familiar face on the reality TV circuit, Gest was probably best known for the marriage between him and the famously flamboyant Liza Minnelli. While his friends and family mourn his passing, we’re taking a look back at what first forced the reality star into the spotlight — the over-the-top, insane wedding between Liza Minnelli and David Gest.\n\nWhen we say, insane, we mean insane. Before Kim and Kanye, there was Liza and David. For her fourth wedding, Minnelli pulled out all the stops with a lavish affair that toted an 850-person guest list, crazy tabloid coverage, and an oh-so-chic Fifth Avenue venue. Oh, and Michael Jackson as best man. See? Told you it was insane…\n\nBefore Gest was starring on Celebrity Big Brother, he tied the knot with Minnelli back in 2002 at New York City’s Marble Collegiate Church. The bridal party was nothing short of a hodge-podge of celebs, with Elizabeth Taylor serving as maid of honor and the King of Pop as best man. “Even the stars were craning their necks,” says John Barrett, Minnelli’s hairstylist for the epic event, who gave the bride her inspired ‘do, according to People. With Diana Ross, Mickey Rooney, Elton John, Barbara Walters, the Doobie Brothers, Anthony Hopkins, Joan Collins, and Mia Farrow all on the guest list, we could certainly see why!\n\nSee More: 131 Iconic Celebrity Brides\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nThe bedazzled bride made her way down the aisle in an ivory crepe Bob Mackie, which Minnelli later covered up with a floor length white mink coat on her way to her reception at the Regent Hotel, where Natalie Cole crooned her father’s iconic song “Unforgettable” to the newlyweds. But the most unforgettable part of the whole affair? The couple’s first kiss! Just as over-the-top as the wedding itself, no could stop talking about Minnelli and Gest’s just-wedded lip-lock. “He sucked her lips right out of her face!” remembers Joy Behar. Even Donald Trump found the need to comment. (When does he not?) “I have been to many weddings,” he said. “And I have never seen a kiss like that before.”\n\n14 years later and, we must say, we’ve never seen a wedding like that, either! (Sorry, Kimye…)\n\nSource: Bride"
