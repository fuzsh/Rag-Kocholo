Although their marriage was volatile and ended badly, he loved her.\n\n“But he said his memory had gone because of clashes in their relationship and being struck on the head by Liza’s stiletto.\"\n\nRead more:David Gest ‘suffered memory loss before his death which he blamed on Liza Minnelli\n\nA spokesman for Minnelli, 70, refuted the claims saying: \"There is no truth to the report whatsoever.\"\n\nTheir four year marriage was plagued with volatility.\n\nGest openly accused Minnelli of attacking him on a number of occasions in the past, including an alleged incident in 2003 while they were staying at London's Connaught Hotel.\n\nLegal papers claimed she \"began beating [Gest] about the head and face with her fists without relenting. Alcohol gave her remarkable force and strength.\"\n\nThe actress always denied the claims.\n\nDuring Adams withering piece she attacked Gest several times at point saying he “wore more mascara than I did”."
