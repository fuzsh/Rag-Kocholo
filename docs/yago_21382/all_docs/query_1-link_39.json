An autopsy will take place in an attempt to determine the cause of death.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police force said officers were called to “reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s” at the Four Seasons Hotel in London’s Canary Wharf on Tuesday morning.\n\nGest was a longtime friend of the late Michael Jackson and produced a documentary about the King of Pop. The Los Angeles-born Gest emerged as a big star in Britain with appearances on reality TV shows including “Celebrity Big Brother” and “I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!”\n\nFriends, fans and musicians are paying tribute across Twitter:"
