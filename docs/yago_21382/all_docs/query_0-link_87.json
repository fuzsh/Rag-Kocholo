When I got an invitation to Donald Trump’s 1993 wedding, to Marla Maples, I was eager to learn the difference between regular weddings and celebrity weddings.\n\nThere I was at the Plaza Hotel, along with Rosie O’Donnell and O. J. Simpson, among other notable and/or notorious guests. I had always thought that weddings were supposed to be for close friends and family, but I soon learned that celebrity weddings are more about getting pictures into People magazine than about tearful moments to be cherished throughout the marriage."
