David Gest, the former husband of singer Liza Minnelli, has been found dead in a London hotel. He was 62.

The Reality TV star was married to Minnelli from 2002 until 2003. An autopsy will take place in an attempt to determine the cause of death.

The Metropolitan Police force said officers were called to “reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s” at the Four Seasons Hotel in London’s Canary Wharf on Tuesday morning.

Gest was a longtime friend of the late Michael Jackson and produced a documentary about the King of Pop. The Los Angeles-born Gest emerged as a big star in Britain with appearances on reality TV shows including “Celebrity Big Brother” and “I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!”
