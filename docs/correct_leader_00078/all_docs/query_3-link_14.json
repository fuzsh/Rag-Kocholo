        "text": "11 May 2023\n\nBy James Gregory , BBC News\n\nFinland's outgoing Prime Minister Sanna Marin and her husband Markus Raikkonen have filed for divorce.\n\n\"We are grateful for the 19 years together and our beloved daughter,\" Ms Marin said on Instagram on Wednesday.\n\nThe couple married in 2020, when Ms Marin was leading the country's pandemic response, and they share a five-year-old daughter.\n\nShe is due to leave office after her centre-left party lost the general election last month.\n\nIn a story posted on her Instagram account, Ms Marin said she is \"still best friends\" with Mr Raikkonen, who is a businessman and former professional footballer.\n\n\"We will continue to spend time together as a family and with each other,\" she added.\n\nMs Marin, 37, became the world's youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019. But she lost out in a tight race to the National Coalition Party, headed by Petteri Orpo, and the right-wing populist Finns Party, led by Riikka Purra, in April.\n\nIt was a bitter defeat for Ms Marin. While she increased her party's seats and secured 19.9% of the vote, her coalition partners all lost significant numbers of seats.\n\nHer government has formally resigned but will continue serving on a caretaker basis until the formation and appointment of a new government. Mr Orpo has said he hopes to conclude negotiations by June.\n\nMs Marin has enjoyed high polling throughout her time in office, with many praising her for steering Finland into Nato and navigating her country through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut she is also a polarising figure in Finland, with headlines pertaining to her personal life surfacing in recent months.\n\nShe has frequently been a target for criticism for her apparent love of partying - most notably when a video of her at a party singing, dancing and drinking circulated on social media in August 2022.\n\nAt the time, Ms Marin said the video had been filmed on \"private premises\" and that she had spent \"an evening with friends\".\n\nBut the video prompted dozens of complaints alleging Ms Marin's behaviour undermined Finland's \"reputation and security\".\n\nShe took a drugs test, which proved negative, to allay concerns about her behaviour and was cleared of misconduct by parliament a few months later."
