        "text": "At work, Finns typically enjoy lunch and coffee breaks with colleagues, and some offices even have organized sports teams or hobby clubs. And while Finns are hard workers while on the job, most draw a firm line between work and life: once they leave the office, the workday is over.\n\nFurthermore, taking time off for rest or a well-deserved vacation isn’t just expected – it’s encouraged. Typically, employees have four to six weeks of vacation per year, and many use their vacation time to take long breaks during the summer months. There are also numerous workplace holidays. Finally, even though religion doesn’t play a central role in the lives of most Finns, many bank holidays reflect the Christian calendar, so you can expect to have days off around Christmas and Easter.\n\nFinns are efficient: they follow schedules, meet deadlines, and plan ahead – and they expect others to do the same. They also take words at face-value. If you say you’ll do something by a given time, people expect you to do it.\n\nAt work, employers trust employees to put forth their best effort and expect people to complete projects correctly and on-time. If the job gets done and the quality is sufficient, managers usually remain hands-off and let the work speak for itself. And if a workplace issue crops up, it helps to remember that Finns are pragmatic problem-solvers. Talk to your team or manager, and they will help you address the issue. In Finland, it’s OK to ask for help.\n\nIn Finland, learning never stops. Finns heavily invest in education, and skills development is an important part of policy-making. Further information on Finland's higher education and wide range of study programs in English can be found at Study In Finland.\n\nThe spirit of life-long learning is also embraced in the workplace. According to studies, Finland actually offers the best opportunities in Europe for employees who want to develop their professional skills at work.\n\nIt is common for people who are already in the workforce to continuously acquire and learn new skills. One of the places to find e-learning courses is Microsoft Skills for Jobs, a program that offers a gateway to becoming a competent technology professional and the opportunity to progress in your career. Tens of thousands of job opportunities open up for technology professionals each year. Whether you are interested in enhancing your technical skills or staying updated on the latest industry trends, Microsoft Skills for Jobs offers a variety of courses to assist you in reaching your goals.\n\nFinns like rules and tend to follow them. In a Finnish meeting, for example, expect a clear agenda that gets straight to the point and mutual agreement on an approach or solution to address any issues.\n\nThis penchant for structure is also reflected in Finnish laws, rules, and regulations – for both employers and employees. Various legislation and collective agreements determine things like minimum wage, working hours, holidays, sick pay, and terms of dismissal, as Finns believe having clearly defined standards for everyone levels the playing field.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination of any kind is not tolerated in the workplace: Finland’s constitution guarantees equal treatment regardless of race, religion, gender identity, and more. So, while diversity and inclusion efforts are still a work in progress, employees of all backgrounds, beliefs, and ethnicities are legally entitled to work in a fair and supportive environment."
