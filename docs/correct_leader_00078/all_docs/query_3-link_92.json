        "text": "History\n\nSanta Claus and his elves first opened the doors to welcome visitors in 1992. Since then, Santa Claus Office has been open every single day of the year, over 30 years already.\n\nNowadays, hundreds of thousands of visitors of all ages, from every corner of the globe, come to chat with the world’s most pleasant man at the Santa Claus Office.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Arctic Circle has always been the gateway to the northernmost part of Finland and Europe – the Gateway to Lapland. The Arctic Circle has also worked as a gateway to the timeless world of stories and tales, of which Santa Claus Office is a prime example.\n\nSanta Claus has lived in Lapland for as long as he can remember, so when he decided, with the help of the elves, to build a meeting place for all fans of Christmas, the Arctic Circle was a natural location.\n\nRovaniemi, the capital of Lapland, lies in the Arctic Circle zone. The townspeople were extremely overjoyed in welcoming the ambassador of goodwill to their town, and so Rovaniemi became the Official Hometown of Santa Claus in 2010.\n\nHow to recognize Santa Claus Office?\n\nSanta Claus Office is situated in the middle of Santa Claus Village, next to the main square. It is a big building with a tower, in the same building you find Finnish design shops Iittala, Marimekko and Pentik.\n\nSanta’s Office is open every day of the year, free of charge. Here you will be greeted by Santa’s friendly helpers, Santa Claus Office’s elves.\n\nSanta Claus Office is much more than just a meeting place with Santa. The building hides inside also other Christmas secrets.\n\nElf Doors\n\nAlong the way you may run into elf doors that unfortunately cannot be opened. The doors stay closed so that no one can disturb the elves at work. However, if you’re curious, you can get a glimpse of the elves’ work by peeking in through the keyhole.\n\nGift Warehouse\n\nOnce you enter Santa Claus Office, you will pass through one of the gift warehouses. Each year Santa delivers Christmas presents for many many maaany people. The amount of the presents is so huge, that the gift warehouse that we have here is just one of many.\n\nThe Earth’s Rotational Speed Regulator (Santa’s Time Machine)\n\nHave you noticed that during Christmas, time seems to be running slowly? Well that’s because the day actually is longer than others. With the help of the device located in Santa’s Office, Santa can slow down the rotation speed of the earth, which slows down time, and Santa has time to visit everyone who is waiting for him.\n\nWall of Fame\n\nOver the years, Santa Claus Office has been visited by numerous guests from all over the world. We have had the pleasure to meet e.g. presidents of different countries, athletes, musicians and actors. When you visit us, you can test whether you recognize any of these guests.\n\nThe meeting with Santa\n\nEveryone is more than welcome to visit Santa Claus; whether you are young or old, human or animal. Santa welcomes everybody with open arms. Our photographer-elf takes photos of all the visitors to our elf album. You can purchase the photos afterwards, if you want.\n\nSanta Claus Office Gift Shop\n\nHere you can also find our Santa Claus Office Gift Shop. From our collection you can find something soft, something useful, something meaningful and a lot of elf spirit. We also have online shop, where you can find all the same items as in our shop. We ship worldwide!\n\nYou can follow our adventures all year round also on social media, Instagram especially.\n\nWe, Elves and Santa Claus, hope to see you here at the Arctic Circle soon!"
