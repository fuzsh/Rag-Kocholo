        "text": "Nov. 16 - 19, 2023\n\nby Kate Hamill, adapted from the novel by Louisa May Alcott\n\n\"You can be lonely in a crowd, if it's not the right crowd,\" says Jo in this sparkling stage version of Louisa May Alcott's beloved novel about the March sisters. Playwright Kate Hamill (The Wall Street Journal 2021 Playwright of the Year) honors the spirit of Alcott's original story while freshly interpreting it for a new era. This adaptation will have audiences falling in love with Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy all over again as they grow from young girls to little women."
