        "text": "AFRY in Finland\n\nAFRY’s strong roots in Finland stretch back to 1958, when Pöyry was established. During the following decades, Pöyry became one of the world’s largest independent engineering and consulting companies in the forest industry, and a significant global player in other sectors such as energy, infrastructure and environment. In 2019, the Swedish company ÅF acquired Pöyry, and together they formed one combined company, AFRY.\n\nToday, AFRY Finland are present in 29 locations and have 2,800 experts based throughout Finland. We help our clients in the energy, infrastructure and process industries with their digitalisation and sustainability efforts. Our solutions respond to the global trends such as digitalisation, urbanisation, the energy transition and the growth of the bioeconomy.\n\nWe support our clients through the whole project life cycle: from strategies and feasibility studies to technical consulting; from basic to detailed engineering; and from project management to operations and maintenance. Our projects also vary from small engineering assignments to large investment projects."
