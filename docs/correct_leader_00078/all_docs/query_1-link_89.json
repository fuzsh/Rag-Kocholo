Ten years ago, a fellow entrepreneur pitched his idea about an app to capture feedback from an audience and show the results on screen in real-time. Perfect when doing an on-stage seminar, for instance. These words came out of my mouth: üí° ‚ÄúBrilliant idea!‚Äù ‚è∏ ‚Äú...but, is this all?‚Äù ‚ùì‚Äú...are you thinking of building a company on top of this?‚Äù üíî ‚Äú...that‚Äôs sweet, but it can‚Äôt become a real company...‚Äù Fast-forward 10 years and Johnny‚Äôs company Mentimeter is an outstanding success with a profitable business model, hundreds of excited employees, a culture to envy, and millions of users worldwide. Recently, I met Johnny in their cool HQ office. I was so embarrassed about my sucky feedback ten years ago. I apologized and congratulated him on their great success. Fantastic work, Johnny Warstr√∂m & Mentimeter - you rock! ü§òüèº Learning: Simple is good. Culture is key. Believe in your ideas! And don't listen to stupid advice :) Do you have a similar story to share? #entrepreneurship #successstory"
