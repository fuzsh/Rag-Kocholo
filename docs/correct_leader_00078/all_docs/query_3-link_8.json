Before serving as prime minister, he held three different positions as a member of two governments, including minister of Agriculture and Forestry, minister of the Interior, and minister of Finance. He was elected leader of the National Coalition Party at the party conference in the summer of 2016.\n\n(L-R) Chairs of the Finnish Christian Democrats, the Finns Party, the National Coalition Party, and the Swedish People's Party, which constitute the new coalition government of Finland, pose for a photo during a press conference in Helsinki, Finland, June 16, 2023.

The Orpo government also outlined the government program to Parliament. â– "
