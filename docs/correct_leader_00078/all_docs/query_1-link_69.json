The Donald M. Payne International Development Graduate Fellowship seeks to prepare young people for careers in international development as Foreign Service Officers in the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Payne Fellowship Program provides benefits of up to $90,000 over two years toward a two-year master's degree, arranges internships on Capitol Hill and at USAID missions overseas, and provides professional development and support activities leading to employment in USAID. Fellows may use the fellowship to attend a two-year master's program in a U.S. institution to study an area of relevance to the USAID Foreign Service, including international relations, public policy, business administration, foreign languages, economics, agriculture, environmental sciences, health, or urban planning at a graduate or professional school approved by the Payne Program. At the end of the two-year fellowship, Fellows enter the USAID Foreign Service. Applicants must be college seniors or graduates looking to start graduate school in the fall of the year they apply, have GPAs of at least 3.2 and be U.S. citizens. The program welcomes applications from those with any undergraduate major. Information and application materials for the program is at www.paynefellows.org. The application deadline is January 23, 2013. The Program is funded by USAID and managed by Howard University.\n\nThe Donald M. Payne International Development Fellowship Program\n\nRalph J. Bunche International Affairs Center\n\nHoward University\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nFaculty member of the month:\n\nDr. Roy Haggerty, Department of Geosciences.\n\nDr. Roy Haggerty came to Oregon State University in 1996 after receiving his PhD from Stanford University. When he's not in the classroom teaching hydrogeology, or in his office advising students, you might find him out in a streambed in chest-waders; teaching a laboratory section of Geology students to measure stream velocity and calculate discharge. Or, he could be conducting tracer tests to study the exchange of water and solutes between the surface and sub-surface zones of streams, or even helping his graduate students to install wells at the H.J. Andrews Long Term Ecological Research site.\n\nDr. Haggerty is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geosciences, and served as the first Associate Director for the Water Resources Science degree program in the Water Resources Graduate Program. He and his students have studied the exchange of water between streams and the shallow subsurface (the hyporheic zone), nitrate transport through sediments below agricultural lands in Oregon, groundwater flow modeling, and the physics of solute transport in highly heterogeneous materials. Student research projects have included studying the role of groundwater in geologic processes, nuclear waste disposal, mathematical modeling of solute transport, and stream turbidity. Recent funding for research has come from the USGS, Dept. of Energy, National Science Foundation, Sandia National Laboratories, and state agencies in Oregon.\n\n\"Roy is a quiet but effective leader in water-related research and education.\" said Dr. Mary Santelmann, Director of the Water Resources Graduate Program. \"His experience and guidance as Associate Director for the Water Resources Science degree program has been invaluable in establishing a strong program that meets the needs of the students.\"\n\nRoy is also an active advocate for OSU and for water-related research within and beyond the halls of the University. Haggerty and colleagues Denise Lach, Stan Gregory, and John Bolte recently led a team of about 40 OSU faculty members in the successful development of the Water and Watersheds Initiative that established the new Institute for Water and Watersheds, and brought Michael Campana to Oregon State University as its first Director.\n\nIn 2006-2007, Roy Haggerty will be on sabbatical in Spain. We expect that he'll return with a great tan and his characteristic enthusiasm in fall of 2007.\n\nNews & Events - News Archive\n\nRead about current activities of the OSU water resources community in H2OSU, the newsletter of the Institute for Water and Watersheds.\n\nOctober 19, 2012\n\nNo Wars for Water: Why Climate Change Has Not Led to Conflict\n\nAaron Wolf, professor of geography in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at OSU, co-authored this piece.\n\nOctober 11, 2012\n\nProfessor Aaron Wolf featured in new book, \"Ecoliterate\"\n\nOregon State University professor of geography Aaron Wolf, recognized for his work in mediating water disputes around the world, is featured in the new book, Ecoliterate, which tells stories of activists, educators, and young people from across the nation who are creatively addressing issues related to coal, oil, food, and water.\n\nMay 18, 2012\n\nWater Research Symposium\n\nCongratulations to the Hydrophiles student organization on an excellent Water Research Symposium Friday, May 18th in the Memorial Union.\n\nThe day was filled with excellent presentations and opportunities to network, and the poster session from 5 to 6 pm was also well-attended and well-provisioned by the Institute for Water and Watersheds.\n\nWe want to recognize the efforts of Hydrophiles officers Kim Ogren, Luke Pangle, Patrick Burns, Racquel Rancier, Kelly Foley, and many others whose efforts made this event such a rewarding way to spend a Friday!
