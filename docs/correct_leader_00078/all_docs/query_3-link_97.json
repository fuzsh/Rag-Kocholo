        "text": "Finland is the home of Max Payne and Alan Wake, but also the origin of Angry Birds, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale.\n\nPopulation of Finland is 5.5 million. Capital city of Helsinki holds 616.690, capital region totals at 1.6 million. The high quality of life in Finland comes at a cost, but itâs still more affordable than e.g. Denmark, UK or France.\n\nDays start getting shorter at the end of June, nightless nights turn into polar nights with snowfall making them brighter.\n\nHelsinki has mild summers around 15Â°C with heatwaves going up to 30Â°C, winters around -4Â°C with occasional drops to -15Â°C.\n\nFinnish is considered the second most difficult language in the world! But donât worry, Finns speak excellent English.\n\nFinland beat its eternal rival Sweden in Menâs World Ice Hockey Championships 4â1 on their home turf back in 1995.\n\nRead more facts at Visit Finland or latest news from Yle News.\n\nSAUNA is an essential part of life in Finland â itâs not a myth! Flats often have their own sauna or a shared one in the apartment building. You can also enjoy an after-work sauna at the office: Remedy has two saunas at your disposal.\n\nCUISINE in Finland is comparably basic but delicious, containing root vegetables, fish, game, berries, mushrooms, wholesome breads and tasty pastries.

Originally launched at the Olympic Games in 1952, this long drink has since become an option on tap in every bar next to beers and ciders. Did you know that we also have the worldâs best G&T gin Napue?\n\nDRESSING yourself right is important â and we donât mean suits and ties! Winters get bitterly cold but the climate is quite dry, so when you dress right, youâre ready to go. Get some good gloves, warm shoes and a beanie as your basic winter uniform. Thereâs a great layering guide for Finnish winters.\n\nSTORES in Finland are open daily, even on Sundays. There are only a few public holidays that affect opening hours, but cities have several 24/7 stores where you can get anything 365 days a year.\n\nFINNS are a quieter folk in general, some say they take some time to warm up to you â but thatâs what sauna is for. If you want to learn about what terrifies the Finns, check out Finnish Nightmares and Very Finnish Problems. Crime rate is low in Helsinki and Finland in general. Itâs safe to walk the streets by night, and quite many leave their houses unlocked in the countryside.\n\nINTERNET is reliable, affordable and fast â both mobile and broadband. A phone contract with unlimited data at 50 Mb/s starts from about 15 â¬ per month. The use of mobile data is the highest in the world.\n\nBIGÂ EVENTS like Nordic Business Forum and Slush have shaped Helsinki as the hub for the tech and start-up scene in Europe (or maybe even the world). There are several reasons why Helsinki brings the best business together.\n\nMETRO connects Remedyâs studio with the rest of the greater Helsinki area. Getting around in the capital is easy and its extensive public transportation network is reliable. Almost everything in downtown Helsinki is within a walking distance.\n\nCITYÂ BIKES are affordable and available from May to October. Helsinki is very biker friendly. The majority of the population uses public transportation to get to work. Whether sitting on a bus, train or tram, Finns usually enjoy silence and personal space. No small talk required!\n\nCARS arenât a necessity as traveling around Finland is easy in general. On the other hand car and gasoline expenses are quite high. Car rental services such as DriveNow and Hertz are available if you want to venture to the countryside outside the public transportation network.\n\nAIRPORT at Helsinki-Vantaa is the hub for countless international destinations with great direct connections. Helsinki is a 2â3 hour flight away from most European hotspots such as London, Paris and Berlin. The city is also a key connector to Asia as itâs the shortest way from northern Europe.\n\nWORKÂ HARD,Â PLAYÂ HARDER. Finns are diligent and disciplined, but life outside of work is of great importance. Here we value long vacations and nothing feels better than coming back from a well-deserved break. You get a day off for moving, and paid holidays for up to 5 weeks a year. Taking time out and looking after yourself is just as important as doing a great job.\n\nSTANDARDÂ WORKDAY is 8 hours and flextime is a common practice, meaning that you can check in to the studio between 7 am and 10 pm. Standard holiday accumulation is 25 days per year, and in addition we have 13 national public holidays. You also get a day off for moving. All holidays are paid.\n\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT and CULTURE are unique with a low hierarchy in management and a big focus on employee wellbeing. For example sick leaves are not deducted from holidays. Finns tend to be quiet and workplaces rarely feature shouting matches, but thatâs not to say Finns are not passionate.\n\nAFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION in the greater Helsinki area is available at Aalto University, Helsinki University and universities of applied sciences Haaga-Helia, Metropolia and Laurea.

Ballet and opera are considered mainstream art, not elite entertainment. Tickets are affordable, the setting is casual and the quality world-class.\n\nCAPITALÂ OFÂ METAL with Tuska, but Helsinki also hosts other world-renowned festivals such as Flow, Weekend and Helsinki International Film Festival.\n\nAMAZINGÂ BARS and pubs offer top-notch drinks, make sure to visit Stadin Panimo and Bryggeri Helsinki as well as cocktail bars Liberty or Death, A21 and Tislaamo.
