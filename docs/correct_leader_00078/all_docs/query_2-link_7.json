        "text": "Lauri Ingman's second cabinet was the 11th Government of independent Finland, serving between 31 May 1924 â 31 March 1925. It was formed following the 1924 parliamentary elections between four partiesâNational Coalition Party, Agrarian Party, National Progressive Party and Swedish People's Partyâand had a majority in the parliament during the first six months. Overall, the cabinet lasted 305 days in office.[1]\n\nThe cabinet lost its parliamentary majority after the Agrarian Party withdrew following a disagreement on the pension of government officials. The Ingman cabinet finally resigned four months due to defeat of an election bill in the parliament.[2]"
