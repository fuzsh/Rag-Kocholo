        "text": "Work life balance in Finland is a big and important topic. Indeed Finland is offering high standards when it comes to work or daily life. Known for having a high participation rate of both men and women in working life. Altogether, 78 percent of men and 73 percent of women work. While this is almost the same as the EU-15 average for men, it is substantially higher than the EU-15 average of 57 percent for women.\n\nWeekly working hours do not differ much from the EU average. However, working overtime is more common in Finland than in the EU whilst part-time working is less common.\n\nFinland’s options for family leave are numerous. Every child under school age is entitled to municipal day care, which is organized in day care centres, in family day care and in playgroups. The family’s income level influences day care fees. There are also various private day care services available. The possibility to have the children taken care of allows workers to have a better work life balance in Finland as they can create a family and manage their work life.\n\nGender equality is strongly emphasized in Finnish working life and is underpinned by legislation.\n\nThere are about 1.4 million families in Finland. Approximately half of these are families with children and 13 percent of them are single parent families. During the last 30 years, the number of childless families has almost doubled and now makes up 44 percent of all families. The number of divorces has also increased during last 20 years.\n\nHowever, family life is highly valued in Finland, although the concept of family is becoming increasingly elastic. National holidays are often spent and celebrated within the family.\n\nLegislators and employers have come up with structures which make work life balance in Finlandless complex.\n\nFurthermore, it is possible to stay at home and take care of your child until they are three years of age without fear of losing your job. Once your child has entered school, you can adjust your working hours to facilitate child care.\n\nNational holidays\n\nFor each month of full-time working Finns earn at least two days of annual leave. The most common time for summer holidays starts at the end of June when Finns celebrate the Midsummer holidays. You shouldn’t plan any business meetings to take place in the holiday period lasting from mid-June till mid-August.\n\nIt is common for Finns to also take a week of holidays in the wintertime, either around Christmas or in early spring when children have their winter holidays. That way people can once again have a work life balance in Finland, as they enjoy some rest with their families before going back to work.\n\nThere are several official holidays in Finland. Some of them are Christian, some not. Annual official holidays in Finland are the following and all Sundays.\n\nHolidays Date New Year January 1 Epiphany January 6 Good Friday March / April Easter Sunday March / April Easter Monday March / April Labour Day / May Day May 1 Ascension Day May Pentecost May / June Midsummer Eve June Midsummer Day June All Saints’ Day November Independence Day December 6 Christmas Eve December 24 Christmas Day December 25 Boxing Day December 26\n\nWorking hours\n\nFinnish weekly working hours are the same as the European Union average. Yet, there is more overtime and less part time work (although this has been increasing recently) Working hours vary among highly educated employees. Around 10% work a short week (less than 34 hours), and about 50% work a normal working week (35-40 hours). However, about one third of this category works 41 to 49 hours per week; and one sixth works over 50 hours per week.\n\nFrom Monday to Friday office hours are usually between 8 am and 5 pm. Lunch is eaten between 11 am and 2 pm and lasts between 1 and 2 hours. At lunch, what might strike you is that the business talk seems to go on. Finns love to do business and during business hours there is no time for small talk. Dinner in restaurants usually starts around 7 or 8 pm.\n\nHealth insurance\n\nFinnish health care seeks to ensure health and medical care services for all members of the public regardless of place of residence or economic situation. The services are based on public-sector services financed from tax revenues. Government owned Social Insurance Institution (Kela) supports the use of private services, too. There is also a certain amount of private medical care insurance.\n\nThe national health insurance for EU/EEA citizens gives access to medical care at the Municipal Health Care Centres in Finland. For this you will need a European Health Insurance Card but does not mean that the health care would be free of charge. If you want all expenses covered in the case of accident or illness, it is advisable to take out a personal insurance policy.\n\nNon-EU/EEA citizens should check whether there is a social security agreement between Finland and their home country. In the event that there is one, they should also check what it covers. Even in the case that there is a social security agreement between the countries, it is advisable to have your own personal insurance, which covers all expenses including hospital treatment.\n\nIn the case of illness you should make an appointment to visit your local health centre. Public healthcare is available to all residents in Finland, regardless of their financial situation and includes primary healthcare, provided by municipal health centres, and specialized hospital care.\n\nIn an emergency, you should call 112 or visit your local hospital. In the case of a medical emergency, you will be admitted directly into a Finnish hospital. If the situation is not an emergency you should first contact a health care centre. In a dental emergency, go to the dental clinic in a health care centre and make an appointment.\n\nFor further information please see below:\n\nhttp://www.expat-finland.com/living_in_finland/index.html [en]\n\nDo you want to learn more about Finland ?:"
