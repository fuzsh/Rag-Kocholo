I have had the opportunity to contribute to people’s lives this way hundreds of times, for single individuals as well as within big projects. It was even more valuable when I could guide someone into the world of work and allow them to find their own way.”\n\n“Since the beginning of my career, as a trainee recruiter in a small local Italian branch, until today as the Global Temp & Perm Senior Director, I have always addressed my will and energy to ease the way for people to find their job, to position the staffing service as a value creator for candidates and companies, overcoming the commodity cliché.”\n\n“When I joined Gi Group I immediately realised that a job is not only a job. Working means feeding a family, having a sustainable life and dignity. A job plays a big part in people’s happiness, and once you realise this, you take on a lot of responsibility when you manage anybody’s job. Gi Group has given me this brilliant insight and the opportunity to make the most of it.”\n\nContinuous questioning and always looking to the future - this is the spirit with which Cetti started her career with Continuous questioning and always looking to the future – this is the spirit with which Cetti started her career with Nielsen where she worked for close to four years.

It is very fulfilling when you are able to create an outstanding team, with people of different profiles and different expertise, perhaps not the best in knowledge, but the best in passion, in commitment and in attitude. I believe that these are key characteristics to reach success.”\n\n“I remember two wonderful cases, both of them had been rejected by inexperienced consultants: one of them due to his age and the other one because of her gender. When I realised their profiles perfectly matched with the requirements, I included them in the short list. Both of them were hired thanks to their attitude and commitment, developing a brilliant career there. We changed their lives for the better!”\n\n“After several years of experience and working within several businesses, I have found a company in which its mission and values are not simply words.

By advising engineers and helping them find their best next career move I have been able to help people change their life and progress in their professional career.”\n\n“Many years ago, I managed to convince one of my clients to meet a candidate who was underpaid and blackmailed by his employer to get his working visa renewed. They decided to work together – and after four promotions and one MBA – this candidate is now the global head of his function – working in the Global Headquarters and living with his family in the US.”\n\n“Gi Group was born from the vision of a great entrepreneur and CEO who genuinely believes in the social responsibility of his company and the ability to change people’s lives for the better. It makes total sense to me and has given me the chance to also make a difference.”\n\nJim is an experienced professional with extensive knowledge of the latest L&D trends and practices.

I have always tried to give an opportunity to all my candidates young or not, qualified or unskilled, that could improve their lives while also improving the results of the companies in which they go to work.”\n\n“Working first in Italy, immediately after the approval of the law on temporary work, and then in Gi Group in the development of the business on a national and then international level, I was able to create new teams, accepting new challenges and managing new projects. It was and still is an experience where I got a lot from many people, working in many countries around the world. But I also believe that I have given my added value in tackling challenging projects, in building and consolidating teams of managers destined to gather the best of the market, teaching them that following already traveled paths could have been easier but it would not have led us to the best result, accepting the challenge of tracing new paths.”\n\n“Gi Group Holding represents an incredible professional journey. An almost all-encompassing experience at times. Choosing this company has had a profound impact on my life as a manager and as a man. Just as Gi asks me to be ready to face the new challenges of the Group and the market, so I ask a lot of myself to try to be a better man every day.

This allowes me to help institutions to shape a better labour market for people and companies.”\n\n“During the first Covid lockdown in Italy I contributed to the drafting and signing of the trade union agreement that allowed all our temporary workers to be paid even during that period.

So they can continue to generate value for the company, customers, partners and feel much more appreciated at the end of every day.”\n\n“I always tried to match colleagues’ passions, abilities and skills with their professional role and related responsibilities. It often worked. I particularly remember a case of a colleague who was very attached to his role, to the organisation and the company and in a few months led IT Innovation in an incredibly successful way, while at the same time got back positive energy and satisfaction.”\n\n“Even though I only joined Gi Group late in 2020, I already feel part of a team that shares the same core beliefs.

The more I understand, the more I can contribute to change for the better.”\n\n“When I propose to someone new opportunities to develop and progress, when I launch new initiatives at a global level that impact thousands of people, when people thank me for what I’m doing for them, when we celebrate or we humbly learn from our mistakes, I feel proud of being in a Human Resources centred company.”\n\n“I am better as a woman after having my two children, I am better as a manager after being given the opportunity to lead a global position, I am better as an individual as I’ve learnt that my strength is based on collaborating and working with other people.”\n\n“Throughout my marketing journey, my focus has been on cultivating the seeds of talent and ambition within my teams and people that I worked with. Managers and leaders do have responsibility to provide avenues for continuous learning and development, I aim to inspire change and growth within the marketing domain. It’s not just about leading a team but about nurturing an environment where each individual is encouraged to expand their horizons. I hope that my impact is felt in those moments when team members exceed their own expectations and when our collective efforts fuel not only business growth but personal achievements as well.”\n\n“The answer is twofold: internally, by nurturing marketing talent to foster innovation and externally, by crafting stories and campaigns that resonate with individuals’ aspirations. It’s about inspire those looking for career progression, offering insights into achievable steps towards change.
