The parent company is fully liable for the actions of the branch office;\n\nThe branch office representative for i) a non EEA parent company, must be a Finnish resident ii) an EEA parent company, must be an EEA resident. If the parent company is not from the EEA, the branch office requires special permission from the Finnish Patent and Registration office.\n\nThe Finnish representative office (edustusto)\n\nA representative office in Finland of a foreign company, is not allowed to produce goods or provide services. This entity can i) maintain business relations between the parent company and its Finnish Clients and ii) conduct marketing for parent company.
