        "text": "Are you an international growth entrepreneur from outside the EU looking to build a startup in Finland? You might qualify for the Finnish Startup Permit. But first, our team at Business Finland will need to evaluate whether your business model, team, and resources show potential for rapid international growth. If it does, you will receive a positive Eligibility Statement, to be attached to your Startup Permit application.\n\nThe Startup Permit is issued for a maximum of two years and can be renewed. It does not include investments or financial support.\n\nPlease note that we are receiving a high number of Eligibility Statement applications at the moment and the processing is taking longer than expected. The summer holiday season (July-August) will also affect the length of the evaluation process of the Eligibility Statement applications. We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause."
