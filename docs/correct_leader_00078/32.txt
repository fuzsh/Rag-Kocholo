The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman (Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto in Finnish or Dataombudsmannens byrå in Swedish) is the national Data Protection Authority for Finland. It resides in Helsinki and is in charge of enforcing GDPR in Finland.

Structure

The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman is headed by the Data Protection Ombudsman (tietosuojavaltuutettu / dataombudsman) and two Deputy Data Protection Ombudsmen (apulaistietosuojavaltuutettu / biträdande dataombudsman) who all may take decisions. They are appointed by the government for five-years terms. Collectively they form the Sanctions Board, which imposes the fines set out in the GDPR.[2]

An independent Expert Board is also appointed by the government for three-year term, and its task is to issue statements on significant questions relating to the application of the legislation if the Data Protection Ombudsman requests so. The Board consists of the Chair, Vice-Chair, and three Members, with everyone having a personal deputy.

The Office consists of three customer service teams. The first one focuses on private sector and cross-border matters, the second one on the public sector and domestic cases, and the third one on law enforcement and national security matters. Other services and functions of the Office are centralised in the Administrative Unit and the Joint Functions team.[1]
