Mr. Tam Minh Nguyen, age 68 passed away peacefully on April 21, 2024 at 4:30 am. Mr. Nguyen was born and raised in Saigon, Viet Nam.

He was the 3rd child of 11 from Mr. & Mrs. Sam Don Nguyen and My Thi Do Nguyen. At the age of 19, Tam left Viet Nam and immigrated to America along with his surviving 9 siblings. He would remain in Indiana for the rest of his life.

Tam’s entire world was a place called Indianapolis. As a carefree person who valued his freedom, he loved to be outdoors. However, Tam’s true joy was found spending time with the places and people he loved most. Everyone who met him would say he was a happy-go-lucky fellow with an inimitable zest for life. He was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and friend, and could always be found joking around with or helping out those he encountered. Tam led an eventful life, and his strength and endurance kept him happy and defiant even through the toughest of times.

Tam was an unforgettable person who always managed to bring goodness, generosity, and compassion out of people. His presence will be greatly missed.

Mr. Tâm Nguyễn is survived by his mom, My Đỗ Nguyễn, 5 brothers and 4 sisters
