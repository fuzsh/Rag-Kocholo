        "text": "I’ve always loved being a country girl, coming from Thanh Hoa – a small city 150 km from Hanoi.\n\nIn 2012 I became a part of Easia Travel by chance, but have come to be passionate about what I am doing. I’m really lucky to have had the chance to visit places such as China, Cambodia, Shangri-la, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, and India. Top on my bucket list are Tibet, Mongolia, Iran, Turkey, Sri Lanka and Africa.\n\nBesides traveling, I enjoy photography, listening to music, drawing, playing computer games or just going out for a trek up a mountain when time permits.\n\nI was born and grew up in Haiphong, a maritime city, in the North of Vietnam. I love my small city for its nice weather, airy atmosphere, slow lifestyle and delicious local street foods.\n\nI joined Easia in 2009.\n\nMy most memorable trip for the moment is still Myanmar in May 2012 with my colleagues and friends. At that time, it is the first time that this beautiful country opened its door with the worldwide and Vietnam Airlines just launched the direct flight Hanoi – Yangon. I discovered amazing landscapes, nice and smiley people and especially an absolute peaceful moment at a stunning sunset on local boat in the Inle Lake that I have never had this experience before.\n\nNext trip on my list: Bhutan, a Buddhist kingdom on the Himalayas’ eastern edge, to feel the authenticity in every corner of this\n\nWhen I am not working or travelling, my favorite time is spent for reading, listening to music, cooking something at home or meeting with friends.\n\nI was born and raised in Hanoi – the capital city of Vietnam. It’s difficult to specify what the most thing I like about my hometown because I love everything about it no matter how it changed speedily. But the drizzle during the rainy season leaves the deepest impression on me. It drizzles over the day, sometimes prolongs for a week. That makes the road slippery and dirty, the locals annoyed and the weather more humid. I recognize that the drizzle challenged my patience and built up my personality. As a result I know how to smile when it’s raining suddenly or for the whole day long even a week.\n\nI’ve been working in Easia Travel for almost a year. The most memorable trip I had with Easia travel is the time we went to MAI CHAU for several reasons. Firstly ,this was the first time I took a trip with people from different countries : French , Italian and Vietnamese, interestingly we had a English speaking guide, as we know all the foreign languages we acquired, definitely have a strong influence on your mind. Therefore we had a row ‘bout waking or biking around the village luckily thank to the guide we all settled down with the decision of walking. Secondly the walking day was the best choice ever because the valley was filled up with lush vegetation, moreover we had a chance to observe the daily life of the locals.\n\nNow I desire to go to antique citadel of Vietnam Hue because the Hue cuisine is well-known and I would love to taste some signature dishes, besides from Hue I can set off to Hoi An and Danang.\n\nI want to promote our country’s image to the world.\n\nI was born and raised in Ha Nam province. It is located on south of Red River Delta, southern gateway of Hanoi. It is not hustle and bustle as Hanoi, it is a peaceful countryside where containing my childhood memories. Although I have now moved to live and work in Hanoi, I still remember everything there. I will never forget the smile of the people here, bike ride in summer afternoon along the green rice field to breathe fresh air, play traditional games with friends or enjoy our local foods.\n\nI started working for Easia Travel from December 2012 as Sales. I think that was the right decision, because I was doing my favorite job and learned a lot of things here from my managers, my colleagues and my clients.\n\nUntil now I still cannot forget my trip to Cambodia in 2013. It’s hard to describe in words about this trip: the friendliness of the people, the mystery of Angkor temples, unique culture and delicious food. It is really worth to visit this country.\n\nI love travelling. I wish I can put my foot on all countries in the world. However, for this year Myanmar is at the top of my list for travelling. With beautiful countryside and spectacular, surreal temples and friendly, genuine local people, from the other worldly landscape of the 4000 sacred stupas scattered across the plains of Bagan to the impossibly golden glittering stupas of Shwedagon Pagoda. It is really excited when I think about it.\n\nApart from work and travel, cooking has always been my passion. That is the reason why I send almost my weekend time at the kitchen. It is extremely great when you can treat your family or friends the delicious food by yourself.\n\nI was born in the province of Thai Binh in northern Vietnam. Different from the occupied cities, it is a calm province because the major activity is agricultural production. I often come back to my countryside for all my holiday.\n\nI have been working at Easia since 2014. It is a chance for me to be able to work in this good environment.\n\nI always remember my holiday in Cat Ba (about 120 km east of Hanoi) with my friends a few years ago. The atmosphere and beaches are beautiful. I like to go back there someday.\n\nMy next trips will be in Laos, a country of one million elephants and Cambodia, well known with magnificent temples of Angkor.\n\nI hope that you could discover our country, our culture one day.\n\nI was born and grew up in Hanoi. My favorite part of the city is the old quarter, where you can feel the heartbeat of the city and have chance to taste amazing street food around every corner.\n\nI joined Easia Travel in February 2015.\n\nMy favorite city in Vietnam is Hue. I went there 2 times, the last time was with the entire Easia team for our annual motivation trip. This city was the capital of Vietnam during the last feudal dynasty. It always has some sort of “royal” atmosphere, as you can find a lot of historic monuments here. The city is peaceful, and the people here are extremely friendly.\n\nIt is not that easy to travel the world if you are from Vietnam. However, I hope that one day I can visit Istanbul, the city that connects Europe and Asia. Its cultural diversity always interests me. Dan Brown’s novel, and Doner Kebab, also inspire me as well.\n\nIn my free time, I’d love to play video games with my friends, read books/newspapers or play sport.\n\nOriginally coming from Hanoi, I have witnessed the city growing up with me. What I love most about Hanoi is its autumn which brings special atmosphere. Life seems slow down, people tends to relax to enjoy this period of the year and you can smell and feel Alstonia scholaris along the street.\n\nI joined the team 5.5 years ago. My most memorable trip was first time going to Hoi An, 15 years ago. All my life before, we only went to beaches in North Vietnam so first time seeing Cua Dai beach, it is “Wow” moment for me. My eyes were wide open in front of the crystal blue sea which I saw in movie before\n\nNext trip planned in my list: Con Dao island as I want to discover all the amazing beaches in Vietnam as beaches always brings relaxing feeling to me. During my free time, I love reading books, do shopping and hanging out with my friends.\n\nI was born and I grew up in Ha Nam, in the north of Viet Nam.\n\nI love my city for its peaceful atmosphere. I love cycling through the rice fields when I come back home\n\nI joined the Easia team 7 years ago.\n\nMy most memorable trip was for sure the Easia motivation trip in Hoian in 2013 with my colleagues, nice landscape and I had unforgettable moments with my colleagues: night on the common room, bike ride, team building game …\n\nNext trip on my list: Mekong delta to enjoy the fruits, take the cruise, go cycling via yards.\n\nWhen I am not working or travelling, I like reading the comics, cooking or walking!\n\nI was born in Versailles near Paris and I used to live in Paris and its region.\n\nParis is the most beautiful city in the world with its historical and cultural Heritage but too cold for me!\n\nThat is one of the reasons I have decided to move to Asia and to join the Easia Travel Team in June 2016.\n\nI have two most memorable trips – Bhutan and Yemen. Amazing scenery, culture, architecture, people, a perfect balance. WOW moments in my life.\n\nMy passion apart from travel and work (or vice versa ! ) is to read, and what I like most , is a book with a cup of tea."
