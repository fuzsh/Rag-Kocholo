Хо Ши Мин - человек с любовью к свободе, борец за долгую жизнь за право вьетнамцев и всего человечества на жизнь. Рассматривая свободу как смысл существования и революционные цели в любое время, Хо Ши Мин постоянно размышлял о ценностях свободы на протяжении всего пути бескомпромиссной борьбы с насилием и тиранией. В результате он не только оставил позади глубокую систему взглядов на вечную ценность всего человечества, но и превратил эту мысль в непревзойденную силу вьетнамского народа в борьбе за право на права человека. В этой статье автором проведен анализ основных и уникальных аспектв мысли Хо Ши Мина о свободе и ее значений для развития вьетнамской нации сегодня.\n\nКлючевые слова: Хо Ши Мин, идеология, свобода, нация, человечество.\n\nUDC 94(597) DOI: 10.24411/2304-2338-2019-11102\n\nIn human society, freedom is both natural nature and permanent aspiration of the human-beings. As fighting for freedom contributes to eliminating oppression and injustice in society, the fierceness of the struggle presents itself as measure for self-esteem of every person and every nation. Bearing in mind a strong aspiration for freedom and profound love for human-beings, Ho Chi Minh became a tireless fighter of the Vietnamese nation and all humanity for freedom.\n\n1. Ho Chi Minh - a long-life fighter for freedom and freedom\n\nIn the mankind's development history, the West is a birthplace of liberal thoughts. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, one of the revolutionalists who fighted radically for liberity, affirmed in his work \"The Social Contract\" that freedom is human nature and abandonment of freedom means abandonment of human virtues, abandonment of the right to become human beings and abandonment of human duties. The progressive thoughts of the revolutionaries in the Age of Enlightenment have became a flagship in the bourgeois revolution with the slogan \"Freedom, Equality and Charity\". However, there is a paradox in practice. At the birthplace of liberal ideas, colonialism, which deprived the right to independence and freedom of many nations including Vietnam, was born. On the other hand, the invaders praised and preached the tradition of liberity in the Western civilization while trampling on the Vietnamese's right to freedom with their brutal governance policies. It is them who awakened the Vietnamese's desire to change their life as well as their sense of freedom. On the side of the\n\nVietnamese, such ideas as freedom, equality and charity are something very new and interesting as they live in a brutal semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, where there were no constitutions, citizenship and human rights.\n\nHo Chi Minh representing the suffers told \"When I was 13 years old, I heard three words: Freedom, Equality and Charity for the first time. And I was very interested in getting familiar with the French civilization to understand what is being hidden behind these words\" [5, p. 461]. As a young man but with the special political sensitivity, Ho Chi Minh did not want to approach to external manifestations of the French civilization but explore the essence of such ideas as freedom, equality and charity as well as the nature of capitalism. For that purpose, he made a decision to go to western countries in search of the nation-liberating ways.\n\nThe French colonialist deprived the Vietnamese of their right to freedom and the Vietnamese had to oppose that force if desiring to regain their freedom. For the desire to defeat the enemy, it is important to obtain a thorough understanding about it. Evidently, Ho Chi Minh returned to France after a long journey to various countries and continents at the end of 1917. Having been persuing the ideal of freedom, Ho Chi Minh joined the French Socialist Party in 1919 as he realized that it was a single organization in France which defended his country as well as pursued noble ideals of French Revolution like \"Freedom - Equality - Charity\" [4, p. 47]. In 1919, this freedom-loving person, who renamed himself as Nguyen Ai Quoc, signed a list of claims for the Annamese People for submission to the Versaille Peace Conference to claim for rights to freedom and democracy within the framework of bourgeois democracy for the Vietnamese. Although the Claim had not been satisfied by the Conference, it made a huge splash in the international arena because it it the first time that one Vietnamese claims for the rights to freedom was made public at such an international conference and published on several prestigious newspapers. From this moment, the name \"Nguyen Ai Quoc appeared as a flickening light and also a suddently-flashed hope in the dark sky\" [16, p. 139]. Ho Chi Minh clearly understood from this event that \"the nations would merely rely on themselves and their own resources if they wanted to retake their freedom\" [17, p. 43]. It must be self-liberation from slavery and it is evident that they can not expect either generousity or awakening of conscience from the invaders.\n\nIn his perspectives, freedom is not merely to guarantee individual freedom in capitalist countries as conceived by the bourgeois but the world actually will have freedom when there is no longer class and national oppression. With that thought, Ho Chi Minh considered protection of the small nations' rights to freedom as an important criterion to assess whether an organization is revolutionary or not. When being questioned why he voted the Communist International (a.k.a the International III) in spite of little understanding about this organizaion on the 30th of December 1920, he explained that \"The International III said that it would assist oppressed nations to regain their freedom and independence. It was a reason that I voted the International III. Freedom is for my people and my country. That is all I wanted and I understood\" [17, p. 65]. By saying that, he affirmed that freedom was a single goal of his fighting and aslo sole aspiration in his life. This statement has been reaffirmed in many occassions. With the unshakable belief in the people and profound understanding about the Indochinese's aspiration for freedom under the rule of French colony, Ho Chi Minh vehemently criticized an allegation \"Indochina does not want revolution and is content with the current regime\" [5, p. 39]. He thought that the brutality of colonialism provided conditions for nourishing the Indochinese's aspiration for freedom and their will of liberation as the more they lost their freedom, the more they yearned for freedom. Freedom in their thought is something that no power is capable of dispossessing from the human being. He wrote \"Behind the negative obedience, the Indochinese hides something that is boiling, screaming and will explode tremendously when any opportunities come\" [1, p. 40]. The duty of the revolutionaries and revolutionary parties is to aggregate these people into a national liberation revolution following the orbit of the proleariat revolution for retaking the freedom.\n\nHo Chi Minh longs for freedom not only in his fate of a nation-losing person and with his deep love for his peoples but also with the experiences of a freedom-depriving person when he was confined in Chiang Kai-shek prison from August 1942 to September 1943. With the prisoner's brave spirit of \"The body in a jail but the spirit outside the jail\", Ho Chi Minh expressed his aspiration for freedom through his collection of poems \"Prison Dairy\". His desire of freedom is not only a normal prison's aspiration for escaping from the jail but also his worriment and responsibility oft the leader of the national liberation movement in a time of turmoil. In the \"Prison Diary\", Ho Chi Minh repeated the word \"freedom\" 13 times with his burning aspiration. Practical experiences and hardships on his revolutionary path brought him a thorough understanding about freedom and made him long for freedom more intensively.\n\nHaving treasured the ideal of freedom, Ho Chi Minh declared in a diplomatic meeting in 1946 \" Here we are in Paris, a heroic and generous city which initiated the principles of freedom, equality and charity and has a habit of defending the equality of the nations. In this city, I have a honor to declare that Vietnam would join in such a very humanitarian course\" [10, p. 304]. Affirming freedom as common aspiration of the nations, Ho Chi Minh also said \"Vietnam and France are two free and equal nations, both of which have the ideal of democracy and desire of freedom\" [10, p. 401]. Therefore, France must respect the Vietnamese nation's right to freedom and work with Vietnam to build up the friendship on the spirit of equality. However, the Government of France again betrayed the ideal of freedom shown by the French Revolution by depriving the Vietnamese nation's rights to independence and freedom.\n\nHo Chi Minh, who considers freedom as reason of his life and a search for freedom for his nation as his major mandate, engaged his peoples into the nation-defending war with the spirit that \"As long as there are any invaders on our land, we have to fight and wipe them out completely. As the leader of the anti-imperialism struggle, Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom manifests the aspiration of freedom and the fierce fighting to claim the right to freedom for the entire Vietnamese people. As this reason, his thought of freedom contains extremely significant aspects.\n\nFirstly, Ho Chi Minh confirms freedom as the most noble human right and no one has a right to deprive of this sacred right.\n\nOnce Ho Chi Minh wrote such verses as \"Nothing is more suffering than the loss of freedom\"; \" In the world with thousands or tens of thousands of bitters, no bitters are comparable with the loss of freedom, these thoughts are not only his poetic inspirations but also his clearly-shaped ones forming his core values. For Ho Chi Minh, freedom is an ultimate human right because no one can live a human life and all of their minimum needs are unguaranteed if there is a loss of freedom. For the nations, the loss of freedom triggers numerous tragedies. A country loses its name on the world map, no longer keeps its right to self-determination and is exploited to the marrow-bones. The peoples have \"nearly zero freedom and democracy\" and the nations have no opportunities for development. Consequently, the people are humiliated spiritually and hunger, coldness, illiteracy, diseases and sickness encircle them as well, forcing them to live the non-human life. National oppression is such a stain in the history of mankind that opposing the oppression is an indispensable action of righteous men and dignified nations. On the side of the invaders, who ruthlessly deprived the freedom of other nations, are not only criminals of the history by committing into immoral actions but also with their action of invasion they take away their own right to freedom and to be respected.\n\nIt means that freedom makes a start point to reach happiness and prosperity for anyone. Being a human being, he or she necessarily is free and must respect the other person's right to freedom. With the view \"It is better to die in honor than to live in shame\", Ho Chi Minh took a behalf of the Vietnamese nation to declare \"Sacrificing all is even better than being enslaved\" when the French colonist made up their minds to invade Vietnam. When the American imperialist determined to bring Vietnam back to the Stone Age, Ho Chi Minh summarized a great truth of the era \"Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom\". As colonialism and imperialism are both international phenomena, a patriot who fights for the freedom of his nation naturally becomes a fighter for that of the mankind. Ho Chi Minh is a representative of such noble model.\n\nSecondly, Ho Chi Minh confirms that the freedom of each person must associate with the freedom of the entire nation.\n\nThis perception forms a difference between Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom and that of bourgeoisie. In our Declaration of Independence, after quoting famous statements about human rights from the US Declaration of Independence and the France's Declaration of Human Rights and Civil Rights, he made a conclusion \"In a broader meaning, these statements imply that all the nations in the world are born equal and all nations have the right to life, right to happiness and right to freedom\" [10, p. 1]. Ho Chi Minh's inference is completely logic due to inseparable relationship between human rights and national rights. Evidently, each person has the right to freedom, a nation of such people does not have such right, does it? On the other hand, if the entire nation is not independent and liberal, where does each person living on that land receive the light of independence and freedom? Therefore, if the human rights to life, happiness and equality are evident, the rights to life, happiness, freedom and equality of each nation are also clear-cut. Resultantly, Ho Chi Minh upgraded human rights admitted by the West into national rights and made a demand that such evident rights of the Vietnamese nation must be recognized and respected by allies. With the conception that the national rights include human rights as well as both individual and class benefits are compliant to national ones, Ho Chi Minh properly solved a problem on the relationship between national and class issues and between anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism in the Vietnamese revolution.\n\nThe Indochinese Communist Party's 8th Central Conference chaired by Ho Chi Minh affirmed anti-imperialism as a priority task because \"At this time, if we are not able to address the issue of national liberation and claim independence and freedom for the entire nation, not only the entire nation remains in slavery but also the rights of all classes and society components can not be reclaimed for a thousand years\" [13, p. 144]. Placing the nation's right to freedom above the individual's one is Ho Chi Minh's great point of creation, which has stirred the rebellious power of the entire nation in the struggle for freedom and independence.\n\nThirdly, Ho Chi Minh affirms that freedom results from a persistent struggle in the spirit of \"self-help or self-reliance \"\n\nIn search of the country-liberating ways, various fighting methods were tried by Ho Chi Minh in an attempt to regain the freedom for the people. With the Claims submitted to the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference, he had already used rights within the bourgeois democracy to claim minimum democratic rights for the Vietnamese. This event also helped Ho Chi Minh understand that any enemy would never voluntarily abandon their benefits and give freedom to other nations. Each person or nation must bravely stand up to break up cangues and stocks used for slaves if wanting to get freedom. They have to use their own resources to liberate themselves and revolutionary violence is an indispensable matter. In contact with Marxism-Leninism and in discussion of the relationship between metropolitan revolution [at the mother country] and colonial one [at the colonized countries], Ho Chi Minh gave a very creative argument that the proletariat revolution could succeed before the revolution in a mother country but the colonized countries could be liberated with their own efforts [9, p. 138].\n\nSelf-help is a prerequisite to get freedom as all types of reliance may lead to dependence. Having been imbrued with the spirit of self-help, our Party under the direction of Ho Chi Minh determined when preparing for our power-seizing rebellion \"Do not indulge in illusions that Chinese, British or American troops would bring freedom to us. We obviously have to make allies with others, temporarily in some certain conditions but our job must, first of all, done by ourselves in the process of liberation\" [3, p. 244].\n\nFollowing up this policy, Ho Chi Minh called for \"the whole nation to stand up and use its own resources for self-liberation\" in the once-in-a thousand year opportunity in August 1945. When the country was forced to carry out a resistance war against France, Ho Chi Minh and our Party, whose thoughts are clear-cut that \"one nation does not deserve being independent if it relies on other nations' assistance instead of self-help\", set a motion \"entire population, comprehensiveness, long-term and self-help\" [13, p. 445]. In 1950, China and Soviet Union recognized and then set up the diplomatic relationship with the Democratic Socialist of Vietnam, which had received aids from socialist countries since then. However, Ho Chi Minh still asserted \"Friendly countries, first of all, Soviet Union and China tried their our best to assist us chivalrously and impartially to enable us to get more resources for self-help\" [6, p. 103].\n\nAffirmably, freedom is a permanent desire but there is no eternal independence and freedom if each nation or person does not use their own strengths to defend them or if they remain dependent on others. Ho Chi Minh advised his citizens \"Each person should understand that independence only exists if there is self-help and freedom merely subsists if there is self-reliance\" [5, p. 553]. The universal truth \"Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom\" is a proposition of action. This requires each person to make efforts to contribute their resources to safeguarding the country's valuable independence and freedom.\n\nFourthly, Ho Chi Minh placesfreedom in the system of core values: independence, freedom and happiness\n\nInheriting the Sun Yat-sen's trinitism, Ho Chi Minh considered freedom as one value within the chain of sacred values. He argued that independence was a prerequisite for freedom and gaining the independence and freedom was to reach the happiness. The freedom and happiness of the peoples serve as a measure for true independence. Thanks to the close association of independence, freedom and happiness, Vietminh program directed by Ho Chi Minh throughout the preparation process and approved in October 1941 confirmed that Vietminh Front must primarily realize two things expected by the entire peoples including (i) making Vietnam completely independent and (ii) making the Vietnamese free and happy [3, p. 470]. This forms a difference between Ho Chi Minh and feudal intellectuals concerning to the thought of independence. Traditionally, independence is merely understood as \"not losing the country\". Ho Chi Minh conceived that independent must couple with freedom and happiness for the peoples. He clearly stated \"If the country gets independence but the peoples do not enjoy happiness and freedom, then independence is meaningless\" [10, p. 64]. He argued \"Only socialism and communism are capable of liberating the oppressed nations and labourers across the world from slavery\" [7, p. 563]. Only socialism is able to assure the execution of such values as Independence, Freedom and Happiness. For this reason, national independence associated\n\nwith socialism forms a core part in his ideology. Gaining the national independence to reach socialism is Ho Chi Minh's clear-cut political orientation.\n\nFifthly, Ho Chi Minh affirms that in the democratic country the freedom of human being must be confirmed in the constitutions\n\nAs viewed by Ho Chi Minh, freedom must be practiced in reality but not something like \"drawing-cake\" which has been used to defraud or deceive the peoples. Once the peoples are mobilized to stand up and fight for freedom, their right to freedom must be guaranteed by law when the revolution is successful. As a result, the 1946 and then 1959 institutions prepared by Ho Chi Minh-led drafting commitee affirmed that the Vietnamese citizens had all basic rights to freedom like freedom of thought, freedom of speech and freedom of religion.\n\nTheoretically, a free man is viewed as a man with the freedom in perception at first and then freedom in action. Freedom in perception and thought is aspiration of every person, especially the intellectuals because the loss of freedom means loss of creative capacity. Ho Chi Minh-formed democratic regime necessarily guarantees the right to enjoy the freedom of thought for the peoples and requires them to know how to use that sacred right. Ho Chi Minh once asserted: \"Our regime is a democratic one, in which thoughts must be free. What is freedom? Everyone is free to express their opinions about every issue, thus contributing to finding the truth. It is both a right and an obligation for everyone\" [6, p. 378]. In this occasion, freedom is very close to democracy and the practice of democracy serves as a condition to ensure the peoples' freedom in reality.\n\nAs viewed by Ho Chi Minh, a progressive social system necessarily guarantees the peoples' right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Severely condemning the colonial regime for depriving the Vietnamese of these important rights, he wrote \"In the middle of this twentieth century, there are no newspapers in such a country of 20 million people. Can you imagine it? There are no newspapers in our native language\" [5, p. 428]. With an perspective that the press acts as a forum for the peoples to express their willings an aspirations as well as a measure for the democratic spirit in society. After the August Revolution, Ho Chi Minh signed many decrees to ensure the peoples' freedom of speech on the press. Thanks to that, the press has become an useful information channel for the Party and State to supplement or adapt their guidelines an policies to the practice.\n\nAmong the individual rights of freedom, Ho Chi Minh paid a special attention to the right to freedom of religion for the Vietnamese citizens. With the long-standing perception that the religious faith is a right of each person which needs to be respected, Ho Chi Minh President made a suggestion in his first meeting of the Interim Government Council on the 03rd of September 1945 \"Our government makes a declaration about freedom of religion and solidarity of non-religious and religious communities\" [10, p. 8].\n\nSpeaking at the celebration of the National Union on the 5th of January 1946, Ho Chi Minh emphasized \"Buddhists believe in Buddha, Christians believe in God and we believe in Confucious. Those are the religious dignitaries we believe in\" [10, p. 169]. Under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, the 1946 and then 1959 Institutions both confirmed that the peoples have the right to freedom of religions. It means that they have a right to follow or not follow a certain religion. Ho Chi Minh protested against all violations of the peoples' right to freedom of faiths and religions so resolutely that among eight instructions released by the Goverment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the forth instruction is \"The Government, army and mass organizations must respect beliefs, practices and customs of the peoples\" [17, p. 488]. He advised cadres or officers in all cases \"not to offend the beliefs and customs of the peoples\" [11, p. 501]. They must always honor good values hidden in the religions as well as respect the founders of the religions and guarantee the peoples' right to freedom of beliefs. These are outstanding points in Ho Chi Minh's political thought as compared with many other contemporary maxists. By inheriting the national tradition of undaunted struggles against foreign invaders, acquiring the liberal ideology of progressive humanity and promoting the radical revolution spirit of the Maxism-Leninism, Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom made contributions to the eternal value of the humanity and he himself became a great symbol for the desire of freedom.\n\n2. Significance of Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom for the Vietnamese revolution\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh, action is a destination of thought. Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom, therefore, has made strong impacts on the revolutionary process of Vietnam in the past, present and future.\n\nFirstly, Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom has become a justification for living for the entire Vietnamese nation as well as an invincible power for the Vietnamese nation in their fighting for liberation.\n\nAt the young age, Ho Chi Minh believed in the power of free will and independence so strongly that he wroted in his summary of Vietnamese history \"Nuoc Nam won thanks to its will of independence and desire for freedom rather than army of powerful weapontry and manpower\"\n\n[5, p. 98]. Upholding that tradition, Vietnam, whose name was abolished from the world map, became a place to burry both old and new colonialism. It can be said that Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom has \"touched\" the deepest part in the heart of every Vietnamese, that is patriotism and desire for freedom and urged the Vietnamese to voluntarily live up to ideals \"Freedom or Death\". \"Definitely, I would rather sacrifice everything than let my country lose their independence and let my peoples become slaves\". The Vietnamese's strength in the war has been once praised by the world. It is known that materialsim is the power in our era of the twentieth century that is also called in various names as energy age, atomic age, jet age, cybernetic era, era of space exploration and computer age etc. Many equipment processed by the US are not owned by Vietnam, whose single power is manpower [15, p. 43]. More correctly, it is power of the people with the vehement aspiration of freedom. With that desire, the Vietnamese has made such historical brilliant feats as the August Revolution and two victories in the wars against the French colonialist and the American imperialist.\n\nVietnamese nation's miraculous victories proved a new truth for the era \"In the present era, when revolutionary forces are on the offensive, a nation with the not-large geographical space and not-crowded population can completely defeat all invading imperialists even the oligarchs thanks to close solidarity and resolute struggle under the leaderhip of Marxist - Leninist Party with the proper revolution methods\" [2, p. 27-28]. That truth brings the peoples a faith in the power of lightness and equality, encouraging them to constantly struggle for the ideal of freedom. It is humanitarian values in Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom.\n\nSecondly, Ho Chi Minh 's thought of freedom bequeathed the Party and nation the orientationss of actions for uphoding the nation's valuable independence and freedom.\n\nThe today world is developing at such a great pace with so many great changes having being occured each day that the human beings' perception on socialism and internatinal solidarity have experienced numerous changes as well. Among the myriad of variables, there exist several invariables, one of which is the desire of freedom. At present, Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom bequeathed such valuable lessons as:\n\n- Obligation to protect the nation's right to independence and freedom\n\nA rule as generalized by the Vietnam's national history expresses that buiding a country must accompany with defending the country. Defending the country means upholding the nation's independence and freedom. Freedom and independence are such immutable values at any times and an ultimate goal of the Vietnamese nation that all policies and guidelines must imbrue with that spirit and serve that noble goal.\n\nIt is impermissible to infringe upon the peoples' right to live in independence and freedom at any times because of any kinds of partnership, relationship or short-term benefits. Among the nation's rights, the right to opt for the political tendencies is the most important one. For this reason, the consistent pursuit for the objectives of socialism and the realization of that orientation in our country currently represent a scale to measure the level of freedom in the Vietnamese nation.\n\n- Determination to overcome the risk of economic lag and promote the democracy\n\nEconomic lag will create difficulties in defending the national independence, sovereignty and lead to economic dependence and consequently political one. Therefore, we must narrow the gap of economic development with advanced countries in the region and the world to obtain the freedom in the real meaning.\n\nAt present, the Party and State must concentrate their forces on addressing obstacles and bottlenecks in the economic development, reconstructing the economy, intensifying their combat against corruption and group interests to trigger the sustainable development and multiple the potentials of Vietnam in all aspects.\n\n- Obligation to educate the spirit of self-help and self-reliance for the peoples, particularly young generations\n\nAlthough a combination of national strengths and the power of the era forms one rule in the Vietnamese revolution, Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom also emphasizes the decisive role of internal resources and necessity to promote the spirit of self-reliance. As it is not a naturally-formed spirit, the Party must patiently educate the spirit of self-reliance and self-help for young generations. On the contrary, if there is an attitude of fear like fear of France, fear of Japan and then fear of America, it is not worth being a united and independent nation. If the thought of reliance and expectation of assistance from this country or that country still remains, it is not deserved to be a united and independent nation as well [12, p. 111]. As self-help and self-reliance are both manifestation and condition to realize the desire of freedom, these spirits must be constantly fostered and promoted.\n\n- Party's obligation to rely on the peoples and uphold the freedom of the peoples The peoples are those who make history and their powers are unconquerable. It is the hardworking peoples with muddy limbs who formed the shape of the fatherland and sacrificed their bodies to build up a solid wall for defending the fatherland. However, the Party and State wish to rely on the peoples, they must, first of all, take care of and foster the peoples' powers. \"If the peoples are hunger, it is a fault of the Party and the Government; if the people are cold, the Party and the Government are at fault; if the peoples are sick, the Party and the Government are blameful. Therefore, the party and government officiers from top to bottom level must pay a special attention to the life of the peoples\" [14, р. 518].\n\nThe Party and State must ensure the freedom and democracy of the peoples, in addition to the care for their material life. Freedom in the human thought in the democratic regime is always confirmed by Ho Chi Minh but this right can be merely realized in an actually-democratic mechanism. \"Democracy is how to open the peoples' mouths \" simply explained by Ho Chi Minh. The peoples do not open their mouths because they are fearful or doubtful that their opinions are neither appreciated nor listened. A current matter is to practice democracy rather discuss it. It is obliged to repel such problems as bureaucracy, corruption, bullying, disregard of the peoples, and insensitivity to the people's frustrations and hardships etc. to gradually regain the peoples' trusts. Patriotism is an intrinsic characteristic of the Vietnamese but the leadership must, at first, must present them as embodiment of patriotism in order to initiate and mobilize this miraculous power.\n\nAlong with the social progress, the mankind has agreed for a long time that each nation has a right to seek the happiness, design the future and seek and grasp the opportunities if they do not infringe upon similar rights of other countries. The Communist Party of Vietnam, which takes the responsibility of a \"ruling\" party, must perform these obligations well. For this reason, the party cadres' morality and brainpower are now viewed as decisive factors for guaranteeing the freedom of the peoples.\n\nAs commented by the international scholars, Ho Chi Minh is a person and the history could have followed a different path without him [1, р. 152]. If the French colonialists omit our nation's name on the world map, it was Ho chi Minh who regained independence for our nation and right to live in freedom and happiness for our peoples. Ho Chi Minh's thought of freedom, which is crystallized from the entire nation's desire for freedom and manifests the core values of the mankind, will continue to shed light for the Vietnamese on the journey to build Vietnam as a peaceful, united, independent, democratic and prosperous country as expressed in the last wishes of Ho Chi Minh, a soldier who has fought all his life for freedom [8, р. 614].\n\nСписок литературы / References\n\n1.
