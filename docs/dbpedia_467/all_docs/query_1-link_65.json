        "text": "My father, Tran Van Minh, who has died aged 95, was not one for fuss and bother. I think this probably made him a good fit for the job he did for 30 years, which was translator and news reader for the BBC Vietnamese Service.\n\nHe was one of the first members of the then shortwave radio service, which started in 1952. The majority of his newscasts went out during the war with the US, and on his first trip back to Vietnam after the end of the conflict, a number of strangers recognised his voice and told him that the BBC had been a trusted source of impartial news, and listened to religiously at midday and midnight.\n\nIn the early days after the fall of Saigon in 1975, he was fairly certain that he was followed by government security when he visited. This would have been not only because of his BBC connection, but because of his family background. He was born in Ben Tre, in the southernmost part of Vietnam, the son of Tran Van Thong, who had been the governor of the Nam Dinh province during the French colonial years, and his third wife, Nguyen Thi Nhien.\n\nSeveral among Thong’s 26 offspring served in the South Vietnamese government. Chuong, my father’s eldest half-brother, was ambassador to the US in the early 1960s until he resigned in protest at President Ngo Dinh Diem’s anti-Buddhist policies. These policies were most infamously promoted by Chuong’s own daughter, and therefore my father’s niece, Madame Nhu, aka the “Dragon Lady”.\n\nAnother elder half-brother, Do, had been South Vietnam’s minister of foreign affairs in 1954. My father, who was a keen tennis player into his 80s, was quite in awe of the fact that Do had also been a south-east Asian tennis champion.\n\nAs one of the youngest in the family, my father may have been a bit of a rebel. Before joining the BBC, he was briefly in the communist-led Viet Minh independence movement, and his nickname in the family was L’Anglais, as he was the only one who did not stay in Vietnam or move to France or the US. As well as that, the woman he married, Marguerite Pham Ngoc Thuan, was from a family that mostly opposed the South Vietnamese government. They had known each other at school and married in Paris in 1952.\n\nConsiderably more fiery than my father, my mother once bumped into Nguyen Van Thieu, the former president of South Vietnam, when he was living in exile in London. Thieu was rumoured to have personally ordered the torture and execution of her brother, Albert, and my mother told us bitterly that if she had had a gun, she would have killed him there and then.\n\nThough my father’s job had been to speak to a mass audience, left to his own devices he would use as few words as possible. After he retired from the BBC in 1983, I was concerned he might not know how to fill his time and asked if he missed work. After a pause he chuckled and said “No”.\n\nMarguerite died in 2015. My father is survived by two daughters, Diana and Loan, and three sons, Mark, Pierre and me."
