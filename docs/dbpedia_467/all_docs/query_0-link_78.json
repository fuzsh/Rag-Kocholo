        "text": "Seven precious letters were all Dao Thi Minh Van had left of her father after the bombing finally stopped.\n\nThe dozens of other messages from him had burned, just more victims of the Hanoi air raids.\n\nIn them, her father wrote of reunion and a better life for them both - together in times of peace.\n\nHe once starting asking her to describe how beautiful she had become, but he caught himself as he wrote.\n\nNo, the letter read, words would not do. He wanted to see for himself during the reunion.\n\nIt never came.\n\nHoang Minh Dao instead found three patrol boats, three helicopters and an American ambush.\n\nAfter surviving two decades of war - first against the French and then against the United States - Hoang Minh Dao died in December 1969 as he crossed the Vam Co Dong River en route to a meeting with other top Communist Party operatives.\n\nHe was 46 years old.\n\nMinh Van was barely a toddler in 1946 when her father left to fight the French occupation. His farewell came just a few days after malaria killed her mother.\n\nShe doesn't remember the 100-kilometer journey from the village where she was born to North Vietnam's capital city. It took her a year to reach Hanoi, where her new foster family awaited.\n\nThey later told her she made the journey in a bucket-like satchel carried by an envoy appointed by her father.\n\nWhen she arrived, her new foster parents told Minh Van her father left to become a taxi driver in Cambodia.\n\nThe letters came only when the couriers made it through American security across the lines. Some were several pages long. Others were hastily scribbled notes.\n\nHe never wrote about where he was, Minh Van said. That might have betrayed his top-secret role as a high-ranking spy working in enemy territory.\n\n\"He wrote that he was trying to do his best so they could have a reunion,\" Minh Van said Thursday through a translator. \"He was working so she could have beautiful clothes.\"\n\nAs a teenager, she began piecing it together through overheard conversations and rumors.\n\nNews of his death took years to find her as an adult with a child of her own.\n\nOnce it did, she was not satisfied.\n\n\"When my children grew up, they kept asking,\" she said. \"These questions, these lagging questions keep pushing me that I have to find out about my father.\"\n\nHer quest has taken years. She's pieced much of it together from roughly 400 interviews with aging men who fought with her dad.\n\nThey needed time to remember, she said. Some were also wary of all the questions.\n\nSo she return to them again and again to earn their trust, to prove that she simply wanted to know what had happened.\n\nNo motives. No political agenda. Just a glimpse at a major piece of her own identity.\n\nHer father's peers slowly revealed to her a tale of a man with a warrior's dedication. He had worked in a number of capacities in and around Cu Chi and Saigon - the South Vietnamese capital - performing a variety duties before taking a post as the director of spying operations in the area.\n\nAt the time of his death in 1969, between 40,000 and 50,000 North Vietnamese political operatives were working to undermine the enemy on its own turf. Steve Maxner, director of Tech's Vietnam Center and Archive, said the threat of death or capture accompanied the spy chief wherever he went.\n\n\"He was running all of the significant operations around Saigon,\" Maxner said. \"That was a tough area to work in. A tough area to stay alive in.\"\n\nDespite all the interviews and a steady trickle of second-hand accounts of her father, Minh Van has yet to fill in the remaining gaps.\n\nThat's why she's been in Lubbock for the past week, working with Maxner at the archives.\n\nNow a successful businesswoman who travels to the United States frequently on business, Minh Van heard about the center from a reporter at a newspaper in Ho Chi Minh City - who was also her translator Thursday.\n\n\"It's been in my mind for a long, long time,\" she said. \"When I heard of the archive, I made up my mind I've got to come here.\"\n\nWhat unit ambushed him?\n\nHad he been betrayed by his own?\n\nDid the U.S. military know who he was?\n\nA week's worth of research has answered only the first of these questions.\n\nMaxner and Minh Van located a report made by the ambushing party's commanders to their superiors. It's not the actual report written by the soldiers in the fight - they have yet to find that - but it shed some light on what led the gunboats and helicopters to the river crossing, which helps with the next two questions.\n\nU.S. forces would regularly patrol areas of known river crossing at night, Maxner said. He said the ambush could have come during a routine patrol at time of day when anybody crossing the river was considered an enemy.\n\nIf the Americans had prior intelligence about the crossing that night, the command summaries would have mentioned it.\n\nBut there's no indication in the report that the Americans were waiting for them.\n\nAlso, Maxner added, if the U.S. intelligence had any inkling a man of Hoang Minh Dao's rank would be in the area, they would've sent a team to capture a prisoner, not kill combatants.\n\nThat, however, does not rule out the possibility of betrayal, Maxner said. The guide leading the party through the jungle could have been an American sympathizer who intentionally brought them into a known patrol route.\n\nAgain, though, this is only speculation.\n\nShe may not come away with all the answers on Saturday when she boards a flight to Florida on business, but Minh Van says she glad she looked here. And she plans to return next summer to look further.\n\nHer life has turned out well, she said, with three married daughters and five grandchildren awaiting her back home.\n\nThe wounds have healed over the years, she said, and she long ago stopped being angry at the men who killed her father.\n\nShe has even visited the Vietnam War Veterans Memorial in Washington several times as an adult.\n\nEvery name and accompanying age etched in the wall makes for a potent reminder.\n\n\"Each time, I stare at the age of the soldiers and I'm asking myself why,\" she said. \"Why did they go to such a faraway place to fight a war and die?\"\n\nThen, Minh Van said, she thinks of the families of all the names on the wall.\n\n\"They have the same questions,\" she added. \"They have the same suffering.\"\n\nTo comment on this story:\n\nmatthew.mcgowan@lubbockonline.com l 766-8724\n\njames.ricketts@lubbockonline.com l 766-8706"
