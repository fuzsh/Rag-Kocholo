Nearly half a century has passed, most of them have found their biological father, settled in the US but hundreds of other them are still languishing to find theirs, looking forward to reuniting.\n\nThis investigation divided into four articles (from the newspaper Thanh Nien, December 2019) shows us what is the reality of these mixed-race children of the war, and their struggle to find their biological fathers."
