We plan to reduce the number of financial courses that we offer in the Business programme in order to focus more on subjects such as management.

Đáp án đề thi PTE Core\n\nPhần 1: SPEAKING & WRITING\n\nRepeat Sentence – Question 1\n\nTranscript:\n\nThey used to rent a room in a house with five other people.\n\nRepeat Sentence – Question 2\n\nTranscript:\n\nYou don’t have to accept this job offer if you don’t want to.\n\nDescribe Image – Question 1\n\nSample response:\n\nThe diagram shows how to cook pasta or noodles. First, boil water in a large pan. Next, add the pasta or noodles to the boiling water, and cook for about ten to fifteen minutes. After that, you empty the pasta from the pan to remove all the water. You should do that over a sink. Then, when you have done that, put the pasta in a bowl. The pasta will still be hot. Finally, add some butter and salt and then it’s ready to eat.\n\nDescribe Image – Question 2\n\nSample response:\n\nIn this map of a city, we can see that point A is a train station opposite a theatre. To get from the station to the stadium, come out of the exit and turn right. At the end of the street turn right again and walk past the theatre on your left. Take the first left and walk to the end of the street. Turn right and you will see a post office on your left. Walk past the post office and then enter the park on your left. Walk across the park. On the opposite side of the park is the entrance to the stadium.\n\nRespond to a Situation – Question 1\n\nSample response:\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with the condition of the flat. When you rent a place to live, it’s your responsibility to look after it. Someone has damaged the carpet, and you needed to tell me about this. I can also see that the flat hasn’t been cleaned for a long time. This is not acceptable. I expect you to keep the flat clean. Unless you take care of the flat, you’ll be asked to leave, and you won’t receive your deposits back.\n\nRespond to a Situation – Question 2\n\nSample response:\n\nI’m afraid it won’t be possible to complete the report by Wednesday. Could I possibly have until Thursday? I’m sorry for the delay but the sales figures I was expecting to receive today still aren’t available. The team has promised to send me the information tomorrow. As soon as I receive it, I’ll look at the figures and finish the report. If they send me the information tomorrow, I’m confident that I can get the report to you by Thursday.\n\nAnswer Short Question – Question 1\n\nTranscript:\n\nWhat do we call a test by scientists to prove if their idea is correct?\n\nCorrect: (an) experiment\n\nAnswer Short Question – Question 2\n\nTranscript:\n\nWhat do we call someone who buys products from a shop?\n\nCorrect: customer / consumer / shopper\n\nSummarize Written Text – Question 1\n\nSample response:\n\nBarr Green University has decided to change its Business degree to focus more on management, and less on financial subjects. The university wants the degree to contain more of the topics that major companies care most about. By doing this, it hopes students’ career opportunities will improve.\n\nSummarize Written Text – Question 2\n\nSample response:\n\nThe company wants staff to travel to work in ways which cause less pollution and is encouraging employees not to come to work by car. Therefore, the company is offering staff discounts on bicycles and public transport. Also, employees that need to drive should try to share vehicles.\n\nWrite Email – Question 1\n\nSample response:\n\nDear Ms Fletcher,\n\nI am writing to offer some ideas about how we can support our international students.\n\nFirstly, what about organising social activities like a welcome party? This will help international students feel part of the university.\n\nAlso, it can be hard for international students to find accommodation in a city they don’t know. We could help students with this by providing advice before they arrive.\n\nFinally, although international students might know the vocabulary for their studies, they might not know how to communicate in daily situations. Therefore, shall we offer additional language support to these students?\n\nI hope these suggestions are useful. Please let me know if you’d like to discuss them further.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nPeter Hurst\n\nWrite Email – Question 2\n\nSample response:\n\nDear Mr Harrison,\n\nI’m writing because I have some suggestions which might encourage adults to learn a new language.\n\nFirstly, there should be a free public festival which celebrates languages. The festival could offer free beginner classes and organise events to show that learning a foreign language can be interesting.\n\nAlso, the local authority needs to make use of the internet to reach more people. For instance, you could use popular local celebrities to promote language learning.\n\nFinally, most working adults cannot attend language classes during the day. Therefore, how about offering courses at more convenient times, like in the evening?\n\nI feel these suggestions will increase interest in foreign languages.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAnya Martin\n\nPhần 2: READING\n\nReading and Writing: Fill in the Blanks – Question 1\n\nHi Susan,\n\nHow’s your search for student accommodation going? I’ve started looking but I haven’t found anything yet. Everything’s so expensive, isn’t it? Actually, I was wondering whether you’d be interested in sharing a flat with me next term? Most of the accommodation that the university offers is for more than one person so I think we’ll have nicer options to choose from if we decide to share. What do you think?\n\nWe’ve always got on well with each other and we spend a lot of time together anyway, so I think it might be a good solution. And you know that I’m a great cook, too! I know I’m not as good at tidying up as you are, but I promise I’ll keep the flat clean.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think. I’d really like to find a place soon.\n\nCarly\n\nExplanation\n\nyet: ‘yet’ in a negative present perfect sentence shows that something hasn’t happened\n\nbut we think it should happen soon.\n\nwhether: ‘whether’ in a sentence shows that there is a choice to make.\n\nmost: ‘most of’ with a noun shows that we are talking about the largest part of\n\nsomething.\n\nwith: the phrasal verb ‘get on well with’ means that you have a good relationship with\n\nsomeone.\n\nas good: the phrase ‘not as + adjective + as’ compares two things.\n\nReading and Writing: Fill in the Blanks – Question 2\n\nWe all know that regular exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but before you start, for example, running or skiing, your body needs to be ready. Before any type of physical activity or training, I always do several simple exercises to help my body prepare. This usually takes about ten minutes, and I think it makes a huge difference to my training. For instance, before training my lower body, I start with a gentle walk and then I stretch my leg muscles.\n\nWarming up like this also gets me in the right mental state to exercise because it encourages me to focus on my body and how I’m feeling. I’m not sure what scientists say about this but I know that exercise goals are achieved more easily when people are feeling good.\n\nAnd we also need to think about what we do after an exercise session. If you just stop without taking time to cool down and let your body recover, you might feel very sore the next day!\n\nIf you’d like to know more, I’ve created a short video which you can access by clicking the link here.\n\nExplanation\n\nseveral: ‘several’ before plural countable nouns like ‘exercises’ means a quantity which is\n\nmore than just a few, but not a large number.\n\ntraining: after ‘before’, we usually use a gerund (‘training’).\n\non: the verb ‘focus on’ means to ‘pay attention to’ something.\n\nare achieved: the present simple passive (‘are achieved’) is used to show that ‘goals’ is\n\nthe focus of the sentence.\n\nwhich: ‘which’ is used in a defining relative clause to refer to a thing (‘a short video’).\n\nMultiple Choice, Multiple Answers – Question 1\n\nQuestion: The company has decided to move its head office because _____\n\nIncorrect: The email says that the company chose to do its business in Oakhedge because it was cheap, but now it has decided to move. The text does not say that this move will reduce its costs.\n\nCorrect: The email says that the company needs to make changes as it gets bigger, meaning that the decision was taken because it is growing.\n\nIncorrect: Although the email mentions ‘new products’ and starting to do business in a new region, these activities are in addition to the company’s other business activities, so the company has not decided to change to different activities.\n\nIncorrect: The email does not say that the company is planning to move its main factory. Instead, the email says that the company has decided to move its main office to the capital because the factory where most of its products are manufactured is only 15 km away.\n\nCorrect: The email says that the company also thought about ‘environmental issues’. The email says moving to a new building will help the company ‘cut waste and achieve our target of using 100% green energy’. It says this is ‘an important factor in our decision’.\n\nMultiple Choice, Multiple Answers – Question 2\n\nQuestion: Which items does the charity ask people to give?\n\nCorrect: The writer says the charity ‘can never have enough pasta or rice’, which means the charity always needs these items.\n\nIncorrect: The writer says people should not send tins of food because the charity has ‘plenty of those’ and has ‘limited space to store them’.\n\nCorrect: The writer asks people to send items of clothing ‘such as jumpers, coats and gloves’ so that the charity can put these items ‘to good use’.\n\nIncorrect: Although the writer says that the charity only has a ‘basic’ kitchen, the text does not say that the charity requires cooking equipment.\n\nIncorrect: The writer says the charity has ‘plenty of fresh fruit or vegetables’ at the moment. This means the charity does not require these items.\n\nReorder Paragraph – Question 1\n\nCorrect\n\n4, 1, 5, 3, 2\n\nWhen I decided to take a holiday without my friends or family, I felt a bit nervous. However, I soon realised that there were some great advantages to this type of travel. Perhaps the main one was I could do whatever I wanted without thinking about other people’s preferences. For instance, it was so lovely to spend the whole day relaxing on the beach instead of doing all the active things my friends and family usually want to do! At the same time, it also encouraged me to make the effort to talk to new people, and I really enjoyed that.\n\nReorder Paragraph – Question 2\n\nCorrect\n\n2, 5, 1, 4, 3\n\nWhile hot, sunny weather can mean fun days at the beach, many people find high temperatures very hard to deal with. The good news, though, is that you can take some steps to feel more comfortable in the heat. Staying cool starts with drinking enough liquids, especially water with ice. If possible, it’s also a good idea to avoid going out during the hottest part of the day, between 11 a.m. and around 2 p.m. But if you have to be outside, wear loose, light clothes and don’t forget your sunglasses and a cap for extra protection from the sun!\n\nFill in the Blanks – Question 1\n\nAnswers\n\nMany things can make a restaurant popular with customers. For some, getting great service is important because they like feeling welcome and relaxed. The Lemon Tree does this very well. The head waiter gave us excellent menu suggestions and moved us to a quieter area when we complained about the noise. As for the meal, The Lemon Tree serves lovely food using unusual ingredients people don’t expect. For instance, the fruit and chocolate pizza was amazing!\n\nExplanation\n\nservice: in a restaurant, good service can make customers feel ‘welcome and relaxed’\n\nwaiter: in a restaurant, it is the waiter’s job to make suggestions and try to help customers if they complain about something; ‘head water’ is also a common collocation\n\nnoise: the writer says that they moved to a ‘quieter’ part of the restaurant, which means they weren’t happy about the noise\n\nunusual: the writer gives the example of a ‘fruit and chocolate pizza’ to show that The Lemon Tree serves food which includes unusual ingredients because we wouldn’t expect pizza to contain chocolate and fruit\n\nFill in the Blanks – Question 2\n\nAnswers\n\nThe X70 Pro-Phone is our best ever phone. The sound quality is brilliant, especially when the phone is connected to speakers. All X70 Pro-Phone customers have free access to our website where you can listen to albums by your favourite artists. And you can also access them wherever you go if you download them onto your phone. Another great function of the X70 Pro-Phone is its camera, which takes amazing images whether you are new to photography or an expert!\n\nExplanation\n\nspeakers: speakers improve the sound quality when we are listening to music on a phone\n\nartists: we can use the word artists to refer to bands or singers that make music\n\ndownload: when we download music onto a phone, it means we can access it on our\n\nphone\n\nimages: we can use a camera to take images\n\nMultiple Choice, Single Answer – Question 1\n\nQuestion: Which of these is only available during the Bay Centre’s opening day event on June 1st?\n\nCorrect: The writer says the opening day event on June 1st will include a photo competition where people can win prizes.\n\nIncorrect: Although the writer mentions an offer to get a free drink at the Food Court, this offer is available for the whole month, not just during the opening day event, and there is no information about discounts on meals.\n\nIncorrect: The writer says that the special offer for two-for-one cinema tickets will continue throughout the whole month of June, so it is not only available during the opening day event.\n\nIncorrect: The writer says that staff members will wear Bay Centre T-shirts, but does not say that shoppers can receive T-shirts during the opening day event.\n\nMultiple Choice, Single Answer – Question 2\n\nQuestion: What is the text about?\n\nIncorrect: The writer says that some fans had opinions about a player, but not about the event.\n\nIncorrect: Although the writer mentions that a tennis player was ‘faster, fitter and stronger than ever’, the text does not give any information about how the player trained.\n\nCorrect: The text is mainly about how Will Parker performed at the Greenridge Open tennis competition.\n\nIncorrect: Although the writer mentions that the Greenridge Open is a famous tennis event that has existed for ‘eighty years’, the text does not focus on the history of the event.\n\nPhần 3: LISTENING\n\nSummarize Spoken Text – Question 1\n\nTranscript\n\nWhen you think of canal holidays in this country, you might imagine an older couple enjoying a slow trip on the water. It’s true that canal holidays used to be mostly popular with older people, but now a wider range of tourists are choosing them.\n\nThis type of holiday can offer tourists many benefits. For instance, people can certainly relax on a canal holiday so it’s great for people who want to enjoy the peace and quiet with their families.\n\nThe other reason that canal holidays are becoming more popular is that they offer people the opportunity to travel in a different way. Many people find canal holidays very convenient because they use the boat as both transport and accommodation. They can visit new places for the morning or afternoon and then return to the boat and continue their journey. And many people find being on the boat is just as much fun as visiting other places.\n\nWho knows? Maybe in the future canal holidays will become even more common.\n\nSample summary\n\nIn the past, canal trips were usually holidays for older tourists. However, this is changing.\n\nSuch holidays offer peaceful family time and a fun and convenient way to travel.\n\nSummarize Spoken Text – Question 2\n\nTranscript\n\nYou might ask whether we need another health and fitness app when there are already so many available to download. But I’m going to explain why I think you’ll love ‘Whole Health’. I started using it a few weeks ago and I immediately realised that it’s completely different to all the other products on the market.\n\nMost fitness apps focus on improving people’s physical strength. While ‘Whole Health’ has plenty of exercise videos, it also offers far more. It encourages people to take care of their general health in many different ways.\n\nThe app’s sleep function tracks users’ sleep patterns and provides helpful suggestions about how users can improve their sleep routines. This can help users understand more about their sleep habits.\n\nThere are also recipe videos and meal plans to download so that users can make healthier food choices.\n\nAnd the feature I liked the most was the breathing exercises, which taught me how to relax for a few moments when life gets busy.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend ‘Whole Health’.\n\nSample summary\n\nThe ‘Whole Health’ app is different from other apps because it does more than help build\n\nstrength. It also teaches people how to relax, sleep better and eat better.\n\nMultiple Choice, Multiple Answers – Question 1\n\nTranscript\n\nShaun: Right. You realise I have a meeting with the directors tomorrow afternoon? I wanted it done by then.\n\nThiago: I’m really sorry. I’m so busy with other projects at the moment. And Accounts didn’t get back to me with the figures I need …\n\nS: OK. Let me deal with Accounts. And I’ll see if I can get one of the other trainees to share some of your workload. Just for a few days. Does that help?\n\nT: Yes, it helps a lot.\n\nS: Now, what else can we do to get this report finished? What if I bring in Jasmine to help you out?\n\nT: No, no, I can manage.\n\nS: Look, we don’t have much time. Let’s speed things up. How about asking Jasmine to help you with some of the figures?\n\nT: Yes. OK.\n\nS: Good. I’ll give you three more days. But no more. Don’t let me down\n\nAnswers\n\nQuestion: What will the speakers do to get the report ready?\n\nCorrect: Get colleagues to do more work on other projects. The manager suggests that some trainees should do some of the employee’s work on other projects while he focuses on the report, and the employee accepts this suggestion.\n\nIncorrect: Send some information to the Accounts department. The manager says that he will ‘deal with Accounts’ because they need the figures from that department to complete the report, but he doesn’t say that he will send some information to the Accounts department.\n\nIncorrect: Move the directors’ meeting to a later date. Although the manager says he wanted the report to be finished by the directors’ meeting ‘tomorrow afternoon’, he doesn’t say that they should move the meeting to a later date.\n\nIncorrect: Arrange a meeting with the Accounts department to discuss the report. The manager says that he will ‘deal with Accounts’ but he doesn’t say that they should arrange a meeting with the Accounts department to discuss the report. He is referring to a different meeting.\n\nCorrect: Share some of the report work with another colleague. The manager suggests that another colleague, Jasmine, should help the employee with the report. The employee isn’t happy about the suggestion, but he agrees.\n\nMultiple Choice, Multiple Answers – Question 2\n\nTranscript\n\nLooking at my CV you might think I don’t have any relevant experience but I do have experience in managing people. I have to communicate in my job every day, where I’m responsible for a team of forty people, talking to different departments and dealing with difficult customers. I’m good at working under pressure, so you can depend on me to write those reports on time! Err, just a minute … . Another consideration is that I’m a big fan of social media. I write a blog in my free time, although I don’t have that many followers yet. I’m also studying marketing online in the evenings. So, if you hire me, I will help you to find the best solutions for you and your clients.\n\nAnswers\n\nQuestion: What skills does Cindy say she has learnt from her job?\n\nIncorrect: Writing popular blog posts. Cindy says that she enjoys writing blog posts in her free time, not as part of her job, and she says that she doesn’t have ‘many followers yet’, which means we can’t say her blog posts are popular.\n\nCorrect: Managing a team. When talking about her job, Cindy says she has experience in managing people because she is ‘responsible for a team of forty people’ in her job.\n\nIncorrect: Creating marketing plans. Although Cindy says she is interested in marketing, this is something she is studying in the evening, and that might not mean creating marketing plans.

But now of course, the official home used by presidents is over on the other side of the river, and that’s where we’re going now. The decision to move the president’s base was taken for security reasons, but the president at that time also preferred that neighbourhood. And did you know that local people call the president’s palace the silver tent? That should give you some idea of what it looks like if you’ve never seen it before, although personally, I think it looks more like a huge triangle! But you can judge for yourself when we approach the palace from the eastern entrance. That entrance offers the best views.\n\nFill in the Blanks – Question 2\n\nTranscript and answers\n\nOK, let’s discuss our plans for the coming months. And the first thing I’d like to say is that our new collection will be quite different, I mean, some of our current customers may be surprised when they see the items in the store. Therefore, we need to find ways to meet their needs while promoting our items to other customers.\n\nHowever, I’m confident that even if we’re trying to change the image of our store, people will still come to us because of our great customer service. But I think we’ll need to show the new products in a really creative way to get people’s attention. Maybe we could use some kind of theme to do this. What do you think?\n\nMultiple Choice, Single Answer – Question 1\n\nTranscript\n\nIn true dramatic style, our latest production of Brecht’s The Good Person of Szechwan has just been hit by disaster. An electrical fire destroyed the arts centre where we were performing in London and took with it all our costumes and equipment. Fortunately, nobody was in the building at the time and nobody was injured in the fire.\n\nWe know one day the insurance company will eventually pay the compensation to rebuild and replace everything, but we need to complete our world tour now and can’t wait around for the money to arrive. Can you help us? We need to raise €10,000 in the next few weeks to replace everything. I promise all donations to our cause will be repaid when we receive the insurance payout.\n\nAnswers\n\nQuestion: Ben talks about the insurance company to _____\n\nIncorrect: Describe how he will use the money he is asking for. Ben explains that he needs some money to complete his theatre tour, but this is not the reason why he mentions the insurance company.\n\nIncorrect: Complain about his financial problems. Although Ben describes a financial problem that his company has experienced, he does not complain about this, and he doesn’t mention the insurance company for this reason.\n\nIncorrect: Explain why his business costs will increase. Ben mentions that his business needs some money for its theatre tour but he does not say that the insurance company has increased his business costs.\n\nCorrect: Prove that he will be able to pay back the money he is asking for. Ben says that the insurance company will eventually pay him some money to replace the damaged costumes and equipment, and he says that he will repay any money he borrows when he receives the payment from the insurance company. This means he is talking about the insurance company to show that he will be able to pay back the money.\n\nMultiple Choice, Single Answer – Question 2\n\nTranscript\n\nO: You’ve been with us for six months. How do you feel it’s gone so far?\n\nT: I think I’m doing well.

However, I have to point out some areas for development. It’s important to give what we call ‘corrective’ feedback. To support you in your professional development.\n\nAnswers\n\nQuestion: Why does the woman talk about the Miami conference?\n\nIncorrect: To suggest a professional goal that the employee should aim for in the future. The woman uses the past tense to talk about the Miami conference, so she is not referring to a future situation.\n\nCorrect: To give an example of the employee’s ability to work well with others. The woman mentions how the employee gave support to his colleague after the Miami conference and says that this was an example of his ‘good interpersonal skills’. ‘Good interpersonal skills’ means the employee works well with others.\n\nIncorrect: To show how the employee’s knowledge of technology has improved.

Number one: choose your topic carefully and don’t be too negative. Don’t talk about personal finances, politics or religion, or more personal topics. Be prepared to listen and remember to show interest in the other person and their opinions. Showing interest is simple. If you’re sitting down, move your body forward a little, use eye contact and of course, smile as you speak. Watch the other person’s body language and if they start to look bored, (change the subject).\n\nAnswers\n\nIncorrect: Tell the truth. The speaker is talking about how to show interest in another person during a conversation, but does not suggest that you should do this by always being honest.\n\nIncorrect: Speak more slowly. The speaker is talking about how to show interest during a conversation, but she does not suggest that speaking fast or slowly can affect this.\n\nCorrect: Change the subject. The speaker is talking about how it’s important to choose the right topic during a conversation and show interest in the other person, so if they look bored, changing the subject shows that you are interested in their feelings.\n\nIncorrect: Repeat what you said. The speaker is talking about how to show interest in another person during a conversation, and what to do when they look bored, but she does not suggest that repeating things will stop the other person feeling bored.\n\nHighlight Incorrect Words – Question 1\n\nTranscript\n\nRegular listeners of this show will know that I prefer watching serious films because they offer viewers the chance to understand some very interesting themes.
