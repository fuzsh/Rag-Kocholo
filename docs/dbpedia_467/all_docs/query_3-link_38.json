She later switched her interest to Medicinal Chemistry and earned her Ph.D. under the guidance of Prof. Won-Jea Cho from Chonnam National University, South Korea, in 2012. Her doctoral research was focused on the design and development of novel small molecule compounds targeting Androgen Receptor, Topoisomerase, or JAK/STAT pathway for treating cancers. In research, she used to apply computational techniques such as virtual screening or molecular docking, synthesize various chemical libraries, and optimize the active compounds.\n\nDr. Yang moved to the University of Michigan where she conducted research as postdoctoral fellow with Prof. Nouri Neamati, working on synthesis of bioactive small molecule compounds as anti-cancer agents (2013-2017). Dr. Yang joined the faculty of the American University of Health Sciences as an Assistant Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, in August 2018. Her current research interests are the design and development of small molecule compounds as chemotherapeutic agents and the use of photoaffinity probes for identification of the molecular targets of small molecules.\n\nSelected Publications\n\n1.

He also obtained an MPH at Harvard School of Public Health, & after 20 years at Harvard, became a professor of pathology & pharmacology at the Medical School of University of California, Irvine (UCI), CA. He also served as chief of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service for 20 years, of which for 12 years also covered the functions of chief of staff at the VA Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, where he continued his productive research in the molecular mechanisms of stress-related diseases, esp., gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration. His laboratory was the first to publish easily reproducible, chemically induced duodenal ulcers & adrenal necrosis in rats. This was followed by structure-activity studies (SAS) with chemicals that induce duodenal ulcers which is the most frequent form of peptic ulcers in patients. These SAS led to the first recognition of dopamine in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration in animal models & man. Subsequently, he demonstrated for the first time the potent ulcer healing effect of angiogenic growth factors which on molar basis 2-7 million times more potent than antisecretory or anti-H. pylori drugs. His laboratory also published the first gene expression & gene therapy results in duodenal ulceration.\n\nSo far, he has 235 original, peer-review publications (several in the best scientific journals like Nature, Science, PNAS, BBRC, JAMA, Lancet, J. Clin. Invest., Lab. Invest., Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Am. J. Pathol., J. Pharm. Sci., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.), 55 review articles, 37 book chapters, 5 books edited, & 241 invited lectures in North America, Europe, Asia & Australia as well as 9 approved patents, mostly for new GI ulcer drugs & one pending application. In teaching activities, he was course director for general pathology at Harvard Medical School & was teaching GI & endocrine pathology as well as courses in public health & toxicology at Harvard & UCI.\n\nHe was associate master at one of the 5 student academic societies at Harvard Medical School (i.e., at Peabody Society) & initiated the establishment of similar student academic societies at UCI to promote small-group teaching & flip classroom techniques. In 2013 he initiated the annual week-long international Summer Schools on Stress (https://www.stresseducation.org ) that has been held at various universities over the world, e.g., Hungary, Croatia, France, Slovakia, Japan & Russia.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nSelye H, Szabo S.
