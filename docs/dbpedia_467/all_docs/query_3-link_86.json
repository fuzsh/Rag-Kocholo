        "text": "Topic 1: Names\n\nCâu hỏi: Who gave you your name?\n\nTraditionally, in Vietnam, the names of new-born children are given by one of their relatives, usually their grandparents. However, in my case, an acquaintance of my parents came up with my name, and mom and dad just instantly agreed, because neither of them had any idea what to name me.\n\nCâu hỏi: Does your name have any particular (or, special) meaning?\n\nMost Vietnamese names do, I suppose, and mine is not an exception. My name can be interpreted as a river in Autumn. In my country, anything related to Autumn is considered beautiful and calm, since this season is the most comfortable one out of the four. So, I assume my parents did have somewhat an expectation when they named me that.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like your name?\n\nIn the past, no. I used to blame my parents for giving me such a boyish name. I even had a deep, warm voice, just like a mature man, which is why all of my classmates made fun of me back in primary and secondary school. However, as I’ve grown older, I just don’t take these jokes so serious anymore, so I guess it’s fair to say yes.\n\nCâu hỏi: In your country, do people feel that their names are very important?\n\nThere’s no doubt about it. In Vietnam, names are not only a means of identification. They also deliver parents hopes and expectations when a new child is born. Besides, many Vietnamese believe that names are blessings for newborns, so most people would consider their names a lucky charm for them.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you like to change your name?\n\nNo, I wouldn’t do that, because there are tons of things I would have to do and all kinds of forms to fill in to get a new name. Besides, this thing makes no sense to me. Unless somebody’s a criminal and wants to change their whole identity, there’s no point getting a whole new name.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is it easy to change your name in your country?\n\nI would say you can change it, but I’m not very sure if the procedures are easy because I’ve never known anyone who tried to do such a thing. However, I do think the paperwork required would be quite complicated and the whole process may cost you a lot of time.\n\nCâu hỏi: Who usually names babies in your country?\n\nAs I’ve mentioned earlier, in most cases, grandparents would name their children’s babies. Sometimes, a name is also given by a person who’s done a special favor for the baby’s family, or a close relative.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you have any special traditions about naming children?\n\nWell, I can’t come up with anything, honestly. Maybe there were some in my grandparents’ generation, but we millennials don’t seem to acknowledge any of these traditions.\n\nCâu hỏi: What names are the most common in your hometown?\n\nI’m definitely not an anthropologist, so I have no statistics on names. But I would say names that start with an M are, for sure, very popular. It’s easy to explain. The first word a baby can make is, in most cases, ‘momma’, so I bet the M sound is very easy to pronounce. That’s why people tend to unintentionally name their babies like that.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is your name common or unusual in your country?\n\nIf someone shouts my name on any crowded streets at any time of the day, I’m sure more than 5 people will turn their heads back to find out who’s calling them. So, basically, my name is very popular in Vietnam.\n\nTopic 2: Accommodation\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you live in a house or an apartment?\n\nI live in a flat in a 25-storey apartment building with my family. I enjoy my life there, because all facilities and services are available within walking distance, which means I can easily grab anything I need in just a few minutes.\n\nCâu hỏi: What is your favorite room in your home? Why?\n\nDefinitely my own bedroom. It’s the personal space where I can do whatever I want without getting scolded by my mom. Besides, my bedroom is an ideal place for me to avoid noise, so I tend to lock myself up in my bedroom whenever I need to concentrate on my study.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you change anything about your home? Why / why not?\n\nWell, perhaps I would expand the dining area. It is the common space for family members to\n\ngather, so I think it would be nice if my house’s dining room could be a little more spacious.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you like to move to a different home in the future?\n\nAlthough my current accommodation is perfectly fine, I would love to experience living in a villa once. Since it was my childhood dream to have a swimming pool and a garden of my own, a villa seems like an ideal house for me.\n\nCâu hỏi: How is your apartment decorated?\n\nMy home is styled in a minimal way. Almost everything is painted in plain white, and a few landscape paintings act as a delicate touch. The interior design is simple, but very pleasant to look at.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you plan to live there for a long time?\n\nMy answer would be yes. I have nothing to complain about with my current accommodation. Everything is up to par, from the neighbours to the vicinity to amenities. That’s why my family has no intention of leaving this wonderful neighbourhood.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you have a garden?\n\nUnfortunately, no. There is not enough space for a garden in our flat, but I would love to have one in the future. I think every household needs a green space, not only because it is aesthetically pleasing, but also because it is a good way to get in touch with the natural world.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are there many amenities near your home?\n\nMy house is located in a residential complex, so everything is within reach. There is a gym, a park, as well as a wide variety of shops, which are more than enough to cater for all residents in my area.\n\nTopic 3: Work/Study\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you work or study?\n\nWell, I’m working as a teacher at an English centre which specializes in teaching IELTS, mostly for teenagers and adults. Honestly speaking, it’s a demanding and challenging job.\n\nCâu hỏi: Why did you choose that job?\n\nFrankly speaking, my major at university had nothing to do with what I’m doing at the moment. I selected this job mainly because it suits my personality as a sociable and friendly person. Besides, my boss offered me a high salary.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are there lots of English teachers in Ho Chi Minh City?\n\nWell, recently, working as an English teacher has gained popularity among youngsters in Vietnam in general and in HCM city in particular. So yeah, I guess I could say they are here, there and everywhere.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you enjoy your job?\n\nDespite its heavy workload and strict requirements, I still find it satisfying since it facilitates me in the process of my self-development. I have experienced a great transformation in myself ever since I got this job.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you get on well with your co-workers?\n\nWell, I guess the answer is yes. This is because we have a lot of things in common. You know, we are nearly the same age as each other and are all crazy about board games and travelling.\n\nCâu hỏi: What was your first day at work like?\n\nWell, I have been working there for more than 2 years, so it’s quite difficult for me to remember clearly my first day at work, but from my vague memory, it was fantastic since my colleagues were really nice to get along with and the students were pretty bright.\n\nCâu hỏi: What responsibilities do you have at work?\n\nAs a teacher, I’m in charge of teaching English for a group of around ten pupils and making sure that they reach their target band scores by the end of the course. I also work in a team with other co-workers to design the material for our courses.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you like to change your job in the future?\n\nAs I said before, I’m very satisfied with my job, so I guess in the future I will still stick with it. Right now, I’m doing a master’s degree in teaching, which I think will assist my career a lot. So, you see, there is no reason for me to quit.\n\nCâu hỏi: What is your typical day like at work?\n\nWell, normally my work day won’t start until the afternoon since I often have to attend my own classes at university in the morning. My first class lasts for 2 hours, from 2 to 4 pm and then I have a two – hour break before having another class at 6:30 and finally get everything done at around 9 pm. To be honest, I find this schedule quite exhausting but I can still handle it.\n\nCâu hỏi: What would you like to change about your job?\n\nThis job offers me everything I need, so I don’t think it requires any improvements.\n\nTopic 4: Hometown\n\nCâu hỏi: What kind of place is it?\n\nMy hometown is Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. As one of the main metropolises in my country, it is a densely populated area and faces traffic congestion all the time.\n\nCâu hỏi: What’s the most interesting part of your hometown?\n\nI suppose it might be the Old Quarter, the most ancient part of my city. If people, especially foreign tourists come here, they will have a chance to immerse themselves in a combination of traditional and contemporary architecture, which they can hardly find in other regions of Hanoi.\n\nCâu hỏi: What kind of jobs do people in your town/ village do?\n\nAs I said before, my hometown is the capital of Vietnam, so there is a wide range of jobs for people, including blue-collar and white-collar jobs.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is your hometown changing?\n\nYes, of course, every day. Our government invests so much in Hanoi’s economic growth. The public transport system is being upgraded and skyscrapers are springing up like mushrooms.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you say it is a good place to live in? Why?\n\nDon’t get me wrong, but Hanoi is not a good place to settle down. To be honest, I think people get really sick and tired of its hustle and bustle. Living here means people have accepted to face health problems every day. Being stuck in traffic jams and breathing in polluted air on a daily basis is detrimental to their mental and physical health.\n\nCâu hỏi: What changes would you like to make to your hometown?\n\nIf I could make a change for the better, I would adopt some solutions to control population growth in Hanoi, like imposing limitations on immigrants. Also, I would find more ways to reduce traffic jams.\n\nCâu hỏi: What are the advantages of living in your hometown?\n\nLet’s me see. Street food is the first thing that comes to my mind. Hanoi is famous for its yummy street food, so one of the benefits of living here is the chance to immerse in its special cuisine. Another thing is the nightlife. People will never feel bored in Hanoi, with different places to chill out at night, such as bars, clubs and juke joints.\n\nCâu hỏi: What are some problems that your hometown is faced with?\n\nActually there are so many. But the most pressing issue is air pollution, I suppose. You know, the air is severely polluted due to a massive amount of exhaust fumes released from private vehicles into the atmosphere every day. People living in Hanoi also suffer from unhygienic food, a major cause of sickness and disease. Almost everything in Hanoi is served at roadside stalls and most do not have clean settings.\n\nCâu hỏi: Compare your hometown with a nearby\n\nCompared to Hung Yen, a neighbouring town of Hanoi, my hometown’s economy is more developed. However, Hung Yen’s got fresh air and lots of natural scenery, which children in Hanoi rarely have a chance to enjoy.\n\nCâu hỏi: What are some environmental problems in your hometown?\n\nOne serious environmental problem we are facing is tons of non-biodegradable plastic waste. Even though the government has conducted several educational campaigns to raise the public’s awareness, the residents still use plastic products every single day and unintentionally destroy the environment.\n\nTopic 5: App\n\nCâu hỏi: What kinds of apps do you often use?\n\nCommunication apps like Facebook, Viber and Zalo are what I cannot do without. I use them on an hourly basis to stay in touch with the world. To me, using these apps is no longer a hobby, but more like a habit now.\n\nCâu hỏi: What kinds of apps would you like to have in the future?\n\nI am trying to think of one, but nothing comes to mind at the moment. Perhaps it’s because in this era of information, there is an app for just about anything. Even the simplest tasks like booking a taxi or ordering food can be facilitated by mobile applications.\n\nCâu hỏi: What’s the most popular app in your country?\n\nFacebook is no doubt the most frequently used app in Vietnam. I would say the biggest reason is its user-friendly layout. Besides, Facebook has created such a solid virtual community that people just can’t help but use it.\n\nCâu hỏi: What was the first app you used?\n\nI don’t remember precisely, but one of the first apps I installed on my smart phone was Google maps. I relied on it a lot, and I still do now, since it helps me get around the city by showing the shortest route.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do old people in your country like to use apps?\n\nBased on my observation, I would say no. Most old people in my country are technology illiterate, which means they can’t even use a normal cell phone, not to mention complicated mobile apps.\n\nTopic 6: Sleep\n\nCâu hỏi: How many hours do you sleep every day?\n\nWell, it actually depends on my work deadlines. I never go to bed at the same time every day. Whenever I work to meet a deadline, I have to stay up until ungodly hours and just get 4 or 5 hours sleep. However, at the weekend, I can let my hair down and sleep in.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is it necessary to take a nap every day?\n\nYes, definitely. I think taking a nap is a way for people to recharge their battery after working hard in the morning. A 30-minute sleep would be enough to refresh their energy.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do old people sleep a lot? Why?\n\nYes, I suppose. I mean, somehow these people enjoy sleeping, but in most cases, they have to. When people reach an old age, they often face loads of health problems such as heart disease or diabetes. Therefore, taking a deep sleep is beneficial to their health.\n\nCâu hỏi: How to have a good sleep?\n\nI guess people have different ways to get a sound sleep. But if you ask me, I would say that drinking chamomile tea before you go to bed is really effective. This type of tea will calm you down and let you sleep easily.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like to get up early in the morning?\n\nActually, I’m a night owl and getting up early is like torture to me. I love sleeping in and will never get out of bed before 11 a.m.\n\nCâu hỏi: Can you sleep well if you are in a noisy environment?\n\nDefinitely no. To be honest, I’m a light sleeper and noisy places will destroy my night. I may\n\ngo through a night of broken sleep and feel exhausted the next morning.\n\nCâu hỏi: How many hours do you sleep at night?\n\nI wish I could spend 7 or 8 hours sleeping. But unfortunately, I have to deal with a heavy workload and only get about 4 hours sleep.\n\nCâu hỏi: What time do you go to bed?\n\nAround 1 or 2 a.m. As I said before, I’m always up to my ears in work so I often stay up late to finish my tasks.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you have a nap during the day?\n\nIt really depends. At the weekend, when I get off work, I often take a nap for around 20 minutes before hanging out with my besties. But during weekdays, I’m just as busy as a bee.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think sleep is important?\n\nYes, of course. From my perspective, sleeping plays an important role in people’s physical health. It’s the time for our body to take a rest after a long day. A good night’s sleep also helps us release our emotions and forget all the bad things that happened during the day.\n\nTopic 7: Leisure time\n\nCâu hỏi: What do you do in your spare time?\n\nIt varies, I mean, it depends on the amount of free time I have. A few weeks ago, I would normally immerse myself in a light novel during lunch breaks or after dinner, but these days, I’m just too busy with my work that the only thing I crave is some sleep, so all my spare time would be devoted to taking a quick nap.\n\nCâu hỏi: What do you do to relax?\n\nThese days, I’ve been suffering from severe stress and depression due to the excessive amount of workload I have, and the only time I can relax is during my 4 – 5 hours of sleep every night. So, it may sound a little bit weird, but the only thing I can do to relax is, sadly, sleep.\n\nCâu hỏi: How do you usually spend your weekends?\n\nI’m not a party animal, so during weekends, I always refuse all the party invitations from my friends. Instead, I would visit a café on my own and indulge myself with a nice cup of earl grey and some new book I’ve found on Amazon. That couldn’t be more perfect for a Sunday afternoon.\n\nCâu hỏi: What do you usually do after work or classes?\n\nI work evening shifts, so on a daily basis, I stop at around 9 p.m. and leave work 15 – 30 minutes later. At that time, most shops have already closed and there’re not many recreational activities left to do if you don’t want to hang around bars, so I often go straight home to take a hot shower and have a late dinner. Once in a while, my boyfriend would take me to the movies after work, but I would fall asleep half way through the film.\n\nCâu hỏi: How much time do you have each week for doing these things?\n\nIf your asking for a specific number of hours, I guess I’d have to say just a couple of hours per\n\nday probably.\n\nCâu hỏi: Why do you like doing these activities?\n\nI don’t. I mean… who would like to go back home right after work just to have a late, cold, and sometimes leftover dinner? That’s just what I have to do since I have to work until late in the evening. I’m not allowed to choose, that’s the problem.\n\nCâu hỏi: How did you start doing this activity at first?\n\nActually, my life didn’t used to revolve around work. A few years ago I used to lead quite a busy social life, back in university, so it took me a whole year to get used to my current lifestyle. So, I think everything has just become a routine to me now. Not in a natural way, but it has.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is there some other hobby or sport you would like to try? Why?\n\nI’m crazy about music and all kinds of musical instruments. It’s such a miracle how each instrument makes a different sound, but when they’re performed together, they can create perfect combinations of melodies. Perhaps, in the near future, I would learn about the mechanism behind this miracle. This is also a hobby, isn’t it?\n\nCâu hỏi: How do you spend your time in the evening?\n\nIt’s the same every day. I just keep running around in circles: going to work, coming back home, working at home, then going back to work the next morning. That’s why the evening is, somehow, just another chance for me to satisfy my workaholic self. That’s it.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you prefer staying at home or going out during evenings?\n\nIt’s like an everyday dilemma. My heart always insists me to go out and have some fun, but my mind would say no to that seemingly irrational idea. Well, my deadlines are there, my work isn’t finished. So, most of the time, I would reluctantly stay home.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you do this every evening?\n\nI hate to admit, but yes, every evening when I have work left unfinished. Sometimes, I’ve even done all my make-up and already gotten dressed. However, while waiting for my boyfriend to pick me up, I often change my mind and go back to my work instead.\n\nCâu hỏi: What do you like to do on the weekends?\n\nAs I’ve mentioned earlier, I’m quite a loner and I really enjoy that part of myself. So, during weekends, I would usually find something to do on my own, like redecorating my room, going to a café all alone, or just find a quiet spot in my house to do some crosswords and quizzes. I just really love to enjoy time by myself.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is there any difference in your life now from when you were a child?\n\nThis is an intriguing question, since I honestly don’t know what to tell you. But overall, my life has changed considerably compared to what it was throughout my childhood. Everything, from my feelings, my thoughts to my relationships or accommodation, is so different now that I nearly have no recollections about the past.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think modern lifestyles give people enough time for leisure?\n\nIt’s hard to say. Nowadays, people can have access to more and more entertainment facilities, and these facilities can accommodate our demands for recreation at any time. That’s why it’s become harder to distinguish between working hours and leisure time, which means you can’t really tell whether the current lifestyles can give people an adequate amount of time for leisure.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think people today have more time to relax compared to the past?\n\nWe do have more time to relax now compared with the amount we had in the past thanks to a great number of technological advances, which are gradually replacing people’s involvement in many fields. However, many people now are refusing to take a break, perhaps because they just don’t want to be made redundant in the modern society.\n\nCâu hỏi: What do you think is the importance of leisure time in life?\n\nAdequate and frequent leisure time keeps our lives balanced. What I mean is if we just stay focused on our work and study without proper relaxation, we would eventually find ourselves exhausted and may suffer from all kinds of mental conditions related to stress, like depression or bipolar disorder. So, I do believe that leisure time plays an integral part in people’s lives.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think old and young people spend their leisure time in the same way?\n\nUnfortunately, no. Family bonds would be strengthened significantly if this happened in real life. However, it’s no surprise that the youth and the elderly hardly ever share the same interests due to the huge generation gap, so there’s no chance they would do the same thing\n\nin their spare time. You’re most likely to find youngsters on their phones, and on the other hand, old people would often be found doing some conventional activities for leisure like playing chess or knitting.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like to travel in holidays?\n\nAs long as it’s a long holiday, for example, Tet, or summer holiday. I just honestly don’t want\n\nto go away for just 2 – 3 days because that would leave me no time to enjoy myself.\n\nCâu hỏi: If you had a child, what leisure places would you go with your child?\n\nWell, I know children are often crazy about amusement parks and if I had children I suppose they would definitely beg me to take them there. Unfortunately, I can’t stand crowded and noisy places, so maybe instead of that, I would take my kids to some leafy area, like a national park or botanic gardens, where we could discover more about nature.\n\nTopic 8: Daily routine\n\nCâu hỏi: What is the busiest part of the day for you?\n\nI am a procrastinator, so I tend to get extremely busy at night, when all my work piles up. I love working at those hours though, because no motivation is as good as the urge to sleep.\n\nCâu hỏi: What part of your day do you like best?\n\nMy favourite time of the day would be 7 p.m., which is when I come back from work and gather around the dinner table with my family. Seeing them after a long hard-working day can help me feel recharged, so I look forward to this time of the day the most.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you usually have the same routine every day?\n\nI used to, back when I was still a student. Now that I have started working, I don’t have a fixed schedule anymore. Since my working time is quite flexible, there are days I can just sleep in, but there are also days I have to wake up really early in the morning.\n\nCâu hỏi: What is your daily routine?\n\nMy daily activities depend on my work schedule, so nothing is fixed. The only routine I never skip is writing in a diary, which gives me time to reflect on my day.\n\nCâu hỏi: Have you ever changed your routine?\n\nYes, lately I am trying to change my sleeping habit. In the past, I pulled a lot of all-nighters, and would often doze off in class during the day. These days, I force myself to go to bed early, and you know what, I have never felt so refreshed in the morning!\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think it is important to have a daily routine?\n\nI honestly think it is essential to have a daily routine. Human bodies have a biological clock that works according to routine. By sticking to that fixed schedule, we can prevent our body from getting shock.\n\nCâu hỏi: What would you like to change in your daily routine?\n\nIf time permits, I would love to make exercise a part of my daily routine. It’s not like I am not aware of the wonders exercise can do to my health, I just can’t seem to fit a workout into my tight schedule.\n\nTopic 9: Color\n\nCâu hỏi: What’s your favourite colour?\n\nMy preference varies for different purposes. For example, when choosing clothes, I tend to go for blue, since blue goes well with my skin tone. For house decorations, I would prefer white as it creates a peaceful vibe for the room.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are there any colours you dislike (Why?)\n\nI am not a fan of brown. All shades of brown look sort of dull to me. In terms of fashion, it is really hard to put on a brown item, unless you are extremely gorgeous.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are colours important to you?\n\nTo me personally, colours are indeed important. Not only can colours make our life more vivid, they can also indicate feelings. For instance, I often wear yellow clothing when my mood is up, but go for black if I am feeling down.\n\nCâu hỏi: Were colours important to you when you were a child?\n\nThey were definitely more important to me than they are now. When I was small, I used to judge objects by their colour, like pink stuff was for girls, while blue things were for boys. As I grew up, I realized that things are a lot more complicated, and that colours don’t matter that much.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are there any colours that have a special meaning in your country?\n\nIn my country, almost all colours are associated with something. Take red as an example, red symbolizes happy events, like victories or weddings. In contrast, black is seen as the colour of death, which explains why Vietnamese people often wear black clothes to funerals.\n\nCâu hỏi: What colour would you choose to paint the walls of your room?\n\nI am a big fan of simplicity, so white is my go-to colour when it comes to choosing wall paint. Scientists have proved that white can make a room seem more spacious. Plus, looking at this colour will help us to ease our mind.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think different types of people like different colours?\n\nIn my view, a person’s favourite colour does not necessarily reflect his or her personality. In fact, it really is up to one’s own preference, so we should not make any assumptions just through people’s choice of colour.\n\nTopic 10: Dictionary\n\nCâu hỏi: How often do you use your dictionary?\n\nCountless times a day, and seven days a week, I have to say. I work as an English teacher, and in my working environment, I encounter new or strange word combinations all the time, so that’s why I always need a dictionary by my side.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like paper dictionary or electronic dictionary?\n\nEither of them sound fine to me. The paper version is quite original, but I’m not very keen on the idea of carrying a heavy, thick book here and there just to look up some words occasionally. I’d much rather use the built-in dictionary in my kindle e-book reader, so that I wouldn’t have to bring too many things with me.\n\nCâu hỏi: What kinds of dictionaries have you used before?\n\nThere are several types of dictionaries: paperback, electronic, built-in, online, monolingual, bilingual, or even multi-lingual, and perhaps I’ve tried every single one of them. Each version has its own special features, but technically, they all serve the same purpose.\n\nCâu hỏi: How will dictionaries change in the future?\n\nActually, many different prospects have come to mind, but I believe the most possible one is what I would call ‘dictionary implantation’. It’s indeed a little bit scary, but just think about it: you can instantly learn a new language just by having a minor operation. How cool is that?\n\nTopic 11: Season\n\nCâu hỏi: What’s your favourite season?\n\nThat’s summer. I am really into sunbathing at the beach and eating ice. These activities make\n\nme feel more alive after shivering with cold for so long during the winter.\n\nCâu hỏi: What do people in your country like to do in different seasons?\n\nWell, in summer, Vietnamese people tend to take part in water sports, which helps them to cool down. In contrast, they often stay indoors and drink hot chocolate to keep themselves warm through winter.\n\nCâu hỏi: What’s the least favourite season in your country?\n\nI guess it is summer even though it is my favourite season. Most people don’t like soaking with sweat. Besides, Vietnamese women are obsessed with pale complexion, so they always worry about being tanned in summer.\n\nCâu hỏi: What are the differences between different seasons?\n\nI think the biggest difference is the temperature. While summer has a higher temperature, around 35 degrees, winter is colder with temperatures between 5 – 15 degrees. In different seasons, people also pick different types of clothes. They love wearing light clothes during summer, while in winter, the use of woollen clothes increases.\n\nCâu hỏi: What season is good for travelling in your hometown?\n\nIt is definitely summer. This is when children get off school and families can spend time together. Besides, it is also suitable for most types of activities, from energetic activities to relaxing ones. That’s why summer is the best choice for travelling.\n\nTopic 12: Volunteer\n\nCâu hỏi: Why do you think people volunteer?\n\nI believe each person has his or her own motives when signing up for voluntary work. Some want to offer their help to people that are less fortunate in life, while others just look for memorable experiences. Oddly enough, some individuals volunteer to earn certificates as a way of polishing their CVs, so they would have a better chance of being accepted when applying for jobs or scholarships.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you like to work as a volunteer?\n\nCurrently, I don’t. I’m too busy finding out a way to balance my life and my work, so if there is an occasion when I have time for myself, I’d rather use that time on entertainment activities rather than some other kind of work.\n\nCâu hỏi: Have you ever done any voluntary work?\n\nNo, I haven’t. As I said earlier, all those work-life things pretty much occupy my mind, so I have never considered volunteering as a way of spending my days in the past.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is volunteering worth the time it takes?\n\nI think it depends on your schedule. If you have a lot of spare time, then signing up for voluntary work is a good idea since you can easily broaden your social circle and have a great time helping out other people. On the other hand, if your work costs a lot of time and is causing you troubles, then you’d better focus on that aspect before thinking about volunteering.\n\nCâu hỏi: What could you do to help if you had no money?\n\nThere’s plenty of things you could do. For example, donating clothing or serving free food in a soup kitchen are great ways to help out people in need. Or else, you can sign up for a volunteering program in need of manpower.\n\nCâu hỏi: What situations need voluntary workers?\n\nWell, in my country, when a charity organization needs manpower to distribute supplies of food and clothes to people in disaster areas, they would recruit volunteers. Or else, places like a soup kitchen where poor people come to get free food always need voluntary workers to keep things in order.\n\nCâu hỏi: Can you think of different types of voluntary work?\n\nNo, sorry. Nothing comes to mind right now. I guess that’s because I lack real-life experience\n\nin doing voluntary work so I don’t have an in-depth understanding about this aspect.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you volunteer to help people outside your community?\n\nI think I would. Some of my friends, who do voluntary work regularly, told me that they always had an immense feeling of satisfaction after contributing to something that a lot of people can benefit from. So, if people need help, no matter where they are, I would like to lend them a hand.\n\nCâu hỏi: Have you read a book about voluntary work?\n\nNo, I haven’t. In all honesty, I don’t even know that kind of book actually exists until you asked me. I suppose they are about fascinating experiences that the authors had when they did voluntary work, which sounds pretty intriguing to me. So, I think I might try check one out after I leave this room.\n\nCâu hỏi: What types of voluntary work would be unpleasant for you?\n\nI think I don’t like doing anything I have not been fully trained to do. There were a few times in the past when I was thrown into group activities with no preparation, and then the leaders didn’t show up and suddenly I was in charge, with no real training or help. Those situations brought me terrible feelings.\n\nCâu hỏi: What benefits other than personal satisfaction could you personally get by volunteering?\n\nFirst of all, volunteering can give you tons of valuable work experience and, in some cases, open doors for potential employment. Moreover, you will get to work with other people outside your usual sphere of contacts. This, in turn, allows you to expand your social circle, which, in my opinion, will greatly benefit your life in the future.\n\nTopic 13: School\n\nCâu hỏi: How old were you when you started school?\n\nI began my formal education at the age of six. I studied in a small local primary school and that was my only choice back then because that was the only school in town. To be honest, the authorities in my hometown didn’t care much about children’s education.\n\nCâu hỏi: How did you get to school each day?\n\nWell, normally, my father or mother would drive me to school. But sometimes, when they were occupied with their jobs, they would just ask a relative, or even an acquaintance to take me instead. People really trusted each other back then.\n\nCâu hỏi: Tell me something about your\n\nWell, it was located only 10 minutes away from my house, so I was never late for class. And because it was a school for gifted students, the competition was fierce, which, somehow, was a great source of motivation for me to try my best in studying.\n\nCâu hỏi: Did you enjoy it? (Why?/Why not?)\n\nYes, I did. As I said earlier, my school was extremely close to my house so I wasted no energy on travelling. Moreover, all teachers were wonderfully supportive and always available to help me with my problems.\n\nCâu hỏi: What were some of the most popular activities at primary school?\n\nWell, at that time, mostly children played together in the playground. Besides studying in class, sometimes we had ceremonies to commemorate national heroes who died fighting for our country’s freedom. These events often included a singing contest, which I enjoyed tremendously.\n\nCâu hỏi: Have you ever returned to see your old school again?\n\nWell, in all honesty, ever since I graduated from primary school, I never had a chance to go back. My old school has been reconstructed, so it might be significantly different now from the one I knew. However, I’m planning to visit it in the near future with some old friends, and I bet that will be amazing.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are you still in contact with any of the friends you had in primary school?\n\nYes, but not so many. This is mainly because most of my childhood friends have left town to find career opportunities in other parts of the country. I rarely go back home, but when I do, there are still some friends from primary school that I contact and we always have wonderful time together.\n\nTopic 14: Swimming\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like swimming?\n\nYes, especially in summer. I love immersing myself in cold water to get me in good shape. Somehow, I also have a feeling that swimming gives me a chance to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nCâu hỏi: Where do (or can) people go swimming in your hometown (or, near your home)?\n\nIt may sound strange, but people in my hometown often swim in the Red River, which makes them feel close to nature. It is a popular outdoor activity and people do this on a daily basis, even though they may possibly drown.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is swimming very popular in your country?\n\nYes. You know, Vietnam has a very long coastline, so Vietnamese people often learn how to swim when they are small. However, they are not trained professionally at school, they just learn from mimicking their father or siblings. This leads to the tragic fact that thousands of children drown each year.\n\nCâu hỏi: Why do many people like swimming?\n\nI’m not sure but most people around me enjoy swimming because it helps them keep fit and\n\ncool down on boiling hot days.\n\nCâu hỏi: What do you think are the benefits of swimming (or, the benefits of knowing how to swim)?\n\nFirst, knowing how to swim definitely helps me to protect myself, especially when I’m near the beach, and maybe even save someone else’s life.\n\nTopic 15: Meal/Eat out\n\nCâu hỏi: What kinds of meals do you like?\n\nI love brunch. It’s definitely unhealthy, I know, but this kind of meal saves me quite a lot of time for a longer sleep in the morning, which I really desire.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you often have dinner with your family or friends?\n\nWell, I live far away from home, so I don’t usually have a meal with my family. Instead, I always dine out with some of my close friends. Honestly, one can hardly ever see me eating alone.\n\nCâu hỏi: When do you usually have dinner?\n\nI usually have my work finished at around 9 p.m., so it’s likely that my dinner will start at about 9:30. It’s quite late, I know, and I’m attempting to rearrange my schedule to make it easier to have an earlier dinner.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are there any fruits or vegetables you don’t like? Why?\n\nWell, I’m a hearty eater, so basically, I can eat nearly all kinds of food. However, there is a sort of fruit that I really detest. It is durian and the reason is pretty simple – I can’t bear its terrible taste and smell.\n\nCâu hỏi: And what is your favourite cuisine?\n\nIt’s kind of weird but I’m a die-hard fan of Vietnamese cuisine. It seems like I will never get tired of eating dishes like Pho or spring rolls. The taste, smell and texture of all the ingredients in these dishes are perfect to my taste buds.\n\nTopic 16: Boat\n\nCâu hỏi: Have you ever travelled by boat?\n\nYes, I’ve been on a boat so many times. If my memory serves me well, the first time I ever set foot on a boat was in my first year of high school when my family went on a cruise in Ha Long Bay. It was a truly amazing experience for me.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you often travel by boat?\n\nWell, not really often, maybe once or twice a year. I live in a mountainous area, so I only got on boats and yachts in my summer vacation when I go to the beach.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are boat trips popular in your country?\n\nYes, they are. My country has an extremely long coastline, so journeys at sea are really common. Tourists to any beach always have plenty of options of boats to get on, they are all affordable and offer wonderful sightseeing experiences.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you like to have your own boat?\n\nI’d love to. I have been dreaming of owning a yacht ever since my first trip on water. It doesn’t have to be a huge boat, but it must be tough enough to withstand the most hazardous weather so that I don’t have to worry about storms when enjoying my journey.\n\nCâu hỏi: If you had your own boat, what would you do with it?\n\nI would go on a cruise whenever I had time. I often picture myself standing behind the wheel of my own boat, discovering the vast ocean and enjoying scenery that could take my breath away.\n\nCâu hỏi: Where in your country do people most often use/travel by boats?\n\nWell, I suppose it is the central part of the country since this region is famous for the long coastlines, which are really convenient for water travel and fishing on boats as well.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do many people in your country own their own boats?\n\nI don’t think so. Boats are often used commercially so most boat owners are fishermen and people who use them for rent. Other than that, I don’t think there are many individuals in my country that are wealthy enough to afford to own a boat themselves.\n\nTopic 17: Animals\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like animals?\n\nTo be honest, I only like friendly animals such as dogs, cats and birds. I consider them human’s\n\nfriends and keeping them as pets will help me release my negative emotions.\n\nCâu hỏi: What’s your favourite animal? Why?\n\nDogs, definitely. I am actually raising two dogs at present. Whenever I head back home from work, they are waiting to welcome me at the door. Also, they make me feel better when I’m down in the dumps. That’s why I love dogs.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are people in your country fond of animals?\n\nActually no. It’s sad to admit but this is the truth. Instead of loving animals, most Vietnamese people enjoy torturing them and taking photos to show other people or put on Facebook to get satisfaction.\n\nCâu hỏi: What kinds of animals as a pet do the people have in your country?\n\nJust like other countries in the world, we tend to keep dogs and cats as companions. This is because these animals are tame and easy to live with humans.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think cities are suitable places for keeping a pet?\n\nI don’t think so. This is because cities are areas of bumper to bumper traffic and heaps of construction, causing harm to pets’ health, and they are likely to face road accidents or a lack of playing space.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do children in your country like animals?\n\nYes. Vietnamese children are keen on playing with animals, especially dogs and cats, which are so friendly and have soft fur. They can hug and stroke these pets.\n\nCâu hỏi: What kind of animals do you think children like?\n\nI think it really depends on their personality. I can’t say for sure. For the most part, children love dogs and cats since they can play and roam about with them. Some children, however, adore birds because of their beautiful voice. Also, there are some who always enjoy teasing or hurting animals.\n\nCâu hỏi: What was your favourite animal when you were a child?\n\nI was a big fan of dogs. If my memories serve me right, I used to play with a neighbour’s dog called Kiki whenever my parents got into an argument. That was a way I chose to escape from the uncomfortable situation. For this reason, I love dogs so much and now I own a dog with the same name.\n\nCâu hỏi: Did you have any pets when you were a child?\n\nUnfortunately, no. My parents didn’t allow me to keep a pet as they were worried that I could be bitten by them.\n\nCâu hỏi: What do you think are the benefits of a child having a pet?\n\nWell, there is a wide range of benefits for children if they have a pet. The most obvious advantage is that they can learn how to show love to other animals by hugging or stroking them. In addition, they could probably take responsibility for some household chores by feeding their pet or taking it for a walk.\n\nCâu hỏi: If you have children in the future, will you allow them to keep a pet?\n\nYes, of course. I suppose keeping a pet is beneficial to a child’s development. By living side by side with them, pets can become their friend and give them emotional support.\n\nTopic 18: Getting bored\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you often get bored?\n\nUnfortunately, I do. And I feel extremely terrible whenever boredom comes and occupies my mind. That’s why I always try to make things a little bit more interesting, like creating some challenges or games in tasks that I have to complete.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think you get bored more often now than you did when you were a child?\n\nThat’s exactly what I feel. I think it’s partly because my childhood was full of joy and excitement since I still lived with my family and had tons of friends to keep me laughing all day Now, even though I’ve been far from home for a long time, I still miss those days and the nostalgic feelings seems to exaggerate my boredom. You know, all the work-money things are not very amusing.\n\nCâu hỏi: What things do you find boring?\n\nMost activities that cost a lot of time seem pretty boring to me because I’m not that kind of person who can sit still and work for 10 hours straight. Also, I am easily bored by the same routine every day, so I change my schedule regularly to keep myself energized and enthusiastic.\n\nTopic 19: Museums\n\nCâu hỏi: Are there many museums in your hometown?\n\nHonestly, I have no clue. Museums and historical sites are places that I couldn’t care less about, so I don’t really notice if there are any in Hanoi. Maybe there’re a couple of museums somewhere, I think.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think museums are useful for visitors to your hometown?\n\nIf they want to know more about our traditional activities and culture, sadly, no. If they find our history and the colonial wars that took place in Vietnam interesting, then yes. I think whether a place is considered ‘useful’ or ‘suitable’ for tourists depends on what they want to achieve from their visit.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you often visit a museum?\n\nIt’s like… never. For me, one should not ever go to a museum unless they are already bored to tears. Maybe I’m a little bit biased against all kinds of museums in Vietnam ever since I last visited one. I guess it’s just very boring having to walk all the way through a building just to see some pictures and odd-looking things I’m not allowed to touch.\n\nCâu hỏi: Did you go to any museums when you were a child?\n\nIt was hard not to. I mean, it’s one of the ‘compulsory’ extra-curricular activities that we had back in primary school. We went to a different museum each year with the whole school, and nobody was allowed to be absent from this annual activity, even if you were sick that day.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think museums are important?\n\nThough I’m not really a fan of museums, it’s quite impossible to deny the importance of these places. They hold all forms of evidence of a country’s historical development, such as artefacts or documents… you name it. Besides, what makes museums very special to our society, in my opinion, is the way they teach us to have gratitude and appreciation for things that happened in our country in the past.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think it’s suitable for museums to sell things to visitors?\n\nYea, why not? In fact, most museums are free of charge, so apart from the often inadequate government funding, these museums virtually have no other source of budget to cover\n\noperating and management expenses. So, revenue from selling souvenirs can act as additional income to help maintain them.\n\nCâu hỏi: When was the last time you visited a museum?\n\nI can’t really think of the answer for this question off the top of my head, perhaps because it’s been such a long time since the last time I went to a museum. But I don’t think I’ve ever paid a visit to any place of such a kind after primary school.\n\nTopic 20: Cooking\n\nCâu hỏi: What are some of the things that you can cook?\n\nI am not a skilled cook, I only know the basics, like fried egg and boiled veggies. The sad thing is, I can’t even make these dishes very well. Most of the time, they would be either undercooked or burnt.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like cooking?\n\nI am not interested in cooking, nor do I have a gift for it. However, I do enjoy watching cooking shows on TV, Master Chef for example, since I love seeing footage of food being prepared.\n\nCâu hỏi: How often do you cook?\n\nI don’t cook on a daily basis; just when my mom, who is in charge of cooking, is on a business trip. To me, cooking is not a pleasure, but rather a chore, so I don’t do it very often.\n\nCâu hỏi: What dishes are you best at cooking?\n\nI can proudly say that instant noodles is my signature dish. I have cooked it so many times that I know all the necessary techniques to make a restaurant-quality bowl of noodles.\n\nCâu hỏi: Does anyone in your family like to cook?\n\nMy mom is very keen on cooking. She loves experimenting with new ingredients and collecting recipes on the internet. Her home-cooked meals are not only full of nutrition, but also appetizing. My brother and I like her cooking so much that we rarely eat out.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do your parents know how to cook?\n\nMy mother has a knack for cooking. She always does a good job at seasoning, and her knife- work is no joke. My dad, on the other hand, knows nothing about cooking except for frying eggs.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think that it’s important to know how to cook well?\n\nAs much as I hate to cook, I must admit that people who can cook well, especially girls, are very charming. It often means that they can take good care of themselves and those around them.\n\nCâu hỏi: Who is the best cook you know?\n\nI don’t know much about the culinary world, so I can’t name any famous chef. To me, the best cook is no one other than my mom. She knows the recipes for almost all dishes like the back of her hand, and her food is always so tasty.\n\nCâu hỏi: What cooking experience have you had?\n\nLike I mentioned before, I don’t cook very often. The only memorable cooking experience I had was when my mom sent me to a short cookery course. I got a minor burn right on the first day, so my mom pulled me out immediately.\n\nCâu hỏi: Who taught you to cook?\n\nMy grandmother was my cooking teacher, as I spent most of my childhood in her kitchen. She was skilled at making the dishes not only taste good but also look good. For example, she taught me the art of vegetable carving and table setting, which I still remember clearly.\n\nCâu hỏi: When you were a child, did you ever help your parents to prepare a meal?\n\nYes, I did, but rather than cooking, I helped my parents with simple chores, like washing the vegetables and setting the table. I enjoyed such times, since it was a great bonding opportunity for my family.\n\nTopic 21: Forests\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like trees?\n\nI’m quite a nature enthusiast, so yes, I do love trees. Of course I acknowledge their beauty and importance in our lives, but that’s not all. I believe that there’s a close connection between human beings and trees, and I think people have a genuine affection toward all kinds of plants.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are there any important trees in your country?\n\nThe bamboo tree is widely considered the Vietnamese national tree. It is, in fact, a kind of tree which is very strong and straight from its root to the top. Many believe that this particular tree symbolizes our country and its people, especially during our great wars.\n\nCâu hỏi: Is there a forest near your hometown?\n\nHanoi lies in the centre of a plain, so there are no forests to be found near the city. In Vietnam, if you want to go into the woods, you’ll have to travel all the way to mountainous areas, or at least to plateaus like those in Lam Vien or Moc Chau.\n\nCâu hỏi: Would you like to live in a place that has a lot of trees?\n\nOnly in the summer, I have to say. Although trees mean the world to me, I still feel the chill whenever I walk across a leafy area during winter. I just don’t have great physical endurance when the weather is extreme.\n\nCâu hỏi: Where can one find trees (or forests) in your country?\n\nYou can easily find all sorts of trees or even evergreens everywhere in Vietnam. They’re planted alongside a lot of streets, in parks and zoos, and around most building complexes. However, it’s a bit harder if you need to find forests, since these areas are often far away from metropolises and also often more difficult to reach due to the underdeveloped transport facilities nearby.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think places with trees attract more visitors than places with few trees?\n\nWithout question. As I’ve already mentioned, people tend to be attracted to nature as a whole, and particularly, trees. Since trees provide oxygen, they are a kind of fresh-air- generator, so I think that people feel more refreshed when they are around them. This partly\n\nexplains the attraction I think, you see, we don’t just go to all the attractions just to stare at trees, but we are indeed attracted to leafy areas for our comfort.\n\nCâu hỏi: Did you ever climb a tree when you were a child?\n\nSadly, even ‘till now, I still can’t manage to climb a tree. This has been the most challenging task for me ever since I was a 5-year-old. Actually, I really envy those who can reach the top of a tree and look down from the top. I did try to climb a tree once, I really did, but it’s a shame I fell so hard on my face that now I’ve still got a scar above my mouth.\n\nCâu hỏi: Have you ever planted a tree?\n\nWell, I love trees, but it’s a pity I’m just not cut out to be a gardener. My gardening skills are so terrible that all my friends and family call me ‘the plant-killer’. I tried planting trees several times, but they all end up dying for some reason.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think people should plant more trees?\n\nI couldn’t agree more with that idea. We are so badly in need of trees these days, since a large number of plants in urban areas have been cut down to make way for the construction of new infrastructure. You know, fewer trees in the city means higher levels of air pollution we have to bear with. I’m afraid if we don’t take immediate action by planting more trees, it will soon be too late.\n\nTopic 22: Musical Instruments\n\nCâu hỏi: What types of musical instruments do you like to listen to?\n\nI like to explore all genres of music, but currently, I am learning how to play the guitar, so most of the time, I like to listen to guitar songs and melodies. Besides that, I also enjoy listening to piano music, especially when I need to concentrate on my work.\n\nCâu hỏi: When do you like to listen to music?\n\nI love being immersed in pleasant, harmonious sounds. Therefore, I would turn some music on whenever I am alone, except for when I am sleeping of course. In a typical work day, I usually listen to music in the morning, right after I wake up, so that I can boost my energy and prepare myself for the day.\n\nCâu hỏi: Did you learn to play a musical instrument when you were a child?\n\nNo, I didn’t. The town where I was born was extremely poor, and people back then were too busy trying to just get by. They, including me, literally worked all day long, leaving no time for entertainment or self-improvement activities. That’s why as a kid, I was not given the chance to even touch an instrument, much less learning to play it.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you think all children should learn to play a musical instrument?\n\nYes, of course. I strongly believe that when a kid learns how to play an instrument, he or she will be able to develop positive traits like patience, discipline, and commitment. I am learning one myself and I’ve seen huge benefits from it. The only thing I regret is that no one encouraged me to do so throughout my childhood.\n\nTopic 23: Holidays\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like travelling?\n\nHonestly speaking, I’m not really into travelling. In fact, I rarely leave town unless there is a family vacation or a company trip. I guess the main reason I dislike travelling is the burden of booking tickets and finding accommodation. I’d rather stay home than go through all of that.\n\nCâu hỏi: What is your favourite holiday?\n\nOf all public holidays, I like Independence Day the most. Vietnam’s Independence Day is celebrated on September 2nd, which is right before the beginning of the school year. Around this time of the year, the atmosphere on the streets is always super vibrant and lively.\n\nCâu hỏi: Are there many tourists visiting your country during that holiday?\n\nAs far as I know, there are tourists visiting during Independence Day, but rather than because of the holiday, it is mainly due to the lovely autumn weather in September. It’s the perfect time to stroll around the city while taking photos of the autumn leaves.\n\nCâu hỏi: What do you often do on holidays?\n\nI don’t do much during holidays. Since I’m a family-oriented person, I tend to stay home on these days and spend some quality time with my family. We love hosting big parties and inviting relatives over.\n\nTopic 24: Gifts\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like to receive gifts? (Why? / Why not?)\n\nYes, especially on special occasions like my birthday. I think it’s a way for other people to show their love and respect towards me.\n\nCâu hỏi: What kind of gifts do you like to receive? (Why?)\n\nI don’t have a particular gift that I’m fond of. I love getting surprises from other people’s gifts.\n\nCâu hỏi: What gifts did you receive in your childhood?\n\nThe gift I remember the most is a big doll. I still remember vividly my dad gave me that doll on my 8th birthday party. At that time, the doll meant the world to me because it represented my dad’s love for me.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like giving gifts to people? (Why? / Why not?)\n\nI only love giving gifts to my relatives or close friends. I consider gifts as a symbol of love, so I only give my love to my loved ones.\n\nCâu hỏi: What gifts did you give to others in your childhood?\n\nJust some non–material gifts because at that time, I only received a little pocket money from my parents. I just could afford some small gifts like pencils, notebooks and things like that.\n\nTopic 25: Secondary School\n\nCâu hỏi: What was your favorite subject in secondary school?\n\nThat was literature. I’m a bookworm, so literature was a way for me to immerse myself in books.\n\nCâu hỏi: And which subject did you like the least? (Why?)\n\nThat’s definitely physical education. Not because of the subject itself, but it was my teacher who made me disinterested in it. He was so irresponsible, and he often got drunk before teaching us. I had no idea why the principal put up with him for so long.\n\nCâu hỏi: Which secondary school subject do you think is most useful for people in adult life?\n\nI’d go for English. This is because it is the key skill we need in this globalized world. For example, there are tons of international companies located in Vietnam. This leads to an increase in job opportunities, but Vietnamese people must be fluent in particular languages, like English, to stand a chance at gaining one of these jobs.\n\nCâu hỏi: What part of your secondary school education did you enjoy the most?\n\nActually I have some bitter memories from my time in secondary school. I used to suffer from bullying so those years were like a dark chapter of my life. I wish I had a delete button to erase them from my head.\n\nCâu hỏi: How do you feel about your secondary school?\n\nAs I said before, my time in secondary schools wasn’t peaceful. So, in other words, I still hold a grudge against that school.\n\nCâu hỏi: Why did you choose to attend that particular school?\n\nActually it wasn’t my choice, that was my parents’ choice. At that time, I was too young to\n\nmake any decisions about my education.\n\nTopic 26: Pets\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you have any pets?\n\nYes. I’m raising two dogs at the moment. They are my best buddies and always guard my\n\nhouse for me.\n\nCâu hỏi: Do you like animals?\n\nTo be honest, I only like friendly animals such as dogs, cats and birds. I consider them human’s friends and keeping them as pets helps me to release any negative emotions I’m feeling.\n\nCâu hỏi: What pet would you want to keep if you could choose one?\n\nI would go for a dog. They are so friendly and can possibly help me to stay away from thinking negatively. Walking a dog is the best remedy for me to release stress after a long day.\n\nCâu hỏi: How do the rest of your family feel about pets?\n\nThey are fond of pets, too. My parents would love to have a spacious yard to raise 10 dogs. That’s the reason why we have just moved to the outskirts of Hanoi to make that dream come true.\n\nCâu hỏi: Have you ever had a bad experience with an animal?\n\nNo, I haven’t. My childhood was full of blissful memories of animals. I once lived with my grandmother on her farm, which was home to a lot of animals. That time played an important role in my emotional development. Thanks to those experiences, I am now an animal lover and working part time in an animal rescue organisation in Vietnam.\n\nTopic 27: Crowded places\n\nQuestion 1: What places do you think are often crowded?\n\nAnswer: Well, anywhere, from a hospital to even a post office can be extremely busy at any time during the day.
