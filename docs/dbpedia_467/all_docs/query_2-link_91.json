        "text": "To gain exciting insights into the history of Vietnam in terms of French colonial architecture is possibly what you will expect for a trip to this beautiful country. Then, do not take your eyes off the high schools with this ancient design, listed here!\n\nLe Hong Phong High School\n\nLe Hong Phong High School was founded in 1927 and first named Petrus Ky High School. Here is one of the Saigon’s oldest high schools with French colonial architecture which have still been in operation. During the French Domination, there were once many students as well as young patriots from this school, becoming the leaders of the uprisings against the French and US rules, such as Tran Van On, Ho Hao Hon, etc. Since 1976, the school’s name has been changed into Le Hong Phong – the former general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Nowadays, Le Hong Phong High School is among the best high schools with the largest number of students admitted into universities of the city every year.\n\nMarie Curie High School\n\nEstablished in 1918, Marie Curie High School – a sophisticated French colonial architecture structure in Saigon just admitted female students. Prior to 1975, the school was for children of the French colonists and a few of the most influential Vietnamese families in Saigon, and the curricula was all on French. However, both female and male students have been allowed to study here since 1975. Today, it is referred to as one of the most reputable public high schools in Saigon, remaining the beautiful French colonial architecture.\n\nNguyen Thi Minh Khai High School\n\nNguyen Thi Minh Khai High School – an all-girl school was built in 1913 and famous for Ao Dai in purple as the schoolgirls’ uniform which was symbolic of the virtue of Vietnamese maids. In the first years of operation, the students were educated by French, and Vietnamese was just used in Vietnamese literature for two hours per week. In 1953, the school was called a new name: Gia Long High School, and the uniform was also changed from purple Ao Dai into the white one. By that time, all curricula in the school were not in French anymore, but Vietnamese. The name of Nguyen Thi Minh Khai High School has been since 1975, and nowadays it admits both schoolboys and schoolgirls.\n\nTrung Vuong High School\n\nNestled at 3A Nguyen Binh Khiem Street, District 1, Trung Vuong High School is seemingly peaceful under the shadow of old verdant trees, making it emerging as an ancient castle from a fairy tale. Here is a charming high school with red-tile roofs and yellow walls – a typical example of French colonial architecture whereby it has been voted as one of the most outstanding designs in Saigon. In 1917, Trung Vuong was a girl high school named Dong Khanh High School and located in Hanoi. Nevertheless, after Geneva Conference, the school system was left for Saigon for some reasons, and since then it has operated as a common high school with male and female students.\n\nTran Dai Nghia High School\n\nFounded in 1874, Tran Dai Nghia High School, stemming from Lasan Taberd is positioned at Ly Tu Trong and Nguyen Du – a street of tamarind trees and cool breeze in District 1 – because there are two gates to the school. The highlight of this structure is that its windows are like artistic arches and walls are impressively painted in yellow – a typical design dating from the French Domination.\n\nLe Quy Don High School\n\nLe Quy Don is well known as the oldest high school in Saigon; it was built in 1875 and has just been 142 years old. The first name of the school was Collège Indigène, and then changed into Collège Chasseloup-Laubat because it was for children of the French in Saigon. In 1967, the rule of the school was given back to Education Ministry of Vietnam by that time, so it has been changed into Le Quy Don since then. Also, the school has been for Vietnamese students until now."
