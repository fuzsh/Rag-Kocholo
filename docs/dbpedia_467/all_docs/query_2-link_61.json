        "text": "Ho Chi Minh City — A top Vietnamese property tycoon was sentenced to death on Thursday in one of the biggest corruption cases in history, with an estimated $27 billion in damages. A panel of three hand-picked jurors and two judges rejected all defense arguments by Truong My Lan, the chair of major developer Van Thinh Phat, who was found guilty of swindling cash from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) for a decade.\n\n\"The defendant's actions... eroded people's trust in the leadership of the (Communist) Party and state,\" read the verdict at the trial in southern business hub Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nLan denied the charges and blamed her subordinates.\n\nAfter a five-week trial, 85 others also face verdicts and sentencing on charges ranging from bribery and abuse of power to appropriation and violations of banking law.\n\nLan embezzled $12.5 billion, but prosecutors said Thursday the total damages caused by the scam now amounted to $27 billion — a figure equivalent to six percent of the country's 2023 GDP. The figure dwarfs even the amount that FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried was recently convicted of swindling his customers out of, estimated at around $10 billion.\n\nStill, the death sentence is an unusually severe punishment in such a case.\n\nLan and the others were arrested as part of a national corruption crackdown that has swept up numerous officials and members of Vietnam's business elite in recent years.\n\nThe Vietnamese property mogul appeared to say in final remarks to the court last week that she had thoughts of suicide.\n\n\"In my desperation, I thought of death,\" she said, according to state media. \"I am so angry that I was stupid enough to get involved in this very fierce business environment — the banking sector — which I have little knowledge of.\"\n\nHundreds of people began to stage protests in the capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, a relatively rare occurrence in the one-party communist state, after Lan's arrest in October 2022.\n\nPolice have identified around 42,000 victims of the scandal, which has shocked the Southeast Asian country.\n\nLan, who is married to a wealthy Hong Kong businessman also on trial, was accused of setting up fake loan applications to withdraw money from SCB, in which she owned a 90% stake.\n\nPolice say the scam's victims are all SCB bondholders who cannot withdraw their money and have not received interest or principal payments since Lan's arrest.\n\nProsecutors said during the trial that they had seized more than 1,000 properties belonging to Lan.\n\nAuthorities have also said $5.2 million allegedly given by Lan and some SCB bankers to state officials to conceal the bank's violations and poor financial situation was the largest-ever bribe recorded in Vietnam.\n\nThe woman who was offered the bribe — Do Thi Nhan, the former head of the State Bank of Vietnam's inspection team — said during the trial that the cash was handed to her in Styrofoam boxes by the former CEO of SCB, Vo Tan Van.\n\nAfter realising they contained money, Nhan refused the boxes but Van declined to take them back, state media reported.\n\nMore than 4,400 people have been indicted during Vietnam's corruption crackdown, across more than 1,700 graft cases, since 2021.\n\nA top Vietnamese luxury property tycoon — Do Anh Dung, head of the Tan Hoang Minh group — was sentenced to eight years in prison last month after he was found guilty of cheating thousands of investors in a $355 million bond scam."
