        "text": "Songs acting as a bridge between China and Vietnam: Do Thi Thanh Hoa\n\nDo Thi Thanh Hoa, a 25-year-old singer from Vietnam, won the monthly championship at the \"Avenue of Stars,\" a popular singing competition show on CCTV.\n\nI was born in Tuyen Quang, Vietnam, and was fond of music at early age.\n\nAfter growing up, I enrolled in Vietnam's Military and Arts University for learning songs, where in 2013, I was recommended for a scholarship at Guangxi Arts University, based in Nanning, capital of Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. China has a time-honored history and its people are passionate and friendly.\n\nWhen I first heard Chinese folk songs, I was attracted by it. I like this kind of music, and my favorite one is \"On the Hopeful Field.\" What made me happier was that my teachers told me that my voice was perfectly fit to sing Chinese folk songs. I won the monthly championship at the \"Avenue of Stars,\" a popular singing competition show on the CCTV, in 2016.\n\nNext year, I will go to Central Conservatory of Music to pursue my master degree. In the future, I will sing both Vietnamese and Chinese songs. I hope that my songs can be a bridge between China and Vietnam, allowing people from both countries to learn more about each otherâs folk songs and vocal music, and contributing to a long-lasting friendship between the two countries.\n\nFriendship between China and Vietnam will continue: Pham Van Tu\n\nVietnamese Pham Van Tu, 26, has studied in China.\n\nI was fond of watching Chinese TV series when I was a child. Journey to the West and The Three Kingdoms, my favorites, helped me develop a keen interest in Chinese culture. I nurtured a strong desire to visit China some day.\n\nIn 2010, I made my first trip to China. I was impressed by the Chinese peopleâs passion and kindness.\n\nFor instance, I was touched by the gesture of a Chinese taxi driver during a mid-autumn festival. The taxi driver gave me a moon cake upon learning that I was a Vietnamese.\n\nOn another occasion, a Chinese tourist was visiting my village. My Vietnamese friend worked as his guide. Although communication was a problem because of the language barrier, they still managed to have a good time in each otherâs company.\n\nI strongly believe that the friendship between China and Vietnam will continue to thrive during our life and times.\n\nWe, as Vietnamese students who studied in China, can make our small but meaningful contribution to act as bridges between the two countries to foster deeper mutual understanding.\n\nOf cotton-padded clothes and warm Sino-Vietnam ties: Wu Shikui\n\nWu Shikui, 81, Director of Department of Chinese English Russian French studies in Hanoi University.\n\nMy father Wu Tinghuai, was the first Minister of Education in Vietnam. He introduced educational regulations and courses in English, Chinese and Russian languages.\n\nFrench imperial forces had abolished all courses on Chinese studies from universities about 30 years before my father took office.\n\nI started reading and writing Chinese from the tender age of eight under the influence of my father. I took to learning the Chinese script and reading classics to imbibe a deeper understanding of one of the most ancient civilizations in the world.\n\nI first visited China on August 1, 1951, which coincided with the Army Day, a public holiday. I stayed in Guangxi in southern China, which borders with Vietnam, for three years.\n\nLife was tough for the local Chinese population in Guangxi. Despite their hardships, they were extremely kind to the Vietnamese students. They fed us with nutritious bread and gave us rubber shoes to cover our feet.\n\nIn 1954, I went from Nanning, Guangxi, to Soviet Union via Beijing. My Chinese teacher in Nanning made sure that I had enough cotton-padded clothes to brave Moscowâs biting cold.\n\nI went back to Vietnam via China after completion of my studies in Soviet Union.\n\nIn fact, I arrived in Vietnam on August 1, 1961, exactly a decade since I left home for China.\n\nIt has been over 60 years since I first visited China, but I cherish my time in Guangxi the most.\n\nI can never forget the Chinese warmth and the cotton-padded clothes that helped me brace for a harsh winter in Moscow,\n\nPresident Ho Chi Minh had said that Vietnam and China always shared close ties that celebrate brotherhood.\n\nVietnam and China should continue to maintain cordial friendly ties. And, I am willing to dedicate the rest of my life to foster Sino-Vietnam friendship, mutual trust and cooperation.\n\nVietnam and China should continue with their beautiful friendship that can survive the test of times\n\nFan Dao, 77, Director of Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam.\n\nMy parents were both Communist revolutionaries in Vietnam.\n\nI was sent to school in Guangxi province at the tender age of 12. I went on to complete my education in China.\n\nI came back to Guangxi, which borders Vietnam, for a teaching assignment after graduating from college (from where in China if you can mention).\n\nThough I was away from home for long, my Chinese teachers and classmates never made me feel the socio-cultural disconnect.\n\nI was good at studies and my Chinese batch mates would often borrow my notes to study.\n\nIn fact, I was the only Vietnamese student to be invited to attend the 10th anniversary of Chinese National Day in 1959.\n\nI stood on one side of Tiananmen Square and caught a glimpse of Chairman Mao Zedong --- one of the most cherished moments of my life.\n\nI made lots of friends during my stay in China, and I have kept in touch with them through the years.\n\nEach time a Chinese friend comes to Vietnam, I act as his interpreter and guide.\n\nI have also been instrumental in sending over 200 Vietnamese students to study Chinese in Guangxi University in the last 10 years.\n\nI strongly believe that both Vietnam and China should continue with their beautiful friendship that can survive the test of times.\n\nWhen it comes to Sino-Vietnam ties, we must remember Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has urged us not to forget where we come from.\n\nTime is ripe to strengthen Sino-Vietnam friendship as it has captured the hearts and minds of people from both the countries."
