        "text": "Thi Bui (pronounced tea, like the drink, and buoy, like the thing that floats on water) was born in Việt Nam the same year that her grandfather died, three months before the end of the Vietnam War. Bui was three years old when she, her parents, and her siblings left South Việt Nam by boat, eventually making their way to a refugee camp in Malaysia, and months later, to America. Growing up as a refugee in San Diego, California, Bui sensed that “the Vietnam War had left a deep psychological scar on her parents, but she rarely heard them talk about it” (Mother Jones). Those scars are a part of Bui’s own inheritance from Việt Nam, an instinct she calls the “Refugee Reflex”; a flight-or-flight response, driven by the awareness that “things can change, can go from bad to worse very quickly, and “...you must be ready to grab those important to you and run, or stay and fight, and nothing is guaranteed” (Bookpage).\n\nAs a child, Bui pursued art as a form of escape, passing the time by making crafts, drawing, and daydreaming. “Whether I was escaping my drab physical environment or tense emotional environment, I’m not sure...maybe both?” Bui shares. “It’s not like that anymore, but that’s how being creative started — first as an escape and then as a rebellion” (Seattle Public Library). She had a knack for imitation and for observational drawing, and drew steadily throughout school; \"...but I went to public school in California during budget cuts, you know? They weren't great experiences” (The Comics Journal). Bui dropped her art classes and took drama instead.\n\nIn college, however, she met the sculptor Jane Rosen, a drawing teacher who became hugely influential in teaching Bui to draw. Bui refined her drawing style, explored new mediums, and studied law. After graduating with two bachelor's degrees—one in legal studies and another in art—Bui moved to New York and completed an MFA in sculpture at Bard College. She considered a couple of potential futures: a career as a civil rights attorney or a life as an artist, butinstead, she turned towards teaching. It was in this second graduate program, this time for arts education, that she would begin the project that would become The Best We Could Do (Abrams ComicArts, 2017).\n\nBui credits “a kind of academic grumpiness” (NPR) with sparking her first ideas for the book. She was a graduate student at NYU, “deconstructing all of the bad representations of Vietnamese people in the Vietnam War in movies and pop culture and American scholarship” (NPR) and seeking narratives that captured the personal dimensions of life during conflict: something “more relatable, more wholly human” (Mother Jones). During a trip to Việt Nam in 2002, she began to reconstruct the family stories that she’d grown up around; stories that she’d understood very much as a kid, but that were “from another country and her parent’s generation,” (NBC News). With few memories of her early childhood, Bui found herself “documenting in lieu of remembering” when she returned to their street in the Bàn Cờ neighborhood of Sài Gòn. This documentation became her master’s thesis, coalescing extensive historical research, interviews, and transcription of her family’s oral histories in a homemade book.\n\nBui loved what she’d created with her thesis, but she was still searching for a format that would feel more human, capturing the details of personal life—complex and quotidian—elided by history books. She turned towards illustration. Craig Thompson, the author and illustrator of the landmark graphic novel Blankets became Bui’s first comics mentor, convincing her to consider sequential comics rather than an illustrated journal. The Renaissance styles that Bui had learned from Rosen informed some of the brushwork techniques within The Best We Could Do and Bui’s other illustrated works: but she had to learn to draw more simply, “...to develop a shorthand, since drawing for comics is about getting the idea of the thing across, more than drawing a very observed study of the thing” (The Comics Journal).\n\nAfter putting herself through two graduate degree programs, Bui was not interested in going back to school. Instead, she amassed thousands of hours teaching herself to draw comics, studying the work of other artists and producing hundreds of pages, only a few of which would make it into the book. In the meantime, life moved forward. Bui gave birth to her son. She and her husband took on a cross-country move from New York to California so their family could be closer to her parents and siblings, now clustered just minutes from each other in Berkeley. In California, Bui helped to found the Oakland International High School, the first public high school in the state for recent immigrants and English learners. Her writing days gained new interruptions: curriculum writing; comic arts residencies and workshops; makerspace projects with her husband and son; and walks with her mom, who moved to a studio apartment in Bui’s backyard, and her dad, just four blocks away.\n\nBui notes that the process of writing The Best We Could Do changed her relationship with her parents, but also with her younger self. “Drawing anyone as a child is an incredibly healing process of loving and forgiving them,” she shared in an interview with the Seattle Public Library. “I didn’t realize until drawing myself as a child or a younger person over and over that that could work for oneself as well.” Her work, says Vulture, is a constant reminder that “...all historical memory is as situated in our individual personal chronology as it is in any objective one.”\n\nBui does not call Việt Nam home, though it should have been. She processed that grief over the course of creating The Best We Could Do. “What I learned from history and from talking to my parents was that the moment of rupture was not exactly our emigration,” said Bui. “It was a process of decades that eventually made Việt Nam and my parents incompatible...by the time I was born, it was not my country at all. But it had gained its independence, finally” (Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center). Instead, she has learned to call America home: “America, the land of such amazing contradiction” (BookPage).\n\n“Her story delivers the painful truth that most Vietnamese of the twentieth century know in an utterly personal fashion,” says Bui’s friend and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Viet Thanh Nguyen. “That history is found in the marrow of one’s bones, ready to be passed on through blood, through generations, through feelings.”\n\nIn addition to The Best We Could Do, Bui has illustrated the picture book A Different Pond, written by the poet Bao Phi (Capstone, 2017), for which she won a Caldecott Honor. With her son, Hien, she co-illustrated the children’s book, Chicken of the Sea (McSweeney’s, 2019), written by Nguyen and his son, Ellison. Her short comics can be found online at The Nib, PEN America, and BOOM California. She is currently researching and drawing a work of graphic nonfiction about immigrant detention and deportation, to be published by One World, Random House.\n\n“I have a much more objective relationship with Việt Nam now that I am no longer searching for my origin story in it,” said Bui. “It is a complex, beautiful country of 95 million people who are not me. I carry some part of it in me, but I am not necessarily a part of it” (Seattle Public Library).\n\nJune 2021"
