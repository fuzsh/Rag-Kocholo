        "text": "Early Life and Career\n\nRéhahn was born in Bayeux in Normandy, France. An avid traveller, he voyaged to more than 35 countries with his camera before settling in the coastal town of Hoi An. Vietnam and its culture had inspired him since he visited for the first time while on a humanitarian mission with the French NGO Les Enfants du Vietnam.\n\nReferred to as someone who “captures the souls of his models” (Wanderlust Travel Magazine, 2018), the French photographer is more than just a man behind a camera.\n\nBehind each photograph is a story. Each image is the culmination of an experience. The stories of his subjects as well as his passion for learning more about their culture, diversity and changing traditions are what drives the artist’s work.\n\nNew Work\n\nAfter finishing his original mission for the Precious Heritage Project and Cultural Museum, Réhahn became interested in returning to his own cultural roots. His research brought him to the French countryside, specifically to Honfleur on the Normandy coast in France, where he spent time as a child and still owns a residence. Honfleur is known for being the birthplace of the Impressionist movement in painting.\n\nThe artist’s passion for nature, bright colors and light aligned with the desires of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists to try to capture the changing colors and emotions that arise with the changes of light and seasons. Despite its distance from France, Vietnam shared some of the idyllic rural scenes that so inspired certain 19th-century painters such as Monet, Pissaro and Van Gogh.\n\nIMPRESSIONISM IN PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nRéhahn sought to reimagine the initial influences of the Impressionists, but in a contemporary way. Light is an essential tool for all photographers, finding a way to use it in a completely original style was the challenge. The artist created methods to merge the fields of Fine Art painting and photography in a new medium – Impressionist Photography.\n\nRefusing to use filters or any other artifice for the retouching of his images, he decided to use nature itself to give his work an impressionistic aspect which, under the right conditions, can almost appear to have the texture of paint.\n\nThe use of reflections (a constant source of inspiration for Monet), the distortion of a scene through the heat of a fire, or even through drops of falling rain, are necessary effects for the creation of these artistic works. They also use the bright complimentary colors and pastoral scenes that filled the oeuvres of painters such as Van Gogh and Pissaro.\n\nBeyond light and color, Impressionist painters were also strongly influenced by the compositions in traditional Japanese art forms. Artists like Degas redefined the balanced composition, which was formerly so dear to the West. Some critics saw these new layouts on the canvas as failed pictorial attempts; but art historians quickly understood the intention, their sources of inspiration as well as the beauty of off-center paintings, intense flat colors, and even the use of empty space.\n\nRéhahn’s Impressionist series of Fine Art photographs, which use some of these principles, have become instant bestsellers with the Limited Edition series being acquired in record-setting times.\n\nArtistic Collaborations\n\nRecent collaborations with well-known brands have brought the artist’s photographs to a new audience. In 2017, iconic fashion brand Louis Vuitton chose a Limited Edition copy of Into the Sky for the decor of their flagship Saigon store.\n\nThis bestselling photograph of a man asleep in a boat on emerald waters was also chosen by the world renowned Scotch Whisky brand Johnnie Walker for the final label of their 2022 Blue Label bottles. The brand also used four other works to create a full series of Limited Edition collector’s items. Into the Wave, Tradition, Blue Windows, and Resting Gold are each spread across four bottles to create the effect of panel artwork, each piece completing a part of the final work.\n\nIn 2023, Elie Bleu, a French artisan house specializing in cigar humidors, watches, games, pens and jewelry boxes, has created a custom humidor in collaboration with Réhahn. The custom lacquered box features the artist’s bestselling portrait Elva."
