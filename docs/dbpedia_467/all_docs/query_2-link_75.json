        "text": "May 31st 2024, marked first anniversary for Hoàng Thi Minh Hồng being arrested.\n\nHoàng Thi Minh Hồng was formally sentenced to 3 years in prison under false charges of tax evasion following her official trial in Ho Chi Minh City on September 28th 2023, where a fine of 100 million VND was also levied.\n\nWorking closely with 350.org since the organization’s early days, Hong has impacted her colleagues and friends in the movement. Hong established an affiliate organization, 350.org, known as the Center of Hands-on Actions and Networking for Growth and Environment (CHANGE), in 2013.\n\nCHANGE, with its numerous accomplishments, played a pivotal role in halting the development and funding of coal-fired power plants in Vietnam.\n\nMobilization through creative ways is Hong’s master approach, therefore we hope to have the global solidarity action to do the similar ways. Your support for her early release will be very much appreciated."
