        "text": "Conjuring \"Spirit\"\n\nAs members we are almost the same age, and have known each other for a very long time, ever since we applied to go to art school. And because of that, establishing the group was really honestly based on friendship. After we graduated, we realized how rough and cramped the conditions were for making art. So we decided to start the group with a simple reason, which was to nourish our desire to create. The other way was to quit art and go to Eastern Europe (which was the most promising place for those who wanted to escape from poverty and war; Western Europe was riskier and more expensive since you had to travel by ship). The group met up, drank tea and wine almost daily, we also went on picnics, visited some studios and went dancing! (which was illegal at that time)\n\n—Trần Lương, Gang of Five4 [End Page 147]\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\nThese were the early days of the Gang of Five. Gazing at a black-and-white photograph that Trần Lương has shared of that moment (top), observing as youthful glee dances beneath arms raised, eyes drawn excitedly towards a camera overhead, it is striking to recall that this was a group of artists who had survived a protracted ideological war.\n\nIn another image (p. 149), we see a staged group portrait of five handsome young men dressed in black, all looking away from the lens, except Lương, who is armed with his signature stare that, to this day, continues to challenge assumed understandings of power. Much of the photographic documentation featured within the bilingual chronology of the Spirit of Friendship exhibition and website is similarly confident and celebratory in tone. From the openings of events that approximated \"exhibitions\", to the processes of collaborative artistic production; from impromptu gatherings in song, to artists gathering and engaging in pointed group critique: what these small windows offer is but a glimpse into what might be similar experiences anywhere in the world's diverse landscape of artistic communities.\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\n[End Page 148]\n\nIn Vietnam, however, these artists who were and are committed to pushing differing modes and concepts of art-making beyond official or commercial dictates, continue to endure a landscape in which government and influential figures of wealth perceive such experimentation as suspicious for its cultural subversion, or as not a socially palatable economic investment. As a consequence, Vietnam today does not possess museums, libraries or universities with critical comparative expertise and resources on the history of art, either local or international. Thus, for better or worse, there are very few experienced curators, dealers, collectors and scholars who can readily argue for the validity and value of the experimental pioneers of Vietnamese art.\n\nGiven these circumstances, just how do these artists survive, and what motivates them to continue their work?\n\nIn an attempt to answer these questions, it is necessary to share a little background on the social and historical specificity of this country's experimental artistic landscape, and perceptions of it. As Trần Lương alludes to above, escaping poverty and war was the ultimate dream for a survivor who endured the international conflict between 1955 and 1975 (the collapse of the French Empire and the ensuing bloodbath that gave way to the establishment of the Communist State of Vietnam). Whether living in the north or south of the country, all artists faced some kind of battle of conscience with their ideas following the end of the American War. After 21 years of partition,5 there [End Page 149] were stark differences in artistic leanings between the divided communities of north and south. North Vietnam had been ensconced in socialist realism since 1945,6 as a vehicle to serve the ideology of Marxism and the growing dialogue with international communism. In the south, however, up until 1975, the extensive contact with American culture, the remnants of French philosophical attitudes in the translation of existential European thinkers (such Jean Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Friedrich Nietzsche), and the proliferation of printing houses (particularly in Saigon), all meant that southern artists were more exposed to western art movements, playing with form and composition in ways that were not permitted for their northern counterparts. In 1966, the first Fine Art Museum in Vietnam was established in Hanoi, but only after museums addressing political issues had been first set up, such as the Museum of Revolution, in 1959. It is revealing that northern artists who had relocated to South Vietnam, following the ousting of the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, were no longer considered worthy of its halls.7\n\nWith the Fall of Saigon in 1975 came the move towards \"re-education\", which saw the artistic communities of the south conscripted into the armed forces by the Fine Art Association (Hoi My Thuat), often to violently detrimental ends.8 For the first decade of Vietnam as a one-party state, life was incredibly tumultuous for artists. Friendships were integral to propelling commitment to artistic experimentation. The members of the Gang of Five in Hanoi felt compelled to work off the official grid, exploring a life of art beyond the socialist realist official dictum, and feeling an urgent need to conceptually and critically reflect on the nature of their everyday. Other groups of artists in the renamed southern city of Ho Chi Minh (formerly Saigon) were living amongst northern artists whose belief in the nationalist (and thus communist) cause had awarded them senior positions in the newly established Ho Chi Minh City Fine Art Association (Hoi My Thuat Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh). In the early 1990s, the Group of 109 found themselves friends under such circumstances precisely because of their commitment to art (particularly to the language of abstraction, which was not officially accepted at the time), despite their differing political attitudes, which will be discussed in more detail below. While the political ideology of the state may be a key influence in the generation of an artistic aesthetic, also of critical importance for mutually motivated experimentation in art in post-1975 Vietnam was the introduction of national economic reforms in 1986. Following what is locally referred as Doi Moi,10 artists found increasing access to technology and international opportunity, thus fragmenting the dominance of a socialist worldview about the purposes, materials and meanings of art. Artist and filmmaker Nguyễn Trinh Thi (founder of Hanoi Doclab) says of this time: [End Page 150]\n\nuntil the early 2000s, artists mainly used video as an additional element to art installations or documentation of performances (in much the same way that video entered China in the early 1990s, where video art was first seen as a social tool of documentation, as opposed to an exploration of the form itself). In the 1990s, and even to this day, knowledge of the conceptual history of art and the exploration of abstraction beyond the \"Abstract Expressionists\" is not found in universities. Thus it was due to the popularity of television and film that artists studying and working in Vietnam were introduced to the potential of video as an artistic medium, largely drawn to its artistic potential as opposed to its structural capabilities.11\n\nFrom the early 2000s, the artist's toolbox began to engage the digital realm.12 Digital cameras (still or moving) became a more affordable medium that immediately captured a \"truth\", which questioned the role of artists and the purpose of their expression in society. An example is the establishment of HanoiLink in 2006.13 The questioning of the construct of \"truth\" was further deepened with access to the World Wide Web,14 enabling comparative thinking on issues such as identity (thus explorations of sexuality in the subversive installations and performances of Trương Tân and Nguyễn Minh Thành); the role of spirituality (in dialogue with questions of ideological belief, as evidenced in the work of Trần Lương, Nguyễn Quang Huy and Nguyễn Minh Phước); or the prevalence of social corruption and immorality (illustrated in the graphic figurative work of such artists as Nguyễn Văn Cường and Lê Quảng Hà). It is important to note that, even today, still none of these critical experimental (and conceptual) art histories are taught in the secondary or tertiary levels of education in Vietnam.\n\nThe economic reforms of Doi Moi did, however, afford educational exchange opportunities. In 1987, artist Vũ Dân Tân found himself with the offer of study abroad, first in the Soviet Union and then Cuba. He was drawn to the compositional quality of music and the art of the stage, and succumbed to the thrall of animation, eventually returning to Hanoi with his Russian wife, Natasha Kraevskaia. Emboldened by the spirit of Perestroika and the way artists in the USSR had removed the ideological shackles from their artistic energies and outputs, Salon Natasha was born in 1990 (essentially the front room of Tân and Kraevskaia's family home15), within which a multitude of music nights and \"salon\"-style exhibitions of local artist friends began to regularly occur. [End Page 151]\n\nAround that same time in Ho Chi Minh City, the Group of 10 (a group of artist friends who were also teachers and students) began to embrace abstract ideas in painting, demonstrating a mutual desire to technically and conceptually explore the painterly surface beyond the limited scope of the plastic arts schooling inherited from the French, and the heavy-handed dictum of socialist realism. Members of this group were to become instrumental in arguing to the cultural authorities for the need to officially approve such abstract artistic language.16 In the 1990s, the trickle of foreign curators, dealers and collectors with interest in Vietnamese art slowly turned into a steady stream, introducing the lucrative idea that being an artist could be a \"career\" or a form of livelihood (as opposed to a professed tool of the state). This shift also had a fundamental effect on the development of contemporary art. A private and commercial landscape for art began to flourish, where the apprehension of tourist demand—a desire for something \"Vietnamese\"—particularly pushed a language of art, opportunistically supported by the Vietnamese government, as a series of undebated cultural stereotypes propped up as national symbols of culture (such as the conical hat, the ao dai dress, the lacquer box or the lotus flower).\n\nIt was in 1994 that American art dealer Suzanne Lecht decided to establish her commercial gallery Art Vietnam in Hanoi, initially drawn to the inexplicable energy of the individual projects realised by the artists within Gang of Five, and also the artists who would eventually be regarded as the Avant Garde Calligrapher Group (locally referred to as the Zenei Gang of Five17). Art Vietnam was a commercial initiative with productive collector networks beyond Asia, thus increasing recognition of these experimental pioneers, supporting the production of artworks and organising exhibitions by such artists whose aesthetic language extended beyond the stereotypes made for the growing tourist market. This support of experimental artists was furthered that same year by the arrival of German artist Veronica Radulovic, who came to Vietnam to study lacquer art, becoming the first international lecturer since 1975 to be employed at the Hanoi University of Fine Art, supported by the German Academic Exchange Service. Artist Nguyễn Minh Thành, from Hanoi Triad,18 comments:\n\nAt that time, seeing Trương Tân's novel and daring paintings, looking at artworks of Veronika Radulovic, along with foreign books and videos on contemporary art that she brought to Vietnam, and engaging in discussions and talks—all of these were inspirations for us to practice drawing and creating art. At that time, we were tired of the formal education at school and had started slacking.19 [End Page 152]\n\nWith Doi Moi also came a stronger and more active cultural diplomacy between Vietnam and foreign governments, with Alliance Français (later renamed L'Espace), Goethe Institut, British Council, Japan Foundation and, later, the Cultural Development Exchange Fund (CDEF) of the Danish government (mainly operating in Hanoi), all evidencing strong advocacy of experimental art practice in Vietnam. These foreign-funded initiatives predominantly demanded that Vietnamese artists engaged or collaborated with an artistic expertise from their respective country, however, and thus directed (and limited) the cultural and historical directions of artistic enquiry by Vietnamese artists.20\n\nIt is instructive to glance in comparison at Ho Chi Minh City in the early 1990s: a city whose intellectual and creative intelligentsia had largely fled in 1975, following the communist stitching of the country into one. In the early 1990s, Ho Chi Minh City was considerably quieter than Hanoi, devoid of any foreign NGOs or cultural diplomacy programmes. However, in 1995, this slowly began to change, as Vietnam and the USA restored diplomatic relations, with Vietnam also becoming a full member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the same year. These political shifts proved to be significant, for they opened the door for Vietnamese artistic exchange with the Southeast Asian region, and even more critically for the former South Vietnam, the chance for those who had fled to return home.\n\nThe return of artists who are celebrated today, such as Đinh Q. Lê (who was one of the first artists to relocate in 1996 from the USA to Ho Chi Minh City), was indicative of a growing wave of Viet Kieu,21 determined to return and contribute to the competitive growth of Vietnam's financial, social and cultural platforms. It was also in 1996 that Trần Thị Huỳnh Nga decided to establish Blue Space Contemporary Arts Centre within the grounds of the Ho Chi Minh City Fine Art Museum. This little gallery, nestled within the decaying ground floor of a state institution, was the first space in the former South Vietnam to gather a network of an array of artists from across the country, indeed the Southeast Asian region, in Ho Chi Minh City. It was through the artistic gatherings at Blue Space that artistic friendships were furthered beyond the local, at times inspiring initiatives to do something on their own.22\n\nA unique character of Ho Chi Minh City, differing greatly from Hanoi, was the mingling of Viet Kieu, foreign and local artist communities.23 The social tensions between these groups manifested in particularly fraught relationships. For example, the assumption that Viet Kieu had access to wealth and mobility functioned as a prime source of social stigma at the local level.24 Thus such artist initiatives as \"a little blah blah\"25 (formed 2004), Wonderful [End Page 153] District26 (formed 2006) and Sàn Art (formed 2007) were influential amalgamations of friendships that effectively bridged such social divide, demonstrating the beneficial networks afforded from such partnerships (results also reflected in the growing private business sector).\n\nThe growth in such artist-friendship activity was arguably also spurred by the growing international attention afforded to Vietnamese art. Major exhibition platforms associated with museum collections in the 1990s, such as the Fukuoka Asian Art Triennial (since 1979, previously referred as the Asian Art Show); and the Queensland Art Gallery's Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art (established 1991) were engaging curatorial research into Vietnamese experimental pioneers, and acquiring their artworks. Similarly, art dealers (such as Plum Blossom Gallery in Hong Kong27) and freelance curators (such as Sherry Buchanan, the first curator to give recognition to the work of Trần Trung Tín28) were actively pushing Vietnamese experimental practices abroad.\n\nAlongside these efforts, within Vietnam collectors such as Lê Thái Sơn, Adrian Jones (Witness' Collection, formed in 2002); Dominic Scriven (DOGMA Collection and Art Prize, formed in 2009), and Post Vidai (a group of three collectors, formed in 1993) were vital in their support of experimental explorations by Vietnamese artists. By the early 2000s, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City possessed a heady number of commercial galleries (predominantly tourist-focused), though glaringly few were willing (and equipped with necessary collector and exhibition networks) to represent artists of this experimental scene.\n\nWhile financial instability is a reality faced by experimental artists all over the world, a crucial concern for the sustainability of experimental art practices in Vietnam is the urgent need for reform of its educational curricula and expertise. Vietnam inherited an Ècole des Beaux Arts system of studying the Plastic Arts, introduced by the French in 1925, with a curriculum that, since the 1950s, has had little innovation, and lacks any critical comparative engagement of local or foreign developments in aesthetic ideas and theories. Thus, artists who seek to successfully engage with international markets must be incredibly proactive and strategic (similarly to this country's economic and tourist industries). Addressing the lack of educational opportunities for artists is especially central to the activities of artist groups such as Nhà Sàn in Hanoi and Sàn Art in Ho Chi Minh City. Their projects not only challenge themselves with historical and conceptual approaches to art-making, but also engage in critical dialogue between local and non-local forms of interdisciplinary cultural knowledge.29 [End Page 154]\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\nIt is in acknowledging this complicated and socio-politically nuanced artistic landscape that the curating of this exhibition was physically divided into four sections on the gallery floor of The Factory Contemporary Arts Centre. The first section—also replicated on the project website at www.spiritoffriendship.org/artists—comprised a lengthy timeline, which attempts to provide a basic map of this experimental artistic landscape, noting particular social, economic and cultural milestones within and beyond Vietnam. The exhibition's second section, Leaving a Mark—Finding the Way Forward, presented four mini-exhibitions dedicated to specific artist-friendship groups whose projects left indelible marks on the development of an experimental artistic thinking in Vietnam. Strategies of Survival, the third section, focused on how particular artist groups have innovated the use and access to space, in order to display and share their art, despite financial or political limits. Finally, a section titled Artists Looking at Artists consisted of a screening programme of moving image works, including documentaries, short films and videos. In these films, artists examine the lives and methods of other artists, not only in an act of memorial, but also as a means of recording—and thus providing access to—the legacy of art and artists to be remembered by a broader community. [End Page 155]\n\nThe following sections of this curatorial text expand on these various sections of the Spirit of Friendship exhibition.\n\nLeaving a Mark—Finding the Way Forward\n\nSituated at the spatial centre of this exhibition was a focus on the work of the Group of 10, Salon Natasha, Nhà Sàn and Sàn Art, four artist groups specifically chosen for their demonstration of how artist friendships have addressed the lack of networked support, opportunity, expertise and educational resources available for artists in Vietnam, through unique means of artistic exchange and production, exhibition making and the creation of dynamic learning environments.\n\nGroup of 10 (as they came to be named)30 was a unique group of artists who, beginning in 1989, started to exhibit in the ground-floor offices of the newspaper Van Nghe, gathering together as friends in Ho Chi Minh City over a table, ten chairs, a few bottles of vodka and a sardine box. This scene was soon enriched by leaflets about their annual group exhibitions, and recent issues of My Thuat, a magazine on fine art published by the Ho Chi Minh Fine Art Association, which two of the Group of 10 members, Ca Lê Thắng and\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\n[End Page 156] Nguyễn Trung, were partly responsible for publishing. This was an unusual yet significant group of people, for its members hailed from both North and South Vietnam, making Group of 10 arguably the first group of artists to work together across this previous ideological divide.31 This was partly a consequence of the communist-appointed Fine Art Association forming national membership, and in the process sending significant artistic talents south to lead its initiatives. But it also reflected the artists thinking practically about the chances of a better livelihood.32 Leaving aside their ideological leanings and (perhaps intimidating) official appointments,33 these artists came together in the spirit of art, particularly for an exploration of abstraction: a mode of painting not officially permitted (and thus not taught or supported) at the time. Their first group show in 1989 came to be an annual event in Ho Chi Minh City, and the January 1992 edition was recognised as the first to display abstract art in the country.34\n\nWithin the Spirit of Friendship exhibition, nine paintings are on view, representative of the Group of 10 artists' practice from the 1990s, and demonstrating their abstract explorations. Đỗ Hoàng Tường remembers,\n\nIn 1993, the exhibition 'Tac Pham Moi' [Recent Works] at 29 Hang Bai, marked a grand introduction of Saigonese artists in Hanoi, [End Page 157] proposing a different perspective on art practice at the time. This pioneering encounter formed many friendships and collegial connections between North and South (such as our information and art discussion exchange with the 'Gang Of Five')'35.\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\nIn Hanoi, Salon Natasha was also a scene of exchange and community support in the 1990s, with evenings often given over to improvisational experimental performances between poets, musicians and visual artists (amongst others). Natasha Kraevskaia recalls a visit by artist Bonny Bombach (co-founder of the Community Printmakers Murwillumbah or CPM in Australia), who stumbled into the street-front studio of Salon Natasha in 1996 while holidaying in Hanoi. He happened to catch a glimpse of a recently arrived letter from the Queensland Art Gallery, which was an invitation for Vũ Dân Tân to participate in the forthcoming Second Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, a national flagship exhibition in Australia, not far from where Bombach lived. Excited by the prospect of meeting again, Bombach, Vũ Dân Tân and Kraevskaia promised to get in contact if and when they came to Brisbane. This meeting spurred the creation of Crosscurrents, a project in which single artworks by multiple authors were created across two continents between artist-friends of Salon Natasha and CPM. Artworks in ink, watercolour or acrylic on paper were sent back and forth between Vietnam and Australia by mail, with the receiver embellishing and reinterpreting what they were sent with their own response. Sometimes, the artwork would travel back and forth more than twice.\n\nIn the Spirit of Friendship exhibition, a dedicated room presented a selection of these artworks and documentation from this exchange, with the Crosscurrents project illustrating the pre-digital era of envelopes, letters and printed photographs that enabled the process. Kraevskaia comments, \"It is worth a mention that the Hanoi Post office was very supportive, they let the project go on, satisfied by my explanation that it was just a children's game instead of demanding official authorization for posting artworks, as was determined by law at the time.\"36 The fact that a private initiative between two individuals, beginning as a kind of friendship, a game of exchange and exploration could result in a collaborative exhibition attracting support for its showcase in Hanoi (27 March–8 April 1998) and a regional touring show throughout New South Wales, Australia (1998–2000) demonstrates the power of commitment between artists to share their experimentation despite the limits of finance and the significant geographical distance between them.\n\nThe year 1998 was significant for the local art scene in Hanoi, as it marked the birth of one of Vietnam's most resilient independent art spaces— [End Page 158]\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\n[End Page 159]\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\nNhà Sàn.37 Over the last two decades, Nhà Sàn has initiated and staged some of Vietnam's most critical experimental projects, having nurtured generations of artists, while always keeping its doors (and minds) open to those curious enough to step in. Aware that the status of art and artists in Vietnam continued to be officially challenged, and that more artists were responding to contentious historical issues in their work, Nhà Sàn understood early on the necessity of thinking like a \"curator\". This was a role that was little understood or practised in Vietnam at the time, and not found in any of its state institutions. In Vietnam, a curator takes on myriad other roles besides an \"exhibition maker\", often working as a study partner who shares knowledge, researches and debates with artists; and as a mediator who negotiates and connects artists with the public, the authorities and other agents in the cultural field.\n\nNhà Sàn perceived that it was no longer a question of what or who to curate, but rather, how to curate. Nhà Sàn continue to take the multiple roles and functions of a curator in Vietnam as the starting point for their curatorial approach and artistic work. They offer different ways to think about the longevity and sustainability of an art space: relocating four times [End Page 160]\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\nin nearly 20 years and overcoming financial limitations by securing sponsorship from the business sector whilst continuously challenging the nature of curating and documenting art history.\n\nFor Spirit of Friendship, Nhà Sàn Collective proposes a different look into their history by presenting one of the often little-discussed micro-histories of a woman named Lê Thị Lương and widely known as Mẹ Lương, the wife of Nguyễn Mạnh Đức (one of the co-founders of Nhà Sàn Studio), and her kitchen space. Lovingly called \"mẹ\" (\"mother\") by all, Mẹ Lương welcomes, cooks and tends to all artists, visitors or any passers-by, her motherly presence maintaining the organic and family-oriented environment of Nhà Sàn. Located on the ground floor, beneath the living room, her kitchen space opens up an additional meeting point within the architecture of Nhà Sàn Studio itself, enabling for the more private and humble but no less significant chit-chat to take place. Inviting Mẹ Lương to represent the space and the group, and using her kitchen space and self-curated cookbook as source materials, Nhà Sàn Collective metaphorically points to—and to a certain extent reiterates—what it means to make art and to be artists in the context of Vietnam today.\n\nThe final project exhibited in the Leaving a Mark section of the exhibition was Sàn Art Laboratory (2012–16), which was the first independent and locally [End Page 161]\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\ndriven artist-in-residence programme in Vietnam, initiated and organised by Sàn Art in Ho Chi Minh City.38 With a focus on the production of art as a space of knowledge creation via talking, the Sàn Art Laboratory programme ultimately responded to Vietnam's education system and its lack of encouragement for critically sharing artistic ideas via comparative reading, writing and speaking. The first session of Sàn Art Laboratory took place in 2012, with artists Tuấn Mami (Hanoi), Nguyễn Thị Thanh Mai (Hue) and Trương Công Tùng (Ho Chi Minh City) as \"residents\" of the lab (as they locally came to be called). They met their nominated \"talking-partner\" at least twice a month: Mami with artist collective The Propeller Group; Mai with artist Tammy Nguyễn; and Tùng with artist/designer/writer Sita Raiter. In addition to these conversations with assigned \"talking partners\", the \"lab\" residents carried out artist talks, open studio gatherings, group critique and a final group exhibition at Sàn Art. Many impromptu parties were had at the lab, with a constant flow of visitors (resident artists, visiting guests from out of town and the local community) also spending time at the main gallery space and reading room of Sàn Art.\n\nThrough an open call process of application, the focus of the lab was initially Vietnamese artistic production; however, by 2014, it was extended to artists across Southeast Asia. Assessed by an international jury, applicants [End Page 162]\n\nClick for larger view\n\nView full resolution\n\nunder 35 who had portfolios which demonstrated their commitment to experimentation with ideas and materials in their practice were considered—particularly those willing to take part in critique and discussion. Sàn Art Laboratory consequently generated an active community of artists, curators and interdisciplinary thinkers who came together with the pointed purpose of learning from each other's experience and expertise. Trương Công Tùng shares:\n\nIn the Lab, while other artist residents were focused on developing their personal projects into full-fledged exhibitions, I was going from one experiment to another with various materials: from painting with powdered paint, video art, sculpture using polyester, to artworks that are induced from field-work method. Troubled by my confusion, I feared that I could not form a stable approach for myself. But after the Lab ended, it dawned on me that the Lab environment had provided us with an opportunity to experience new media, materials, and art forms—a counter-curriculum to what was being taught at the Fine Art University.

Interestingly, all three artists have since engaged with the impact of context on behaviour, whether it is human or animal in nature, a characteristic also present in their group exhibition realised in 2012. Like many of the 24 alumni of Sàn Art Laboratory, Tuấn Mami, Nguyễn Thị Thanh Mai and Trương Công Tùng have gone on to do significant projects with international presence and critical acclaim."
