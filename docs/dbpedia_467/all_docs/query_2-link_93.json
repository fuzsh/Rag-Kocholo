        "text": "From Socialist Republic of Viet Nam\n\nName\n\nLE Phuc Thi Minh\n\nCountry/ Region of Citizenship\n\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam\n\nGraduated from\n\nVietnam National University\n\nDepartment\n\nDepartment of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (Doctoral)\n\nPrivately-financed student (nominated Monbukagakusho Honors Scholarship for Privately Financed International Students)\n\nHow did you find out about Waseda University?\n\nI am a doctoral student in Waseda University-NIMS Joint Graduate Program. I have known about this program through my friend who has collaboration with Professor Taniguchi Akiyoshi at NIMS, Tsukuba city. He is also a professor of Waseda University and my supervisor now.\n\nWhy did you choose Waseda University?\n\nI have ever joined in master course in Japan before and I really impressed with work and study environment here. Therefore I wanted to come back again. When my friend introduced me to Waseda University-NIMS Joint Graduate Program, I contacted to professor Taniguchi Akiyoshi and luckily he accepted me. And more importantly his research on the nanobiomaterials was matching with my research interests. Furthermore, through information on the internet I know that Waseda University is one of the most famous universities in Japan so I decided to attend in Waseda University.\n\nHow did you get information for our program?\n\nFor the admission into the doctoral program in Waseda University I read and followed the guidance from the university website. In addition, my professor also gave me much helpful information.\n\nDid you have any concerns before coming to Japan?\n\nBefore coming to Japan I was concerned about language and finance. I didn’t know Japanese language so I thought I could get many difficulties in communication and daily life. After coming here, however, almost everything is convenient for me. Japanese are very friendly and enthusiastic, and they always try to communicate with me in English.\n\nThe most second concern is my finance, every month I must save much money for tuition fees. Besides, I wanted to bring my family together so I was afraid I couldn’t afford to pay for our life. Fortunately, after attended Waseda University they gave me a chance to receive Monbukagakusho Honors Scholarship for Privately Financed International Students which helps me very much to pay for my life.\n\nHave you had any difficulties when you started a new life here?\n\nYes. Because I didn’t know Japanese at all before coming here therefore all required procedure for new comer I must have asked support from my supervisor and our group secretary. I also had a small trouble with procedure for pay bills automatically through bank account including electric, gas and water.\n\nHow is your life in Japan and Waseda?\n\nAs you know I am a doctoral student in Waseda University-NIMS Joint Graduate Program so I live and work at NIMS, Tsukuba city. I think everything is good for my family, and we are enjoying the life here. I like my recent research topic and I used most of the time on weekdays for research work. The work condition here is very good, and they have all equipment that needs for my experiment. Additionally, to my life become easier and to understand Japanese culture I also joined Japanese class for beginner and cultural class at NIMS.\n\nWhat do you do in your free time?\n\nI n weekend, my family usually goes out. We do shopping or visiting some parks and places around Tsukuba. Sometime we meet Vietnamese people and have a dinner together.\n\nHow are the relationships with your supervisor and lab members?\n\nThey are really good. My supervisor is very kind and speaks English very well. He supports me so much with my research, gives me excellent advice. The lab members are friendly and cooperative. There are 3 doctoral students in my lab now and we come from the different countries. In lab, we use English to communicate so I don’t have any difficulty at work place. Sometimes we have lunch together to welcome new members or farewell old members. In general the atmosphere in lab is warm and cheerful.\n\nOutline of the research\n\nPolystyrene nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used as a model to study interaction between NPs and cells due to their biocompatible and less toxic to the cells. They have many applications in commercial, medical, pharmaceutical and consumer goods. However there are concerns about the potential toxicity of them to human health and environment including acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, or genetic toxicity. So the need for information regarding mechanism NPs uptake by biological cells as well as cellular response and acute toxicity is imperative. My research focus on the effect of polystyrene NPs on the growth of A431 cell line at two aspects safety of NPs and cellular response under influence of NPs.\n\nWhat is your career goal after your degree completion?\n\nI am considering either post-doctoral study in Japan or in another country or going back my work in Vietnam.\n\nShort message to the prospective students\n\nin English\n\nStudying and working at an international environment has become desire of most students. Nowadays, Japan is one of the most attractive destinations for Vietnamese students due to it has developed economic, science and technology.
