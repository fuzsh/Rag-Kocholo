        "text": "Vietnam is a country rich in culture, beauty, flavor, and smiling faces. So, itâs no wonder that you might be tempted to grace your baby girl with a special Vietnamese name. Whether youâre Vietnamese American, have Vietnamese heritage, or simply appreciate this beautiful country and culture, we have many popular, unique, and beautiful Vietnamese girl names and their meanings for you to choose from.\n\nSelecting Vietnamese Names for Girls\n\nBefore selecting a Vietnamese name for your little one, you may enjoy learning a little more about the naming conventions in Vietnam.\n\nNames are ordered as follows: family name, middle name, given name.\n\nChildren commonly inherit their fatherâs family name; however, these days many take both their motherâs and fatherâs family names.\n\nMany Vietnamese given names are gender-neutral names, including Anh, Dung, Hong, and Khanh.\n\nGiven names can occasionally be two names.\n\nPeople usually address one other by their given names.\n\nGiven names often represent a character trait that parents deem important, or a positive attribute or value. For instance, the name An means âpeace and safety.â Given names can also represent beauty and nature, like the name Lien, which means âlotus.â\n\nPronunciation of Vietnamese Names\n\nVietnamese is a tonal language, so saying a word with a different tone can change the word completely. For example, the word báº¡n means âfriend,â but change the tone to bÃ¡n and it means âto sell.â Change it again to bÃ n and it means âtable.â Itâs all in the tone!\n\nThe Vietnamese alphabet has 29 letters, including 7 letters that donât exist in the English alphabet: Ä, Ã¢, Ã´, Æ¡, Ãª, Æ°, Ä. And interestingly, the Vietnamese alphabet doesn't have the letters f, j, z, and w, as you may notice when you begin to check out our list of Vietnamese girl names.\n\nThe pronunciation of Vietnamese words also depends on where youâre from in Vietnam. The dialect differs in northern, central, and southern Vietnam.\n\nPopular Vietnamese Girl Names\n\nThere are currently about 2.2 million people of Vietnamese descent living in the U.S.A., so, itâs likely you may have come across some Vietnamese female names in your time. Here are some of the most common and popular Vietnamese girl names in Vietnam in recent years.\n\n1. Anh. One of the most common and popular name choices for both boys and girls in Vietnam is Anh. Pronounced AN or IENG, depending on the region you hail from, this sweet name is often used as part of a compound name, as in Anh Ngoc. Anh has various meanings, such as âflower,â âhero,â and âbrave.â 2. Linh. Another popular Vietnamese name is Linh, with its simple yet profound meaning of âspiritâ and âsoul.â This beautiful name is easy to pronounce as either LING or LIN. 3. HÃ . If youâre a lover of the water or youâre expecting a water sign baby (Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces), you could consider this short and sweet name meaning âriver.â 4. Trang. This primarily female Vietnamese name is pronounced CHANG and means âadornment.â 5. PhÆ°Æ¡ng. If spelled like this, PhÆ°Æ¡ng can mean âdirectionâ; if spelled PhÆ°á»£ng, it means âphoenix.â Either way you spell this name, it's pronounced FWUNG. 6. Tháº£o. If you feel connected to nature and greenery, why not try this name, meaning âgrassâ and âherbs.â Itâs pronounced TOW, with ow as in town. 7. Ngá»c. Another top baby girl name that works for both Vietnamese boys and girls is Ngá»c. Once you get used to the pronunciation, NGOWKP, youâll find this an intriguing choice, with its meaning of âjade.â 8. ThÃ¹y. Pronounced TWEE, this name is almost too cute to resist. It has the charming meaning of âfriendship.â 9. Hoa. If you love names inspired by nature, you could go with Hoa. It means âflowerâ and is pronounced HWA. 10. NguyÃªn. Nguyen is actually the most common surname in Vietnam, belonging to 40 percent of the Vietnamese population; however, it can also be used as a girlâs or boyâs first name. This name is usually pronounced using one syllable, such as NWEEN, NWIN, or NWEN. The ng sound at the beginning of a Vietnamese word can be difficult for non-Vietnamese speakers to pronounce.\n\nMore Popular Vietnamese Girl Names\n\nWeâve got even more popular Vietnamese girl names to inspire you:\n\nUnique Vietnamese Girl Names\n\nIf youâre familiar with many of the common Vietnamese girl names but youâd prefer something that stands out from the crowd and reflects how special your little one is, weâve got some unique girl names for you to enjoy.\n\n21. Bian. Here is a very rare Vietnamese name meaning âsecret.â Pronounced BEE-ANH, this sweet name is also a Japanese girlâs name meaning âbeautifulâ and âpeaceful.â 22. BÃ­ch. Donât be thrown off by the spelling of this name. Itâs actually pronounced BIK or BIT and means âbluish green.â So, you can have a unique name and a color scheme ready for your little lady. 23. CÃ . If your baby girl is your first child, this unique name could be appealing as it means âfirstâ or âeldest.â 24. Dáº­u.

Meaning âexcellentâ or âfamily,â Gia could almost be mistaken for a Western name; however, itâs pronounced ZA or YA. Just like the letter D in Vietnamese, the Gi is also pronounced as Z in the north or Y in the south of Vietnam. 27. Loan. In East Asian mythology, Loan (pronounced LWAN) is the name of a bird. If youâre a fan of mythology or the symbolism of birds, this name might be an interesting choice. 28. May. This sweet name means âlucky,â or if spelled MÃ¢y, it means âcloud.â Both options add a charming element to this name, which is often used in English-speaking countries for those born in the month of May. This name is a sure winner for your baby girl. 29. PhÃºc. Here's a name that may seem unusual; however, itâs relatively common in Vietnam and has the lovely meanings of âhappinessâ and âgood fortune.â The pronunciation is FUWKP. 30. Tuyáº¿t.
