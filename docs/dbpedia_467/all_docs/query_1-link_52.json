        "text": "On June 27, 2018, Vu Tien Chi, with Dinh Van Hai, went to visit Minh Hanh because she was being attacked harshly at that time. After Dinh Van Hai live-streamed at Minh Hanh’s house, showing her dangerous situation in her house, Chi and Hai went back home.\n\nAt around 12:00 pm, two thugs followed and attacked them with wooden and iron sticks when they were at National Way 20, Lien Dam Commune, Di Linh District, Lam Dong Province. After Hai and Chi fell off their motorbike, they continued beating them harshly, causing Hai’s broken right hand and left clavicle shoulder.\n\nDetails of Imprisonment\n\nVu Tien Chi is a vocal activist for democratization and human rights. He usually utilizes Facebook and other online tools to voice his concerns about various issues including the South China Sea and corruption.
