To celebrate, you can read these brilliant children’s books with Asian and Pacific Islander representation.\n\nNot only are the books beautiful and well-written stories, but they also are tools for inclusivity, education, and empathy building. You’ll find picture books, chapter books, middle grade books, and a few YA books, all of which I’ve personally read and reviewed.\n\nBefore, during, and after reading, TALK about these AAPI heritage month stories.\n\nAsk children, “What do you have in common with the characters?”\n\nIf the culture is new to readers, ask children, “What did you learn about the characters or culture?”\n\nFinally, in the wake of violence against Asian Americans, it’s more important than ever to discuss kindness towards other people, all people.\n\nModel that you are a kind person and help your child know that you want them to show kindness and support towards people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent.\n\nAsia and the Pacific Islands are comprised of many countries and cultures.\n\nTo that end, I also have other book lists representing more specific AAPI countries and areas of the world:\n\nSoutheast Asia (books set in Pakistan, India, Myanmar, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and others)\n\nIndia\n\nJapan\n\nChina\n\nEast Asia (books set in China, Mongolia, Tibet, Nepal, Singapore, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and others)\n\nMuslim Main Characters\n\nBelow, you’ll find the following:\n\n(Click to jump to the section you want.)\n\nGet the Printable Book List\n\n​\n\nThis form collects information we will use to send you book lists and news.

It’s a sensory, lyrical celebration of Asian eyes; a body-positive ode filled with self-acceptance and confidence as a little girl shares her thoughts on who she is and who the women in her family are, including her little sister and her Amah. “My eyes crinkle into crescents moons and sparkle like the stars. Gold flecks dance and twirl while stories whirl in their oolong pools, carrying tales of the past and hope for the future.”\n\nEyes That Speak to the Stars written by Joanna Ho, illustrated by Dung Ho\n\nThe little boy feels sad seeing a classmate’s hurtful picture showing his eyes as two lines. Later, looking at Agong’s wise eyes and Di-Di’s (baby brother) eyes like his, eyes that Baba says rise up to the sky and speak to the stars, the boy feels pride in his powerful, visionary eyes. Empowering and important.\n\nNatsumi written by Susan Lendroth, illustrated by Priscilla Burris\n\nIn a story rich with Japanese culture and acceptance of individuality, you’ll love Natsumi, a little girl who likes to do everything with exuberance. All other adults tell Natsumi to not be so loud, hard, or fast — but not Grandfather. Grandfather doesn’t scold her. He sees Natsumi’s strengths so he takes her to taiko drumming classes … where she can be herself — loud and fast!\n\nGibberish written and illustrated by Young Vo\n\nBrilliant, metaphorical illustrations move from cartooney black and white to realistic color to illuminate Vo’s exceptional storytelling. Dat moves to a new country where he doesn’t speak the language– it sounds like gibberish. And gibberish is everywhere–the books and the air. Until someone unexpected drops in– and his new friend Julie helps Dat learn words. One friend makes all the difference. It’s a must-share book that beautifully shows the challenges of language learning.\n\nRamen for Everyone written by Patricia Tanumihardja, illustrated by Shiho Pate\n\nHiro loves his dad’s ramen. He wants to make his own ramen and share it with his family. But his attempts fail — and with anger, he throws it all in the trash. His dad reminds him that Hiro’s family appreciates his cooking and it doesn’t have to be perfect. So Hiro starts again and customizes his bowls of ramen noodles for each person with things that they like and that Hiro can cook. (Growth mindset!)\n\nFriends are Friends Forever written by Dane Liu, illustrated by Lynn Scurfield\n\nIt’s hard to move to a new country!

The new friends eat special food and make red paper ornaments together in a celebration of friendship. Stunning illustrations.\n\nTen Blocks to the Big Wok written and illustrated by Ying-Hwa Hu\n\nBilingual in English and Mandarin, this is a playful story of a girl and her dad walking ten blocks through Chinatown, counting things they see such as four miniature trees on the fourth block and seven silk fans on the seventh block.

Pak’s atmospheric, stylized watercolor illustrations and Loomis’s lyrical text show the many “hardworking hands, so wise and old, that pick the kalo to make the poi to share with ‘ohana, the loved ones.” Readers see the ohana’s connection to the earth in rain, sun, and mud. Finally, the family gathers at the end of the day together on a beach to eat and celebrate.\n\nBilal Cooks Daal written by Aisha Saeed, illustrated by Anoosha Syed\n\nBilal tells his friends all about daal. Together, they carefully prepare the ingredients, then wait as the flavors mix together. While they’re waiting, they play outside.

This story makes me want to eat daal, too — it’s a savory introduction to this lentil dish from South Asia as well as a warm-hearted example of sharing traditional foods with friends from other cultures.\n\nThe Bath House written by Kyo Maclear, illustrated by Gracey Zhang\n\nExperience a happy day spent in the bath with your beloved aunties and grandma (baachan); it’s a day that celebrates a Japanese cultural tradition from the author’s childhood as well as families and female bodies of all shapes and sizes. Yes, this book shows naked bodies with hair and plenty of details. “You’ll all dip your bodies, your newly sprouting, gangly bodies, your saggy, shapely, jiggly bodies, your cozy, creased, ancient bodies. Beautiful bodies.“\n\nOur Favorite Day written and illustrated by Joowon Oh\n\nThere’s a beauty in the predictability and minimal description of Papa’s daily routine.

In town, he buys craft supplies and gets two orders of dumplings to go. Then, he spends the afternoon with his granddaughter who is just as happy to see him as he is to see her. I love the joy in this relationship!

To help her be brave about going alone, Grandma gives her magical brave glasses. Grandma reminds her to share her aloha, “Be helpful. Be giving. Be brave.” On the way to the market, Punky uses that advice and helps a pig, a bee, and a little boy.\n\nA Morning with Grandpa written by Sylvia Liu, illustrated by Christina Forshay\n\nWhat strikes me immediately about this picture book is the warm-hearted, loving relationship between the grandpa and the granddaughter. Even when the granddaughter does things differently than her grandpa, he is very accepting of her silly ways. And vice-versa. In the end, they both learn from each other during their morning practices of Tai Chi and yoga. Because it’s about being together, trying your best, and not being perfect.\n\nThe Katha Chest written by Radhiah Chowdhury, illustrated by Lavanya Naidu\n\nIn a beautifully-narrated picture book with rich sensory images and gorgeous illustrations, Asiya looks through her beloved Nanu’s katha chest of quilts.

Later, Priya makes her Babi Ba paper orange marigolds for their doorway in the U.S. to remind her. I adore the writing, the illustrations, and the story that celebrate India’s culture as well as a close grandparent-grandchild relationship.\n\nAmah Faraway written by Margaret Chiu Greanias, illustrated by Tracy Subisak\n\nA visit to a new country feels strange at first… Amah lives in Taipei.
