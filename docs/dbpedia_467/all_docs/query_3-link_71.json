Intellectuals like Truong Gia Binh could not apply their knowledge in practice, nor could they support themselves.\n\nBut adversity is an opportunity to generate ideas: Truong Gia Binh founded the Heat Exchange group, determined to make money-making contracts to support each other in science.\n\nContracts: \"Da Lat nuclear reactor for heat load\", \"Drying system\" of the drug factory is Dong Naiâ¦ But these contracts are not their dream yet.\n\nIn early 1988, academician Nguyen Van Dao signed with the USSR Academy of Sciences a contract to exchange equipment. This is an opportunity for the Heat Exchanger team to take on this mission. Truong Gia Binh thought of building an organization with its own name as a suitable legal entity. In September 1988, FPT Company was born with Truong Gia Binh as its director.\n\nIn the early days, FPT operated in many industries to earn money for technology research. Later, Truong Gia Binh thought: âSoftware must be exported; If the Indians can do it, I can do it too!\"\n\nAnd, the determination of Vietnamese intelligence has put Vietnam on the world's \"digital map\": converting 1532 applications with a value of US$6.5 million has been received by a large Malaysian oil and gas company.\n\nIn 1999, a group of Vietnamese students who participated in the international computer science competition in Turkey achieved excellent results.

Finally, in April 1996, Thai Tuan textile factory was formed.\n\nThai Tuan's products ensure enough quality to compete with imported goods, but the market has not yet accepted it because of the psychology of branded products and imported goods.

His company has participated in many activities to help the poor, he has contributed 1 million dollars to support the Japanese people devastated by the tsunami because he thinks Japan has helped Vietnam a lot through ODA.\n\nTuan Chau Group is the Top 100 Vietnamese Gold Stars; Awarded The Guide Award and numerous certificates of merit. Dao Hong Tuyen himself won the Outstanding Entrepreneur 2009-2010, was awarded many medals and certificates of merit.\n\nWhat has helped Dao Hong Tuyen achieve such success? According to him, it is knowledge, it is science and technology. The marketplace is a battlefield without guns, he said, where knowledge is still the deciding factor. Intangible capital is wisdom that will create countless tangible things (money, houses, land...), but intangible capital cannot be bought. Therefore, he knows that the knowledge left behind by the old regime is a valuable resource. He used to bail people who crossed the border were arrested because he knew they were talented. This job is very dangerous, but he still does it because he believes he is doing the right thing. Abandoned factory, scrap iron and steel after the war, technical staff of the old regime he turned into production technology.\n\nHow to exploit that resource, manage thousands of workers, that is general knowledge and leadership qualities. Whoever has those qualities will be successful.\n\nDANG LE NGUYEN VO with Trung Nguyen Coffee\n\nDang Le Nguyen Vu was born in 1971 in Khanh Hoa. In 1979, his family moved to Dak Lak. In 1987, when he was 16 years old, his father died, the family fell into difficulties, he had to work to earn money to go to school. In 1992, he entered the Medical School of Tay Nguyen University. While studying in the third year of medical school, Dang Le Nguyen Vu realized that he was \"misplaced\", not interested in this medical profession, he decided to quit school. His mother was crying like rain, trying to convince. But he thinks that it is better to lose 6 years of medical school than to regret making his life useless. He was determined to go to Saigon to find his cousin. He absolutely believes that he is not begging, he is just asking others for a chance, which makes him not discouraged.\n\nArriving in Saigon, his uncle advised him to take it slow because he was still very young, go back to Ban Me Thuot to complete the study program and then let's be good. Obediently, he returned to complete his medical degree. Not working as a doctor, he is determined to process the best coffee and export it to the world market. You know, Buon Ma Thuot has the best Robusta coffee in the world, is the coffee center of Vietnam, but his coffee farmers are still poor. While other countries do not grow a single coffee tree, they still benefit from coffee thanks to processing and packaging technology... because Vietnamese coffee is only exported raw.\n\nMany people consider him a \"heavy madman\", but three friends \"feel\" his brand dream and agree to help. He went to the coffee buying agent and asked them to lend him a few kilograms of coffee, he roasted and then left the shops. Seeing him as a decent and aspirational person, he created conditions.\n\nIn August 1996, the first Trung Nguyen coffee shop was born. All stages of roasting, grinding and processing took place in a wooden house of 2.8 square meters .\n\nUp to now, 2012, Trung Nguyen's revenue is 200 million USD, products are present in more than 60 countries around the world. Legendee weasel coffee becomes the Cultural Diplomacy Ambassador of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was honored as King of Coffee, Top 50 Pioneers 2012, he founded the Fund for Innovation and received many other noble titles.\n\nAlthough he has achieved such results, he still has other dreams.\n\nFor thousands of years, Vietnamese farmers are still poor and backward. Meanwhile, we export rice, coffee, tea, pepper... In the current and upcoming climate change, demand is increasing, agriculture is the \"soft power\", but Vietnam does not hold get that power to control the game. So, we have to redo this big problem.\n\nHow can agricultural productivity increase 10 times, 20 times, that is the potential. What is the intelligence of Vietnamese people for? In fact, there are countries that are many times more difficult than us, but they have done it.\n\nAs for coffee, it is a ârenewable black gold mineâ, thanks to technology, packaging, presentation, storytelling. Knowing how, it will be a sustainable resource for the nation.\n\nTo the young generation, he entrusts:\n\nYoung people today have much more conditions than previous generations: wired and wireless technology, learning opportunities, international exchanges, access to financial resources, markets... But the main thing is core is ambition, will, spirit and desire to be strong.\n\nMust \"look around the globe\" to see many valuable lessons around, know how to take international lessons to handle their basic problems well. Knowledge, learning, and discovery must be considered as the joy of life. You have to study all your life because if you don't keep up with the times, you will be eliminated.\n\nAnd when thinking changes, life changes.\n\nGian Tu Trung with Pace TrÆ°á»ng School\n\nGian Tu Trung was born in 1974 in Nghe An. He attended high school in Nha Trang and then studied at Saigon University of Economics. He completed his Master's program in Geneva, then was a long-term PhD student in London (UK).\n\nGian Tu Trung started his business quite early, ups and downs and stuck with Cho Lon plastic base. After that, he worked as a consultant at three leading consulting and auditing firms in the world, then returned to work at the State Securities Commission in Hanoi.\n\nIn the end, Gian Tu Trung realized that the teaching profession and the education career were the most suitable for his nature. He and his partner founded PACE - a specialized school for entrepreneurs, with a \"mission\" to contribute to shaping a new business economy in Vietnam.\n\nPACE always upholds the value of real learning, non-degree since its establishment since 2001, the school has deployed thousands of courses, with 110 training programs for more than 80,000 leaders, directors, entrepreneurs. of companies, groups, organizations at home and abroad. The university has also organized international seminars with the participation of \"top minds\" from around the world. The school has built a bookcase of Doanh Tri and also contributed to in-depth research on education through the establishment of the IRED Institute with the policy of enlightening education for a civilized society.\n\nGian Tu Trung is a member of the Executive Council of the Asian Comparative Education Association and a member of the US National Association for Educational Research. He was awarded the \"Young Global Leader\" award by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2013.\n\nGian Tu Trung believes that human enlightenment is to distinguish \"who is who\", \"what is what\" and \"who I am\". According to him, there is only one way for each person to become an enlightened person, which is the \"real learning\" way. Therefore, good books and precious books will play an important and pioneering role in educational reform and social enlightenment.\n\nHe said, whether you are an owner or an employee, a boss or a soldier, a mandarin or a citizen, a teacher or a workerâ¦ all is not important. The important thing is to do what you're best at, in line with your personality best, and create the most value.\n\nForm yourself, this self is very sacred. That is culture â individual culture! It is the thing/values ââthat make someone or something something for which, or to protect it, one is willing to sacrifice everything else. Because culture is not only something that helps people not to fall into the \"deep\"; recognize and move away from the bad, the evil, but also the thing that helps people overcome the \"high pass\"; overcome all difficulties and adversities towards the right and the beautiful.\n\nToday, the deep integration makes the crisis among young people more severe. And the task of young people, is not only concerned with overcoming the crisis, but also how to think of ways to prevent such a crisis from happening again. Because besides the problems posed, a time of crisis like this is also an opportunity for young people to look at themselves, because \"change comes from me\".\n\nPart 2 â Seeing the world\n\nTOP 20 RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 2013\n\nThe top 20 is Carlos Slim Helu and his family of America Movil company with a fortune of $ 73 billion. The person at the bottom of this Top 20 list is Larry Page of Google company with a fortune of $23 billion.\n\nThe total wealth of 20 billionaires accounted for 0.0366% of world GDP in 2012.\n\nPLEASE, TEACH MY SON\n\n(The famous letter to the Teacher)\n\nPlease teach my children these things:\n\n1. Not everyone is fair, honest. But for every scoundrel we meet, there will be a righteous person somewhere.\n\n2. A dollar of your hard work is much more valuable than the $5 you earn.\n\n3. Know how to accept defeat and how to enjoy the joy of winning.\n\n4. Know that the people who bully others the most are the ones most easily defeated.\n\n5. Seeing the magical world of books and having enough time to quietly reflect on the mysteries of life.\n\n6. Know how to listen and filter what you hear. Be gentle with those who are gentle and tough with those who are rough.\n\n7. Know how to smile when sad and know that there is no shame in tears.\n\n8. Know how to ridicule the cynical and beware of the sweet, full of traps.\n\n9. You can sell your muscles and brains for the highest price, but never sell your heart and soul.\n\n10. Knows how to turn a blind eye to the screaming crowd but stand up straight to defend what he thinks is right.\n\n11. Please be gentle with me, but don't pamper me because I need testing to train.\n\n12. You must always have absolute faith in yourself in order to have absolute faith in humanity.\n\nSTEVE JOBS gives a speech at Stanford University\n\nFirst story:\n\nI never had a university degree. This is my closest approach to a graduation.\n\nSo, why did I drop out of school? Since all of my parents' savings had to go into paying for my school fees, I didn't find it effective. I started dropping the required subjects that I wasn't interested in and only enrolled in the subjects I was interested in. I dropped out and decided to just enroll in a literacy class to find out how they do it. This is an artistic and historical subject that science cannot grasp, and I find it magical. Trying to follow your passion and satisfy your curiosity is priceless. I didn't have a place in the dorm, so I slept on the floor of my friends, exchanging soft drink bottles for 5 cents to buy food.\n\nBut 10 years later, when we designed the Macintosh, everything was back in me. If I hadn't dropped out, I would never have taken a typography class, and Mac computers probably wouldn't have the rich font system they have today.\n\nSo believe, the dots, the events in your life in one way or another will affect your future. You have to have faith in something â courage, life destiny, destiny or whatever â that way of thinking has made all the difference in my life.\n\nSecond story:\n\nI founded Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20 years old, we worked hard for 10 years and grew into a $2 billion company with 4,000 employees. We gave birth to the creative fruit â the Macintosh â when I turned 30.\n\nApple has hired someone who I think is talented enough to run the company with me. Everything went well. But then, our vision for the future was different and could not be merged, the management sided with him. At the age of 30, I was fired from the company (fired at the company I founded!). What I've been chasing all my life is gone.\n\nI still love what I do, I decided to do it all over again. I founded NeXT and Pixar. Pixar created the world's first computer graphics movie. Apple acquired NeXT. I'm back on the Apple revival mission. I'm sure none of the above would have happened if I hadn't been fired by Apple. It's like a bitter and terrible medicine, but the patient needs it.\n\nSometimes life will hit you in the head with a brick, don't lose faith. I understand that the only thing that keeps me steady is passion. Do what you believe it will be great.\n\nThird story:\n\nI read somewhere: âIf you live each day as if it were your last, one day you will be rightâ.\n\nAlways thinking that I will die soon is the most important tool to help me make the big decisions in life. Because almost everything from hope, pride, fear, shame or failure will disappear when you will face death. When there's nothing left, there's no reason not to listen to what your heart tells you.\n\nNo one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. But death is the destination that we all have to reach, no one can escape it. Death as the best invention of life. It is a life changer.\n\nYour time is short, don't waste it living someone else's life.\n\nPart 3 â Vietnam âin my eyesâ\n\nWHAT WE ARE AND WHERE ARE?\n\nVietnam has an area of ââ331,212 km2 ( ranked 66th/world), with a population of 92 million people (ranked 14th/world). In which, the labor force is 49 million people (ranked 13th in the world) and the population under 25 years old reaches 43%.\n\nPower output: 117 billion kWh (ranked 32nd in the world), crude oil 336,100 barrels per day (ranked 33rd in the world), natural gas 9.3 billion m3 ( ranked 45th in the world).\n\nThere are 127,318 million mobile subscribers (ranked 17th/world), and 23,382 million internet users (ranked 17th/world).\n\nGDP: $325.9 billion (2012) (ranked 42nd/world)\n\nAverage GDP: 3,600 USD/person (ranked 170/world)\n\nForeign exchange reserve of 23.88 billion USD (ranked 56/world), competitiveness ranked 75/144 countries and human development index ranked 127/187 countries.\n\nHaven't escaped the middle income trap yet.\n\nTOP 20 RICHEST PEOPLE IN VIETNAM 2013\n\nThe top 20 leader is Mr. Pham Nhat Vuong of Vingroup with assets of VND 18,125 billion.\n\nThe person ranked 20th is Mr. Nguyen Duy Hung of Saigon Securities Joint Stock Company with assets of VND 609 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the 20 richest people in Vietnam in 2013 was US$1,019,362,671, accounting for 0.0072% of Vietnam's GDP in 2012.\n\nLETTER TO A FRIEND by Professor Tran Huu Dung, Ohio University, USA\n\nI only see you from my podium and through your pressing letters, I feel that: you have just had faith in the future, but that belief is disturbed by the present.\n\nI thought: \"Each generation has to find a future for itself\". Although, our generation has devoted and sacrificed a lot for the country, but we still feel guilty that we did not prepare for your future, and left a country with many dark patches.\n\nWhen the \"market\" whirlwind covered our country, a part of the \"intellectual\" was corrupted, caught up in privacy, hypocrisy made many of you bored and sad. I dare not speak on behalf of anyone, I have to apologize to you.\n\nBut no matter what the present is, the future will come, and that future is in your hands.\n\nThe world changes at a rapid and profound pace, that is the process of so-called \"globalization\", it will bring you countless opportunities, get ready. But it also raises many issues that you need to think about.\n\nFirst of all, the preservation of ethnicity because it will reflect feelings for the homeland, the country, its roots. How to exploit opportunities while preserving our uniqueness.\n\nSecond, globalization does not mean that you are an international citizen and no longer a citizen of a country. Depending on your situation and profession, you should \"do something\" for your people. It is not necessary that you return to your home country, but living in the heart of your nation, you will also receive love and affection that cannot be found anywhere else.\n\nGlobalization means that there are no national borders, but old conflicts will reappear in other ways. Be sober, not naive. Cooperation to find common solutions is necessary but not forgetting the actual interests of the country.\n\nAnother face causes a tension between a technology-based culture, a market economy and a humanistic culture whose image is literature and art. Preserving âtraditional valuesâ and promoting humanistic literature will require your creativity.\n\nThe integration brings with it many potential dangers, the hustle and bustle life, no time to look back. You should take some time to settle down and meditate.\n\nTake care of those in need. A society where everyone is \"kind\" to each other, everyone has the opportunity to progress is a beautiful society, worth living.\n\nYouth is not only a preparation for the future, but also a period of reality of your own life. Enjoy your youth.\n\nLet's keep the faith and actively implement it together, because it is our duty to ourselves.\n\nVIETNAMESE PEOPLE LIGHT THEIR cigarette lighters\n\nArticle by Dr. Giap Van Duong, formerly working in the UK, Singapore, currently working in Hanoi:\n\nVietnam, we are in a difficult time: in the country, there is inflation, the economy is difficult, production is reduced, many businesses go bankrupt. In addition to the East Sea, China constantly causes tension. In the world, the situation is not very bright.\n\nMany people are very pessimistic. Personally, instead of looking at the gray picture forever, I look at young Vietnamese people. I believe in youth. It is youth who will be the savior of the country.\n\nBut I don't judge, I just observe youth. They are living. Do your best sometimes. Sometimes jittery. Sometimes wobbly. But they are certainly alive. Where there is life, there is growth.\n\nIM worry. Sometimes to the point of torment, irritation because of feelings of injustice and helplessness. I did not see the spread of a free and liberal youth, the brilliance of aspiration.\n\nI have a sharp feeling of pain because there are so many dark, lackluster faces, too many skinny young people who are sicker than our generation during the subsidy period.\n\nI asked them why? â We have difficulties â I listen to my heart. There is something very absurd here. Is that abandonment? Many young people have struggled on their own, struggling with the bare minimum of daily needs, exhausting them! Even they lose confidence, lose their valuable asset, which is youth.\n\nWhose fault? Not really the fault of the young people. It is certainly the fault of part of the forerunners, of the system, of society that have partly abandoned them.\n\nYouth is not a distant future but the reality of the country.\n\nThe country needs to rise. Therefore, for young Vietnamese, a rise to self is necessary. When groping in the dark, there is no other way to light a torch for yourself, to make your own way forward.\n\nLive, create, fly, explore, believe in yourself, cultivate great aspirations. It is not anyone else, but the young Vietnamese who are the saviors of the country."
