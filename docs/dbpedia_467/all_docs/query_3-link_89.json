Residents of Tokyo seek out Ueno Park for rest, relaxation, and recreation. On a visit to the park complete with ancient buildings, trees and flowers, they can get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city. In New York City, tourists and locals alike make use of Central Park. Four kilometers long and nearly a kilometer wide, the park offers meadows, playing fields, and trails for walking, running, or biking. Around the world, cities have begun to preserve or extend their green space – a good thing because recent research indicates just how important nature is to our mental health.\n\nOverall, nature seems to have positive effects on people’s emotions and thinking. It helps calm and focus the mind. And, being exposed to nature has been shown to reduce negative emotions like frustration and stress.\n\nIn addition to the calming effect of nature, it seems to have the ability to help people focus. One reason may be that there is much less visual input, or things to pay attention to, in nature. When you walk down a city street, paying attention can be a laborious process. There are so many things competing for your attention all at once: traffic lights, honking cars, taxis picking up passengers, and the wail of police and ambulance sirens. You’re constantly focusing on one thing, and then the next, trying to decide what you really need to pay attention to. In a related study at the University of Michigan, students were tested in one of two situations: walking through a park or walking down a busy city street. Those who had walked through the park had better moods and did better on a test of attention and working memory than those who had walked through the city.\n\nResearch is helping us understand the reasons why parks appeal to city residents so much. Policymakers and city planners should pay attention. Parks are not just pretty – they reduce stress, frustration, and violence.\n\nThey help people focus and remember better. Not only are individuals happier and calmer, but cities as a whole may function better.\n\nQuestion44: Which can best serve as the title for the passage? A. The Power of Urban Nature B. The Busy Life of Cities C. Green Space and Rural Life D. Nature and Its Effects on Students Question45: The word extend in paragraph is closest in meaning to ______. A. examine B. reduce C. make wider D. keep quieter Question46: Which of the following in NOT mentioned as a positive effect of nature? A. It makes people feel calm. B. It reduces frustration and stress. C. It helps people focus better. D. It reduces noise from traffic. Question47: The wordlaborious in paragraph 3 most probably means ______. A. difficult B. pleasant C. simple D. long Question48: Which of the following is true, according to the passage? A. Spending time in nature can improve our thinking and our emotional health. B. In nature, people can pay better attention because of more visual input. C. In the city, there are far fewer things and it is harder to focus. D. Policymakers and city planners should know that parks are not pretty. Question49: The word they in paragraph 4 refers to ______. A. planners B. reasons C. parks D. residents Question50: What can be inferred from the passage? A. More research is needed on the reasons why parks are essential to city residents. B. When in the city, you shouldn’t pay much attention to the things around. C. More green space should be made accessible to every city resident. D. For sustainable development of cities, green space should be taken into account.\n\n---THEEND—\n\nĐÁPÁN\n\n1. C 6. A 11. B 16. D 21. D 26. D 31. B 36. D 41. B 46. D\n\n2. B 7. C 12. A 17. D 22. C 27.

Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D to indicate the correct word or phrase that best fits each the numbered blanks. One of the most important (34)_______ of a standardized test is time. You'll only be allowed a certain number of minutes for each section, so it is very important that you use your time wisely. The most important time strategy is pacing yourself. Before you begin, take just (35)__seconds to survey the test, noting the wisely of questions and the sections that looks easier than the rest. Then, make a rough time schedule based on the amount of time available to you. Mark the halfway point on your test and make a note beside that mark of the time when the testing period is half over. Once you begin the test, continue moving. If you work slowly in an attempt to (36) fewer mistakes, your mind will become bored and begin to wander. You'll end up with far more mistakes if you're not concentrating. If you take too long to answer questions that stump you, you may end up running out of time before you finish. So don't stop for difficult questions. Skip them and move on. You can come back to them later if you have time. A question that takes you five seconds to answer counts as much as one (37)__takes you several minutes, so pick up the easy points first. (38), answering the easier questions first helps build your confidence and gets you in the testing groove. If you're a little ahead, you know you're on track and may even have a little time left to check your work. If you're a little behind, you have several choices. You can pick up the pace a little, but do this only if you can do it comfortably.

Zoo officials say that they are concerned about animals. However, most zoos remain \"collections\" of interesting \"items\" rather than protective habitats. Zoos teach people that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity. However, animals in zoos are bored, limited, lonely, and far from their natural homes. Zoos claim to educate people, but in fact, visitors don't learn anything meaningful about the natural behavior, intelligence, or beauty of animals. Most zoo areas are quite small, and visitors can rarely observe animals’ normal behavior in these unnatural spaces. The animals are kept together in small spaces, with no privacy and little opportunity for mental stimulation or physical exercise. This results in abnormal and self-destructive behavior called zoochosis. A worldwide study of zoos found that zoochosis is common among animals in small spaces or cages. For example, Bears spend 30 percent of their time walking back and forth. These are all signs of distress. Zoos also claim to save animals from extinction. However, zoos that breed endangered animals, such as big cats and Asian elephants, often do not release them to the wild. Ultimately, we will save endangered species only if we save their habitats. We also need to stop people from killing them. Instead of supporting zoos, we should support groups that work to protect animals and preserve their homes in the wild.

Human blood comes in four different types, namely A, B, AB and O. In most of the world, most people are ignorant of which blood type they possess, since it is important only if they have to undergo an operation which requires a blood transfusion. In Japan, however, things are different, since a large proportion of the population believes that blood type determines personality and, as a result, over 90% of the population are aware which type they are. This linking of blood type and personality has ramifications across life, but is especially prominent in prospective relationships and employment. For example, in Japan one popular way to meet romantic partners is to go to specialised venues which conduct speed dating. A single man and woman sit alone together at a table for just a few minutes. Then a bell rings, and they go to sit with someone new. Some such venues hold dating sessions which are limited to men or women of a particular blood type. For those who believe in the blood-type theory, this seems to maximise their chance of finding someone special. The current popularity of the idea exploded in the 1970s following the publication of a book by Masahiko Nomi, even though he was a lawyer and broadcaster who had no medical or psychological training. His ideas were largely anecdotal, and many critics thought it mere superstition, but the book nevertheless sparked great interest in the general public. Now his son, Toshitaka, continues to promote the theory, and nowadays it is ubiquitous in Japanese popular culture, featuring on morning TV, women’s magazines and best-selling self-help books. Much like horoscopes in the West, the blood group theory is regularly debunked by scientific experimentation, yet it retains popular appeal. Perhaps one reason for this is that it helps to break the ice in social situations. Japanese people do not always find it easy to express their opinions, so discussing blood types is an indirect way of telling people what you think of them. Question44. What could be the best title for the passage? A. The blood-type theory B. Blood and its functions C. Different theories about blood type D. Masahiko Nomi, a famous author Question45. How is the blood-type theory used in speed dating? A. People go to tables according to their blood types. B. Dating couples talk about the theory and what it means. C. Some people want to meet only people of a particular blood type. D. People try to guess the blood type of their date. Question46. What is TRUE about the popularity of the blood-type theory? A. It became popular due to the writings of a father-and-son team. B. It is popular because of a traditional idea in Japanese culture. C. It is not as popular as it was in the 1970s. D. It became popular following experiments conducted by Masahiko Nomi. Question47. It can be inferred from the passage that in Japan\n\nA. people associate blood types solely with personality traits.
