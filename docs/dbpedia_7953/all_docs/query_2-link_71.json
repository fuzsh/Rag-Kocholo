        "text": "A new true crime series involving European royals has been set at Exactly Right Media and Blanchard House.\n\nTitled “The Butterfly King,” the serialized narrative podcast tells the story of the mystery surrounding King of Bulgaria’s shocking death.\n\n“When King Boris III of Bulgaria dies amid mysterious circumstances during World War II, there’s no shortage of suspects,” reads the logline. “But more than eighty years later, his death remains unsolved. This eight-episode limited podcast will delve into the mysterious death of the Butterfly King, taking listeners on a gripping journey and following a trail of dissidents, poisoners, soldiers and spies to unravel eighty years of lies and cover-ups. This tragic family saga of a doomed royal dynasty is a story of treachery, deceit and a quest for the truth.”\n\nThe series is written and produced by Emma Jane Kirby and hosted by “Hooked on Freddie” presenter Becky Milligan. The first episode is set to drop on all major podcast platforms on March 21 and will be followed by new episodes weekly.\n\n“This story is grand,” said Blanchard House co-founder Rosie Pye. “It’s like ‘The Crown,’ crossed with Sherlock Holmes – full of palaces, poisoning and international intrigue (after all he was the cousin to Queen Elizabeth), but it’s also a very personal story. He was the King but he was also a father – and it’s his two children who open up their hearts and lead this story: Who wanted him dead? Who had the opportunity to kill him? And who really was this man?”\n\nKaren Kilgariff, CEO of Exactly Right Media, added: “We’re excited to present ‘The Butterfly King’ to our audience. This journalistic exploration of true crime is sure to captivate podcast listeners.”"
