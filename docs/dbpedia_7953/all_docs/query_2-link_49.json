        "text": "Butterfly Book Report Projects:\n\nColorful Butterfly & Story Elements Butterfly\n\nA very DETAILED description about this resource set is provided below.\n\nButterfly Book Report Templates:\n\nColorful Butterfly & Story Elements Butterfly\n\nButterfly Book Report Projects\n\nWhat's Included?\n\nButterflies are one of the most colorful creatures that can be found, and this butterfly book report project focuses on colorful writing.\n\nStudents have to find examples of the author using colorful verbs and adjectives in their book. Then, they have to write a colorful description of the main character and explain why the plot of the book is colorful and interesting.\n\nThis Butterfly Book Report Project will provide you with all of the teaching resources that you need for your students to review finding and using descriptive verbs and adjectives, and then using colorful verbs and adjectives in their own writing to describe the main character and plot of their book.\n\nColorful Butterfly Book Report Project Video:\n\nTraditionally, requiring students to find examples of verbs and adjectives in a book is a task that most students find quite boring. Before students start this task, they are given example sentences of descriptive verbs and adjectives on their first draft worksheets.\n\nThese first draft worksheets also contain examples from the book The Twits by Roald Dahl and example sentences of how Roald Dahl uses descriptive verbs and adjectives in his writing. By using this butterfly book report project that emphasizes colorful writing, your students will want to spread their wings and fly into these grammar and writing activities.\n\nBoth butterfly book report projects contain five worksheet templates that assemble into a butterfly. The finished butterfly projects measures 14 inches in width and 14 inches in height.\n\nThese finished book report projects will make a colorful classroom bulletin board display of your students' work. Everything that you need to complete these projects is included in this resource set. All that you will need is scissors, glue, tape, and coloring pencils.\n\nThere are 17 worksheets and template pages in each butterfly book report project, as well as a 5 page color bulletin board display banner. There are 13 pages of flower accent pieces that match the flowers in the bulletin board banner, for you to use to help you decorate your bulletin board display.\n\nAssembling Directions:\n\nThis set includes an assembly directions worksheet on how to prepare and assemble the butterfly project.\n\nBelow is an example of the colorful butterfly assembly directions worksheet.\n\nBelow is an example of the story elements butterfly assembly directions worksheet.\n\nGrading Rubric:\n\nThis butterfly book report project includes a grading rubric.\n\nI believe that it is important for students to evaluate their own work, so my grading rubric contains both a student assessment and a teacher assessment component. When the students grade their work, they color in the faces. When the teacher grades the work, the teacher circles the small numbers in each box beside the faces. I often find that my students are harsher on themselves than I am, and that the grade that I give them is higher than they have scored themselves.\n\nSince this project uses the word color in it numerous times, there is an additional set of each resource that contains the UK spelling of colour for each rubric, first draft, final draft templates, and the flower accent pieces.\n\nBelow is an example of the colorful butterfly grading rubric worksheet.\n\nBelow is an example of the story elements butterfly grading rubric worksheet.\n\nFirst Draft Worksheets:\n\nColorful Butterfly\n\nI believe that the writing process is important and that teachers should use process writing whenever possible. For this reason, my students never begin their book report projects by writing on their final draft templates, instead they write on first draft worksheets. Then, they edit and revise their work on their own, with a partner, or in individual writing conferences with me.\n\nThis Butterfly Book Report Project is divided into four writing sections:\n\nLeft Top Wing - Colorful Verbs: Students find examples of sentences that contain colorful verbs in them.\n\nRight Top Wing - Colorful Adjectives: Students find examples of sentences that contain colorful adjectives in them.\n\nLeft Bottom Wing - Colorful Character: Students write a description for the main character and try to use colorful adjectives and verbs in their writing.\n\nRight Bottom Wing - Colorful Plot: Students explain why the plot of this book is colorful (interesting) and why they recommend that other students read this book.\n\nButterfly Head and Body: Title of book, author, genre, student name, and date\n\nThis set contains five worksheets for students to write their first drafts on, the first four worksheets are shown below. On my first draft worksheets, I have designed the writing line spaces to match the spaces allotted on the final draft butterfly templates.\n\nThese first draft worksheets contain example sentences using colorful verbs and adjectives for the students to read before they try to find examples of these parts of speech in their own book. There are also examples from the book The Twits by Roald Dahl so that students can read examples from a particular book.\n\nBelow is an example of the first draft writing worksheets for this book report set. 4 of the 5 worksheets are shown below.\n\nFirst Draft Worksheets:\n\nStory Elements Butterfly\n\nThis butterfly book report set is divided into three writing sections and one section for an illustration:\n\nLeft Top Wing - Setting and Characters\n\nRight Top Wing - Solution and Conclusion\n\nLeft Bottom Wing - Plot\n\nRight Bottom Wing - Illustration\n\nButterfly Head and Body: Title of book, author, genre, student name, and date\n\nThis set contains two worksheets for students to write their first drafts. On my first draft worksheets, I have designed the writing line spaces to match the spaces allotted on the final draft butterfly templates.\n\nBelow is an example of the first draft writing worksheets for this butterfly book report project.\n\nBlack and White Butterfly Templates:\n\nThis butterfly book report project includes 5 templates that assemble into the shape of a butterfly.\n\nBelow are examples of the 5 colorful butterfly black and white templates.\n\nBelow are examples of the 5 story elements butterfly black and white templates.\n\nColor Butterfly Templates:\n\nWhen I am first introducing my students to a new book report project, I believe that it is important for them to have a visual example of what their final draft book report projects should look like. I always assemble the butterfly book report project myself beforehand and display it at the front of my classroom for my students to see.\n\nMy students enjoy seeing my butterfly book report first. They also enjoy hearing about the book that I chose to do my book report on, and this gives me a great chance to promote a book that I would like to encourage my students to read.\n\nTo save you time in coloring your example that you show your students, I have included color butterfly templates of this project for you to use.\n\nBelow are examples of the 5 colorful butterfly color templates.\n\nBelow are examples of the 5 story elements butterfly color templates.\n\nFree 5 Page Bulletin Board Display Banner:\n\nFinally, I know that it takes teachers a lot of time to assemble their classroom bulletin board displays. Many teachers spend their valuable time cutting out large display letters or making a banner on their own at home on their computer.\n\nThis time is valuable and better spent on developing your classroom curriculum and grading papers, so I have designed a matching 5 page display banner for your bulletin board.\n\nIf you have access to a laminating machine, you can laminate your banner so that it is durable and you can use it year after year for bulletin board display of these butterfly projects.\n\nThe words inside the flowers on this banner say \"Our Class Loves To Read!\"\n\nFree Bulletin Board Display Accent Pieces:\n\nEXTRA GOODIES: For some of my book report sets, I am able to think of, and create, additional accent pieces to help you in decorating your bulletin board displays.\n\nThis Butterfly Book Report Project includes a set of flowers that match the flowers in the display banner. This set includes stems and leaves that will help you to assemble these flower accent pieces.\n\nThese flowers say \"We Use Colorful Verbs and Adjectives In Our Writing.\"\n\nYou will be able to design a colorful and dynamic bulletin board display using your students' finished butterfly book report projects.\n\nThese butterfly graphic organizers are a unique and fun way to get your students excited about completing a writing assignment about the books that they have read.\n\nThe writing responses that are required of your students will have them searching for examples of descriptive verbs and adjectives in their books. Then, students use colorful verbs and adjectives in their own written responses. In addition, this butterfly book report set includes some flower bulletin board accent pieces to help you in decorating your bulletin board for this colorful theme.\n\nPurchase this book report project below:\n\nMatching Caterpillar Book Report Projects!\n\nWhile I was creating these two butterfly projects,\n\nI designed two matching caterpillar book reports.\n\nI wanted to create a colorful spring book report bulletin board display that contained both caterpillars and butterflies.\n\nThe writing spaces in the butterfly's body match the writing spaces in the caterpillar's body for both book report sets. The first draft worksheets and grading rubrics are exactly the same except for the graphics on them.\n\nI give my girl students the butterfly templates to write their book report projects on and my boy students the caterpillar templates.\n\nBy having my students write in two different book report templates, I can then create a dynamic bulletin board display full of both caterpillar and butterfly book report projects.\n\nThese caterpillar and butterfly book report projects can be used separately, I am just making a suggestion that worked well for me, and I liked the idea of having my girl students work on butterfly shaped templates and my boy students working on caterpillar templates.\n\nClick on the links below to view and/or purchase these matching caterpillar book report projects:\n\nGo To ==> Caterpillar Book Report Projects\n\n25+ Book Report Projects:"
