        "text": "Janeen Coyle’s A PUG WITH A PLAN is a delightful children’s book about a pug puppy and a boy named Dylan. When Dylan and his mother make a trip to the pet store, Dylan falls in love with a pug puppy and names him Frank. They take him home, and Frank is Dylan’s best friend until one day Frank goes to puppy heaven. Dylan parents are worried about getting another pet too soon.\n\nThe story behind A PUG WITH A PLAN is a true story. It helps adults to realize there is another pet out there for their family and gives children the chance to learn about life and death of a pet, and about finding another pet to love.\n\nI loved this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone, but especially families with children and pets.\n\n(I probably said this before, but besides reading novels, I love children’s books! I will occasionally post reviews of them on this site.)\n\nLYING TO MEET YOU by Anna Garner is a delightful story of Chloe Lane, a single nearly thirty fashion designer – boutique owner in New York and a reality show judge. Chloe’s best friends constantly devise plans for the three of them to catch a man, all of them ending in failure. While trying to figure out why no man is interested in any of them, given that they are all good-looking, they decide that an existing relationship is what they need to make them more attractive to potential suitors.\n\nWhile telling her lifelong friend Ethan Webster about her evening, Ethan suggests that he and Chloe pretend to be dating to test the theory. Chloe agrees to it, but initially feels guilty about lying to her friends and family. Will their plan succeed, or will it backfire?\n\nAnna Garner (aka Libby Mercer) has spun a tale that is full of laugh-out-loud humor, romance, friendships that have passed the test of time, family problems, and surprises. If you enjoy reading chicklit, you will love LYING TO MEET YOU. I highly recommend this book.\n\nLYING TO MEET YOU was given to me by the author in exchange for an honest review.\n\nI had a fabulous time at Books by the Banks in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 12, 2013 (sorry, I’m late with this post). I met some authors I have been following for quite some time and got my copies of their fabulous books signed. I also got to meet a few new authors. The fantastic indie bookstore Joseph Beth Books was there, so I bought some new books. Imagine that!\n\nMy husband came along and graciously took photos.\n\nI met my lovely Facebook friends Catherine McKenzie and Allie Larkin. Meeting them was so much fun, and guess what, they met each other in person for the first time that day and were sitting at the same table.\n\nCatherine’s books are fantastic! She has written ARRANGED, SPIN, and FORGOTTEN. Her new book HIDDEN is available now in Canada and will be available on April 1, 2014 in the U.S.\n\nAllie’s books are STAY and WHY CAN’T I BE YOU. Allie has an incredible sense of humor, and this same humor is found throughout her books. You will love them.\n\nLeah Stewart is the author of THE BODY OF A GIRL (which I have not read yet), THE MYTH OF YOU AND ME, HUSBAND AND WIFE, and her most recent, THE HISTORY OF US. I loved each of her books, but possibly my favorite is THE HISTORY OF US, because there were so many Cincinnati references, and having lived most of my life in Cincinnati, I could identify with the locales and, therefore, felt I was part of the story.\n\nI met Maria Semple and though I haven’t read her books yet, I have both THIS ONE IS MINE and WHERE’D YOU GO BERNADETTE in my to-be-read pile. I am positively looking forward to these two books.\n\nMindy McGinnis was a pleasure to talk with. Every photo of her I have seen shows a beautiful smile, and guess what? Mindy smiles a lot and has a very engaging personality. Though I haven’t read her debut novel NOT A DROP TO DRINK which came out on September 24th, my copy finally arrived. Hooray!\n\nI love children’s books, and I love pugs, so I naturally wanted to meet Janeen Coyle author of A PUG WITH A PLAN. I bought her book at Books by the Banks and couldn’t wait to go home and read it. There will be more about her book in a later post, but I can tell you I’m so glad I stopped by her table.\n\nSarah Curry Rathel introduced me to her debut novel THERE’S SOMETHNG DIFFERENT ABOUT MY HAIR. This book is the first in a series “to help all children realize, recognize, and respect their most important characteristic – their individuality.” (From Something Different Books webpage). I will be posting more about this delightful book in a later post.\n\nThere were several other authors I wanted to meet, but time ran short for me. It was truly an honor for me to have the opportunity to meet these remarkable ladies. Please check out the authors and their excellent books. You’ll be glad you did.\n\nI loved CHRISTMAS CAROL, a novella, by Michele Gorman. The protagonist in this modern version of the classic story is Carol. Carol has gone through three disastrous relationships and blames the guys for the breakups. While at her sister Marley’s wedding at a beautiful manor in Scotland, Carol is brought face-to-face with her three ex’s. After confronting each, she learns that it actually wasn’t because of their flaws that each relationship ended, but rather her perfectionist ways. Though Carol had always believed this personality trait would bring her happiness, but instead it drove those closest to her away. She even found she had a low tolerance for less than perfect family members causing her to be withdrawn from them. As Carol learns from her ex-boyfriends that she was the cause of their failed romances, she discovers that she can be happy, even if it sometimes hurts, by being more open and less exacting. She discovers that she is able to have a loving relationship with her guy and with her family members if she just lets go of being Miss Perfection.\n\nThis novella was a quick, fun read. There are ample funny moments throughout the story, and at times I found myself laughing out loud. I certainly would recommend this book not only for the story content, but also because it is a perfect length to read on a trip home during the holidays or to sneak into a busy schedule.\n\nI was provided this novella by the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
