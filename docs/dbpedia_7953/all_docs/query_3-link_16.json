        "text": "Jesus Puente Jr. – Texas\n\nNomination by Corrina Puente\n\nPhotography by Roxann Vaughan - Seniors By Vaughanadora\n\nIssue 78 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nNomination: Jesus Puente Jr. learned in second grade after retention, that dyslexia is a challenge but not an excuse to not excel academically. Both Dr and psychologist diagnosed ADHD and severe dyslexia. Jesus learned that academic success would be a matter of hard work and endurance. Working harder than his peers didn't stop him. Jesus used dyslexia as a stepping stool to excel at school while involved in Varsity tennis and football. Jesus hopes to inspire others to never give up or quit!\n\n​\n\n​Photography by Roxann Vaughn Photography\n\nWhat do you wish other people knew about dyslexia?\n\nI wish other people understood that dyslexic people do not have low intelligence or are not lazy. It is a learning disability, something that the human eye cannot see but if you pay attention you can recognize. As a dyslexic student I have faced a lot of learning difficulties. I must work a bit harder than others; my brain works different, I confuse my left and right, I misspell words and constantly must reread what I write. We struggle understanding instructions but if you are patient with us – we will give you 100% of ourselves!\n\nWhat is something good that has happened because of your dyslexia that may not have happened otherwise?\n\nSomething good that has happened because of my dyslexia that may not have happened otherwise is my attendance and academic goals that I have set for myself. Just because I have dyslexia does not mean I do not have to put in effort, as a student and athlete I had to learn to set priorities, seek tutoring to maintain my grades and ensure I attended school to maintain my academic goals I set for myself.\n\nTell us about your tennis career.\n\nAbout my tennis career, I started playing tennis in January 2023, my Junior year in High School. At first, I was hesitant about tennis because I played Pee Wee football as a child and proceeded to play football for my Junior High and High School years. I thought tennis was not for me and a boring sport. But thought of giving it a shot and now that I see how fun this sport is, the friendships made and the team bonding instilled by our Coach Branum, I wish I had joined sooner.\n\nWhat is a favorite memory with your tennis team?\n\nA favorite memory with my tennis team is when the tennis team and I went out for dinner after a tournament, and we ate at Jalisco Mexican Restaurant and the guys were joking with me and they said I would not smack my best friend Marcos Garcia with a tortilla that had butter all over it. As soon as Marco turned to look my direction, I took the tortilla and slapped him with it! These are unforgettable moments to me because I have never experienced team bonding in any other sport as I do in tennis.\n\nWhat is your next goal with tennis?\n\nWhat is my next goal with tennis? My next goal with tennis is to enter weekly UTR tournaments around Texas which will improve my ranking.\n\nWhat made you want to play football and what do you love most about the sport?\n\nI started playing football, I think I was 12 years old. I came home from school one day and told my parents I wanted to play football, a sport I had never played nor watched. My parents disagreed with me playing football, especially my mom. Since my dad signed me up, he asked if he could help the football coach, and later became the assistant coach of my football team. Let me tell you I was lost, did not know offense and defense was and thought I broke a couple bones whenever I got tackled. But my dad and my Coach Scott showed me how to lower my shoulder and hit back. Those were the Coaches and best memories I have of football!\n\nWhat position do you play and why does it suit you?\n\nThe position I played in PeeWee football and Junior High was running back. In High School I played positions I had no clue I could handle. I played outside linebacker, inside linebacker, nose guard, middle linebacker, corner, running back, fullback, lineman, and punter. The most challenging was playing the lineman position as a 150lb, 5 ft. 9 in tall guy. I faced some giants but never let that get to me. I always gave 100% no matter the size of the person in front of me- like dyslexia- I faced the giant!\n\nWhat is a favorite accomplishment with football?\n\nMy favorite accomplishment with football was not knowing what defense and offense was, confusing my left and right, to be given the opportunity to play almost every position in football. I had the honor to play Varsity Football for Carrizo Springs High School and for this I am thankful to the Coaches and staff for this opportunity.\n\nWhat do you have left to accomplish your senior year?\n\nWhat do I have left to accomplish my senior year, I set my personal goal the beginning of this school year. Although my GPA was good, I wanted to bring it up higher. I made it a point to maintain an A & B average throughout my senior year all while playing Varsity Football and Varsity Tennis. I think I can leave my High School Senior year feeling I gave it my all, I will leave knowing I gave my Elementary, Intermediate, Junior High and High School teachers and its staff my respect.\n\nWhat legacy do you hope to leave behind to younger classmen?\n\nThe legacy I hope to leave behind to younger classmen is even though you might go through hard times in school and extracurricular activities, always stay focused on positive and work on yourself to get “1% better every day” as Coach Abshire would say.\n\nWhat inspiring things about you does your nomination not cover?\n\nThe inspiring things about me that my nomination does not cover is that I am a member of First Baptist Church of Carrizo Springs and Youth Ministry. I would volunteer some of my summer days to an event called “HOTT DAYS”. This ministry helps churches needing work done, such as cutting grass or painting the buildings. I also volunteered for our Vacation Bible School. As a son, student, athlete I give all honor to God for allowing me to have the strength to keep my faith and seek Him in prayer. I also am part of an awesome modeling team for Roxann Vaughn/Seniors by Vaughanadora.\n\nThe inspiring thing about me, not on the nomination form is also who helped me along my journey. Being scared to go to school and scared that the teacher would call on me to read. But these people never gave up on me and were the push I needed.\n\nMy Dad & Mom have been and will be my number one support. My mom became my advocate and got help. That help was Ms. Rodriguez.\" Ms. Rodriguez was my dyslexia teacher that guided me and helped me with my reading and my teachers Mrs. Salazar and Mrs. Morones.\n\nWhat else would you like to talk about?\n\nThe other thing I would like to talk about briefly is what I had to do to overcome this fear and use this diagnosis as a stepping stool. One thing I remember is my mom telling me “Do not use dyslexia as an excuse to not try\". In school, went every day for 30 minutes to dyslexia class, and once home I had to continue with my reading, my chores, and sports. I played football and baseball as a child. But football was my comfort zone. Football was my form or my way of releasing the stress and fear.\n\nWhat do you feel passionate about or could talk about forever?\n\nWhat do I feel passionate about or could talk about forever? I could talk about sports forever, but I know that my education is something noone can take away from me. This has pushed me to make sure I keep my grades and better my GPA in school. Did I have to work hard, yes, sometimes a bit harder than my peers. Would I get discouraged? Yes, but as my parents always told me they did not raise quitters, so I had to try and try and not give up.\n\nHow did you find your photographer, RoxannLynn Vaughan?\n\nI remember my photographer when I was little because she was my youngest brother baseball coach. Once I had social media, I would see the great pictures that Roxann would take.\n\nWhat was your experience like?\n\nMy experience with Roxanne has been and is great. She is not just my photographer; she has become someone that helped me feel comfortable and confident.\n\nWhat did you love most about it?\n\nWhat I love most about my photographer, so many things. The way she makes me laugh while taking pictures, her personality, her jokes, the way she allows me to be myself and use my style, my choice of clothing.\n\nIf you had nothing to do and all day to do it, where would we find you?\n\nIf I had nothing to do and all day to do it, you would find me welding. This is one of my hobbies I like to do. I have been a welding student since my freshman year in High School. I will be graduating from SWTJC with a welding certificate in May 2024.\n\nWhat is up next for you that you are super excited about?\n\nWhat is up next for me that I am super excited about? Life! I will get to experience the workforce. A paying job! Put my budgeting skills to use. I plan on pursuing a trade at Southwest Texas Junior College Powerlineman/CDL while working parttime as a welder’s helper in the summer.\n\nLook for Jesus Puente Jr. in issue 78 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\n*Interviews are not edited after received from our inspiring teens - what you read is who they genuinely are!\n\nMia Bella Bartucci – Illinois\n\nNomination & Photography by Michael Sullivan Photography\n\nIssue 78 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nNomination: Mia Bella Bartucci is a 17 year old junior in high school.

Although I never had tried salsa or ballroom dance, I always wanted to try it. I always watch Dancing with the Stars and they are always amazing with their salsa and ballroom dances. Dancing with the Stars inspires me to try different dances that I never have tried before.\n\nWhat do you wish non dancers knew about dancing?\n\nI wish non-dancers understood that dancing is more than just flawless technique. It's all about letting go of your barriers, feeling the music, and expressing yourself. It's a kind of art where you use movement to communicate stories and connect with your emotions. Regardless of your age, body type, or ability level, everyone can dance.\n\nWhat has been your most adventure exploration of nature and why?\n\nThe most adventurous exploration of nature was when I went on a trip to Florida to the crystal river and swam with the manatees. It was the most amazing experience ever. I even swam next to a pregnant manatee and a baby it was very cool to see.

Pageants have allowed me to learn so many things such as interviewing and public speaking skills. They have helped me gain confidence and believe in myself.\n\nTell us about your volunteer opportunities. Which has been your favorite and why?

I think people find inspiration in seeing someone who is determined to make the most out of life and is always eager to try new things.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to tell us? I love summer! My favorite part is going to the lake and going jet skiing. We usually go for my birthday!\n\nLook for Myla in issue 78 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\n*Interviews are not edited after received from our inspiring teens - what you read is who they genuinely are!\n\n​\n\nPhotography by Samantha Curran\n\nJayda Warehime – Colorado\n\nNomination & Photography by Carol Dunnigan Photography\n\nIssue 78 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​Nomination: Jayda is truly an Inspiring Teen! She's a Freshmen and a new Rep for me, but I can already tell that she's special - she's caring and has a great sense of humor. She was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, accompanied by Chronic Uveitis, when she was only 18 months old. This is an autoimmune disease that has manifested as joint pain, stiffness and limited range of motion. In her lifetime she's already had 388 infusions, 537 chemo injections, 974 needle pokes, 464 Childrens visits, and 5 birthdays in Childrens Hospital! This girl plays basketball and is in Track!\n\nPhotography by Carol Dunnigan Photography\n\n​What inspiring things about you does your nomination not cover?\n\nAt the age of 5, I started an organization called Jayda's Elves. For 10 years I have collected coloring books, crayons, puzzles, art projects etc.- all to be delivered to Children's Hospital in the hopes it calms the patients while they are receiving medical care, and they don't have to think about the medicine running through their bodies.\n\nI have raised over $10,000 for the Arthritis Foundation to help fund research, community outreach, advocacy efforts and life improving programs.\n\nWhat else would you like to talk about?\n\nTo this day, I have to go to Children's Hospital every 4-6 weeks for infusions. I just entered my freshman year of high school and am a 3-sport athlete. I love sports and being active, but this can take a serious toll on my body not to mention my mental health trying to fit it all in. I am very lucky to have parents who support me in every way possible. I would not be the student, athlete, friend, patient, or human without their constant guidance. I live by \"I have arthritis, but arthritis does not have me.\"\n\nWhat do you feel passionate about or could talk about forever?\n\nI am very passionate about giving back. Through my experience with my disease, I have learned that everyone has a story. That story cannot always be seen. It is important to always be kind. Treat others with decency and respect. I enjoy volunteering for our local food bank-making boxes for senior citizens and bagging after school food bags for school age children. My love for the outdoors has taken me to trash pickups along Colorado's most beautiful trails. I believe we all can make a difference, one kind act at a time.\n\nHow did you find your photographer, Carol Dunnigan Photography? What was your experience like? What did you love most about it?\n\nWe followed each other on Instagram. I admired her work. With just my one session, she made it special, and I was able to see her creativity and fun personality. The photos were better than I could have imagined, and I was shocked to see myself in such a beautiful way. My favorite thing about my shoot was how we were able to be silly, have a great time and have such amazing results that I am so proud of. I am super excited for my future relationship with such an amazing woman.\n\nTell us about Rheumatoid Arthritis accompanied with Chronic Uveitis and how it affects you personally.\n\nThis arthritis occurs when the body’s immune system attacks its own cells and tissues. For me, this disease has caused persistent joint pain, stiffness and swelling in my lower extremities-hips, knees, and ankles. This is something I have lived with since I was 18 months old. There is no cure, the goal is to control the pain and inflammation, improving function, and preventing joint damage. Chronic uveitis is inflammation in the eyes. This can lead to blurry vision and blindness if not treated. This affects me personally by having difficulties performing everyday chores, experiencing high levels of stress. Mornings are the most difficult as that is when my body is the stiffest. It can be a challenge when my mind wants to do one thing and my body is saying “whoa, slow it down, Jayda.”\n\nWhat do you wish others knew about interacting with you or anyone else who has this?\n\nI wish others knew that just because this disease cannot be seen, does not mean it is not real. If I am unable to participate in an activity, it is not because I am lazy, grumpy or not engaged, I am physically hurting to the point I cannot join the event. I wish others knew how hard it is to be in pain every day. How much this disease dictates what I do and for how long I can do it.\n\nWhat impact has having this played on your skill levels and mental well being?\n\nThis has had a significant impact on my abilities and mental wellbeing. I am a 3-sport athlete, I sure give it my all every time I am on the court or field but I have limitations. My body does not move like an average teen, I have to make adjustments which affects my game. This also affects my mental wellbeing by not being able to do what I want to do, how I want to do it. I have learned my way is ok. Being able to participate is a win. I have learned that nothing is impossible, and I should never give up and always keep reaching. This is where true grit comes from.\n\nTell us about your basketball career.\n\nI started basketball in kindergarten. I have played every year for 10 years now. Basketball is by far my favorite sport; it is my favorite to play and watch. My love for the game shows on the court through my personality. As I have gotten older, the seasons have gotten longer, practices and games more intense, and expectations have increased. This can sometimes be a challenge, but I wake up and show up every day. I am proud of myself for pushing through and earning a varsity letter as a freshman.\n\nWhat position do you play and how does it suit you?\n\nMy position is a wing. The wing positions are shooting guard and small forward. This suits me as you should be able to make open jump shots with consistency while also being able to sprint around screens to open spots on the floor. You also should be able to create your own shots by driving the ball. You should have a good balance of size and strength, another reason this position suits me.\n\nAre you watching women's college basketball this year and especially the road to the final 4 and so on? If so, what are you taking away from this season and everything that has come forward for college players and women in the sport in general?\n\nI am absolutely watching this season and taking in so much. From passing techniques, defensive moves, and shooting. I am also closely watching the attitudes of the players on the court. How are they handling a bad call? A loss? How are they treating their teammates? This is just as important. Especially for the younger children watching. I do feel this is an exciting time for women’s basketball. Watching Caitlin Clark break record after record has been amazing to witness. For the first time, women’s basketball is selling out tickets, breaking viewing records and has fans from all over the country. I am so glad I get to watch all this happen.\n\nWhat do you participate in track, and which is your favorite and why?\n\nIn track, I am on the varsity throwing team. My favorite is shotput and discuss. This is perfect for me as it gives my lower extremities a much-needed break. These events are extremely fun for me, and I like challenging myself to see how much I can improve week after week. My goal is to make it to state as a freshman.\n\nWhat is one of your proudest track moments?\n\nMy proudest track moments are being able to break my own records. I am improving every week. That is exciting. High school sports can be a challenge when freshman compete against all upper classmen. When I can finish in the top 8 with over 80 participants, I could not be prouder.\n\nWhat is a favorite memory with your track team?\n\nThe season just started, and this is my first season on the high school team. So far, my favorite memory is the ability to be silly. Track is usually an 8-hour day, but it is a very relaxed chill setting. Always fun to hang out with the team and be our childish selves.\n\nWhat is the hardest thing you have ever accomplished, and how did you do it?\n\nThe hardest thing I have had to accomplish is realizing my disease is not a death sentence. Yes, I have limitations, but I am very much a highly functioning accomplished teen. No way possible for me to be where I am today without the support of family and friends. I have an amazing support system.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to be where you are today?\n\nAlways believe you got this. God knows what he is doing and never gives us more than we can handle. Mountains were made to be climbed.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years/what are your plans?\n\nIn 5 years, I should be a sophomore in college earning a degree in physical therapy. I would love to be able to help children with the same disease and limitations I face. My physical therapist helped me be the athlete I am today.\n\nWhat is your favorite activity or pastime that was not in your nomination?\n\nI love photography. Editing and thinking outside the box is my favorite.\n\nDo you have a hidden talent? What is it?\n\nI am a good drawer. I was hesitant to take an art class this year, but I am so glad I did. I was able to see how creative I can be.\n\n3 Things on your bucket list Visit:\n\nI love to travel so my bucket list is to visit places I have never been like Paris, New Zealand, and Ireland.\n\nWho do you find inspiring?\n\nI find my beautiful mom inspiring. Not only to me, but my friends, her coworkers, family, and family friends all call her Mama Rhonda. She is always available when someone needs an ear, advice or even a hug. My mom works extremely hard. Works to keep our home in order. Works to make sure all my medical, emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual needs are met. Volunteers 20-30 hours a month for different organizations. She also works her demanding 40-hour week job. She does all of this with a smile on her face and a dance in her step. She is such a positive person, she gets super involved in school and community events, and she doesn’t know a stranger. To watch her care for others, friends or strangers is truly inspiring. She makes a difference in other people’s world every single day. She is constantly encouraging me to reach for the stars and maximize my fullest potential. She is raising me to become a thriving successful young woman. I am proud and honored that she is my mom and I inspire to be just like her.\n\nWhat about you inspires others/why do you think you are inspiring?\n\nThis is a great question. I did not think I was inspiring. I am just trying to be me and do the right thing for others. It was brought to my attention by others why they feel I am inspiring to them. After hearing their versions, I do see it now. I always give 110% of everything I take on. I do not believe in giving up or using my disease as an excuse to not be my best. I get up, look up, and show up. I know God has my back. I believe everyone has a story and we should treat people with kindness. A simple hello, have a great day can make the difference for someone. I do well in school, have great relationships with staff and students, I have confidence, easy to talk to, and friendly. I also enjoy giving back every chance I get.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to tell us?\n\nI am very proud of the work I put in for my 1st year of high school and that I will leave my freshman year with 4 varsity letters and good grades. It has been a very successful year.\n\nLook for Jayda in issue 78 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\n*Interviews are not edited after received from our inspiring teens - what you read is who they genuinely are!\n\nLaney Lovell – Kentucky\n\nNomination & Photography by Shawn Stinson Photography LLC\n\nIssue 78 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​Nomination: Laney is a talented 16-year-old junior who relentlessly pursues her goals.

At Platinum Regional Dance Competition I was awarded with first place, a double platinum, artist of the year nomination, a scholarship towards our nationals competition, and discovery spotlight.\n\nWalk us through a typical day in the life of your dance studies.\n\nA typical day of dance training for me is arriving at the studio around 4PM after school and I am usually there until 8 or 9PM most nights.

I also have specific practices for each dance I am preparing in for competition season. It's a jam packed schedule, but I absolutely love it!\n\nTell us about what dance means to you.\n\nDance holds such a special place in my heart. It's not just about the steps and movements.

She's making a remarkable difference, proving stuttering is okay.\n\n​\n\n​Photography by Linsey Stuckey\n\nWhat do you wish people knew about stuttering?\n\nI wish people understood that stuttering doesn't define me; it's just a part of who I am. It takes patience and kindness to communicate with me, and I hope others can see beyond the hesitations and appreciate the person behind the words.\n\nHow has stuttering helped you with your strengths?\n\nStuttering has made me a kinder and a more resilient person. It has given me a greater perspective on the value of communication and has allowed me to learn a very valuable lesson of never taking anything for granted.\n\nHow did you get involved with the National Stuttering Association?\n\nI was doing some research about how to get further involved and share my story and that’s when I found the National Stuttering Association. At first, I started off small by simply attending one of their annual conferences. I had a really great time and met amazing people. The amazing experience I had at the National Stuttering Association contributed to my passion and desire to help individuals who stutter. The National Stuttering Association has completely changed my life, and that is something that I am forever grateful for.\n\nWhat do you love about leading the Teen Advisory Council's workshops and zoom meetings?\n\nI love leading monthly zoom meetings because it is a incredible way to connect with those who understand. It’s really cool getting to hear from a lot of people from so many different backgrounds.\n\nWhat has been your favorite workshop to run and why?\n\nMy favorite workshop has been the “Stuttering and Mental Health” workshop because it sheds light on something so important that is oftentimes overlooked.\n\nWhat do you do in your monthly zoom meetings?\n\nIn our sessions, we provide an open floor for girls to introduce themselves, share a fun fact or anything they'd like. Each meeting revolves around a different topic, creating dynamic discussions and fostering a sense of community. It's a safe space where every girl can be seen, heard, and connect with others who share similar experiences.\n\nHow would you describe your leadership style for these events?\n\nI think of myself as a inclusive leader, one who makes sure that everyone’s voice is heard and no one feels left out. I try my best to spread a positive message of hope and sisterhood.\n\nTell us about the Sisters Who Stutter Committee & your endeavors as President.\n\nAs President I make it my number one priority to make sure everything runs smoothly. I also strive to keep the sisterhood strong. We created Sisters Who Stutter to provide a platform for girls to come together to share similar experiences from all areas and walks of life. So far it’s been really incredible, and we have girls from over 10 countries attending!\n\nWhen did you start playing tennis and where are you at with it now?\n\nI did competitive gymnastics for a long time, but when I was in seventh grade, I broke my arm. I was out of practice and couldn’t compete for many months. When I went back to the gym, nothing felt the same. Everything was harder, the girls weren’t the same, and I lost my passion. Later that year, my friend invited me to her tennis camp. From there I completely fell in love with the sport. Through tennis I’ve made some of my best friends with shared camaraderie.\n\nWhat do you love most about the sport and how does it suit you?\n\nI think that tennis suits me well because not only is it a team sport, it is an individual sport. It gives me the power to excel, develop sportsmanship, and create bonds that last. I love tennis because it is a lifetime sport, and a skill that I can use forever.\n\nWhat is a favorite memory in this sport?\n\nMy favorite memory of playing tennis was when my team won the district championships. We had all worked so hard, and it was a really great moment where we all came together in unity.\n\nWhat is the hardest thing you have ever accomplished, and how did you do it?\n\nHaving a stutter has always been something that has given me a lot of shame and tested my courage. For the longest time is felt like I was carrying around a bag of bricks; I felt like no one understood me, and no one knew how hard it was for me to talk. Throughout the years, I’ve learned that whether I like it or not, my stutter is a lifelong character trait that I’ve accepted. If you would’ve told me three years ago that I would be on multiple national councils and inspiring others every day I would’ve not believed you. I was able to overcome my fear of stuttering by surrounding myself with people who lift me up.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to be where you are today?\n\nMy biggest advice for anyone struggling with something unique is to surround yourself with people who understand you and will be your biggest supporters. Even though it’s difficult at times, you are your best advocate. It is your responsibility to stand up for yourself and push for what is right.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years/what are your plans?\n\nI want to go to Brigham Young University and major in communication disorders and minor in early childhood development. My hope is to earn my MBA and to be a certified clinician at the American Institute for Stuttering. I want to be a speech therapist because speech therapy gave me a voice I never had, and that is something I will be forever thankful for.\n\nWhat is your favorite activity or pastime that was not in your nomination?\n\nI love going on evening runs and being able to disconnect to reconnect. When I am running, I am able to think and reflect on my day.\n\nDo you have a hidden talent? What is it?\n\nI'm a pretty good dog groomer.\n\n3 Things on your bucket list\n\nSkydiving, have kids, and start a YouTube channel.\n\nWho do you find inspiring?\n\nBoth of my grandmas inspire me every day. They have both been through obstacles that have made them stronger. They have been such an incredible role models to me in my life and have show me the true love of Christ.\n\nWhat about you inspires others/why do you think you are inspiring?\n\nI think my ability to overcome and make amends with the past is some thing that makes me stand out to others. I am able to use my unique perspective to influence people in my life. A lot of people ask me how I do everything that I do. It is very easy to take the compliment, but after thinking about that, I realized that serving others is what lifts me the most.\n\nLook for Hayley in issue 77 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nSofia Kelly – Ohio\n\nNomination by Whitney Hall\n\nPhotography by Still Dancing Photography by Kaitlynn Hunker\n\nIssue 77 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nNomination: I would like to nominate my daughter, Sofia Kelly. In my eyes she is an inspiration daily. Not only does she work hard in dance and practice 4-5 nights a week, but she strives in her academics as well and manages to keep straight A’s in all her classes. Her determination and pride in all that she does never goes unnoticed. She has the kindest heart and is always willing to help her family and friends. When someone is having a bad day, she doesn’t hesitate to support them and put a smile of their face. Her 3 younger siblings absolutely love her, watch everything she does, follow her around, and Sofia knows they look up to her so she makes sure to be the best example for them.\n\n​\n\nPhotography by Still Dancing Photography by Kaitlynn Hunker\n\n​Tell us about your dance career.\n\nI started dancing when I was 4 years old, during that time and for a few years I was at a different studio. My mom said I would always be dancing around at home and when she asked if I wanted to go to dance classes, I got so excited, and she signed me up. I started in recreational classes and did that for one season. After that season I knew I wanted to try out for the competitive team and have been competing ever since! Since then, I have switched studios to my current one, MPower Dance Company, where everyone welcomes me with open arms. I have grown so much as a dancer and went from competing in two dances to now six.\n\nWhat dances do you study? Which is your favorite and why?\n\nThe dances I study are lyrical, contemporary, hip hop, musical theatre, open, and ballet. My favorite dance is hip hop because I love the moves we learn and the sass that you put into it.\n\nWhat is the hardest thing about dance, vs the most rewarding?\n\nThe hardest thing about dance is having to remember the dances and being able to keep up with the moves. The most rewarding part is when we clean everyone up and complete our routines, then seeing all our hard work come together as a team and compete.\n\nWhat do you wish others knew about dancers/dancing?\n\nWhat I wish others knew about dancing is that competitive dancing is more than just turns and leaps. It comes with hard work, practice, and making sure you are doing the proper technique. You have to take time to stretch and learn the correct positions, that’s why ballet is the most important class out of all of them. At the end of the day what you learn in ballet ties into all the other genres of dance.\n\nWhat is your favorite class this year and what is the most interesting thing you’ve learned?\n\nMy favorite class this year in school is math, like dance it is challenging, and I like working hard until I figure out the answer. The most interesting thing I have learned this year in math is percentages.

She maintains lasting friendships with support and love, and is always there when you need her. Lainey actively engages in many organizations such as Lights Camera Fashion, the worship team at Warren Community Church, and National Honors Society. She utilizes her role in these organizations to spread God’s word, raise money for her community, further her academic excellence, and support peers. Without Lainey, the world would be less bright, as her inspirations ignite a passion in the people around her.\n\nPhotography by Melody Dawkins\n\n​Tell us about your Christianity and why it is important to you?\n\nMy faith stems from how different my life would be without God. Without him, I would constantly be anxious, angry, depressed, and find only happiness in materialistic things that will not last. With him, I have constant peace and reassurance in my future on earth and after death, allowing me to be joyful everyday. I would be a completely different person without God, but I am so thankful that that’s not the case here. Christianity is a religion where I find unconditional love and joy that lasts through any hardship. Following God means I do not have to miserable all of my life, but be joyous all throughout life.\n\nWhat do you love most about your church?\n\nThe community within Warren Community Church is unlike any other. The people are truly like family to me, and they welcome anyone who walks through our doors. My church has a heart for serving and it inspires me everyday to serve in different organizations around my community. I love that my church is less of a community, but more of a family where we are there for our brothers and sisters in Christ during good and bad times.\n\nWhat is your favorite class this year and what is the most interesting thing you’ve learned?\n\nMy favorite class this year would definitely have to be Performing Arts. The people in the class are my family and I love working alongside them everyday. Each and every one of them is a true inspiration, but my teacher, who builds our program with love and compassion, is definitely the heart of our family and the person who we inspire to be the most. One interesting thing I have learned this year is how lengthy the novel, “Frankenstein,” is.\n\nWhat social endeavor do you participate in the most and why?\n\nI go to the Bellevue’s youth group on Wednesday nights every week, so I can surround myself in God fearing people who inspire my love for the Lord.

Where do you fit in and where do you stand out?\n\nI come from a family of four, where the house is divided between masculinity and femininity. I like to say I am most like my mom, but look more like my dad. My mom, Christie, is one of the most hardworking and outgoing people I have ever seen. Her love for others and Christ shines through everything she does and she inspires me daily to be the bigger person in every situation. My dad, Dwayne, is the leader of our family and guides us to be a Christ centered. We share the same dry humor, which sometimes gets out of hand when we start bashing each other, but it is out of love. He never fails to protect and guide me and continuously shows me everyday that I am more than enough. I have one sibling, Andrew, who overtime has become one of my favorite people. Growing up we never got along, but now I do not know what I would do without his humor and listening ear. Everyone in my family has a role in making me the person I am today.\n\nWhat is a favorite family tradition you hope never ends?\n\nEvery Christmas, my aunt and cousins come down to my grandmother’s house where we have a crab boil. The is prepared and then we gather around a large table in my Grandmother’s dining room, where we have community with each other while eating AMAZING food.

We also enjoy driving around and screaming to the music during a cool evening. Recently, I have acquired a love for bible study dates with my friends, where we dive into God’s word and discuss our thoughts and feelings about it and how it relates with our young lives.\n\nWhat is a favorite memory with your friends you know you will never forget?\n\nOne evening, two of my friends and I went and bought places where we wrote out deep feelings on life and situations that we had experienced, then we drove to an abandoned bridge and smashed the plates on the ground. Being able to let go of past relationships and feelings with my closest friends was definitely something I will remember forever. It was a very therapeutic night that will definitely be used again in the future.\n\nWhat is Lights Camera Fashion and what do you do in it?\n\nLights, Camera, Fashion is a modeling event that raises money for St. Jude through 50 teenage models. The money goes towards families within St. Jude, so they never have to see a single hospital bill during their Childs treatment. The models are chosen and over the coarse of 6 months, they raise money for St. Jude using fundraises and donations. The models do a fashion show and photoshoot with My Best Friend Jenna dresses and get a custom dress made by the famous, Johnathan Kayne. The event is brought on by the bridal and prom dress company called, My Best Friend Jenna. The organization as a whole is a wonderful inspiration to young girls and shows them that they can make a difference in a multitude of lives, when they put themselves out in the world. It allows the girls to experience something bigger than themselves and they see the impact of their handwork right before their own eyes.\n\nWhat has been your favorite service project within the NHS?\n\nI have loved selling crushes every February in my school to raise money the Carl Perkins Center. The Carl Perkins Center’s mission is to provide support to families in preventing and dealing with child abuse in West Tennessee and to help both parents and children meet the practical needs of preserving and improving the quality of family life. This year we raised over 400 dollars.\n\nWhat leadership opportunities have you had within your endeavors?\n\nI lead a high school girls bible study every Wednesday, where I am able to lead friends and peers to the Lord and create a safe place for girls in my school to talk about their hardships, but also praises. I am Vice President of NHS, Secretary of Student Government, Secretary of Mu Alpha Theta, Secretary of Interact Club and through these clubs I am spread my message of the gospel within my school through my actions. I am also honored to be on the worship and praise team at my church, Warren Community Church, where I use my gifts for God’s glory to lead my church in worship and I am surrounded by people praising the Lord. I was also captain of my High School women’s soccer team.\n\nHow would describe your leadership style?\n\nI try to lead by example through my experiences within life, so others can relate to what I have been through in order for them to feel an impact. Unfortunately, sometimes we need to see a miracle in order to believe in more miracles. My goal is to be a christian role model to young people and people my age all around the world.\n\nWhat inspiring things about you does your nomination not cover?\n\nMy nomination does not cover the many organizations and activities that I am a part of in my community. Along with National Honors Society, I am also a part of Mu Alpha Theta, Student Government, Pep Club, Fayette Christian Athletes, Drama Club, Soccer and have performed as a lead role in plays such as Frozen Jr., The Addams Family, High School Musical, and more. I am so grateful that many look to me for advice, love, and God’s grace and that I have been provided the opportunity to build myself as a leader in my community\n\nWhat else would you like to talk about?\n\nI would love to discuss my aspirations for the future. I want to go to college at an SEC school and pursue a degree in international business so that I may travel around the world, utilizing my leadership and Christian missionary to change the lives of many around me.

I am so grateful to have grown up in a community that praises and worships him, and allows me to be a part of his worship alongside them. Everything I love - school, my friends, family, hobbies - is done through him. I have been a member of performing arts for four years, and between the plays I have starred in and my church worship group, God has always been the forefront.\n\nHow did you find your photographer, Melody Dawkins? What was your experience like? What did you love most about it?\n\nMy photographer is my future sister-in-law and has been a part of our family for over four years now. I am so grateful to have her as a part of my life and consider her one of my close friends. We have done photo shoots together since I was in eighth grade, and this one was extra special, as it was my senior shoot. I am so blessed that she was so excited to share this experience with me. We had such a great time filled with laughter and love. My favorite part was the collaboration and easy-going atmosphere.\n\nIf you had nothing to do and all day to do it, where would we find you?\n\nYou would find me at the Bible museum or in South Carolina at the pretty place chapel.\n\nWhat is up next for you that you are super excited about?\n\nI am attending Mississippi State University in the fall where I will get to dive deeper within my identity and see all different walks of life. I will also get to study international business, where I can focus on traveling and seeing different countries.

Emily is a straight A student; her lifelong goal is to be the best person she can be and spread as much love and positivity as possible. After high school, Emily will be majoring in business and, hopefully, being able to apply her degree in a non-profit organization that helps others.\n\nPhotography by Dave Volpone Photography\n\n​\n\n​What inspiring things about you does your nomination not cover?\n\nSomething that could be considered inspiring about me that my nomination didn’t cover is my passion for weightlifting. I have been consistently weightlifting for 3 years now and it is one of the most empowering and rewarding things I've ever done. Being a woman in the gym is extremely intimidating and I believe that fact is one of the reasons I am so passionate about it. Because I am passionate about the subject, I always do my best to teach other women about weightlifting and how beneficial it is for our bodies.\n\nWhat else would you like to talk about?\n\nA topic I’m particularly vocal about is mental health. Mental health is often overlooked and undermined when it’s a serious issue and needs to be discussed. Today we have certain resources that make it much easier to receive help, yet there’s still a strong presence of judgment. When individuals are struggling with their mental state, the worst thing for them to have to experience is judgment. Judgment can lead to the struggling individual becoming more withdrawn, making it much more difficult to assist them. As a society, we need to be more understanding and accepting of people struggling mentally.\n\nWhat do you feel passionate about or could talk about forever?\n\nI feel passionate about and could talk about the effects of social media on our minds forever. Although I believe that social media can be an incredible tool for many different things, there is no doubt that social media has a negative effect on people’s overall mental well-being. Social media puts unrealistic expectations into the minds of many individuals and causes a sense of insecurity. A way we could combat that is to be authentic and create a positive community online.\n\nHow did you find your photographer, Dave Volpone Photography? What was your experience like? What did you love most about it?\n\nI found my photographer, Dave Volpone Photography, through his previous clients and his page. I was told by many people that he is one of the best photographers in the area and I couldn’t agree with that statement more. I loved everything about our session, specifically how he communicated with me to ensure my satisfaction with my photos. He truly worked hard to capture not only my appearance but also my personality.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of being a Key Club member?\n\nMy favorite part of being a Key Club member is being a small part of a much larger organization that is dedicated to bettering the lives of others. My favorite event that I take part in is the American Red Cross blood drive because the American Red Cross is crucial in the process of healing others. I love that Key Club is so productive in making a change.\n\nWhat leadership roles have you had within this organization?\n\nAlthough I do not hold a title in the club, I am very active in recruiting other members and encouraging others to participate in our events. We often have bake sales and I enjoy running those as well as providing goods to sell.\n\nWhat is your strongest leadership quality?\n\nMy strongest leadership quality is dedication. Dedication is my strongest leadership quality because I have a strong desire to be successful, especially when it comes to projects. I enjoy focusing on a specific goal and doing everything in my power to achieve it. I hope that my dedication is inspirational to others.\n\nWhat do you like to do with the elderly?\n\nMy favorite thing to do with the elderly is have fun, I do this through games and having engaging conversations. My job title is “housekeeper” but my description is being a homemaker by ensuring the comfort, safety, and happiness of my residents. There truly is nothing in this world that is more enjoyable than spending time with my residents and knowing that I make a positive difference in their lives. I am particularly fond of playing bingo with them because I get to see the excitement on their faces.\n\nWhat have you learned about yourself working with them?\n\nI have learned some of the most valuable lessons in life through working with my residents, but my favorite thing I've learned is that God is calling me to make helping others a huge part of my life. I’ve always enjoyed helping others but the true eye-opener for me is how appreciative my residents are of me. I feel most fulfilled when I help others and I am beyond grateful that my residents have helped me realize that.\n\nWhat is your favorite class at school this year and what is the most interesting thing you’ve learned?\n\nMy favorite class at school this year is Contemporary World Issues because I believe that it is important to learn about issues within the world. I believe that it’s important to learn about worldly issues because not only can we help other countries, but we can also better our own country by learning from others. Something interesting that we’ve learned about is the child slave labor issues in 3rd world countries because many popular brands in America use goods created unethically by children. Realizing how many American brands use child sweatshops was shocking and motivated me to boycott many brands.\n\nHow would you like your non-profit to help others?\n\nI would like my non-profit organization to help feed the hungry. I would want my non-profit to be based on feeding the hungry because not only is food vital for survival, it is also important for your morale. Through food I would like to heal others physically and mentally.\n\nWhere is your favorite place you’ve traveled and why?\n\nMy favorite place that I’ve traveled to is Scotland because I learned many things and enjoyed meeting new people. I toured many castles and shopped in local stores to learn more about the country and it’s people. I felt very welcomed and made memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nIf you could travel anywhere, where would it be and why?\n\nIf I could travel anywhere in the world, I would travel to Italy because I love the culture and want to experience it first hand. I also would love to bring my mother with me because she has always dreamt of traveling to Italy and I want to fulfill that dream for her. My mother is one of my biggest inspirations in life and I cannot thank her enough for encouraging me to experience the world.\n\nIf you had nothing to do and all day to do it, where would we find you?\n\nIf I had nothing to do all day, you would find me at work because I love my job. I love my job because of my residents and how much joy they bring me. My favorite way to spend my time is with them hearing all of their stories and advice.\n\nWhat is up next for you that you are super excited about?\n\nMy next step in life is becoming a certified personal trainer. I am super excited about this because I can’t wait to teach others about weightlifting and helping people improve their lives through fitness. This has been a dream of mine for years now and it is surreal to making this dream a reality.\n\nLook for Emily in issue 77 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nPhotography by Emily Shaw"
