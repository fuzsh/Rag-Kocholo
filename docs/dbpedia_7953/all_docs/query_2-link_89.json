        "text": "It’s early May in a blooming Willamette Valley and something special is happening among the wildflowers: a Fender’s blue butterfly is emerging from its chrysalis. Beneath a towering purple flower called Kincaid’s lupine, the quarter-sized butterfly flaps its dusty blue wings for the very first time.\n\nWith only eight weeks to live, she sets to work right away feeding on nectar from various wildflowers to pollinate her prairie home. Her world is small—she will never venture more than a mile from where she was born. Before she dies, she will lay her eggs on the underside of a Kincaid’s lupine leaf, the same type of flower she was born and fed upon as a tiny larvae. Only this particular lupine will do—the Fender’s blue butterfly is extremely particular when it comes to making a home for the next generation.\n\nThe Fender's Blue Butterfly Needs Healthy Prairie in Oregon's Willamette Valley\n\nThis is a love story that is both beautiful and tragic. Due to her specialist tendencies—she only lives in the Willamette Valley and reproduces on only one kind of flower—the fate of the Fender’s blue butterfly is inextricably entwined with that of her beloved lupine. But there’s a problem. The Kincaid’s lupine is particular, too. This flower will only grow in suitable upland prairie habitat. So much of the prairie—and the Kincaid’s lupine—has disappeared in the valley due to a variety of causes from urbanization, agriculture and non-native plant invasions to the suppression of wildfire—that the Fender’s blue butterfly teeters on the edge of extinction. With only one percent of the prairie remaining, conservation is crucial to the survival of both plant and pollinator.\n\nShe emerged in the area of the preserve they call the “hay field,” a 100-acre section that had been converted from prairie to pasture years ago for grazing sheep and cows. Trees and non-native plants such as Himalayan blackberry had also encroached, overpowering the prairie grass and flowers. With the help of partners, TNC staff reintroduced the natural role of fire to the landscape here in the form of controlled burns. This necessary disturbance keeps the native prairie plants healthy and the threats at bay. Thanks to careful burning and mowing, manual removal of non-native species, years of planting and your support, today the hay field is once again a glorious example of upland prairie habitat. It’s positively bursting with wildflowers, not the least of which are Kincaid’s lupine.\n\n“It’s really a story of if you plant it, they will come,” says TNC Project Manager Jason Nuckols. “The prairie is healthy, the lupine is growing and the Willow Creek population of butterflies is doing really well.”"
