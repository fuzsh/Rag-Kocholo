        "text": "Set in Greece and Norfolk, this two book collection follows Sophie as she navigates love, family and friendship in The Butterfly Storm and The Birdsong Promise.\n\nThe Butterfly Storm (Book 1): Sophie Keech has it all. A new life in Greece with a handsome man enables Sophie to leave her mundane job and her estranged mum. But four years on, a domineering mother-in-law to be and the reality of living in Greece not being what Sophie imagined, strains her relationship with Alekos.\n\nWhen her mum is involved in an accident, Sophie jumps at the chance to escape. Time to reassess her life and make amends is sorely needed. Yet an attraction to a good looking and newly divorced man, and a shock discovery, complicates things.\n\nCan Sophie and Alekos' love survive the distance?\n\nThe Birdsong Promise (Book 2): Sophie's life is perfect. Three years after moving to Cephalonia with her baby daughter, she's in love with a handsome man and her creative business is thriving. But returning to the UK for her mum's hen party introduces unwanted feelings, memories and people.\n\nWhen Sophie hosts the wedding in Cephalonia, her villa is filled with family and friends. Yet Sophie's contentment is short-lived, as her life is turned upside down again by a glamorous singer, and some shocking news.\n\nWhen the past threatens to destroy happiness, will love be enough?"
