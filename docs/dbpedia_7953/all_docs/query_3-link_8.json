        "text": "Brianna Guerra - Texas\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nPhotography by Vintage Couture Photography\n\nNomination by Marisa Rosales\n\n​Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nThe Nomination: Brianna Guerra is inspiring because she never stops moving. She does great academically and she still has time to be a part of Student Council, National Honor Society, Peer Assistance Leadership, help in the community and be an amazing cheerleader. She is caring and she is always willing to help anyone at any time. ​\n\n​How long have you been a cheerleader? How did your career begin? What is your favorite part about the sport?\n\nI have been a cheerleader for six years now and it all began accidentally. I went to a gym to enroll in gymnastics and throughout that season I would see these beautiful cheerleaders learning impressive things and I wanted to be just like them. The following season I tried out and made a level 3 team! My absolute favorite part about competitive cheerleading is the adrenaline you get when you’re standing in front of a huge crowd about to show them and the judges what you’ve been practicing for countless of hours.\n\nDid your cheerleading team compete at Nationals this year? If so, how did your team do? What was the experience like? Tell me about it!\n\nYes, my team competed at Nationals in February. Prior to, we had been working extremely hard and spending so many hours in the gym to prepare for this prestigious competition. Teams from all over the country come to Dallas, Texas to compete in this competition and It’s every cheerleader’s dream to win NCA. The nerves were high, and the adrenaline was rushing. Our coaches gave us a chilling speech right before we went on stage and our performance was incredible! We hit a zero-deduction routine both days of the competition and took home the national title!\n\nWhat is your favorite part about helping your community? When did you start helping?\n\nI started helping in my community ever since I was eight years old. My favorite part about helping in my community is meeting so many different people. People from different countries and cultures. I love the experience I gain from helping others, but nothing beats the feeling of seeing their faces light up with joy when you’re able to help them in some way.\n\n​\n\nTell us about the Peer Assistance and Leadership organization you’re a part of. How long have you been involved? What are your duties within it?\n\nThe Peer Assistance and Leadership Program focuses on enabling young people to use their potential to make a difference in their lives, school and communities. This is my first year in PALs because only seniors can be in the program at my school. Our duties as PALs include visiting different elementary schools in our district and mentoring our palees. Throughout the school year, we discuss a variety of key youth issues with our palees such as bullying, teamwork, responsibility and behavior problems. Our overall job as a PAL is to be a positive influence on the youth.\n\n​What about you inspires others/why do you think you are inspiring?\n\nI don’t see myself as inspiring, but people always seem to take my advice or want to do what I do. I don’t think I’m doing anything special, but I only stand up for what I think is right.\n\nBrianna will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nPhoebe Coleman - Maryland\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination and Photography by Shooting Future Stars\n\nFeatured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nThe Nomination: Phoebe is 13 years old, an actress, plays the drums and dances. She is also an honor student who reads to kids in her spare time.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite quotes and why?\n\nCicely Tyson quote:\n\n• “I want to believe that there is a mountain so high that I will spend my entire life striving to reach the top of it.”\n\nI feel that you are always learning your craft. When you stop learning, you give up.\n\nDenzel Washington quotes:\n\n• “You pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too. That’s part of it.”\n\nI feel that you have to go through something to get something.\n\n• “Do what you have to do, to do what you want to do.”\n\nI feel that you have to put your best in life to be the best – this goes for acting too.\n\nWhat is your favorite part about playing the drums?\n\nBefore I took drum lessons, I would often hit my thighs, the table in front of me or anything else that I could hit or bang on. My favorite part of playing the drums is accenting or making a stronger sound after maintaining a certain beat or tempo.\n\nWhen you dance, what are some thoughts that go through your head?\n\nWhen I dance, I feel free. I feel as though there is no care in the world. I feel like I can fly like an eagle in the wind. I have a destination in mind or I am focused on being free. I am thinking freedom from all cares when I dance.\n\nTell me about your experience of reading to kids in your spare time.\n\nI love reading to kids in my spare time. I know that I am giving back to the community. I have read at malls, community centers, day care centers and plan to continue doing this. The kids interact with me through my questions to them and their questions to me. They are engaged with the conversation and they are motivated about what I say to them.\n\nWhat’s next for you?\n\nIn the future, my plans include acting in movies and television shows that have action, motivation, and comedy in them. I also want to motivate the financially disadvantaged and physically challenged youth.\n\n​Phoebe was featured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nKathryn Oelker - Indiana\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination and Photography by Jennifer Dunn Photography\n\nFeatured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination: Katie plays softball and runs tech for theater. She loves her puppies! She is also an amazing makeup artist! Katie's best quality is how good of a friend she is. She is there through thick and thin no questions asked. I love that about Katie!\n\n​The first thing I want to be recognized for is a hard topic for me. It's an insecurity of mine that I have been working on overcoming throughout my life. I have dyslexia. I have dyslexia, and I'm successful in my school work. I might not be first in my class, but that is okay. I have graduated from my Individual Education Plan (IEP). I take and have taken college level class. I have a good GPA. I have dyslexia and I have played varsity softball all four years. The first thing I want to be recognized is that I have dyslexia and I'm a successful student. I want to be recognized for this so that other students with learning disabilities know that they can be too.\n\nI have been playing softball since I was four years old. I probably became interested in softball at that age so that I would have something to do, instead of driving my parents crazy. The thing that kept me interested in softball all these years is how you can put your whole self into the game, no matter what you are feeling. Softball makes you step away from your problems. If you are upset, it lets you focus on something good. You can let out frustration or anger of any kind. Or it is just fun to play with, or against, your friends.\n\nMy favorite kind of puppies are the ones that are goofy and light-hearted. I have had two goldendoodle puppies in my life. They are one of the silliest and kindest dogs. They might get pretty big, but everything they do is out of curiosity or playfulness.\n\nMy favorite type of makeup is special effects makeup. Special effects makeup (fx makeup) is the makeup style they use in horror movies. Fx makeup is what makes the actors look hurt or creepy. I love Fx makeup because it is another way to express myself and you get to build something scary from scratch. I want to learn more about glam makeup. I can do traditional makeup, but I would like to learn how to do colorful and dramatic makeup.\n\nMy plan for the future is to go to Ball State University to receive a Bachelor of science in dietetics. I hope to work with athletes or with families that need help to become healthier.\n\nKathryn was featured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\n​Shelby Maiorano – New York\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\n​Nomination and Photography by Luke Photography\n\nIssue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination: I met Shelby as a HS junior during a consultation for a portrait session. She is a very sweet girl who is profoundly upbeat and happy. She's had numerous concussions from lacrosse and a car accident and had to give up playing lacrosse as a result. She's also had numerous heart surgeries, all before I met her. She's had a couple of surgeries since, but she continues to be the happiest and most upbeat teenager I've ever met.\n\nHow did you recover from your concussions in lacrosse and the car accident?\n\nI recovered from my concussion in lacrosse and the car accident by going to months of occupational therapy, physical therapy, the concussion clinic and a lot of rest. I was unable to play sports, participate in any physical activity and even do everyday activities because I needed to rest for a long period of time. I was basically on bed rest.\n\nCan you walk me through your day of the car accident and thoughts that went through your mind?\n\nThe day of the car accident my mother and I were on the way to the concussion clinic and my neurologist at Strong Memorial Hospital. We were rear-ended by a car going approximately 55mph while our car was at a complete stop due to traffic. The thoughts going through my head at this point was the fact that I was already in really bad conditions physically because of the severe concussion I was dealing with and I was worried about the effects that the impact of this accident would have on me because I hit my head really hard when we got in the accident.\n\nWhat type of heart surgeries have you had and what was the recovery process like?\n\nI have had two cardiac ablations and a loop recorder heart monitor implanted and taken out. After the cardiac ablations, I was hospitalized for a few days following the surgery and recovery took a couple of weeks due to severe discomfort I dealt with. After the loop recorder monitor procedure, I was sent home that day and the recovery was approximately 5-6 days.\n\nImage by Kathleen Frauel\n\nAre you still involved with sports? If so, which ones?\n\nUnfortunately, I am no longer involved with sports. After having eight diagnosed concussions, I was told by my neurologist that I no longer can participate in any sport. She presented me with the risks of the concussions I have already had, and the even worse risks if I was to get another concussion. These risks were life threating and could cause me severe brain damage, which I am blessed to have not gotten after my numerous concussions.\n\nWhat do you fill your time with? Favorite hobbies? Past times?\n\nIn my free time, I do anything I can to stay active. One of my favorite ways of doing this is adventuring outside at the beach or at local parks and traveling to different states and countries. Traveling is by far my favorite thing to do. I love being exposed to new cultures, environments, and meeting new people.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to be where you are today?\n\nThe advice I would give is to never take anything in life for granted. No matter what adversity you have to face and struggles you need to overcome, keep a smile on your face throughout the whole process and always stay strong. Your strength will inspire those around you and will inspire people struggling that no matter what, everything will be okay in the end. Other advice I would give is to always put your health before anything else. Your health is essential and should always be a priority. After any injury, it is important to get checked out by a medical professional so they can deliver the car necessary.\n\nImage by Nick Serrata\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years/what are your plans for the future?\n\nIn five years, I see myself working on a pediatric unit as a Registered Nurse. Currently, I am in college majoring in Nursing. To me, helping someone is by far the most rewarding feeling, and that is what I wanted my career to abide. Going into the field of Nursing is not a conscious choice cultivated by a college adviser or a team of phycologists; it is who I am- it is my past, present, and future. My natural inclination and personal experiences in the medical field have led me to the field of nursing. I look forward to having a voice in the medical industry and being able to help people through any adversity they may have to face and being there every step of the way throughout their healing process. This will provide me with immeasurable gratification.\n\nAnything else you’d like to tell us?\n\nOn top of my heart condition and concussions, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder called Reflex Neurovascular Dystrophy when I was thirteen. RND is a rare autoimmune disorder. It is a painful condition that leads to severe pain in the joints and muscles. It is caused by a nerve sensitivity whereby the nerves in the body send pain signals to the brain inappropriately. When dealing with this on top of my concussion and heart issues, medical professionals were extremely concerned on the impact the RND would have and the impacts it would have on my recovery processes.\n\nShelby will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nZoe Cerrillo - California\n\nInterviewed by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination and Photography by Launa Penza Photography\n\nIssue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nThe Nomination: Zoe Cerrillo is a consummate professional even at 17, pursuing a major in the medical field. She is responsible, punctual, focused, yet she is quirky, funny and playful. An accomplished guitar player, inspired by her dad. She has an amazing collection of all the guitars she's played since she was 5 years old. She is also involved in student council, instrumental conservatory and an outside volunteer group.\n\n​\n\n​Tell me about playing the guitar. What are some of your favorite songs to play on it?\n\nMusic is one of my greatest passions and I would not be able to imagine my life without this source of art. During the early stages of my musical journey, I played a lot of radio pop songs; but as I developed as a musician, I was able to define my own sound and style. I draw a lot of inspiration from artists like Lianne La Havas and Daniel Caesar and my favorite songs to play from them are “Ghost” and “Best Part”.\n\nWho taught you how to play the guitar? Why did you start playing?\n\nI started playing the guitar and singing almost 11 years ago when I was seven and was taught by my amazing family friend and musical artist Deborah Davis. But the reason that I started playing the guitar was because my dad also played guitar and watching him was always so inspiring to me.\n\n​How many guitars do you own? Do you have a preferred guitar to play on? How long did it take you to learn how to play?\n\nCurrently, I own seven guitars; three electric, two electric-acoustics, and two acoustics, but I would be lying if I said I still play them all! My favorite guitar to play is my newest addition that I received this past Christmas from my parents, which is a limited edition Made in Japan Traditional Series ‘50s Fender Stratocaster. I am a quick learner and it was easy for me to pick up notes, chords, and strumming patterns, but I still have so much more to learn beyond what I already know.\n\nWhat are you currently doing to be a consummate professional for your future plans in the medical field?\n\nIn order to reach my goal of attending college and graduating with a Bachelors in Nursing degree, I concentrated on taking extra science related courses throughout high school such as Honors Physics and Kinesiology, which really helped me to get a head start on anatomy.\n\nWhat volunteer opportunities have you had? Where are some of your favorite places to volunteer at and why?\n\nI have been an Assisteens of the Assistance League of Glendale for six years and being a member sparked my passion to help others and become a caregiver. My favorite place to volunteer, however, is at the local hospital, Verdugo Hills Hospital. Here I have met some of the most dedicated volunteers and it is absolutely thrilling to be in a chaotic medical environment where I thrive.\n\nZoe will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\n​Rosie Gadus - Texas\n\nInterviewed by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNominated by Seeley Casey - Two Girls and A Lens\n\nIssue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination:Rosie Gadus is the light that everyone is attracted to. She strongly encourages and guides others to become strong in their faith. She is very active in her church and enjoys volunteering in the church and the community. She is outgoing, adventurous, spontaneous, funny and a beautiful soul.\n\nWhat are you involved in at your church?\n\nOnce a week I am a bible study leader for a group of junior high ladies. I help them grow their relationship with God, and let them know they have someone to confide in when they are having issues. I also attend my own senior bible study, which allows me to continue growing and developing my authentic relationship with God. I also attend weekly church services in the high school ministry at my church.\n\nWhat is your favorite about being a part of your church?\n\nMy favorite things about being a part of my church is being accepted for who I am and the opportunities I have available in volunteering, such as growing relationships and potentially having an impact on someone's life.\n\nTell me about some of your volunteering opportunities within your church and community.\n\nMy volunteering started at a young age when my family and I helped the community around us after Hurricane Ike in 2008. Afterwards, every year on Thanksgiving my family and I gather with a large group and go out into our community and provide Thanksgiving dinners to people that might not have the chance to have one. At church, in addition to my junior high group leadership role, I also volunteer at church services on the weekends to help out with the pre-k students. Over the summer I volunteer at a local church VBS (vacation bible school) church camp. I also help organize and participate in local fundraisers.\n\nWith friends Carrington Nixon (blonde) and Zeynep Kardes (brunette)\n\n​\n\nWhy would consider yourself adventurous and spontaneous?\n\nI would consider myself adventurous and spontaneous because I’m open to anything at anytime. I love trying new things such as zip lining, hiking, and traveling.\n\nWhen you’re not in church, what do you do in your free time?\n\nWhen I’m not attending or volunteering at church, I spend my time doing what I love with people I love. Some things I like to do is hanging out with my friends whether we are shopping, hanging out, or seeing a movie. I also love spending time outdoors doing fishing, hunting, and taking my dog to the local dog parks.\n\nImage by a friend of her with her dog, Chance\n\n​Pizza or tacos? Soda or water? Cats or dogs?\n\nPizza, Water, and Dogs\n\n3 things on my bucket list.\n\nI would love to go on a mission trip, go skydiving, and to see the Northern Lights.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years/ what are your plans for the future?\n\nIn 5 years, I see myself still in college working towards my doctorate degree and becoming a pediatric physical therapist. Being a pediatric physical therapist will allow me to impact, encourage, and help kids accomplish their goal and recover.\n\nRosie will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nJames McCann III - Maryland\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nPhotography and Nomination by Shooting Future Stars\n\nFeatured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nThe Nomination: James McCann III is a junior in High School who launched his business at the age of 14. His first client was his mom. From there he then began cutting friends and family hair in 2017. He became so popular and in demand that he launched Wavycuts.est17. James is a full-time student and cuts hair during every free moment he can, from Fridays after school until Sunday evening. Fades are his specialty. He also trims beards and arches eyebrows. James is such an inspiring young man and takes great pride in his work and business. He's inspiring boys, teens and adults.\n\nTell me about how your business got started.\n\nMy business got started with many inspiring factors. My brother is a proud owner of his own barbershop. I also found a youtuber called 360 Jezzy, which turned into a wave and barber channel. This inspired me to get some clippers as soon as I could. My own barber gave me my first pair of fading clippers. When I got home, I begged my mom to let me cut her hair since she already had a low cut hairstyle and she agreed. My mom was my first customer.\n\nWhat is “Wavycuts.est17.”?\n\nWavycuts.est17 is a combination of me. I have waves and I started cutting in 2017, thus est. (established).\n\nHow are you inspiring to others?\n\nI keep improving and don’t give up. The first time I cut, it was not what I wanted the finished product to look like at all. Despite this, I continued to cut and got better and better. I continued to watch videos and tutorials to improve. I even cut hair when I broke my leg. My grandmother bought me a device that would allow me to rest my leg and cut hair at the same time. I am passionate about cutting hair and believe God has given me a gift so I don’t want to waste it.\n\nWhat are some trimming/cutting techniques you think everyone should know?\n\nThere are 3 tips that I learned and believe barbers should use each day.\n\n#1 Always take your time so the work is your best work and a reflection of the client and barber. #2 Never get discouraged with a haircut. Make sure each haircut you have a strong mindset knowing you will get better because of the repetition.\n\nAnd, #3 Always use your mirror. The mirror does not lie, so if your lineup is not straight or fade not blended it will show.\n\nWhat are your goals for the business moving forward?\n\nI have two major plans. The first plan is to travel around the world to different barber events and expos. And my second plan is to own at least 5 barber shops by the age of 30 in the D.C, Maryland, and Virginia areas.\n\nImage by Nicole Hunsburger\n\nBrooklynn Hudgins - Pennsylvania\n\nInterview by Larissa Chelius\n\nPhotography by Abbe Kiwak, USYS Soccer Photography & Nicole Hunsburger\n\nInspiring Teens Magazine Issue 19\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination: Brooklynn goes to Pennridge High School and plays for the high school soccer team.

She is playing for the first ever @phillyonestar women's team and plays in the @wpsi.\n\nImage by USYS Soccer Photography\n\nHow did you become interested in soccer and how did you start?\n\nI have played soccer since I was 3 years old and ever since then I have had a passion for soccer.\n\nWhat kind of community comes with being a part of Eastern Pennsylvania’s Olympic Development Program?\n\nEPYSA and ODP has provided me with the opportunity to play with an amazing group of girls who also feel passionately about the game. When we are on and off the field, there is a sense of family. We love to compete and represent East PA, but we also have a strong friendship and bonds that will last when we end our ODP run this year.\n\nTell me a little bit about the Continental Football Club.\n\nContinental Football Club (CFC) is a travel soccer team that I have joined this year. I love all the coaches there and my team (U-17 NPL) make soccer even more fun. They are a highly competitive club and we travel often for our games.\n\nWhat position do you play on your teams?\n\nI am a full-time goalkeeper. Ever since I was 10 years old, I decided that I wanted to play goalkeeper because it was the right fit for me and the position I enjoyed most playing.\n\nWhat opportunities will you receive for being a member of the Brand New Philadelphia Lonestar team?\n\nGetting to play with the Philadelphia Lonestar team will allow me to see a whole new perspective to soccer. The level of talent this team has is something I am so excited to be a part of. Playing for this team will allow me to develop friendships with people from around the east region and help me improve how I play my game.\n\nWhat kind of commitment do you have from each of these teams? Do you have a lot of free time?\n\nAll teams require the best commitment you can give. Because of this, all these teams have become my life because of the traveling my teams go to. For example, I went to California for my ODP team for a tournament and then the next weekend I went to Boston for my Continental team. With all the traveling for these teams every weekend and the practices during the weekdays, I have very little free time. But, I enjoy this schedule because I love playing soccer and I get to do it with girls that I am really close with.\n\nImage by Abbe Kiwak\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to be where you are today?\n\nWork for your goals- without hard work, it is difficult to achieve your goals and aspirations. But with hard work, it seems as if anything is possible.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years?\n\nIn five years, I hope to be going to college and playing college soccer while studying medicine.\n\nWhat about you inspires others/why do you think you are inspiring?\n\nI work towards my goals. Hard work beats talent which is what I try to remember with everything I do whether it be academic or sports related.\n\nHow do you keep yourself organized with everything you have on your plate?\n\nWe have this huge calendar with everything going on in my family’s schedule. Since I have a family of 5, it’s hard to keep up with everything. My mom always is organized and on top of everything with all of our schedules, so I give her a lot of credit for helping to keep me organized.\n\nWhat is your favorite activity or pastime that wasn't in your nomination?\n\nRecently, I was selected to go on the game show “The Classh-room” where three students go against three teachers and test their knowledge. It was such a fun experience and I would do it again in a heartbeat.\n\nBrooklynn will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\n​Jacolby Moore - Houston, TX\n\nInterview by Michelle Sicard\n\nNomination and Photography by Pink Lilly Photography\n\nIssue 19 Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination: Jacolby is a young man focused on dreams and goals.

School in the 5th grade, my cousin Brandon hit a 2 pointer in 3 seconds before the end of the game which tied up the game and I came back to make the final shot!

When I turned 15 years of age, I became a Lifeguard for Greater Houston Pool Management. I worked for GHPM for 3 years. I was employed with Safe Splash as a Lifeguard part time for 2 years. I am currently employed with Houston Swim Club. I have off campus duty every day, so I am able to work afterschool and on Saturdays. During my time as a Lifeguard I have saved 2 lives and truly love my job and would not trade it for anything!\n\nJacolby will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nPresley Connell – South Carolina\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination by Misty Connell\n\nImages by Lindsey Mills of Sullivan Blue & Misty Connell\n\nIssue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination: Presley is a Freshman at Carolina Forest High School in Myrtle Beach, SC.

Santalo\n\nPhotography by Cesar Santalo\n\nIssue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine - Volunteer/Entrepreneur\n\n​\n\nAngela Santalo is a talented and excellent scholar, but she is especially committed to giving back to her community. In 8th grade, she & her brothers formed an art appreciation club & in 2016 created a non-profit organization, Art for Others. They bring art supplies and conduct workshops for needy children.\n\nwww.angelasantalo.wixsite.com/artforothers\n\n​Tell me about your non-profit organization y and your brothers created together, Art for Others?\n\nArt for Others has become a mission for us. My family and I had a large fire when I was in second grade. It was a difficult time for all of us. We were out of our home for a year and half. My mom and dad made sure to keep our lives as normal as possible. Ballet classes, and Spanish dance for me and baseball and art for my brothers…. everything continued. My parents reminded us of everything we still had. We didn’t have things, but we had each other. The walls of the rental house were bare because we lost my dad's artwork among many things. My mom made it our mission to fill those walls with all Santalo originals! And that's what my brothers and I did.\n\nMy older brother and I realized how important this was for us. We knew we needed to share this with others. We first started an Art Appreciation Club in the summer of my eighth grade. A lot of our friends didn't even know about all the great art venues throughout Miami. We later realized that there would be kids who would not be able to join us and were the ones who needed art the most. We formed Art For Others to bring art and art supplies to needy and sick children from my community. All three of us are passionate and committed to bringing art to others.\n\nOur nonprofit has several goals. The first is to let young people know about all the great art that is available in Miami. My father is an artist, so we have been surrounded by art our entire lives. Every month, I plan an outing. I research the events and coordinate the time and place and communicate it to the students. We have kids from all over Miami. We have even included exchanges students from Italy and Spain in many of our functions. We have visited different art venues including Art Basel, Wynwood Walls, Coconut Grove, Coral Gables Theater, the PAMM. We have even done a bike tour around our city to see the Art in Public Places.\n\nThe second and most important goal is to bring art to the children who need it the most. We work with many of the sick children at the Ronald McDonald house and their families. We also work with the children at Centro Mater, a low income after school care.\n\nThe last goal is to collect art supplies for them so they can continue to create something beautiful even when we are no longer there.\n\nWhat do you love most about art and why?\n\nI love the arts. It has been a huge part of my growing up. My father is an artist and we have been around exhibitions and museums always. Music, dance, and art were also infused in my grammar school curriculum. I have danced and performed since I was four years old. I enjoy singing and love being on stage. I have discovered a love for musical theater at St. Brendan. I enjoy creating and working with others. I am a very dedicated and committed student, but the arts complete me.\n\nI have always been at the top of my class. I take my studies very seriously and put forth maximum effort. I have always been driven and have a commitment to do things well. I have had great teachers and have done well in my classes, but I have learned a great deal about myself in drama in high school. I gained confidence and many wonderful friends. I have been dancing since I was 4, but in drama I found my voice. I really did not know that I could sing, but more importantly, I learned that my voice was powerful, and my ideas were meant to be shared.\n\nWhy do you think you are inspiring?\n\nI am so fortunate that so many people believe in my vision and have supported me. Helping others brings me joy. I think since I am happy, that may be contagious.\n\nWhat are some of the ways you keep yourself organized?\n\nI have always been very involved in many activities, so from a young age I learned to prioritize.\n\n​What are your plans for the future?\n\nMy entire life, I thought I was going to study something in medicine. I graduated from high school with 37 college credits. After my first semester, I realized that it was not what I had envisioned. I did well in my classes, but it did not complete me in the way I thought it would. I have switched to Communications Art. It is still a lot of work since I am in the Honors College at Florida International University, but I am enjoying my classes and what I am learning. I hope to be able to help Art for Others continue to grow with all my new skills.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to be where you are today?\n\nMy advice to any young person is to become involved in anything and everything. These years go by too quickly. I also would tell them not let set backs get you down. I have been dancing my entire life and did not make my high school dance team, but it was because of this set back that I discovered that I can sing, and that I love theater. It is because of this, that I met some amazing people and learned so much about myself. I didn’t even know I could sing! Because of this setback, I was able to form the first high school Dance Honor Society for my Conservatory of the Arts where I have danced since I was four.\n\nBe open to possibilities. Sometimes the plan is even bigger than just us. Take chances, be open, and don't give up.\n\nWhat is your favorite pastime?\n\nMy favorite activity in addition to Art for Others, includes singing with my friends. I also enjoy traveling, and I love going to the theater!\n\nAny hidden talents?\n\nMy hidden talent, which is not so hidden any more, is that I can sing. I am also very funny.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nMy mom is inspiring because she always puts the needs of others before herself. My parents both always look at the positive side of everything. They inspire me to be better.\n\nPizza or tacos? Soda or Water? Dogs or Cats?\n\nTacos, always tacos! I love soda, but I will drink water. Dogs are great!\n\nThree things on your bucket list?\n\nI would love to travel the world, swim with the pigs in the Exuma, Bahamas, and be on Saturday Night Live!\n\nAnything else you want to add?\n\nI am very grateful and honored to have been selected among so many amazing teens. ​\n\nAngela will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nAidan Mendoza - Texas\n\nInterview by Larissa Chelius.\n\nNomination and Photography by April Mendoza Photography.\n\nCover/Scholarship Winner for Issue 17 of Inspiring Teens Magazine.\n\n​The Nomination: Aidan has an amazing work ethic and is very self-motivated. He has been interested in playing the guitar since he was a toddler, and the interest stuck with him. He started on guitar, but he switched over to bass. That has been his love. Then last year he started playing drums, and like the bass he has really excelled due to his desire to practice many hours a day. He is in house band at School of Rock Clear Lake which is their main performing band that he had to audition for. The kids at School of Rock are such a tight group. Even when they are not playing a gig somewhere, they are usually together hanging out on the weekends. One of the things I really love is how supportive they all are to each other.\n\n​How did you become interested in music and what made you decide that this is something you want to pursue in life?\n\nEver since I was five, music is something that I've always had a strong passion for. I was always so interested in how music came together and worked along with the stuff going on deeper inside of it. It was watching music videos and people performing that made me want to pick up an instrument, and ever since I immediately knew what I wanted to do.\n\n​What kind of community has the school of rock been for you?\n\nSchool of Rock is a really great place to start out for anyone who wants to pursue music. With many excellent and supportive instructors, it has helped me a lot in many ways. I have gained a lot of experience in the past two years attending School of Rock. From being able to join the house band and getting to play countless shows at many places around Texas, it has brought me great experiences to becoming a professional musician. Playing live is one of the most thrilling and addictive experiences ever, and I can't thank the people at School of Rock enough for giving me these opportunities.\n\n​Tell us a little bit about the relationships made at School of Rock.\n\nSchool of Rock is a really great place to meet people who have the same passion and love for music as you do. I have made many great friends and opportunities because of it. It's also a really great way to network with other musicians, who've since I've and many others started bands and musical projects with.\n\nWho has inspired you the most as a musician?\n\nFor me, it would have to be John Mayer. He has changed me a lot as a person and a musician, a lot for the better. He taught me that it's okay to go outside of the lines and to be able to express yourself musically however you feel is right to you. You don't have to line up behind what's popular, it's okay to share what you truly love even if people aren't into it at the moment. Cross musical borders, do not be afraid to do something that you can't compare with something that is already heard.\n\nWhat do you plan on doing after high school?\n\nI would really like to see where music takes me in life. It's honestly what I love doing the most. I would even love to attend a school such as Berklee College of Music one day too!\n\nHas homeschooling affected your career in music?\n\nIn good ways yes, it certainly has given me a lot more time to fulfill being a musician while being able to maintain schoolwork and good grades.\n\nAidan will be on the cover and featured in Issue 17 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nLaura Cardona - Colorado\n\nInterview by Larissa Chelius\n\nNomination and Photography by Ross Bothwell (Roka Studios)\n\nFeatured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination: Laura Cardona is a competitive ice skater, plays piano, and most importantly put her education first in high school. She has taken lots of AP classes, has academic scholarship offers. She puts in so much time and passion into everything and succeeds at everything she puts her mind to.\n\nHow is the search for academic scholarships going for you?\n\nI am applying to several private colleges and universities. I will hear from most of them in March or April.\n\nI have already been given the following Merit Scholarships:\n\nCollege of Saint Benedict. Trustees’ Scholarship of $106K\n\nArcadia University $100K\n\nButler University $80K\n\n​What else do you do besides study?\n\nI have earned over 200 medals and several trophies in ice skating. In addition to this, I am a Regional Champion and a USFSA double gold medalist.\n\nIce skating came into my life by accident. When I was 5 years old, I was at the water fountain playing across the street from the ice rink. This was the first time I went to this water fountain. While I was playing, I saw a big sign on a building that said, ”ICE”. I asked my mom if we could go inside the building. We watched the skaters jump and spin, and I knew right away that I wanted to be a figure skater. I asked my mom if I could skate and she signed me up for the Learn to Skate program. On my first day of lessons, I couldn't stand up on the ice. I needed to use a bucket in order to stay on my feet. I passed the basic 1 level, but I never passed the basic 2 test. After failing my basic 2 test twice, my mom decided to get a private coach and start private lessons. As the years passed, my passion for ice skating increased more and more. I love to compete and perform in front of an audience and the judges.\n\nI have also been playing piano for 14 years, and I compete at local, regional, and state competitions. I have been invited to perform in honors recitals, and I have also received Top Performer and Honorable Mention awards at piano competitions.\n\nHow do you maintain good grades with all your activities?\n\nI have great time management skills and I get my work done as soon as I can. I never pile my homework. Also, I always use my planner at school so that I can manage my tasks.\n\nWhat do you plan on doing after high school?\n\nI want to be a lawyer. I am primarily interested in international law and corporate law. I want to major in International Political Economy.\n\nLaura was featured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nImage by Lisa Weaver\n\nAbigail Doran - Ohio\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination by Tyna Norman\n\nPhotography by Lisa Weaver & David Beckham Photography\n\nThe Nomination: Abigail Doran is a fantastic leader, cheerleader and Instagram influencer her ig handle is amod78. She has been cheering since kindergarten and is involved in competitive cheerleading for her high school. She has overcome a lot to be involved in the sport. She has scoliosis and is still a flyer for the team. In middle school she was bullied a lot by members of the cheer team, but she did not quit the team because she loved the sport. She has recently changed schools from a very small school to a very large school and will be trying out for their cheer team where the competition is much harder. This will help her learn new skills, make new friends, and learn a new program.\n\nDue to her scoliosis Abigail had to give up her love for competitive gymnastics where she won numerous all-around titles and was the USAG state beam champion but she’s now a gymnastics coach and she is able to teach young girls the sport she loved!\n\nShe’s also focused on her academics and has a 3.5 overall GPA and she’s almost done with her sophomore year.\n\nShe just happens to be a signed model with the top modeling agency in Ohio - Heyman and has done ads for Huffy and recently did an ad for the new makeup line for Tarte cosmetics called Sugar Crush carried at Ulta Beauty.\n\nImage by Lisa Weaver\n\nWhen did your career in cheerleading begin? What is your favorite part about the sport?\n\nI began cheering when I was in kindergarten and tried out for the school team in 7th grade. My favorite part is being able to cheer on the football and basketball teams. I love both sports, but my favorite is basketball and to be able to stand on the court and cheer on a close game is super fun!\n\nWhat are some ways you stay positive through the cheer season as you have scoliosis? What were some thoughts you had when you found out you had it?\n\nI have to go to the chiropractor a lot which helps, but I focus on what I can do rather than what I can’t. There’s a lot of people who are a lot worse than I am so I’m extremely fortunate! When I first found out I had it, I had never heard of it. Our school nurse was the first to find it and then I had to go through a bunch of follow up testing. I was sad when I had to give up tumbling however, I can still cheer!\n\nImage by Lisa Weaver\n\n​How did you deal with bullies on your team? How did you keep your confidence up during that time?\n\nThe bullying was by far the worst. School bullying is a very bad situation to be in. It started out slow and then got bigger. It lasted for about 2 years. At first, I ignored it thinking it would go away but it didn’t. Then the 2nd year was the worst and it turned to social media bullying, so my mom had to get the school involved. My school did not handle the situation well and some of the parents were not nice about it.\n\nI stayed positive by focusing on what I liked to do and being around friends that were supportive and by telling my mom what was going on.\n\nWhat is your favorite part about being a gymnastics coach? How many hours a week do you coach?\n\nSince I couldn’t tumble anymore, what’s the next best thing than to coach!? I love to teach, and this is how I can still be involved in the sport I love and share my expertise with others. I coach up to 20 hours a week and coach mainly gymnastics, but they have me teach a couple cheer classes also. It’s the best of both worlds!\n\n​​Tell us about your modeling agency. When did you start modeling? What is your favorite part about it? What job are you most proud of?\n\nI started out doing pageants but then grew out of them and wanted to go into something else. So, I sat down for a photoshoot and submitted a picture to our state agency and was signed in 2018!\n\nMy favorite part is being able to put on makeup and cool clothes, and I love posing for the camera. I’m most proud of my Huffy job that’s on Amazon and my Tarte Cosmetics for Ulta Beauty.\n\nImage by David Beckham Photography\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to be where you are today?\n\nMy advice is be yourself - not someone else\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years/what are your plans for the future?\n\nMy goals are to continue my modeling career and attend college and go into the medical field.\n\nWhat about you inspires others/why do you think you are inspiring?\n\nI think I inspire others because I have encountered a lot of obstacles along my journey, but I don’t let the roadblocks stop me. Life isn’t easy and the road along the way is hard work. If you have a goal expect there to be problems achieving it, but don’t let it stop you - keep going!\n\nHow do you keep yourself organized with everything you have on your plate?\n\nMy mom is definitely my organizer. She helps in this area! We all need a partner because we can’t do it all ourselves.\n\nWhat is your favorite activity or pastime that wasn’t in your nomination?\n\nI have several; I love rap music, hanging out with my friends, making funny videos, love to travel, I love roller coasters, and working out.\n\nDo you have a hidden talent? What is it?\n\nMy hidden talent is I’m a really good rapper\n\nWho do you find inspiring?\n\nI find inspiring stories about people inspiring but Selma Gomez is inspiring\n\nPizza or Tacos? Soda or Water? Cats or Dogs?\n\nThat’s hard because I love both pizza and tacos, soda, and cats\n\n3 Things on your bucket list\n\nSky diving, the biggest roller coaster I can find, and travel Europe\n\nAbigail will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nEmily Williams - Texas\n\nInterview by Larissa Chelius\n\nNomination by Addison Schale\n\nPhotography by Emily Williams, Addison Schale, & Tammy Williams\n\nFeatured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nThe Nomination: Emily Williams is inspiring to me because she is hard working, patient and always has a smile on her face. At the age of 17 Emily started her own boutique from the ground up called Ellie Mae. She has put in lots of late nights, money and many phone calls to create a business she has always dreamed of. She is working every day to grow her business so she can eventually make it a full-time job & create a brand out of it. She is only a senior in high school, trying to figure out where she wants to go to college, make good grades & run a business. She always seems to amaze me with her uplifting spirit and hard work. I think that’s pretty inspiring to me:)\n\n​When did you become interested in fashion and how did it turn into running your own boutique?\n\nI have always been interested in fashion since I was a little girl. The fun clothes and accessories have always fascinated me. I really began my fashion career my freshman year of high school. I began to find inspiration in older bloggers and that would inspire the style of my outfits. I was always the odd ball out because I didn’t wear a t-shirt and shorts to school like ninety percent of the girls. I dressed up as if I was going out to a nice restaurant. That’s what I love though. Like Coco Chanel said, “The World is your runway.” Every day is a day I can style an outfit and show it off to the world. Which, in the end, is my way of expressing my personality. How fun is that, that men and women can express who they are through styling clothes in different ways? I absolutely love it.\n\nTaking it way back, Ellie Mae (my boutique) started with me bringing it up to my mom one day. I was very nervous because it was way out there. I worked at two boutiques prior to starting my own, and I realized I wanted to do that. So long story short, my mom agreed, and my dad invested. Then, we made a logo, set up a website, bought some clothes, took pictures, set up social media, and took a shot in the dark!\n\nHow do you maintain good grades while running the boutique & do you plan on running the boutique while attending college?\n\nThis is a tough one for sure. Time management is the key to this one. I organize my time and set my priorities accordingly.\n\nYes! I do plan on running the boutique while attending college. It’s a one woman show. I take the pictures, edit pictures, do the website designs/editing, all the marketing, shipping, buying new products, everything that goes into, I do (with help from my sweet mom). Regardless, I will be able to find a way to maintain it, especially since I have a passion for my boutique and everything that goes into it.\n\nDo you plan on expanding the boutique?\n\nYes, I do! I have long term goals for my boutique, and short term. Overall, it is a huge learning experience. Learning time management, service to others, professional manners, financial components, maintaining consistency, and much more.\n\n​What advice would you give to others who are interested in starting their own business?\n\nI would say two things. One, never give up. I know it’s cliché, but doubt and discouragement will creep in whether you start one or are thinking about starting one. You have to look past that and remember you are doing what you love. Two, hard work will pay off sooner or later. It took five months before I could start seeing my hard work pay off. It seems like a long time, but once you can sit down and say to yourself, “I did that”, then it was definitely worthwhile.\n\nEmily was featured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nBriley Carter - Kentucky\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination and Photography by Samantha Tooley (Tooley Photography)\n\nFeatured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination: Briley has been through more in her life that most kids ever need to go through. She was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at a young age. She was diagnosed after crashing and almost dying. Around the same time, her family home burned, and her family had to rebuild. This past year, the day before her senior shoot, her family home was hit by a tornado (while her brother and sister were home alone while she and her parents were at her golf tournament). She spent the scheduled day of her senior pictures cleaning up and packing what was left of their home.\n\nOn top of all of this, Briley hasn't missed a beat. She has continued her successful golfing career and will be attending college to further that career. She has worked with families who have children with Type 1 Diabetes as their caregiver to help manage their diabetes. She joined the DanceBlue committee as a sophomore and is now the Team Relations Chair. DanceBlue is a dance marathon that raises money for kids with pediatric cancer. Their committee raised over $50,000 last year for pediatric cancer!\n\nBriley is an inspiration - a breath of fresh air. She has such an amazing future ahead of her!\n\nImage by Owensboro times\n\n​How did you become interested in golfing?\n\nI became interested in golf through my dad. He would always take me out to the course when I was little and i would watch him play; I have been around golf since I could remember; I started playing the sport at age 6 and then I joined the high school varsity team in the 5th grade. I will continue my golf career at Campbellsville University.\n\n​\n\nTell me about your position being the Team Relations Chair.\n\nBeing the Team Relations Chair on our DanceBlue committee is something I am incredibly proud of. DanceBlue is a 24 hour dance marathon where the participants don’t sit down or sleep or rest to raise money for pediatric cancer. DanceBlue originated at the University of Kentucky and their committee branched out their enthusiasm to many high school across the state. My school, committee, and community raised over $68,000 for the kids at our eight hour mini marathon, and every penny went to the kids in the hospital at UK. As the Team Relations Chair, I get together door prizes, make sure all the food is ordered for our marathon, and create competitions between dancers. Helping these kids will be a passion of mine forever.\n\nImage by Tooley Photography\n\nHow did you cope with having Type 1 diabetes at a young age?\n\nCoping with T1D, at first, was a very hard thing. I constantly asked myself, “Why me?” and would come home crying after school every day. After a few months, I asked myself, “Why me?” again, but with a different perspective. I then saw my disease as a window of new opportunities; and knew that God gave this to me for a reason and I needed to figure out that reason. I now babysit other kids with T1D; I also get many families coming to me and asking how I made peace with my disease and if I could help their child out in doing the same.\n\nTell me a little bit about rebuilding your home.\n\nGoing through the rebuilding process of my house was a struggle. We were considered homeless for almost five months- we moved back into our house on December 31st and January 8th would’ve been five months. Rebuilding our house from the tornado wasn’t our first experience with having to rebuild; in 2007 we had a house fire and lost everything. I say ‘house’ instead of ‘home’ because I am a true believer that “home is where the heart is” and as long as my family is safe and we were all together, I was at home. I’m thankful that my siblings- who were home alone during the tornado- are safe and still with me and that means more than any materialistic thing.\n\nImage by Carrie Carter\n\nWhat’s next for you?\n\n​I hope to double-major in Criminal Justice and Psychology and minor in communications at Campbellsville University after high school. After that, I am hoping I will find myself in an investigation job. I also plan to go on many international mission trips and further the name of Christ to many nations. I also plan to be the best version of myself and not let my diabetes or other struggles in life to control my happiness.\n\nJoe Gryboski - Indiana\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination and Photography by Jennifer Dunn Photography\n\nIssue 16 Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\nThe Nomination: I cannot say enough good things about Joe! Not only is he an Eagle Scout, he also plays varsity soccer and manages the girls’ basketball team. Joe is a great student and very driven. The best thing about Joe for me is how helpful and fun he is. He adds so much as the only guy on my model rep team. He makes each session so much fun for everyone!\n\nHow did you become interested in soccer?\n\nI became interested in soccer as a kid who just wanted to get out of the house and have fun. I started playing soccer when I was three years old, and I haven’t stopped playing since. I started\n\nplaying rec-league, but I decided that I wanted to improve my skills heading into high school, so I tried out for a travel team. I have played for the Kentucky Fire Jrs. and for the Southern Indiana United club teams. While travel ball was a lot of fun, I have made some of my best memories and friends playing soccer for my high school, Our Lady of Providence. Two of these incredible memories include getting to play in the Indiana State Championship game as a sophomore and leading my team to the Semi-State Finals as a senior.\n\n​What are your experiences of being the only guy on your model rep team?\n\nBeing the only guy on Jennifer Dunn Photography’s model rep team has been interesting to say the least. While the female models are usually doing similar things on shoots, Jennifer and I get come up with unique ways to include me. This results in me being the subject in photos that really stand out. I have been given the opportunity to be creative and express myself in ways that I hadn’t thought of before. My mom originally forced me to join Jennifer’s team, but I am thankful that she did because I have developed a real interest in photography.\n\nImage by Dawn Gryboski\n\nTell me about your Eagle Scout leadership opportunities.\n\nIt had always been my goal to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout; I fulfilled this goal this past summer with the completion of my Eagle Scout Project. My project was providing Norton Children’s Hospital with two gaming carts that were equipped with a Wii, an Xbox, and a flatscreen TV. During this project I oversaw the fundraising, construction, and installation of these carts, which included working with over 50 people. Throughout this whole process, I learned that I was capable of leading others whether it was listening, guiding, or instructing them. I am very proud to have been able to help out my community.\n\n​What are your plans for the future?\n\nWhile I don’t currently know which college I will be attending this Fall, I do know that I want to major in Sports Medicine Physical Therapy, and possibly minor in Photography. I want to study Sports Medicine Physical Therapy because of my love of helping others and my love of sports. I have encountered numerous injuries during my athletic career, so I have seen firsthand how important the job of Physical Therapists can be. I want to minor in Photography because of my new interest in that creative field. I have always been intrigued by it because my mom has let me use her camera before, but the experiences of being on Jennifer Dunn’s model rep team has solidified my interest.\n\n​\n\nJoe was featured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nMeaghan Comer - Virginia\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination by James Comer | Photography by James Comer & Kris Currie\n\nFeatured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nThe Nomination: Meaghan Comer inspires me daily. She has battled and overcome issues that stem her chronic condition, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Even though her joints pop out of place easily, she is a member of the University of Mary Washington swim team (try swimming butterfly stroke with one good arm or backstroke with a knee out of joint) where she is a respected member of the team. Her condition also led to bouts of anxiety which she has also overcome. The experience has inspired her to become a childhood developmental therapist so that she can help other children deal with their condition. She learns each day how strong she truly is and yet she still has barely touched the surface of that strength.\n\n​\n\n​How did you become interested in swimming?\n\nI became interested in swimming when I was in elementary school. My family signed my younger sister and I up for swim and that's when I fell in love with the sport. I was never an aggressive child so contact sports were difficult for me as I did not want to confront someone for the ball. Swimming allowed me to be competitive but stay in my own element. I have always enjoyed that I can do it on my own and not have to be physically assertive, yet I still have a team that is supportive and makes the sport fun.\n\nTell us a little bit about your condition.\n\nEhlers Danlos syndrome is a connective tissue disorder affecting the collagen. There are thirteen different types, mine being the hypermobile type. This means that my skin is fragile, it scars and bruises easily and my joints are hypermobile and unstable. It primarily affects me in that I have joint subluxations and dislocations and causes me to dislocate my joints easily. Ehlers Danlos syndrome is a spectrum disorder and affects all those who have it differently.\n\nWhat are some ways you work around your condition when swimming?\n\nI can work around my condition by being open with my coaches and teammates. At the beginning of the season I had a meeting with our head coach at the University of Mary Washington to discuss how we could overcome some of the troubles Ehlers Danlos can cause me. We developed a plan that if I am unable to keep up, due to pain or dislocations I can modify what we are doing, such as by kicking with fins. My teammates are also very supportive. Many of them have learned how to assist me when my shoulder is not correctly in joint or they will go get someone who is able to help me. My teammates have pulled me out of pools when I was unable to get out and they have sat with me when I couldn’t get up. Weight training is also an important aspect of college swimming. Through weight training, I am building the muscles around my joints which helps them stay in place better. I have also started to see our athletic trainer a few times a week to help manage some of my other symptoms. By being open and honest about what I am facing it has opened many opportunities for me to succeed in swimming.\n\nWhat are your plans for the future?\n\nMy plans for the near future are to graduate from the University of Mary Washington with my bachelor’s in psychology and go onto graduate school to earn my master’s degree. As I am doing that, I hope to bring more awareness to Ehlers Danlos syndrome and provide support for those who have it as well as educate those who have not heard of it.\n\nMeaghan was featured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nPeyton Fearin - Texas\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination and Photography by Kingston Photography\n\nFeatured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​The Nomination: Peyton is a beautiful girl but her true beauty shines from within. She is a loved by her peers and is kind to everyone she meets. She is a youth leader at her church and loves helping with the Special Olympics. She is a member of the National Honors Society at Prosper high school. It is a 6A school, so you can see how competitive that is. She has been on the PHS cheer team all four years of high school but has been cheering most of her life. She also coaches youth cheerleading at PYSA. She is involved in several high school clubs and various volunteer activities in and outside of school.\n\nTell me about your involvement with the Special Olympics and your favorite part about it.\n\nAs a Prosper cheerleader, we attend Special Olympics every year to help support all the athletes who compete at the event. I love being able to work with and get to know all the people attending the event. It truly is a heartwarming experience and very eye opening. It has taught me to look at situations with positivity.\n\nHow did your career in cheerleading begin?\n\nI started cheering my freshman year of high school after doing competitive cheerleading for one year. After being a gymnast for ten years, I decided I wanted a change, so I chose to cheer. I am extremely happy I decided to try out for cheer because I have made lifelong friends and memories.\n\n​How do you keep yourself organized and earn yourself a position in NHS with all your amazing extracurricular activities?\n\nThe National Honors Society is an extremely prestigious program with rigorous requirements to be inducted. I really pushed myself to stay on top of my grades, do community service, and make myself a prominent figure at school in order to get into NHS. I’ve had to learn to balance school, cheer, and work in order to achieve being in the program.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 10 years?\n\nIn ten years, I hope to be working in the medical field as a Trauma Nurse! My goal in life has always been to help others and the medical field is the perfect place to do it! I hope I am happy and surrounded by people who love me and support me.\n\nDo you plan on continuing with cheerleading? Why or why not?\n\nAlthough cheerleading has given me the memories and opportunities, I will not be continuing my career. I have suffered many injuries in which prevent me from doing what I love. Therefore, I chose not to cheer at a collegiate level.\n\nPeyton will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\n​Emily Williams – Ohio\n\nInterview by Zoe D'Angelo\n\nNomination and Photography by Memories by Tawnya Photography\n\nFeatured in Issue 19 Inspiring Teens Magazine - Music\n\n​\n\nThe Nomination: Emily was a huge help in leading her band this last summer into school year unexpected due to her teacher having a medical issue happen! Emily took on the role of helping her peers by leading and working with students that needed extra help. She also helped the assistant and sub teachers prep for band by getting materials ready. Emily did every task that landed in her lap. She even helped load and unload the bus before and after events and games. All this led to her astounding accomplishment of her as Field Commander. Emily also won the Outstanding Leadership Award. She is in School Musicals, Choir and the Art Club. Emily is also heavily involved with her church. ​\n\n​What happened for you to step into the leader role you received with music?\n\nMy music teacher had planned surgery that lead to complications that were unexpected. She couldn’t be back in time, so she asked me if I could step in and be the Field Commander to help the fill-in director. We all worked together to make this past marching band season happen. My classmates and I continue to pray that our director will be able to return to doing what she loves. In the end, we are all there to make music, and be a family.\n\nTell us about the role of Field Commander position you had.\n\nA Field Commander is under the director but is the highest leadership position in the band. I started during percussion camp, sorting through music for all the underclassman's folders. I then went through band camp with my fellow peers. Typically, field commanders have their own camp where they learn to direct, but I crammed it in a couple days. Luckily, I had amazing directors that were there to help guide me along the way! Eventually, we got our whole show together, and would prepare for competitions. In between these, I'd painted a couple 8 ft. backdrops that are placed on the field for a show. I'd also help with minor things like fetching things for directors and getting rubber bands to kids (for their flip folders.)\n\n​How did you become a role model by helping your peers who needed extra help?\n\nThe first day of band camp, all of us seniors introduced ourselves to the under classmen to make them feel comfortable. We all knew what it was like being the new kid on the first day, and we just wanted them to feel accepted. Anytime a kid would need help, I would try to help them to the best of my ability. I helped teach kids the fundamentals of marching. Most people think it's not that hard to do, but they've never had to make sure they have a good posture, rolling their feet, carrying an instrument, and trying to play at the same time. Some kids would get frustrated, but I'd encourage them to keep at it.\n\nWhat is the Marching Band Award you have won?\n\nIt was an award given to me by my director my junior year of high school (2017-2018). This award goes to the marcher who never settles and is willing to do what it takes to help the band succeed. I think I've won it because I strive to show that our Class C band can march as good as any Class B or A band. Yes, those bands are big, but they don't have the strong family connection a small band like ours has. We treat each other like family, and family we stay.\n\n​What are some of the activities you are involved with at your church?\n\nI enjoy helping people doing work for the kingdom. I'm involved in our church’s youth group and the Sunday school. For Sunday school, I help with the 4 and 5-year-olds and love contributing to both. I love teaching little kids about the Lord and His great love for them. Seeing their smiling faces each week brings me indescribable joy.\n\nEmily will be featured in Issue 19 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\nEllie Stump - Pennsylvania\n\nInterview by Zoe D’Angelo\n\nNomination and Photography by Tricia Stump\n\nFeatured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\nThe nomination: Ellie stump never gave up. She had become very ill and was hospitalized and had to learn how to walk and talk again. She is now very active in cheer at Dallastown High school.\n\n​What was your illness that put you in the hospital?\n\nGuillain-Barre Syndrome a rare disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nervous system.\n\nTell us about the events you went through leading up to your hospitalization.\n\nI had a severe stomach bug. A week later I started having severe headaches. My parents took me to the ER where I had a cat scan. They sent me home, and a few days later I ended up at the Pediatrician because I still had bad headaches, my speech started to slur, my feet felt heavy and my muscles were very sore. That doctor sent me to a neurologist, and she thought I had GBS. She sent me to Hershey Hospital. While there I went through many tests, which included a spinal tap and an MRI. I couldn't swallow, so I was given a feeding tube.\n\n​What were your biggest obstacles during these hard times and how did you stay so determined?\n\nWhile paralyzed, and not able to walk, talk or eat, I spent seven days in Hershey PICU and was then transferred to Hershey Pediatric Rehab. I went through many hours of therapy, learning to walk, talk and eat. It was scary and frustrating. What kept me motivated was to be able to eat real food again, go back to school to see my friends, go home to see my dog, and play volleyball again.\n\nIf there was one thing you would want people to know about you, what would it be?\n\nBefore my illness I was shy and didn't really try new things. When I finally came home and was released from therapy, I decided to try out for our school cheer leading team. I wasn't sure I'd make it, but I did. I also went back to my club volleyball team and became part of student council.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who may be where you were?\n\nI'd say stay positive, have faith, and never give up. Believe that you are strong enough and stay focused on your future goals. Rely on your support system. For me that was my parents and my older sister Lydia. She was in middle school when this happened, but she came to see me almost every night after school. She was so encouraging and thoughtful. Every girl should have a big sister like her.\n\nEllie was featured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine!\n\n​Alaina Caswell - 18 - Indiana\n\nInterview by Larissa Chelius\n\nNomination and Photography by Jennifer Dunn Photography\n\nIssue 16 Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\nThe Nomination: Alaina is one of the sweetest girls I have ever met. She loves her family and her sweet dog Jackson! She is always willing to go above and beyond to help others!\n\nWhat challenges have you overcome?\n\nMy sophomore year of high school I had severe back pain and severe headaches. I ended up having a tethered cord surgery. My spine was attached to my spinal column by a piece of fatty tissue and it had to be cut. It was supposed to be a simple surgery with a short recovery time, but I was out of school out for the rest of the school year. My head hurt constantly, and simple tasks became hard. Later that year I began having absence seizures. I was so sad that I was missing out at school and couldn’t hang out with my friends. I became depressed and it was by far the lowest point of my life. Around April, my doctors finally found a medicine that began easing my pain. I remember working so hard to keep up with my schoolwork. I was determined to do well and not let anything stop me. I finished that year with a 4.2 gpa. That year was a true victory my me physically and mentally. I definitely grew as a person that year.\n\nWhat activities do you participate in?\n\nI’ve been a member of the Riley Dance Marathon committee for two years. Dance Marathon is an event at my school that raises money to benefit Riley Children’s Hospital in Indianapolis. Students attend Dance Marathon after raising money and stay on their feet for eight hours in support of the children who cannot in the hospital. Committee members oversee the entire event and my groups job is to stay in direct contact with the hospital. We invite Riley children to attend and share their inspiring stories. This extracurricular is important to me because my family is a Riley family. My sister and I have both been treated at the hospital. My sister had a shunt surgically implanted in her head and several Lumbar punctures. I received treatment for severe headaches. My family is extremely thankful for the amazing care we received there.\n\nWhat do you do to help others?\n\nDance Marathon is the main way I help others. Last year, the fundraiser raised over $63,000 for the hospital! I was so proud to be a part of that. Every sick child deserves the best care when they’re battling an illness and that’s exactly what Riley offers. I should know! I’m so passionate about the work that Riley does and I’m thankful I have the opportunity to give back to them.\n\nAlaina was featured in Issue 16 of Inspiring Teens Magazine."
