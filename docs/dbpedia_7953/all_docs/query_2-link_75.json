        "meta_description": "Come slide down the Rabbit Hole into my imagination with these Alice In Wonderland Inspired Butterflies! These butterflies were designed, created and brought to life by me, Renea Harrison. Each detail of these butterflies, reflect my love for the Alice In Wonderland Adventure and this set was created to depict \"The Red Queen\" . From the ornate crown with crystal accents, the sceptor with heart accents thorax, the Divalicious print of her bustier, and the card motif of her \"dress\" ruffles, each detail tells my story of The Red Queen. They make a wonderful embellishment for scrapbooking, cardmaking, altered item applications,weddings, birthdays or anything your creative mind can dream up. These butterflies are not clip art images. They are an original, and unique creation. These butterflies were designed, drawn, and colored from scratch, by me, exclusively for my Reneabouquets Shop. They were then printed onto Reneabouquets Premium Paper, meticulously hand painted with glitter paint accents, and given crystal accents for an amazing, shimmery look. They come with antennas in your color choice. Just lift the wings upon arrival to create even more dimension.",
