        "text": "We've been whingeing about the suburbs for more than a century. \"A spiritual Sahara\", Louis Esson​ dubbed it in 1911. \"An arid desert\" of \"sterile desolation\" wrote George Johnston in My Brother Jack (1964). An interchangeable \"shithole\" according to Christos Tsiolkas​ in 1995's Loaded. But it's a new millennium and a housing affordability crisis finds us desperate to reconnect with suburbia.\n\nThe suburban home is, after all, considered our inalienable right. It's the myth Australians grew up on and – despite the best efforts of urban theorists pushing inner-city density – what we still cling to.\n\nHoward Arkley understood this. But even he had his doubts. In the early 1990s Arkley had his own housing crisis. He was bored and frustrated and under pressure to produce. For the best part of a decade the artist had been working hard to establish the suburbs as a subject as worthy as the bush landscape tradition. And more relevant. If the fact that 80% of Australians live in the 'burbs wasn't enough, his seductive Pop images of suburban bungalows and triple-front-eds made a convincing case. That's all collectors seemed to want.\n\nCornered, he threatened to block supply. \"There ain't gonna be any more f---in houses,\" he would exclaim. He was more than just a house painter. With exhibitions coming up, what would he produce? The easiest thing would be to give the public what they want – knock out more suburban exteriors. Instead Arkley undertook his own home renovation. Mining his archive of patterns, home decorator manuals and stencils, he emerged with a series of exhibitions of stunning originality. Interiors each increasingly more elaborately decorative. 'Pointillist suburbs' whose impeccably stencilled and patterned exteriors resembled the work of an overzealous interior decorator. Freeways. Masks.\n\nThese works and their source material form part of a new survey exhibition of Arkley's work at TarraWarra Museum of Art . They provide the opportunity to witness what Chris McAuliffe​, author of Art and Suburbia, calls Arkley's \"anthropology of the suburbs\".\n\nArkley was not the only artist to tackle suburbia. In the work of John Brack​, Dale Hickey, Robert Rooney, Maria Kozic​, Aleks Danko​ the suburbs were \"no longer pictured as the stultifying antithesis of art, but as rich, complex and inviting symbolic form — the very stuff of art\", says McAuliffe. But Arkley did it directly, unironically.\n\n\"I wasn't sending anything up,\" Arkley said.\n\nIf the patterned 'Pointillist' houses are his arguable masterpieces, the quintessential Arkley house is the triple-fronted. In its glorious sunrise colours and crisp morning skies, earthy coloured stone fence, lush yet perfectly manicured garden, driveway to the horizon – here are the colours of Australia condensed into a suburban landscape. One that has literally become a postcard image.\n\nArkley died in 1999. Almost 20 years after his passing, his houses are imbued with new meaning – nostalgia. \"Arkley's pictures reflect the second phase of industrialisation in Australia,\" says urban historian Graeme Davison. \"The suburban dream was arguably at its height. People had good jobs, they were secure. Now the employment base of the outer suburbs has declined and people are marooned on the edge with fewer access to jobs.\"\n\nSimilar pressures affect a new generation of artists, traditionally also on lower incomes. For them the image of Arkley's triple-fronted is one receding in their rear-view mirror. Their own work records the grim recognition that befalls most of us, that our housing choices are limited.\n\n\"The housing market is so inflated that people view Arkley's work with a dream-like memory because maybe it's not so real anymore,\" says Verity Hayward, curator of the recent exhibition Quarter Acre. The Great Australian Dream is just that, a dream.\n\n\"The median home used to cost about two and a half times a median household's disposable income,\" according to the Grattan Institute's John Daley. \"Today it costs five times.\"\n\n\"A lot of the critique of the suburb proceeds from the opinion-makers in the inner city who think of themselves as environmentally and in other ways virtuous. [They] project all sorts of ills upon the suburbs which may be there, and many of which are not.\" - Urban historian Graeme Davison.\n\nAnd yet the dream is not elusive to all. \"Well over a million [people] now own a property and rent it out,\" according to Bob Birrell, member of the Australian Population Research Institute and former head of Monash Centre for Population and Urban Research.\n\nAs Adrian Doyle nails it in his Coin House sculpture, houses no longer represent home, but money.\n\nGiven that Arkley's work derived from real-estate ads, the commodification of the house should not come as such a shock. But his work does seem to reflect a less craven Australia. Consider Arkley's Sampling series (1998) inspired by swatches and decorator samples. These works tapped into the legion of house-proud owners embarking on the exciting world of Do It Yourself renovation – what the aspirational Kath and Kim breathlessly call, 'the R word'.\n\nIndeed DIY has a noble tradition. In the early 20th century the Arts and Craft movement promoted DIY to the middle classes as an honourable past time. In the post-war period the shortage of materials meant DIY was a necessity, and an ongoing source of home improvement conducted from the backyard shed. Today it's all about reselling. Countless reality shows – from The Block to The Living Room's Cherie Barber – promote DIY as an activity best done in a day, with as little outlay as possible to maximise profit. The home is not for living, it's an investment ripe for 'flipping'.\n\nThe consequences of this are found in the work of artists like photographer Jessie Scott, who documents the torn-down vernacular bungalows of Coburg, or Callum Morton, who depicts his destroyed family home as a bombed out Valhalla. Meanwhile in Penelope Hunt's fatalistic Island, nature overtakes a backyard pool before its aged owner and her home finally succumb to death and redevelopment.\n\nIt's not just fine art that records these seismic shifts. Even in the nostalgic niceness of Neighbours (whose opening credits took on a Arkleyesque appearance in the mid 2000s), its resident villain doubles as a developer. He threatens to doze the idyllic Ramsay Street and replace it with a shopping centre.\n\nPrefiguring this 21st century obsession with development is the classic Australian tale of compulsory acquisition, The Castle. Darryl Kerrigan's​ cri de coeur: 'You can't buy what I've got', echoes through to the hipster's affecting realisation in Courtney Barnett's lilting Depreston. Real lives are lived in suburbia. Still these are harsh economic times. Despite her poignant epiphany, the inner city girl can't help wondering how little the original owner would have paid for the Californian bungalow. Meanwhile a real-estate spiel provides the haunting chorus: \"If you've got a spare half a million, you could knock it down and start re-building.\"\n\nBarnett is only the latest to reassure us that life goes on in the 'burbs. In 1970 Hugh Stretton's Ideas for Australian Cities comforted the anxious anti-suburbanites that there were \"plenty of poets and intellectuals and painters who live in suburbs as any part of the city\", says Davison. Today our yardstick for cosmopolitanism is measured in coffee. A hurdle easily overcome in almost every suburb. Further proof of our highly evolved sophistication can be found in tattoo culture. Consider Howard Arkley's Tattooed Head. When he painted it in 1983 it represented a subcultural anomaly – a carnival freak, a madman or a criminal. Today it's your local barista.\n\nWhile Barnett's narrator struggles with the prospect of moving out of their comfort zone to Preston, the suburbs extend far further. David Wadelton's​ Urban Edge Style (2011) captures the outward sprawl and indifference to sustainability – a row of new houses across which remains a fragment of sold sign, \"SO\". Out here, as crime writer Peter Temple observed in Bad Debts, you 'can feel the pressure of the mortgage on your skin'.\n\n\"A lot of the critique of the suburb proceeds from the opinion-makers in the inner city who think of themselves as environmentally and in other ways virtuous,\" says Davison \"[They] project all sorts of ills upon the suburbs which may be there, and many of which are not.\"\n\nIronically it's in the inner and middle distance suburbs where more ground is covered by housing and less by garden. \"They think that means densification in a virtuous sense,\" says Davison. \"It doesn't necessarily. Go to the inner suburbs like Carlton and you'll see the typical single fronted single storey terrace house has now been extended at the back often up to two storeys. That house that in the 19th century would have had a family is now accommodating two people DINKS (dual income, no kids). All of us are using up more internal space and Australians use more lavishly than any other people on earth.\"\n\nOver-consumption satirised in the McMansions of Kath and Kim and the petrol-head excesses of Upper Middle Bogan, reflect a view from the centre, not the 'burbs looking in.\n\n\"Suburbia is not one thing, it's very many different things,\" says Mark Gibson, head of the Communications and Media Studies program at Monash University. \"But the suburbs don't have as much access to mainstream media representation. The people who produce the sitcoms or write in the paper tend not to come from Frankston.\"\n\nIndeed, Bob Birrell criticises the \"myth that fringe suburbia is full of McMansions. It should have died a long time ago\", he says. \"There are pockets of them in different parts of the outer suburbs. But lots are getting smaller, right down to 350sqm. All that frippery – cornices and triple fronts and multiple stories – that's renowned by inner city Melburnians is largely gone. They're tiny.\"\n\nDespite this no young family will swap a freestanding house for an apartment, he adds. \"It's too small and there's no protective space. Even if they wanted to move closer it would be [financially] unrealistic.\"\n\nDemographer Bernard Salt emphatically agrees: \"Let there be no mistake about the fact that this nation singularly and relentlessly pursued the quintessential suburban lifestyle in every major city during the second half of the 20th century… and will continue to do so over the early decades of the 21st century,\" he writes in the Big Shift. \"Despite recent emphasis on downtown living, this area attracts no more than 10 per cent of annual metropolitan growth in our capital cities. Australians still prefer the quarter-acre block, the carport and the barbecue area.\"\n\nThe Australian dream has life in it yet – for those with money and prepared to travel. Beware though, says Sue Turnbull, professor of Communication and Media Studies, University of Wollongong, who sees darkness in another cultural manifestation of suburbia, the crime fiction subgenre called 'domestic noir'.\n\nThe genre reflects a growing awareness this century that \"the real horror lies not in cities, but in the home in domestic violence. In fact the family is not a safe place\", says Turnbull. \"Family violence and incest didn't start to happen until after 2000. Yet all these things went on before, they just weren't talked about and happened behind closed doors. Today there is more discussion and knowledge and fewer illusions.\"\n\nArkley conjured this ambivalence in menacing dark windows and unpopulated scenes. Their manicured lawns and pristine exteriors could be as constricting as My Brother Jack's fictional suburb of Beverly Park Gardens Estate. Indeed, in the uncompromising novel its hero David Meredith displays his contempt for suburbia by enacting shocking violence on his wife. A man enraged, Meredith silently screams: \"I had been defeated by the forces of conformity.\"\n\nHowever dark the forces under which the dream can turn a life in to nightmare, the majority of us still hold on to the dream. Arkley's art represents that dream. His life, however, represents the reality. He spent almost a decade living outside the gritty inner city, so often favoured by artists – not in a freestanding triple-fronted, but a flat in suburban Oakleigh.\n\nHoward Arkley and Friends is at TarraWarra Museum of Art from December 5-February 28. Entry to the exhibition is free on Saturday and Sunday, and a range of family-friendly activities will be offered on site. www.twma.com.au\n\nRay Edgar is co-author of Spray: the work of Howard Arkley"
