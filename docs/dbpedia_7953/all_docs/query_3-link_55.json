        "text": "Introducing Cynthia Woolf's\n\nCAPITAL BRIDE\n\nUnexpectedly homeless, un-wed mother Sarah Johnson has few options. They could go live with her cousin William, but Sara believes there’s something untoward about his offer and it leaves her feeling uncomfortable. She's qualified to be a governess, but no one will have her because she wasn't married when she had her precious MaryAnn. Matchmaker & Co could be her salvation as mail-order-bride to Mr. John Atwood.\n\nSingle father, John Atwood, is raising his daughter the best he can in the wilds of the Colorado Territory but knows he needs help. No woman he knows wants to take on the raising of his daughter who hasn't spoken since she saw her mother brutally murdered during a bank robbery. Can Sarah, John and their two daughters overcome their pasts and find happiness together?\n\nAn Excerpt from Capital Bride\n\nNew York City April 10, 1867\n\nOn the other side of the door was her last resort. Either this or prostitution and prostitution was not a choice. She couldn’t raise MaryAnn in that environment, nor if truth be told, could she lower herself to live like that. At least this way there would be some stability in her little girl’s life.\n\nSarah took a deep breath, turned the knob, and walked through the door to a better future for her daughter and, if she were lucky, for herself.\n\nThe office was small and precisely kept. A single desk with a straight, high backed wooden chair, one in front and one behind, sat in the middle of the room. She’d noticed the flowered curtains were open on the way in, curtains tied to the side. The small area was flooded with dazzling afternoon light. The walls were whitewashed and the desk well organized. There were several tables with neat piles of files along one wall. The other wall held several rows of pictures of women and men. None smiling, as that was the way pictures were taken, but all appeared to be wedding pictures. Below each picture was a small brass place with the names of the bride and groom and the date of the wedding.\n\nA small, woman in her late thirties with fiery red hair, sat behind the desk. When Sarah got closer she saw gorgeous dark blue eyes behind the wire rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose. Her eyes were so dark a blue they could almost be called violet. They were striking and clear, honesty shone from them along with a “no nonsense” attitude.\n\n“May I help you?” the woman asked.\n\n“Um. Yes. My name is Sarah Johnson. I saw your advertisement for mail order brides.”\n\nThe woman looked Sarah over, taking in her clothes, her hands clasped in front of her and ending at her face.\n\n“First, let me introduce myself. I’m Margaret Selby and I own Matchmaker & Company. Please, sit down. You’re older than the women we usually have. You’re also better dressed and don’t appear to be hungry. What would bring someone like you to my door?”\n\n“I’ve been living with my great aunt. She passed away suddenly two weeks ago and the lawyer says I need to find other lodgings. My cousin, William, has inherited everything except a small stipend she left for me. William is selling everything. MaryAnn and I have nowhere else to go.”\n\n“MaryAnn?”\n\n“My daughter.”\n\n“So, you are a widow?”\n\nNow was not the time to be less than truthful, if she wanted this woman’s help. “No.”\n\n“I see. How old are you, Miss Johnson?”\n\n“I’m twenty-eight.”\n\n“And your daughter?”\n\n“MaryAnn is five.”\n\n“Tell me, Miss Johnson, how did you come to find yourself with child at age twenty-two without being married? Surely you knew how those things happened by that age.”\n\nMeet the Author\n\nCynthia Woolf was born in Denver, Colorado and raised in the mountains west of Golden. She spent her early years running wild around the mountain side with her friends.​ She worked her way through college and went to work full time straight after graduation and there was little time to write. Then in 1990 she and two friends started a round robin writing a story about pirates. She found that she missed the writing and kept on with other stories. In 1992 she joined Colorado Romance Writers and Romance Writers of America.\n\nIn 2001, she saw an ad in the paper for a writers conference being put on by CRW and decided she'd attend. One of her favorite authors, Catherine Coulter, was the keynote speaker. Cynthia was lucky enough to have a seat at Ms. Coulter's table at the luncheon and after talking with her, decided she needed to get back to her writing. She rejoined both CRW and RWA that day and hasn't looked back.\n\nLearn more about the author at: ​www.cynthiawoolf.com​.\n\nClick of Official Tour Schedule\n\nMy Review: I signed up for the Eve Hallows Blog Tour back in October because I was looking for an unusual Halloween read, and I enjoyed it so much!!! It was just the type of creepy YA fiction that I like - a departure from the usual vampire fare. The storyline and characters were unique and compelling. I have to say my favorite scenes were in Eve's father's pizza restaurant...absolutely hysterical. This is a timeless read that will appeal to young adults, teens, and adults. I was sent the second book in the series as well and look forward to the continuing adventures of Eve, her family and friends.\n\nEVE HALLOWS AND THE BOOK OF SHRIEKS (BOOK 1)\n\nFor fourteen-year-old Eve Hallows, life can be summed up in one word—horrible. She has the most horrible friends. She lives in a horrible old castle. Even her family is a bunch of horrible monsters.\n\nHowever, in the monster-inhabited world of Gravesville—a world where messages are sent through Ouija boards, jack-o’-lanterns get facials to suit their moods, and the worst thing Eve has to deal with are those annoying zombie tourists who overrun her favorite graveyard during the Halloween season—horrible means wonderful. And everything for Eve is perfectly horrible.\n\nBut her life is about to go head over heels when a mysterious group known as The Source starts terrorizing Gravesville. Now she must move to the human world—where everything is opposite ... and for Eve, that's absolutely adorable!\n\nPraise for Eve Hallows and the Book of Shrieks:\n\n\"Move over, Neil Gaiman’s CORALINE and THE GRAVEYARD BOOK … make room, Lemony Snicket’s A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS … you’ve got company and competition for shelf space!\" -- THE HORROR FICTION REVIEW\n\n\"WOW! What an absolutely horrible book (horrible meaning fantastic!) ... This book was laugh out loud funny. I loved when Mom accidentally turned people to stone. Dad's crazy attempts at running a pizza store were just hysterical.\" -- KIDS 'N' BOOKS\n\n\"This is the perfect book to be read aloud, read at night under the covers or simply devoured in one sitting. Robert Gray’s Eve Hallows and the Book of Shrieks simply shines with all of its fun creepiness, compelling characters and stellar writing. A MUST read for any MG fan!\" -- WORD SPELUNKING\n\n\"Eve Hallows is highly imaginative without being too complex for its target audience. Fall in love with Eve, her friends and her family of adorable monsters. Lose yourself in a light read that will remind you of those days when your English teacher just want you to read something, anything. This book is it. The one that you wish you read when you were in grade school.\" -- JOYOUS READS\n\n\"Overall, this book was fantastic. It presents an admirable role model as well as a strong family unit which will benefit young readers. When so many books right now have presented teens in a not-so-flattering light, it is so wonderful to find a book like this one.\" -- BOOK COVER JUSTICE\n\nPurchase\n\nEVE HALLOWS AND THE BOOK OF SHADOWS (BOOK 2)\n\nEver since encountering The Source and its minions on Halloween, Eve Hallows has found life surprisingly quiet … not to mention adorably boring! So when Dad receives a Ouija message that she must return to Gravesville, Eve couldn't be happier—at least until she discovers the Director of URNS, also known as the Grim Reaper, has a special job for Eve … one that will lead her to New York City and to the true identity of The Source.\n\nWith The Book of Shrieks offering zero help and a new URNS agent driving the school boys—and Eve!—crazy, Eve's beginning to realize this whole saving-the-world nonsense isn't what it's cracked up to be.\n\nAll this and she still has to find The Book of Shadows....\n\nPraise for Eve Hallows and the Book of Shadows:\n\n\"This book was perfectly horrible! Horrible meaning amazingly awesome, of course. Eve's world once again sucked me in and would not let go until this part of Eve's story was finished\" -- LILI LOST IN A BOOK\n\n\"This is a perfect combination of YA, Horror, Paranormal and Fun!\" -- BOOK LOVERS PARADISE\n\nPurchase\n\nAuthor Robert Gray\n\nRobert Gray is a writer. If that job description doesn't impress you, how about fantasy writer? Too general? Well, he doesn't get insulted if you call him a horror writer. If horror's not your thing, then scratch out horror and replace it with suspense. And for the kiddies, you can slap on a YA or MG in front of that title.\n\nGray lives in Bushkill, Pennsylvania with his wife and two children.\n\nTwitter * Facebook * Goodreads\n\nTour Giveaway\n\n$25 Amazon Gift Card or Paypal Cash\n\nEnds 12/27/12\n\nOpen to anyone who can legally enter, receive and use an Amazon.com Gift Code or Paypal Cash.
