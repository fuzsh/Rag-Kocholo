        "text": "5Winton was born in the Perth seaside suburb of Scarborough and spent most of his first twenty years in Karrinyup, “a suburb freshly carved out of thick scrub on the outskirts of Perth” (Bennett 282; Flanagan 12). However, Winton rarely writes about suburbia, choosing instead to set the overwhelming majority of his work in coastal towns and rural areas. Martin Flanagan’s description of Winton’s childhood suburb is remarkably similar to the suburb Winton describes in “Aquifer”: “The small, neatly aligned houses were erected not far from the sea in what, for Perth, is a hilly area. At the end of the street was a giant swamp; to the west, between the suburb and the sea, was the sort of bush you could lose yourself in” (12). It is clear from comparing Flanagan’s description of Winton’s childhood suburb with the description of the suburb in “Aquifer” that the story contains many autobiographical elements. Winton depicts suburbia negatively in his novel Cloudstreet and has expressed his dislike for the suburban environment in an interview with Andrew Taylor, calling it “bland” and claiming it produces “a kind of autism” (376); elsewhere, Winton states that he is not interested in writing about “people who have no real existential questions and are purely hedonistic consumers” (Qtd. in Rossiter 3). However, Winton creates a complex and powerful representation of the suburban environment in “Aquifer” which moves far beyond the stereotypes of boring, conformist, shallow suburbia that have long prevailed in Australia.\n\n8The liminal state of the suburb and its peripheral and inferior status in relation to other sites is emphasized repeatedly throughout “Aquifer”:\n\nFrom the high ground of the schoolyard you could see the city and the real suburbs in the distance. You could even smell the sea. In the afternoons the blue bush plain was hazy with smoke and the dust churned up by bulldozers … When summer came and the windows lay open all night the noise of frogs and crickets and mosquitoes pressed in as though the swamp had swelled in the dark. (40)\n\n9The narrator clearly perceives the city, sea and bush as more important than his own suburb; even other suburbs are valued as “real,” presumably because they are more established and closer to the city and the sea. The implication is that the newness and peripheral location of the narrator’s suburb are negative characteristics. Again, the natural environment continues to be destroyed in the name of suburban expansion, yet it remains an ever-present force. The haunting presence of the natural environment also plays a major role in Davison’s “Neary’s Horse.”\n\n10As a child, the narrator of “Aquifer” is intrigued by the bush adjacent to his suburban home. While suburbia represents conformity and containment, the bush is equated with possibility and danger:\n\nI grew up in a boxy double brick house with roses and a letterbox, like anyone else. My parents were always struggling to get me inside something, into shirts and shoes, inside the fence, the neighbourhood, the house, out of the sun or the rain… I sat on the fence and stared at the noisy blue bush and in time I was allowed to roam there. (39)\n\n11It is the relationship between the children of the suburb and the bush, specifically the swamp, which forms the core of Winton’s story. The children want to play in the swamp, but their parents forbid them from doing so because of perceived dangers such as “quicksand and tiger snakes, wild roots and submerged logs” (40). For the suburban parents, the natural environment is a threat to their children, and their children must be contained to ensure their safety.\n\n12Inevitably, the narrator and the other neighbourhood children disobey their parents and begin frequenting the swamp (42-43). Nature holds an irresistible attraction for the children, especially when compared with the manicured lawns of suburbia. The narrator describes the swamp as the most central and powerful site in the landscape: “Every wrinkle, every hollow in the landscape led to the hissing maze down there” (43). Once in the swamp, suburbia may as well not even exist: “From the water’s edge you couldn’t even see our street” (43). Despite nature’s undeniable attraction and power within “Aquifer,” suburbia affects it negatively in ways other than the construction of streets and houses. The swamp becomes a dumping ground for old cars, which “would just appear, driven in the back way from behind the market gardens, stripped or burned, left near the water” (45). Clearly, the children’s’ attitude towards the swamp is not shared by many adults, who view the natural environment merely as a resource to be exploited, rather than one worth preserving.\n\n13During his childhood, the narrator is constantly bullied by his neighbour Alan Mannering, the child of English immigrants. The bullying climaxes when Alan presses a sharp fence picket into the narrator’s chest, pinning him to the ground, then urinates in a circle around him while standing over him. Immediately after this act of territorialism and supremacy, Alan climbs aboard the roof of a wrecked car that he uses as a makeshift canoe. After pushing out into the water, Allan suddenly “went down, sliding sideways like a banking aircraft … He didn’t come up … After the water settled back and shook itself smooth again like hung washing, there wasn’t a movement. No sign” (46). Rather than raising the alarm, the narrator goes home and says nothing (49). Police drag the swamp but do not find Alan’s body.\n\n15Indeed, the presence of an Indigenous family in a neighbourhood comprised of recent European immigrants and the descendants of European settler/invaders emphasizes the fact that the Europeans (of all types) are recent arrivals on the continent. Winton positions the Joneses as different from the white suburbanites, not only racially, but economically. The narrator states, “Everyone was working class, even the Aborigines around the corner whose name was Jones, though it seemed that these were Joneses who didn’t need much keeping up with” (39). The fact that the Indigenous family has a European name serves as a reminder of their colonization and displacement. Additionally, the Indigenous family is represented as violent, angry and threatening:\n\n[They were] dark and loud. Even their laughter seemed angry. I never had much to do with any of them. I rode past their house careful not to provoke them. They gave my little brother a hiding once. I never knew why. His nose swelled like a turnip and he nursed this grievance for the rest of his life. It made his mind up about them, he said. (44)\n\n16Obviously, during his childhood the narrator did not understand or accept that the Joneses had a great deal to be angry about, from European colonization through to their present marginalized economic, legal and social state, and that as a representative of white society, he and his brother were natural targets. At the conclusion of “Aquifer,” the middle-aged narrator witnesses the eviction of the Joneses from their home (52); he is emotionally affected by the eviction, yet his physical response is to drive out of the suburb on his way back to Angelus. Like many non-Indigenous Australians, he decides that the plight of Indigenous Australians is not his problem.\n\n17However, witnessing the eviction triggers an epiphany, which concludes the story: “Seeing the Joneses out on the street, the only people I recognized from the old days, just confirmed what I’ve thought since Alan Mannering circled me as his own … that the past is in us, and not behind us. Things are never over” (53). Ending the story with Faulknerian references to both the Indigenous family and the deceased English immigrant, while reflecting on the relationship between the past and the present, makes it difficult for readers to ignore the fact that “Aquifer” is a postcolonial story dealing with complex intertwined issues of European settlement and immigration, Indigenous displacement, land rights and ownership, race, nationality and non-Indigenous belonging. Actions that took place in Australia’s past have consequences that are being dealt with in Australia’s present, and suburbia is often the site in which the difficult negotiations occur.\n\n18Although Winton does not usually directly address contentious issues such as Indigenous land rights in his fiction, he often does so subtly, as he does in Cloudstreet, and has made it clear in interviews that he believes “White Australia” should value Indigenous culture highly: “we live with a contradiction in Australia: one of the most anti-religious European cultures on the most spiritual and religious of continents. It’s tragic – 40,000 years of Aboriginal wisdom completely ignored” (Qtd. in Rossiter 4). Winton’s position regarding Indigenous land rights is complicated, however, by his statements regarding his sense of belonging as a non-Indigenous Australian: “I’m not embarrassed about coming from here, although I’m ashamed of the way my forebears … brought me into the country … I’m not ashamed to be here as a white Australian” (Qtd. in Rossiter 13). Winton’s position is by no means unique; in fact, it is typical of many non-Indigenous Australians who recognize and acknowledge that the continent was stolen from its original inhabitants, yet simultaneously feel a deep sense of belonging.\n\n19Despite the complexity of “Aquifer” and Winton’s engagement with interwoven issues such as Indigenous displacement, European settlement/invasion and environmental degradation, the author sometimes describes suburbia in a manner consistent with the anti-suburban tradition in Australian literature, focusing on the conformity and lack of variety. For example, there are only “three basic designs” for the houses due to “the entire suburb’s origins in the smoky, fly-buzzing office of some bored government architect” (38). Winton suggests that little effort or imagination has gone into the design of the houses, which results in an aesthetically boring environment, echoing the architect and critic Robin Boyd, author of The Australian Ugliness (1961), who viewed suburbia as an “aesthetic calamity” (Qtd. in Caterson 60). Nevertheless, “Aquifer” examines suburbia in a complex and serious manner that is rare within Australian literature and uses the suburban setting to confront some of the most controversial issues in contemporary Australian society.\n\n20The action of Davison’s “Neary’s Horse,” first published in The Best Australian Stories 1999 and reprinted in Davison’s Collected Stories (2001), takes place in an unnamed south-eastern suburb of Melbourne. “Neary’s Horse” is a shocking story about a group of children who violently chase a horse along a stormwater canal until it disappears into the network of drains beneath the suburb. The first-person narrator, telling the story retrospectively from adulthood, plays a central role in the action. Neary’s horse lives on the only undeveloped lot in a quiet suburban street; its owner is the son of the farmer who formerly owned the land occupied by the suburb. Upon his father’s death, Neary inherited the land and sold it. Neary visits once a week to feed, water and groom the horse, before returning to the city, where he lives and works.\n\n21The narrator and the other children are disturbed by the presence of the horse, which they do not think belongs in their suburb, as “There wasn’t another horse for miles” (118). Not only is the horse seemingly out of place, it serves no apparent purpose: “It stood there all day, doing nothing” (117). The children are unable to accept that the horse has no utilitarian value: “None of us knew what it was there for … It stood all year on its quarter acre, patiently enduring our torments, asking nothing and giving nothing in return” (117). The narrator explains that the presence of the horse would “have made more sense” if it were “further out,” past “the industrial estate and used car yards” (117). However, there is no acceptable explanation for the horse’s presence in suburbia and the children conclude that “things would be better with it gone” (117).\n\n22The children believe that they belong in their suburb, unlike the horse. The narrator describes the children as products of suburbia, stating, “We were born to asphalt streets with nature strips and concrete edgings. All of our houses looked the same. All of our streets ran straight. North Road. South Road. Centre Road. East Boundary Road. We knew exactly where we stood” (117). Davison’s description of the unnamed south-eastern Melbourne suburb could well be a description of almost any suburb in any Australian city by any Australian writer; like Winton in “Aquifer” (and other writers not discussed in this article, such as Peter Carey, David Malouf, Neil Boyack, George Johnston and Melissa Lucashenko), Davison focuses on the sameness, conformity and precision of suburbia, all features produced through planning. The planned suburban environment produces a strong sense of belonging for the children raised there, who are on intimate terms with it, having thoroughly explored their territory: “We rode our bikes to the church or youth club, or to the strip of shops that faced each other across Centre Road and never questioned that the place had ever been any different to how we found it” (117-118). Despite their familiarity and comfort with their suburb, and their intense sense of belonging, the children lack a sense of history and have no curiosity regarding its origins.\n\n23Moreover, new suburbs are being built just “a mile or so further out” (118), yet the children do not make the connection between the ongoing development nearby and the short history of their own suburb. The narrator admits that the children largely “focused … [their] attention the other way” (118), towards their own suburb and north-east to the city. The children understand their suburb as subordinate to the city, which their fathers depend on as the source of employment; they also realize that one day they too will travel into the city each morning (118). The narrator repeatedly emphasizes the sense of belonging that the children feel for their suburb, claiming that they “lived with the conviction that the station … [their] fathers returned to, and … [their] intimate knowledge of streets laid down in the same decade … [in which they] were born set … [them] apart from others and provided some privileged understanding of who … [they] were” (118). However, as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the children not only lack an understanding of their own nature, but are unwilling to confront that nature or admit to themselves what they have done. Thus, the suburban children are ignorant, unreflective and in denial; their attitude can be read as a metaphor for contemporary Australian attitudes towards environmental degradation, Indigenous displacement and European settlement/invasion.\n\n24Because they are products of suburbia who have not considered that there may be environments of value beyond theirs, the children turn their backs “on the open land a short bike ride in the opposite direction [from the city], little realizing that before … [they reach their] parents’ age, the flower farms and market gardens would all be gone, buried beneath a vast, unbroken crust of brick veneer and concrete that would stretch to the distant hills” (118). The environmental degradation caused by the inexorable expansion of suburbia is a common theme in the small body of Australian fiction set there. However, what is most interesting about Davison’s use of the theme is his decision to depict his narrator as being unaware of the process, at least during his childhood. Rather than being ambivalent, unconcerned or outraged about the destruction of the natural environment, Davison’s narrator-protagonist fails to even notice the process until it is complete and the landscape is smothered by bricks and concrete.\n\n25Although the natural environment has been largely destroyed through the process of constructing streets, burying a network of drains and pipes, laying house foundations and inverting the soil, the remnants of flower farms and market gardens intrude upon the suburb, reminding the residents of some of the previous uses of the land:\n\nOccasionally, people were surprised to find white tubers sprouting from their bluegrass lawns, or a line of onions pushing up beside the roses, and they thought for a moment about old Mr. Neary and what his son had done, and about the part they’d played in it themselves. They wondered at the resilience of the things he’d planted, then hacked them from the ground. (120)\n\n26Clearly, the suburban adults possess a sense of history, realizing that they are complicit in the destruction of the farms and gardens, and perhaps even feel guilty. However, by destroying the tubers and onions, the suburbanites demonstrate that maintaining a neat lawn and garden is their primary concern, and thus they privilege the concerns of the present over the actions of the past. For the suburban adults of the narrator’s childhood, controlling the natural environment takes precedence over preserving it (just as it does for the adults in Winton’s “Aquifer”) and the present trumps the past.\n\n27Before describing the central event of the story, the expulsion of the horse from the suburb, the narrator tries to excuse the terrible action: “The horse was already out when we came across it. Confined to its block, it posed no serious threat … finding it loose … made all the difference” (121). The children falsely perceive the horse as a threat to them simply because it is no longer contained. However, the horse does not roam the streets, eat anyone’s lawn or trample anyone’s rose bushes; it simply stands beside “the concrete canal eating the lush swamp dock and ribbon grass it hadn’t been able to reach before” (121). Nevertheless, the narrator’s descriptions of the horse focus on its perceived “air of proprietorial disdain” and “imposing bulk,” noting that “its flanks twitched with the excitement of being out and we could see the muscles working in its neck as it ripped great clumps of grass from the earth with each savage toss of its head” (121). The power of the horse is emphasized and exaggerated, especially through the use of language such as “ripped” and (the loaded term) “savage.” Ironically, observing the horse outside its suburban quarter-acre block causes the children to see their environment in an entirely new way. They realize that the horse “was at home exactly where it stood. It didn’t belong to another place at all, but to this place before we knew it” (121). Not only does the narrator realize that the horse is the original inhabitant of the land, that it preceded the suburbs which have imprisoned it, he also presents the horse as the keeper of knowledge and memories alien to the children: “It still saw the furrowed acres we had never known and the clumps of melaleuca extending for miles on the far side of a trickling creek” (121). Like the Indigenous peoples who formerly inhabited the land, the horse possesses knowledge of the land and a relationship with it that the suburban children lack.\n\n28Nevertheless, despite the group’s realization that the horse belongs, the children begin their brutal expulsion. One of them throws a small bottle at the horse, which shatters on the concrete, causing the horse to emit “a high-pitched scream as though the glass had found its eye, then it bolted, kicking up clods of earth with its hooves and arching its neck” (121). Immediately before describing this incident, the narrator engages in some self-conscious denial: “Memory tells me it wasn’t me who threw it but I can still feel those markings soft against my hand” (121). The brutal behaviour of the children escalates as they follow the horse along the canal bank “mimicking the noise it made with … [their] own excited screams” (121). Despite earlier excuses and denials, the narrator admits that the children “should have let it go then, should have been content with the damage … already done” (121). However, the children are thrilled by the power they hold over the horse and continue their pursuit. The horse’s path is blocked by a wire fence; it stumbles and falls “down the concrete embankment, its hooves slipping beneath it as it went until it was … at the bottom of the canal” (122). The narrator reveals that at this point someone in the group suggests letting the horse go, while another was weeping “out of fear or pity” (122). The horse moves along the canal toward the stormwater drain; the narrator describes the group following, “shouting out like … [they] were in control as … [they] drove it further from its block of land with a triumphant determination … [they] didn’t know … [they] had” (122). Like settler/invaders in the early days of colonization, the young suburbanites are intent on erasing every remnant of the previous occupants.\n\n29Once the horse arrives at the stormwater drain entrance, the children drive it into the tunnel by throwing stones (123). The horse disappears into a built environment from which it cannot escape. The children wait for hours, expecting the horse to return, and then go home silently, unable to acknowledge to each other what they have done, “for fear of what it would reveal” about themselves (123). The children’s silence in “Neary’s Horse” parallels the narrator’s silence in “Aquifer.” Neary’s horse does not return, and the children never mention the expulsion again. Before long, people forget that Neary ever had a horse, and life seems to return to normal. Neary visits the block weekly for six months, “walking along the top of the canal as though searching for some part of himself he’d lost” (123). Years pass, Neary sells the land, a house is built upon it, and the canal is enclosed. Fifteen years after the horse is forced underground, the narrator occasionally talks to childhood companions who suggest that there was a vacant block somewhere with a horse on it; however, the narrator claims to have no memory of it and the others agree, also choosing to continue repressing and denying the past and engaging in a deliberate process of forgetting.\n\n30“Neary’s Horse” can be read as an indictment of suburban attitudes and environmental degradation, and as a commentary on the brutality of human nature. However, like Winton’s “Aquifer,” it may also be interpreted as a commentary on land rights, ownership, Indigenous belonging, non-Indigenous belonging, revisionist history, forgetting, repression and denial, with the expulsion of the horse from its land symbolizing the displacement and massacre of Indigenous Australians by European settler/invaders. The guilt and denial of the narrator and his companions parallel the guilt and/or denial that many non-Indigenous Australians experience regarding the treatment of Australia’s Indigenous peoples, as indicated by Winton’s depiction of his narrator’s attitude towards the Joneses. All of Australia’s suburbs occupy land stolen from the original Indigenous owners, and thus suburbia and the displacement of Indigenous peoples are inextricably linked, a fact already discussed in reference to Winton’s “Aquifer. Davison has commented that his fiction, just like Winton’s “Aquifer,” is pervaded by “the Faulknerian notion that … [one] can’t escape the past, that the past influences the present and is not even past yet” (Probyn 61). Clearly, Davison believes that suburban development and environmental degradation cannot eradicate the history of the land and the peoples and animals that once lived there. Contemporary Australians living in suburbs must recognize and accept the fact that their quarter-acre blocks have the same shameful history as the rest of the continent. Environmental degradation and Indigenous displacement are not issues that are only relevant in the outback, the bush or coastal areas; they are central to the suburbs in which the vast majority of Australians live."
