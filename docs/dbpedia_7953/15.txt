Join us for our first installment in the Towards Suburbia seminar series with Australian planning scholar Paul Maginn, Monday April 3, at 2:30 pm in 280 N York Lanes.

The suburbs have long been portrayed as a space of conformity, domesticity, safety and security for women and children; it’s separation from the city, home ownership and the white picket fence were emblematic of a deep sense of territoriality and protection from the ills and vices of the city. Conversely, the city was framed as a space of economic activity, informality, and risk; combined with its phallic architecture the city was thus perceived as a masculine and sexualized space. This seminar reflects on the geography and regulation of the (sub)urban sexscape and the nature and degree of cosmo‐sexuality at and within the national, state, city and suburb level in Australia (and internationally) by examining the presence and consumption of commercialized forms of sex such as adult stores/sex shops, sex work and pornography.
