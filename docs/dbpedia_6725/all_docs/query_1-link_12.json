Here’s what I’ve done so far…\n\nMade sure the firmware was up to date.\n\nMade sure the content filtering was not causing this. The computer I’ve done the testing on is specifically excluded from content filtering but have also tested with the content filter turned off. I still cannot reach the website.\n\nTo exclude my switches being the issue, I configured the unused X2 port and connected the computer directly to the X2 port. Machine would connect to the internet but not the website I need.\n\nMoved the computer to the hub outside the firewall but on the same internet connection. When I did that I WAS able to connect to the website I need.\n\nI logged a call with Sonicwall support. After working with them yesterday they could not see any dropped packets. Suggested that I try on a different computer running on a higher Windows operating system (the pc I’m using is running Windows 7). I attempted to connect to the website I need on a computer running Windows 10 Pro. Could not connect to the website.\n\nSupport suggested that it has to be the browser and that I was used an outdated versions and that was the problem. I update all the browsers (IE, Chrome and Firefox) to the most recent versions and I still can’t connect to the website I need.\n\nSonicwall support is now telling me that it’s not the firewall and there is nothing further they will do for me. I don’t agree with them, I feel all the testing I’ve done is indicating that it IS the firewall.\n\nDoes anyone have any further suggestions for things I can try to resolve this problem?\n\nTry changing the external DNS servers on your firewall to ONLY Google DNS servers. ISP DNS servers are unreliable in my experience. Also, are your clients internally getting IP addresses via DHCP from the firewall? If so are they getting the same DNS servers as listed in your firewall when you don an IPCONFIG /ALL\n\nI changed the DSN servers on the firewall to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4 then flushed the cache on the firewall. Yes, our clients getting IP addresses via DHCP from the firewall.\n\nWent to my pc, did ipconfig /flushdns , ipconfig /renew and then ipconfig /all. The DNS servers now showed 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4 only.\n\nTried supplierconnect.cat.com. Got the same err_connection_timed_out error."
