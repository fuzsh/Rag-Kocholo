        "text": "What is a VPN router?\n\nA VPN router works exactly like a normal VPN. Your traffic is redirected through a VPN’s servers, allowing you to browse online completely undisturbed. All your activity will be hidden from anyone trying to spy on you, whether it’s petty thieves to data-hoarding corporations.\n\nThe reason you’d want a VPN on your router is to provide network-wide online security. Once you set up a VPN on your router, all connected devices will be granted the benefits of VPN protection. That includes devices that may normally not have the ability to utilize VPN software to its fullest, like a lot of smart home devices. Here’s a video explaining exactly how a router VPN works.\n\nHow does a VPN router work?\n\nA VPN creates an encrypted connection between a device and the internet, protecting your browsing activity from prying eyes. You can use a VPN for home network security by configuring one on your router.\n\nOnce you’ve set up a router VPN, every single device connected to your router will have its traffic sent through the encrypted tunnel. Your PC, your laptop, your home entertainment system, and even your smart IoT toaster.\n\nHow do I know if my router is VPN compatible?\n\nBefore you go further, it’s important to make sure that you have as supported router that’s compatible with a VPN. Not all routers are — for example, you can’t directly install a VPN on Starlink routers unless you have purchased a static IP upgrade from the satellite internet provider.\n\nTo find out more about compatibility, check the manual that may have come with your router. If you didn’t receive any manual, or if you’ve misplaced it, you should be able to find the information you need online. Just search for the name of your router and “VPN compatibility”.\n\nPRO TIP: If you’re buying a new router, it’s also a good idea to make sure it’s VPN compatible before you purchase it. There are plenty of excellent home VPN routers on the market.\n\nIt is worth noting that most ISP routers and modems don’t support a VPN connection. However, you can combine an ISP modem with a VPN-supported router for a VPN to work.\n\nIf you’re looking for a VPN-supported router, here are a few suggestions that will benefit both home users and SMEs:\n\nLinksys WRT 3200 ACM\n\nAsus RT-AC86U\n\nTeltonika RUTX11\n\nNetgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200\n\nHow to set up a VPN on your router\n\nThe first thing you need to do is select a VPN that supports router connections. If you want one of the fastest VPNs on the market, then NordVPN is a safe choice.\n\nNext, you’ll have to see if your router supports VPN functionality. To find out if your router can run NordVPN, check out our tutorial page and see the list of supported routers and firmware with relevant tutorials. Some routers there will also include NordVPN router setup instructions.\n\nThe specifics for NordVPN router installation will vary between brands and models, but the general steps are typically these:\n\nLog into your router. You can access your router configuration panel by entering your router’s IP address in your browser’s URL bar. If you’re a Windows 10 user and don’t know your router’s IP address, here’s how you can find it:\n\nOpen the “Start” menu, type in “Command prompt,” and click on “Open.”\n\nIn the window that opens, type in “ipconfig” and press “Enter.”\n\nYou should find your router’s IP address in the “Default gateway” line.\n\nLook for the “VPN client” tab in the advanced settings of your router. The location of this section depends on your router’s model and brand. (If there is no “VPN client” tab, it means your router is not compatible with a VPN.)\n\nFollow your VPN client’s guidelines to set up the VPN on your router.\n\nNow, make sure your connection is VPN-protected. Simply search for “what is my IP” on Google and see if your virtual location has changed.\n\nHere is a list of instructions on how to set up the NordVPN service for various router models:\n\nAsus Router\n\nAsusWRT Merlin\n\nDD-WRT\n\nGL.iNet\n\nMikroTik IKEv2\n\nNetduma\n\nOPNsense 21\n\nOpenWrt CI\n\nPadavan\n\nSabai\n\nTomato\n\npfSense 2.4.4\n\nDrayTek Vigor IKEv2\n\nEdgeRouter and Ubiquiti\n\nRouters that don’t support NordVPN\n\nStill don’t know how to install a VPN on your router?\n\nIf you’re experiencing issues and don’t know how to install a VPN, no problem. NordVPN has award-winning 24/7 live customer support in multiple languages. If these tips didn’t help you and you’re still lost, our support experts will help you find a way to put NordVPN on your router. Contact us at support@nordvpn.com, through the live chat, or other means available.\n\nVPN on your router: pros and cons\n\nPros\n\nAlways-on security and privacy\n\nWith a router VPN, you’ll always be connected to the VPN server. You’ll never forget to secure yourself because you’ll be part of the VPN protection as long as your router is working. If any of your devices initiate any automatic connections, like account balance updates for a personal finance app, they will be secured even if you’re sleeping.\n\nComprehensive home security\n\nThat always-on VPN server connection will apply to every device connected to your home router VPN. It will cover new devices you get with no additional setup, and it will even cover your guests when they visit and use your Wi-Fi. But make sure to change your Wi-Fi password regularly if you’ve shared it with many people in the past.\n\nCovers devices that don’t support VPNs\n\nThere are plenty of Wi-Fi-connected devices that don’t support VPN coverage on their own but could certainly benefit from it. Security is always essential, no matter what device you’re using.\n\nConnect more devices\n\nNordVPN allows you to connect up to 10 devices, which is already more than enough for most users. But did you know that your NordVPN-enabled router counts as only one device? If your laptop, smartphone, and desktop PC all connect over your VPN-enabled router, that’s still technically only one device connected. It’s not a good idea to abuse this feature because your connection speed and stability may suffer, but it’s an easy way to expand the number of devices your NordVPN subscription covers.\n\nCons\n\nManaging your VPN settings is harder\n\nBecause your router doesn’t have its own user interface (beyond a few simple buttons), you’ll have to access it through another device in order to adjust your VPN settings. Turning your VPN tunnel on and off or changing the country it’s connected to is much more convenient using NordVPN’s app. It’s still possible on your router, but not as convenient.\n\nConfiguration and encryption power depends on your router\n\nMost routers lack the power to run anything more than the most basic encryption or tunneling protocols. You may want to upgrade to a VPN router that supports more secure protocols or simply research what your chosen VPN protocol does and doesn’t protect you from.\n\nBlocks some incoming connections\n\nBy its very nature, a VPN is designed to block incoming unauthorized connections. You’ll have an easier time initiating connections using your laptop, computer or smartphone to get around this limitation because they have user interfaces. Your less-accessible devices, like your router, will probably remain unreachable from outside since they can’t initiate connections. This doesn’t apply to automated processes on user devices, however – your computer will still receive emails and notifications.\n\nTraffic between devices and the router is not secured\n\nBecause encryption occurs on the router, traffic between the device and the router will not yet be encrypted. If you have a secure home WiFi setup and your mobile devices aren’t set to auto-connect to other networks, this shouldn’t be a huge issue. This only becomes a serious security issue if random strangers are capable of connecting to your network.\n\nOnline security starts with a click.\n\nStay safe with the world’s leading VPN\n\nDifferent types of VPN routers\n\nRouters that support a VPN client.\n\nRouters that need upgrading their firmware in order to install a VPN client.\n\nRouters that already come with a certain VPN service pre-installed.\n\nVPN router boxes designed to connect to your router.\n\nAs you can see, there are different types of VPN routers, and they all have pros and cons. Having a VPN service pre-installed is the easiest way to secure your network, as you don’t need to do any additional configuration. But if you need to upgrade your firmware to use a VPN, it takes more time and requires some technical skills.\n\nIf your router supports a VPN client, it doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes to set up a VPN.\n\nTips for using your VPN router\n\nAvoid unnecessary double coverage\n\nWith NordVPN working on your router and out of sight, you may forget it’s switched on. If you use NordVPN on another device while at home, your NordVPN encrypted tunnel will still be sent through the encrypted tunnel set up on your router. This can be a powerful and useful feature when using our Double VPN setting, but NordVPN was not designed to function this way through your VPN router. To avoid significant speed reductions or instability, use one method or another to connect to NordVPN’s servers.\n\nBookmark your router settings page\n\nConnecting to your router to change the settings might be inconvenient, but you can bookmark the address to make this part just a bit easier.\n\nTo avoid double coverage, set up a separate router\n\nMost Android devices that you carry with you throughout the day (phones, laptops, and tablets) will be able to support a VPN app for Android. This will keep you safe while outside the house, but if you forget to switch the app off in your home, the two overlapping VPN connections can cause a drop in internet speed.\n\nIf you have two routers, you can connect your phone or tablet to the one that isn’t configured with a VPN. Meanwhile, any devices that don’t support a VPN app (some smart TVs and gaming consoles, for example) can run on your VPN router. All your hardware will be protected, without risking any reduction in speed.\n\nCheck out these NordVPN reviews to find out more about the NordVPN experience.
