SonicWALL is comprised of several tools, including the Content Filtering Service, or CFS. The CFS lets you block a user's IP address, which effectively prevents the user from accessing your network or server.\n\n1.\n\nSelect “SonicWALL” from the options listed in the “Content Filter Type” menu. This gives you access to the SonicWALL CFS firewall. A list of configurable networks is displayed. If your small business only has one network, only one will be displayed.\n\n2.\n\nClick the network you’d like to block the user from accessing.\n\n3.\n\nClick the button labeled “Configure.” The “SonicWALL Filter Properties” window pops up.\n\n4.\n\nClick the check box labeled “Block Traffic to All Web Sites.”\n\n5.\n\nClick the “Add” button in the “Filtered IP Address” section of the \"SonicWALL Filter Properties\" window.\n\n6.\n\nInput the IP address of the user you’d like to block. You may need to obtain this IP address from your network administrator. It will be a four-part number laid out in the following format: AAA.BBB.C.D. Click the “OK” button once you’ve entered the IP address.\n\n7.\n\nClick “Apply” in the \"SonicWALL Filter Properties\" pop-up dialog to block the user.\n\nReferences\n\nTips\n\nRepeat this process to block additional users. SonicWALL lets you block up to 128 unique IP addresses.\n\nWriter Bio\n\nAndrew Tennyson has been writing about culture, technology, health and a variety of other subjects since 2003.
