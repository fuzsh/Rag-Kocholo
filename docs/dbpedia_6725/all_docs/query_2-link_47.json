I need to manage this address in my FortiGate. Additionally, the ISP has assigned me an IP in the DMZ, 192.168.10.254, which I've placed on my WAN interface in my FortiGate. All the necessary settings have been configured for this interface. On the SonicWall, I've created the VPN connection to the public address, 10.1.1.1/32, as my destination.\n\nWhen I check the FortiGate, the IPsec section shows traffic both on the outside and inside, but when I review the SonicWall, the site-to-site VPN doesn't establish a connection. In the SonicWall logs, I see the following message:\n\nMESSAGE SOURCE DESTINATION IP PROTOCOL\n\n953 VPN Payload Processing Error Warning IKEv2 Payload processing error 10.1.1.1, 500 10.2.2.2, 500 udp\n\n974 VPN Initiator: Received IKE_AUTH Response Inform IKEv2 Initiator: Received IKE_AUTH response 10.1.1.1, 500 10.2.2.2, 500 udp\n\n959 VPN Unable to Find IKE SA Warning IKEv2 Unable to find IKE SA 10.1.1.1, 500 10.2.2.2, 500 udp\n\n940 VPN Initiator: Send IKE_AUTH Request Inform IKEv2 Initiator: Send IKE_AUTH Request 10.2.2.2, 500 10.1.1.1, 500 udp\n\n943 VPN Accept IKE SA Proposal Inform IKEv2 Accept IKE SA Proposal 10.1.1.1, 500 10.2.2.2, 500 udp\n\n973 VPN Initiator: Received IKE_SA_INT Response Inform IKEv2 Initiator: Received IKE_SA_INT response 10.1.1.1, 500 10.2.2.2, 500 udp\n\n938 VPN Initiator: Send IKE_SA_INIT Request Inform IKEv2 Initiator: Send IKE_SA_INIT Request 10.2.2.2, 500 10.1.1.1, 500 udp\n\n1052 VPN VPN Policy Modified Inform VPN policy CENTRAL is modified.\n\ni appreciate a helping hand."
