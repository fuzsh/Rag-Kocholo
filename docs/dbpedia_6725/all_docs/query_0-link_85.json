I continually get alerts that a threat is hitting both my rokus.\n\nI phoned my wifi carrier and the tech said she'd have to advance my request to a technician and gave me a ticket #. He called back and it sounded like he was researching this threat. (I don't have this threat attacking any other wifi-enabled devices -- only roku).\n\nHe said to contact roku as it's something related to their device as it doesn't affect others. (My wifi has been blocking this; but it's increasing at attempts).\n\nJust finished a chat with Shree on roku. She said to contact wifi carrier (why does everyone point the finger at someone else?) I was surprised I couldn't find this threat via a search.\n\nAnyone else? If so, what did you do?\n\nThanks much!\n\nCan't seem to post a pic here of the detailed message."
