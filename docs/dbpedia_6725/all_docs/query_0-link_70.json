        "text": "Cybersecurity is set to dominate the spotlight at the 14th annual UK Managed Services Summit (MSS) this September in London.\n\nWith GFI Software as the Headline Sponsor, this year’s theme, \"Transformation, Innovation, and Differentiation,\" zeroes in on pivotal topics like cybersecurity, talent management, and sustainable IT services. Leading the charge in cybersecurity discussions, SonicWall, Blackfog, and Sophos will deliver compelling presentations that highlight the critical importance of cybersecurity.\n\nPeople, Process and Technology\n\nIn his presentation \"Leadership and Cybersecurity for MSPs,\" Michael E Crean of SonicWall addresses the overwhelming complexity of the ever-changing threat landscape, filled with numerous acronyms and countless security offerings. He emphasizes that true cybersecurity success for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) lies in the integrated approach of People, Process, and Technology. By learning from past experiences and focusing on foundational practices such as Patch Management, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), MSPs can effectively combat the latest cyber threats.\n\nMSPs as a target\n\nIn the presentation \"Innovative Technologies: An MSP's Defense Against Cybercrime,\" Dr. Darren Williams and Matt Scotney-Jones of BlackFog emphasize the growing threat cybercriminals pose to Managed Service Providers. With cyberattacks increasingly targeting MSPs to access their clients' portfolios, it is crucial for these providers to adopt the latest technologies to secure both their own and their clients' IT infrastructures. Traditional defenses are insufficient in protecting valuable data, as 92% of attacks involve data exfiltration and extortion is at an all-time high. Innovative solutions like anti-data exfiltration (ADX) are now essential for an effective cybersecurity strategy, highlighting the importance of integrating new technologies to combat these evolving threats\n\nCyber insurance challenges\n\nIn the presentation \"Compliance, Insurance, and AI – The Latest Wave of Conversations Driving Cybersecurity Services,\" Kyle Torres of Sophos explores the critical discussions shaping the cybersecurity landscape. Focusing on the integration of compliance, cyber insurance, and generative AI, Torres addresses the questions and concerns of end users. The session provides insights into how these elements are influencing the market for cybersecurity services and offers guidance on navigating and leveraging these trends to effectively sell and implement cybersecurity solutions.\n\n“The UK Managed Services Summit is a pivotal event for the industry,” says IT Europa Editorial Director. “With cybersecurity as a major focus this year, the high-level presentations will provide invaluable insights into advanced security technologies and practices essential for protecting data in today’s digital landscape.”\n\nAttendees are also in for a treat with three insightful panel discussions, two powerful keynotes, and numerous networking opportunities, all backed by sponsorship from top industry players."
