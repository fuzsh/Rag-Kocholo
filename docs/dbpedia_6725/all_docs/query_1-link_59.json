        "text": "Earlier I stumbled across a hidden set of features and settings in a TZ215 by going to /diag.html and figured I'd share this with everyone in case you were unaware of it as I was. It appears to be available in all of the TZ series devices, the SOHO, and likely others. On the main page, you will see the following disclaimer.\n\nUnder Internal Settings, there are quite a few settings and options. Some are more useful than others. For me, the option I needed was “Disable Port Scan Detection” under the Firewall section. Below is a rough list of some of the options. Keep in mind these options are undocumented, unsupported, and it is suggested to only make changes to these values if instructed by Dell Technical Support.
