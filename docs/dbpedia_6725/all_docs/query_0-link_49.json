        "text": "Announcement\n\nDue to falling demand, we have decided to discontinue the sale of Autodoc licenses after many successful years. From September 30, 2024, licenses can no longer be purchased (end-of-sale). Since an Autodoc license contains updates for one year, we will support new firewall firmware versions until 30 September 2025. Support will also be discontinued from September 30, 2025 (end-of-support).\n\nPurchased licenses can also be used beyond the end-of-support date. However, there will then no longer be any new versions.\n\nAutodoc is the world's leading software to create detailed firewall configuration reports automatically, just by opening a WatchGuard, Fortinet, Sonicwall or Palo Alto Networks configuration file. The reports are displayed on the screen and can be printed or exported to HTML.\n\nAutodoc saves time\n\nYou need a detailed documentation of your firewall configuration?\n\nWould you like to audit your firewall?\n\nYou want to set up a new firewall based on the configuration of the old firewall?\n\nSuch tasks usually involve a lot of work. It is almost impossible for the firewall administrator to create accurate documentation. He rarely has the necessary detailed knowledge of the system. In addition, the manually created documentation has to be adapted again and again when the configuration changes. Autodoc supports you in such tasks by automatically generating a detailed report from a configuration file at the push of a button.\n\nFunctions\n\nview_module\n\nShows configuration as table\n\nThanks to Autodoc's tabular display, you can quickly check firewall settings without having to search the configuration file for individual values.\n\nget_app\n\nSave configuration as report\n\nAutodoc allows you to save the report as HTML or PDF.\n\nedit\n\nCustom layout\n\nThe title page as well as the header and footer of the report can be supplemented with self-defined texts such as the company name.\n\nExample reports\n\nThe following examples each show you a report of the corresponding firewall manufacturer as a PDF file.\n\nWith the demo version, you can also create a free report with your own configuration.\n\nCustomer feedback\n\n«We use Autodoc to make the complex configuration files from Watchguard and Fortinet firewalls human readable. It is perfect for change control and compliancy reports.»\n\nJohn Labza, Firewall Systems, Australia\n\n«Practical and easy software to clearly document the configuration of the firewall.»\n\nBent Rathmann Jensen, Citoxlab Scantox, Denmark"
