        "text": "I work for an elementary school, where we use a SonicWall for a firewall and content filtering solution.<br><br>I was checking something online today, and got blocked trying to go to my personal website. What the fuck!?!?! There's nothing illegal, inappropriate, or offensive on it... Nor is there anything relating to alcohol or drugs. (All of which are common categories for blocking.)<br><br>See for yourself.<br> <br> <br>So my questions are these:<br><br>How can I figure out why my site was blocked in the first place? (ie What \"bad category\" does it fall under?)<br>How should I go about contacting SonicWall and setting them straight?<br> <br> <br>I've manually specified my domain as \"trusted\", but I want it off that block list. -- View image here: http://arstechnica.infopop.net/infopop/emoticons/icon_mad.gif --\n\nThe word \"Boos\" might be what triggered the site to be blocked.<BR><BR>I would highly doubt a large-ish company is going to listen to ONE customer.<BR><BR>I've known people who had to add the website for the PGA golf tour to the manually allowed domains because it was blocked. Go figure.\n\nThey actually MapQuest blocked for at least a month or so. So I know that they do go back change things.<BR> <BR> <BR><B>mil.420</B>: You mentioned my D&D link... That works fine (read: isn't blocked), as does the first ten Google results for Harry Potter.<BR><BR>I'm skeptical that SonicWall blocks based on a site's links. If a site does link to something \"bad\", that destination should be filtered anyway.\n\nFrom SonicWall's KB:<BR><BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Sites that are being blocked by the Content Filter, and should not be, are hosted on shared webservers with the same IP address. Since the Content Filtering list blocks objectionable sites by either domain or IP address, a site that should not be blocked can be accidentally blocked by the list. To circumvent this, you can add the website that you want to reach to your trusted domains list. If you feel that the URL should be removed from the Content Filter List, please contact CyberPatrol. SonicWALL has no control over the contents of the Content Filter List licensed from CyberPatrol.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>I'm off to contact CyberPatrol now...\n\nWhat bubba_nuts said. Firewalls blocking questionable Web sites do so by blocking specific IP addresses from a blacklist maintained by NetNanny or CyberPatrol or some such place. Firewalls are layer 3 and 4 devices, and are unable to block sites based on keywords or content. You'd need an HTTP proxy for that.<BR><BR>There are many co-hosted Web sites out there: multiple sites hosted on a single Web server having the same IP address, and server using HTTP headers to determine which of the sites is the Web surfer trying to get to. So if one site on that server gets blacklisted they all get blocked.\n\nI sent off a nice email to CyberPatrol. Hopefully they'll get back to me and at least tell me what's up.<BR><BR>Is it technically feasible for my domain name to be unblocked, but not my web server's IP address? It would seem to be, since I can add make my domain \"trusted\", right?\n\nGot this reply today...<BR><BR><pre class=\"ip-ubbcode-code-pre\">Hello Brian,\n\nThe site that you submitted is not on the CyberNOT list, however, it does\n\nshare its IP with sites that are.\n\nBecause the IP that you share has over 2,100 Adult sites on it, we have\n\ncategorized this IP as Adult. However, anyone using our product, or\n\nSonicWall's product can add sites in to be allowed on their end.\n\nYou may want to contact your hosting provider and ask that your site be\n\nmoved to an IP without any adult content on it.\n\nThank you,\n\nContent Services</pre><BR><BR>They were nice enough to respond, I'll certainly give them that. But I still think that they can allow my domain without unblocking the IP address. How else does the \"trusted list\" work?\n\nAs I already explained:<BR><BR>IP address of some porn site is 1.2.3.4.<BR><BR>The IP address 1.2.3.4 gets blocked.<BR><BR>Your site is hosted on the same server as the porn site, your IP is also 1.2.3.4.<BR><BR>Your site is also blocked.<BR><BR>No, they can't unblock your site and keep the porn site blocked. SonicWall content filtering relies on a database of blacklisted IP addresses, NOT domain names or keywords."
