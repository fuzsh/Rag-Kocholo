        "text": "Hey,\n\nThought I'd leave this tip here for someone who might need it.\n\nNon of our school's iPads were updating or connecting to the update servers at Apple. I felt like it was a ports problem, but changing those didn't work. I thought it was an app control problem, but that didn't work. Eventually I added *.apple.com to the \"Allowed List\" on the content filtering service of my Sonicwall. This solved all my problems.\n\nHope it helps someone else."
