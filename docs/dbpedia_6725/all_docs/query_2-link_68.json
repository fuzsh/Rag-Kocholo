They help control network traffic, monitor and report on unauthorized access, and block malicious traffic from entering the network. The syslog data generated from firewalls can give you actionable insights on how to mitigate potential network threats.\n\nEventLog Analyzer provides out-of-the-box support for SonicWall firewalls in addition to with other firewall devices. It analyzes, monitors, and manages all firewall log data, making the auditing process much easier. Other benefits of auditing SonicWall firewalls with EventLog Analyzer include:\n\nA user-friendly interface with an intuitive dashboard.\n\nOver 60 out-of-the-box reports for SonicWall firewalls that aid in security and compliance auditing.\n\nEasily customizable report templates to meet internal policy needs.\n\nCustom compliance reports to help you comply with regulations like the GDPR.\n\nReal-time email and SMS alerts on configuration changes and events of interest.\n\nPowerful log forensic analysis with a high-speed log search engine that uses various search algorithms, including Boolean, range, wild card, group searches, and more.\n\nEventLog Analyzer helps monitor SonicWall audit logs and provides simple, predefined audit reports with in-depth information about SonicWall devices. These reports are also presented as intuitive graphs and charts for improved data visualization.\n\nEventLog Analyzer's SonicWall reports fall under the following categories:\n\nSecurity\n\nThese reports give insights into security threats such as SYN flood and routing table attacks, connections that have been denied, and details on critical attacks. These security insights help prevent or mitigate potential attacks on the network. Read more.\n\nUser auditing and management\n\nThese reports track all firewall activities such as the deletion or addition of users, changes in privilege levels, and successful and failed user logons. Monitoring firewall activities helps manage and audit both user and firewall administrator accounts. Read more.\n\nTraffic monitoring\n\nThese reports give you an overview of the traffic in and out of your organization’s network, including website traffic. Traffic monitoring reports can also be sorted based on source, destination, port, and protocol to identify patterns. Read more.\n\nSecurity policies and rules monitoring\n\nThese reports track changes made to firewall rules and network policies, which can help with periodic policy cleanup. They also help monitor all access points, security events based on severity (emergency, alert, error, and warning events), and system events (clock updates, removed and inserted PC cards, and status of log space). Read more.\n\nYou can get instant notifications for any critical event via SMS or email by configuring predefined alert profiles, or build custom alert profiles by defining criteria that fit your needs. Log data is automatically archived for forensic analysis, helping your organization meet regulatory compliance standards.
