If you want it to change on it’s own from https:\\publicIP\\ to https:\\publicIP\\test\\test.html you need to set a fowarder in IIS or whatever webservicer you are using.\n\nBut if I try to access the url from a web browser using public IP - https:\\publicIP\\test\\test.html (this is Firewall’s public IP)\n\nHow would a browser will know where to redirect? as for Sonicwall it can only translate public to private IP (unless I am missing that it is capable of translating to that private IP even if I try the url)\n\nThe webserver has to tell it.\n\nThe sonicwall only opens or closes connections.\n\nFor what a connection is doing after that, that is up to the service behind it.\n\nIf you’re accessing https:\\\\test\\test.html from the outside, you would do so by entering it as https:\\publicIP\\test\\test.html in the browser, as long as the firewall rule and NAT rule have been set up right, which the public server wizard pretty much does for you. Once you’ve done that, any web page redirecting should behave the same way whether you’re in or out.\n\nWhere you MIGHT have an issue is if you’re trying to host a web server on ports 80 & 443, and these also happen to be the default ports on the sonicwall’s web interface. So, you may need to change the admin ports on the sonicwall to something else to remove the conflict."
