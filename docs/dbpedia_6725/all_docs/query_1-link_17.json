        "text": "This document provides the steps required to configure the Sonicwall Inspector.\n\n👍\n\nQuick Details\n\nRecommended Agent: Self-Managed\n\nSupported Agents: Self-Managed\n\nIs Auto-Discovered By: Network Discovery Inspector\n\nCan Auto-Discover: N/A\n\nParent/Child Type Inspector: No\n\nInspection via: SSH (6.x) or API (7.x)\n\nData Summary: Here\n\nOverview\n\nSee it in Action\n\n🚧\n\nSonicWall Version Support\n\nWhile our SonicWall Inspector will work with firmware versions older than 6.5.4.9, version 6.5.4.9 is the only version fully supported by SonicWall, and therefore, the only version fully supported by Liongard. For best results, update your SonicWall devices to version 6.5.4.9.\n\nAdditionally, Liongard is able to support NSv SonicWall OSX 7 (NSv) devices.\n\nSonicWall Inspector Deployment\n\nThe setup steps for the SonicWall Inspector vary depending on the firmware version installed on the device.\n\nDeploying a SonicWall Inspector for Firmware Version 7.x\n\nDeploying a SonicWall Inspector for Firmware Version 6.x\n\nDeploying a SonicWall Inspector for Firmware Version 7.x\n\nDeployment Methods\n\nThere are three deployment methods for setting up a SonicWall Inspector in Liongard:\n\nDeployment using an On-Premises Agent\n\nDeployment using a Self-Hosted Agent\n\nDeployment via Auto-Discovery\n\nIf you would like to roll out the SonicWall Inspector through an On-Premises Agent, you must first install the Windows Agent on a server within the network residing behind the firewall of the SonicWall device.\n\nIf you would like to roll out the SonicWall Inspector through a Self-Hosted Agent, you must first install the Self-Hosted Agent in your data center.\n\nIf you would like to roll out the SonicWall Inspector with auto-discovery, you must first deploy a Network Discovery Inspector\n\nDeployment using an On-Premises Agent or Self-Hosted Agent\n\nInspector Setup Preparation\n\n🚧\n\nDisabling the User Login Status Pop-up\n\nTo disable the user login status pop-up, follow SonicWall's documentation.\n\nStep 1: Create API User Account and Assign Group Membership\n\nNavigate to Device > Users > Local Users & Groups and select Add User\n\nComplete the Name, Password, and Confirm Password fields\n\nSelect the Groups tab\n\nAdd the user account to the Everyone, SonicWALL Administrators, and Trusted Users Groups. For least privileges, you may be able to use the Read Only Administrator group, but this may not work on all firmware versions.\n\nNavigate to Device > Users > Local Users & Groups > Local Groups.\n\nEdit the SonicWall Administrators Group and navigate to the Administration tab.\n\nEnable the Members go straight to the management UI on web login option and click Save.\n\nStep 2: Enable API\n\nNavigate to Device > Administration > Audit/SonicOS API, scroll down to SonicOS API, and enable SonicOS API and RFC-2617 HTTP Basic Access authentication. Click Accept.\n\nNote: If the toggles shown are disabled, a reboot is required to enable them.\n\nStep 3: Ensure HTTPS management is enabled on the interface that the Agent will connect to the SonicWall to\n\nLiongard Inspector Setup\n\n❗️\n\nInspector Version\n\nWhen deploying a SonicWall running Firmware 7.x or higher, it is important to select the correct Inspector version as listed in the setup below. If the incorrect Inspector version is selected, the SonicWall Inspector will fail to complete.\n\nIn Liongard, navigate to Admin > Inspectors > Inspector Types > Navigate to the SonicWall Inspector > Select Add System.\n\nFill in the following information:\n\nEnvironment: Select the Environment this System should be associated with\n\nFriendly Name: Suggested \"[Environment Name] SonicWall\"\n\nAgent: Select the On-premises or Self-Hosted Agent installed for this Environment\n\nInspector Version: 7.0.0-XXX...\n\nUsername: Liongard service credentials created in the Inspector Setup Preparation above\n\nPassword: Liongard service credentials created in the Inspector Setup Preparation above\n\nIP/Hostname: Hostname or IP address of the SonicWall appliance\n\nHTTPS Management Port: HTTPS Port\n\nSchedule: The Inspector will default to run once a day at the time the Inspector is set up. Here you can adjust the schedule\n\nSelect Save. The Inspector will now be triggered to run within the minute.\n\nDeployment via Auto-Discovery\n\nIf you have set up a Network Discovery Inspector, it will auto-discover your SonicWall Inspectors. After completing the Inspector Setup Preparation steps above, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to Admin > Inspectors > Select SonicWall Inspector > Select the Discovered Systems tab\n\nHere you can Activate your Discovered SonicWall Inspector(s):\n\nIndividually select the three dots Action menu to the left of the Discovered SonicWall Inspector(s)\n\nEdit the SonicWall Inspector(s) to include the following credentials gathered in the Inspector Setup Preparation\n\nUsername: Liongard service credentials created in the Inspector Setup Preparation\n\nPassword: Liongard service credentials created in the Inspector Setup Preparation\n\nInspector Version: 7.0.0-XXX...\n\nSave the Inspector(s)\n\nSelect the checkbox to the left of the Inspector(s) that you would like to Activate\n\nSelect the Actions drop-down menu above the Discovered Systems table\n\nSelect Activate Launchpoints\n\nDeploying a SonicWall Inspector for Firmware Version 6.x\n\nDeployment Methods\n\nThere are three methods for setting up a SonicWall Inspector in Liongard:\n\nDeployment using an On-Premises Agent\n\nDeployment using a Self-Hosted Agent\n\nDeployment via Auto-Discovery\n\nIf you would like to roll out the SonicWall Inspector through an On-Premises Agent, you must first install the Windows Agent on a server within the network residing behind the firewall of the SonicWall device.\n\nIf you would like to roll out the SonicWall Inspector through a Self-Hosted Agent, you must first install the Self-Hosted Agent in your data center.\n\nIf you would like to roll out the SonicWall Inspector through Auto-discovery, you must first deploy a Network Discovery Inspector\n\n🚧\n\nRemotely Inspect SonicWall through A VPN Tunnel\n\nLiongard can inspect a SonicWall using an Agent at a different location if you have persistent site-to-site tunnels set up.\n\nIf you need to allow your SonicWall device's SSH management interface over a VPN tunnel, please review SonicWall's Documentation to learn more.\n\nDeployment using an On-Premises Agent\n\n❗️\n\nLiongard Agent Version\n\nThe SonicWall Inspector requires an Agent using version 3.2.1 or newer. If you are experiencing failures, ensure your Agents are upgraded. For more information, review our documentation.\n\nInspector Setup Preparation\n\nYou'll need to configure the SonicWall device to communicate with the Liongard On-premises Agent. Follow the steps below:\n\nStep 1: Create new Host Address Objects for LAN zone\n\n❗️\n\nLocation of Address Objects\n\nSome versions of the SonicWall firmware place address objects under the Objects menu and not the Network menu\n\nNavigate to Network > Address Objects\n\nSelect Custom\n\nClick ADD\n\nCreate Address Object using the following information:\n\nZone should be LAN/LAN for the Liongard On-premises Agent\n\nType should be Host\n\nLiongard Agent (IP Address) - x.x.x.x/255.255.255.255 (where x.x.x.x is the network address of the server where the Windows Agent has been installed)\n\nStep 2: Create Liongard Address Group\n\nNavigate to Network > Address Objects > Address Groups\n\nAdd Group > Suggested name “Liongard Monitor Group”\n\nAdd the Liongard network object\n\nClick Save\n\nStep 3: Enable SSH Management on Internal Interface\n\nClick Interfaces > Configure LAN\n\nCheck SSH Management\n\nClick OK\n\nStep 4: Enable SSH Access on LAN\n\n❗️\n\nLocation of Access Rules\n\nSome versions of the SonicWall firmware place Access Rules under the Rules menu and not the Firewall menu\n\nClick Firewall > Access Rules > Grid View > LAN to LAN\n\nUnder Configure column > Click Edit/Pencil for SSH Management\n\nChange Source to \"Liongard Group\" from above\n\nStep 5: Create a Naming Convention for the Liongard Service Account (e.g. liongard.svc)\n\n📘\n\nNaming Convention\n\nPlease refer to your organization's naming convention policies when creating usernames. Usernames we state in the documentation are suggestions only.\n\nClick Users > Local Users > Add User\n\nUser name: liongard.svc\n\nCreate password\n\nComment: Liongard Service\n\nGo to Groups tab\n\nAdd SonicWall Administrators\n\nClick OK\n\n🚧\n\nSSH Password Complexity Requirements\n\nPlease note that SonicWall has different password complexity requirements for SSH access than it does for the web UI. These requirements can vary between versions of the firmware.\n\nMore information can be found in SonicWall's documentation.\n\n🚧\n\nSonicWall Password Supported Characters\n\nPlease note that SonicWall does not support certain characters in system passwords, which may cause authentication issues between Liongard and SonicWall if you attempt to use an unsupported character.\n\nMore information can be found in SonicWall's documentation.\n\nLiongard Inspector Setup\n\nIn Liongard, navigate to Admin > Inspectors > Inspector Types > Navigate to the SonicWall Inspector > Select Add System.\n\nFill in the following information:\n\nEnvironment: Select the Environment this System should be associated to\n\nFriendly Name: Suggested \"[Environment Name] SonicWall\"\n\nAgent: Select the On-premises Agent installed for this Environment\n\nInspector Version: Latest\n\nSSH Username: Liongard service credentials created in the Inspector Setup Preparation above\n\nSSH Password: Liongard service credentials created in the Inspector Setup Preparation above\n\nIP/Hostname: Hostname or IP address of the SonicWall appliance\n\nSSH Port: SSH Port\n\nEnable Detailed Output: Toggling this on will run the show current-config, show tsr all, and show tech-support-report commands during the inspection. There is a risk of performance degradation to your SonicWall device if you enable these commands.\n\nSchedule: The Inspector will default to run once a day at the time the Inspector is set up. Here you can adjust the schedule\n\nSelect Save. The Inspector will now be triggered to run within the minute.\n\nDeployment using a Self-Hosted Agent\n\nInspector Setup Preparation\n\nYou'll need to configure the SonicWall device to communicate with the Liongard Self-Hosted Agent. Follow steps below:\n\nStep 1: Create New Host Address Objects for WAN Zone\n\nGo to Network > Address Objects\n\n2, Select Custom\n\nClick ADD\n\nCreate address object using the information below:\n\nZone should be WAN if the Liongard Self-Hosted Agent is being used.\n\nType should be Host\n\nLiongard Agent x.x.x.x/255.255.255.255 (where x.x.x.x is the IP Address of the Agent you wish to run the inspection through)\n\nStep 2: Create Address Group Liongard Group\n\nNavigate to Network > Address Objects > Address Groups\n\nAdd Group > Name “Liongard Monitor Group”\n\nAdd the Liongard network object\n\nClick Save\n\nStep 3: Enable SSH Management on Internal Interface\n\nClick Interfaces > Configure WAN\n\nCheck SSH Management\n\nClick OK\n\nStep 4: Enable SSH Access on WAN\n\nClick Firewall > Access Rules > Grid View > WAN to WAN > Under Configure column click Edit/Pencil for SSH Management\n\nChange Source to \"Liongard Group\"\n\n❗️\n\nVerify SSH Security Access\n\nBy default, SonicWall opens up the SSH port from any IP on the WAN interface. Make certain to verify the steps from \"Enable SSH Access on WAN\".\n\nVerify the WAN to WAN access group for SSH has been locked down to Liongard and any other needs for your organization\n\nStep 5: Create a Naming Convention for the Liongard Service Account (e.g. liongard.svc)\n\n📘\n\nNaming Convention\n\nPlease refer to your organization's naming convention policies when creating usernames. Usernames we state in the documentation are suggestions only.\n\nClick Users > Local Users\n\nClick Add User\n\nSuggested Username: liongard.svc\n\nCreate password\n\nComment: Liongard Service\n\nGo to Groups tab, add SonicWall Administrators\n\nClick OK\n\nLiongard Inspector Setup\n\nIn Liongard, navigate to Admin > Inspectors > Inspector Types > Navigate to the SonicWall Inspector > Select Add System.\n\nFill in the following information:\n\nEnvironment: Select the Environment this System should be associated to\n\nFriendly Name: Suggested \"SonicWall [Environment Name]\"\n\nAgent: Select the Self-Hosted Agent\n\nInspector Version: Latest\n\nSSH Username: Liongard service credentials created in the Inspector Setup Preparation above\n\nSSH Password: Liongard service credentials created in the Inspector Setup Preparation above\n\nIP/Hostname: Hostname or IP address of the SonicWall appliance\n\nSSH Port: SSH Port\n\nEnable Detailed Output: Toggling this on will run the show current-config, show tsr all, and show tech-support-report commands during the inspection. There is a risk of performance degradation to your SonicWall device if you enable these commands.\n\nScheduling: The Inspector will default to run once a day at the time the Inspector is set up. Here you can adjust the schedule\n\nSelect Save.
