OneDrive-hosted C2 server communications have also been conducted through the Graph API by the Grager trojan in intrusions aimed at three organizations in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Hong Kong, while another South Asian media organization was subjected to an attack with the GoGra backdoor that exploited Graph API to enable Outlook-based C2 interactions.\n\nResearchers also discovered a Google Drive exfiltration tool leveraged by the Firefly threat operation in an attack against a South East Asian military entity, as well as various MoonTag trojan variants that are under development. Such a development was noted by experts to emphasize the importance of proactively defending cloud environments."
