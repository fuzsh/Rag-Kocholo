        "text": "Introduction\n\nAt times, administrators may want to block a specific website from being accessed by any user behind their firewall. In this article, we demonstrate how to block everyone from the Gmail website using the firewall access rules.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nSonicOS 5.8.0.2 or greater\n\nOne of the following SonicWALL Security Appliance Platforms:\n\nTZ 215\n\nNSA 220\n\nNSA 240\n\nNSA 250M\n\nNSA 2400\n\nNSA 3500\n\nNSA 3600\n\nNSA 4500\n\nNSA 4600\n\nNSA E5500\n\nNSA 5600\n\nNSA E6500\n\nNSA 6600\n\nNSA E7500\n\nNSA E8500\n\nNSA E8510\n\nComponents Used\n\nThe information in this document is based on the SonicOS 5.8.1.\n\nThe information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.\n\nConfigure the Firewall\n\nIn this section, you are presented with the information to configure the Firewall to block everyone from the Gmail website using the firewall access rules.\n\nAbout Access Rules\n\nAccess Rules are what traditionally define a firewall. SonicWall Access Rules are similar to Access Control Lists that are seen in other vendors’ firewalls, but with added functionality.\n\nHow Access Rules Are Used\n\nAccess Rules are used to Allow/Deny/Drop network packets between the SonicWall Firewall Zones. Access Rules only look at the network packet header in order to determine whether to Allow/Deny/Drop the network packet. The packet header contains the following information:\n\nSource IP\n\nDestination IP\n\nSource Port\n\nDestination Port\n\nService\n\nHow Access Rules Work\n\nThe firewall uses the first policy that that the packet matches. Order is very important. Place rules in this order: most permissive first and most restrictive last, with last rule denying everything. This order will allow you to restrict what traffic will be going through the firewall.\n\nWarning About Access Rules\n\nFor Next Generation Firewalls, Access Rules are NOT the recommended method of writing application firewall rules. This is because Access Rules only look at the header of the packet and not the payload of the packet. Next Generation firewalls use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to look at the header AND the payload of the packet in order to more securely scan the packet. Therefore, using Application Control and Application Firewall Rules is the preferred method of writing firewall rules in SonicWall Firewalls.\n\nConfiguration Stages\n\nThere are two stages to this configuration process:\n\nStage I – Create Address Object\n\nStage II – Create Access Rule\n\nOther items included in this article:\n\nHow to Test\n\nHow to Troubleshoot\n\nRelated Resources\n\nStage I – Create Address Object\n\nComplete these steps in the SonicWall GUI in order to create an address object for the Gmail website. The Gmail website actually has the URL of mail.google.com, so we need to create an address object for mail.google.com.\n\nNavigate to Firewall > Address Objects.\n\nNote: The firewall does a DNS lookup on mail.google.com to find the IP addresses associated with that URL and then compares the TO address in the packet header to those addresses.\n\nScroll down to the Address Objects section on the bottom half of the page, and then click on Add.\n\nOn the Address Object page, select the following:\n\nName: Gmail Address Object (type this in)\n\nZone Assignment: WAN (Choose WAN because Gmail exists on the internet, which is part of the WAN zone)\n\nType: FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)\n\nFQDN Hostname: mail.google.com\n\nThen click Add.\n\nNote:\n\n“Type:” can be any of the following values:\n\nHost – Single IP address of a single host on the network. For example: 192.168.1.27\n\nRange – Range of IP addresses listing only the beginning and ending IP addresses. For example: 10.1.1.50 – 10.1.1.100\n\nMAC – MAC address of the single host. For example: 00:06:01:AB:02:CD\n\nNetwork – Range of IP addresses that are defined by a network and a subnet mask. For example: 172.16.20.0 / 255.255.255.0\n\nFQDN – Fully Qualified Domain Name of one or multiple IP addresses. For example: mail.google.com is the FQDN of 74.125.227.213 and 74.125.227.214\n\nVerify that the Address Object was created by viewing it at the bottom of the page.\n\nStage II – Create Access Rule\n\nComplete these steps in the SonicWall GUI in order to create an Access Rule to block the Gmail website. The Access Rule will match the Address Object and then perform a Deny of that packet.\n\nNavigate to Firewall > Access Rules.\n\nUnder View Style, click on Matrix.\n\nNote: The default view for the access rules lists all of the rules together on one page. This can be confusing, so SonicWall created two additional views to better organize your firewall rules: Matrix view and Drop-down Box view.\n\n-All Rules – Lists all of the Access Rules on one page\n\n-Matrix View – Organizes the Access Rules in a From/To grid and limits the rules that are seen to whatever From/To combination is picked.\n\n-Drop-down boxes view – Reduces the user’s choices to two drop-down boxes: One box has the “From” zones while the other box has the “To” zones.\n\nIn the Matrix view, Click on the arrow where the From:LAN intersects with the To:WAN.\n\nClick on Add.\n\nChoose the following items:\n\nAction: Deny (this will block the packet)\n\nService: Any (this will include all TCP/UDP ports)\n\nSource: Any (This will include all source IP addresses)\n\nDestination: Gmail Address Object (this is the address object that we created in the previous stage)\n\nThen Click Add\n\nVerify that the Access Rule that you created is active by viewing it in the list of Access Rules.\n\nHow to Test\n\nComplete these steps in order to test the Firewall Access Rules configuration.\n\nFrom a computer within the network, open a web browser and go to the following web page:\n\nhttps://mail.google.com\n\nYou should receive an error page like the one in this picture. This means that your rule is working.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot\n\nCheck the following items in order to troubleshoot this configuration:\n\nRelated Resources\n\nSonicWall OS 5.8.1 Administrator’s Guide\n\nUTM: How to Block Ports using Firewall Access Rules in SonicOS Enhanced: https://www.sonicwall.com/us/en/support/2213.html?fuzeurl=https://www.fuzeqna.com/sonicwallkb/ext/kb8110-utm-how-to-block-ports-using-firewall-access-rules-in-sonicos-enhanced\n\nUTM: Using Firewall Access Rules to block incoming and outgoing traffic: https://www.sonicwall.com/us/en/support/2213.html?fuzeurl=https://www.fuzeqna.com/sonicwallkb/ext/kb8110-utm-how-to-block-ports-using-firewall-access-rules-in-sonicos-enhanced\n\nHow to Block Ports in SonicWall: http://www.sonicwall.com/downloads/How_to_Block_Ports(1).pdf\n\nLast Updated on 6/6/2013"
