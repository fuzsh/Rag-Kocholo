Learn More.\n\nAs the demand for robust security defense grows, the market for cybersecurity technology has exploded, as have the number of available solutions. To help you navigate this growing market, we recommend 20 of the world’s leading cybersecurity technology providers and another 20 honorable mentions, based on their innovation, revenue and growth, user reviews, product features and benefits, analyst reports, independent security tests, and use cases.\n\nTop Cybersecurity Companies\n\nThe following table compares our top 20 providers, including the number of times they’ve made it into one of our buyer’s guides.\n\nPalo Alto Networks\n\nBest Protection Against Network, Endpoint & Remote Asset Attacks\n\nHeadquarters: Santa Clara, California\n\nFounded: 2005\n\nAnnual Revenue: $7.52 billion\n\nAppearances on eSecurity Planet‘s Top Vendors lists: 14\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) delivers a broad portfolio of security products and a long history of top scores in rigorous independent security tests. Known for strong next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) products, it also ranks for network security tools, zero trust, extended detection and response (XDR), IoT security, software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN), and secure access service edge (SASE).\n\nWhile known primarily for its comprehensive cybersecurity solutions, Palo Alto managed a top-four finish in the first MITRE managed security tests, showing that it’s no slouch in security services either. Its security product tests have been consistently excellent, including in the latest MITRE endpoint security tests and CyberRatings firewall tests. Analysts predict that the 19-year-old firm will grow its annual revenue at an 18% rate over the next five years.\n\nFortinet\n\nBest for Network Security Perimeter Protection\n\nHeadquarters: Sunnyvale, California\n\nFounded: 2000\n\nAnnual Revenue: $5.3 billion\n\nAppearances on eSecurity Planet‘s Top Vendors lists: 15\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) turned its firewall expertise into leadership positions in NGFW, web application firewalls (WAF), unified threat management (UTM) and adjacent markets like software-defined wide area networks (SD-WAN) and enterprise virtual private networks (VPNs).

The following didn’t make our top 20 cybersecurity companies, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have great products and services. Some continue to gain traction and in other cases, mergers and private equity takeovers have limited our visibility. But all these vendors make our top product lists and meet the needs of many users.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we started with innovation and market leadership, hence our focus on our rigorously researched top security product lists, or buyer’s guides. Consistent performance, revenue, and growth were ranking factors, as were strong independent security test results in a market that’s starved for information. User reviews, product features, benefits and use cases, and analyst reports also played a role in our analysis.\n\nSpecialization can be a good thing in cybersecurity, with the likes of CrowdStrike, Okta, and OneTrust high on our list. The vendors at the top of the list shouldn’t surprise longtime readers — Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet continue to impress us — and a number of other vendors have also withstood the test of time.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nThe following questions are some of the most common from individuals researching security technologies and jobs.\n\nWhat Are the Main Types of Cybersecurity?\n\nWhile the security industry is broad and nuanced, there are a few widely recognized categories of security:\n\nNetwork security: Protects the connections between networks, including data transfers to and from the internet, and hardware like routers and switches.\n\nEndpoint security: Defends devices like laptops, phones, and servers.\n\nApplication security: Adds protection for software, data, and access at the individual application level.\n\nCloud security: Protects cloud environments and data from vulnerabilities and threat actors.\n\nAlso note that some security solutions cover multiple categories. Extended detection and response (XDR), for example, pulls alerts from endpoints, networks, and applications into a single console for centralized management.\n\nHow Do You Choose a Cybersecurity Company?\n\nChoosing a cybersecurity vendor involves multiple factors, including company focus, integration issues, customer support needs, your team’s skill level, and your budget. Consider the following questions when choosing a cybersecurity vendor:\n\nWhat is the company’s overall focus? If you’re searching for a container security solution, consider a vendor that specializes in cloud and application security.\n\nHow many of their solutions will you use? If you have software or hardware from another security vendor, do they integrate well? And look at support for other applications too.\n\nWhat are your customer support needs? Signs that a vendor has good technical service include 24/7 support in multiple channels and high praise for the support team in reviews.\n\nCan your business afford it? Some smaller businesses might not have the budget for vendors like Palo Alto and CrowdStrike, and that’s okay. There are plenty of providers that have security solutions designed for small companies.\n\nWill Cybersecurity Jobs Become Obsolete?\n\nIf you’re a job seeker in the security industry or considering a career change, know that cybersecurity careers aren’t going anywhere. They might continue to change as the industry evolves, but demand for cybersecurity skills and training remains strong. Today’s IT climate requires knowledge of large security platforms, detection and response technologies, and even sometimes distributed systems.Job seekers will need to research the field and curate skills that will be most useful to potential employers. Organizations like EC-Council and CompTIA+ have certifications that provide a springboard for individuals wanting to start a security career. And continued education is critical for staying on top of threats — never stop learning.\n\nWhat Are the Top Cybersecurity Companies to Work For?\n\nThe following companies are a sample of highly rated enterprises with strong security solutions. If you’re job searching or considering a career change, look at open roles with these tech organizations.\n\nSentinelOne offers good benefits and receives 4.4 out of 5 stars on Glassdoor. It is also comparatively small in the security industry, with fewer than a thousand employees. And the company boasts some pretty stellar cybersecurity products too.\n\nNetskope offers flexible spending accounts, a 401(k), and employee stock purchase plans to its personnel. It earns 4.2 stars from Glassdoor employee reviews. Netskope specializes in SASE, CASB, and SD-WAN technology.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has employee benefits like stock purchase plans, development courses, and a 401(k). It earns 4 stars on Glassdoor. Palo Alto has some of the best and broadest security in the entire industry, so there’s lots of opportunity to experience different facets of security.\n\nFortinet offers benefits like unlimited PTO, a health savings account, and a 401(k) to employees. It, too, has 4 stars on Glassdoor. Fortinet is known for its firewalls but excels elsewhere as well, including in SIEM and EDR.\n\nAnd don’t forget big IT vendors with a security presence. Cisco (4.3 stars from Glassdoor) and Microsoft (4.2) are two standouts to consider.\n\nAnd lastly, CyberArk offers an investment program, employee recognition program, and tuition reimbursement. The IAM leader receives 4.3 stars on Glassdoor.\n\nBottom Line: Top Cybersecurity Companies\n\nThe enterprise security market is a wide one, covering a range of technologies and systems that need to be protected. Some vendors offer a variety of products, while others specialize in just one or two.\n\nTo choose a potential provider for your business, consider your needs first before searching for the right fit. While all the vendors listed above offer strong solutions, it’s worth the effort to research and demo products until you find one well suited to your organization’s cybersecurity needs.\n\nCrave more insight into the cybersecurity companies in the market?
