        "text": "What is a CSR?\n\nA CSR code (Certificate Signing Request) is a specific code and an essential part of the SSL activation process. It contains information about the website name and the company contact details. For many reasons, the code should be created on the hosting server end. For some servers, it is the obligatory condition.\n\nNote: Many hosting providers offer CSR code generation assistance to their clients where possible. Thus, it is worth checking with the web-hosting company whether they provide such a service and whether it is available in your hosting plan.\n\nCSR generation instructions\n\nYou can generate a Certificate Signing Request code yourself, e.g. if you manage the hosting server on your own or if this is the best option for your server type/hosting plan. In this case, select your web server from the list below and follow the instructions.\n\nApache OpenSSL/ModSSL/Nginx/Heroku\n\nAWS\n\nCertreq\n\ncPanel\n\nCWP 7\n\nCitrix NetScaler VPX\n\nDirectAdmin\n\nExchange 2007 (PowerShell)\n\nExchange 2010\n\nExchange 2013 (EAC)\n\nExchange 2013 (Shell)\n\nGlassfish\n\nGoogle Cloud Service\n\nIIS 7\n\nIIS 8&10\n\nISPConfig\n\nMac OS via Keychain\n\nMac OS X Server/Yosemite/El Capitan\n\nNamecheap EasyWP App\n\nNode.js\n\nPlesk 12\n\nPlesk Onyx\n\nSonicWall\n\nSun Java System Web Server 7.x\n\nSynology NAS\n\nTomcat (using keytool)\n\nUnifi\n\nVesta CP\n\nWebmin\n\nWHM\n\nWindows with OpenSSL\n\nZimbra\n\nusing MMC/Certreq/Powershell on a Windows-based server\n\nNote: CSR codes should have no less than 2048-bit key size.\n\nCSR Generation Notes\n\nIf you do not see your server type listed above, click on this link for tips to generate CSR provided by the Sectigo Certificate Authority (CA).\n\nAlternatively, the following online tool can be used to generate CSR: https://decoder.link/csr_generator. You will find the instructions on how to use it in this article. Please make sure to save both the CSR and Private Key codes, as the latter one will be required for the certificate installation process on the server.\n\nIf you are activating a Multi-Domain certificate, and your server does not allow you to generate a CSR for multiple common names, activate your certificate using just one common name. You will be able to add all the required Subject Alternative Names (SANs) through your Namecheap account during the activation process.\n\nIf you're using hosting services from Namecheap, click here for instructions."
