Let us know how we can make it better.\n\nOverview\n\nAs business applications move from on-premises to cloud hosted solutions, users experience password fatigue due to disparate logons for different applications. Single sign-on (SSO) technologies seek to unify identities across systems and reduce the number of different credentials a user has to remember or input to gain access to resources.\n\nWhile SSO is convenient for users, it presents new security challenges. If a user's primary password is compromised, attackers may be able to gain access to multiple resources. In addition, as sensitive information makes its way to cloud-hosted services it is even more important to secure access by implementing two-factor authentication and zero-trust policies.\n\nAbout Duo Single Sign-On\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is our cloud-hosted SSO product which layers Duo's strong authentication and flexible policy engine on top of SonicWall SMA 200 Series logins. Duo Single Sign-On acts as an identity provider (IdP), authenticating your users using existing on-premises Active Directory (AD) or another SSO IdP. Duo SSO prompts users for two-factor authentication and performs endpoint assessment and verification before permitting access to SonicWall SMA 200 Series.\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is available in Duo Premier, Duo Advantage, and Duo Essentials plans, which also include the ability to define policies that enforce unique controls for each individual SSO application. For example, you can require that Salesforce users complete two-factor authentication at every login, but only once every seven days when accessing SonicWall SMA 200 Series. Duo checks the user, device, and network against an application's policy before allowing access to the application.\n\nConfigure Single Sign-On\n\nBefore configuring SonicWall SMA 200 Series with Duo SSO using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 authentication you'll first need to enable Duo Single Sign-On for your Duo account and configure a working authentication source.\n\nOnce you have your SSO authentication source working, continue to the next step of creating the SonicWall SMA 200 Series application in Duo.\n\nCreate the SonicWall SMA 200 Series Application in Duo\n\nLog on to the Duo Admin Panel and navigate to Applications.\n\nClick Protect an Application and locate the entry for SonicWall SMA 200 Series with a protection type of \"2FA with SSO hosted by Duo (Single Sign-On)\" in the applications list. Click Protect to the far-right to start configuring SonicWall SMA 200 Series. See Protecting Applications for more information about protecting applications in Duo and additional application options. You'll need the information on the SonicWall SMA 200 Series page under Downloads later.\n\nThe SonicWall SMA 200 Series application uses the Username attribute when authenticating. We've mapped the <Username> bridge attribute to Duo Single Sign-On supported authentication source attributes as follows:\n\nBridge Attribute Active Directory SAML IdP <Username> sAMAccountName Username\n\nIf you are using a non-standard username attribute for your authentication source, check the Custom attributes box and enter the name of the attribute you wish to use instead.\n\nIn the Duo Admin Panel under \"Downloads\", click Download certificate.\n\nYou can adjust additional settings for your new SAML application at this time â€” like changing the application's name from the default value, enabling self-service, or assigning a group policy.\n\nKeep the Duo Admin Panel tab open. You will come back to it later.\n\nDuo Universal Prompt\n\nThe Duo Universal Prompt provides a simplified and accessible Duo login experience for web-based applications, offering a redesigned visual interface with security and usability enhancements.\n\nUniversal Prompt Traditional Prompt\n\nWe've already updated the Duo SonicWall SMA 200 Series application hosted in Duo's service to support the Universal Prompt, so there's no action required on your part to update the application itself. If you created your SonicWall SMA 200 Series application before March 2024, you can activate the Universal Prompt experience for users from the Duo Admin Panel. SonicWall SMA 200 Series applications created after March 2024 have the Universal Prompt activated by default.\n\nIf you created your SonicWall SMA 200 Series application before March 2024, it's a good idea to read the Universal Prompt Update Guide for more information, about the update process and the new login experience for users, before you activate the Universal Prompt for your application.\n\nActivate Universal Prompt\n\nActivation of the Universal Prompt is a per-application change. Activating it for one application does not change the login experience for your other Duo applications.\n\nThe \"Universal Prompt\" area of the application details page shows that this application is \"Ready to activate\", with these activation control options:\n\nShow traditional prompt: Your users experience Duo's traditional prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\nShow new Universal Prompt: (Default) Your users experience the Universal Prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\nThe application's Universal Prompt status shows \"Activation complete\" here and on the Universal Prompt Update Progress report.\n\nShould you ever want to roll back to the traditional prompt, you can return to this setting and change it back to Show traditional prompt. However, this will still deliver the Duo prompt via redirect, not in an iframe. Keep in mind that support for the traditional Duo prompt ended for the majority of applications in March 2024.\n\nUniversal Update Progress\n\nClick the See Update Progress link to view the Universal Prompt Update Progress report. This report shows the update availability and migration progress for all your Duo applications. You can also activate the new prompt experience for multiple supported applications from the report page instead of visiting the individual details pages for each application.\n\nEnable SonicWall SMA 200 Series for SSO\n\nLog into the SonicWall SMA management interface as an administrative user.\n\nIn the left menu sidebar, click System and then click Certificates.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click IMPORT SAML CERTIFICATE. Upload the certificate file you downloaded earlier.\n\nEnter a unique display name for your certificate into the Display Name (optional) field and then click UPLOAD.\n\nIn the left menu sidebar, click Portals and then click Portals.\n\nClick Add Portal and then click the General tab.\n\nIn the Portal Name field, enter a descriptive name for your SSO portal, like \"Duo-SSO-Portal\".\n\nClick the Virtual Host tab.\n\nEnter your desired Virtual Host Domain Name (for example, smasaml.example.com) and select a Virtual Host Certificate to secure the incoming client connection with SSL (see the SonicWALL administration guide for your device to learn how to import virtual host certificates).\n\nClick OK.\n\nIn the \"Portals\" list, locate the portal you created above. Copy the domain name in the \"VIRTUAL HOST SETTINGS\" column and paste it into the Duo Admin Panel Appliance's IP address or Hostname field.\n\nReturn to the SonicWall SMA management interface. In the left menu sidebar, click Portals and then click Domains.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click ADD DOMAIN.\n\nClick the Authentication type drop-down menu and select SAML 2.0 Identity Provider.\n\nIn the Domain name field, enter a custom name for your domain. The custom name needs to be unique on the SMA device.\n\nIn the Appliance ID field, enter a custom name for your appliance ID.\n\nCopy the appliance ID you entered and paste it into the Duo Admin Panel Appliance ID field.\n\nIn the Duo Admin Panel, copy the Server ID and paste it into the SonicWall SMA management interface Server ID field.\n\nReturn to the Duo Admin Panel. Copy the Authentication service URL and paste it into the SonicWall SMA management interface Authentication service URL field.\n\nReturn to the Duo Admin Panel. Copy the Logout service URL and paste it into the SonicWall SMA management interface Logout service URL field.\n\nClick the Trusted Certificates drop-down menu and select the Duo certificate you uploaded earlier.\n\nSelect the portal you created for Duo SSO in the Portal name field.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click SUBMIT.\n\nReturn to the Duo Admin Panel. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save.\n\nLearn more about SonicWall SMA 200 Series SSO at the SonicWall Knowledge Base.\n\nUsing SSO\n\nYou can log on to the SonicWall SMA SSL VPN using SSO by navigating to the URL that uses the virtual domain name for the portal you created for Duo SSO e.g., https://smasaml.example.com. Select the Duo SSO domain from the domain list and click Next. You will then be redirected to Duo Single Sign-On to begin authentication.\n\nActive Directory Login\n\nWith Active Directory as the Duo SSO authentication source, enter the primary username (email address) on the Duo SSO login page and click or tap Next.\n\nEnter the AD primary password and click or tap Log in to continue.\n\nEnable Duo Passwordless to log in to Duo SSO backed by Active Directory authentication without entering a password in the future.\n\nSAML Login\n\nWith another SAML identity provider as the Duo SSO authentication source, Duo SSO immediately redirects the login attempt to that SAML IdP for primary authentication. Users do not see the Duo SSO primary login screen.\n\nDuo Authentication\n\nSuccessful verification of your primary credentials by Active Directory or a SAML IdP redirects back to Duo. Complete Duo two-factor authentication when prompted and then you'll return to SonicWall SMA 200 Series to complete the login process.\n\n* Universal Prompt experience shown.\n\nSonicWall VPN Clients\n\nSonicWall VPN clients, like NetExtender or Mobile Connect, launch a browser window or tab for completing Duo Single Sign-On authentication. The VPN client connects after Duo authentication completes successfully in the browser.\n\nYou can also log into SonicWall SMA 200 Series using Duo Central, our cloud-hosted portal which allows users to access all of their applications in one spot. Link to SonicWall SMA 200 Series in Duo Central by adding it as an application tile. Once the tile has been added, log into Duo Central and click the tile for IdP-initiated authentication to SonicWall SMA 200 Series.\n\nCongratulations! Your SonicWall SMA 200 Series users now authenticate using Duo Single Sign-On.\n\nSee the full user login experience, including expired password reset (available for Active Directory authentication sources) in the Duo End User Guide for SSO.\n\nEnable Remembered Devices\n\nTo minimize additional Duo two-factor prompts when switching between SonicWall SMA 200 Series and your other Duo Single Sign-On SAML applications, be sure to apply a shared \"Remembered Devices\" policy to your SAML applications.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nNeed some help?
