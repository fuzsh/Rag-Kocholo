Select the whitelist to which you want to add the AP. 1.Īccess the WebUI, and navigate to Configuration> Wireless> AP Installation. To add an entry via the WebUI, use the following procedure. You can add an AP to the campus AP or remote AP whitelists via the WebUI or command-line interface. If you manually add APs to the whitelists (rather than automatically adding the APs via the automatic certificate provisioning feature), make sure that the whitelists have been synchronized to all other controllers on the network before enabling control plane security.Īdding APs to the Campus and Remote AP Whitelists When you revoke or remove an AP from the campus or remote AP whitelist on a controller that uses control plane security, that AP is not able to communicate with the controller again, except to obtain a new certificate. Use the whitelists to grant valid APs secure access to the network, or to revoke access from suspected rogue APs. Any APs not approved or certified on the network are also included in the whitelists, but these APs appear in an unapproved state. Managing AP Whitelists Managing AP WhitelistsĬampus and Remote APs appear as valid APs in the campus and Remote AP whitelists when you manually enter their information into the whitelists via the controller’s CLI or WebUI, or after the controller sends the AP a certificate via automatic certificate provisioning and the AP connects to its controller via a secure tunnel."
