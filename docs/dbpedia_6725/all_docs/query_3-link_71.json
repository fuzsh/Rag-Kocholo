Unless someone is using the same product ( sonicwall ) and has done exactly what you asked for, it's difficult to get help with the information you have added.\n\ni can see that, but for ips, i want urls. is possible?\n\nPlease try to elaborate on the above, it;s not clear what you are trying to do.\n\nHow do the logs from sonicwall look like ?\n\nWhat kind information do they contain?\n\nDo logs contain the URL you want to visualize ?\n\nWhat have you tried to do already and how did you do it ?\n\nWhat do you want to do differently now ?\n\nWhat did you try already to achieve your goal and how did that fail?\n\nThe more time you spend describing your problem and what you want to do, the more probable it will become for someone to spend time helping you out"
