Is it just a matter of a DNS record with the domain registrar? If so, what type of record should I be using?\n\nSo just add an A record? Host being “vpn” and “Points to” being the external IP of the Sonicwall? Will I still need to put the port number at the end of the url?\n\nYes, just create the A record vpn and point to the VPN IP of the SonicWALL. You can’t specify the port in an A record. You will need to add that to your connection URL.\n\nTo add to that, what I do is change the management port from 443 go 444, then the SSLVPN listening port to 443. This way your users don’t have to specify a port in the URL."
