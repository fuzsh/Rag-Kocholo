        "text": "1) We do not have any official documentation for creating a VPN with SonicWall. Still, any VPN that is not Meraki to Meraki is configured the same using the Non-Meraki VPN Peers guide.\n\n2) For the MX platform, static routes are used to define subnets accessible through the MX LAN, so you cannot configure static routes over the Non-Meraki VPN. Any local subnet you have enabled on the VPN page of the Meraki dashboard will route to the Customer 2 subnets defined in the private subnet field of the Non-Meraki VPN configuration.\n\n3) @jimmyt234 is correct; This is a tricky process, but it can be achieved: Tag-Based IPsec VPN Failover documentation.\n\n4) I agree with @cmr; a simplified approach is using the Meraki-Auto VPN, which would require installing an MX at both locations."
