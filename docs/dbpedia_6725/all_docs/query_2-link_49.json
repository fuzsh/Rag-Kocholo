See Create a CSR on a SonicWALL Network Security Appliance (NSA).\n\nHow to Install Your SSL Certificate for SonicWALL NSA\n\nThese instructions cover how to install your SSL (End-Entity), Intermediate, and Root (Trust Anchors) Certificates PKCS#7 (.p7b), PEM (.pem) or DER (.der or .cer) encoded files. Depending on which SonicWALL appliance you are using, you may need to modify these instructions accordingly.\n\nInstalling the DigiCert Root and Intermediate Certificate\n\nInstalling Your SSL (End-Entity) Certificate\n\nI. Installing the DigiCert Root and Intermediate Certificate\n\nBecause you cannot install the Root and Intermediate Certificates at the same time, install the Root Certificate first, and then repeat the steps to install the Intermediate Certificate.\n\nLog into the SonicWALL appliance portal.\n\nIn the portal, expand System and click Certificates.\n\nOn the Certificates page, under Certificates and Certificate Requests, select Imported certificates and requests.\n\nNext, click Import.\n\nIn the Import Certificate window, click Import a CA certificate from a PKCS#7 (.p7b), PEM (.pem) or DER (.der or .cer) encoded file.\n\nNext, click Browse to locate and open your DigiCert Root or Intermediate Certificate .crt file.\n\nIn the Import Certificate window, click Import.\n\nAfter the certificate is imported, it appears in the list of certificates on the Certificates page.\n\nII. Installing Your SSL (End-Entity) Certificate\n\nIf you are installing an SSL Certificate corresponding to a pending CSR, use this instruction to install your SSL Certificate (.crt file).\n\nLog into the SonicWALL appliance portal.\n\nIn the portal, expand System and click Certificates.\n\nOn the Certificates page, to the right of the certificate with the pending request related to this SSL Certificate, click the Import icon.\n\nIn the Upload Signed Certificate for Signing Request window, click Browse to locate and open your DigiCert SSL Certificate (.crt file).\n\nNext, click Upload.\n\nIn the list of certificates on the Certificates page, the certificate should change from Pending request to Local certificate, and if you installed the DigiCert Root and Intermediate Certificates, there should be a Yes in the Validated column.\n\nYour SSL Certificate can now be enabled across your SonicWALL appliance."
