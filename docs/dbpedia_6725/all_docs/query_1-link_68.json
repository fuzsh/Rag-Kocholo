        "text": "A cloud-based multi-tenant security service that protects against today's advanced email threats\n\nEmail is the primary tool for business communications worldwide for organizations of all sizes. Email is also the number one threat vector for cyberattacks. Email threats have evolved from mass spam & phishing email campaigns to highly-targeted phishing attacks that can deliver ransomware & zero-day malware. These attacks can also take the form of business email compromise (BEC) attacks that seek wire transfers or confidential information. This new wave of sophisticated phishing attacks cannot be stopped by the traditional anti-spam & anti-malware solutions. What's more, government regulations now hold your business accountable for protecting confidential data, ensuring it is not leaked & ensuring the secure exchange of email containing sensitive customer data or confidential information.\n\nTo protect against these constantly evolving email threats, organizations must deploy a layered security solution that goes beyond anti-spam & anti-malware. This solution should include dedicated, advanced-threat protection capabilities, & protect against malicious attachments & URLs, as well as impostor-based attacks. In addition, managing & maintaining an on-premises email security solution can become costly & time-consuming. As such, organizations can benefit from replacing legacy solutions with an easy-to-use, affordable hosted email security solution that easily integrates with existing email infrastructure, that can be quickly provisioned without upfront expense & that dynamically responds to new threats while reducing ongoing administration cost & complexity.\n\nSonicWall Hosted Email Security offers superior, cloud-based protection from inbound & outbound threats, including ransomware, phishing, business email compromise (BEC), spoofing, spam & viruses, at an affordable, predictable & flexible monthly or annual subscription price. At the same time, it minimizes upfront deployment time & costs, as well as ongoing administration expenses. SonicWall Hosted Email Security with Capture Advance Threat Protection service dynamically scans all suspicious email attachments & URLs, analyzes them in a multi-engine sandbox, & blocks dangerous files or URLs before they reach your network. Capture ATP includes our patent-pending Real-Time Deep Memory Inspection (RTDMI) technology. The RTDMI engine proactively detects & blocks mass-market, zero-day threats & unknown malware by inspecting directly in memory. SonicWall Hosted Email Security with Capture ATP delivers advanced attachment & URL protection to protect against ransomware & targeted phishing attacks."
