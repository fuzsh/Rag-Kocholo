It has no IP and it says assign interface to vlan: Office-Lan.\n\nHow do I set up this on the SonicWALL. Pls help\n\nHello,\n\nThat is because interface ethernet 1/2 id a layer 2 interface and has no IP access. Only layer 3 interfaces have an IP address. I'm not sure how far you have gotten but the Palo Alto is a superior device to the SonicWall.\n\nRegards,\n\nHello,\n\nSorry to hear that. Not sure how to do it on the SonicWall, however there needs to be a layer 3 interface somewhere. If in the PAN you can look under interfaces-> vlans. Perhaps try to the other vendors forums?\n\nBest of luck."
