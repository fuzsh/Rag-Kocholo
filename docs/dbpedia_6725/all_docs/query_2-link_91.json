        "text": "Just upgraded a client from XFINITY internet to Hargray fiber. The password to the sonicwall got lost so we reset the sonicwall to factory and set it back up with the new PPPOE settings for Hargray. Everything seemed to be working fine until hours later when employees started having issues with a few certain websites.\n\nCannot reach some websites. The main ones I have found are AOL.com, the local Tax Assessor website, and XFINITY email.\n\nAOL.com and the Tax Assessor site gives : This site can't be reached ERR_TIMED OUT\n\nXFINITY Email gives : This site can't provide a secure connection ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_ MISMATCH\n\nAnother issue I noticed after looking at their issues is that I can't get the sonicwall to register. When I click Update your registration button, it will not connect. It also says in the Status at the bottom: Dynamic Update Connection Failure Detected. Please refresh to re-activate dynamic updates.\n\nMysonicwall.com shows the device as offline. It's like it can't connect back to the site."
