I feel like this should be absolutely simple to do and I just can’t get it working.\n\nWe’re currently exploring Sonicwall’s Virtual Office for remote access. Users currently navigate to a subdomain (ra.ourdomain.com) which points to the external IP of the Sonicwall. That puts them on the admin login page, and there’s a teeny tiny “click here for SSLVPN login” button underneath where they need to click to get to their login page. I’m sure you can all imagine the support calls from people trying to log in to the wrong page over and over again.\n\nWhat I want to do is point the ra.ourdomain.com subdomain directly to the SSLVPN login page, which is ra.ourdomain.com/sslvpn (or the public IP on port 4433).\n\nI can’t add an A record to our registrar’s DNS that specifies a port, and I can’t add a CNAME record with a /sslvpn on the end. What silly little thing am I missing?\n\nThanks."
