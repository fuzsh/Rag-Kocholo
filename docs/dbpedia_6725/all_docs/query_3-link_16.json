        "text": "Configuring a SonicWALL Firewall with 3CX\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis document describes the configuration of Dell Sonicwall devices based on an TZ100, TZ100W, TZ105, TZ105W, TZ200, TZ200W, TZ205, TZ205W, TZ210, TZ 210W, TZ215, TZ 215W, NSA 220, NSA 220W, NSA 240, NSA 2400, NSA 3500, NSA 4500, NSA 5000, NSA E5500, NSA E6500, NSA E7500, NSA E8500, NSA E8510 for the use with 3CX Phone System. This guide is written for Sonicwalls that are configured as Many-to-One NAT. Please note that we cannot assist you in the configuration of your firewall.\n\nRequirements\n\nDELL Sonicwall firewalls require HotFix firmware SonicOS 5.8.1.15o HotFix 152075 or later\n\nStep 1: Create Service Objects\n\nIn order to configure the SonicWall you need to create the service objects for each Port or Port range that needs to be forwarded. Then place these service objects in a service group after which you have to apply the policies.\n\nOpen the Web Management Console of the DELL SonicWall Firewall Gateway and go to Network → Services.\n\nIn section “Services” add one service object for each port that 3CX requires forwarding for.\n\nIn section “Service Groups” add a new service group named “3CX Services” and add all of the above Service Objects as members.\n\nNow go to Network → Address Object and locate section “Address Objects”.\n\nHere add a new Address Object and set:\n\nName: 3CX PBX\n\nZone Assignment: LAN\n\nType: Host\n\nIP Address: The LAN IP address of your 3CX Server\n\nStep 2: Create NAT Policy\n\nGo to “Network → NAT Policies” and press “Add”.\n\nCreate your Inbound NAT policy by filling in the following fields:\n\n“General” tab\n\nOriginal Source: Any\n\nTranslated Source: Original\n\nOriginal Destination: WAN Interface IP\n\nTranslated Destination: 3CX PBX (this is the Address Object created in Step 1)\n\nOriginal Service: 3CX Services (this is the Service Group created in Step 1)\n\nTranslated Service: Original\n\nInbound Interface: Select the WAN interface your 3CX Will be using\n\nOutbound Interface: Any\n\nComment: 3CX Inbound Connections\n\nEnable NAT Policy: Checked/Enabled\n\nPress “Add” again to create your Outbound NAT policy by filling in the following fields:\n\n“General” tab:\n\nOriginal Source: 3CX PBX (this is the Address Object created in Step 1)\n\nTranslated Source: WAN Interface IP\n\nOriginal Destination: Any\n\nTranslated Destination: Original\n\nOriginal Service: Any\n\nTranslated Service: Original\n\nInbound Interface: Any\n\nOutbound Interface: Select the WAN interface your 3CX Will be using\n\nComment: 3CX Outbound Connections\n\nEnable NAT Policy: Checked/Enabled\n\n“Advanced” tab:\n\nDisable Source Port Remap: Checked/Enabled\n\nOnce you have create the 2 required NAT Policies, they should look similar to the following:\n\nStep 3: Creating Firewall Access Rules\n\nGo to “Firewall → Access Rules”, select the “WAN to LAN” option and press “Add”.\n\nCreate a new Access Rule with the following fields:\n\n“General” tab:\n\nAction: Allow\n\nFrom Zone: WAN\n\nTo Zone: LAN\n\nService: 3CX Services (this is the Service Group created in Step 1)\n\nSource: Any\n\nDestination: Select the Address Object of the “WAN/Public IP” you have configured 3CX to use\n\nUsers Allowed: All\n\nSchedule: Always on\n\nComment: 3CX Inbound Access\n\nAllow Fragmented Packets: Checked/Enabled\n\nStep 4: Disable SIP Transformations\n\nGo to ”VoIP → Settings”\n\nIn the “SIP Settings” section disable option: Enable SIP Transformations\n\nStep 5: Validating Your Setup\n\nLog into your 3CX Management Console → Dashboard → Firewall and run the 3CX Firewall Checker. This will validate if your firewall is correctly configured for use with 3CX.\n\nMore information about the Firewall Checker can be found here.\n\nLast Updated\n\nThis document was last updated on 13 July 2018"
