Using SonicWall CFS, organizations have control over the websites students and employees can access using their IT-issued computer behind the firewall.\n\nSonicWall CFS compares requested websites against a massive database in the cloud containing millions of rated URLs, IP addresses and websites. CFS provides administrators with the tools to create and apply policies that allow or deny access to sites based on individual or group identity, or by time of day, for over 56 pre-defined categories. CFS also dynamically caches website ratings locally on the SonicWall firewall for nearinstantaneous response times."
