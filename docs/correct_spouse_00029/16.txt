The Bachelor's Bob Guiney & Wife Rebecca Budig Split

The reality star -- who became beloved as the jovial, self-effacing regular guy looking for love with Trista Rehn (now Trista Sutter) on The Bachelorette and then as the star of season 4 of ABC's The Bachelor -- and his wife of five years, All My Children star Rebecca Budig, are calling it quits, according to several sources close to the couple.

"They've been on the rocks for a long time and lately it's become clear that nothing is going to save this," a friend of Budig says. "They've just grown apart and are no longer the people they were when they got married."
