I’m your host, Andy, and I created reality blurred 24 years ago as a blog to collect interesting links I found about reality TV.\n\nToday, it’s home to a wide range of writing about entertainment rooted in real life, from competition reality shows to true-crime documentaries, and a vibrant community of pop culture fans.\n\nAs a writer who obsessively and critically covers reality TV, focusing on how it’s made and what it means, I review and recommend reality TV shows; analyze news and report from behind the scenes; and interview people who create and star in reality TV shows.\n\nI believe pop culture can both entertain and affect us, and so reality blurred’s goal is to amplify the best and hold the worst accountable. In other words, let’s call out the worst, celebrate the best, and talk about it all."
