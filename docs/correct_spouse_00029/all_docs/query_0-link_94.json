The Bachelor wedding was followed by a celebratory barbecue.\n\nGuiney and Budig met in January 2003, while taping a segment for Bachelor XYZ, an ABC Family recap show composed of Bachelor highlights.\n\nGuiney, who had just been given the boot by Bachelorette Trista Rehn, was instantly smitten with the soap-star host of XYZ, but the attraction wasn't mutual--Budig was dating someone else at the time.\n\nHowever, by November, with both newly single, Guiney and Budig reconnected. They announced their engagement this May.\n\nSaturday marked the first trip down the aisle for Budig, second for Guiney, who frequently cited his divorce as his reason not to commit on The Bachelor.\n\nThis time around, Guiney says he had no trouble going all the way, telling People: \"I wanted her to feel how committed I am to our relationship. We just have an absolute blast together. We are best friends on top of everything else.\""
