He chose bachelorette Maribel Liliana \"Mary\" Delgado. On November 21, 2007, Delgado, was arrested in Tampa on charges of battery. According to authorities, she punched Velvick in the mouth, causing his upper lip to bleed, and was under the influence of alcohol when she was arrested. The couple had appeared together in a segment of a \"Bachelor\" reunion show the night before during which the audience was asked if Velvick should marry Delgado. Behind her back he shook his head to indicate \"no\", which caused the audience to laugh. There is some speculation this sparked the later argument. The couple later told reporters that despite the incident, they were still happy together.\n\nSource\n\nCharlie O'Connell\n\nIn the show, O'Connell chose Sarah Brice, a labor and delivery nurse who resided in Texas.
