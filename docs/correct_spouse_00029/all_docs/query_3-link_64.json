        "text": "John Stamos revealed that he almost had a romantic relationship with his on-screen “Full House” wife, Lori Loughlin, but ended up pursing Rebecca Romijn instead.\n\nIn his memoir, “If You Would Have Told Me,” the actor wrote (per InStyle) that his relationship with his co-star was “on the precipice of turning romantic” before he met Romijn in 1994.\n\nHe explained that the two had “the sort of true friendship that’s supposed to be the foundation of a great, lasting relationship.”\n\nHowever, when he and Loughlin attended a Victoria’s Secret fashion show afterparty together as friends – with Romjin also in attendance – he was forced to decide between the two ladies.\n\n“In my mind it was like … the two Sandys in ‘Grease!’” he recalled, of deciding whether to get out of the friend zone with Loughlin or begin something new with Romjin.\n\nStamos ended up choosing Romijn, and the two eventually tied the knot in September 1998. The romance didn’t last forever though, as they announced their separation six years later in 2004 and divorced the following year.\n\nThe “General Hospital” alum candidly discussed his first marriage in his memoir and even referred to his ex-wife as “the devil” during their tumultuous divorce.\n\n“I just hated her,” he told People last week. “I couldn’t believe how much I hated her, and it ruined my life.”\n\nStamos called the breakup “shattering” and “humiliating.”\n\nHe also admitted to feeling the lingering effects of it “for way too long.”\n\n“It went on [for] years and years,” he recalled. “You start thinking, it’s like, ‘Oh, she wasn’t the devil. Maybe I was as much to blame as her.'”\n\nAt the time of the split, the heartthrob felt like she “dumped” him, writing, “Her career was going great and mine wasn’t.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I don’t blame her for it. It was just the perception that people took. Maybe they weren’t wrong,” he continued. “She was doing great at that time and I wasn’t.”\n\nStamos has since moved on and had a whirlwind romance with Caitlin McHugh. The two confirmed their romance in 2016, got engaged in October 2017 and announced they were welcoming a baby together two months later.\n\nThey tied the knot in February 2018 and had a baby boy named Billy in April 2018."
