        "text": "When I called one of my best friends to tell her that I’d been awarded a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, she screamed profanities about how big this was—on speaker—while my 12-year-old stepdaughter was next to me. Sometimes my stepdaughter cheers when she hears curse words, and sometimes she thinks cursing makes you a bad person, and she hasn’t decided what she thinks for sure. I often have to be careful with my language around my youngest stepdaughter, but in this case, I didn’t tell my best friend not to curse. I wanted my stepdaughter to know how monumental this award is (and feels).\n\nI quit my job in academia earlier this year, and though I am glad to have walked away from a job that was giving me panic attacks, I have missed the community. Sometimes I worry about my writing’s value without institutional support (and a salary). Nevertheless, this fall I have combed through newspaper microfilm and court records to piece together the crimes I grew up around for my book. I have spent time thinking about the librarian who shares my mother’s first name; she was murdered when I was a child. I have thought about the man who kidnapped and murdered a car salesman to steal a car and visit his girlfriend in another state. I have thought about my father’s own drug use, alcoholism, and abuse while solving these cases. I have thought about the darkness of my narrative.\n\nHowever, the NEA Literature Fellowship is a burst of light which reminds me that my writing matters. I want to sincerely thank the NEA for their faith in my work. I will continue writing my book, and I will also carry this boost of confidence with me every day."
