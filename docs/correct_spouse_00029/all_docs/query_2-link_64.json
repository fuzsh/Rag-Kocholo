        "text": "The Bachelor Season 4: Are Bob Guiney and Estella Gardinier still together?\n\nRelationship status: Broken up\n\nBob Guiney, a GSN host and the fourth Bachelor, was the first Bachelor to come from a season of The Bachelorette. Bob competed on The Bachelorette season 1 with Trista Sutter and came in fifth place. On his Bachelor finale, Bob didn’t propose to his winner, Estella Gardinier, but he gave her a promise ring as a vow that they would continue to date. The split soon after the season finale aired. Bob went on to marry All My Children actress Rebecca Budig, but the two split in 2010 after six years of marriage. He then married Jessica Canyon in 2016, and the two welcomed a baby son in December 2018.\n\n“I’m living in Seattle with my wife and new son Grayson, who is taking up all my time these days, which I love!” Bob’s told Us Weekly. “I still do ton of hosting for different live events and I go back and forth to New York twice a month to be on the Today show. I love it–they’ve very supportive of me and I love how much they make so fun of me. Life is gong very well. Thanks to the show, I’ve had such amazing opportunities come my way.”\n\nThe Bachelor Season 25: Are Matt James and Rachael Kirkconnell still together?\n\nRelationship status: Still together\n\nMatt James, a real estate agent and the best friend of The Bachelorette‘s Tyler Cameron, was the season 25 Bachelor. At his Final Rose Ceremony, he chose Rachael Kirkconnell as his winner but didn’t propose to her. After his season premiered, Rachael came under fire for a photo she took at a Southern antebellum-themed party at Georgia College in 2018. A former high school classmate of Rachael’s also accused her of bullying her and other women for dating Black men. At the “After the Final Rose” special, Matt confirmed that he broke up with Rachael due to the scandal. Reality Steve reported at the time that Matt called things off with Rachael after Valentine’s Day 2021.\n\n“Before Rachael addressed anything or Chris Harrison spoke on anything, I’m trying to be there for her, and I dismissed them as rumors, because that’s what they were to me. You hear things that are heartbreaking…and you just pray they’re not true. And then, when you find out that they are, it just makes you question everything” he said at the time.\n\nMatt and Rachael got back together in April 2021. Matt revealed in an episode of the “Pomp” podcast in May 2021 that he and Rachael got back together after she gave him an “ultimatum.” “She was like, ‘If you’re going to make this work, let’s do it. But, if you’re not going to make it work, I’m going to let you do your own thing,'” he recalled. “That’s really all I needed. It was an ultimatum that I needed. It’s been great.”\n\n“It was honestly a commitment that we made to each other that we were going to work on the relationship,” he said “There came a point in time where it was evident that my working on the relationship looked different than Rachael’s because I wasn’t really honoring that commitment that I made to working on the relationship.”\n\nThe Bachelor Season 26: Are Clayton Echard and Susie Evans still together?\n\nRelationship status: Broken up\n\nClayton Echard, a medical sales representative, was the season 26 Bachelor. Clayton’s eventual winner, Susie Evans, was eliminated in third place during Fantasy Suites after Clayton told her that he was in love and had sex with his other two finalists—Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey—and Susie questioned how he could be serious about their relationship when he was intimate with someone else. The fight escalated, and Clayton decided to eliminate Susie after she told him how she didn’t know if she could stay on the show if he was in love with other women.\n\nAt the final three Rose Ceremony with Rachel and Gabby, Clayton told both Rachel and Gabby that he was in love and had sex with both of them. Both Rachel and Gabby walk away and try to leave the show, which led Clayton to beg them to stay. Both Rachel and Gabby agreed to stay and Clayton gave them both roses. The finale continued with Gabby and Rachel meeting Clayton’s parents. After Gabby and Rachel’s meeting with Clayton’s parents, Clayton realized that he still had feelings for Susie and decided to talk to her. Host Jesse Palmer knocked on Susie’s door and told her that Clayton wanted to talk to her. Susie agreed and she and Clayton reunited. Susie then also met Clayton’s parents, after which he decided he wanted to choose her at the Final Rose Ceremony and eliminate Rachel and Gabby. At the Final Rose Ceremony, Clayton arrived with an engagement ring and a plan to propose to Susie, but before he could do so, Susie told Clayton that was not in love with him and walked away, which forced Clayton to leave The Bachelor single.\n\nDuring his “After the Final Rose” special in March 2022, Clayton revealed that he left the Final Rose ceremony to “what I thought was my normal life” until Susie contacted him to ask him to take her back. “I was absolutely shocked there was maybe that came from all of it,” Clayton said. Susie later came out during the special and confirmed that she and Clayton were back together and still dating. “We’re really happy and we’re happy to be here today,” she said. “That’s my boyfriend.” Susie confessed that she and Clayton “took some steps back,” but are currently in love. “I can confidently say yeah, he’s incredible,” she said.\n\nEight months later, Clayton and Susie announced their breakup. “With incredibly heavy hearts, we wanted to share that we have decided to go our separate ways. For anyone who has ever loved, knows this was a painful decision to make and not one taken lightly,” they said in a joint statement on their social media at the time. “We understand that there will likely be a lot of questions about this decision — social media is definitely a highlight reel and much of our experiences together we have kept private as I’m sure most can understand. But we will share this — although this last year together has brought us so much joy and so many laughs, there has also been a significant amount of pain.”\n\nThey continued, “We know no healthy relationship comes without its struggles, but we’ve realized that we were not prepared for the external forces that hindered our ability to not only heal as individuals but also as a couple.”\n\nThe couple told their followers that they were “focused on continuing to work on ourselves, so we can be the best version of ourselves” going forward. “This is not an easy time for either of us but we stand in support of each other and hope to see the other go on to find happiness and healing,” they said. “Although Claysie is no more, we hope that our communities can support us individually as we move forward with love and respect for each other.” They concluded their post “Thank you to all of you that supported our relationship. It means so much more than you will ever know.”"
