        "text": "We caught up with the three previous contestants with West Michigan connections who have appeared on \"The Bachelor\" or \"The Bachelorette.\"\n\nBob Guiney, 37\n\nSeason 1, \"The Bachelorette,\" Season 4, \"The Bachelor\"\n\nWhere is he now? Where is he not? Ex-Bachelor Bob married \"All My Children\" star Rebecca Budig in 2004 and has been busy carving out a niche as an all-purpose entertainment man. In addition to his original band (formerly Fat Amy, now The Bob Guiney Band), Guiney plays in the Band from TV, along with tube bigwigs such as Hugh Laurie from \"House\" and James Denton from \"Desperate Housewives.\"\n\nâ€¢ Ex-Grand Rapids woman Molly Malaney vies for nod from jilted 'Bachelor' Jason Mesnick\n\nThe former mortgage broker has one season of hosting TLC's \"Date My House\" under his belt and several episodes of the Web TV series \"Cooking to Get Lucky\", which he co-hosts with pal Eden Reigel, his wife's soaps costar.\n\nBiggest Perk of \"Bachelor\"-hood: \"I wouldn't have met Rebecca if I hadn't done the show,\" he said. Guiney chose Estella Gardinier in the final rose ceremony, but the two broke up soon after the show ended.\n\nHe met Budig when she hosted a show of \"Bachelor\" reruns. \"Because there's no way she would have rolled through Michigan in search of a mortgage,\" he said.\n\nBrad Andrzejewski, 34\n\n\"The Bachelorette,\" Season 2\n\nWhere is he now? \"Bachelor Brad\" also gave up the single life when he married in 2004. The hospital account manager for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals is a firmly established family man living in East Grand Rapids. \"It's hard to believe, but in two years' time I have a wife, a baby, and a dog.\" His wife, Jennifer, gave birth to a daughter, Ryan Evelyn, in July.\n\n\"Bachelorette\" Blip: \"The night before my wedding, my sister got a tape of the show with me on it, and the bridesmaids all watched,\" said Andrzejewski, who still keeps in touch with a couple of his co-contestants but has lost contact with \"Bachelorette\" Meredith Phillips.\n\n\"To this day, though, my wife and I have yet to sit down together and watch it. It was fun, but I sure don't want it to be the defining moment of my life!\"\n\nRobin Canfield, 23\n\n\"The Bachelor,\" Season 12\n\nWhere is she now? The Holland High School graduate, who had moved to Orlando when she was taping the show, moved again, this time to Glendale, Ariz., to attend grad school at the Thunderbird School of International Business.\n\nShe also is happily dating: \"My boyfriend and I had worked together for a couple of months before I went on the show,\" she said. \"He never saw it and thought the whole thing was kind of ridiculous.\"\n\nCanfield would like to pursue a career in consulting or the wine business.\n\n\"Bachelor\" Sightings: She expected to find after the show's run ended that having people recognize her \"would kind of die off,\" she said.\n\n\"But they still do. When I lived in Orlando, there would be these bodybuilder guys who shave their chests, and they would often recognize me. I would have thought they'd be the last people to watch 'The Bachelor.'\""
