        "text": "Rebecca Maier Mallory Vickery passed away in the early morning of Thursday, March 28, 2024, surrounded by her husband and family. She was 35 years old.\n\nBecca was born and raised in the countryside of DeGraff, Ohio. Her early years were spent running around barefoot on her parents’ beautiful 16 acre property, enjoying the comfort of the home her father built. Growing up near Indian Lake, she always enjoyed being outside. She spent her summer months boating with her friends and family and played soccer all throughout high school. As a child, she showed an affinity for all things creative, and much of her early artwork still decorates the walls of her parents’ home today. She continued to cultivate her artistic talents throughout her young life, choosing to pursue a career path in art and design.\n\nBecca attended the University of Cincinnati College of DAAP (Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning), earning a degree in Graphic Design. In addition to sharpening her skills as a designer, her five years at UC brought her together with some of her closest friends. Celebrated for her strength of character and her contagious laugh, she maintained incredibly strong relationships with her group of college friends long after they had graduated. It was during her college years, while participating in a service trip to El Salvador, that Becca met Joe Vickery, with whom she chose to share her life.\n\nBecca and Joe were married in the summer of 2012 at the Mallory Pond on her parents’ property. The pair could spend hours together simply talking and laughing, the love they shared both playful and resilient. To be in the presence of these two together was to witness an indomitable bond of friendship and support; their three daughters remain a testament to the strength of their partnership. Mallory was the first to join the family in 2013, followed by Hazel in 2015 and Rosie in 2018. These three girls, though very different in character, can’t help but light up a room, and their mother’s bright spirit continues to shine through each of them in unique ways. Becca and Joe spent nearly 15 years by each other's side, living each day as the closest of friends, supportive spouses, and loving parents.\n\nFollowing her keen talent for design, Becca worked with multiple brands and companies for five years before she joined the Cincinnati-based Boca Restaurant Group in 2016. She worked with Boca as a key member of the creative team for many years before “retiring” to better prioritize her family, her health, and her own creative pursuits. In 2023, she started a small studio where she designed and created 3D plaster artwork under the name Curio. Becca spent the final year of her life immersed in her creative work, finding joy and fulfillment in uninhibited artistic expression.\n\nBecca harbored a lifelong love of travel, finding inspiration in the pursuit of new experiences. She loved to share stories of her time spent living and working in Annecy, France, as well as a trip with her siblings through southeast Asia. Further international excursions include a food and wine tour through Italy with her mother Suzy, a stint in Greece with her close college friends, and a trip to Barcelona with her then-future-husband. Closer to home, Becca enjoyed camping with her family in their pop-up Eurovan, ceremoniously dubbed “Janet” by her three goofy girls. She always loved the beach; in particular, she held a special fondness for Grayton Beach in Florida, which she visited regularly with her family growing up. Later in life, she, Joe, and their girls regularly returned to this beach. It’s no surprise that Mallory, Hazel, and Rosie love the sunny beaches of Florida just as much as their mother did.\n\nBecca received her cancer diagnosis in the fall of 2017. Her family is thankful to her dedicated team of doctors who helped her navigate six and a half years of life with this diagnosis.\n\nShe leaves behind a memory of unbroken spirit, of brightness and light and laughter in everything and everyone she touched. Look to it in the artistic pieces she brought into the world, from her earliest drawings to her professional work. Hear it in the giggles of the three daughters she raised with her husband and the warm stories shared among her friends. Feel its presence in the places she loved, swimming in the Mallory pond, or walking along the beach in Florida. Witness it in the relationships of those she held dear, and celebrate the undeniable impression of her character on all who knew her.\n\nIf you would like to support the family during this time, in lieu of any flowers, food, or gifts, you may contribute to the Vickery Family Fundraiser. A consistent theme in Becca’s life was an appreciation for experience and education. In celebration of her legacy, all funds collected will go directly to the Vickery family to be used for experiential travel and higher education for each of her three daughters. You can also support cancer awareness efforts by donating directly to the Melanoma Know More or any cancer research non-profit of your choosing.\n\nBecca is predeceased by her father, Curt Mallory (2021); and her grandfather, Cyrus Mallory (2011). She is survived by her husband, Joe Vickery; first daughter, Mallory Vickery; second daughter, Hazel Vickery; and third daughter, Rosie Vickery; as well as her mother, Suzy (Maier) Mallory; brother, Grant Mallory; sister, Sarah Mallory; brother, Michael Mallory; grandmother, Verida Mallory; grandfather, Bob Maier; and grandmother, Carol Maier."
