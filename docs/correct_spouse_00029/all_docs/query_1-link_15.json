We are best friends and don├óΓé¼Γäót know what the future holds,├óΓé¼┬¥ the couple said in a statement.\n\nOh, really?????\n\n├óΓé¼┼ôThey talk on the phone every day and they truly are best friends. They don├óΓé¼Γäót know what is going to happen. They haven├óΓé¼Γäót filed for divorce,” claims another source close to the couple. ├óΓé¼┼ôThey├óΓé¼Γäóre not even fighting.├óΓé¼┬¥\n\nWTF?! Who gets divorced without fighting?!\n\nApparently, neither are dating anyone else, yet their marriage has been on the rocks for quite some time.\n\nBudig quit her gig on the soap last March to spend more time with her hubby in El Lay, but when the show relocated to the West Coast, she went back. And it still wasn’t enough to keep them together.\n\nWe’re sure they’ll be many more spouses in their future!"
