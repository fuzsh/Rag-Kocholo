        "text": "Bachelor Nation just got bigger! Bob Guiney and his wife, Jessica Canyon, welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Grayson Robert, on Monday, December 3.\n\nThe Bachelor season 4 star announced Grayson’s arrival on Instagram with a picture of the sleeping newborn. “@Jescanyon and baby are healthy and beautiful!” Guiney, 47, wrote. “Mom is resting with him on her chest right now. We are so excited and thankful for what this new day brings for our family.”\n\nGuiney revealed in June that Canyon was pregnant. “We are both so excited,” he told Us Weekly at the time. “I feel so lucky.”\n\nGuiney and Canyon celebrated their 2-year anniversary on November 11. She showed off her sense of humor on Instagram with a silly selfie and a caption that read: “Remember that time I convinced you to marry me, and then you knocked me up & now you’re stuck with me forever?!?!?”\n\nThe TV personality — he regularly appears on the Today show’s “Guys Tell All” segment, popped the question to Canyon over Labor Day weekend in 2015."
