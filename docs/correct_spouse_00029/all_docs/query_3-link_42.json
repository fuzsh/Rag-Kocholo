She has experience preparing company executives on key safety, regulatory, and scientific issues for sworn testimony, and has served as national and local counsel in more than half a dozen mass tort proceedings.\n\nHer practice also encompasses commercial disputes, bad faith litigation, and the defense of agricultural, aviation, and industrial manufacturers.\n\nAs an advocate, Rebecca is a creative collaborator often asked by her colleagues to “reach across the aisle” and negotiate favorable terms on behalf of one or more defendants. She views litigation strategy through the lens of her clients’ overall business goals, and capably pivots to explore new avenues when effective and necessary.\n\nA portion of Rebecca’s practice is dedicated to helping the underserved. She has provided pro bono representation to abused and neglected children, physically and mentally incapacitated adults, and prisoners pursuing civil rights claims."
