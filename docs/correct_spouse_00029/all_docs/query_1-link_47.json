        "meta_description": "In her current series ìModern Icons,î Rebecca explores the complexity of anxiety disorders through contemporary oil painting. Whether through an object, person, or animal, each piece depicts unique aspects of anxiety through subtle symbolism in a portraiture style. The resulting work can appear serious and contemplative or even humorous. \n \n \n \n Each work of art represents Rebecca's experience as a former therapist with an anxiety disorder. Her contemporary style combined with her travels through the breathtaking museums and churches of Italy heavily influenced this series.",
