        "text": "Both of these novels have been talked about and discussed incessantly ever since they were published! Each on its own is a gripping, page-turner that kept me up at night!\n\nWhile ‚ÄúRebecca‚Äù is a must-read classic already, ‚ÄúVerity‚Äù is full of even more suspense! Daphne du Maurier and Colleen Hoover are both masterful at their writing skills and have kept me on the edge of my seat!\n\nI absolutely loved both books, but I have to admit the similarities between them are so intriguing! Do you agree?\n\nLet‚Äôs get down to it!\n\nBe advised, spoilers ahead. You did not see that coming, did you? üò≤\n\nSimilarities between ‚ÄúVerity‚Äù and ‚ÄúRebecca‚Äù\n\nThey are both first person narratives.\n\nThe suspense is a killer, as are plot twists and surprises.\n\nBooks have the names of the wife character, not the actual narrator\n\nThe Narrator is insecure and intimidated by the wife character\n\nThe Narrator has financial troubles, unlike the wife character\n\nLowen and the second Mrs. de Winter are both caregivers before meeting the ones with whom they fall in love\n\nThe wife‚Äôs friends are judgemental or even rude to the narrators.\n\nThe imperfect love story between the wife and husband\n\nBoth Verity and Rebecca are portrayed as psychopaths\n\nBoth Verity and Rebecca have a nurse and a head housekeeper, respectively, who take care of them and antagonise the narrators further.\n\nThe husbands are terrible people!\n\nThe new couples work together to deceive the police and get out of the situation together, without facing consequences of murder.\n\nAnd now‚Ä¶to detail everything\n\n1. They are both first person narratives.\n\nThat I think it‚Äôs a big plus for both of them. It adds to the suspense. It makes us identify with the narrator, especially since we find out everything they find out along with them. We hurt and fear when they hurt and fear.\n\n2. Suspense is a killer\n\nI was absolutely enthralled by how easily I got into the atmosphere! I finished these books in one sitting and couldn‚Äôt get enough of them! ‚ÄúRebecca‚Äù reeled me in with the nature and gloom while ‚ÄúVerity‚Äù had Verity‚Äôs manuscript with spicy details and deadly thoughts.\n\n3. The Name of the Books\n\nThis one is obvious, but it had to be said. However, in both cases, I feel it was a perfect choice. The stories may be narrated by someone else, but the wives are really powerful and intriguing characters. They are the ones we really care about. It is their thoughts and actions that make us think and feel deeply. They excite in us awe and fear.\n\n4. An Insecure Narrator\n\nLowen is humbled by Verity‚Äôs success as an author compared to her own writing, while the second Mrs. de Winter‚Äôs manners, status and upbringing are nothing compared to Rebecca‚Äôs.\n\nThe contrast between the narrator and the wife is even more intriguing if we think about the husbands! How a man can fall in love with two such completely different people? ‚Ä¶Because, even though we may forget, both husbands fell in love madly with such powerful women, only to switch to 180 degrees with their second choice. This contrast is extremely obvious to the narrators as well, contributing to them being so intimidated by the original wives.\n\n5. Financial trouble\n\nThe narrators have it, the original wives don‚Äôt.\n\nLowen has bills to pay and no home, nowhere else to go when she stays with Jeremy at Crawford‚Äôs residence. The second Mrs. de Winter was, before meeting Maxim, gaining her living as a paid companion, food and housing included.\n\nTheir poor financial situation is a major contributor to the insecurity they feel. It is what makes the second Mrs. de Winter not hesitant to change her social status. It is what kept her in a servant‚Äôs mentality afterward, impeding her to make a serious impression as Maxim‚Äôs wife. It is what keeps her from changing anything in the way Rebecca had arranged Manderlay.\n\nLowen is equally forced by financial reasons to take the job as co-author of Verity‚Äôs books. The entire Verity plot hinges on her inability to quickly get out of a weird house.\n\n6. The caregiver type\n\nLowen and the second Mrs. de Winter are both caregivers before meeting the ones with whom they fall in love. Lowen cares for her mother in the months before she passes away due to cancer, while the second Mrs. de Winter works for Mrs. Van Hopper. She is paid for the menial tasks she does for the lady, as well as for companionship. In both cases, they are portrayed as compassionate and loving to further the contrast between them and the wives.\n\nEven more, in Lowen‚Äôs case, we can‚Äôt stop blaming her for becoming a mistress. The fact that she cares for her mother is meant to make her a more complex character, flawed but loveable nonetheless.\n\n7. How society judges\n\nIn both books the narrator gives off the feeling of being alone against the world. No ally in sight. No friend to confess and advise against mistakes. The second Mrs. de Winter finds an ally later on in Maxim‚Äôs sister, but she doesn‚Äôt understand everything either. Lowen remains isolated completely.\n\nThe feeling of loneliness they both give off is overwhelming and augments fear. It also intensifies when the wife‚Äôs friends are judgemental or even rude to the narrators. Of course, the two are in different situations from their status ‚Äì wife versus mistress, but they both feel like outsiders, not fitting in no matter what they do.\n\n8. The imperfect love story between the wife and husband\n\nBoth narrators infer the existence of the perfect love story between the first wife and the husband. Lowen reads about it in Verity‚Äôs manuscript. The second Mrs. de Winter learns about it from servants and acquaintances. They both draw first impressions that it was all magical and they both find out it wasn‚Äôt.\n\nThough the passion at first is undeniable, the married couples‚Äô personalities don‚Äôt fit and their marriages fall apart, even though they maintain their appearances. In both cases, appearances seem to me a very weak excuse! Why not quit already? Why stay miserable in a marriage for so long? It is just sad!\n\n9. Both Verity and Rebecca are portrayed as psychopaths\n\nObviously, they are vicious so that our heroines can be even more lovable. While Rebecca is, mostly, only promiscuous and doesn‚Äôt really love her husband, Verity seems absolutely evil. She must be, because Lowen is an imperfect mistress while the second Mrs. de Winter is mostly just shy and inexperienced, thus more easily loveable. Rebecca does her share of evil as well, but, I have to say, it pales in comparison to Verity.\n\nBut, more than that, they are both masterful at pretending to be perfect angels and charm everyone. The art of maintaining appearances is at the highest level with them.\n\n10. The allies\n\nBoth Verity and Rebecca have a nurse and a head housekeeper, respectively, who take care of them and antagonise the narrators further. Verity‚Äôs nurse is a sane person, she just empathises with Verity a lot. As she sees things, there is a young girl in the house, just trying to sleep with her patient‚Äôs husband while the patient is immobilised. It is actually the most natural and sane opinion of all. She makes us understand her dislike with her attitude towards Lowen.\n\nHowever, Mrs. Denver, Rebecca‚Äôs head housekeeper, is a bit insane all on her own. The death of Rebecca left clear marks on her and she does whatever she can to protect her memory and space in the house and in her master‚Äôs heart. She is openly hostile and antagonising. She is a fully developed character, whom we come to loath and hate just as much as we do Rebecca, if not more!\n\n11. The husbands\n\nThe husbands are terrible, terrible people!\n\n‚Ä¶and yes, that is possible!\n\nMaxim de Winter kills his wife, while Jeremy Crawford cheats on his comatose wife and then kills her. And the insanity is the narrators don‚Äôt seem to mind!\n\n12. Working as a couple\n\nThe newly formed couples seem perfect together even in crimes! Both narrators help the husbands to cover up their murders and lie to the police in order to live happily ever after.\n\nIn a way, I appreciate how the husbands come clean with them ‚Äì at least the new relationships can start in a solid, trusting place, right? And doing anything for each other, even covering up crimes ‚Ä¶must mean true love, right?\n\nOf course, there are lots? of differences\n\n‚ÄúVerity‚Äù is a contemporary novel while ‚ÄúRebecca‚Äù is written in 1938. That, of course, leads to characters acting their time: ‚ÄúVerity‚Äù is so spicy, ‚ÄúRebecca‚Äù is more restricted by the social conventions of the time.\n\nOf course, a big difference is the relationship between the narrator and the husband ‚Äì while Lowen and Jeremy Crawford have an illicit affair, the second Mrs. de Winter and Maxim de Winter only ever meet after Rebecca died. Though the spectre of the wife is ever present, one is a spicy affair and the other is absolutely innocent.\n\nWhen the narrators are met with judgement or rudeness from other people, the husbands react completely differently. While Maxim expects his wife to stand on her own and doesn‚Äôt offer any support, Jeremy fights Lowen‚Äôs battles for her. This might have to do with the fact that one is a legitimate relationship and one is an affair.\n\nWhile Rebecca cheats and humiliates her husband, Verity is obsessed with hers, to the point where she is jealous of her own children.\n\nWhile Rebecca is always absent, Verity‚Äôs point of view is very much represented by her manuscript and her letter.\n\nThe biggest thing I find that Verity adds is the talk of children part, the difficulty of motherhood and today‚Äôs expectations of it. I found that part so interesting and worth debating!\n\n‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs kind of it with the major differences. Please, feel free to point out more and let‚Äôs talk!\n\nWhat did you most like about these novels?\n\nWhat did you dislike about them?\n\nDo you find this to be a fair comparison?"
