        "text": "Instagram\n\nHe’s here! Bob Guiney took to Instagram earlier this month to share the exciting news that he and wife Jessica Canyon welcomed a second son, named Blake Barrett.\n\n“7/1/21. Blake Barrett Guiney. This is our life - and I am so thankful!” wrote the former Bachelor, who also shares son Grayson, 3, with Jessica.\n\n“Your big bro @graysonguiney can’t wait to meet you,” continued Bob, whose caption was accompanied by several snaps of himself and Jessica enjoying time with their newborn at the hospital. “So proud of @jescanyon for doing all of the heavy lifting! I appreciate you and love our little family!!”\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nBlake’s birth comes months after Bob revealed he and Jessica were expecting another baby boy. The couple announced their pregnancy in March.\n\n“I always thought we’d have a baby sister for Grayson. I have a sister and my wife has a brother but, life has other plans for us,” the proud dad wrote via Instagram at the time. “We’re having another boy!! YAY!!!”\n\nBob wed Jessica in 2016, two years before starting their family. Prior to finding his happily ever after with Jessica, Bob was married to “All My Children” actress Rebecca Budig from 2004 until 2010.\n\nBob — who currently serves as a part-time correspondent for the “Today” show and lives with Jessica and Grayson in Seattle, Washington — spoke with Us Weekly in 2020, expressing gratitude for all that has transpired since his time on the Bachelor franchise"
