        "text": "Rebecca serves as a trusted counselor, assisting clients in navigating sensitive and high-stakes issues. Her work involves collaborating with boards and management on executive hiring and termination, restrictive covenant strategy, policy development, and litigation avoidance. She is experienced in conducting internal investigations and providing related advice.\n\nHer advisory role extends to addressing employment and labor law issues in various transactional contexts, such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and restructurings. She manages employment due diligence, drafts and negotiates key terms, and advises on all employment and labor law aspects of these engagements. Rebecca’s transactional practice is augmented by her experience in traditional labor law, both as a thought leader and as a practitioner who has defended employers facing unfair labor practice charges, managed union avoidance initiatives, and developed and executed collective bargaining strategies.\n\nInforming her practice is her broad litigation background, including multiple jury trials. She has successfully handled significant disputes involving wage-and-hour, discrimination, retaliation, and harassment claims in state and federal courts and before employment-focused administrative agencies. She has also guided clients through restrictive covenant disputes, including successfully securing injunctions, on both the plaintiff and defense side.\n\nRebecca is currently recognized as a “Recommended Lawyer” by Legal 500 in Trade Secrets, Labor & Employment: Workplace & Employment Counseling, and Labor & Employment Disputes. She was named by Best Lawyers in America as “One to Watch” in its 2021, 2022, and 2023 editions, and by Super Lawyers as a “Rising Star” from 2019 to 2023. In 2024, Lawdragon 500 named her to its “X – The Next Generation” list, and Law360 selected her as one of five national Employment “Rising Stars.”\n\nShe earned her J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where she served as Research Editor for the Journal of Law and Social Change and was an Arthur Littleton H. Clayton Louderback Legal Writing Fellow. During law school, she interned for the Honorable Judith G. Dein of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Rebecca holds a B.A., summa cum laude, from Brandeis University."
