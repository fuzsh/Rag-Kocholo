        "text": "Rebecca Christine Doucet, 66, of Holmen, passed away March 15, 2024 with her husband Bob and niece Tamie Secor at her side at St. Mary’s Clinic in Rochester, MN. She was born July 8, 1957 to Clarence and Iva (Knutson) Gartner. She married Robert Doucet on August 6, 1977 in La Crosse, WI.\n\nShe loved gardening, plants, animals, and spent lots of time outdoors doing what she wanted to do. She was a great cook and homemaker and also bookkeeper. The household ran very smoothly without anyone’s help.\n\nShe dearly loved her granddaughter’s and wanted nothing more than to spend time with them. Only in the last few years did we not see them as much as her health condition deteriorated, but she kept in contact through calls and texts.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Robert; son, Paul; grandchildren, Marissa, Gabrielle; sisters Rita Gartner, Dawn (Greg) Hohlfeld; brother, Terry; brothers, and sisters-in-law, Mary Gartner, Virgil Skinner, other relatives and friends.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Clarence and Iva Gartner; brothers, Charles, Dennis; sisters, Donna Comer, Sandra Bray, Pat Secor, Vicki Skinner; brothers and sisters-in-law, Bruce Secor, Bob Comer, Ellen Gartner; nieces and nephews, Ron Comer, Charles Gartner Jr, Bruce Secor Jr, Adrian Gartner; mother and father-in-law, Joseph and Cordula Doucet; half-brothers, Elroy and Jerome Gartner.\n\nA celebration of her life will be Saturday, July 27, 2024, from 11-1:00 pm, Coulee Region Cremation Group, at The Gathering Place."
